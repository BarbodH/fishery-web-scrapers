We would be driving from Pine Falls...orginally starting from Fargo. tks in advance for your information. Steve"
561377,Guest,2006-09-25 11:34:00,0,The ramp at the park is fine. Use the 2 on the southside and you'll have no problems at all. Don't believe everything you read. Some people are dumber than others and dozens of people launched there over the weekend without incident.
561381,manitobawalleye,2006-09-25 22:44:00,885,"so a stranger from out of town would know this???? stu's is a good launch right in lockport the south 2 at the park are ok gullible should take a hike manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."
561297,Stu McKay,2006-09-21 15:57:00,18,"As I had stated earlier, the action has and will continue to excellerate as the days slide by. Today a party of mine from Ill. did extremely well! They landed a dozen nice eaters in the 20 to 21 inch range and they released a nine plus and another one at 1.5 lbs! Todays water temps are running at 59.5 degree's down two degree's from yesterday. Last year the Red produced oads of huge walleye, I will say again that we are in for yet another banner fall and winter season! So far my predictions are right on the money! Stay tuned..."
561302,REELMAN,2006-09-21 16:40:00,1624,"Stu, thanks for the report. I won't be coming for another month. I was wondering what is the best ramp to use?? thanks for the reports"
561305,jtrane,2006-09-21 19:15:00,1,"Stu, Jigs or cranks. Thanks"
561331,Stu McKay,2006-09-22 12:08:00,18,">Stu, Jigs or cranks. >Thanks Both are producing, the guys from Ill. were pulling cranks all day yesterday...they refuse to jig!? Best ramp? Selkirk ramp if you're heading north and my ramp if planning on hitting the mile etc. Keep in mind that the city owned and operated ramp in Selkirk is causing a lot of grief for some. I had a guy pull into my place this morning and said, ""no more Selkirk ramp for him""! Two launch attempts, two props!!!! Guess you can't blame the guy for being just a little PO!!! Selkirk's attitude toward this ""World Class"" fishery never ceases to amaze me and others alike. They don't promote it in any way shape or form! The launch facility is a total disgrace and it's become a liability to boot! In 2001, I spent approximately $15,000.00 upgrading my lauch facility, it's the cost of doing business! Would or will I do more upgrades if and when needed.........ABSOLUTELY!"
561332,Guest,2006-09-22 12:14:00,0,Stu Water higher or lower than 2003?? I think that was the year with all the launch troubles.
561337,Stu McKay,2006-09-22 14:36:00,18,">Stu > >Water higher or lower than 2003?? I think that was the year >with all the launch troubles. It's higher than '03, even with continuos south winds my ramp still allows access. We had some questionable days during strong south winds in '03. One day the ""tall-foreheads"" that govern over Selkirk's affairs ""might"" realize that the Red's bounty is worth something! ""Might"" being the operative word here, for until that day becomes a reality you find me sitting in a corner somewhere holding my breath for that eventful day to occur! Besides I have enough on my plate than to worry about Selkirk's woe's!"
561360,Guest,2006-09-23 21:01:00,0,"Stu, coming up with Mark Lafrenz again same time as Leckban,is the ramp at the park that bad or is it the operators? We usually use your ramp most of the time but if action is to the north we will use the park if possible but rather not blow a ss prop."
561365,manitobawalleye,2006-09-24 08:03:00,885,"mike send an email to get the ramp fixed here's the linkhttps://www.walleyecentral.com/dc/dcb...id=54672&page= manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."

Selkirk's ramp is still functional,avoid using the north ramps and your boat and motor should remain out of harms way. It's not any worse off than the last time you wold have used it. Locals from this region who frequent the facility only want to see the necessary upgrades that are needed to be implemented, simply put they are paying to use a facility that has become a liability to the city! WAKE UP SELKIRK!!!!"

WAKE UP SELKIRK!!!! I need to make another update on the status of the City of Selkirk's launch facility! I spoke with a guy yesterday who launched at Selkirk last week. He dropped his trailer into a massive hole and ended up shearing his axcel bolts off one side. This now made he trailer useless and prevented him from using it to tow his boat back to Winnipeg. $138.00 LATER USING A FLATBED TOW TRUCK, THEY LOADED THE ENTIRE RIG UP AND TOWED IT BACK TO THE CITY! Oddly enough, the guy said he never launch out of Selkirk again.....go figure!"
