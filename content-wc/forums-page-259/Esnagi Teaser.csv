We boated a number of fish in the 6-8lb class with my young boy Brendan catching the largest, a 301/2"" brute that weighed 101/2 lb's. He was pretty excited. Fish were concentrated on small humps and rock piles surrounded by deep water so you constantly had to watch your graph and stay on top of things.Trolling 2-3 ounce bottom bouncers and worm harnesses were the easiest way to stay on top of the structure and cover more water. We caught most of our best fish fishing this way. Any blade with purple in it worked well.Also caught a lot of fish drifting with jigs but it wasn't nearly as productive.Here's a few teaser pic's including Brendan's big walleye until the full story is finished."

4102345,Mike Borger,2015-08-04 15:18:00,1554,"Not quite as long as him Bill, but a good one nonetheless. I have a great video of him reeling it in that's priceless, he was pretty excited. The second he hooked it he said ""Dad get the net, it's big!"". He never says that so I knew it was different."

Nothing overly serious but I'm way behind on a bunch of stuff now. I leave for Sioux Lookout on the 21, if you want some intel call me direct, 905-630-8045 and have a map of the lake open in front of you. Cheers"
