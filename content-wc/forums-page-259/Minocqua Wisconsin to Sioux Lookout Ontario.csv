The wait was "" estimated"" to be 90 minutes. It would have been two plus hours based on the lines. We. chose to drive to Baudette and cross.......cost us some time,but it was nice to go a new way and see Sioux Narrows and Nestor Falls along with all the signs for the lodges so many on this forum talk about and visit each year. I prefer to drive 502 during the day just so I don't get cramps in my backside from the constant pucker factor of wildlife ruining a good day. I assume you are heading back to LSO again so say hello to Ken and Brenda for me. I'll get back there one of these years but in the meantime, jig up a few walleye for me off of Pecker Point. Travel safe . I look forward to hearing about how your trip went. PjShorthorn."
4138425,milfish,2015-08-18 11:15:00,249,"For 20 + years now i have been going to Lac Seul out of Sioux Lookout. I have always taken Hwy 2 through Northern Wisconsin to Duluth, then Hwy 53 to International Falls/Fort Francis, East on 11 to 502, 502 to Dryden, East on 17 to 72 then North to Sioux Lookout. Does anyone out there go from Duluth North to Thunder Bay to 17 and then West to 72? What are the pros and cons of this route and is it better. Thanks!"
4138633,Lovetofish,2015-08-18 12:11:00,458,You will add an hour to an already long drive.
4138657,djk50164,2015-08-18 12:19:00,370,"X2 the only time we have taking that route was 10-15 years ago when they got 11"" of rain and 502 was closed. Seen a lot of moose though."
4138745,vaquero01,2015-08-18 12:43:00,101,It will be more than an hour longer. The traffic on HWY 61 along Superior can be slow. But the views..... Oh yeah!
4139025,milfish,2015-08-18 14:11:00,249,Thanks guys! I can do 53 to 11 to 502 with my eyes closed so no reason to mess with the route.
4139089,camp chef,2015-08-18 14:23:00,915,"If you haven't been up the north shore of Lake Superior you need to take that route and plan on the extra time. Do it during daylight hours. I promise you you will not be disappointed. Prettiest drive in the midwest. We normally go through International falls because it is shorter, BUT whenever we have a new guy in our group that hasn't been up the north shore ,we plan a little extra time and show him the waterfalls and the beautiful lakeshore."
4139129,Carnhzkr,2015-08-18 14:35:00,964,"Good point, CC. Everyone should take this route at least once, and when you do, plan enough time to stop at some of the state parks and walk the trails and boardwalks along the numerous waterfalls. It really is a great drive, but it'd be better to be a passenger than the driver."

4139265,camp chef,2015-08-18 14:59:00,915,Sent you a PM Milfish.
4140473,roscoe33,2015-08-19 00:47:00,653,"The drive may take a little longer, but the border crossing is a lot quicker. Has never taken longer than 15 minutes to get across on a Saturday."
