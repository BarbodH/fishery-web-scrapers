4128057,fishincrazy,2015-08-14 14:41:00,1282,I have a question any camps have handicapped access? Not for a totally disabled person but for someone who is functional but has a hard time walking. Age is a factor here. One of my clients her 84 yr old mother and her man have been doing a Canadian trip for years but have to stop because the lodge they go to cannot accommodate them. Please let me know. Thanks Eh!FC Look out I'm crossing the border in 7 days I cant wait..............
