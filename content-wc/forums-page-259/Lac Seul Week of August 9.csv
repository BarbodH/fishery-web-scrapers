4132585,Shotgun,2015-08-16 12:40:00,759,"Returned yesterday from Lac Seul. Caught the majority of our fish pulling snells silver and/or gold spinners with minnows in 12 to 22 fow. Also did reasonably well with multi colored 1/8 green based jigs bouncing off bottom. Nephew was jacking around using a worm rig and put three yellow grubs on it bouncing it off the bottom. Pulled in a 29 3/4 inch walleye. Several days hot no wind produced tough fishing. MNR was checking boats. One group told us they received a lecture about filling their cooler with fish within one tenth inch of legal limit. MNR felt that hurts reproduction even when it is legal, they prefer you taking the smaller fish to eat vs. pushing the length to the max on every fish. Appeared due to their keeping fish one tenth inch to legal approach mnr was very aggressive with their inspection and measured every fish. We were checked and overall treated us very respectful. I showed him the fish cooler which we only keep 15 to 17 inchers and he said ok without measuring anything. Did ask what was in a smaller cooler and showed him sandwiches and water, assume looking for alcohol. Older mnr officer was training a younger officer. Biggest problem on the trip was coming home south of Ear Falls on 105. They had ground up the road for repair and then were watering it previous to rolling it flat. The ground up road tar based material was all over my truck and boat. Just a mess, had to use a semi washer to clean it up. Just seems like there would be another way vs. subjecting peoples vehicles to this mess. One guy was on a motorcycle headed that way, I'm sure he would of had a worse mess even on him let alone the safety of riding over piled up road material 12 inches high."

4134793,youngknight,2015-08-17 09:14:00,228,"Those MNR guys had no business whatsoever about lecturing the anglers for keeping legal fish just because they were at the upper end of being legal. I work in Ontario - used to with MNR although not in fish and game - and I work in a position where I deal with MNR a lot - not too often with conservation officers though but sometimes. If that happened to me I would write a letter to the District Manager telling them I don't deserve to be treated in that way when I was following all laws. If they don't want 18 inch fish being kept, then change the laws. Unfortunately many Conservation Officers think they have more power and knowledge than they actually do. They are NOT experts on fish and game management...they are only experts on enforcing fish and game laws. I have spoken with several over my career - even played hockey with some - most are good guys just trying to do what they are supposed to do...others are on power trips...got a badge and a gun and all of a sudden their 2 courses they took in college on fish management and they are suddenly a research fisheries biologist. Of course, you have to be polite for fear of being hassled but in truth, I've spent a lot of money coming to a place on vacation, I am respecting all fish and game laws --- you know what you want to tell the CO... I personally know one CO who entered into a deer camp to talk with the guys. It happened to be after dark. This one idiot goes to the bunk room and wakes up the camp codger - you know, most camps have the old guy who hunts a couple of hours but spends a lot of time napping and playing cards - might be me one day -...shakes this old guy awake and demands to see his deer license. Guess what, you don't need a license to sleep in a hunting camp. Point is, every occupation has them - majority of people are great, some are okay, and a few are idiots."
4134929,youngknight,2015-08-17 09:39:00,228,"I reread my post and I hope I am not implying that COs do not deserve respect for what they do or that they are not a vital part of fish and game management. They simply should stick to what they are there to do...it might be safer driving at 60 mph in a 65mph zone, but what would you say to a police officer who pulled you over to lecture you on driving 64 mph? Two more stories of actual CO incidences - guys I have met and know somewhat. One CO confiscated a moose from a hunter who shot a cow with now cow license...he was only entitled to shoot a calf. Confiscated the guy's gun and ATV as well. When he got back to the local MNR office the wildlife biologist was walking through the parking lot and asked this CO what was up with the calf moose in the back of his MNR truck. Next, a CO does pretty much the same for a guy who shot 5 ducks because the limit was only 4...lectured him, confiscated equipment and issued him a hefty fine...the CO was pretty pleased with himself until another CO back at the office reminded him the limit was 6, not 4. Sorry, sounding again like I'm dumping on COs...just that small percentage that are idiots."
4135465,tv4fish,2015-08-17 12:39:00,2694,"Youngknight: I disagree that they ARE idiots, But I will agree with you on the comment about some of them being on a ""power trip"". That applies to a certain number of LEO's, regardless of what ""field"" they are in. Some are on such an ""ego trip"" with a gun and a badge, they just can't get over themselves."
4136113,bigwillies,2015-08-17 16:47:00,515,talked to a fellow on friday that said his boat was absolutly covered in mud by the tim he got through construction headed to goose bay. hope it improves quick cuz i need to get out on lac seul too.
4136225,Shotgun,2015-08-17 17:22:00,759,The bad thing was it had a tar base which was very difficult to wash off. On the way up it was just dust but on the way home the watering turned it into somewhat of a tar based paste. I have never had such a mess on a vehicle. Beware if you head that direction.
