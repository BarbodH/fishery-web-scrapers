4129433,rnnonmt,2015-08-14 23:17:00,992,"So is the question a weight limit restriction based on safe operation of the aircraft MTOW or a weight limit based on $$? Lets get it straight here. If it is based on $$ open your wallet and pay the extra amount to bring what you want. If it is based on MTOW then, well, deal with the weight restriction."
4130465,octanehi5,2015-08-15 11:25:00,1104,"I know the flyin outfitter I use, they weigh everyone getting on that plane then determan how much weight in gear they can take. The extra overage weight payed for has always flown in on a seperate plane later in the day. Those planes are only designed to fly with so much weight.$$ do not make it safer. Reels rods and fishing gear comes in at about 50lbs. that covers any type of fly in fishing you can do."
4132081,Larry Mac,2015-08-16 09:01:00,530,"Hi Lighting Rod, I have been blessed to have experienced many very successful fly in adventures over the years. We are leaving in 2 weeks for a 7 day fly in. At first, like many I brought way to much gear LOL. Through experience, advice and research I have cut way back on gear as I am truly amazed at how little one needs to enjoy a week in the bush. This will be trip #40. I really have thought things through and refined my gear over the years. It is part of the adventure and is also a personal challenge to be as light and efficient as possible. I have never felt I wanted for anything. Now when I return from a trip I wash my clothes and repack immediately, restock the jig or lure I might have lost and I am ready for the next adventure. It takes a lot for a new ""Special Jig or Lure"" to make it into my box LOL. If fact I do not bring a Tackle Box, just a few small plastic boxes. I have attached a picture of the tackle that is going with me on this and all trips. Have a Great Adventure!!!!Thank you,Larry Mac"
4132145,itsme,2015-08-16 09:22:00,31,"Isme again Yes it true Zero...I leave it in the attic at the camp we fly into. Just back from trip #41 to Bull Moose Camp. Great fishing...Walleye @ 29 3/4, 28, 26, 26, 25.5, 25.5 for the two of us plus lots of other slot fish."
4132169,Larry Mac,2015-08-16 09:39:00,530,"Hi Itsme, That is excellent advice for those committed annual diehards that go back to the same wonderful camp every year. Great advice!!! Thank you, Larry Mac"
4135017,lightning rod,2015-08-17 10:02:00,15,"Well I have everything packed and I'm embarrassed to say my final weight. I think I did the best I can on non-tackle items given that I don't own light weight boots, sleeping bags rain gear or coat. I do have gear that other guys need and they don't have, like depth finder, buoy makers, rod holder, hook cuter for emergency etc. So depending on what the other guys have I may leave the 6 pound rod holder in the truck and replace the 4 pound tackle bag that hold the plastic boxes with an over sized zip lock bag. And I need to force myself to reduce by one more plastic Plano box and save another 2 pounds. I'm convinced my tackle is more than it should be but I'm willing to pay the extra cost and learn my lesson for next time. Weather looks like 50 lows and 60 high. The chili is made and frozen, and the food for 4 weighs in at less than 30 pounds."
4136097,Larry Mac,2015-08-17 16:38:00,530,"Hi Lighting Rod, reading your prior and last post on this subject I am impressed how much thought you have put into being as light and efficient as possible. Great Job!!!! Have a Great Adventure.Thank you,Larry Mac"
4124113,fish007,2015-08-13 05:51:00,120,"I just weighed my tackle bag for the trip my wife and I are leaving on today and its 24 lbs. I have reels , marker buoys and quite a few odds and ends packed in it so that isn't too bad. The camp we go to has a very generous 125 lb per person weight allowance. When the guys go in the spring some of them are pushing 350 and they get the same allowance as someone weighing 150 . Of course we're not talking a 180 Cessna, we fly in an otter which makes a huge difference"
4124153,btyreprich,2015-08-13 06:15:00,1067,"Biggamefisher: I understand your thoughts but want to point out that when we flew out to Northwest territories, our charter flight was on a very large prop airplane. Plane so big I don't think they weighed the baggage of any of the group flying into the main lodge. When it came time to fly into our remote camp from the main lodge, we were on a two engine float plane. Pilot seemed more concerned where each of the passengers were to sit on the plane so as to balance out the load. Fisherman that gave us the advice on putting on multiple layers of clothes were all BIGGER guys than my buddy and I. They were frequent guests of this lodge and their approach to reducing weight of the baggage seemed to work for them. Again, our float plane had two engines and there was empty seats on the plane so I was confident the plan was not carrying more weight than it could handle."
4124169,polaris-pete,2015-08-13 06:20:00,343,"I have found that with the fly-in Services I have used for 37 years that being honest= being safe! Most times each Customer is weighed, last time we were just asked how much we weighed.In all my Years we have only paid for overweight a few times.These planes have a built in safety margin for weight but as said before, they have to be able to clear the treetops.Most floats ( pontoons) have red safety lines painted on them and if they slowly go under the surface of the water, the Pilots will put not much more weight in the plane. Last Year the pilot actually pumped some ballast water out of them to accomodate our extra weight."
4124265,SinOrSwim,2015-08-13 06:57:00,1528,"The other option is to take what you want and if you are over, pay the fee. The amount you pay in overage fee is a fraction of the cost of the overall trip. They are expensive trips, why go without? Just take it and enjoy imo."
4124433,Mike Borger,2015-08-13 08:09:00,1554,"That's usually how I operate, and I've done a lot of these trips.Can only remember being charged for overweight twice as well. The outfitters I fly with take care of us.FWIW my tackle weighs 15-18lb's on average."
4125001,lightning rod,2015-08-13 11:28:00,15,"There has been some good and some interesting advice. Last night I did reduce a few more pounds by doing little things like taking out toiletries and putting just what I need in a zip lock bag, going from 2 bowie markers to 1. And taking out a few more duplicate lures and removing 1/8 oz jigs and cutting ¼ and 3/8 oz from 30 to 20 each. It's starting to add up. One guy has hardly any gear so he is light. I will share with him. I think my food weight for 4 guys will be less than 50 pounds so that helps."
4125417,octanehi5,2015-08-13 14:10:00,1104,"I'm with the fly it in if you think you need it group, Six guys this yr on a fly in , we were allowed 110 # per person, with all the food, drinks, water ,gear we were 390 lbs over at a cost of $55.00 per man. A small price to pay for having everything you need."
4126089,Stein67,2015-08-13 19:37:00,19,"As a pilot myself and having owned three different small planes I understand your concern but my question is this:Do they just charge you for the overweight and still load everything onto the same plane?Maybe the weight of the cash leaving your pocket offsets the extra weight in gear.Also, if they were that concerned it would be combined weight of the person + gear for a total allotment per person.Now, if they do load the overweight baggage onto a subsequent flight I'll buy what you are selling but I suspect it was due to past people bringing everything including the kitchen sink."
4126537,biggamefisher,2015-08-14 04:12:00,540,"They fly it in separately, but also I believe the charge is supposed to act as a bit of a deterrent."
4126849,strength22,2015-08-14 07:33:00,49,All I need for a fly in trip is some jig heads and floating jig heads with some small egg sinkers and a small split shots. That'll do'er for the trip. My tackle would way maybe 4-5 lbs.
4118649,lightning rod,2015-08-11 06:57:00,15,"I am packing for a Fly-in outpost trip and will mainly targeting Large Northern. I have reduced my tackle from 22 to 18 pounds. But with a depth finder 5.5, boots 5.0, rod holder and rods 10, rain gear, sleeping bag and a few cloths, I'm already over 55 pounds. About the only thing on the list to reduce is my tackle box. So when you fly-in how much does your tackle box weigh?"
4118697,tsquared,2015-08-11 07:13:00,57,"I have the same tackle issue, it's a sickness, and am almost identical in the weights you just listed. Assuming you are having beer and water flown in that's pretty good. We target 50-55lbs per person and assume 30-40 for food and cooking oil. Not everyone will have the depth finder, etc."
4118937,fishron,2015-08-11 08:24:00,317,"It's one of the things we always discuss on the way home. How many of the hundreds of lures you brought along did you actually use. My last trip was mainly for walleye but I did fish a fair amount of pike. I took one 3600 size plastic tray full of jigs, leaders, a few trolling plugs and it weighed no more than three pounds. I keep it in my boat bag where I also keep loose lures such as paddletail plastics and a few spinnerbaits and spoons. No more than a pound and a half. I may be traveling a bit light, but as most trips go, I use maybe four different walleye jigs and an equal number of pike lures. The plastics I need backup's on because pike rip them up. That's it. Good luck with your decision."
4119049,lightning rod,2015-08-11 08:42:00,15,"Everything just adds up 2 oz at a time. Bulldawgs 3oz, spoons 2oz, suicks, hard bodied crank baits, buck tails, spinners, and jigs. And the 5 Plano 3700 boxes to hold them. I have 2 colors of everything. Maybe the key is to take one of everything, cut the weight almost in half. And hope the lure you lose isn't the only thing the pike want that week. I can't spend hundreds of dollars more on a light weight sleeping bag, light boots, and a new depth finder to save 8 pounds. And like you said, my depth finder and rod holder will work for 2 people."
4123153,uv2021,2015-08-12 16:49:00,48,"Just before you get on the plane.Take your rods out of the case and put them in your sleeping bag with a few bungees wrapped around it.That will knock off some lbs. You can also transfer food from a cooler into a styro or cardboard box.Or use soft sided coolers.They are lighter. Wear the boots in,the pilot might not notice. Have the crew share one tube of toothpaste,shampoo ect.It all adds up."
4123889,roscoe33,2015-08-12 22:57:00,653,"I say cut your weight somewhere else. A gallon of booze, 9# equivalent amount of beer, 95#"
4123897,zeebee,2015-08-12 23:31:00,1144,18 lbs is way too much tackle on a fly in...I get it down to approx 10 lbs for two people and have never felt lacking. In fact I could likely cut back further.
4124041,biggamefisher,2015-08-13 04:34:00,540,Pretty sure you wouldn't want to hide anything and would want the pilot to notice any over-weight issues? Just sayin!
4124065,btyreprich,2015-08-13 04:52:00,1067,"Took a trip to the Northwest Territories with my buddy when we turned 50. The night before we left, other fisherman in the motel told us to wear almost all of our clothes and even put a reel or two in our jacket pockets. Anything you can do to reduce the weight of your gear. We also fished out of one tackle box and shared toiletries like shampoo & toothpaste. Like previous poster said, there's a lot of gear you bring that never makes it out of the box."
4124097,biggamefisher,2015-08-13 05:30:00,540,"Come on guys, surely you can't be that naïve? Planes have max takeoff weights, that is the reason pilots are show concern, it's not because they want to be jerks! Just because you wear all your clothes and stuff your pockets means nothing, your still getting on the same plane, so it doesn't matter that it's not in your bags! The pilot just wants to be able to clear the tree line at the end of the lake. Some pretty bad advise being given here!!!!!"
