4136489,rnnonmt,2015-08-17 19:23:00,992,"I am dark skinned, dark hair, brown eyes and living in AZ so one could confuse me with an illegal alien. My son looks nothing like me (he is a blonde, blue eyes and fair skin). Maybe they think I am smuggling young white kids into the US..... and btw, you're right Pat, I am kind of Squirrely looking!! Maybe I went wrong right from the beginning when I was asked where the vehicle was plated. Apparently ""the bumper"" wasn't the answer they were looking for."
4137161,roscoe33,2015-08-17 23:25:00,653,thats probably because they have a record of every time you have crossed the border. Same with the vehicle. Your plates are scanned and ran before you ever pull up to the window.
4137193,pjshorthorn,2015-08-18 00:14:00,5654,I'll have to remember the bumper line for the next time I'm asked about plates. That's funny right there. PjShorthorn

I am thinking of using a relatives car next year to drive to Canada in the summer. what kind of paper work will I need going and coming for the car? thanks. this year we drove from vegas and it was too much so I am thinking that next year we will just fly to Chicago and go from there. alan

The driver is secondary. The owner of the vehicle should be aware that they assume all financial responability in case of an accident."
4131321,roscoe33,2015-08-15 20:09:00,653,"A copy of the registration, insurance, and a letter from the owner that gives you permission to use, and cross the border, just in case a situation arrises. I have used my fathers truck. My mother has driven up in my truck."
4131745,SinOrSwim,2015-08-16 06:58:00,1528,"If you do a letter, make sure it is notarized."

4131913,pjshorthorn,2015-08-16 07:56:00,5654,"On the way back through the Baudette crossing this month I was asked where I was from ( I'm driving ). Answered the question. "" Does the car have Georgia plates ?"" No sir,they have Ohio plates. "" Who does the car belong to ? My father. ( I pointed to my Dad in the passenger seat ). Before any questioning the officer had already swiped our passports so he knew where we both were from. It would be a good idea to have documentation with you on the relative's car and notarized permission if you are traveling alone. It will demonstrate that you are prepared. You will most likely be questioned by the US vs. Canada if they follow the same line of questioning. Just my experience over the years. PjShorthorn."
4134361,tjandy,2015-08-17 07:00:00,107,"We take a borrowed van just about every year without any hassle. They used to asked who owned it, but they haven't done that for years now."
4134497,rnnonmt,2015-08-17 08:03:00,992,"My group is from Arizona and we drive from AZ in an RV towing my boat. We stop in Minnesota at the in-laws house and borrow a truck from them so that we can launch my boat each day without having to use the RV. When we cross the border I'm driving the in-laws truck with my 15 yr old son and absolutely no fishing equipment. Only once was I asked who the truck belonged to when crossing the border each direction. Apparently one US border agent didn't believe me after explaining to him and answering his questions. So he asked me if I knew who the registered owner was. I said my father in-law (by name) and the border agent said ""wrong"" so I then said my mother in-law (by name) and he said ""ok, what is the address then?"" I said ""really???"" I gave him the address and we were on our way back into the US. btw... I did have their insurance paperwork with me and registration but they never asked for it."
