4140729,vaquero01,2015-08-19 05:59:00,101,Didn't see the 16. Poop.
4140809,SinOrSwim,2015-08-19 06:32:00,1528,We will be taking 502. I know google says they are the same but I just have a tough time believing that.
4138537,port1042,2015-08-18 11:49:00,509,"No Milfish, you've got it wrong. North from Duluth to Fort Frances. West/North on 71 to 17 (near Kenora). East on 17 to Vermilion Bay then north on 105."
4138641,Lovetofish,2015-08-18 12:14:00,458,"502 is in good condition. I was on it last week. It's not the easiest or safest road to take, but it is the shortest route."
4138721,vaquero01,2015-08-18 12:39:00,101,"Leaving NW Indiana on 8/26 and headed to Onaway. Per NARDA1's link, 105 should be done 8/26. Gonna try 71 this year instead of 502 just for a change of scenery."
4138785,Bakefish,2015-08-18 12:55:00,1077,I guess I'm one of the few who looks forward to 502.
4138833,Carnhzkr,2015-08-18 13:06:00,964,"I always look forward to 502 - look forward to getting to the end of the road, that is. I hate that stretch, just because it's boring and seems to go on for ever. That said, that's the route I always take. It's shorter, quicker, and in good condition. On my June trip, I did see one sight on 502 that made me shiver. A guy was waving to slow down traffic. As we approached, we could see a trailer with a fiberglass boat snapped literally in two and was off to the side of the road. Looked like the axle and frame of the trailer both broke and the boat's stern was resting on the edge of the pavement. That's the wrong road for any kind of mishap."
4139041,SinOrSwim,2015-08-18 14:13:00,1528,"Just a heads up. The first hour or more of 71 is a REALLY boring and sort of ugly drive. Just flat pasture land for the most part. There is absolutely nothing until you get to Nestor Falls. If you are looking for places to stop, then it is definitely a better option. Whether it be to eat or the waterfalls etc. But, if you just want to drive the other way is faster. Shorter but also doesn't have the towns forcing you to slow down either. Then again, I just googled it and it says they are only about 4 minutes difference? That doesn't seem right?"
4139049,milfish,2015-08-18 14:13:00,249,Great thanks. I figured I couldn't have been that wrong all these years. Ha!
4139105,BChris,2015-08-18 14:26:00,11,The reference indicated the end of construction date as: 8/26/2016! Could this be correct?
4140425,Aspencreek,2015-08-18 22:46:00,2911,"4 minutes HAHAHA!!! If we take 71 it's always closer to an hour longer, but that's because on 502 we can use one of the load check areas for , well you know, but on 71 we have to stop at one of the restrooms along the way."
4140601,GBAutumn,2015-08-19 05:01:00,5,Thanks for all of the great information everyone. The link says 71 is under construction as well. Can anybody comment on the extent of that?
4136873,GBAutumn,2015-08-17 21:09:00,5,I am leaving Saturday for a week in Ear Falls. I am curious from anybody the status of construction and best route from Fort Frances? Took 502 last year but the trailer paid for it. I am hearing there may be construction on Hwy 71 this year. Thanks for any advice.
4136905,Shotgun,2015-08-17 21:22:00,759,Drove back Friday from just south of Ear Falls. Hwy 105 was under construction/repair. They had ground up the asphalt base. When we hit it they had just watered it down and was rolling it in. Worse mess I have ever had to drive through. The ground up tar based material was stacked up 10 to 12 inches in places. It was all over my boat and truck. Had to use a semi washer to get most of it off and it still needs more detailed cleaning. I'm not sure what you would do if you were on a motorcycle and hit that mess. Bottom line for me is if I knew I'd be subjected to this I would not go back! Sorry for the rant but it was not a good situation for the traveler or vehicle owner. Possibly could of set it out for awhile and the road might of dried out some as on the way up it was just dust and rough. Just stuck to everything including my boat cover.
4136945,btyreprich,2015-08-17 21:31:00,1067,"We came back from Ear Falls a week ago and used Hwy 71 on the trip up to Ear Falls and then back home. Using this route will add like 30 miles to the trip, but in our opinion it's well worth it. Our group was just too tired on Hwy 502 for a number of reasons including: Sections of rough roads Very steep inclines and declines People pulling a boat and trailer taking crazy chances to pass other vehicles on sections of the road that are just not safe No gas or emergency services unlike on Hwy 17 The few sections of road work on Hwy 17 were really not much of an issue."
4137489,vaquero01,2015-08-18 06:49:00,101,"Can anyone elaborate on 105 construction, like from where to where? Thanks"
4137553,Shotgun,2015-08-18 07:15:00,759,"Not sure this will help much in regard to road repair location as I don't remember the exact area and it will no doubt move as they repair. However, we hit a couple sections that seemed to start about 15 miles south of Ear Falls. One section was probably a mile long. It was the watering that created the mess on vehicles. I can be somewhat particular with my equipment but in my opinion this was something beyond acceptable. The ground up tar based material just made a real difficult mess to remove and clean up."
4138009,NARDA 1,2015-08-18 09:14:00,636,This link will help you out.http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/tra...tract2015-6011
4138249,bigwillies,2015-08-18 10:31:00,515,105 construction begins a few miles south of cedar lake( at april rd.) and goes almost to perault falls.
4138297,milfish,2015-08-18 10:41:00,249,"So going to Red Lake, its only 30 miles further taking 71 instead of 502? Am I to assume from Northern Wisconsin, go up to Duluth then North through Thunder Bay to 71 then West on 71 to Vermilion Bay is only 30 miles further? I've always gone through Fort Francis and up 502. I agree that 502 has issues and if its only 30 miles further, might be worth a try."
4138329,Hump,2015-08-18 10:45:00,578,That way we won't have traffic on 71.
4138529,Carnhzkr,2015-08-18 11:46:00,964,"No way. That's way off. You're thinking of 61 from Duluth to T'Bay. 71 is the alternate route from Ft Francis to Vermilion Bay. The shortest is to take 502 to Dryden. 71 takes you through Nestor Falls and Sioux Narrows. That's a beautiful drive from Duluth to T'Bay, but it is very slow going and would be considerably longer. The quickest (and best IMO) is to cross at Superior/Duluth, then up 53 to FF, then 502 to Dryden, although some argue that 71 is better than 502. I just came back via 502 and no construction and roads were in great shape. True that there is nowhere to stop if you'd need help for some reason, but I like to roll the dice."
