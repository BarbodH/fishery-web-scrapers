3250289,FrankLeigh,2014-10-17 15:05:00,80,"If this proposal becomes law, it may create some insurance issues for our American friends, in respect to theft or damage or liability.I only say this because when we looked into leaving a car in Florida, we found that it would need to be registered and insured in Florida. Our Ontario insurer would not cover it. Just another wrinkle to consider.Frank"
3250321,Andre (wallyandre),2014-10-17 15:16:00,2274,Trailer need a inspection There is no follow-up on the boat registration. So you can keep the registration from the state you purchase Difficult to find an insurance for a non resident
3250353,roscoe33,2014-10-17 15:29:00,653,"My parents , Wisconsin residents, have a 30' camper that is titled, insured, and kept in Ontario for 15 years. No problems. They made several trips to CA every year, towing the boat up in spring, leaving it there for the summer, and towing it back to the states in fall. So much easier."
4130785,Pinsel,2015-08-15 15:08:00,1,"I was reading the thread about the storage/repairs in Canada. I am a property owner in Canada, but a US citizen. We have been vacationing on Lake of the Woods for generations. We have a boat, and have over the last few years have stored or had our boat repaired in order to store it. We were advised of the changes that were going to take place. The Marina, told us that we could pay 5% of the value of our boat at the border (he drew up a work order with a value of our boat and trailer) and took pictures of both to present at the border. When we got to the border, there seemed to be some confusion, but we were told we could pay the 5% and that would make us ""legal"" for storing our boat. They also told us that we could have the boat plated if we wanted. We told them that we weren't interested in plates because we would be bringing it back to Illinois from time to time and we were going to keep the plates current and the boat registered in Illinois. Got our receipt and paperwork and off we went.... Now I get a letter from the Registrar of Imported Vehicles saying that they have not received the import fee payment of $220.35 as outlined under section 17 of the Vehicle Import Form. I was wondering if anyone has had any experience like this?"
3241105,LOW1,2014-10-14 08:01:00,2828,"Here's a heads up for American citizens storing boats in Canada. In the past winter storage of boats registered outside of Canada at a Canadian marina was permitted as long as the marina was repairing or servicing the boat. One needed to fill out a blue temporary importation card and file it with Canadian customs at the border.When I recently did so I was told by customs that this is likely to change next winter and that the boat will likely need to be imported into Canada and the importation tax of 5% paid. My marina confirmed that a change is likely in the works. Final regulations are still pending and there is a possibility that these may include taking the boat to customs for it to be inspected.Overall not a big deal, but people may wish to plan for more time to get the paperwork processed, etc next fall. And no one seems to know whether the inspection is just to verify value and that the tax is paid or whether it will include an inspection of the boat's safety equipment for compliance with Canadian standards, etc.Your marina will hopefully be receiving more information."
3241993,tv4fish,2014-10-14 14:47:00,2694,5 percent of what? A used boat is valued how???
3242377,Andre (wallyandre),2014-10-14 17:11:00,2274,CBSA are using NADA book for value
3245353,mrwalleye5,2014-10-15 18:06:00,1922,"I can't even imagine our Canadian Goernment doing such a thing! My gosh, what is the world coming too? Lol"
3245913,muskyman73,2014-10-15 22:12:00,402,"Nice, 5% times how many boats are stored like this ? Sounds like an ATM machine on the loose. Oh wait, that's Minnesota and the trailering law....$5.00. And California and the boat inspections at the ramps / quarrantine too. Illinois and our corrupt officials. My god this is awesome !!!!"
3245921,roscoe33,2014-10-15 22:54:00,653,"I doubt that the inspection is to ensure the boat is up to ""standards"", as no boat needs to meet any standards unless it is on the water. And won't it be convenient to get the boat to an inspection station, especially if you don't have a trailer. And if it is ""imported"", whatever that means, will it need to be registered in CA. What if you take it back stateside for a month, need to pay the 5% again? Oh my head hurts."
3245953,kzoofisher,2014-10-16 03:37:00,5144,"Doesn't sound like a money grab, sounds like simplifying the rules for the small percentage of boaters who would have been effected. If you stored or repaired your boat in Canada you had to take it home at the completion of storage or repair anyway. Anyone who didn't had de facto imported their boat without paying duty on it. That's the way the law read back in the spring, anyway."
3245977,Skywagon,2014-10-16 04:29:00,1106,"If you are required to import the boat/trailer into Canada they will both need to be registered and licensed in Canada, the trailer will require plates. In order to register and plate the trailer it will require a safety inspection, which used to cost $75 (not sure if that fee has changed). The inspection is usually done at a Canadian Tire store as they are one of the approved inspection stations (these stores are scattered throughout Canada). After the importation/registration process is complete, you now have a Canadian boat/trailer, (not US any longer as you gave up US title) and there will be no more taxes to be paid, even if you cross back and forth across the border with it. The question that comes to my mind, is there a law (you may not be aware of) in the US or you're state that does not allow a foreign boat/trailer to stay in the country after a certain length of time? Probably not a problem since you would be with it (is attended). These same rules apply to airplanes and other vehicles, not only boats when left unattended in Canada (when the owner is back in his home country). I think in the end, we all have to realize we are visitors in each other's countries, rules/laws vary from country to country, state to state, we do no necessarily have all the rights that are granted to the residents of those other countries or states."
3245993,Blue Lk,2014-10-16 04:44:00,269,"There is no safety inspection required to register a trailer in Ontario,cars & trucks yes but not a trailer"
3246049,Skywagon,2014-10-16 06:10:00,1106,"I just imported a new 14 foot aluminum tandem axle utility trailer from the States in May of this year, had to have the inspection done at Canadian Tire in Dryden. If it was not imported it would not have been necessary. That would be the rub in the case being discussed, it would be imported."
