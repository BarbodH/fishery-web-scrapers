If anyone has been there at this time of year, I'd appreciate any feedback you might have. Two of us are driving to Winnipeg on Thursday, to Thompson on Friday, then we fly out of Thompson on Saturday morning to the lake. We will mostly be looking for large pike, though we will fish some for walleye. We are doing the unguided trip, its a pretty big lake so it will be easy to get overwhelmed. I know that the weed beds are getting to the peak at this time. I don't have a lot of experience fishing pike in weeds except for cranking weedless spoons over the top of weeds. Will there still be big donkeys on deep structure up there at this time? I'm finding it tough to pack within the 50# weight limit and still bring my flyrod - plus conventional gear- net, big plastics, measuring stick, swim baits, big plugs, spoons, couple glide baits, couple prop baits, buck tails, spinnerbaits, crank baits, and 25 walleye jigs. I would like to bring my big net because I think it will be better for the fish than the cradles because we won't have to wear out big fish as much to get them into the cradle. Any thoughts or feedback please respond or send a PM. I've always wanted to go to Dunlops and I'm really fired up about this trip!"

4125849,lassh,2015-08-13 17:43:00,553,"We fished Dunlops Lodge at Lake Waskaiowaka from August 1 through August 7. It is highly recommended as a trophy pike lake. Just check out the Manitoba Master Angler awards and note how many pike come from this Little Churchill chain- Waskaiowaka/Pelletier/Campbell. The weather for the week was challenging to say the least. It rained every day and was windy every day. The first day we didn't go on the main lake due to high winds so we fished the river. The two of us managed to catch 38 fish the first day, 21 walleyes and 17 pike. All the eyes were over 18. Biggest was 24. We were doing a lot of exploring thus spent time in unproductive areas. We only got in a half day fishing the first day. This post is getting way long so I'll summarize (We caught the least fish on the first day)- -Boats- excellent, 16 ft. flat casting deck, lots o' room. 30HP 4 stroke Yammies (40HP on guide boats). Depthfinders, fish cradles -Staff- Super, friendly and helpful and busy all the time keeping things orderly - Fishing- Very good considering the weather, strong east and north east winds. The big pike appeared to be buried down in the weeds. They were generally reluctant to come out to chase and it was often too windy to maintain the boat to effectively fish specific spots. We caught 3 over 40, a 44, 41.5 and 40. We caught a bunch between 34 and 37 and bunch between 28 and 33. These fish are thick and healthy. -The walleye fishing was nutso. Many eyes were caught while pike fishing with giant spinnerbaits, bucktails, shallow raiders, and musky glide baits. We only intentionally fished for eyes maybe 8 or 9 intervals and caught them every time we tried. - Lodge- old and rather small but kept very clean and cozy. Food- good. -Guides- can't really comment as we were unguided. The guides will put you in productive areas using proven techniques and get you around the lake. It's a huge lake and there are some shoals and rocks seemingly in the middle of nowhere. We did get around to different areas of the lake but had to be really cautious. The depth finder wouldn't read when at speed and I was unable to find a spot on transom where xducer worked at speed. Just be careful if unguided. -Getting there- we drove from Illinois (Frank came from Indiana) to Winnipeg the first day and then to Thompson the second day. Thompson is a 7 or 8 hr drive across a very sparsely populated area and is quite boring. I wouldn't suggest wandering around at night looking like a tourist fisherman in Thompson. We flew to lodge from Thompson and landed on a grass runway behind the lodge. There are flights from Winnipeg to Thompson if you would like to avoid the drive. Jim Crowley and his cameraman, Kirk were there for a few days from Hook and Hunt TV. He will broadcast a couple shows on HookandhuntTV.com. Owner- Jerry Dunlop, top notch, straight shooter, extremely knowledgable from years of guiding, great host with great family. To conclude- It was more expensive and a longer drive than my usual trips but I would go back in a heartbeat."

4128049,jambi,2015-08-14 14:38:00,504,Great report thanks for sharing. Looking at rates look very reasonable. Always wanted to do a trip to far Northern MB or Sask.
