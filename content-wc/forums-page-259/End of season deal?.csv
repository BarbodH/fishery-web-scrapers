4138169,adempsey,2015-08-18 10:11:00,963,"On the flip side, there will definitely be those groups that book a week off in far advance and just shop around at the last minute. There could be a lot of options as long as you're flexible.Of course, I wonder how many outfitters do offer a price break but don't advertise? I've never really tried.It makes sense to offer some form of discount, but I have no idea on what type of flexibility the outfitters have. I think a family or child discount makes even more sense, but not all outfitters offer that either."
4138233,Golden Eagle,2015-08-18 10:29:00,2642,"I'm for: Advertised discounts for all guests during certain parts of fishing season One or two free days if it fills a hole in a flight schedule Discounts for frequent guests .................................................. .................................................. ..... I don't like the idea of a guest pencil whipping a camp owner into providing a discount that is not offered to other guests during the same time, under the same conditions."
4139097,forgop,2015-08-18 14:25:00,880,"So, do you begrudge the person staying in the same hotel or in the seat next to you that got a rate for half of what you paid?Supply vs demand Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-N910A using Tapatalk"
4139257,Fisherman Ted,2015-08-18 14:58:00,461,"Much of this discussion and hence approach to discounting is based on the type of operation as well as the price-point. To the person that said an empty cabin has a value of zero. For a full American Plan operation there is a cost to that cabin. Sunk, yes but also operating. If that cabin costs me $200 a night and I charge $250, any sort of big discount is actually losing money. Also, the margins in this industry are very, very low. This isn't nearly every other industry with 40-45% margins out of the gate. If you are hitting double digits on your margin that's pretty darned good. So doing the math there is little room for heavy discounts without in fact losing money. Now of course the argument could be made that you may be attracting new customers and are you okay with forgoing a profit on that customer with the hope of a future sale. That is a question we each need to make. That question is also heavily dependent on your price point as well as your occupancy rate. Occupancy rates are the key piece here and one that I pay extremely close attention to. If I am too high that means my price point is too low for demand. Too low and I have a problem. Point being that if your business model is successful and your occupancy rate is in the mid 70 percentile (ideal in this industry) then discounting should never come up. Your customers are pleased with your offering and price and more importantly you have room to grow. Occupancy over 85% is just as bad as being too low. This can impede growth and indicates a pricing issue. To give huge discounts just to fill an empty cabin that comes with a cost to it does not always make sense if the business is sound. But every business is different and for sure this industry has taken hits and is undulating to no end. Every dollar counts for many, margins or not."
4140033,Hawkfan,2015-08-18 19:01:00,237,"Definitely has to do with the type of operation. Makes way more sense to discount a trip to a remote fly in as long as there is a plane going there already, than it does a drive to lodge with meal plan included. Obviously can't make a blanket statement across the industry."
4134145,pjshorthorn,2015-08-17 05:37:00,5654,I was interested but then found out you and Breezy were getting a better deal than I would have. PjShorthorn
4134185,v-bay gord,2015-08-17 05:57:00,3168,I currently offer 10% off in September......10% off if you make a second trip (20% if it is in September)..........and if you pay in US dollars another 20-30% discount. I think it needs to be said again that your biggest discount this year (and likely next) will be with camps that have their rates in Canadian $.
4134297,SinOrSwim,2015-08-17 06:30:00,1528,"Very good post. I do think there is probably a difference in what type of camp it is. Full meal plan, dock staff, guides etc or a camp that offers a cabin and a boat. Then, those Sept dates make sense to offer a discount because your costs are more fixed than a lodge that has a large service staff. And, big difference between giving a 10% discount and what I'm assuming some are using as a comparison like expedia or something and getting a 50% discount. We have always gone in late August or mostly September. We have always had a small off peak discount for September dates."
4135225,wallydave,2015-08-17 11:00:00,2151,Mike your reply was spot on in my book. Its interesting to how any thread can go in so many different directions!
4135585,Kansas Bound,2015-08-17 13:05:00,152,"This is weird to me. Isn't September the best or second best fishing month of the year? At the camp I attend, the month of July is advertised as 20% off because the fishing is so much slower and the weather is hotter."
4135721,forgop,2015-08-17 14:48:00,880,"Agree completely Mike. In the case of a fly-in trip, if you have an open week, your cost is fixed for the flights for the group coming out and next group going in. Better to fill the plane with what is considered a low occupancy at a reduced rate than getting nothing. Your only additional expense for the group is fuel/propane, so you'll likely come out another $1k+ ahead for just a group of 2 after expenses than just sitting empty. I think I'll put in for vacation the first week of September next year and see what kind of last minute deal I can get."
4136929,Aspencreek,2015-08-17 21:29:00,2911,"Mike is right on the nose. BTW, post that site as soon as you can!! Now that I am getting closer to retirement and my wife will be more than happy to get rid of me for a week or more, I will be one of those ""baby boomers"" getting to that age. We have the time, the resources, and the will to take advantage of those last minute deals. Sometimes just the idea that this can be done on short notice is all someone needs. Like I said before, if my camp owner emailed me and said that he had a cabin open week 2 of sept and is offering out first come first serve at a 10-15% discount, you can bet it would take me all of 10min to get back to him."

4133305,bthomas3333,2015-08-16 19:04:00,465,Not understanding why anyone would be pissed about last minute deals. If a lodge can maximize profits by filling a few last minute slots then sobeit. I don't sit on a plane and ask everyone what they paid to see if I paid a higher price.If folks are flexible then maybe they deserve a better deal. They also run the risk of not having a place to go when they wait for last minute deals.B-
4133321,Bstar,2015-08-16 19:20:00,564,"C'mon guys, this is nothing more than a supply and demand issue. September has to be the slowest month for any camp/lodge/fly-in operation. If I were a camp owner, I would do anything in my power to fill those cabins. Giving a discount does not in no way devalue the product that a camp owner offers. He is just trying to maximize his income from a finite amount of time that he has to operate each year. Those of us that prefer to go in May,June or July should expect to pay full price because historically those are the prime months to go fishing in Canada, although that could lead to another discussion.How many of us have bought a vehicle at the the end of the year to save a few bucks or took advantage of Cabelas or Bass Pro's end of season sale? This is the same thing-the product is the same but the retailer just wants to move it even if it's at a lower price.I have taken advantage of some of these discounts. My wife and I flew into an American plan lodge a couple of years ago. We went to this particular lodge because they had a 10% couple discount in July. I am currently checking into another American plan lodge that is offering 1/2 price to the second person in September. The bottom line is the camp owner has a product to sell and he needs to market it appropriately to generate new business and to keep old business.Just my humble opinion."
4133425,HeHooksHimself,2015-08-16 19:40:00,725,"Man, those Hoosiers are smart!"
4133465,mt hook,2015-08-16 19:47:00,65,"Lots of camps offer a 10 or 20% discount for a Sept. booking. I have never given it a second thought. In over 30yr. never have i bin asked what I paid to stay at this campor any other. If someone did have the nerve to ask, I would say none of your business... That between me/group and the camp owner."
4133625,wallydave,2015-08-16 20:44:00,2151,"It's an interesting direction this thread has gone! I was offered a nice rate, and just wanted to try to put a group together! Thanks for all the replies, anyone up for a last minute trip?"
4133737,Aspencreek,2015-08-16 21:26:00,2911,"This is an interesting question. I understand where fly-in's and remote camps may not want to offer specials. But for those camps that are drive too, why not offer specials, particularly if you have a couple of open cabins. Look at it this way, open cabins are like airline seats. They are expensive until just before the plane leaves the gate, but after the plane takes off, those seat are worthless. (now I understand that planes really don't have empty seats anymore, but you know what I mean) Those open cabins are making you nothing for the time they sit empty, if fact they are still costing you some kind of expense. Why not offer them at a discounted price. I approached my camp owner with that same question a couple years ago, and he was reluctant to ""devalue"" his product too. My response was an open cabin is already devalued below $0. Offer the discount to existing clients starting 2-4 weeks ahead of the opening, use your website, email the special to your captured clients emails, then expand your circle from there. I'll tell you this, if a camp owner emails me a special deal on an open cabin for early sept and I can put the group or a partner with me, I'm in. Like it or not, camp owners are in the hospitality business, and that business is about filling spaces. Besides how many of you are offering ""SHOW Specials"" in the winter?"
4134081,Mike Borger,2015-08-17 05:04:00,1554,"I may be in a unique position to comment on this. For what it's worth I'm currently working directly with over 100 outfitters nationwide, although most within Ontario. This year I began offering last minute specials for a large number of these outfitters. Typically these deals are listed within one month of the departure date and it's usually a hole between groups or a cancellation the outfitter in question is attempting to fill. In some cases it's simply a slow time of the year (Aug/Sept).Some outfitters refuse to participate because they're afraid of devaluing their product and potentially angering regular customers.I have some thoughts on this.First, there's an entire industry based on last minute travel. It works for every other type of business, why not fishing and hunting?Second, very few people can afford to wait until the last minute to book a trip. Vacation time needs to be booked far in advance. I have not had ONE single complaint from any long time regular customer over the cheaper last minute rates. Any reasonable person understands the difference.Third, and this is important. For those outfitters refusing to participate you're losing a ton of business! Among other things what the reduced rate does is foster a WHOLE lot of goodwill towards the outfitter in question! What typically happens is many will rebook at the regular rate if they enjoyed the experience. I've seen it time and time again."
4134089,Mike Borger,2015-08-17 05:10:00,1554,Sorry Dave!
4134121,pjshorthorn,2015-08-17 05:31:00,5654,This. X10 On our trip this year the lodge had one cabin open. A group from Manitoba walked in unannounced looking for a place. I never worried about what price they may have gotten vs myself. It isn't my business on what other patrons ma y get in terms of prices.I was glad to see the camp full. Sometimes a special deal or a last minute booking can be the best marketing tool for a camp if the group has a great time. PjShorthorn

4130545,Golden Eagle,2015-08-15 12:00:00,2642,When it becomes unfair to other guests.
4130553,Fisherman Ted,2015-08-15 12:03:00,461,"As an owner I rarely give deals, even during slower periods. Unlike say a hotel a lodge comes with pretty high service costs and very low margins. Also you need to be careful devaluing your product. I would rather keep my margins where they need to be and turn away a small reservation than undercut my offerings. My price is my price. Hopefully you want to come based on that. If not than I am doing something wrong. Also, to be honest a lull in the season is a welcomed time. The staff gets to take a breather and we have time to work on well needed maintenance and improvement projects. 16 weeks is not just for reservations but capital expenditures as well. We can't work in the winter, ice out abuts our open and the close has many staff leaving back to school. So we take advantage of any slow times and get right to work. -FT"
4130657,wallydave,2015-08-15 13:49:00,2151,"I have been in contact with Hidden Bay for several years, Shaggy contacted me for the end of the season special. I have simply tried to share this deal with others here on WC. I will not post the rates, that would not be fair from my point of view. One group has signed up, that's fine HBL has been in business for some time. If they offer a reduced rate to fill a few cabins, that's their decision, they say they have a 98percent return rate, they will get bookings from these groups, plus hopefully some great reports posted on WC!"
4132049,HeHooksHimself,2015-08-16 08:49:00,725,"My best fishing buddy and I do a spring trip that usually is 4-8 guys. We go to the same place almost every spring and we have a great relationship with the camp owner. This camp is probably slightly higher than many, but we like the solitude and the ""fly in feeling"" at a more reasonable rate. Just he and I also take a fall trip. We always try somewhere new so we can see what else is out there. This is why filling spots is better than not at the risk of ""devaluing"" the cost. It is common knowledge that hardly any camps are full in September and giving us a good value look at your camp may just convince us to return. Nothing is better than first hand experience when planning your annual trip."
4132249,Pikeslayer8,2015-08-16 10:15:00,1460,"I concur entirely with what Hooks and Wallydave have said. After my spring trip, I'm thirstin for more. I love to do fall trips, yet the time and travel is tough for me. If I was an fly-in outfitter, I'd offer a special tack-on trip to any customer interested in closing up a camp. Outfitter gives the close out list of duties to the group able and willing to do this and when the pilot comes to pick them up, final closing duties are done and voila, camp closed for cheap."
4132625,zeebee,2015-08-16 13:01:00,1144,"Im quite suprised more operators dont offer deals.... Ive seen a few websites that indicate a given camp has a one week opening between two bookings. They have to fly in anyway to pick up and drop off the two groups....so why not offer a deal if its a last minute situation....Nope...""our prices are our prices""......not a business savvy decision."
4132841,Pooch,2015-08-16 15:01:00,4619,"If I were a regular at a camp and found out that some new folks got a ""deal"" I might be a little irritated and consider just waiting for a deal next year instead of booking in advance. If I book a year or even six months in advance then I'm satisfied with the price at the time and want a certain date and or cabin reserved for me. Yes, I understand trying to keep cabins full to at least cover operating costs vs an empty cabin for a week. On the other side, if I were time flexible and could not commit early to a trip or was not concerned about when a cabin my or may not be available then I'd probably wait for a ""fill in"" price. Knowing that it may not happen and miss an annual trip trying to save a buck.These trips are too important to me and many other's to not have a cabin booked early. Saving a few buck and risking not going isn't on my radar. If I owned a camp and had a last minute cancellation, I'd offer the open slot to my long time customers at a small discount first. With email, you could make the offer first come first served to your customer database in very short order. I doubt you would be devaluing your product with that approach. And I understand the intrinsic value of the product such as an open cabin in a seasonal camp. I'd be very reluctant to devalue my product and alienate my loyal guests at any price by cutting deals. I think that is a dead end eventually and only for the desperate.Sorry for the ramble, just my unorganized thoughts.Pooch"
4132897,Baseline,2015-08-16 15:28:00,3207,"This a good question. There is a resort campground I have used for at least 20 years. Because it is on some great water and very remote the campground was once very popular. Over the years the owner gradually raised his prices from what was once reasonable per site charge to a price per person exceeding $250 US per week. We generally have 4 in our party and that is $1000 US plus tax. He provides a site, a shower house, minimal electricity good for lighting an RV, small dock that with room for 7 or 8 boats that is first come, so you have to park your boat on the bank and thats it. The place used to be jammed and now only 40 to 50% of the sites are taken in the June prime time. The one popular fall season has even less occupancy. I have talked to the owner about their pricing and it falls on deaf ears. He is still making a good chunk of $$ with the 6 to 8 sites that are still being used, but all are annual guest and there has been lots of talk about finding a new less expensive spot. One by one the regulars have stopped coming each year and gone elsewhere. I have to admit that we are looking for an alternative. So where is the price break between full vs empty in the resort business?"
4132937,SinOrSwim,2015-08-16 15:53:00,1528,"I can't imagine most people are waiting til the last minute to book a lodge. So, there is no incentive to give a discount early on. Many places have discounts for off-peak season stuff. But, it's not the type of trip people go to priceline or expedia to book at the last second. As for the increases. Sometimes it makes sense. If they can increase their prices, generate the same revenue with 50% of the people...........that is a win. Less maintenance, less staff, less wear and tear.........same revenue. As for ZeeBee. lol Always easy to tell someone how to run their business. Go buy one and start giving discounts. Seems like a niche market you could exploit........if it makes so much business sense. Most small business owners know exactly their costs etc off the top of their head. My guess is if something happens or changes at the lodge, they are doing the math in their head knowing how it will impact them financially."
4133017,kzoofisher,2015-08-16 16:20:00,5144,If late season deals were a common practice I would seriously consider picking my week well in advance and calling six or eight lodges around labor day and price shopping. If I were at a lodge paying full price and the guys next to me got a deal I'd be looking for the same deal in the future.
4103721,Guest,2015-08-04 23:52:00,0,"Hey all! Couple buddies and I were talking and thought of going up to Canada for some walleye's. I have been to the Sioux Lookout area before some years back. Wondering if any one knows of any operations that may have some end of summer deals. Figured I would post here rather than spending hours on the phone with camps. Prefer a fly in with walleyes and pike. Some where north of International Falls would be best, just for our driving. Thanks. Billy"

4103929,SinOrSwim,2015-08-05 06:24:00,1528,Try Fishredpine.com or slatefalls.com Many times those two owners will offer some discounts on fall fishing to fill some spots. Especially if they have groups there and are filling in some gaps. Slatefalls is probably the best outfitter we have ever used. He sold half his cabins and it is fishredpine (that was his before too). We continued for years with them to keep going to North and South Gull. Give em a call. Great camps!!!!
