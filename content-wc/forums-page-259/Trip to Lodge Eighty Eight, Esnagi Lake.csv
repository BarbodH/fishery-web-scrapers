The location initially appealed to us because it is remote, but well serviced by both train and air access. Our host, Terry Politz, was helpful in responding to all of our email enquiries beforehand, so we arrived feeling confident that we had everything we needed. The lake has a healthy population of pike and pickerel (walleye), and even though August may not be the optimal month, we had enough success every day to keep it interesting. There are many healthy reed beds providing excellent pike habitat, and lots of varied structure to attract the pickerel. We booked the services of a guide for a day on the lake, and he took us to a variety of locations that proved productive over the course of our stay. There are also several accessible shore lunch locations that provide shelter and beautiful locations to prepare lunch and take a break. In the past, I have always enjoyed booking housekeeping accommodations (which are available here) but this time I felt that a bit of pampering wouldn't go amiss, so we requested the American Plan. What a great move! From the moment we arrived we were treated to top flight service and a warm, friendly ambiance that left nothing to be desired. (Although we didn't have a housekeeping cabin, I had a peek at some of them, and they are quite roomy and attractive, with all of the conveniences anyone could ask for.) The ladies who provide all of the services, Susan and Maureen, are friendly and cheerful, and leave nothing out. The meals they create put you in mind of traditional home cooking and they never let you leave the table hungry! We found that the boats were comfortable, clean and serviced every morning, and the cabins are well-appointed and spotless. In all, we found that Lodge 88 was an excellent destination, both for the fishing and the accommodations, and we would highly recommend it for individuals, couples or families."
