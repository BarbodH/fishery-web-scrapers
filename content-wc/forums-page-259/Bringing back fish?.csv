4112186,SinOrSwim,2015-08-08 12:55:00,1528,"Familiar whine? Seriously? What is the percentage of fisherman who stay in US resorts and fish in Canada in comparison to the whole industry? half percent? That is probably high. The number of people who stay in the US and actually fish in Canada is such a minuscule drop in your economic bucket. I would venture to guess you probably generate more revenue with the stupid alcohol and tobacco tax crossing the border than the actual number of people staying in a US resort and fishing in Canada. You could also probably make a bigger dent by allowing those criminals with DUI's in vs keeping people from fishing on the Canada side but staying in a US resort. But, how many resorts are there on the US side that even have this opportunity? LOTW, Rainey? Maybe Kabetogama. I agree your management practices are much better. BUt, the flip side is you don't have nearly the same number of people fishing. We don't really have many ""remote"" lakes. If your weather wasn't so harsh, I doubt you would either. Plus, take a look at LOTW. The large portion that is in the US doesn't have people fishing in Canada. That would be one long drive on BIG water to actually get to Canada. Rainey is about the only one. Plus, Kabetogama and the boundary waters are in those parks. They are not over developed."
4112218,SinOrSwim,2015-08-08 13:00:00,1528,"Oh, and your ""pro Canadian"" comes off much more as anti American than it does the other way. So do the snarky little comments from where we currently go. I'm a business owner and I like to thank the people for doing business with me. I appreciate it. But, I can't tell you how many times we have felt like we should be thanking the lodge owner for them allowing us to spend time at their resort. I just wanted to add that because it is not just your comments that make me think this way. It is the way we have been treated over 20 plus years of coming up there. I have had one place sincerely thank me for choosing his lodge. And, he isn't Canadian."
4112234,BreezyPoint,2015-08-08 13:05:00,1581,"A lot of lakes just to add a few: Namakan, Sand Point, Gunflint, Saganaga, Lac La Croix, all the lakes up and down the Minnesota - Canadian border, plus add the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence area. That adds up to a lot of fishing from the U.S.Frank"
4112458,SinOrSwim,2015-08-08 14:49:00,1528,"In the grand scheme of things, what percentage? Plus, those lakes are on both sides. Is the fishing THAT much better on the Canadian side on LOTW???? Close enough to fish, that is. And, please. People are not crossing the Lake Superior to fish on the Canada side. LOL the border is almost right down the middle. Look at google maps. Look how many lakes are ON the border in comparison to how many are in Canada. So, Breezy, answer me this. If you are so worried about the Canadian economy do you buy all your supplies up there? Do you fill your car/truck at the border before you cross so you don't have to pay their fuel prices? OR, do you fill up like the rest of us to avoid buying that stuff in Canada?????? Hurts their economy, right???? It is a ridiculous point. One that doesn't impact him in any way, shape or form. It is an anti-US stance, plain and simple. It doesn't hurt his business. The economic impact is a tiny fraction of the economy from JUST that."
4112634,v-bay gord,2015-08-08 17:15:00,3168,"This seems to be the problem with debating any topic these days. Just label someone as ""unpatriotic"", ""racist"", ""democrat"", ""liberal"", ""socialist""........or in this case ""anti-American"". Your point that a license should be good enough still does not sit well with me. Perhaps you can elaborate on why Canadians should be satisfied with $60 from guests at a US based fishing lodge relying on Canadian resources for their livelihood? Maybe stick with that thought rather than making accusations."
4112658,BreezyPoint,2015-08-08 17:45:00,1581,"I did a little research...the pie along the Canadian border is very large. In the NAFTA case, they said it was in the range of $700M (NY times). It wasn't clear what this included, but I am guessing this is the entire Canadian border.Angle Outpost advertises that if you want a guide, you must buy a Canadian license because that is where the guides fish. My observation after staying there twice, is every boat in camp fished the Canadian side. I didn't see any exceptions. Quite a few in front of Bill Sandy's place that had cabins available. Now if I were Bill Sandy, I would be a little irritated.Ontario has made monumental strides in protecting their fisheries. I understand their sentiment about the resource. There are no places like Ontario, short of Lake Erie that have comparable fisheries.I also stayed at Gord's place for a week this summer. I would hardly use a label like anti-American. He treated us like royalty. To give an example, he saw mud in the back of my boat, put a trailer in the water pulled my boat and cleaned it for me. Service way above and beyond.This summer I will spend four weeks at four different outfitters in Canada and I am treated at each one like a special person.It never fails to amaze me on why Americans think their treatment is poor and we have a right to their resources. I think this attitude is a large part of the reason we are viewed so negatively in the world today.I will continue to reward Canadian businesses for years to come. They have given me some of the best times of my life and they earned it.Frank"

Perhaps they hear lots of demands and complaining from you, like you are currently doing about Canadian policies on this forum. Canadians love Americans, except the very few that spoil it for the rest, the demanding, complaining, arrogant ones, those we can do without. Believe it or not, a lot of Canadians like to fish, we are sharing our bounty with our neighbors to the South, but for that, do at least expect some respect for our system."

LOL Yes, THANKS for ""allowing"" us to come and spend thousands of dollars in your resorts and sharing your bounty. Buying is not the same as sharing for the record.Gotta run. I need to go stimulate the Kansas City economy for the next few days. Hopefully I respect them enough and they will allow me to spend money at their hotels and water parks. Also one, more thing. I'm not complaining about your policies. I made a wise crack about the DUI policy but wasn't complaining. (go back and read what I've written in the past. Have always said you can make whatever rules you want. But, it would be nice to have them applied consistently.....Big difference) Gord IS complaining about the US resorts and over development.

It's much cheaper than going all the way to Canada to catch and keep it. Enjoy fishing for what it is-fishing and fun with those in your group.
4126505,Hawkfan,2015-08-13 23:29:00,237,"Not on the current off topic discussion, but I totally have to disagree with this part here. It seems like 8 out of 10 threads on this site has someone that chimes in with their own my **** don't stink remark. Someone mentions in a thread they had A beer while they fished, people jump all over them because it isn't what they would do. Someone makes an honest mistake on measuring a fish wrong by 1/8"", someone will get all holier-than-thou and chastise them for breaking the law. Someone asks a question about bringing fish home, someone chimes in that if you don't feed the whole family with one filet you're just a fat lazy slob. At times this site can be quite constructive, but other times I don't check it for months because of some of the self-righteous drivel. Don't pin that on one person here either. It's getting slung both ways."
4126649,SinOrSwim,2015-08-14 06:27:00,1528,"I tried to clarify this earlier. Pretty sure I said it was an anti-American STANCE. Not labeling YOU as completely anti American. Again, my point is that law is a tiny tiny drop in your fishing tourism industry bucket. I'm all for conservation. I'd much rather catch and release. I have rarely taken fish home in the 20 plus years of going up. People are putting way too much emphasis on certain areas of my posts. If I had 20 years of bad experiences, I wouldn't go back. Fool me once shame on you............fool me 20 times shame on me. But, I can have a great time fishing etc and that doesn't mean I haven't run into several lodge owners who make me feel that I should be thankful they allowed my presence at their resort. And, quite frankly, this thread proves that point.I'm trying to think back. We go up in September. I will have to ask the group how many times we have been thanked for coming to their lodge at the end of a trip. I know I was with my son earlier in July.I'll leave this alone. Obviously we will agree to disagree."
4126665,v-bay gord,2015-08-14 06:31:00,3168,"I'm getting a little tired of this thread but here's a few thoughts in no particular order. I've been in the lodge business for a few decades, and met many, many lodge owners. I've never met one that was Anti-American......in fact most lodge owners are Americans. Running a lodge is not like selling drugs. You have a relationship with a guest (not a customer) for days at a time. If you don't get the impression that the owner appreciates your business after that amount of time then you either need to do a better job of researching where you go, or you need to look in the mirror (are you an arsehole?). Telling a customer ""Thanks, have a nice day"" at the end of a 20 minute transaction isn't the same as spending a week with a group.......giving them tips, offering them a cold beer, having a few laughs together, etc. Canadian resources should equal Canadian jobs and economy. The present border water situation is dysfunctional..........it is allowing uncontrolled development at the expense of fisheries management, and operations on the Canadian side. This needs to be changed. Walleye Central is still a great place to have discussion on most topics. Obviously we can't agree on all things, but I feel a duty to help educate ""Jackwagon"" Americans like Sin or Swim to see the bigger picture."

Seems he wants to build a floating barricade which allows fish to pass thru to the American side, but won't allow for these now legal fish to immigrate back into the Canadian side. A sort of Doggie Door for fish."
4127825,SinOrSwim,2015-08-14 13:29:00,1528,"LOL you honestly think an independent pharmacy doesn't have a relationship with their customers? We see these same people month after month after month. We know more about them than you will ever know about your guests. We know their kids. We live in the same community as their family. We sponsor their little league teams. You probably do get to know some of your guests. That is great. But, to think you know them better than we know our customers is way off base. Maybe that is how it is in your health system. But, as an independent, we have to work are asses off to keep our customer base.And, I will ask our whole group the last time they remember (over the previous 5 years) being thanked for coming and for choosing their lodge. This is separate than my father son trip in July. He not only thanks us, but has sent follow up emails thanking us. He goes above and beyond the expectations imo. So, I guess he doesn't think we are arse holes or he hides it well. Then again, he is American. :P Actually, it surprises me you would engage in any thread on a divisive topic like this as a lodge owner. I am going to guess there are at least a few people who will never choose your lodge after this. We will never know. There are some that would never go to my pharmacy after this either. But, I doubt many on here are my target audience. This board IS your target audience though. Bet they love you calling people ""jack wagons"", tongue in cheek or not. Especially when other Ontario residents agree they are all great points."
4127921,Guest,2015-08-14 13:57:00,0,"The thought that the person fishing Canadian waters based out of the US and providing no benefit to Canada is, I think, ludicrous. I did that, and continue to do that to this day. However, the first time I did it I wanted more and more. The first experience helped me focus on what I really wanted out of my fishing experience and since that first time, 44 years ago, at least once every year since 1971, I've gone north and stayed with many many lodges and fly in camps. That Canadian experience captured me and wouldn't let go. Let's see, 44 years times say an average of $500 per year (I really think that is low by the way, more like $1000 or more) is hmmm. $22,000. US. No benefit to the Canadians at all because I kept maybe 50 fish that entire time and I know how expensive Canadian fish can be. It was still a deal though."

I'm sure I'm not alone. We are watching! haha That said, I always giggle at the handful(drop in the bucket) of people who think they need to head to Canadian waters of a border lake(Lake Erie in particular) to catch any fish. Its the same lake on both sides of the border. Do we not believe walleye migrate? Sure some people believe that. Which I agree, is a minute part of the American fishing population."
4124417,v-bay gord,2015-08-13 08:02:00,3168,"Glad to hear it's just my 'STANCE"" that is anti American........here's a picture of me doing my anti American STANCE: (by the way you still haven't told us why Canadians should be happy with the $60 license revenue for having US based resorts rely on Canadian resources.....) As far as drug costs, maybe some people think your drug prices are too high......kind of like you think our booze and gas is too high."
4124561,SinOrSwim,2015-08-13 08:37:00,1528,"Because the Canadian economy isn't my interest. I never said you should be happy it is $60. I stated why should we have to stay in a resort just to fish when people are buying the ""required"" license to legally fish? And, yes drugs are cheaper up there. I get that. But, I'm not blaming Canadians for my issues. But, you are blaming America over development for your beef with your government. Also, I used the example of hunting and fishing in the states. People cross the borders all the time to hunt in a different state here. Doesn't mean they have to stay in a resort to hunt. If they live or stay next to the border. They are buying their required license to take whatever game it is they are pursuing. Same as those **** americans crossing into the beloved Canadian waters to fish."
4124617,v-bay gord,2015-08-13 08:56:00,3168,O.K. Now we both agree that the Canadian economy sees no benefit from US based anglers fishing in Canada. Hence I am not happy about it.....and think it should be changed. You may have experienced some anti American sentiment somewhere along the line......seems like it has affected you greatly. However your example of crossing state lines isn't the same as crossing into a different country. The hunting resources of South Dakota belong to everyone in the US. Can't say the same for the fishery in this country. I would like to see resources here create jobs here......not on the Minnesota border.....and at the expense of Canadian based lodges. Seems like logic to me........and has nothing to do with being Anti American.

I said the impact is a tiny fraction of the total dollars for your industry as a whole. maybe some of those people go to Minnesota resorts and realize how much nicer it would be to have some solitude and go to Canada in the future?

You look at us as a necessary evil by ""allowing"" us to pay YOU money to fish on YOUR lakes. We get people in our pharmacy that complain about stuff all the time. But, we still thank them for coming in and buying things from us. I guarantee they don't leave with the belief they are lucky we allowed them to come in and spend their money at our place of business.

There are certainly areas of the Canadian portion which have been overdeveloped.There are certainly areas of the American portion which have been overdeveloped.It perhaps is not productive to claim that one side does more/less good/bad than the other. It is a unique shared watershed that should be prudently managed for the good of all. I don't understand why people think about it in terms of ""sides."""
4126465,Obabikon,2015-08-13 21:38:00,2370,"I, as an American (dual citizen and US resident) am obviously NOT anti-American. Why would I seem ""anti-American"" when I just don't want our resort negatively impacted by people coming across the border from US resorts? If Canada was receiving a large financial benefit, then I would understand why I have to deal with it. However, they are not. So, I will continue push Canadian tourism associations and Politicians to find a good way to resolve the problem. The two walleye per day law is a big deal, and it ONLY exists because of RBC's. In my opinion, if someone wants to use their neighbor's resources, they should abide by their neighbor's rules. Minnesota needs to change their border water limits to be in line with Ontario's. Then it would not negatively impact me or any other ""border waters"" resort. They could adjust our sport licenses to 4 total just like the rest of Ontario. It has nothing to do with being anti-American or pro-Canadian, in my opinion. I'm pro-Obabikon Bay and our guests. I want our guests to have the best possible experience. If I believe ANYTHING or ANYONE is negatively impacting their experience... I am absolutely AGAINST whatever it is. That has nothing to do with where the issue comes from. It has everything to do with protecting and improving the experience that happens here. In my opinion, trying to label a person as ""anti-American"", over a difference of opinion, makes you sound like a bigot. Just because someone doesn't agree with one law, doesn't mean they hate the other country. I get that name calling and insults are normal on the internet, but they aren't typical on this site. I'm sorry you've had 20 years of bad experiences, however, just like all people in all walks of life... there are bad eggs out there. I assure you, that my main concern is ensuring a great trip to the people who bless me with their business."
4113505,Bowtech84,2015-08-09 08:28:00,572,Since its been brought up so many times I'm just curious why it is anybody's fault but Canada's that they allow people from the U.S. side to fish for $60? As long as Canada allows it people are going to do it. Instead of pointless arguing on the internet why don't you put that effort into trying to make that change in your own country. This seems to be the problem with people in general these days. Instead of putting effort into positive change they put that effort into *****ing about it. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
4113513,BreezyPoint,2015-08-09 08:31:00,1581,A free trade argument was brought up as violating NAFTA. This was brought up by Governor Ventura in Minnesota. NAFTA ruled against Ontario and they were compelled to drop their rules requiring outfitting by a Canadian outfitter.I don't know of any way to change that other than renegotiating NAFTA. Ontario deserves some respect for abiding by the agreement despite how harmful it is to their businesses.Frank
4113537,BreezyPoint,2015-08-09 08:38:00,1581,One thing they may be able to do is drop the RABC (remote area border crossing) program. Than require clearance at customs for border crossing each way. That would be something to consider.Frank
4113569,v-bay gord,2015-08-09 09:05:00,3168,That is an excellent suggestion. Something for our associations (and local Member of Parliament) to work on. If that were to happen then you would hear whining like never before........perfect.
4113897,Obabikon,2015-08-09 12:39:00,2370,"Sinorswim, This issue DIRECTLY affects me. My resort is located about 20 miles from the Canadian border. I see US boats regularly. The other issue is, because Minnesotans can cross each day and take their limits, the Canadian side changed to 2 walleye per day and 4 total possession. That only applies to border waters (all of LOTW's). Two per day, no big deal? Eat a shore lunch every day, and still take home fish... it isn't going to happen. I'll go back tonight and read the entire post, but this directly affects every single resort on LOTW's and Rainy Lake... and any other lake that is considered a border waters. For what benefit? A few extra Canadian fishing licenses? If they eliminated remote border crossings, then the revenue created by people staying in Canada to fish Canada would GREATLY over compensate for the loss of the license sales."
4115057,Obabikon,2015-08-09 22:09:00,2370,"As an American resident and dual citizen... this isn't an anti American thing. Its a logical thing. It directly affects 100's of resorts. If they adjusted the ""border waters"" rule... staying at a Canadian resort, the limit should be four, then I wouldn't mind so much. But, as it is... our guests can't take fish home if they cook shore lunches. Four walleye isn't a big deal, but it also isn't a fair situation for them to be in. Other people coming to Canada can still take fish home. The daily limit is a HUGE hindrance. I know your response that ""that's a Canadian law"". Yes, but its a Canadian law, because of the US side coming across. Its designed to keep the total take lower. Minnesota is a mess... heck they just shut down Mille Lacs because of too much harvesting. If people staying/living in Minnesota want to fish Canadian waters, there need to be a better set of rules. Also, they need to start enforcing Canadian Laws and preventing poaching. The real point is that there's a lot of pressure put on Canadian border fisheries, with very little benefit to Canada or its citizens. As I mentioned much earlier, I would be all for getting rid of RBC's all together."
4115177,octanehi5,2015-08-10 04:50:00,1104,"An answer to the original post, You should be able to keep the amount of fish for the side you started and finish on, because you have a fishing lics. for both does not mean you get to keep double the fish. All those border waters have taken a beating. the shutting down of lakes tells that story."
4118185,MorganMan,2015-08-10 22:29:00,341,"The Mille Lacs thing is not just a Minnesota thing. It is a result of old thought processes, maybe like NAFTA? It's a business now. It's interesting how both sides respond to the supply and demand. I spend money in a country that wants it, but depending on where it is, they don't appreciate it. Canadian resorts have a huge resource that we are able to use if we can cross. You offer REMOTE access to lakes that we can't get here. That is the draw really. A real remote vacation with great fishing. We have great fishing in the states, Minnesota for sure. But, when we cross the border and head to camp, it depends on where you go. Either we are welcomed and treated like customers spending money or we are treated like intruders who are lucky enough to spend our money at a place....who really only owns the cabin and shore. I would like to see how the ""American"" owned resorts compare to ""Canadian"" owned resorts pan out. There are many of us that cross the border to fish who obey the laws and DO NOT overfish and hurt the resource, but are treated like outsiders. We do not ask for ANYTHING for the most part, whoever said that, we support ourselves. Going for 22 or 23 years we have seen a variety of things. We don't ask for a lot, but what we want is someone who appreciates the thousands of dollars we spend once a year to get away. My guess, that appreciation will come from a resort or lodge that is run by an American? We will see."

But, you don't see me complaining about the Canada Health System and how you Canadians are impacting my business and our US economy."
4113466,v-bay gord,2015-08-09 08:03:00,3168,"Repeat:This seems to be the problem with debating any topic these days. Just label someone as ""unpatriotic"", ""racist"", ""democrat"", ""liberal"", ""socialist""........or in this case ""anti-American"". Your point that a license should be good enough still does not sit well with me. Perhaps you can elaborate on why Canadians should be satisfied with $60 from guests at a US based fishing lodge relying on Canadian resources for their livelihood? Maybe stick with that thought rather than making accusations."
4106577,SinOrSwim,2015-08-06 06:24:00,1528,"US side, Canada side. The BIG problem I see here are fish crossing the border with NO regard to customs. Build a big wall (in this case net) to keep those US fish on the US side and the Canadian fish on the Canada side. Illegal fish immigration is the next big thing...........you watch."
4108097,Old Timer,2015-08-06 16:44:00,255,"Back to the original question, no you can't keep a Minnesota limit and an Ontario limit, even when you have both licenses. Then, I believe, if you're staying in Minnesota and cross by boat to fish Canada for the day, you can't bring fish back across the imaginary border to where you are staying. I believe you can catch a fish and eat it in Canada, i.e. shore lunch, but nothing comes back across the border. You have to stay in Ontario to keep the Ontario fish. That was the law for a while, and may still be. Fifty years ago I used to fish the Angle, staying in Minnesota and fishing there and in Canada. We always brought home an Ontario limit and a Minnesota limit. I think both licenses allowed six/day and I can't remember if the possession was the same as the daily limit, or twice that. Whatever it was, we took it home. That's what fishermen did. Walleyes were a delicacy that we enjoyed all fall long, as did the friends to whom we gave fish. The double limit was why we fished the Angle. The double limit ended sometime in the 70's - a good thing. And I agree that if you want to fish Ontario you have to stay in Ontario. Only makes sense."
4109969,v-bay gord,2015-08-07 12:27:00,3168,"If the truth is laughable then go ahead and laugh. I would prefer to hear your thoughts on why you think US resorts sending their guests into Canada to catch fish is a financial benefit to Canada. ....and I have to second Obabikon. I'm more than biased though, I'm offended by the US resorts overdevelopment, and their reliance on the Canadian waters to satisfy their guests."
4110185,SinOrSwim,2015-08-07 13:19:00,1528,"Seriously, how many people stay at a US resort and fish in Canada. Rainy and LOTW? You are talking such a tiny little percentage of total people that fish, it's a silly complaint. How far do you think they drive to get a ""scenic"" view? The people catching fish staying in a US resort still buy a Canada fishing license. That is the only thing that really matters. Whether one stays in a US resort is a moot point. Not going to impact either of your resorts. If your resort was on the border, then maybe you have a point. But, when a person buys an outdoors card and a license they are entitled to fish whether they drive in a car for the day or they stay in a resort on teh US side of the border. All the other stuff isn't applicable. If you want more people to stay in your resorts vs the US side, make them more cost effective and don't charge a huge ransom to bring our supplies like beer and tobacco over the border. I find it humorous the two of you are complaining about the US resorts. What percentage of YOUR customer base is from the US compared to your own citizens???"
4110209,BreezyPoint,2015-08-07 13:24:00,1581,"A lot of people cross the border on Lake of the Woods and Rainy Lake for day trips. I have fished out of the Northwest Angle several times and every boat went into Canada every day. And every boat didn't spend a dime at any Canadian business. I am somewhat sympathetic to the argument. Also, from my experience, fishing at a Canadian resort is more cost effective. If I were to go to NW Angle again, I would stay at a Canadian place.Frank"
4110249,SinOrSwim,2015-08-07 13:29:00,1528,"What percentage of people fish in canada staying in a US resort in the grand scheme of the industry? Very small. Plus, if they are so worried about the fish, charge more for a license. Who says someone has to spend money at a Canada business? They aren't doing anything there except fish. So, how many of you fill up with gas before you cross the border? Then, either get back or put just enough to get back across the border? Maybe next time you should fill up in Canada and while your at it buy a weeks worth of groceries before you come back across to ""help the economy"". None of that makes sense either."
4111546,v-bay gord,2015-08-08 08:08:00,3168,"Silly? If the resorts on the US side couldn't fish Canadian waters there would be a significant hit to the tourism industry in Minnesota......both summer and winter seasons. Run that option by them and see if they think it's insignificant. A license is the only thing that matters? How does that figure into the economy of the region? If the license is the solution then I would support a special license for those staying at US resorts and fishing in Canada........let's say $175, with a restricted harvest. That should eliminate the problem. .....and I'm not looking for more business. I just don't like the uncontrolled development on the US side benefiting from proper conservation measures on the Canadian side."
4112010,SinOrSwim,2015-08-08 11:46:00,1528,"This stuff happens both ways. I'm in the drug business. How many people buy drugs from a Canadian pharmacy vs a US pharmacy? The difference? You have a fishing license that is designed to give someone the ability to go fishing. What if you live in Minnesota and come into Iowa to fish or hunt? You don't stay in Iowa. But, the hunting license is all you need. TO HUNT.It's a silly complaint is what I'm saying. The same type of thing happens everywhere in all different industries. At least you are getting the fishing license. People call our pharmacy for ""advice"" all the time. For free. Yet, they don't buy drugs from us. I just find it interesting the anti-US sentiment about things when I have to assume the very large majority of your business is from the US. A few fish and a few customers along the border is a tiny tiny drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of you industry.To be perfectly honest, posts like this make me not want to spend any money in your country. It is clear you don't like the way we run things here. We get the same feeling from some other lodge owners too. Such an anti US mentality that it is really a put off to those of us who do travel and spend thousands to fish for a few days."
4112042,ziggyzag,2015-08-08 12:05:00,125,I agree with SinOrSwim: V-bay gord you seem to think us U.S. citizens do nothing right when it comes to preserving are natural resources you are so wrong. As far as fishing lodges which share waters between the U.S. and Canada it is such a little fraction of Canadian waters being fished its silly on your behalf to mention. NOW what do you think would happen to all the Canadian Outfitters if us Americans stop coming north? You and I both know it would collapse your fishing industry as far as lodges go. I would venture to estimate around 75% of all people going to Canadian Lodges are Americans so treat us with a little respect as we respect our fellow Canadians.
4112074,v-bay gord,2015-08-08 12:11:00,3168,"Anti American? Far from it. I'm ""pro Canadian"". I want to see resources in Canada used to create jobs and economic spin off IN CANADA.......not in another country. It gets really tiring to hear the familiar whine about ""why I'm not going to spend money in Canada"". Join the others fishing Canada but spending their money in the US."
4105457,mr-fish,2015-08-05 15:17:00,58,Never Bring Fish Home .... Over 30 Years ... Saw What Over Fishing Did To The First Lake I Ever Fished In Canada In The Early 60's ...
4105993,MorganMan,2015-08-05 19:49:00,341,"What is wrong with you people? If the law says you can keep fish, you can keep fish. Why would you bash people that keep fish? It is food. One could argue that you are foolish to spend the time trying to catch a fish that you won't eat? Get a life or maybe a church where you can preach your beliefs. So you don't keep fish, why does anyone need to know that? That doesn't answer the question posted. Pat yourself on the back now and go to the grocery store and not buy anything."
4106113,BreezyPoint,2015-08-05 20:29:00,1581,Mr. Morgan Man you should take some reading lessons. No one bashed anyone. If you don't like what others are saying you are welcome to that opinion. In the meantime I will express my opinion as well without the innuendo that you supplied.Frank
4106201,MorganMan,2015-08-05 20:49:00,341,"There was a question asked. You replied with your thoughts that didn't answer the question, but said, nobody should be able to catch and keep fish. Ok, he didn't ask what you thought about what limits should be. Read it again. I did. Your reply is not an answer to the question. When someone posts a question like.....""what do you thing of the walleye limits on (whatever) lake?""......then put your two cents in about not keeping fish."
4106209,Obabikon,2015-08-05 20:55:00,2370,"I'm going to skip morgan's rant, and say that I completely agree with Vbay on this one. The US side did almost ZERO to protect their scenery. Now, they pay almost nothing and come across with little to no financial benefit to Canada. I'd honestly like to see remote crossings done away with. If you'd like to stay in the US... then fish the US. If you'd like to stay in Canada... fish in Canada. Just my 2 cents... and before anyone starts yelling, I am 100% admitting that I am COMPLETELY BIASED."
4106241,MorganMan,2015-08-05 21:00:00,341,"Now I can agree with that. It makes sense, except the part about my RANT! lol. It is germane to the question. Doesn't apply to a whole lot of water, but can be an issue."
4106249,ftfarms,2015-08-05 21:02:00,444,It was answered by the first responder. Don't think he needs everyone to tell him the same answer. I don't like to eat fish;so I can't go fishing? It's the challenge and the fight that I enjoy. You might say if someone goes fishing just for the food thay maybe foolish. You can buy a lot of fish for the money you spend fishing. There's several ways to look at all of this. Why does it strike a nerve too you that some don't keep fish? This could go on and on
4106265,MorganMan,2015-08-05 21:06:00,341,Its wasn't an answer to the question asked. That's all. Start a thread about how you love walleye and want to keep them safe by not fishing for them and the hooks hurt their mouths....blah blah blah.
4106281,MorganMan,2015-08-05 21:35:00,341,"Really not a rant, just a reply that says the question was not answered. You owners usually have the rants. I agree with what you said. I replied to the answers being offered to the questions. Agree or don't, not a rant."
4106289,MorganMan,2015-08-05 21:36:00,341,No financial benefit to Canada? That is laughable.
4100225,Little Pine,2015-08-03 23:41:00,26,"We are going to be fishing Lake of the Woods, and will have a MN and Canada license. Plan on fishing both sides. We are staying in the NW Angle and boating into Canada. My question is when we leave can I have my limit from both MN and Canada when I cross the boarder? I called my local CO, and he was not sure. Anyone know the answer? Thanks"
4100345,Obabikon,2015-08-04 05:43:00,2370,"No. You can't have both limits (10 walleye in possession is illegal in both areas). Since an officer can't determine where you caught these fish, he will go by the rules of his state/province."
4103673,Aspencreek,2015-08-04 22:33:00,2911,"I know it's better to ask than assume, but really!! Did you really think that would be OK??"
4103689,Little Pine,2015-08-04 22:39:00,26,It would be nice being that you are paying for the extra license. Its worth the extra money just to fish the canada side.
4104385,v-bay gord,2015-08-05 08:28:00,3168,In a perfect world the limit should be ZERO for those staying at a U.S. based outfitter and fishing in Canada.
4104393,SinOrSwim,2015-08-05 08:30:00,1528,"Why is that? Just curious. If fishing in Canada and buying a Canada license what does it matter? You can bring the same number across the border after staying at a Canadian resort. So, what does it matter where you are staying? In theory, Canada is getting the license fee and those fish counting toward the limit could be coming from the US side."
4104489,BreezyPoint,2015-08-05 08:56:00,1581,I think the take home limit should be 0 for everyone!Frank
4104577,v-bay gord,2015-08-05 09:48:00,3168,There is no economic benefit to Canada by resorts on the US side sending their guests into Canada for the day to catch fish. License fees are trivial compared to the actual spin-off from tourism. The US side has been overdeveloped but relies on the good fishing and undeveloped scenery on the Canadian side.
4104825,ftfarms,2015-08-05 11:09:00,444,Im with you breezy. I haven't brought fish home since 2005. Never the same at home and not worth the hassle. Shoot we haven't ate fish in Canada in three years. We don't stop for lunch and dont get in till after dark. Sometimes I wonder about us??
4105057,BreezyPoint,2015-08-05 12:32:00,1581,"You're OK. I do occasionally bring back fish, but usually only two and that is predicated on a visit from my daughter shortly after my return. I do eat two meals a week and that is only two smaller fish for my wife and I. Nothing wrong with us. I wouldn't care a bit if they restricted take home fish. I like the new LOTW reg that says no northern over 29.5 inches. No need to take a big spawning trophy these days.Frank"
