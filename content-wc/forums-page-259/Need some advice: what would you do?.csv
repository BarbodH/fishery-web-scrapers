Younger than me. Due to rare disease he has Very bad balance. Was a full time job in the boat. Did some work on the boat to make things easier for him. Camp owner gave us exclusive use of his Polaris to go to and from the dock and cabin all week. Was a lot of work...........every day, all day, for 7 days. I pray to God I get to do it again next year.............I guarantee he'd do the same for me. Just be perpared. Good luck what ever you decide.I'll be praying right along with you, birddogger. Hope you get your chance."

4132505,zeebee,2015-08-16 12:18:00,1144,if he were to die.....lay him on his stomach.....voila ... instant rod holderwonder if he still counts for fish limits??????
4132977,kzoofisher,2015-08-16 16:05:00,5144,If he is single with no kids I would have a face to face with him and be absolutely frank about the likely delays in getting medical help. If he has a wife and/or kids I would make sure they are involved in the conversation. His life is his own I suppose but the consequences of his actions will be left to the living. Doing a different trip to a less remote place seems like the best compromise.
4133217,wmd,2015-08-16 18:30:00,388,"Doing another trip isn't in the equation. There are 5 other people involved to say nothing of the $1200 deposit that would be lost. He is divorced but has kids and grandkids, if something should happen he would be happy it happened in Canada. wmd"
4133345,LOW1,2015-08-16 19:21:00,2828,"Take him. He may be needed to carry your own carcass back.Seriously, it sounds like the question is one of inconvenience to you more than medical risk to him. Your choice-take him or else leave him home if, after a lengthy friendship, you value your convenience more than the friendship. That's the choice you have. Perhaps another way of looking at it would be to ask what you would want done if you were in his shoes."

4134873,youngknight,2015-08-17 09:30:00,228,"I wonder what kind of communications you have if something does go wrong. I have considered taking my 81 year old father and thought of what to do in an emergency. I have a ""Spot ME"" device for work that relies on satellites to send out signals - for work - which I could use...I take it anyhow. 1 year subscription is $99 and the unit is about the same. However, if I didn't have it and only needed something once or twice I would rent a satellite phone. Good for piece of mind to get a plane to fly in if there is a major issue. [In the end, didn't take my dad, his knees can't take very long in a small boat and although he would like to go, it was he who made the decision that he would not go - I'm making other arrangements for a salmon fishing trip in my large boat with comfortable seats.] The convenience or work getting your buddy to the camp, to the boat, back to the camp, to the outhouse...etc...well, lots of variables there to know how doable that is. A hunting buddy of mine took a close friend with ALS (Lou Gerhigs disease) deer hunting one year. It was a huge chore and certainly my buddy never got a deer himself, never got the solitude that he enjoys while one watch, but he will remember that deer season more than any other...his friend has long since passed away but the joy in his eyes on his last hunt...much brighter than the biggest of bucks. Lastly, on the morbid humorous side, my volunteer fire department got a call some years ago about a moose hunter who had a heart attack. We went back in the bush and found that his buddy found him dead and wanted to take him out of the bush so strapped him on the back rack of his ATV with his legs hanging over the side. the rear wheel would kick the dead guy's feet kicking them up in the air then coming back down then kicking again...over and over again. A passing log truck saw this and stopped and advised the ATV fellow that calling the police and not moving the dead body further was the appropriate thing to do. There's gotta be a Jeff Foxworthy ""you know you're a redneck..."" opportunity to be had there."
4135697,forgop,2015-08-17 14:31:00,880,"I see people almost every day at work who are non-compliant with their diabetes and I hate it. I feel bad for those who get diabetes, but it's hard for me to feel sorry for those who choose not to manage their condition because the risks of doing so are well known. Vision problems, skin infections leading to amputations, neuropathy, kidney failure, peripheral vascular disease and hypertension are the results and it's their friends and family that suffer the consequences. Personally, I'd err on making him stay home unless he is fully capable of carrying the same workload as everyone else. I guess I'm just jaded about people not being compliant about their health and I reap the rewards of seeing patients in their 20's and 30's who think diabetes is a game, all while they've already had amputations at that point in their lives."
4136729,law57,2015-08-17 20:24:00,1147,Tough love - but I agree. Friendship is a two way street. I'd say your friend takes up both lanes. The decision is yours - and your trip mates. If you are willing to take the chances and put up with the potentials - fine. If you don't feel up to the responsibilities - tell your 'friend' so. Be honest with him. He's asking you for a very big favor. The post (above) about not managing his condition is true. And it's a very selfish position for him. He puts everyone else in a bad situation. Your decision - but you don't owe him a trip in his condition.
4136881,birddogger,2015-08-17 21:16:00,43,"Post of the year.My best buddy is in the hospital tonight,I'm praying he can go on our 31st annual fall trip in late September........"
4130153,wmd,2015-08-15 09:20:00,388,"We are leaving for Canada in about a month. I have a friend going that has had some severe health issues this year and still wants to go with us. He has been going with us since 1986, not every year but probably 18-20 times. He is a diabetic, he has done a better job of taking care of himself and eating better the last 6 months or so, but is prone to not doing so on these trips. However the biggest problem is he had a staph infection in both knees, shoulders and 1 elbow this winter. He had surgery at least twice on the joints and was hospitalized for 2 plus months. He walks with a cane now, came from someone else not him, and has balance issues. We live about 600 miles apart so I haven't seen him in 2 years but talk regularly on the phone. My biggest fear is his mobility on rough terrain and his falling on land or possibly into the water. We go to a boat in lodge so there is a 400 yard portage to get to the lodge. I am willing to do what is necessary to deal with these issues but do have a fear something bad could happen to him, as you know help can be a long ways away up there. We are long time friends and I don't want to lose a friendship over this. I have talked to his brother and he told me he should not be going but will not listen to him or anyone else about it. He is stubborn, as many of us are at our age, he is 62 and I don't think he has thought this thru very well. How would you handle this? Thanks wmd"
4130169,Golden Eagle,2015-08-15 09:32:00,2642,"Is a 4wheeler available to get him over the 400 yard portage? Another camp could be better suited for your friend. Maybe you could make a second trip and take your friend to great fishing, but easier for your friend."
4130265,jfaisten,2015-08-15 10:15:00,1060,yep -- I'd change the trip so it's easier on your friend and take him never know how many trips we have left .....
4130329,Oldschool,2015-08-15 10:26:00,163,"Your friend is the one that needs to decide whether the risks are acceptable, or not. It is your responsibility to be up front with him about those risks and explain to him your concerns about your part in all of this. If you can handle your concerns, and are willing to do so, he has to be the final decision-maker. He may not care a bit if this would be his undoing, and as long as you can handle any eventuality, then let it happen. If you cannot be placed into that difficult position, then only you can decide what happens. I don't believe that such a conversation can be held on the phone. You need to look each other in the eyes and seek some level of comfort with each other; whatever the outcome. This may very well be an end-of-life decision, and it needs that kind of earnest conversation. Having been in this exact situation, albeit with a family member, he went to Canada. I thought that I owed him the right to make that decision. It turns out that all went well, with some modifications to our daily schedule, etc., and we all came away with some of our best memories of any of our trips to Canada. Honestly, if he would have succumbed to health issues while there, it would have been unbelievably difficult for us that took him, but looking back, it would still have been the right thing to do. Other family members were not so happy with us for taking him, but I really don't believe that their opinions mattered. I can't say that such is usually the case, but the more serious the possible outcome, the more personal the decision becomes. Good luck. I wish you the best in whatever decision you feel compelled to make."
4130473,fishron,2015-08-15 11:26:00,317,"We recently returned from a late June fly-in. Two weeks after, one of our dear friends and fishing buddy that was on the trip with us succumbed to a heart attack. Our outfitter has us on a good evacuation plan by helicopter. If it had happened on the trip, certain decisions would have to be made by non family friends. As it turned out he was with his family at the Delaware shore and although heroic actions failed, he was with his family and the ones who should be making the calls. It's a tough call. No one knows when the big one comes or some other life threatening situation occurs. I kid my wife that I want it to happen as I'm making a big cast into the surf trying to reach those way out breaking fish and I fall forward and the tide takes me out. Selfishly, you think of the jeopardy to the trip you've planned for. In our case there would have been a lingering feeling of guilt for a long time. You would hope a friend that recognizes a very real danger would not put you in that situation. Good luck and I hope it works out for you."
4131769,SinOrSwim,2015-08-16 07:05:00,1528,"Agree with those that say it is his choice. Maybe just have a conversation and ask if he is SURE he wants to do this and explain the difficulties you wrote about in your post? Then, make sure you have the ability to contact the outfitter to get you out if needed."
4131977,bigcreekdad,2015-08-16 08:12:00,74,"Very tough situation. How many others are going, and are they aware of the issues? If so, how do they feel? In an emergency, are you and/or lodge owners able to get him to a hospital? Several posters have said you should honor his wish to go. I don't think it is that straightforward. Is he adding way to much stress to you and the others? If so, doesn't that have some bearing on the issue? I agree with a prior poster who said a face to face is in order. You need to see him and how he is doing physically, and have a heart to heart talk with him. Then make your decision."

My dad's good friend Ralph who has been a part of our group from the very start, had a very serious health scare. His doctor cautioned him from making the trip, yet Ralph would have none of it. Ralph and dad had a heart to heart talk. It was decided by all on the trip that if it was Ralph's time to go, it was his time to go and the place he would want to die if God's will. He told us all that if he were to pass away, to store his body schell in a cool cove till the plane comes. Not to feel bad, but to rejoice in his life. He didn't pass on the trip, but it wasn't long afterward. RIP Ralph. May the Lord take me doing what I love most in life."
