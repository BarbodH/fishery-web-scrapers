4135745,Andyeye,2015-08-17 14:51:00,179,"Returned Saturday from Cedar Lake. Walleye fishing was slow the first couple of days but improved a little as the week went by. We caught walleyes in water 6' deep down to over 25' with no real set pattern. Our best bite was Thursday mid-morning and just before dark with slip bobbers in 13' of water with a good west wind blowing. These fish were on the edge of a reef that tops out about 6'. We did very well on crappies vertical jigging over the top of them in anywhere from 15' out to 22' of water. We could see them on the Humminbird and I just hit the spot lock on my Terrova and it worked well. Our biggest fish of the week was 24"" and my nephew got a 17"" crappie trolling a crankbait. Good Luck to those still going this season."

4136129,tm2,2015-08-17 16:54:00,5,Heading up there in two weeks. would you mind sharing the type of areas you were finding the crappie? We have a caught a few off of gull island fishing for walleye. thanks
4136857,Rich B,2015-08-17 21:02:00,1081,"Andy, Glad to hear you had a good week up at Cedar, and the fishing was decent for you guys. Did you get into any Pike or Musky of any size ? My wife and I will be up over the Labor Day week (she has never been with me to NW Ontario though has fished with me north of the Soo).....hoping for a good week of decent temps for the weather (no snow storms - ha)....will see what happens, and we will have a fun time in any event. My friends and I will be back up to CPR for the '16 Opener....that's a fun week. Faith, Family, Friends.....and fishing, Rich B"
4140793,Andyeye,2015-08-19 06:24:00,179,"We caught our crappies mainly in the south side of the bay going into Peephole Lake before you go through the narrows into Peephole. We also got a few big ones north Gull Island where a sunken tree limb is sticking out of the water. This limb is out there at least a quarter mile north of Gull Island from about the middle of the island. Not lots of them there but they were 13"" fish. It is 28' to 29' where we caught them there and we also picked up some walleyes in that spot. We did well on them with 2"" Tennesee Shad tails and chartruese 2"" paddle tail minnows. The 1/16 jigs worked if you could stay vertical. I caught 3 walleyes over 20"" and several eaters with this presentation. Rich, I hope you have a great trip up there and I hope all is well with you. I hope Mr. Krecja does well too and all of you guys have a safe and fun trip. Sorry it took a day or two to reply I had to have some blood work done about my diabetes and I was tied up with that. All came out okay but I'm supposed to lose 5 to 10 lbs. That is probably about how much I gained up there eating as much fresh fish as I did."

4141137,Andyeye,2015-08-19 08:09:00,179,"Bill, sorry about the spelling I work with lot of Czechs that I kid about having to buy a vowel to spell there name. I forgot to tell Rich we did not get into any Muskies but I really never even tried. A guy and his sons from Wisconsin were in our camp and they had boated 5 by Friday AM with the biggest in the Mid 40s. Our biggest Northern was a 35"" one that my nephew got trolling crankbaits at dusk. I had never got in to the crappies at Cedar Lake but this was only my second trip there. It was a learning experience and lots of fun too. They looked like walleyes laying on the bottom or just above it with my depth finder and we just moved around in the areas I talked about and got them."
