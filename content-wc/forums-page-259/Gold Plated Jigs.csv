4124353,RCDuck,2015-08-13 07:37:00,18,PM sent.... Very generous of you!
4124809,milfish,2015-08-13 10:15:00,249,I agree. Use strobe jigs from JB lures almost always when fishing Lac Seul is September.
4128761,Mike Kansas,2015-08-14 18:25:00,1463,Did I read that right $1.19 per jig?
4131897,Shotgun,2015-08-16 07:51:00,759,"Returned yesterday from Lac Seul. Tried some gold jigs with no success. Caught the majority of our fish with a JB snell silver and/or gold spinners with minnows in 12 to 22 fow. Did reasonably well with multi colored 1/8 green based jigs bouncing off bottom. Several days hot no wind was tough fishing. MNR checking many boats. One group received a lecture about filling their cooler with fish with in one tenth inch of legal limit. MNR felt that hurts reproduction even when it is legal, they prefer you taking the smaller 15 to 17 inch fish. We were checked had one 15 incher at that time had auto inflate life jackets on which he commented on he likes to see and I think that helped set the stage for the inspection, overall treated us very well. Older mnr officer was training a younger officer. Nephew was jacking around using a worm rig and put three year yellow grubs on it bouncing it off the bottom. Pulled in a 29 3/4 inch walleye. Biggest problem was coming home south of Ear Falls road work. They had ground up the road and then watering it. The road tar/old base material was all over my truck and boat. Just a mess, had to use a semi washer to clean it up. Just seems like there would be another way vs. subjecting vehicles to this. One guy was on a motorcycle headed that way, I'm sure he would of had a total mess let alone the safety of riding over piled up road material 12 inches high."

4121577,Bill Krejca,2015-08-12 07:06:00,6107,I like the gold and silver jig heads for making tied jigs using a variety of other flash materials. Work great for everything from crappies to walleyes. Sometimes I trim the material short and add either a Gulp minnow or live minnow. Walmart carries a variety of different size heads in the Cedar Rapids area. Bill
4122129,iowaeyes,2015-08-12 09:56:00,13,I finally found some at Cabelas in Owatonna . Northland has been back ordered for months. My Favorite color of jig!
4122745,RCDuck,2015-08-12 14:31:00,18,"Ha Ha... I was going to say... ""I had great luck with some Gold Glitter jigs this year, and I thought I got them from a guy named Mike from Kansas?"""
4122825,adempsey,2015-08-12 14:59:00,963,Only 24K with 1 Carat diamond eye will do for my fishing.
4122849,Mike Kansas,2015-08-12 15:05:00,1463,"Yes you did and I thank you for that and I'm glad you had good luck with them. Right now I'm looking at adding Gold Plated and Silver Plated and I'm trying to get some feedback before I make the investment. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
4122857,Knoxabilly,2015-08-12 15:05:00,225,^^^ That one lands the Big females though!
4122889,Mike Kansas,2015-08-12 15:07:00,1463,"YOU ARE THE MAN....I have two of those in my basement. When I get your blank check I will send them to you!!! Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
4122913,RCDuck,2015-08-12 15:11:00,18,"In that case, if you have some gold-plated jigs in addition to the gold glitter ones, I'd try those too... I've had good luck in the past with gold plated whistler jigs.For what it's worth, my 12 year-old daughter picked out the gold glitter jig the first day out this year for me to tie on to her line. She fished with that 1 jig for three full days before getting cut off by a northern, but not before landing over 120 fish on it."
4123145,Mike Kansas,2015-08-12 16:48:00,1463,"WOW...Hats off to your Daughter. She obviously has the touch to put the jig in the fish's mouth while keeping it out of the rocks. It's always awesome for me to hear about fisherman's success especially with one of my jigs. Please Private Message me your address and your Daughters name and I will send her some Gold Plated when I get them done. Thanks, Mike Kansas"

4119121,Mike Kansas,2015-08-11 09:00:00,1463,"Does anybody use Gold Plated Jigs in Canada. If so where do you get them ? Thanks, Mike Kansas"
4119225,Bitinlight,2015-08-11 09:24:00,95,Yes. I use gold and silver plated jigs. Get them at Cabela's.

4120257,Bassmandpe,2015-08-11 14:05:00,42,"Purchased them at Frank's in Linwood, Mi. Tried them several years ago and caught Pike after Pike on them, few Walleyes. Gave up and went back to original colors."
4121073,Knoxabilly,2015-08-11 20:42:00,225,"Love them, one of my go-to jigs. I ordered them from Cabelas"
4121137,johnboat,2015-08-11 21:27:00,2014,Scheels has them to. Good color plus you don't have to dig the paint out of the eyelet.
4121257,Ndstallmann,2015-08-11 23:04:00,549,Hammered gold jigs from JB lures are the ticket.under summer fishing heading bottom of page called strobe jig.( their web sight is the easy to navigate) but very friendly company.
