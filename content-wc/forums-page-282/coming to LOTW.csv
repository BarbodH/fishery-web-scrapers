Just exercise some caution when out on the pond, launching your boat may also prove to be fun as ramps aIcanre out of the water. Ice out on north end as of May 4th. I won't tell you where the ""eyes "" are hiding that would be too easy, ha,ha. happy angling"
3857161,freespoolin,2015-05-10 15:37:00,472,How much flow is there in the Winnipeg River system? We usually start the season at Perch Bay on the River and our experience is that the more flow the better. Thanks.
3857193,Obabikon,2015-05-10 15:59:00,2370,Freespoolin... right now there should be almost none. They better have the dam as close to completely closed as possible in order to hold water.

And that's if your dock is even in the water. Some of the MNR guys are saying its a 50 year low."
3858561,wiggle,2015-05-11 05:34:00,400,"I was on LOTW east of Sioux Narrows a week ago, I figured the water was 4'-5' below normal. Could that be possible versus 1-2' low in Kenora??? Thanks, Brad"
3858969,deadhead1,2015-05-11 07:37:00,193,LOW is at 15% percentile and Winnipeg River is at 10%. I went for a 1 hour lake tour on the weekend and I would say not a big deal once you are on the lake but can see lots of floating docks sitting on mud and many boat lifts that won't get low enough to get a boat on or off. It is kind of neat to see rocks sticking out in places they where hidden. I was more careful than normal and took a wide route around reefs and islands. My own boat lift is too shallow to use and when I tied my boat up to the dock it could go right under it. Not real easy to get in and out of the boat either!
3859001,Redline,2015-05-11 07:41:00,73,"Looks like a lot of rain this coming week. Maybe that will help things. Crazy because last June when I was there, water was 4' above normal!"
3859233,Obabikon,2015-05-11 08:31:00,2370,"No... that much of a difference is not possible from Sioux Narrows to Kenora. The entire lake is probably in the range of 2 feet low. (plus or minus maybe 6 inches) However, after it being 4' high last year, it looks pretty bad."
