3862921,bigwalleye1,2015-05-12 06:23:00,2632,"I've thought about a Snoopy pole contest. We're mainly jig fishermen, and I think jigging with a Snoopy pole would be a hoot. Thinking everybody gets the same pole, no line changes, no ""speed parts"" like swivels, no modifications. Biggest fish in a two hour stretch for $10 each."
3862993,pjshorthorn,2015-05-12 06:38:00,5654,NICE!!!! The person that gets skunked or has the smallest fish in the contest could wear the pink Viking helmet for the next day of fishing PjShorthorn
3863345,Draco1206,2015-05-12 07:35:00,175,"That's pretty much what we do. Two hour tournament, with total length of two walleyes. Jigs only. Last year I snapped my pole of right at the base so for an hour or so I was fishing with just the reel attached to the butt. Hard enough to set the hook with a Barbie pole that's not broken, nearly impossible with a broken rod. We've landed pike up to 32"" and 22"" walleyes on these rods though. It's a ton of fun. One thing we also require is that each angler must where their Barbie sunglasses and use the Barbie tackle box while they are fishing. There is a 2"" penalty for being caught fishing without the Barbie sunglasses. Also teammates must hold hands with all their Barbie gear for pictures, to be used as blackmail for anyone that breaks the ""golden rule"". ""What happens in Canada, Stays in Canada""."
3863809,pwbmlr,2015-05-12 09:07:00,37,"I am the ring leader for our group every year. What I do is a few simple and fun contest each year. We start off right after we land and get settled everyone grabs their favorite rod and lure and we have a contest from the dock to see who catches the first fish. Winner gets a grab bag of lures, jigs, slip bobbers, gulp... Then we have a contest for the biggest walleye and biggest pike for the week. It is simple and the guys go nuts over it. All I do is budget $50.00 for the group for prizes. I throughout the winter I just keep an eye out on Cabela's Bargain Cave via online. I can usually get 2-3 hats, a few cabela t shirts and all the grab bag lures for well under the $50.00"
3864017,labsrus,2015-05-12 10:20:00,557,"Our group has done a different type of contest We fish for Pike, the lakes we head to have lots of 25 to 30 inch fish We only keep a couple for a meal But C and R all day long You can claim 2 fish each day Once you claim 2 fish you are stuck with what you have For example you catch a 28 inch fish and claim it prior to releasing it Then later you catch another fish same size and claim it, your total for the day is 56. After you claim your 2 fish, even if you catch a larger fish you are done. Makes for some interesting decisions. Dinner time is the cut off Might claim an early fish, of 27 then catch bunch more in the 27 to 30 inch range hoping to land a larger fish but never claim one. When it gets to to 4:30 and you are looking at only 27 total and smaller 20 inch fish looks pretty good if you can catch one. Have had a lot of fun with this one over our many trips"
3858857,maddogg,2015-05-11 07:15:00,178,"Propack, how often do you fall for that?"
3858961,buckeyedan,2015-05-11 07:37:00,44,"Three biggest walleye for the week, total inches. It's not something that everyone takes really seriously but we're a competitive lot, so it's fun. Everyone chips in $20 and the winner gets the cash. Easy to keep track of and being the ""angler of the year"" is always a fun bragging point."
3860473,LOW1,2015-05-11 12:44:00,2828,We have kids that almost always go and I therefore have a contest that starts on the drive up. $5.00 cdn to whoever spots the first live chicken. Not that many around in public view anymore.
3860945,bcmss396,2015-05-11 14:53:00,296,"We do a mini-contest with the kids. $1 Loonie per species (Walleye, Northern and Smallie) for the first and largest each day. This runs for the duration of the trip and they can use the money for s souvenir at the end. Lots of fun to pull out the old records and talk about previous catches. Blair"
3861049,Blue Fin,2015-05-11 15:15:00,47,"Our core group has been going up to Canada since the late 90's. We wanted to have a tourney for bragging reasons and to keep everyone engaged in the week (some guys don't like to fish as much as the others). We mainly walleye fish and the points are weighed toward walleyes a bit more as a result. For each walleye over 20 inches, it is worth 2 points. For each pike over 32, it is worth 1 point. We then have bonus points for the week: Walleyes are 10, 7 and 5 for the biggest three for the week and pike are 3, 2 and 1. It is fun to have the bonus points as this gives everyone that chance at some last day heroics if they can land a big eye. We also have a vest with past champs on it, and the daily leader, gets to wear the vest the next day. Much like the yellow jersey in Tour d France.Now, this has been a lot of fun over the years to track how many big fish we have caught each week and how many times guys have finished where they have. BUT, it seems like the tourney has taken away from some of the relaxation that this trip should be about. Maybe we are all just finally growing up, but we all have kids and don't have the stamina to fish or drink like we use to. Don't get me wrong, we had a blast at the beginning, but as the years have passed, so has the energy level. This year, we are going for more of a relaxed contest. Ryder Cup format for those golf fans out there. We are going to have 3 teams of 3. Have daily points from each boat based off of biggest walleye/northern for the day. Strategies in matchups and so on. It should be fun. We will have each guy throw $20 in like usual and payout the top team this year.I have seen all of your posts on this and I can agree with all of them. At this point in my life, I would rather just go up and enjoy the fresh air while setting some hooks with my buddies. The past was fish 18 hours a day and drink too much. That was fun for a while, but priorities change as your life goes on. Sorry for the long post, but this one hit alot of topics of discussion from our group over the past few years.Good luck to all!"
3861153,buckeyedan,2015-05-11 15:41:00,44,"Can definitely relate to all of this. A little contest is fun just for bragging rights, but as I get older I'm not sure how much longer we will do it...especially for the first few years the kids are along and we are showing them the ropes. For quite a few years our schedule was up at 5:00am, fish all morning, a short break for brunch, fish until mid afternoon, catch a quick nap, back out by 4-5:00pm, fish until dark, eat and drink until 1-2am, do it all again the next day. That's a total blast when you're in your 20's and bulletproof, but not as much when you get to be on the wrong side of 35. We still fish hard, but the mornings aren't quite as early and the nights aren't quite as late as they used to be... ""Fish smarter, not harder"" is starting to be my motto..."
3861777,camp chef,2015-05-11 18:25:00,915,"We don't like to look at fishing as a competition. To each their own. We do, however have a heated cribbage tournament all week long to determine who buys dinner on the way home from Canada."
3862129,johnboat,2015-05-11 20:00:00,2014,"10 bucks each largest walleye and pike for the week....Inches Anyone who catches a teenie tiny walleye has to use my Ron Popeal Pocket Fisherman off the dock that evening until he catches a freezer fish while the group watches with a cold one in their hand! Dang, I HATE doing that. lol"
3862145,wiwalleyefreak,2015-05-11 20:03:00,25,"Saw this thread last night. Had to respond. My group typically stays at outpost cabins and we play a different game. We have the typical fishing pool (first, most and biggest) but the real fun is catching the critters(mice). Five bucks a night, bring a trap with your name on it, winner takes all....two tie all tie rolls over to the next night. Makes for a lot of laughs and helps one sleep at night knowing you are getting rid of the critters. Ever see a 270 pound man jump up on a couch and scream like a girl? It amazes me how afraid some of these guys are of mice yet have no trouble wrapping their hands around a big pike."
3862193,jaximus,2015-05-11 20:06:00,117,"we do a few mini contests and then one for the week. we do a week long canoe trip and we 'rough it.' if it doesnt fit in a backpack and isnt your paddle/rod, you cant bring it. we have a wall hanging trophy with a picture frame that holds the picture of the 'fish of the week' and gets to stay with the winner for the year. its usually the biggest lake trout unless someone gets a monster pike or walleye. there are only 4 of us, so we do a 'catch it you dont have to clean it' thing everyday. being that whoever caught it 'provided' the food, they shouldnt have to clean it. we also keep meticulous records of lake trout catches as they are harder to catch and we love eating them. we have an excel spreadsheet of every lake trout we caught dating back to our first trip in 2006. we note time of day, wind speed/direction, sun, depth of lure, lure color, size of fish, lure size/shape. you name it, we keep track. its pretty neat the patterns that we notice. we also account for our personal tendencies by having a record of what we use color/size/shape wise. everyone has their favorite colors/lures after all. we also have mini contests for who gets the first grand slam (lake trout/walleye/pike/bass), grand slam on a single lure, and most single lure grand slams. no money on the line. i also occasionally pick up a 'group lure' when i find a bunch of matching ones at a price i can afford. then we have a contest on who gets the first first, then first grand slam on that lure."
3855753,Pooch,2015-05-10 07:11:00,4619,"Our fall LS group has a traveling trophy for largest walleye of the trip. Not a big deal, but makes for a little good jesting around the dinner table. This was a carryover from our original (Ray passed away three years ago) trip organizer who had a home made trophy he made out of an old golf trophy from ""way back when"". It was ugly, but everyone coveted it because Ray made it.Any more competition than that and it becomes a job and no longer fun. Every group has their own ""thing"" so who really cares, as long as it doesn't involve killing a big fish to win a stupid bet.Pooch"
3856209,John N,2015-05-10 09:04:00,362,"We have a pretty small wager going, but it's fun for the bragging rights.1. Guy with the biggest walleye each day wins $1 from everyone else - that's a daily skin.2. Biggest northern each day, same thing.3. Biggest walleye for the week, same thing.4. Biggest northern for the week, same thing.5. And then the team bait.... many years ago, one of our group furnished Daredevils with a Canadian Maple Leaf pattern to everyone - so that led to two new skins - big walleye for the week on the team bait, and big northern for the week on the team bait. This fellow has generously furnished ""team baits"" to everyone for many years now - new/different spoon each year.So - on our five day trip, there is a total of fourteen skins available. The ""accounting"" for this is kept daily, and we settle up at the end of the last day. As part of this, our accountant has records of all the northerns over thirty inches over the years, and all the big walleyes. Kind of fun to hear the history once in a while.John"
3856241,rnnonmt,2015-05-10 09:10:00,992,The Team Bait sounds cool!
3856297,Mike Borger,2015-05-10 09:34:00,1554,Have never made wagers - with one exception. When there's young kids involved I'll usually put a tackle package together (lures and other odds and ends). Kid who catches the largest fish of the trip wins it. It tends to keep them more focused and interested and we have a lot of fun with it.First trip coming up soon to Brace Lake will be 3 different dads and our 8-9 year old sons. Should be a ton of fun.
3856625,Richard B,2015-05-10 10:56:00,735,We do our bets a little different. Big fish of the day has to wash all the dishes the next day. Next biggest has to cook dinner. 3rd biggest lunch and 4th breakfast! If one individual wins all 4 they have to do everything. It's different but it usually even outs throughout the entire week.
3856657,kzoofisher,2015-05-10 11:06:00,5144,"I like that. We have a rule when we float the river throwing streamers for big browns; catch a fish over 20"" and it's your turn on the oars. We get more flexible when everybody has one over 20 already but those days are rare."
3856945,NARDA 1,2015-05-10 13:43:00,636,"Sounds like a good idea!!!Should be at the lodge Thursday before noon, see you guys then."
3857177,bigwalleye1,2015-05-10 15:54:00,2632,"The other boat in my 4 man two boat trip in the spring is not known to really "" light em up "", shall we say. My boat partner and I play ""over and under"" to bet on how many fish they'll have for shore lunch, or for dinner if fish is on the menu. Basic premise is this, and we alternate days. I pick the maximum number of fish I expect them to have, or what I believe they're capable of. If I choose 2, for example, my boat partner chooses ""over"" or ""under"". The bet is $5. In the example, if he chooses ""over"", the total needs to be over 2. We then inquire how many fish in the other boat dead well. If they have up to and including 2, I win, otherwise he wins. To guess over, the total needs to actually be over, under the same way. I choose two, he chooses under, he's a winner at 0 and 1. Seems like 1 is the safe bet. Chances of theses two actually being able to connect with two decent walleye in a morning is rather unlikely.Part of this depends on the other boats lack of success, but if they're happy going all the way to Canada to keep 1 fish for shore lunch and expect us to feed them, I guess, so be it."
3857537,packpro,2015-05-10 18:13:00,695,Guy in the front of the boat says $5.00-next fish. As soon as I agree to the wager. He lifts the one that was quietly on the line when he proposed the bet.
3858793,MrSimon,2015-05-11 07:05:00,922,"We've never wagered any money, but we do have two trophies. Biggest fish trophy: A fishing shirt. Each year, the guy who wins gets to sew on his favorite patch. Unfortunately the last guy to win hasn't been on a trip in years. We had to substitute a piece of driftwood with inappropriate things carved into it. Most fish: It's a goofy looking green belt buckle shaped like a largemouth bass. Problem with this is that after the second day we all loose count ... so there is always friendly arguing at the end of the week over who won. These two trophies have been circulating through our group for years. Lots of memories and lots of fun!!"
3854945,bushead11,2015-05-09 18:40:00,151,"So i was wondering if anyone has creative ways their groups bet? Biggest fish payout? or most fish payout? Our group does it a little different. So we have 6 guys. Each puts in $50 bucks for a $300 prize pool. Each day each angler tracks their largest walleye and pike. Add the total inches and that is your daily total. At the end of the week whomever has the most total inches is the winner. Biggest walleye gets $75. Biggest pike gets $75 and the overall winner gets $150. You can vary this slightly by tracking the top 2 of each species or you can add in lakers or bass depending on your body of water. Our group always shakes dice and plays poker in camp but having a little ""action"" on the fishing adds a little competetive twist and bragging rights until next year never hurts either... What do you guys do?"
3854977,NARDA 1,2015-05-09 19:04:00,636,"We do pretty much the same thing but it runs for the whole week. Lengths of largest walleye, northern and smallmouth for the week are combined for a final score. We have a dry erase board set up to keep track during the week."
3854985,rnnonmt,2015-05-09 19:06:00,992,"Your wager sounds a bit cumbersome yet to each his own. I'm sure the group has a blast during pay pot time. We have a larger group of 15 so we keep it simple where we don't have to use a calculator or run a tally. We do biggest walleye and biggest pike. You are allowed to round up to the nearest 1/4"" just so we don't argue about ""did you squeeze the tail"" and bla bla bla. We go in $10 per person per species. Measurements need to be verified by someone on your boat. If you are out solo you need to have a picture on a tape measure tip to tale. Fun times!!!"
3855001,port1042,2015-05-09 19:27:00,509,"There are just 2 in our group, but we do like competition. We do biggest walleye, northern, and smallmouth for the week --- $10 each. Then it's ""first fish of the day"" for 7 days. Each of us ""risk"" a $100 payout. When were off the lake we're at the cribbage board. That get's played for a ""buck a game; nickle a peg; double on a skunk"". All losses go into the ""Canada Fund"" that pays for gas, bait, food, etc. for our trips. We play all year round so that pot can easily be worth a $1,000.00 or more when it's time head north. Just 13 more days. Can't wait."
3855377,Draco1206,2015-05-09 22:59:00,175,"Pretty much identical to what we do. We have two large trophies for pike and walleye and winners get their name, length of fish, name of lake, and year caught engraved on it and winners keep the trophy for the year. We also have a Barbie fishing pole tournament. We tried several other games/wagers but it started to affect the real reasons we go to Canada for so we keep it simple now."
3855481,kzoofisher,2015-05-10 05:26:00,5144,"None, I dislike competition in fishing. It turns a sport into a game. If I had the opportunity to go with a group that made a big deal about their competition I would decline. If it was just something they did but it was a more minor bit of fun, I'd kick in and then quietly fail to participate. Nothing against the folks who like to do it, it would just interfere with my primary reasons for going. No different a deal breaker for me than a group that focuses too much on booze or has to have Megadeath cranked up when sitting around the fire or play video games nonstop. To each his own, but if it's too far off from mine we'll all enjoy ourselves more separately."
3855497,Freytown,2015-05-10 05:39:00,770,Our group never had a fish contest. But each day we had a rule that no beer until you caught a walleye/pike. One year a heavy drinker couldn't catch nothing but finally caught a sucker. lol. He said that it qualified and had his first beer. We never laughed harder that day. LMAO
3855553,fishinnut 3446,2015-05-10 06:15:00,638,"Terry,I would have thought with your group the last guy that catches a fish buys the 1st bottle LOL !See you mid week when you guys get there"
3855577,pjshorthorn,2015-05-10 06:23:00,5654,"First fish, most fish, largest fish. The winner gets a loonie for each category each day payble after dinner or when the spirited debate on who is actually the winner finally subsides My son earned the nickname Loonie on his second trip at age 11 after he cleaned out everyone's loonies for the week. He thought he was The Man !!! PjShorthorn"
3855649,Mike Kansas,2015-05-10 06:53:00,1463,"No wagers, but we do have trophies for the biggest Walleye, Smallie and Pike for the week.
