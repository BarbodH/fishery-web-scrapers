3858657,UKBDM,2015-05-11 06:16:00,178,... at Jim and Julie's Jun 20-27. Hoping for some rain between now and then. How will you guys change things compared to normal or above normal water levels like last year? Last year was best ever for us.

If the weather stays cool we will probably find fish in some of the shallower bays (-10 ft.) as we do in higher water times but if the water temps are up we will go to the edges of deeper water. I think it has more to do with water temps. the shallower bays etc. warm up so fast during low water times. Of course they could get a lot of rain between now and middle June. I am not a pro and use the trial and error method. (makes it kind of fun). Good Luck to all this season."

3861425,billy weaver,2015-05-11 16:42:00,470,Keeping in mind that I am no expert and have formed my opinions by trial and error. (Mostly error) In the bays and shallow water areas of north Wabaskang we do well when the water temp is in the low 60 or cooler in mid June. If it has been warmer for a extended time not so good. I am talking about areas of 10ft. or less. When we are in these shallow water areas we fish in areas of vegetation. The spawn is well over and the walleye are eager to feed. In times of low water the water heats up so fast. I use to fish earlier in the season but being an old f--t the cold bothers my hands so much. Remember a lot can happen between now and mid-June. In any case good fishing to you.
