Anyone have some information to share is appreciated Thanks Track Fish On-"
3843601,Hump,2015-05-06 08:11:00,578,Pat at Evergreen says it is very very low
3843681,Mark R,2015-05-06 08:29:00,1538,with the ban on raw chicken and eggs I hope they allow your pheasant to come across the border
3856561,LoDo,2015-05-10 10:45:00,721,"Thats great news! We fished the Woodland Caribou area west of Red Lake last year. We caught fish, but nothing like years past. Hope the best for everyone!!!"
3859721,Hump,2015-05-11 10:12:00,578,That may be a good question. Will they allow pheasant?
3835641,Knoxabilly,2015-05-03 20:42:00,225,I'm getting so excited to be at my home away from home Evergreen Lodge for the opener. Any news on the ice conditions Ear Falls area? Is the water low? Who else is gearing up for the opener?
3836809,Mark R,2015-05-04 09:36:00,1538,"I guess we will see you at Evergreen in 11 days. Hoping for good weather, Just hear from Pat at Evergreen and the ice has been out so we are good to go."
3837385,Knoxabilly,2015-05-04 12:24:00,225,"Sounds good Mark, you'll have to say hi!"
3838345,LoDo,2015-05-04 17:55:00,721,Love some Lac Seul and have stayed in the Ear Falls area a few times years ago. Fished the opener last year and it was our worst year in 10 years fishing NWO. Not to put a damper on your week as I'm positive it'll be better. Im sure you remember the ice out last year was extremely late in NWO. We had to fly out on the river next to Red Lake because Howie Bay on Red Lake was still heavy ice. We fished the opener three years ago in NWO and was one of the better years we have experienced. Early ice out that season. Have an absolute blast!!!

3838489,Knoxabilly,2015-05-04 18:46:00,225,"We fished the opener last year and there was ice for a couple of the first days on the lake preventing us from getting to spots. Once the ice cleared we caught the most amount of large over the slot eyes that I can remember. I caught a 29.5"" at one spot and 30 minutes later caught a 28""! Wild stuff, I hope it's similar results this year. Very excited"

3840369,Guest,2015-05-05 09:26:00,0,I'm looking forward to the pheasant. Did you find someone to cook it?
3842217,Hump,2015-05-05 19:34:00,578,Captain Walleye knows the secret to fine pheasant.
