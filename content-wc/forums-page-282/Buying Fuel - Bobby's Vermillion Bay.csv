The only card problems (two) were my Shell card not working at Bobbie's (or anywhere else in Canada) and a VISA card getting rejected when used at a lodge. The latter problem was because I forgot to call the card company and let them know I'd be out of the country and charging a larger sum than usual. I'm glad the automated security system refused to process the charge. Used to carry traveler's checks, too, and never had one rejected. It greatly simplifies things now to only have to carry VISA and U.S. dollars. They'll get you all the food, fuel and bait a person could need.""Life may not be the party we hoped for, but while we are here we might as well dance."" (Anon.)Just my experience, but I've discovered that at least 99.3% of the times I'm upset or P.O.'d, it's because I choose to be. Took me most of a lifetime to learn, but it's true that what I feel and how I react to a situation is, after all, how I choose to feel and how I choose to react. Neither rain nor ice, a flat tire nor a credit card glitch, nor any other insignificant hiccup will detract from my trips to NW Ontario. Regardless of what happens today, the fish will be there tomorrow, and there's always more coffee to drink.Not gassing up at Bobbie's and spending ten minutes wandering around the store . . . . well, that would make me think pretty hard about whether the trip is worth it!"
3834145,dutchboy,2015-05-03 10:05:00,5717,"Was it Bobbys fault you couldn't walk inside and out a couple of times? I do it all the time. If there is blame in this situation (I'm not sure there is) it lays in the person looking at you in your mirror. Bobby's obviously has enough people willing to purchase their way that they stay in business. For perspective, I have a problem with the Mille Lacs Casino. I don't like their policies concerning management of the lake. I refuse to go in the place. Personal choice. I don't think anyone there has lost any sleep or missed me or my money. Please let us know where you take your business in the future. I'm sure you will sleep ok with your decision."
3834881,Carnhzkr,2015-05-03 16:23:00,964,I like your attitude. I admit that too often I fall into the trap of focusing on the minor setback rather than the larger experience.
3849121,fish 4 fun,2015-05-07 16:15:00,101,One of the highlights of the Canada trip was always stopping at Bobby's and getting berated by him while you got your fishing licence! I have to admit our group one time drove off without paying for gas. We all thought that one of the other ones had paid. We realized out mistake and called back with a credit card number. I think they had the authorities looking for us.
3854513,Skyraptor,2015-05-09 14:03:00,291,"Pretty simple if you ask me, last year knowing I was going to Canada in the fall I upgraded one of my credit cards to the 'chip' technology. I worked every time I bought fuel including fuel at Bobby's. I did some research and knew that a lot of gas stations required the chip for fuel purchases at the pump or just go inside and pay with your normal card. Sounds more like crying over sour milk then doing a little research and adapting to technology."
3832673,bobbylfishermon,2015-05-02 15:40:00,241,"It' all about the MONEY Gord, the cost of changing over to cards like you guys have is a ""extra"" expense to our U.S. banks! GEEZ,give us a break, do you think they can afford it? the cards with chips are a lot more secure and you would think they would hustle to get things switched.. It's always about the buck... I'm jealous that the shorthorn won that VBL bling, there's always next year, besides it wouldn't hurt to buy a hoodie from you and wear it around Indian, second thought..."
3833049,BornToFish,2015-05-02 19:32:00,1224,"I was at Bobby's at 6:15 on a Friday evening. My vehicle was the only vehicle at the gas pumps. There were not other customers in the store at the time. The attendant, on her own initiative, came out to my vehicle to see why I was unable to pay at the pump. She visually inspected my credit card and told me that they did not honor credit cards without a ""chip"". The attendant did not offer me any other options to purchase gasoline. I do not recall seeing any other signage at the pumps. The attendant did not point out any other signage to me. In my opinion, the attendant effectively refused to sell me gasoline. I am glad that the owner spent megabucks to upgrade the gas pumps at his place of business. He likely implemented the procedures that are in place to minimize drive-offs, to ensure the profitability of his business. I am sure that some people find Bobby's of Vermillion Bay to be a desirable place to conduct business. I don't! I may not be the center of the universe, but I am the center of my universe when it comes to spending my money. I honestly can't imagine a reason why I would ever again need or want to go to this place of business. They don't have or won't sell me the things that I want to buy. It's that simple. I have found other places to purchase the things that I want to purchase when I am in NW Ontario. I will find another place to purchase fuel. I am never happy when it comes to unpleasant surprises. Stopping at Bobby's last night ranks right up there. I simply stated what happened so that others do not experience the same unpleasant surprise that I experienced. Travelers can either obtain credit cards with ""chips"", bring Canada currency or shop somewhere else. I know what I will be doing."
3833249,roscoe33,2015-05-02 21:13:00,653,"I have 2 US issued cards, with chips, they worked in CA last August. Get ahold of your cc company/bank and tell them you need a card with a chip that will work in Canada. See what they have to offer. Best to have a pile of cash or travelers check as a back up when on the road."
3833337,Fishin Fun,2015-05-02 22:17:00,218,I have used mine in Canada for the past 3 years and never had a problem. It has the micro chip in it. The American banking system is working their way towards using this chip. Even Walmart now has that technology in their cc machines. I use it all the time. Including Bobbies.
3833417,Guest,2015-05-03 05:32:00,0,"Businesses in the US are very slowly upgrading their card swiping systems. I went to Wally World yesterday and bought several items. I get to the checkout and I swipe the card as usual. The clerk tells me this is a new card and I have to insert the whole card in the bottom of the swipe device. When it reads the card, you get a completely different message on the screen."
3833433,BornToFish,2015-05-03 05:48:00,1224,"My previous ""non-chip"" style VISA card worked perfectly well for me in all of my fishing trips in 2014 and in March 2015. This is why my experience at Bobby's was so unpleasant. I recently received a ""chip"" style ID card to enter my former employer's health center. They said a replacement card would cost me $25 due to the high cost of the cards. I'm sure part of this is a scare factor to not lose the card. However, the cost of such ""chip"" cards must be considerably higher than conventional cards. I'm sure the cost factor (as pointed out earlier in this thread) is why VISA issued me a standard card two weeks ago, rather than a ""chip"" style card. I will bring this topic of ""chip"" style cards up for discussion with VISA, but suspect that I already know their response. I gave up on Traveler's Checks years ago as I was having trouble finding places that would honor the checks. They must have been losing money on these in view of fraudulent checks. I'm pretty much left with converting US funds to Canada funds for my upcoming trips to Canada. This approach has left me in the past with unspent money which I cannot spend until my next trip to Canada. As such, I will carefully manage this approach to minimize my ""dead"" money. The ironic thing about this will be that others will eventually find themselves in the same boat. Is this approach good for retailers in Canada that depend upon tourism? I doubt it very much."

3833705,Blue Lk,2015-05-03 07:46:00,269,"Having slept on my response,I wish to apologize for the last part of my reply,it was uncalled for.The truth of the matter is,most pay at pump won't recognise an unchipped card,the OP would have the same problem at almost all pumps in Canada.American credit cards without the chip can still be used at check-outs & in store tills."
3833713,Pooch,2015-05-03 07:48:00,4619,"The CC issuers in the USA are way behind and causing us the grief the OP had. Not Bobbies fault by any means. We need to rag on our card companies to get with the program. We've had to replace our card twice in the past two years because it was cloned and used overseas. What a pain had we been out of the country when this happened!I can see myself being PO'd if this had unexpectedly happened to me, and at first glance I'd probably be mad at the retailer. Even though it isn't his fault. Until we get chipped cards we might as well get used to problems and at least be aware that it can happen.Using our credit card outside the states is convenient, but I still like to have several hundred Canadian with me when north of the border. Just makes the everyday expenses easier for both parties.Speaking of currency, I can't imagine many places in the U.S. taking Canadian currency as easily as the Canadians take our currency. I don't think everyone is happy when you pay in U.S. currency even if they can make a little extra on the exchange rate for the extra hassle.Just my thoughts.Pooch"
3831889,BornToFish,2015-05-02 06:43:00,1224,"I received a new VISA credit card in the US two weeks ago, as my previous card expired. I validated the new card before leaving home and used it at Fort Frances to purchase some supplies. The new credit card worked just fine. I stopped at Bobby's in Vermillion Bay to top off my fuel tank. I was the only vehicle parked at the pumps. A sign at the pumps told me that I have two options to buy fuel between 6:00 - 10:00 p.m. I could either pre-pay or pay at the pump. The first option wasn't appealing to me as I didn't know how much fuel it would take to fill my truck's gas tank. So, I pulled out my VISA card and swiped it at the pump. Nothing happened. I swiped it again and nothing happened. A young female attendant came out and asked me if I was having problems. I said that my credit card wasn't working to pay at the pump. She looked at my card and said my credit card would not work as they only take credit cards with a ""chip"". I said ""thanks"" and she said ""sorry"". I don't know if other gas stations or businesses in the area have the same policy. I mention this so followers of Walleye Central can plan ahead. I mention this in part as I am pretty sure that anglers stop at Bobby's to buy licenses, bait, fuel, souvenirs and the like before finishing their drive to their destination This will sound like a rant, because it is. Bobby's stopped selling dry ice several years ago. They have also been out of leeches the last several years by the time of day that I drive through Vermillion Bay. Bobby's will not accept pre-payment to reserve leeches - first come, first served! Now, I can't buy fuel there. I can't think of another reason to ever again want to stop at Bobby's to shop there. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

3832281,Golden Eagle,2015-05-02 09:44:00,2642,The ease of my doing business at Bobby's corner with U.S. currency far exceeds what Bobby contends with when he travels through Tennessee carrying Canadian funds. I appreciate being able to use my money when I visit NW Ontario.
3832345,NARDA 1,2015-05-02 10:44:00,636,Don't know why the attendant didn't suggest this but why didn't you give the attendant your credit card and explain to her you were going to fill up and then you would come in to finish the transaction. Just a thought.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think paying at the pump is a big deal. My comment was directed toward the reply that said he wasn't the center of the universe. The guy can rant. He gave several examples. Dry ice, bait and now gas. Things that have changed."
3832521,v-bay gord,2015-05-02 12:30:00,3168,"I'm pretty sure that there are signs on the pumps stating that the pumps will not accept US credit cards. Inside the store is different....you can use your card there. Why banks in the US cannot update their cards with the chip technology is the question, not why Bobby's is at fault. Ray, the owner at Bobby's, once told me the amount of money he was losing on people driving off without paying for gas....it was astounding.....so if the new pumps are more secure then my hat goes off to him for making the upgrade. But, as in most things, you can't please everyone."
