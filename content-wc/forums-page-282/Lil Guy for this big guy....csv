3841705,quickster2,2015-05-05 17:21:00,41,Used them on Saginaw Bay (Michigan) Saturday for the 1st time. 4 out of 11 fish caught on them. I have ordered more and will try them at Happy Days this summer.

3853513,quickster2,2015-05-09 01:39:00,41,We had to slow down to get a bite not necessarily due to lure limitations. We never tried to see what speed the lure might quit at.
