I have all the stuff to catch walleyes and pike that time of year. What I'm looking for is advice on where to locate fish in mid-September (we head up 9/11) and thus, what gear that I probably don't have or don't have enough of should I stock up on between now and then? (We're going to LOTW, Sioux Narrows/Whitefish Bay area -- first time, at that -- if that influences your response.)I don't want to get up there and find out that I can't effectively fish the way I need to because I don't have enough heavy jigs or a rod that can get a good hookset in 30+ feet of water. Like I said, I have tons of quarter- and eighth-ounce jigs, the standard-issue 6' Ugly Stik rods, all that. I have picked up enough deeper-diving cranks that if we need to troll 20-ish feet deep I should be OK. But beyond that, I suspect may be hurting for gear for fall fishing.OR can we expect the fish to be moving back to springtime haunts by then? I really have no idea what to expect but if they are likely to be deeper I don't want to show up unprepared. Especially if there are some of you who make two trips a year, I'd be curious what you leave behind for your fall trip and what you take that you don't use in the spring.Thanks in advance for any advice or gear recommendations!-Steve"
3856857,BornToFish,2015-05-10 12:44:00,1224,"I fish in NW Ontario throughout the open water season. In fact, I am fishing in Sunset Country right now. My absolute favorite time of the year is August and September - fewer boats and bugs compared to other time of the season. The downside can be unstable weather. I love vertical jigging for walleyes during autumn. I know where they all are if I can pull up to a rock hump and catch one walleye. They are often quite deep this time of the season. That doesn't mean every walleye is on a reef somewhere, as some are chasing bait schools in the deep while others may be working the weeds. But, a lot of walleyes will be on structure. I use a good quality Light power rod with six pound test monofilament. I attach a 1/8 ounce jig and an in-line SPRO swivel to minimize line twist. Some folks prefer a ML power rod. Honestly, that's all that I need to catch walleyes - LOTS of them. Big northern pike may still be on the rock humps if the warm weather lingers. If not, they often move back to remaining patches of cabbage weed along the shoreline. They often hang out in the vicinity of green weeds until the weather turns over. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3856961,drew59,2015-05-10 13:48:00,87,"In September we tend to catch walleyes in 25-50 feet of water. We jig humps and points. The fun part of fall fishing is that your locator will really show the fish. In fact, we don't wet a line until we see them on ""TV"". We use a camp boat but I take an anchor with a 100ft rope and an electric motor. Both are essential IMO, especially the anchor if it's windy. We go in the spring and fall but if I had to pick one it would be fall. You will love it!"
3857785,TheDFP,2015-05-10 19:06:00,39,One thing to consider is the amount of daylight in September. It gets dark out a lot earlier than in June.
3859129,MrSimon,2015-05-11 08:10:00,922,"Common knowledge says to look for walleye and pike in deeper water and main lake structure in the fall. While that is certainly good advice, it doesn't always hold true. Depending on the water temperature of your lake, you could very easily find fish in shallow weed beds .... which is awesome because they are easy and super fun to catch."
3861185,buckeyedan,2015-05-11 15:49:00,44,"We are doing the same this year. We've gone in late June/early July for as long as I can remember, but this year we shaking things ups a little and trying Labor day week. We know how to fish the lake in early summer, but fall will be a new challenge. Excited to try some new locations and techniques. We really have no idea what to expect...looking forward to the challenge..."
3866177,zeebee,2015-05-13 07:14:00,1144,"Fall is my favorite time for fishing. Many factors ....temps are more bearable....no bugs...less traffic and, walleye are predictable and the feed bag is on. As a non jigger...too boring for me, I troll cranks. Anything that will get below 15' and down to 30' will catch fish. I like DHJ's, TD's, RR's, all in the largest offerings. For a change of pace try BB with a slow death and 3 ozs of weight. Various techniques work and under the right conditions shallow weedlines are the ticket. I never pass a rock outcropping without tossing a floating stick crank to the edge...especially if theres some weed poking out. Its a big walleye magnet. Every year, my largest walleye are picked up in the fall...yet to get one smaller than 29""at LOW. Dont know why the hordes flock to the spring bite, fall is so much better."
