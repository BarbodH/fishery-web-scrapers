3854625,rzep,2015-05-09 15:39:00,1196,I brought my brit twice to Ontario... Each way was not an issue in either ditrecton. I got paper from the veterinary about all the shots. No one ever asked for it..noone ever even look what was in the crate...
3854641,rnnonmt,2015-05-09 15:54:00,992,"Shouldn't be a problem. Just make sure your pup doesn't have any misdemeanors otherwise a border agent ""could"" deny entry for your dog at his/her discretion. Sorry I couldn't resist commenting because of a thread that has got a lot of correspondence from both sides regarding the ""rules"" on who is allowed entry into Canada. All kidding aside.... Just bring a current vaccinations report from your vet. You probably won't even be asked for them."

3854721,LOW1,2015-05-09 16:53:00,2828,"The rules require proof of a rabies shot within the last 30 days but I have never been asked for it. On the way back, if you cross at IFalls pooch has a good chance of scoring a dog biscuit from the far right border agent station.Dogs seem to be a nonissue when crossing."

3855841,SinOrSwim,2015-05-10 07:33:00,1528,LOLOLOL I was actually going to make a comment like this.
3856521,Knoxabilly,2015-05-10 10:34:00,225,"American bulldogs are not the same as pitbulls. Pitbulls are terriers, American bulldogs come from mastiffs and english bulldogs- so you can't say aka pitbulls. ""****zu's aka rottweilers"""
