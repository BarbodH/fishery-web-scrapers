Great spot, a bunkie and an ice house! We tried a little for brook trout without success. The river was stirred up, turbid water when we were there."

3856577,ziggyzag,2015-05-10 10:49:00,125,Looking for anyone who has been to Abamasagi Lake near Nakina. Would like to here how was the walleye & pike fishing? How much water there is to fish and overall experience they had.
3856609,Mike Borger,2015-05-10 10:55:00,1554,"Awesome walleye lake, highly recommended!Write up on my family trip there a couple years back:http://www.canadafishingguide.net/fa...lleye-factory/"
3856785,ziggyzag,2015-05-10 12:07:00,125,Mike: Thanks for the information and the very nice report. We will be going next spring the first week of June. Did you ever venture to the south end of the lake where the river comes in and out?? I understand that in the spring we might be able to catch some brook trout from out flowing river? Sounds and looks like you and your kids had a wonderful time along with your dad. We also have (3) generations of our family going and its a wonderful time for every one in our family who goes. We have been to many of the lake around Nakina but this will be our first trip to Abamasagi.
3857137,Mike Borger,2015-05-10 15:22:00,1554,"I fished every inch of the lake. The Kowkash river where it flows in, then out is not at the south end. It's about halfway down along the south shore. I've heard rumours about the odd brook trout but we certainly didn't encounter any in the middle of July. You might have more luck first week of June.You won't have any trouble catching lots of walleye, no doubt about that! But you will be targeting them in different spots than I was. That time of year you'll have a legit crack at larger pike as well."
3857345,ziggyzag,2015-05-10 17:06:00,125,I assume by you traveling in by atv that the river connecting O'Sullivan lake and Aba lake is not doable by boat??
3858113,Mike Borger,2015-05-10 20:29:00,1554,"It's totally doable when the water is high. If Howard is bringing you in that's what he'd likely do in early June. It's also the ONLY legal means for any non native to access the lake besides flying in. I had no idea - but found out later that it's illegal for anyone to access Aba with motorized vehicle unless you're native. He never said anything to us at the time so I assumed everything was fine. He said ""we're going to take you in with atv's instead"". He was our outfitter so how were we to know it wasn't legal? Fact is me and my entire family could have ben charged. He asked me to edit my story after the fact and I declined."
3858897,ziggyzag,2015-05-11 07:20:00,125,Mike: We will be flying in with TLO just wondering if you went by there outpost cabin which I believe was north of your cabin? I know they have two cabins on the south west side of the lake also. So if the water is high enough we could possibly fish O'Sullivan Lake or should I say explore these waters. Our group is into seeing allot of shore line just because its there. Just asking your opinion on which location would you think would be better in the spring for walleye fishing?
3859217,Mike Borger,2015-05-11 08:28:00,1554,"OK cool, you'll be in TLO's cabin about halfway down that long northeastern arm. Can tell you it looked very nice from the water, definitely nicer than the other two camps on the north shore of the lake.You'll be able to navigate down the outlet river a fair piece. It's pretty wide and slow. IMO it'll likely be a great spring spot for both walleye and northerns. You WILL not be able to navigate all the way to O'Sullivan unless you're willing to run class 4 rapids LOL! That won't be happening. FWIW you can't going very far up the river where it flows in, there's rapids. Base of the rapids will be a great spot though.In general that entire delta area of the lake close to where the Kowcash flows in then out will be an absolute hotspot in the spring - you'll catch tons of walleyes there. More than you can imagine. TLO only has 9.9's on their boats so my guess is it'll be a 20-25 minute run from your cabin to the delta area.If you follow that northeastern arm all the way to the end there's a creek flowing in just to the right of Howards cabin. You can navigate up that for several more miles. It widens out in a couple of spots creating small lakes. Lots of fish in there as well and a really fun day trip especially if the main lake is rough.There's also a very interesting self contained little bay at the very south end of the lake (opposite end from your camp). There's a narrow channel you have to navigate to enter it then it opens right up. A creek flows in there and my guess is it'd be a great early season spot for pike.If you have anymore questions shoot me a pm or better yet call me direct, I'm happy to help."
3861441,unclepaully,2015-05-11 16:44:00,112,"Ziggy-I fished Abamasagi a few years ago. We stayed at Howard's cabin just like Mike. I did get over to the TLO outfitter cabin that you will be staying in. We met some guys from Wisconsin and they invited us over for coffee. I really liked the setting of that cabin. It was pretty basic on the inside. If I remember right, it had a shower room but it did not work. A Zodi shower pump would work great in there. It had a really nice dock and footpaths were lighted with solar lights. For some pretty good evening fishing those guys would fish the opposite shoreline in front of their cabin. About a 2 minute boat ride."
3861465,ziggyzag,2015-05-11 17:01:00,125,Thanks for the input. How was the fishing when you where there? What time of the year did you go?
