3702282,wdodgetruck,2015-03-28 06:48:00,4,When we are at WRC . We take a day and go way up the river. The kids enjoy the boat ride and the shore dinners. The kids like going to the dump to see the bears and the wolves. Paul and Deb are great hosts. We are from Pauls home town and went to school with him .
3863097,back357,2015-05-12 07:06:00,106,"If you are looking to drive just a bit farther, or even think about going up through Pigeon River instead of International Falls, you should look at staying in Ignace and hitting the numerous lakes just north of there. I have been going up there for about 15 years. Stay at Agimak Lake Resort. Claude runs the place and it has been around for ages. He can give you some great insight into the 10 lakes within driving distance of the camp. Low pressure lakes with great scenery. All species. I am not sure about availability but here is their website - http://www.agimaklake.com/contact"

3617706,michigan walleye guy,2015-03-05 17:21:00,95,"Just read a nice article in Ontario Out of Doors on Fushimi Lake Provincial Park, which is probably a bit farther than you might want to drive, but which is on my bucket list, now, for drive-to destinations. Have stayed at Sandbar Provincial Park north of Ignace, and was impressed with both the park itself and the fishing. Ontario has very, very nice provincial parks."
3618074,tuiflies,2015-03-05 18:55:00,158,"I've been bringing my family up to Donnelly's Minnitaki Lake Lodge for the past six years and we're very happy there. 2.5hrs from I Falls, nice cabins, great fishing at a descent price. My dad brings his boat up from Southern Ont. every year."
3620034,Mike Borger,2015-03-06 09:50:00,1554,"Yes, that was the travel editor of the magazine I write for who wrote that piece. I've heard plenty of good things about it.It's worth mentioning though if you're camping there's a ton of options out there that are perhaps even better."

3695690,prov1800,2015-03-26 15:51:00,5010,"I live with in 15 minutes of most of the lakes you mentioned and have guided on them for years all fantastic lakes for most species.what are you looking for that these lakes didnt offer you.it could not have been the fishing.one lake i didnt see mentioned would be lac suel.it to is fantastic, but big.you might look at the camps over in sioux lookout.fishing there is also fantastic.four lakes there that are connectef.minnitaki, abram, pelucan which all flows into lac sueland can be navigated in high water.worth a look.ive fished there quite often and cant say anything bad about the fishing.there is wabigoon lake in dryden.i deal with a lot of camps so if there is something specific your looking for let me know.also see you havnt been on cliff lake.your missing the boat on that gem.be like a pipestone with good walleye population.check out lost bay resort."
3696306,wdodgetruck,2015-03-26 18:56:00,4,Take a look at Women River Camp in Ear Falls . Been there a few times . Its a great camp .
3698617,stormerlake,2015-03-27 08:15:00,6,We would like to recommend Stormer Lake Lodge. A drive-to lodge. It is farther from the border than you stated but the fishing for Walleyes and Pike are World Class. It is the only lodge on two lakes www.stormerlakelodge.com Thank you.
3698801,HeHooksHimself,2015-03-27 08:54:00,725,I have stayed with Paul and Deb at Woman River Camp few times. You spend lots of time in transit on occasion since there is so much water but system is easy and productive. Paul is a great host and guide and will make sure you catch fish. Very fair rates and lots of portage opportunities at no extra charge. Use any jig color as long as it is chartreuse.
3605506,vjs5150,2015-03-02 20:13:00,32,"Fellow anglers, I've gotten some good info on the boards here but wanted to see if I could be more specific on my search. 4 or 5 of us drive up from Chicago area almost every year and looking for a last minute recommendation for this summer. We are primarily walleye fisherman and would like to find a place within 3 hours drive of International Falls or Sault Ste Marie. We've been to Eagle Lake, Cedar, Pipestone, Winnipeg River System in Minaki (one of my favorites), Clay Lake, Canyon Lake, Lake Chapleau, etc. This year we are going to take 2 boats up so need a decent road for access. Thinking maybe the northern side of Rainy or heading back to Pipestone where we went 2 years ago, beautiful lake but walleye were slow. We want it all of course, low boat traffic and good fishing, accommodations don't have to be fancy. Appreciate any advice, good fishing to all!"
3605546,LoDo,2015-03-02 20:32:00,721,"Onaway Lodge on Lac Seul. I've fished Minaki several times in my youth. Stayed at Paradise Cove, fished Big Sand in the wee AM with the northern lights providing our light. I don't think I'll ever see lights like that again. Unreal! We caught walleyes in 100' water trolling crank baits 20'. Huge walleyes! Love some Canada fishing. I go every year! To this day my favorite drive in is Onaway Lodge on the famous Lac Seul. I haven't been in 7 yrs, but its my favorite. You mentioned you are towing boats. You'll be fine. The 105 is nicely paved. Google the lodge. Cabins, docks, fish house, owners, etc.... first class!"
3605762,Mike Borger,2015-03-03 03:37:00,1554,"Not exactly in your wheelhouse, but worth mentioning is Caribou Lake in Armstrong Station. About a 4 hour drive from Grand Portage. Huge lake with great fishing.http://www.cariboulakelodge.com/http://www.bearpawlodge.net/ Crossing at the Soo 3 hours easily puts you in Wawa or White River. You didn't mention a fly in, but you might be surprised how cheaply it can be done in that region. I have several good contacts, email me directly at [email protected] and I'll give you some options and prices if you have any interest. Cheers"
3605786,ftfarms,2015-03-03 05:00:00,444,I would say lake of the woods out of morson Ontario. If you haven't fished lotws before it's worth a try. We boat in to miles bay to get away from the main land. I think its pretty awesome.
3605842,Guest,2015-03-03 05:50:00,0,"I also have fished the minaki area for many years, love it. Just north is the English river, Halleys have 3 camps on this large body of water, one is house keeping. Dark stained water, very little fishing pressure and world class walleye fishing. We typically stay in Minaki and will pull the boats up to the English for a day or two during the week. You will not be sorry"
3607370,SinOrSwim,2015-03-03 13:07:00,1528,"vjs, I sent you a PM of my thoughts of Onaway. Camp, owners etc."
3608306,WalleyeWally28,2015-03-03 16:20:00,298,"Check out Whitewing Resort on Lac Seul. My Wife and I have fished out of Whitewing 19 weeks in the past 12 years. We have reservations for 3 trips this year. Really nice cabins, great owners and fantastic fishing.www.whitewingresort.com"
3611538,Steve Ediger,2015-03-04 11:40:00,97,"You might give Rod and Lorita a call at Lac Seul Lodge. It is a very nice, clean, and affordable camp with very good equipment. It's on Rat Bay and close to highway 105 near Ear Falls. There is easy access to the ""big"" water or you can fish the bays close to the lodge if the weather is cooperating. The walleye bite should not be slow, and there are plenty of pike and smallies nearby as well. Depending on what time of year you are planning your trip, you may need to call early, as they tend to fill early with repeat customers. I spend four weeks a year up there and love every minute."
3613290,Knoxabilly,2015-03-04 18:07:00,225,I have to throw in Evergreen Lodge on Lac Seul. Pat is the best host and very accommodating! I don't care to go anywhere else because the place and service is so good!
3613338,Blades-n-Beads,2015-03-04 18:23:00,484,"Vjs, you will never be disappointed with LacSeul or lake of the woods. LacSeul mentioned camps are a sure bet for you guys. If interested in LOW try pipestone point resort (boat in) out of Kenora or drive into WitchBay camp. Either one you guys will have a blast. Blades"
