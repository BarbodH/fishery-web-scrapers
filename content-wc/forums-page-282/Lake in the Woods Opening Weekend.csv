3852497,bthomas3333,2015-05-08 16:18:00,465,Ok the ice is gone on Lake in the Woods area. So how does the walleye bite look for opening weekend May 16 on Lake in the Woods. Are we mostly pre-spawn or post-spawn or SOL? If we fall into the 3rd category what is the back up plan? Search for Trout or Pike or ??? Thanks B-

3852793,Fisherman Ted,2015-05-08 17:54:00,461,I have water temps in the low 40s and it did in fact snow today. Bitterly cold and cold weather for the next few days. Won't warm up until late next week. Going to be close.

3853873,Obabikon,2015-05-09 06:56:00,2370,You've got me worried that my unit's temp isn't working. Mine has been reading in the 50's all week.
3853977,Fisherman Ted,2015-05-09 07:49:00,461,We are a bit colder than LOW. A depth of 440 feet doesn't help water temps much this time of year.
