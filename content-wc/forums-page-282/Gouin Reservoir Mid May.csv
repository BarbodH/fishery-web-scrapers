3851217,whitewatersalvo,2015-05-08 08:43:00,11,"Also does anyone know where you can get Depth Charts for Gouin, I've been looking high and low and can't find any, specifically looking for Saraana Bay.Thanks, getting excited!"
3851289,Kartman35,2015-05-08 09:00:00,245,try trolling with harnesses and or slow death hooks behind bottom bouncers or split shots around 1-1.5 mph. Good luck
3851321,Freytown,2015-05-08 09:11:00,770,"This one is for Saraana (Gouin Reservoir: West,)https://www.trakmaps.com/PrintedMapD...a-655beecfa505 Good luck."
3851369,Kartman35,2015-05-08 09:17:00,245,or you can take screenshots from the navionics web app
3851385,Freytown,2015-05-08 09:21:00,770,Good idea. http://webapp.navionics.com/?lang=en
3851425,TheDFP,2015-05-08 09:35:00,39,I would not get too hung up on all the depth charts and stuff for the actual fishing part. It is nice to eliminate water that is too deep and/or shallow. Best way to start out is ask the people who are leaving where they caught fish and at what depth and mark it on a map.
3853561,octanehi5,2015-05-09 04:24:00,1104,"navonics on your phone, The water changes alot on the gouin, the maps will show the depth at the time it was taken, Fishing on the gouin is best near deep pools that come up shallow near wind blown islands, water moving through neck down areas. You can not beat a portable fish finder find humps & points of islands. your outfitter can tell you were. Walleyes will be walleyes were ever you are fishing."
3821249,whitewatersalvo,2015-04-28 13:58:00,11,"Hey there, first post on these forums!I am heading up to Gouin in East Saraana Bay with Air Tamarac on May 14 with a group of guys.I've never fished the area before and wanted to get some of your opinions on what works best this early in the season. I've read some of the other threads on here but a lot of them seem to be for people going in june and later.What kind of gear will get those early season walleye? We were planning on spending a lot of our time jigging, but wouldn't be against trolling too if that would be better.What do you guys think about the ice on Gouin, we were told by Jean that mid may would be a great time as the ice would have gone, but now some reports I see say that the ice out could be as late as may 20. Were booking Cabins 30 and 31, anyone have any experience there? Apparently its right at the mouth of a river and walleye can sometimes hold there while the water temps are cool.Anyways, pretty much any info on Gouin out there that you have would be great, but I am especially looking for info on early season Gouin and what we can expect around East Saraana Bay.Thanks WC.Pat."
3821433,octanehi5,2015-04-28 14:59:00,1104,"Early seasopn you will want to troll around bottom bouncers and find the fish,then Jig, they should be shallow, you should be good to go by the 14th, water will be cold, his camps on the gouin are very near the spawning grounds.the warmest water will be flowing into the lake. My personal opinion, I think it will ice out by the 10th"
3821729,Freytown,2015-04-28 16:59:00,770,"I never fished East Saraana Bay area but I have fished the West area at cabins 14,15,16. This is the major spawning area for baie Saraana. You will not be far from there...a short boat ride. You will have to stop as you enter the spawning area but just outside it is very good in the spring.Walleye season starts 5/15, a good bite usually starts around 6/1 or later. But you never know...good luck."
3822073,whitewatersalvo,2015-04-28 18:12:00,11,"I appreciate the tips, supposedly we are right next to a river that is a spawning ground that's not closed.. Hope you are right about ice off, we were told today by the outfitter that it looks good.Quote: Originally Posted by FreytownI never fished East Saraana Bay area but I have fished the West area at cabins 14,15,16.

But you never know...good luck.Good to know about West Saraana, we will check it out for sure. I didn't realize the walleye season only started on the 15th, anyways appreciate the tips and the good luck wishes, I've got plenty of experience walleye fishing but none in this area, and am hoping the good bite starts a little earlier than your experience.Anyone else have tips for what to use/where to go in early spring for the walleye? I've heard they will be in the rivers, is that true?"
3822201,TheDFP,2015-04-28 18:32:00,39,We stay in West Saraana and go in early June. We fish in the East area quite a bit. Caught our some of our biggest walleye and pike in that neck of the woods. Take a depth finder. We start trolling in 10-12 feet on points until we find fish. The West cabins are located near the spawning grounds. Take plenty of crawlers and jigs! Have fun and report back on how the fishing and road back into Clova is.
3822337,canyon,2015-04-28 18:59:00,37,We have great luck jigging or trolling with live leaches and that time off the year I would focus on water 10 ft or less.
3827417,revitup,2015-04-30 10:10:00,140,"I believe the walleye opener is the third Saturday in May, which makes it May 16th, not the 15th. Of course I fish in Ontario and don't know for sure about Gouin."
3827657,whitewatersalvo,2015-04-30 11:50:00,11,"It is the 15th, as per the outfitter and the Quebec 2015 fishing regs. Anyone else have any experience with early season ice off Gouin Walleye and/or Pike?"
3827897,canyon,2015-04-30 13:39:00,37,For pike no. 4 Len Thompson five of diamonds.
3828625,a3dad,2015-04-30 19:01:00,115,"We normally go in on the opener for Pike. Start in the back bays, as shallow as you can get and work outward. Pike will be in post-spawn looking for the warmest water they can find. South-facing bays are the best. The 'eyes will be in 10-12ft as others have stated more than likely pre or active spawn. Always look for moving water or wind-blown shores. Be sure to hit them hard."
