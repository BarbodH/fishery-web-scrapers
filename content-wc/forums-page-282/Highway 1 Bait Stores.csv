Also, we had typically bought bait at Manny's, but heard some positive reviews of Walkers and was thinking of trying that if anyone has any thoughts? I also read that it's technically illegal to transport bait from Manitoba to Ontario? The bait stores definitely have never said anything about it, probably for obvious reasons. If this is true, would someone have any bait recommendations between the western Ontario border to Kenora? Looking to buy a couple flats of nightcrawlers and a few pounds of leeches. Any idea on what they are going for this year as well? Thanks guys! Matt"
