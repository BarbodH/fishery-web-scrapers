3846873,fishron,2015-05-07 05:59:00,317,"Really looking forward to our second trip to Hebert. Still working to get a fourth guy but I'm not unfamiliar with fishing solo. There's a new video of the area available now that really shows the beauty of their camp on the lake. The island site really does provide a large reduction in the bug population. I don't think I applied bug spray at all when I was at our cabin site. I'm determined to make the weight this year. We're only up for five days so some clothing can be eliminated. We had no trouble with boiled tap water for coffee and cooking, (I think it actually added some flavor). I'm only taking one box of jigs and a few pike lures to carry in my boat bag. So with the reduction of bottled water, there's a chance. Of course other essentials, beer, bourbon, and good food need to be maintained. We're looking forward to that fish fry get together, Ron, and of course some great fishing."

Yes looking forward to fishing and frying with you guys. The good news is the gouin is about half ice free, hebert has a few days to go"
3861649,hugepike0,2015-05-11 17:46:00,28,Has anyone actually fished for pike much here? I know the walleye is reportedly very good but what about pike fishing there?
3006266,NY Walleye,2014-07-17 12:43:00,78,"Went to Lac Hebert for 7 days with three generations of walleye fisherman. Father, son and nephew. As usual with a lake this far north weather was all over the place, wind, rain, cold, warm Mother Nature couldn't figure it out. We caught 530 walleye and did not fish all that hard based on heavy windy days. The usual spots produced fish throughout the lake. Bite was very light and needed to feel for it. Worms out fished gulp ect. Biggest walleye was 25"". Couple of spots produced at ton of 18 to 20 walleye. Air Tamarac is a fansastic outfitter and runs a top notch fly in service. Camp was awesome as it was one of the newer built. Lund 16 foot boats handled the waves. Brand NEW 20hp Merc motors no concerns about getting stuck. This is a great fishery and close to NY, PA, VT and CT. Made it to Syracuse in 9.5 hours with a 155 mile dirt road. Check them out."
3006770,fishron,2014-07-17 16:36:00,317,"Isn't it always the weather that's the determining factor in a week of fishing. Hebert is a great lake, although small by some comparisons. We had a great first trip in. I hope to do it again, and fish it harder now that I have some knowledge of the lake. Air Tamarac indeed is a quality fly-in outfitter and I found the camp well cared for and what I look for to come back to after a day on the lake. Maybe we did especially well for first timers, but I won't know that until our second trip. Thanks for the report. I'm glad you got into some fish. Somewhere in the back of my mind I'll be thinking of how I'll fish Hebert next year."
3009937,octanehi5,2014-07-18 14:31:00,1104,"Its to bad you did not go out on those windy days,you missed some great fishing,That lake turns on big time in bad weather. You did not do bad for your first time out on the lake. It can get a little scary in a big chop.You will find that Air Tam is one of Quebec's top notch outfitters,For Walleye Hebert can not be beat.with the 16' Lunds, 20 hp Merc's,The well equipted cabins. Makes it a excelent place to fly into,Good luck in the future,My group is already booked for next yr. The last thing I want to see on the lake is bluebird skies,I'll take all the bad weather mother nature can send me"
3839241,octanehi5,2015-05-05 04:36:00,1104,"With the courant weather, Ice out is not far away, The spawn a little later than normal, cold water, early fishermen will have to really slow down the presentation, Pike fishing should be great for there opener, Walleye will start to pick up once the water gets into the 60's Mid June.As usual Our trip is the last full week in June 21 -28. We enjoy being able to go out anytime of day and sleigh fish, with the evening usually being off the hook(nuts), With 46 days to go My guys are chomping at the bit. A few guys we met last yr on the lake will be there and a fish fry will be in order. This is the first yr that air medivac is included,in the trip,we all are getting a little older, and you never know. Lets hear about your up coming aventures with Air Tam?"
3839929,youngknight,2015-05-05 07:31:00,228,"I gather from the op posting date that they were there around first week of July...same week I was on a trip in northeast Ontario...as much as I love a nice walleye chop and have no problem fishing in the rain, weather was so bad that week last year that constant storms...very very high winds with rain coming sideways...simply unsafe. When we flew out, the previous day had been the busiest flying day the outfitter ever had as it was the first decent day...guys were stuck in camp for up to 4 days past their scheduled departures...and of course guys stuck in town waiting to fly in...we were at least luck arrival and departure days were decent weather."
3841257,octanehi5,2015-05-05 14:27:00,1104,"sometime it does not pay to go to those big lakes,they chern up very quickly"
3841513,youngknight,2015-05-05 15:30:00,228,"Yeah, thing is,weather was so bad...likely same weather system, that my small 650 acre lake was rolling violent waves...surprising for such a small lake."
3843169,octanehi5,2015-05-06 06:24:00,1104,The good news is its ice out at the plane base in Clova
3843273,Andre (wallyandre),2015-05-06 06:45:00,2274,Even if they are a lot of clouds you can see that the Gouin is open: Marmette & Jean-pere are visible on May the 5th.
3846705,octanehi5,2015-05-07 04:13:00,1104,Sat pics from the 6th still show ice on both but starting to open up
