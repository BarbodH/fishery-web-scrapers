4903689,Redline,2016-06-06 08:17:00,73,I've had a lot of luck with Gulp Alive on Lake of the Woods. A lot of our group uses it over live bait.
4906345,bigdaddyguns,2016-06-06 19:00:00,608,"I agree, that has been my experience you have to use gulp alive or any plastics for that matter with the intent of a reaction bite. You need a more animated or aggressive vertical or horizontal presentation method to induce strikes. If the fish are in a neutral to negative mood you won't have much action dragging a jig with gulp along the bottom whereas such a technique may work with live bait. If I go to live bait it's leeches or crawlers."
4906505,bloom08,2016-06-06 19:37:00,13,Never used live bait and never had a problem catching walleye or some of my bigger pike on gulp minnows grubs or mullet. That's all I use to jig/ troll for walleye. If you know how to use a depth finder and locate your fish you will catch them.
4906521,bloom08,2016-06-06 19:43:00,13,Difference might be if you need to troll slower or faster do I stop motor in neutral for a second or two then go again or should I drag bait on bottom or pop it off bottom passively or aggressive. Or do you back troll b
4901145,Lktrician,2016-06-05 10:14:00,32,I'm going to Quebec in July and since it's no longer legal to bring minnows alive or dead can anyone tell me about their experience using GULP MINNOWS. Any help please
4901289,BornToFish,2016-06-05 11:14:00,1224,"My personal experience with GULP Alive products has been rather disappointing. I carried it with me to Canada many times and eventually just tossed it out. On the other hand, I know many guys that absolutely love the product! In fact, it's their go-to fishing bait. Most of my walleye fishing is in summer/autumn, when the bite tends to be more vertical. The fish have the luxury of time to study the bait before they bite it. I learned that I had to quickly set the hook as they wouldn't have it in their mouths very long. I suspect that the strength of GULP Alive products may be with horizontal presentations - a reaction bite - when the lure is passing by. Either they eat it or it's gone in a matter of moments. They don't have the luxury of time to study the bait. They pretty much set the hook themselves. I hope it works out okay for you. If it were me, I would take the GULP Alive product, but also crawlers and leeches. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4901329,adempsey,2016-06-05 11:33:00,963,"I like Gulp minnows. I can't say they work better than plastic grubs or the same as live minnows. They do work well for me though. However, I rarely fish with real minnows so I cannot really compare.You can buy salted minnows in Quebec. That's what I am going to do this year. Just make sure you keep your receipt and have it on you."
4901337,turtle chain,2016-06-05 11:40:00,1398,We did a test on a fly in years ago with gulp and live minnows.Hands down the minnows won even dead minnows or a minnow head beat the gulp
4901473,Ver88,2016-06-05 13:02:00,114,"I haven't used a live or dead minnow for at least 10 years in Canada and, if anything, I catch more fish now. I use soft plastics nearly all the time. I admit, I have used a crawler here and there, but that is rare for me. 3 or 4 inch curly tail grubs work great and so does just about every other plastic. It could be very different where you go, but everywhere I fish, US and Canada, soft plastics work great."
4901913,Daveygravy,2016-06-05 17:05:00,88,"Unless you are fishing an ultra clear lake, I don't see the need for live bait. I fish gulp minnows all the time and catch many walleyes. The 4 inch ones work well on a vmc jig head. I also use them on a drop shot rig. Keep it moving is the key."
4902665,dcraven,2016-06-05 19:45:00,47,"Nothing but good things to say about Gulp! Minnows. I use them here in man lot too on shallow spinner rigs. I prefer the 3"" white scissors tail minnow, but have a friend who uses the size larger in Canada with great success. Use them with confidence..."
4903361,Ruddiger,2016-06-06 06:42:00,649,"Howdy, PM sent. Take care, Ruddiger"
4903593,stumcfar,2016-06-06 07:42:00,451,"I have to say i have never seen plastic of any kind out fish live bait. We often throw something plastic on at Lac Seul because by late afternoon have ran out of bait and the bite rate drops dramatically. I am glad others have better experiences, but I think I would go hungry if I had to rely on plastic/rubber."
4903641,TheDFP,2016-06-06 08:05:00,39,"I have used gulp alive and regular gulp in Quebec. Always tipped them with a crawler. We did fly-ins and loaded the jars full. Did not notice any difference is catch rates. If you decide to use the gulp alive, I would switch out the container. The lids don't seal very well if tipped over."
