I drive a 2008 GMC Sierra and the only time I use the phone is when in NW Ontario. Mine operates as a prepaid Verizon account. It's worked perfectly over the past 6 or 7 years in the Vermilion Bay to Ear Falls area where I spend my time. Just returned home last night from a week near Perrault Falls and I could not connect with the truck phone all week. Folks at the camp were puzzled because the cell system(s) across the province have been upgraded and coverage supposedly improved.On the way home last night I called OnStar and the pleasant well informed customer service rep knew the answer before I finished explaining my problem. The new technology used to upgrade cell systems across Canada is incompatible with the phones used in GM vehicles' OnStar systems prior to a certain year (2012 or 2013??). Newer GM vehicles will have no problem in Canada.I inquired about the OnStar crash/emergency system that alerts them in case of an accident. That question had to be bumped up the ladder several levels to get an answer, but after several minutes it came back - when in Canada an older vehicle with the now incompatible phone will not alert OnStar in case of accident.Just a heads up for those with ""older"" GM vehicles. Incidentally, those in my group with Verizon smart phones had no problem getting service just south of Perrault Falls."

This is a general issue with putting short-life-cycle electronic equipment in long-life-cycle products (cars and trucks).
4902065,gapr,2016-06-05 17:31:00,192,Canada nationwide has or is in the process of discontinuing 2g / analog service. All GM vehicle owners in Canada were offered a free hardware upgrade if they subscribed to OnStar. 2014 and early 2015 vehicles received the upgrade regardless because of the 5 year OnStar remote link. In the USA there is no mandate to discontinue 2g/ analog cell service hence no hardware upgrade to digital only hardware.
4902233,Pooch,2016-06-05 18:08:00,4619,"That's why last year I ""upgraded?"" from my trusty old flip phone to a ""smart??"" phone. Got an letter from Verizon that the old flip phone would no longer work in Canada.USA is many times behind with much technology. As in cell phone and PIN for the new chipped charge cards.It never occurred to me that my old Suburban would not work either.Wonder what GM is doing if anything about it?Pooch"

4903561,JayM5209,2016-06-06 07:33:00,1050,"Thanks for replying. My issue, however, is a bit different. For several specific reasons I use a cell carrier that does not have service north of the border. That never bothered me because I could depend on my OnStar phone being reliable. Now that OnStar has abandon a large bloc of its long term customers, Bluetooth doesn't solve my problem because my iPhone uses a carrier which does not provide coverage north of the border.Anyone know of a carrier providing Canada coverage with a no contract prepaid plan? A cheap phone and a purchase of 50 minutes annually would solve my problem."

4906433,pikeman14,2016-06-06 19:13:00,144,On a side note to onstar...I did call up on star today and they said that turn-by-turn directions will work in Canada or mexico. You can leave the old Garmin at home.
4906881,bigdaddyguns,2016-06-06 22:47:00,608,Analog or AMPS 1G cell service has been decommissioned in the US since 2008 or so. All 4G phones today are backward compatible with 2G/3G technologies as well as CDMA. Some of the older Verizon hardware is more CDMA centric with no forward support for 4G and limited if any 2G/3G capability. Also the other major issue for the older on-star vehicles has to do with frequency band capability of the hardware. Newer 4G services are being offered in different frequency bands which means new hardware and software are required in order to access for those older Verizon based vehicles. I think most Canadian cell service is GSM based which limits access for older US CDMA technology.
