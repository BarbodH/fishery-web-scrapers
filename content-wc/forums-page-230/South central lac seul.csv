4892449,Bluebomber,2016-06-02 10:06:00,29,Heading up to mahkwa area 6/22. Wondering if anyone has been up there yet? How they did? Or if your heading up there and can put up a report before I go that would great! Can't wait!
4892849,MikeMcC,2016-06-02 12:20:00,72,The best info on the south central basin is the weekly fishing report from Mike Willems of SWWL.http://www.sww-lodge.com/category/fishing-report/
4893993,Bluebomber,2016-06-02 18:16:00,29,Thanks for the suggestion. I've been following swwl for the last couple of years now. I look forward to reading there reports every week. Noticed on Monday that they posted there first report. I know I've talked to guys here in years past that fish out of mahkwa... Just wondering if any have been there. Swwl is a bit to the west of where we fish but have seen there guides in bray a few times.
