I have to say that this past week's weather provided probably the coldest weather conditions I have seen in over 20 fly-ins. Rain, cold temps., and stiff winds all combined to literally and figuratively put a damper on the trip. First, our flight in to Auger was delayed for about 8 hours due to rain and low ceilings. And, I consider myself lucky to have gotten out at all yesterday with all the poor weather. Don really did yeoman work to get all his customers in and out of their outposts. This is the first trip I took with MLO, and I have nothing but great things to say about Don and his pilots. Really top notch. Auger Lake provided excellent fishing, although it was hard to stay on the lake for more than 3 hours at a time. My brother and I caught over 200 walleyes one day, and there were lots and lots of walleyes over 20"", up to 24"". This was our first time on this lake, and after doing a lot of running on the first day, we found 3 or 4 spots that were excellent all week. All we used were jigs and minnows. The 10 dozen minnows/person regulation is being enforced at MLO (since you buy your minnows right there). We were supposed to get another 20 dozen minnows flown in during the mid-week check, but we didn't get them until our last afternoon of fishing, due to Don not being able to fly for much of the week. Plastics work ""ok,"" but they don't work anywhere as well as the real thing. That was really my only complaint, but, again, with the crappy weather, I certainly understood and didn't have any reason to be upset. Bottom line--I would love to return to Auger Lake next year for sure, and would heartily endorse it to anyone. Don Elliot and his staff are great people, the fishing was excellent, and all the equipment and furnishings were well-maintained. I was very pleasantly surprised to have Don fly my brother and I in, given we were only a party of 2. Most outfitters require groups of 4 to 6. Also saw 13 bears on the last leg of the trip, eating roadside vegetation, which made for a lot of fun viewing. A few of the bears were very good sized. Can't wait for my late June trip to Clear Lake with Nestor Falls Outposts! Hope everybody traveling to Canada this summer has great fishing and great weather!"
4899105,ukcats11,2016-06-04 13:24:00,12,Great report. Sorry the weather wasn't the best. How do you keep that many minnows alive? Will the keep in a bucket that long? Or were they frozen?
4899137,adempsey,2016-06-04 13:41:00,963,"Thanks for the report. Unfortunate about the weather, it's always a crap shoot early in the season. The week before was totally unseasonable. So, you just never know. Sounds like you made the best of it anyway.They need to work out a loop hole where MLO can store minnows on site under his bait license, while only the ones in your possession are considered yours.Looking forward to reading about your next trip."
4899377,michigan walleye guy,2016-06-04 15:36:00,95,"Brought a ""bait tamer"" and a pair of minnow buckets. With the cold temps, lost very few minnows all week, and dead ones are just good as live ones. The trouble was that Don couldn't bring us our other 25 dozen due to inclement weather, until our last afternoon."
4900945,phishfearme,2016-06-05 08:51:00,1242,"good report and tough break wrt the weather - we used to do the ""memorial day"" Canada trip for years and ran into a number of these including a localized 20 inch snow storm that dropped so many trees into the various narrows that we couldn't get where we wanted to go. shortly after getting snowed in for a day in Cochrane we decided to push the ""memorial day"" trip to the ""Canada Day/July 4th"" trip and have experienced ""catching"" similar to the spring but the ""fishing"" is much more comfortable. sounds like you did well on the ""catching"" though - although the ""fishing"" must've been uncomfortable. phish"
