4913921,Wisconeye,2016-06-09 13:27:00,79,"After one incident in a boat several years ago I've pretty much outlawed any open-toe shoes when fishing. My son and I were fishing a small lake and he caught a decent 18"" largemouth. He was sitting on his boat seat trying to gracefully unhook the fish for release when the fish did a quick flop and slipped from his hand. It fell towards the floor and somehow ending up going dorsal fin down. The quill in the dorsal fin went directly through his big-toe toenail and as the fish bounced off it broke off the quill in his toe. Trust me, not only are they impossible to pull out because they are cartilage and crush under any pliers and are slippery, but the guy trying to pull it is likely to get punched due to the pain. It took a trip to the emergency room, surgery to cut off the toenail and cut the dorsal quill out of the toe. If that would have been a walleye (I imagine much worse) when on our fly-in it would have taken an emergency trip out. I could tell the pain was immense and not to mention it got worse over time-- I would imagine it's just like a northern pike tear/bite---heals slow. Weird, but true."

I'll stick with some foot cover.......Quote: not to mention it got worse over time I wonder if that isn't because of the ""protective slime"" (or whatever fish have) that ends up causing infection??"
4914193,adempsey,2016-06-09 15:38:00,963,"Stick with your Merrel's, but maybe try a better sock. A good light Merino wool hiking sock should be all you need."
4914481,bfish,2016-06-09 17:47:00,1096,"chaco z2 for me. Had the keen newport H2 and not enough padding in sole for me, although very comfortable otherwise."
4914681,forgop,2016-06-09 19:24:00,880,"I pack a pair of timberland waterproof boots for use in heavy brush if doing a portage through any terrain at all, a pair of old running shoes that dry quickly and don't care if they get ruined, a pair of water shoes, and a pair of slides.

4914873,castnblast,2016-06-09 21:13:00,111,"+1 for keen sandals. They have arch support, dry quickly and the toes are really protective. Great summer fishing / waters sandals"
4911289,1/4 oz Jig,2016-06-08 14:00:00,90,I know I'm posting in the canada forum but I know I can fish around me barefoot on the boat and not worry about swearing and swatting at my feet because of the bugs. I usually have 2 pairs of shoes i wear but was looking to see what works for others. Pair 1: merrel low waterproof hikers. Comfortable and waterproof but feet can get warm on those hot days. Pair 2: Crocs keep the feet cool but doesn't help with the flys! Also not that comfortable. What works for you? Any of you wear water shoes with no socks or do the flys just go to town on your ankles?
4911945,martinbns,2016-06-08 18:52:00,1520,"Well I play golf all summer long in ""Canada"" and my ankles survive. I suspect a non-issue on a boat."

4912153,RoughWaters,2016-06-08 20:17:00,98,I wear Keen sandals and love them. Very comfortable. If the bugs are bad I will use a little bug spray but otherwise these are all I wear during the summer while fishing.
4913289,deadhead1,2016-06-09 09:47:00,193,Shorts and sandels from May long weekend thru October long weekend. That is my rule. Except weddings and funerals. Bug spray if I need it.
4913321,grapestomper,2016-06-09 09:55:00,41,All I wear is crocs or bare feet. Bug spray as needed.
4913649,RCDuck,2016-06-09 11:33:00,18,"Keen Newport H2's are all I ever wear when the weather is nice. They're just a great all around shoe. What I really like about them is they have a good enough sole that you have no problem on shore on the rocks if you're exploring, making shore lunch, etc. I even wear them on easy day hikes in the mountains with the family, whitewater rafting, etc. It's really the only ""summer"" shoe I ever wear, and generally have the ""Keen Tan"" on my feet to prove it. If you wear them, you know what I'm talking about."
4913705,ftfarms,2016-06-09 11:48:00,444,Flip flops or bare feet.
4913745,tv4fish,2016-06-09 12:07:00,2694,"White socks and a pair of lightweight ""air flow"" type of fabric tennis shoes. Keeps the feet cool - if it rains - a pair of slip-on rubber boots go right over the tenny shoes."
4913801,1/4 oz Jig,2016-06-09 12:31:00,90,I like the comfort of keen shoes. Might have to give they're sandals a try. Just might have to put on some bug spray or coppertone on the feet
