4895129,Bigredmf,2016-06-03 07:22:00,129,Octane thanks for the description on the DRR I have never seen a walleye spit its bladder but will me fishing later this year and will use this if neededRedSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

4897801,Hookhunter135,2016-06-04 06:01:00,129,Thank you I imagine on a body of water that big it can get rough
4898385,Guest,2016-06-04 09:22:00,0,"That circled oval red area is HUGE ! when you actually see it from a boats perspective. No need to head that far south to find deep water, the large point at about 2 o'clock is very deep and produces walleye. This area gets huge waves when the wind is south or north."
4898441,Hookhunter135,2016-06-04 09:32:00,129,2 o'clock from the large red circles area or 2 o'clock from my camp?
4898633,Freytown,2016-06-04 10:24:00,770,"That circled area is a narrow pass/passage way (Passe Kaopatinak) which connects to baies Saraana, Mattawa, Hanotaux and Poisson. This is traveled by many fisherman.If you look at my map/attachment there is a scale on the lower right.Yes, the Gouin can get rough....can get is the key word..........use your head.I use the depth finders to alert me that depth is changing. Being a compound, the reservoir has many rocky hazards...use your head and take it easy. I'm 68 now and started at the Gouin when I was 30....I'm still alive. Common sense is all you need. Too rough, stay in the small coves, there's hundreds of them.You'll be fine...enjoy your trip. FT"
4890073,Freytown,2016-06-01 15:58:00,770,"Plamondon is too shallow to find walleyes near shore in August. In August they may be near shore early and late if deep water is near...real close by. Since your cabin is not near deep water...don't waste your time fishing for walleye near the shore. Been there, done that."
4890217,Hookhunter135,2016-06-01 16:41:00,129,Ok the navionics sonar map looks to show a channel going east from my cabin that reaches up to 30 feet and it looks to me as though there are pockets of 20 to 30 feet of water east of cabin. I will look to concentrate on those areas
4890425,bloom08,2016-06-01 17:28:00,13,Make sure you bring lots of gulp minnows and grubs. Pink orange black neon green and white with various jig head weight sizes. Heading to larouche with Oliver this yr Vern going with Caesars since 2003 off and on.
4890465,bloom08,2016-06-01 17:40:00,13,Also another note. Lake Herbert is great fishing and there camps are top notch. Both Tamarac and Caesars fly out of clova. Difference is Caesars cabins are secluded and you don't see anybody else on his private lakes bc there are no other cabins and mostly likely his gouin cabins also. Tamarac you have numerous cabins with you if they are booked. As of now not his Charlotte cabin. Make sure you weigh everything before you leave. Make food menu so no food left at end. If you need list of clothes and my check list for things pm me bc if your first trip you will bring everything which you won't need.

4891633,Freytown,2016-06-02 06:04:00,770,See the pic attached. I have fished outside of Plamondon over 15 yrs and the area circled was always a good walleye producer. You are going to love that area. Don't leave home without a fish finder.
4891689,octanehi5,2016-06-02 06:30:00,1104,"The Gouin can be very differant from yr to yr.Water level and rate of flow is key, Water is aways moving due to the power station it was built for.In the spring water levels are higher and water temps are lower,producing walleye in shallow water very near were they spawn in the feeding rivers and streams on the west end of the gouin, They will be coming off of spawn very soon.As summer takes over waters warm,The fish move deeper average 24' deep during the day,coming Shallow to feed at night, In the fall the waters are usually at their lowest levels and highest temps, Fish are in the deepest pools And the bite is sporadic due to the fact its much harder to fish in 30+' of water and keep the jigs on the bottom at least 1/2oz jigs are recommended or anchor in a deep spot. catching fish in water over 30' deep will require you to have a device to get the fish back down to that depth very quickly or they will die ,do not pin prick the bladder this will also kill the fish. I have caught walleyes in as deep as 64' of water,get them back down with a sinker rig then release,never to have them float back up and die,If they do harvest those fish. Good luck on the Gouin"
4892041,Bigredmf,2016-06-02 08:05:00,129,Octanehi5More info on your sinking releasing rig pleaseThank you RedSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
4892401,Hookhunter135,2016-06-02 09:54:00,129,FreytownDo you think from where Gouin 2 is that it's feasible for me to make it to the location you circled on the map. The depth maps show some nice channels of 30 foot watersI believe Caesars provides us with 16 foot boats with 10 horsepower motors. Not really sure what the distance is
4892753,a3dad,2016-06-02 12:08:00,115,It's 8.5 miles from your camp to the middle of that circle. very do-able.
4883409,octanehi5,2016-05-31 05:18:00,1104,"Walleyes will be deep during the day and come shallow at night,moving water is a plus,Find the deepest pools and you will catch Walter. Paddletails cast into rocks at night,The bigger the chop on the lake the better the fishing,Fish wind blown shores"
4886025,Hookhunter135,2016-05-31 15:58:00,129,Thanks so much for the tips. So early morning and late evening I can work on casting in the shallows? As morning progresses and throughout the day would you say vertical jigging in deep pockets would be a good tactic?Never fished for walleye before I was raised on PA trout streams. Thanks for all the help
4886049,Hookhunter135,2016-05-31 15:59:00,129,I really want to catch some pike as well I'm hoping where the walleye are I'll find some nice pike as well
4886089,fishron,2016-05-31 16:15:00,317,"Hookhunter, there are indeed some good pike possibilities on Hebert. Last year I hooked a walleye off an Island and had it grabbed by what had to be a large pike, although I could never raise him near the surface to see how big he was. He finally released the walleye after a few minutes of doing exactly what he wanted to do. Hebert's pike in late June are oriented to its shoals and islands. I caught quite a few last year on paddletails and unfortunately lost my best on a defective snap. One thing that I saw for the first time were pike sipping emerging large mayflies on one of the shoals we were fishing. We spend much more time on walleye fishing, but good pike fishing is also to be had. It's a beautiful lake with exciting possibilities. Good Luck!"
4886193,Hookhunter135,2016-05-31 16:47:00,129,Thanks for the tip my family will be on a west bay of the Gouin for my first trip. We will be there beginning of August. I downloaded the navionics app and have been looking over the depths of different parts of the Gouin that I will be on. There are multiple pockets and channels of 30 to 60 feet. I'm hoping to target them for daytime walleye fishing. Then it seems to transition up into a shallow bay right by my cabin so I am thinking that may be a good evening spot. I am looking to take a group of my good buddies up next season and Hebert seems to be the places we are looking at
4886457,Bigredmf,2016-05-31 17:56:00,129,I have caught some huge pike (20+#) jigging for eyes.With no leader as well but had far more bite offs Vs landed fish.If there are Walleye schooled up you can bet there are Northerns looming.RedSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
4887657,octanehi5,2016-06-01 04:49:00,1104,"Afew yrs. back we were Walleye fishing at bay du nord,we had a nice stringer of 8 walleyes hanging in the water on the side of the boat.We started to get ready to head back to camp for dinner,I went to pull the stringer out of the water and it pulled back very hard,this time I grabbed it very close to the water,then with a good hard pull lifted the stringer out of the water.On the last walleye was the biggest pike I ever saw, His head was at my shoulder and tail still in the water,All of our guys were in awe,as big around as one of my thighs,over 50"" She never let go of that fish,just fell back into the water as it shredded that walleye it looked like a thin ribbon. I now have a lot of respect for fish with teeth,And do not swim in the Gouin. Good luck on the Gouin it a great fishery"
4887673,Hookhunter135,2016-06-01 05:03:00,129,Wow that's insane. I am very excited about this trip. I just hope I have done my homework enough to make it a successful one
4888041,a3dad,2016-06-01 06:48:00,115,"Hey HookHunter, I've fished Plamondon many times out of Air Tam #40/41. If you have any specific questions ask away. As others have said Plamondon is not very deep and you may need to search for deeper water which usually means bigger water. Depending on chop it can be a bit rough. The Gouin is a very large body of water and the coves all tend to look the same after a while. It's very easy to get lost if you venture far away from camp. I'd recommend using a GPS if you have one. I can supply waypoints if you need. Your camp is in a very nice location at the bottom of the bae. You will enjoy it there. Kevin"
4888697,vteye,2016-06-01 09:50:00,812,Congrats on the first fly in Gouin is beautiful. One quick suggestion is to bring a swim suit. One of our trips had temps in high 90's and found a nice white sandy beach to spend mid day.
4878785,Hookhunter135,2016-05-29 08:45:00,129,Hey GuysI am doing my first fly in the second week of August. I will be on the Gouin with Caesars North camps. I'll be in a cabin that's in the bay's west of Air Tamarac Cabins 40/41. Any advice for fishing that time of year or area would be great. It's a father son trip and a first time for all of us. I've taken over as our camp leader and am trying to collect as much information as I can. I will be taking care of preparing us for this trip.
4878961,Freytown,2016-05-29 10:52:00,770,"What camp.....Gouin 1,2,3 or 4???"
4879025,Hookhunter135,2016-05-29 11:22:00,129,I am going to Gouin 2
4879033,Hookhunter135,2016-05-29 11:23:00,129,Gouin 2
4879137,Freytown,2016-05-29 12:21:00,770,"Gouin 2 is in back side (west) of Baie Plamondon. In August walleye (and Pike) are usually in the 30-35 ft depths. You may have to go east past Air Tamarac's cabins to find deeper water. Jigs tips with worms are a good bait. I have never been in that back bay, but I have fish east of Air Tamarac's cabins and have done well."
4879185,Hookhunter135,2016-05-29 13:01:00,129,Thanks. What do you use for pike in deeper water?
4880545,Freytown,2016-05-30 06:16:00,770,"Normally, I only target walleye and always caught the pike in deeper water too (with jigs). But pike will still be in shallow water too....sorry for the confusion."
4880913,tweedrules,2016-05-30 08:22:00,107,"Oliver is a great guy and a good outpost person to deal with. He's been in the business along time starting with he parents at Caesars Lodge. He will be very helpful. I totally agree with freytow, the walleye's will be in deeper water in August but you can find them in 15-30 foot drop offs and holes. Jig and a worm works best. But don't rule out trolling with thin fins, hot n tots and deeper divers. Make sure you have a good gps/depth unit. A lithium battery (not cheap though) should get you through the week because I assume you can't charge at Gouin 2. We use mostly half wave spoons just outside weedbeds for pike. Look it up on the lucky strike website. We use 3'' but bigger will work as well. You'll catch fish and have a great time. Love the Gouin. We are going for 12 years straight."
4882441,Hookhunter135,2016-05-30 17:55:00,129,What type of gps depth unit would you recommend. Thanks for the helpful tips
4883321,tweedrules,2016-05-31 04:37:00,107,The model that we bought has been discontinued. We bought an eagle cuda. There are many travel models available from Bass pro or cabelas. Try to find one that has Canadian Lakes built in.
