1334937,Larry Mac,2011-07-28 12:28:00,530,"Hi Kruger, Went to Madison Lake in June and we were allowed 100 lbs per person for all gear and food. Interesting this is that they weighed us and then adjusted our total weight from there. They gave us an extra 60 lbs but fortunately we did not need it. There was another group who after they weighed in they had to reduce their weight limit, as one of them was an extremely large individual. We were not aware of this policy in advance. Have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1335147,JayM5209,2011-07-28 21:53:00,1050,"This has been an interesting thread and I've gotten some good ideas to try. My group of 5 or 6 (no fly-ins, only drive to) plans to have walleye for dinner every night except Friday. Saturday - Thursday is always fish, usually walleye but if they're slow there's always jumbo perch, a laker, or (ugh) northern. Friday is leftovers night before packing for an early morning departure. In 42 or 43 trips over the past 32 years I do not remember a single evening (except Fridays) without fish for dinner. It simplifies food planning/packing/refrigerating to not haul meat products along.Two observations to add: 1) Several years ago a new member of the group looked at us as we sat down to Saturday evening's walleye dinner and said, with incredulity, ""What, you guys don't use paper and plastic?"" That was a good wake-up slap up side the head. Ever since we use paper plates and plastic forks/knives. A major improvement and time saver with the evening clean up chores. 2) Another group member and I always do the menu planning and grocery shopping. Several years ago we just told everyone in the group that they were responsible for buying and bringing any beverages they needed for the week (soda, bottled water, whatever) as well as any snack stuff they wanted in their boat or when sitting around after return to camp each day. There's always enough, everyone gets what they like, and the two of us doing the shopping don't have to guess what others want."

Just a question on transporting eggs - I was thinking about scrambling eggs in a plastic container and freezing to transport. Has anyone had any experience with this? Seems like it might be easier than worrying about broken eggs, and cheaper than egg substitutes."

Leaving tomorrow with Showalters and here are some additional items to consider. We take quite a bit of rice and dehydrated potatoes... keeps weight down and we all like it. Instant oatmeal with dehydrated fruit and walnuts for breakfast most days.... quick healthy and delicious. Venison always makes the trips..loins and jerky and lately a large pork loin with the leftovers made into bean soup for the last day. Also the high end packaged chicken soups and chilis are great with burger and canned chicken for quick meal. Fish everyday, slaw and beans and since we cheeseheads...beer and 2 pounds of high end cheese. I more thing..something about bit o honeys that makes the trip! Have fun!"
4901313,adempsey,2016-06-05 11:28:00,963,"I know people who do that, so you should be fine freezing them. I just brought them in the container they came in, no problems. You can always buy one of those solid plastic egg cartons made for camping as well."

1334646,10lbeye,2011-07-27 20:06:00,61,"As a 30 yr+ veteran of canada trips, and being camp cook and trip organizer as well, here's what I have learned: 1. Plan a menu for the entire week and every day. Go over the menu with your group and agree upon it beforehand to avoid the ""well, I don't eat______"" factor at camp. Agree on a list of snacks that guys like as well. If you cook breakfast, plan on alternating eggs and pancakes every day, for example. It's safe to plan for at least one fish meal (or maybe 2) per week. But have a backup plan/meal if fishing is too slow. Hang the menu up so the gang knows what you're eating and when. This will avoid someone eating all the carrots that you planned to go into a meal or side dish or salad, for example. 2. Push the easy button when it comes to meals. Chicken breasts and rice is quick and easy. One pot meals are convenient too. For ex, a 3-4 lb slab of ham, some cabbage, potatoes. carrots, and a can of diced tomatoes makes for an easy meal. So does chicken and sausage (and possibly walleye thrown in to) jambalaya. A few pork tenderloins are a lighter and easier alternative than pork chops if you're worried about weight restrictions. For spaghetti dinner, make your sauce before you go and freeze it flat in a ziplock bag. Same for soup. A frozen bag of soup comes in real handy for lunch if you have a run of cold or bad weather, or as a backup if the fish dinner goes by the wayside. We eat a lot of rice as a side dish because its lightweight and quick to make and if you have a gluten free fellow in your party it's an alternative to noodles... 3. Have something simple planned for dessert once or twice. a box of instant brownies is easy. so is a fresh sliced pineapple. My guys seem to crave sweets about mid week and every year the fresh pineapple is a huge hit. 4. The cook should do all the shopping. period. Do not divide the shoppping responsibilities. A prescription for disaster. Had a few situations where certain folks were to ""get some great steaks,"" and promptly left them at home, or forgot, etc. The cook should do all the shopping. 5. Kids are the X factor. They will destroy the snacks in record time so just remember that and take it into account... 6. Ask your better half for help! My wife has been a great help with menu and shopping suggestions over the years. I have a std menu and grocery list and will be happy to share it if you want. Good luck!!!"

1334676,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-27 21:26:00,1460,"1st night fish. With that I'll make a enormous amount of baked Beans and pasta salad so as to use the leftovers all week shore lunches and the like.Bucks Baked Beans:5 can baked beans drained, Ketchup, brn.sugar, diced onion, diced jalapeno, pound bacon.I make 5 boxes pasta salad. Kick it up with green onion, salami, and cheese.I store them in ziplock bags for ease."
1334693,SinOrSwim,2011-07-27 22:14:00,1528,"Simple doesn't have to mean blah food imo. Which seems like a lot of people do? Simple can mean a lot of preparation. Granted, MorganMan does all our prep but it makes a huge difference. For instance, if we do breakfast pizza the sausage and bacon is cooked and put in zip lock bags prior to going up. He browns and crumbles a couple of large bags of bacon. We then take bacon bits with us for shore lunch and add some bacon crumbles to a fish taco. For either the breakfast pizza or pizza at night you can pre-cook or pre-slice what you are going to use. Get the Boboli pizza crust. No mess no fuss and takes up very little space. Just pull it out put on some sauce and whatever you want. It's easy to do buffalo chicken if you take up pre-shredded chicken. BBQ chicken pizza is always a hit as well. You have big deep fryers. Take a big bag of frozen wings. Use them as ice in your coolers and fry em up. To each their own but there is nothing better than walleye caught within an hour or two of cooking it. I'm sort of surprised how many people only have 2 or 3 fish meals? We have fish with each meal. Not necessarily the main thing but it is so good why not?Shore lunch, use a zip lock bag to mix your fish batter in. Less dishes. Take a couple aprons with you as well."
1334836,Kruger,2011-07-28 08:55:00,259,"Do they really do that? Before I went on my diet, I was up to 290."

1333452,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-24 18:41:00,1460,Like those red and white boat ideas for shore lunch tacos.On cold day lunch at the cabin we like:Walleye Chesterfield (my brother named it)Bake seasoned(cajun) fillets @400 for about 5 minutes. Mix 3 part mayo to 1 part dijon mustard and spread on fillet after flipping. Top with sharp cheddar and broil till done.Healthy alternative to fryed.
1333524,TIGHTLINER,2011-07-25 05:27:00,223,THERE ARE ENOUGH SUGGESTIONS ON THIS POST TO GET A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT MIGHT WORK FOR A WEEK. THERE WAS A POST ON WC SEVERAL MONTHS BACK THAT HAD LOT MORE OFFERINGS. JUST REMEMBER ON A FLY IN YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR WEIGHT DOWN SO ANYTHING YOU CAN PURCHASE THAT HAS TO BE MIXED WITH WATER WILL WORK. NOODLE RONI- RICE A RONI-CRYSTAL LITE-CORNBREAD MIX.. ONE THING WE STARTED IS CINNABUNS POPPED IN THE OVEN GO OVER GOOD FOR A DIFFERENT BREAKFAST. ALSO CRESENT ROLLS TAKE ABOUT 13 MIN INSTEAD OF BREAD IF SPACE IS NEEDED. HERE IS A RECIPE TO MAKE IF YOU CAN GET SOMEONE TO GIVE UP A CAN OF BEER. 3 CUPS OF SELF RISING FLOUR 1/2 CUP OF SUGAR AND ONE CAN OF BEER MIX THIS TOGETHER PUT IN A BREAD PAN FOR 50 MIN /TIME COULD VARY DEPENDING ON OVEN / GOES GOOD WITH ANY EVENING MEAL BUTTER ALWAYS MAKES IT BETTER. THIS IS GOOD FOR TOAST IN THE AM.
1333667,Guest,2011-07-25 11:54:00,0,"On a 7-day trip we like to take at least 3-4 different evening meals. I agree with the soft shell taco's suggestion and we also usually take some type of venison stew. spaghetti and meatballs etc. etc..We always have one 'steak-night"" that we have at the end of the week. Nothing like a good rib-eye to cap off the week. One of the things we do is make the stew and other meals ahead of time and then freeze them. We then put the frozen food on top of the crawlers we take up to help reduce weight and keep the crawlers fresh on the 14-16 hour drive. I also do this with the eggs. I whisk a dozen eggs with a little milk and then freeze them for the trip up. Our cabins have plenty of freezer space and I just take the eggs and meals out the night before we use them. Good way to limit weight and space for our flight.."
1333687,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-25 12:44:00,1460,"This year I got a full tenderloin from costco. Trimmed it nice. Cut into 8 portions at least 2"" thick. Wrap with thick peppered bacon. Everybody was able to eat their tenderloin at this point of the week(last night). Went over well at my camp and is practical, easy to do."
1333815,MorganMan,2011-07-25 18:33:00,341,I travel with SinOrSwim and we usually fly in so weight is indeed and issue. We usually repackage some things in smaller quatities that we use and cut up things ahead of time and freeze before taking. Buy things in plastic rather than glass if possible. We have gotten very efficient with our packing so we can fit more beer in the plane!!
1334158,kansasity,2011-07-26 13:35:00,80,"Boy, you guys are planning on catching alot of fish if you eat that much walleye. What if they aren't biting? That happens you know, I suppose you could eat your bait! As for the guy who suggested sea food, or chicken, I would think that those could spoil easily. The guys that I am going with this year usually take steak, pork chops, hot dogs, sausages, stuff like that. They usually come in around 2 or 3 and have their big meal cause when you come in at dark the last thing you probably want to do is cook and clean after a long day of fishing. Then after getting there tummys full head back out and take some snacks with them. Plus beverages are gonna play a roll in this if you are a drinker. Have fun."
1334204,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-26 15:10:00,1460,"We ALWAYS have a first night fish fry. We bring in 1 can of klic(spam). for those who can't catch fish. Never have had to open it up. We ALWAYS have fish for lunch every day. Never had to do the bait thing. But hey Kansascity, try putting a salted minnow on a triscuit or eat your sausage. The walleye is never better not to have each day! You can always eat your hot dogs and sausage in Kansas City but you can have fresh caught walleye, only while you are on your trip. Some guys like me and Sinorswim, Joeman, Ogoki have had walleye prepared many ways. It is good to share ideas of differently prepared walleye. It just doesn't get any better."
1334231,MorganMan,2011-07-26 16:49:00,341,"We have been going for 18 years and have never once been without fish for a meal (lunch and dinner). With that said, we are going somewhere new this year and we haven't gone yet.......so jinx it up!!!"
1334274,SinOrSwim,2011-07-26 18:53:00,1528,"Yes, for years we took extra food in case we didn't catch enough fish. We stopped doing that because we have never had any problems. Some days are obviously better than others but we have always caught plenty to eat. Granted, we keep in close contact with the other boats in the group because a few of them may have gone hungry had we not kept ""their"" share. LOL! We have had many days where we struggled to catch fish small enough to eat. That is a good problem to have. Having said that, we do have some meals that don't need as many walleye for them. For instance, the cajun seafood pasta. We can always sub those meals if we had problems."
1334430,kansasity,2011-07-27 08:35:00,80,"Well hopefully the few little tricks I have up my sleeve like soaking my plastics in scent will give us a edge. I went with a couple of guys a few years back to a lodge they had been to alot and the weather changed on us the day we arrived and we coudnt hardly make them bite in all the spots they new of. I have done alot of map reading and am using google earth to mark some spots at Lount lake where we are going this year. The guys I'm going with have only been there once before, last year. Pikeslayer, you must go quite a bit? I've only been twice, but the guys I go with have been going for about 30 yrs. We have 8 in our group this year so hopefully one out of our 4 boats can find a good spot! Good luck you guys! 36 days and counting!"

1202687,5richards,2010-05-21 16:41:00,131,I'll take a small stab at the list --- we always get a pre-cooked ham -- this can be sliced for sandwiches or used w/egg-beaters for breakfast -- pasta --it's easy-- and you can load up on the carbs -- whatever sauce you want in a plastic jar --- buy some frozen packaged meals in aluminum -- lasagna -- chicken etc --- that will cover 2or 3 nights -- leftovers go a long way -- fish -- walleye is to die for -- get some good fry mix -- personal preference -- check with wife or girlfriend -- she'll know --- figure 2 dinners of fish --- lunch and food in the boat is the critical issue --- the ham works well for us -- I eat leftover fried walleye in the boat -- my sons think I've lost it --- pband j -- not my favorite but in plastic --- come on guys some help here

All the stuff I don't normally eat at home . The other meals are WALLEYE, baked beans, fried potatoes ( sometimes we boil potatoes and refrigerate , later you can slice and brown for quicker meals). For stacks we have jerky, summer sausage , various types of crackers and 2 or 3 kinds of cheese. We have fish everyday. Depending on where we are fishing we have a very large breakfast , a big meal of fish mid afternoon a little snooze and back on the water from 5 or 6 until dark which around 11:00 pm in June . Back at the cabin we snack and fry a little more walleye. I go to catch numbers of walleye and eat walleye . ...........We have taken a ham like another stated and you can do much with that too , fry at breakfast , make sandwiches etc. I like the boiled potatoes as you put some in your cooler and take along when doing a shore lunch as they don't take long to brown . ...............Mid week we always have pizza one night for a little change . Buy the pre mix dough and add water , couple cans pizza sauce , smoked sausage , cheese, canned mushrooms etc for topping . Bake them in cast iron skillets lined with tin foil. .............Instead of potate chips take Pringles as they don't ake up much space . ............Take box of mac and cheese or something similar ..........If you have never put together food for a fly-in make a list from what the guys posted here and make a grocery run . Put the stuff in boxes and as you think about it add to your list and make another run . My wife has a list that we have kept and modified for over 20 years . ................"
1203170,dcraven,2010-05-23 15:44:00,47,"I've done quite a bit of trip planning for fly outs, canadian trips or BWCA trips. Depending on family preferences, weight restrictions, great options include: Breakfast - instant pancake mix/syrup/butter, bacon/eggs, egg/bacon/sausage tortilla/wraps, dry cereal or oatmeal and toast. Noon meals are usually lighter such as sandwiches/wraps/PBJ sandwiches, shorelunch and potato chips. I've usually planned for one warm meal per day that is pre cooked and frozen (also acts as ice in the coolers). If it is a cold, rainy day, this may turn into your noon meal. Examples: stew, chili, lasagna, wild rice soup/crackers, sloppy joes. Another option to fried fish is grilling fish in aluminum foil. Trout and pike are great this way - 35 min. over the grill or in hot coals. Basically, make a fish pizza - onions, bacon bits, mayonaise/mozza cheese, lemon pepper, onions and butter. If you don't like a butter base, italian dressing does well, too. This is a nice option to frying."
1203639,labsrus,2010-05-24 19:53:00,557,"On our last trip we took the metal pie irons and made Mountain Pies Two pieces of bread, lightly buttered Sauce Cheese Mushrooms Sausage and Pepperoni Cook in coals until bread is golden brown Made a nice treat when it was raining out, we made a fire in the wood stove in the cabin."

I will incorporate this awesome walleye dish.My list has evolved over the years. I always take the master copy with me for notes every year. I've got it down to the last egg! One thing we do now that we havn't in the past is eliminate the big breakfast for a fresh fruit, yogurt, granola. Swifter on the water and with all the heavy lunch and evening meals. Well, you know"
1333115,Nimstug,2011-07-23 13:51:00,2605,"Nothing against pbj, but a great alternative is PGH-peanut butter and honey."
1333414,oleJoe,2011-07-24 16:21:00,114,"Pancakes and ham or bacon and eggs for breakfast. No lunch and big supper at 4 or 5. Fish and french fries if they have a fish fryer, bean or dried Lipton pastas or rice. 2 pkgs will feed 6 adults and then its spagetti for the change. Make the sauce and freeze it in plastic container and 2 lbs of spagetti will feed 6 adults. Snacks is jerky, pretzels chips and dip. They all go good with the beer."
1333435,SinOrSwim,2011-07-24 17:43:00,1528,"We only take stuff for about 2 breakfasts as we only do a big breakfast if it's raining etc. Otherwise, we take a box of breakfast bars to take out on the lake with us. Lunch is always walleye shore lunch. We cut the fish into strips, then batter and cook. Then, use a flour tortilla and make a taco. Can take bags of shredded lettuce, slice an onion etc. You can use wing sauce, ranch, tartar etc. If you want a fancy taco fry the tortilla and make a crunchy shell. My favorite is baja tacos. Essentially, sour cream with adobo or chipotle pepper mixed in with some shallot and lime juice. Or spicy garlic wing sauce from buffalo wild wings with a little ranch. We use Zatarains Seasoned Fish Fri. There are many styles of Zatarains so make sure you don't get plain cornmeal. Dinner is anything from steaks with walleye, walleye chowder, cajun seafood pasta with walleye and my favorite is the seafood/walleye Chimichangas. Simply awesome. Basically, get yourself a chimi recipe and add your seafood. Roll up in a tortilla and fry them. We started using tortillas because we got tired of eating plain fish planks. But, buns are too difficult to not squish. Tortillas are very light weight, don't need refrigerated and make for easy eating at shore lunch without forks etc. Google paper food tray and you will see those red and white boats.Go to sams and buy some of those paper boats like they serve stuff in at drive in restaurants etc. Holds better than plates and are very light weight."
