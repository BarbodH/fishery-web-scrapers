4888817,prov1800,2016-06-01 10:42:00,5010,Iam sure if you have to drive that far your fishing where i dont think you need any live bait.
4888905,Fishoil,2016-06-01 11:04:00,1277,I agree with you 100% but some of the less experienced and/or older guys in our group just don't get the idea of fishing with plastic on a jig. We have a pretty large group so there's always a few.
4903625,JOELP,2016-06-06 07:51:00,4,"With a couple of weeks behind us now, are there any more reports on the recent enforcement of dead bait limits going across the border? Is the enforcement being done by the actual border guards or are they passing you off the MNR for the check? We're heading up in a couple weeks and in our 10+ years of crossing, we have never been searched so we are just wondering what to expect and if we need to allow a lot of extra time for this. Thanks."
4903657,Guest,2016-06-06 08:14:00,0,"We crossed last Friday May 27th. We had the normal list of questions. Where you going, how much alcohol, any firearms, then we got to bait.. I told the nice lady there we had frozen chubs (my standard answer for many years) and she says ""Frozen Chubs?"" Starts writing and then hands us a written ticket and says pull down under the awning for inspection. We had about 50 chubs total for 3 guys. Long story short, we were searched for only our 2nd time in 41 years. They were very respectful but basically the entire thing was about the chubs. Once they found them, they asked how many we thought we had.. I told them the 50 and that was it. They did go thru bags, boxes, etc. Also checked our booze. But clearly the inspection was about the baits."

(honest question)We get minnows from a trapper in Iowa, drop them in borax then freeze. We freeze a dozen or so in a small sandwich bag. We store them in the deep freezer at camp then when we use they slowly thaw throughout the day. The borax holds the minnow together. Without borax the minnow would fall apart."
4882889,BubbaB,2016-05-30 20:03:00,41,"The 2016 Ontario fishing regulations say each person can have a maximum of 120 baitfish (caught or purchased), plus 120 leeches (caught or purchased), plus 36 crayfish, plus 12 northern leopard frogs.I'm sure the intent of the law is to cover LIVE bait. However, the wording just says ""bait"". So the typically asinine Ontario MNR has decided to include dead bait in their interpretation of the law - probably at the urging of lodge owners and local bait dealers.Next thing you know you'll be limited to 120 plastic tails because the MNR will consider them ""bait"" as well."
4883801,5thsuit,2016-05-31 07:14:00,54,Looks like if you fly into a remote lake for a week your minnows might last half a week? Where we go there is no live bait and no mid week check.
4883953,Fishoil,2016-05-31 07:45:00,1277,Our group has the same problem with a drive in camp - no bait available there and a 100+ mile drive to get any. Why is it that every year they have to come up with a new way of making it difficult to take a fishing trip up there? Every time something like this happens I start to wonder if it's worth all the worry and hassle or if I should just stay stateside. After over 25 years of trips north I'll probably still come but one of these times it just might be enough....
4884153,LoDo,2016-05-31 08:22:00,721,"Right! Whats next, transgender restrooms? oh wait...."
4887641,english bob,2016-06-01 04:35:00,14,"I think it needs an official written response from the Ontario MNR to confirm that the limits also apply to dead bait, particularly if it is sourced in the USA and being brought into Ontario from there.The 2016 Ontario fishing regulations state:'Anglers with a valid recreational fishing licence may capture their own bait for personal use as follows:' - see attached.To take this verbatim, USA fishermen need to have a valid Ontario licence to bring any quantity of bait into Ontario? We get our licences from the outfitter when we arrive in Red Lake."
4887729,Pooch,2016-06-01 05:23:00,4619,"What the MNR says is OK and what the Border Patrol says is OK are two different things.I wanted to bring back in salted leeches from past Canada trips and contacted the MNR and they said it was OK with them, but at the border they would not let me and I had to go back into the USA and dump them and then cross into Canada. Not a big deal, but a little embarrassing when I thought I was doing it ""right"". To me, it's just confusing as to what is accepted or unaccepted. I think most everyone wants to comply, but what is and what isn't seems to sometimes be a moving target when two agencies are involved.Pooch"
4888185,tv4fish,2016-06-01 07:26:00,2694,"From what statement are you getting that?? Under ""import of bait"" it just says what you cannot import or bring into Canada?? We - along with MANY other US fishermen have been bringing nightcrawlers into Canada in Buss Bedding for over 30 years with no problems....."
4888441,3M TA3,2016-06-01 08:23:00,2846,"Bob. The quote you provided does not contain all the information to determine legality here. Only Ontario Residents may capture their own bait fish for personal use.... as far as the remainder goes ""It is illegal to bring any crayfish, salamanders, live fish or leeches into Ontario for use as bait."" That's ver bait im."

4864281,gaspumper,2016-05-23 14:10:00,73,The reason the limit was put on salted minnows was to reduce the amount of emerald shiners being decimated from the lakes.There where hundreds of bushels if not thousands of bushels of emeralds shiners from Lake Simcoe alone being salted.
4864369,MikeG1,2016-05-23 14:22:00,434,"This doesn't make sense to me...If it was true, then make the limit from that lake. I'd like to see some documentation of this reason! I buy mine from a dealer who obtains them from lake Erie. And, what about salted fatheads that are raised for the sole purpose of being bait? How does that affect minnows being harvested from a lake?"
4864377,kzoofisher,2016-05-23 14:26:00,5144,"Ha ha, I get it. Because all worms are LGBT. Good one."
4865113,Guest,2016-05-23 18:38:00,0,That argument I could possibly give credence too.(but it sounds far fetched IMO). It does not address the import of preserved minnows..... Feel-good BS legislation at its best IMHO......
4880009,LoDo,2016-05-29 21:31:00,721,What if two guys are driving from the states with all the bait to meet six guys flying into Red Lake. Are you saying the two that are crossing via vehicle are only able to bring salted bait for themselves? The six that cross via plane are SOL and forced to purchase from a Red Lake bait shop. That's annoying!
4880361,Pooch,2016-05-30 05:03:00,4619,"That's how our fall group will be effected, too. Not flying, but coming from different directions and meeting up to fish together.That said, I don't see how Canada can do it any other way.I still wonder the ""why"" of it. People bringing in large numbers of frozen minnows then selling them without a license or some variation of that?I know trapping is hard work, but the price of live minnows has hit my ""ouch"" factor. I find myself using more and more fake bait, but I truly love live bait fishing.Various bait restrictions back and forth across the border have always been there. Just gotta be more flexible in our choice of baits. We went through this with leeches years ago.Remember the book ""Who moved my cheese""? Kind of like that......Pooch"
4880993,Huntindave,2016-05-30 08:58:00,2194,"I see no reason why salted minnows could not be brought in by plane. Each person brings their own bait, pretty simple."
4882257,LoDo,2016-05-30 16:46:00,721,"Simple? Simple is the group we meet with all the bait that drive through Int Falls and we meet in Red Lake. Not simple is the six that fly from Denver to Winnipeg to Red Lake, stay the night then jump on a float plane from Red Lake to our cottage in Woodland Caribou Prov Park w/ an additional cooler or two, dry ice and 100 doz minnows. Its not that it can't be done, but knowing the past 20 years we've not had to worry about this, makes this trip less simple. Lastly, several airlines are not fans of dry ice."
4882657,Huntindave,2016-05-30 18:44:00,2194,"I must be missing something, I did not realize that salted minnows needed any refrigeration. I see salted minnows hanging on pegboard hooks in bait shop and fishing departments all the time. Are these not the same? (honest question)"
4857425,v-bay gord,2016-05-21 06:37:00,3168,"True, it will affect those that are doing nothing wrong. Unfortunately not doing anything isn't the answer either. If the bait you trap comes out of a lake with an invasive such as spiny water flea, and you fish another water body.....well, you are possibly moving that invasive without even knowing it. It's all a matter of trying to put a control on movement of bait. It's one step short of no live bait at all."
4857609,Fisherman Ted,2016-05-21 07:49:00,461,"But anyone dipping a net and catching their own bait has no oversight and hence one could be moving around invasive species without their knowledge. The bait shops are much more closely monitored and regulated. Yes, it would be a pain to have to use them in some situations but they are looking at the bigger picture and wanting to protect entire fisheries."
4857649,wmd,2016-05-21 08:00:00,388,Without having to count individually is there a way to determine 10 dozen salted minnows ? wmd
4857673,pjshorthorn,2016-05-21 08:08:00,5654,"I've been scratching my head with a similar thought. Are they going to pull you over and make you count them out or is it an eyeball thing ? My guess is that border agents would prefer to see the bait packaged in dozen increments,but that would be quite a pain in the behind to do so. PjShorthorn."
4858249,3M TA3,2016-05-21 11:28:00,2846,Well there you go.... a business opportunity. Become a licensed bait dealer and save yourself and your friends and neighbors the hassle of driving 35 miles to get bait.
4858777,alberta bum,2016-05-21 15:03:00,312,Lol.. Small town Ontario.. Maybe 4 guys use this ramp on the central basin of Erie.
4862457,middle son,2016-05-23 07:17:00,15,Thanks for the heads up Gord.
4862705,luv2fishcanada,2016-05-23 08:27:00,41,Does the 10 dozen also apply to night crawlers or just frozen bait? Thanks
4863025,Guest,2016-05-23 09:46:00,0,"What exactly does a limit on salted bait accomplish? The reasoning behind the restricting of live bait harvesting and transport at least makes a little sense to me - and I would think a rational argument can be made in favor of the laws, whether you agree with them or not. A restriction on salted bait makes no sense to me at all. In fact it seems to me like some sort of feel-good law that was pushed through by some pencil pushing suit in Toronto who does not know the difference between a fathead and a fat lip. my $.02"
4863881,Bakefish,2016-05-23 12:31:00,1077,"Would this apply to both male and female minnows? If so, is the LGBT aware of this?Gord, next time you are helping out your brother-man you have to get all the facts in there so your public service announcement won't be followed by 15 pages of confusion and questions. ARRRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHH. There, I feel better now."
4855849,v-bay gord,2016-05-20 12:10:00,3168,"Here's a message I received regarding the border and bringing along bait. Well the walleye season opener is here and the MNRF is apparently doing an enforcement blitz at the Border (and possibly elsewhere) on non-residents coming in to Sunset Country to fish. They are strictly enforcing the 120 (10 Dozen) limit on frozen and salted minnows your guests can bring into Canada. They will seize any bait over the 10 dozen limit. I am assuming this also applies to quantity limits on all forms of bait - as there is a possession limit for bait in the fishing regulations. This is being sent to you so you can give your arriving guests a heads up and if they are bringing in frozen or salted minnows, tell them not to bring more than the 10 dozen limit or they risk the ones over the limit being confiscated - they are also subject to a fine but it appears the MNR is not fining people at this point in time. Not surprising considering the whole invasive species issues, plus the violations that have occurred over the past several seasons."
4855881,jamc,2016-05-20 12:38:00,6,Is that 10 dozen per person or per vehicle?
4855897,LOW1,2016-05-20 12:44:00,2828,"How do frozen and salted minnows become an ais issue? Methinks that the local baitshops want to make sure that their cash registers ring, too."
4855937,v-bay gord,2016-05-20 12:50:00,3168,I would presume it is ten dozen per person. I think it is a reaction to clamp down on all aspects of bringing bait across the border. You can thank the violators of the past for the crackdown.
4855977,retire55,2016-05-20 13:07:00,1029,"I telephoned the MNR to clarify and yes, the 120 limit is per fisherperson."
4856369,pjshorthorn,2016-05-20 16:43:00,5654,Looks like bait shops stateside will need to start packaging salted minnows in 10dz sized packages. May be a question to ask if anyone is ordering them for upcoming trips.PjShorthorn.
4856697,alberta bum,2016-05-20 18:20:00,312,"It's been the law for years and they are just now choosing to enforce it.. There are several laws they are choosing too enforce this year that they have never enforced. I was talking too a buddy who runs a bait shop today,, and if what he told me is true.. Nobody come jan.1, resident or non resident will be getting minnows from anyone besides a lic'd Ontario bait dealer, Alive, frozen or salted."
4857065,outdoorsron,2016-05-20 22:11:00,843,Hello: What about night crawlers ? My guess is they will be clamping down on them soon also. Good Luck. O - R
4857185,Pooch,2016-05-21 03:02:00,4619,"As much as I don't like the law, in this day of invasive species and disease it probably only makes sense. The little extra it will cost is probably money well spent north and south of the border for the good of all concerned.Just my .02 cents worth.Pooch"
4857193,alberta bum,2016-05-21 04:00:00,312,"Only thing I don't like about what he told me.. Me as an Ontario resident can dip my own minnows right now..

I would have too drive 35 minutes north of me too buy minnows from a lic'd bait shop and have a recipient.. That bait shop is dipping minnows at the exact ramp I fish out of..."
