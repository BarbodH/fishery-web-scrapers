Just wondering what experiences any of you might have had with this lake. I have only heard positive things about Mattice, but not much about this lake. Thainks in advance. Fish On! Hooks"

Depth is over 100 foot in some spots, a few years ago some gal caught a 45 lb. Lake Trout there. Don & Annette purchased it from Kelly & Maureen Massaro (Armstrong Outposts) a few years ago. Kelly used to reserve a spot for two Tournament Anglers there every year, Kelly said they would hit it hard for a week and would catch and release several hundred Walleye per day. Don & Annette at Mattice run a top notch operation so really not much to worry about, Don has a soft spot for Luella and takes his Grandkids there occasionally and agree's that the fishing in that lake is one of the best for Lake Trout in Wabakimi and excellent for Walleye and Pike."
