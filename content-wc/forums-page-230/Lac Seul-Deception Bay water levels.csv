4913897,Dakota Floyd,2016-06-09 13:20:00,62,We come in through Hudson landing and not deception but run right by it. Water is low but not as low as it can be. Shouldn't have any issues.
4913961,tv4fish,2016-06-09 14:02:00,2694,Thank you for your reply. OH --- maybe a MORE important question - How was your fishing up there?
4914473,Dakota Floyd,2016-06-09 17:43:00,62,Good fishing. Fished bear paw and canoe and did well. 3 of us had at least a 150 day the other 2 days the wind switched and slowed down to 40+ days.
