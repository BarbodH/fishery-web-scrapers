4903105,ftfarms,2016-06-06 05:02:00,444,We've fished canada for 30 years 1-2 weeks every year and started going for the awsome smallmouth and walleye fishing. Not sure what your talking about. We've also fished wisconson for crappie and smallmouth for 35 years. Haven't found a lake in Wisconsin that the smallmouth fishing is close to whats in ontario. I would love to know those lakes your talking about. Being packers fans we enjoy our time in wisconson about as much as canada. Now a young couple we meet in canada that lives north of greenbay tells me the smallmouth bass fishing around greenbay is fantastic. Haven't made it up in that area to fish yet. So I maybe wrong but if it's as good or better than we've had in ontario that will be fun.
4903225,Skywagon,2016-06-06 05:46:00,1106,AMEN! If they saw what the smallmouth have done to some local lakes they would understand.
4904145,Lmbkiller,2016-06-06 10:15:00,639,"Chequamogon bay (spelling?), Green Bay, sturgeon bay, turtle flambeau flowage, entire flambeau river, Chippewa river, lk pepin, many lks in vilas co, long lk......I'm sure they're are more. These all have excellent smb fishing. Look at some of the weights for the sturgeon bay open tourney, ridiculous slobs and high avg for 5 fish limit"
4904657,bus33,2016-06-06 11:45:00,289,Not to get off topic but why has the SM population grown so much since being nonexistent in the past?
4904937,Aaron-IN,2016-06-06 13:06:00,500,"I've not really seen a huge increase in SM where I've been going for the past 36 years (Winnipeg River/Minaki), seems to be just as many now as there was back in 1980 (a bunch)."
4907625,Steve Ediger,2016-06-07 08:13:00,97,"Since I have not fished a lot of lakes in NW Ontario I have not seen what an increasing smallmouth population does to a lake. Can someone fill me in on why an increase in smallmouth is detrimental to a lake. All I know about them is they are a lot of fun to catch. Thanks for your insight, Steve"
4908017,Jesse-WI,2016-06-07 10:45:00,534,"been studied in an least one place, basically no impact.https://www.sdstate.edu/nrm/outreach...er_SMB-WAE.pdf"
4909697,Lmbkiller,2016-06-07 22:08:00,639,"Plenty aware of all the surveys, data, theory testing, diets, etc. I work in fisheries. Fact of the matter is both smb in Canada and lmb in wi are displacing walleye and it's not a ""who's eating who"", rather no one really knows why it's happening, but at the end of the day, it is happening. Look at Mille lacs. Very few smb there even 15yrs ago, now crawls with them. Walleye harvest quota this yr is nonexistent. Friend has a cabin off the gunflint trail and has fished many lks over the last 60yrs. He has a list that were walleye lks 30yrs ago that are now nothing but smb. In the last 10yrs on lac seul I catch more bass every yr and I'm not targeting them. Ontario mnr is goin to sleep in the bed they made with their ridiculous ""no bass over 14in harvested before July 1."" What makes bass so special that we are discouraged to keep them, yet we encourage EVERYONE that it's ok to keep walleye? Fact is walleye are a secondary, back seat fish to bass when it comes to aggressiveness and day to day life habits. Walleye will lose this battle without help. There are already plenty of established bass lks and no one keeps them anyways, bass will be fine after a nuclear holocaust, walleyes are in trouble today"
4880137,Knoxabilly,2016-05-29 22:54:00,225,"Hey guys- got back from Evergreen Lodge for the opener. This is my 20th year of going up to Lac Seul- I swear it gets better each year. This year we had the largest group that I have ever traveled with- 9 of us. Pat was extremely accommodating and we stayed in cabin 3 which can sleep 10, has a huge living area/kitchen, 2 refrigerators and 2 bathrooms. The boats were excellent as always and we rented 3. Water is low and they're not letting any water out of the dam right now, that may be a first when we've been there. One of our boats hit something by Goose Island and messed up a lower end :/ Be careful out there with the low water.The fishing (get to the point right?) We caught the most fish we've ever caught in a week. I know having 9 helps pad the stats quite a bit, but I know my boat alone caught more then we ever have. The group caught just under 2,000 fish for the week! We caught walleyes in 4-10 FOW on rocky shores. Didn't have to search too hard to find fish this year. Most fishing done in Sawmill and Bannatyne Bay. We also found an area that held an incredible amount of large smallmouth. We would spend some time targeting them each day and would always catch some, hot bait was husky jerk in rainbow- we caught over 50 for the week! Biggest being 3.5lbs! That's more then we've probably ever caught combined. We caught the majority of walleye's on jigs (1/8 and 1/4) tipped with minnows and leeches. We did cast lindys with leeches also and had great luck. When the bite would turn on I would use gulp minnows only and did excellent. Water temp was 60-62 degrees. I will post stats and some photos later. Can't wait to go back- starting to think once a year is not enough. I will post photos and stats later. How did you guys do?"
4880329,Pooch,2016-05-30 04:48:00,4619,"Agree with you Knoxabilly, ""Once a year is not enough"". Being self employed I can make three a year, but it can be tough to get work done ahead of time then come home and be behind. Well worth it though, as someday I won't be able to make these trips.Do it if and while you can!Pooch"
4887065,Guest,2016-05-31 19:48:00,0,Thanks for the report! We are heading to Gold Pines in Ear Falls on Saturday. A few questions for you: (1) how did the size compare to previous years catches? Last year we caught a lot of small walleyes in Sawmill and caught our biggest fish down in McKenzie Bay. (2) did anyone in your resort head down to McKenzie Bay? (3) we've never fished Bannatyne Bay much. Any particular area we should start fishing? Thanks again!!!!
4887593,Mike Borger,2016-06-01 03:23:00,1554,Sounds incredible!
4888049,WDMJigger,2016-06-01 06:51:00,4,"Size range in Sawmill was majority 14""-18"", with largest being 26"" and around 20 eyes over slot. We had better luck with larger eyes in Bannatyne (28.5"" largest). Just find some rock shelves along the banks there and you'll get some. Stay clear of the NW corner of the bay as it is very rocky. Our group doesn't travel to McKenzie as its too far away and we can find fish closer while staying out of Evergreen."
4888537,bus33,2016-06-01 08:51:00,289,Our opener was good too. We fished the mouth and Lunker with good results. Lots of big northern and walleye numbers were great. Had a couple days where each boat had 100 fish days. Like was mentioned above...lake was warmer than usual and low but I've seen it lower. All of our fish were 12-15 fow on leech and minnow tipped jigs.
4888801,Knoxabilly,2016-06-01 10:38:00,225,"Here are a couple photos from our boat. Our numbers with all 9 fisherman are as follows.Total Walleye-1491 Total Fish-1913Slot Walleye-71Over Slot-44Northern-315Perch- 53Smallies-54 (I still can't believe this!)Biggest Walleye 28.5 7.1lbsBiggest Northern- 35"" 10lbs (FAT!)What a trip! Can't wait for our next adventure- Tight Lines Boys"
4888833,Knoxabilly,2016-06-01 10:43:00,225,Smallies and a pile of eyes
4900969,bus33,2016-06-05 08:58:00,289,I bet those smallies were fun!
4902953,Lmbkiller,2016-06-05 23:04:00,639,"U guys and your smb......question: why do u go to Canada? I'm thinking your reply is the walleye fishing is incredible. I've been fishing lac seul since 91', smb were nonexistent. Now they are a nuisance. Do u guys think they are good for the system? I'm here to tell u they are not and they are/and have taken over on smaller systems not too far south of lac seul. Bass have little to no place in Canada and have only come on full force in the last 15yrs. Remember why u go to Canada, it's for walleyes. There are more and bigger bass in WI (especially smb) than Canada will ever have."
