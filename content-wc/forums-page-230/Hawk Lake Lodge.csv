1259672,MidWestFishman,2011-01-04 18:47:00,44,"As I was thinking about where I would go fishing for my annual Canadian trip in 2011, I narrowed my couple dozen choices to 5 lodges, then 3, then two. After a LOT of thinking, calling people who fished at the lodges I was considering and talking with the lodge owners, I decided on Hawk Lake Lodge. Ted had no problem taking a single fisherman at no upcharge and allowing me to tweak my trip on a couple of things, again with no upcharge. Ted also said he would go out and do some night fishing with me and I can tell you I have never had a lodge owner offer that before ( I know they are very busy so I would not expect it) and that is a really nice touch. He responds quickly to emails which I have not always had with all lodges. Things like that impress me and add to the value of a trip in my opinion. Ted can't brag on here now that he owns the lodge but I did want to say that at this point I couldn't be happier with the way the pre-trip things have gone and I am looking forward to fishing on some of those 19 lakes and the good possibility of catching a trophy smallmouth and maybe a trophy walleye. Throw in the chance at good size pike and crappie and one can't ask for much more than that. With some luck maybe I will make it on his website holding a fish that is jaw dropping! I'm counting the days!"

545788,bronzeback77,2005-02-16 16:04:00,97,Has anyone stayed at or heard of Hawk Lake Lodge? They have a very nice website but I wanted some first hand opinions if possible.
1093517,Fisherman Ted,2009-04-02 15:10:00,461,"I have been going there off and on for the past 5 years right after the new management took over (Frank and Mary Carmen). I have also been leading Canadian trips for the past 25 years.Hawk Lake Lodge is one of the best lodges I have ever visited. It prides itself as one of the few 5 star lodges in Canada and they sure do live up to the reputation. The hospitality is top notch, amazing food, clean cabins, hot tub, beautiful boats, great guides etc. Happy hour every night on the deck overlooking the main lake, shore lunches, steak and lobster for dinner, etc.However, all that being said the fishing is what keeps me coming back. They are on a main lake (Hawk Lake) which is excellent and large and is the only outfitter on the lake. Huge (like world record sized) walleye, pike and lake trout. But they are famous for their smallmouth. With like 20 private portage lakes connected to the main lake, you can and will fish a new lake each day and be the only boat on the water (they have rights to each of these lakes where they store boats with motors on them). So every day you get to try a different body of water.Smallmouth fishing is off the charts. Can't speak more highly. Combine this with the service and it will be a trip you will not forget and will yearn for year after year. In fact last year I took my 7 year old daughter on her first Canadian trip and she had the time of her life.If you are interested in any other details drop me a note. I am going back up there in July and August this year.Cheers."
1093572,MikeMcC,2009-04-02 17:47:00,72,"Ted, what a great testimonial. The place looks awesome, with lots of lakes to explore. I will have to put it on the list of lakes/resorts to experience. Their web page doesn't list rates. Any idea what a weeks American plan cost?"
1093720,Fisherman Ted,2009-04-03 07:38:00,461,"Rates are under the Contact Us page. Right now they are posting $335 per night for May and August, and $380 for June and July.Some may deem this a little high and I know its out of my usual fishing trip budget. I was leery on my first trip. But it is truly an all inclusive (except for guides, which you don't need as the fishing is ridiculous). All meals, drinks at happy hours, all gas, bait (minnows, leeches etc.), etc. I like this idea of not having to worry about the 'extras'.An example of their service. 5 days before my first trip there I broke my leg. Like a true die-hard (my wife would argue idiot) I still vowed to go, crutches and all. They treated me like royalty. Packing my boat for me each morning, carrying rods and tackle bags, even bringing fresh coffee to my cabin in the morning so I didn't have to walk to the lodge.I have been hooked ever since."
1095154,adempsey,2009-04-08 01:04:00,963,I have never been there but I surely would love to go!I was at a different lodge last year and there was a large group of guys that wouldn't stop talking about Hawk Lake all week. Seemed to me the place to go!
1095563,Fisherman Ted,2009-04-09 09:26:00,461,"I was just talking with Frank, the owner and as times are tough he has just posted a discount for this years prices. If you come after July 25th, the rate is $280 per night. Additionally, for families if there are two adults in the group kids under 17 are free. Can't beat that deal!Frank is very accomodating when it comes to new guests, in terms of discounts and throwing in extras. Like any lodge owner he wants you to have a great time and come back year after year. He can tailor a trip for any budget and size I have found."
1205497,Guest,2010-05-30 21:31:00,0,"Fisherman Ted, Thanks for the info. I am heading up to Hawk Lake with my Grandpa. This is my first Canada fishing trip. We will be there in the middle of July. We are most concerned about catching small mouth bass. I was wondering if you did any fishing for the crappie or perch? Baruch"
1221946,Fisherman Ted,2010-07-23 21:26:00,461,I have never caught crappie but have caught plenty of perch. That being said other guests have caught some huge crappie while I have been up there.I'm heading up there next week actually. Looking forward to some great smallmouth fishing and giant walleye!
1259317,Fisherman Ted,2011-01-03 14:18:00,461,"Hey all.Its interesting how things come full circle. I found Hawk Lake Lodge via this web-site like 10 years ago I think. I remember poking around and decided to give the lodge a try.I then had a great time and started telling others (this thread appears to have started in 2005, some 6 years ago)! As you can see I loved the place and wasn't afraid to tell others. Anyway, last spring after much soul searching I appeared to have my mid-life crisis. My first thought was liposuction and a red sports car. But after really thinking about what I wanted in life and where I wanted to end up with my family I went to Plan B, which is so relevant to this thread (and board) it hurts. Two months ago I put my money where my posts have been and I bought Hawk Lake Lodge. I will be taking my coat and tie off forever when I go up there this spring to open up for our first season. Life is just way too short, and this will ensure I see my kids grow up and I get to meet new people that love the outdoors, fishing and enjoying themselves as much as I do.Ironically I will not be able to post about the lodge here as it would be considered advertising and I would appear to be biased and I absolutely will respect that policy, its what makes this board such a great place. However if you want more information just shoot me an email and I would be happy to assist.As a new owner I have learned a lot about what we are all ultimately looking for and I will continue to peruse the board to get new ideas. Perhaps I will see you in the great North sometime soon.ThanksFisherman Ted"
1259374,skindzier,2011-01-03 17:26:00,137,Wow - unexpected curveball in a thread! Congrats Ted - I came very very close to doing the same thing in 2005. I wish you all the luck in the world!
