Also, the full moon is on the 11th. Does anyone take stock in how these two factors will affect the fishing? If so, are there any specific tactics I should be using during this time? I know it has been very warm up there and I am wondering how going from a high of 27 degrees c on June 5th to a high of 16-18 degrees c on June 11th - June 17th will impact the fish. Tight Lines.

Pretty steady bite all the way thru. On a pressured drive in lake, probably a little more of an impact. Fishing the full moon is always a good idea. Of course, fishing on a fly-in lake fishing any moon phase is a good idea ;)"
557902,Guest,2006-05-31 11:57:00,0,I wouldn't consider what you describe as a strong cold front so it probably won't effect the fishing much.
