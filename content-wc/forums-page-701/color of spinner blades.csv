557838,FISHNBOWLJOE,2006-05-29 22:53:00,80,"As a very general rule, dark water/cloudy day: Darker skirt, copper blade(s) Clearer water/sunny day: Lighter skirt, silver blade(s). As I said very general rule. You still have to consider aggressiveness of fish. If fish are more aggressive use faster presentation w/single blade. Less agreesive fish: slower presentation w/tandem blades. Usually colorado or indiana for single/faster presentation. Willow leaf for tandem /slower presentation. It's still a crap shoot though. What size blades, hammered finish, large/small tandem, willow leaf tandem, combo willow leaf/colorado or indiana tandem? A lot of it is guess work. Hope you're now as totally confused as I am when deciding what to use when fishing spinners:-) Just kidding. Hope this helps some. As an afterthought though, I have a few name brand/fairly exspensive spinners. I also have quite a few of the cheap/local variety. It seems that I catch more on the $0.99-$1.29 ones than I do the $3.00 plus models. Just some more (fish) food for thought. Anyway, Good Luck and Good Fishing! Joe"

557873,north_alabama,2006-05-30 18:58:00,172,"The ones I wouldn't leave home without in no particular order: Chartreuse, gold/hammered gold, white/pearl, florescent orange, metallic purple. Of course I haul up just about every color there is."
557879,Trailerguy,2006-05-30 20:55:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]Use any color you like....as long as it's chartreuse. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby
