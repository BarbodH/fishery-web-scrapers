557894,Guest,2006-05-31 08:36:00,0,Heading up to Lake Nipigon for a week of fishing next week. It will be my first time to the lake so I was wondering what to expect. What types of lures should I bring and what should I expect to catch? If anyone knows of any good spots or maps it would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
