557752,Guest,2006-05-26 21:11:00,0,We catch plenty of walleye every time we go. Within 30 minutes we caught a 27.5 and 29.5 inch walleye. Last time someone in camp caught a 31 inch walleye. We catch a lot of lake trout early in the shallows. Great camp if you like to be secluded and nobody around you. Scott
