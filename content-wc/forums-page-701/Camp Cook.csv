557857,Guest,2006-05-30 12:17:00,0,I'm looking at a forced carrier change in a couple years. I'm too young to retire and too old to keep up with the 25 year olds. I love to cook and love to be up north. What does it take to get a camp cook job at a resort? Does it pay more than a Wallmart greeter? Are most of those jobs going to family and friends?

Unless you own the camp, or become a resident it's pretty tough to work legally. If only we followed thier example, we wouldn't need to build a fence on our southern border. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
557885,Guest,2006-05-31 07:14:00,0,"Thanks for the reply Trailerguy, it never occurred to me that they wouldn't let an American work. But now that you mention it, I do recall a few years ago a conversation with a resort owner about where he got his summer doc hand help. He did say something about how he had to hire Canadians for the most part. It seemed like those summer jobs were important to the local communities and young men and women working at the camps. I suppose from Canada's point of view it's bad enough Americans own the resorts, it would be even worse if we took all the jobs. I don't mean to side bar the topic, I'm just a guy looking at the last 15 years of work and needing a career change. Trying to combine the things I love (the great outdoors) with making a living."
