The hardest part was getting them in the slot size. Lots in the 21"" to 24"" range with one going 27"". Tons in the 12"" to 13"" range which to me was a real positve sign that these fish are all going back, so the futures look to be secure. Under the bridge held lots of fish and right up to the base of Big Sand in the typical spots also produced fish. Only one bass caught , and talking to people who went for them figure it's a touch soon. My daughter caught her largest pike at 38"" We did try leechs , but not nearly as effective of a real large minnow. Give it 2 more weeks and we'll switch over."
557822,Guest,2006-05-29 12:02:00,0,Glad to hear your report! Was up there last year later part of June and could not catch anything over 14 inches. Our group is leaving on the 17th of June hopefully things will keep going.

557841,Guest,2006-05-30 07:20:00,0,You can only keep walleye in the slot size between 35-45 centimeters (13.8-17.7 inches) and one over 27.6 inches.

557929,Guest,2006-05-31 23:02:00,0,How are the water levels? Any news on how high the water is or will get in the next month? Our group is going up June 16th for a week and it seems we always hit the high water week! Good Luck and good fishing to all! Eric
557935,Guest,2006-06-01 07:27:00,0,The water is below normal and unless it rains a bunch you won't have anything to worry about.
