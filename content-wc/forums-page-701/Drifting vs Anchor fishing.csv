Continue your drifts, just go around the guy. I've done it a number of times. Start your drift, if you're going to hit the guy's boat use the motor to push your boat one way or the other. That way you still get to fish ""your spot"" and the guy will get the point that he jumped your drift."
556834,Guest,2006-05-03 15:26:00,0,"I personally do not like sitting in one spot and fishing. I like to move, either drifting or backtrolling. Last year we were drifting and motoring back up and doing well, and some guy who was fishing way too far offshore waited for us to drift by and shot up and anchored right in the middle of our drift. I know what I did...what would you do?"
556850,Guest,2006-05-03 23:07:00,0,"Hi Dave, First of all, you don't own the lake. But there's ways to protect your drifts. I keep 5 to 6 markers in my boat. Drop them as you go. Most people will respect a marker. I use this technique while tournament fishing where sometimes you feel like your bumper boating. I've had people move into my territory before. Yes it is a little frustrating but hey Dave that was my spot you were drifting in... hehehe Happy fishing Mista W"

It can be someone elses spot when I leave. I fish Lac Suel and there is 100's of square miles of water out there and some guy moves in on the spot I'm fishing. ""NUTS"" Find your own spot, like I did, or hire a guide. A guide doesn't do that, at least any self respecting one. It happened again last year, fishing the bottom of South Inlet near the falls, there is a mid bay hump that I discovered by accident a few years ago when the water was way down. Now I fish it, but I have to find it and mark it. No sooner than I mark it with 3 bouys, a boat from Nebraska (NB License) rolls right in and sits in the middle of all 3. Now, I don't own the lake, that's right, but common courtesy, common sense, or just politely asking if they could fish there would have been OK. But just rolling in and sitting there was BS. Ask and I would have told them sure and what we were using along with some additional spots to try. We all share the resource."
557769,Guest,2006-05-27 10:07:00,0,"What are the rule of the road? We fish Gullrock Lake and last year while anchored next to our bouy a boat was trolling so close they hooked the bouy line and drug it half way down the lake before turning around to get it back to me. We typically troll until we find them, mark it and anchor on the mark but it seems to me, like previously mentioned, it is an invatation for the rest of the fishing parties to set up next to us. This year we plan on using duck decoys and tossing our marker bouys 200 yards in the opposite direction. 7 days to gullrock!!!!!!"
557775,Guest,2006-05-27 13:16:00,0,You might try this tactic: Remove the line and weight from a sacrificial marker bouy and throw it in. Let the wind and/or current carry it to who knows where.
557779,Mr. Walleye,2006-05-27 17:38:00,74,This is why I do a fly-in. Well worth the extra bucks to have the lake to yourself.
557794,Schief79,2006-05-28 08:23:00,11,I agree with you Mr. Walleye. We go to a different fly-in lake each year and never see another boat. Leaving Georgia Wednesday for a fly-in with Pickle Lake outfitters. Go Navy!
557802,gapr,2006-05-28 12:17:00,192,"tony o that is what i have started to do, the marker is not exactly marking the spot. i have been crowded to many times, if i have my family with me it is oh well i'll find another place but if i am fishing hard i will throw the marker away from the spot and use it as a reference only."
557815,phishfearme,2006-05-29 07:16:00,1242,schief - please give us a report when you return from your trip with pete. i've done three different trips with him although not to his specific outposts - and he's one of the most detailed and diligent pilots around. - phish
557881,Guest,2006-05-30 21:16:00,0,"We use a drift sock and the trolling motor to stay on the fish. We've found in the past that if the 'eyes are in 18-20 ft of water, we'll drift parallel to the shore and use the trolling motor to stay in the target depth. Works great."
