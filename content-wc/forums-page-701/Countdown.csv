557795,Schief79,2006-05-28 08:30:00,11,My Navy and fishing buddy from Florida picks me up in Georgia on Wednesday the 31st. We'll take our time golfing along the way and be at our outfitters on the 7th for a fly in to Lake Wastayanipi on the 8th. We go to a different lake each year with a different outfitter. Only do fly-ins and never use live bait. Plugs and jigs and catch all the fish we want. Hope all of us have a good safe trip. Good luck. Go Navy!
