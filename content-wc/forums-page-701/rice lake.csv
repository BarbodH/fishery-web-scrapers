Some people have been doing alright but it's a hit and miss type of deal. Try ripping with a 1/2 oz. black and white hair jig, it lets you cover some water and it's alot of fun too. Once you find a couple slow it down and work the area with a white or smoke grub. If you are mobile I would suggest a day trip to the Bay Of Quinte to take a shot at some real horses. Enjoy your trip"
