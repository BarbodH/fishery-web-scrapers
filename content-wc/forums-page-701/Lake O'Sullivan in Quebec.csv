557792,Thunderstick,2006-05-28 06:35:00,35,"I figured that my reply would get you going. I wouldn't want anything to happen to Russell's prop. All I can offer for a hotspot are places everyone fishes anyway. This being earlier than our normal week, I will spend a lot of time in Smith's Bay, Pike Bay and Ted's Bay as well as the sand bar in the north end and the sand bar east of ""the big rock"". Many daytime hours will be devoted to pike while the evenings will be walleye time. No secret lures, no secret techniques and no real secret spots. Just a lot of time on the water exploring and seeking active fish. Every year is different."
557893,Guest,2006-05-31 08:12:00,0,"Ok, I agree on all counts. Those sand bars do merit a closer look but as you say, it is all the spots everyone fishes. I also will show you a sand bar or two you may not know about. It seems we motor past the best spots sometimes. Please join us for a shore lunch while you are there. Bruce and I are getting up early (6/8) and hope to hit Armentier if possible. See you soon. Have a safe Clova"
557899,Thunderstick,2006-05-31 11:27:00,35,"Have a good trip, yourself. See you soon."
557476,Guest,2006-05-21 21:00:00,0,"Who is heading up to O'Sullivan this year? Our group pulls in to the Lodge on 6/10. We are there for our 10th straight year and love more each summer Can't wait; what's new in your tackle box for O'Sullivan this year? I've expanded the stickbait contingent to include a Rapala 4"" baby pike. same old jigs as always..."
557521,Mondo_OH,2006-05-22 21:53:00,58,Andy I have been trying to email you all spring about this camp with no reply. would you email me back.... thanks
557525,GP-NJ,2006-05-23 06:58:00,156,"Andy, Me, my wife and 2 Irish Jack Russell Terriers will be there 6/10-6/24 so we will see you there. I think we are staying in one of the cabins on the north side of camp. We first went to OSLL Russell's first year. Last year was my first year back after missing 2 years. The fishing was fantastic- many walleyes including one 28 1/2"" & one 31"". I discovered a couple of different patterns that worked out well. After my trip last year I posted a fishing report here on WC. It's in the archives -https://www.walleyecentral.com/dc/dcb...ng_type=search This year we plan to target Walleyes, Lakers and Northerns. Send me a PM or email. Greg"

557623,Guest,2006-05-24 12:50:00,0,"Greg; I look forward to seeing you! I re-read the old post and now it's all coming back to me. You had a great trip and really did well. I am using all the same lures this year; I was able to find the old standard Thunderstick lure at the Cabelas store near her and bought four just so spares are available and I also bought a few more stick baits, some shallow and some deep divers (7'-9') and of course, every year Bruce and I find new spots (new to us) and often these are areas we have been tooling by for ten years without stopping and that is the best part: I cannot cover the Lake in a lifetime but I will surely try. This, to me, is the huge benefit of going back to the same place every year rather than starting from scratch; it provides the best of all worlds: new and old every year. I look forward to seeing you there Andy P.S. and I agree with everything everyone says about the Clova Road!"
557697,Guest,2006-05-25 16:48:00,0,"Isn't anyone else going to O'Sullivan??? My God, this could be The Mother of All Years if all the walleye central studs stay away--more fish for us. That is saying something too Thunderstick: where the #### are ya????"
557704,Thunderstick,2006-05-25 19:44:00,35,Gettin' ready.
557716,Guest,2006-05-26 07:01:00,0,T-sick: Good to hear from you! How did you make out last year at O'Sullivan? I'll trade you a hot spot for a hot spot that we haven't discussed before. You go first... How about that creek coming out of Candy? We breezed by that and plan to hit that this year and do some more nighttime trolling with stick baits. We are there June 7 to 17. When is your trip? andy
557730,Guest,2006-05-26 12:43:00,0,"andy/t-stick, we did hit the mouth of candy. didn't get anything but we tried it. t-stick, if the wind is out o the nord, hit the northern side of the relatively big island on your right as you approach the southern narrows. eyes and the biggest pike i have ever caught are there. now what do you have for us and when are you up."
557738,Thunderstick,2006-05-26 16:42:00,35,We're there June 10-17. Thanks for giving up your hotspots. I'll give mine up on June 18.
