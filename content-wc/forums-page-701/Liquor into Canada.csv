557953,Guest,2006-06-01 13:32:00,0,"if you're gonna bring weed over, you want to make sure you bring in just under an ounce (which is considered personal use here) (no sense in getting caught with a little bit, and you might as well take a little extra too). wrap it real good! then you just bury the left over's and mark it with a GPS so you don't have to bring it the following year! (plus it just gives you one more excuse to come back to canada to fish!!!!) seriously, you are allowed 1 - 24 of beer or 1 40oz of liquor (not both) a carton of ciggs, and 50 cigars (although you can get nice cuban cigars here, just switch the labels on them with the cheap ones you buy at the duty free on your way into canada to take back!)"

557851,Guest,2006-05-30 10:40:00,0,"I heard they changed the rule due to the search function not working properly. Today, as it stands in my mind, you can bring the equivalence of 1 keg and 5,000,000 cigarettes OR 5 cases of hard liquor and 5,000 cigars. No mix matching allowed. >I know this has been covered before but I couldn't find it in >a search. What is the rule for taking alcohol over?

557853,Guest,2006-05-30 11:07:00,0,Thanks for help i see they are more restrictive on cigars then they were in past . What about weed they ok with that as long as its bagged up?
557854,Guest,2006-05-30 11:08:00,0,You cab bring crab grass and dandelions - that's aboot it for weed.
557855,Guest,2006-05-30 11:14:00,0,"You can bring whatever booze you want, just pay duty on it. The duty on weed is one tough duty!"
557856,Guest,2006-05-30 11:29:00,0,"I concur. However, that extra $12 bottle of vodka that you bring, you'll end up paying about $10 in duty. Buy it in Canada, and don't forget your bag of oregeno."
557864,Guest,2006-05-30 15:43:00,0,Thanks Jigman.. At least one person can be serious and help a guy out...
557868,Guest,2006-05-30 16:43:00,0,"It is the Canada board, dude. You expect seriousness? Here? Besides, nobody could top Jigman's post in terms of answering the question. :)"
557869,bigfish1965,2006-05-30 17:32:00,3210,"No you can't bring weed across anymore. Apparently there was a weed fungus found and they're afraid that if allowed across it could damage the weed in Canada. Should this happen, half of British Columbia would face job losses. Weed, like beer, is better here anyway."
