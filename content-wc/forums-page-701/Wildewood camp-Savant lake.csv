557834,Pooch,2006-05-29 18:55:00,4619,"Sarg, Email me and I will spill my guts about Lake Savant and Wildewood. Nothing but good from my group and others I've met. Been fishing that camp and others for years. We will be there for two weeks the end of July and first of August. That's how much we like it there. Pooch[email protected]"
557844,pmarasco,2006-05-30 08:57:00,13,"We used to go to Wildewood years ago. We go to Cat Track exclusively now. (in fact, we are going in on Friday - can't wait) It is across from Roma's halfway up the lake. We fish in the northern half of the lake so Wildewood just didn't make sense. It takes forever to get there from Wildewood. If you are going there for your first time I have one word for you- GPS. We used to get lost all the time. Those islands begin to bleed into the shoreline and you don't know where you are. GPS may not help you get somewhere but it will certainly help getting back. You forgot to say when you are going. I only have experience with spring/post spawn and I understand the tactics and fish depths change dramatically for later in the year. -P"
557865,sarg,2006-05-30 16:37:00,29,"Pmarasco, I just read your reply to my posting about Savant Lake.You said you stay at cat track camp near Roma's.I thought there was only two camps on the lake.I never heard of the one you stay at.Could you give some info on that camp or some contact info,do they have a web-site? Sarg"
557870,pmarasco,2006-05-30 17:40:00,13,"According to what I know (someone might be able to fill in more) there are three lodges and 3 outpost(single cabin/dock only) camps owned by different people. Wildewood is the most internet friendly. Cat Track is directly west and accross from Cliff and Roma's (who also do not have a website). Cat Track does have a very loyal following(i.e. tough to get a reservation if you have never been there before). If google maps is working then they are located at the top of the ""V""http://maps.google.com/?ll=50.476749...,0.019934&om=1 Since it is fly in camp (sorta- true since you can walk in but not drive) you get the use of their boats and motors (usually 9.9 HP's) but since the camp is located almost halfway up the lake the travel times aren't too bad. Unfortunately, I don't seem to be able to locate the current number but when I get back from there next week I will update this post. The three outposts are served by Rusty Myers http://www.rustymyers.com/ although they don't own them. At least they don't have them posted on the flyin website. But you can call them and check."
557887,Pooch,2006-05-31 07:26:00,4619,"I thought Roma's and Cat Track either are or used to be owned by a mother/daughter. Since they are right next to each other they seem to almost be one camp. The only cabin I know of is located on the far south end of the lake and is owned by the local tribe. Over the years I've only seen it occupied once. There are a number of trapper cabin sites and a Hudson Bay site that have pretty well been reclaimed by nature. If you did't know where they were you would never find them. There was also a fire tower located on the narrows that is now completely gone. There are two ""all but gone"" wooden fishing boats located on the east bank of Big Sandy. I think they were abandoned in the 1950's after a failed attempt to net on Lake Savant. The Savant area has an interesting history as it (like many areas in Canada) was used by trappers and people working for the Hudson Bay Co. A couple of years ago the owner of the Wildewood Camp comissioned a remake of the depth map of Lake Savant and it is a great map. It shows some of the old landmarks. If you are a history buff these old sites are pretty cool to look around in, but there isn't much of anything left. Pooch"
557892,pmarasco,2006-05-31 08:10:00,13,I don't know about Roma's but the owner 0f Cat Track tells a nice story that her husband found the site for the camp when they were canoeing in the lake in the 50's. I can only imagine what it was like back then. Some of the maintenance people do work at both camps. I have always wanted to go see the Hudson Bay Trader's camp. It is only a couple of bays up from where Roma's and Cat Track. However- fishing seems to be the more pressing matter than exploring the ruins when we are floating by.... 7 more hours till I get on a plane to go there! -Phil
