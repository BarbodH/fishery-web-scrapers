557836,Guest,2006-05-29 20:32:00,0,I think it's anything that grows underground.
557839,phaffy12,2006-05-29 23:04:00,9,"It has to do with soil on the object that you are bringing across the border and the possibility that the soil could have some microbe on it that could be introduced to Canada. Therefore, root crops in general are not allowed across the border unless they have been processed in some way."
