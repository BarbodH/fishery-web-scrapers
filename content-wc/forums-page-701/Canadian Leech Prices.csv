557722,Guest,2006-05-26 08:22:00,0,Rainy Lake Sports in Fort Frances quoted me $38/lb. earlier this week. I think it is in Canadian funds.
557732,Guest,2006-05-26 13:08:00,0,$38 per pound doesn't much matter is Canada $ or US $ with current exhange rate? That is pretty steep. I was afraid of that. I think we paid $24 last year. We usually buy 10 pounds but probably won't this year. May have to re-think how the bait fund allotment is determined. $380 buys a lot of other stuff to make a trip fun. Please don't tell me Canadian beer prices have jumped like that. Did you hear anything about the quality or assortment of the leeches. My experience is that Canada baitshops do not do as good of a job sorting the leeches as most Minnesota shops do. When I buy a pound of leeches I like to get some size consistency. I don't like 1/2 of my pound to be one inch leeches. Note to everyone: I am not trying to create a long debate over this leech issue. Just trying to be prepared financially for the higher costs and recommendations anyone may have.

We priced them on the way up to Kenora, and the price goes up about $4 a pound by the time you get to Kenora. I think the quality of the leeches goes down too, but that's just my opinoin. Stay with the shops that sell lots of leeches, they maintain a fresher supply. They do a pretty good job sorting the leeches, you'll find an occassional runt in with the big guys, but they run pretty consistent. Chuck"
557786,Guest,2006-05-27 19:43:00,0,"Wow, that seems expensive compared to prices around here($20.00/lb approx.) What is the rule on crawlers again?, you can bring them across the border in bedding(Fat N Sassy Worm Bedding?) We'll certainly have to consider using Gulp or PowerBait a lot more. Thanks for the heads up!!"
557803,2746,2006-05-28 12:36:00,3206,Just got back and paid $40/lb for leeches. Still alot better than $3.75/doz for minnows. Can bring crawlers over as long as not in dirt and I think you can get those here at around $50/500. They were hitting equally well on all three. If we fish just with minnows our group of six can creat a $300 minnow bill in a week without much trouble. Not a killer but still a significant expense.
557952,Guest,2006-06-01 13:28:00,0,"Just got back from Ear Falls and paid $45 per pound for leeches and $3.99 for a dozen minnows. We purchased 60 doz minnows and 2 lbs of leeches for a fly-in fishing trip. I think the total bill was around $360. In my opinion leeches are a much better deal than minnows. We cut our leeches into thirds and most of the time were able to catch 3 walleyes per each third used. Also, leeches are less likely to come off the jig when you hit a snag."
