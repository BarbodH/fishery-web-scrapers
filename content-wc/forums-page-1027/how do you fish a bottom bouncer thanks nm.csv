Trolling speed can vary on current if fishing in the riverHeavy current = slower trollNo current = faster troll An ideal speed would be when your snell is streached straight out horizontally behind the bouncer. You can test this by watching your lure beside the boat, too fast and your bait will not look natural and too slow you risk getting hung up. Bottom Bouncers are an effective way to cover lots of waterand when used propperly almost no snags. Depending on what size hook you use your hookset will vary,with a small hook let the fish take the bait like using a lindyrig for example but don't open your bail just lowering your rod tip will due just fine and if after a couple of seconds slowly lift the tip back up if you feel him there set the hook. That works for me have fun..."

Are there just a couple of commom weights, e.g. like jigs -- most people use 1/2 or 1/4 oz.?? What weight would you suggest for drift fishing on a lake with a moderate chop 1-2 ft.?? My problem using bouncers was maintaining proper contact with the bottom as the depth would change. I experienced a lot of hang-ups so that even though my fishing partner was catching fish with this technique, he gave up because of the headache of having to backtrack to undo my snags all the time."
511880,Guest,2001-04-06 07:21:00,0,"Charlie,As with all new techniques, it takes practice. Once you get the hang of it, it becomes much easier. The rule of thumb for bottom bouncer weights is one ounce for every ten feet of depth (i.e. 1oz for 10 feet of depth; 2 0z for 20 feet of depth, etc.). If your trolling or drifting, you should let the weight down until you feel bottom and then reel up about a foot of line. You should maintain as least a 45 degree angle on your line once underway. When the water becomes deeper, let a little more line out to maintain bottom contact, (again just to feel a ticking of the bottom now and then), when it becomes more shallow reel some line in. Having someone keeping their eye on the depth finder will surely help you in these maneuvers. Hope this helps.Remember to keep your eyes open and your feet dry.S.v.m"

It's easier to adjust for changes in depth if the reel you use has a flipping switch or, at least, a thumb bar. Don't drag the end of the bouncer on the bottom, raise it up enough to be close and if you want to check for depth changes, drop your rod tip. Bouncers dont cover water as fast as trolling cranks but you move fast enough to find fish."
511882,Guest,2001-04-14 06:47:00,0,Mike Mclelland covers this subject in the pro page. Keep in mind that bouncers do snag and breakaway bouncers are a good idea if you are fishing rough terrain.
511883,Guest,2001-04-15 05:39:00,0,"We use bouncers and worms in June and sept with good luck. Weight depends on wind and chop. We like to use the lightest possible and still get to bottom. The slower the better (for us) and yes you get hung up once and a while. 8 to 12' of water would be 1/4 to 1/2 oz and 20 -25' we usually use 1 to 1 1/4 oz. We also make our own spinners with 3 hook snells, blades (#2 Colorado), beads, and clevis from Cabela's. I like hammered brass and orange best. Have tried minnows and leaches and always come back to worms. However we fish bays and points and very little reefs where minnows might be best.Tight lines"
511884,Guest,2001-04-16 12:25:00,0,"If you want to try something a little different and I think more effective. Tie up a three way swivel with a pencil weight on an 18 inch dropperline (lighter than main line for snags) and anywhere from a 3-10' lead to whatever you want spinner, plug, spoon works great in weedy areas."
