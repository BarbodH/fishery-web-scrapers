Now granted, this is not narrowing down specific fishing spots, because these sections still contain alot of water, but it gives a person an idea on which section a novice may start his search for good lodging and good fishing.Is anyone out there willing to share their experience and expertise on this great walleye factory of the north?Remember to keep your eyes open and your feet dry.S.v.m"
511890,Guest,2001-04-09 01:35:00,0,"Always fish the NW section, find it very productive, lots of good camps, some not so hot. Lots of water and lots of structure, not many smallies in that section, but lots of walleyes and northern. Take it easy until you become familiar with the lake. It grows some good sized rocks. For more info, e-mail."

Lac Suel Outposts (Ojibway outfitters) is really the only camp up in that entire section of lake aside from one fly in cabin by Andersons which they used to own as well. Also, Lac Suel Floating Lodges out of Hudson is very nice. I and 8 other fishin' buddies took a week jaunt on one of their 75 ft. houseboats to the NE section for a week 2 years ago and really liked it. Overall cheaper for a weeks stay and 1st rate quarters. The NE section offers very good Muskie fishing as well as great fishing for eyes with big fish potential every time you drop your line in. I personally have never caught less than a 7 lb fish on any trip up there. The western/central section has good fishing too, but a lot more traffic on prime spots and alot more boating hazards. Ojibways # is (800)567-4775. Good luck in your decision......"
511893,Guest,2001-04-09 11:08:00,0,"I have fished the NW section for 30 years. There are many fine resorts to choose from with as few or as many ammenities as you would like. There is lots of structure and plenty of fish to keep you from getting bored. Virtually all the camps you can drive in to, thereby eliminating boat rides and house boating to get to your favorite fishing spot."
511894,Guest,2001-04-11 03:39:00,0,"The NE gets my vote. We have been going there for 18+ years, with 1 year out to go to the west end. Maybe if we had gone west more often we would have become more familiar and done better.We also took houseboat from Hudson for a week one year. Went to the usual haunts. Lots of walleyes, northern and musky (far north). We prefer the Bear Narrows, Scaler Lake, China Lake area but Wapeisi bay is also very good (and generally quite crowded). Do not recall the campsite (Andersons), but it is a flyin the furthest one NE with a single cabin, nice screen porch for sunset viewing and very sheltered. This was great musky fishing there. My son & I had a double.Ojibway Outfitters has a camp at Chamberlain Narrows and offers some other packages as well. We used them for many years until the rules kept changing and the term 'outfitter' no longer applied. Some of our group has used the Chamberlain Narrows camp since. Mr Robbins is a great host, good selections of bait/tackle at store. Enjoy talking with him at the various winter shows also.We have also used Andersons for several years and they run a great operation, have several flyin camps as well as the lodge. We have in recent years chosen to use their flyin packages. Drive to S. Lookout, have a good dinner at the lodge, stay in their motel and fly out at light fully rested and ready to go. Maybe we are just getting old, but it beats launching at Deception and long possibly wet rides to camp sites. Where ever you choose you are going to enjoy just being there.Luck.TLY"
511895,Guest,2001-04-11 11:41:00,0,"Well it depends on what you want. I fished at Chamberlain Narrows with Ken and Brenda but, the 40 mile ride is a killer. I like to take my own boat and it will keep up with Ken's big 24' and his 250 merc. Then If you want to go to town for something, It's 80 miles rounf trip. I vote for the south central around Hudson. Try Lost Island. Great place, Walleyes, Smallies, etc. Short hop to Souix Lookout or Hudson if you break something and need parts. If you want Muskies, then Chamberlain is the place to go..Good luck Fishing...Kaz"
511896,Guest,2001-04-11 16:01:00,0,"ONLY KNOW THE CENTRAL AREA, TO MANY FISHERMEN IN NORTHWEST AREA. I HAVE BEEN RIDING ABOUT AN HOUR EAST FROM FISHERMENS COVE @ SCOUT BAY. NOT MANY FISHERMEN THERE BUT ACTION IS GREAT, MAINLY FISH EYES, AFTERNOONS LIKE THROWING TOP WATER IN BACK BAYS FOR NORTHERNS. LIKE OTHER POSTS HAVE ALWAYS (15 YEARS) CAUGHT AT LEAST ONE EYE OVER 7 LBS. IT HAD TAKEN MANY YEARS TO FIND 6 SEPERATE LOCATIONS, ONE EACH DAY THAT WAS DIFFERENT FOR SHORE LUNCH.LAKE IS VERY DANGEROUS ROCKS/TIMBER/WAVES/ETC. LISTEN TO RESORT OWNER FOR SUGGESTIONS AS TO WHERE TO FISH. IF YOU INTEND TO GO BACK THERE FOR SEVERAL YEARS, SUGGEST YOU INVEST IN A GUIDE FOR THE FIRST 2 DAYS THAT WAY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND YOUR WAY AROUND ALOT BETTER.BIGGG BODY OF WATER!! GOOD LUCK"
511897,Russ Warye,2001-04-12 06:41:00,8,"Great fishery for numbers and quality (lots of slot fish). The northeast end is my favorite part of the lake with the facilities at Chamberlain Narrows a great place to stay, as others have mentioned. Lac Seul is divided into management zones and this area in the northeast provides an excellent resource. Jigging, bottom bouncing, and trolled cranks all work. Pike, muskie and a growing population of smallmouth add to the equation."
511892,Guest,2001-04-13 08:49:00,0,Looking for a place to buy a good lake map for the Chamberlin area??
