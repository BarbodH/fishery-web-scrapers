512007,Ed,2001-04-17 09:03:00,143,I have a cabin that I rent every year to people I know. Neverpaid one dime to the Canucks........and never will.
512008,Guest,2001-04-17 13:38:00,0,"Why not post your last name Ed. We get reports every year from upset neighbours of cottagers who rent out their places as a business of sorts. We will investigate if the neighbour has kept a log of dates, times people and license plates. We will investigate and get full cooperation from IRS. We investigate anyone when a valid complaint is registered. We do not discriminate. We also do repos to get back taxes."
512006,Bill Coomes,2001-04-17 15:14:00,70,US or Canadian Quarters?
512016,Guest,2001-04-18 05:58:00,0,"It is not legal for you to rent out your cabin nor is it legal for Canadians to rent out their cabins. It is a matter of the licensing of rental property. Water systems must be certified and so do septic systems for rental units. If your cabin uses lake water as the supply it must be filtered and purified. Septic system must be adequate for the number of people using it. That may differ between constant use for renters and occ. use by owners. All tourist camps have to meet these requirements and collect taxes on the charges. If you sell your map to your place it should be delared at the border and tax and possibly duty paid on it. Remember, you are dealing with a different country and they can set rules just as Canadians have to deal with our rules when they come to the U.S."
511992,Guest,2001-04-20 03:05:00,0,Hey Wiggle.....I'll speak my mind anytime I want and interpret what people post without any help from you. Why don't you and Ed go wet some lines together.
511993,wiggle,2001-04-20 03:44:00,400,"Thank you for all of your intelligent HELP!I don't know if you are serious or not, knock it off!!! People want information, not bashing!Your opinion is totally out of line!GO AHEAD AND BASH US SOME MORE........."
511994,FlyBoy,2001-04-20 04:40:00,631,"CRN -Thank you for satisifying my curiousity, before we started going to Canada several times a year we always heard the old wives tales about how the locals are not nice to outsiders. Well, after spending multiple trips to canada over the last several years, I thought it was a myth. I FINALLY FOUND ONE, unfortunately it was online not in person.Your opinion appauls me, a American asks an honest question and all you give him is a personal opinion. Got any supporting information for your hot air? Don't like all of us Americans? Or how we conduct our selves? Got bad news for you pal, without all of us worthless Americans where would your economy be?DL-whoever-he-was stated he wasn't trying to retire from renting out the property, just cover some of the annual costs.Speak your mind to your hearts content, but try to say something next time.I would guess if he was trying to break some laws or atleast get around them, he would not have started this discussion. John Walton[email protected](Revenue Canada, you are a wimp too, do you have a name?)"
512011,Firetiger,2001-04-18 06:19:00,53,"So Ed, I guess we Canucks can do the same to the Yanks. What do you say?"
512009,Guest,2001-04-18 07:10:00,0,Oh Ed.... I forgot my manners..........You have yourself a very nice day........Hope to see you sometime.
512010,Guest,2001-04-19 04:35:00,0,Revenue Canada......KISS MY #####. Been renting out the cabin for 15 years. And you will never see a dime. Have a nice day!!
512012,Guest,2001-04-19 04:36:00,0,To each his own....go for it. But if you think the IRS will golooking for a few thousand dollars your nuts.

511989,IaCraig,2001-04-19 12:55:00,434,"OK, CRN. After reading Ed's posts below I concede, and retract my earlier statement. If you have had many run-ins with mindsets like Ed's I don't blame you losing your sense of humor. IaCraig"
511990,Guest,2001-04-19 16:42:00,0,LOL IaCraig. The map thing rubbed me the wrong way.
511991,wiggle,2001-04-20 01:27:00,400,"To CRN and anyone else! Read the original post! He asks a legitimate question. Obviosly he wants to be legal, that is why he is asking. Then he puts a ""little humor"" in there and you take offense. Don't be such asses, and give helpful advice or shut up!!!!!Wiggle"
512017,Firetiger,2001-04-18 06:17:00,53,"Canada has no licencing requirements for rental properties, nor do we have certification requirements for water filtration for private residences (including cottages). Septic systems must meet certain requirements when they are put in but that is all. If you own a property, be it a home or cottage, you can reside in it yourself, have boarders stay with you or you can rent the unit out, it is all up to you. The matter is different if you are actually running a business, like renting multiple cabins, then there are neigborhood/municipal/county regulations to follow which could prevent you from doing so. I cannot attest for the U.S. rules, all I know is that I can rent out my Florida residence to whomever I choose so long as I file the appropriate tax returns."
511985,dlhomes,2001-04-15 11:51:00,62,I have mentioned I have a place on LOTW for rent. Couple of people posted saying it is illegal for Americans to rent their places out. I am looking for any info on this subject or who to contact. The way Canada is I can believe this may be true and if it is then I guess I'll have a cabin available for Free use!! The map to get there runs $475 U.S. Thanks for any info.
511986,Northern Manitoban,2001-04-15 12:04:00,195,"I was looking at starting a guiding bussiness from a cabin i want to buy in a provincial park,have them stay at my cabin and take them out on the lake or elsewhere,but the laws here in Manitoba i have to get permission from cabin owners first then try to apply for a bed and breakfast liscence inside a provincial park.FISH ON."
511987,Guest,2001-04-15 18:17:00,0,If you are renting in Canada you must file a Canadian income tax return and pay the appropriate taxes. You are earning income in our fair country. I understood but have not been able to confirm as of yet.....but soon will.....My neighbour out at camp works for MOT...that as an alien to rent cabins you must be a tourist outfitter and that you require a license and a minimum of three cabins to fit into the groove. Your attitude of the map thing as a Canadian bothers me. You sound like one of those Americans that I do not like because of your attitude. I hope you file your taxes in our good country. If you do not I hope they audit you and hang you out to dry.
511995,Firetiger,2001-04-16 01:58:00,53,"You have the right to rent your cabin. CRN's reply about filing a tax return is correct but I would ignore the remainder of his message. I am an accountant by profession and I can assure you that it is not illegal to rent property (or earn other income) in Canada so long as you file the appropriate tax return, the same as Canadians do in the U.S.. As a matter of fact I have a U.S. client who owns and rents out his Canadian residence. I also have Canadian clients who U.S. property and earn income from it and we must file similar tax returns. This is all part of our free trade agreement. The only thing that would stop you from renting your cabin is if there are other municipal/county regulations barring you from doing so and those rules would equally apply to Canadians."
511996,whitey,2001-04-16 04:12:00,36,CRN is a dip-stick!!.I actually thought your map idea was quite original and funny.Is that $475 american or canadian?
