We would greatly appreciate any information that we can get about this lake. We will be primarily fishing for Walleyes and I understand that they generally use jigs and crawlers to catch them. How is the Northern Pike and Lake Trout fishing this time of year? I have traveled to several lodges in Ontario and while the fishing was o.k. it was not as good as advertised. I guess you never know until you get there. I talked to Brad Mullens at an outdoor show and he seemed like a really good guy. This will be my first fishing trip to Quebec, my son's first Canadian adventure, and any information about this lake and the fish that swim in it would be extremely helpful. Thank you in advance and good fishing to all of you!!"

Unfortunately for us, an extended cold front came through about a week before our trip, and the walleyes had gone deep and gone off feeding. Our sonar units marked lots of fish in every part of the lake but nothing shallower than 42 feet. Even with downriggers, we couldn't entice them. We had high winds and 3 to 4 foot waves mixed with rain and unseasonably cold temperatures for 4 days. We only managed 14 walleyes (11 released - didn't meet minimum length requirements), 2 lakers (2.5 lbs) and two pike (10 lbs but released).Brad and Ginny Mullens and their two boys are first rate. You couldn't ask for better hosts. We stayed at Smith's Pass camp - and excellent camp half way up the lake. The lake is about 15 miles long if you include Taylor Bay. This bay can be difficult to get to depending on water levels in the main lake. However, in July (warmer water), you could get out and walk the boat over the shallow sandbar at the end of the main lake.If you do a search on Ogascanane on this web site, you'll get serveral reports from those who have fished this lake. Many have had success, Consequently, you can't judge this lake by our experience. We plain just got unlucky with the weather.Keep a topographical map (31 M/1) of the lake with you in your boat with rocks marked well. Many are just at the surface. Brad has most if not all of them marked with plastic jugs.The gravel road in last year was in excellent shape. Although we all have 4 X 4's, we could have easily made the trip in cars. Have a good trip. Jay"
511960,j.sopp,2001-04-15 15:26:00,2,"Thanks for the information Jay, it is surely appreciated. Sorry to hear about the bad weather on your trip to Ogascanan, that is a shame. You are correct when you say that the weather plays a significant role in an anglers chance for success and it would not be fair to judge any lake under those conditions. Due to the fact that my son is fairly young, I just hope for decent weather and moderate fishing success on this trip. I will be driving a 4w drive vehicle into the camp and from the information that you gave me I shouldn't have a problem. Again, thanks for the info and have a good summer."
511961,Guest,2001-04-16 11:56:00,0,"I was also at Lake Ogascanan last September probably the same week as Jay. My experience was the same as his. I think that the Mullens are terrific and truly want their visitors to have the time of their life. The weather did not cooperate. In fact we were only able to fish for 4 hours on a 3 day trip. My only complaint is that the boats are not big enough for the waves that Lake O can produce. If I were to go again, I would tow in my own 16 footer.......but go slow on the way in. Enjoy your trip."
511962,Guest,2001-04-16 16:55:00,0,"Mark:I concur completely with you on the size of boat issue at Ogascanane. I took in a 15.5 foot aluminum with an 8 HP four stroke and my partner and I fished 8 hours or more every day - not comfortable fishing in 3 and 4 foot waves but we could fish. We found it very difficult to find any quiet water regardless where we went on the lake and we fished every part while we looked for quieter water.The other guys in our group rented boats and motors from Brad. Biggest problem was the shallow stern on those boats. In fact, you could take on water over the stern running half throttle. Four guys didn't fish one complete day for fear of their safety.I'd recommend taking in your own boat too.Our group has opted to give Lake Kipawa a try this time round (see www.kipawa.com). We are scheduled for 30 June until 7 July at Three Season's Camp. Jay"
511963,Guest,2001-04-17 11:48:00,0,"My group has often thought of going to Ogascanan, but instead ""gave Kipawa a try"" last year. What a great decision. Lots of walleye, and a couple larger ones. Several good size pike, and a couple larger (42"") ones, and we saw others catching Lake Trout all week long. We didn't fish for Lakers, but are going to try this year when we go in mid-June. What got us was this...the other guests said the fishing was slow and hoped that it picked-up soon. Hah !!!!Ogascanan looks good, but from what I hear from you guys, Kipawa will see my group for years to come. After all, not even the largest quantity or quality of fish is worth risking your life for in an undersized boat."
