512069,hoghunter,2001-04-20 04:18:00,159,"I get mine at a place called Witherspoons. It is a gas station/convienence store. Heading west out of Fort Francis on the main road, it is located on the right hand side, near the Mcdonald's on the other side of the road. We have stopped there the past two years. Leeches were not great, but they weren't too bad either. Good luck."
512070,Guest,2001-04-20 04:55:00,0,"Whitherspoons is a good place to stop. If you are heading west and north, like up highway 71 , through Nestor Falls, you can also get good leeches at Angler Pro Shop in Nestor Falls. Leech supply in Ontario should be better this year at least that is what wholesale suppliers have told us. Good fishing !!"
512071,Guest,2001-04-20 09:57:00,0,"jahloaf,Yes, you may purchase leeches by the pound in Fort Francis. However, don't expect the qualilty to be as good as you would receive from a bait dealer here in the States. First of all, when you buy a pound of leeches (at least the bait shops I've bought them from) they have not culled the leeches according to size. When you buy a pound, they are all mixed from very small to a few jumbos(when jumbos are available). Expect to pay more for a pound of leeches in Canada, even with the exchange rate, than in the U.S. (usually about $5.00 USD or more/pound). You may, however, get them in water and air for your trip. I would suggest that you call ahead and order them, if you have a large party, and they will be ready for you when you arrive.Since it is now illegal to bring leeches across the border, what you see, is what you get. A leech fishermen doesn't have many options when it comes to purchasing leeches across the border.Remember to keep your eyes open and your feet dry.S.v.m"
512072,Guest,2001-04-20 12:16:00,0,"I Bought a pound of leeches at Rainy Lake Sports in Fort Frances last August and they cost me $60 a pound. They were suppose to be large, but when we started fishing we noticed that many of them were no bigger than 1"" long. Good luck on trying to find decent leeches in Canada."
512073,Guest,2001-04-20 15:59:00,0,"Matt,I also purchased 2 lbs of leechs from Rainy Lake Sports during the second week in August of last year. The price you quoted "" 60 a pound "" must have been in Canadian dollars, correct? I may be mistaken, but I don't remember them costing that much/pound, please refresh my memory. One thing I haven't forgotten, however, we didn't have one leech in those two pounds over an inch and a half long. The one advantage to the very small leeches, is that you sure get alot of them. Now I realize that larger leeches are harder to come by that late in the season, but that was ridiculous. With gas predicted at $3.00/gal. this summer in the States (the Canadian resort we stayed at last summer was charging $4.50/gal. USD, can you imagine what it will cost this summer?) and leeches at $60.00/lb, I may have to rethink some of my summer fishing activities this year and stay a little closer to home!Remember to keep your eyes open and your feet dry.S.v.m"
