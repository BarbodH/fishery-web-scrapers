511825,Guest,2001-04-02 16:17:00,0,I have been fall crappie fishing Nestor Falls for years and would like to try it in the spring so one could C&R. I never really thought about doing the spring thing untill this long winter. I would like to hear of any good experences with early season crappies especially in the Nestor Falls and Souix Narrows area. Thanks in advance. Doc.

I fish out of Sioux Narrows and have heard of a few good spring bites in areas like Mist Inlet, Blueberry bay and Bear bay. The last two spots are well know crappie at various times through the summer and Mist Inlet is primarily spring and fall.If you have any questions drop me a line."

We have fished a lot the 1st or 2nd week of June and our best crappie fishing is evening off the Sunset Cove Dock, but not reliable. We have had good luck in Nestor area mid Sept. Be interested in your idea of accomidations."

Have been doing the fall crappie thing for about 6 years. We have always stayed at Helliar's and have no reason to go any place else. The cabins are fine, fair priced, dock service also good. and the crappies are usually good sized and not to far away. Walleyes are also there, without the need of a long ride. Les, Ethel, Glenn, Wayne and Gloria, the gang at Helliar's, are very nice and accomadating. They have several cabins from one bedroom on up. They also have motel rooms above the store. Their phone # is 807-484 2400. We stay there the last week in Sept. every year. Thanks for the info. for June, Doc E-mail [email protected] drop a line for any more info."

511830,Guest,2001-04-15 05:29:00,0,"Have fished Blueberry Is for walleye and some northern casting, not crappie. Would be interested in some spring (mid-June) crappie spots as well. Do find some in the little bay back up by Tinkers in Nestor.Spend most of the time for walleyes and starting to northern fish more. Have been up mid-sept and that seems better for crappie. Last year they really had not started yet.Always have a good time and able to find a place to catch fish in the Nestor are."
