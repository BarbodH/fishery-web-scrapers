We stayed at Motlongs Rod and Reel last year in one of their big cabins on the lake, which was nice. Those cabins are booked this year though. We are unfortunately booking late this year, which will make things harder. There will be two couples, and ony baby. We heard Breezy Point was nice, but have not seen it. Can anyone give us some suggestions thqt won't break the bank on a two week stay.Thanks For The Help,Walleyehawger"
