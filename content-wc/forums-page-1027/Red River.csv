511738,Guest,2001-03-27 20:40:00,0,Could you guys give me a little help. When do the cats up in the lockport area usually spawn. Also is there a secret water level that is the best? If you could choose one weekend to go when would it be? Lastly what type of structure do you usually fish? Thanks Brian
511739,Brian,2001-03-27 20:44:00,140,One more thing. What do you guys usually do during the days? The cats don't bite all day right? Is there any Walleye or Norhtern to be caught in the river or nearby lakes?Thanks again
511740,Backwater Eddy,2001-03-27 21:54:00,3871,"Cats do bite well most if not all day. You will need to move to find them if they pull up and move on you.As far as walleye I fish that region more in the fall and it can be a jig or a crankbait bite, it can change fast. Jig's are often the most productive for numbers of fish while cranks often produce the piggy walleye.Sorry I can not help you more with the spring walleye in the Canadian end of the Red as I am busy guiding the US RED at that time. From what I have been told it is often the case the walleye have generally returned to the lake by the time the June cat bite is on. There are a lot of factors that may change it like water levels, temperature, or current.A good place to check in at would be at Interlake Adventurers on 268 main street Selkirk, MB R1A 1s4 (204) 482-3229. Myles & Sharon McManus operate the store and would be glad to give you a update.Backwater Eddy...........><,,>"
511741,chrism,2001-03-28 11:13:00,429,"There is a post on this subject somewhere below. Cats bite all day, although morning and eve are sometimes more productive. June/july are good months. It goes like this - Look for depressions or drops in the river, anchor up current from them, cast out your bait, sit, be patient, watch rod tip jerk, reel in catfish...or freshwater drum...I'm not kidding!"
511742,Cat Eye Outfitter,2001-04-01 09:58:00,9,"I would have to say that a number of factors will effect the cat bite but as a massive generalization: Earlier in the season mid May til the end of June, Cats will bite throughout the day. There are so many cats that there always seems to be a fresh batch in at any time of the spawn (hence angling is not really effected to any great extent!) As the season progresses (including the spring period), Cats will tend to bite well in the morning and evening --- although there will be those days when they will bite throughout the day. Finally, in later summer we find that a night bite develops with the morning and evening bite being the best time for cattin'. Fall is a bit tricky and you really have to know where the holes are and how to present the bait --- you'll probably catch more greenbacks than cats!) Having said the preceding is by no means totally accurate as other factors have an enormous impact upon the bite: Personally I find that increased water flow and sudden changes in weather (eg. a cold front) will put the cats off for sometimes up to TWO (2) days -- of course you'll still catch fish but not as many as per usual. Another component of the bite is upon what the cats are feeding. Sure you'll catch 'em on stink baits, shrimp, rotten chicken livers etc. but knowing what they're really foraging on throughout the season will up your odds at a good catch. The main forage for cats appears to be suckers and goldeyes with frogs fitting in there a bit (but not in any great proportions). Catching cats at the Andrew's locks (lockport) is easy but catching many and catching them consistently is another issue. I hope this helps... I do have a wee bit of experience with this fishery. Keep your hooks sharp!DanCat Eye outfitterhttp://www.geocities.com/dkiazyk2000[email protected] The site has some articles of interest to those who'll visit Lockport!"

511744,Guest,2001-04-02 18:42:00,0,"I fish the Winnipeg River in the fall and fish out by Traverse Bay. About 5 years ago while heading out to the bay, I noticed a drop off in the channel of the river down to about 40'. There were fish stacked like sardines in there. I decided to throw in a jig and a redtail and WHAM! I no more than got the bait to the bottom and it got nailed. I proceded to catch about 10 cats that were all over 10 pounds with the largest in the neighborhood of 18 to 19 within about 20 minutes! That was a blast! Those fish were so hardy and I did bring them up real slow not to damage them. Since then, every year I find a drop off with them stacked up and easily catch a cat or two for fun and shore lunch. They sure are STRONG fish!"
