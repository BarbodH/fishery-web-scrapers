Earlier this year we bought them in Chapleau and thought the price was a bit inflated, about $50/lb.CAN. and one of the guys thought we were shorted on actual weight. I haven't had much experience with buying leeches and don't exactly know what a pound should look like so I can't say for sure, but from what I've read here, the price seems a bit high. Understandable considering the remoteness. I recall an outfitters store at the junction of 129 in Thessalon. Does anyone know if they carry them and are more reasonably priced? Otherwise maybe somewhere is Soo?"
522706,Guest,2002-07-21 11:34:00,0,Bought a pound from The Trading Post on Great Northern Rd [Hwy.17 north] on the east side of the road as you leave the Soo going north. They were around $22 US three weeks ago. If you are leaving the Soo going east this would be out of your way. Good Luck!!
522707,Guest,2002-07-21 12:16:00,0,"I would also have to recommend the Trading Post. I live in Sault Ste Marie, Ont and don't know of anywhere else. If you want send me an email and I can send you a map and directions. It's really not that much out of your way and they have a ton of other stuff available.My email is [email protected]"
522708,Guest,2002-07-21 20:06:00,0,Bought them in June at the Outpost store in Thessalon where you turn north on 129 wouldn't want to try to buy in Chapleau. You can call the place in Thessalon and get a price we called ahead to make sure they were in (delivery is on Friday) but I don't remember the price.
522709,eyeology,2002-07-21 20:54:00,5,Thanks guys. I'll try the trading post first. Prices always seem to be lower in the bigger cities. Do you happen to know if they are sorted by size or not?
522710,Guest,2002-07-22 20:58:00,0,"$50 lb. for leeches is very high, we sell them here in Ignace for $28 lb. I realize we are quite a distance from where you are talking about. If the leeches are large then there would be around 10-12 dozen in a lb. If they are a mixture, mostly medium there would be around 12-15 dozen in a lb. Sorry don't know where you can buy leeches down your way. Hope this helps you out."
