We were also guideless since most of the group has been fishing the same area of Lac Seul for about 12 summers in a row now. Just as someone else on this discussion wrote, we also had our best luck in shallow water...lots on Shiner minnows and Crawlers. The leeches you get up there tend to be on the small end. One guy in our group (who did the best) used Crawlers exclusively. But who really knows...quite honestly I think the fish up there would bite on a dirty sock if you put it on your hook. I love talking fishing up at Lac Seul, there is nothing like it! Makes it a little hard to get yourself up to go chase the Walleyes back here in MN!Have a good one-"
522026,Guest,2002-07-10 08:15:00,0,"Here's a grea report I found on a site I visit often.Daily guide reports are turned in at the office and accumulate with little fanfare as the month progresses. But when the first of the new month arrives, the stats guys on the guide crew quickly sort the pages and the number crunching begins. We knew that the numbers for June 2002 would be good, but we were still surprised when the final rough counts were totalled. June, historically, has been a good month for walleye volume, big pike and numbers of smallmouth. This year we combined the expected good pike and smallie fishing with exceptional walleye volume, tremendous numbers of big fish as well. At a glance we released 12 pike over 40"" compared to 11 in 2001. We had 21 smallies over 18"" compared to 15 in 2001. We had 32 walleyes over 29"" versus 14 for 2001, and 12 eyes over 30"". The top end for walleyes is impressive, but the real story is the number of big walleyes caught and released for the month with 241 over 27 inches. Lac Seul is it for trophies, no question about it. This past week was excellent and helped to close out an excellent month, and hopefully July will be another great month. For the week we had 13 walleyes over 29 inches and 96 over 27 inches, including 2 over 30"". We are finding walleyes where we expect to find them based on the calendar. Traditional seasonal hot spots have turned on and we are boating numbers of big fish from the sand flats on the deep side of developing cabbage weed beds. Pitching jigs to shallow rock piles and sand beaches is still producing numbers of fish but most of the big ones are being caught from deeper water. Bottom bouncers with spinners and minnows or crawlers are turning most of the bigger fish from 9 to 14'. I am still doing very well with power worms on crawler harnesses as well. Many of the guides are also back trolling jigs/twisters in deep water. Big pike are starting to show up on the developing main lake cabbage but we are still picking up half our pike while walleye fishing. For the week we had 3 over 40"" and 11 in the upper 30"" range and all released. The smallmouth action was consistent for the week despite the attention given the walleye fishing. We know that there is more to life and guiding then stats, but it is hard not to get excited about numbers this strong. We hope our great fortune continues for our guests. Most guests are rebooking to hold their spots for next year, can't say that I blame them. Check our site at http://www.justfishontario.com/reports.htm"
522027,Guest,2002-07-12 07:24:00,0,Gary at Evergreen Lodge gives a great report at http://www.justfishontario.com/reports.htm He is on the water all the time and really knows his stuff.
522028,Russ,2002-07-22 15:54:00,17,"I just got back from Lac Seul and had the best trip yet. Stayed with Ken and Brenda at Ojibway. Fished Wapesi Bay a lot. Really got them good on bouncers, cranks in the evening. The Wapesi River up to the first rapids was still holding fish. How many? To many to count. How big? Big!!!! After that who cares."
522029,Guest,2002-07-23 12:48:00,0,Fished within five miles of Deception Bay landing and stayed at the Lamplighter in town. Killed them. Liked the air conditioned rooms at night and meals at the Knobby's place.
522015,Cash,2002-06-30 09:09:00,73,"I just returned 6/28 from an almost unbelievable week of fishing on central Lac Seul. Our party of four caught dozens of fish in and over the slot (ALL RELEASED!). We actually had trouble some days catching fish for supper and the freezer, as they were mostly in and over the slot. 3,25"" walleyes tied for largest. We caught most of our fish on 3/8 oz. jigs w/twister tails and minnows. Color did not seem to be a factor. Sometimes we would change color just to see what would happen, they all worked. Picked up some on spinner/minnow and some nice northern on those too. If the wind was from the south we had great success at Ghost Narrows in 6-9 feet of water on the southwest shoreline. When the wind switched to from the N/NW we fished the north shore of Manitoba Point and did just as well. We also did well at the sand banks across from Ghost Narrows and the one at McKenzie Bay. The last two days the winds died down and the temps went into the 80's so we concentrated on Northerns. We caught a 37"" and two 36"" fish in the 11 to 12 lb. range. Lots more 30"" plus fish also(ALL RELEASED!).Husky Jerk Rapalas and large spoons took most of these fish. We stayed at the Onaway Lodge on central Lac Seul. Blair and Kathy Campbell were perfect hosts. Very nice camp. Remember, let them go, so they can grow!!!"
522016,guide7,2002-07-01 19:54:00,70,"just got back last night from Lac Seul / Mahkwa Lodge.Caught a lot of fish and had no rain issues. The water appears to be up about 12"" higher than last June, which was a bit high already.Didn't seam to bother the bite though. We mainly fish with leeches hanging on 1/4 - 3/8 oz jigs or a phelps floater lindy set-up.My northland tackle 3/8 oz whistler jigs with a white tail seemed a lot better than most others. Already booked for next year and counting the days.Good Luck 7 out"
522017,Guest,2002-07-02 06:20:00,0,At what depth of water did you find most of the walleyes you caught?Thanks
522018,Cash,2002-07-02 15:10:00,73,"Hawg, 6-9 feet and 7 seemed to be the majic number. If you are going up soon , they may be deeper. They should be moving that way. Good Luck!"
522019,guide7,2002-07-02 20:07:00,70,morning and afternoon depths were ranging from 9-14 feet off island points and the sundown bite was best in 5-9 feet on the daily prevailing windward shorelines. We did mark a lot of 18-26 foot deep fish but never needed to work for them. The shallower ones were working just fine.7 out
522021,Guest,2002-07-03 09:21:00,0,Just returned last week from Lac Seul and we had an unreal time fishing this year. We fished out of Andersons Lodge and had a top notch time as always! The biggest fish of the week was a 31.25 inch with many others in the 26--28inch range. The 31.25 was the largest we have ever got in the 10 yrs of fishing Lac Seul. Total fish count for the 4 days of fishing was about 400-500. Lots and Lots of BIG fish were caught but we hand no problem finding some 18's to filet up. And yes the 31.25 was released! Have fun...
522022,Guest,2002-07-03 09:59:00,0,"Hey Fowl,we also experienced a great trip w/ Andersons this year. Did you use guides and the 20' cruisers? If guides, who did you have and would you recommend?Our group concluded the bigger boats were necessary in order to have the flexibility to run further up the lake for fishing...also a little more comfortable. Our guides were Roy (Little Deer) and Jim. Glad you had a good trip, we're already booked for next year."
522020,Guest,2002-07-03 12:15:00,0,"Returned from Lac Seul 6/30. Fished main lake close to river channel. Caught most of our fish in 8 to 15 feet of water fishing windy side of islands. Had good luck on twister tails char/ora/white but best luck on leechs on a jig or a Lindy Rig. Have been fishing Lac Seul for 37 years and this year was in the top three for great fishing. We caught large numbers of slot fish and tons of 17/18"". We also had 13 fish over slot including three over 30...biggest was 32.5 and she was a heavy set girl. Didnt weigh her but we did release her. Caught her on a 3/8 oz char jig with a Leech in 15 ft of water on a large flat between two islands about 100 yds from the river bed at the west end of Aldous bay. Didnt fish for Pike but caught plenty of 8 to 12 lbs on jigs."
522023,Jigger1,2002-07-04 13:45:00,234,"Our group of 6 just returned from Silver Water Wheel Lodge on Lac Seul and had nothing short of a stellar time and unreal fishing. As a group we caught and released over 400 walleyes over the slot, 109 of the walleyes were over 25 and broke out as following.30.5 was the big dog4  29 walleyes13  28 walleyes15  27 walleyes27  26 walleyes49  25 walleyesAlmost ever fish was caught in less than 15' of water with the majority caught on bottom bouncers. The remaining fish were caught on either 3/8 or 1/2 ounce jigs. I've already started to count down the days until next year. Good fishing everyone!"
522025,Guest,2002-07-05 06:46:00,0,Great Report! Am leaving in about 1 hour for fishermens cove.looking forward to our 19th trip. Am dissapointed with the water levels as it is hard to find a decient shore lunch spot at some of the places I fish. however its less likely to ruin a lower unit! they all will be relesed with the exception of the ones for shore lunch!
