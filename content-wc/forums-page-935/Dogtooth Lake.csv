521934,Guest,2002-07-09 14:34:00,0,"Larry,I think I found the web site where you found the report for 2002. I noticed those guys even have a golf scorecard posted on their web site. It doesn't sound to me like they are as serious of fisherman as the rest of us are. If you look close at their results, they had 210 fish total, not just walleyes. They only had about 21 walleyes. Looks like they had a good time though. They were up there pretty early in the year, late May.Chris,AS far as leeches, we stopped at Rainy Lake Sports on the east side of Fort Frances. They were very accomodating. Witherspoons is also in Fort Franceson the west end of town. I would call both places to get a price quote from them. If you get there and they are more expensive than you were quoted (like what happened to us), you can negotiate with them. Rainy Lake threw in 5 dozen minnows as they raised their leech prices by $2/lb just prior to us arriving. I would also ask if they sort their leeches as you want jumbo if you can get 'em. Have fun and tell Wayne ""Hi from Sheriff Randy of the Outpost"". He'll know what you mean.Fish Tails"
521935,Fishing Junky,2002-07-10 05:20:00,182,"I believe the fisherman in the fishing show you are referring to is Butch Furtman out of Duluth. I know he goes up about the third week of July. I have fished Dogtooth for seven years and also concentrate on Kilvert Lake. Your right when you say it is not a numbers lake, although have caught many eaters in the evening hours at certain spots. Great lake, and big fish. Good luck, Junky........."
521936,chris,2002-07-10 08:49:00,23,It is Butch Furtman and I am pretty sure he will be up there starting saturday. I will say hi to wayne and will post how we do when we get back. We leave friday. chris
521937,Guest,2002-07-11 05:30:00,0,I fished Dog tooth for the first time last year in early August. I found crankbaits very effective for big fish on the windy points during the middle of the day. Once we pinpointed the pattern we found we had the lake to ourselves as no one seem to be doing this.It had to be windy to be effective!I plan on returning this year and have stocked up on a few particular cranks.This lake has to be one of the best average size fish lake I have ever fished. I live up here and have fished many. Dog tooth is at the top of the scale for big catchable fish.Jeff
521938,Guest,2002-07-21 10:24:00,0,"We just got back from dogtooth. We had an ok trip. It was in the 90's all week and sunny. Hard to stay out and fish all day, we would tough it out until about 2 and then go back out around 5. We did find alot of bigger fish in Kilvert on a couple of reefs. One in particular gave up 2 ""29's, 3 ""28's, 3 ""27's, and alot of 25 and 26's. We had 8 guys fishing for 7 days and maybe caught 220 walleyes. The camera crew with butch furtman was there and they did pretty well the 2 days they fished, but even they had to put in a full day to get all the fish they got. Still alot of fun to be fishing for a week and not at work. We caught all of our fish on lindy rigs with leeches or crawlers. chris"
521939,Fishing Junky,2002-07-21 14:37:00,182,"Hey Chris. Sounds like an excellent trip. Those fish you mentioned are worth every penny spent in my book. I have fished Kilvert many times and find it to be a great lake. Glad ya had a fun safe trip. Many more fish to ya, Junky........."
521924,chris,2002-06-27 14:20:00,23,"wondering if anyone has been up to dogtooth lately. We are heading up for a week in early July and any info would be great. Like what are you getting them on, length of snells, etc. You know all the good stuff. I can barely sleep at night and it just got harder today as the outdoor channel played the show from dogtooth today. I just about quit work and left today. For those of you who have never been there WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR. chris"
521925,snaggletooth,2002-07-07 13:26:00,135,We're also headed up this week and are looking for information if anyone has been up there. Also a good place to buy leeches would be appreciated. snaggletooth
521926,Guest,2002-07-08 09:13:00,0,"Was that the show with Babe Winkleman and Wayne Jones?I was up there in June. We were fishing mostly shorelines with drop offs going down to about 22 feet or so. However, I would think that the fish would be on the reefs and edges of the reefs by now. Look for any mid-lake reef structure. We fished primarily with jigs and bounced around from spot to spot. Don't stay in one spot too long and play the wind. Good luck!Where are you guys staying?Remember to release those fish as fast as you can. Know where your cameras are at all times!Fish Tails"
521927,chris,2002-07-08 10:51:00,23,"It was the show with wayne and another guy, but not babe winkelman. The guy that does this show is up their the same time we are each year and i cannot remember his name right now. We stay at dogtooth lake resort and have had nothing but a great time each year."
521928,Larry,2002-07-08 14:17:00,357,I just looked at the weekly fishing report for Dogtooth. Eight fisherman caught 210 fish for the week??? Sorry guys that doesent do it for me. We have a lot of 200 fish days (group of 6). If Im reading this wrong please let me know. I eat more Walleye everyday than that group caught.
521929,Guest,2002-07-08 16:31:00,0,"Larry,What fishing report are you looking at? Do you have a web site address? How big are the fish you catch? You sound like a meat hunter and not a trophy fisherman. If you are a meat hunter, you should stay away from Dogtooth.Fish Tails"
521930,chris,2002-07-09 05:05:00,23,"as fish tails said if you want meat stay away. You may have 200 fish days, but I bet very few of them equal the size of the 200 caught on dogtooth for the week. We also have plenty of good fish number days, but the opportunity for a large walleye is unsurpassed in this lake. We talked to wayne a couple of weeks ago and he caught a 34 inch walleye that weighed over 14 pounds and he said that was the 3rd one brought into the resort already this year to go along with bunches of walleyes over 30 inches. I'll take the chance at one of those over 200 fish that don't exceed 25 inches anyday. chris"
521931,Larry,2002-07-09 06:36:00,357,"Easy guys....Im sorry if I offended you and Dogtooth. I was simply very surprised when I saw the fishing report I saw. Maybe the report I saw was a bad week. Our group goes to Canada twice a year and fished a total of 11 days during the last two trips. We caught and released over two thousand Walleye during that time and had 14 Walleye over 29"" with the biggest being 33 1/2"". The Lakes we fish have been excellent the last 5 years and the average Walleye is in the 20 to 22"" range. We are not meat fisherman but we do eat Walleye two meals a day and we transport NO fish back to the states. The cost per person for both trips (total 11 days)$1200."
521932,chris,2002-07-09 07:22:00,23,"larry, I don't think you offended anyone especially not me. It sounds like you have a great lake. Dogtooth is more known for trophy fish than it is for lots of numbers. Where did you see a report on dogtooth, and what is the name of this lake you fish on. chris"
521933,Larry,2002-07-09 08:32:00,357,Typed Dogtooth Lake into search engine and went to Dogtooth Lake Lodge Report for 2002. We fish Lac Seul in June and fish the Red River in Manitoba in October. Both fisherys have been great. Big Walleyes come into the Red in the fall from Lake Winnipeg. Last year we fished there five days and had 100+ Walleyes over 7lbs with the biggest being 13 1/2. This River can be fished with your own boat and it is awesome. We fish North of Selkirk....check it out on a map.
