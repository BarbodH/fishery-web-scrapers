Any info about fishing this lake, especially at about this time, would be appreciated. Locations, lures/bait, techniques all are needed since this will be a first Canada trip for a couple of kids and 2 adults. Would like it to be a special experience for these first timers. Any info on the camp and its equipment? Thanks. Bill"
