522542,Guest,2002-07-21 12:16:00,0,Our group just retuened from Lac Seul and the fishing was an 8. We caught lots of Walleye but only one over 28'. Pike fishing was great in the weedbeds with spinnerbaits. Smallmouth were bonus fish while catching eyes.
522545,Guest,2002-07-21 19:18:00,0,"WACKER, GREAT REPORT, OUR FIRST TRIP IS PLANNED FOR AUGUST 17 WITH MY THREE SONS, TO EAR FALLS SIDE OF THE LAKE, WHERE CAN I GET A HOLD OF A GOOD MAP?? ANY HINTS ON WHAT TO PLAN ON FOR PRESENTATIONS? LEECHES ? CRAWLERS? CRANKS? ANY TIPS WILL BE HELPFUL...I GET TO STAY AS LONG AS WE CATCH FISH!! THE BOYS ARE 12, 14 AND 16..THANK YOU IN ADVANCE....."
522546,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-21 19:36:00,6,"We always stop and get our fishing permits at a bait store on the east side of the road when you first start by Lac Seul. The shop has a full selection of maps for Lac Seul,your outfitter probably also has them and Im sure most other bait shops will to. I like to fish Leechs on jigs but minnows are also excellent. Im sure that if you talk to your oufitter he will put you on fish. Lac Seul is a Walleye Factory and I have never had a bad fishing trip there. Next year I start taking my Grandson (10) to Lac Seul. I just took him to the Red River in Manitoba to catch giant Catfish. He caught a bunch of fish (estimate 130 in three days) they averaged 15 lbs with the biggest being near 30....he had a ball. Hope you and your boys have a great time. One piece of equipment that I think is a neccisty is a Depth Finder. Use the wind to your advantage and fish windy banks and look for drop offs on your Finder. Watch where other boats are fishing and fish the same general area. You should see lots of boats at the north end of the lake around Ear Falls....fish slow and keep your jigs on the bottom....Good Luck"
522543,Guest,2002-07-22 06:31:00,0,"Wacker: Could you give me some clarification on what you mean by the ""E"" Tree. We know the two Islands to go thru to get to Aldous Bay But this sounds like a different spot. Any help would be appreciated. Thank You"
522544,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-22 08:49:00,6,When you go between the two islands you will come out at the beginning of Aldous. Take a left and head up into Aldous. Immediatly start looking on your right side for a small island with one tree that stands about 25 feet tall. You will see that the wind has made it grow so it appears there is a backwards E formed by the top branchs. This E points straight up Aldous. Go to the next island up Aldous on your right that is very close to the riverbed. It has a large stump on its river edge. Turn in just before the island and fish the saddle between the two islands in front of you. Have caught fish all over that saddle and flat. Try to stay within 40 to 50 feet of both islands and fish 10 to 15 ft water. This year the saddle was most effective. We fish all the way up and down Aldous on windy structure or flats. This area produced the best I have ever had at Lac Seul ....Good Luck
522547,Guest,2002-07-22 18:10:00,0,Wacker....What color jigs worked the best for you. Do you use twister tails and if so what color? What other techniques do you find effective?
522548,Guest,2002-07-23 11:46:00,0,"wacker, thanks for the tips, the boys are pretty good fisherman, but they all have the dream of getting into a big one or some toothy northerns as well.. we will give all presentations a try and have a good time doing it. will report back after our trip.i would be happy to hook up with you on mille lacs if you ever get over this way!!"
522549,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-23 17:52:00,6,"tc-an-eye-chaser, Thanks for the invite to Mille Lac. Never have fished it and it would be great to give it a go sometime. Im sure you and your boys will do great on LS. It is a Walleye Factory at its best this year. Im going to Cass lake in three weeks with my kids and their kids (12 of us). The wife and I are going to Oahe in South Dakota in September. Never fished Oahe before and we are really looking forward to it. October is the trip that really gets me excited me and my fishing buds are going to the Red River in Manitoba for some Big Eyes. Last year we had 6 over 10lbs and and bunchs of 6-8 lbs....Good Luck on LS and let me know how you [email protected]"
522532,Guest,2002-07-17 20:08:00,0,"dear wacker help i need a response quick friday i will be going to Mahkwa resort just north of Vaughn lake . could you please be more specific about where you fish on aldous bay. are you near Derwin island? or Dominion islands? or Deer islands from a map, there appears to be a large island about 4 to 6 miles long on the south side of the river bed in aldous bay. from the map this stretch of island appears to drop off to 100 feet of water in a hurry do you fish this shore island ? where are the flats between islands 100 yards from the river bed? thanks please respond as soon as possible jcs"
522533,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-18 05:26:00,6,"jcs, We fish all the way up into Aldous bay. We had our best fishing the last trip at anyplace along the river bed that we could find a flat or structure change. If you know where Black Bay is (one mile east of fish gut bay)you simply go to the entrance of Aldous Bay and start fishing on the south side of the river channel. The large island you are talking about I believe is the area we Fished with great success its north side which should be the south side of Aldous actually is made up of several small islands. The whole area adjacent to Aldous has been great for us this year....Good Luck"
522534,whitetip1,2002-07-18 06:17:00,53,"JCS,I was at Mahkwa earlier this month for the first time. Don't worry about catching fish, just fish windy points and around islands. I caught alot of walleye and saugers on the north side of point Mahkwa is on. Try Eagle island (sw and west side) if wind is blowing from the west. Also troll crankbaits in front of the big sand bank across from the resort (8-12 ft). We tried lots of areas close to the resort and caught fish just about every spot we tried.Have Fun,Dave"
522535,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-18 08:06:00,6,I agree with Whitetip...Lac Seul is having a great year and good structure with wind on it will yield Walleye. We of course have lots of spots after fishing LS for 37 years and all of them gave us fish ...some a lot better then others...Thas why they call it Fishing not Catching.
522536,whitetip1,2002-07-18 08:52:00,53,"Walleye Wacker,In your 37 yrs on LS, have you had any experience with any muskie in the areas you fish?Dave"
522537,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-18 11:26:00,6,"Whitetip 1, I used to do a lot of Pike fishing and had picked up a few Muskie doing that ( 4 or 5 in 37yrs). Never did fish for Muskie exclusivly and the biggest I ever got was only around 35"" caught him probably 10-12 years ago on a spinner bait. Have seen some dandys cruise by us when we were Walleye fishing but not for a few years."
522538,Guest,2002-07-18 20:01:00,0,"Walley WackerSounds like a great trip! Looking at doing our first Lac Seul trip next year. Due to budget, probably have to tent camp and launch boat every day like you did. Any recommendations on a campground and which boat launch did you use to access the Aldous Bay area? Looks like Aldous is a long way from everything. One last question, I have an explorer series map of the lake, is their a better map available? Thanks for sharing your experience."
522539,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-19 07:22:00,6,Wish I could help you. We park the Winnebago in a friends yard who is on the lake and use his boat ramp. You should be able to find some camp sites on the Internet and I dont think you have to go to Aldous to catch fish. But if you do get to Aldous remember me.
522540,Guest,2002-07-20 00:32:00,0,Walleye: This will be my 3rd yr.at Black Bay Lodge and our groups 5th yr. We go last week in July every yr. I know the area your talking about and it seems you can find walleye about everywhere in that area.Last yr. we had alot of wind so we could'nt venture out to far.Two yrs. ago we slaughtered them.Do you ever venture over to Vaughn Lake area (its not a bad day trip).How high is the water on Lac Seul? We get tired of catching Northerns so were always looking for the Big Walleyes.I'm glad you did so well I hope our trip is as good as yours was.
522541,Guest,2002-07-20 04:27:00,0,"Big Eyes, Have fished Vaughn but there are always boats in there and I think the fishing is better around Black Bay. We used to go in July and the River Bed pattern has always produced for us. The best area is east of the ""E"" tree. The tree is located on a small island on the south side of the channel. Go southeast out of Black Bay past the green island marker to the channel you will see ""E"" on your left...go between the two islands to the left of ""E""....Good LUCK"
522522,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-15 16:22:00,6,"Just got back from Lac Seul and the Walleye fishing was as ""GOOD AS IT GETS"". This was our second trip to Lac Seul this year and the first one was one of my best in 37 years but this last one was even better. We caught slot fish by the hundreds and many over the slot. Four biggest Walleye were 32,321/2,33,34. One of the guys in our group lost 2 Hogs....sorry Jim. Caught most fish on Leechs on jigs (char-White) and some on jigs and twister tails (char jigs-white or orange tails). Fished mostly 10 to 20 ft water ...best around 15. Large flats close to deep water in Aldous Bay area."
522523,Wade,2002-07-15 18:41:00,11,"I am going up in about 3 weeks myself, good to hear fishing was fantastic. I am not sure what area you were fishing, I myself will be located in the South East/West area of the lake. I was surprised to hear you fished with Leeches(not that Lac Seul walleyes will not bite leeches), usually you hear minnows or crawlers. Curious to know where you purchased your leeches and how big were they? My experiences with buying leeches in Canada is they run a tad bit on the small side.If you get a chance I would appreciate if you could send me an email, it would be nice to chat with someone about the big lake. This will be my 3rd year, and any info regarding depths, locations, bait etc would be great. [email protected]Thanks for the update,Wade"
522524,zugbug,2002-07-15 21:03:00,67,"We purchased our leeches for our trip in early july at the Can-Op or Rainy river Sports shop right on the river in Fort Francis on the way out of town toward #502. Jumbo leeches were $39.95 Canadian and Reg. Leeches 29.95 per Pound. We usually picked up our leeches at Golden bear, But the Quality(size) this year Was Much Better. We just caught so many fish on cranks that we gave away almost all our leeches and 1 1/2 flats of crawlers before we left.Zugbug"
522525,Jigger1,2002-07-16 06:00:00,234,Wacker - I thought we had a hot trip with the big dog coming in at 31.5. Where the heck were you fishing that your group boated 4 over 32. (I'm not sure where Aldous Bay is) That's not only amazing ... it's unheard of! Congratulations on an outstanding trip!
522526,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-16 08:15:00,6,"Aldous Bay is located on the North Shore of the east central part of the lake. It is a bay that is about4 to 6 miles long and part of it is in the main river channel. We have had great luck in the ares next to the river channel both times this year. I really believe that any areas next to the river channel can be good. This is a pattern I have fished on Lac Seul for 37 years and it has always been good but this year it is great. We fish flats,island points,drops close to river bed and always look for windy side of river bed. Best production for us has been flats between islands within 100 yds of river bed. We are fishing east and south of Manitoba point on the north shore...four miles east of fish gut bay...north shore,north of Vaughn lake. Check some maps its not hard to find this area."
522527,retire55,2002-07-16 14:19:00,1029,"Walleye Wacker:Great fishing experience but how many of those over 32 inch fish were released?Based upon your statements ""This was our second trip to Lac Seul this year and the first one was one of my best in 37 years but this last one was even better. We caught slot fish by the hundreds and many over the slot"", I am unaware of any rationale to support harvesting those large females (each with the capacity to spawn 600,000 eggs).Perhaps, you just forgot to mention that they were all released. Jay"
522528,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-16 15:00:00,6,Great point Jay !!! The only fish we keep are for supper and they are the small ones. We release everything else and we also bend down the barbs on our hooks. I want the fishing to be there for future Walleye Wackers (three Grandchildren)
522529,retire55,2002-07-16 17:16:00,1029,Walleye Wacker:That's great news!! Congratulations to you and your group of ethical and responsible walleye enthusiasts. Many of the posters on this board are already personally aware of the devastating impacts to some lakes associated with the over harvest of big females. Jay
522530,Winnie,2002-07-16 22:02:00,375,"Wacker,Congrats on a tremendous trip. Curious at which fish camp you stay when you go up. Mind sharing that info? Thanks."
522531,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-17 05:54:00,6,The first trip we stayed at Black Bay Outpost . It is an outpost operated by Lac Seul Lodge. The second trip we camped out and launched our boat everyday. Im trying to get the boys to go back in September so we may avail ourselves to the great bite of 2002.
