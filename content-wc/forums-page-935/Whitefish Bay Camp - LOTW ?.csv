521829,Mort,2002-07-22 15:48:00,13,"I would go to Witch Bay Camp about twenty miles north of Sioux Narrows. They have the best walleye fishing on the LOTW in their area. Just look at their fishing reports on http://www.justfishontario, they publish a daily fish log on what the guests are doing. I have been there and they treat you real good. It's an American plan camp, so all you have to do is fish. The camp boats are all new upgraded models with 40's or bigger. This has been one of the best years for walleyes there, and Marv Kiley used to do muskies for the camp. Bob Meshicomer films muskies out of there every year. Had four over 48"" one year with the biggest at 54.5"" Good luck wherever you go."
