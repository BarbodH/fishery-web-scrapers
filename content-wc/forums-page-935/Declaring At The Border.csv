Say I have two people in the vehicle and two cases of beer do I tell them or is it just anything over what I am supposed to have. Any help is appreciated. Thanks"

Especially alcohol, cigarettes etc. If you don't tell them and they search you you will be in big trouble. If you purchased 100 dollars worth of souvenirs tell them. If you bought some milk and that's it tell them that too. If it's nothing over a certain limit they'll let you pass without paying duty."
