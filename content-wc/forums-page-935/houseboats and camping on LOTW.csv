Prices on houseboats and whether or not they are worth it would be appreciated. A buddy and I usually stay at Arrowhead Resort in Nestor Falls and fish LOTW, but are looking to either rent a houseboat or camp on an island or shore somewhere. Thanks for any info that can be provided!Fish on!"

We have been happy with the condition of the houseboat ( a 52 by 16 foot boat) and the service provided by the vendors. Their operation is located in Morson and I believe you can access the Sabaskong Bay area from their location. We have never fished that area of the lake and have parked our houseboat in the Sandy Bay and Firebag Island area.
