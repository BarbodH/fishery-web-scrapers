We go to their drive in - Halleys Camp on Umfreville Lake and it turns out I had been to their Rogers Lake Outpost about 10 years ago when it was owned by another party which also was out of Minaki. The Halleys have been in business for a lot of years, we have been to their place the last three years and have only had good things to say about them, I would expect their fly in operations to be equally well run.Good luck.Paul"

Members of the Grassy Narrows office of the OPP with assistance from members of the Grassy Narrows First Nation Territory and the OPP emergency response team are searching the area. The OPP underwater search and recovery unit has also been called in to assist with the incident, which is under investigation. Kenora Daily Miner"

Alex is a great guy and valuable source for fishing info. I dont know how maynard lake is but dowswell and the surrounding portage lakes were simply increadable. lots of eyes and smallies and pike. I even caught my first lake trout there, thanks to alex's tips. and that was at the end of august. I'd recommend them to anyone and plan on going back again myself. any specific questions I can answer for you, feel free to ask."
