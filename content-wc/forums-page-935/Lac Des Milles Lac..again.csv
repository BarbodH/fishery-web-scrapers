522673,Guest,2002-07-19 08:16:00,0,Hi I'm once again asking for updated information on Lac Des MIlles Lac. I'm going to ThunderBird Resort for the middle of August and would like to be updated on the fishing conditions. Thanks a lot.Jen.
522674,Thumper,2002-07-19 14:25:00,133,Lac has been producing real well as of late. The hot weather has slowed things down a bit but fishing early and late and deeper has produced some fine catches. You'll do real well.

I went to this lake a couple of weeks ago with the intention of fishing for walleye (although anything will do) Fished Five Sisters Islands and Boot Bay. Since it was rather hot and sunny, I only caught one walleye, although I managed quite a few pike and one lovely smallmouth bass. Will be fishing for bass and walleye when I go in August."
