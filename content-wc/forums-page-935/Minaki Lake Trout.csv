522633,doc,2002-07-19 06:13:00,143,Does anyone know of any Lake Trout lakes near Minaki?We are going to be up there for a week in Aug and would like to trailer the boat to the nearest trout lake and give them a try.
522634,Guest,2002-07-19 07:39:00,0,Worth and Sword Lakes have lake trout. This is actually a combination of two lakes. Go all the way to the end of the first lake and boat through a small creek to the second lake. I know both these lakes have trout and I have had the best luck in the second lake. It's off the road that goes to Whitedog.Also a really good lake trout lake is Lake Vermillion. You can portage into this lake from two portages off of big sand. It's located east of Big Sand. You can also put in at Eno(or Emo lake) and take a very short portage into Vermillion. Just look on a local map.Good luck
522635,Guest,2002-07-19 13:20:00,0,I am going up there tomorrow and would like to know the best way toget into Lake Vermilion from Big Sand? Is there a way through Vermilion bay into this lake? Also any info on fishing spots once in the lake? Depth and baits would be nice? Downriggers are no problem. Thanks for the info! I have heard there are trout in big sand is this true? Thanks again!
522636,Reels,2002-07-19 13:37:00,2876,"I believe the lake is Lake Ena in Reddit. Vernilion is a good trout lake and has some giant Northerns.Ray and Gloria Paul owned the resort, and I believe the son is running it now. They have boats you can rent on Vermilion after the short protage. If you launch into Ena, the resort is on the right side down bit. Been a while since I have been there, so a call might save you some time.Tight Lines.<{{}}><"

I have fished Vermillion many times over the past years and have caught many nice Lake Trout,and also large pike there.The portage from Ena Lake goes up a hill and is about a 1/4 mile walk,but well worth the effort The resort has a new owner this year,I will be there in the middle of August,with the former owner and friends to fish.Larry S"
522638,doc,2002-07-21 10:59:00,143,I am kind of looking for a lake I can get my own boat into. I am not against trailering to an access but would like to fish from my own boat.
