Consequently, that does represent a potential possibility. In case you wish to follow up on this possibility, you can check out their web site and use the store locator function to see the Canadian Tire stores in Thunder Bay at http://www.canadiantire.caHowever, I believe if I was travelling as far as you, I, too, would want to have the security of knowing that I had a supply of night crawlers with which to fish. By the way, apparently Liddles will sell crawlers by the dozen at $2.50. Anyway, just thought I'd do a little poking around this AM on the net. I've been retired for 4 years now and consequently have lots of time. Jay"

We are going to ""Liddles"", we've been going there anually fow the last 8 years, it's a great place to go. The accomomndations are very good and so is the fishing. We called them this past week and found out they will have some night crawlers. It's good to know about the Thunder Bay area also. We fly a private plane and a soon as we clear customs we venture on. We hope it is not as hot as it is here.Thanks."
522510,Guest,2002-07-15 15:01:00,0,"Is it permissable to take nightcrawlers (dew worms) into Canada? I've heard some say that you can't, but I have been told you can, if they are not in soil (dirt). If they are transported in newspaper or peat moss it is ok. Do any of you know for sure?"
522511,fishinnut,2002-07-15 15:12:00,642,It is perfectly legal to bring crawlers to Canada but they cannot be in dirt. Buy some worm bedding.
522512,Reels,2002-07-15 15:12:00,2876,Must be worm bedding. Dont think peet moss is gonna cut it.<{{}}><
522513,retire55,2002-07-15 16:23:00,1029,"Arnie:Why not just purchase required number of night crawlers once you arrive in Canada? Same thing goes for outboard motor gas, beer, liquor and other such things. Jay"
522517,Guest,2002-07-15 16:33:00,0,Buy everything you need when you get into Ontario they appreciate the business and after a period of time you may make some cantacts with the folks up there who can put you onto some very nice water.We have made friends up there who are lifelong friends that we go back and forth with.len just my .02
522518,Guest,2002-07-15 17:24:00,0,couldn't agree more with all of the above posts.
522519,SWeed,2002-07-15 23:23:00,66,"Worms cannot be in soil when taken into Canada. Use worm bedding to be on the safe side. ...Riddle me this Batman....... About 95% of the worms sold in the midwest(USA) are from Canada (near Toronto). They are shipped here in the soil you get when buying a flat. I could never understand why they can't be in the same soil when going back into Canada. I used to be in the wholesale bait business. And occassionally used this to my advantage... I would buy a truckload of say 12# worms and when they get here they are more like 8 or 10. I would call the distributer and tell him no way at the 12# price, if he would not lower the price I would tell them to take em back to Canada. Which they couldn't do, they had to sell em to someone south of the border or get rid of the soil, usually they would get more realistic about the price. So, if you buy the worms here or in Canada, a canadian made some money off of you. I agree with the post about buying them at or near where you are fishing, as it can give you a one up on where the fish are biting...."
522514,Guest,2002-07-16 05:19:00,0,"I would buy the worms in Canada if we could. We fly from Ohio to Thunder Bay, we don't leave the airport. From Thunder Bay we fly to Armstrong,or Pickle Lake, we have never seen any place to buy them there, and we don't have a vehicle. From there we fly to Lake Miminiska (via float plane), and they usually do not have worms there,(remote) or they have trouble keeping them until August.I don't want to come across as ""cheap"", the price of us getting there and paying for the accommodations is not cheap. I thought that since 9/11 they have changed their regulations. I've been fishing Canada at least once a year for over 30 years, and have enjoyed every trip. We have always taken worms. We fish Lake Erie every week, but we enjoy all of ""the old boys"" getting together, usually 7 to 8 friends.Thanks....tight lines to all !"
522516,Guest,2002-07-19 08:13:00,0,we will be coming through the falls on the way to wabaskang in later aug. I was going to buy a flat of crawlers here before I leave. What is the price of a flat there and where can I buy them. I wouldn't want to get there and not be able to get them...
522520,Guest,2002-07-19 08:24:00,0,"How long in between flights? You might have time to cab, or walk down to Canadian tire and buy some there. It's not far from the airport. I'd bring you some but I don't think my boss would appreciate me storing a bunch of worms at the airport...lol."
