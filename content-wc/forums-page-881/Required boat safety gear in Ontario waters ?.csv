530658,Willy,2003-05-07 21:30:00,4,Don't forget plastic cups for your beer. You'd hate to cut yourself on a piece of glass in case you drop your beverage...this way nobody gets hurt. Remember...safety first.
530656,BD,2003-05-07 21:35:00,739,A warden that checked me on LOTW told me the boat horn was not enough of a signaling device because my battery might go dead etc. He told me to get a whistle or other signaling device that didn't rely on the boats electrical system. He check me two days later in the same area and the first thing he asked to see was the manual signaling device he had told me to get.

530649,Guest,2003-05-06 09:01:00,0,I beleive you need to have 2 oars in your boat as well. We were warned 3 years ago by an Ontario MNR officer that we needed to have two. 14 DAYS TO RED LAKE...........
530650,retire55,2003-05-06 10:07:00,1029,TJ_Tom:Reference for the information you require is at:http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/obs-bsn/sbg-gsn/main_e.htm
530651,bigfish1965,2003-05-06 12:02:00,3210,"I believe there is a clause that states that visitors only need have the equipment mandated by the jurisdiction they live in when visiting for less that 45 days. So if you are in for a week, you only need the same equipment that you need at home.http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/obs-bsn/facts/foreign_e.htm#3"
530652,Big Tim,2003-05-06 17:25:00,63,"Do the Regulations apply to the rental boats we get from the lodges? I've never had all that,& other than the rotted oar, any saftey items we brought ourselves."
530653,Guest,2003-05-06 22:58:00,0,a couple years ago the lodges started including some safety devices like whistle and flashlight. You had to be off the water by dark because you had no running lights. but thats only about 4 hours a day during the summer.
530654,bigfish1965,2003-05-07 04:03:00,3210,"The operators who rent you the boat are responsible for supplying the safety equipment. If you look at the Canadian Coast Guard site, you will see what those items are."
530657,rebelrn2001,2003-05-07 19:49:00,1563,"Yes you are only required to have safety gear from where you are from. I was stopped in NW Ontario a few years ago and the only thing the warden recommended was that I attach a length of line to my throwable cushion. This allows the person throwing it to someone in the water to keep the one end and pull them back aboard if someone is overboard. When we go to Canada now, I attach the 50' line to my throwable and am set. That day I was stopped, I was just contemplating tapping a beer that was in my cooler!! Glad I didn't."
530655,Karl,2003-05-07 21:08:00,63,"Yes, they definitly apply to rental boats. Your lodge owner has to provide them for you - unless they're feelin' lucky with the law."
