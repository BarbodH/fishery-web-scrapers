530399,Herman,2003-05-03 19:06:00,5,"In Toronto the gas prices have dropped to 49.9 cents a litre($1.40 US). It is a special promotion the gas companies have put together in order to get people to come up to Toronto, go the theatre, maybe a Blue Jays game, restaurants and then they fill up their cars, and finally head back home to start spreading SARS around in their own neighbourhood. Great promotion!!"

530391,Guest,2003-05-04 17:16:00,0,"Canadian beer is not stronger than U.S. beer. Canada figures the alcohol content by volume (as does most of the world). The U.S. figures the alcohol content by weight. Since the specific gravity of alcohol is 0.792 (lighter than water), the approximate strength of a U.S. beer at 4.0% (by weight) is 5.0% (by volume). Go to www.realbeer.com; they have a listing of about a hundred beers and their alcohol content by volume. Most U.S. beers are as strong or stronger than Canadian beers."
530392,Soolkyut,2003-05-05 10:32:00,60,They may not be stronger but they sure are better
530396,Guest,2003-05-05 11:57:00,0,How much can I expect to pay for a 750ML bottle of Jack Daniel's in Canada?? (Or is it the law I MUST drink Canadian Whiskey??)
530397,retire55,2003-05-05 12:58:00,1029,"MarkG:The web site address for the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) is:http://www.lcbo.com/stores_products/index.htmlYou can do a product search for Jack Daniel's and you'll get a list of what Jack Daniel's products are available in Canada and their price. By the way, a 750 ml bottle of JACK DANIEL'S SOUR MASH is $25.95 Cdn"
530393,retire55,2003-05-05 13:19:00,1029,"Fishhead50:Actually, my comment was of the ""tongue in cheek"" type. Regardless, your statement about the alcohol content of US and Cdn beer being the same is completely correct."
530402,Guest,2003-05-07 05:50:00,0,"The price of regular unleaded in Sudbury, Ontario as of yesterday was $1.77US/ US gallon. Also known as 66.3 cents CDN/liter."
530401,bigfish1965,2003-05-07 07:20:00,3210,Just be glad it didn't happen there. Todays price in Southern Ontario was 61.5 c/l.... equivalent to US$1.67/US Gal.based on todays exchange rate of 40%
530383,Guest,2003-05-02 07:06:00,0,Does anyone know what the cost of gasoline is in Canada?
530384,Guest,2003-05-02 07:35:00,0,"Since there's only one gas station for the whole country, we pay whatever they charge us....kidding. You'll have to be way more specific. It's like asking whats the price in the U.S."
530386,Mike M (Sask),2003-05-02 07:47:00,374,Here is a link to a site called gas watch. It has current prices for almost anywhere in Canada or USA.http://www.gaswatch.org/
530385,McQ,2003-05-02 07:48:00,615,On average expect to pay about the equivalent of $1.75 US.

530389,retire55,2003-05-02 09:19:00,1029,You should buy your gas in Canada - like our beer - it's stronger than yours!
530390,Guest,2003-05-02 09:38:00,0,The only thing different about gas in Canada and The USA is the price. Canadian Taxes I just love them.
530394,Trophymuskie,2003-05-02 17:52:00,254,"It doesn't matter what anyone tells you it can be 60 cents a litre one day and 70 cents a litre the next, thats like an over 15% swing ether way in under a week.BTW there are 3.78 liters to a US galon.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"
