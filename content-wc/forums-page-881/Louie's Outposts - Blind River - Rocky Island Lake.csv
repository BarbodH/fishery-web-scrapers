Long arduous drive from Illinois.Had to take the car down 5 or 6 miles of the worst ""Moose path"" God ever created.Scratched the heck out of the paint,almost blew the springs.Parked the car and (only then) were informed by our host,that the lake had been drained. Seems that the nice folks at Louies just forgot to tell us. ""Oh well"" the guy says....""you guys can fish this pool"". ""If you want to get on to the next one, you'll have to walk"". Certainly can't portage the steel boats he has. To top off the trip, this idiot forgot to pick us up when he promised and we all had to walk out with our gear. Most of the lake was composed of dried stumps sticking out of cracked mud. That was my last trip to Canada."

Its a great place for hunting if you can get a tag and compaired to many other logging roads its not as bad as you make it out to be unless your only used to driving on a paved highway. I used to take my 28' trailer down when fishing or hunting. I can't see how you can walk out of that lake from where the cabin is, if you did then you sure walked a heck of a long ways.Someone needs to be held accountable and sued over hydro draining that lake, it sure held some good walleye and pike fishing till they de-regulated Ontario Hydro and messed it up."
530377,Guest,2003-05-04 19:13:00,0,Yeah....we walked around the first pool that we were lodged on and then had to walk past all the dry bed stumps. I think the guy who drained that lake and Louie's for not telling us in advance are BOTH guilty. I sent them a letter and called asking for a refund....you can guess the answer I got...NONE!

It was a North American Corporation that owns the hydro Dam (and many others in Canada and Usa)The company is Brascan , do a google search, the devastating effect of this corporate greed to supply electricty while rates were high due to "" the airconditioner"" season last year was the motive.The victims of the greed were the fish, the environment the lodge owners and the tourists."
