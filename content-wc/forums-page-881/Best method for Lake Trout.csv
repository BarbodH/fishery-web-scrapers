530707,retire55,2003-05-07 12:46:00,1029,"Silver Minnow:Depends on when and where you are fishing.I would think that one of easiest methods for lake trout soon after ice out is trolling or casting the top 10 feet.If your timeframe is summer months, you'll need to establish where (depth) the active trout are. If you have electronics, then look for telltale bait balls (ciscoes/alewifes) and use some means to fish around the bait balls (longlining, downrigging, jigging).Specifying where and when will allow the experts to better respond to your question."

I run my line thru the vent so the hook is in the mouth and weight it w/ a dipsey sinker. I've also hooked some very big pike this way."

YUM tube jigs were working the best. Out twice last week and I would say that 90% of the trout landed were only hooked on the stinger. 30-60 feet was productive.Further up north I would be trolling the traditional 5 of Diamonds (Yellow/Red or Yellow/Black) about 150 feet back.Summer - I would be looking for the 75-100 foot range and would be jigging with chrome airplane jigs tipped with minnows on all the hooks. Something special about chrome airplane jigs (note they are hard to find).Fall - (see Spring techniques)"
