He told me he was having problems with his Eagle fishfinder, that it was reading ten feet, then a thousand feet, then zero, and constantly flashing. I asked if he was maybe fishing a lot of shallow water with dense weeds right up to the surface, to which he replied that he wasn't. I asked if his transducer had been bumped (up) or maybe had even been mounted too high. He replied that it was pointed down, as per usual, and didn't know what the problem could be. He thought it was reading fish, though. Perplexed, I showed him my boat and the transducer. He had the most puzzled look on his face then asked if the way mine was mounted was how a transducer was supposed to be mounted. I replied it was. He then told me he had his pointed down, STRAIGHT DOWN. Obviously it was reading forward, underneath the bottom of the boat, out past the bow and beyond! He was a bit embarrassed but I tried to make him feel better by telling him he was seeing the fish in front of his boat before he even passed over them. Well, ok, I was teasing him. I just wonder for how long - how many YEARS - he had been fishing that way.Any other funny stories like this? One last story is about the time I was fishing with a few distinguished persons (a judge and a few lawyers.) Well, distinguished PERSON I should say!!!! I asked if they'd ever fished before and they replied of course they had, like it was a silly question. I handed each of them some of my spare spinning combos, which I have set up for left-handed reeling. They looked at the spinning reels a bit puzzled, the handle being on the wrong side. Before I could tell them that they could undo the handles and set the spinning reels up for right-handed reeling, each of them turned the rods upside down so the spinning reel was now on top, like a spincast setup. After attempting to cast out, they each dropped their lures to the bottom and reeled in by turning the handles backwards with their right hands. I didn't say anything, just let them conquer nature..."
