530539,Guest,2003-05-07 06:11:00,0,"Walleye1........Although I never do much crank trolling for eyes on Big Sand in June, every year I'm up there in the later part of June, 1st of July and there are always people doing it and catching walleye. I always see the cisco breaking water that time of the year up on Big Sand as well. However, I have always caught walleye casting cranks for bass up on Big Sand in June.........31 incher last year.I'm from Greenwood Indiana........not the same Aaron, never worked at any lodge up there. We have a place out on Harbour Island."
530529,Guest,2003-05-05 06:40:00,0,"Was just up there for a couple of days, ice is out in Minaki and South, Little Sand and as of yesterday morning about 75% of Big Sand.....with the exception of the Northern most part of the lake, a Southerly wind pushed a lot of ice to the very most northern part of the lake.Also, no one will probably believe this but I caught a Lake trout between the point at Harbour Island and Sugarloaf. I had two eye witnesses to confirm it was in fact a lake trout."
530530,Reels,2003-05-05 14:33:00,2876,You know I always wondered how there can not be lake trout there by big sand with the water so deep. How are the water levels?<{{}}><
530531,Guest,2003-05-05 14:50:00,0,"Reels,With LOTW flowing into and through that system and not to mention Vermillion flowing into Big Sand, I'd suspect that I didn't catch the only laker up there. Although in my 24 years on that system I've never caught one.....never been up there this early either.The water levels are lower than I've seen them in several years......not too low though. It's hard to believe that with the levels as high as they were last year that they could get as low as they are now."
530532,iamwalleye1,2003-05-05 19:16:00,1589,Thanks for the report!I was there last year in august for 2 weeks when they started dropping the water. Now with no snow and rain it is low again?The week before I go this year it will rain 5 inches and screw it up again! lol
530533,BillyBigFish,2003-05-06 05:50:00,31,It sounds likle you know the system well. I have been going up there for 9 years. Last year I went somewhere else because the numbers of bigg fish were going down. Any predictions for June 16th - 20th. I am trying it again this year. Hoping for good numbers and some of those bigger fish.
530534,Guest,2003-05-06 07:14:00,0,"Billy.......barring any major changes in water levels you might behitting it just right this year. If your looking for bigger fish I'd hit the crank bite up in Big Sand that time of year. I'm going back up on the 26th of June. To be honest with you, I'm not much of a Walleye fisherman.....mostly Musky and smallmouth but I will tell you I've caught some of the biggest walleye that I ever have up there in the last couple of years while casting for bass."
530535,Jim,2003-05-06 08:37:00,238,"Aaron:We have always gone up to Minaki to fish walleyes, but I think it would be fun to spend some time fishing for smallies. We will be there from June 21-28 this year and would appreciate any advice you would be willing to share on location or presentation to catch them.Most of the guys in are group only like to fish walleyes, but two of us have sons along and we would like to give smallhmouth a try.Regards, Jim"
530536,Guest,2003-05-06 10:19:00,0,"Jim......did I say there there smallies on Big Sand? Ooops, I takethat back, never caught one up there :)Shoot me an email: [email protected]"
530537,Guest,2003-05-06 12:06:00,0,"""there were"""
530538,iamwalleye1,2003-05-06 18:03:00,1589,"I am planning only one trip to Minaki this year because of the last few years of fishing .This year I am hitting LOW in july then minaki in august!The crank bite in August is a blast.
