It will be mainly a walleye/smallie campaign. Any thoughts on the camp or the fishing area that any one of you have experienced that you would care to share? Tips, locations, presentations, depths, etc...Thanks to everyone for any help!"

530327,Ia Walihntr,2003-05-05 18:24:00,320,"Mike,What spiecies are you targeting? Have been at Spruce Island Camp for the Ontario walleye opener ever year since 1989. Your trip will be about 3 weeks later than ours and with the ice already out, the water will be warming rather rapidly, considering the current weather with warm temps. Last year Harv and Jana didnt' get out to the camp till just a few days before the opener. The ice was all out from Algle Inlet to the peninsula, but Big Traverse Bay still had impassible ice between Morson Marina and Sprue Island. This year everything should be about 2 to 3 weeks ahead of last year. Last year, air temps only got out of the thirtys for highs a couple of times, the last couple of weeks before the opener! Post what spiecies you plan to target and I'll do what I can to help.In the mean time, here are two websites you may interested in: www.yahooey.com ---the Flag Island webcam with views for LOTW in Oak Island area, and www.spruceislandcamp.comMarv G."
530328,Mike G,2003-05-07 08:53:00,12,"Marv G,Thanks forthe reply. We will be targeting the smallies and walleyes. Like I mentioned, we have never fished the TUG channel area or any of that immediate area whatsoever. We are real familair with the Monument bay and surrounding areas.Thanks alot Marv."
530329,Ia Walihntr,2003-05-07 16:01:00,320,"Mike,First things first. A good map of the area is essential for first timers to the area unless you plan to hire a guide. Would recomend a Fishing Hot Spots map #Q271. That will be the area north of Spruce Island. (Q273 is south) Both maps have Spruce Island on them. Your trip will be late enough for walleyes to be migrating to deeper water--mid lake humps and reefs etc. There are quite a few humps and reef within a couple of miles to the west and southwest that should be worked with deep crankbaits, bottom bouncers, and jigs. Best baits will be leeches or crawlers. My personal choice would be plastics.(Twister tails, shad bodies, four inch ringworms. etc)(you have to experiment a little with the plastics. Live bait may or may not be better.) Tug Channel should be great. Deeper water near good structure through the day. Gravel or sand shallows (are some especially good gravel and rocky points---east side of channel---that should be extremely good near dusk and early, early morning. The area between Spruce Island and Treaty Narrows seems to hold walleyes much of the year even though it is much shallower than Tub Channel. Particularly, target Twin Island--Haystack area and Barneys Reef area on the south point (at the west entrance) to Treaty Narrows.Depending on the water temps when you arrive, the smallmouth may be about to spawn, in the midst of spawning, or done spawning. Whichever mode, they should be pretty predictable. Even if they have already spawned, they still should be close to thier spawning beds. Check for bays that have a sandy shallow back ends If you don't have luck, cast the rocky shorelines from the backend to the opening of the bay. I would try a faster presentation, spinner baits, shallow crank baits. If by a stroke of luck they are on the beds, throw some top water baits and hold on to the rod!!!!! If all that fails, they are probably moving out to deeper water reefs, in which case, fish the same way you would for walleyes. If you need more info, e-mail me a [email protected]. Will be happy to help.Marv G."
