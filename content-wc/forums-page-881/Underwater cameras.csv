530750,Guest,2003-05-09 09:48:00,0,I have the same question about the legality of the camera. The water in many of the Canadian lakes is stained similar to the water in LOW and I know my camera didn't work well there. The water was too dark and stained to see any distance.
530751,Guest,2003-05-09 17:08:00,0,I used one a few years ago on the Western Peninsula of LOTW. The water on that side is a little clearer most of the time. I had no problem. The closer I got to Kenora however I was able to see down only 25ft. Which in most cases should be enough. I spent more time watching than trying to catch them. I now have the Atlantis and will be trying that this summer to use for putting videos on various web sites. I do NOT use it to catch fish however. I once guided here and have no problem finding them most of the time.Should be fun. To me I am more interested in looking at what I have been fishing all these years.
