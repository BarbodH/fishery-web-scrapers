The price was right.Looking at the last full week in Sept. Lodging for about ten guys. We bird hunt and do some fishing.We don't need anything fancy.ThanksHouse"

They have a feature called Trip Finder which you put in what you want and he sends it out to the lodges up there. We got just what we were looking for. The web address is http://www.justfishontario.com/trip_finder.htmGood luck."
