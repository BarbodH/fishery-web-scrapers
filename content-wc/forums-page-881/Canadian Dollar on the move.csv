530437,Stillwater,2003-05-04 03:13:00,87,"I have to go along with Trophymuskie here. I go to LOTW every year and would prefer to deal in US money. That way we are both talking about the same $ and I don't have to deal with exchange rates.About 5 years ago a group of us went to Lac Suel and had a remote cabin for 5 days, ($100 per man, per day, PLUS a LOT of gas). My fishing partner brought $1000 US cash to pay his part of the bill, I used my credit card. Upon checkout, he was given the ""current exchange rate"". When I got my credit card bill 2 weeks later, I discovered I had paid $27 less than he had. Plus, he had about $15 in Canadian paper money which you can't use here. Now-days, we pool all canadian cash and buy gas at a last stop gas station and use it up. Always use a credit card if you can, or else deal in US funds. Scott"
530438,Guest,2003-05-04 03:20:00,0,We cross at Fort Frances-International Falls. Before Crossing we stop at the Information Centre and convert our Canadian money to US currency-except for the amount of the toll across the bridge.
530429,Trophymuskie,2003-05-04 06:38:00,254,"Shazam you are full of it. What do you thing we do? sit around and say I need $300 CA a day to survive so I will charge my clients $300 US and make an extra 50%. Your so far off, I see what I need in Canadian funds and then figure out the exchange rate give or take a percent or two and set my rates in US funds to equal what we need in Canadian dollars. I know how much it is a pain in the ##### to exchange currency here in Canada and know it is much harder in the US in areas not close to the border. I would have it much easyer to charge in Canadian funds and not have to deal with the exchange but I do it because I offer a full first class service.FYI I am not a lodge owner so the $140 CA a day I have to pay to lodge a pair of my clients is going to cost me out of my pocket, as I am charging them $90 US wich is now down to $127 CA. Now add that to the $45 CA from my rates and I will lose over $60 CA a day.It is expected that the Canadian dollar will move up and down a couple of cents but a 10 cents swing in a couple of months is not predictable. Good think I am guide for the love of it and not to get rich. LOL But I still have a family to feed.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"

530439,Trophymuskie,2003-05-04 07:08:00,254,"Well this is a reply to the last 3 post up there. First of all we know the exchange rates will fluctuate from day to day and that means it may go up a bit and we make a bit more or go down a bit and we make a bit less but this last gain in the Canadian dollar or should I say drop in the US dollar is a significant 15 to 20 %.Now I see a lot of Americans keep asking where to go to exchange cash, isn't that a pain in the #####? We here in Canada only have to go to any bank and get the best rates available. Naturaly going to your own bank will get you an extra percentage point but they still make a profit on it so we may buy US cash on any given day for $1:50 CA and sell it for $1:46 so thats a 4 cent swing and that is all the time as the bank wants their 2% from every transaction. The credit card companys charge even more so for us it is best to exchange cash at our banks. Now that we are getting less these charges that we pay to help our clients are going to be the same.I wasn't in business that long ago, I know me and many others set our pricing in US funds for only one reason and that is to save our clients from having to go around and look for places to exchange funds and then get an inacurate rate as well and your trip cost you the same amount as what was quoted to you 6 months or one year before.I have a US funds account in a Canadian bank and sometimes I have people (from the states) call me and tell me my check bounced but no that is because their Banks can't figure out how to make the transaction. I had a guy tell me that they would not cash his $30 check unless he paid $8, LOL can you imagine if I had given him a $45 Canadian check. We have it so much easyer to exchange money here in Canada, I can actualy exchange cash right here right now on my computer. With just a few clicks of the mouse I can transfer funds from my US account to a Canadian account or vise versa and get the rate of this minute.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"
530427,Trailerguy,2003-05-04 08:09:00,1407,"Shazam, I was in NWO two weeks ago and gas was 79.9/liter in Dryden. If you don't pay tax on your gas, you must be a clever fellow. Here in NC Iowa the pipeline that brings our gas comes from Oklahoma, not Canada. As far as credit cards go there is a big deal in the papers right now about the ""hidden fees"" that they have been charging for the service of same date exchange rates. Pay me now/pay me later/ just pay me! If you don't mind being bent over, use your card. I have an acount with Royal Bank of Canada and a check book, personally. And yes Kenora and Dryden realestate people, even some down around Fort Francis. I think most people in NWO would lump Southern Ontario right in with Quebec if asked, and the 60% of the oil imported sure doesen't come from there! Last summer when the Loonie was down there were a number of articles in the Winnepeg Free Press and the Vancover paper about adopting USD. But I don't supose you southern folks pay any attention anything west of Thunder Bay?????"
530430,bubbalou,2003-05-04 08:15:00,29,I agree with Shazam completely. The Canadians want to price everything in American dollars so they can throw the screws to the people who support them. Don't give me this BS that it is easier for the Americans. Biggest bunch of crap I have ever heard!!!!!!!!!!!
530440,Guest,2003-05-04 10:07:00,0,"Reading the replies I agree that in Canada, it should be Canadian Funds.I live in Barrie and a couple of years ago I stayed at a lodge on Abram Lake for a week and was told that I had to pay in U.S. Funds because they don't make any money off Canadian.I sent a letter off to the PM Of Ontario & Canada just a couple of weeks ago addressing this same issue. I was given a reply already that they are looking into the situation and will respond shortly.I also might add that as a seperate country from the U.S. we shouldn't even consider American as it de-values the Canadian Dollar.Gas in Barrie Today is 60.5/Per Litre, The post above must be talking about Toronto as I hear on the radio it is going for .49/Per Litre as of friday. Northern Ontario pays alot more for gas then the city due to the amount of gas sales and transportation so there is little fluctuation in price.Outside of Southern Ontario nobody pays any attention to what else happens in the west because nothing ever does happen and they don't stand a chance in Ottawa because they don't have enough seats."
530441,Guest,2003-05-04 10:11:00,0,This makes me even happier now that I paid for my trip in advance! It cost me less in November of 2002 for my Trip in July of 2003!Maybe we should all learn to book early and ask for a discount for paying in advance!
530461,TangledAngler,2003-05-08 07:19:00,65,"First of all, both countries have a free economy. Americans have become accustomed to taking advantage of the Canadian dollar on our trips. Seeing our ""advantage"" disappear probably comes as a shock to some. My personal opinion is that regardless of the exchange rate, Canadian fishing trips are still the best value in town. It's a free market, if you can't handle the expense, don't go. Strengthening of the Canadian dollar (or weaking of the US dollar) isn't that bad for Canadians.As for charging US funds in Canada, who cares? It's money and it can be converted to either dollar. Hopefully, in the end, the net value/expsnes is the same. I really don't think that this exchange rate stuff is going to affect the number of Americans going to Canada anymore than the weakening domestic US economy will affect the trips.I exchange my US money for Canadian $ here in the states and pay for everything in Canadian funds when I'm up there. Just a personal preference.As for Wake Up, anonymous posts like yours are the poster child for censorship. Sounds like sour grapes to me.If I mistyped anything in this post, please don't point it out. That doesn't mean you win an argument. I'm not a professional typist but I know how to spell every word on this thread. My secretary usually handles the typing for me.Richard, do business how you see fit. I'm sure you know how to make adjustments if necessary to keep your business running."
530462,Guest,2003-05-08 09:01:00,0,"Well of course you know how to spell Marty, it was TM's literacy skills I was laughing at. I certainly don't think you win arguments based on spelling, but, the literacy level of the person should be taken into account. For example, if you spell a pretty simple word like PLUMBER, by ""sounding it out"" like in grade school, PLUMMER, missed the silent ""B"" that's just plain funny.Nobody wins arguments on typos or spelling, but sounding it out, thats funny LOLNo doubt this is the same level of brilliance as someone that claims he just happens to prefer getting paid in US dollars for services in Canada, just for the ""convenience"" of the US tourist...certainly not for the fact that's it worth more. Expecting other's to beleive that is pretty hilarious. You'd have to pretty stupid to not see that scam, but, like I said, it's a nickel and dime minor scam, I'm sure alot of US tourists know when they are getting hosed on the exchange rate in Canada. I disagree with the practice. At best, it's misleading.And, I think we can discuss this nickel and dime scam for only so long...I do agree with you on one point though Marty, it's his business and he should do whatever he likes and he'll do whatever he can get away with, and US tourists, well, they are the customer and they can choose who they do business with."
530465,Guest,2003-05-08 09:39:00,0,"Well holy crap, guiding at $20 p/h american for 6 months wont pay the bills. Ok depending on your lifestyle that may be true, but if you know for sure that you only work 6 months what do you do the rest of that time, just sit there and spend the money you just made?? How about finding other work, or do some ice fishing guiding, whatever. TM, you live the life most if not all of us here would love. You work in fishing, yet you still find reasons to complain. I wish I had your life, but I'm just some bum sitting at a dest working 12 months a year and struggling to get by. This whole business and the way you run it is your choice. You decided to take the risk, aperently you only work 6 months. If that risk is too much then find a new job, and stop insulting your country and people in it with this tripe about the canadian dollor going up being bad.I've read lots of crap from you before but this stuff about $20/h american for 6 months isn't enough to survive on, it's just too much. Get a life!!!! or at least stop complaining about your B/S problems.Cheers and good fishing (for 12 months)!!!!!CoolB"
530463,TangledAngler,2003-05-08 09:43:00,65,"Perhaps I'm not fully aware of the extent of the US/Canadian $$ ""scam"". I assumed that the US $ prices and the Canadian prices were different based on the exchange rate fluctuation. If the prices are the same dollar for dollar, I agree that it is a ""scam"". But, I would then say that both the consumer and the vendor are at fault with the consumer having the ultimate ability to fix the problem. Get Canadian funds. If the price is only listed in US $$, then the consumer can decide for themselves if it's worth the price. Supply/Demand runs our economies.As for mocking someone's spelling, that's playground stuff. It distracts from anything intelligent contained in a post."

I dont mean to point out spelling because that is usally a bit low, but it is obvious that Wakeup was trying to sound witty by using words like fascist and rhetoric. Unfortunatly it only came off as immature.And lastly, you called OFN fascist. I would immagine you said this because posts do get deleted there sometimes.

I'm sure the targeted audience is happy with the direction that board has gone.As for this board, Scott and his crew have a great thing. Free Speech is not their goal either.

530476,Guest,2003-05-08 12:25:00,0,"Wake Up, Smell some coffee!!! it might smarten you up a bit.How does a debate about the dollar turn into a trashing of people and web-sites. If you don't like someone then deal with it privately. If you don't like the way someone does business then don't support the business that they run. Going into a public forum and slandering someone for how they operate is not cool. If you were to say the things you have said about TJ and his business about me and my business their would be consequences. People have choices in how they operate a business, and part of that is determining how much the product or service is worth and how to charge for it. I wouldn't go on a guided trip or go to a lodge if I had to pay in US dollars. My choice.If ya don't like OFN then don't go...you might not be wanted there anyways.

The sports fan in me askes what juggernaut sports teams are housed in your fair city? I sure hope you're not talking about the Leafs. Or maybe the Argos? the Jays? As for throwing stones, I challenge you to point it out to me where I'm the worst offender anywhere. One time did I cross the line and admitted it and was willing to deal with the consequeces. C'mon, back up your pathetic rhetoric. If you really were a regular as you claim, that shouldn't be hard.There are as many new registered users on OFN as ever. Change your name to Sour Grapes. You hide behind the net, have personal issues with OFN and that name would aptly describe you. Have some integrity, tell us who you are. . . or email me.

It's just like if a store cemented up thier front door and moved it to the back, obviously they would lose a bit of business until everyone realized where the door is.

More then that is I don't swear, I dont insult people, I dont act childish. Really tho, where is this comming from that I am the worst one, that's garbage. Personally I dont care if anyone else here believes me because I know the ones who actually know me, know that your comments arn't true. OFN changed because of flamers, the zoo board made a discussions and grumblings board because of flamers, and if what I read is right, this board made another strickly fishing boared, probably because of flamers. Obviously there is a problem. We have children that read these boards. Is ""free speach"" when it is 90% flaming and 10% legit enough to warrent our children reading and absorbing tripe like this.

I stand behind my statement..give the US customers prices in US dollars and the Canooks prices in pretty Canadian dollars. Why is that such a rip-off? When you buy things such as airline tickets ahead of time, and the price of fuel drops dramatically, you don't scream about the difference it costs the airline to fly you. It goes up, it goes down...that's the risk the business takes."

If you pay $500 USD for a trip on which you caught two fish from a crappy canoe in a rundown lodge but were happy and will come back then you got value. If you pay $5,000 CND for a gorgeous resort with top of the line everything and caught 100 trophies a day but hated it then you didn't get value. What I mean is it is less about the currency or cost and more about the memories and enjoyment factor.Musky Striker is a businessman!!"

Fishing is, last time I checked, sittin in a boat with a rod...And, if anyone, not just fishing or hunting lodges or guides, but any other trade, enagaged in US dollar at par billing the way the fishing and hunting operators in Ontario do, I'd call that a rip off as well.

Usually convenience has a price attached to it...sorry, don't believe that it should be waived merely because you happen to be from the U.S. Trophymuskie, you're truly top shelf in my book...you've more restraint for the Bubba mentality than I can muster, and I live under the same flag as they do. Regardless of what the exchange rate is on any given year, I'll continue to visit and enjoy the hospitality I've always been shown.WillieB"

Even while travelling to Jamaica last year, all prices everywhere were quoted in US dollars. You could pay in Jamaican dollars, but they kinda looked at you funny. Rich can grab the American market if he chooses to follow that venue. If you truly believe guiding is 'sitting in a boat', how about a little challenge? I'll go on the Ottawa with Rich, you go alone. Guides don't have certificates or diplomas. They have time on the water and an extensive understanding of their quarry. If people felt it was without value, he would have to pack it in and try something else, wouldn't he?"

What a buffoon. Your rhetoric is tiresome Bigfish so why don't you and all your Ontario Fishing Net Girls run along and play with T.J. and his facsist regime who do nothing but censor. That board sucks because of the likes of you so get lost."

It is plainly obvious that the guy is a rip-off artist, and if I'm ever up in the Ottawa area, I'll make sure NOT to look him up. ""Americans like it that way"", he says...HA HA HA! Maybe the stupid ones that fall for his nonsensical ramblings do, but not I!! And one other thing...he claims he's losing money...yeah right, another lie...the guy would pull in a profit if the CAN dollar was worth 90 cents US at the prices he charges. I'll say it again...FULL OF BALONEY!!!"

I did say I was going to lose 15 to 20 % of my overall gross income but I am a service oriented business and my cost are somewhat low (maybe 33%). So yes I am going to make a profit just 15 to 20 % less then I should if the Canadian dollar was at $.63 US. I have invested in a $30K CA boat and have some $20K CA in equipment to service my clients, I offer a first class full service where my clients have the best of everything including that most of them catch the biggest muskie of their life and all I make is around $20 US ( that equaled $31.20 CA last year and $27.80 CA right now ) per hour and I am a rip off artist?FYI I need to keep my other business going as guiding at $20 US an hour for 6 months of the year won't pay my bills.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"
530444,GLO,2003-05-05 20:10:00,318,"Another typical bunch of bashing garbage without letting the facts get in the way. My trip this summer was quoted in US dollars, and if it so happens the Canadian dollar gains, then I benefit, great for me. On the other hand, having willingly agreed to paying US dollars when I booked the trip, what the heck difference does it make if they had charged me Canadian funds, instead, and the Canadian dollar had gone the other way? Last I knew you could check exchange rates virtually anywhere so figure out what you are willing to pay and if it's too much, don't buy the service. It's called international trade and currency fluctuations are always part of the equation."

530446,Guest,2003-05-06 14:02:00,0,"I'm Canadian and I got wind of this thread from bigfish1965, thanks. My 2 cents: Canadian companies charging US dollars is pretty much the most flagrant scam out there. Unfortunately, it's most common in the fishing/hunting/lodge industry.Saying that you charge in USD for the convenience is a laugher, most Americans know they should change their money when entering another country, just like Canadians travelling abroad know to do the same thing. Charging USD in Canada results in the price appearing lower and being worth more locally.I guess for convenience sake, the guys charging USD should pay their Canadian expenses in USD they collect, who cares if it costs more, it's the convenience right LOL. My guess is the USD get converted to more Canadian dollars and the bills get paid with that. I could be wrong, but I doubt it LOLFurthermore, in large urban centers, like Ottawa, there is really no need to charge USD for ""convenience"" because, invariably, the US tourist will be paying Canadian dollars for most other goods and services, like hotels, meals etc.The other scam to look out for from a US tourist in Canada perspective is the exchange rate, change your US money in a major bank, check the rate before you exchange it, most retailers rip off USD to the tune of 20-30%. It's your money, don't be fooled."
530447,Trophymuskie,2003-05-06 16:43:00,254,"Kirk you are correct about retailers paying out under the going rate, everyone has to make a buck. But I would like you to tell me what a client in Ohio or even worse Virginia can do to send me a deposit in Canadian dollars? As well when they show up Friday night after the bank is closed (I am not in Ottawa and my clients are lodged in a town of 10,000 people or another with few hundread), where are they going to exchange their US dollars to pay me for their lodging and guiding? I think they don't mind losing a bit on the exchange when buying gas, beer and other minor expenses but they love having the major expenses of lodging and guiding taken care of in their currency.BTW I do not set my rates in US funds only, but if you look at my site the Canadian prices are the same as when the Canuck loonie was at 63 cents. There is no way that I can update my webpages every other day. But if I am asked I will lower my prices to match ether currency as it is only fair to charge the same to all.Thanks Bigfish for the compliments, but those anons are good at a desapering act once confronted.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"

530448,Guest,2003-05-07 11:47:00,0,"We can debate this forever, I think people got a pretty good idea about what the US rate is all about...LOL Frankly, the difference in the Canadian dollar going up from 63 to 70 cents US is that the ripoff of the US tourist is 7 cents less, it's still a ripoff, just less of an amount, and it would be pretty cheesy to raise your rates to maintain the initial ripoff rate.Speaking of disappearing acts, where'd Bigfish go????"
530449,Trophymuskie,2003-05-07 12:17:00,254,"So you think $20 US per hour is a ripoff rate? You better never want or need a lawyer.

530450,McQ,2003-05-07 12:27:00,615,"Let me try to contribute .02 here. It seems the only guy who wants to challenge a persons right to do business is the fellow who just maybe doesn't have the head for it.A business person regardless what shingle they hang up is free to charge whatever they feel is right for their services. It is up to the customer to figure out whether the rate is fair or not. as alluded to in the previous post, professionals charge for their services and ability to deliver the goods - that's why legal fees can vary from the hundreds of dollars per hour to thousands. You get the service that you pay for and it's usually based on experience and success in delivering the goods.It really shouldn't matter what a persons fees are - the consumer will determine whether they are worth it or not. A guides right to charge an amount of money commenserate with his ability to deliver a happy customer is his right to choose - not yours to bash into embarassment."
530428,River_eye,2003-05-04 10:24:00,1486,"You guys are both right to some extent. US citizens paying in their own currency is pure convenience for them, If the bill will be $800, that's what you'll pay, no fluctuations from when you book to when you pay the bill. If they charged in Canadian cash, they would just take the US figure and times it by the exchange rate, if your lucky the Canadian dollar would fall and you'd end up paying less, but this year, you'd be paying more than you planned. I believe that it's very unfavourable from a budget point of view to have a balance owing fluctuating like that.But..... charging in American dollars and then having a seperate rate in Canadian dollars for Canadian citizens is also done. Meaning, Canadians will pay less for the same services their Americans receive. Not saying this is done everywhere, but I know of a few. The reason for this, is that fishing trips just aren't worth as much to Canadians as they are to Americans. We have great fishing in our backyards already, so we're not as willing to shell out the dough for an american plan resort. In this way, it's kind of crooked, but not really. Also, if Americans were charged in Canadian dollars, although it's the same, it may seem like more psychologically. Kind of like the reason every price ends in 99. It's probably best that Americans don't realize how much their dollar is worth up here."
530420,Guest,2003-05-03 09:55:00,0,Hey guys.Just thought I'd let you all know (especially the ones that have planned a trip to Canada) that the Canadian dollar has gone over the $0.70 mark for the first time in over 5 years. Experts predict that the CAN dollar will reach $0.75US by the end of the of the summer...thus the exchange rates won't be at the bargain basement levels that we have seen over the past couple of years when the CAN dollar was hovering around $0.62US. Will this sway anybody's desicion on whether to go north this year or not??
530421,Trailerguy,2003-05-03 13:54:00,1407,"Ya, the excange rate is right up on the list. Just below what kind of beer to buy with those dirty old USA dollars."
530422,Vitreum,2003-05-03 15:56:00,221,no way. i'm going fishing.
530423,Trophymuskie,2003-05-03 16:28:00,254,Most of us outfiters charge in US funds for our services mainly to make it easyer on our American clients. It is done so that when our clients book with us in the winter the price will be the same when they come up in the summer. These differences cannot be predicted and happening at a time where our pricing is set for the year wich means we will have to eat the 15-20% ( we are getting $1.41 right now vs $1.56 last year so thats already a 15 cents drop ). Look for some decent price increases for 2004 as I don't know of many who can live with such a drop in their income. This is really going to hurt guys like me that are offering lodging services that I get from others so not only I have to eat the lost on my services but the ones on the lodging as well. So much for that 5% price increase I had to set this year to cover the gas prices.Oh well the American economy will bounce back real soon and send our cannuck dollar back bellow 65 I hope LOL.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com
530424,Guest,2003-05-03 17:38:00,0,"Trophymuskie , I have to say your full of it. You charge American $$ because you make more money this way so don't feed us the line that your making it easier for the client, heck the client would be more than happy to pay the same rate in Canadian Dollars...LOLYou make a living catering to Yankee's, I don't and I am glad the buck is on the rise.As I have said before, I think it should be illegal to charge American Dollars in Canada as this is not Canadian Currency and those who keep pushing the American rates made to pay the difference.I believe Americans would gladly pay in Canadian Funds to save a crap load of cash and conversion fees that you lodge owners charge not to mention the cost of your live bait, but thats another story."
530425,Trailerguy,2003-05-03 18:19:00,1407,"Shazam, You are pretty naive, if they weren't charging USD they would simply be charging more CND for their services. You know that lodging is a business? Just like the Motel in your town? Yes,I beleive the rates in USD are for the customers convience. It would suck to have to go to town and exhange money to pay the bill and then go back at the end of the week to change the remaining cash back again. You realize most the realestate people quote in USD as well? And of course there is always talk when the CND is weak of scrapping the Loonie and going with the USD. IMHO a strong CND is good, I'm happy for you, but I like to buy gas in the USA. We're at $1.29 a gallon right now, how's your .80 a liter figure against that? The exhange rate doesen't help much does it?"
530431,Guest,2003-05-03 18:28:00,0,I'll still be going if it's dollar for dollar.My usual local source for obtaining Canadian currency no longer handles it. I'll be going through Sault Ste Marie on July 4. Does anyone know specifically where the best location is for exchanging US$ is in the Canadian Soo?
530426,Guest,2003-05-03 18:35:00,0,"Trailerguy, .80 per liter?Were paying 49.9 right now in southern Ontario...... where do you get your info from? Anything above that is taxes, it has nothing to do with foreign policy or your dollar as the gas we use here in Ontario comes from Canada to begin with. Did you know Canada supplies 60% of the U.S. Gas? Yeah, thats right, we supply you with more gas than the middle east.As far as paying the bill thats what credit cards are good for.. Any currency is good so use them. What do you think I have to do when I visit the U.S ? You folks take Canadian Cash? Noway, you don't want anything to do with it or anything else for that matter so suck it up, join the party and if you want to pay cash deal with it as a way of life like the rest of the world.As for your so called realestate people mostly quoting in U.S. is a pipe dream. Maybe in Kenora but not the rest of the Provence.A weak Canadian buck talking about changing to the US Dollar? Where did you get that info from?"
530435,Pooch,2003-05-03 20:14:00,4619,"I'm getting old but not completely senile (yet). Years ago when we started going to Canada most everyone charged in Canadian dollars. Then as the US dollar grew stronger and stronger camps started to charge in US dollars. I always thought they were doing it to protect themselves against the falling Canadian dollar. Now it has slipped the other way and nipping them in the butt a little. Anyone in business that deals across borders has this risk to contend with. Whether most folks realize it or not everytime the dollar fluctuates relative to another currency it effects what we pay and recieve for services or mechandise. This one just happens to be in our ""sand box"" so it is more apparent.I hope that makes sense because it is past my bedtime....Pooch"
530436,Guest,2003-05-03 23:39:00,0,"I remember when I was a kid the canadians dollor was worth a dime more than the US dollor and they wanted that dime, they would not forget about it- the dime that is. Then when the dollor was worth more they tried to treat the transaction money as even unless you made it a point to get the exchange rate. It should be the law that in canada the prices are quoted in canadian funds. Most resorts are owned by americans and this way they can overcharge for their resort without raising a red heiring. The sucker oh I mean customer is so used to dealing in dollors that they forget HEY this is canada why are we paying so much!I could go on but you get the point. If its not enough income for some people do like the rest of us do, get a SECOMD job! credit cards are the way to go. No hasle and the card companys figure the exchange rate the best. There are more exchange rates than carter has pills."
