The big thing she told me was Ontario has a BAN on open burning anywhere within a 100 miles of Thunder Bay, Ontario. She said to PRAY for rain."

For there to be dry wood, it can't have rained for some time. If it doesn't rain for a time, it's dry and the ban is on. BUT HEY, if it raining, raining, raining, go have yourself a FIRE, no problem. Where do I find dry wood in a wet, soaked forest?I don't get it...never have, never will.Another May Long with no fires goes down in history..."
