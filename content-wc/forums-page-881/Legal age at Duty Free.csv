530714,Mr Twister 1,2003-05-07 17:30:00,5,It seems that I read that the legal age to buy alcohol at the Duty Free Store in Sault Ste. Marie is 21 even though the legal drinking age in Ontario is 19. Seems possible because they may have to honor the more restrictive law (21 to drink in Michigan)even though you cannot return to the States after stopping at Duty Free. Or could this just be at the Duty Free as you return to the States? Or could this just be a figment of my overworked imagination??!! :) Thanks for any input!

This is only a theory and I'm not sure if I'm even close to being in the right ballpark...best advice is to call duty free and ask."
