530523,Guest,2003-05-07 10:21:00,0,That's interesting. He guided us 2 years ago when we were up at Sportsman's lodge. We had a lot of fun. It's too bad he won't be there. I was hoping to have him guide us in the 1st couple of days.Adam
530513,duffy,2003-05-04 17:23:00,49,I just spoke with a friend in red lake and he said it's open. good luck to all on your trips this year and lets us know how you did!!!!!!!!! I leave for way north on June 6th to the 13th. Can't wait till then.Duffy
530514,Guest,2003-05-04 18:13:00,0,Howey Bay still has a little ice and I think the main lake still has some ice but all should be gone by the end of the week.
530515,Guest,2003-05-05 05:30:00,0,Bud: Do you live in Red Lake during the winter? Not at Five Lakes? Does Gull rock still have ice?
530516,Guest,2003-05-05 06:16:00,0,John how's it going the ice is gone on Gullrock about 4 days now the mnr put the logs back in the dam the lake is about normal.We do live in town during the winter we got a house on the south side of Howey Bay. I have not seen Mike yet I talked to him they both had colds so they were laying low for a couple days probably see him this week.Have a safe trip when you head up this way.
530517,Guest,2003-05-06 12:11:00,0,Have you guys heard anything specifically about Little Vermillion Lake. I head up May 16th. I'm sure the ice went out about the same as Red and the others in that area. Less than 2 weeks!!!Adam
530518,Guest,2003-05-06 14:13:00,0,"duffy have u been to way north before?? if so how are the accomidations, food ,service ect...is the fishihg as good as they claim?? any tips thanks for the help...."
530519,duffy,2003-05-06 14:31:00,49,"aprowl,My opinion is somewhat biased as I do most of the bookings for them. However, I have been going there for 9 years as a customer and i think the fishing is awesome for trophy pike and walleyes with lots of lake trout. Perhaps someone else like Lobo can comment to give you another opinion. When are you going?"
530520,lobo1,2003-05-06 16:15:00,734,"I've been 2X in the early spring (last of May/early June) and it's the worst fishing and camp I've ever been to. This time of year there are no bugs so you won't be able to enjoy them or any of those fine repellants. There is ice still on the shady shores to stock your coolers - THAT SUCKS TOO !The big lady pikies are still in the shallows and they are extremely hungry - terrible, just terrible. Once you see a few of these big girls you won't want to swim anymore - so there goes that too.The walleyes are a nuisance as you cant keep the basturds off your hooks and you have to pinch the barbs (recking a great lure!).When you hook into one of those big girls they tend to pull your boat and you end up spilling your beer - OUCH ! The dang fish bite on anything so there really is no down time to enjoy the peace and quiet; came home exhausted both times I went.At the camp itself there's always a few knuckleheads fussing over your gear and trying to clean stuff up/gas your boats - what a hassle.I'm staying home this year where it's safe and I can enjoy myself.All the bad things aside - it ain't too bad of a place to go to if you have to get out of the house and you can handle it.lobo1"
530521,Guest,2003-05-07 06:36:00,0,"Hey Duffy,Is there anything you want me to tell Kevin Geary when I see him in 1 1/2 weeks at Sportsman's Lodge. He's our guide on one of the first couple of days I hope. By the way, he had a new baby last summer.Adam"
530522,Guest,2003-05-07 08:51:00,0,Adam.i spoke to kevin three days ago. He will not be a sportsmans at all this year and I really don't know why. Something is going on but I did not want to seem nosy about it. He won't be guiding or anything. If you want his home number e-mail me and i will send it to you. Good luck at sportsmans and let me know how you did. [email protected]Duffy
