I would like to know. surely there are some folks that had to make that decision. just wondering. Thanks"

545338,Guest,2005-01-24 06:57:00,0,"Well, if you (the driver) knew that the guy had a DUI and that he had a chance to get caught, then I'd guess you'd probably have a backup plan....ie, hotel, drive home, have someone pick him up...etc. If you didn't know he had a DUI and this suddenly became a burden on YOUR trip - dump his @ss near the potato dumpster...he can catch the bus home."
545340,Guest,2005-01-24 07:18:00,0,"If he could not get over, and he put us under the cabin minimum, he would pay us the money he owed us, or I would keep all of his clothes/tackle food and everything else. There are buses that he could catch from Internation Falls to the Chicago area. I'm going fishing!!!!!!! I had a friend that went on a Fly-in a few years back, and one of the guys could not get over in Winnepeg because of a DUI when he was 18. The year before they let him in, but told him he had to do something before he was allowed in Canada again. I guess you can apply for something with Canadian Customs, and of course pay a fee, and they will forgive the DUI on your record if it was five years or more. He figured the odds that they would get their ID's checked two years in a row were low, so he did not pay the fee. He had to stay in a lock-up over night, and take a plane home. Because he was not there, he made their party an odd number, and they had to pay extra. The guy would not pay and they do not talk to this day."
545344,Guest,2005-01-24 09:58:00,0,"Well I would certainly never dump anyones #### at the border. Friend, family or anyone. the reason we go on these trips is for the fun of being together so if we cannot be together then i guesss I do not want to be on the trip. I can catch fish anywhere, but we usually pick a decent destination for our yearly trips. Nevertheless we will start checking into that Canadian fee for forgiveness. Thanks Eh."
545345,Guest,2005-01-24 10:07:00,0,"I agree with you 100% - however, a good friend/family member wouldn't put you in that scenario - they'd stay behind, or pay the fee to cross...."
545351,Guest,2005-01-24 16:12:00,0,"Correction on my earlier post. The guy that got locked up had a felony (Theft when he was 18) on his record as well as a DUI. He could have paid a fee for the DUI, but there is something else you have to do for a Felony. I think that since the Felony was 10 years or more he could have gotten into Canada but there was something else he had to do. PS. If you drive over the border, you do not get ID'ed very often. My friends fly to Winnepeg, and they check everyone on the plane when you fly."
