545143,Guest,2005-01-17 06:28:00,0,INeric Glad somebody is talking about other lakes than Lac Suel? Is this the first time going to Wine? As for fishing Wine in Aug or Sept I haven't but I do fish it in June. I will give you some insight of the fishing in Aug and Sept from the yearly newsletter the owners sent out this year. They wrote the walleye season didn't peak until July this year. I can see this because we didn't have the success in June like we normally do. They also stated the lake turned over earlier than usually and it was tough fishing in August and early sept. So it sounds like later in Sept the fishing was good. The lake was really high this spring this might have something to do with this. By the look of the trophy list roughly half of the trophy pike were caught during this time. But very few trophy walleye and lake trout. Any other questions about Wine please reply. Shoe89

545156,Guest,2005-01-17 14:40:00,0,"Fishoil Wine lake is a boat in camp near Perrault Falls. You boat across Wabaskang Lake 30 minutes and then into a river system at the north end of Wabaskang. Then about 30 minutes on the river system you hit Wine Lake. If you are looking for a remote and rustic camp this is the place. It takes you back to old times with no electricity and an old fashioned ice house. While there you can fish up to 8 different lakes and the river system. It has walleye, pike, trout, smallmouth, and perch. The good thing is that it is the only resort in the area and usually about 30-45 fisherman in camp so it isn't fished heavily. Every once in a while you will see a group from Wabaskang but not very often. It is like your very own private lake system for a week. Take a look at the website www.winelakecamp.com. It truly is the real Canadian experience. Shoe89"
545157,Guest,2005-01-17 15:25:00,0,"30-45 fishermen? Sounds like a crowd. A true Canadian experience means complete solitude in my books, and that means a fly in trip. You have an entire lake to yourselves alone. No disrespect, just my opinion."
545193,AB,2005-01-18 21:05:00,61,I've been there. Depending on the weather the bite can be good or bad. Usually fishing slows in Aug. and heats back up late in Sept. Hot weather turns em' off. Fish move out of flats to suspend at ledges and humps near deeper water. Sometimes you have to work to find them feeding in early morning or late evening chasing the bait fish back into the weedlines. Quality not quantity that time of year is the norm.
