They have changed the location this year to a smaller venue, and I think the atmosphere was far better. It seemed more comfortable and friendly in a smaller room. No parking fee this year, and with a $2.00 off coupon the price was similar to last year. Beer was $2.00 a cup cheaper than previous years, and the merchandise they sell was also less expensive. Whoever puts these shows together will hopefully keep the Madison show at this new site."

The no parking fee was appreciated, and the folks there were friendly. We liked it better than last year at the convention center. We did fail to drop sufficient "" bread crumbs"" to return by the same route, but managed to get back to hwy 151 eventually. Hope the show is back at the hotel next year. Now to hit a few more boat/fishing shows to displace the cabin fever that is setting in."

This sounded like the trip for me and booked a week in July. Really great people that run it and looking forward to my trip.
