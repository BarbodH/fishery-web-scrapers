I was VERY WRONG and tried to relay that with my earlier post. The treatment our family received at Coppens Resort in Canada was far better than how we were treated at Sha-Sha Resort and the downright awful service that occurred during a 4 day fall trip in 2002 at Rainy Lake Lodge(no longer in business). I'm sure that others far more knowledgeable than I am about Rainy would differ with my opinion however, after more than 40 years of fishing (including tournaments) I think I know which of the 2 choices I would make if planning a trip and Coppens/Canadian side of Rainy would win hands down. Good luck on your decision and leave a few for me, I plan to be back !!"
545239,Bx2(IL),2005-01-20 12:37:00,62,Mickey: My comment was made tongue in cheek. I don't think the fish have to show a passport to cross the border. They go to whichever side they want. That was the point. Ray

545251,Guest,2005-01-20 17:25:00,0,"Actually Rainy is made up of 3 basins. They are like their own lakes. The north arm, south arm, and Red Gut Bay. The south arm is shared with Mn. The North Arm and Red Gut are entirely in Ontario. These fish do not cross the border. The Biologist have done genetic testing and the fish basicly stay in their own basins. The south arm is more walleye, with some bass and northern fishing, Red Gut is a mixture of all species, and the north arm is where the smallie fishing is the best in the world, big northerns and the walleye is coming back. Which basin you fish should depend on what species is your primary target fish. Remember: limits are not something to strive for, they are there to limit people from taking to many. Eat a few, throw the rest back."

I would prefer to go to a boat in resort the thinking being less pressure but my mind could be changed quickly. I'm looking for information about where the best walleye fishing is located (such as the SE minnesota side, the Northwest Bay of the canadian side or Red Gut Bay, etc..) I assume the walleyes are schooled up by this time of year and migrate to specific sections of the lake. My wife and I have never been to Rainy Lake so any detailed info or suggestions would be greatly appreciated."

I would definitely encourage you to at least consider going with a houseboat. We had great times and you can pull right to the area you want to fish."

545162,Guest,2005-01-17 19:11:00,0,"I've fished Rainy on both sides of the border within the past 3 years and was very disappointed with the fishing action on the Minnesota side. I stayed at Sha-Sha Resort(nice cabins, but the staff is way more interested in running their bar than tending to you) this past 4th of July and the fishing was very tough. I fished from 3' to 50' of water using bottom bouncers tipped with leeches/crawlers, crankbaits, jigs tipped with leeches/crawlers/minnows and slip bobbers using live bait and caught very few fish for the 14 hours or so I fished per day. 2 ""veteran anglers"" who had been coming up to Sha-Sha/Rainy Lake for more than 30yrs. finally caught 2 13"" walleyes on Wed. of that week and were happy to know the lake ""wasn't dead"". On the other hand I went with my family to Coppens Resort on the Canadian side during a week in July in 2002 and despite highs in the upper 80's & low 90's with huge T-storms at night(4 different mornings the gravel road by the boat launch was washed out and the owner spent all morning shoveling gravel to fix it)yet the fishing was by far better, numerous walleyes in the ""slot"" plus more than enough ""eaters"" to fulfill 2 suppers not to mention the great smallie action and I've been kicking myself for not going back.(I wanted to keep my money in the U.S. not support the Canadian/French tourism people). The cabins were duplexes at Coppens so your not exactly isolated from the other guests but maybe things have changed since. Although the weather last July was cold with many fronts coming thru if I wanted the better of the 2 for strictly fishing the Canadian side plus the friendliness of the owners at Coppens make this an easy choice for me. Just my 2 cents. Mickey"
545180,Bx2(IL),2005-01-18 16:30:00,62,You make it sound like the Canadian slot limits are working. Maybe they should have the same slot limits on the US side.
545188,Guest,2005-01-18 19:29:00,0,"Sounds like Mickey can stay in the US spend all his money and catch his 2-13"" walleyes. Typical.."
