545192,Pooch,2005-01-18 20:38:00,4619,"I always thought all of those ""patches on the shirt"" types are what my dad and uncles used to call ""sports"". You run across them all of the time in different camps and from time to time they can provide you with alot of entertainment. Every hobby or sport has these fellows. Most are good guys and I'm only kidding them. No harm meant. Pooch"
545194,Guest,2005-01-18 21:22:00,0,"lighten up pal, I think were all sort of joking on this thread. And by the way, I only do one in Chicago, to see everyone. lol"
545196,Guest,2005-01-19 02:31:00,0,"To answer dumbo's question about why we have bags of brochures.When the kid is driving me up a wall,and the wife is having another #$!*& hot flash,I quietly sneek down stairs to my bathroom,take out my bag from under the sink, look at the pictures of big walleye's and northern's,the glass calm lakes, and tell myself this is exactly what I will be doing the last week of June-----Hey it gets me thru aother day."
545197,Guest,2005-01-19 06:34:00,0,Mine are kept in the same place...under the sink...a brochure is perfect size and length for that purpose!!!!!!!!!!!!
545200,Guest,2005-01-19 07:32:00,0,"If I were you, I would skip the beer and head straight for the hard stuff!!!!!!!!!!!"
545201,Guest,2005-01-19 07:57:00,0,Auditions for deliverence II thats funny stuff. I don't know how you do it sit there for 3 or 4 days and show after show. I feel sorry for the guys sittin there by themselves. Any way they are fun and a way to pass sometime. Good Luck to all. By the way I'm planning a canoe trip with 3 buddies anyone know where we can put in and have someone drive our cars to where we plan to get out?
545202,bigfish1965,2005-01-19 08:43:00,3210,I always go to these shows the first day it opens. Everyone there is still bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. By day four everyone has had enough of 'Do you guys got big fish there?' I limit my fishing garb to a non-camo hat. Never did understand the guys at ice fishing shows walking around in floater suits....
545207,mrwalleyesneighbor,2005-01-19 13:20:00,10,Seen a few of them in the grocery store in Red Lake!!
545171,Guest,2005-01-18 11:22:00,0,"Over this past week, I went to the two big outdoors shows in the Chicago area, the All-Canada Show, and the big show at Rosemont. I met a friend at both shows that I recently got hooked on fishing, and took with me on his first trip to Canada in August. He has never gone to the fishing shows before and he had two keen observations. 1. Why do strange people go to these shows wearing head to toe Camo gear and other ""fishing clothes"". Has anyone ever shot a deer, or caught a walleye at one of these shows? If the answer is no, then people should dress normal. 2. His second observation was that as a whole, the group of people at the Rosemont Show was collectively about the ugliest group of people he had ever seen. I started to object, but looked in the mirror and saw a middle-aged pudgy bald guy wearing a camo hat and a walleye pictured on my shirt. Next year I am wearing a tie to these events."
545172,Guest,2005-01-18 11:26:00,0,Good post/good observation. you have described my neighbor/friend to a tee!
545175,Guest,2005-01-18 12:26:00,0,Must be a Chicago thing cause all the shows I go to in Iowa and Minnesota have only good looking people at them.
545176,Guest,2005-01-18 12:46:00,0,"recently attended the show in Kansas City. Black Tie Event, most of the women wore Bikinis."
545179,Bx2(IL),2005-01-18 16:26:00,62,I resemble that remark. I'm a pudgy bald guy that went to the Chicago All Canada Show wearing a heavy camo jacket because it was cold out.
545181,Guest,2005-01-18 16:48:00,0,"Why did they wear camo? Well, maybe they were Bears fans? :) Oh, I'm sorry."
545182,Guest,2005-01-18 16:50:00,0,See what happens when Ranger quits sponsoring it? (tic) LOL!
545183,Guest,2005-01-18 18:00:00,0,"I have done both those shows for years. I agree. lol Try sitting there for 3 months, all day long, in different towns, listening to the same questions. We use to joke, that at some of the shows they where having auditions for deliverence 2. The only thing you forgot was the handful of pictures of fish that they caught 25 years ago to show us ""every"" year, even if they have never stayed at our camp. My personal favorites are the husband and wife combo, with the matching shirts and the matching patches up and down their arms. A few had my hats on and that is OK though lol. If it wasn't for the beer, I honestly think I couldn't make it through the first day........"
545184,Guest,2005-01-18 18:39:00,0,"Exactly why I don't go to sport shows very often. It is usually filled with camp owners that act disinterested, have pictures from 10 years ago and lie about the great camp. If you are that great, why are you at sport shows? I would think repeat business would fill your camp.But if you have the attitude that is shown here, it is probably your clients that have to drink beer all week to survive your fishing camp."
545186,Guest,2005-01-18 19:12:00,0,"If it were not for camp owners, there would not be any bags of brochures for me to annoy my wife with. I like to take a few and put them around the house for her to see and pick up. But I do have to ask the question, How many brochures does one need to survive? I see some guys walking out with their ""Temple Bay Lodge"" or ""North Shore Lodge"" bags filled with brochures. There has got to be a hundred brochures in one bag. I do agree with Camp Owner. If I had to sit there for all that time looking at that crowd, I might tip a few beers. I am presently tipping one for the camp owners of the world!!! The matching outfit husband/wife combo is a great look, but I will give you one better. Go to the Boat/RV show this week at McCormack. Upstairs are the uppity crowds looking at boats that no one could afford, and downstairs will be that same husband/wife look alike crowd dragging around all of their kids with mullets looking at RV's they could never afford. To have these two complete opposite crowds in the same place is brilliant. What a culture clash walking in and out of there."
