BEER BATTER RECIPE- this makes a very light, crunchy coating that does not overpower the fish flavor! 1 cup cornstarch, 1+ 1/4 cup white flour, 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper,1/2 tsp paprika = Dry Ingredients. 1 tbs. oil, 2 tsp. lemon juice, 1 bottle of your favorite beer= Wet Ingredients. Mix all dry ingredients. Mix all wet ingredients. Mix wet and dry together until smooth. Try for the consistency of uncooked & mixed pancake batter. Add more beer if too sticky. Dip your walleye fillets in beer batter, and drop in HOT....and I mean smokin' hot oil. Cook till golden brown, remove and feast. This batter is great, not doughy or bready.....just a nice crunchy coating."

545278,Guest,2005-01-21 20:10:00,0,Most people prefer the delicate taste of walleye by just using a simple flour/salt/pepper coating that brings out the walleye flavor.
544953,Guest,2005-01-06 13:23:00,0,"Try this one sometime for shore lunch. Build a fire and set a can of opened beans on the side stirring often. Put a pound of good bacon, the kind you buy from your local butcher, the good thick stuff, in the shore lunch pan. When bacon is done remove and add a pound of lard to the pan. Coat the fish with flour, salt and pepper in a zip lock baggie then fry (keep stirring the beans). Eat fish on buttered bread with tarter (optional). I bring a couple good logs from camp for this. All you bring back is the pan and the tin can."

Give the fish a lite coat of the nonstick spray and little (or lot) of your favorite ""blackened red fish seasoning"" or ""Seafood Magic"". I use one by ""Chef Paul Prudhomme"". Coat both sides of the fillet and a couple of minutes per side on a hot grill. You can use a gas grill but they tastes much better over charcoal. It's 10 below here today but I think I'll fire up the charcoal grill and have a banquet tonight."

545132,515,2005-01-15 18:54:00,254,One of my favorites. Using walleye fillets from fish about 16 inches in length. Melt about 1/2 inch of butter in frying pan over open fire works best. Lay fillets in skin side down and cook for approx. 3 minutes. Then turn over and add approx. half a can of beer to pan and poach the fillets for another 3 minutes while spooning the beer and butter mixture over the fish. Try to keep a good heat under the pan to keep the mixture bubbling. Enjoy Mike
544939,Guest,2005-01-05 13:05:00,0,Lets hear from the cooks in camp and find out the best way to cook Eyes.
544942,retire55,2005-01-05 17:54:00,1029,"Kevin: We routinely eat walleyes between 14 and 20 inches in length that have come from a lightly stained deep lake. Their flesh is quite white and very sweet tasting and each member of our group very much enjoys the sweet taste of walleye. As the cook, I'm very reluctant to mess with what mother nature has provided. Consequently, walleye fillets, seasoned with a little salt and pepper, are cooked in a non stick sauce pan over moderate heat with a little butter. Particular care is required to ensure no overcooking at all. Although the recipe isn't very creative, the result is thoroughly enjoyable. Indeed, for our group, its outstanding! However, I'm positive that everyone has a favourite walleye recipe."
544945,phishfearme,2005-01-06 05:37:00,1242,we grill walleye using a fish basket/holder. spread a thin layer of soft butter/margarine on both sides of the fillets (while in the holder) then sprinkle with lemon-pepper seasoning. grill over a hot grill. WOW! don't forget to spray the hold with PAM first. - phish
544946,Guest,2005-01-06 06:32:00,0,"Every night stirs up something different for us when we are on our big trips: Grilled pizza walleye with a side of beer battered walleye, grilled walleye tacos with a side of beer battered walleye, grilledn plum glazed walleye with a side of beer battered walleye, lemon pepper walleye with a side of beer battered walleye...etc. Every night is something new, for cripes sake, my friend gets boners over cooking this stuff - however, there is always a side of beer battered walleye just in case something doesn't turn out."
544947,Guest,2005-01-06 07:09:00,0,"Chop the fillets up and mix them with egg, cracker crumbs, salt ,pepper and fine chopped onions. Make patties out of them and fry them in butter. Walleye patties taste better than salmon patties."
544948,Guest,2005-01-06 07:29:00,0,"Double layer foil without cutting. Drop a spoon of margarine on the foil. Lay fillets out evenly. Season with Montreal Steak Spice, Lowry's Seasoning Salt, and lemon pepper. Cover with mushrooms, onions, and last but certainly not least sliced tomatoes. Pull the foil back over the top, cut, and fold up all the sides. Place over LOW heat (low flame or hot coals) for 15-20 minutes. Puncture top of foil when required to prevent explosion. Ummmmm . . . good eats!"
544949,Guest,2005-01-06 08:49:00,0,"We use a similar recepie. We lightly roll the fish in pancake flour or fry magic and cook them on the camp fire in butter using a big camp fry pan. Salt & pepper the fish after you put them in the pan. You don't need a lot of salt when cooking with butter. To start you build a big fire, go clean your fish and have a few cold ones. When the fire burns down your ready to cook. We bring our own grate for the fire pit and cook on top of it. It's a mess, and takes more time because you don't want to burn the butter. The fish is excellent. It's still our group favorite. It's sinnful how many we eat that first night! Any leftover's are breakfast!"
544950,Guest,2005-01-06 09:08:00,0,"NWO, Sounds a lot like a shore lunch with the Silver Water Wheel gang."
544951,Guest,2005-01-06 09:34:00,0,"I like the basic, egg, bisquick, and fry. However, in the winter, I sometimes use this recipe for a change. Mix the following: Dejour mustard, worchester sauce, butter, lemon juice Coat your fillets in a baking pan and sprinkle bread crumbs over the fillets and bake for 15 minutes or until done. Nice change"
544952,woods,2005-01-06 12:00:00,646,"I like to deep fry walleye in the summer, but in the winter, I like to use Shore Lunch Cajun mix, and make a tarter sauce from Lite Miracle Whip, Heinz sweet pickle relish and an equal quantity of finely chopped cilantro, with a little lemon juice. Yummy!"
