A couple years ago, my Dad and I stopped at a tackle shop on 11 between North Bay and New Likeard on our annual trip to Lost Lake Wilderness Lodge near Gowganda. I think the name of the tackle shop is called Gramps. A tow truck pulled into the parking lot with a Pontiac Grand Am behind it that had hit a moose the night before. There was absolutely nothing left of the front end. That was the first time my Dad and I had seen a car that had hit a moose. Luckily, the person driving escaped with only minor injuries also. The owner of the tackle shop told us that someone was killed the year before in a collision with a moose just down the road, also at night. Apparently, most collisions with moose happen at night."
