I requested a web reference that would provide information to those who wished to visit Canada (e.g. on a fishing trip) but who had a past DUI/DWI conviction. They provided me with a reference to a general web page - see http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/applications/rehabil.html as well as the following web reference for a guide: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/kits/guides/5312E.PDF From what I understand, if its been 10 years since the DUI conviction, one is considered rehabiliated and a 10 year old DUI won't prohibit anyone from entering Canada. If it has been between 5 years and 10 years since the DUI conviction, then one is advised to apply for rehabilitation well in advance of your trip. If the DUI conviction was less than 5 years ago, you are advised to contact a Canadian Embassy responsible for your region to receive detailed assistance - see http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/offices/missions.html"
