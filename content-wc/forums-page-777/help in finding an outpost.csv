They are one of the few fly-ins I could find that would take a party of 2 without paying a huge penalty. Top notch operation, Don and Annete Elliot are excellent hosts. They will put you on fish if you can't find them, and unless you're incompetent you'll find them ;) A party of two with food, gas, beer, trip, licenses, etc. will run you a less than $2500 for a week of fishing. Less than that for a 4 or 5 day trip. Do a search on this site using Mattice Lake Outfitters and read them. Not a single negative comment anywhere. Good luck. Let us know who you book with."

They have a main camp on Burditt (Clearwater Lake) about 50 minutes northwest of international falls, mn. They have several outpost/ remote lakes for a variety of species including walleye, lakers, pike, smallies and largies as well as muskie fishing on the main lake. -Davis"

My problem is that I don't know about a fly-in with just 2. I am not a pork and beaner but also can't afford more than about 2500 for the round trip.I have all the tackle an army could use! I got stocked up last year and when I got there I used minnows,leeches and crawlers. Probably start with that this time. Would like to get away to an outpost rather than a lodge. Would like to just get away from work, listen to the loons,see some of the beauty and catch some 'eyes and share it with my best friend. Since he can't go I'll settle for the old lady-lol."
545224,Guest,2005-01-19 22:53:00,0,"If you want a good operation with nice cabins and good fishing try L+M flyins. I don't know their web site, but you can do a search and it will come up. Good Luck, Ray"

545232,Guest,2005-01-20 08:49:00,0,Good one. Got me laughing.
545235,DaveIN,2005-01-20 11:03:00,191,Try Slate Falls Outfitters. Their Maskara lake package is available for two people. Took my wife there and she loved it. Only about a twenty minute flight from Sioux Lookout.
545243,Guest,2005-01-20 13:13:00,0,"There are two resorts that own outpost cabins on Lac Seul. One is Lac Seul Lodge, and they own one on Sunlight Lake, and the other on a bay whose name i forgot. Check out their website. The one on Sunlight is great. I have not stayed there because my groups are too big for it but it would be great for the two of you. I think it only holds four. I know that Scout Lake resort also owns a remote cabin in McKenzie Bay. I have not seen it but it is in the middle of great fishing. If I had a smaller group I would try to book up that Sunlight Lake one. It is about 20 miles in, so if you needed anything, you could head back to camp in about an hour. Good luck finding anything open for this year though...you will be booking for 2006."
545244,Guest,2005-01-20 14:45:00,0,A reasonable priced outpost would be annishinabi outpost. This is a boat in remote. You need to go threw wine lake camp to reserve this one. You could even stay at wine Lake Camp becuse this is a remote resort. Website is www.winelakecamp.com. Shoe89
545254,BuckeyeWilly,2005-01-20 19:09:00,41,"Hey ASU72, a few years back I took my wife to boat-in cabin on Minnitaki Lake near Sioux Lookout. The cabin is run by Dan Baas, Patricia Fly-in outfitters. Real nice cabin with generator, running water, complete kitchen, (outside bathroom). Fishing was great for walleyes, pike and a few smallies thrown in. My wife enjoyed everything about the trip (except for the bathroom)."
