545230,mwal,2005-01-20 07:47:00,151,I use Maxima ultra green 6lb or 8lb. I too tried fireline for jigging and my sucess went down also. I switched back to mono and back to catching fish. I figured out the reason from my obervations that the fire line was much smaller diameter thus the jigs fell much quicker and did not act the same as they did with thicker mono. The line was affecting the fall rate of the jig. Perhaps you could then switch to a lighter jig or larger profile plastic to slow fall rate down but I stuck with the jigs I had and went back to mono. I do have all my trolling rods riged up with fireline and spider wire as I think it does a better job in trolling applications than mono. Good luck jigging Mwal

However, after fishing with fireline for a few years, I guess I just like the sensitivity much better than mono, and it doesn't swist. Maybe I need better rods for the mono. It works so well for the kids and wife. You can pop out snags more often because you can feel them right away. We fish in Canada late July so the walleye are fairly aggressive. I'm sure I'd need to change tatics earlier. The deeper the fish the more I like fireline for jigging. I'm also lucky as to live close to Spirit Lake where they make it. You can buy over-run spools for $3."
545163,Guest,2005-01-18 07:59:00,0,What type of line do you experts recommend for jigging Walleye. We fish in the early summer and spend most of our time fishing in 6 to 10 foot water with 1/4 or 3/8 oz jigs tipped with minnows or twister tails.
545167,Guest,2005-01-18 09:54:00,0,Started spooling Power Pro three years ago and I love it. I use the 10Lb test which is 2lb diameter. It works great for jigging. I think it makes for better hook sets and I can fish with a little looser drag in case a big girl comes along. When I used mono it was only 6lb test and the 10lb Power Pro is of course stronger and diameter is good. Also use it dragging crank baits and the no strech is awesome for hook sets.
545169,Guest,2005-01-18 10:58:00,0,"Stren Magnathin 10 pound strength, that has a diameter of 8 pound. Never had any problems with line twist, and low memory. The worst line was some stuff called P-line. A bait shop bragged about it and I let them put it on one reel. It came off so curly, it was like fishing with a slinky. I use Power Pro on all my baitcasting and it is great stuff, but do not like any superline on spinning reels, only mono."
545178,Guest,2005-01-18 16:04:00,0,I've been happy with fireline.
545185,Guest,2005-01-18 19:08:00,0,"I like fireline also. Same reasons as Power Pro. It will be a bit stiff when you first start using it, but softens up pretty quickly. I use it on spinning rods, and it works great. Never have had one of those line twist birdnests with fireline. Its a great line for beginners, and even better for those that know a thing or two about fishing. I usually go with the 8 or 6 lb versions. It is tough stuff. All the best, Agate"
545195,Guest,2005-01-18 22:15:00,0,Fireline unless there is a lot of wood around. I put mono on my Dad's...easier to pop his snags out of
545204,Guest,2005-01-19 12:04:00,0,I have tried Fireline but switched to Power Pro. Seems that Power Pro doesent cut into my spool on my spinning reel like Fireline. Plus I think Power Pro is more sensitive.
545219,Guest,2005-01-19 19:39:00,0,I use fireline however in ten or less feet of water a quality abrasion resistant mono might be fine.You might want to use a flourocarbon leader if the water is especially clear.
545226,Backwater Eddy,2005-01-20 04:02:00,3871,"I am on the Power Pro boat, like the stuff a lot for most all walleye fishing needs. This season I tried the PP ICE LINE for early and late season cold weather fishing and liked it even more. The PP ICE LINE is even more managable and spools well and best of all, it reduces guide icing. Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""ED on the RED"" ><,sUMo,>"
545229,Guest,2005-01-20 07:21:00,0,"Interesting all the Power Pro and Fire Line responses. I've used those, and still use Power Pro for my musky rigs. However, for jigging, I've gone back to using regular old 8 lb. mono. I primarily use the clear Trilene XL. For some reason, I seem to catch more fish jigging with the mono. I don't know if it's in my head or whether the stretch of the mono helps in some way. I love the feel you get with the superlines, but I think I might have been setting the hook too soon with all that feel. I use the fireline for bottom bouncing, but once again use mono leaders after the bouncer. Good luck."
