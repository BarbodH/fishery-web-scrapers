Both out of Armstrong, Ontario; any advice or info on these outfitters, their lakes and the fishing there(numbers/size), etc. is much appreciated."

Cabins, equipment, getting in/out all fine. Have never been with Mattice Lake but they have gotten nothing but the highest praise on this board over the years. I have a second cousin who goes with them every year and he also thinks that they are great. I don't think you can go wrong with either. Crede"

They are great outfitters -- nice cabins, boats, etc. And the fishing has been outstanding the 2 times I flew in with them."

I should see him in a week or so and will ask if he has been to Bellsmith. If so, I'll direct him to this topic and hopefully he can be of help. Crede"
