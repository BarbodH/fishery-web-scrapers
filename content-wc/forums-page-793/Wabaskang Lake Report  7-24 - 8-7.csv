The second week the weather pattern was more normal in the mid to low 70's for the highs. At first the walleye were scattered, then suspended, then schooled up nicely before departure. We caught eyes in the cabbage up in Gawleys bay and in 40 ft. of water off Birch island. So to say the least we had to hunt for them on a regular basis the first 10 days. By the end of the second week the boats were lined up off the 2nd narrows in big Wabby so they must have been catching some there. We spent two days up in Gawley's bay/ 3rd narrows and caught our limit of eyes then caught some nice bass in the boulder rocks. Spent a partial day down in Keynote - some jumbo perch and several slot northerns. Went back into Moose Bay and found some bass along the rock cliff. Caught a 38 inch northern there on a tube fishing for the bass. More bass way back in Aerobus along the cliff wall. I do believe we caught more bass than ever. North bay produced some small eyes and northern. No bass there for us but others had said they had been catching some there. Highlight of the week was a 31 inch eye off Doe island. A 36, and 39 inch northern on the North shore of big Wabby on big sucker minnows and a 36 inch northern in Pat's bay on a five of Diamonds. Minus the 31 inch eye the next largest was 25 inch and the rest 22 or smaller.Most of the eyes were caught on jig/minnow combos. Spent two days in Wine lake with good success on the eyes and northerns. No trout - I even spent a couple hours both trips trying to catch one. We thought we marked some at 65 ft. but my tackle didn't match those conditions. The blueberries are just coming on. We CPR'd all the northern's, bass, and largest two eyes. Those smaller eyes and perch sure did taste great."

I was unlucky enough to experience the mayflies the week of July 16-23, and it really made things tough. Going back up the 20th of Aug so things should really be heading in the right direction up there. That 31"" eye must have been a beautiful fish! Mike"
542462,Guest,2004-08-09 17:24:00,0,ab Where did you fish at on Wine Lake? Was the Wine Lake Camp full or did it look pretty empty? Shoe89
542468,AB,2004-08-09 21:19:00,61,"Shoe, Tried the narrows for the trout and pulled up some hammerheads. Turn around for the eyes. South end West bank for the pike. Looked like business was good at the camp. By the time we get over there in the morning though a lot of boats are already out fishing when we drive by the camp so it's kinda hard to tell. I guess it was OK for us to go into Wine - our last thread someone was !@#$%* off that people from Wabby go back there. I guess it's OK for them to cross Wabby to get there but it's not OK for us to go back there! LOL! Since an Indian guide named Jack from Jim's camp took me there 20 years ago I think I have a right! Even named my first born Jack - after him. Ah - the memories!"
542469,AB,2004-08-09 21:24:00,61,"Big Mike, The weather appeared to be straightening out. Seemed like everything was behind a few weeks. Aug. might turn out to be the MONTH. That 31 inch eye was our second largest since a 34 off Devil's in 1986. Two weeks of hard fishing a guy deserves one - you know it?!"

542660,Guest,2004-08-17 07:29:00,0,"Trailerguy I will be going up then, will be up for a week so I will try to swing by your cabin if your around, I'll be fishing a little bit in the weed beds around your cabin and just north along those points that are between the narrows and the Indian camp. Later, Mike"
542687,Trailerguy,2004-08-17 19:20:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I'll probably hunt after 4pm., but will be around mid day mostly. Stop by I'll get you a cold one."
