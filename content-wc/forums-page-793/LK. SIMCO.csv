542639,Guest,2004-08-16 08:20:00,0,I will be there early in October for perch but usually we have our limit by the 2nd day and we stay for 4 days. I have heard that there are walleye in Simco. What areas should we be fishing for walleyes. What should we use--harnesses or cranks or something else. We usually fish in Cooks Bay but I am open to fishing anywhere on the lake. Thanks for the Help.
