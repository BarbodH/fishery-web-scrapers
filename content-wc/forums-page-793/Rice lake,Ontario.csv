I've heard rumers that numbers are also down in the Bay of Quinte, can any one comment on their experiances in the last couple of years. Many thanks in advance to all replies. John"

His reply was that the indians were netting the lake. Don't know if it is true, not sure why he would lie.....We could always catch enough to eat a few meals and take some home. Not the last 2 years though. Plenty of crappie and bluegill though. Take care"
