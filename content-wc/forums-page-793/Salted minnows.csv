I fished from shore with them and anchored in a boat. I have never caught anything very big with them though. I don't know about the rest of Canada, but they are the only minnows allowed in those two provinces. They are fairly easy to find. Good luck Larry"

There really wasn't any difference between salted and fresh when using a spinner. During hot weather you often loose a number of minnows overnight, drop them in a ziplock with salt/borax, refrigerate then use them up in a day or two."
542355,Guest,2004-08-04 14:00:00,0,I have used salted/sugared minnows for the past 10 years. They work well with jigs and spinners. I use 1/4 cup of salt and 1/4 cup of sugar in a quart ziplock with 1 1/2 cup of minnows. Shake the salt and sugar to mix before adding minnows. Sugar makes the salt a lot less hard on the hands and seems to make the minnows more firm.

Just keep them cool and you have great bait. I've been using them for several years in NWO. I take the bags with salt in them right to the bait store the day before I go and keep them(and worms)in a cooler with a gallon of frozen water in a jug at camp. If the salt/minnow mixture gets watery just pour out the excess water. I also bring 4 doz. worms in bedding. Seems like when we are done I throw have of both away. Use on spinners or jigs."
