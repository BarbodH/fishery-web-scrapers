We fished hard and had a great time. Mostly fished Deception Bay up to the Lighthouse. Gulp was our best bait and outfished crawlers and leechese 3 to 1 - 16-24 feet of water. White or red hooks seemed to work best. Have a great time."

Was it a worm or the twister tails and which color. I have some Gulp but mostly the split tails and twister tails. I had planned taking a flat of nightcrawlers with me. Should the Gulp be close to the natural color (makes sense) or a dark color which would also imitate a leech? The lighthouse you were referring to, is it the one near Bear Narrows? We fish out of Tuk Bay outpost every May and it is great fishing in that area. Did you find walleye mostly on points, reefs, etc., or were they back in some bays close to deep water? Thanks for the help eyesnatcher email: [email protected]"
