This lake is 2 hours north of Thunder Bay and the fishing for Walleye is totally unbelievable! On our last day there my partner decided to count them and between the two of us we caught 247 walleyes mostlly between 17-26.5 inches. This is a drive in lake with fly in quality. It was great to see fish in the 6"" range also just showing how healthy this fishery is. If you are looking for a great Canadian fishing trip I would be more than happy to help you out further. This lake is by far the best lake I have ever fished in Ontario. My e-mail address is [email protected]."

542595,Toast,2004-08-13 10:22:00,25,I haved fished a few times at Gossling a outpost camp from Holinshead. Also went on a fly in moose hunt through them. Went the first year after the new managemant and haven't been back. Don't care for the new management.

They have recently sold their outpost camps in order to focus mainly on the resort at Holinshead. I will try and find their new website also. As far as walleyes go, the largest one we personally seen caught and released in the lake has been 31.25""."
