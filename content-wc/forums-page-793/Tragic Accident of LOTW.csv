He must have let go of the tiller handle and fell out when it swerved. Some fishermen nearby heard him yelling for help and saw the empty boat circling. He attempted to grab the boat and get in according to the police. When the fishermen got over to the boat, Devin was gone. They have not yet recovered Devin. Needless to say, the whole community is saddened by the death of this very bright 17 year old from a really nice family. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Devin's parents, Pete and Donna and his sister Nadia. Devin worked at Hanson's King Island Lodge and was Randy Hanson's nephew. The OPP told me that this is the 4th drowning this year in the district and all were in tiller boats, none in boats with steering wheels. There are inherent dangers in tiller operated boats. Please, everyone, be careful out there. Use the kill switch and wear life jackets, especially if you are a poor swimmer. I will pass on additional information as I learn of it."
542454,Guest,2004-08-09 15:29:00,0,What a tragic loss. My Prayers are with him and his faimly. Lets all remember to be safe and make sure those who fish with us are safe also. A life jacket can be the difference between being back home with your family alive or being carried to your resting place by six fishing buddies.

IF not all the time at least when the boat is in motion! Use the safety lanyard...it takes two seconds. If not for you then for your wife and kids.
542457,MTJ,2004-08-09 15:50:00,106,First heard of the accident Sat. afternoon while we were out fishing. Just happened to be on the same frequency as the guys who went to help. Made my heart drop. Whoever the guys are that tried to help deserve a huge thank you for their efforts. My thoughts and prayers go out to the family of Devin.

Some of you that are familiar with the Morson area may better know Devin's Mom as Donna Hanson of Hanson's Kind Island Lodge. The mailing address for Hanson's, for those of you that know the family and would like to send a card is: Hanson's Wilderness Lodges Ltd. Box 96 Nestor Falls, Ontario Canada P0X 1K0 Nobody can be sure of what happened. A good friend of mine (and a long time guest of both ours and Hanson's) spoke with Devin's family and all they could tell him was that Devin was heading in to Nestor Falls to pick up a friend to do some fishing. At this point, I think speculation is counter productive. Remember to be careful out there everyone."

I do not know if there was a mechanical failure with the steering, but I spoke with three guys who were thrown from a boat. They were lucky and were ok. But it could of been tragic. I don't know about the mechanics of powering steering or the powering units that you can get with tillers, but obviously more people have got to know what happens if you let go. It's just not only tillers."

Prior to the trip I took them to Gander Mountain and got us all properly fitted life vests. Every one of us wore them every second on the water, and even onshore when we stopped at a rocky island. Slippery rocks are a killer. These jackets are compact and took little getting used to. Gives peace of mind when backtrolling on choppy water too. I'd encourage all dad's to engrain it in their kids to unconditionally wear them."
