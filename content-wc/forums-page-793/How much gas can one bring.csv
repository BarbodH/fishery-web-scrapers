541798,Guest,2004-07-19 09:54:00,0,"Again, if the resort owners want to make money, charging triple on gas is not the way to do it. Hospitality - friendly spirits, clean cabins, maid service (if offered), clean fish houses, fish cleaners, friendly and helpful guides,...etc. Food - good food (if offered with the fee), hot food, plentiful food, friendly service, cold brewskis...etc. I could go on. I understand a $2,000 fee to get a new tank and pump for the resort, but spread those fees through the prices (for example, charge an extra $25 per person per week), don't triple your gas price...thats just a rip off. If you run your camp the way you wrote your post, good luck in 5 years. We'll see you running the local Quickee Mart."
541800,Guest,2004-07-19 11:03:00,0,"The places we stayed for the most part filled the tanks in our presence and we signed for that and any minnows or bait at the time. then there is no question. although one place to remain nameless on the bill at the end of the week had like a 100 dollor charge for 2 fishing licenses that we bought in town not from him. that final bill is so long and full of things most people probably dont even give it a good going over. another place that already had high prices ""forgot"" about the $300 US deposit we had sent up earlier. all this happened in the computer age so there is no excuse for it. When someone screws up on our first timer bill thats it for that place. My 2 cents."
541807,Guest,2004-07-19 14:38:00,0,"I can certainly understand why many of you would be leary about resorts if that is the kind of behavior your outfitters are participating in. Our gas is less than the outfitter in Ear Falls claimed he was selling his for. Resorts on islands are eligble to apply for a refund of the gas tax, which is about 15 cents per litre so keep that in mind next time you fill up at an island resort. They should be selling it for less than those on the mainland. Gas should be (in most areas of NW Ontario right now) around $0.95-$1.10 per litre CANADIAN. We don't gouge on anything. As I said before, that is just plain wrong. We don't want to make a living selling gas, we just want it to be worthwhile having the pumps and tanks on the property. You can't go in the hole, which is what you'll do when you sell it for cost and pay someone to pump it. Why should everyone pay more for accomodations? If someone uses a lot less fuel than the group next to them, how is that fair? People spend good money on 4-stroke outboards to conserve fuel. Conserving natural resources if a good thing for everyone. Some groups will come for a long weekend and not need to by gas because they fill up before the cross the border (something I don't have a problem with at all) and be able to fish off their 40 gallon tank and 4 stroke outboard the whole weekend. Making everyone pay more for the cabins seems like a prime example of gouging to me. All our gas and bait gets signed for by our guests. Bills are checked and rechecked. We encourage our guests to look them over and ask any questions they have before they depart. Thirteen years and counting. We haven't done a sport show in over 8 years. We're booked a year ahead and people tell their friends about us. We want people to enjoy their vacation and feel they've got good value for their hard earned dollars. The final point I will make is this: if you are being treated in ways that have been mentioned on this thread, you shouldn't go within 100 yards of a place like that again. There are people (whether they are Canadians or Americans) running resorts that will gladly treat you well and appreciate your business. Being a good host is of the utmost importance. Having said that, I believe it's important to be a good guest as well. That's the last I'll say on the topic. My purpose was certainly not to irritate people. Have a good rest of the summer, everyone."
541840,Guest,2004-07-20 14:14:00,0,"Conservantly we run 8 cabins full, with and average of 25 guests for the 1st 14 wks, then 6 more weeks at about 2/3 each summer. We improved our gas facilitys 3 yrs. ago at $3500. That's 446 guests a year, minimum. At a buck a head the improvement will be paid down the 8th. year, not to mention that both staight and mixed gas are pretty much a requirement just to operate the pickup and the lawn mowers,ect, around camp. I really don't see the need to exploit gas prices. My .02"
541841,Guest,2004-07-20 15:16:00,0,"I have been fortunate to have visited Lac Seul on 2 separate trips the last 3 weeks. Both on the northwest end and there was a significant difference in gas prices, Resort A charged $3.50/ Gallon and Resort B charged $6.50/ gallon. In addition, virtually every aspect of Resort A (accomodations, service, ice, bait, docks, fish cleaning houses, etc...) was better that Resort B, plus Resort A was significantly less $$$ for lodging. The amazing part, everyone at Resort B had been coming there for years and thought they were getting a great deal. I don't intend to visit Resort B again. Bottom line, if you feel your being gouged, spend some time visiting the other resorts in the area - you may be surprised. How much should the resort owners charge for gas??? Being a capatalist, I would say as much as they can without losing customers!"

541997,Guest,2004-07-25 13:18:00,0,"I have the same question, but i don't have the time to read all these posts, what was the final answer? Thanks!!"
542599,Guest,2004-08-13 16:59:00,0,"I agree with all the posting Jazzy made. As a resort owner it is very difficult to get the amount of $$ you should for what you have to offer. We charge a 1.02 cents per litre for gas and that is very comparable to Marina's in our area. So you can pump it yourself at a gas station and save 8 cents a litre. Is it really worth it? If your looking for fishing tips help in cleaning fish etc. do you think I am going to go out of my way to help you??? NO I'm going to look after my guest who appreciate what I have to offer and have trust in that I'm not trying to take adventage of them. As Jazzy said if you buy your gas and/or bait at other locations and carry it down the dock of the place you are stay (and did not buy it) don't expect any fishing tips, help in docking or any advise. I like many other camp owner do not appreciate it, and if we can rent your cottage to someone else the following year we sure as #### would. Don't be Cheap - Most camps are family run, it's how we put food on our table."
542601,Guest,2004-08-13 20:43:00,0,"No disrespect, but if that is how you run your camp, holding grudges against those who bring their own gas, witholding tips and fishing info from them, giving them the cold shoulder...etc., then you deserve to be run out of business. Resorts should not make money on gas, they should make money on the hospitality they provide - leave the gas profits up to Exxon and Shell. You should be ashamed of yourself. I don't go to Canada for your gas, I go for the good times with my pals and the great fishing you provide - not your gas. >I agree with all the posting Jazzy made.

542602,Guest,2004-08-13 20:45:00,0,"PS, nobody should have to be finger-banged by price gouging resort owners. If they need money that bad, provide better services and then charge more.

541741,Guest,2004-07-16 11:13:00,0,"Just returned from Lac Seul & stayed at a resort, which I'm not naming & brought my own boat. We get 30 gallons of gas per week as part of our package. Now in years past we did not have to run far to find fish,but this year was different & we traveled much more & did more exploring. I have no problem buying things from Canada,such as bait, groceries & gas, but at this resort we were charged $6.25 U.S. per gallon for gas plus tax. By the time we left I felt like we were taken advantage of. I don't mind paying for things, just don't rape me!"
541768,Guest,2004-07-18 08:07:00,0,"Best to get your story straight. It does have to do with insurance and the provincial law that we as camp owners have to follow. Gas can only be stored in approved spillproof containment; that is why virtually all camps had to lay out thousands in the past couple years to put in diked and other safety storage. Gas in ""jerry-cans"" put us all at risk and I won't let someone trying to save a couple bucks to put my entire camp in jeperdy with gas behind the cabin. We charge a fair and reasonable amount (.85/liter US) for the convienience, dockside service and to offset our investment in facilities. If you don't like what the camp owner does you can always stay home!"
541771,Guest,2004-07-18 09:17:00,0,"Ya, Gary you and the insurance company make the rules at your camp. It wouldn't take much modification of the facilaties to ""accomodate"" (key word for those in the accomodation business)your guests. Wether or not a guest brings extra gas is their choice. I'd rather store their extra fuel in a proper manner, in approved containers of course in my facility than lose business. If you aren't constantly upgrading your facilitys you won't be there long anyway. Your return business will suffer just like the guy charging $6.25 a gal. Remember they can ""just stay home"" or stay at a more accomodating facility. :)"
541781,Guest,2004-07-18 17:30:00,0,Scenario: You have a full resort from opener til the middle of August. You have a few groups that bring gas. There is quite a few people coming by to ask if you can fit them in for a trip next year. Are you going to let the people that go out of their way to save a few bucks return or let someone new come in and see if they'll be a little more willing to support your resort and appreciate all the hard work and upgrading you are constantly doing to your facilities. If you think your outfitter is doing a good job and being reasonable with their prices/rates then you should support them or they might just not have room for you next year if they're busy.
541782,Guest,2004-07-18 17:42:00,0,"""If you think your outfitter is doing a good job and being reasonable with their prices/rates then you should support them or they might just not have room for you next year if they're busy."" This is a great point. You say ""if you think...."". Fine, if you thinkt they're doing a great job and have reasonable prices, pay for it. If not, bring your own gas or go somewhere else. If a resort is not going to pencil someone in because they bring their own gas, they deserve to go out of business. Resorts should not be making money on their gas prices. They should be making money on hospitalities, guide services, food, cabins...etc. - not gas."
541784,Guest,2004-07-18 19:15:00,0,"I couldn't agree more, the focas should be hospitality, and service, leave the gas business to the oil companys."
541788,Guest,2004-07-18 21:13:00,0,"WOW!! Shouldn't make money on gas, huh? Hmmmm. Well why should an outfitter make money on food then? You can bring that with too? How about crawlers? Probably should sell them for cost since those can be brought along as well. I guess an outfitter can make a nickel or two on minnows and leaches since they aren't allowed to be imported anymore. How do you make money on hospitality? Can an outfitter change a ""friendliness fee?"" Now that would make up for not making anything on gas. I guess that last gas pump that cost $2000 reconditioned and the overflow protection that was made mandatory on underground tanks ($1000) a few years ago should just get sucked up out of the money you would normally put in to buying more floating docks or upgrading the accomodations. When you put a years worth of work into a 7 month season and people are sitting at home to find ways to take money out of your pocket, it can be real frustrating. Having said that, if you're being gouged by anyone, that is abolutely wrong. You should never have to put up with that. But there is no way in #### that you can expect people to give stuff away, which is what you're doing when you don't make a profit on something. By the time you get the product there and maintain the facilities you need to house it or distribute it, you're going in the hole. That's how an outfitter will go out of business. Not by being more selective on who gets the privelege of staying at their resort. Everything costs money to maintain. Just having the gas at the dock and available should be worth a lot for the convenience. If you want to leave the gas business to the oil companies, you'll be trailering your boat about 65 miles to get gas. Oh wait, you'll probably bring your along so never mind."
541792,Guest,2004-07-19 05:46:00,0,So it's a PRIVILEDGE to be a SELECTED as a guest? Hospitality and service doesn't ring your cash register? Time to find a full time job man!!!!
541794,Guest,2004-07-19 07:40:00,0,"Hmmm, > ""friendliness fee?"" >When you put a years worth of work into a 7 month season >if you're being gouged by anyone, > privelege of staying at their resort > having the gas at the dock and available should be worth >a lot for the convenience Reminds me of a resort I stayed at one time only. One of my kids went up to the store and bought a lure with american $ and got a speel about how the lady hated making change for american $. The next day the other kid went up with Canadian $ and got told they wanted paid in american $. They are true Canadians, I laugh every year when we drive by and they have 3 partys in the whole camp,lol."
541796,Guest,2004-07-19 07:46:00,0,"Three years ago we stayed at a Lac Seul resort that shall remain shameless...I mean nameless. We found the fish on the other side of the lake so instead of two per boat, we piled in three per boat and left two boats at the dock to save on gas for two days. It was almost $7.00 per gallon. I agree it is probably costly to install gas pumps, and I think lodge owners certainly should make a living, but $7 is steep. That is gouging, not making a nice profit. The guide we had admitted to us over beers one night in the cabin that the lodge owner kicks him some money at the end of the week if we go over on gas. That was why he took us so far to fish. He then did show us some closer spots the next day and we tipped him well. IS THIS ALWAYS THE CASE LODGE OWNERS???? He made it sound like that was a standard agreement between guides and resort owners. Those two boats that were left at the docks were then used only about an hour those two days for some night fishing. The resort owner said he put in 3.5 gallons in each boat each day. We raised heck, and he took off 14 gallons from our bill and said it must have been a miscalculation on his part...sure it was. Not saying all resort owners are crooked, but this one was."
541662,BB,2004-07-13 20:56:00,15,Is there a limit on how much gas one can bring into Canada? I think there use to be. I always go in full with my Pro-V (40 gal). But my Dad was wondering if there was a limit on how many 6 gal cans he can bring for his boat.
541666,fishinnut,2004-07-13 22:21:00,642,You are allowed the capacity of your car and boat tank. Buy gas when you arrive. Even if the price is more it won't brake the bank and who wants to drive with extra tanks of high explosives.
541668,Guest,2004-07-14 00:51:00,0,"I agree. Support your outfitter. I did the math when I got home from my trip a couple weeks ago. Saw some guys with 5 cans in their truck. Between the three of them, they saved less than $20 each hauling those bombs up the highway. Don't skimp."
541671,Trailerguy,2004-07-14 05:44:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Customs allows you to bring a ""reasonable"" amount of fuel across the border. If they feel you have too much they charge you Canadian taxes. They seldom check how much you have, since the NAFTA treaty."
541672,Guest,2004-07-14 06:20:00,0,"I was just up there, we took all our gas for the week with us. The price wasn't really much different - someone stated it before, we only saved like $20.00, not including what we lost by pulling an extra 300 lbs. and the potential to go up in flames. If you do bring gas, they don't bother you - it's your call."
541687,Guest,2004-07-14 12:50:00,0,"Crossing @ Pembina ND it is an issue. You are allowed what the fixed gas tanks hold in vehicle and boat. Extra gas is that in ""jerry cans"" or gas cans. Was told that 1-5gal can would be ok more than that is taxable."
541696,Guest,2004-07-14 15:06:00,0,"people who haul gas in cans just to save acouple bucks should not be allowed to enter canada. it is a huge safety risk if you are in a accident. it might be me you run into and i don't want to burn to death. if it don't blow up it leaks all over all YOUR gear. its a vacation, if you can't afford to do it right stay home. a fello american"
541697,Rich J,2004-07-14 15:57:00,65,"Check with your outfitter before bringing any extra gas into camp. Some camps do not allow extra gas to be brought into camp, possibly something to do with insurance."
541708,Guest,2004-07-15 06:24:00,0,"Hey Jagbag, people have the right to do whatever they want. If a person brings 50 gallons of gas with them in addition to what their boat holds, so be it - it does not put you at risk."
