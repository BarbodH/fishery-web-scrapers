We were using Lindy rigs with minnows and leeches, the minnows seemed to do better for us. We caught a lot of fish in the slot range and several over the slot. The biggest was a 29"", we also had 2 that were 28"" and one 27"". Small jigs tipped with minnows also worked; however, the Lindy rigs did the best. Either way, light 6 - 8 lb fluorocarbon leaders, 3 - 4 ft long out fished heavier leaders or non-fluorocarbon. There were even some larger Walleye caught by another group, using the same gear. They had a 32"" and a 31"". Plenty of shorelunch size were readily caught as well."
542303,Guest,2004-08-02 23:29:00,0,Just wondering if anybody has any helpful tips on what to use or where to fish on Eagle Lake. My dad and I are headed to Canada for the first time on Sept. 2. Any info or experiences would be greatly appriciated.
542350,catchNrelease,2004-08-04 11:02:00,157,Where will you be staying? That will help narrow it down a bit as eagle is rather large.
542352,Guest,2004-08-04 11:19:00,0,We will be staying at Eagle Lake Resort.
542368,Guest,2004-08-05 07:08:00,0,Caution...you get what you pay for....my advice is to do a little more research on your accomodations. It may be for you but from what I've heard you may be in for a surprise.
542373,Guest,2004-08-05 11:18:00,0,"What are the problems...Basically all I am looking for is an access to a decent part of the lake...as far as the cabins go, as long as it has a roof it should work for me...my biggest concern is the area on the lake and the quality of fishing around there (eagle point), since I hear the east end gets fished quite a bit."
542380,Guest,2004-08-05 15:55:00,0,"As I say...you get what you pay for. This ranges from the roof over your head to the ""knowledgeable"" advice you may get from the lodge owner. Give it a try, just expect the bare minimum. The area of the lake you describe gets fished as much as the east end....consider spending some of the money your not spending on accomodation and invest it in hiring a guide...would be money well spent for you and your dad."

542384,BB,2004-08-05 20:22:00,15,"Just got back from Eagle yesterday. This was my 25th year and she again put out some nice fish. My dad had a 31"", I had two 30's and my sister had a 29"". We also boated numerous 26-28"" fish. Most guide and resort owners push minnows which are fine for spring and fall, but this time of year leeches and crawlers on lindy rigs will usually out produce minnows. We usually fish the Viking area and Portage bay and numerous spots inbetween. Trust your electronics. If you don't mark fish, move on to the next spot. We found most our fish in the 20-30 foot range last week on rocks and sand. Also tons of bait fish this year. Good luck."

542666,Guest,2004-08-17 09:25:00,0,Anyone have any recent reports on Eagle Lake?
