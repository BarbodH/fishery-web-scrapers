That took care of the short biters most of the time. That's probably why I seem to have a preference for the shorter Gulp baits.I like to use the 3 inch baits, Gulp crawler, Gulp fry, and the minnow grubs (look like minnow type twister tails). You can rig them on spinners (lindy rigs), floater rigs (Phelps floaters etc), three way rigs (wolf river rigs), or bottom bouncers, to help find fish. When you find a concentration, stop and work the area with jigs tipped with any of the gulp baits. Have even had luck with putting 2 Gulp 1 inch maggots on one jig like you would thread a worm. Crappies also go nuts for the Gulp bait (exdtruded grubs and the maggots). The worms are hooked through the tip of the nose and down about 1/2 inch so most of the bait is trailing the hook. Ater quite a few fish you may have to nip off the part of the bait that the hook was going through and rethread it. The Gulp minnow grub (twister tail) is rather fat. If you have a smaller hook, you may lose a lot of fish, so don't run the hook down the middle but keep it close to the outside edge to give the maximum hook gap. Gulp is different than plastic! Don't alow it to dry out and deffinently don't leave it on the hook when you are done fishing. Have you ever tried to getting a dried out leach off the hook. Same thing! The Gulp baits are ativated by water. As soon as it gets wet it starts releasing scent. That bait that you just got wet will stay activated until it dries out so don't put back in the original pouch when you are through for the day. If you do, it will activate every bait in the pouch!!! Carry ziplock sandwitch bags with you to put the activated bait in when not in use. Marv"

Seems like everytime I drop a leech down they curl up into a tight little ball on my hook. For that reason alone I've been using predominantly crawlers as they're unaffected by cold waters. My question to others is this: what would you say is the minimum water temp. for leeches to remain active, and thus a productive bait?"
542512,Guest,2004-08-11 18:05:00,0,"Don't mean to belittle Gulp but last year tried it 5 times on Gullrock and never caught a fish on it. Was jig fishing on a very productive hump with 1/4 oz jigs & Gulp twisters in 3 different colors. In 1/2 hour nothing. Went to my Mississippi River purple twister and a minnow......29"" walleye first cast. Caught 4 more 21"" fish off the same hump. Go figure. Tried 4 more times durring the week with nothing. Brother-in-law tried and nothing for him either. Bought some more Gulps this year at the Berkley Outlet Store in Spirit Lake for another try but still taking crawlers along and will have minnows and leeches onboard."
542610,bubbalou,2004-08-14 15:15:00,29,I also tried the Gulp bait this summer and had no success. Fishing was really tough that week so I don't think it was a fair test. I really want this bait to work so I can quit using live bait. I hate the hassle of keeping minnows and crawlers alive in the summer. I have used crawlers the past four years for walleye and have had good fishing. Interesting that you use the Gulp on the crappies. I will have to try that in September when I go up again.
542431,Guest,2004-08-08 18:23:00,0,"Heading up to Gullrock in a couple of weeks. Looking for people's opinions on leeches versus nightcrawlers. Am planning on getting some bait on my way up. Will also likely be trying minnows, plastics and Shad Raps. Please feel free to offer your opinion for Gullrock specifically or for Canadian fishing in general."
542439,Guest,2004-08-09 08:08:00,0,"I just returned from Gullrock. There were several times that only minnows worked and other times minnows only. It was an unusual week because of 4 mayfly hatches . Unheard of in August. Also, one member of our group had good luck with Gulp and plastics."
542441,Ia Walihntr,2004-08-09 09:21:00,320,"RonO, I wouldn't spend my money on live bait! ""Berkley Gulp"" only. In the long run, it's cheaper than live bait because it's more durable. You can use each bait over and over. Since it's not made of plastic as most other baits, (mister twister, gene larew, creme, power bait etc.) it is advertised to hold 400 times the amount of scent as plastic. I've been using it for about a year I am thoroughly convinced that it out fishes any thing that alive for any spieces of fish!! Artificals (crank baits, spinner baits, etc.) still have a place in my arsenal, but once I find fish, I switch to Gulp bait and jigs or spinners. Crappies, bluegills and perch are caught easily with the smaller Gulp products."
542446,Guest,2004-08-09 10:44:00,0,I'm going to give Gulp a try. What's favorite color?
542449,Guest,2004-08-09 11:38:00,0,Was to Lac Seul last week of July and did very well on the Berkley Gulp Smelt Minnow. Also did fair on the Berkley 4in. black Turtle Back.
542456,Ia Walihntr,2004-08-09 15:50:00,320,"Stuck Pig, With the Gulp baits, color is more the preferance for the fisherman than the fish. Most colors seem equally effective. Here is a website tho check out all the colors and different shapes. www.purefishing.com Marv"
542463,Guest,2004-08-09 19:21:00,0,Ia Walihntr--I had some of the original Berkley Powerbaits in the small splittail grubs that I've used for crappies effectively the last few years. They were the original ones before they've made them look more like plastics. Finally used my last one up earlier this summer. They worked well and I'll miss them. I'll give the new powergrubs a try. I'll probably also still use minnows and either leeches or crawlers. I'll have all week to try a few different baits and tactics. Thanks for the advice. Anyone else have thoughts on crawlers versus leeches. I've never really tried either before while fishing in Canada. I've generally used minnows or plastics and looking to try more/new things.
542464,Guest,2004-08-09 19:23:00,0,Meant to say I'll give Gulps a try.
542488,Guest,2004-08-10 16:30:00,0,"Ia Walihtr...care to share your presentation with the Gulps and the type Gulp you used. I have some in the twister tail, but haven't tried them. Thanks in advance..."
542493,Ohio fisherman,2004-08-10 21:22:00,989,"RonO - to answer your original question, I would give the nod to leeches over crawlers. Either one will work, but in my opinion, the leeches are like candy to the eyes. You may wish to check with the locals because there may be a strong local preference and it may depend upon the season and time of year. Good luck, O F"
