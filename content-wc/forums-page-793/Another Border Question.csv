542059,Guest,2004-07-26 15:10:00,0,"Sadly, one of the six in our group has a recent DUI. We usually cross the border at Pigeon River around midnight Saturday night on our way to Savant Lake for a 7:00am Sunday flight. There is no Immigration person there at that time, so we are going to try International Falls at about 3:00pm on Saturday. In the event he is not admitted, we will take him to the airport and dump him off. My question is for those of you that have crossed at International Falls this year. If you did not offer indentification at the border, were you asked to produce it for yourself and all passengers? I know some are not asked for ID, and I'm trying to get a feel for the percentages. The young offender is aware of the ""error of his ways"" and is prepared to fly home."
542060,verlund,2004-07-26 15:14:00,32,"I can only go by my recent trip, which was last week. We crossed at Intl Falls and the security person did not even look much at our ID's. I gave them to him right away (without him asking). He was more interested in bait, guns, onions, etc. He did put my license plates in to see if it returned anything back that was bad but that's about it. Again, thats only my experience so far this year. Steve"
542063,Guest,2004-07-26 17:19:00,0,"My best advice. Glasses off, hat off, dont have him drive or use his vehicle. If they ask for ID, and you have to provide your license, and they type it into their system, then ask to see the immigration officer on duty. Explain the situation honestly, tell them your destination, purpose and the reservations you already have, and be polite. If there is only 1 DUI, no matter when, they will let you through with a 200 canadian fee. We spent extensive time researching this with our group over the years, as we are over 50% with dui, and have met and talked with Immigration officials. If people tell you that they are getting turned around with only 1 dui, I would bet that they have more on their record than they say or they are a jack #### to the autorities."

542071,Guest,2004-07-26 19:32:00,0,"One of our guys had a DUI in early 2002. We crossed after that in June at Intl Fls. For whatever reason they asked for our driver's license, mostly routine, I suspect. His DUI popped up and they asked him about it. He was very honest and polite. They actually let him through with a $135A/$200C fine and some paperwork. They also gave him some more paperwork to fill out and send to the Canadian Consulate in the U.S. for any future visits. My understanding is if you are not allowed entry into Canada, you are considered 'exempt from entry'. The request is for a 'waiver of exemption'. Anyway, he didn't do that, so this year (2 years later) when we crossed again in June at Intl Fls, our vehicle license must have flagged from the last time because they asked again for our licenses, then they asked us to come inside, so we did. Inside they all but ignored us: there were about 5 agents behind the counter but they seemed to avoid the counter. They wouldn't make eye contact. They only talked among themselves. We went to the immigration counter, but the immigration lady told us to go to the counter. The counter person said to go to immigration. Then the immigration lady told us to ""go sit down until you are called."" They just seemed to be very rude and acted like they had a 'chip-on-their-shoulder'. When we were finally called, our guy was again very polite and honest. He thought he would be able to pay the $135A/$200C fine and do some more paperwork, but the woman inside at Immigration got very snotty. She said things like, ""What are you trying to pull?"" ""What have you been doing for the last 2 years?"" ""Didn't you read any of the paperwork you were given?"" Anyway, we got turned around with a warning that if he did try to enter, a warrant for his arrest would be issued. She broke the line to allow us back into the States, and watched us like a hawk until we were clearly back across the bridge and not able to sneak back or drop him off. We didn't have reservations anywhere, so we decided to just spend our couple thousand dollars plus back in Minnesota. We are now not too anxious to travel back to Canada. Not because of the fishing, not because of the people, not because we don't like and respect their fine country, we just don't want to have to put up with the BS at the border anymore."

542080,haybaylarry,2004-07-27 05:28:00,55,Immigration people on the whole are no different than most. Some have bad days like you and I. However it seems like your buddy neglected to fill out the required paper work in advance and caused grief for your whole group. If he had done the paperwork you would have been able to come to Canada and enjoy yourself. I would have a talk with him....larry
542089,Guest,2004-07-27 07:11:00,0,We fly out with West Caribou to Heathcote Lake.
542116,Guest,2004-07-27 14:41:00,0,I have crossed at Intl. Falls a few times and have never been asked for ID. I know it is luck of the draw. Just make sure you are in compliance with all other regulations and he has a good shot at getting in. Wow would it suck to be him if he has to fly back. Leave it to Canada law to cause hassles like this. Good luck!
542336,Hammerhead Herb,2004-08-03 16:21:00,259,Don't go across the border withoout your ID. Hopefully everyone on this message board knows the importance of bringing an ID.
542637,Guest,2004-08-16 07:03:00,0,"Well, our offender made it through. They went through Int'l Falls August 14 at 3:00. Were never asked for ID's but did have their gear torn down. Whole process took 35 min. My group went through Pigeon River Sunday am at 12:30. Did not ask for ID. No wait. We all came back through Pigeon Sat. Aug 14. No ID check at the US border. Asked a couple questions but that was it. Took 2 min. We flew out of Savant Lake Sunday am (8/8). Sunday was beautiful. Great fishing. Temps around 75. Sunday night temp went down to upper 30's with wind and rain through tuesday pm. Killed the fishing till late Thurs/Friday. Did get 26' and 2 at 25'. Fished for wallys but did get 2 fat 34' northerns. Haagy"
542245,bigfish1965,2004-07-30 22:26:00,3210,I would pick a different weekend. This is a long weekend in Canada and the US and Canadian border patrols are offering insane restrictions for different reasons. The US side is tightening up for the upcoming RNC and the Canadians are pulling out the rule book in an effort to get a raise in pay equal to their US counterparts. Chance of sneaking though this weekend..slim to none.
542287,bubbalou,2004-08-02 14:05:00,29,"Just came back on Saturday from a week in Nestor Falls area. We had our ID's checked for the first time ever going across the border. She asked some unusual questions this time and did look at all the ID's but never punched anything into the computer. I even had a friend of my sons' along and had no extra questions with that. I agree with guy who says, hat's off, sunglasses off, answer honestly and above all don't speak until spoken too, for some reason they don't like that."
542294,Guest,2004-08-02 18:54:00,0,"Do you know if they have a problem with youngsters who have an underage drinking ticket? my son got one this year at college, i dont think it goes on his record as long as he doesnt get in trouble for another year though. and its also a misdemeanor, so nothing serious like a DUI which i think is a felony?? any info would be helpful. thanks."
542298,bigfish1965,2004-08-02 20:03:00,3210,"They usually ask if you've ever been arrested or convicted of a crime including DUI. Here underage drinking is simply a ticket like a speeding ticket...don't know about there, but if it is similar the answer to the question posed would be 'No.'"
542300,Hammerhead Herb,2004-08-02 20:31:00,259,"BIT OF INFO: Came across the border at IF, MN on Friday at 4:30PM. US Customs/Immigration/Border Patrol just checked drivers licenses. From when I first went into the line on Canada 11 to when I left the US border check station was 38 min.; I didn't think that was too bad --- considering everything going on."
542311,Guest,2004-08-03 10:23:00,0,"Thanks for the help, i'm pretty sure its the same here as well so i dont forsee it as being a problem. if for some reason it is i will let you all know."

542320,Guest,2004-08-03 15:59:00,0,What if you go across the border without your ID and when you come back to the US they won't let you in without your ID?

542244,haybaylarry,2004-07-30 21:05:00,55,"Just another thought. I cross into the states to access my p.o. box. Whenever I cross the borderIt's never a hastle. I arrive with pasport in hand and after a few questions I'm on my way. I'm sure they punch in my license plate number. It couldn't be any easier this way. I don't have experience comming through the border to canada as a visitor but have had to go into the customs office and been checked. No big deal, they usually are friendly unless there is a problem....larry"
