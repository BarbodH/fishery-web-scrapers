512666,Guest,2001-05-20 08:40:00,0,We are fishing the Ogoki Reservoir this summer and I am told that since it is a reservoir of course it would be full of timber. Any suggestions for walleye fishing. My main concern is that I have always jig fished on the bottom and how do I fish timber without hanging up all the time? Slip bobbers and live bait? Any ideas will be appreciated.
