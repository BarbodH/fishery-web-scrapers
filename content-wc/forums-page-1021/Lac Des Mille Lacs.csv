512592,Frank from TBay,2001-05-15 11:22:00,312,OMNR is proposing changes to Lac Des Mille Lacs in NW Ontario for the 2001/2002 season. Changes can be fully looked at MOE site EBR Registry Number RB01E1001. They are synopsised as follows1) Lacs Walleye season will be the same as other NW Ontario Lakes. It is now closed on March 15. Proposed changes will keep it open to April 15.2)Fish Sanctuary in Savanne and Little Savanne River to May31.3)No Pike fishing in the closed Walleye season. There is extreme concern over overharvesting of large spawning females. This would mean no Pike fishing from April 15th to opener of Walleye on the third saturday in May.This is open to public input now to May27. Contact Person is Leona Tarini at 807 475 1472...Fax 807 475 1527 We urge any anglers who use the lake to voice their opinion.Our fish club and the other organizations who participated in the creels and active lobbying are very pleased. The lakes users as a percentage are 98% resident Ontarian in the winter. It will be great to get to fish in our own backyard again if this passes the rest of the hurdles. Good fishing
