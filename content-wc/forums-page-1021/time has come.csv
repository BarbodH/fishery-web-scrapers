Also, if we are staying at Paradise Cove is the Winnipeg river the only body of water to fish? Hope we get some replys. Happy fishing. Take care.."

512669,Guest,2001-05-21 04:27:00,0,Good luck. My dad just came back from Big Sand Lake. He said the water was pretty high at the moment. You shouldn't have any problem finding a guide up there. I would definately get one if it's you first trip on that water. Fishing can betough at times if water level and the weather aren't on your side.
