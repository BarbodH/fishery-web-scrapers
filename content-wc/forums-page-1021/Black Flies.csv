511578,Guest,2001-05-20 05:41:00,0,"In addition my 2 cents,....first I've never tried this so don't come after me if you try it and its a black fly attractant,...but in our area black flies can be bad,...one local general store has a newsletter and claims that oil of Burgamont was the only thing found effective by (I don't remember who) again haven't tried it. One I HAVE tried and been, very effective is ""Green Ban"" does NOT have DEET in it,...(BTW,..to me DEET is 100% worthless for black flies) uhhhh but so is Green Ban,...Green Ban is great for mosquitos/deerfly/and horseflies,....I feel not so good if I put DEET on my skin,..can't explain it,...but 100% DEET is considered less effective than 20% DEET by most tests,...the advantage of the lower % is they can ettach extenders so thatr it doesn't evaporate in 15 minutes like the 100% does,...back to the Green Ban,..made from tree oils,..supposed to be totally non-toxic,..smells like lab soap,...Doesn't evaporate,...only a few applications a day works for me,..another great repelant is something a herbalist makes locally,..my wife likes it better,..smells like lemon,..can be ordered from ""the Herbarium"" in Chicopee Ma,...I think it cost about 11 bucks a bottle and that should last a couple a people a season,..same thing,..works for most bugs,..(she says even ticks) but I'm not sure it effects black flies,....if you are like me,..if I'm in a swarm of these bugs,..I just might pay my life's savings to get some peace,........"
511562,Guest,2001-03-20 07:16:00,0,"I'll be going up to Lake Kipawa with a group the second week of June and am seeking some insights on black flies and biting bugs in general. I have been advised that the ""hatch"" and worst time of the year for black flies depends on the spring weather, but still am wondering what is typical for this time period at this latitude. I've also been warned that the second week in June could be pretty bad for both black flies and mosquitos around this area. Pease share any information or suggestions that could make our trip as compfortable as possible if the black flies are, in fact, dense during that week. Repellant recommendations? Clothing / Gear suggestions? Diet suggestions (ie: garlic)? I'm traveling with a few older guys (72 and 75) that aren't into ""toughing it out"" anymore and a Canada Trip ""first timer"", my 11-year old nephew. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
511563,Guest,2001-03-20 08:14:00,0,The best springs for lack of bugs is a fast melt in the spring. The first mosquitos are the snow melt guys. If there is no moisture they cannot thrive.This year we have had a lot of moisture in the bush.The thaw is also going very slowly. My experience tells me it is going to be a bad bug year. Bugs come in waves. They hatch and it takes a while for the dragonflys and bats and birds to catch up. If you hit it right you might not get it too bad. Get a good bug jacket and head screen. The other thing is a bug tent to sit outside in. Camping in a breezy area if possible is also good. For young kids we weigh them down with stuff in their pockets. Sometimes four or five big mosquitos can carry a young one off. The extra weight helps.
511564,RANGER,2001-03-20 08:49:00,4341,"T-BONE,My disclaimer: THIS IS WHAT WE DO. RIGHT OR WRONG.I will try to do my best for you because I had gotten caught twice when the Black flies were hatching AND the mosquitos. It can seriously ruin your week. I refuse to have that happen ever again, SOOOOOO...this is what I/WE do:1) First, foremost and ALWAYS.....go to campmor.com. It is a sight for campers and hikers. Order a set of the no-see-em netting material sold as head and arm/hand coverings made for this purpose. 1 set each for each person and 1 spare. If nothing else get the stuff to cover your head and neck, you can wear gloves on your hands. This is the most important advice I can give you because, for Black flies, repellants are not a sure bet. The first time it happened to us we sprayed ourselves left and right and it hardly made a difference! I then rubbed pure motor oil on my arms AND THEY BIT THROUGH THAT! Nasty little bas..........!I, also, have the mosquito netting and rigging to arrange it over your bed/sleeping area. Often it is too hot inside the cabin to close it all up at night. This will give you a nights' peace.Bring bath towels or similar articles and keep them in your boat. You'll need them to wrap around your ankles when sitting in the boat. Those buggers find the thinist material and bite through THAT and your socks are easier to bite through than are your jeans.2) For the mosquitos and Deer flies Vitamin B-1 in a 250mg single tablet, RDA around 2500%. A lot of folks bulk at this but we have never had any ill effects from it. Take it for a week before you go and each day while there. You'll notice a change in your urine, it will be more yellow and has a distinct odor (B-1 odor). This is normal. Don't skip any days, take it with your coffee in the morning after having set it out the night before.One of my friends is allergic to the Deer fly bites and suffered while there. I had him take the B-1 and they left him alone.3) Deep Woods Off in spray, lots of it.4) Suphenepherine (sp?) tablets. This is the active ingredient in Sudafed and similar anti-histamines. This is sold separately and is a small tablet, around 10mg. This is for anyone that does get bit and has a reaction to the bite.If you blow everything off I wrote here, at least get the netting. It will SAVE your trip if the Black flies are hatching.I wish you well.RANGER""KEEP YOUR LINES WET, YOUR POWDER DRY and THE BEER COLD"""
511565,Guest,2001-03-20 13:22:00,0,"DON'T FORGET YOUR DUCTTAPE, FOR YOUR ANKLES AND CUFFS. MUSKOL WITH 100%DEET. IT'S STILL AVAILABLE . HEAD NET, AND NETTING FOR YOUR BED. THE DEER FLYS ARE WORST THAN THE BLACK FLYS.GOOD FISHING."
511566,ggg,2001-03-20 17:59:00,115,"I have found that black flies love light colors over dark colors.Black socks are better than white, but the best is gortex. Theycan't bite thru that stuff. A light weight gortex rain suitwith gortex socks and a netting for your head and your all set.Don't forget your gortex gloves ! I bowhunt in this stuff inmillions of mosquitoes and never get bit. It also breathespretty good so you don't get too hot."
511567,Guest,2001-03-20 18:50:00,0,Move your date to July or August. Mid June is the worst time of the year at Kipawa. Whatever the cost it will be well worth it to change your date.
511569,River_eye,2001-03-21 14:27:00,1486,"Okay, well, you heard from everybody else on the subject of bugs, now I'll give you a different viewpoint. I work as a guide at a fishing resort, which means that I live with these little pests for the whole season. They really aren't that bad. The mosquitos are worse during the evening, and the blackflies are worse during the day. I never use anything other than a bit of repellant, and somtimes not even this. Most of the bug problem is in your head, and after you get bitten a few times, your body gets used to the sting and doesn't react as bad.River eye"
511570,BGunn,2001-03-25 01:53:00,880,"We always use BEN'S 100% DEET for repellent, and don't forget to bring allot of those mosquitoe coils that you light for inside the cabin. With these two products we never had any problem, when on spring bear hunts, or fishing trips.Any product with 100% deet is good for up there, but I wouldn't over use it (at home) because of the health warnings. The duct tape is also a very good idea for use around cuffs."
511571,Guest,2001-03-25 16:01:00,0,all the guys who live in the James Bay region (big mosquito area) swear by Amway bug spray.
511574,Guest,2001-03-29 04:37:00,0,"Stay away from anything that has an artificial odor to it, with the exception of repellent. No perfumed soaps, shampoo, deodorant...etc. You won't be the best-smelling guy on the lake, but you won't get bit either."
