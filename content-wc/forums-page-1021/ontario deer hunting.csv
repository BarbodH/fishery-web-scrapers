512637,Guest,2001-05-17 15:01:00,0,i.m thinking of a guided deer hunt near LOW and on islands in lake. any info. even tho this isn't fishing related. thank you.
512638,Hunter,2001-05-17 20:14:00,346,"Are you sure you want a guided ontario deer hunt. There are better places to hunt deer. Im not saying there arent good deer here, they are fantastic in antler and body size. There are just better places to go. Deer are few and far between, you will not see 10-20 deer like you do in some states. Try a moose hunt in Ontario nothing gets you as excited as a 1000# animal. And if you really want deer, look into Manitoulin island for deer, I visit here every summer on 600 acres private land and you see monsters in velvet every year. I believe a guided hunt is about $1000 canadian for a week on this island and ive heard as little as $400 on the reserve."
512639,Guest,2001-05-18 04:20:00,0,hunter thanks for reply. wher are you talking about? I'm looking for something different this year. i've hunted B.C. Sask. and most western states. I read that that area i was talking about had big deer and good numbers. thank you.
512640,Hunter,2001-05-18 05:56:00,346,"There are big deer, dont get me wrong, but there isnt the numbers like some states have. My uncle hunts a couple hundred miles from L.O.W. for the last 40+ yrs. Sure you see deer and some big brutes, but you may see a total of 5 for the week, and thats total deer,with hired guides and dogs. Manitoulin island is in Lake Huron East of the U.P. It is all private land and I believe about 5000 hunters for the week, with about 30,000 animals on the island. I am not allowed to hunt the place we stay in the summer, it is leased for the last 20+yrs unfortunately. I have seen pictures and some sheds, and this is THE PLACE in ontario for an honest 140+ they are just big deer. I will post a website of a lodge that offers hunts in this area, I know nothing about them, but maybe you can get some info. By the way You can shoot the red wolves, ive seen a few."

512642,Frank from TBay,2001-05-19 16:46:00,312,Fort Frances area is famous for its big bucks and its hospitality. If memory serves me right there are 640 acres in a square mile. There are a lot of big guys shot out of there every year.
