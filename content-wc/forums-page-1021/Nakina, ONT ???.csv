512604,Guest,2001-05-16 08:44:00,0,"I'm going on fly-in this spring not to Nakina but I've done lots of research lately. I sound like a stupid Holiday Inn commercial.Besides going ridiculously far away and paying $2000.00 a week. its agreed that Nakina as a region offers the best fly-in fishing in Ontario.I'm not intimately familiar with the various outfitters but check out Bill River's lodge finder. Just search yahoo.com under ""Bill Rivers"" Its a nice resource. I also read every issue of Ontario Out of Doors magazine and over the years the words Nakina and nice fish have come up quite a bit. Just in case you're wondering why I'm not headed up there myself, I only have three days off work for fishing this spring and the lengthy drive from Toronto will eat into my fishing time.By the way Nakina is located north of Lake Superior.Good luck.

Pike to 25-??.Numbers of 1-4 lb. walleye and as many pike(5-15lb.) as you can reel in.Try a search for Luenenbergers Air Serv.(807)329-5940,well established outfitter.Also Nakina Air Serv.(807)329-5341.Also try a search for North of Superior tourism as there are too many outfitters to name."

I book for a couple lakes out of Winnipeg that are much better fishing than the Nakina area and much cheaper. Especially the outposts.Have fished with Liddles on Makokibatan Lake out of Nakina. Not bad fishing. I think they sold the lodge to a relative. Nice thing is that you can trout fish up on the river.TQO"
