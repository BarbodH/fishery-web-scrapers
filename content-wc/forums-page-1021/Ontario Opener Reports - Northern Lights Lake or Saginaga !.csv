I was just looking for a quick report on the water temperature, how the bite was for walleyes (or in general), any quick tips of what the anglers learned based on recent conditions.A couple other brief questions to stir up conversation and messages. 1) Tips on fishing for Lake Trout. 2) When utilizing night crawlers ... is your preference to use the entire crawler or just a portion ? 3) Best live bait to use in Early June for walleyes in Southern Ontario (specifically Saginaga and/or Northern Lights Lake)."
