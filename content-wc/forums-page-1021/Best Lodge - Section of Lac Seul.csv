512644,Byron,2001-05-18 18:05:00,42,"I've stayed at Fishermans cove in South Bay 3 times and will be there again on June 22nd. Good accomadations, nothing fancy, but affordable. We go in a party of 9 to 12, and It costs about $750.00 each. This includes gasoline from Oklahoma and back, a nights lodging up and back, food for the entire 10 days (we provide cook our own meals at camp), 16 - 17 ft Lund type boats with 40 hp engines, cleaning station, ice, etc.The e address is < [email protected] >, as you can tell by the ""Canada Eh"" thread, there is a lot of good fishing in the area. Check it out and good luck at Cat River."
