It has been very wet here for the past 5 days and when I drained my boat yesterday, it took 10 minutes to empty it when I pulled the plug. There is very little chance in this area of any wildfires at the moment. Everything is saturated with water."

Cold, rain, sleet and sunshine and it changed between each one about every 30 minutes but the fishing was very good with more numbers of large eyes than we've seen in the dozen trips I've made there in the last 6 years. Water levels don't seem to be affected by the dry weather like LacSuel and with the recent rain fire shouldn't be an issue. Sounds like this week will be more of the same.....weather wise that is."
