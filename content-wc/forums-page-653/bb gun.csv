565615,Guest,2007-05-27 10:54:00,0,I am leaving tomorrow and my 12 year old son wants to take his bb gun. It is a low powered daisy gun not a pump or pellet gun. Does this present a problem at the border. If anyone knows I would appreciate an answer or if someone knows the phone number I could call and ask. We will be crossing at fort frances. thanks eric macdonald

Take him fishing, have him clean camp, teach him poker and let him win $5. The BB gun won't even be on his mind.... Travel safe, tight lines."
