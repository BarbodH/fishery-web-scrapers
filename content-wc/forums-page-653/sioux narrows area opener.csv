565670,wiggle,2007-05-29 11:15:00,400,"Just got back from Sioux Narrows last night(5/28). The water level is down approx 5-6'. The weather was quite cool, rainy and windy. Water temps were approx 55degrees out in the open and 56-60degrees in the shallower bays. I had a tough time finding any walleyes in my regular spots in Lobstick bay. Had to go out to Yellow Girl area to catch em'. 30-35FOW is the only place I found any concentration. The bass are not on beds yet. The northern pike fishing was unusually slow as well. I'm sure the water level and the weather are all playing a part in the tough fishing. Brad"
