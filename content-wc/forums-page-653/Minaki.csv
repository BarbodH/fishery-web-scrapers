The water temp is 57 in Lost Lake and 52 on the main river when I called the lodge and talked to the group that started fishing yesterday. They are catching some good walleye, pike and smallmouth. The pike and smallmouth are being caught on count down rapalas. I will post a report when I get back. Anyone with any fishing reports please post them. Hope everyone has a great time up there this year, Don"

Fished all over in the very base of big & little sand. No one spot held a lot of fish, but again was able to scratch a few here and there. The weekend before we fished around the bridge and area and did ok. I've seen a lot better spring fishing, but I think with little to no current the fish are not holding in the clasic spots in large numbers. I'm hoping by next weekend, and maybe better conditions the numbers will be there. Spinner and minnow did take a share of fish to. By watching a lot of the boats move around a lot I take it they were finding conditions the same. The biggest we landed was 25.5"" Good luck"

Looking forward to getting some walleye, and especially a lot of smallmouth, if they will cooperate and move shallower to their prespawn positions. Don"
