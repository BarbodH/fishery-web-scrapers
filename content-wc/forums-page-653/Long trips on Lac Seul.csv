We caught lots of fish by never going any farther than Lunker Pt. and actually caught most fish around islands/reefs closer than that. However, we noticed almost everybody else was heading towards Steamboat Narrows and we're wondering if the fishing is even better for size or quantity going that far out?(We had 100+ fish days but most were 14-16"" with maybe 8-10 per day over 20"") It's hard for us to think the fishing could be better than what we experienced but it was our first time so maybe it does get better? Any thoughts? Thanks !!"

It is all good, but we have had our best luck for size with the numbers in this area. There are alot less camps in this area, but it is where we have made our home on Lac Seul. We stay at Lost Island Lodge, but there are other camps in the area as well."
565646,Jigger1,2007-05-28 19:08:00,234,"Mickey - Lac Seul is an awesome and expansive fishery, like Super we fish a different part of the lake, central for us at Silver Water Wheel Lodge and I spend the majority of my time hunting hogs. I've been in spots where you can literally catch one 15-18 inch walleye after another, but we usually move on as I'm still searching to break the 30 inch barrier and most big fish don't travel with the little guys. Even with this being said, my average is around 20 walleyes/day over 18"" with 50% of them exceeding 21 inches and 25% of them exceeding 24"". I can't tell you how many under 18 as we don't keep track of those, but I know it's a lot. Read some of the previous posts by folks like NWO Fishing Bum. He's a former guide and writes some great stuff about techniques used daily on Lac Seul. Mike Willems the owner of the lodge we stay at has some great articles on his web site about Lac Seul, big walleyes and where to find them. And just so I'm not overly SWWL biased which I am, read past and future posts from Gary at Evergreen Lodge which is over by Ear Falls. They consistently catch and release big eyes as well. A good lodge should be able to put you on the fish, a good guide from a good lodge will do it every day. Good luck - only 30 days until we're slaying them again!"

We notice a lot of people that go up the english river, but we dont. he have out best luck within 30 minutes of camp with a 30hp motor. so we don't go that far! We hit some sandy flats the time of year we are there. we also like points next to flats as well as other post spawn locations. Most of our fish are caught in 6 to 12 ft of water this time of year. As far as size and numbers we notice that the size of fish is getting better each year and the numbers are staying the same. The result is an amazing trip!"

Each year after we ventured out a little farther and found new spots. Now I have the choice of whether I want to fish close or a long ways out. The fishing is about the same but the scenery might be a little different. It just depends also whether I want to see another boat during the day. The journey is sometimes more fun than the catching, but catching is fun too. Get a good map and a compass. Give the map to your wife or navigator and you keep the compass. It's an adventure. Enjoy."
565674,wooglin,2007-05-29 12:12:00,371,"Mickey1 - my group is actually staying at Gold Pines this year. What did you think of the facilities? How were the campsites? Do you recall if they have a nice fish-cleaning station and communal freezer? What time of year were you there? I've been lucky to be in touch with a few folks who are familiar with that area who've actually shared maps with me. To my dismay, most of the spots they recommend are prior to Steamboat Narrows or shortly after it. As for our prior experiences, we typically fished out of Hudson. We always put on tons of miles every day, I'd say about 25 on average per day. We're go getters though, we'd hear about 'the fishing is so much better 1 hour north', so we'd go there. This year is a new spot, so I'm sure as the week goes on, we'll go further and further out."
565678,Guest,2007-05-29 13:55:00,0,"Our group will be at lac seul resort next week also. We've been staying there for 10 years now and agree that very good fishing can be found without the time consuming trip up to the big lake. What have you heard about the lake level? I know lac seul is way down....I've heard 5 to 6 feet. If that's the case, landing the boats in the lac seul resort marina could be a problem."
565687,onemorecast,2007-05-29 19:16:00,23,"The only advice on long trips, the lake is low so be careful if you don't know where you are going"
565689,Guest,2007-05-29 20:16:00,0,"The only cabin available for us was actually a duplex which had 3 beds, a small kitchen(with only 1 outlet) and bathroom. There are much nicer cabins on the property but they are rebooked year after year I was told by the owners. Yes they have a fish cleaning house(maybe 2) and a community freezer by the main lodge. The owners are very friendly and willing to help you with anything you need. Although the cabin we had needs updating(and a couple more electrical sockets) the fishing was what we were up there for and despite strong winds and our inexperience on LS we caught LOTS of fish. We were there in August."
