565663,wooglin,2007-05-29 08:55:00,371,Can anyone tell me the best place to Musky fish this side of the lake? Our crew is staying at Gold Pines camp and one of our boats wants to spend a day musky fishing. We're willing to go 30+ miles if needed to get to good waters.... Thanks.
565664,Guest,2007-05-29 09:05:00,0,A little farther than 30 miles but the indian chain of lakes is suppose to be awesome for musky. more like 70-80 miles maybe. we use to stay on that chain but would drive to ear falls to visit friends and do a fly out for a day. worth the drive.
565665,wooglin,2007-05-29 09:32:00,371,How about on Lac Seul? Looking to keep the boat in the water....

I will second the Indian Chain. It will be between you and Vermillion Bay. There are decent musky in that lake in terms of size (40's), however, it is more of a numbers lake from what I have heard, so the average fish is in the mid 30's. Cedar lake also has a good population of muskies."
