565131,Guest,2007-05-10 07:39:00,0,"I just drove from on I-39 from I-88 to Rockford and there was a little construction, but nothing big. Have not been north of Rockford in a few months but I think the toll plaza at Loves Park / I-90 and 173 (just before Wisconsin border) is under construction and it was not that bad. Drive outside of rush hour and you should be fine."

565671,north_alabama,2007-05-29 11:32:00,172,"Any new updates on travel through Illinois, big delays, etc.? I'll be coming up I-24 to I-57 to I-74 to I-55 to I-39 up to Rockford later in the week."
565681,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-05-29 15:32:00,80,"Hey Alabama, Joe here in Rockford. Looks pretty good for the most part up here. Maybe a slight delay on I-90. They're putting in an interchange on the north side of Rockford at Illinois 173. Good luck on your trip. I'm heading up June 8th, so probably won't get to talk to you for a couple weeks. Joe"
565690,Skylane,2007-05-29 20:41:00,101,We came up from South of Champaign about two weeks ago and there was nothing major going on at that time. Hope it is just as good heading South.
565692,Guest,2007-05-29 21:23:00,0,"Hey Joe, Actually, I'm stopping over in Rockford, and we'll be heading up the back roads and pick up I-90 near Beloit, so no worries about the tollway. We're heading up to Canada on the 5th. Good luck on your trip, too."
565699,Grappler,2007-05-30 08:27:00,47,"Just came back from Charleston, IL and no construction/delays on 57, 74, or 39. Good Luck on your trip. We leave in 41 hours, and 32 minutes"
