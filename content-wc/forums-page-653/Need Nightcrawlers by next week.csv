565533,bigbuckpdc,2007-05-23 19:45:00,1,Is there a reliable website to get a flat of nightcrawlers in 6 days or should I just go to Walmart and get a bunch of 2 dozen containers?

565580,Guest,2007-05-24 20:37:00,0,hi a few suggestions- cabelas and bass pro both sell bulk crawlers in the catalog- also look in the phone book and call some of the local bait shops all buy crawlers in 500per flats and will sell them in bulk also - if you are crossing at 1000's ilands the bai shop there sells them im bulk
565581,joeman79,2007-05-24 21:55:00,417,wonderin what the price of a flat of crawlers costs in Ft. Frances? Thats where we are flying out of. Anyone have a estimate an also what a pound of leeches might cost. This knowing full well that Gulp -powerbait and good ole twister tails is all I guy really needs. 68 days seems like a long time. wishing everyone a great summer Joe
