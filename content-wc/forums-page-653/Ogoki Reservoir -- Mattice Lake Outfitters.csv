565582,Guest,2007-05-24 22:13:00,0,We fly out on the 15th W.E.
565587,jigman 2003,2007-05-25 07:03:00,981,"Hey Wisconeye-you're back at Ogoki this year, right? Let me know how you do and what the water level was like. Also let me know how many jigs, tails, and cranks you donate ;-) I plan to be back at Ogoki in the next few years. First, I want to hit a couple more of MLO's single cabin lakes. Of course, I may get spoiled at Sumach Lake this year with Excellent Adventures. A flush toilet in the bush, what will they think of next?"
565635,Wisconeye,2007-05-28 11:46:00,79,"Yep, we're going back in on the 15th. A group of eight so it should be a great time, weather and water permitting. Going today to buy my skeeter spray, GULP, and probably will find something else I need. I'll be sure and let you know but my guess is the water is low there as well. WalleyeEater, if you have any questions be sure and send me a message and I'll try to help you out---looks like we'll be in there the same time."
565636,JackSalmon,2007-05-28 12:21:00,169,"Wisconeye: As you know, I'll be coming in the week after you guys ---what specific bug spray do you use? Thanks, Tim"
565640,Wisconeye,2007-05-28 15:16:00,79,REPEL pump spray 100% deet. Not on directly on skin but on clothes.
565657,jigman 2003,2007-05-29 06:09:00,981,"Hey, just heard from Ogoki (Keith) that John the camp attendant won't be at Ogoki this year. Don't know if someone else will be there or not. Just an FYI for you guys going."
563301,Guest,2007-02-10 16:11:00,0,"My fishing partner and I are strongly considering fishing Kagianacami Lake with Mattice. Have you fished it or know of its reputuation? We are Laker and walleye fishermen from Eau Claire. Thanks, Noel Ness"
563304,Stauff,2007-02-10 19:13:00,110,Bring plenty of jigs & twister tails. The Ogoki is what hooked me on walleye AND Canada fishing years ago. It's a trip that will be remembered forever. Stauff
563317,jigman 2003,2007-02-12 06:30:00,981,"Yep, LOTS of jigs and twister tails. Great spot, but you will ""donate"" plenty of hardware. Last year we each went through over 100 jigs and probably twice that many tails. It's worth it."

565497,Guest,2007-05-21 19:03:00,0,"Going to Ogoki with Mattice this June. Any ideas as far as baits, locations to fish? Anyone ever bring minnows on the fly in plane? Thanks, WE"
565503,bamawallie,2007-05-22 02:03:00,54,Just do what has been recommended....lots of jigs and twister tails. You won't be needing minnows on Ogoki unless you just want them to have their first plane ride.
565506,Stauff,2007-05-22 11:57:00,110,"Toward the end of one week we were there, we were running out of jigs, so we started trolling cheap bass crank baits ( that's all we had left!). There's a major point south of the camp coming off of the west shore. It's a ""must do"" spot in the evenings. The fish come up out of the main channel and locate south of that point. We would troll from the flats area south of the point (10 - 12') across the point which would put us in 5 to 7 FOW. Our largest pike (44"")came off this point on a chrome & black Big O crank. Steel leaders recommended if you're going to do the trolling thing. Take some crankbaits, and plan on donating a few. It was a great diversion for us. Stauff"
565534,JackSalmon,2007-05-23 20:26:00,169,"I want to thank everyone for all the help and advice, etc about our upcoming trip. We should be on Ogoki one month from today --- we are really excited about this trip. Again, thanks for all the help!"
565544,jigman 2003,2007-05-24 07:28:00,981,"Walleye Eater - You don't need minnows at Ogoki. However, if you want them John the camp attendant traps minnows right there. You can get them from him. No need to fly them in. Seriously, take LOTS of jigs. We each went through over 100 last year. Enjoy yourself, Ogoki is a great place. Don't get ""stuck"" fishing one spot. Fish at least one new spot each day, you'll be suprised at what you can do on that body of water."
565571,Wisconeye,2007-05-24 17:45:00,79,Walleye Eater...What week in June are you going?
556097,JackSalmon,2006-04-09 10:57:00,169,"I posted back some time ago that my son will be graduating from High School in May of 2007. He wants a Canadian fly-in trip for a graduation present, and dad is only too happy to accomodate him. I have been looking for places to go, and I have been looking very closely at the Ogoki Reservoir, with Mattice Lake Outfitters. I was just curious if anyone else has gone there with them and I would appreciate any comments. Feel free to email me at [email protected] Thanks!"

556293,jigman 2003,2006-04-18 08:21:00,981,"Jack, just sent an email. I'd be happy to discuss Ogoki with you. Email me back at [email protected] or just post your questions here. You can't go wrong by picking Mattice Lake for your outfitter."
556306,Whopper,2006-04-18 12:59:00,340,"Jack can't help with Mattice, but if that doesn't work out for ya there another outfitter near Mattice that goes to the same river system one lake upstream (WhieClay)and another downstream (Mojikit) from Ogoki and their name is Armstrong Outpost and Air. Kelly and Maureen run very good packages and are great host. There website is www.armstrongoutpost.com Whopper"
556354,jigman 2003,2006-04-20 08:45:00,981,"Hey Jack, my home computer is cooked as of last night. Don't know when it will be back up and running. If you'd like to ask me some questions about Ogoki and Mattice Lake Outfitters, I guess you'll need to do it here."
556389,Wisconeye,2006-04-21 15:55:00,79,"Jack: I've also been to Ogoki with MLO several times. You'll have no regrets. If there are any specific questions you might have send me a message. Don't be afraid to write to Jigman either, he'll have some great tips as well."
556428,JackSalmon,2006-04-24 10:59:00,169,"Thanks for all the emails and replies. We have decided on MLO and Ogoki Reservoir and are in the process of making the reservations now. We are looking forward to this trip. Again, Thanks!"
556433,jigman 2003,2006-04-24 12:00:00,981,Enjoy yourselves. You picked a great location and a great outfitter.
