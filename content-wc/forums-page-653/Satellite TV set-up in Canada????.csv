565684,Guest,2007-05-29 16:21:00,0,"I take our direct antenna with us to Canada all the time. It is 24"" folds about 4"" when closed and has handle. I take our 2nd receiver from shop and it works fine. There are several ""birds"" very close together, so take your time. Get your azmuth and degree number before you go, or type in the long/lat to your direct setup walk thru. This is sopposed to be a vacation, have fun, enjoy. If you want to be Jeremia Johnson and be a mountian man more power to ya, enjoy."
565510,Guest,2007-05-22 16:43:00,0,"I know going to Canada is about getting away from TV, phones, etc but I am trying to get my father to go with us and due to health issues he cannot fish hard all day long. I was thinking that is we could get Direct TV access up there this would help him pass the time while we were out fishing. My brother-in-law has the service although we would have to buy a second receiver and dish-- We are willing to pay if somewhat reasonable. The cabins have power but I am not sure what is would take to make this work-- anyone out there have experience in mobile Sat TV set-ups? Is this plan feasible? I would appreciate any feedback. With only so many fishing trips in life I think it is important to spend them with your family as much as possible. Thanks Chad"
565511,Guest,2007-05-22 17:11:00,0,"call directv, we just had a similar discussion and i believe there is a mobile unit available.not sure of cost though.10 days til lotw. just polished my tackle box.(among other things)and it is looking good.jig oouuut!!!"
565512,Guest,2007-05-22 17:36:00,0,Your direct tv will work up here depending on how far north you go . The cutoff seems to be around edmonton / prince albert out west here if you get much farther north they won't get full reception and you will loose channels. I used to have direct tv and had coworkers that ran them in the oilfield up here in can. and that was as far north as we could get them to work.
565514,Jesse-WI,2007-05-22 20:29:00,534,We were up in Ear Falls area last year and a group did this very thing at the lodge. They had a dish mounted on a small tripod just a couple feet high. They had a rather long cable running from the tripod to their cabin.
565518,Guest,2007-05-23 06:36:00,0,"Screw the dish to a 4'square piece of ply wood point it towards the south west weigh the plywood down with a few rocks and your golden.. all you need to do is fiddle with the dish to get it pointed. watch tv, enjoy. Gerritt."

If you have a problem with setup or reception, their 800 # won't take calls from out of the US phones. So, be sure and set up and test before leaving the US. Have been using DishNet in Canada for last 5 years and it works great. But, we don't get our local network station reception. Could order National networks if you want them. Planocat"
565546,Guest,2007-05-24 08:51:00,0,just bring a tv and a dvd player and plenty of movies. We do that for some of the kids every year and they love it at night we are allplaying cards. pop in a movie and they will leave ya alone. Kind of pain to bring a tv and dvd player but I think our group agrees it is worth the time and effort.

565559,Guest,2007-05-24 12:09:00,0,HI. Its seems like all the resorts we have been to have some kind of satelite tv already set up somewhere in the lodge and possible tv in the cabins too. check with the lodge owner about that. he might have to sit in the lodge to watch it. I seems the private homes we saw with a little dish had it pointed nearly horizontal to get the signal.
565567,Rat,2007-05-24 15:44:00,102,"You must be kidding. You are on your way to the closest thing to heaven and you want to watch tv? Do your whole party a favor and ""accidentally"" drop the whole works in the lake. They will all be happy about once they get over the initial withdrawal."
