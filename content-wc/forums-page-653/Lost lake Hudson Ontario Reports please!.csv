Can you get past the bridge in Webster bay? Any info would be great. We have been fishing the lake for 20 some years, but it is always good to get some info before we go!"
565679,Guest,2007-05-29 14:00:00,0,I have exactly the same question. John at lac seul resort hasn't or won't respond to my question either. It would be great to hear from someone who just returned.

Try giving Lost Island Lodge(807)582-3366 a call, they are really helpful and would be able to answer your question even though you are at the other camp."
