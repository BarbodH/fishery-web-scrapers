First day I rolled out of bed and rolled right back in...Mid afternoon I braved the cold with full winter gear, gloves and tuque in hand. The wind started to die down a little and the sun broke through the clouds. I headed towards East Bay, as I crossed post Narrow I must have counted 20 boats hiding from the wind I guess. When I arrived at the mouth of walleye heaven, I casted into 10 feet of hungry sters. Monsters that is. Monster Walleye.... Within the hour my partner and I pulled up breakfast, lunch and supper.... one 6 pounder and a couple of 5 pounders made the list of fatties caught that hour... Cold but a great opener... Eating Walleye for breakfast in about five minutes... May the Walleyes be with you........ If you catch the big ones, name them, release them and they'll always come back a little bit bigger...
