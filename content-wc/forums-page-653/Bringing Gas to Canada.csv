My boat tank holds 40 and the kicker holds 6 and of course the explorer gets filled to. thats is for me. there is some web site that tells you what you are allowed and i think that is generally what the tanks in your boat will hold. you might get away with another gerry can or 2 but it could be asking for trouble. I saw one guy once had gerry cans all over and they had him pulled over at the border for some reason, i dont know if it was the gas or not. its like anything else its whats reasonable. you dont want to be a rolling bomb. good luck."

What's the cost of gasoline in your area of the USA right now anyway? Today's price in Ottawa, Ontario is $1.05 CDN per litre which converts to $3.66 US per US gallon. If there is some concern about whether there will be any open gas stations along your route, an internet search should be able to resolve that issue."

One important point about bringing in gas from the US is the inflated price often charged by the resorts. Last year we spent US$100 on gas for the boat for one week, for a boat with a 50 hp engine that does not use all that much gas. I guess we could haul gas in cans back and forth from town, 12 miles away. I am sure the resort owner would have a conniption if we did so. I suppose the gouging factor is similar at US resorts."

Rather than transporting a whole bunch of gasoline over hundreds of miles or more (safety issues as well as extra weight), I'd recommend buying gasoline in a town close to the final destination. Although I don't have enough data to characterize what resorts charge for gasoline as gouging, my experience is that they do seem to charge enough to make money on gas after their expenses of buying it and hauling it in. No doubt some exploit this situation. Our group has a one week walleye trip in a couple of months at a location about 9 hours driving time from home. We'll be using the outfitters boats but using our own motors and supplying our own gas. We'll be filling our gas tanks in the last village before our arrival at the outfitters location. In any correspondence over the winter months, there hasn't been a hint of unhappiness from our outfitter regarding our arrangements with him."
