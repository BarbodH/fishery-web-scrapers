While I have been lucky enough to catch trophy-size fish, I have found that the true trophies from these trips are the great memories I share with family and good friends. Thank you to my wife Kay and daughter Jenny for expressing love by sharing in many of my fishing experiences. Thank you to good friends Steve, Paul, John, Chad, and Rob for the unique friendship that is strengthened by our shared Canadian adventures. My Dad started me fishing at age 5. At age 12 I graduated to Minnesota. Later we shared in our first Canadian fishing trips together. Though Dad was no longer able to participate in these trips in recent years, he was always the one most excited to hear from me about our trips north. He passed away this January. I know that next week as I catch walleyes in northern Alberta I will think of many things that I will want to tell him. It will have to wait until I see him in an even better place. Thank you Dad for the patience and love you showed me. Thank you for taking me fishing. I miss you Dad."
