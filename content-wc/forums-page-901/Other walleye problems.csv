Can it sustain this reputation? Maybe. Maybe not.Consider that the total walleye harvest in the Bay of Quinte for 2000 was 121,000 walleye (Ontario MNR data). Recreational fishermen harvested 32,000 walleye (26%). Legal commercial fishing netted another 3,500 walleye (3%). Aboriginals harvested 85,000 walleye (70%) either through spear fishing or through gill netting during the spring spawn. MNR biologists proposed a 3 year moratorium to ensure that walleye breeding stock returned to more sustainable numbers. In the end, the only action the Government took was to implement a reduced daily limit and a slot limit for recreational fishers (maximum size limit of 19 inches for recreational fishing and anglers were allowed one trophy walleye over 25 inches).MNR harvest studies for 2001, scheduled for release in Mar 2002, were finally released 7 Feb 2003. Preliminary examination of these harvest numbers indicates that, on a biomass basis, recreational fishers harvested approximately 11% of the total annual walleye biomass while commercial operations took approximately 4%. The Aboriginal gillnet fishery and spearing during the spring spawn accounted for the remainder.There can be no longlasting solution, mutually acceptable to all stakeholders, without harmonizing Aboriginal fishing rights with 2003 realities and developing official definitions for and limits on Aboriginal fishing for food, social and ceremonial purposes. Slavishly adhering to treaty rights negotiated in 1763 isn't a realistic or acceptable solution. Distinctive recognition of the rights of some individuals over the rights of others, is beyond comprehension and differential treatment violates human dignities and freedoms."

Tourism is very important, probably overall way more important then netting dollars. Let the netters have lakes that are for commercial purposes only, and keep the netters off of the sportfishing lakes. One of these days, we won't be buying anymore walleye in the stores. Or if so, it will be $20.00 per pound. Mixing the netters with the sportfishing even on a controlled basis never has worked. It only makes great fisheries mediocre. There are enough lakes in Ontario for both interests. The netting lakes should not have any commercial lodge facilities on them."
