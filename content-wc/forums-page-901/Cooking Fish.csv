527043,Todd_NE,2003-02-13 13:43:00,1330,"I have some friends who are ""gourmet"" cooks and they made some fantastic fresh walleye I caught last yearThey egg washed the fillets and applied ground candied pecans for the crust and then grilled the walleye. The nutty sweet flavor enhanced the sweetness of the fish.ToddYup, got her... feel that head shake!"
527039,Guest,2003-02-14 21:21:00,0,"Agree. next time try this. In a cast iron skillet,saute fresh thinly sliced garlic in a nice amount of butter( not margarine) cut walleye fillets into bite size pieces. Once garlic is soft, add justa lil water and then throw in your fish. Steam and saute and keep it moving so it does not stick. Season to your taste or eat just like that. I will never eat walleye any other way. This really brings out the taste"
527032,Guest,2003-02-02 08:58:00,0,My favorite way is to cut fillets into bit size pieces (some might require two bytes) so I can eat them with my fingers. I put shore lunch in a zip lock bag and put the pieces in the bag and shake it to get them evenly coated. I then deep fry them in 400 degree oil until golden brown.
527033,retire55,2003-02-02 11:03:00,1029,"To all:Your recipes all sound interesting and provide excellent stimulation to plan the next trip.However, at least for cooking walleye, I prefer to use a cooking method that doesn't hide the very sweet taste of fresh walleye. For me, that involves a cast iron skillet, a little butter, and salt and pepper to taste.Ohio Fishermans recipe comes close to ""au natural"" and I'll have to try that sometime. A similar recipe I use for trout involves diced peppers and vadalia onions in the trout cavity, salt and pepper to taste and add two tablespoons of cream of mushroom soup (right out of the can). Put the dressed trout onto aluminum foil, pull the edges and ends together and fold over tight, and then cook for 20 minutes over wood fire coals (gas BBQ even easier)."
527034,Mr Twister 1,2003-02-02 11:16:00,5,Fillets coated in mixture of 75% corn flake crumbs and 25% parmesan cheese. Parmesan cheese gives a great flavor but will burn eaily so keep an eye on that frying pan
527035,fishmaster,2003-02-04 17:26:00,209,"Sounds like you guy's are trying to hide the flavor of the fish???Wash off fillets and coat in light breading of your choice. Maybe add some pepper or lemon salt, this amkes for a nice light coating and allows you to be able to have a few beers after dinner even though you might have stuffed yourself, I like to use Mcormicks fish fry with a little pepper and salt added then deep fry to golden brown."
527036,Guest,2003-02-04 20:19:00,0,You can't beat cajun walleye. Go to Emeril's website and he has the ingredients for his mix Simple to make and is much better than store bought mix.Just coat the walleye and stick in a very very hot iron skillet w/ a tiny bit of oil--just enough to wipe around w/ a paper towel before laying in the walleye. Almost fat free way to prepare. I make traditional fried and cajun and I always run out of cajun first...
527037,chrism,2003-02-04 21:14:00,429,"Cajun seasoning really adds to the flavour!I have two to add...Something yet to be mentioned, and the most prefferred way by all of my fishing aquaintances that have tried it (Hmmm... maybe they just want me to cook....) is to melt lots of butter, coat fillets with the melted butter, then sprinkle liberally with cajun seasoning or seasoning salt, place in one of those square wire grill baskets, and cook on wood fire coals (low/med heat) till done... Best I have tried, and I like my food!Second, and this is REALLY good, is to ditch the oil and use plain lard in the deep fryer. It really is better than oil to cook with, and it gives the fish a better taste - you taste fish, and not oil. Use your fav breading recipe then season immed after they come out of the deep fryer - it tastes better this way, as the heat from the deep fryer can nuke the taste of a lot of the seasonings if seasoned before cooking.cm"
527040,Hammerhead Herb,2003-02-07 15:31:00,259,"Try this for a healthy way of grilling your fish. I modified this recipe from a newsletter out of International Falls, MN. We have been doing the fish this way at least once a week when we are up at the Caribou Provencial Park. The nice thing about this recipe is that the fillets can be made up and ready to grill hours before you want to throw them on the grill; this makes it nice for the guys who come in late from the far portage lake. Walleye and Vegetables on the GrillServing Size : 8 Amount / Measure / Ingredient -- Preparation Method-------- ------------ -------------------------------- 8 medium walleye pike fillets 4 tablespoons butter -- melted salt and pepper VEGETABLE MIXTURE 4 cups shredded carrots 4 cups broccoli -- chopped 1 cup onion -- finely diced 2/3 cup Parmesan cheese -- grated 1/2 cup water 4 tablespoons butter -- meltedBrush both sides of the fillet with butter and place in the center of the foil.Sprinkle the fillets with salt and pepper.Combine the vegetable mixture.Place approximately 1/2 cup of the vegetable mixture on each side of the fillet (1 cup total per fillet).Bring the two sides of foil together over the fish, fold leaving ampleroom for steam circulation.Fold and crimp ends.Cook in covered grill over medium hot coals for about 15 minutes or until the fish flakes easily at the thickest part.NOTES : For each fillet use a sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil approximately 14"" x 14""."
527038,Guest,2003-02-08 21:58:00,0,This is a reply to the guy that had a problem with parmesian cheese burning. You should use kraft parmesian instead and you'll have a lot harder time burning it for some reason.
527041,Guest,2003-02-09 17:55:00,0,"Hey Hammerhead Herb: Just tried your fish recipe for the Little Missus tonite (she worked, I was off duty). The only alteration I made was to add some thinly sliced red pepper and some cayenne pepper. I baked it in the oven @ 450 X 20 minutes. Very tasty. The veggies were done to perfection & fish flaky. Thanks for the idea & I'll be doing this again (especially since my wife hates the smell of fried fish in the house)."
527042,Hammerhead Herb,2003-02-13 12:31:00,259,"Glad that you enjoyed it and I will take up your suggestion.Part of the fun of going up to our fly-in is preparing the menus for the days we are up there.We have fish (walleye, lake trout, northern) for 6 out of 7 dinners and about 3 lunches. We will be looking at a walleye omelet this year for breakfast. There is a sign in our cookhouse that sez""Eat fish until you s__t white!!"""
527022,Stevie B,2003-01-29 14:19:00,157,"What is your favourite way to cook fish? For myself the traditional breadcrumbs, flour and spices, cooked in oil is hard to beat. Just wondering how does everybody else here enjoy their catch?"
527023,Guest,2003-01-29 14:58:00,0,Fish dipped in white vinegar and dredged in seasoned cornmeal and fried in peanut oil. The vinegar gives the fish an acicic tang. The cornmeal makes it a wonderful crust. Sometimes I wonder whether its the fish or the crust I like best
527024,stewart,2003-01-29 16:18:00,100,"Had heard of mustard, eggs, etc, but never vinegar. Thanks for a new one. Coating the fish with mustard before breading has been my favourite so far."
527025,Guest,2003-01-29 17:23:00,0,you will probly love this one....dip fillets as you normally would in egg wash then dip in crushed SALT+VINEGAR chips.....MMMMMM gotta go make some
527026,River_eye,2003-01-29 23:21:00,1486,"I like all the breaded fish, but a neat one is boiling filets (pike works better than walleye), or walleye cheeks. Throw salt and bay leaves into the water, boil them for 5 min. tops then dip them in garlic butter. Poor mans lobster."
527027,Guest,2003-01-30 07:12:00,0,Haven't tried this one yet but my friends claim it's a winner. While on a trip to Rainy when it came time for the fish fry they found they were out of milk to dip fillets into before breading. Instead they tried a bottle of ShoreLunch Buttery Creole marinade they had along for grilling. Can't wait to try it!
527028,Guest,2003-01-30 16:41:00,0,"I like to dip my fish in Carnation milk and then bread with cracker crumbs, flour, or cornflakes. I also like the poor mans lobster, just make sure your water is boiling before you put your fish in. I will have to try the bay leaves."
527029,Guest,2003-01-30 21:36:00,0,"For us - Canola oil is a (healthy) favorite, the oil needs to be hot - 350 degrees - prior to filets going in. After a quick dip in milk - crushed cracker crumbs are hard to beat. Filets come out light and tasty."
527030,Pooch,2003-01-30 21:41:00,4619,My wife deep fried chicken strips the other night and she used:3/4 cup of fine ground Rice Crispies cereal1/2 cup flour1 teaspoon salt1/4 teaspoon pepperDunked the chicken into a beaten egg then into the mix then into the fryer. Man that was good. I gotta try this on fish...Pooch
527031,Ohio fisherman,2003-02-01 10:21:00,989,"Here is an easy way to cook walleye fillets that is really good tasting and very healthy. And for a shore lunch, no greasy pan to clean! Take a piece of aluminum foil, put a layer of fillets on the foil. Drizzle on olive oil. Sprinkle with lemon pepper spice - with or without salt to your taste - we like with salt and lots of spice. Flip the fillets. Drizzle a bit more olive oil and repeat the lemon pepper. Top with finely sliced or chopped onion, lemon, and green or red pepper - thin so it cooks thru. Seal up the foil and cook on a rack over a fire for shore lunch, or on a BBQ grill at home, or in the oven. Cook for about 20 minutes or so depending on the heat. Cook until the fish is flaky. Other good ways are walleye chowder and baked walleye.Now I'm hungry - better thaw some fillets right now!Take care, Ohio fisherman"
