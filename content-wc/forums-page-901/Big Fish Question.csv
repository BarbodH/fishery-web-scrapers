Is it hard on the fish to hold them up vertically? That's the impression i got from that post. I have never heard of this before and am curious. With a giant fish, or a small one, i want to do anything to keep the fish in good health, Any info on the subject will be greatly appreciated."

This can be achieved by purchasing a fish cradle. Unfortunately, the cradle works best as a 2 person operation . Occasionally there is no other choice but to bring the fish on board....if this occurs lift the fish by supporting it's belly and hold it horizontally. It's true that big fish can sustain injuries from a veritcle hold. Lastly, do not let the fish thrash around the boat as it has a protective slime on it's body and the less thrashing about the less chance of the slime being removed. Hope this helps. I'm sure others will have their two cents to add as well."

The heavier the fish the greater the chance of spinal seperation and / or visceral damage. In most cases the damage is undetected because the fish swims off to die at a later date. The best method to avoid damage is to keep the fish in the water.....either in a cradle or a large net (preferably one with coated netting and a large enough diameter to act as a holding tank). If a picture is an absolute necessity then be sure and support the fish along the length of its body and keep it out only as long as you can hold your breath. TV shows and some magazines may pay lip service to catch and release but the bottom line is what makes them look good......footage of the big one from several angles. This translates into dollars and sponsorships.....what a farce! Magazines like Esox and Muskies Inc. take the moral high road and will not publish photos that do not show good release methods. Other magazines should be taken to task for there careless attitudes."
