Thanks alan in Chicago. We have our own boat so we would just need the cabin like a housekeeping type.

527652,alan ex pup,2003-02-14 11:30:00,126,Sorry. After reading my post a couple of times I see my mistake. What I am looking for is a privately owned home or cottage in the sioux narrows area on LOTW. Not a cabin affiliated with a resort. Thanks. I just thought someoneup there would do that.
