527587,Guest,2003-02-11 17:42:00,0,We always take up Bass Pro Shops Uncle Bucks Fish batter(original and seasoned).It works great for those walleye shore lunches on Lac Seul.No eggs no flour no mess just shake it on.Cant wait to get back up there in July.You can add beer to it but why waist it drink it.
527588,NateW,2003-02-12 21:01:00,96,I found some stuff out of St. Louis called Andy Fish Batter. It's awesome and easy to use. They don't have a website so I have to call them and order it in bulk 5 lb bags. Call Directory Assistance for Andy's Seasoning.

527591,tly,2003-02-16 05:47:00,1900,GoldenDipt is excellent. It also comes inseveral flavors. We favor the cajun. The tempura isn't bad and fluffs up nice like beer batter except you haven't wasted a beer.Gonna dosome perch tomorrow nite. TLY

You can even read on the back of a box you buy to help the 1st timmers with the 1st batch and go by taste from then on. ESAY on the salt!"
