527596,Guest,2003-02-11 16:59:00,0,"Went to Route Lake three years in row in the late 90's. If your staying the the one lodge on the lake, the folks that own are real nice and do a great American Plan. The Cabins are in good shapeThed fishing is like most place either really on or not. We did OK on Route at time and then at other times virtually nothing. They have several other lakes that you can either portage to or they can take you too and those are much better lakes (at least for us) than Route was. Centerfire for bass is really good, but its very small and if you have guests ahead of you that keep bass, it really hurts the fishery (it really should be a totally CPR lake. Work the island in the center with either top waters (early in the day) or small spinners. The lake holds some really nice Northerns (fishing for bass one day we caught four over 35 inches on light tackle, what fun) or the North shore. The problem with the lake is that those two areas are relatively small and the rest of the lake is sand shoreline so virtually no structure for the bass. Make sure you the only people going over or your going to have limited fishing that day.Bluett Lake is another lake they truck you too and its great for walleye, perch and nothern. This lake is really different than others up in the area as its a weed walleye bite. Your work the weedlines (coontail and cabbage in about 10 - 15 feet of water) pitching jigs or dragging a spinner rig. The east shorline was always best for us, but largely because of the prevailing wind out the west.If you have enough manpower, you can portage a boat to Taggart Lake. To get there you have to pull your boat over a very short portage on a ramp they have map, then motor or pull your boat through a tunnel (can be a challenge if your with a child), then run up another small lake and pull your boat out and put it on a set of wheels they provide and pull it up a hill and down a hill (the latter being pretty steep). I say enough manpower because this is not a one person job unless you play for the Bears, no that would not be right, I mean the Packers. Nobody on the Bears could handle it. The lack you go through is Sunstrum and I have heard others did well on it, but we never did. Taggart is a good walleye lake, just tough to get to.Another truck in lake they can take you to is Bailey. Its loaded with small to mid-size northerns and OK on walleye if you can find them. Bailey is a great smaller lake to go to with kids because its non-stop Northerns. What is really neat there is perhaps on of every 50 or 100 Northerns is something they call a Silver Northern. Looks like a Muskie but is not. Very pretty fish. This lake is lots of fun and one of the best ways to fish is through spinner baits in the shallows and watch the wakes of the northerns attacking it. Just keep reeling and they will hit it.Nice place, the down side for us was that they have limited boats to take you to the portage lakes and as such, if the camp is full, some days you cannot go where you wanted to go. Wouldn't be bad, but Route baffled us on the fish. Nice resort and nice people, but in my situation, I wanted something different for a variety of reasons. You will enjoy it. Let me know if you have more questions. IAWalleye"
527597,Guest,2003-02-12 14:24:00,0,"Thank you very much for your detailed response. If you have the time and inclination, I would appreciate more detail on Route Lake itself...reefs? islands? shorelines? trolling? jigging? depth where fish were found? what was frustrating about the lake? I have fished on Thaddeus Lake, which is just northwest of Route about 15-20 miles on the same road system. We fished a couple of rock humps, but mostly trolled weedlines with little joe spinners and crawlers or minnows. Weather was really tough...series of fronts. But we still caught fish for dinner. Talked to many other guests who would typically catch 50 walleyes per day in better weather. So, I am going back over the 4th of July, then home for a week of work and back to Canada to fish Route. But, I digress...We are going to take our own boats, so we do want to use them on Route for a good portion of the trip. Glad to hear the people are nice and the cabins OK. The camp was actually recommended to us by ""Rocky"" the owner of Thaddeus Lake Lodge. Anyway, if you have time, I would appreciate hearing more.I live in Sheboygan Falls, WI where I serve as Supt. of Schools. We are about 1/2 way between Green Bay on the north and Milwaukee on the south...right on Lake Michigan. I was born and raised in Rock Rapids, IA and still have season football tickets and ESPN Full Court so I never miss the Hawks. Went to the disasterous Orange Bowl with most of the rest of the State. If you want to e-mail me directly instead of going through Walleye Central, feel free. You will find me at [email protected].Thanks again and think spring.Dr. Lee"
