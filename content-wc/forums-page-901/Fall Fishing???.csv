527764,Guest,2003-02-17 11:11:00,0,"I go from Oct. 5 to about the 15th every year and the bite is usually very good then. Depending on the weather, it can start by early to mid-Sept."
527765,Babamel,2003-02-17 13:33:00,0,I have often gone over laborday weekend. It seems by then the big pike are starting to bite much better. The Walleye bite too seems to have improved over mid summer.
527766,Guest,2003-02-17 13:56:00,0,"Depends on how far North in Canada you go.I go up to NW Ontario around late Aug or first part of Sept.The pike are usually getting pretty active by that time, the walleye seem to hit just about always.If you wait till Oct in that part of the country and you could be ice-fishing. Most of the resorts are shutting down then and may be open for moose hunting, but the fishing for the most part is over in that part of the country. Good Luck."
527767,Guest,2003-02-17 14:10:00,0,"walleye nut is right about the possibility of ice fishing in NW Ontario in Oct. I should've added to my earlier message that I also target muskies and mid-Oct. is prime time for fall muskies. But, I've also had several 100 plus eye days in Oct. The last two years we had a couple inches snow but it quickly melted. There are moose and duck hunters, which I enjoy having around. It's a different feel late in the season as the resorts are closing, the birds are heading south, and the leaves are dropping. But, if you're not adverse to a couple chilly days, you can have the whole lake mostly to yourself and catch a lot of fish. The crappie also seem to bite more later in the fall. Good luck."
