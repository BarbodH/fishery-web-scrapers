526672,NateW,2003-02-12 20:56:00,96,"No matter which map you get, I sttongly suggest keeping a compass with you. I also use the ""Explorer Series"" from AWColdstream listed above. They are easy to use and even easier if you have a compass on hand. I have an inexpensive one I keep pinned to my flotation vest. Works great...GOOD LUCK!"
526673,Dave S,2003-02-12 23:13:00,314,"Tom: I found the AWColdstream and topographic maps accurately mapped many of the reefs. Lac Seul is a gigantic lake with thousands of underwater reefs. As Nate implied you need to be concerned about two things: 1) Having a map showing the reefs and 2) Having a compass and / or GPS so you know exactly where you are on that map. Without knowing exactly where you are on the map at all times, the best maps in the world will not help you to avoid hitting reefs."
526662,TomPGrouse,2003-01-18 16:56:00,124,"Heading up to Lac Suel this summer. Will be staying at Lac Suel Ojibway Outfitters. Being a map kind of guy,can anyone point me in the right direction (no pun intended) for a quality map for this area?Thanks"
526663,Jigger1,2003-01-18 18:17:00,234,"Tom - You can get waterproof - tear resistant maps of Lac Seul from http://www.awcoldstream.com/dmaps/ They have four section maps of Lac Seul - Northwest, Southwest, Southeast, Northeast."

526665,Guest,2003-01-21 13:42:00,0,"Just bear in mind that the maps are not to live by and are not extremely accurate, but will help no question about it. Better than nothing, but pay attention those rock piles are not always where they say so on the map. Ojibway is a great place and Ken and Brenda run a good ship with great fishing."
526666,Guest,2003-01-24 20:01:00,0,Still need some help.
526667,2 DOGS,2003-01-24 20:37:00,361,"Chances are your Resort owner will provide you with a decent one. I stay at Golden Eagle and they provide all guests with real good ones. Why not contact Ojibway and request one? If not, I have seen them in Bobby's bait shop in Vermillion Bay and 4Seasons sport shop in Ear Falls. Don't know that you'd need all 4 sections, just pick the ones you want."
526668,Dave S,2003-01-25 15:03:00,314,"Tom:I fished for the first time last summer on Lac Seul and ordered a number of maps. I would suggest you contact World of Maps, Inc,1235 Wellington StreetOttawa, Ontario Canada K1Y 3A3 Phone No. (613) 724-6776 or 1-(800) 214-8524, Website http://worldofmaps.com and order Topographic Maps of Lac Seul. The lake is shown on several maps so have to pick the area you are wanting to fish. The beauty of these maps is that they have Latitude / longitude lines so one can easily pick off coordinates of reefs, islands, main channels, etc. I found the Metric grid the easiest to utilize as every grid line was 1 killometer apart. I programed into my GPS coordinates of reefs I wanted to fish and travel rountes and found them to be quit accurate. The other maps mentioned above from Alex Wilson Coldstream Ltd. were the easiest to look at, color coded depth contours, and water proofed so definitely worth getting also. Topo maps gave me location coordinates and Alex Wilson maps gave me water depths."
526669,Guest,2003-01-27 12:46:00,0,"Are you staying at Chamberlin Narrows? If you are,the map they give you at camp is sufficient for finding your way around the area. They also sell maps at their bait shop in Soux Lookout. At CN we've had excellent fishing right off the dock. TGG"
526670,Cash,2003-02-12 10:01:00,73,I got a GREAT laminated map of Lac Seul at CanadaMapSales.com . Phone # 1-877-7226.
526671,Guest,2003-02-12 18:43:00,0,"I know they will not mark all of them, but which map is the mostaccurate in showing rocks ? Sooner or later I can find the fish,but I don't want the rocks finding my motor. Some maps only showdepths and no rocks. Best map ?? Thanks..."
