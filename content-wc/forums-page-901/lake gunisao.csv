I hope last's year's fishing was not an abberation, but part of a real trend towards a new 'good old days'>we had booked a trip back in may but had to be cancelled. i will >still look to go if they can fill in for one or two. Too bad you had to cancel. May is often booked solid.I'll try to add a bit of general info for anyone else reading, hopefully something useful to all lakes in the 200 miles north of Winnipeg range ;). Spring walleye fishing conditions go all the way to late June to early July. The main lake can be excellent, and for me more fun, but it's of course deeper water than the 5-6' you fish in spring.Reserve for the kind of fishing you like to do. Bring tackle appropriate to the season, and if your comming in the grey transition time, bring terminal tackle for shallow and deeper. If you need more info from me Loren; fishermanstew(at)hotmail. com. Don't really want to use the board for personal conversations, or to advertise.But if anyone wants the straight goods on the fishing at Gunisao, might as well ask now while the thread is started ;)."
