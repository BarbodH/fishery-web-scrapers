527503,Guest,2003-02-11 06:57:00,0,"I looked at the specifications on this unit and they seem comparible to some of the other products out there. From what I can see the savings you are seeing are the ""toolbox"" like case instead of the waterproof case as well as the marketing expense associated with the Aqua-Vu type packages. There also may be a quality type issue on the way the camera attaches to the video/power cable. At $320 Canadian, which includes shipping, you are looking at $210-$215. It is also availble on Ebay and you might save a few dollars there if they want to move some of these units."
