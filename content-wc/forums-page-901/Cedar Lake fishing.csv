527581,Guest,2003-02-11 09:58:00,0,I'm taking my son to Cedar Lake (north of Vermilion Bay) this summer. I've never been to Canada. Has anybody fished this lake? Do you have any advice? Thanks!

Not to many trophy fish but good numbers of wallye,northern,small mouth, and usualy 3-4 musky per trip. we fish mainly fish for walleye so the skies are on accident and and we hit the weed beds for pike 5 or 6 times while we are there. I have had my best luck in the north east corner of musky bay right near the weeds in about 7 feet of water trolling little joe spinners tipped with a minnow. We like the weeds of nelson for the pike and also have good luck in the narrows to perault. Those are some of our most productive spots but we have caught fish all over that lake. Good luck!!Where are you staying at?"

We met them at the All Canada show in Madison Wi. a couple weeks ago. We're not out to get trophies, we just love to fish! It should be a great experience, we've never been up there before.Bruce"
