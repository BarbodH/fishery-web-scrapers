527674,alan ex pup,2003-02-17 00:47:00,126,If this is the same one I saw when we are driving to our lodge at ear falls we see a sign for woman river camp. the road starts out paved but a couple of years ago the road turned to gravel the rest of the road is probably gravel also. This road actually belongs I think to the logging company. I got on this road just to see where it went. Some empty logging truck was coming up behind me and all I could see was a cloud of dust. Now the last thing you want in your new vehicle is to have a logging truck pass you on a gravel road. I could only think that my windshield and paint would have been reduced to craters. Those trucks go at least 15 mph over the limit. I sped up and turned off at the next intersection. I cant imagine going 40 miles like that! Good luck
