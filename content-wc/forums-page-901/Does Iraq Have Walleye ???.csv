527641,Guest,2003-02-12 18:48:00,0,Europe has Zander a cousin of the Walleye. They look almost the same.
527643,chrism,2003-02-12 19:40:00,429,The REAL problem here is that Sadman probably doesn't fish!
527644,Atomic Eye,2003-02-12 21:07:00,854,"Recent history (mostly still classified information) suggests that all residual Iraqi fish have mutated as a result of chemical, biological, or nuclear insults to their bioenvironments. While the Iraqis may have had species of fish that were previously related to walleye in some limited waters, even these are now referred to as four-eye, tail-eye, or butt-eye as the newer generations have genetically-mutated. There is even a new species that could be called hump-backed walleye that appears to have striking resemblance to the hump-backed camel.Because of his extremely high dependence on the Iraqi Republican Guard, Mr. Hussein has forbidden his elite troops from eating any fish flesh more than 1X per 53 years. This figure was arrived at after consulting with weapons inspector lead, Hans Blix, whose instruments have continued to be pegged at full scale when inspecting for varied weapons of mass destruction (leaded jigs excluded - currently).Are there any additional tales that were missed? Thanks.Mr. Hussein, duck, because there are a number of cruise missiles and non-manned drones that have ""Kiss me, SH"" on them! In addition, my state, New Mexico, has sent a significant number of Spirit Stealth warplanes to the mid-East. These are the invisible, deadly planes that leave their armament before you knew it was coming.The tactical predictions are for 300 - 400 cruise missiles to rain down on targets in ""Bagdead"" on the first day of the assault followed by 300 - 400 the second day. The message is clear for Hussein to disarm or be disarmed. Right?Atomic Eye (New Mexico) -- ""Gone Fission!"" ~~~<}}}:>"
527645,Guest,2003-02-13 15:33:00,0,There are indeed Walleye in Iraq. Saddam's son ( Scott) put freak'en lasers on them. Sorry Austin!
527631,Guest,2003-02-12 08:55:00,0,If Iraq doesent have Walleye do we really have to go over there and raise ****? Have the inspectors found any Walleye? Does the goverment have any proof that Saddam has any Walleye fishing equipment? I have never seen Saddam with a STREN hat on his head. Would you fish with Saddam in his boat? Maybe we need to change our prioritys...NO WALLEYE....NO WAR.
527632,Guest,2003-02-12 09:24:00,0,"It's apparent cabin fever is reached critical levels...I don't think there's walleye over there. But, like most walleye in the spring seeing jigs every 2 mintues, Irag is going to have some lead dropping on them pretty soon."
527633,Guest,2003-02-12 09:42:00,0,"Part of the tension between the US and Iraq is an absence of commonality resulting mainly from Iraq's lack of Walleye. If they did, we would share banter on web sites like this one with our Iraqi brothers, which would go far to heal many of the problems of today. But I don't think Iraq even has lakes, let alone, Walleye, so we in the US don't know how to relate to them.Case in point, Canada has an excellent walleye fishery enjoyed by US and Canadian citizens alike. We both get along rather fabulously, at least considering the length of the border we share. Sure we have had some rubs in the past, but nothing serious would ever happen mainly because it could disturb the ""Walleye Balance"". Of course, were Canada to be taken over by a dictator who threatened to cut off access to Walleye, then something more serious could occur. Likewise, if we were to elect a Walleye-addicted President who unilaterally demanded more Walleye access, then Canada would justifiably respond with some aggression. But neither will ever happen. Canadians don't much like dictators and Dubya ain't no Walleye fisherman (probably likes bass). The last Walleye state candidate we had (McGovern, from Minnesota), was trounced by Nixon."
527634,Vitreum,2003-02-12 09:54:00,221,"with 120 degrees f common in the summer, i kinda doubt that they have walleye. most of their fish are carp like species, some catfish and shad."
527635,Thumper,2003-02-12 10:07:00,133,"There could possibly be a few walleye in the Tigris or Euphrates rivers. If not, I suggest we send them a couple buckets full of fry and fingerlings. I'd fish with Saddam. Then all this would go away. All the world's problems could be solved in a deep V while backtrolling, provided the beer kept flowing long enough. :9 ""Dip A Line For Peace""- Rick ""Thumper"" TorgerudBTW - I think Senator McGovern was from South Dakota. Hubie Humphrey and Fritz Mondale was from Minnesota, but neither of those two ever called the White House home. Too bad the VPs never get much imput into public policies, or we'd surely have more Walleye Friends! ;)"
527636,Guest,2003-02-12 10:19:00,0,"Why don't we concentrate all our efforts on extracting every single gobie from lake Erie and dump them onto Iraq? Then we take what's left over and we dump those onto France. Imagine, all those dirty, smelly Iraqi's and French up to their armpits in gobies...they'd feel right at home....and Erie could again be gobie free. As Marty Luther once said, ""I have a dream""."
527637,Eric,2003-02-12 11:06:00,114,Fritz mondale was indeed from Minn. and I have been told he used to fish Canada on the Manitou chain of lakes above Fort Francis.
527638,Guest,2003-02-12 11:13:00,0,"I stand corrected and should have known that McGovern was indeed a Dakotan (another Walleye state). I read his book last year about being a bomber pilot out of Italy in WWII. Didn't mention walleye anywhere in the book (but along this same line, they don't have Walleye in Germany either do they?)."
527639,Guest,2003-02-12 11:21:00,0,"Bush or Saddam as a fishing partner, hmmmmm I don't know. Probably Saddam, but only if refrained from using Lures of Mass Destruction. If he didn't, then Bush although he'd probably make a whine a lot if the fishing got slow."
527640,Guest,2003-02-12 12:00:00,0,If you fished with Saddam it would probaly be for catfish! And the stink bait he would pull out of his tackle box would probaly be a bottle of the small pox virus!!!}>
