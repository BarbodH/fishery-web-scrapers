507602,Guest,2000-04-10 21:54:00,0,I am looking for a drive to camp or cabin for Walleye fishing in Ontario. There will be six of us and are willing to ruff it and pull are own boats. We have had fly ins with excellent fishing. Can we expect to drive to a lake with the same results?
507603,River_eye,2000-04-10 22:42:00,1486,"The answer is both yes and no. Yes, because there are quite a few lakes that you can launch your boat in, which hold excellent fisheries. The problem is that the best road accessable lakes are usually quite large and complex. It may be hard to key into the patterns on these large lakes if you've never been there, and you don't have a guide. Many of the reefs and different structure that make these lakes good fisheries are also a huge danger to your boat if you don't know where you are going. My advice is to spare no expense and gather all the info you can on the body of water you are fishing. There are a few good books out there that will help you read the water, find out what type of water you are on. There are many different types of lakes, rivers, and resevoirs. A depth chart is a must, which will probably be available in local bait shops, or Nat. res. offices. Besides that, talk to the locals. That's about all I can say.[font size=""4"" color=""green"" font face=""signature""]River eye[/font]"
