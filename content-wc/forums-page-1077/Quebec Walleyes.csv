507265,Guest,2000-03-03 10:04:00,0,I haven't seen much information regarding the walleye fishing in the Province of Quebec. For the past twenty years we have made the trip to O'Sullivan Lake and found the walleye fishing to be spectacular in both numbers and size of walleye. Is there anyone else out there who prefers Quebec? And does anyone have any positive experiences worth mentioning?
507266,Guest,2000-03-04 21:17:00,0,I have fished Quebec for over 20 years. I'm in Ohio. So I go to N.Bay and then go east for about 100 miles. The town is Belleterre and is about 50 miles east of Villamarie. We have had good fishing but we do not stay in a big camp like O'Sullivan's may have. There are a number of lakes to travel to and fish. We fish for walleye. Our northern pike catches have been more by accident when walleye fishing. This year I will go to a new camp for me. Camp Ronodo which is located north of New Liskeard. The town is Remingy (sp.?)

We did very well both years catching alot of fish,but didnt catch many big ones.We drive & tow boats from western New York. Its a very long, rough trip, but nice once you get there. Some days you dont see any other boats. Ssshhh, dont tell anyone, Quebec is the underfished Walleye capital of the world!"

Been going for 9 years and fish out of Barrage Gouin, but have been going out of an outpost he has 35 miles from the main lodge. I fish all day and hardly see another boat on the lake except when it is time to go back to camp you see some guys crusin by about 1/2 mile from you! I think the 1st 3 weeks after iceout is best, had times when it snowed for 3 days in June while we were there. Can't wait to go this year. Don't tell everyone! HAHAHAHA. John"
507270,Guest,2000-04-11 16:55:00,0,"I have been to the Gouin Res twice, Both with Ceasars Lodge. All private lake fly-ins. Both times were in mid Aug. The 1st time the avg high temp for the week was about 50 with lows in the mid 30s at night. Lake was high and fishing was super. I caught several 24"" eye's. One evening two of us caught 32 pike in a little over two hours. The 2nd trip last year, temps were in the upper 70's to 80's and lows in the 60's. Lake was down about 6 feet or more and fishing was slow. YOu take your chances. the lake we were at was lake super. I a planning a trip to Lac Poutrincourt next year."
