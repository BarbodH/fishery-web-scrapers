507455,Guest,2000-04-12 12:58:00,0,"Ed, how is the walleye fishing in Cabonga lately? Friends of mine had been going there for 15years but stopped because the fishing was so poor in 1996 and 1997. Reports were that the natives were gillnetting the spawning streams in the spring. We would like to go back camping and fishing there, but only if we could hear that the fishing has improved. please respond. Thanks!"
507445,Guest,2000-03-20 20:32:00,0,Has anyone fished the lakes in the Leverndre reserve in Quebec. I have been going there for a few years and it is fantastic. You are virtually always the only boat on the lake and the fishing is unreal. Grand lake Victoria is my favorite.Just wondering if anyone else had experienced it.
507446,Guest,2000-03-21 05:11:00,0,"For the past twenty years I've traveled to Quebec and, although the lake we fish (O'Sullivan L.) is just outside LaVerendrye Park, I know exactly what you mean. It's a secluded paradise and outstanding walleye fishery. One of the smaller lakes into which we portage is ""catch and release"", and the only thing you'll carry out is a picture of you maybe holding up a huge walleye or a northern up to 25 lbs.northern up to 25 lbs. The walleyes are plentiful and often average on the big side. The place has a reputation for big lakers, as well. For us, the drive up Clova Road to the camp is almost as enjoyable as the fishing itself and, beleive me, the fishing (and acommodations) are outstanding. My suggestion is that we keep word about Quebec walleye fishing to ourselves so as to preserve the wilderness. Oops...I guess the secret's out."

They'd never come back ;-).Quebec has the lowest catch and release ratio of any province, and the conservation mentality here is years behind what I read about happening in some areas of the States and Canada.I feel that I'm going to have to make a trip this summer.Just doesn't seem right that I've lived here all my life and haven't experienced this great fishing that exists furthur north."
507448,Tyee,2000-03-21 19:36:00,60,"Where in Quebec are these lakes located ?Do you have any recommendations for lodgesor resorts that you would pass along, withtheir phone numbers and web sites ?Sounds like a great area."
507449,Guest,2000-03-22 15:20:00,0,"Tyee, In the park, there are a few lodges but not many. Deer Horn Lodge and Dorval Lodge are owned by the same family and are on huge, untamed lakes.I don't have their numbers but you may find them by surfing the net. I usually get the map out, find a large lake, and then start calling to find motels or campgrounds. The lodges tend to be much more costly but I guess it depends on your budget."
507450,Guest,2000-03-22 17:59:00,0,"Try this website: www.travel-net.com~gagnonfor O'Sullivan Lake Lodge. (Omit the ""~gagnon"" and you'll get a general website for Quebec) Good luck...hope this helps. You can e-mail me if you want a thorough refernce regarding the fishing at this lake. We'll be there in June and I'm counting the minutes."
507451,Guest,2000-04-08 22:06:00,0,"Have been to Gouin Res with Ceasars Lodge,(fly-in only)twice. 1st time was in mid Aug. It was fantastic, most Walleye were in the 16"" range. Top water lures for pike was the most fun I've had with my clothes on!! 2nd time last year (99) was during that drought and the Res. was at least 6 to 10 Ft down from where it was the year before. Fishing was just OK. Some you win,some you lose. This year I am going to Lac Poutrincourt. It is North Central Q. It was recommended by my good friend who introduced me to the Head of the Hunting & Fishing Ministry for Q. This was his recommendation. Good luck"
507452,Guest,2000-04-09 05:01:00,0,I haven't fished in laverendrye park for many years. But i do remember how great it was. You should try a link to the provincial government. They offer accomodations in the center of the park. There are a number of cabins and for every 2 people you can get a boat and access to a lake where you might be the only one around! The cabins were excellent. I also fished a dam[barrage dozois]almost out the top end of the park. The fishing from shore was superb.I don't currently live near there but the thing that stopped me coming back was the price of the fishing license. As a canadian i was sick of getting screwed with the ever increasing price. Last time i checked it was in the $55 range for a non-resident canadian. That was 10 years ago.....larry
