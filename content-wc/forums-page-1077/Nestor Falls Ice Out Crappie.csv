507618,Guest,2000-04-13 14:11:00,0,"Several weeks ago I was in Nestor Falls for a weekend ice fishing trip on LOW. We had excellent Crappie fishing. I was wondering what the Crappie fishing was like in the Nestor Falls area after ice out. I would be interested in LOW or any other lake in the area. Where would I fish and what tactics would I use. Prior to the opening of Walleye season, my buddies and I generally take an ice out trip for Northern Pike and I thought some Crappie fishing might be fun. TGG"
