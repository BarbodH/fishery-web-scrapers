507580,Guest,2000-04-10 17:32:00,0,"Dear loren, I had the pleasure of fishing out of Windy river outpost on Nueltin a few years ago. This was the first part of august and caught a good number of trout between 20-35 lbs. Fished the shouls at the mouth of Smith bay and Fox narrows using husky devels in char.five diamonds, and blue silver. The grayling and northern fishing is better out of the main lodge on the southern part of the lake.You can stay in the outposts and do it yourself or stay in the lodge with guides. The fishery is more than enough to satisfy your needs.I would have been back, but I got sidetracked with Char on the Nanook River , in Victoria Island. Good Luck, No Fish"

507582,Guest,2000-04-11 22:55:00,0,"Hi Loren.If your looking for large northern pike may I suggest Kistigan Lake Lodge. It's also in northern Manitoba. I'm not exactly sure of the name, but if your interrested I can find it for you (probably the phone # also). I beleive that except for shore lunch it is catch and release. I have heard that the BIG pike are abundant.Lawrence"
