507586,Hunter,2000-04-11 16:51:00,346,I belive the living eye minnows are a Cabela's product and are only available through Cabela's. Have you heard any good reports on this product?
507587,Guest,2000-04-12 06:52:00,0,"Just what I have read in the various magazines, and the reviews of the product. Everything I have read has been positive. With the bait bans in effect in Alberta, this seems to be a viable alternative - I guess I have to bite the bullet and order some.They do look great....I'll let you know after I receive them and try them out.S."
