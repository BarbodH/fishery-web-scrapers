507641,Jim,2000-04-18 20:45:00,238,"Glen,Pipestone is part of a big chain that has all species. You can go after muskies, lake trout, walleye, smallies and pike, and panfish, of course. Pipestone is deep and clear and contains lakers and muskies. Toward the other end, Lake Dispair, is darker. I think one piece of advice is bring all your stuff and fish the part of the chain that's ""going"" at that time.Jim"
