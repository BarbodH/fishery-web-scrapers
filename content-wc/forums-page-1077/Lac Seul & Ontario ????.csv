507588,Guest,2000-04-10 12:40:00,0,"We are planning a trip to Lac Seul during mid-June of this year. Since this is our first trip into Canada for fishing, we have a few questions regarding techniques and general Canada information. We plan on fishing primarily jigs and spinners for walleyes, but I'm wondering if it is worth bringing gear for pulling plugs for them at that time of year. If so, what lures have been productive in the past. We plan on bringing our own groceries to do our cooking, but would like to know if there is anything we can't bring across the border? We just plan on bringing a few sticks of deer sausage, some brats, eggs, bacon, potatos, beans, etc. Are these things allowed. As far as bait is concerned, I plan on buying minnows at the resort, but would like to bring crawlers if it is legal. Also, maybe a few leeches if it is legal. Any help will be appreciated. Thank you."
507589,Guest,2000-04-10 17:06:00,0,"Dear EG, The live bait issue has been one that has caused a great deal of anger with visiting fisherman the past few years. The only live bait allowed to come into Canada is nightcralwers packed in artificial worm bedding-- no leeches-- no minnows. Gas is allowed at 12 gal./moter. Cigarettes at 1 crt../person-- cigars 50/ pers. I've never been bothered about groceries. I think the rule on booze is 1 case beerand 1fifth / person. I,ve had the privlege of fishing Lac Suel frequently over the last 11 yrs.you will find that live bait fishing is the norm and the first best way to catch big walleye. Any specifics about the Suel you can contact at enclosed adress. Good Luck, No Fish"
507592,Guest,2000-04-10 17:31:00,0,"EG, the only things I would add to ""No Fishes"" comments are on the liquor it's ""EITHER"" one case of beer (24, 12 container) ""OR"" a Liter of hard liquor, and more importantly I have caught 50-100 Walleyes a day per person on crank baits in June on Lac Seul while others were struggling to catch shore lunch. (See Spike in the fishing Dept. at Gander Mountain in Maple Grove MN for our secret Lac Seul crank baits, he's a believer!!!)"
507590,Guest,2000-04-10 17:42:00,0,"Thanks for the information. That should help out a lot. I have a resort in MN and can get crawlers wholesale, that is why I want to know if I can bring them in. With the gas restrictions, does that mean I can't fill my built-in tank on the boat (45 gal), or does it mean I am limited to bringing that much extra? The package that I am getting at the resort we are staying at allows us 6 gal. per day, which should be just about enough with my new 100 4-stroke.Thanks."
507593,Guest,2000-04-10 18:06:00,0,"DearMike, Any first time fisherman going to Canada especially to Lac Suel, I advise them to use live bait until they learn the waters. Once these people learn the digs they can and will devolop their own system. And besides, everybody knows,you can't eat a crankbait but a leech makes a great omlette. No Fish"
507591,Jesse-WI,2000-04-10 18:18:00,534,"The are allowed to enter Canada with a reasonable amount of gasoline. A reasonable amount is all built in tanks full or an amount that you would safety travel the water on. The question they usually ask is if you have any extra gas. I say ""no"" extra gas, just have what is in the boat and trucks tanks. I have never had a problem.The amount you can take comes down to the size of the boat and the tanks it has. If you had a 2 stroke kicker with a separate tank, that would be okay also."
507595,Jesse-WI,2000-04-10 18:22:00,534,"You are allowed to bring an amount of groceries that could reasonably be consumed by those people bring the groceries. The only thing that can cause problems is fresh fruit and vegatables. The Canadian's have never asked crossing but the US border guards have asked on the return trip.If you use more than one vechicle, make sure each vechicle is legal based on the number of people in the vechicles at crossing time. (both directions)"
507594,Guest,2000-04-10 18:34:00,0,"No Fish, I am by no way advocating leaving the live bait at home (we always have leeches & Nightcrawlers), all I'm saying is, over the past 12 years that I've been going to Lac Seul, I've had several trips where crank baits far out produced live bait in both numbers and size. My fishing buddies who experienced the hot crank bait trips mention them everytime the subject of Lac Seul comes up. See Spike (fishing Dept. Manager at Gander Mountain in Maple Grove MN)(I'm sure he'll give you ""Spike's Lac Seul discount"")Over & OutMike"
507596,Guest,2000-04-14 11:25:00,0,"...and for God's sakes, don't settle for anything less than 100% DEET!No Fish is right about the leech omelettes, try 'em with a little salsa!"
507597,Guest,2000-04-19 09:09:00,0,I've had the best luck on Lac Seul with jigs and grub tails. Black heads with a white body. and chartruese.Norhterns like anything shiny.The south end of the lake is better than the north.Good LuckMike
