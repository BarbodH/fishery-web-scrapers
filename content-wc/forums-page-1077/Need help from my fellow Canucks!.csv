507519,bigtiller,2000-04-07 06:43:00,13,"Hi Mike. Everyone has an opinion about boats. I look at your choice and think your more into budget than fact. You may not have asked yourself all the right questions. How many people do I fish with? Where do I fish the most? Do I want to upgrade in H.P. later? 50 h.p. on 17 ft. sounds too small based on possible weight carried, and waters fished. No performance from the boat. No hull plane with a couple of buddies and tackle. Upgrade your h.p. to max and you will find yourself at 3/4 throttle because your boat starts to porpoise. It has been an inherent hull problem with Legend. Resale is not good. Motorguide is no longer. You will see a completely new product very soon, with much better technology. I hope you call back."
507517,Guest,2000-04-07 08:19:00,0,"Thanks. I'd checked out all warranties during my search. The Legends have a 10 year hull warranty, a lifetime floor warranty, and a 5 yr warranty on the carpet."
507520,Guest,2000-04-07 08:50:00,0,"Sure...I asked myself all these questions. Firstly, 50 HP will be more than enough. I'm not into speedboating, nor am I into travelling 50+ miles to a particular hole. A reasonable amount of power to push a full max load of about 1650 lbs. is all I need. I like 4 stroke motors, both from an environmental and performance perspective (cheap on gas, quiet, no fouling after hours of trolling). The vast majority of my fishing - 99% - is done with my best buddy, either on small/medium size inland lakes, the Ottawa/Rideau River waterway, or the Bay of Quinte. With a boat, I naturally hope to try out many of the northern lakes as well. The Legend has a hull weight of 700 lbs. The Lund and Princecraft are 150 - 200 lbs. heavier, so trailering is also an issue for me. I don't own an SUV or big truck. And..yes...cost is a concern. Oh, BTW, the Princecraft 169DLX is not a Deep V...it's a semi.I am water trialing this boat next weekend, along with my buddy, so I'll let you know how I made out!"
507521,Guest,2000-04-08 08:08:00,0,*Ask for help and do it anyways Oh Well We Tried to Warn him
507522,Guest,2000-04-09 19:16:00,0,"I'm just curious, when you say we'll see a completely new product soon, does this mean Legend is getting a new supplier for hulls? I'd really like details if you know anything about this. Dealing with the ppl at Legend has been good, and I really like the layout and finish of my boat. What I'm trying to say is I'd probably deal with them again, but there isn't a chance if their hulls are still smokers.....I won't make that mistake twice. Love to hear from you..."
507523,Guest,2000-04-10 09:44:00,0,"I said I would water trial the boat...not that I was going to buy it. I have certainly appreciated the feedback, and I will definitely try to talk to Legend owners in the area about their experiences. I intend on asking the marina for a list of references from previous customers who have purchased this boat.If the boat porpoises at speed, or struggles under load, or otherwise ""misbehaves"" in any manner, I'll walk away without a second glance..."
507524,Guest,2000-04-12 10:13:00,0,am an owner on legend v170 sportfish w/ 75 hp mariner. some small problems..nothing serious...bought mine in 98..top speed 75 kmh..paid 17000..bought all the upgrades..suggest you do same...use mine in lake ontario and the french river ..excellent all around boat..dont buy the force motor..they are crap..definitely get the power tilt & trimand the oil injection(if you go 2 stroke)..have fun!!!
507508,Guest,2000-04-03 10:24:00,0,"I'm a first time boat buyer, and while I think I've done my homework on various makes of 17 foot deep V aluminum fishing boats, I could sure use some advice/reassurance from the more experienced boaters out there.I've looked at competing models of Lowe, Princecraft, Lund, Tracker, Sylvan, and Legend. I've settled on the Legend in my mind, but not yet with my wallet.Can you folks kindly relate to me your opinion of this boat? It's a Legend V165 Scorpion (17 ft.)deep V aluminum rig, 50 HP Merc 4 stroke, bowmounted Motorguide 42 lb. trolling motor, Lowrance X-24 sonar, onboard battery charger, full instrumentation w/dash mounted Ritchie compass, circuit breakers instead of fuses, electric bilge, 4 deluxe seats, aerated livewell/baitwell in bow, dual 7 ft. lockable rod storage, bow and aft casting platforms, rod and drink holders galore, 72 litre under-floor fuel tank, .100 gauge aluminum deep V hull, acrylon custom boat cover, Shorelander 1500 lb. trailer w/bearing buddies, rigging and freight included.It's the last 1999 model a dealer has on his lot. The 2000 model rigged out the same is about $2,000 more.Please! Any feedback would be extremely appreciated. Thanks, guys."
507509,Guest,2000-04-03 10:42:00,0,"Sorry...I can get the rig, as mentioned, for $15,500..."
507511,Guest,2000-04-03 16:17:00,0,"I wish the Princecraft boats were more available to us here in New York. We've had the pleasure of fishing from Princecrafts in Quebec for about 10 years and if they were available locally, I would have opted for one instead of the Sylvan (which I love) that I ended up buying. That's just an opinion from an American. Good luck."
507510,Russ,2000-04-03 17:49:00,17,"Mike, I have fished for many years now and have only seen the Legend series of boats. I have talked to a few owners though, and the satisfaction of owning one does not seem to be there. It seems to be a good price, but if all you are shopping is price I would look for something with a little less, Ie: no graph,compass ect. These little extras that sound good cost only a fraction of what you might think. Graphs are one thing that you get what you pay for. Compass? Is it neccessary where you live?Out west on the prarie it would be of no use. Try to find some one with a Legend and see his response before you dive in. A boat is something you will probably keep for a while and you do not want to be unhappy with it.I have run a lot of different boats from Stratos to Lund or glass to aluminum. I would go with a Lund if you can. Resale is there as well as quality for the long haul. Look at a Lund and compare apples to apples. This is my opinion not yours,Russ"
507512,chrism,2000-04-03 22:38:00,429,"That seems like an OK price for that boat...however...look at a few prices on second hand ones and average out a price - you may find that with the drop in resale value, you may be able to justify something else that may seem unaffordable.I went through the shopping thing last year, and did consider the legends, but the price was not competitive where I live.I have seen complete rigs (although not as equipped as the legend) for around the same price.I bought a 99 lund pro-guide(in 99) with a 5o 4stke and paid 1g less than your quote and I believe they are comparable boats (except the lund is about a foot longer)- and, if you save $1000, you can buy the toys you want and not what they want to ""give"" you.Food for thought."
507513,Guest,2000-04-04 19:04:00,0,"I have 1999 Lund Explorer SS, 16'-8"", 81.5"" wide, with a Honda 50 HP on it. Just love this little boat. The 19 gallon internal fuel tank lasts forever with the Honda. Tops out at 33 mph with 2 100 kg guys and gear. The Yamaha 50 HP is also an outstanding choice. Pick the motor your local dealer can service. I've got a Lowrance X-85 on it, also very please with this unit.Enjoy what ever you get...be safe.Tony"
507514,Guest,2000-04-05 08:15:00,0,"Well, I think I can help.....don't do it!!! LOLI own a 98 Legend V159 allsport and will be getting rid of it asap. After one season on the water, every screw and bold on the unit was loose. The bow flexes so much even in slightly rough water that my walk through winshield falls through. My tape deck died, my trolling motor does not work properly, the paint finish marks at the slightest touch. Oh yeah, and I lost seven rivets in one year. Needless to say, I was just a little upset! I brought my boat into Legend (I live about five miles from their HQ in whitefish), and their service guy was great as far as going through the entire boat and trying to make everything right, but they would not touch the paint, saying it was abuse. I do not abuse my boat. He also said the problem with the rivets was a manufacturers defect in certain models from Smokercraft. If so, why wasn't it recalled? And when I mentioned trading up to a 166 sportfish with a 50 four-stroke just to get rid of my lemon, he told me my boat plus 9000 bucks! They are by far alot nicer to look at than most makes I've seen, but that doesn't help much if you're sinking....hope I helped. If anyone else as had better experiences with them than me, I love to hear from you...."
507515,Guest,2000-04-05 11:31:00,0,"I think the Crestliner fishhawk series would fall into this price category. Mine's a 98 with 50hp 2stroke, 4 stroke would be a little more but I think you could do it for just under 16k.They are a top quality boat, all welded hull with great service and warranty.Don't want to complicate things, just make sure you've eliminated all the options.Good luck."
507516,Guest,2000-04-07 04:36:00,0,"Check out the warranty. I believe the Legend is 5 years. Lund 10 years, Princecraft 20 years. Needless to say, I own a Princecraft."
507518,Guest,2000-04-07 05:37:00,0,Don't buy anything that wasn't made in canada!!!
