509367,Guest,2000-08-03 11:06:00,0,I have schedualed a week long trip to a lodge On Lake Nippissing. I was curious if any one has fished this area of onterio. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
509368,Guest,2000-09-21 10:13:00,0,"Fished the west arm of nippising for 6 years, we almost always use lead jigs, jig just off the bottom, using small minnow, we have never had much luck using anything else, hits are very light, you gotta get the ""feel"" of the hit. our biggest catch is a 10 pounder"
509369,Ed,2000-09-21 13:03:00,143,"Hi:I've fished the west arm of the lake, Cache Bay to the NW, and the French River to the south. At this time of the year, I've had this luck:French River: good luck with 'eyes (and some northerns, white bass, and perch). In 30 - 50 feet of water or so. Vertical jigging and casting jigs. Pretty heavy jigs - 3/8 to about 1/2 oz, white or chartreuse - tipped with minnows. ""Bites"" are light as a Love-Bird's peck on the cheek.Cache Bay: good luck with jumbo perch around some of the islands. On Swedish Pimples tipped with crawlers. Cache Bay (and a bunch of the West Arm) is very weedy, so look for the channel cuts). BTW: I believe that duck season opened this week (9/18) and Cache Bay is a popular hunting spot, so try to avoid the #4 shot. Tight lines, Ed."
509370,Guest,2000-09-27 18:19:00,0,Thanks for the info guys. We had a great time in Canada. We stayed at Casa Blanca lodge on the French River. The fishing was pretty assome. We fished all over the french river and several of the islands where the french dumps into Nippising. Did well on pike with spinnerbaits and cranks over weed beds. Caught several (50)nice walleye trolling at night. We will definatly be back next year.
