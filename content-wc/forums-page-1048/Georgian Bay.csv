Other friends went this year too, different places north and south and: same-o-same-o! We were fishing out of Pointe Au Baril.The French has been suffering for YEARS!! Where to suggest going? I haven't a clue except for Wisconsin, Minnesota or Erie - honest! We fished the St. Lawrence the previous two years - skunked!Sorry, I wish I could point you in the right direction for Canada.RANGER"
