509919,Jim Carroll,2000-10-03 17:41:00,1665,"The last two years I have stayed at the Birchwood Motor Inn because of lack of vacancies at the Papertown and the Manitou. The Birchwood is approximately 25 mins from Pine Falls and is located on the highway to Grand Beach. I have their telephone number but I hesitate to post it because I'm not sure if its current. Someone with access to a MB phone book should post their number. Its another option as it is getting more difficult every year to secure reservations up there. I have stayed at all three motels- if you want to hang out with other fisherman try to get into the Papertown. The Manitou Lodge was, when I stayed there three years ago, by far the nicest. Great rooms and food. The Birchwood is adequate. Another alternative would be the Daerwood in Selkirk although the drive will cut into your fishing time. But you would also have the option to fish the cruddy Red. JC"
