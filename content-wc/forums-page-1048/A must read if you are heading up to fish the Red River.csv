509958,Guest,2000-10-08 00:03:00,0,"Just a short quick post.....if you are heading up this way, my advice to you all is to REALLY consider going to Pine Falls / Wpg River. The fishing there right now is UN-REAL ! Many (& I mean many) big ones are being caught & released. Friends from Omaha are up right now & they in the past 5 days have caught well over 35 fish that were over 9lbs. Their biggest to date has been a 14lb.They spent 1 day on the Red, biggest there was 6lbs.I know, sounds like a fish story.......but this is so true !Red has been producing fish, but not like PF.Good FishenRob"
509959,dogfish,2000-10-08 13:12:00,9,"Going up there with some buddies 10-15 thru 10-21. How have they been catching them? Are they pulling cranks out in the bay or primarily jigging in river. We didn't have really any luck in the river last year. Most everything we caught out in the bay either trolling or jigging the reefs. Is everyone playing bumper boats yet, or isn't the traffic to bad? Thanks for any info.P.S Must be cold as ##### up there right now, sounds like it's suppose to warm up towards middle of this week.dogfish"
509960,Guest,2000-10-08 18:47:00,0,The winnipeg is packed with boats playing bumper to bumper - mainly because of the tournament being held this weekend as well as next. The fish are going good eventhough the pressure remains strong. Good luck!

509964,Todd_NE,2000-10-11 15:33:00,1330,"We trolled various cranks, Shad Raps and Deep Jerks were the best. But lots worked. Our key was staying away from the packs (though they found you after the net tipped a few times) and really keying in on the schools of fish on the channel edge that came up to feed (12-15'). We really had the linecounters programmed and did a few other things that may have made a difference, sorry for the suspense, but some things are a secret.... Good trollers won't have a problem, just hope you have a big water boat.Heard the river was getting better, we fished the bay about halfway to Devils Island for the biggest fish. We never jigged, but that would have worked fine too I'm sure.As to the fish story part, we should have written it all down, I'm not bragging, trust me, but we easily got 50 fish over 26"" in my boat alone, not counting the other boat with us, and an even dozen 10# (28"" or so up there) or better. What a fishery....Now I'm hoping someone took a better pic of my 14#, I got my film back and the tail has been mysteriously chopped off my fish in all the pics. Camera class for the guys with me next year!!!! Two other guy's rolls of film to go though... Pray for me and the missing white spot, lol.todd"
509965,dogfish,2000-10-11 17:24:00,9,"Todd, Thanks for the info. Line counter reels are great once you get into them. Going to fish for seven days this year 10-15 thru 10-21. Should give us a variety of weather conditions and a many big piggies'. Last year was kind of slow, only two fish over 10#. Sounds like it's going to be great this year though. I just signed up for a local internet provider in Pine Falls so I can check mail and give the guys here a little play by play daily fish report, should be fun. If anyone's interested company's name is Sympatico.In the states dial (877)638-3672 if that doesn't work (204) 941-4391. In Manitoba dial (800)773-2121. They have local access numbers in both Pine Falls and Lac du Bonnet. Rates are reasonable, $10.00 for 30 hours. Thanks again,dogfish"
