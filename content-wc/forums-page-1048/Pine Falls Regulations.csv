509939,Ron,2000-10-06 21:22:00,387,"The discussion regarding tournament regulations has gotten quite interesting. Valid points are being made from both sides of the fishing community. The way I read it, the tournament (any tournament) must abide by provincial regulations and limits. ""General Limits"" listed on page 9 of the anglers guide pertaining to the southern division dictate that only one pickerel may exceed 55cm. (or 22 inches). Page 16 says that ""anglers may keep only 1 walleye longer than 70 cm. (28 in.) per year. Licence holders who catch and keep one of these fish must immediately record the date on the back of their licence."" The issue of whether or not the 28 in. or larger fish counts toward your possession during transport and release after weigh-in, is clearly addressed on page 9 under ""limits and possession...Fish are considered to be in possession if they are not IMMEDIATELY released into the water from which they were taken."" So, if I am to read the regulations correctly, as a tournament angler fishing the Winnipeg River on the downside of the Pine Falls Generating Station, I can only bring to the weigh-in station ONE FISH PER DAY OVER 22 INCHES, and the remaining quota can be filled with fish under that size. If I catch a walleye over 28 inches,and am going to weigh it in the competition, I must immediately sign the back of my licence, even if that fish is held in the livewell for release after weigh-in. This eliminates my chance of weighing in another 28 inch plus fish the next day, or in fact later the same day. If memory serves me correctly, the one fish over 22 inches, and the 28 inch signing, were not in effect last season, ( for the Winnipeg River). Is this correct?? Anyway, it would seem to me that the tournament officials, the anglers and the Conservation Officers are going to have themselves a busy weekend trying to insure strict adherence to these rules. Best of luck to those vying for this years honors!!!!!"
509940,Backwater Eddy,2000-10-07 04:28:00,3871,EXACTLY!:)
509941,Guest,2000-10-07 08:12:00,0,These rules were not in effect last year. This I know as my partner and I won the tournament last year. I am really concerned what Kim is going to do ??All I want is fairness for all involvedLawrence
509942,Backwater Eddy,2000-10-07 20:19:00,3871,"Stu McKay (Cats on the Red Classic) needed to add boat weigh in teams on the water to keep in the new guidelines for possession and still alow the tournament anglers the chance to weigh in several big fish. Otherwise if you bring a trophy fish into the boat or live well it's yours, no more piggy's, done deal! No live wells were ever used in that event, they were checked daily. Fish were kept in a net boat side tell weighed then promptly released after being issued a weight slip.The weigh in boat routine worked very well as they had 8 spread out in different sections, no long waits to speak of, very fair and healthy fast releases. Good system if you ask me? ""Backwater Eddy"""
509943,Ron,2000-10-08 12:04:00,387,"Without a doubt, the system put in place by Stu in the catfish tourney was the best answer to these regulations. It allows the anglers to concentrate their skills on catching the big fish, thus maintaining an ""excitement"" about the tournament. It comes down to the LARGEST TOTAL CATCH, otherwise the ability to only weigh in one fish over 28 inches per angler during the tourney, almost gives the tournament first prize to the largest single fish. Most of the fishermen in the tournament are skilled enough to be able to catch the remaining limit of near 22in>>> fish to fill their quotas."

509927,Guest,2000-10-04 15:30:00,0,"I guess by posting my original reminder, I have prompted lots of discussion on regs as they apply to tournaments. The following will hopefully clarify some questions-any person catching a fish over 28"" will need the licence signedthis will apply against that persons ability to retain one fish over 22"" that day.-no fish will be transported to the up side of Powerview generating station\-all sport fishing regulations apply-barbless hooks, carrying licence on person, size limits as well as annual limit of over 28""-One reply mentioned transporting a fish the second day if you have already signed your licence the previous day, the signing the licence only allows you one fish over 28"" a year, not a day!as for any other questions on how to bend the rules, I can only say they will likely be against the law in some form or other.These laws are part of the tournament conditions which the organizers apply for from Manitoba Conservation, and agree to by signing their tournament permit. Please respect these regulations and the organizers integrity."
509928,Guest,2000-10-04 17:29:00,0,"I will just read my VCR instructions, they make more cents then the reg's do.:)"
509929,Chad,2000-10-05 06:34:00,3523,"What are the tournament promotors going to do about the one over 28 per year? Will they just limit everyone to fish under 28"". This would seem most fair since some of the anglers will have used up their one over 28. It does not seem fair that a team would be limited because they already boated their 28+ and the others have not. Need to make the tournament a level playing field.I am not complaining about the regs at all. Just stating my concerns for the tournament."
509930,Guest,2000-10-05 08:40:00,0,"I HAVE A SIMILAR CONCERN WITH THE TOURNAMENT.....IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE STICKY ABOUT THE LICENCE SIGNING. WHAT'S TO STOP ONE GUY BOATING A FISH OVER 28 INCHES SIGNING HIS LICENCES AND THEN HE CATCHES ANOTHER ONE...IS IT LEGAL TO GIVE IT TO THE PARTNER AND HE CAN SIGN HIS LICENCE AS IT WILL BE THE ""OTHER GUY"" NOW IN POSSESSION OF A +28"" WALLEYE.I GUESS MY QUESTION IS ...IS THE 28"" APPLY TO THE GUY WHO CAUGHT THE FISH OR THE ONE ""KEEPING"" IT?"
509931,Chad,2000-10-05 13:04:00,3523,"I really dont see that as a problem. I think you could get by with each person claiming one. Maybe not totally leagal but you could get away with it. The problem I have is a team could get penalized if they caught and kept two 28"" last week. Now they have already marked their lic and have to toss anything over 28 back. It would seem fair to me that they say no fish over 28"" will be weighed. Heck, a 26"" does over 8lbs anyway."
509932,Guest,2000-10-05 21:53:00,0,"Mr Aitken:I have to question your wording of the rules for Pine Falls. This is a DIRECT quote from the Manitoba Anglers Guide 2000.

My honest opinion is to let all fish count. Just go by total weight. Then there is NO problem with the possibility of fowl play. This particular body of water has a very healthy fish population and if you look back, the mortality rate is extemely low.Lets all have fun, but, things MUST be fair.Lawrence"
509936,chrism,2000-10-06 06:29:00,429,"LawrenceRegarding the 22"" fish, that is a province wide slot limit listed under the fish limits. Anglers are allowed to keep one Walleye over 22"" per day towards their limit. As for the rest of the stuff being discussed for the tournament, well..., uh,...The message I get is that if you have a walleye in your livewell (which is in your possession)it is considered kept. For example, If it is 28"" and over, you must sign your license. If you have a 28"" in your livewell then you can not have anything else over 22"", as that ""over 22""""slot is taken. If your licence is already signed from a previous outing, then you are sh*t outta luck and the person who just bought a new licence is already one up on you.Another example:If you have a (one)26"" fish in your livewell, then you can only keep those under 22"" because again, you only are allowed one over 22"" in your possession. However, I guess you could catch a 26"" race back and have it weighed, release it and go back out and get another one. Hmmmm........This system works great for conservation, but it does pose a real pain in the a** for a tournament. Are you only allowed to weigh in the dailt limit of four fish? I suspect so.How many trips to the wiegh -in are you allowed to make? What goes on in other tournaments who's lakes have slot limits? There must be a better way to make it more fair to all involved - I'll be out there fishing for fun this weekend watching all of you people do your thing - Have a good time and most of all, Good luck in the tourney!"
509938,Backwater Eddy,2000-10-06 07:17:00,3871,"I finally see the picture!See the team, or teams, who buy 8 license will win, that's how pocket book conservation works!Simple HUH?BE.................><,>"
509937,Chad,2000-10-06 08:36:00,3523,"In the past they did allow you to make multiple early weigh in runs. The fish you weighed in could not be upgraded. What this rule allows you to do is weigh in more than just 2 fish over 22"" since you can only have 2 per team in possession at any time. Also, I believe you have the correct interpretation of the ""kept"" definition. Once in well it stays there and is considered kept! Being a catch and release or not does not matter. If it did they would just allow you to cull and I know that is not going to happen."
