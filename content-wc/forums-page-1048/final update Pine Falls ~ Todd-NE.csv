All of them set personal bests, both on the water & off the water.(inside joke):-OThe fish were big & plenty. Congrats to all, congrats to Todd for upping his PB to 14lbs. Everyone will be glad to know that there is now going to be some fine wall mounts down in Nebraska .........all replica's. Class act from these gents in releasing all that they caught, so that one day these fish will become 18's.

Rob called me a few nights before we headed up and gave me a tip on an area out in Traverse the he jigged and hammered them on. When we arrived after driving 12 hours non-stop 7pm - 7 am we were disappointed to be greeted with 25 mph wind and 35 deg temps. We got out to the mouth of the river and just saw white tipped chocolate milk. I decided what the ____ and we took off airborne to the bay. Getting to his spot, we trolled down wind and cross wind (that was fun, noooooot).We trolled various cranks, Shad Raps and Deep Jerks were the best. But lots worked. Our key was staying away from the packs (though they found you after the net tipped a few times) and really keying in on the schools of fish on the channel edge that came up to feed. We really had the linecounters programmed and did a few other things that may have made a difference, sorry for the suspense, but some things are a secret....Rob was kind enough to put us on the fish, provide a grill for some aged Nebraska Ribeyes, defend on honor on the boat ramp occupied by morons who thought docks are for holding boats an hour at a time, and pointing out local landmarks.We died on the Red, it was just awful, although a few people did ok there, NOTHING like the 'Peg though.I always improve when I fish, but this is truly the first trip where I was just staggered by the fishing.Todd"
