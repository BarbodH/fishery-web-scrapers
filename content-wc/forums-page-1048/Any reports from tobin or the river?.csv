510009,BillyBigFish,2000-10-09 09:57:00,31,"I just got back Sat. I fished the river, it was very cold and windy. 3 guys fishing for 1 week we only caught 26 fish total. 8 fish over 24 with 2 in the 30"" range. Not a very good week for that area this time of year. Some people trolling cranks some live baiting. Fish were caught both ways."
