510016,Steve W.,2000-10-10 07:22:00,99,I'm heading to Pine Falls in about 2 weeks and would like to know if there is a reliable source for good minnows in or near town. Also are plastics or crankbaits a good option at this time of year? Thanks in advance for any help you can give. Steve W.
510017,Chad,2000-10-10 12:16:00,3523,"They have minnows at the Papertown Inn and also at the Clark store on the corner.Another good option is stopping at Pro Am Tackle in Winnipeg on your way thru. Boris, the owner is a great guy. You will want to bring cranks. #8 & #9 Shad raps in firetiger, clown, silver, pearl."

Steve W. >Pro-Am In Winnipeg best location to buy Minnows , Pinefalls town at this time of year not reliable to have bait in stock. Pro-Am locate on Nairn ave 1 block from Hwy 59."
510020,Hawgeye,2000-10-11 22:01:00,1355,"I thought that Boris's ProAm shop is on Regent avenue? I have been going there for years and don't recall ever seeing a Nairn Avenue. I do however agree that it is difficult to trust what bait is in Pine Falls. They have been improving their minnow stock every year and When I was there last weekend the Papertown Motor Inn had fairly good minnows. However, I still stop in and see Boris and give him my business since he has the best minnows around and he always gives good truthful reports. I say, go see Boris!"
510021,chrism,2000-10-12 06:44:00,429,hawgeyeDid you have a good trip?Nairn and Regent in Winnipeg are essentially the same street - called different names on the east/west side of 59 hwy.
510022,Hawgeye,2000-10-12 11:41:00,1355,"I looked at my map and I see that you are correct Chrism. Had a great trip! 5-8 pounders were the norm and though we didn't catch any +10's on this trip, we did have sore wrists. We did see a lot of 12's and I even seen a boat that picked up 2 over 14. (I know they were that size because my brother in law knows the fisherman, no fish story!!) How have you been doing up there? I will be back on the 19th through the 22nd and I am just chompin' at the bit to get back! Gotta top my PB of 12lb 14oz."
