509967,Guest,2000-10-08 12:16:00,0,Hi folks. Have just posted day one's results for the Pine Falls International Walleye Classic. I'll be setting up to go online tonight at the awards dinner and ceremony at the Papertown Motel. The idea to help you and the tournament fisherfolk make posts to the Winnipeg River Bulletin Board. We'll see how it goes ;-)The St. Georges Voyageur's (tournament organisers) website is at www.virtualnorth.com/walleye/ and follow the links to the Winnipeg River Bulletin.
