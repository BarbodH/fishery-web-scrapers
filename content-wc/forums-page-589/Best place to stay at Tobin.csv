1079009,28shooter,2009-02-06 10:05:00,195,I was wondering if anyone knows of the best place to stay at Tobin lake.
1079026,oldblue2008,2009-02-06 11:37:00,313,"Depends on if you are fishing Tobin, or the river. I have stayed here a couple times, which is just outside the regional park, and handy if you are fishing the river. cabins are good, price is reasonablehttp://www.macswaneyscabins.com/ also site for Nipawinhttp://www.nipawin.com/index.php"
1079031,28shooter,2009-02-06 11:56:00,195,which has better fishing the river or lake
1079060,uzzi,2009-02-06 14:55:00,349,"Totally depends on time of year and what you're targeting! There's a few places right at the resort village of Tobin Lake too, which is part way into the ""lake"" section of the river. Tobin Lake Resort has numerous cabin style accomodations, and the Shorebird Inn is right on the water in front of the ramp. It's a hotel, a couple years old. As well, Silvertip outfitters has cabins, etc as well to stay. Depends on what you're looking for.......hotel or lodge. I've never been inside any of the cabins, but my preference for cabins would be SilverTip over Tobin Lake Resort Anothe real nice spot is Pruden's Point resort straight across the lake from the resort village. They have 1 big cabin there thats awesome for a big group. River section seems to be hottest early spring and late fall, but can catch most any time in the river. Lake is very good as well, spring and into late summer. After late summer the bigger eyes seem to disappear from the lake, likely making their way up the river to eat! Pike fishing out on the ""flats"" is a lot of fun toohttp://www.prudenspointresort.ca/http://www.tobinlakeresort.com/ Can't find a link for the Shorebird. MacSwayney's is a nice choice for right in Nipawin, very close to the river, and nice cabins. As well, many hotels in Nipawin are fisherman friendly, with locked compounds and lots of power to plug into"
