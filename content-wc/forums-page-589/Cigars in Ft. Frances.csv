1077155,Guest,2009-01-29 19:48:00,0,Anyone know a place in Ft. Frances or on the way to Sioux Lookout that has a good selection of good cigars?
1077206,JDP,2009-01-30 06:06:00,1457,"I wish I could be sure that the selections are""good"" (I don't smoke) but I know of 2 places that advertise Cuban sea-gars: 1) A little shop on the north side of the Scott Street/Hwy 11 a block or two east of the Safeway store in Fort Frances. I don't know the name but they always have a white reader-board sign that says ""Cuban Cigars"" outside near the curb. 2) Also the Great Bear Store which is 11-12 miles east of Fort Frances on Hwy 11.http://www.thegreatbear.ca/ JDP"
1077256,uncle,2009-01-30 08:29:00,3,The Queen St. Laundry and Convenience Store in Dryden is only 3 blocks out of your way going through town. I just phoned them and their selection of Cuban cigars runs from $4.99 to $34.99 each.

Unless its improved its not worth the stop. Your allowed to bring up to 50 cigars per person so stock up with one of the on-line cigar retailers. I have a spare humidor that I bring in the vehicle to keep them moist, then transfer to a couple of large zip lock bags and keep covered in a cool spot. They should stay moist for 3 to 4 days, but you can always get small gel packs to put in the bags. I leave a few in the humidor for the drive home - just be prepared to answer 101 questions on where you got the cigars if the US border patrol sees the humidor sitting on the back seat!"
1079408,cowboyd,2009-02-08 11:51:00,33,"I have smoked cigars for 40 years and unless you get really lucky almost all the local shops have either old and dried out originals or knock offs. Now before I am taking to task that is just a generalization and of course there can be exceptions. I take 25 cigars with me when I go and declare them going and as well as any I haven't smoked on the way back. Just tell them when you return that you have____ cigars you bought in your home city and are returning with them. The only problem I ever had was with a new custom's agent who thought she hit the smuggler jackpot when I told her I had cigars and wanted to not only see them but called over her supervisor. He asked where I bought them, then smiled at me, thanked me and said we could be on our way. I couldn't help but notice the small discussion he seemed to be having with her as we pulled away. For my money take what you like with you and just be upfront going and coming. I don't think you will have any problems.Dick"

1079666,Guest,2009-02-09 13:03:00,0,The guy that runs Ryden's duty free shop.(I think his name is Mike) is a cigar afficianado.If you go up that way he can hook you up good.If he knows you are coming(we usually call in advance) he likes to trade.
