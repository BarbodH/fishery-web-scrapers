1080947,lassh,2009-02-14 05:59:00,553,"I fished Carroll last year and am going back in June. It is a large lake for a flyin, probably 12 miles east to west and 7 or 8 miles north to south at some locations. The flow is east to west with multiple inflows. The major outflow is the Gammon River in Manitoba. The vast majority of the lake is in Ontario in the Woodland Caribou Provencial Park. Only a couple western most bays and the outlet to the Gammon River are in Manitoba. If you plan to fish over there, you will also need a Manitoba license. If you stay at Showalter's, you won't need a Manitoba license. There are no lake trout, only walleye and northern. There is a great diversity of structure, depth, current etc. You can't come close to fishing the whole lake in a week. The one drawback to this lake is that there are 2 commercial camps on the lake, but at least 2 or 3 private camps on the lake. So you are not alone. There are also some camps on the Gammon River that may be able to access Carroll. So you will see other boats, sometimes multiple boats in certain areas. The walleye fishing was good. Everyone in our group caught at least a 26 incher. We didn't get any 30's but had one just under 29 and a 28 1/2. We didn't get any trophy pike, but they are in there. If you want more info, drop me an email."
