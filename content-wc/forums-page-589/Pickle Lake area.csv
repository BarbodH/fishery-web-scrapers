I did a search and found alot of info about the walleye fishing but not much about the northern pike fishing. Can any of you that have been up there share some of your expieriences? I am not looking for your hotspots, just a heads up of the gravel road condition, northern pike fishing, # of people fishing the area, ect... I was thinking of going to Mawley, Menako, Stirland or Horseshoe lake. I heard there is an old abandoned school on Stirland, anyone know if this is true? We take 14' boats and are not afraid to portage them to get away from the crowds. To me trying to get to other lakes and exploring is as much fun as the fishing."
