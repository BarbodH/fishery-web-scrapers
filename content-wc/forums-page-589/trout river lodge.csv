Recently he has been going for walleye (age has a way of slowing down the casting all day long activity) and has done well.

1069458,Guest,2008-12-20 17:03:00,0,Hey tackle man thanks for the info. What do you use jigs or pull spinners.
1069589,tackleman,2008-12-21 16:11:00,444,"I generally use spinners, (hammered brass, Hammered silver, pink, black&white, purple, blue) but recently I tried jigging and had some success but I'm really a novice at jigging.a lot of the guys I see from the states are using Lindy rigs and jigging, a few use crank baits for walleye but up here the best thing touse is live bait.Hey budm, we're coming your way in january, we will be at jack & bonnies from jan 8 to 18. greg and jenny willl be there too.Oh yes, we got ice, thanks for rubbing it in, it has been at least 20 degrees below normal for the past 2 weeks and it has been brutal. I didn't want to go south in january but after this cold spell, I'm counting the days."

I like to use bottom bouncers with spinners and minnows'for walleyes. number 5 meps, musky killers, and suspending crankbaits work well for pike."
