Never stayed in Chapleau but have many times in Timmins. If you have to go through Timmins to get home your best bet would be to stay there. The Travelodge is nice but there are a lot of hotels/motels in Timmins to choose from. If you stay in Timmins be sure to book ahead as there are times that the city is full, and it's hard to get rooms.http://www.yellowpages.ca/search/si/...ns/rci-TimminsThere are a couple places in Chapleau but no clue at to what they're like. http://www.lodging-ontario.com/cgi/s...rthern-Ontario"
