1081368,GNO,2009-02-15 22:04:00,153,I am assuming you guided on Pipestone from your user name. Where did you work and when were you up there? We have one of the outposts that Happy Landing used to own. It is located just to the East of Gates Ajar / Pivot Point area. Shoot me an email and I can ger more info if you want on the arm cabin.[email protected]

I fished the lake last year during July, but only caught two walleye. The water is extremely clear on Pipestone, and it doesn't have the best numbers around, but the walleye are typically bigger than usual. I was wondering if anyone has experience fishing the lake, especially in early to mid September. I've heard that big shiners can be pretty good to use that time of year, but I really don't have much experience fishing with them. Any tips on the lake would be much appreciated. Thanks. Nathan"

Working the reefs and humps with lindy rigs and leeches or crawlers usually works well. Where are you staying at? One of the biggest things for fishing walleyes on Pipestone are the spots and time of day for fishing them. Some spots tend to only produce good at different times of day."

1049776,GNO,2008-08-17 07:10:00,153,The walleye fishing has picked up now from earlier in the spring. The last group that was up did very well on walleye and smallmouth. The live bait is a big key to the walleye fishing on Piipestone. I usually do best with Lindy rigs.
1049906,Outfitter17,2008-08-17 21:05:00,127,"Pipestone Lake has come back big time in the past couple of years for walleyes, There are some really good reefs in the north arm, just outside thompson bay, and in schistose lake. I never really had good luck for walleyes down on the main stretch on pipestone around pipestone lodge.If you need some good spots, just e-mail me."
1049951,Bill Krejca,2008-08-18 07:23:00,6107,"Some years ago (maybe 30?), we camped in Pipestone, near the entrance to Shistose. Although we didn't do well on walleyes, we did pretty well on lake trout in Shistose. As I remember, we got them casting in fairly deep water, not too far inside the lake from Pipestone, used 3/4 oz jigs, red head, white bucktail. The bottom was smooth, either sand or marl, you might want to give it a try. Good luck, Bill Krejca"
1050915,Guest,2008-08-22 12:41:00,0,"On one of the lodge maps I see that there is a good sized reef marked for walleye up in the English/James Bay area, would that be one of the reefs you're talking about? Last year we never really got up to fish Schitose or the northwest arm of Pipestone, so that area is still relatively unknown to me. I would appreciate any tips I could get though. Thanks. Nathan"
1051133,GNO,2008-08-23 18:33:00,153,You should be targeting the NW Arm and Schistose for walleyes on Pipestone. The reefs in and around James Bay are pretty good and the Gates Ajar area is good in the fall for walleyes also.
1081357,pipestoneguide,2009-02-15 20:40:00,1,i love fishing schistose i used to live up on pipestone and i'm trying to get up there this summer. Does anyone know a contact for happy landing lodge's old outpost on the northwest arm?
