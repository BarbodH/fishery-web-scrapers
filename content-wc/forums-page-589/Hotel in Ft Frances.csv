1079378,Jahloaf,2009-02-08 09:55:00,74,Can anybody tell me what the name of the hotel is that was once the Red Dog? The name must have changed cause I cannot find it when searching .... Any info would be great.Stayed there 3 years ago and enjoyed the bar for refreshments and hot wings on our way to Minaki area.

1079402,cowboyd,2009-02-08 11:25:00,33,We use either Rusty or Northern for flyouts every fall but over the years we have enjoyed more staying on the I Falls side in the Holiday Inn etc. IMHO much better choice of resturants!Dick

1079690,Jahloaf,2009-02-09 14:18:00,74,"Yeah, I remember!There are not too many toilets between Ft Frances and Kenora.Hey Iowa boy, have you spoken to the Playa lately? Wondering if will be at the Dog this year. Certainly fun to throw down a few adult beverages with old friends and talk about past fishing trips."
1079755,Iowa Farm Boy,2009-02-09 17:57:00,44,"The Palya is out this year. He says it is his job and the economy. I don't quite understand him. Between him and his wife they are pulling in almost $200K, three vehicles paid for and less then $50K left tp pay on his house. I don't think he has the seeds to ask his wife if he can go!"
1079842,Glenman12,2009-02-10 06:34:00,762,about 5 years ago we stayed at the Super 8 next to the Dog..stopped in the bar for some food and drinks..all of us having mixed drinks thought they were either watered down or made extremely weak..maybe thats changed with the name change
1079862,Guest,2009-02-10 07:33:00,0,Love the Red Dog. We stay at Super 8 and walk over for a few drinks. Last year it got quite interesting the later it got.
1079886,Jahloaf,2009-02-10 08:27:00,74,"The last time I think we did stay at the 8 and walked over to the Dog.About 1:30am after quite a few Crystals we decided to stop buy the truck and boat to make a sandwitch, thats when the local police officer pulled in and started asking questions. We must have been quite a site, one buddy was just babbling away. It was nice to know that the police pay close attention to the travelers stuff so that no monkey business goes on. My buddy the Playa was paying the locals $40 to draw pictures of the three of us, that was a waste of $120 but it made for some pretty funny stories later the next day"
