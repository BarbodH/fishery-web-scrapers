1079482,geraldh,2009-02-08 19:03:00,6,Thank you for the responseyes its the one thru Nestor falls fly ini have fished Kay lake the last three years but that is the only placeI am 65 and my son 40 are going may 21-26 this yeari saw the map they had on the Internet for the lakewould you be willing to add your suggestions to the main lake and to either of the portages.what kind of lures you you use and what are the prim fishi have just started fishing again many many years. are black flies a problem in late mayfish early in the day --late or make any difference?on Kay lake we fished for small mouth bass and caught some muskie we fished in the middle of the lake for trout and caught quite a number fishing with lead jigs at what ever level the depth finder showed them. i was surprised Because if you found them they were easy to catch. any advice would be appreciatedthanksGerald henningJoplin Missouri
1079560,JOELP,2009-02-09 07:08:00,4,"Hi Gerald.The map on the internet has several good spots marked and once you try those spots and are successful, you should be able to find many more spots with the same conditions. The main lake has walleye and northern. No smallmouth or muskie this far north. We spend most of our time trolling for walleye with jigs/twister tails or jigs/minnows in 5' - 8', focusing on shoreline points, dropoffs, and mid-lake reefs with that 5' - 8' depth. You'll be there about a month before us so you may find them at a different depth. As for lures...there are times when minnows seem to produce better than plastic but we have never had trouble catching good numbers on the twister tails. We're not early risers so most of our fishing is done during the day and into the late evening, until just after dark. The best fishing for us seems to be in the evening. We've talked to other groups that do most of there fishing at night and have been successful so I don't think you'll have trouble catching fish when it meets your schedule.The first couple years, we spent a lot of time at the far portage lake because the walleye ran a little larger, but the last few years we haven't been able to find a lot of fish over there. We've tried the first portage lake a few times but have never been able to catch anything so we don't even try any more. The far portage lake is very deep in spots (100'+) and does have lake trout. In May I would expect you could find them shallow if you want try for the trout. We caught a couple in there last year when we were fishing for walleye.We don't spend a lot of time targeting northern but when we do, we focus on the spots marked on the map and throw large Mepps spinners. Every year we manage to catch as many as we want and usually get at least two over 40"". We've been lucky and haven't had problems with black flies on our June trip so I wouldn't expect you to have problems in May. Of course if we have a warm spring, that could change.I think you'll really enjoy this lake. We've seen bear, moose, caribou, lots of loons & eagles. We really enjoy the solitude of having the only cabin on the lake and the fishing for us has been fantastic. We've had days where our group of 4 has caught almost 400 fish and one year we had over 1,700 for our week. We've yet to crack the 30"" mark on walleye but each year we get several over 25"". Catch and release has been very good for this lake.Good Luck and let me know if I didn't cover anything you're intersted in."
1079625,geraldh,2009-02-09 10:31:00,6,I have a company that sells large industrial boilers and my son works for me. I just printed off your response and took it down the hall to his office. Were still mulling it over. Next month we are going to a lake in Texas (lake fork) and have a guide (tom redman??) for a day and we will see if we can learn something. i am still trying to keep the line from turning into a ball of twine after each cast. actually i bought one of the reels that has a chip in and measure the rotation and that helped a lot. if your not trolling have you used top water plugs if so what kind and colorif the fish might be shallower in May do you think we might try casting into shallow areas. if so again an idea of colors or types of lure--spinner--buzz bait--jig etcAlso I havent figured out where the lake is accept 180 miles from Nestor falls.on Kay lake or perhaps any fly in we have learned to cut the amount of food you take in by 50% each year and are starting to get a Little more realistic. its like we think the plane will forget us and we need a years worth of supplies.I did get a fold up fish net because after catching some large muskies last year and not have a good way to get them in the boat a net was on the top of the list for this yeartanks againGerald
1080136,JOELP,2009-02-11 07:23:00,4,"Gerald,The lake is roughly 60 miles NW of Red Lake. The GPS coodinate of the cabin is N51.46.06 W094.22.63. You can use a program like Google Earth to find the location and actually get pretty good satellite picture of the lake.Like I said, we spend most of our time trolling but do occasionally sit and cast an area that seems to have fish. We don't use any top-water plugs as the walleye are bottom-dwellers. We use primarily jigs and twister tails (3"" or 4"") but also have had good luck on crankbaits that dive to the 5-8' range. In-line spinners (Mepps) also work but we do best on just the simple jig and twister tail. For us, the color is generally dark (black, dark green) or bright (chartruese, orange, white, yellow, pink). The bite will tell you if dark or bright is the pattern of the day. Of course, you may find the fish have a differnet preference in mid-May vs. mid-June.We've been doing this a while and think we have things figured out for fishing this lake in June, packing, meeting the weight limit, and I can share details on that but it's probably not of interest to everyone so feel free to send me a private messsage on here and I'll get back to you."
