1079991,Steve of Madison,2009-02-10 16:03:00,230,"the summer before last in July at Onaway on LS, we were up late playing poker and around midnight when I ran out of money I walked out on the boat dock to see an amazing display that lasted well over an hour. Well worth all the money I lost."
1080547,snaggletooth,2009-02-12 17:20:00,135,"Ya Hey, This is the website that predicts Aurora activity:http://www.spaceweather.com/ The people who own the LOTW camp that we visit reside in Winnipeg. They say they see auroras in Winnipeg frequently during the winte. With avg nite-time temps around minus 20 Fahrenheit, few watch them very long!"
1079491,AllenW,2009-02-08 19:18:00,11482,"While I've been fortunate enough to have seen some pretty impressive northern lights, my wife has yet to see anything other than very minor lights, not much to see normally here in middle Minn. I'm thinking of taking her up to the Red Lake area for a few days fishing but would like her to see something other than a pale wisp of them.Is there a time of year they are more dominate?Or is it catch as can?tiaAl"

1079576,phishfearme,2009-02-09 07:50:00,1242,"fall is better than summer only because there's more darkness. going up in june/july when there's only 4 hour of real darkness reduces the chance. otherwise, earth's seasons have nothing to do with the lights as they are driven by the sun's sunspot activity which some believe are on a 11 year cycle. the winter is clearly best since there's so much darkness but it's hard to stay outside to much. phish"
1079579,AllenW,2009-02-09 07:56:00,11482,"I didn't think they were predictable, but the fall thing makes sense, plus there ain't no bugs..Thanks.Al"
1079606,Pooch,2009-02-09 09:12:00,4619,"I remember there used to be a website that monitored sunspot activity and the upper atmosphere and would predict or at least give viewers a heads up as to when there would be increased activity. I lost the bookmark a couple of computers ago. Search around, it's probably still active. I think it was connected to NOAA. Pooch"

1079849,Obabikon,2009-02-10 06:54:00,2370,We see them pretty regularly in August. If you're afraid of the cold... as late as possible in the season.
1079864,Babamel2,2009-02-10 07:34:00,414,"About 5 years ago we were fortunate to see the Northern Lights fill about half of the sky. There was a line of lights that ran across the sky from East to west, then on the north side of that line there were others that flared up, then weakened. It was a once in a life time show."
