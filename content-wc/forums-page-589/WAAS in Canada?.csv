1080172,MartyT,2009-02-11 09:21:00,23,Looks like it should be widely available in Canada now.http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/...vember2007.pdf
1080386,Guest,2009-02-12 06:36:00,0,I experienced having no WAAS on Lake of the Woods last summer. I don't think it is available everywhere as the article suggests. Perhaps it's access is limited to aviation ?
1080515,freespoolin,2009-02-12 15:21:00,472,My WAAS always works on Lake of the Woods on my Lowrance Globalmap and LCX27c. To be honest I don't remember is WAAS worked on Red Lake but I do know I was getting a little as a 17' error.
1080858,triple t,2009-02-13 18:15:00,55,I can tell you from last summer WAAS near Skeet Island did not work. Hope they get the area covered soon as it is difficult traveling after dark with out it.
