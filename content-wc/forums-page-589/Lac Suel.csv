About 9 of us are beginning to discuss a trip for Canada in 08 to fish Lac Suel and just wanting to get a general idea of fishing tactics, success rate and so forth for the time of year we will be there which will be early to mid August. Many moons ago we went up and fished this same area about every other year but haven't been back since the late 80s early 90s. How is the fishing these days at this time of year, what baits, how deep, what about May flie hatch, whatever else you are willing to throw in?"

566622,Guest,2007-06-23 21:08:00,0,We fish every year the first weekend in August. We have very good fishing. We normally drag a jig with a half of crawler around points and go as deep as 24 at times. We start at 10 and work out till we get hits. We go in at Archies landing and to to Mawaki lodge. We sometimes use a bottom bouncer.

They were anywhere there was a change from sand to rock or vise versa, not necessarily on the points. We still had great fishing even though there was a mayfly hatch going on in some of the bays. Jigs with minnows or crawlers in anywhere from 4' - 14'. The fish went deeper as the week progressed. Some spots hit better in the afternoon and some hit better in the morning. Some areas the bait had to be minnows, others it didn't matter. I heard guys started to have luck on some of the rock piles closer to spawning areas; I never tried them. I'm heading back up in three weeks and will hit the rock piles then. I saw someone doing well with leaches, and I saw two guys catch a double with 2 - 24"" fish and the very next fish was 27"". The hooping and hollaring was fun to hear. Our biggest this year was 24"" and caught by my wife. Her brother caught a 36"" pike, and I was left with catching the most fish in and over the slot, just not THE biggest in either species. It was a good week."

We have always used jigs w/ live bait, crawlers, minnows, and leeches. I know others that pull plugs or lindy rigs, but I find too many snags where I'm at for those presentations. These posting boards are a good start for info as well as the resort you book at. They might not tell you all their secrets, but they want to keep you happy (and coming back!) so they are a great source. Andoverwalleyehunter: Is that Andover MN? I grew up near there and my Mom used to live there. Where on the west side of LS do you fish out of? My family and in-laws have been out of Golden Eagle Lodge for the past five years and usually fish early to mid-July. I would be interested to hear which area you fish, how long of runs, etc. Maybe we'll see you between the 14-22 July."
566827,reelman1,2007-06-30 12:12:00,276,"I just spent my first week up on Lac Seul and can't figure out why anybody would even bother with live bait up there. All the hassle of keeping them alive along with having to rebait constantly not to mention the expense. We had terrible weather the whole time up there and still managed to catch 50 - 75 walleyes per day per person using only 3"" GULP! ALIVE grubs."
