1078918,1shooter,2009-02-05 21:08:00,1493,We fish the Morson area ever year in the spring and love it. This past year we made a fall trip and tried a different resort. We are going to the same spot this spring but figured we will make the fall trip again and will mix it up again. This year we are thinking of Spruce Island. It is a few miles from the landing but what the **** it is a scenic drive. Any feedback on this camp would be appreciated.

1078936,smallfry,2009-02-06 00:10:00,9,"Like Obabikon said it is an excellent camp. Our group has been going there for 5yrs now and we can't imagine going anywhere else. The boat traffic is low, fishing is good all season long, we have gone at different times of the season over the years. Fall fishing is excellent especially once the lake has turned over. The area itself does have low boat traffic and is quiet and for when the weather is not so favorable there are lots of bays to hide out in or islands to hide behind close to camp.The camp is well maintained, and the cabins are very clean and comfortable. The owners and staff are great, friendly and always willing to do what they can for you.Have a great trip and yes it is a scenic boat ride, it's for sure a longer trip than some places but I think well worth the effort.One little tip, if you find that you have forgotten something, let them know right away as they only go to kenora once a week. If they have what you forgot on hand great, if not then they'll pick it up for you in town, providing of course they can get it there."

Obviously, we love the area and the camp and obviously the fishing can be great ( and always is, at least, good). Accomodations and service are great. The owners, Harv and Janna, do a great job of running the camp and making sure all have a great trip, short of changing the weather for you. If you decide on Spruce Island, PM me. I will give you all the help I can. I also can give you GPS coordinates for trip to the island. Marv"
