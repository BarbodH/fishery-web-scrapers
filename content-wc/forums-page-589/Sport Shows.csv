I can call and get a feel of what kind of person they are, I don't have to spend all that to find out. You can have the wool pulled over your eyes at the show or online. Research is key and so are references. I don't sit on the computer all day. I am out fishing, snowmobiling and doing the things I enjoy when I get a chance.........shows and big cities are not on that list. To each their own. I see you have alot of posts on here Obabikon, you need to get out and off the computer. My group guys will have our trip meeting after a day on the ice and fry up our fish and have some beers, alot better day for us than at the show and for about the same price."
1079847,Obabikon,2009-02-10 06:52:00,2370,"Guest, I stated in my post that ""I am one of the worst ones out there"" about being on the computer. I've spent $10 on much less enjoyable things, so it's not like you're out a ton. While, I do think the prices are getting too high on them, it's still pretty painless. A group meeting sounds like a fun time. And, an excellent way to get pumped about a trip. That said, several of the shows had EXCELLENT attendance this year. And, for me, they've more than paid for themselves. Which, is an easy way to justify doing them next year. Shows that are going down hill... Chicagoland and Kansas City NWShow... those two have gone from the HUGE shows that everyone remembers, to almost nothing. There was a time for those shows, but I do fear the time has past. They started to allow people like the shamwow to buy booths, and that was the beginning of the end. But, the all canada shows are great. Last night in Omaha the crowd was perfect all the way until close. It's also a help that everyone walking through the isle is going to Canada or thinking about going to Canada."
1079856,Glenman12,2009-02-10 07:26:00,762,"Shows that are going down hill... Chicagoland and Kansas City NWShow... "" Are you referring to the All Canada show in St Charles?..we worked a booth for our resort and thought the crowds were good..maybe not as much as in years past but still solid..and we booked more people than we had in years past..our owner thought it was a success..are you the grey haired gentleman?..went by your booth a few times and was going to stop in but you were busy with people..maybe next year"
1079867,Obabikon,2009-02-10 07:47:00,2370,No... the Chicagoland is not the Phesant Run show. The Chicagoland at Rosemont was the HUGE show that had tons of boats and booths 20 years ago. The Phesant Run show is and was awesome this and every year!
1079912,Glenman12,2009-02-10 10:30:00,762,Yes..the show in Rosemont is a pain..we did it for a few years..didnt get much out of it..I hear now that the parking costs almost as much as an entry ticket into the show..plus that long walk from the lot to the building
1080041,Guest,2009-02-10 19:13:00,0,"Shows are on the downhill no matter how you look at it. I believe the All Canada Show used to do alot more shows and elimated some of them and only kept their better ones, maybe I am wrong though. Did you do as much business as you used to at the shows? If they work for you, great, keep going. The operators I know say they are on the way out and some of the best operators I know have never done the shows and maintain a full camp."
1080070,v-bay gord,2009-02-10 20:34:00,3168,"Guest....don't kid yourself, nobody stays in business by doing no marketing. Some of the best operators do a lot of shows...others, like you point out may do few or none. Each picks what works best for them. Some are comfortable at shows and can ""sell"" their product.....others may prefer to highlight what they have in other ways.....it's a personal choice. As far as shows go, there are too many and too many that are poorly run. This will sort it self out as the poorly run shows disappear. The All Canada shows are well run and concentrate on what they do best....exhibiting Canadian operators. I think sport shows will always have a place in marketing fishing destinations, equipment, boats etc.... After all it's a great way in the dead of winter to remind ourselves that summer is on it's way!"
1080306,Guest,2009-02-11 18:25:00,0,"v-bay gord Shows are way to advertise, but if they do not bring in any new people it is not a big deal. Did you book alot of new guests at the shows? If not, then they don't pay unless they are a PR tool. If they are a PR tool, that is foolish to have them come down to visit, then they look at what everyone else offers and may end up at another lodge. Enjoy the shows."
1080389,v-bay gord,2009-02-12 06:46:00,3168,"Guest......I agree, if you are not generating business from shows then it is foolish to do them."
1080393,Obabikon,2009-02-12 07:12:00,2370,"But, lots of people still book groups at shows. From what I booked at 3 days of Omaha, I probably paid for all ten of our shows. It doesn't take huge crowds to book people, and certain shows have a lot of people walking through wanting to book. It's not for everyone. Some resorts remember the ""good ole days"" when it was the only way to market. That's not the case, now it's just one of many ways to market. So, traffic is down compared to 20 years ago... but, that means you have to do other things. You have to promote online and in person. The shows might be dead to some people, but (as I've seen this year and last) it's alive and well for a lot of people. I like personal selling. Face to face. Because, (no offense to other resorts) I honestly believe that I can say the right words and make the right comments in such a way that my resort seems more appealing than another's. You're right if you said the days of sitting in the booth and the sales coming to you are over. You have to work for it... and if you're not a good face to face seller, then another marketing technique might be better served."
1076649,Dan G,2009-01-28 06:08:00,31,"Have lived in Minnesota all my life. As a kid an growing up, (and still....honestly to me), the Northwest Sportshow was THE show to go to. I still remain a deer in headlights when I go. But, because I still feel like a kid in a candy shop....I like going. Had never really heard of the All-Canada show until recent years amazingly, since I love fishing. Smaller, but certainly enjoyed it. What are your experiences from the shows and others. And, does it help you decide where to go? For me, seems like I spend more on tackle than anything...ha, ha, ha. Dan"
1076662,Glenman12,2009-01-28 07:15:00,762,"Luckily for our group, we've been going to the same lodge for many many years so we dont have to decide...some of us work the Chicago All Canada show for the lodge and I know when I take a walk around it can be almost overwhelming for people who havent decided on a lodge yet..all I can refer to is the thread from ILScott where you have to set parameters of what your looking for in a lodge and stick to it..that way its much easier to whittle it down to only a few"
1076820,Adam Schlaeger,2009-01-28 18:39:00,4,"I agree with Glenman12, if you have been going to a lodge like I have for many years it doesn't offer much. however, I do believe it gives great insight to the rare Fly-in trips that one might take. Typically that is the only reason I go to the All-Canada show, to get information on Fly-in trips. Now the Sportsman show, is another thing, that is just a great time to see new equipment, the shows are awesome and the whole experience is something to see.Adam"
1078975,Steve of Madison,2009-02-06 07:44:00,230,"The All Canada show was here in Madison last week and it seems that many of the camps I expected to see were absent this year. I noticed only one from Lac Suel (south end), many more from Cedar Lake, Red Lake area, and Eagle. The usual from LOW. Interesting how the camps attending will change from year to year.Hello to OB, it was great to be able to talk to you in person!Rose...where are you? hope to hear from you again!!!"
1079010,Obabikon,2009-02-06 10:10:00,2370,"Steve, It was nice to meet you too! I thought very highly of the Madison show, and we've already made plans to do it again next year. Unfortunately for a lot of places, they have to choose to do different shows. They can only be in one place at a time. That often means picking the best of the shows that cross dates, or alternating shows every couple years. Sadly, show coordinators have a tough time getting open weekends, and often have to take what's available. Which means overlapping other shows."
1079275,Guest,2009-02-07 17:09:00,0,"The sportshows are a thing of the past, the internet has everything you need in finding a good place to go and you can it on your own time. The tackle can be nice to see at the show, but there are tons of great sporting good stores now a days. The only thing good about the shows is working the operators over for deals, especially with times like these. Most all will deal and you can save a bundle. I am sure some camp owner will jump on now and say that don't happen. Save the show admission and parking and put it towards a trip you find on the internet."
1079291,Obabikon,2009-02-07 18:13:00,2370,"Every camp works deals. However, I think it's important to go and meet the owners. If you don't like them, or they're not the kind of operators you're looking for, then that could easily ruin your trip. Also, GET OUT OF THE HOUSE!!! It gives you an excuse to get off of the computer and out from in front of the television... which is the point of your trip anyways. I'm one of the worst out there, but it's easy to see that soon ""fishing trips"" will be a thing of the past, because everything you need is on a computer. Just rent a game for $5. (I know that's extreme, but so is saying there's no point to the shows) The all canada shows are especially neat, because they serve Blue and fish there. No, it's not as good as a real shore lunch, but it helps lots of people get pumped for their trip. Even if you already have your trip plan, go to the show and enjoy it... you will probably have fun."
1079299,joeman79,2009-02-07 18:41:00,417,I for one have made deals on the internet after really researching them only to find out something was totally misrepresented in both facilities and quality of fishing or hunting. But I have also trusted the word of WCA members on locations and places to try with great success also. Where I live it would be at least a 4 hr drive to any decent sports show so we depend on this place and members for thier knowledge and expierence at resorts and outposts. Both are great vehicles to find a place to have a trip of a lifetime. PEACE Joe
1079322,Hump,2009-02-07 20:20:00,578,"Talk about disappointment. I was shocked at how few the number of booths there were. The store there had very few items . If I hadn't stopped and spoke to a few exhibitors, we could have gone through in 15 minutes. The crowd was very poor also. I'm not sure the cost to the camps is worth the time. I'm sure these shows get very expensive to the camp owners. I always say I am not going to another and always do."
1079407,cowboyd,2009-02-08 11:35:00,33,"I don't know about the rest of the All Canada shows but the one in St Charles, Il. was as big as ever and while not sure how attendance compared to other years it was well attended while I was there.Dick"
