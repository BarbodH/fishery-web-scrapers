As of Dec we are no longer affiliated with the camp. Anyone out there that knows of a camp for sale, we're looking for another drive-to camp that needs work. We can't afford a well established camp. I know this isn't the place, so please send me an e-mail [email protected] I will never forget all of your comments and tips. Someday I will have the great pleasure to use them. ""When one door closes, another one opens"" and ""Things happen for a reason"" My Best Wishes to all of YOU...Rose"

Finding a camp with a viable fishing potential can be a challenge, and the fish population can change quickly in a matter of a few years, so check out carefully any that you are intersted in. Good luck, and let us know what you end up with ( maybe even ask about it on-line before jumping in). Bill Krejca"

There will be alot of camps coming up for sale with the current economy, any with large mortgages may be forced to sell and the profits will be smaller for alot of camps and the owners will have had enough. Be patinet, there will be some camps with real good fisheries coming up on the market. I hope this doesn't happen, but it looks like a good possibility."

I think the economy has been in a slump for a long time, it is just that no one noticed it. Maybe we are really at the tail end of it. Maybe I am always optimistic. Of course my job is in law enforcement so my job will only make me more valued if the economy really goes in a dumper. I wish I was in a spot to be shopping to buy a camp. I would be looking at the Lac Seul area. 400 K of surface acres and not that many camps? Wow."

1080653,Lazy Fisherman,2009-02-13 06:48:00,276,Rose Sorry to hear that it did not work out. Good luck in the future. Opportunities do come along for hard working people.
1080738,Blackmacs,2009-02-13 11:27:00,2121,Sorry to hear about that. If you're open to a resort in northern Minnesota there are a couple on Kabetogama for sale.
