At some camps, left over fish skin on the grill is an open invitation to night visitors (visitors other than friends bringing beer). Bill Krejca"
1080792,moose1878,2009-02-13 14:26:00,9,If your gas grill has 2 burners you can smoke on it by putting the fish on one side of the grill with the burner off and put a pan on the other side with your wood chips in it and just light that burner. That will give you enough heat and smoke to do the job. I have done it that way many times at home with steelhead.
1080796,tackleman,2009-02-13 14:50:00,444,"I find it hard to believe, that anyone would be thinking of bringing in wood to a country filled with trees, and stores. I have purchased cherry, apple, alder, hickory and mesquite wood chips at local stores in many northwestern ontario towns. Some at walmart, some at canadian tire, some at local sports shops, all for under $10 a bag."
1079936,Guest,2009-02-10 12:01:00,0,Hoping to catch a lake trout this June and would like to use the camp gas grill to smoke it. But I would assume you can not take hickory across the boarder or any wood for that matter. Are there any suggestions on what else to use? Are there any suggestions on how you cook Lake Trout?
1079951,Mohleye,2009-02-10 13:03:00,368,"I've crossed the border a lot of times, and have never been asked about wood or wood products. I doubt that it's something you'd have a problem with, but if you're concerned you could always buy some once you cross the border."
1079974,Bill Krejca,2009-02-10 15:17:00,6107,"I would think you could bring hickory across, but maybe it is not technically legal. Either buy some on the Canadian side or just use alder, which is plentiful in the north woods. Bill Krejca"
1079979,fishncamp,2009-02-10 15:38:00,49,You can buy bagged hickory chips at most outdoor stores. Never been asked about it at the border.
1079999,guidedfishing,2009-02-10 16:41:00,531,"At least once or twice a year when crossing we are asked if we are bringing firewood, I would think if it was prepackaged hickory it may not be a big deal. Have never tried to smoke a lake trout while in camp but we always grill lake trout on an open fire over alder wood. As mentioned earlier alder I believe would be a good substitute, and is plentiful. We all look forward to the grilled trout each trip. Good luck with the smoking that has me thinking. take care GF"
1080030,Guest,2009-02-10 18:42:00,0,"Thanks for the information, I don't want to spend a lot of time shopping, we will get groceries and license and then we need to make our flight. But if I can find some packaged wood I will get it. I looked pictures of Alders on the internet. There are many varieties. And to tell you the truth I'm terrible at identifying trees even in my home state. Everything up north looks like a pine or a birch tree. I see no differences. I'm not confident I would pick an Alder tree over a birch. I think use the grill is the best idea, even if I don't add wood for smoking. Any other ideas on cooking trout?"
1080038,Guest,2009-02-10 19:05:00,0,"boil it in salt water. Fill a large kettle 1/ -1/2 full, add 1/3 cup salt to water. cut fillets 2"" wide and drop 4 or so in the boiling salt water for 5 - 6 minutes. be sure not to drop the boil to much or the trout will soak up the salt. dip the boiled fish in melted butter an dit is delicious...............poor mans lobster. enjoy"
1080048,Bill Krejca,2009-02-10 19:31:00,6107,"Re: Grill cooking - I spray aluminum foil with Pam, place the trout skin side down on the foil, spray the fish a bit, then sprinkle with a seasoning mixture consisting of a combo of salt, sugar, and paprika. Leave the foil flat, cook with cover down, no need to turn, cook until fish flakes easily, enjoy! Bill Krejca"
1080069,guidedfishing,2009-02-10 20:34:00,531,"getting hungrey just thinking about it, I don't use foil, just place fillet skin side down on grill (skin still on) and brush on sun dried tomato and basil salad dressing, along with a little lemon pepper, and garlic salt. The skin gets charred but the fillet is perfect, no need to flip, we will cook walleyes the same way, its a nice break from fried fish. Its also makes for a quick fish cleaning session when we are grilling. Usually can find alder brush along most shore lines. good luck GF"
1080119,Guest,2009-02-11 06:29:00,0,"I did a poor mans lobster with Northern and used Mountain Dew to boil it in, cooled it in the refrigerator and dipped it in butter. It made it extra sweet. I like the idea of skin side down on the grill and adding some commercial dry seasoning mix. Some extra smoke would be a bonus. You know, I need to catch a trout first. I've been reading up on it. Walleye is my go to fish and my first trout would be a bonus."
