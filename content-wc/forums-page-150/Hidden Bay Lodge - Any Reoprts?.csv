5719706,DaBirdman,2017-08-15 18:30:00,164,"I'd be curious to hear how your buddy does on Armit if you hear anything. Our trip will be next year and Armit is #1 On our list. Gage is #2. I know the other lakes (Miniss & Blackstone) are crazy good but the guys are looking for seclusion for our first fly in adventure. And it sounds like those two lakes are easier to get a reservation for as well. Hopefully Shaggy can line something up for us next year. Oh! And I did tell him ""hi"" for you. He was thrilled! Thanks for the feedback! Eric"
5719794,wallydave,2017-08-15 19:01:00,2151,"Shags is a cool guy! After we cleared Armit on the return flight, he says "" Let's find some moose for Hunter, the 10 year old of the group! Before I knew it he had pitched the plane to the right and circled a bull moose and three cows. Miniss does have a couple of cabins on the north side of the lake,. It would be a good long ride from Hidden Bay cabin on the southern end of the lake. Shags will be a great help putting your group on the lake that fits."
5996785,DaBirdman,2018-02-11 11:23:00,164,"Dave - Did any of you fish for pike on Armit during your stay? Is there much for weedbeds on that lake? And if there are decent weeds, did you try them for walleyes at all? Winter is getting way too long! It's good ""therapy"" to talk open water fishing. Ha!"
5997545,wallydave,2018-02-11 19:09:00,2151,"We did a little like fishing, mostly trolling spoons, did some pitching spinnerbaits, white mostly. Breezy point did well on walleye! He did more exploring than our group did, caught walleye where you would expect to find them. I agree, it's a long wait!"
6013017,BreezyPoint,2018-02-19 15:28:00,1581,"I know this is an old thread but I will respond anyway in case it will be helpful to anyone in 2018.First, I have to say HBL is an excellent outfit. I would go back every year if I could afford it.I fished both Armit and Miniss. I fished Miniss with Wallydave and had a spectacular trip. Walleyes were pretty much everywhere with a good mix of sizes.Last year I took my daughter to Armit. Again fishing was really good, but size was a little smaller. We caught a ton of fish very close to our cabin. Most fish were 16-17 inches with only a few in the low 20s.We did venture to Hill Lake one day and the size improved a lot with the average around 20 inches up to around 24. Fishing was not quite as fast but we still caught plenty.The trip to Hill took a good bit of time with some very shallow riverine stretches that were slow going and required caution.Again, I can't say enough about HBL.Hope this helps someone in 2018!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6222688,DaBirdman,2018-07-17 19:42:00,164,"Just bringing this up once more, but anybody here hit Armit this year? We are headed there in two weeks and being this is my first fly in and first time to the lake, just wondering if by chance anybody here has fished it this year?"
5698466,DaBirdman,2017-08-02 16:25:00,164,"Anybody flown in with HBL this year yet? If so, how did it go and which lake were you on? We are trying to get in on a 1 week trip with them next year. Miniss is atop our list, then Blackstone at #2. Armit, Gage and Raggedwood are all tied at #3. None of us have been on a fly in before except my dad. Really looking forward to the opportunity!!!"
5698850,wallydave,2017-08-03 04:43:00,2151,"I haven't been fishing with Hidden Bay this year, but two years ago, I was on Miniss in early September, fantastic fishing trip! Vonnie and crew are great! They put us up the night before the flight, great meal plan, Shaggy and Dave were both great pilots, nice cabin, but the fishing was some of the best ever! Last September,early in the month, I was on Armit, nice cabin, meal plan was great again! We caught plenty of hard fighting walleyes that trip too! Shaggy will work with you on putting you on the best lake available! Tell Shags Dave says hi! No affiliation with Hidden Bay, just a satisfied customer!"
5700074,DaBirdman,2017-08-03 15:01:00,164,I'll do that Dave! And actually I've probably read your reports about 3 times now! üòÅ Also been emailing Shaggs quite a bit too. What a great guy! Just hope he doesn't get tired of all my emails and questions. Ha. Did you get much for size on the walleye on Armit or was it more numbers there? Really want/ hope to get on Miniss. Blackstone is a close second. Raggedwood I think just reopened last year I believe and that might be worth a looksee too. Heck...i just wanna get up there! üëç
5700274,wallydave,2017-08-03 16:29:00,2151,"As far as the size on Armit, plenty of chunky 22-16 inches fish. Numbers we're better on Miniss, I would go back to either one! Trying any of their lakes would be OK in my book! Miniss has some wild blueberry's right off of the deck, blueberry pancakes not a bad way to start a great day of fishing! Good luck and post your report!"
5700938,Skywagon,2017-08-04 05:01:00,1106,"We are going to base at Blackstone tonight, possible Saturday night also, not sure that we will fish there as we have another mission for going. Wilma says the fishing has really been good there. Great group of people at Hidden Bay, they will take care of you. If we do wet a line I will report back."
5705738,Skywagon,2017-08-07 09:57:00,1106,"We flew back home yesterday morning from Highstone lake. We fished the lake some on Saturday, did not have time to cover the whole lake, but were on the water long enough to see that there were many places to fish and explore, there are lots of weed beds, deep water transitions and significant water coming in and flowing out of the lake. No need to go far from the cabin to catch fish, we only needed and kept three walleye for supper, so there are plenty that we returned to the water for any of you that get the opportunity to stay on this lake with Hidden Bay."
5712474,DaBirdman,2017-08-10 15:59:00,164,That's great to hear! Sounds like their Blackstone outpost is really putting out the fish this year too. We're working on a trip with them next year. Can't wait to see what they have for openings late this fall! Thanks for sharing!
5713122,wallydave,2017-08-10 21:19:00,2151,"The September trips have been great! Hardly any bugs, the last couple of years the weather has been stable and the fishing has been fantastic! You will be looking at a good time!"
5718194,DaBirdman,2017-08-14 18:26:00,164,"Dave - When you fished Armit, did you ever venture into Hill Lake?"
5718250,wallydave,2017-08-14 19:48:00,2151,"We didn't explore that much, just three days, I wouldn't mind giving Armit a second chance to explore more. There was a channel straight across from the cabin that held fish pretty consistently, a big rock to the left of the cabin also gave up some fish. I wondered about the lake on the video on the website! A buddy of mine will be hitting Armit soon, I hope to put him on the fish! Good fishing eh!"
