It's a big lake and is further north than most of the outposts in that region. Personally I think it's a no brainer."

Thunderhook is an A+++++++++++ company, and will make sure that your experience is nothing but exceptional. We have done a pair of fly-in trips to Shab South and did exceptionally well on the Walleyes. Looking forward to Machewaian this fall though, so when you get back, please fill me in on the camp and what we can expect up there!! Judging by the pictures on the website it's a bit more ""rustic"" than Shab South is, but I'm willing to sacrifice some comfort for some awesome Walleye fishing. Good luck up there, you're in for one **** of a trip!!!"
