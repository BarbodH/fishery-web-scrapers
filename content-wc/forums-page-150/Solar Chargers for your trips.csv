I'm thinking about picking one up for our trip to Woman River (outpost) so we can keep devices charging during the day which allows our generator to be used for other things. Any recommendations?"

6220436,CMesserschmidt,2018-07-12 07:08:00,1006,Below is what I use for GoPro's. My phones just get plugged into the outlet on the boat. But these work great and not only the boat but road trips and other instances as well.https://www.amazon.com/Soluser-10000mAh-Portable-Waterproof-Flashlight/dp/B072FVBFS4/ref=asc_df_B072FVBFS4/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=241942867107&hvpos=1o4&hvne tw=g&hvrand=1195067731357839375&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hv qmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9052331& hvtargid=aud-467077737785la-447594576445&psc=1

6220452,wooglin,2018-07-12 07:28:00,371,Just ordered this one:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0...?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Price was right and the battery capacity was larger - will update this thread with my thoughts after I've had the chance to use it and after my trip to Woman River in Sept.
