Very nice facilities, boats, motors, etc. Fishing was good. We fished walleyes about 85% of the time/ norts 15%. Being it was our first time fishing Miniss, it took a day or so to figure it all out but once we did, everyone caught a lot of fish. Ryan, Vern's right hand man, really helped our group the first day by taking us out and showing us spots to fish and safe travel routes. Biggest walleye: 25 inches. Biggest Nort: 34 inches. Side note: Three of the guys in our group are 80+ years old (oldest 88 yrs old) and had not fished walleyes before. They all caught many fish each day. My 18 year old son and I did a lot of helping to make sure they were on fish each day. In the end, the highlight of the trip was seeing the smiles on their faces."
6221474,Bstar,2018-07-14 14:06:00,564,Nice report! Miniss is full of walleye and Verne and Ryan know how to take care of their customers. That’s awesome that the octogenarians were able to catch some fish too! Sounds like everyone had a great time. We were there last year and we’re booked for next year. Can’t wait. Thanks for the report.
