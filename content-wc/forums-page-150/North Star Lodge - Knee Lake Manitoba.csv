I am looking at their lodge real hard for a trip in 2019, but there certainly does not seem to be a lot of information on the site at all regarding the specifics of the lodge and the fishing. I have heard that Knee lake is a tremendous fishery but as everyone knows a poorly run operation, bad or outdated boats and motors and SERVICE can all make or break a trip. Please let me know if you have been there or have information regarding this lodge.Thanks,Mike"
