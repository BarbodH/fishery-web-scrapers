Last year at this time the weed growth was really stunted. We did OK on muskies, but it was our worst year walleye fishing by far. Not sure if that had anything to do with the weeds or not. We normally fish rock humps and reefs. It sounded like walleye fishing was tough for others throughout last year too."
6222138,Guest,2018-07-16 12:47:00,0,"I wanted to add that we stay at Keystone Lodge on the east half of the lake. I have never fished the west side. Also, due to having two younger boys along this year, I would also like to target smallmouth for a couple of sessions. I have never tried to go after them. My plan is to drop shot or slip bobber live bait near rock humps to get them some action. Any words of advice for smallies?"
6222154,Mr. Sauger,2018-07-16 13:50:00,285,Fished Cedar Lake last week. Walleye fishing was spotty with surface water temps 71-78 F. Found most wallies belly to the bottom in 12-14 FOW. Slow jig & minnow or lindy rig worked. Most days had blues skies  not much activity in anything under 10 ft. (including weeds). Thermocline established at 16 ft. Seemed like dog days of August. Smallies were game at textbook locations  caught casting crankbaits or jigs. We stopped whenever we saw bowling ball sized rocks on a shoreline. Also landed a few dandies at that small island out from Keystone with all the gull poop on it.
6222358,Guest,2018-07-17 05:51:00,0,Thanks for the info Mr. Sauger. Did you notice how the weed growth is progressing? We catch most of our muskies in the weeds and last year they were way behind.
6222432,rockape,2018-07-17 08:07:00,215,"Muskies are everywhere on Cedar. Rocks, weed edges, you name it. Best lake to hook up with many on a week's stay. Be sure to figure 8 every cast. Bucktails, swimbaits, spinners, cranks, topwater... Everything works there. I'd ditch the walleye fishing and focus on the muskies. I agree that the walleye fishing has become more difficult on Cedar. I don't know why either. Anyone have a theory?"
6222464,Bill Krejca,2018-07-17 09:07:00,6107,"The lake seems to have a great abundance of forage, fish caught are fat - this is a good thing. My feeling is that there is quite a bit of fishing pressure during the season, which can be a significant contributing factor. My guess(guess) that the presence of other species, while a possibly simple answer, is not a significant cause. An interesting subject. We seem to do well enough, while not fly-in proportions, with walleye, while catching crappie. Bill"
6222652,mctbone,2018-07-17 17:26:00,26,"We're heading up to Cedar in a few weeks for the first time, also staying at Keystone. Can we really catch crappies in the heat of the summer? They are my wife's favorite eating fish, so it would be nice to get some. Any tips would be greatly appreciated."
