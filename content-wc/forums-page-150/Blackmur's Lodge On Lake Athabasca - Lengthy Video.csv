Pat has been incredibly supportive and a true friend in the face of all the turmoil I've been dealing with for the last 10 months. Inviting him was a no brainer. Yes he DID catch walleye on his beer cap lure. And not only that he was using an ice fishing rod when he did it LOL!Quote: Originally Posted by OverwatchmikeAll this talk about how bad Pat is has me 2nd guessing his trip up with me this fall.... j/k Sent from my SM-G955U using TapatalkHe's a true gentleman.

6219920,pjshorthorn,2018-07-11 04:57:00,5654,"Howdy Hooks!!!! Hope retirement is treating you well. Yes, I did behave myself...somewhat.....LOL. On a blind date with three other fellas, you have to put your best UL rod forward and try not to embarrass yourself .......in so many different ways......so I toned it down a bit with no yoga pants since we would filming the trip. I do have to admit that I was a little nervous about fishing with Mike since he is so accomplished, but that was all put to rest when we met at the hotel in Saskatoon the night before the trip and we got to know one another over a beer while waiting for our other two fishing partners to arrive. I'm not so sure about his choice of a raspberry flavored beer ,but who cares anyway...LOL. Mike does an amazing job of breaking down and/or eliminating water quickly that won't produce big pike. He also took the time to explain the reason we were fishing a certain spot vs. not this one. One thing he made sure I knew early on was to have a second rod rigged with a different bait if I had a follow , but didn't hook up. That literally came into play one afternoon when a decent fish followed a doctor spoon and then just sat at the boat,but didn't bite. I tossed a big plastic grub in front of the fish and ending up catching a very nice 41"" pike. I could write a book about all the examples of things Mike shared with me on this trip. Tips I'll use for sure on my next trip in September. I don't think I'll make it to ND this fall for a game, but if does pan out I'll let you know and see if our schedules align for a get together at O'Rourkes or such. Go Irish !!!! PjShorthorn"
6220124,Short Strike,2018-07-11 14:07:00,56,"quick inquiry for those in the know... when F & T started their big pike video, they cracked a beer in the boat right? Are rules different in Sask. as opposed to Ontario? Only reason I ask is that when we go to Ontario everyone in camp makes sure to tell me that beer in the boat is completely illegal (and I follow the rules!). but every once in a while on a slow float back into camp, it would be nice to enjoy a sudsy beverage. just curious... ThanksGeno"
6220404,Mike Borger,2018-07-12 06:01:00,1554,"Hey Geno I think whether the laws in Saskatchewan are different or not is a completely moot point. The law is pretty clear in Ontario. How to handle that particular situation is up to each individual. Personally I never drink in the boat so it's a non issue for me. However, I do believe that if anglers are clearly acting responsibly and are forthcoming and polite, they're very likely going to receive the same treatment from an officer if they happen to get checked on the water.As far as Flip & Toss goes, I'm not even 100% sure they weren't standing on the dock when they cracked those beers. More importantly they are total rebels and they live by their own set of rules LOL!"
6220462,Short Strike,2018-07-12 07:50:00,56,thanks for the response Mike... They sound like uniquely fun individuals to have in your network.
6221788,That Minnesota guy,2018-07-15 12:38:00,8293,Mike I see in your video's you seem to bounce back and forth between a baitcasting reel and a spinning reel. Is there specific reasons behind this such as a certain bait works better with one type of reel vs the other? Or are you just changing up just for giggles?
6221900,pike50plus,2018-07-15 18:22:00,584,Just showing us his versatility?
6221924,Mike Borger,2018-07-15 19:33:00,1554,"The spinning rods I use for pike are very very specific. 7' med/hvy St. Croix Avid Series inshore saltwater rods.Have never found a comparable freshwater rod for the applications I'm using them for. I love that rod so much I have 6 of them LOL!Anyhow, yes. I much prefer the spinning rod for lighter baits like soft unweighted plastics. It's also a joy to fish with when you're casting a standard 1 ounce range pike spoon. Can cast the spoon a country mile even into wind and a spoon offers no resistance.Baits like inlines, spinnerbaits, topwater, etc, I'm using a baitcaster."

6219396,pjshorthorn,2018-07-10 06:20:00,5654,"I tend to agree with you TMG, but I have a feeling those flamingos are finding their way around Vermilion Bay Lodge this season......LOL. There was a rumor that other water bird species were trying to cross breed with the flamingos. The hard part was trying to figure out what one would call the new breed if it were to happen. Loonamingo ? Looniemingo? Man that is a tough one to figure out.PjShorthorn"
6219578,Mojo-NC,2018-07-10 10:03:00,1929,"PJ, it's good to know that you weren't drugged or hypnotized or something worse. You guys caught some really nice fish and catching a nice walleye on the ice fishing combo was similar to the Disney Princess combo that we used in Canada earlier this year. Nice touch! I'll bet that was a really fun trip and by the looks of it, you had a really good guide. Fish on!"
6219672,pjshorthorn,2018-07-10 12:48:00,5654,"Too late.....I got you hook , line and sinker. You are stuck with me for a week. Maybe we could get some pick flamingos and detour through Port Clinton on our way up and plant them in Juls' front yard before she wakes up for her charter trip that day We could autograph them with the handles of other members on WC.......: PjShorthorn"
6218186,Mike Borger,2018-07-06 21:35:00,1554,"Hey fellas, I just returned home late on Monday night from an 8 day trip to Blackmur's Otherside River Lodge on Lake Athabasca in northern Saskatchewan.My boat partner on this trip was none other than Walleye Central's own pjshorthorn. Pat is as nice a guy as they come and we had a heck of a lot of fun fishing together!We faced relentless strong east winds almost the entire trip as well as some minor inconveniences with the facilities at the lodge. All in all though it was a great trip and we caught good numbers of trophy sized pike as well as walleyes when we bothered with them.Lake trout were abundant but we caught no truly big ones, just lots of solid 5-7 pound fish. Lack of bigger fish was mostly due to the heavy winds and waves. We were only able to make the long run to fish the main body of the lake once.We did one fly out to nearby Engler Lake to fish for trophy pike and that was quite an experience.If you're interested I pieced together a 51 minute highlight reel video of the adventure which you can see here:https://youtu.be/KKT6GwmxcTcAlso joining me on this trip were two other individuals who shall now forever be known as ""Flip & Toss"".It's hard for me to describe those two, but suffice it to say they are two of the funniest individuals I've ever had the pleasure of spending a week with.Here's a link to a short video montage of Flip & Toss highlights. You REALLY need to watch it! https://youtu.be/lEVD_z9lUKYCheers, Mike"
6218254,jimirjr,2018-07-07 08:28:00,1149,All I can say is .... OH YEAH !!
6218886,kona77,2018-07-09 06:37:00,236,Looked like a fun trip with some challenging weather. Some of the bays looked bigger than the smaller lakes we fish here in WI..
6218896,Mike Borger,2018-07-09 07:03:00,1554,It was super fun. The water was up 4' compared to my trip here two years ago. Everything was flooded and bays that were big to begin were huge this year!
6218936,bthomas3333,2018-07-09 07:58:00,465,"There is nothing worse for pike fishing in general than massive (2+ ft) flooding, at least in my opinion. I'd rather fish through rain / snow / wind at least in terms of catching fish than flooding. I see Mike did catch some really great fish.What do you guys think?Brett"
6219050,hugepike0,2018-07-09 10:39:00,28,I agree about the high water - was on Lake Evans in Quebec in June and the water was up about 4 feet from when i was there last year - unbelievable really - absolutely changed the fishing.
6219056,Mike Borger,2018-07-09 10:49:00,1554,"It wasn't ""really"" the high water that made things more difficult, the fish were there you just had to adapt location and presentation.The biggest difference compared to my previous trip there was the lack of weed growth in many spots. In general, once the cabbage grows in I find better fishing.The thing that truly made things difficult though, was the never ending relentless strong east winds all week long. Not much you can do about that.Interesting topic of conversation though."
6219104,bthomas3333,2018-07-09 12:31:00,465,Believe me I get the East wind thing. One day we got 32 miles out on the arm of Great Slave and had a 'less than pleasant' 2+ hour ride back to camp into the 25mph wind. When we left it was ~10 but it kicked up late day.I guess with wind it limits which water you can fish but with high water it moves the fish (early in the season) into less accessible water all around the lake. I don't know both situations require adjustments that I am still learning.B-
6219110,kona77,2018-07-09 12:36:00,236,It is interesting to see the report of higher water levels in Manitoba and Quebec when everyone seems to be reporting really low water levels in Northwest Ontario.. The lake we were on (Nwest Ontario) was at least 2 feet lower than last year and that also changed the location of some of our hot spots from a year ago. Just had to move more this year and adapt to find the fish.
6219170,Mojo-NC,2018-07-09 14:59:00,1929,"Dang, you guys really know how to make it difficult to focus on work, etc. Excellent video of you guys catching some quality fish on Athabasca.
