6219742,PhilTickelson,2018-07-10 14:59:00,84,"Hey Everyone, I don't post on here often, but you guys helped me decide on five lake lodge for my wife's first Canadian fishing trip, so it's only fair I write up a report! Day 1, 6/30: We left our house north of St. Paul at around 7:15, a mere hour and 15 minutes behind schedule, weather was nice, roads weren't too busy so we made good time up to I Falls. Border crossing was a breeze, it was my wife's first time out of the country so she was nervous, but it took maybe 10 minutes to get across the bridge and through the booths. The rest of the drive was pretty uneventful, we did take that little shortcut route west of dryden instead of going through Dryden. I was pretty surprised to find myself on a dirt road(Adams Road), but it did end up faster I think. We arrived into camp around 6 PM, I told my wife ""around 9 hours"", so we only missed that by a couple . We met Ian immediately upon entering camp, he directed us to our cabin and we started unloading and I rigged up a couple rods. We only had a few hours of daylight left but wanted to get out on the water to see some of the lake. Ian gave us a quick camp tour and then spent a good 20 minutes going over the lake map with us and marking spots. Not just general areas either, he gave us some very specific locations that really helped us find a few fish on our first couple days! We went out and fished Stephenson's point that night for about an hour and caught a couple fished and missed a few more, just drifting with jigs. Enough action to get us excited about the next day. Immediately upon docking the boat Ian was there asking how we did, he reiterated where he thought we should fish the next day and we went in for some dinner. We came in and cooked up some mac and cheese w/Ring Bologna and called it an early night. Day 2, 7/1 We got up pretty early on Sunday, ate some cinnabons, and packed a lunch for the boat. We grabbed a couple dozen minnows and headed over to Two Island Lake to fish a section that Ian had some luck on just a couple days prior. The goal for the day was to get familiar with the lake and try to put some numbers of fish in the boat. My wife loves to fish but doesn't have much walleye experience, so I wanted to do some lindy rigging and vertical jigging to get her comfortable with the techniques. Weather was too good this day, mid to high 70s, and very little wind. Took us probably 25 minutes to get to two island lake and we started off backtrolling lindy rigs(I was using half crawlers, my wife minnows) in 12-16 FOW on the north end of the lake. I'm always nervous on the first day of trips like this as I don't want to completely 'miss'. My worries were quickly washed away as we started getting bites almost immediately. It took both of us some adjustments to timing and after settling on letting the fish take the bait for 3-5 seconds, we started hooking up a lot more frequently. As Ian alluded to, most fish in this area were smaller, many in the 12-15"" range, but we were catching fish and that was fine with us! We did some vertical jigging in a spot Ian pointed out(the exact spot, it was easy to find), mainly catching small saugers, but quite a few! Lunch rolled around and we moved back to the portion off 'North Point #1' where we had the most action. I rigged up some slip bobber rigs with 1/8 oz jigheads on the end and we settled in for a relaxing lunch. I bet we caught 5-8 fish while slib bobbering at lunch, which was a blast! Our nicest fish of the morning came on the slip bobbers as well. We put 3 fish in the livewell for dinner and headed on our way. There's a narrow channel that connects GullRock to Two Island and it looked like a 'pikey' spot, so we stopped and casted around some reeds on the way out. Surface temp was 70 degrees so it didn't seem likely we'd catch any big fish doing this, but I figured there'd be some fish in the area. My wife hooked into a small northern that was attacked boatside by a BIG pike. It let go almost immediately, but it was a good seeing a big pike! The little pike had absolutely INHALED the treble hook on her doctor spoon, I spent some time trying to get the hooks out right as Ian pulled up to see how we were doing. He gave us some more encouraging words and tips and we both headed on our way. After lunch we motored out of two island, hoping to explore the north and east end of GullRock lake. I spoke with JohnBoat on here about the lake before my trip, and he suggested trying out 'dogshead point' on the east end of the lake. We motored over there and with the SW wind we were able to setup a nice drift between the 'two ears' of the point. We caught a fair amount of fish doing this, mainly smaller walleye and sauger, but noticed some darkening skies to the SW. It looked like rain was already falling near camp and we were going to get stuck in it. We put on our rain gear just before it started to come down. It looked like maybe we'd be able to avoid some of it by heading further north...that was not the case. We drove up to 'The Gull Rock', which is where most of the bigger fish had been caught as of late, to try and escape some rain and feel out that spot. This spot consisted of a large underwater point(for lack of better word) that sticks out a long ways into the main body of the lake. There is a hittable rock at the end of it, and all sorts of underwater structure around that area. THere are large expanses of 9-11 foot flats, drop offs to 20-25 feet, drop offs to 30 feet, all zig zaggin around the area. I looked at the map which laid it out pretty well, but without a map chip it was tough to get my bearings since this structure was so far off the shoreline. We got pounded by rain as I tried to figure the spot out but eventually got tired of the rain and started to head in. I knew we'd be back in better weather and more favorable conditions. Along the way back I noticed some folks fishing another reef further south, I motored by and from a few hundred yards away tried to estimate their location and set a waypoint on the GPS for later . The GPS ended up being unbelievably useful for some of these main lake areas, even though we didn't have a map chip I could use waypoints to mark mainly the 20' depth contour in these areas. Most of our main lake spots had us fishing in 16-25 FOW so this was extremely helpful. We stopped at the boot on the way in and did some exploring, waypointing and some speed fishing. The fish finders Ian put on the boats were new Lowrance Hook7s I believe, and they did a really good job marking fish. While trying to learn the depth changes around 'the boot', we'd mark fish, I'd pop it in neutral or revers and we'd drop jigs. We probably caught a half dozen fish doing this, which kept us interested. After maybe an hour or so we were pretty hungry and decided to head in for dinner. As we pulled into the dock, Ian walked down the steps and asked how our first day was. We told him where we fished and he had some more tips and again said, 'you guys gotta get to the Gull Rock if you want some bigger fish'. I did a very mediocre job cleaning the fish and we breaded them in italian bread crumbs and parmesen cheese and fried em up, they were pretty good! Ian has setup outdoor propane stoves like this:https://express.google.com/u/0/produ...mpaign=8175035for all the cabins, and they worked great for frying fish. They'd heat up the oil FAST, and no fish smell or anything in the cabins! All in all it was a good day, we didn't count fish on any day, but I bet we boated 40-50 fish this first day, and missed A LOT of bites with our lindy rigs. No big fish on this day, but plenty of action! Day 3 coming in next post!"
6219754,PhilTickelson,2018-07-10 15:24:00,84,"Day 3, 7/2 We woke up fairly early on day three with a goal to fish 'The Gull Rock'. As we stepped outside we noticed it felt quite breezy. Nevertheless, we packed up and headed on our merry way. We were driving with the wind, our 18' 'upgrade' boat handled the ride great and we were there in no time. I found the transition I was looking for almost immediately and upon turning into the wind to re-position ourselves we were struck with just how hard it was blowing. Turns out it was around 20-25 mph, which created quite a chop. We tried to anchor but it just wouldn't hold us. I had my wife run up to pull the anchor when a big wave hit, just as she had stepped up to the bow(weighing that down). We speared the wave and both got really wet. This was less than ideal, I decided we would motor over behind the nearest island to change into some dry clothes and figure out a new game plan. We fished the dogs ears for a bit again and caught some more fish, not fast and furious but picked off a couple every few passes. We decided to try and head back to Two Island lake to catch some dinner, and because getting back to camp from that side of the lake would be a lot calmer than from the North side of the lake. We got to Two Island and caught a few fish but it was really windy and choppy here too, boat control was tricky and we were both kind of beat up from the rough rides and water, so we decided to head in for lunch and see if the wind died down in the afternoon. Ian was there again as we pulled up(noticing a pattern?) and said it must have been tough out there in that wind. We noticed quite a few of the others in camp had also come in to get out of the wind, so that made us feel a bit better . We played some cribbage in the cabin and then tried our hand at horseshoes(neither of us were good). After hanging around camp a bit longer we talked to Ian again and got some tips on some close to home spots. First stop was a reef nearby camp, I spun around and marked the edge of the reef for a few minutes and drifted/backtrolled around it with lindy's and jigs. We caught a couple but didn't mark much and it didn't really seem to be 'on'. We then went over to ""Stoney Point"" and trolled some lindys trying to mark or catch a few fish. After a couple passes we noticed a section of 20-22 feet of water where we consistently caught fish. I marked a waypoint on the next pass and then we anchored on top of them and switched to jigs. By this time it was probably 8:00PM or so, our anchor wasn't holding us perfectly still, we'd swing out to 25' and in to about 18', but everytime we got to that 20-22' range we'd get bites immediately. For the next hour and a half we caught A LOT of fish, mainly smaller sauger, but when we'd swing to that 22' range we'd pickup some walleyes. We kept enough for dinner and at right aorund 9PM we saw a flurry of our first bigger walleyes swim by. I caught an 18"", then my wife caught a 20"" and 20.5"" right in a row, it was great! We fished until the last possible moment and headed back in to the dock. Ian was there again and said we must have found something if we got back so late. We filled him in and he was happy we were able to get on some numbers of fish. I went and cleaned fish, again, in quite a mediocre fashion, and we fried them up with some shore lunch, delicious! Day 4 coming in the next post!"
6219760,PhilTickelson,2018-07-10 15:43:00,84,"Day 4, 7/3 We woke up a bit late on Tuesday, ate a quick breakfast, packed the cooler and headed out. We were determined to fish 'The Gull Rock', as others had been catching good fish there, so we headed there first. It was low 50s in the morning, with a moderate NNW wind, but turned into a really nice day. We got to 'The Gull Rock' by about 8:30 and were able to find my waypoint from the previous day. After a few drifts catching fish in ~22 FOW we decided to anchor. There were other boats trolling around in the area but the wind was going in a direction that gave us a very long drift and we didn't have a map chip to really follow the depth contour very easily(I hadn't put too many waypoints in here). After a few tries with the anchor we finally got positioned how we wanted and instantly we started catching fish. From 9-10:00 AM we caught loads of walleye and sauger. Just like Ian said, we also caught a lot nicer fish in this spot. Most fish we'd caught to this point were either good eater size, or slightly smaller, but this spot was different. We got a lot of fish in the 15-16"" range, and over the course of maybe 20 minutes I caught a 19.5"", 20.5"" and my wife caught a 20"", 22"", 23"", 24"" in that order. With three consecutive fish she caught a new PB walleye, how fun! At 10:00 AM the fish turned off and while we hung around picking a few off here and there, we knew it was time to move. My concerns of causing trouble by anchoring while others were trolling around the area were immediately squashed as one boat nearby yelled over to us as we were trolling away, ""Can you guys go back and anchor there again? You were the perfect waypoint!"" I guess the other camps don't provide GPS fish finders in their boats . We decided to try Dogshead again while we ate lunch. We marked a load of fish off 'Right Dogs Ear', but only got one to bite on our jigs while we ate. I was a bit perplexed but suggested we try drifting through with lindys a few times to see if they want something moving. I tried one pass with no luck, but was dissatisfied with the line we drifted through, too deep I thought, 22-28 FOW the whole time. I decided to take a more aggressive line that would bring us closer to the rocks off the point. Upon getting into ~20 FOW I got a bite and landed a nice walleye, so we did it again, and again, and again.... The wind was perfect, blowing us parallel the dogs ear. The proximity to land was also perfect, I was able to lineup a buoy in the water with a tree on the shore to get in perfect position every time(I should have brought a few market buoys I guess). We'd start out in 25 FOW and drift into ~12' before I'd reset. We must have drifted 30-40 times, catching 2-4 fish every drift, we'd get them in 22-19FOW and then some more in 14-15'. It was a blast. We kept a full limit(2 a piece) for dinner, and threw so many back. It started to slow down around 5PM or so, so we decided to head in for an early dinner and relax a bit, we had caught a lot of fish today. As we pulled back to the dock, Ian was there again greeting us and asking how we did. This had been our best day by far, and he was excited for us. I went to the cleaning shack and did my best impersonation of Sweeney Todd. I mean, is there really that much meat on a 15"" walleye anyways?. The meat I could salvage off the fish were brought back to the cabin and fried up again in shore lunch, and all was right with the world. We ended up just staying in for the night, we were satisfied with what we had caught for the day. We drove into red lake to see what that looked like and then played some cribbage at the cabin and headed to bed. Our plan for day 5 was the same, get out to the Gull Rock early! Day 5 in next post."
6219762,PhilTickelson,2018-07-10 15:52:00,84,"Day 5, 7/4 I woke up early so we could get out to the Gull Rock but was immediately disappointed as the rain was coming down with lots of thunder and lightning. I checked the radar and it looked like we'd miss the morning bite out there. In addition, my wife woke up to go the bathroom and immediately yelled for me after looking in the mirror. I walked in and saw her bottom lip, about 3x it's normal size, ouch! We did some googling, thinking she was bitten by some sort of exotic Canadian insect not seen in the deep south of Minnesota. Turns out sunburn was the culprit, did you know if your lips get sunburn they can swell up to mammoth proportions! To make matters worse, the chapstick she was using did NOT have sun protection, and was more or less vaseline, which trapped the heat in her lips. She took some ibuprofen and rubbed off the chapstick. We went back to sleep for a couple hours, knowing that fishing wasn't going to happen. To our relief, she woke up and though her lip was still swollen, it was much better. We headed back into town to get her some different chap stick and returned around lunch time. We did get out in the afternoon fishing, but it was something of a lost day for us. We didn't fish hard as she was still in discomfort, fishing close to camp we tried around some of the points and shorelines and picked up fish in 11-14 FOW, one particular spot we picked off quite a few in a row before heading back to camp for a big Fourth of July dinner! I cleaned the one fish we kept for our 'surf n' turf', after another average fish cleaning display, we grilled up some steaks, sauteed mushrooms and onions with a few tablespoons of Au Jus(omg this was good), and made some fresh green beans. What a meal! They had planned for fireworks tonight, but the wind was still really strong so they were delayed til the next day. The plan was to get up early and get out to the gull rock, would our heroes outduel their alarm clocks to get up before the crack of 8AM? Find out in the next post. Day 6 post next"
6219768,PhilTickelson,2018-07-10 16:10:00,84,"Day 6, 7/10 I woke up to the early alarm clocking, fighting every urge to stay in bed, I got up to assess the day. My wife looked extremely happy to be sleeping, we have a 2 year old at home who has not been giving us full nights of sleep for a long time. I checked my weather app and walked out side and was disappointed to see the wind was still howling. ~17mp WSW wind, gusting in the low 20s. This would make 'The Gull Rock' pretty choppy. Now, if this was a guys trip, there's a chance I would have went anyways. The upgrade boats Ian has at camp are fantastic. 18' G3 boats with 50hp Yamaha 4 strokes. I never felt unsafe even though it's fairly big water up there, but I didn't feel like getting beat up and I know my wife didn't want to either. I retreated back to my bed and went back to sleep. We slept in until about 8:45 and it was amazing. Get off my back dudes. We got out on the water at an embarrassing time, Ian said hi as we walked by and did a humorous look at his watch to rub it in a little, then reassured us that were on vacation. Our goal was to explore some of the western shoreline on the north side of the lake, there were some nice points and bays there that had been recommended to us by JohnBoat and Ian. On our way out, just past the clay banks we were waved over by another camp boat and they said, 'You should fish right here'. They were setup on a very steep dropoff, it went from 9-12 feet down to 20, then down to 30 in a matter of 1-2 boat lengths. If you could get yourself on that 22 foot line though, man were there fish. We were bad at catching people's names, but this couple drove 22+ hours from SE Ontario , we dubbed them 'The Nice Canadian Folks', in contrast to 'the Nice American Folks' we had fished by earlier and later in the week. We fished there for a bit, but the wind was blowing us around on anchor even and we just couldn't get situated. We headed north for greener pastures and as we got to the boot realized that others had similar plans. We backtrolled lindys, picking up a few fish along the boot and then marked A LOT of fish on the south side of the next point north, 'Be Young Point'. We fished that pod of fish and around the other area of the point but couldn't really get anything to bite. After awhile I was ready for a move but my wife said, ""let's drift this way one more time"". Sure enough, she hooked into a nice 16"" walleye as we drifted the north side of the point and dropped into 21 FOW. We tried again a picked up another fish. We ended up doing this for a few hours, never getting into them too good, but getting too many to move on and try to fight the wind in a new spot, the wind setup perfectly for this drift line. It ended up being a good afternoon. No monsters were caught, but I got a nice 19"", and she caught a 21"" and 22"" walleye on that little drift, no complaints here! We kept another 4 fish for dinner. We motored over to dogshead again, as I thought Round island might be protecting one of our spots, but alas, it was not. We tucked in behind to eat lunch. We ate lunch while the biting flies ate us. we caught a couple jigging on the backside of the point, but then decided to head back towards camp. We took the South route and did a bit of casting for northern on the way back, I caught a small one and snagged a rock, then took our time getting back to camp, fishing a few spots along the way. By this point in the week I was really on my game cleaning fish. Earlier in the week I was definitely in the C- range, but today saw a vast improvement, raising my letter grade from a C- to a C. It has been awhile since I've cleaned fish okay? We ate fish again and then hung out in the gazebo to watch the fireworks. The nice Canadian folks had brought some and Ian had picked some up as well. They also bought a cake for everyone so the Americans could feel at home. Nice folks them Canadians! It was nice visiting with some of the others in camp, but tomorrow was our last day and we were determined to get back out to the Gull Rock and catch some big fish. After two days of sleeping in, I was ready to get out early and make the most of our last full day, would it happen? Doubtful. Day 7 coming up next!"
6219788,PhilTickelson,2018-07-10 16:52:00,84,"Day 7, 7/6 My alarm went off, early, but I jumped out of bed and splashed a bucket cold water on my wife's face to wake her up. Well, actually I just asked her really nicely and softly if she wanted to get up. We ate a quick breakfast and got dressed. The cooler was already packed and we had already gotten bait the night before and stuck it in my minnow cooler with the aerator going. We kicked off from shore at 5:30 I think and were fishing by just after 6. It was dead calm, perfectly quiet and we had no company at The Gull Rock until after 8 AM, bliss! We setup in our same spot from Tuesday and immediately started catching fish. We had better luck drifting than anchoring, so we found our line and went to work. We caught a lot of fish, nothing huge, but a lot of good sized fish and probably our best average size of the week. We had our limit of 4 by 8 AM, all between 16-17"", I caught a 22"" and my wife caught a 19"" and a 21"". Big fish were there though, 'Nice Canadian folks V2.0' caught a 27"" right next to us while we were there(and they caught a 31"" there earlier in the week). The trophy gene was not in our boat this trip, but we caught quite a few over 20"" and i'm convinced it was a matter of putting in the hours at the right spot, but the lake or our technique. We wanted to fish this spot every morning since Tuesday, but ended up only getting one more shot at it. This was also where we experienced our only frustrating experience of the week. We had been drifting the same small stretch of water for hours, and another boat in the vicinity was using their bow mount trolling motor to pull bottom bouncers through the area for awhile as well. We would occassionally cross paths as they seemed to be working a break line we would drift across, but it was obvious we were having more luck than they were. I was wondering how long until they decided to drift the same line (which would have been alright), but instead they pulled right up in front of us an watched us pull two fish in, they then trolled over after we drifted into shallower water and put on their spot lock exactly where we had caught two fish. I was pretty perturbed, as there was a very clear drift line that was working for us, 15 yards on either side of it were not nearly as effective. They avoided eye contact and started vertical jigging(poorly). I kept on drifting, at times coming pretty close to their boat, eventually they started up a conversation and it was very cordial. I still was not their biggest fan though. Again the fish turned off around ten and we decided to try a new spot, already having our limit. If you remember, I mentioned marking a way point earlier in the week where I saw a boat fishing, or approximately where I saw them, as i thought they were fishing a main lake reef I saw on the map. I told Katie I'd like to try it as we hadn't seen anyone there in a couple days and it seemed like a spot that should really hold fish. After a bit of cruising around we found it. A very distinct reef that came all the way up to 12-18 feet out ~40' of water. What's more, while trying to mark the 20' line around the whole reef, I found a spot that came all the way up to 6' with potentially a bit of weeds on there! I said, ""Hmmm, this seems like a spot that could hold some big northern."" Now, I have very little to no experience fishing for big northern, but I have read like every one of Mike Borger's trip reports, so that basically makes me an expert? We drifted the reef once and I immediately picked up a nice 17"" walleye. Hmmm, walleye were here, what about the northern. As my mind is racing trying to remember any tidbit of information about pike fishing that might impress my wife, she says, ""You know, I am a bit disappointed we didn't catch any big northern."" To which I replied, ""Well, in the middle of summer like this with the water this warm already, I bet a main lake reef like this could hold some nice fish, I bet there are some around if we were to pull some big crankbaits through here, but I have never really done that before so it could be a total waste of time."" To my surprise she said, ""Let's do it"". Crap. Well, drawing on my hours of experience reading about other people more knowledgable and talented than me catching fish, I looked through my tackle box and found two big original floating rapalas to put on some trolling rods, I only had two. One chartreuse and one 'Hot Steel' which we dubbed 'Real Steel' in tribute to Hugh Jackman's finest cinematic masterpiece. I trolled back in forth on top of that shallow spot with these biggish crankbaits, after maybe 6 passes I was starting to lose what little confidence I have. This shallow spot was very small, so I expected if there were any fish in the area, they would hit pretty quickly. Just as I was about to say, ""let's go in for lunch"", I got a savage strike. ""Whoa, this feels like a nice fish"". After one of the best fights I've had with a northern, we slipped it into the net, an extremely thick and chunky 32""! Not a trophy by any means, but man was this thick fat and did it put up a good fight. I don't know how anyone can look down on fishing for northern, whether it's musky guys or walleye guys, I just can't believe people would say that's not a fun fish to catch. We decided to keep trolling this spot and not long later Katie pulled in a 32"" pike of her own, her personal best! A few more passes later she hooked into 35.5"" PB pike, that was also a very fat specimen. We tried a bit more and didn't pick any up. But after such quick success i suggested we try a spot or two on the way in, go clean the fish since it was really hot out and i didn't want them getting too warm in the livewell, and then put together a game plan for the afternoon to find some more big pike. We trolled along the boot on the way home and I picked up another 32"", this one didn't fight as good as my first, but was still put up a tussle. We ate lunch, and made a plan. We'd hit up the point where we fished with the nice Canadian folks the previous day, there were walleye there, and there was a shallow shelf with weeds that stuck out quite far into the lake. I drove around and marked the weedline with waypoints and we began trolling, I really felt good about this spot. On our 2nd pass, my wife picked up a fish, another nice northern at 34"". We went and tried Dogshead, then the reef from the morning, but the wind had picked up making it more difficult to troll. We motored up the lake to try and fish the gull rock, as there had been some big northern caught there, but the wind had picked up and I didn't really feel like fighting the waves any more. Finally, we decided to try Fishermen's point, a big main lake point that we hadn't had the chance to fish yet. I put my line in while my wife was untangling hers from the boat ride and before she even got hers in the water I had a fish on. It felt heavy, but after a few headshakes she got loose . Around the south side of the point Katie picked up one more fish, another 35"" pike that put up a huge fight. That would end up being our last fish of the trip, as we headed in not long after, but I was absolutely amazed at the quality of pike we caught without really knowing what we were doing. Six fish, the smallest at 32"", biggest at 35.5"". I could fight those fish all day, especially knowing there is much bigger fish around(the week before us someone caught a 44"" and a 46"" pike!). We headed back in and Ian was right there as we pulled up asking how we did. We were excited about the day as we'd caught a lot of walleye in the morning and put some nice pike in the boat. He was happy for us, but assured me that there are much bigger pike out there if we came back and actually 'tried' to catch them, thanks Ian . We ate dinner, I cleaned the fish for travel, and wouldn't you know it, I actually did a pretty decent job! Packed a bunch of stuff up and headed to bed. What a week. I just wrote a lot of stuff that no one will probably read, but I hope you enjoyed it! I am going to do another post about the camp and owners, as I've never been more impressed with an operation anywhere. Ian absolutely is doing this the right way and I'm very appreciative of those who suggested this lodge! We re-booked for next year and my in-laws might be joining us. I'd love to make a couple trips up there as it does seem like a rare gem of a lake where you can catch numbers and size of walleye and pike without fighting a HUGE body of water."
6220546,johnboat,2018-07-12 10:51:00,2014,"Yes. You will be heavily out fished with out using live bait. That being said, there will be times when the bite is fast and furious (evening bite) when you can go with gulp or plastic, but real live meat on your jig will far out produce. That's coming from 16 straight years on that lake.There will be quality red stripe minnows at camp for your use.This spring my boat of 3 men and a 9 year old gal ran through 65 dozen in a week. My advise is to just plan on the cost of minnows. After you split the cost, it is a small portion of your trips cost and single handedly makes the biggest difference on the success of your trip.We have also gotten away from purchasing a flat of crawlers for our 10 man group. We got them in the beginning but slowly have gotten away from them. Seem to be more trouble than they were worth.Jig and a minnow (no plastic on) and you'll be good to go!"
6220550,gullrockguy,2018-07-12 10:58:00,44,"plastic baits and gulp type products will get you the odd fish but to be productive, you need the real deal. worms, leeches and minnows are the way to go with minnows being the number one bait. i know because i live on the lake and have fished it for 30 years."
6220812,Rich B,2018-07-12 20:29:00,1081,"Excellent and well written reports on the daily fishing and camp activities with plenty of funny comments. Phil, you must have taken a few English or Communication classes along the way (ha). Enjoyed your photos as well....will have to put this camp on my list to check out for next year. Rich B"
6220822,Guest,2018-07-12 20:56:00,0,"Here is a question: my group usually jigs with plastics (mister twister, pulsars, moxi, etc.) because we typically do a fly in trip to a remote outpost and minows are not readily available. Do you think we will get greatly outfished if we use plastics instead of live bait? Trying to way the cost of purchasing many dozens of minows vs the stuff i already got. This would also depend on whether you fish shallow or deep. I have been going up to a different camp on Gullrock for the past 20 years and we are either casting cranks in shallow weeds (Stone Bay) or trolling them at the 9-14 ft depth. Some years we do better then the live bait guys and other year we do not with this year being even. We had one day in Two Island this year were every 2-3 casts we had a fish and that lasted for a couple of hours with Hot Steel being the best color Shad Rap. Another guy in camp casteded the jerk style plastics in Stone Bay and picked up over 30 fish in a few hours with the biggest around 26 inches. This is just the style of fishing we have confidence in and it has worked for many years and the nice thing about casting cranks to 5' of water is that we are usually alone so next year the week of the 15th if you see a boat in a weedy and windy bay casting or trolling the windy shore that will be us."

6219848,gordy28,2018-07-10 19:44:00,437,Thanks for taking the time to post this. I will echo others to say it’s one of the better reports I’ve read. Feel like I was on the trip with you lol. Highlighting how much the camp owner checked in was great. To me that’s the sign of great customer experience and sounds like you thought so to. Thanks Gordy!
6219862,pjshorthorn,2018-07-10 20:21:00,5654,"I read all 7 posts you penned and just now looked at the pictures. Well done on all accounts. As others have already said, I felt like I was in the boat with you during your trip. Don't worry too much about the filleting of walleye. It comes with practice and if anyone tells you otherwise, they are big fibbers. As long as you and your wife had a good fish meal together each night.....does anything else really matter?? Best of luck on future trips and thanks for sharing yours. PjShorthorn"
6219926,Ebarnett,2018-07-11 05:40:00,60,Great report Phil...and thanks! My clan will be at 5 lakes lodge in 4 weeks. Can't wait! Our first trip to Gullrock.
6220052,johnboat,2018-07-11 10:36:00,2014,"Nice report Logan!I could almost smell the fresh air and see the Eagles perched at The Boot while I read it.One would have to look a long time to find a camp as well run, with such nice equipment, on a great fishery like Gullrock.The re-book says it all and is quite a commonality there! Every year there seems to get better."
6220074,dhottle,2018-07-11 11:32:00,163,You did a great job reporting your experiences. Well written & held my interest the whole way through.
6220132,Bakefish,2018-07-11 14:23:00,1077,Outstanding report. I read every word. You had me from the beginning.
6220254,PhilTickelson,2018-07-11 18:41:00,84,"Thanks guys! I'm glad you enjoyed the write up, I am a bit self deprecating when I clean fish, mainly because my buddy is an absolute wizard that always puts me to shame . I'd be happy to answer any questions anyone has about the lake or lodge while it's fresh in my mind. Wish I was still up there!"

6220354,PhilTickelson,2018-07-11 22:09:00,84,"I think we paid around $75 for minnows for the week, but I used half crawlers quite a bit and did not notice a big catch difference between the two, especially when using lindys. I’d pick up a half flat of crawlers($45 I think) and supplemented with minnows. The big minnows Ian had did seem to bring us some bigger fish. We didn’t try plastics at all though. Depending how many guys are in your group, you’d be adding like $30-$50 per person on bait, worth it if you ask me! That’s like 6–10 packages of moxis &#x1f642;."
6219800,PhilTickelson,2018-07-10 17:11:00,84,"Five Lakes Lodge I haven't been to nearly as many lodges as most of you on here, but I've been to a fair amount. I can say without any doubt in my mind that this is the best run camp I've ever been to. Ian and Drew were absolutely fantastic hosts, super nice, super engaged, and you could tell they really cared that we had a good time. I don't know how Ian manages it, but he was constantly working on upgrades at camp while were there, but stopped what he was doing every single time we came in or were leaving to chat and make sure we had a good game plan. He also has extensive, current and relevant knowledge of the lake. His 'spots' and 'tips' were so much more specific that it really made it easy to find good areas to fish. I hesitate to put a time on it, but I seriously think we spent a half hour or more every day chatting with him. Everything you need is right there at camp, ice, bait, drinking water, etc. The gazebo they just built is awesome, and the docks/boats are top notch. The upgrade boats were a joy to fish out of, the addition of nice fish finders was awesome. I do wish I would have bought a map chip as we fished some off-shore spots that had really interesting contours, would have helped us narrow down the area quicker, but it wasn't too bad. I would, without a sliver of hesitation, recommend this lake and camp to anyone. Ian and Drew worked non-stop to make sure our stay was top-notch, and from the sounds of others in camp, did the same with them. Give Five Lakes Lodge a real look(if you can get on their books), numbers and size of walleye and pike, tough to beat it!"
6219816,andreindy,2018-07-10 18:17:00,308,"This, sir, is one of the finest fishing reports I have read. In my world, we call it ""painting the clinical picture"". You brought me there completely with your descriptions of all the elements. Thank you."
6219818,kettyspanky,2018-07-10 18:18:00,271,I read all the posts. Great details and sounds like you had a great trip. Good for you too. I might have to put that lake on my radar for a future trip. Thanks for the great report.
6219834,PhilTickelson,2018-07-10 19:03:00,84,"Here’s some pics to go along with the report. I will ask the wife if she’s okay with me posting her pics, she caught all the nicest fish anyways."
