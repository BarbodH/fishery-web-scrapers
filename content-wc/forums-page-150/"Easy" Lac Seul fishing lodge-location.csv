6220238,Aspencreek,2018-07-11 18:25:00,2911,"I know you said that you don't like to hire a guide and figure it out on your own....I get that, I was the same way, UNTIL I hired a guide for a day. It turned out to be the lodge owner, and it opened my eyes to what I was missing. And I could have done 10-15 more trips to ""FIGURE"" out what I was missing, and he showed me in the first hour. Actually his tutorial on the dock before we left as to where we were going to go and why was the biggest eye opener. There are so many factors involved in being successful (and yes, that is a relative term). Some guys are happy with a 20-30 fish day, and sometimes that is all you are going to do. And some guys are thinking that is a bad day. My buddy just got back from a lake in the LS area (not LS) where he and his boat partner caught 27 fish for the week. That is a BAD week!! But after talking to him I understand why. Long Story!! Wind, water temps, locations, weed lines, bait choices, tactics, boat control, depth, and to a lesser extent equipment all are factors in how well you will do. Do yourself a favor, pry open that wallet and invest in yourself, you will be glad you did."

6220346,rather-be-fishin,2018-07-11 21:49:00,429,"Aspencreek gave excellent advice on hiring a guide for a day at the start of the trip. They will put you on fish fast, show you fishing tactics, lures/jigs, depths & safe travel routes. We hired a guide for a day the first few years we went & it was money well spent! It helped make our years of fishing trips very successful! Our very first trip I arrived on the dock carrying my big tackle box. The owner of the resort who was the guide, said you can leave that tackle box here, all you need is this & he pulled out 2 Plano boxes one full of jigs & the other full of spinners. That's all he uses & all we used too all these years with great success! Oh another resort I forgot to mention is Timberlane. Add that to your list of resorts to check out. Aspencreek ~ We will do our best to go & get em! Sure looking forward to it! Are you going to be able to make a trip this year to LS? RBF"
6220840,Aspencreek,2018-07-12 22:37:00,2911,"This year is a no go, but I've got my week reserved for next year, this week too!! only 51 weeks to go!"
6220944,fishingMN4eyes,2018-07-13 08:26:00,108,"These are great points. Call Troy at Winoga Lodge if you do end up going to Minnitaki. He guides on Lac Seul too so, like rockape said, that's an option also."
6218826,troutwater,2018-07-08 22:43:00,299,"Yes yes I know there's no such thing as easy fishing, but hear me out. I won't lie.....I'm a pretty poor walleye fisherman, but mainly because I just rarely do it. I mainly go to Canada to target muskies, but I was thinking of making a short extended weekend trip to Lac Seul or somewhere else to target walleye. I would like to get better at it and just enjoy getting into some(hopefully). Last summer the one day we really targeted walleye(Dinorwic) I caught a bunch, but all but 3 were dinkers. For someone like me where would you guys suggest? I also don't like hiring guides because I find it more rewarding and fun to figure it out on my own. Thanks."
6218828,Farmerj,2018-07-08 23:08:00,375,I'd suggest Sioux Narrows Ontario. It puts you onto the Ontario access to LOW.
6219370,troutwater,2018-07-10 05:44:00,299,The problem with LOTW is that I'd probably just end up muskie fishing. I'd just like to go to a great walleye lake where I don't have the temptation.
6219378,Farmerj,2018-07-10 05:51:00,375,Try here
6219380,pjshorthorn,2018-07-10 05:51:00,5654,What area of Lac Seul do you want to fish. It is a big lake!!! PjShorthorn
6219562,troutwater,2018-07-10 09:50:00,299,That's why I'm asking for suggestions for something that kind of meets my criteria. I guess I'd prefer something easily accessible
6219576,rockape,2018-07-10 10:03:00,215,"Skip Lac Seul and fish Minnitaki. No musky temptation, and great walleye fishing. EASY access from a number of camps around Sioux Lookout. And if the Lac Seul bug bites hard, it is a 15 minute drive to the Deception Ramp."
6219664,troutwater,2018-07-10 12:37:00,299,"Thanks for the suggestion, I'll look into it"
6219814,pjshorthorn,2018-07-10 17:59:00,5654,"If you are set on Lac Seul Then I would look at the west end of the lake where most Lodges are located. The rest of the lake sections tend to be more remote with boat in and fly-in as the most common way to access those camps.The west end is Easily accessible up the 105 out of Vermilion Bay. If you don't want to drive further north, give Vermilion Bay Lodge on Eagle Lake a look. Good fishing, easy location to get to and Gord and Suzanne do a great job making you feel at home......plus Gord cleans your fish for you while you relax. Having said that, you will be in Musky Mecca out of Gord's lodge. He even has a Musky Madness week in September that sounds to be very popular. Best of both worlds with the chance to hone your walleye skills close to the lodge, fish musky if you want to and at a very affordable price. PjShorthorn"
6219880,rather-be-fishin,2018-07-10 21:20:00,429,Lac Seul is a Walleye factory! NW end by Ear Falls has several resorts & easy access. Scarce Muskies. You won't be disappointed! Check out these resorts: Lac Seul Lodge Fisherman's Cove Onaway Lodge Evergreen Gawley's Golden Eagle Goose Bay Goldpines CherRob White Wing Scout Lake Good luck! 10 days & counting down to our 14th year fishing trip to awesome Lac Seul! Can't wait! RBF
