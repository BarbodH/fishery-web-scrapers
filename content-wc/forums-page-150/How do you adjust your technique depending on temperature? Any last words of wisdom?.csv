6220762,andreindy,2018-07-12 18:40:00,308,How do you adjust your technique when/if temperature cools down? I leave for Abamasagi in the Nakina area in a few hours. I see a forecast for Sat/Sun with highs in the 80's. Then Monday and rest of week is low 70's for a high. Any general principles you would recommend for condition changes like that? Thank you all. Will report out upon return!

The thought that almost always comes to mind during cold fronts at this point in the season is to SLOW DOWN!Cold fronts are a fact of life for anglers. I have seen many situations during the summer and autumn where the walleyes never moved from where they were before the cold front arrived. They just went belly to the bottom in the same place they were before the cold front arrived. I find that the walleye's strike zone shrinks to about zero when they are pasted tight to the bottom. They will still bite, but lures must be presented very slowly as they will not move far to chase a lure.The thought that is always in the front of my mind when fishing for walleyes during the summer and autumn is as follows: what depth of water are the walleyes holding in? The following thought during cold fronts is as follows: SLOW!Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6222060,BornToFish,2018-07-16 09:16:00,1224,"Greetings,Aspen: that is a great saying! I'm going to keep that one for future reference.It seems to me that during cold front conditions, I need to put the jig+bait within three inches of their nose, and keep it there for a while, in order to get them to bite. I often times do not put up big numbers of fish doing this, but commonly put up better numbers than most people in camp on that same day. This technique of being glacially slow is tedious, but it works better for me than throwing up my arms and admitting defeat.I use this slow technique in spots that showed me good fish before the cold front arrived. I increase my reliance on my electronics to ensure that the fish are still there. The fish commonly look like ""smears"" on the bottom of the lake. I believe that fish are laying belly to the bottom, often within cracks in the rocks.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
