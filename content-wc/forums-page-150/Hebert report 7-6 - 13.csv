6222216,MikeG1,2018-07-16 16:55:00,433,"Experienced a variety of weather during our week, from 40’s to 90’s. Surface water temp around 69. Fish were between 25 and 35 fow, worms caught almost 100% of eyes used on 3/8oz jig. Color did not matter. We caught around 700 eyes during the week...before anyone begins to criticize me about keeping numbers, Hebert requires a daily report of fish caught, eaten and released. This was my second trip to cabin 26 and last trip we caught over 1600. But, this trip we found larger eyes. Largest was 30’’, second was 29 1/2, with others being 25,24, And 23. 7 pike were taken but no size. 2 of the guys were novices but by tues they got the hang of it.We had a bear visit camp, found him looking in our window one night. Chased him away and never saw him again. Great trip. Great outfitter. GreaT time...until next year."
6222262,phishfearme,2018-07-16 18:56:00,1242,if anyone critiques you for keeping track of the number of fish you caught then just ignore them. sounds like you had a great trip and that's all that matters. thanks for the report. phish
6222376,fishron,2018-07-17 06:17:00,317,"Thanks for the report, Mike. We had three great trips to Hebert but my crew has issues with the drive. Next year we will fly with Air Tamarac to the Moselle Territory and fish a smaller lake with walleye, pike, lakers and brook trout. Our cabin will be on an island that's not much more than a large rock. (Small island, breeze=no bugs). Shorter drive on hard roads. It won't match Heberts great walleye fishing but if I don't want to fish alone, it's a good option."
6222402,Rondogpike,2018-07-17 07:03:00,24,"Hey MikeG1, My group keeps track of fish caught per day per man. We have a small amount of $ on the line for most fish, largest walleye and largest pike. I have kept records for years and it's interesting how the numbers vary from day to day and year to year. These records include wind direction, air and water temps, observed conditions (i.e., mayfly hatch, pollen line, weeds, bottom type, depth, color, presentation), critter sightings, needed items for next year or things to cut out. Not sure why anyone would criticize you for keeping track. All the best."
6222500,Doublelung76,2018-07-17 10:28:00,42,"Congrats on the 30"" walleye,if my memory serves me correctly that walleye was caught in the boat that stopped 30' in front of my son and I and idled for about 15 min right on top of the drop off my son and I where fishing for about 2 hrs prior.the guy who caught it was one of the novices I would presume?the prison stare and short casts right next to the boat i made didnt even phase the jerk in front of boat that told him to go right in front of us.it wasn't until I made him aware that if I can hit his boat with an easy cast he might be too close!it amazes me that on a huge lake like Hebert and on a big submerged structure like seagull island some one can have balls to do that.i would never even do that to someone in my own party,but I guess some people lack that common courtesy I was taught long ago!and by the way Daniel told me u guys were from Pa. as well so maybe we'll meet again.in a location I might not be so cordial.if it wasn't your party my apologies for highjacking thread but I don't think so.always remember,it's a small world and karma will jump up and bite ya when u don't expect it!"
6222502,Doublelung76,2018-07-17 10:31:00,42,"Sorry for rant but I had to let it out pal.report for the week 414 walleye,for 2 fisherman,28"" was the biggest and 211 eyes where caught by my son and i on that thursday when the wind finally subsided.as has been said before Hebert truly is a walleye factory!"

6222606,RickOnt,2018-07-17 14:58:00,217,Hey Doublehung You are so right!!! No excuse at all for another boat to move in on top of you If you can bounce a jig off there boat that is ridiculously close. Too bad it was not a personal boat A one once jig off the side might get them to move. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\if they say anything Tell them you are not a very good fisherman.
6222722,MikeG1,2018-07-17 21:34:00,433,"I'm sorry to read that someone idled next to you for 15 min., caught a nice eye, and made you mad. I CAN assure you that it was NOT me; I cannot say if it was someone in our camp or not. Hebert is really not as huge as you indicate, but it is large enough that not all boats from the same party fish together at all times and I often did not fish with my party. I do not know where each boat was at all times, but I know that I saw numerous boats on Seagull that were not with my party during that week. I'd venture to say that almost all boats in camp fished Seagull sometime that week and with a full camp I'd venture to guess that's around 17 boats. So I would not know who encroached on you. Regardless, it's too bad that 15 minutes ruined your trip. I'm not sure why you hijacked this thread to publicly criticize me for something with which I was not involved. Another option, and in my opinion a better option, would have been to PM me, ask questions and get information; which you can still do. Instead, you made broad based assumptions and presumptions which appear to have little basis for fact. Even your post questions if it was someone in my party, for which you then apologize. It's clear you really don't know what you are talking about. And, you write that you may not be cordial if we were to meet; why the need to threaten me? I don't know you, but I will say that I retaliate when cornered...I'll leave it as that. What kind of guy are you that threathens someone for fishing too close to you for 15min? Surely not a Christian. Again, I assure you that I did not encroach of your spot, so calm down. Obviously you don't boat on Lake Erie. While not correct, boats encroach on you all the time, often in violation of coast guard rules. If I got mad every time someone fished too close, trolled too close to my boards, or failed to pass port-to-port, I'd be a total mess. Instead, I take it in stride. I don't look on message boards to find someone to blame. And I surely wouldn't threaten someone, even if I 100% knew who it was. But, we are all who we are, and that's you. Since you referred to karma, know it works both ways. Again, sorry that 15 minutes ruined what could have been a great trip for you and yours. I'll not be replying to any more posts on this thread about this issue. If you feel the need to discuss, pm me. My goal with this post was to provide a report to other anglers about my latest great trip to Hebert, nothing more. Mike"

Fishing was slow to start as the fish were just starting to migrate to the bigger pools in the north end of the lake,many cold fronts put fish down,when this happens you need to fish deeper,Worms were the ticket.as the may fly hatch started so did the bite,by Friday the north end of the lake was on fire,sat was even better. All day bite. One boat boated 200 that day, Total 1435 walleye &32 Pike, Walleye from 28"" and less, Pike 38"" -20"" A slow week compaired to what we a used to (1700+) 2019 is booked see you next yr."
