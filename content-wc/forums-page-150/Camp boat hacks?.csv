6217900,Twins_dad,2018-07-06 05:32:00,38,"I used these recently to make my life a little easier. I took a plastic 3-rod holder and bungeed it to the back of my seat to keep rods out of the way. I took a 2-foot section of pool noodle, split it down the side, and put it on the gunnel to hang lures. Lastly, I bought an $11 bilge pump and a couple feet of hose. I powered it with my sonar battery. Empties the bilge in about 15 seconds."
6217904,jambi,2018-07-06 05:52:00,504,"Many great ideas here... -I like to anchor - sometimes there are anchors at the outposts. Rarely on the portages. Rocks and rope can be used, but I bring a basket ball net, tie ends together and fill w/ rocks for my outpost anchor. I've had the same net for 7 or 8 years now. I started w/ a laundry bag but it didn't hold up like a bball net."
6218140,andreindy,2018-07-06 16:26:00,308,It is so funny that you mention this. I came up with the exact same idea! The group I am fishing with may just need to anchor and stay still for a bit. I could think of nothing better than a basketball net for some rocks.
6218200,btyreprich,2018-07-07 04:10:00,1067,"I bing along a few Microfiber towels in the boat. Place these towels underneath the reals to keep them from getting scratched. The towels can also be dipped in the lake and placed around your neck to cool off in hot sunny days. We also place large garbage bags over the seats to keep them dry. When not cooking fish for shore lunch, I use an old back pack to hold the items we need to cook our burgers and hot dogs: grill grates, paper plates, metal bbq tongs, etc. the back pack is a bright green color - easy to see so it's unlikely to be left behind as we leave the island."
6219018,labsrus,2018-07-09 10:00:00,557,"Lots of good ideas I have a board that I have a ram mount ball attached to for the fish finder, just use a ratchet strap around the bench to hold it. I have the suction cup mount for the transducer We will bring the thick closed cell foam hunting seats to sit on in the boat, always seems that the foam in the boats seats is worn out"
6222144,jackpotjohnny48,2018-07-16 13:13:00,153,"Thanks for sharing this post and the youtube video, as I thought it was a brilliant idea.But I do have a question....You mentioned that the rubber bands might sometimes pull the through wire from musky baits.Quite naturally, I started to wonder if this technique might do some damage to rapalas, as many of the rapalas are made from balsa.Are you saying that the rubber bands, because the hooks would be under constant tension, would eventually pull the hooks out of the body of the bait?This is not something I would have intuitively guessed, since I don't think that the tension pressure is all that great.Have you ever tried this with original floating rapalas, or do you recommend against doing this with all balsa lures?Thanks in advance for clarifying.""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"

6087657,yoopertrout,2018-03-26 11:32:00,1172,Pretty slick! Where did you get the brackets for the bouys?
6087713,BornToFish,2018-03-26 11:39:00,1224,"Greetings,I live in Appleton, WI. I bought the bracket for the marker buoys many years ago - probably fifteen years or so. I don't remember where I purchased it, but am confident that it would most likely have been Fleet Farm or The Sportsman (a local fishing tackle store). The milk crate and marker buoy bracket work very well. I like to keep things organized while in the boat. About 80% of our fishing stuff fits in this milk crate. I have a small tackle box in the boat for miscellaneous small tackle that accounts for most everything else. This tackle box is similar to what I had when I was a child.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6088353,Mojo-NC,2018-03-26 15:10:00,1929,"Hi Juls, I couldn't help but notice that on all of your spoons where you switched out treble hooks with single hooks, you have the hook pointed ""down"" toward the concave side of the spoon rather than ""up"" toward the convex side. Does it matter which direction the hook is oriented, and if it were switched would you have a greater number of missed fish or possibly hookups through the lower jaw of the fish? Just curious."

I saw that I can get my hands on the rectangular shape crate, I was originally wondering if it might be too large and take up too much room in the boat. But I bet it wouldn't. I would think the crate would actually create more usable space because everything isn't spread all over the boat (like the entire surface area of my kitchen and dining room tables)."

It looks remarkable similar to the Lindy product mentioned in the post by Joe Walleye, with the link to the Lindy website. I'm pretty sure that is what I have. Many thanks to Joe for the follow-up.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6217386,andreindy,2018-07-04 17:25:00,308,"Well, I took quite a few of the great ideas here and put together two identical milk crates for our trip that begins next week Saturday. Most of the stuff I had laying around, some totaled a few dollars at Ace. Made places for pliers, snips, spreader, hook remover to be really secure. They won't fall out. I added some u-bolts where I have clippers, flashlight, tape measure, etc, where they can attach by carabiner. (One of the crates has a place where an E-trex is secured). There is also easy on/off location to secure the hand held walkie talkies. Backside has marker buoy mount. And a pool noodle to attach lures that are in purgatory between boxes, etc. There are small rope-like bungee cords that stretch perfectly, if needed, to many spots on the crate and can keep the Plano 3700 boxes from tipping or other things remaining secure."
6217480,Rondogpike,2018-07-05 06:06:00,24,"We have been flying in for years. In addition to a portable locator for each boat I bring: A new sponge A can of fly spray (we call it pig barn spray and when the ankle biters come out it does it's job well). A small cooler that I transport my reels, GPS, camera, etc to camp and then use daily in the boat. A hand towel (we fish crawlers and a wet towel keeps the remaining chunk fresh and in 1 spot). A plastic box with lid with spare batteries, lake map, first aid kit, spare line/spool, bug dope, sunscreen, rain gear, etc., etc."

For those who have to ""relieve themselves"" way to often, I have a plastic whiffle ball bat with the ends cut off and a piece of pool noodle zip tied to it so it will float, gives you the proper distance without leaning, and the noodle allows for flushing. And we NEVER leave the dock without diaper wipes. For the obvious reason, (no need to try and keep them dry), use to clean hands, sanitary, can clean a cut as well. And when dry is a great fire starter."

It just keeps on going.My milk crate will just accommodate a Plano size 3700 plastic box. I can fit several in the milk crate. I generally have 1-3 Plano boxes in the milk crate at any time. One of them contains a broad selection of many different ""go to"" lures and terminal tackle. This one stays in the boat all week.The other Plano boxes get swapped in and out as needed during the course of the week. I have a bunch of them in reserve in the truck. For example, I might take out the Plano box of top-water lures and substitute another box with spoons.I wonder how the rectangular milk crate would work, as suggested in one of the earlier posts.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6086777,pjshorthorn,2018-03-26 07:36:00,5654,"Some fishing members on our trips ( who will remain anonymous) have had a problem with keeping the cap on the jug when taking a bathroom break. To eliminate stains that eventually take away from the beauty of plush carpeting in the boat, I came up with a versatile version that allows for the ultimate flexibility while fishing and relieving themselves at the same time.Just bait up, throw the hose over the side and keep on trolling. Add a rope to keep it around your neck and you are hands free ......fishing and peeing. I'm not going to comment on what happens if you actually get a fish on during this process. That should be left for campfire stories. Why would the jug be painted neon orange you ask? I would want everyone on the lake to see another marker bouy being ready for deployment......so to speak.

Never done a fly-in, but will be this year. Perhaps my attempts to be the supreme ruler of those 14 feet will be futile and everything will be in rebellion in an hour. In exchange, I can send you my wife's ""life hacks"" about how to better peel an orange, ball up socks or shape your eyebrows."
