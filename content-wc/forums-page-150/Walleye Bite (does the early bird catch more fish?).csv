But I will also then get my pick of starting spots for the day. As for more for fish or a better bite at that time, sometimes, it depends on if my calculations the evening before were correct."
6214024,ogilville,2018-06-27 06:02:00,262,I know for me and my buddy over the years the early bite is worth getting on the water. We are usually the first or second boat to leave the dock in the morning all week. Some of the other guys say they would rather sleep in and get started a little later. There are many times we can have 20 or 30 Walleyes caught before they even get started. Of course not always but worth it for us to be out there fishing.
6214038,rockape,2018-06-27 06:30:00,215,"Our group never gets up at the crack of dawn to fish for anything. We once were that wild group getting drunk and playing euchre till 4am. Not anymore. We fish hard from about 9am until sometimes 10pm. We get up, eat a great egg and pig breakfast, pack a cooler with multiple sandwiches and snacks, and stay out all day. It is too far to keep running back to the cabin. I have taken some great naps in the boat! We have never had a problem catching fish no matter what time. Some of our best walleye bites have been mid-afternoon! I would say it seems we catch bigger fish after 5pm. You just have to have a line in the water when that feeding window hits. We are on vacation on the Canada fishing trip. We know we will catch fish no matter what. The experience of cooking a killer breakfast and sapping a few bloody Mary's with great friends is awesome. Relaxing and enjoying the whole experience while getting enough sleep to fish in the sun for 10 hours is what we do. Pike bite all day long, and muskies don't get started until the afternoon anyway!"
6214092,spurs101,2018-06-27 08:18:00,635,"Wouldn't miss the early morning bite at dawn. On the water @5 around daybreak. Breakfast @ 8 at the lodge. I seldom see any camp boats early morning and can be a very productive time. Can't deny that the hours between 10:30 and 2PM are some of the most productive. Even on bluebird days, you just adjust and go deeper. Plenty of time to get back to camp, relax, nap, have a brew. Dinner around 5. Back on the water a couple hours before sunset. After sunset and one hour after, the walleyes shutdown. The water I fish is very clear, rock rubble structure with hardly any weed growth on the main lake. This pattern has been consistent through the years."
6214126,The tank,2018-06-27 08:57:00,340,What weve found is it depends on time of year. Warmer water the earlier the better. When we fish the first couple of weeks after opening day when the waters cool i dont think it matters if you get out a little later in the morning.
6214702,Weawalleye,2018-06-28 16:52:00,8,"I go by water temperature. Early in the year my logs show when water temperature are low 10 to 2 are prime. This has proven true for walleye in lakes, and fly fishing for browns and rainbows in Rivers. As early summer arrives and water temperatures go above 55Â°f I want to be on the water at first lite and the last four hours of daylight."
6214764,kona77,2018-06-28 18:43:00,236,"Being on the water early is never a priority for our group. We always fish fly-in lakes and are the only group on the water.. We have been blessed to fish some really good lakes where a 40-50 walleye/day is just an average day and 100+ is a reasonable expectation. We always have a big breakfast and we are usually on the water by 8am.I saw some comments from guys who fish larger lakes like Lac Seul and they want to beat other guys to ""hot spots"" or just beat the crowds at the boat docks.. I understand that rationale and I do know the early morning bite on many lakes back home is one of the best of the day."
6214976,kcguy68,2018-06-29 08:59:00,51,Lots of really good feedback. I appreciate everyone who took the time to weigh in on this matter.
6220998,Guest,2018-07-13 10:28:00,0,"Without a doubt the best Walleye action is between Sunrise and a couple of hours after sunrise. That comes from 20 years experience fishing before work (leave dock at 5am and leave fishing spot at 7am to make my 8am shift) Saturdays and Sundays I would arrive the same time and stay till noon with the action being pretty sparse after 8 am. Regarding Canada, I fish on Lake St Joe and they wont let you leave the landing much before 7:30 which is my only complaint about the lodge. Cant blame them for not wanting to get up that early. Same theory on asking for best place to fish - the lodge will always send you to an area that minimizes gas comsumption"
6221230,Live to jig,2018-07-13 19:52:00,159,"We have really been working the night bite the last couple of years. In for dinner at 5 or 6 then back on the lake from 8-10:30 ish, seems like the bigger fish are more active."
6213766,kcguy68,2018-06-26 12:04:00,51,"How early do walleye turn on in the morning? We once had a lodge owner that told us that they typically don't start biting until mid morning...9am or so. The place we go to now serves breakfast around 7am, and we typically aren't on the lake fishing until 8am or so. So my question is this: Are we missing out on some good fishing opportunities by not going out earlier in the morning? Would like to get some thoughts on this from the board."
6213774,bigwalleye1,2018-06-26 12:16:00,2632,"Yes you are missing out. When we used to get bait when the lodge opened at 7, and got to our spots at 7:45, and the fish are biting right now, they we biting an hour ago, and you weren't there. The higher the sun gets, typically, the more light penetration. We now get up at 4:30 to get coffee and roll, and the fish are still biting when we get there. I'll trade an hour of good fishing in the morning for an hour of tough bite and a cool shower and a nap in the afternoon."
6213788,BornToFish,2018-06-26 12:50:00,1224,"Greetings,I've seen the walleye bite go both ways relative to the question posed in the original post.I fished a particular lake in NW Ontario that is fairly deep, fairly clear and has considerable boating traffic. The walleye bite was first and last light during the July-August timeframe. I was typically leaving the dock around 4:30 a.m. - just light enough to see where I was going. The morning walleye bite typically slowed around 7:30 a.m. - 8:00 a.m. - about the time many folks were arriving at the dock. On the flip side, the evening walleye bite usually started about 60-90 minutes before dark. The middle of the day was a challenge to get walleyes to bite.I am now fishing a lake that has fairly stained water. I rate this lake as having light fishing pressure. The walleyes typically start biting early in the morning (i.e. first light), bite all day long and sustain the bite until last light. There have been many days when the best walleye bite is just after lunch - just the opposite of the aforementioned lake.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6213814,WallyWarrior,2018-06-26 13:52:00,2488,"I'm a morning bite believer. Sure there are times and places that it doesn't matter, but that first couple hours after first light has always been the best for me. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6213826,mjayn,2018-06-26 14:20:00,1188,"Depends on the trip. Most of my trips are long weekends with a 6-7 hour drive after work. On these trips its really hard to get an early start until the 2nd or 3rd day. I usually fish 8-9am until dark. If its a canada trip or a trip that I rent a house on the lake, I usually jump in the boat and will be out at 5:30 am for an hour or two, come back for breakfast. Then fish from late morning until dark. I have noticed that while fish do bite in the morning, I don't believe they bite more every time. If you are on a pattern with a morning bite, then stick with it. I play it by ear in general."
6213828,DaBirdman,2018-06-26 14:21:00,164,"Where we go, the water is stained and weather conditions rule the roost more so than time of day. I've done a lot of the 5:00am dock departures and sure, the fish are biting when I got to the spots. But not so significantly more than the days I sleep in until 7:00 or 8:00. I never fish that last hour of light...I prefer to keep the blood IN my body and not feed mosquitoes. Ha."
6213830,Bill Krejca,2018-06-26 14:21:00,6107,"Pretty much what Born said. It depends on the water. My experience has been in clearer water, earlier is usually better. I try to hit an eastern shore, the walleyes seem to be in the shadows until the sun's shadow is gone. Same logic in the evening -hit the west shore in the shadow. With less clear water, early, they don't seem to be able to see food easily until the sunlight comes to their aid. In the evening, the shadows and creeping darkness seem to maybe restrict their eyesight. Somethings, generalities, which bear mentioning, or repeating, maybe: Walleyes, being able to see better in dim light, use this ability to find food which cannot see as well in dim light. Dim light may be such as shadows in the morning/evening, even as shadows created by rocks nearer to the bottom - even though near the surface there are no visible shadows. The fish are not necessarily blinded by bright light, as we used to maybe think, but rather seek light factors which put them at an advantage over their prey. Bill"
6213838,PRO-V16,2018-06-26 14:36:00,454,"I agree it depends upon the lake - traffic/dark/clear. We fish the eastern 1/3 of Lac Seul and it doesn't seem to make a difference. Catch 'em before sun-up, throughout the day and right up until we can't see. Then we get them off the dock after dark."
6213882,Darrenf442,2018-06-26 16:25:00,1369,"There are many reports that say walleye feed aggressively at night, so maybe you should be sleeping all day and fish all night"
6213910,jaym,2018-06-26 18:30:00,89,"""There are many reports that say walleye feed aggressively at night, so maybe you should be sleeping all day and fish all night"". Always thought about that but mosquitoes feed aggressively at night too."
