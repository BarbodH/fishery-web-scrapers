6222132,hugepike0,2018-07-16 12:34:00,28,Hi there! - So I need some help - I am going to a lodge where you can get guides if you want for your 8-9 hour day of fishing - I am planning on getting a guide for a day or two as the lake is very large and I thought a guide could help us get a handle on things - we have never used guides before. My question is what do you tip a guide for a day (two guys in boat) Any thoughts appreciated - thanks!
6222134,bthomas3333,2018-07-16 12:44:00,465,From my experience the tip is normally around $100 p/d for the boat. If two guys around $50 each.Brett

6222164,hugepike0,2018-07-16 14:35:00,28,actually I am hoping they will show me a LOT of the lake = really just looking for rocks/shelves areas to avoid - I was also thinking 50 per man - thanks
6222412,Northpoint,2018-07-17 07:34:00,38,My practice was generally to tip $200 per day with a $250 extra big fish bonus for my wife and I. We are both over 60 and need a little extra time. My experience with this was that it generally was well worth the extra money to make the trip extra special. I realize not everyone can do this but we have been blessed and I always try to pay for performance whether its when we are out to eat or a recommended raise for staff at work. Some guides did not get the top amount and I always tried to think about the extra effort that they put in to do things like take good care to make sure my wife could enjoy fishing and keep the shore lunch short and make sure the boat ride was smooth where possible. We have fished with probably 15 different guides over the years and one stands out a the very top with no real close second but several grouped at a small notch down. That's my 2 cents worth and I expect some will flame me for wasting money.....but sometimes in life you get what you pay for. P.S. Don't forget the other staff. I worked at a resort just about 50 years ago and recall how important those tips were.

6222582,dhottle,2018-07-17 13:13:00,163,Tip your guide as you fill fit. It's your personal choice. Rule of thumb is to tip 10-20 percent of the guides fee for the day per man.
