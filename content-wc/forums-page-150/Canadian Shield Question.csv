I found a website that says the sunrise is at close to 9a.m., and the sunset is after midnight. Is there any truth to this? With all the things I was planning for, this never occurred to me. Also, if anyone has been to Charlotte and wants to share any advice, I will happily accept it. Ive met some great people on this site and cant wait to come back with reports. Thanks in advance"

It's not that far north of Montreal, so plug that into the website below and print it out. Or google some other source.https://www.sunrisesunset.com/Canada/Quebec/"
