If I'm not guiding I'm prefishing for tournaments. Theres a big bass tournament on Rainy Lake in July and a walleye tourney in Emo at the end of May. LOTW in MOrson has one in August. If interested in a day of fishing or maybe someone is coming here and is going by or something, we could just go fishing if you have a boat I wouldn't charge anything then. So if you want to come fishing this way and want to experience any of these waters please email me or call. [email protected] or (807)274-4934"
