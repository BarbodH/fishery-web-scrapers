519746,Guest,2002-05-03 07:08:00,0,Hey canadian guy! Its always your buddies that get caught eh! (lol). Hey were do you fish? Listen to this one i had a buddy (lol) who bought a used truck 2 years ago well he used it to cross the border and as luck would have it he got searched. Well needless to say they have a 0 tolerance to drugs apparently there was some pot seeds in the carpeting under the seat. This is funny (not to him) because he has never smoked it in his life. Lesson to anyone buying a used vehicle give it the once twice and three times over before crossing.

519747,Guest,2002-05-03 19:29:00,0,"usa7......I fish many NW Ontario lakes including Nipigon for specs and lake trout. Walleye are my favourite and spend most of my time hunting these. I spend at least 80 days a year on the water and harvest Moose most years with our party. Wild game is a staple in our family diet by choice. Partying and fishing go hand in hand in this area......... ""A man has got to know his limitations"". A little pot and beer never hurt anybody as long as you are in control and in a controlled environment. I have no problem at all with yank anglers or DUI whether recent or past. I have a problem with those who have the mightier than thou attitude who come from a foreign country and have a problem with the rules as we set out. We live in a distinct country that is ours to govern and make rules as we seem fit in a democratic way. I disagree with the rules that bar you boys from coming here because of a past thing such as DUI .....but untill the rules are changed by us you boys are just going to hang tight. Good fishing in the upcoming year....Stay safe........."
519734,PWaldow123,2002-05-02 13:42:00,198,Anyone wanting info on this subject can e-mail me and I will be happy to send you an article that I received on the subject[[email protected]]
519739,Guest,2002-05-02 13:54:00,0,"Boycott Canada and don't give them a dime of our good old american dollars. Plenty of lakes offer as good if not better fishing, and it would be alot cheaper per pound of fillets when you consider gas, bait, lodging ect. and those other ""fees"". Kab, Namakan, and a whole bunch of other lakes are in the ""american"" shield and offer fine fishing and scenery and solitude. Support our american lodge operators, let Canadian anglers support their's. Heck if you want to really get away from it you could make 2 trips to the BWCA for the price of 1 trip into Canada. No hassles either, eh!"
519735,Guest,2002-05-02 13:57:00,0,"Hey Boys, Why dont we just all meet in Northren Minnesota and have a big party. We could all sit around and tell about our DUI and maybe have prizes for who was the drunkest. We could build a big campfire out of our fishing poles and our crankbaits. To bad those non DUI boys will be catching fish on those beautiful Canadian Lakes....Oh well...we need some more ice....."
519744,Guest,2002-05-02 14:53:00,0,Maybe someone should consider being a little more responsible when they drink if they are so concerned about this DUI law...... these people chose to drink and then drive.....

519731,Guest,2002-05-02 15:52:00,0,Canadian antics eh ....Have fun in Minnesota dude....I'd love to come and have a few brew with you and be an ambassador but...you know how it is...a few of my buddies have got recreational pot convictions and are permanently barred from your country....seems drinking and driving is a minor offence in the USA.....a pot conviction is a life time thing......
519740,Guest,2002-05-02 17:12:00,0,Have a great summer guest........I know I will.
519743,Guest,2002-05-02 17:16:00,0,"There is the root of most of the border problems. Those guys on both sides of the border are like any other group of employees...many, many do not know squat! The women DO seem to know the rules really well, check with a customs WOMAN to get a CORRECT answer.This method has been working for me for over 30 yearsHey... whatever works...eh? (No ...I am not a woman.)"

519741,Guest,2002-05-02 17:53:00,0,">Have a great summer guest........I know I will. Yep you too, Panama Red. Got a trip to Lac Suel in June, and I live right here by our Lake of the Woods, so it'll be another great summer, if it ever warms up that is."
519722,Rocky,2002-05-02 06:03:00,5,I spoke to the Ft. Francis immigration office today and was told there is no such thing as a June 28th date set for convictions more than 10 years old not counting against you. In fact they said they don't know the date it may come into effect or if it will EVER come into effect.
519723,Guest,2002-05-02 07:24:00,0,What! I have a feeling northern Minnesota will benifit greatly from canada's antics here. It might be time to invest in a resort close to the border guys!!!!
519724,Firetiger,2002-05-02 08:07:00,53,Canada's antics? It's the same going the other way buddy!
519725,Guest,2002-05-02 08:15:00,0,"Hey firetiger, different country's different laws you should check the facts first buddy!"
519726,Guest,2002-05-02 08:36:00,0,Our group just made back up plan incase we don't get across the border. I think MN resorts are all for the ridicules Canadian laws. They are going to have a record year.
519727,Guest,2002-05-02 09:52:00,0,"There is nothing wrong with Canada's laws, just as there's nothing wrong with America's laws....they're just different to protect the country's (either) perceived best interests.After all, the only person you can blame for the consequences of a DUI is yourself or person in your party that had the violation. Canada is not to blame. I'm not saying a DUI, especially a very old one, should prevent you from entering Canada. That seems a bit ""over the top"". But, it's the way it is. I've known plenty of Canadians that bust into their case of Blue before they leave The Beer Store parking lot. There's plenty of beer-slugging drivers up in Canada, and probably quite a few with DUIs. There's plenty in America too.But hey, if you are going from America to Canada, you're visiting a foreign country and you have to play by CANADA'S rules...no matter how ridiculous the rules seem to you. Northern Minnesota is a reasonable facsimile of Western Ontario, right?"
519728,Guest,2002-05-02 10:02:00,0,You can't really say that the law is protecting their country because if you pay $200 at the border you can be miraculously rehabilitated. It just seems like a way to extort money from people.
519733,Rocky,2002-05-02 10:09:00,5,Hey guys I didn't want to start U.S.A/Canadian fued thing again I simply wanted to state that there is a lot of conflicting information out there about the 10 year old conviction rule. Other folks on the board have said yes it is definetily coming into effect June 28th but yet the immigration office says no. I just want to know the truth.
519729,Guest,2002-05-02 10:30:00,0,"If you want to go to Canada, like I do, just do your homework and go.Immigrations did tell me the law DID pass and WILL go into affect on June 28 of this year. I mentioned our June 25 trip to the man and he said ""too bad it couldn't be 3 days later then you would have no record to be concerned. I talked right to the chief officer at Ft. Francis to confirm this. Very nice fella.7 out"
519730,Rocky,2002-05-02 11:17:00,5,Guide #7 thanks for the info. Maybe I just talked to the wrong person at immigration. I just don't know why he didn't come right out and say yes it has passed as of June 28th. thanks again
