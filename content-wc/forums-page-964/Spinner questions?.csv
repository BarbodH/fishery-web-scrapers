Anyway, I would like some imput from the experts here on the best rigs. What kind of hooks (style, size), blades (colors, sizes), leaders (#test, length), beads (color, size, number), and anything else that might be important. Thanks for the help."
519778,Guest,2002-05-03 04:13:00,0,Hi WinnieI would try these websites - they are very informative - I just started making my own spinners also - they turned out excellent.http://www.luremaking.com - these guys have all the supplies and there in Canada - so it costs even less with the exchange...they also have some how too guides.http://www.tacklemaking.com/ - this is the top of the line website - anything you want to know about making tackle can be found here.Let me know how you make out
519779,Big Tim,2002-05-03 04:26:00,63,"The spinners we used last year we got from the guide & the camp (Lac Seul Lodge) All used #3-1/2 colorado blades, chartreuse if it was sunny, hammered gold if it was cloudy. & # 1/0 light wire aberdeen hooks, strung on about 24 in. of 17 lb. line. We also were taught to use these with an in line 3/8th oz sinker with a swivel built into it. I've tried to find a better (cheaper) source for them & have yet to find a cheaper place than four seasons sports in Ear Falls. They were about 3/1.00. get lots 'cause you will loose a few, even with the light wire hooks."
519780,Guest,2002-05-03 08:45:00,0,"Hey Winnie,I've been tying my own spinners for quite awhile now and the best piece of advise I can give is to use the best hook you can find - you can go cheaper on any of the other components but not the hooks. I use the Normark brand #6 typically, but #4's are good depending on what you want to use for bait. If you want to add a stinger hook simply go smaller to a #10. The problem I've found with no name hooks and even some named hooks is that they require sharpening before using and usually the metal that is used is of inferior quality so it difficult to get the hook sharp.As for beads go to the craft store and pick up a package of 3 or 5 mm mixed beads. They come in packs of 100 to 500 and you will pay a fraction of the cost.Finally I use 10 or 12lbs. Vanishing line for the snell. The Vanishing line simply disappears in the water."

Here are my suggestions12-14 LB Vanish line#4 or #5 colorado spinners of various colorslength of spinners. Some 2 ft and some 3 ft and some 4 ft. The length really does seem to make a difference on some daysuse the plastic clevis as you can put different color spinners on itnumber 4 of 5 beads of different colorshooks - have found the circle hooks to be excellenthow to make - tie a good sweivel, put on 1 bead, put on the clevis, next put on 4-5 beads and then tie hookweight - 3/4 oz to 1 1/2 oz bead wt.If you have any questions let me know.
