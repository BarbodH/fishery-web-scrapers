We have been fishing Sawmill Bay, McKenzie Bay & the Sanctuary mainly in very shallow water, 1-5 ft, using jig & minnows. We have caught a lot of 'eyes up to 21"", but only a couple that were 24""-27"". Don't get me wrong this is a lot of fun,although I can catch these size 'eyes where I live in northern MN without the drive.We go to Lac Seul to have a better chance to catch 'eyes in the 29""-31"" range. As we hear and read articles about this all the time. Does anyone have any suggections on what we are doing wrong or what we can do to improve our chances to get a wallhanger(location, bait, presentation, tactics, etc.)?"

You won't catch as many but the fish will be bigger. Where the ""action"" is > is where the males are hanging around. Usually once the females lay their eggs, they move out away from the spawing areas. Ya might try it > works for me.I'll be up in May to experience the early bite this year..Set the hook...."

With the possibility of a late ice out this year, where do you expect to be catching fish? In late May are Broad and Sunlight Lakes likely good bets after a late spawn (if that's the case)? Give me the scoop, brother. I want this trip to be a monumental one."
519529,Guest,2002-04-29 19:20:00,0,"Be there there 5/19-5/31, stayin in cabin #7 or 5 (depends on Andrea)Be drivin a green Tundra (Neb. plates) on land and a white Triton on water.If ice isn't gone > plan b is to trailer to the river and fish that.Would suck, but then I didn't drive 800+ miles to look @ the lake and think about fishing!As for fishing on the lake>my guess is Winnasaga river, Sawmill Bay and any of the creeks that feed LS. Never been up this early in the year>always been up 1-3rd week in June the past 8 years.Pray for a WARM 3 weeks!!!!Mp3553"
519530,Winnie,2002-04-30 07:39:00,375,"Look forward to seeing you up there. I think we'll be in #1, the one on the very end with the screened porch, Kansas and Minnesota plates, although I'm not sure which vehicles yet. We don't pull a boat up there, so we'll be using Andrea's boats. I'll be following the ice out very closely for the next three weeks. I hope the spawn is not pushed back too far. Any guess what types of presentations might be most effective? I'm pulling together my tackle and need to decide how many and what kinds of spinners to make. Also what colors, sizes of jigs to pick up, if more are needed. What are you thinking for this early in the season? Also, have you ever had any luck throwing or pulling cranks up there?"
519531,Guest,2002-04-30 19:48:00,0,"Best guess is pitching jigs will be my first choice, slip bobbers, spinners and then cranks. Guessing the eyes to be in 5'-10' of water and maybe even shallower. Depends on water temp and spawn cycle.Cranks have produced for me. The very first year up @ LS I killed them on cranks. Hot n Tots and walleye divers > that was the week after July 4th. Have caught then on cranks since>many times will pull cranks to locate eyes and then go back with spinners or jigs. Quick way to find active fish. I too am keeping an eye on the Ice situation>>>>can always go fish the river!MP"
519532,Guest,2002-04-30 19:54:00,0,"Forgot....Jig colorsChartruse, hunters orange, combo chart/orange, glow white.Sure you can get all the other colors under the rainbow but those 4 colors will cover the gammit. 1/4-3/8oz on the lake 3/8-1/2oz on the river. Minnows work well>go with what you feel comfie with...ie minnows, crawlers, leaches, twister tails"
519533,Winnie,2002-05-01 21:38:00,375,"Thanks. Curious, do you fish with curly tails and minnows on the jig at the same time, or just minnows on a bare jig? Also, thought the rivers were closed at the mouth until June 1. I think that's been the case the last two years I've been up there during the last week of May. Talked to Andrea yesterday, and she said that since we start fishing the 25th, we shouldn't have any problems with the ice, but the people up the week before might. Hard to tell right now. Said they are definately having a late spring."
