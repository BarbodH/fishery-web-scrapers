518555,Guest,2002-03-28 20:30:00,0,"thanks for all is responses, sounds like we should have a great trip!!I've got spring fever!!!!,and can't wait to head north to wet a line, listen to the loons sing, and drink a cold canadian beer. A few more questions. What can we expect for Northerns? Is there an area of the lake that holds larger hogs this time of the year? Or should we spend most of our time on the walleyes and lake trout? This canoe spoon please help me to locate them. Feel free to contact me at [email protected] thanks again and make sure you give the hogs a kiss and let them go!!!!"
518556,Guest,2002-03-30 11:04:00,0,"I would target trout and walleye, however there will be good pike fishin south of Cornhuskers, spoons and inline spinners work well. Canoe spoons are made by Lucky Strike there are only two sizes, you can buy them from True Value Hardware in La Ronge or stock up at Canadian Tire in Prince Albert. For Lakers buy the larger size in white with one red dot and try a straight silver as well. Also inline #5Blue Fox spinners in white AND LARGE kWIKFISH.Simple Mepps spinners in silver #4's with beef heart are killers that time of year for walleye. Good luck and see you there!!!"
518557,Guest,2002-05-03 15:19:00,0,Heading to La Ronge in May???? Better read this first:http://www.canada.com/regina/leaderpost/story.asp?id={D678F6A3-1D53-480F-ADFB-79120AE73DFA}
518558,Guest,2002-05-05 08:52:00,0,"Cool weather a concern for anglersScott Foster Regina Leader Post Angling outfitters and tackle shopkeepers are hoping to reel in the heat so the ice that threatens their livelihoods will melt in time for the fishing season's imminent kickoff. ""If nothing's in gear by the (Victoria Day) long weekend, I'll start panicking,"" says Greg Prokopetz, manager of Pokey's Tackle Shop on Osler Street. ""You have to remember, we only have six weeks of summer. You never make it up in a million years if you miss one weekend.""Some fishing hot spots on Lac La Ronge are reportedly covered by one metre to 1.5 metres of ice, which is ""just not normal for this time of year,"" says Peter Ashcroft, acting provincial sports fish specialist with Saskatchewan Environment. Some of Ashcroft's contacts in the La Ronge area say some of the bigger lakes, including Lac La Ronge and Montreal Lake, will not be open in time for the region's May 18 start date. La Ronge falls into the ""central zone,"" spanning from Nipawin in the south to Southend in the north.Some outfitters in this central area do not expect the ice cover to fully disappear until the first week of June, which could shorten the season and gouge profits. ""Places around here are booking up fast for May, but it's not looking good for them right now,"" says Morris Gabrush, co-manager of Churchill River Voyageur Lodge in La Ronge. Gabrush and his partner are not taking any chances. They haven't made any May bookings ever since ""they got burnt"" five years ago when the lake's ice didn't melt until mid-June. Hal Stupnikoff, executive director of the Saskatchewan Outfitters Association, concedes the cold weather may result in ""a loss of traffic"" and will stand to hurt the industry if the chilly climes drag out.""When you're dealing with a (finite) season, every day counts.""Wayne Miskolczi of Environment Canada expects the present cold spell -- caused by a cold front from the Yukon and northern Alberta -- to continue for the next 10 days at least. Further into May, overnight lows will gradually resemble average, ""above-zero"" norms for this time of year, he says.Southern Saskatchewan's angling community can breathe a little easier than those in La Ronge, says Todd Graham, manager of Great Northern Rod & Reel & Archery on Park Street. Graham has been calling outfitters located on Last Mountain Lake and Lake Diefenbaker ""almost every day"" to ask about the conditions. He says the south end of Last Mountain Lake, from Craven to Pelican Point, will be ice-free by May 4. That's when the ""southern zone's"" season begins. Spots such as Riverhurst on Lake Diefenbaker also ""have a good chance of being free of ice"" as well.Nonetheless, the lake water will need time to warm up following any major melt, which means the earlier part of the fishing season may not yield as many catches, says Ashcroft. Prokopetz is not fazed by the season's initial forecasts: ""May is usually reserved for 'die-hard' fishers anyway.""Â© Copyright 2002 Regina Leader Post"
518542,Guest,2002-03-24 08:45:00,0,"Making a trip up to Lac LaRonge last week of May, staying at Cornhusker Fishing Camp on Hunter Bay. This is my first trip up to this lake and would appreciate any advise on locations, lures, or any comments that might make our trip more sucessfull. Also I've never fished for lake trout and need some help. Thanks for any help!!"
518543,Guest,2002-03-24 13:44:00,0,"we are also going to La Ronge in May- the 18th - to Cornhusker.We don't have much information either. We were told medium tackle for walleyes and med to heavy for northern and lake trout. Don't know much about the type of lures for trout, but i expect pretty much the same as the northern."
518544,Bryan,2002-03-24 18:14:00,244,"Hey Guys.I have fished that area in late May and early june for better than 20 years for both Walleye and Lake trout. My favorite for walleye is a yellow 1/4 oz. jig head with a yellow power grub tail and a minnow. Don't worry about leeches this time of year. The water is to cold and the leeches just curl up in a ball as soon as they hit the water. Cast, let jig hit bottom and reteive in short jerks (6"" to 12) very, very slowly. The bite can be very soft. As for lake trout, I would recommend trolling Canadian Wigglers (2-3mph) in 10-20 feet of water. At this time of year the cold water keeps the trout in shallow. I have had good luck with silver or chartreuse wigglers. Ask your host for trout areas as they are not everywhere in the lake. Don't worry about getting Canadian Wigglers, they are everywhere up here. Go to Gene's Sporting Good's in LaRonge and they will have plenty of tackle and bait. Good Luck and take warm cloth's and your rain gear. Remeber, LaRonge is a big lake with hundreds of islands and lots of open water and reefs. Be Careful."
518545,Guest,2002-03-24 20:20:00,0,Bryan;what is a canadian wiggler?
518546,DLH,2002-03-24 20:30:00,1,I AM LIKE JAS----WHAT IS A CANADIAN WIGGLER. ALSO DID YOU HAVE ANY LUCK WITH NIGHTCRAWLERS FOR WALLEYE. ANY INFO ON LARGE NORTHERNS???
518547,Bryan,2002-03-24 21:42:00,244,"Have a look at their website.http://www.canadianwiggler.com/Northerns will bite on just about anything you hang in the water. They will take your jig heads or your wigglers, rapalas, thundersticks, spoons or any thing else you through out there. If you are going to fish them specifically(sp) use about a 12"" wire leader, you'll take home a lot more of your tackle. For trout just tie a snap swivel to your line and attach the lure to it.I use a lot of crawlers for walleye a little later in the spring, but early on I find minnows to be better. I would certainly have both along but I don't even take leeches with me that early in the year. The ice will have only been off the lake for a week or so when you get there.I would recommend 4-6 lb. test on a 6' light or medium light rod for walleye and 6-10 lb. test on a 6'6""-7'6"" medium rod for lakers and northerns. Keep your drag set properly cause there's no telling when a big northern will hit your walleye rigs."
518548,DLH,2002-03-26 20:30:00,1,"HOW DO YOU GET MINNOWS TO CAMP? WHERE DO YOU PURCHASE THEM? ARE THEY HARD TO KEEP? WE USE A LOT OF MINNOWS EARLY IN OUR PART OF THE COUNTRY EARLY AND THEN SWITCH TO CRAWLERS LATER SO THE PATTERN MAKES SENSE. WAS AT CORNHUSKER LAST YEAR ON THE 25TH OF MAY, USED CRAWLERS AND HAD UNBLIEVEBLE SUCCESS ON WALLEYE BUT REALLY GOT HOSED ON NORTHERNS. (GUIDE TOOK OFFENCE OF MY GPS. NEEDLESS TO SAY WE NEVER SAW MUCH IN THE WAY OF NORTHERNS!!!!)ONLY FISHED ONE AFTERNOON FOR LAKE TROUT, TWO BOATS CAUGHT 8, ALL ON HELLBENDERS AND RISTO-RAPS.ANY PARTICULAR COLOR ON THE CANADIAN WIGGLER WORK BEST? HOW ABOUT THE JOINTED ONES?"
518549,Bryan,2002-03-27 07:09:00,244,"DLH:I have had good luck with silver or chartreuse/white wigglers. The jointed ones worked fine as well. As far as the minnows go, you can't use live bait here(except for crawlers and leeches) so buy the minnows frozen and just keep them packed on ice. You can buy all you need at Gene's Sporting Goods in LaRonge, it's right on the main drag just off the water near where the Athabasca Airlines planes dock and if you've been to La Ronge before you know its not that big a place. Try throwing spoons or trolling in shallow areas(<6') for Northerns. Look for areas where the wind is blowing baitfish into shore along cat tail or wild rice beds, shallow bays, etc. Where are you driving/flying from?P.S. I saw your girlfriend ""Sophie Ratfat"" laying out in front of the bar and she said she can't wait to see you again. LOL!!!!Good Luck on the trip."
518551,Guest,2002-03-27 15:01:00,0,"You are definetly going at the right time of year. You can probably expect to catch 40-50 walleyes weighing 3-8 pounds this time of the year. (last year first day we got 7 over 6.5 pounds)I have hired a guide the last 4 years can't remember his name but he lives in La Ronge and guides for several camps and runs his own Lund sometimes. Real nice boat, dual console and 135 Merc. (can find out his name if you want) Best baits are spinner rigs behind bottom bouncers with beef heart or worms. Also fast troll Husky Jerks for bigger fish but fewer numbers.Walleye fishing in Pickerel Bay is nothing short of incredible!!!\\For Lake Trout the best bait bar none in Hunter's Bay is a white Canoe Spoon with red dot.(the bigger the better) All the locals fish this bait almost exclusively, you can probably expect most of the trout from the surface to about 50 feet, best bet is to bring some 2 and 3 ounce weights to run on 3 way rigs.(half wave spoons I have been told are also good)Be prepared for big fish, 20 pound test minimum for the lakers. Lots of fish in the mid teens right up to 30 plus.Hope this helps."
