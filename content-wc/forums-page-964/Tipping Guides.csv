Then I met another girl that worked for him for a year (they didn't know each other) and she said the exact same thing. It's too bad but obviously not all resort owners are honest, but it's a small minority."
519452,Guest,2002-05-02 15:56:00,0,"negative. talk about having your cake and eating it too. owning a lodge is not like working a table in a restaurant. the waitress at the lodge...the dock guy, maids if theyre there...find working their lodge job work. an owner doing what he loves and getting tipped on top of it? any none owner guide id tip but the owner has a responsibility to provide a means to catch fish to customers. if he cant provide adequate service then look elsewhere. the exception would be a guy or gal who's trying to get started....let the owner be the businessman of the camp. i never tipped a charter boat captain.....he already had our money via his fare. the owner you may be talking about gets the same thing....but his assets grow."

519454,stewart,2002-05-02 16:39:00,100,"Speaking of taxes... If I remember correctly in a restaurant waitresses get taxed a certain percentage for whatever amount your meal is, just to make sure the government gets a cut of her tips. If you don't tip she losses money. So be kind to the waitress on your trips up :)."
519455,Guest,2002-05-02 18:08:00,0,"I own a lodge in canada, on Rainy Lake. I for one do not think people should tip me. I do have guest's that try and try to, but if they insist, I just tell them to give it to the staff. If I am guiding, usually it means my staff are busy do other things around camp or are gone for a short, well deserved, lets say stint in town. They do work very hard to make people's vacations the best ever. None of them expect tips ( they are paid well). But I must say they do enjoy getting them lol. Service does not depend on tips though. I have seen places where it does. Actually my staff and probably many others just like to be treated with respect. Even though people might just think they are the dock boys or the cabin girls. They are doing their jobs to make your vacations better. Treat them with respect and you will see how many fishing holes they will show you. Fish ON, our ice is out on our bay."
519441,Dave,2002-04-21 12:46:00,258,We are considering hiring a guide to fish for Lake Trout which we have never done. The guide would be the owner of the resort where we are staying. Would you give him a tip at the end of the day?
519442,outdoor fanatic,2002-04-21 13:08:00,90,"I would definitely tip. The amount would depend on how well we did and/or how hard he worked to put you on to fish. A little bit spent on a tip could pay dividends later, plus, most of the guides are pretty decent people and a little cash never hurts."
519443,PJM,2002-04-21 22:16:00,3516,"DaveTipping is very important and not just the guides but even the people working the docks. You tip the person giving your bait most likley you will get more. I tipped a guide in Canada last year that didn't even take us out. He just showed me some spots on a map and also we invited him over for some dinner. Believe me, tipping I goes along way"
519444,Dave,2002-04-22 07:52:00,258,I guess my question is since the guide is the owner of the resort would you tip him when you get back to the dock or at the end of the week when you settle your bill.
519445,Walleye Wacker,2002-04-22 08:37:00,6,I tip everbody who assists me in catching fish at the Resort. I have fished with the Owner and have tipped him after fishing and when leaving at the end of the trip. Tipping makes you feel good and will result in better service the next time they see you. Last year one of the guys in my party caught a 13lb walleye and tipped the Guide $100 for a $60 day.....the next day the same Guide took him out and fished for three extra hours with him and they caught a 9lb Walleye during the last 15 minutes.....They were both HAPPY
519446,River_eye,2002-04-22 15:39:00,1486,"I guide at a remote resort in Manitoba. Generally, I do not think that it would be expected that you tip the owner. He is already making money off of all the other guides. It's the guides and other staff that depend on the tips for a living, the owner does not. My boss would never take a piece of the house tip, or accept a personal tip, all gratuities go to his hard working staff."
519447,Walleye Wacker,2002-04-23 05:42:00,6,If the owner wants to put his tips in a pot for the staff I say Hooray. I think the important point is that when you tip anyone you are extending extra thanks if he wants to share it or buy beer thats his choice....catch and release
519448,stewart,2002-04-23 10:21:00,100,"I think I remember from a tipping etiquette guide I read sometime that tipping an owner is not necessary, but I guess you could."
519449,Guest,2002-04-24 05:37:00,0,"Depending on the resort, not all owners will share tips given to them.This includes a general staff tip that is given to the owner at the end of the week. During the week, it best to tactifully find out from the staff what happens to tips."
519450,Guest,2002-04-24 09:43:00,0,I just want to make sure... you said that some owners do not share a general tip that is left when paying at the end of the week?
