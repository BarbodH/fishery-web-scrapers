519668,Guest,2002-04-30 21:17:00,0,"I'm fairly familar with RedGut, but we have never fished northerns when there. Got any tips on what spots and lures. For early W's we gennerally hit Porter's, Crooked, Spawn, and some rocks on the west side of Baseline. Any info on the northers would be appreciated. Moses"
519669,rainy,2002-04-30 21:29:00,21,hello moses try the noth shore from parry strait to porters inlet in the mornning than go back on the south shore. spoons and spinner baits should land you some big fish.otter tail has always given up some big northern but wait till the sun is high.
519670,Guest,2002-05-01 08:22:00,0,"Hi Rainy,My dad, brother and I are going to be staying at Coppins, I think it is right along Bear Pas, the week of June 15. What is the resort and the owners like? I also understand you can reach Red Gut, Seine and Swell Bays from thier camp? It will be the first time we have been to Rainy in the early summer. Any tips on locations for walleyes and crappies? We will also be fishing smallies and from the info. I have received they aren't real tough to catch that time of the year? Any help would be greatly appreciated!!Thanks in advance!!Renn"
519671,Guest,2002-05-01 17:11:00,0,We are going to coppins May 25th. Its a great area. Send me your email and I will let you know how we did. [email protected]
519672,Guest,2002-05-02 21:41:00,0,"First Coppens is a great place. Second, by the second week of June the smallmouth fishing will be wild. Just about any rockpile or rocky point will have smallmouth present. The mouth of the Seine River will still be holding lots of W's. Red Pine narrows on the north side of Baseline will hold W's. Don't be afraid to go 35 to 45 feet if they're not in 10 to 20'. The mouth of Porter's Inlet will hold W's as will the bays and points on both sides of the southern approach. Try pulling cranks ( Bombers, #9 Shad Raps or any white or perch minnow crank) around the bays in this area 2.5 to 3 MPH. If you locate some concentrated fish in the bays then go to jigs and minnows. Tip for Rainy. Learn this now and save 10 years of messing around. Sunny day fish very early. 5 AM to 10 AM - Then 7:00 PM to Dark. Cloudy day. Fish all day and move shallow 3 to 20 feet. But don't waste time if they are not there move deeper then back to shallow again. Crappies are in Porters .TGG"
519673,Guest,2002-05-03 07:50:00,0,"TGG,Thanks for the great info. My dad and I are anxious to get on some of those Rainy Lake slab crappies. If you have any other places to try for crappies it would be appreciated! I am already restless at night just thinking about getting the opportunity to fish Rainy in June. I have fished Canada for 29 years and still get excited everytime I go!!!Thanks again,Renn"
