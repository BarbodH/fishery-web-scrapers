In terms of Bronco on the dock with a bad back for a week, well it is kind of funny now, but it wasn't then!PS As far as Canada goes, there isn't too many boulder hazards for your lower units, but it you want to know where to hit them, I can tell you!"
518368,Guest,2002-04-23 07:02:00,0,"Gullrock will not let you down, the camp owners have done a great job taking care of the fishery. Sorry about the ""back"" comment Bronco, just kidding!!!Grits"
518360,2746,2002-04-23 08:01:00,3206,Have been going to Canada for years but am not familiar with Gullrock. Where is it and does anyone have an e-mail address for lodges there or web sites? Thanks!
518361,jigger,2002-04-23 18:20:00,55,Larry M take a look at www.fivelakeslodge.com thats where we're going don't know any other website.We hope Gullrock is as good as it sound!
518362,2746,2002-04-24 08:32:00,3206,"Thanks Jigger, looks good. We're spending opening week on Eagle Lake but that hasn't been my favorite place...too much traffic. Will be going back in summer and fall and always looking for somthing new. Thanks again for the help."
518369,Guest,2002-04-25 05:57:00,0,jigger I've been at 5lakes lodge since the mid 80's the place has come a along way. Bud & Malinda have made it a much more enjoyable place to go. The cabin are clean and the docks are good. As far as fishing I'd try the big rock about 100yrd. from camp but if your new there Bud will get you on fish.
518370,Guest,2002-04-28 14:18:00,0,Jigger when you heading up there we'll be there in July.
518371,Guest,2002-04-29 05:37:00,0,Just booked for Sept. on Gullrock dose anybody fish at that time? Is the fishing as good as they say? We have heard alot of big fish at that time.
518372,OHIOPILOT,2002-04-30 19:00:00,19,"This will be our 3rd year at Gullrock- we stay at Golden Hook. Prior to this we had been fishing Packwash/Bruce for about 20-sme years, theres no comparison! The walleye fishing is great, fishing off the docks at night after dinner is a nightly ritual and every night we land several 20+ inchers. During the day we focus more on the northern and thats great too. Anyone know of a site like this that focuses on the Northern?"

518354,Guest,2002-03-19 16:58:00,0,Going to this lodge this summer any advise on the lake. How's the resort?
518355,2 DOGS,2002-03-20 06:30:00,361,"If I didn't stay at Lac Seul, Gullrock would be my next choice. Have heard nothing but good things about both the lake and lodge. Talked to many who fish there and fishing is excellant all summer long."
518356,Guest,2002-03-20 12:35:00,0,"I have been going to Gull Rock for 14 years. I stay at Weaver's. I have friends that stay at Five Lakes. Haven't heard a complaint, except it is quite aways away from the main lake. I love gull Rock and Keg Lake. you want specifics. [email protected]"
518357,Guest,2002-03-21 07:31:00,0,I've stayed all the the camps on Gullrock and found Five Lakes Lodge to be the best place for the price the service is great and the owners Bud&Malinda are hard to beat. The camp is located on the main lake SW corner not much pressure down there which is fine by me we have no problem catching fish around camp.
518358,Guest,2002-03-23 03:20:00,0,"HelloThis is my 4th year at Five Lakes Lodge, it is a great place with great fishing. Email me and I can let you know some specifics.[email protected]"
518359,Guest,2002-03-25 08:00:00,0,"Been fishing Gullrock for 20yrs. The fishing keeps getting better you will love it there is fish everywhere! All the lakes in system have there hot spots.About the camp, talked to alot of guys that go there(out on the lake) they have nothing but praise for the place."
518363,the_bronco,2002-04-21 13:51:00,86,"Jigger, I have been going to Gullrock for 14 years now and have stayed at five lakes lodge and two others on this chain of lakes, as stated earlier, for the money, you can't go wrong here! The saddest day of the year for me is when I have to leave this walleye heaven at the end of the week. If this is your first time up here you are in for a big treat."
518364,jigger,2002-04-22 06:15:00,55,Thanks for the replys guys I've been talking to alot guys that go to Gullrock and they all say the same the lakes are walleye factory so we can't wait to get there!!!
