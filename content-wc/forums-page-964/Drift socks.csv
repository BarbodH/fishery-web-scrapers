519560,stewart,2002-04-25 09:48:00,100,"I've used one, but mostly not worth the hassle, especially if your limited in what you can lug in."
519561,Guest,2002-04-25 12:55:00,0,"AS a camp owner I don't know why more guys don't use socks. One of my guest took me out and we used his it kept us on the spot longer and we caught more fish. Take one on your trip they don't take up any room, there not a hassle when their putting fish in the boat."
519562,Guest,2002-04-25 19:00:00,0,"I take a small drift sock with me on every trip to Canada. I can't fly in my trolling motor and bateries but I can usually position myself for a slow drift with the wind and get much the same effect. My sock must weigh all of 3 pounds and then a bit more for the rope. When my buddies get blown all over the lake, I put the sock out and rig or jig."
519563,Guest,2002-05-02 16:16:00,0,yes once. unless it's big open water with a long number of drifts...it is definitely not worth it. by the time you find a good drift to use it......the week will be over. they do work....dont misunderstand me and real well...but if you find fish....anchor and ride out the rough weather working around with jigs....on a fly-in? geez i hope you know the place well.
519564,Boots,2002-05-03 21:48:00,19,We go to Canada every year and have considered using a drift sock. I have a 16 foot Mirrocraft and fish with 3 of us in the boat. Now I dont mind wearing a raincoat when it rains but I was concerned that everytime you pull it in we would get everything wet. Also with all the poles and tackel boxes in the boat I would probably get the sock tangeled into our gear. Is there a hassel with these socks as I described?
519565,stewart,2002-05-04 20:57:00,100,"Well, the water pulls out of the bag, but I guess it can drip. It is another piece of gear to hang around in the boat, and if people aren't used to them they can tangle on it when it's deployed.It's sometimes good to have, but I find I can manage pretty well without one most of the time. Kind of backtroll drift when I want to drift but it's too fast."
