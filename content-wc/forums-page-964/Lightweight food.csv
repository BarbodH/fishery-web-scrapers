When a person adds up the tackle, beer, soda, clothes etc. we are really close to the weight limits.Suggestions?"

I've used them quite a bit and you would be surprised at how good they turn out. Gander Mountain is a good source for these, or any camping-hiking supply. If you drink juices use frozen concentrates for ice paks this saves space, as long as you have a place to keep things cold once you get there."

519703,Karl,2002-05-01 21:30:00,63,"Every place I've ever heard about has mid-week re-supply flight included in the cost, as well as two-way communication with base camp. My advice is bring whatever you want (within reason) and rely on the re-supply flight for heavy stuff like beer, soda, milk, more minnows, etc., to get through the rest of the week. Otherwise the usual:eggs, bacon, potatos, onions, steaks, crackers, cheese, bread, COFFEE, cooking oil, milk, cereal, boat snacks. I guess the point is forget about lightweight food, it tastes terrible, has no nutritional value and besides, you didn't spend all that money to go there to lose weight."

The Maruchan Ramen soups are really good for light meals and again weigh practically nothing. Instant mashed potatoes, mac and cheese and other dry foods like that really help. They are a good switch from fish, steak, fish, porkchop, fish meals. Don't worry about being a little overweight on the flight. Take the food you enjoy. The real weight killer on a flyin is case after case of beer and pop. Everyone likes beer but the number of cases some guys bring is nuts. Just enjoy yourselves, it's a vacation.Pooch"
519705,Guest,2002-05-02 07:05:00,0,"Well i bring 3 cases of beer and a botlle of vodka myself lite beer of course (lol). As far as food well we bring in chops, steaks and whatever else we want. There is plenty of good tasty morsoles in the pond infront of you. Its the 400lbs of clothes and tackle these people seem to think they need!"
519706,Guest,2002-05-02 07:15:00,0,"Hey Wisconeye,My rule of thumb is: accumulate everything that you're taking, take out the beer and then divide the rest of it in half (not the beer - NOT THE BEER!!! - you've got to be reasonable here!). We ALWAYS take too much - ALWAYS. Now this is assuming that you are catching fish and if its a flyin then you better be able to catch something. Forget about the steaks and any meat products - you'll be eating fish. Take powdered milk for the coffee and go buy yourself a water purifier (SweetWater or MSR make good ones) for drinking water - or just boil it, or get the chlorine drops."
519707,Guest,2002-05-02 09:26:00,0,This past August I went on a fly-in and the outfitter we used had an option to fly our beer & soda in prior to arrival. It cost more versus bringing it yourself but it was well worth it. They also provided the canned vegies & potatoes. It allowed us to bring all the gear we wanted plus we didn't have to go light on our meals. I'd check with your outfitter and see if they offer this as an option.
519708,Guest,2002-05-02 16:27:00,0,"sure. for lunch the mre's. you're not there to eat anyway.for breakfast the mre's. you're not there to eat anyway. cereal-powdered milk.for dinner....mre's..throw in the mre steak. and right....you're not there to eat anyway! i especially recommend moon pies. they're lightweight because of the lack of gravity when processed up there. cans not bottles, transfer liquids to plastic from glass, cut clothing down to a minimum-thin bags (id use garbage bags-you can use them twice), drink light beer-it's lighter. light tackle is good. light line,,, now that you're sick and tired of my recs.....spend the extra money for a 2nd air fly in with a 2nd set of coolers mid-week. a lot of places do it. its worth not hassling about this stuff before you even get to enjoy your trip. gotta have your pops right?"
