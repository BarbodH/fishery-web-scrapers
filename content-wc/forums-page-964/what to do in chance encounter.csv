519611,Guest,2002-05-01 09:15:00,0,Give him a pinch of kodiak chewing tabacco! Then when he is sick and puking give him a stone cold stunner and tag off to the big show! If still alive then the big show will give big foot the big boot (lol)! I think the fishing opener is just about here guys!!!!!
519612,Guest,2002-05-02 07:36:00,0,You're right we get quite a few up here but mainly 3 days before and after either a full-moon or a new moon. Any of this sound familiar?
519598,Guest,2002-04-28 12:22:00,0,"I was wondering what to do if we encounter some Saquatch up in Canada, I hear they are quite abundant. LOL!"
519599,bigfish1965,2002-04-28 19:40:00,3210,"Well, whenever we are in the forests of British Columbia, we pack certain precautions. We always bring a camera, because it is a well-known fact that Sasquatches and UFO's only appear before people who have no idea how to use a camera. If somehow we forget the camera, we always bring a bottle of Old Spice Cologne. The Sasquatch ( and other similarly hairy creatures ) are enthralled by the smell of it. Go figure. If we suspect that a bigfoot is following us, we simply drop the bottle of cologne and let it dribble out. While the sasquatch stops to enjoy the odour, we make our getaway."
519600,Wawajake,2002-04-29 04:53:00,413,Bring pepper spray !!The sasquatch like a little pepper with their meat . :)jake
519601,Northern Manitoban,2002-04-29 13:13:00,195,If you by chance see one then you might be lucky and be able to tie one on.As the Sasquatch love Kokanee Beer.I've been looking for one for years hope you have better luck.FISH ON.
519602,tracker,2002-04-29 13:20:00,91,Words of advice when traveling in the woods. Take a buddy with you and make sure he is bigger than you and out of shape. Odds if you are attacked by a Sasquatch or even a bear you should be able to outrun your buddy.
519603,Guest,2002-04-29 13:56:00,0,Well we know bigfoot would never make it from the good old usa to canada if he/she had a old (dwi)!
519604,Guest,2002-04-29 15:31:00,0,Ditto a canadian bigfoot going to the USA if he has been caught smoking a little pot. Pot smoking will get a bigfoot barred for life.
519605,Walleye Wacker,2002-04-30 13:12:00,6,"We take our own ""Sasquatch"" with us for emergencys like that. The guys in my group nicknamed my son...6-10 280lbs...Sasquatch. he really comes in very handy when heavy things have to be carried or firewood has to be chopped. The down side is he has a voracious appetite and can consume large quanitys of beer. He is a lot of fun to cram into an airplane too."
519606,BGunn,2002-04-30 13:28:00,880,"1) Start each sentence with the word ""Sir"".2) DO NOT offer him an American beer (even if it's the best you have).3) Do not ask him for his best spot for catching walleyes, but you should invite him to go fishing with you.4) If it's a female, DON'T tell her that fur makes her a-- look fat.5) End each sentence with the word ""eh?""."
519607,Guest,2002-04-30 14:10:00,0,If it sounds like John Madden just offer him a turkey with 8-10 legs on it and some gravy!
