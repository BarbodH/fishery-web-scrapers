519697,Iowa Eye,2002-05-01 15:50:00,104,I will be at a meeting at Fairmont Chateau Mont Tremblant located about 120 km north of Montreal (175 km NE of Ottowwa)at the end of August. I am looking for any reccomendations on fishing resorts or camps near that area. I would prefer a drive in (within 4-6 hours)but am open to a flyin. Looking for Walleyes and Northerns. I have fished alot in NW Ontario and Manitoba but I am unfimilliar with this area. I greatly appreciate any info or websites anyone has.

Fishing is fantastic - has an american plan with a good dining room, all you really need is your sleeping bag, personal items and your gear. It's best to fly in to his lodge and air service is very close to Mt Tremblant. You can drive in about six hours from Tremblant. Northwest of Parent."
