519995,Toolman,2002-05-12 14:29:00,2570,"Hey Beerman!I'm glad that you think that your opinion is to be held in such high regard. I bet everyone that knows you feels that way!I would consider myself a bit of a beer expert. Having spent a little time consuming (and enjoying) a wide variety of beers, both foriegn and domestic. I do believe that the popular, mass produced beers in the U.S. (my home country) and Canada are highly overrated. (No names but it rhymes with Budwiser and Labatts). I will say that a cold ""Blue"" tastes pretty good while overlooking the lake after a long day of catching walleye and pike (in Canada)! I had a beer a few years ago called Upper Canada Lager (also Dark). Do they still make it? I thought it was one of the best beers that I have ever tasted> (Could have been that long day on the water... thing too! (I must have too much time on my hands!!! LOL)Tim"
519996,Guest,2002-05-13 13:21:00,0,"Me and my Brothers have been fishing and drinking beer since we were pups....During a average day in canada each of us will drink two cases of beer and thats just before noon. We take a short nap and start drinking our afternoon cases. One day we even caught a Walleye...threw him back didnt want to hurt the population. Anyhow a beer is a beer is a beer.If you are a good beer drinker you dont have time to taste the flavor....flavor is for pop drinkers ...real men drink beer and plenty of it....NEEDED a fake ID so I can avoid all those nasty questions about DUI at the border....When I see you, I will buy you a cold one."
519997,Guest,2002-05-13 14:02:00,0,By the way we need another drinker for our trip. You wont need any fishing equipment(gets in the way)but you do have to bring your own beer. We can go anytime that is good for you and we can go any place you want to. We also have a portable ice machine so our beer is always cold. If you are tired of catching fish and want to do some real beer drinking let me hear from you.
519998,Guest,2002-05-13 17:10:00,0,It's only 4 days and 11 hours from our opener here in NW Ontario. Just to be an international sort of guy and to show my love of our southern neighbours I'm going to take a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon along with our regular goodies. I'm starting to feel all warm and fuzzy just thinking of those big walleyes and all the good times ahead.
519999,Guest,2002-06-04 16:15:00,0,any Canadian beer beats miller or milwaukee hands down
520000,Kodiak,2002-06-04 16:35:00,24,"I don't give a sh*t who likes what beer or who's beer is the best. The fact is that when your buddy passes you a miller, bud, or lybatts you will drink it without complaints. Sure you can have your favorite beer and call it the worlds greatest but it's only your opinion. Now lets drop this subject and talk more about fishing since we are on a fishing web site and not a beer drinking web site."
520001,RoyC,2002-06-04 17:51:00,274,"Hey Kodiak, I am just curious--why did you enter this posting and bother responding if you don't want to talk about beer?"
520002,Guest,2002-06-04 19:03:00,0,Walleye and beer are like bacon and eggs. They go hand in hand. The Pabst was great. Any beer is good...its the friends along with it that make beers great.
519986,Guest,2002-05-09 14:08:00,0,Isn't beer brewed with distilled water? I think the Americans can distill water.
519988,Homer,2002-05-09 14:27:00,1127,"If you want a truely GREAT Canadian Beer try any of the Sleeman's products. Excellent, excellent beer.ps Oh ya, Canadians make the best beer in the world. pss They're also taking home the Cup this year.ppss Where it belongs.ppsss In Canadapppsss Where they make great beer.pppssst t t t t t zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
519989,Kodiak,2002-05-09 15:05:00,24,"To all you beer drinkers. You haven't had a good brew until you've tasted a Champagne. That's right Miller High Life. It's soothing to the soul and tastes great as well. True Canadian beer is pretty good but nothing beats a High Life.That's just my opinion, I could be wrong.kodiak"
519987,Guest,2002-05-09 16:36:00,0,"The problem is, Budweiser is not American nor Canadian. It is from Pilsen (Czech Republic) I had a girlfriend who was born and raised in Pilsen and she told me all about beers and how Americans are trying to take credit for everything they copy. Thats the American spirit! Take advantage of all."
519990,Guest,2002-05-09 16:41:00,0,"My favorite beer is Hacker Pshorr Wiess, I haven't tried any Canadian beer yet, but I plan to when I visit the great country of Canada in June. Who knows maybe my favorite beer may change. Mike"
519991,Homer,2002-05-10 11:03:00,1127,You're wrong!
519992,Guest,2002-05-10 12:16:00,0,I think you ALL have it wrong. The best beer in the world is the one you grab out of your cooler full of ice and pop open on that hot summer day after catching your first fish of the day. Doesn't matter who put their name on the can.It doesn't get any better than that.
519993,Big Tim,2002-05-11 05:25:00,63,"Not all of us are wrong, See reply # 4"
519994,Guest,2002-05-11 18:52:00,0,Who cares beer is beer the purpose is to get drunk.... just takes more of your states piss
519970,Guest,2002-05-12 07:15:00,0,FREE BEER! COLD BEER! AND YOUR BEER! Thats the kind of BEER I like. Most beer is good to me some better than others. after 4 or 5 beers they all taste the same and come out the same color. After 30 years of on the job training and a beer belly I should know.
519977,Guest,2002-05-08 19:58:00,0,but you can get a free case if you find a dead rat in a Molson bottle!That is a hard deal to beat! eh?
519976,Guest,2002-05-08 20:11:00,0,Grrrr....May the walleye gods frown upon you with a breakoff at the boat of one of over 14lbs. (Us dogs have feelings too you know)
519978,Red Ruffandsore,2002-05-09 03:23:00,81,"The best mass manufactured beer is actually Italian....Moretti.The problem with international beers, is that they are not shipped refrigerated and usually not stored refrigerated. After three weeks the protiens have started breaking down and the taste goes in the crapper day by day. You may like Guiness from overseas....but from a three month old warm dusty bottle sitting in the sun?Stay off the pipe...and don't forget to wipe.Red"
519979,TangledAngler,2002-05-09 04:52:00,65,"I've had been in Germany, in Canada and, of course, here in the U.S. I'll put the Canadian brew up against them all. My fridge has a case of Blue in it right now."
519982,Guest,2002-05-09 07:23:00,0,"depends on if it's pasturized and I disagree about that italian beer, I dont believe it is good but thats my opinion, I do like guinness and another great brew I found is New Castle"
519980,Guest,2002-05-09 07:25:00,0,you aren't canadian are you???? becasue i think the only kind of person to post what you have must be canadian
519983,Guest,2002-05-09 08:54:00,0,"I could have sworn that the last case of Bud I bought in Canada said it was brewed in Canada. Doesn't that make Bud a Canadian beer too?Budweiser, King of Beers."
519984,Guest,2002-05-09 09:08:00,0,Bud is a good Canadian beer. It is different than the swill south of the border. Our pure water here is what makes our beer special. Americans have been trying to get Canadian water for years so they can brew a better beer.
519981,TangledAngler,2002-05-09 12:06:00,65,"Nope. I'm right here in Pittsburgh, PA"
519985,Tom,2002-05-09 13:14:00,1063,You boys are sure making me thirsty. Guess I will lean back in the old fishing room tie some lures and have a cold Canadian beer....wow this stuff is smooth.
519965,Guest,2002-05-08 15:29:00,0,"So many of you canadians boast about your beer but it can't hold a candle to beer from Ireland or Germany. Guinness or Paulaner put any beers from Canada to shame. Another myth is that canadian beer is so strong, the strongest beer in the world is made in Deleware of the U.S.A. If you are going to boast do it about something that is true like your great forests and lakes."
519966,Guest,2002-05-08 16:28:00,0,"You're right beer man...The Boston Brewing Company with founder Jim Koch produces ""Triple Bock"" with 17.5 % ABV.......the strongest beer in the world. His craft beer is second to none and he produces a great brew. I have had his Boston Lager and it is superb. Our beer is the greatest in the world though......Just ask any Canadian."
519967,Guest,2002-05-08 18:15:00,0,"Guinness? You must be joking? Heck, the used oil out of a 1972 Dodge Dart would not only look better in a tall glass, but likely taste better. That's not beer, it's some pike-skin oil mixture they add bog mud to and bottle it. Grab yourself a Blue, Kokonee, or Alexander Keiths. Guinness...jeesh."
519971,Guest,2002-05-08 18:23:00,0,"Beer from Ireland???????????????? are you serious?????????? German wheat beer maybe,,,,,,,,,,, drink Canadian and buy a pet beaver. They love those smart ##### Americans......Just like in the TV commercial."
519972,Guest,2002-05-08 18:26:00,0,"Why do you think God made so many different beers? Any beer drinker worth his stein will tell you HIS favorite is the BEST beer on earth. I want to hear anyone argue that most ANY beer tastes great when it's chasing a batch of fresh caught Walleye, fried up & still hot enough to burn your fingers!"
519968,Guest,2002-05-08 18:26:00,0,I think Canadian beer is awesome....maybe because the only time I drink it is when Im fishing in Canada. And as we all know thats as close to Heaven as it gets.
519973,Guest,2002-05-08 18:59:00,0,I'd have to take a round out of you there beer man if you were in the same room. We've got all these foreigners running around [playing hockey in our stadiums and now you tell us that those foreign beers are better than our true blue Canadian. You have to be one of those dog hating cat loving democrats talking like that. Shame......
519969,Guest,2002-05-08 19:10:00,0,"shows how little you know about quality brews, you would rather a piss water blue, I feel sorry for your under developed taste buds."
519974,Guest,2002-05-08 19:16:00,0,"wow you talk so tuff, not rerally you are actaully quite pathetic, people like you make me laugh with pitty, you are so caught up in your sad little world. The you talk about foreigners in your hockey arenas, well I guess you don't mind that there are canadian teams in the MLB or the NBA, it's to bad that idiots like you share air with the rest of us."
519975,Guest,2002-05-08 19:41:00,0,"What does any of this have to do with fishing??I saw this post earlier and thought it's way to stupid to respond to, but then I assumed this board was - nevermind............."
