520623,Guest,2002-05-24 20:17:00,0,"I was up there for opener. Main lake temp was 44 deg F. Caught lake trout in 3 feet of water where it was 53 deg. Caught a 28"", 27"" etc but overall pretty slow for walleyes. It was nice because the place was empty."
520624,Guest,2002-05-30 19:48:00,0,Thanks for the reply Bill. It IS nice to have the place to yourself. Anyone else been there this year? I am all fired up to go in 9 days. I hope the fish cooperate.

520626,Guest,2002-05-31 15:24:00,0,"Hey Junky, I like the name. Wish I had thought of it. Anyway, where do you fish on Kilvert's? We have gone there the last two years for at least one full day.Anyone fish lake trout or splake on Dogtooth? Or anywhere else for that matter? I would like to try for them a bit this year. If you do fish them, what techniques do you use and what locations? We will be there in one week. Surface temp should be around 57-62 (i hope).If anyone would like to respond in private, my e-mail is [email protected]"
520627,Guest,2002-05-31 20:51:00,0,"Joe where are you staying? I will be up there 6/9 thru 6/12. I am staying at Rushing River. Should be pretty good assuming the water is warming up. On opener we caught lake trout, whitefish, pike, smallies,walleyes in Kilvert and Dogtooth. Trout came from Kilvert."
