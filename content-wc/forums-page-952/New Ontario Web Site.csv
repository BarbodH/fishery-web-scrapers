519774,Guest,2002-06-04 17:21:00,0,Great reports on Lac Seul and the guests reports really tell it like it is--------I think. Anyway really enjoy this site. Kind of different from the usual.
519763,Guest,2002-05-14 09:16:00,0,"Have heard that most of the ice is out or almost on the lakes around the Lake of the Woods area, Eagle and Lac Seul. Don't know about farther north, would check Red Lake area."
519764,Guest,2002-05-18 09:27:00,0,The site seems to be up on current conditions in northwestern Ontario. He was even calling lodges and posting reports on his walleye forum page. Great fishing reports for Canada lovers.

519766,oldlogin,2002-05-21 12:18:00,22,"I see by the fishing reports that action is picking up in that area. He has about twenty fishing reports on his site at and it gives a good idea of what's going on. I am going up next week. Can't wait, Canada here I come."
519767,oldlogin,2002-05-22 06:02:00,22,"Post 13 is not mine. Don't know why someone would want to use my screen name. I have now registered my name with WC. I only wish I was the other ""oldlogin"" and was going North next week."
519768,Guest,2002-05-22 07:27:00,0,"I hear the fish are really hoping on the Woods and many other lakes in the area. It is the opinion of several that I have talked to that walleyes have not spawned as of yet. Many females have hard eggs in them, and thank God are being released. One camp which is in a bay said the action in the bay was awesome. Many people are going over a hundred a day. Running bottom bouncers slow in 7-14 feet of water using small blades tipped with a crawler on a three hook snell, with hooks placed two and one half inches apart are doing a good job. Jigs and minnows are working well, also. Actually the two methods used hand in hand, the bouncer as a search tool, and when you find them, stop and jig. Water is a little cold, however if you put them on the floor of the boat and step on them, they run straight and true. Finding warm water is the ticket. The main lakes are colder."
519769,Guest,2002-05-23 14:30:00,0,"Really update fishing reports, good one on Lac Seul."
519770,Guest,2002-05-25 08:30:00,0,"Looks like the lake trout are really going up there. With the late spring and cold water temps, they are still up shallow. Lots of big taken and hopefully released. I am leaving Sunday to fish Crow Lake for trout."
519771,Guest,2002-05-25 14:05:00,0,Not what I saw. The boats from Wiley Point Lodge were slaughtering the fish ... shorelunching on bulging females ... with no regard for conservation.
519772,Guest,2002-05-26 07:07:00,0,"They have some fishing spots listed on their site. It's great cause I a going to be a first timer on the Woods and all I have is a GPS, no knowledge. Really appreciate the help."

519754,oldlogin,2002-05-03 04:51:00,22,Guess I should have said great fishing site. I am not associated with the site in any way. Just thought I'd pass on useful information about fishing in Ontariohttp://www.justfishontario.com/
519755,Tom,2002-05-07 05:16:00,1063,"The got a heck of a lot of fishing reports, I liked that.Be good when season starts."
519756,Guest,2002-05-07 05:19:00,0,I noticed postings on ice conditions in thier fishing reports page and on message boards. Neat site.
519757,Guest,2002-05-07 19:28:00,0,The best site I have seen for northwestern Ontario. Hats off to them for knowing what to have on the site. I will be checking everyday and watching them fishing reports. Going to Seul in early June.
519758,Guest,2002-05-09 16:52:00,0,"Ice is still on most lakes in northwestern Ontario including the Woods, Eagle, Lac Seul and most of the others. However, from what I have been hearing it will go down to the wire, but they will be open. Now farther north, that's a horse of a different color. Check with outfitter."
519759,Guest,2002-05-10 14:37:00,0,I noticed the ice was out on a couple of lakes in northwestern Ontario. Keeping my fingers crossed but starting to look good. Ice out on Jackfish Lake near Perrault Falls.
519760,Guest,2002-05-11 13:03:00,0,"I hear the ice is out on Lac Seul, anyone no for sure?"

519762,Guest,2002-05-13 14:33:00,0,"I hear that in most areas it is. Some bays have a little bit, but it will be ok for opener the way it looks. If you are going, check with outfitter. Going pretty good now."
