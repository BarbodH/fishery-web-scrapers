You will know you are close when you see the Macdonalds Restaraunt on your way out of Sault but still on four lanes. So about a half mile past Macdonalds just stay on the highway , if you go past the Husky Truck stop you went too far, but don't worry keep driving to the town of Echo bay which is about another 15 minutes on Highway 17 and watch for Johns Gas Bar on right of Highway 17 its last gas station going thru Echo bay.They sell bait too . Neither carries a big selection . If you strike at at both then when you drive thru town of Thessalon at corner of hwy 17 and hwy 129 there is a good Outfitter store there with bait.jake"
