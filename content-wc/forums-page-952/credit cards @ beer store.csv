521083,srj,2002-06-05 06:57:00,971,"mookie, this is (haven't called in a long time-could have changed) their number:807-274-9664. Also, be aware if you pay with US money in an official Canadian agency--beer/liquor store--they have to give you the official exchange rate. Sure wish they still sold cream porter. Um-um good."
