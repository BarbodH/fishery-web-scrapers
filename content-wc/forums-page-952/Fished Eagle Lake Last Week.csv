Limited out on Pike (all under the slot), Walleye (three 16inch & one 24 1/2inch) and Lake Trout (two 6lb. fish). Caught everthing on spinners and minnows. Weather changed between 35 degrees F and 85 degrees F. Some rain and wind, but plenty of sun. Stopped by Conservation Officer at lodge, no issues, just a little upset that everybody in the group did not know the limit rules. Boarder cross at Int. Falls, no issues/minimal wait going into Canada (Sat. at 1:30pm), although the three vehicles infront of me were pulled over. No issues/minimal wait entering the States, just asked what I had (fish & t-shirts). You folks that get to fish these waters on a regulas basis should consider yourselves very luck!Bear"
520970,fishmaster,2002-06-01 08:58:00,209,I fished Eagle Lake opening week and your right that people who get to fish this Lake on a regular basis are lucky. I consider myself lucky that i have been fishing this lake since 1976 and i think this is one of the best lakes to fish and if you have a windy day you head to smaller lake.Fishing was great and lot more bigger walleye this year probably cause of the alte ice out.If you have not fished this lake and you are looking for a place to head to this is one of many you should try.Good luck !!!!!!!!!!
520971,Guest,2002-06-04 10:15:00,0,Did members of your group receive any tickets from the CO?
520972,fishmaster,2002-06-04 15:38:00,209,What is CO?
520973,Guest,2002-06-04 17:00:00,0,No ticket from the CO. We were way under our limit as a group (10 guys). I think he probably gave us a break because we answered all his questions honestly and a couple guys had only caught a few fish.
