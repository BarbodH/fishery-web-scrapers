Anyone know if the ice is breaking up yet? Also drop a line if you are fishing with Lakers this year. Good fishing to all.Atlanta Dave"

520456,Guest,2002-05-21 07:44:00,0,The ice is still on in Central Saskatchewan. I hope it breaks up soon!
520457,Guest,2002-06-04 16:08:00,0,I had a report come to me of Scott lake which is north of athabasca on the nwt. border. and it had 26 inches still on it last saturday and a high 5 degrees above freezing. I think it willl be open by the 15th. As long as we get some wind coming through.
520458,Atlanta Dave,2002-06-04 17:32:00,323,Thanks Sturgeon I fished Scott about 8 or so years ago. Hope all the ice is gone by the end of the week. Atlanta Dave
