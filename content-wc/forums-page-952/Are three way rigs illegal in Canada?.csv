If you use a leadhead jig as the dropper weight on a three way rig, wouldn't that put you over your allowable hook count for your one line, making a three way set up this way illegal. Thanks for the input."

A treble on a lure is considered one hook. A treble on its own is considered three hooks. ( Thats an odd old rule) You may have a total of FOUR hooks."
520951,brian1785,2002-06-01 08:25:00,1534,So a dropper jig and a floating jighead on a three way are legal...correct?
520952,bigfish1965,2002-06-01 18:08:00,3210,There is nothing I can see in the regs ( I am reading them now) that disallows it.
