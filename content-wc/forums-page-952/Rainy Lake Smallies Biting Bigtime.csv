520587,Guest,2002-06-04 18:37:00,0,Harv:Stanjikoming Bay is a sancuary and fishing anywhere past the posted signs is strictly prohibited until June 15th. I believe you can't even be carring a fishing rod in the boat when passing through this area. No fishing no matter what species. I'll stick to places further north.
520589,Guest,2002-06-04 18:47:00,0,Tom:Your observations are dead on. I haven't been lucky enough to catch a smallie on top water until water temps reach 64+. I'm not saying guys haven't caught fish on topwater early but I have never seen it before. If water temps come up (significantly) perhaps the topwater bite might pick up.
520590,Guest,2002-06-04 20:10:00,0,"I'm not saying anybodies knowledge is moot. I'm just saying how I'm catching some smallies, everybodies techniques and locations are different in my years of observing. I don't mean to offend anyone, if thats what I'm doing. We could have a friendly little wager for a day.Maybe someone can help me out, I'm looking for info on the Dryden Walleye Masters Walleye Tournament."
520578,Guest,2002-05-26 15:28:00,0,"Shad Rap, do you really expect me to believe some guys sitting in a office pushing a pencil. Maybe you should tell that to the walleye I ate last nite for supper, don't be jealous cause I know how, when, where to catch walleye and bass on Rainy Lake. Maybe if your on the water 100 days or better, then you can talk..."
520579,Guest,2002-05-28 09:31:00,0,"sure wish I knew which one of you's guys is right. I'm going to Rainey on Friday. If Harvey be right I'll by more worms. If the other guy is right, I'll buy more beer.So if ANYONE REALLY knows what's happening on Rainey right now, please let us hear from you."
520580,Guest,2002-05-29 05:11:00,0,"Well I'm not saying bring worms yet, minnows are still on for walleyes. Caught walleyes at the 7 mile bridge they call it around here, also if your down by seine river try the elbow should be biting good there or down towards grassy lake. Tried worms yesterday and nothing, tried some fat albert grubs in the salt and pepper, caught some smallies there, shoe bay for smallies for me and the mouth of stanji bay."
520581,Guest,2002-05-29 19:58:00,0,"Harvey .. hope you can fish better than you can read. never siad the walleye weren't biting ... they are. What I corrected you on was your totally false walleye and bass spawning. ""A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing"". The bass are still weeks away from bedding!"
520582,Guest,2002-06-02 00:24:00,0,"Hey you guys, who do you want to believe me or the other guy? I just won the first anagural Emo Walleye Tournament(10000 + 600 big weight of the day). Don't think you want to believe the other guy....ha....ha...COME FISHING WITH ME."
520583,rainy,2002-06-02 22:15:00,21,hi harvy congrats on the tourny win you earned it. good luck next year.you are going to have 50 teams trying to steal your glory. i know it only makes the game more interesting. keep up the good work.
520584,Guest,2002-06-02 22:41:00,0,"Thanx Rainy, the tournament was alot of fun and really tested a guys patience. I'm was hoping they would let 60 teams in for next year, was very impressed with Emo, hats off to them."
520585,Guest,2002-06-03 21:19:00,0,"I have been sitting back reading the messages on this subject for a couple of days.Let's finish this. While Harv was out winning the Rainy River walleye tournament,(Congrats) I have been out guiding clients for Smallmouth bass on Rainy Lake since the ice went out. I agree with Harvey that the smallies have been on the bite but they always are at this time of year, no news here. The spawning season is still a number of weeks away and smallies gotta stock up. Most of the big females have hardly eaten since mid winter so they must feed to nourish their eggs. Smallies are near spawning areas, males are shallow, females out deeper. To tell you the truth, we haven't caught any using top water nor crank baits yet. Finesse baits have been our ticket. Small craws and bait fish imitaters have produced best. I won't say what colours or brands, you'll have to experiment yourself (thats half the fun). Look for shoals and rockpile close to gravel bars and beaches and you have a potential hot spot. If the wind is blowing into the area, you have found your hot spot! Practice catch and release and we'll all be happy for a very long time!Jackfish"
520586,Guest,2002-06-04 11:34:00,0,"Thanks Jackfish, I will agree with you too, I was off on some of my info. But if you check the mouth of stanji bay and work some poppers I'm sure you'll have alot of fun. I'm not sure if stanji bay is open for smallies and not open for walleye though, but they must be really biting in there. I'm sure the smallies are weeks away from spawn but I'm still catching smallies in spawning bays but not seeing any beds. Again Thanks for the congrats Jackfish"
520588,Guest,2002-06-04 12:38:00,0,WHAT WERE THE WATER TEMPS ON RAINY FOR MAY 22nd? That answer should spell the story.Not many smallies hit topwater in 42 degree water.Am I wrong here or are my years of smallie observations moot?laterTom
520568,Guest,2002-05-22 21:27:00,0,"Just to report to you's that the smallmouth fishing is fantastic and last all day long. Getting most of the fish the brown skitter pop and just letting it sit for 2 seconds at a time. Almost all techniques work, working shallow crankbaits fast, new ambush lures working well, drop shot rigging working real good also, for some reason grub or tubes weighted down aren't working to well, I think its cause bass at this time of the year are protecting their nest from predators and a jig or tube being pulled on bottom doesn't represent a predator. So stay tuned, I'm going for walleye tomorrow on Rainy Lake"
520569,bbakes,2002-05-23 06:52:00,121,COOL
520570,Xplorer,2002-05-23 07:01:00,244,"bbakes, I think you had better check out the Ontario regs before you make comments like the above. Harvey fishes/guides out of Ft Frances and if i'm not mistaken the bass season in area 22 of Ontario is open all year long, and therefore he's not fishing out of season. I'm also guessing that Harvey is C/R'ing most/all fish, which has been my observation of most folks with smallies on my trips Rainy. Harvey, let us know how the walleye are going. Hoping to get up to the Bear Pass area possibly in either mid-June or late August. Xplorer"
520571,Guest,2002-05-23 09:26:00,0,"Hi all, just wanted to let you know I decided to stay in today, snowing outside. Probably have better luck fishing in the river for walleye."
520572,Gill,2002-05-23 14:30:00,129,"Harvey are you fishing on the Canadian side of the lake? Also, how is the fishing on the U.S. side of the lake in late June early July? Have not fished Rainy for a few years and may get that way this year. Has the fishing for eyes and smallies improved from previous years? Sorry for all the questions, but it helps to get input from those who have fished lately.Thanks,tight lines,Gill"
520573,Guest,2002-05-23 16:27:00,0,"Gill, I am fishing the canadian side and the states side is jumping at that time of the year. Smallmouth are back in a big way in size and quanity. I can't stress how fun it is right now for smallies, top water is soo much fun especially when a five pounder pounces on your bait. Call me if you make it up (807)274-4934 or [email protected]Yhanks"
520574,Guest,2002-05-25 07:44:00,0,Harvey ... think you're way off base. I live in Fort Frances ... water temp on Rainy is barely mid-40s. It will be weeks before the bass are on beds. Oneof the coldest springs on record. The walleye haven't even finished spawning!!!!!By the way all ... it's essentially C&R regulations till July .. tho most don't kill bass anytime.
520575,Guest,2002-05-25 09:39:00,0,Harvey ... I agree with Shad ... the bass are NOT spawning on Rainy. At least not the Rainy near Fort Frances. Just spent the week there and the water temp 3 feet down is only 39 degrees. It will be another month before they're bedding! They need it at least another 10 - 15 degrees. Most years that is mid-June ... this year who knows.Are you sure you put your boat in the water!?!?!?!?!?!?!
520576,Guest,2002-05-26 06:52:00,0,"Tadd and Shad Rap, maybe you's don't know what your talking about. Maybe you's need my guide services, I don't see either of you's posting any messages here. If you ever get a chance to get on Rainy, I suggest going to Grassy Poratge, walleyes were biting hard there last nite til about 8 pm. And one thing for sure THE WALLEYE ARE DONE SPAWNING."
520577,Guest,2002-05-26 07:17:00,0,Harvey .. talk with Darryl (MNR bio) and the boys at MNR in Fort Frances ... you may be surprised to learn that the walleye are still spawning as we speak ... and the smallies are at least a month or more away!
