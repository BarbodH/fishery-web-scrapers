520662,Guest,2002-05-25 20:33:00,0,"Anyone been fishing gullrock? Hows the fishing? Any ice left over? We are headed there for the 7th of June. P.S. anyone ever rent any cars from Kenora? I can fly into Kenora cheap but once I am there I would need to rent a car to get somewhere, anyone with any experience with this? Thanks"

520664,2746,2002-05-27 09:40:00,3206,JohnWe're going to Gullrock for the first time the last week in August. Will be staying at Five Lodges (Ithink that's the name). Been going to Canada for 20 years but never this lake. What can we expect?...any pointers would be appreciated.We just got back from Eagle Lake for the opening week. Late spring and cold but we did find some fish. Be glad your going in June...have a good trip!
520665,Guest,2002-05-27 13:00:00,0,I have friends that stay at Five Lakes. Expect excellent walleyes fishing. There are big northern in gull rock also. I find the lake easy to fish. I also fish Keg lake quite often.Eagle lake has been getting slammed here quite often. A friend of mine has a place on Eagle and she says the fishing has dropped off drastically.E-mail me if you want some more specific questions answered. [email protected]

I dont know what the fishing is like on Bruce/Packwash since we left but for you walleye guys Gullrock is great. We are leaving on the 7th, will be there for a week. I spoke with a regular on Gullrock last year and he said the Fall was great for BIG walleyes. As for the spring, we can fish off the dock at night and catch 20+ inch walleyes until we get sick of the mosquitos."
520672,SWeed,2002-05-30 22:31:00,66,"You should have great fishing. I was up for the opener (May 18) and things were tough. We stayed at Northern Shores on Two Island lake and couldn't get out on Gull Rock until Tuesday. We managed to catch our limit of eaters the second day after I convinced my fishin partners where to fish. The only place we marked fish was in 25 plus feet of water. and thats where we caught them,butthey were scattered and shy. Fishing was slow even on Gull Rock I did manage to catch an 8 Lb in about 7 foot of water, up by three sisters. Had freinds staying at Weavers, over by Keg Lake and before the ice went out they were catching a few fish, but only big ones no eaters... they had several over 20 inches biggest being 28. the friends at Weavers camp have been going to Gull Rock on the opener the last 8 years and this was the slowest fishing, due to the late ice... Hey thats fishin'Good luck and let me know how you all do...."

This is my fourth year and can't wait to get up there. Bud is very helpfull when it comes to putting you on fish.My suggesstion is 3/8 oz jigs chartrouse, white, or orange with a fuzzy tipped with a minnow can't beat it.Jeff"
520668,Jesse-WI,2002-06-03 22:22:00,534,WHere on Pakwash and Bruce did you fish? Our group is going to pike fish there this year
520669,Guest,2002-06-04 07:39:00,0,"Check out Bruce lake, thats where we always had the best luck. On the far southeast side of the lake theres a small island, anwhere between there and the adjacent shoreline was good."
