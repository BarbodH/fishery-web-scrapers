520780,Guest,2002-06-04 08:17:00,0,Up and back thru the SOO double axle trailer with 2 boats piled high with huge homemade coolers and the PU had a topper that was piled to the max with gear--no inspection either way they were checking every trunk on just about every car but just asked the usual questions--VERY FRIENDLY AND VERY EASY.len clare michigan
520781,luckyketch,2002-06-04 18:10:00,46,"Crossed both ways with two vehicles,m no problems quickest entry and exit in the last five years. They did ask for drivers license and ran them. Recommend having birth certificate when re-entering US. Two different groups I know were asked for birth certificates. They had them with them don't know what would have happened if they didn't."
520772,Guest,2002-06-05 04:40:00,0,Sioux Lookout? We are heading there on the 13th of June to get there in time for the opener at Rice/English. Let me know how it was. Staying on Abrams
520779,retire55,2002-06-05 07:55:00,1029,"Hi Keith:As a Canadian, I feel obligated to apologize for the lack of easily accessible information for US fishermen to enter Canada. I'm unaware whether the identical situation exists for Canadians trying to enter the US for fishing. I have researched the appropriate Canadian Government Department's web site (http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/index.html) and unfortunately, there is insufficient information there to answer the frequently asked questions by fishermen such as yourself. I telephoned them to request a simple easy to read one page addition be placed on their web page to explain the impacts of offences like DUI for US citizens entering Canada and what such folks could do to eradicate any uncertainties about their chances of being allowed entry into Canada. My request did not appear to win favour with the CIC representative.However, all is not lost. Apparently, if 5 years has passed since the DUI, a person can attempt to have their local authorities verify that the person involved has been rehabilitated. Any consulate office could probably provide details for you. Since your group is leaving Friday, that probably doesn't cut it for this trip. However, perhaps your group will be lucky and won't be asked for identification documents or they won't check the computer about same. In the unfortunate case where your colleague's DUI becomes evident, I believe the immigration officer can still opt to allow him entry into Canada but for a fee ($200 Canadian). I'm not sure whether this fee is refundable provided conditions are satisfied. Again, any consulate office can probably confirm this. Sounds like a money grab to me too!In closing, I would suugest that you and your colleagues complain to your Canadian outfitter about the consternation involved with not knowing whether one of your party will be refused entry to Canada or not. If enough US citizens complain, the appropriate government department will get the message - the message not being to open up the borders but rather to provide easily accessible information about entering Canada.Have a good fishing trip! Jay"
520782,Guest,2002-06-05 11:22:00,0,"Crossed the border last week at Fort Erie/Buffalo. We were asked a few more questions than before but they were very proffessional and polite on the Canadian side. Coming home we got the usual rude treatment from the U.S. side. We were not asked to show birth certificates but had to show I.D. on the way back. No one asked about DUI. We have always been treated worse coming back to the U.S. than when we cross into Canada. Seems like it is a real chore for the U.S. customs people to actually do their job. They are never polite or courteous. We always feel welcome on the Canadian side no matter what they ask they are always proffessional. We do have some rules for everybody riding in our vehicle when we cross the border. Everyone is awake and alert, no one is smoking, and no one is drinking anything from a can a travel mug or anything else. When they ask a question we are polite and answer quickly without stammering and saying uh, uh, uh. We cross the border 3-4 times a year and have been lucky about being searched but I think the little things make a difference."
520768,Guest,2002-05-31 09:55:00,0,A whole lot poorer also wise guy!!
520769,tracker,2002-05-31 11:20:00,91,the minnow- you don't give a reason why you might be declined entry? Just curious!!
520770,Karl,2002-05-31 18:11:00,63,It's beginning to bother me that there are so many potentially drunk drivers travelling the same roads I do.
520771,Guest,2002-05-31 20:40:00,0,"Amen to that!Karl,I'm leaving for Sioux Lookout on Sunday, Ill give you a full report."
520773,Guest,2002-06-01 21:39:00,0,lemme guess....you've NEVER done it...not even once !
520775,Big Tim,2002-06-03 04:43:00,63,"Up 5/25& back 5/31, fastest crossing to date. Never asked for id's, just the few questions about booze, smokes & guns, & on our way. both ways. All these horror stories are just to shake up guys that have serious dui's in the past few years. If more states got this tough on dui's--maybe the # of dui's will decrease in a few years. Drink all you want , just do it responsibly & leave thr car keys with someone else."
520776,Tommy,2002-06-03 12:07:00,4,"We crossed last week. No problems at customs, but one of our party got caught in a speed trap leaving Fort Frances. I'd bet others got caught, too."
520774,Guest,2002-06-03 13:02:00,0,Im sure your a saint karl !!!
520777,lobo1,2002-06-03 13:09:00,734,"The second vehicle in our party wasn't as fortunate as we were. When we crossed at the Soo we were travelling together and had lost the other guys for about 30 mins. We were travelling with our new Motorola radios. When we called them to see where they were - they were speaking with the border agent.The radio seemed to get the guys attention !! They were advised to take the first stall and got the ""Royal treatment"" !! Hahha. Everything BUT the anal probe !!It was only humorous because of how it happened and the fact that there was nothing illegal to be found.On the way home they breezed thru as we did.lobo"
520778,Keith,2002-06-04 07:34:00,48,Leaving Friday and we have a guy that had a DUI conviction in MN in 1984. All DUI convictions stay on your record in MN. Does anybody know a person that has not been allowed to cross the border or is this alot of scare?
520758,Guest,2002-05-28 05:12:00,0,"Headed to Canada in a week, thru International Falls--any border crossing reports to be told would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance."

520760,Fishoil,2002-05-28 08:07:00,1277,"I just got back from there, was up for the opener. Crossed at Int. Falls; I didn't notice any changes from other years outside of the new building. Most of the customs people our group dealt with were friendly, they even cracked a few smiles :-). Of 6 vehicles crossing only 1 had IDs looked at, and that was probably because the driver had them in his hand. I was a bit apprehensive about the crossing, but overall it was no problem at all."
520761,Guest,2002-05-28 08:10:00,0,"We crossed the Fort Francis border on the Friday before opener--had extra booze to declare and a Frenchmen (with a valid passprt). They made us go in (to pay for the tax on the booze) to have the French guy interviewed by immigration. We waited about 30 minutes before they got to us, then asked the rest of the party for our drivers licenses (to check for DUIs). We were out of there 5 minutes later.There was a group of 5 guys waiting when we got there that seemingly had multiple DUIs. They were still there when we left (and their truck was being torn apart tooth and nail). We had great fishing! Hit the pike at absolutely the best possible time. It was world class!!Enjoy your trip. Terry"
520762,Guest,2002-05-31 05:40:00,0,"Interesting story on the local chan. 4 wcco news last night. Seems as if the dui/crossing the border scenario has warranted a spot on the local news. They interviewed a lady from the Canadian consulate at which time she confirmed that more and more people are being checked at the border--and if you do have a prior dui regardless of when you will be told to head home. I wonder if the fact that this has made the news how it will effect crossings if any. They also said that Dayton (i think that was who they said) was going to get in touch with the consulate first thing in the morning. Anyone who has crossed recently and has any information on how things went--as far as if they checked id's--if so did they glance at it or take it in and run it. If they are spot checking or checking everyone (which seems as if it would be impossible) who is crossing. any information would be greatly appreciated. Group of 7 of us have a trip planned for june 8 thru the 15th and 3 of us unfortunately have dui's. So if the chances are that we will be turned back at the border we will probably book for somewhere else in MN, that way we are out only our deposit--sad but really wouldnt want to pay for open slots of other three."
520763,lobo1,2002-05-31 06:09:00,734,Just got back this morning. We crossed last week at the Soo and Wed night at Fort Francis. WE must have been due because these were the easiest most trouble free crossings to date.lobo
520764,phidelt157,2002-05-31 06:44:00,191,"It seems to me that everyone is up in arms about it and worried, but I've been talking to people and reading the posts and haven't found any horror stories yet.We leave in two weeks from today!!!!!!"
520765,Guest,2002-05-31 08:26:00,0,How are the resort owners taking this? This might put some of them out of buisness!
520766,Guest,2002-05-31 09:09:00,0,Not that any of you care.. But if i don't get through the border this year canada will never see me again! Don't get me wrong i love it up there but the heck with this!!
520767,Guest,2002-05-31 09:22:00,0,just stay home then ............if everyone with your attitude would do this Canada would be a whole lot better off
