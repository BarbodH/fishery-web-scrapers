However, if it is hot I really enjoy sleeping with a fan--it does not have to be a huge fan. Does anyone know of any good fans that can be battery opperated and if you do where they can be purchased? Thanks for all the help."

I bought one several years ago and have had good luck with it. The blade is only about 5-6 inches in diameter but it works fairly well for one person. I use it for sleeping in hot weather. The battery life seems to be quite long too. It is in the Master Catalog Spring 2002 edition II page 161 for $16.99. I think that it will do the trick for you.
