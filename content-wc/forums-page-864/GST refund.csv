532584,Guest,2003-06-20 05:24:00,0,"We experienced a long wait when we submitted by mail. Other than the 10 or 15 minute wait in line at the duty-free store, it's a pretty easy process. Just remember to write down your vehicle license number before you walk in. They ask for that along with other information."
532596,retire55,2003-06-20 09:31:00,1029,"Bill: To receive a cash refund when you are leaving Canada, you must show the duty-free shop staff the following documents and/or items: * original receipts for the eligible accommodation and/or goods purchased; * the goods that associated with these receipts; * proof that you are a non-resident (such as Photo ID.); * proof of export, if the goods are not in your possession. (such as a bill of lading); * proof that you are leaving the country (such as a charter bus ticket). The above information was copied from:http://www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca/tax/nonre...tml#P353_14665 I did ascertain that mailing in your request would require, on average, 6 weeks processing time. As well, the Customs and Revenue agent I spoke with indicated that the approximate time to get a cash refund at a participating duty free shop would be about 10 minutes assuming there was no line up."
532598,Thumper,2003-06-20 10:33:00,133,"We didn't have to do the rebate this year, because out camp owner only charged us the 3%. They can do that when you prepay 20% of your lodging expense (deposit) more then (I think) 60-days in advance. It was nice not having to stop at the duty free shop this year! In past years, we've crossed at Ft. Frances. Just a block from the border there's a duty free store. You bring in your lodge receipt there, the pretty girl at the counter helps you fill out the form. There, she gives you a voucher that you bring up to another counter. That one gives you money (in Canadian funds). From there you go outside and to another door in the same building. That spot always seemed a little shady to me, but that's just my opinion. There, they'll exchange all your Canadian $$ for U.S. $$. 10-20 minutes depending on how many people are there. The duty free store sells cigs, booze & beer, and souveniers. My personal opinion is that they're all over priced there."
532600,Ia Walihntr,2003-06-20 10:46:00,320,"This year was different for our group. We were told by the lodge owner that we would get more money back than usual because of some tax break thing that Ontario was doing this year. When we stopped at the duty free store in Rainey River, as we usually do, we were told that this year we--HAD--to mail in for the rebate. Maybe someone out there know why. Please post. Thanks"
532605,Guest,2003-06-20 11:19:00,0,"My fishing camp owner always fills out the form for us. They told us to mail it in because sometimes they will refund MORE of your money than the places at the border. I am not sure why that is the case, but I have indeed seen that happen. Yes, mail time is about 6 weeks but all we do is address the envelope and send it in (after signing the form of course). And, we do not have to stop at the border. For me, that is a plus. But, that is just me."
532611,retire55,2003-06-20 14:03:00,1029,"Ia Walihntr: I believe the reason is that the Ontario Legislature passed legislation to exempt from Retail Sales Tax (RST) all transient accommodation and prices of admission to places of amusement throughout the Province of Ontario provided after April 30, 2003 and before October 1, 2003. See http://www.trd.fin.gov.on.ca/userfil...3_26590_1.html Customs and Revenue Canada (a federal jurisdiction) does not have authority to collect and/or refund the Ontario RST. Consequently, one is required to apply to the Ontario Government for the RST refund via mail."
532617,Ia Walihntr,2003-06-20 15:32:00,320,"Thanks for the update Retire55. Someone else from the group went into the duty free store. The only thing I knew for sure was that it had to be sent in this year and that we couldn't use it for gas home as we have in the past, but we could use it for the trip up next year."
532631,ackermannsacre,2003-06-20 21:35:00,196,"Thanks guys, I suppose we will stop at the border to look at the pretty girl behind the counter if nothing else. If the line looks too long or they say to mail it, well I guess I'll mail it. Bill"
