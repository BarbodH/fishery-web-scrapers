I think we will take the traditional jigs and twisters for the wallies and am not certain what we will take for the muskies. If anyone has any experience with this lodge, I would appreciate your comments. Thanks"

I know they are successful on big black bucktail spinners, hog wobblers, and big fire tiger Rapalas. The forage base is perch and walleyes. As a suggestion, you might post on the musky side of this site and ask the same question."
