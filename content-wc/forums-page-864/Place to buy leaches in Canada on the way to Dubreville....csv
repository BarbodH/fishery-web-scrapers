532536,Guest,2003-06-18 20:26:00,0,As you go by Wawa pull in and go into Youngs General Store which is about 1km off #17 as you head into Wawa and they will have all manner of bait. If you are going to Loch Island let me know as I have spent the last 7 years fishing the lake. Steve442.

Probably not all bait shops are registered but when I did the search for Sault Ste Marie and for Wawa, there were two baitshops listed for each city/town. Telephone numbers are provided for you to contact them to ensure you can get what you want. Might be worth a try. http://www.baitnet.com/search.php?ac...ops+in+Ontario"
532559,Guest,2003-06-19 12:59:00,0,Went to same lake in early June. Stopped in Wawa and bought minnows. Don't bother with Young's high priced tourist trap. Went to 3 places found Wawa Bait and Tackle on a side street downtown attached to the side of a hardware store. It was on the right as you are going downtown just past a small grocery store. Lady there treated us real nice and was far cheaper than Young's. Also we got more than we paid for.

It looks pretty good from the air (observed while flying to more northern lakes). I thought it would be a decent drive-to if the fishing was decent. Thanks. Tim"
532613,Steve442,2003-06-20 14:37:00,1,"Tim, this is a very difficult lake to fish unless you know it well. The first few times we went we were hard pressed to catch any but in subsequent years we have done very well. I have always stayed on Otter Island because it is quiet. I found that Pike were plentiful during the day if you trolled the west shore behind Otter Island up to Patterson Point. Walleye were hot in the early evening just east of the Lodge in the bay where there are a couple of small islands especially when the wind was blowing into the bay. We just drift into the bay by the islands using a jig and grub combo and would catch a limit on a good evening. I have found that if you can troll into the bays where the bottom comes up from the main basin into about 9ft. they would come up to feed as the sun was just over the trees. This a very pretty lake with lots of bays and points but like I say it can be tempermental like any lake can. I am a registered user so if you want to e-mail me please do."
