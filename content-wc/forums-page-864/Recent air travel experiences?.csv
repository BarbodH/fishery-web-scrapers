Looking for people who just came back from a Canadian fishing trip. Is it true? What's the deal? What airline did you fly? As anyone who flys into Canada for trips knows, its tough to change much and you're pretty maxxed out on baggage. Will I have problems with a large duffel, tacklebox, bazooka rod case, and a small carry-on? This is what always bring and am hope, hope, hoping there's not a problem! TIA."

They also allow another check bag limited to 50 pounds, otherwise you will be charged a surcharge. They allow a carry on bag limited to 40 pounds. Check with your airline to know exactly what size, weight and dimensions are allowed. We leave tomorrow for Rainy Lake (The Fisheries). Can't wait! Pathfinder"

Get the name of the employee you talk to in their customer service, make a note of what they tell you, and if there are any problems at check-in time haul out the note and say ""This is what you folks told me were the rules."" FYI"

On way back they counted as two because check-in lady said it only applied to ""small"" tackle box (but couldn't tell us exactly how big was ""too big""). However, she did let us duct tape all of our party's rod tubes together and counted it as one item (I know it doesn't make sense, but didn't question it). Also note that maximum weight of each checked item decreased to 50 lbs this year (instead of 70 lbs. like in the past)."
