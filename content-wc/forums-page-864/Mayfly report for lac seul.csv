I know that northern Wisconsin had some huge black flys released by the DNR to kill the gypsy moths, and they were #### annoying on the lake..... Thanks again everyone! PS, 5 days and counting til we leave....tick, tick, tick..."
532663,Guest,2003-06-22 20:48:00,0,Was up 6/8>6/21 and the mayflies were just starting to really kick in. My guess is this week they will be in full force on the Ear Falls end of the lake. Started to slow the bite down on Friday 6/21.
532686,Thumper,2003-06-23 08:42:00,133,"I didn't know that those big 'ol flies were released by the DNR. Last year on Minnesota's North Shore there were bazillions of flies. They didn't bite but were simply annoying. I was told that the hughe infestation occurred according to the cycle of the Army moth, whose catepillars were all over the area also. Mayflies are a kinda of neat bug. Bazillions of different species and the ones in Ontario different than this site's species, but this site will give you some basic background:http://www.bcadventure.com/adventure...y/mayfly.phtml - Rick"
532693,Guest,2003-06-23 10:24:00,0,How was the fishing. Am going there the 28th.
532714,Guest,2003-06-23 12:37:00,0,"Well, you know how the rumor mill can get things stirred up. I was told that the DNR released a batch of those flies to counter-act the gypsy moths that were destroying every tree in site.....now, whether that is the truth, thats another story. But what I do know, is they are dang annoying when on the water, and I want to be better prepared for them this year. One good thing is, they can be used as bait when the crawlers are gone. ha ha"
