In ten years of fishing LS, have never seen better fishing. Hundreads of large ""over-slot"" fish caught and released. In five days of fishing, it never let up. Yes, the water is extermely low. Didn't even try to get into Broad Lake, stayed on the big lake all week. About the ""Blue Walleye"". We did catch a Blue Walleye while fishing in the Poplar Narrows area. I'm not kidding, I've read alot about the thought-to-be-extinct Blue Walleye. This was real. We released it unharmed to hopefully reproduce. I'm heading back up to LS June 28th. Hope the fishing is still HOT."

532307,Guest,2003-06-13 13:34:00,0,I caught a 6 1/2 lb blue walleye last August off a rock pile by COX island. I didn't get a chance in May to see if it was still around. Maybe I will go look for it again this August.
