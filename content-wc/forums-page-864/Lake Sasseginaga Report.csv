532509,Guest,2003-06-18 14:03:00,0,"Just got back Sunday from our trip to Lake Sasseginaga, Quebec -w- a group of 8 diehard walleye fisherman. The Outfitters (Wally and Vickie Mullins) were great folks. Wally could host his own TV show, or at the very least have a guest appearance on the Red Green Show....he's fit right in the Possom Lodge. We stayed at one of the outpost camps 1/2 mile up the lake. Great setting, a very typical fishing camp, everything in good working order. The boats were comfortable 14' ,3 seaters with brand new 10 horse Johnson motors. No seats -w- backs though...... bring em, we did and it'll save a lot of wear on your back. The fishing was slow, we figure due to all the weather we experienced during the week. Lots of east winds, rained every day at least once, other than the easterlys, weather systems from all points on the compass....we sure had variety! We jigged with worms and preserved minnows, all types of colors and shapes for the jigs, both anchored and drifting with the wind. We trolled every crankbait we had, from Reef Runners to Rapala Shad Raps and more. We trolled worm harnesses in all types of colors and blade patterns, white seemed to work best. We fished with slip bobbers and worms, also with preserved minnows, also with a few leeches that some of the walleye we caught puked out on the cleaning table.......we fished points, bays, structure, shallow, deep. We had 2 fishin buddy fishfinders that marked lots of fish. No one method stood out over the others, fish were caught with all presentations....nothing was ""HOT"". Bottom line, 8 guys fishing from 4:30 am till 9 or 10am every day, some day trips, every night from 6 till 10.....40 walleye, 12 ...mostly in the 2-4# range, 18"" to 23"", and 12 northerns, biggest one 36"" (all nords put back). Enough for 2 fish fry meals. Oh yes, what was biting were the BUGS....a fine mix of blackflies and skeeters by the millions! We had a ball and would recommend this place to anybody who's interested....you've just gotta realize that on a given week, the fish can be off their feed....too bad it happened to be our week. Be glad to provide further info if anybody is interested."

Although I have never fished Sasseginaga, I fished just next door at Ogascanan - a Mullens family runs that one too. Did you have any difficulty fishing on days when the weather was inclement (e.g did you find places to get out of the wind and waves)? 10 HP motors would not be sufficient safe power on Ogascanan. Your report didn't mention anything about lake trout. Are there no lake trout there or was it that you just didn't fish for them?"
532677,Guest,2003-06-23 07:31:00,0,"Retiree 55: We had no problems getting around the lake with the motors provided...there were days when the whitecaps were rolling but we just took our time and had no problems in that regard. It's a fantastic lake with plenty of islands, back bays, structure, the options are endless to find a spot to fish. Lake trout? We had every intention of giving them a shot, after we got tired of catching walleye....GRIN....as you can see from the above account, we put alot of effort into our #1 species. Had we done a little better on the walleye we would have spent some more time on the lakers....in hindsight maybe we should have given the lakers a whirl. There are times when you'd be better off not seeing all the marked fish on a fishing buddy, when they're just not feeding....we kept thinking that the walleye just had to turn on sooner or later....I wonder how the folks that came in after us fared, the eyes should have been ready!"
