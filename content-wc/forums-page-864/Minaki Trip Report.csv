532581,brian1785,2003-06-20 00:55:00,1534,"Rob, Just wanted to let you know we stopped at a bait shop on the way home in Kenora and they had all kinds of Pearl Shad Raps so we bought as many as we could afford. How about that company address we talked about? You can send it to my pm ([email protected]) Thanks! Brian"
532595,Guest,2003-06-20 09:30:00,0,"Hey, good to hear you got some. I'll send you that info when I actually get home. I'm heading back to Winnipeg this upcoming monday. We did manage to get some this past wednesday & the first guy in bought all of them. SO, we now await getting more. Fishing has taken off here now, with lots of reports of BIG fish. I was out guiding this past Sunday / Monday with the Moody family from Pittsburgh, Kansas. VERY nice people & good anglers. 1 guest hooked into a sturgeon, just off of the big sand beach. Played with it for about a hour, then it broke off. He was using 6lb. test / jig / minnow. We did very well for walleye, caught a couple of Muskies - biggest being around the 40 inch mark. We had a smallmouth ""tourney"" (3 boats) it was a blast ! My *boat* caught around 40 smallies and we actually WON this deal (by 1/2 inch)It was a 2 fish limit, total length. I didn't boat a fish, but my partner Tom just hammered them. I just controlled the boat and he did the rest ! AGAIN, my partner carries my butt........... ;-}. All in all, we had a fantastic time. The thing I enjoy most about guiding is the fact that I'm making life long friends....... and one can never have too many friends ! Good Fishen Rob"

532355,Reels,2003-06-15 14:41:00,2876,"Hey Guys, Just got back last night. Fishing was good. Walleyes are stacking up at the Clay banks and Deadmans Bay. Also Sugarloaf and Hatrack produced some nice consistant walleye fishing. Not too much on the reefs yet. We hard a hard time finding fish under 18"" for shore lunches. Lots of fish over 24"". Fish are still very shallow with most being caught between 8'-12' Big leeches or big minnows with light jigs seemed to work the best. Smallmouth fishing was great. find rocks along a shore the size of softballs and basketballs, and smallmouth would be in feeding on baitfish. Hot baits were #11 Rapalla's like Don C. stated, (thanks) Husky Jerks with Blue and Silver being the hot color by far. Also like Don said, Tube jigs were hot. Lots of bite offs but lots of smallmouth too. One guy in our group was using this stinky bait called Chompers. Garlic and salt. I tell you, I almost kicked him off the boat they smelled so bad, but with the fish he was pulling out with them, we all ended up using the stinky baits... Big Northern and Muskie were active on rock reefs adjacent to deep water with the wind blowing into them. Black Bucktail and an Green/Brown/yellow Inhaler worked best for me. Water is warm, between 67 and 69 degrees. Locals say due to lack of wind with warm temps. We did stop in at the Dockside for Dinner one night at the Minaki Lodge. Food was great. Sandwiches from $6-$8 with fries and they are pretty good portions with great taste. But then again, after a few days of my cooking in a cabin, it is not hard to impress anyones taste buds. Dockside has a Martini and Wine menu too. Kinda nice to sit on the Dock, smoke a stogie, and have a Martini. We asked for you Rob, but you were gone both times we stopped in. We'll have to wait till September to meet up. Tight lines to all going north! Reels <{{}}><"
532357,Guest,2003-06-15 17:34:00,0,"Reels, Thanks for the report. It sounds like a great trip. What was the largest walleye you all caught? I used 14 lb. stren flourocarbon leaders of 10 to 14 inches to decrease the bite offs by about 80 to 90% on the tubes. We will be back in September. Perhaps we will run in to each other. I don't know the times yet. I am going to try and pattern smallmouth then, which is something new. Not sure if I can pull it off. Great trip, DonC"
532378,Guest,2003-06-16 09:31:00,0,I was just wondering has was the Minaki get together? How many people showed? Also did Brian from BAYVIEW cook his great walleye shorelunch?
532381,Reels,2003-06-16 10:11:00,2876,"Biggest walleye we caught was 26"". Saw a few 28's around. Didn't hear of or see any 30's. Lots of 24's and 22's. Seams like two strong year class's of fish. I wanted to try to get some flourocarbon line before we left based on your earlier recomendation, but never made it to the store. Never fished it before, but I will get some and play with it. You were right about the bigger fish being in Big Sand, although we did get some nice fish out of Pistol. Didnt have a get together. Kinda petered out. Got to busy before leaving to organise anything. Met some good people up there though. <{{}}><"
532397,Guest,2003-06-16 17:45:00,0,"Reels, Thanks for the great report. Did you try Trappers in Big Sand? Sorry to hear the gathering didn't happen, would have been great!"
532459,Reels,2003-06-17 16:14:00,2876,"Hey Woods, sorry we missed you this year. We did try Trappers, and the rock pile, but it was a slow bite and didnt mark a lot of fish. There was another spot though were there is a cut in just east of the rock pile and fish were stacking in there with a south wind dragging spinners with the drift past the island. Depth 12-20'. I think there is a waterfall in the area, but not positive. <{{}}><"
532497,Guest,2003-06-18 10:08:00,0,"Thanks, will check it out and let you know. Woods"
532519,Le pickerel,2003-06-18 16:50:00,18,"Reels, Where on Pistol did you have success for Walleye? We caught a few nice ones in the narrows but other than that we didn't find much. My friend caught a twenty eight and a quarter at the clay flats. This was his first time out this year and was also his first fish, just about threw him out of the boat. Le pic"
532525,Guest,2003-06-18 18:51:00,0,")Ok,I'm heading up on Friday.Where are the clay banks,Deadmans bay,and Sugarloaf?"
532533,iamwalleye1,2003-06-18 19:48:00,1589,All the spots are up in little sand and some in big sand! The clay banks are around Burnt island. You can ask anyone when you arrive they could point you in the right direction!
