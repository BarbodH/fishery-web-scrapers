It is an excellent tournament and pays $50,000 (Can) first place money. If you are going to enter, you'd best hurry as it always fills. You can get info by phoning the Kingfisher Inn @ 306-862-9801. Great fishing that time of year. This year they are paying $1000 each day for the ""big fish"" caught during pre fishing the week prior to the tournament."
