532527,Guest,2003-06-18 18:59:00,0,Just thought of something that might be of interest to people on LOTW that use the map. We always carry the published map of the lake just in case. we found out that they are changing the buoy numbering system on LOTW- I dont know about the other lakes- so if you get out there and the numbers dont agree with your map thats the reason. some of the numbers match the map and some dont. Maybe this is their way of making people buy new maps. ours is 3 years old and well marked anyway. i suppose its to make the buoys more user friendly. alan;)
532534,downriverbob,2003-06-18 20:05:00,880,"Actually they renumbered the maps because they renumbered the buoys, this is because they pulled several buoys from the lake a couple of years ago. They do crazy things to save money in Canada like they do in the good old USA !!!!!!!!!!!"
532535,Guest,2003-06-18 20:15:00,0,####o. Its crosses my mind when i am zipping around the lakes up there and looking at the maps. they show the depth and rocks and that kind of thing. How do they know they have all the shallow rocks and reefs and things like that marked and maybe they did not miss a couple that I am about to run over and wreck my engine? How do they make sure nothing is missed? It would sure give me piece of mind. like on lac saul. we run around for years and then the water is 3 feet low and HOLY COW where did all those rocks come from? Here all this time we were just skimming over these rocks all these years without knowing how close to disaster we were coming. thanks a lot. alan

532627,Guest,2003-06-20 21:03:00,0,"####o guys, This post went around back in February and as a LOTW visitor I forwarded it to all people that I normally go with. I believe everyone should buy new maps if your going to depend on them for Marker Buoy input. The old thread is ""Buoys on LOTW"", search for it, there are a LOT of changes, the following link will give you some specifics. http://www.can-usa.com/escape/nav-changes.htm Scott"
532671,Guest,2003-06-22 23:42:00,0,I remember in yellow girl bay just past adams river there used to a buoy on those rocks of course this year with the low water the rocks are exposed but the buoy is not there. how about next year when the water is up will the buoy be back?
