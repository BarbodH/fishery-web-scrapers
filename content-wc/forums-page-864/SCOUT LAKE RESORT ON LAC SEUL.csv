As we drove into the lodge (Fishermans Cove) all my cousin kept saying (regarding the low water level) was 'Oh my god, Oh my god, Oh my god'. The docks were about 50' from where the water level normally is. From the area to the south of the lodge the shore was about 150' from normal!!! Rocks were above the water that normally these guys would just go over. One of our guys that has been there many many years grounded his brand new Lund. No damage though, luckily it was just clay bottom."
