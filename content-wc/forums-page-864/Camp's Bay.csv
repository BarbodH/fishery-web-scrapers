I have been on vacation....my every other year trip with a gang of guys up to northern Quebec after the elusive walleye. A great trip! I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay at Camps Bay. Can't wait till August to get back up there and see all of our vacation friends and the Finch's. Maybe we will see you sometime....I'm always happy to pass along info and recommendations on the places I've been to. Good luck fishing ! Post a report.
