Crossing into Canada was up in April over last year, and then in May a 6% increase over the previous year. A 1-2% increase would be expected on a normal year. The Pigeon River crossing at Thunder Bay has similarly increased as reported in the Fort Francis newspaper. I guess all those boycotters that visted this board over the winter have taken a toll? EH? :) :) :)"
