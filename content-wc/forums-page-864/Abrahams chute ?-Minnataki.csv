532565,TomPGrouse,2003-06-19 14:55:00,124,I have to go through Abrahams Chute next week. Has anyone been through it recently? How was it with the low water? What is the best way to get through? Thanks

There are a red and a green buoy marker, just rip through that and you should be ok. Slow down and idle through other gaps in the rocks, like if you are going to donut or alcona"

The new green marker makes them a bit more safer as you have to swing wide going down an can see down to be assured the way down is clear. Good fishing, Jackfish from Sioux Lodge on Abram Lake"
