It was a pretty good trip, all the reports here helped a lot. We didn't get into any of the big fish. 23-1/2 inch was our biggest. We did get however get into lots of fish. Our best day was our last Friday the 20th. My partner caught 18 fish I had 11 in 5 hours. I was having a hard time controlling the boat and fishing at the same time as there was a huge wind that day. Big Sand was hot all week. lots of fish over 18 but we only had 2 people so shore lunch wasn't an issue. I see some people were at deadmans. I tried there with not much luck. We mostly concentrated on Big Sand and that spot just west of sand beach, don't remember the name. Lots of boats and lots of fish being caught. It was one of the beat trips I have had in a few years. Can't wait for next. Good fishing to all."

532712,BillyBigFish,2003-06-23 12:16:00,31,Sand Beach is the most northeastern shore of Big Sand. We only fished the beach area one day and then went to an area just west of there where the transition of rocks start. Almost due west from the beach. We used leeches only and had great success. With so many boats in this area you need good boat control. I suggest using your GPS if you have one vs the more traditional method of floating markers. When ever a marker was thrown over everyone went for it. It is much nicer to just make a mark and use your electronics. I used a marker Friday the best day but becasue of the wind not many boats were there. Hope the weather holds and you have good fishing.
