507620,RMB,2000-04-16 13:43:00,251,I am trying to set up a trip with a client around the weekend of July 8th this year and am looking for BIG lake trout and BIG walleyes both. Big pike are not really a priority as it has been my experience that they are almost always available in these caliber of lakes. It will need to be a total flyin from Minneapolis and we would like the full meal deal with guides as well. I realize this is rather short notice to book a trip of that caliber and I need all the help I can get right now.
507621,Guest,2000-04-16 17:28:00,0,"RMB, this place doesn't have Lake Trout, but they DO have BIG Walleye & Pike. I haven't been there, but it sounds great!!! It's called The Guardian Eagle and they'll fly you from Minneapolis in there own Turbo Prop King Air 200, leave Mpls. @ 6:00 AM and be fishing by 9:00 AM everything's included, but now the part you've been waiting for, the price, 4 days, 3 nights (3 full days fishing) $1,695 per person. 5 days, 4 nights (4 full days fishing) $1,895 per person 1-800-465-3844"

507627,duffy,2000-05-02 10:25:00,49,I have a place for you. Way north camp is located 150 air miles north of red lake ontario. You can fly from minneapolis directly into red lake on northwest. The trout fishing is unbelieveable and the walleye fishing is second to none. Pike fishing is something to be seen. There are 5 lakes to fish from camp. You can get guides and meals as well. It is fly-in only. All lakes are catch and release except for shore lunch which the guides cook. The staff each mornining gets you to the lake you are going to fish. boats and motors are waiting. I am friends with owner and could probobally get you booking for any time this year. e-mail me if you are interested. sdyer@rittal-corp#####. Good luck.
