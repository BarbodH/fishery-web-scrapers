There are five lakes to fish and it's all catch and release execept for shore lunch. Last year our group of four caught 27 northerns over 15lbs. The largest was 27 lbs. We also caught all of the walleye we wanted up to 12lbs. I have been there four times and the fishing and service get's better every year. E-mail me if you want more info. sdyer@rittal-corp#####"
