Although after thinking about it, how would whacking a large walleye between the eyes with a heavy stick to comply with the MNR regulation that ""no live fish other than baitfish may be held in possession"" on the lake system I fish. Bill C-17 - Legislative Analysis: Bill C-17 was introduced in Parliament on December 01, 1999 and is an omnibus bill that amends the Criminal Code of Canada. It includes sections that are of interest to Canadian firearms owners and hunters. These sections are some technical amendments to the Firearms Act and the introduction of new laws regarding cruelty to animals. Specific changes will make it illegal to brutally or viciously kill animals."

Unfortunately, the wording is so vague and so much interpretation is left to the courts, the siple act of placing a worm on a hook could land you in jail. It has some major implications for anglers, hunters, ranchers and just about anyone else that has contact with animals. Check out the COHAsite: www.coha.netT.J."
