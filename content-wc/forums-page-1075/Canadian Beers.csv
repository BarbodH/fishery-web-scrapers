507546,Guest,2000-04-26 07:39:00,0,It's hard to beat a Molson ale after a day on the water.
507547,Guest,2000-04-26 12:59:00,0,"I would suggest that you give Sleemans Honey Brown a try, it's a fine brew. Another option is to go for Waterloo Dark, a dark but very light tasting brew, I love it. In the heat of the summer I also enjoy many of the ""wheat"" beers, Big Rock Grasshopper is a good bet, enjoyed with a lemon wedge inserted into the bottle, just as you would with a Corona. If you have trouble getting these brands at the local ""Beer Store"" where you are fishing I would go with Molson Canadian, and or Kokanee. And finally if you are hard up for cash, or just looking to economize go with Steeler or Carling Ice, thought they never find a home in my cooler, a friend(tight wad) of mine enjoy's them regularly.Hodge"
507548,JackSalmon,2000-05-01 20:53:00,169,"No doubt about it --- Wildcat Strong, or as they say up there ""Forte""."
507549,Guest,2000-05-02 10:19:00,0,Amazing the number of replies. The boys really like their beer it seems. Good fishing; Frank
507535,Guest,2000-04-06 12:36:00,0,"You guys are all drinking the national swill brands. If you come up through southern Ontario try some tasty beer like Creemore, Muskoka Cream Ale, Upper Canada Lager, or Sleeman's."
507536,Guest,2000-04-06 16:28:00,0,"As close to heaven as it gets...An ice-cold, frosty bottle or ten of Sleeman's Honey Brown Lager along with a shorelunch of fried walleye chunks, spuds 'n onions, and homebaked beans.Ohhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!And, by the way, you know that old saying about the best beers being made only with barley, hops, malt, and spring water? Well...American and Canadian national swill brands - and they are - substitute up to 60% of the barley with...RICE!If I want brown sake, I'll ask for brown sake. When I want a barley sandwich, I mean a BARLEY sandwich!"
507537,River_eye,2000-04-06 16:42:00,1486,"It's not that we only drink these brands. It's because the american guy asked for some brands, and we were giving him the only brands that are available everywhere. I still love my micro-brewry beers, such as Fort Gary Pale, and Dark ales, but they are only available in Winnipeg, so it's not practical to mention them.[font size=""4"" color=""green"" font face=""signature""]River eye[/font]"
507538,mkebenn,2000-04-07 05:05:00,59,"I live in western NY, 20 miles from the border and I've been ""swilling"" Molson Canadian on both sides of the border for 30 yrs. I have just been introduced to Sleeman's honey brown though, and that is a fine brew. does anybody remember Carlsberg Gold? I believe it was classified as a malt liquer but it was the best I ever had, from anywhere. Did they get bought out or refranchised or what? Don't think much of the beer that bears their name now...curious Mike in EA"
507539,chris,2000-04-15 20:26:00,23,MMMM - BEER
507540,Marc,2000-04-18 20:04:00,12,"The best beer is cold beer, free beer, or the last beer in the cooler! But seriously, as a Canuck who hates hangovers, I like Blue Light or Canadian. The micro breweries make great beer, but not the all day, all week drinking kind."
507541,TerryMac,2000-04-19 16:29:00,190,"Try these: Pilsner (that is the brand as well as the type)Bohand, my fav....Molson, Canmadian"
507542,Chris K,2000-04-22 20:16:00,278,"[font size=""1"" color=""#FF0000""]LAST EDITED ON Apr-22-00 AT 10:18PM (CST)[/font][p]I would have to say in my opinion that Molson Canadian and Kokanee are my favourites. Kokanee Gold is good too. Tell your friends it is not a beer belly, it's Molson muscle! Chris*** I almost forgot about Bigrock Brewery! They have some really good stuff!"
507543,Guest,2000-04-25 11:30:00,0,I'm from Saskatchewan but I love Ice Cold Kokanee Beer Brewed fresh in the Kootenay Mountains of B.C. A dozed of these tasty bad boys taste great and turn that 5 pound walleye into a 10!!!!
507544,Guest,2000-04-25 19:36:00,0,"You're from Saskatchewan and you don't drink Pilsner? Hmmm.... must not be born and raised! <GRIN> Just kidding... although I have to admit that an ice cold Pil, and I mean ICE COLD can't be beat... and a dozen of them turn that 5 lb 'Eye into a 15 LB'er!"
507525,Spence,2000-04-03 13:30:00,19,"It's almost time for me to put in my official beer order for our first of 3 Ontario fishing trips booked for this year.I've mostly drank Blue on previous trips & enjoy that, but are we missing out on something better??What's your favorite beer after a long day on the water?"
507526,Guest,2000-04-03 15:49:00,0,"Doing the Canadian beer eh, In my expert opinion Molson Export has been my favorite for 29 years of fishing the great far north. Blue is pretty good but the Molson is much better after putting a few ( and this year a few less Walleyes)in the boat. With the daily limit of 2 and poss. of 4 that leaves more time to have a cold one eh. Good Fishing"
507527,Guest,2000-04-03 16:11:00,0,"At last, a subject upon which I can speak with utter authority...For breakfast, we usually start off with Blue. On the hottest days, nothing cuts the dust like Labatt's 50 Ale. Molson Canadian Beer works just fine as an after-dinner refreshment and don't overlook Old Vienna as a late night snack. As an American, you most likely drink your beer ice cold. Good Canadian beer tastes best cool, not ice cold. (About 10 degrees cooler than the American lagers.) By the way, Canadian beer really tastes best after you've just finished cleaning a mess of walleye. The aroma of fresh fish really accents the bouquet!"
507528,River_eye,2000-04-03 16:35:00,1486,"There are many excellent beers up here. My personal preferance is Labatt Genuine Draft. Some of the most popular beers at the fishing camp that I work at are: Budweiser (Canadian brewed), Molson Canadian, Kokanee (excellent choice), and Blue. Some guys like Molson Dry, but I'm not crazy about it.The beers that I would totally reccomend are Kokanee, or Moosehead.[font size=""4"" color=""green"" font face=""signature""]River eye[/font]"
507529,Guest,2000-04-03 17:37:00,0,"A few years back at a fish camp in Quebec, 8 of us bought different kinds of beer. We pooled all the bottles together in the coolers. Anyone could drink whatever brand they wanted. By the end of the week the Labatt 50 Ale was everyones favorite. It goes down so smooth & tastey. I can hardly wait till june!"
507530,chrism,2000-04-03 22:43:00,429,"Actually, I prefer the Beers from south of the 49th!!! They taste ""lighter"" (they have almost the same etoh%)and I like'em served as cold as they can get!But if I do have to drink a local brew, all the above mentioned are good, and Kokanee is my fave."
507531,Guest,2000-04-04 08:48:00,0,After 1 or 2 they all taste the same.But give Blue light a try.Like the name says a light beer that you can drink all day & not have a hangover in the morning.
507532,TJ,2000-04-04 16:18:00,316,"kokanee Gold! Remember Canuck beer is stronger, so expect a headache."
507533,Guest,2000-04-04 18:48:00,0,"All I know is that Im drowning my sorrows in cheap american brew right now b/c I'm not the guy making THREE trips to the best place in the world, Ontario, for a chance at some great eyes and gorgeous scenery and .....oh yeah....the beer.Any beer(w/ the exception of Old Dutch)tastes great after a day on the water and some eyes in the boat....long live Canada, Eh!"
507534,Guest,2000-04-05 11:12:00,0,"The best beer is one that somebody else paid for!Serously, I'm partial to Moosehead as long as it's fresh. Those &$@$*!! green bottles make beer go bad too fast. Nothin's better than a cold Moosehead, a good cuban cigar and the pleasing mixture of deet and fish slime wafting gently from your clothes as you listen to the loons on the lake you just fished.Now if the Canadians only brewed their own Leinenkugel...!"
