507687,Jackfrost,2000-04-23 05:16:00,1,Would someone tell me if fishing season opens May 13 or May 20 in Ontarion? We're trying to plan..Thanks
507688,Guest,2000-04-23 10:17:00,0,"Walleye season opens May 20th. Pike and Trout are open now. I am headed north now back to my lodge in NW Ontario, South Bay Lodge on Confederation lake 42 miles NE of Ear Falls. We are a remote boat-in lodge on 14,000 acre lake all by ourselves, If you are looking for a place that is remote with great fishing take a look at our web site ""southbaylodge.com"" We are leaving today and email/internet access is not available from camp so to reach us call 807-222-3268 after Arpil 28th. Have a great summer. roger"

507690,Guest,2000-04-23 15:51:00,0,river eye- it seems to me that jack frost asked a simple question that roger answered.so what if he put in a plug for his place. cut him some slack. happy easter. art
507692,walleyed,2000-04-23 18:39:00,11,walleye season opens May 13th here in southern Ontario
507691,Guest,2000-04-26 16:04:00,0,"Let's just say I wish I had a dollar for every time Roger responded to an inquiry on this board with the promo for his lodge. I mean put it on the products page. Just like with everything else in this world, take something free that's got value and somebody will try to turn a buck off of it."
507693,Guest,2000-05-02 10:56:00,0,"Check out "" Walleye opener in Ontario""listing. Theres a whole lot of regs in some lakes. Do your homework on the area you are going to fish. If you are new to an area stay at a resort. Good fishing: Frank"
507694,Guest,2000-05-02 13:03:00,0,"Unlike roger from south bay I don't own a camp but if you are planning a trip to northwest ontario for trophy pike, walleye, and lakers I can get some info about a place north of red lake. It is a fly-in and fishing is catch and release only. I've been 4 times and we always catch northerns over 20 and walleye over 6lbs. Let me know if I can help. Good luck.Mickey"
