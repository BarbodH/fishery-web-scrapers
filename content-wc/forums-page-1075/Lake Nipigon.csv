507754,Guest,2000-04-30 20:53:00,0,"Didn't have time to respond the other day.What size boat do you run?Weather always unpredictable,so bring some cards.There are campsites avail.at poplar point or the Crestwind Hotel(807)875-2132 has rooms,kitchenette,etc...The Hook Shop(807)875-2527 has baits,books charters etc.Generally,bigger is better for baits.The Proviser is most often on the radio but others work.This lake can blow up big time so be careful.Maps avail.@ Hook Shop but show only hazards only,uncharted water.Good fishing usually close to poplar point,high hill harbour anyway.The municipal office can provide details on the campsites(807)875-2639.Pinch your barbs!"
507755,Guest,2000-05-01 15:35:00,0,"Thanks for the response . Have a 18 ft. boat w/ downriggers of course .There is fair fishing that close in ? Do you have to run out to Shakespear Island or the willows for better fishing or no ?? I have some provisors and canoes . How bout the walleyes or northerns near the campground . Last year I tried to E-mail fishinitis but had no luck , if I remember right he had web site too.Do you live in the Nipigon area ?You recommended fishinitis , how about Miss Piggy or others ??Do you have any tips or tricks that would be helpful ? Fish Lake Superior quite a bit with this boat , real seaworthy . Thank you"
507756,Guest,2000-05-01 20:18:00,0,"There are always fish within 15 miles of the campground area.Fishinitis,Miss Piggy,the Hooker all do well.I've heard no complaints about any of them.18 footer is fine ,but when she blows up everyone heads for shore.I've caught fish down to 100'but usually above 60'.I should mention the ""trout hunt""is in july(no date yet) and things are usually pretty busy that week,so you should check ahead(re:camping).I live in Nipigon and usually make a trip or two each year,but I enjoy catching all species so I fish a lot of different water and would rate my laker knowledge as fair.Hope this helps."
