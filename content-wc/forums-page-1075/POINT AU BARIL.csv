507725,Guest,2000-04-28 08:25:00,0,"I'VE FOUND THE BEST TIME FOR WALLEYE IS AT NIGHT, LAST FALL WE WENT UP STRICKLY FOR EYES. THE FIRST NIGHT WE CAUGHT 8 WITH THE BIGGEST 12#'S. WE TROLLED WITH SHALLOW DIVING Rapalas in 3-4 feet of water with current. We never fish out in the bay. I've got riggers and planers but never even take them. We just run two straight lines at night, during the day we fish for Pike and Musky with walleye being just something to do in the evening. Good luck Ranger"
