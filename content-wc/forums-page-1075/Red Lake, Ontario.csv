507212,Guest,2000-02-29 21:48:00,0,"If you are looking for a lake that is remote and has lots of 40""+ Northern Pike and big numbers of Lake Trout...Take a look at South Bay Lodge 42 miles NE of Ear Falls (boat-in 3 miles) www.southbaylodge.com"
507213,Guest,2000-02-29 23:25:00,0,"What are you planning to fish for? If you're looking for walleye, I would drive down the road 7 miles and fish the Gullrock Chain. It's connected to Red Lake, but I think the walleye fishing is much easier on Gullrock."
507214,Guest,2000-03-01 07:39:00,0,"What is your top priority? If your main goal is to slam walleyes like crazy, I would NOT recommend the west end of Red Lake. However, if you just want to fish, be completely relaxed and away from everything, I have a resort for you. You'll catch plenty of good-eating northerns and a few lake trout. The scenery is amazing and you'll rarely run into other boats. Bow Narrows Camp is the western most camp on Red Lake. I've been there twice and had a blast. Only problem is that this end of the lake holds very few walleyes. We're going to Lac Seul this summer."

507216,Guest,2000-04-28 15:22:00,0,Could not say enough good things about Peter and Chimo. I will be there in July for 6th time and have enjoyed every trip. Peter flys his own planes so no waiting for Green Airway to fit you in.
507217,Guest,2000-04-28 19:25:00,0,"Have been going to Weavers Wilderness Camp on Gull Rock for 19 years. We go the second week of season. Last year 6 guys caught over 900 walleye and other cabin of 7 caught over 1000 all were nice size biggest was 8 1/2 #. This was an exceptional year, probably never see the like again but can hope."
507218,Guest,2000-04-29 20:27:00,0,gary lynn couldn't be more accurate. Have been goping up there for the past few years and the fishing is nothing short of fabulous. Excellent walleye and northern fishing. Even caught some nice lake trout 2 years ago. Mike and Gerry weaver treat you like you are a member of their family and the cabins are always cleaner than a whistle

If you are going to red lake region you need to go to way north camp which is located 150 air miles north of red lake. Once you get there there are 5 lakes to fish. Favorable lake has trophy walleye and huge northerns. Last year we caught 23 northers over 15 pounds on favorable and many walleye over 6 lbs. Lemonade lake is a walleye factory. We fished it twice and averaged 80 walleyes a day average size of 3lbs. e-mail me if you would like more info. South trout lake does not a huge amount of walleye but they are big!!! We caught 8 walleye over 10 lbs last year. sdyer@rittal-corp#####"
507220,Guest,2000-05-02 20:59:00,0,"20 miles north of Red Lake is Nungesser Lake Lodge. They pick you up by boat on the Nungesser River, then a trail ride thru the woods. This place is excellent, from price to fishing. Give them a look...a great balance of price, fishing, privacy etc...they have a website, but I do not remember it at this time..If you need detailed info and decide to go, email me for some details"
