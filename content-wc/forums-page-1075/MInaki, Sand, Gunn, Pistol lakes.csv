I HAVE FOUND THEM IN 50 FEET. BOTTOM BOUNCING WORKS THE BEST, THE FISH ARE GOOD SIZE ALSO. YOU WILL WANT TO FISH AROUND GREEN, AND BURNT ISLAND. THE NORTHERNS ARE MAKING A GOOD COME BACK LAST YEAR WE GOT A 18 AND 22 LBS. THE MUSKIE IS GREAT ALSO, FISH THE REEFS!!! THANKS BILL P.S. WERE ARE YOU STAYING????"
