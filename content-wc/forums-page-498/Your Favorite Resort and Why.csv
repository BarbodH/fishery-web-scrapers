But on Jareds island I feel like I am home. It just feels right. The fishing is amazing and the location is remote. It is all I look forward to every year."
1293358,Mike Kansas,2011-04-11 08:24:00,1463,"We have been there three times. We go in the fall either late September of early October. The best fishing for us as been up at the bouys at the dam on the left hand side and down river around the pipeline crossing. If you go down river there are a lot of good looking spots and I'm guessing that Pakwash is about a 45 minute run. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1292496,jsmyers,2011-04-08 14:25:00,198,"What is the relationship between these Gawleys and the Ray Gawley who runs (with his son I believe) Gawley's Parkview Camp on Wabaskang?My family stayed with the Gawleys on Wabaskang in the 70s-90s.I believe I remember reading that Gawley's Bay in Wabaskang was named for Raymond' older brother or father, who also built the Wine Lake camp. Anybody know anything more concrete?"
1292516,stumcfar,2011-04-08 15:04:00,451,We have been treated right and have sure enjoyed our stays at Golden Eagle near Ear Falls.
1292544,Steve Ediger,2011-04-08 16:20:00,97,"I'm sure there may be bigger, or better, or nicer, or whatever lodges out there, but I quit looking around about twelve years ago after I went to Lac Seul Lodge. Mike is right, good equipment, cabins, and people. I try to make up there three weeks a year. It seems like when I'm not there, I'm thinking about being there."
1292556,slobco,2011-04-08 16:33:00,19,Don't have a favorite yet but will be staying at Little Canada Camp in Ear Falls in 2012 with a friend. Anyone have experience fishing the English river from Ear Falls to Pakwash lake? How far is it from Ear Falls to Pakwash lake via the river and is Camping lake worth a shot? Wouldn't mind going after some big northern with suckers and a quick strike rig.

1292697,Guest,2011-04-09 06:54:00,0,"Tetu Island Lodge. Have been going there for 10 years. No question the best service, cabins, food, and fishing we've experienced in Canada. The owners are great people and the staff rocks!"
1292750,NARDA 1,2011-04-09 09:49:00,636,"With out question my favorite is Birch Dale Lodge on Eagle Lake. I am looking forward to my 23rd year there in September. The cabins and epuipment are nice, the fishing is great, but most importantly to my group and I is that we have been treated like family. While we continue to maintain a close personal relationship with Ernie and his family, we feel we are well on our way to developing the same relationship with the new owners, Cheryl and Marcel. And look forward to another 20+ years at Birch Dale."
1292784,bigdaddy66,2011-04-09 11:45:00,7,"I have fished Camping a couple of weeks in late July or early August.We caught a few nice fish in the lake, but spent most of our time in the river as it left Camping."

They truly want you to have a great vacation while at Brace Lake Outfitters. If you ask, they will make it happen, They are two highly motivated individuals trying to do all they can for their customers. Great fishery for walleye, pike, perch. Also runs a first class hunting operation for black bear, moose and wolf. 10 of us are excited to go there every year, Great Place.Rob"

1292034,Obabikon,2011-04-07 10:22:00,2370,"Obabikon Bay Camp (Amason's Obabikon) I know it might be self-serving, but I love this place with all my soul. While my parents had sold the camp in 1997, I tried multiple times to repurchase it. It's where I was raised, it's where I learned to love the Canadian outdoors, and it's where my heart is (and always has been). Now my wife and I have been back for 4 years (starting year 5). It's where we plan on raising our family. It's where we plan on growing old together. It's where I plan on having my ashes scattered once I've baited my last hook. I live a truly blessed life. Man I'm ready for the ice to go out!"
1292061,Knoxabilly,2011-04-07 11:35:00,225,"Evergreen on Lac Seul. Awesome location, extremely clean and nice. Pat and Gary are so nice and helpful. They are very affordable and even the deck hand is great. I would not go anywhere else. Used to be Golden Fawn loyal and that went downhill and we came across Evergreen and saw how a lodge should be ran."
