It is nice to catch some really small sizes as then knowing the fish population is healthy. If only caught eaters and bigger, I would be a little concerned.Fisherman 1792"

1293545,phishfearme,2011-04-11 17:20:00,1242,"the walleye ain't different but the fishing situations are very different. in quebec, outfitters frequently have ""exclusive rights"" to a large region and only people who use that outfitter can fish the lakes in that region. no such thing exists in ontario. in ontario, outfittters must obtain ""land use permits"" from the crown in order to build a cabin/lodge, stash boats or anything else on crown land. the native population also has a big say as to what can be done north of i think 51deg. residents or non-residents in ontario can also access crown land for camping or canoe tripping even if someone holds an LUP for any lake involved. couldn't happen in an ""exclusive rights"" area of quebec each philosophy has it's goods and bads but in quebec there are MANY more roads into lakes - in ontario you'll probably have to float plant it in. i personally like ontario's way of doing thinks. it's much less of a ""private property"" mentality. phish"

1294333,gary2242,2011-04-13 16:13:00,49,"Everything west of Hudson Bay and James Bay has a much longer growing season thus more fish and bigger fish. A strong catch-&-release attitude among lodge owners and fisherpersons combined with less people fishing because of the bad economy over the last few years, the fishing was as good as it was 100 years ago in 2010 and people who book fishing trips in 2011 are going to see fishing that they have never even dreamed of. It's going to be an awesome year for trophies and numbers.I manage the web sites for 200 lodges in Ontario with a few in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and the Yukon so if you need help finding the perfect place to go, just email me [email protected] GaryP.S. The women are hotter in quebec.....Nothing better than a cute little french girl saying ""we we"" all the time. That means ""yes"", a word Ontario women don't know.....lol..."
