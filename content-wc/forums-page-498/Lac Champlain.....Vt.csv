1293302,Superdad,2011-04-11 05:31:00,64,"I would think that the cold water would be a factor in finding trout or salmon, they would be looking for the warmer water as that's where the baitfish would be. I would troll shallow with planer boards very close to shore. We are fishing on Lake Ontario for browns and lakers and are fishing in depths from 3' to 20', the water temp is the KEY. Bon Chance.."

1293686,Superdad,2011-04-12 05:17:00,64,"Trappage, On Lake Ontario, we use spoons(Alpena Diamonds/ Suttons/Evil Eyes) and stickbaits (Smithwick Rogue/Rapala jointed J-11's/Spro Minnows) To get your lure close to shore or in shallow water, we use the in-line planer boards, which take the lure away from the boat. Don't be fearful of fishing shallow, I runa 20 foot boat and have the boat in 6-8 feet of water with the baits in 3 -4 feet. Here are some articles:http://www.lakeontariounited.com/blo...ut-fishing.phphttp://www.lakeontariounited.com/blo...out-part-2.php Do a google search for spring brown trout fishing and you'll see the videos from you tube which will help."
