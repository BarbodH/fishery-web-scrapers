The phone call to order and pay took less than 4 minutes.You can use a credit card for payment. The agent will tell you a delivery time, in my case it was up to one month, but as I said it took only 10 days.Click on the link below for additional info for Non-Canadian Residents:http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/2ColumnSubPage/STEL02_164832.html"

Since the Corner probably wont be open, I can still stop at Dutchies for beer and Cuban cigars on the way to Goose Bay Camp!"
1291269,rebs,2011-04-05 16:37:00,7587,I just drive across the border and get mine at Canadian Tire. Its about 15 minutes away.
1291486,wallydave,2011-04-06 07:19:00,2151,"Rebs, 15 minutes won't even get me out of Cen. Il!! So I went the phone route! Our group will not have as much time as we would like for this trip, so the phone route will help give us more time on the water! Plus, it helps to keep our trip seem just a little closer to actually happening! Will June ever get here!"
1291526,rebs,2011-04-06 08:33:00,7587,"I hear ya about June, in my case July heading to Oneida Lake for a week."
1291574,JDP,2011-04-06 10:00:00,1457,"What I like is having my license in hand when we hit the first bait shop,instead of standing in line to get my license I can look at tackle, bait, etc.One less thing to do n the drive up..."
1291598,Michigan Man,2011-04-06 11:03:00,9,"Me and a buddy called the same day for our licenses. I recieved mine in 5 days via mail. My buddy still hasnt gotten his--been over 5 weeks. He called afte a few weeks and they said they could not reissue one until 4 weeks had gone past. Finally, after 4 weeks, they faxed a copy of the license with a letter to keep with it stating the problem. I guess my point is that you better have 4 weeks to wait just in case it doesnt come quick. They said sometimes letters get caught in customs for whatever reason."
1293640,wallydave,2011-04-11 20:44:00,2151,"I just recieved my outdoors card and fishing license in the mail. I placed my order 4/5/11, opened my mail on 4/11/11. All I need now is a time travelling machine to speed up the wait until June!"
1293888,pike usa,2011-04-12 15:00:00,15,"my outdoors card came the other day after ordering it about a month ago. My canadian fishing license took about a week so i was fortunate on that. The trip to Melchett lake is less than two months away, Can't wait."
1294591,Walley Guide,2011-04-14 07:55:00,67,"For some odd reason I still enjoy walking in and buying my license over the counter. Guess it is due to the 35+ years. Kinda follow the if it isn't broken don't fix it policy. I have delt with enough little problems through the years, don't care to have one created due to my license ending up in someone elses mail box by mistake. just my two cents worth, which won't buy a thing anymore. Happy Fishin"" Walley"
