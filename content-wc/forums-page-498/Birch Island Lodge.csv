I am thinking of going back next year with my father but have heard (probably not from reliable sources) that fishing in the McGregor Bay/Bay Finn area is not good. Anybody have any reports on that area? -Metz If people concentrated on the really important things in life, there'd be a shortage of fishing poles. --Doug Larson"

Great Northern, Smallmouth & Musky too. Lots of big Rainbow are a bonus in May & June. Check out www.birchislandlodge.com"

I designed and manage their web site. You can email the stuff to Greg or directly to me at [email protected] if you are interested.Gary
