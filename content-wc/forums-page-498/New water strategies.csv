1293844,nd89sc88,2011-04-12 12:40:00,92,"Given your time frame, (seven weeks puts you in late May, right?). You are going to be fishing pretty shallow, post spawn fish. For my money, nothing beats casting crankbaits and jigs at obvious shoreline structures, including points, weed edges, rocks and gravel bars, etc., hopefully with wind blowing into them. With two guys in the boat, I'd have one guy throwing a deep diving shad rap, with a goal of getting the bait down to the bottom and bounce it off rocks, etc. The great thing about the shad rap is how it will float up and away from snags with a little slack line. In fact, I will frequently reel pretty quickly until I contact bottom, then stop reeling and simply pull/drag the bait along the bottom. I'll then reel up the slack, and let it float up a bit while I reel back to a tight line, before I begin dragging it back down along the bottom. Most of the strikes come as I'm reeling up the slack . . . The second guy can be pitching 3/8 jigs tipped with a minnow, or even plastic. I know it seems a little heavy, but you are looking for some speed in getting the bait down to the bottom, then swim/jig the bait about halfway back to the boat before reeling in for another cast. the goal is to cover water and find aggressive fish. Once you have found a couple spots (which you've marked on your map), go back and work each spot more slowly. Also, I usually have the spots I want to fish pre-marked on my map, and head to the farthest location first thing in the morning. Then I fish my way back to camp. I also try to have places marked on two or even three different shorelines, so I can pick which shoreline group of spots based upon that days wind direction. Anyway, hope this helps. Good luck. Bill"

1294292,lassh,2011-04-13 14:49:00,553,"One tactic I didn't see mentioned is pulling spinner rigs behind a stick weight or bottom bouncer. They will sometimes hit a rig near the bottom when they aren't interested in crankbaits. It appears that some guys pull these in the middle of the water column, but I have had more success keeping them on or near the bottom by adjusting the weight or your speed. Work them along flats, breaklines, and next to structure, You can cover more water than jigging but may pick up fish that are there but aren't hitting cranks. I too would troll cranks first. Then try rigs. Note the location where fish are caught and work the area with jigs quickly to see if there is a concentration of fish. You will develop a milk run which will expand and be adjusted every day. So try not to stay in one spot too long even if you're catching fish, especially if they are small ones. I enjoy fishing new waters because there is so much to learn. Have fun and good fishing. I wish I was going in early summer!"
1295441,tyson2925,2011-04-16 08:02:00,95,"my experience in finding fish in new canadian water is find a bay with wind blowing in. Weeds in the bay is a bonus. You can fish as shallow as 3 feet but trolling or casting in 5 -8 seems good. Seems basic but we typically out fish the rest of the guys in camp trolling an orange ""road runner"" jig with a twister tail, leach or minnow."
1291594,SteveJ715,2011-04-06 10:57:00,59,"Hi guys (and gals!),My dad and I are checking out a new lodge for the first time in about 20 years this spring. I'm wondering if anyone has any strategies on how to find the fish fast on a new lake. In years past, we'd know exactly where to look, since we'd been going to the same lake year after year. Some more info: We're going up the first week of the season (starting May 21), and it's a lodge with several smaller lakes drive-up or portage lakes that we'll probably try. (Smaller = a few square miles tops for most; one is 10 miles long, but that is the exception.)I'm sure the owners can point us in the right direction, but I'm curious what works for you -- what have you tried in the past that's worked?My thought was that we'd spend a lot of time dragging Rapalas around points and promising shorelines until we bump into a few walleyes. Any other ideas would be much appreciated. Is it summer yet?- Steve"
1291609,Freytown,2011-04-06 11:33:00,770,"Steve,Don't leave home w/o your electronics. Learning new water w/o electronics is a hit & miss process and can be a lengthy process.Since you have a least 20 yrs experience you must be able to recognize suitable walleye structure fron the land features.One tip an old timer told me has also worked for over 50 yrs...just look & see where everyone else is fishing. Good luck!!!!"
1291610,DanM57,2011-04-06 11:36:00,135,"If I didn't troll, I would fish a jig or Lindy rig on a windblown point or shoreline with rocks. I would also fish where any water was flowing into the lake. The key is to not spend too much time in one place, keep looking."
1291615,vteye,2011-04-06 11:47:00,812,"Dan why not hire a guide for one day? When you balance the overall cost of the trip with all the extras included, the cost for immediate access to fish seems minimal."
1291661,wallydave,2011-04-06 13:43:00,2151,"Check with your host on where, when, how deep, and what colors to use. They want you to have a good trip, good trips will usually mean repeat business!"
1293568,SteveJ715,2011-04-11 18:16:00,59,"Thanks for the feedback, guys. About seven weeks till we head up to Sioux Lookout. To say I can't wait would be putting it mildly!- Steve"
1293664,MorganMan,2011-04-11 22:54:00,341,"I'm not sure about the guide idea. They know you are there for a day with them and they will put you on fish, but probably the same fish you would find yourself. Guides will give you spots they want other people to fish so the honey holes are there for them. If you are going up there, you likely have enough knowledge to fine some eyes yourself. You started a good thread as many want to know the same principles, but the canadian shield lakes are easier to find success than overfished ones in US. If you haven't been up and don't fish a guide will make your trip enjoyable because you just want action. Do some research on it and I bet you can do as well."
1293713,Bill Krejca,2011-04-12 06:58:00,6107,"Check out the wind direction and fish area blowing into. It doesn't have to be where the waves are 4 ft high, sometimes between 2 land masses can be quite good. Even a light wind seems to congregate the food chain and the fish you are after. Bill"
1293759,camp chef,2011-04-12 08:44:00,915,"Don't be so quick to discount the guide the first day on new water. I often use a guide for a day to show me unmarked navigation hazards.Spending a day in the boat with someone familiar with the water will make my job easier the rest of the week. I've made friends that have shared info with me years after ""the day they Guided me"""
1293779,Golden Eagle,2011-04-12 09:48:00,2642,Look for fishing patterns rather than hot spots. Then put past experiences to work for you.
