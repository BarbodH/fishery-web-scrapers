1288734,camp chef,2011-03-30 09:06:00,915,"We are headed to a new lake this spring.(Pipestone) and as luck would have it,a couple of friends/brothers that we know have been going to Pipestone a couple times a year for 10 years or so. We had a nice rabbit and pheasant dinner with a couple bottles of good wine as they shared their maps with us just the other night. These pre and post trip get togethers are as much a ritual with us as the actual trip. Does anyone else get together ""off the lake"" to share pictures,planning or stories?"
1288740,Outfitter17,2011-03-30 09:13:00,127,"We have a few groups that talk about doing get togethers. The ones before the trip get them pumped about the trip and the ones after get them pump for next years trip. You will have a great trip on pipestone, if you need some fishing spots, just let me know."
1288741,Aaron-IN,2011-03-30 09:16:00,500,"Camp chef.....if there is still a portage into Kishkutena you should try it a day, unbelievable Musky and Smallmouth lake."

So we had to come up with a name for the group.So we came up with; North American Rye Drinkers Association or NARDA. This was because the lodge owner got us hooked on rye whiskey when we first started going up. We usually go up in late August early September so we make our reservation for the next year before we leave camp. Then we attend the All Canada Show in St. Charles Illinois in January and help with manning the booth at the show. After the show I send out an itinerary for the coming trip. Then the Chief Financial Officer (yes we all have job titles) developes a proposed budget and distributes it. A pre-trip meeting is scheduled for July and any adjustments are made. Shopping is done for the group the day before the trip, all moneys are handled by the CFO and are paid with the groups debit card or checking account. Then everything is loaded into the groups trailer for the trip. We also have a Christmas dinner in December along with other group functions throughout the year. We also have hats, jackets, t-shirts, key chains, luggage tags, coasters, glassware, flag and the trailer all with the group logo on them. The trailer has gotten us searched almost every year because of the logo but the Customs guys know us now. It has gotten quite out of hand, but is a lot of fun."

1291790,pike usa,2011-04-06 18:50:00,15,"This is my first year to join the group goin' to Canada but i don't think our entire crew get together just to plan the trip. However, 5 out of 6 communicate weekly by email and/or phone. This group that I have joined are probably the most organized people I've been around. They discuss our meal plan for the week but everything else that we need they have written down. I am fortunate that I am goin' with a bunch of guys that have visited Canada for many years because I have read a few horror storys on here for not the proper planning.I've also been fortunate to gather with a few ppl in our group to enjoy the great fish frys.. The battered walleye and pike are flat out delicious and now I can contribute by bringing back the maximum amount of fish this year to the states.. I would like to gather all the guys, enjoy the fish talks and eat some Canadian fish while planning future trips.. Good times with good friends."
1293337,wallydave,2011-04-11 07:21:00,2151,"I am taking a new guy to Lac Seul this June. We have e-mailed shopping list ideas back and forth. Last month we hit Gander Mountain for some shopping and planning. He loaded up on jigs, line and spoons for pike along with some leaders for those toothy critters! Some rain gear as well!With 54 days to go, we will need to meet again to discuss meal planning and packing.Another family group will be meeting us at Goose Bay, so we will plan a few dinners with them.We have a room in Fort Frances for Friday night, then on our way to Goose Bay! We have called and ordered our Outdoors card, and licenses. Now it is a matter of waiting, going over our tackle boxes, rigging and checking the fishing gear.A Bass Pro shop will be opening in our area later this year, maybe we can stock up there for next years trip!"
