1282738,rjg,2011-03-15 15:38:00,13,"The owners are very happy to have guests follow them around to hot spots. Very, very helpful to putting guests on fish. Very good fishery. The limit for americans is two, but who goes fishing to see how many you can keep? You can catch and release as many as you like. I spend a couple months there each summer and catch as many fish as I care to."
1282981,rjg,2011-03-16 09:01:00,13,Great walleye fishing
1283085,wolverine fan,2011-03-16 14:22:00,71,"Funny how when a couple people are thinking about the same area , i was on realoutdoors.com this afternoon watching an old video they did on Bayview Lodge which is across the way from P.C. Since i'm mainly a northern pike and bass fisherman that video will give you an idea as to the quality of northerns and musky in that system. The videos not spliced with different dates, fishermen etc as ive seen other places. My own personal experience with p.c. has only been with the restaurant/bar and that was good. We were staying in a locals cabin during the stanley cup finals and needed a tv and a beer and some pizza and they happily supplied it along with a bill!! I personally like a more ""canadian"" style experience with fewer people and cabins etc but hey thats just me. In ten minutes boat ride from p.c. you can be in a secluded bay and have that feeling though. I mainly fish little sand, north end of big sand and rough rock so its pretty darn quiet most days. Pm me if you have any questions on those areas or fishing those areas."
1283131,ranger22,2011-03-16 16:52:00,124,Walleye fishing is awsome. Lot's of eaters and overs.
1283806,rjg,2011-03-18 09:55:00,13,"I should have mentioned that it is only42.50 a day per person or 297.50 for a week. Less than one half the price of holiday inn and ten times the fun. Fishing is awesome for big walleyes, northerns, muskies, and bass."
1284069,wolverine fan,2011-03-19 03:30:00,71,Dang- i totally missed the holiday inn in minaki!! LOL
1285443,briand,2011-03-22 12:32:00,48,"Last week not a single other fisherman or reef to be found.Stricktly talking walleye, this body of water hold a good population of 16"" - 24"" fish and a good number of 25"" - 28"" fish. This river system is large enough, and armed with a good map a person can catch fish all day with only seeing the odd passing boat. Or follow the ""hot spot map"" and play bumper boat. I cannot help you with the lodges, but i know the quality of the fishing will not disappoint.Good luck"
1294520,dwrisch,2011-04-14 05:21:00,13,"I have been fishing the Winnipeg River system out of Minaki since 1967. I have seen many changes in resort ownership, limits on Walleye, and fish caught both in numbers and quality. Staying at Paridise Cove since Duane **** bought the property, I can say that I have never had a bad trip or nights sleep in his cabins. Sure, they could use some updating, but they are clean, warm, dry, and have hot running water. Sure the Walleye limit has been reduced for non Canadians to two, but if you look at the cost per pound of fish caught (2, 4, or 6) versus what you have invested in fishing gear, boat, motors, and fuel, you are looking at the whole picture the wrong way. Fishing is about spending fun time with your friends, family and Whiskey (away from work) not what you can bring back across the border. Finally, The last three to four years have been the best fishing in numbers and size that I have seen in a long time. In closing, I will be in Minaki this year from June 20th to July 5 (at Paridise Cove) and then again another two weeks in August. If you plan a trip during that time, I would be glad to meet with anyone to show them what area is producing, or even follow me. Lets try to keep the posts positive. Don"
1294546,Guest,2011-04-14 06:51:00,0,"We've been over to PC numerous times during the past 30+ years, but that was for lunch or breakfast at the resturant. [We did stop over to check out the new cabins on the point, they were very nice and went for a decent price.] There always seem to be plenty of anglers staying at PC1 or 2, and the other resorts at Minaki. You can find whatever type of trip you are looking for in the various resorts; bring your own boat, use theirs and even have them provide the meals if you want. (Birch island has a very nice restraunt too, and you can go to the marina and they'll make reservations for you.) We've never had problems catching walleye at Minaki, but I admit we spend the vast majority of time on the smallmouth bass, pike and musky. (Nothing like getting into some primo smallmouth action at Minaki) The river system and associated lakes offer a very diverse cross-section of walleye fishing, but the sheer size of the area can be intimidating to someone who is new to it. You can always find walleye on the river, especially during a bad cold front; we don't use live bait anywhere to catch them, even on the lakes. Most of the time we'll get walleye for dinner while beating the banks for smallmouth; but most years many are too big to keep. Hiring a guide for the first day is a wise option if you are new to the system. It's a quick way to get some confidence and familiarity with the system. But you can figure it out with a little work on your own. In addition you can even search the forum for some older posts on the walleye fishing up there -- the old walleye spots are still good places to try depending on the seasonality and when you are there. We'll be at Sunset Point in June for another 3 weeks.... [Thanks DonC for the kind words too!] ChuckE (still a guest)"
1295338,Guest,2011-04-15 22:57:00,0,"20 years ago I would agree, but now you can go to much better places. So many people hang on to memories, but reality is another thing. As a guide in the area. you can do much better for your dollar."
1281574,wmd,2011-03-12 15:50:00,388,Tell me about this resort and area please. Quality fishing on size and numbers? Are reefs marked that could do damage to your boat? Is it reasonably remote or are there boats and people everywhere. Fill me in on the owners and what the place is like. The website is pretty poor on explaining what the water is like and how big the water is. Does a guy need to hire a guide the first day? Tell me what to expect.
1281580,tackleman,2011-03-12 15:56:00,444,"Last fall I was fishing in the Red Lake fall classic walleye tournament and gary roach and his partner, Duane **** were fishing beside me. I asked gary if he had ever been to a lodge that I was looking at and he said ""why go there when you can go to Duanes' place, (paradise cove)""Now I have neighbours that go to the tournaments that Duane runs over the summer and they tell me the fishing is great. there are lots of big fish and it is not too hard of an area to fish. get a map or a gps chip of the area and you should be fine. Minaki is on the Winnipeg river and then into some lakes , I'm not sure since the only time I fished there was right under the railway bridge in the centre of the town.Lots of local people aren't impressed with the operation but I haven't met anyone in my travels that stayed there who were dissatisfied with there stay."
1281819,tikka_t3,2011-03-13 09:50:00,14,"We have stayed at the resort for the past couple of years and have had good experiences. Heading back again in August of this year. Fishing has been good we primarily target walleye but the area is also good for pike, muskie and smallmouth. There are lots of cottages right around Minaki but with access to the Winnipeg river, Big Sand Lake, Little Sand Lake, and Roughrock you have lots of choices. Duane sells a ""hot spot"" map for about $20 that has more spots marked than you can fish in a week. You can also buy nautical charts for the area at Canada Map sales. Navigation is good especially if you buy the charts. No real need to hire a guide our experience has been that the staff there is more than happy to give you some ideas on where to fish.I have only talked about the North side there is also ample opportunitie if you head South from Paradies cove but we have never fished that way so I can't speak to it."
1281853,Guest,2011-03-13 11:25:00,0,"This area has been hit hard. The walleye limit is reduced in half for this water system due to a loss of fish. There was and still is a lot of argument whether it is due to netting or non-resident fishing. Non resident walleye limit is 2 fish possession. Although it is starting to recover, there are better places to fish until it does."
1282242,Guest,2011-03-14 13:46:00,0,"The fishing has been improving the past couple of years. Get a map from Paradise Cove, it does show almost everything you need to know. The only draw back with Paradise Cove 1 is that the cleanliness of the cabins and the beds have steadily declined in the past couple of years. It seems that they don""t want to reinvest in better beds and other furnishings."
1282247,camp chef,2011-03-14 13:54:00,915,"Take a look at Big north Lodge.....On the same water but farther from town.A lot more peaceful south of Minaki.Fished for 5 years out of Big North. Great people,great cabins great fishing."
1282265,Aaron-IN,2011-03-14 14:40:00,500,"Let me answer all of your questions honestly. The Minaki area is not remote by any means and there will be plenty of others fishing in the area. If you get the so called ""hot map"" you will probably have plenty of company no matter where you go on that map. There are a number of unmarked reefs (more like rocks) that will damage your boat. If you do go there make sure you talk to the folks at PC as I'm sure they can tell you areas to avoid. I dont know the PC people personally but the place looks okay and they have recently built new cabins. If you are walleye fishing then I would have to agree with the above poster about the quality of fishing not being as good and yes there are additional restrictions on that system. If you are fishing for Musky or Smallmouth then you will have a hard time finding a better system in that area to fish. If it were me I would hire a guide the first day or so, especially if you are fishing for walleye."
1282271,Moondog,2011-03-14 15:06:00,362,"WMD,No offense intended, but I would have a hard time believing someone (2 ""guests"" in a row) who just happens to be looking at WC and throws in his or her 2 cents worth about a resort but doesn't bother to register for the forum. I don't know anything about Paradise Cove but I would be concerned that someone may be taking a cheap shot at them. We get those sometimes on here."
1282391,DonC,2011-03-14 19:51:00,93,"If you want American Plan and a very nice lodge and boats at Minaki, with very good fishing, I recommend Birch Island Resort. Feel free to PM me if interested. I live in TN. I fish primarily smallmouth. Aaron and ChuckE know quite a bit about the fishing on the Winnipeg River also. DonC"
1282444,rcotton,2011-03-14 21:43:00,3,"have fished there several times had tough days and great days.. there are cabins from older to new and would stay in any of them again. they are knowledgeable and friendly there are cabins along the shore in some of the areas so its not as remote as some lakes but have always enjoyed the time spent there and plan on making trips again their price has been the same for quite awhile unlike some of the other places I have checked into that I think are a little high for a fishing trip shouldnt have to mortgage a trip. Have had some huge fish both walleye, northerns and smallmouths."
