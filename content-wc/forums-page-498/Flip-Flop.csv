1291531,Obabikon,2011-04-06 08:36:00,2370,"Oh, and for the potential fuel charges/increased costs above par... resorts should (and usually do) have that posted if that is their policy."
1291539,Golden Eagle,2011-04-06 08:43:00,2642,Let me know what's expected and I'll deal with it. I have the power to make myself happy. I'm the most important ingredient for having a successful fishing trip.
1291544,GOBIG,2011-04-06 08:53:00,126,"Well said, it is what you make of it."
1291546,camp chef,2011-04-06 08:55:00,915,"If I am allowed to come to your camp and enjoy the wonderful scenery,serenity,fishing and comraderie just tell me how you would like to be paid. Dollars, Yen, Pesos, marbles or firewood.It doesn't matter. I'm in."
1291836,eyemike,2011-04-06 20:07:00,233,I will pay in whatever currency they ask me to. As long as I know what I am going to pay ahead of time I'm a happy guy.
1291881,SinOrSwim,2011-04-06 22:10:00,1528,"There is a certain population of people that will complain about anything. They work their butt off to find the cheapest vacation and then get upset the food is so expensive. We all know the type. They find out they won the lottery and the first comment is...............well, yeah but you have to pay taxes on it...........daaaahhhhhhhh. Who cares. You just won FREE money. Go on vacation with your eyes open. Be able to afford the vacation you are going on and have fun. Or, wait another year and then go. It should not be so stressful."
1292038,teddi,2011-04-07 10:25:00,349,it looks like the day of the us dollar is over. the canadian dollar is going higher by the day.
1292321,Fisherman1792,2011-04-08 05:43:00,927,"I am no economist, but I wouldn't say the days of the U.S.$ is done. Its just unforunately everything is going to crap right now. Massive debts around the world, a lot of countries are broke, and a lot of people are going to feel the pain.The only major reason why the C$ is high right now is because of oil and commodities. The manufacturing in this country is still hurting. Back in the mid 70's, the C$ was worth more than the U.S.$ for a lot of the same reasons that we are seeing now.This actually might be good for the U.S. as it should give the manufacturing sector in the U.S. a competative edge. Sometimes it is amazing how fast things can happen.I think this makes sense?Fisherman 1792"

AFTER the screwed me out of $30 on my license(long story) I was finishing up paying and gave him a $5 Ca and he has the balls to tell me I'll have to pay more if I use that ""funny money"" Never been back!!What do Canadians have to do, get us funds when they want to use these services in Canada??? That would be a pain."

1290431,Richard B,2011-04-03 17:09:00,735,"Walleye4life - Don't know how many countries you have been to but I have been to Germany, England, China, Thailand, India, South Korea, and Japan. They accept U.S. dollars but the calculate the exchange rate and then also charged 3 to 5 percent, for the hassle. If you charge your purchases, you will see the exchange rate for the day that you charged the items. You are correct the U.S. dollar is the reserve currency but who know for how much longer. With our debt other countries are not going to allow us to continue to spend like drunken sailors. Just my opinion."
1290441,walleye4life,2011-04-03 17:30:00,54,I agree... the days of the dollar are over!!!
1290444,T Mac,2011-04-03 17:39:00,10084,"This is kinda of a different spin on the original post...but, here goes: It's Canada. In Canada, I am sure they'd prefer to use Canadian funds all the time. It simplifies things, no doubt. Not being user friendly toward US funds ... could be a case of ""What comes around goes around"". (?) Some Canadian businesses won't take US cash at all. (The Casino north of Selkirk, MB...for example). We had 2 banks in Regina that would not exchange US funds... period. In one, when a teller tried to oblige us...her supervisor came out from his office, upbraided her, and told us that we were wasting the bank's time. Gas pumps won't accept US credit cards in much of Alberta...especially around Banff and Jasper. But~~ Ask any Canadian about all the years and years their currency was ridiculed...called ""funny money"", etc...by many Americans, and not accepted at many US locations. Or allow them to tell you about the many times how they got absolutley ripped off exchanging their Canadian money in the states. I have been embarrassed in my home town as to how Candian friends were treated when they tried to use Canadian money... and we are only 250 miles form the border. So, if it is a case of revenge... I don't blame the Candians at all. Just use Candian funds when you get into Canada...and have fun."
1290446,elway12,2011-04-03 17:42:00,335,When I first visited a Canadian fishing resort over 10+ years ago I always thought it was odd that the resorts charged in American $$(at that time it did help the resort). I think they should always charge in Canadian since the resorts are IN CANADA regardless of the exchange rate. But it is their resort and their lively hood to do whatever they want as long as people pay/visit them. Hope the place we stay still charges in US $ this summer
1290635,oleJoe,2011-04-04 08:28:00,114,"I usually find find that Canadian own resorts charge Canadian funds and resorts owned by Americans charge in U.S. currency. Our outfitter has always charged in Canadian funds and gives a fair exchange rate. We have always gone to a bank in canada to exchange our money. A better rate than the money exchange. As far as the bottled beer, cans only!! They don't want glass in at the camps. And 16 cases put you over the weight limit no matter how many are flying in. But I still love flying in."
1290773,aggie kolisnik,2011-04-04 13:43:00,39,"We still charge in US funds. We prefer you give us cash because of the currency exchange difference. A deposit cheque was just brought in to the bank for deposit (march 28/11)and we got .9588 for it.The bank charges for handling as well as the exchange. We lost on it, but will still continue to use the US currency we started the business with. It will have to change if we continue to lose on our transactions. we need to make a living also."
1290842,Obabikon,2011-04-04 16:16:00,2370,"I'm gonna call shenanigans. I know a TON of resort owners... I have not talked to a single one that has switched the ways they charge. Can anyone here name more than 3 resorts that have changed their charging for 2011? I know several who plan on doing extra fuel charges, and several that will increase their price (equally) when the Canadian dollar is better than par. Maybe I'm wrong... but it seems like there's always these unregistered users bashing Canadian camps on this."
1290852,GOBIG,2011-04-04 16:37:00,126,Can you pm me with the ones that are surcharging.
1291518,NathanH,2011-04-06 08:24:00,697,"With exchange rates at even levels who cares what they charge in? Besides the argument that they should only charge in dollars because guest tend to be from the US is not a good one. When overseas most of the guests at hotels are from the US but that doesn't matter you pay in the currency of the country you're in. And the US dollar is not what it once was, it will not be the World Reserve Currency much longer. IMF is already looking at SDR'S. Stick to the fishing and leave the monetary policies to people who know what they are talking about. I know that's What I will be doing."
1291528,Obabikon,2011-04-06 08:34:00,2370,GOBIG... a lot of the potential fuel surcharges will depend on where fuel actually ends up.
1290177,Guest,2011-04-03 06:07:00,0,It bothers me that so many resorts are switching to canadian funds from u.s. funds. (exclusively) I wonder if they will flip backed to u.s funds if the exchange rate swings hard back the other way.
1290187,GOBIG,2011-04-03 06:42:00,126,"I look at it like this. If i were a owner, i would get all the money i can anyway i could. I would not expect a camp to take a hit on money coming and going out. I have the canadian fever, the two trips i take are well worth the money, quiet, laughs, thrill, and just plain heaven. Most camp owners know that we keep their camps rolling. The ones i go to have not raised their prices, and i even got some deals this year."
1290204,Jack77,2011-04-03 07:04:00,168,"The same ones that are doing that are also the ones that do not get a lot of repeat customers. I do agree that outfitters/lodges should stick to one currency and it should be Canadian funds. I have no issue with outfitters trying to make a living but I disagree with them trying make money off of me anyway they can. As soon I see that going on I am out of there. I flew with an outfitter out of the Foleyet area. This outfitter told me to let them know how much beer I would need and they would have it at the air base when we arrived. I got to the airbase and found out that I had 16 cases of BOTTLED beer instead of cans. It was too late to do anything about it, the over weight charges were over the top. I will never again go with that outfitter. I felt like he was trying to milk every dime out of us when we got there."
1290244,JayM5209,2011-04-03 08:30:00,1050,"Ah, Jack, let me get this straight. You have also quit using banks for any services, you no longer buy insurance policies of any kind, you do not buy any kind of oil or oil-based products, you do not buy pharmaceuticals of any kind, you no longer buy any vehicles from a dealer, you refuse to fly on commercial airlines, etc., etc.. Right???And, the equally obvious, a group that pays to fly sixteen cases of beer to an outpost for a fishing trip doesn't have a whole bunch of room to complain about the requirement to pay in Canadian funds. How much was the purchase and freight on the beer? And what's the difference, $C vs. $US, for the package?Just my humble opinion as a retiree living on a modest fixed income, but seems to me that this whole issue, given what we all spend on our fishing related activities and acquisitions, is much ado about nothing."
1290278,walleye4life,2011-04-03 10:05:00,54,You guys should give the camp owners a break.... why don't you take a tour of NWO and see how many camp owners turned a profit last year........ you would probably be surprised.
1290312,v-bay gord,2011-04-03 11:23:00,3168,"It's not a plot. It is a function of fluctuating exchange rates and a dwindling profit margin for tourism business's. The bottom line, most resorts can't afford to just eat the difference anymore. If the bill's are in Canadain dollars, you need to be able to count on paying them based on what you are charging. After all, how would it work for you if your next paycheck was suddenly 5 or 8 % less?"
1290394,tackleman,2011-04-03 15:22:00,444,"I'm not a camp owner, I'm not a tourist in Canada.The currency of our country is OUR dollar. not the US greenback.I have always disapproved of the tourist operators charging in US dollar values. If the US dollar was worth more, make the appropriate adjustment and take Canadian money.When I visit the states, I find it almost impossible to pay with Canadian money and so I carry the currency of the country i'm in. I would think that if you went to europe you'd need to have euros to pay your way.you can bet that any business person will do their utmost to turn a profit and if that means going with a higher valued dollar that will happen."
1290403,fishman10,2011-04-03 16:03:00,226,the extra charge for can beer in canada is very much higher than bottled beer. so the outfitter was in fact saving you money!
1290418,Jack77,2011-04-03 16:36:00,168,Funny we still paid almost $40 a case
1290424,walleye4life,2011-04-03 16:47:00,54,"90% of all guests @ fishing camps in Canada are American. Outfitters should ONLY be able to charge in US Dollars... it is the world's reserve currency for a reason. If you buy a trip to mexico, europe, china, or anywhere else chances are you will pay in US Dollars.... that may change as the US govnt is currently run by idiots. If an outfitter wants to make up the exchange rate he should charge more...my 2 cents."
