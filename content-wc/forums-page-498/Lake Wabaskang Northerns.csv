1292278,pintaildux,2011-04-07 22:01:00,12,I have been to Wabaskang in June several times and Sept. We are going up the last week of Aug ending Labor day. My question is will the walleyes be in the narrows or in the deeper water? How about big northerns what should I be casting and where. Will they be more likely cruising the weedlines or deeper water. I will be staying at Sleepy dog. Thanks for any info
1293244,jsmyers,2011-04-10 19:56:00,198,"I don't have a lot to offer but I hate you see a thread about ""my"" lake get ignored.I used to go up to Wabaskang in mid to late August in the late 80s and early 90s when I was a kid.We caught very few large northerns. The ""big"" ones we did get were usually in deeper weedbeds. Big for us was 30."" Out in front of Tall Pines was a good spot for us. One year my cousin got one just downstream from the falls (Hobson/Williams) that was about 32-34."" We didn't really know to fish weed edges or rocky structure.We did very little walleye fishing, but fishing just past the 2nd narrows at dusk was a productive tactic.My understanding of pike now and Wabaskang in particular is that the fish move deeper and deeper until the water starts to cool down noticeably, then they will be back in the weeds or on rocky reefs. The end of August is usually before the cooling happens, but not always."

I know there are big ones in there after watching them on a few follows of my Jigs.Well hopefully I can my buddy away from walleye fishing to go after ""the big one"""
