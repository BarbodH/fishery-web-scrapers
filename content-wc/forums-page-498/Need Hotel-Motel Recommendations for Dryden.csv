1295064,Lovetofish,2011-04-15 10:09:00,458,The Holiday Inn is nice. Didn't mind the Comfort Inn because you can walk across the street for a beer.

1295187,Gary from Iowa,2011-04-15 15:01:00,74,"We were in Dryden a couple of years ago. The manager of the restaurant serving Greek and Indian food mentioned the Town and Country as a reasonably priced motel (We stayed at the Best Western, good accomodations but more expensive than I'm used to). I'm sorry we didn't know about this motel earlier. Since we haven't stayed at the Town and Country, I cann't give you my opinion on it.http://www.townandcountrymotel.ca/index.htmlGary"
1295208,ILScott,2011-04-15 15:38:00,139,We stay at the chalet. Last year it was $75 a room. Nothing fancy but nice rooms and they have restaurant right there. We sit outside and have a few beers.
