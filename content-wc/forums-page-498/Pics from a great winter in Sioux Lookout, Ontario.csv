Just thought I'd post something to look at while you are all getting ready for open water season. Ice conditions are still good here on the big lakes, and the snow is dropping fast! Walleye still open until this Friday! Last year I was in a boat at this time.http://www.facebook.com/album.php?fb...5440&aid=50903"

At that time of year, I could almost expect one of your group to pull in a monster Lake Trout while fishing walleye. Please vote for my pic, if you get a chance.....http://www.worldfishingnetwork.com/c...?entryid=85080"
