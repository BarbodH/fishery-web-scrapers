Between 1921 and 1926, they stocked 1.7 million Lake Trout in Sturgeon, Stoney, Lower Buckhorn and Balsam.25 years ago the old guy that ran the bait shop in the town of Buckhorn told me that once in a while a Lake Trout would get caught below the buckhorn dam because there is a deep trench in Lower Buckhorn and a few Lakers survived.Has anyone every caught or heard of someone catching a Lake Trout in the Kawartha Lakes??? Not counting Simcoe of course.Just so you know, the kawartha Lakes were last stocked with Pickerel (Walleye) in 1943 and Muskie in 1971.Gary"

There are a few lakes in the North Kawartha area that have trout in them but I would think the Kawartha chain is too shallow and too warm to support the fish. Best bet would be to contact the biologist at the MNR for any info and history.
