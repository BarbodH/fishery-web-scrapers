I am trying to save a beautiful lodge!This message is for those of you who have been to Chapleau Lodge in the last two years, or those of you who know someone that went to Chapleau Lodge in the last two years.Bob Landry owned the lodge for 30 years and built the lodge up to be one of the best fishing lodges in Ontario. He retired in 2009 and sold the lodge. The person who bought the lodge destroyed the business by scaring off all the long time customers. People going there for the first time in the last two years are scared to go back. In a nut shell, the new owner was a violent drunk, which made people’s stay very unpleasant. According to the police in Chapleau, that is just the start of the story.Gord and Caroline, who are experienced owners, have bought the lodge and have been working hard getting the lodge back up to the high standards of service and facilities that past guests expect. The problem is they don’t have many bookings because word got around about the last owner. This will be their first season running this lodge.To pick up some bookings, they are discounting 25% off all bookings made before the season starts on May 15. I was hoping you could check out their lodge and photo galleries and consider their lodge if you are looking for a great Walleye, Pike, Bass and Trout fishing trip. http://www.chapleaulodge.comIf you know someone who has been to Chapleau Lodge in the last two years, can you tell them there are new owners for this year.ThanksGary"
