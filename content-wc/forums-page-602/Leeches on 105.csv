Going in a few weeks but traveling in a motor home so do not want to venture far off the beaten trail. Want to reserve them but don't want to get screwed by people ""light"" bagging them ahead. Inquiring minds want to know? Moondog"

Leeches are for sale at the Four Seasons Sport Shop in Ear Falls. There may be other bait dealers around, but if there is a good turn over of bait, it will almost always be fresh. There should only be a couple bucks difference between Vermillion Bay and Ear Falls."
