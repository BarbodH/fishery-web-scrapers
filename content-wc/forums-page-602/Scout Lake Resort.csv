1044046,Guest,2008-07-21 06:55:00,0,I'll never stay at Scout Lake again. Went there for 8 years.
1044266,Guest,2008-07-22 06:46:00,0,"My wife and I have been fishing Lac Seul for the past 12 years - the last 5 out of Whitewing. We have always found Terry and his Wife, Gwen (she also works there), to be most gracious, helpful and accommodating. Dave, the owner, has fished the lake for many years and is always more than happy to share his knowledge, when asked. The resort has very nice modern cabins with exceptionally well maintained grounds. They provide daily towel service and trash removal. Rates are very competitive and in many instances below those of other resorts. We are booked again for next July - can't wait!!"
575222,Guest,2008-06-19 19:39:00,0,Anyone have any experience on this resort or outpost? Thanks
575224,Guest,2008-06-19 19:52:00,0,"My wife and I along with another couple have stayed at Scout Lake Resort since 2005 and are staying there again the first week in August. Cabins are nice & clean, location is very good. Have never stayed at the McKenzie Bay Outpost, so can't comment on that."
575231,Guest,2008-06-20 05:12:00,0,I wouldn't stay there when there are some really good resorts close by at a better price.
575242,Guest,2008-06-20 09:21:00,0,Dave what are some other resorts close and which one would you prefer. I read some posts in archives and see they get mixed reviews.

The cabins were nice and the grounds were clean and well kept. Lizzy was an outstanding host - She works hard to ensure all guest are taken well care of. We were impressed! I was concerned with all the comments on my thread about the resort however we did not see what others commented about. We will definitely return. Not sure what some of the guys on the board saw when they were there or what they are looking for however we thought it nice. Oh and by the way, fishing in Mckenzie bay was incredible! :-)"

We have tried a fly in and only wished we had gone to Goose Bay Camp. All but one time we stayed at Goose Bay Camp. Andrea is fantastic in making sure all is great. She has always told us where the fish are and is always on the money. Needless to say, I can't wait to return."
575687,Guest,2008-07-01 20:05:00,0,"Be careful with whitewing. They have nice cabins but Terry....runs the dock...is a jerk. If you are new to the lake, he offers no advice. We had to help some newer folks find some spots and show them the ropes.Last year the water was low. We needed help getting our boat out of the water. They have a tractor...he refused to help us. Told us we had to wait 4 hours. When 4 hours came, he said he was to busy. There are other choices."
1043827,Guest,2008-07-19 17:28:00,0,"Terry is a jerk??? We stayed at the resort for the first time last year, and he seemed like a pretty good guy. We had the cabin next to his RV and we even shared a beer or two. He took the time to point us to a few spots on the map. Not defending him...just saying that he and the resort owners were top notch people. JN"
