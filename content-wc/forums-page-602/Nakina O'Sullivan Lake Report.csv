576003,Bill Krejca,2008-07-13 14:35:00,6107,"Just returned from O'Sullivan Lake near Nakina. This was our 3rd year at O'Sullivan's Rainbow Lodge, a drive-to resort, and it was the best fishing year of the 3. We got multiple 27""er's and many, many in the over 20"" length, including a number of 25's and 26er's. An interesting aspect is the the fish seem to growing each year and are now starting to provide some good quality as well as quantity, lots of quantity. The lake was up again, but not quite as much as last year. Bugs were plentiful when the wind didn't blown. Water temperature ranged from 63 degrees to 59 degrees, a bit cool for this time of year. We caught one lake trout in 16' of water, somewhat unusual, but reasonable, considering the temp's. An interesting aspect of the trip was that the best bait was Gulp 4"" smelt minnows. Used them on 1/4oz jig heads having a somewhat larger hook. I really liked the mushroom style head, as it seemed to give the best action to the Gulp. The water is fairly clear, although a little stained, and white or black jigs heads seemed to work best. The brighter colored heads were not as productive. By the 3rd day or so, all 8 in our party were using this setup. I am developing a strong feeling that it is the action of Gulp rather than the scent that makes it so attractive to the fish. When you wiggle it a little, it just looks like a small fish is supposed to look! The fish came from 6-9' of water the first part of the week, but by the time we stopped fishing Friday we were getting them from 8'-24'. We plan on being back about the same time next year. Now to get ready for that LOW crappie trip in Sept."

576013,phishfearme,2008-07-14 06:19:00,1242,"bill - thanks for the detailed report. how many people do they usually have at the lodge? are there any outpost cabins away from the lodge? are there other cabins/lodges on the lake? thanks, phish"
576016,Bill Krejca,2008-07-14 06:50:00,6107,"I believe they have 6-8 4 person cabins and 2 8 person cabins. The 2 larger ones have their own bathrooms, the others have a central shower house, which is quite close. They also have an outpost cabin about 5 miles from camp, which is located about 3/8 of a mile from some of the best fishing. They have have been fairly busy when we have been there, most of the cabins have been filled. They also have a fairly small camping area, which is located by the water; it is away from the cabins. Web site is osullivansrainbow.com. An interesting place. There are no other lodges on the lake, although there is one which is basically a fly-in base, which is up a river a mile or so. Access to the lake is limited. The only people we have ever seen have been those staying at the camp."
576065,Burdman,2008-07-16 15:14:00,11,Nice to hear you had a nice trip. This is the first time in over 20 years that I am not out there fishing this time of the year. Were you fishing at the sisters? Did you make it to Superb Lake? I've found this to be the best no frills fishing camp. Always had a good time. How were Bob and Shelly doing? Hope to be back there next year. Maybe I'll see you there sometime. Thanks again for the report.:cheers:
1043526,IaDave,2008-07-18 11:14:00,476,Bill- How long of a drive is it from Cedar Rapids?
1043729,Pooch,2008-07-19 07:07:00,4619,"Hi Bill,I really enjoyed your book. Too bad others on this board are not aware that you have written one.Thanks for a really nice easy read about the early days of fishing the northlands.Pooch"
1043798,Guest,2008-07-19 13:33:00,0,"Burd: I posted a reply, but it got misplaced somewhere in the site format change. We did not fish the sisters much, but did spend a lot more time east of Dunn's Island. The other 2 boats did go to Superb one day for the first time, and did OK. My boat ended up about a mile from camp that day in a new honey hole we ""stumbled"" across. I only used 12 gallons of gas the whole week (115 hp 4 stroke). Bob and Shelly are doing fine, they certainly are gracious hosts; they make you feel they really appreciate your business. Ia Dave: The camp is 860 miles from Cedar Rapids(Robins), a little farther than LOW, but closer than the 1200+ miles we've gone to Snow Lake. If you are interested in more details, give me a call. Pooch: Glad you enjoyed my book on Dad's fishing life, I haven't mentioned much about it on WC, so it wouldn't be construed as advertising. You may have noticed in the book I acknowledged WC readers as being very helpful as reference sources when I inquired about some time gaps several years ago. Now if i can just get registered again."
