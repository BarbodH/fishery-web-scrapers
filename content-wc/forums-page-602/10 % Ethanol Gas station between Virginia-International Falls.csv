I fueled up in International Falls last year and got 15% ethanol fuel(the pumps were not marked so). That fuel really did a number on my 1997 115 Mercury. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated, it would save me from having to stop and look or ask ! BOB"

1044474,Guest,2008-07-22 22:17:00,0,Which station did you find? I fill up in International Falls a couple times a year and don't want ethanol over 10% if I can avoid it.
1044478,Guest,2008-07-22 22:32:00,0,"Fill up at the BP station 1/2 block north of Mcdonalds in I. Falls coming north on hwy. 53. For another marker it is also 1/2 north of the first stoplight. They carry all the normal fuels, regular, silver, and gold, plus non oxy gold with the purpel label. The Non-oxy has no ethanol in it at all it is what I put in all my outboards and small engines. I don't know any other gas station in I. Falls that carries all 4 types of fuel plus diesel. Good Luck"
