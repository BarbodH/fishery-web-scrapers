575854,marcus2,2008-07-07 20:53:00,41,I'm heading up next week. How's the fishing? Can anyone tell me if the water is high or low? Any Mayflies yet? Any tips? Thanks in advance.
575858,Guest,2008-07-08 06:59:00,0,"Although we were upstream of the dam a week ago, I have no reason to believe that fishing will be any different on the Winnipeg below the dam. We were there for 2-1/2 weeks and caught plenty of smallies, northern and musky; and had enough eater walleye that we caught off the bank for a few evening meals. [We didn't fish much for walleye specifically.] Walleye were becoming more active on the banks as we were leaving, you could pick them up with crankbaits, spinners or jigs worked in 8' or water or so. In deeper water, the guys found them in 18-22' with perch colored jigs and leeches or gulp plastics. The water level above the dam is high, and based on the current I suspect it is the same below the dam. (Above the dam it's about 2' higher than last year.) The water is a little murkier than it typically is because of the higher flow, and there are more side eddy's in bays or open areas off the river. Water temp on the river was just breaking 60 degrees when we left. Smallies had already started to spawn in many of the bays and lakes off the river, but had just started migrating toward shorelines on the river when we left. So I suspect you'll find them in various stages of spawn migration below the dam. Smallie spawn migration seemed to be 2 weeks behind last year, and 3-4 weeks behind a typical year. Tubes and small crawfish baits worked on the banks or 'in the slop' were good for plenty of smallies. Big northern seemed to have just begun to move out of the bigger bays toward more open water. Weed growth was pretty sparse this year above the dam, and it was apparent that weather, ice damage and late ice-out had affected them. You'll likely find the same in open areas below the dam. The bigger northern we caught seemed to come on the river itself, or cuts in the shoreline on bigger lakes or areas leading to bays. I'd look for large rocks, boulders and ledges that have some weed growth for the bigger and more actively feeding northern. (Many of our favorite bays were totally void of big northern this year, because of poor weed growth.) Silver/gold Mepps, spinnerbaits and chatter baits worked over/through the weeds seemed to work best for us with northern. Musky were becoming more active throughout the period we were there, and I suspect they will be just as plentiful as last year, once the water warms. Look for weedy areas in saddles, or areas that have large rocks with plenty of forage for more active musky. (They didn't seem to relate as much to the points or weedy shorelines as they have in previous years -- but that may have to do with the movement of forage which was just beginning to move into these areas when we left.) Although we didn't fish for them specifically, we caught 15 nice big ones (>40"") while there this year. Green pumpking tube jigs, mepps and spinnerbaits are what we caught them on. Hope that helps. Have fun! Chuck"

You couldn't even use the boat launch across the bridge it was so low. Maybe we are talking about two different things here."
1044169,Guest,2008-07-21 16:31:00,0,Just was wondering how the trip turned out marcus. Headed up there this fri. Normally have had pretty good luck in high water and looks like its high this year. thanks for any info
1044287,marcus2,2008-07-22 08:27:00,41,"Arrived on the 12th right in the middle of the Mayfly hatch. It made fishing slow and while we caught Walleyes they were mainly small. I've never been up there when the water was this high and they said it was going to go higher. The water was within 18"" of the high water line on the rocks. The shallow water is up in the trees. Shore lunch spots and burnable wood are in short supply. We caught some Smallmouth and lots of small Northerns. The highlight of the trip was a 42"" Northern caught by my 12yr old. I've been fishing for a long time and never caught one that big. We got mixed reports from others in camp. The guided groups did better than most but also felt it was slow at times. By the time we left on the 19th the Mayflies were about finished and fishing should improve. Let us know how you do. Good luck, Marcus"
