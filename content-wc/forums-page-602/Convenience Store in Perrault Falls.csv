1043346,ajbuff,2008-07-17 14:10:00,11,Can anyone give me an idea of the kind of stuff the store in Perrault Falls sells...or if they are even open. We go through Dryden about 0600 and the grocery/liquor stores aren't open. Any help will be appreciated. Tight Lines. AJB
1043400,Guest,2008-07-17 18:32:00,0,Consider it a glorified 7-11/Q-t store. If you Need major shoping>head north 15 mns and hit the grocery store in Ear falls.

Hadn't thought about Ear Falls...kinda get tunnel vision as we get closer to Jim and Julie's and Wabaskang Lake Thanks"
