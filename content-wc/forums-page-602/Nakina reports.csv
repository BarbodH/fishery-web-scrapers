What a fabulous time we had, the weather could have been better but we can't predict that now can we . The water level was up a bit as compared to previous years, and the fishing each year seems to impress me more and more. If you are looking for 27""+ Northerns and 18"" Walleye then look no further. We were even lazy one day and fished from the dock in the afternoon and probably caught 35-40 walleye in a couple of hours. On occasion we even had double headers with two on the lines at the same time. The bugs were plentiful but we came prepared, the hosts were fantastic, and the rates were way lower than the others for the same trip. We found that the savings from our trip offset the high price of gas to travel. We have our trip booked for next year and we are already counting down the days. Check them out at http://www.bracelakeoutfitters.com Brace Lake is in the head waters of the Melchett system if I do recall looking at that on the map."
