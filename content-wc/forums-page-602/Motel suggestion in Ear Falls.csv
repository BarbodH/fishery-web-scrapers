1044389,Guest,2008-07-22 16:22:00,0,Our group is heading for Lac Seul a day early and are in need of a motel in Ear Falls. I was hoping someone could recomend a decent place to stay in Ear Falls. Thanks
1044434,Guest,2008-07-22 18:56:00,0,Try Trillam Motel. Many of the resorts along that side of the lake will also accomidate travelers fo the night.

1044533,Guest,2008-07-23 07:42:00,0,"We have stayed at the Trillium a number of times 807-222-3126. THe Highway 105 Motel would be fine also, but I do not have their phone number."
1044580,Guest,2008-07-23 09:57:00,0,Many new updates to this motel. Great atmosphere and newer accommodations. Best restaurant in Ear Falls.
1044595,Guest,2008-07-23 11:04:00,0,Thanks for the suggestions. It seems the motels in Ear Falls are all booked up. Goose Bay had a cabin available for the night for a reasonable price so we are set.
