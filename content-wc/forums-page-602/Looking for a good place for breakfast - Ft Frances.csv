Once dawn comes there tends to be a backup at the crossing on Saturday mornings and I'd hate to be sitting there in line with an empty stomach and no coffee.

575543,41jims,2008-06-27 16:47:00,30,"Thanks Bob, we have been going through there for 7 years at that time and have had no lines at all."
575587,BOBBYB,2008-06-29 10:02:00,44,Rendezvous opens at 7 AM. In IF the chocolate Moose has good huge breakfast.
576038,Guest,2008-07-14 19:03:00,0,Any other places heading toward Emo(west on 11)?
576044,Mohleye,2008-07-15 07:23:00,368,The Emo Inn has a good restaurant that opens at 6 for breakfast.
576049,Guest,2008-07-15 13:45:00,0,If you can wait until Nestor Falls....Greens has a great breakfast and super ambience
576050,Guest,2008-07-15 14:23:00,0,Is the Emo Inn right on Hwy 11 before the turn toward Nestor Falls? Is there enough room for 2 vehicles and boats?
576062,Mohleye,2008-07-16 07:31:00,368,"Yes to both (or all 6). They have a vey large parking lot, as it is a motel also."

575416,Hammerhead Herb,2008-06-24 09:59:00,259,Will be going through IF/Ft.Frances in the morning. Heading towards Dryden. We usually stop in IF for breakfast before crossing the border. We think we'll cross the border first and then have breakfast in Ft Frances Any recommendations for a decent restaurant that offers a hearty breakfast and STRONG coffee. Sorry to say it but Canada has great beer but the weakest coffee I ever tasted.
575423,Mondo,2008-06-24 11:52:00,61,"Hammer, Try LaRendvous hotel. It's on the far east end of town. Good food, service and coffee that'll open your eyes. Mondo."
575425,Hammerhead Herb,2008-06-24 13:06:00,259,Thanx for the info. Is it on the road heading to 502?
575429,Guest,2008-06-24 14:00:00,0,There is a good place in Ft Francis on 11 East as you are about to leave town. Its right on the curve in town that is next to the water. In the AM you will see all the cars and rigs park on the side of street so you cannot miss it. Great breakfast (cannot speak to the coffee as I drink tea) and next door is the sporting goods store for any last minute needs. Cheers...IA Walleye

It's on the way, and as the previous post said, good food, service, and the coffee is good. Also the bar gets a little nutty on Thursday night.Have a great trip, we did!"

575477,41jims,2008-06-25 13:45:00,30,"Hey, anyone know if any of these places are opened around 4am. We will be going through about that time and would like to stop and eat.Thanks"
575482,Mohleye,2008-06-25 15:02:00,368,I'd venture a guess that the Rendezvous would not be serving breakfast that early.
575493,Guest,2008-06-25 21:34:00,0,"LaRendvous. Right on the water, good breakfast."
