1044342,way2goofy,2008-07-22 13:07:00,22,The camp we stay at in Sioux Narrows has had poor leeches the last 2 years in August. They run about $5 a dozen and a pound of jumbos has 8 to 10 dozen from what I've read. definitely better to get leeches by the pound from a good bait shop.
1044375,Guest,2008-07-22 15:23:00,0,We just came back from Ont. Took a couple of small nets from the kids and caught our own leeches. Worked great
575962,Guest,2008-07-11 14:58:00,0,Anyone know the going rate for leeches in Ear Falls? Four Seasons???
575965,Pooch,2008-07-11 17:43:00,4619,Friend just got back and paid $45 a pound. The owners of that bait shop are sometimes on this board. Last week we paid $36 a pound in Kakebeka Falls. Pooch
575969,Guest,2008-07-11 19:49:00,0,so what say you....4 Seasons? How much are the leeches? What about worms???
575971,walleye54,2008-07-11 21:20:00,8,You can get great leaches and minnows at Evergreen. It is right up the road from 4 Seasons.
575973,Guest,2008-07-11 21:54:00,0,HOW MUCH?
575986,Guest,2008-07-12 18:30:00,0,Started commercially trapping bait 4 years ago; we do have minnows and leeches available.Trap run medium/large minnows are $4/dozen; medium/large brown leeches are $35/lb and large to jumbo trap run black leeches are $42/lb. The business is Pine Tree Bait and Tackle and it is localted here at camp 1 mile east of Ear Falls on 657 (Gold Pines Road).
575987,Guest,2008-07-12 19:55:00,0,"Gary, How is the road over to your bait shop??? We travel in a motor home towing a boat and are reluctant to get off the beaten path. Do we have to call and make arrangements? Do you have worms?"
575991,Hump,2008-07-12 20:30:00,578,"The road is all pavement except when you turn into camp. No problem that I see. I am sure his bait is the best, he runs the camp that way. Hump"
576027,Guest,2008-07-14 11:52:00,0,"Tarmak to our drive and we have a turnaround for you. Usually have minnows, Patty or I are almost always here and there is always help."
