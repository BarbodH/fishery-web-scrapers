After the amazing trip the first week of July I was not expecting to have quite as good of fishing now, but not this slow! Walleyes have been very difficult to come by. Alot of 20"" plus being caught but the numbers of ""eaters"" is just not happening very easily. From what I've seen and experienced you can do one of two things...either put on plastics and go ripping through the weed beds and catch your numbers or go to the reefs on the big lake and vertical jig all day and eeek out 3 or 4 bigger fish above 20"". There are walleyes being caught other areas as well but I'm not seeing alot of numbers by any means. Even the northern are slow in my opinion. I managed a 42"" on Sunday but other than a 38.5"" today, its been pretty tough also. What's happening? I think a few things...mayflies, tons of baitfish, 4 straight days of east winds, and walleyes in the weeds are making things tough. However, we're still frying walleyes every night so I can't complain and i know things will improve any day now!"

1044995,Guest,2008-07-24 21:01:00,0,The lake is definately higher than normal by at least 2 or 3 feet. The falls at Perrault look like a raging river and most of the shorline you cannot see rocks as the water is up to the trees in many places. This is better than low water in my opinion though. Today we had a great day on walleye as the wind swithched to the south and we worked the north shorelines and islands in McCloud bay. Others in camp did good also on walleyes on the big lake in 8-12 feet of water. Tomorrow is our last day unfortunately.
