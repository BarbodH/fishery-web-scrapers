3905698,Whopper,2015-05-26 08:34:00,340,"Went through IF/ FF at 7am on the 15th had one car in front of us. Came back through at 11:30am Sat the 23rd had a truck and boat in front of us, no problems or wait either way . The line coming in on Saturday was lined up past the duty free store on the US side and it looked like they were doing some kind of pre-screening just past the toll both. Watched multiple people unload stuff at the shack that you pick up the duty free purchases."
3906226,J-Man,2015-05-26 10:52:00,191,"All arriving resort guests reporting good experiences at the border. Other than getting turned around for eggs/poultry if they haven't gotten the message about leaving them behind. A few groups reported being searched, but this is part of crossing the borders. No issues after CBSA agents have done their jobs."
3907034,Mark R,2015-05-26 14:28:00,1538,Oddly enough the US side asked about us bring eggs & poultry and fruit back into the US. Going into Canada they didn't ask about it at all. They always seem to want to know when the last time we were in Canada. It should be right there on the computer screen they are looking at. I guess it's a memory test.
3898378,Fisherman Ted,2015-05-23 08:22:00,461,Just wondering what people's experiences are so far this spring at the border. I am not hearing good reports from my fishermen crossing at I-Falls. In fact to a man they have all been pretty annoyed. I have only had maybe 20 guests but every group has been pulled aside for additional questioning and half of those have had cars gone through up and down. Some even have been asked the name of the owner of the lodge they are going to. Not sure how people would even know the owner in most cases. I had one group that had the officer bring up the lodge web-site to see if it was legit. Is there something I haven't read or heard about?
3898530,Trevorkr,2015-05-23 09:42:00,3,We crossed at 4:30 am and had no problem. They asked the standard questions and waved us right through. I can say this was the easiest crossing in the 3 years I've done it.
3898538,Mark R,2015-05-23 09:43:00,1538,Border crossing both ways was no problem
3898778,JIGSTER,2015-05-23 12:17:00,30,Easiest crossing both ways we have had in 29 years!
3898810,NP4ME,2015-05-23 12:25:00,378,"I guess I look at it completely different. Why would anyone be annoyed for the border agents doing their job? If they thoroughly went through every single car that crossed, I don't think that would be a problem. They are trying to keep crap out of their country. I can stand a little inconvenience for them to share the beauty they are trying to protect. I wish to God there was a heck of a lot more of this going on down south..."
3898914,Knoxabilly,2015-05-23 14:13:00,225,No search on the way in or out. Guy on the way out was really into the bad cop routine but surprisingly let us pass
3898962,v-bay gord,2015-05-23 14:46:00,3168,All my guests arriving today had no issues at the border other than a bit of a wait time for one group because of a long line.
3899490,blewslb,2015-05-23 19:49:00,53,"Crossed at 0800 day before opening no issues, paid duty on beer, standard questions. Gone. Came back yesterday no line no issues, gone"
3899506,Rich B,2015-05-23 19:58:00,1081,"My twin brother and 2 friends were up north of Vermilion Bay this week, and had good/quick crossing heading to camp last Friday evening, and a quick return crossing earlier today. Rich B"
3903122,LOW1,2015-05-25 10:07:00,2828,We just got back. Routine and professional both ways. Was specifically asked about eggs when entering Canada.
