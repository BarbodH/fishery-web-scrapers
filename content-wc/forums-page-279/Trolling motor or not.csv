Whenever we can, we take a trolling motor (and the battery and the charger).....and use it a lot...more than trolling unless back trolling. No trolling motor at the fly ins and seem to get by. We do a lot of fishing along shorelines and bays...inlets....rapids. Is it worth the effort of hauling it up? Thanks again."
3898770,larry0418,2015-05-23 12:06:00,16,"No trolling motor is my vote. We fly in and have used 15 and 20hp motors and that is all we need. One time when we drove to a camp, we had an electric motor with us and never used it. It just got beat up taking it back and forth. Another issue is weight. Fly in camps are very strict on weight limits and hauling an electric that is difficult to pack plus the battery weight - not worth it. My 2 cents worth."
3900050,ftfarms,2015-05-24 05:51:00,444,If you use it a lot and your doing a drive to camp why wouldn't you take it. we always used ours. Now I have my own boat and that's all I use to fish with.
3900074,octanehi5,2015-05-24 06:09:00,1104,"if your talking about a fly in, The camps we fly to have 20 hp 16' lunds,sometimes a little fast for trolling, take a drift sock and rig it to slow the boat down when trolling. It works very well and does not add alot of weight to the trip"
3900186,mms3rd,2015-05-24 06:51:00,148,"I guess my point is that we never have a trolling motor on fly ins and seem to get by, but I always want to have it on the drive to and boat ins. But, it's a lot of extra gear to haul...especially if you take two batteries...one in use and one to have on the charger. I always feel like the outboard trolls too fast....maybe I just want to troll too slow. I'll just have my son carry the gear."
3901082,drew59,2015-05-24 14:07:00,87,I always take mine. Boat control is essential to an enjoyable fishing trip. Not being able to troll slow enough or drift properly knowing you could have brought an electric is a prescription for anxiety IMO. With only one or two trips a year why not take it if you own it?
3901242,LoDo,2015-05-24 15:04:00,721,We do a fly in annually and camp has 35hp four strokes. The motor runs all day. No reason for a trolling motor.
3901810,bigwalleye1,2015-05-24 19:00:00,2632,"Flying in, likely not worth the hassle, the space and the weight. Better to bring a drift sock and rope to back troll with the supplied outboard. On a drive to camp, either using a camp boat or bringing your own boat, absolutely. Why not have the equipment you like?"
