3885833,HeHooksHimself,2015-05-19 11:28:00,725,"At least a few times during a typical trip to Canada, we refer to smallies as small eyes, only because it rhymes so well with walleyes and it just seems to flow off the tongue. Of course it is usually followed by I mean small mouth."
3885993,Draco1206,2015-05-19 12:23:00,175,"That's funny because sometimes I do just the opposite. When smallie fishing we occasionally catch a ""wallie"". Or I'll text my son or friends and say I caught 10 smallies and 1 wallie."

3886297,Draco1206,2015-05-19 14:20:00,175,"Thanks, this thread has been mainly all freshwater species so I thought I might extend this to include saltwater species. I'm not real familiar with too many saltwater fish but a couple I can think of are redfish/drum and mahi mahi/dorado/dolphin (the fish, not flipper). Some more freshwater fish I didn't see mentioned (probably because it also gets no respect) is the rock bass, it is sometimes called a ""red eye"" for obvious reasons. Also the freshwater drum is referred to a sheepshead here in Michigan. White bass are sometimes called silver bass. Sunfish are called red ears (again for obvious reasons). Carp, suckers, gar, bowfin, are called rough fish or garbage fish here."

3879305,reconssd,2015-05-17 18:14:00,147,Pike - Slime Rockets - I wish I could take credit for this one. One of the owners from Ghost River Lodge referred to Pike as Slime Rockets.

Some other names of fish I thought of when I was in Alaska the five Pacific salmon each had two names. Coho/silver, chinook/king, sockeye/red, pink/ humpback, and chum/dog. Sometimes the locals called a small salmon that followed the spawners in before it was old enough to spawn a ""Jack"". Also I fished for true ""steelhead"" which is a sea run rainbow trout that lives it's life in saltwater and spawns in freshwater. Burbot had several different names, freshwater cod, lingfish or ling.

It went on long enough that our 2 other boats stopped fishing and drove closer to watch the show. His dad was in the boat with him. When they finally saw the fish his dad said, ""It's just a pike.""

Some people especially Canadians and those from northern states call walleyes, pickerel, yellow pickerel, or pike perch. Crappies are called calico bass and paper mouths. Bluegills, bream etc. what are some of the local names for commonly caught fish that you have heard?"
