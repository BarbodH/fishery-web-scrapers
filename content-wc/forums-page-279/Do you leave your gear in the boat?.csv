3813577,pjshorthorn,2015-04-26 17:24:00,5654,I hope not. I thought the reason for hiring you as a guide was to make sure the boat was loaded and ready to go each morning.
3816145,fergiefish,2015-04-27 10:54:00,197,"I have been to many resorts in the last 30 years and have never taken my gear or finders out of the boat after fishing. Most of the locations we have stayed at were close to the docks where the boats were moored for the evening. I have never had any issue with any camp thefts in the 30 plus years we have been going. I know that I may be tempting fate, but I can lock up my rods if necessary, and I am a trusting fool at heart."
3888785,emma17,2015-05-20 09:13:00,436,"Like many on this subject, I've always left my gear on the boat overnight. I was up in northern WI this weekend and left 6 rods n reels in the boat (took my tackle bag up as rain was in the forecast). I came down the next morning and my first thought was, wow- we did a nice job cleaning the boat last night. And then it hit me, everything was gone but one pole. They took 5 rigs- and were kind enough to leave me one. I can't relate with the mindset of someone that would actually do such a thing. All I can do is hope their situation in life improves."
3888833,NAV165,2015-05-20 09:35:00,412,"I'm curious where this theft occurred? Were you at a resort or hotel? I leave stuff in my boat, tied to the dock all the time, even leave stuff sitting on the dock and haven't had anything stolen, YET !! This makes me wonder if I should haul up to the cottage every night. At any rate, that really sucks, I sure hope you find out who took them and perhaps offer to let them take a long walk on your short pier with your anchor tied to their leg!"
3888921,emma17,2015-05-20 09:57:00,436,"That would be an interesting thread- punishment ideas for people that steal fishing gear! It happened at a resort/hotel in Vilas County, WI. I've stayed at this place literally dozens of times over that last 8 years and never had anything missing, not even minnows. I hesitate to identify exactly where as I don't want them to suffer negative PR, as you can imagine it wasn't their fault and they feel horrible that it happened. I did let the police know- they said it happens more frequently than they care to admit. They will check pawn shops but not much else they can do. The thieves did leave my newly purchased anchor as well as the one pole, for that I am thankful."
3899834,Bugler,2015-05-24 00:28:00,1778,"I have not yet had the pleasure to fish in Canada so my response is to local practice. Several years ago, I purchased new rods for a trip to Brainard, MN. After returning home, the rods were stolen off my boat that was moored in a slip at a marina, behind locked gates. One of my dock mates more than likely stole the gear. Now that I am configuring a new Lund, everything is lockable or removable. It is the reason I purchased the quick release plate for my trolling motor as well. I hard wired in my battery charger with a plug in outlet just so I can keep the rod locker locked while charging the battery."
3903074,Ogoki,2015-05-25 09:59:00,291,"38 fly in trips for me and never a stolen item. That being said we were at single cabin outposts , other than Mattice's camp at Ogoki Res. and never a problem there either."
3903146,v-bay gord,2015-05-25 10:25:00,3168,"23 years in business and never had a guest say they had something taken out of their boat. If you're going somewhere that you consider unsafe you may want to ask yourself ""why"" ?"
3903242,Further North,2015-05-25 11:26:00,2008,"That's what I was thinking. Last year I fished with ""that guy"" who picked up his 4 rods, corrugated box and bucket full of lures and hauled them back to the cabin each night. Took him forever to get his crap together in the AM. It was funny because there were probably 10 other boats there, all left their stuff in the boats all night...and let's just say that his equipment wasn't going to attract attention if anyone did decide to steal stuff. He also didn't help clean up the boat at the end of the day...and at the end of the first day of fishing...he took his stuff, left me to clean the boat, and went back to the cabin. ""OK"", I thought, ""He's going to fix dinner!"" He did. He fixed dinner for himself. He won't be going with me again..."
3904602,Bugler,2015-05-25 20:38:00,1778,"I was a prosecutor for 14 years. I can tell you there is no place safe when it comes to crime, despite perceptions. I have seen folks you would never imagine, commit crimes of opportunity when they think no one is looking or when they have had too much to drink. I also had a lot of victims later tell me that they never reported prior crimes against them because they felt stupid for making it so easy for the criminal."
3769809,johnboat,2015-04-15 11:12:00,2014,I leave everything in. Actually left a fishing buddy there for most of the night once!!.
3770049,MrSimon,2015-04-15 11:44:00,922,"I take one tackle bag and two or three rods out in the boat with me. That's it. So it's easy enough to just carry them back and forth to the cabin .... keeps everything dry and safe .... plus, I keep other things in my bag like sunglasses, medicine, camera, snacks, etc which I like to have with me in the cabin. Other stuff like nets, stringers, batteries, electronics all stay in boat."
3774345,bkw67,2015-04-16 14:48:00,70,"In Canada, I have exclusively done Fly-ins to private lakes. So everything stays in the boat. I usually put a plastic bag upside down on the finder, but never thought twice about anything else in the boat."
3782785,reconssd,2015-04-19 07:12:00,147,"Great post and all of the replies have been interesting. We take everything back up to the cabin. There's too much money in rods, reels, and lures sitting in the boat to leave them unattended. We even take our nets back up to the cabin."
3782833,pjshorthorn,2015-04-19 07:26:00,5654,"Depends on the situation. Last year I brought evrything back to the cabin each evening as the dock was quite a distance from the cabin, out of sight and it was a new camp experience for myself. In years past at a familiar location I've left rods in the boat overnight.Tackle bag always makes it into the cabin. Just don't want to spend time drying things out if there was heavy rain or a big blow overnight that would throw a lot of water spray into the boat while tied up at the dock or on the beach. Stood on the deck of our cabin a few years ago at Lac Seul Outposts watching the camp hands tryng to bring the camp boats further up on the beach during a storm with high winds. Literally watched boats blown off the beach and heading north up Chamberlain narrows. I was glad my gear was in the cabin that evening. PjShorthorn"
3787601,worthsr,2015-04-20 11:20:00,52,"SinOrSwim, I made a harness for my portable locator and connect it to the boat battery every year. Alligator clips weren't reliable enough so I bought the circle connectors and slide them over the battery posts and under the wing nuts. I also added an in-line fuse and male connectors to the other end that plug in just like a 12 volt battery would. I doesn't take long, and it works like a charm."
3793401,Aspencreek,2015-04-21 13:42:00,2911,"I tried to leave a ""newbie"" on an island. The one day I forgot to wear my ""walleye Central"" sweatshirt with ""shut up and fish"" on the back, I pulled the short straw and got this guy with me for the day. The 4th time he had to be pulled up to an island to do ""his business"" that was IT. He jumped out and ran into the bush, I pulled out and fished around the entire island. About 30 min later he was standing on shore getting eaten alive by bugs, it was a quiet rest of the day."
3793585,Golden Eagle,2015-04-21 14:18:00,2642,"My fishing gear and rainwear have never been in a cabin and I've fished a lot, for 55 years in Ontario."
3807169,P&y only,2015-04-24 15:39:00,133,55 years? I would love to see your list of top 5 places.!
3813105,BreezyPoint,2015-04-26 14:37:00,1581,"Does that mean I'll have to wait for you each morning? LOL. I never take my stuff back to the cabin, except for camera and cooler (when I'm in Canada). Been doing it that way for over 50 years of trips.Frank"
3766866,youngknight,2015-04-14 17:27:00,228,"I Agee Adam. Brought everything out of the boat each nite last year at a remote outpost...no one within 20 miles...but rain, threat of rain or even risk of rain...reel/rods got put under a shelter, tackle brought inside and cases opened up to air out."
3767537,1/4 oz Jig,2015-04-14 20:05:00,90,I always leave our gear in the boats overnight. I have a wet bag that keeps clothes dry that we keep in the bow storage. If I know there's a good chance for rain I will carry up the tackle bag so it doesn't fill with water. The rods stay no matter what. Just curious what difference does it make if your rod and reel get wet? Your line is wet when you reel it in and if you fish in the rain it all gets wet anyways.
3767665,Nimstug,2015-04-14 20:22:00,2605,I go to a boat in lodge and have always left the stuff in the boat unless there is rain in the forecast. What can't get tucked away comes up to the cabin.
3767689,Baseline,2015-04-14 20:29:00,3207,"When I fish Canada I fish remote drive to lakes and usually the only people up there are fisherman. When I stay at resorts there is usually a controlled entrance and the only people around the docks are other guests. We always leave most gear in the boat, but usually cover all tackle boxes for weather proofing. I have only lost one jig box due to theft when I was fishing the US side of Rainy Lake. The theft occurred when we stopped at a resort for lunch and I tied up at the restaurant dock."
3767969,Aspencreek,2015-04-14 22:11:00,2911,"I was waiting for someone to bring up the ""wet gear"". I really hope you are referring to jackets, hats, clothes, etc and not your fishing tackle. That stuff is supposed to get wet!"
3768505,Freytown,2015-04-15 06:33:00,770,I never take my fishing gear out at night and never had an issue. Like many have said it depends on your location. I fish the Gouin at Pourvoirie La Pointe aux Dorés...no problems here ever.
3768617,SinOrSwim,2015-04-15 07:05:00,1528,I was curious about that. Those motors do have alternators and charge the battery while running? I would hate to end up with a dead motor battery because of a fish finder. I'm not sure they have a pull start option on there?I suppose if I have my 12 volt battery with me that I typically use to run my fish finder that could be my back up. Just need some leads to start I guess? Only time motor isn't running is at lunch. Could just unhook it.
3768689,prov1800,2015-04-15 07:22:00,5010,"I have a seperate power supply for my hds8.if i guide out of other boats i have pretty long power supply cords to get to a power supply.in my boat my unit is on all day, without my motor runningand it never dies.but if it did all those motors can be pull started and i have done it.just need to remive the hood and inside that hood should be a pull cord.but wouldn't count in it being there in a camp boat haha.i have ysed the rope from a minniw bucket.just need to take the cover of where the flywheel is and wrap the rope around it there is a groove where the knot from the rope fits in.there are safety swithes in the tiller handle and if that goes you wont be able to use the electric starter.but it will start by pull starting it.good thing to know and practise once just in case you break down at the other end of the lake.camp owners should go over these situations with there guests on big lakes but they don't. Good luck this year."
3768921,adempsey,2015-04-15 08:01:00,963,"No, I don't like wet gear. Who wants to hold onto a wet cork handle first thing in the morning?!? Lol.Lures etc. sitting in water will obviously rust. Unpainted lead oxidizes as well. That still happens to me on occasion no matter what I do. Inevitably something like pliers will be left out as well. Less likely to happen if I pack it all up and bring it in at night.Of course your rods and reels can get wet. I am sure we all fish in the rain. My tackle bag has been soaked on many occasions. I just prefer not having my reel sit in a puddle of water if I can help it. As far as I am concerned, nothing good will come out of getting something soaking wet on a regular basis."
3769177,SinOrSwim,2015-04-15 08:45:00,1528,"Good point. I should really take the cover off and look just in case anyway. Their camp fish finders run off those batteries. I think I will take a cord with me this year with some alligator clips. I will also take the cover off and make sure there is a pull cord too. Plus, we typically all fish in the same area anyway. Some guys don't have GPS so they always stick with those of us who do. I'm familiar enough with the areas we go now I could get back without it though I think..............famous last words. LOL"
3757417,P&y only,2015-04-12 07:55:00,133,I was gonna ask how one gets their wife stolen. That could be some handy information to have. LOL
3757713,pikeman14,2015-04-12 09:29:00,144,I just feel that you most likely spent too much money on your gear to leave it out. What's a fishing trip without a pole and tackle. I've seen others have theirs taken and felt horrible for them. I believe you should never touch a man's tackle or hand tools without permission.
3757993,retire55,2015-04-12 11:00:00,1029,"I've been running a Lowrance HDS7 for the last 4 years at remote outpost camps. I've been using a 51 amp hour Gel cell deep cycle battery (38 pounds) to power my HDS7. The battery stays in the boat all week. While I have always had a smaller battery (31 amp hours) at the cabin as back up, I've never had to use it yet. The back up battery also powers my electric filleting knife."

3758945,IL John,2015-04-12 17:13:00,45,"In the early 90's we had a pole stolen out of the boat on Eagle. It really stunk for my brother it was the only pike set up he brought, it was the second night of the trip. We left the camp and never returned."
3759825,Aspencreek,2015-04-12 20:51:00,2911,"I leave all of my rods in the boats, along with my tackle bags, and have never had a problem. I put my tackle bags in the floor compartments, but the rods/reels and PFD's are in the boat and on the seat backs. Of course ALL of my gear is fully insured with a specific rider.The one and only year I took my brother-in -law along he was bound and determined to haul all of his stuff back and forth to the cabin every night. And of course we were always waiting on him. Why he felt the need to keep his stuff from walking away was beyond me, it was all junk and was better off if it did. One morning after hauling it all down he had to run back and hit the head, I took all of his gear and put it back on the porch of the cabin. We were a good 15 min heading to our first spot when he noticed all his stuff was missing, the look on his face was priceless. But I told him he was going to use my gear today. Moral of the story...his stuff never made it back to the boat the rest of the week, and we both had a lot more room in the boat."
3766033,rockape,2015-04-14 13:19:00,215,"We have always left our gear in the boat. Expensive gear too. I've always thought about how bad it would suck if someone did take it since there is no place up there to get good new gear in a pinch. Our group looks like a football team so we figure nobody in camp would dare to try and snag our stuff. Now my dad on the other hand, he either locks it up or brings it in the cabin. He is that slow guy that is described above by others!"

Next time we went to the nursing home I asked great grandma if she remembered cooking pot roast and cutting the ends off. Yes, of course, she said. Why do you do that, I asked. Well, my pan was too small."

3755737,jigstop,2015-04-11 15:51:00,631,"Been to Canada many times and never took anything out of the boat and never had an issue. The only problem I ever had was at Leech Lake, went to the boats one morning and all the rods were cleaned out of all 5 of our boats. Around 100 top end combos, about half were actually either prototypes or not on the market yet. Lodge owner said he'd never heard of it happening before but when the Sheriff got there he said he has to come out to one lodge or another at least every week for the exact same thing. Off the record he said he was quite sure they were already on the reservation where they would be shipped to other people on other reservations around the country to be fenced or sold in other ways."

If I were not comfortable, I'd find another camp.Once had some rods broken that were not in the rod locker, but I'm pretty sure it was camps dogs scrounging during the night.Long time ago someone stole my wife and my life jackets that were setting on the cabin porch while we waited for the group leaving to clear out the cabin while we ate breakfast. Pretty sure I knew where they went, but could never prove it so just dropped it.Interesting question though.Pooch"

Too many crankbaits in that box to risk. Graph stays on the dash, but I am thinking about locknuts to secure that. Only had one problem at a lodge in northern MB when gas was stolen from my boat while on the trailer in front of the cabin right before we left. Lodge owner could not have cared less.

I have heard of it happening but not by any other fisherman at the camps I was at. I cover my electronics sometimes, grab the cooler, and pickup the trash and bait containers everything else stays in the boat. One thing I do is fold my seats down and bring a dry rag to wipe off the dew so my butt isn't wet first thing in the morning. I keep my boat fenders in a bucket on the dock secured if it is windy and then use that bucket to bring the eaters up to the fish house.

I have an older gps/finder wiht an external gps puck so maybe it goes through power faster? Not sure? BUt, i have a battery connected plus a spare. So, I'm carrying two batteries to the cabin each night charging and taking back int eh am and hooking up.
