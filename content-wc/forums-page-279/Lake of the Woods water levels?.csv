3903378,downriverbob,2015-05-25 13:05:00,880,"Geoff, I talked to the owners of the resort we go to, the lake levels are significantly lower then last year, and lower overall. That might change if they release water from the dam or have any amount of rainfall. I changed the dates that we are going this year, will be up there June 29-July 8. I do fish down in the area you are staying so if you see a black Lund Pro-V swing by and say hi. Bob"
3903578,Guest,2015-05-25 14:28:00,0,Check out the website of the lake of the woods control board. Lots of data.
3903602,hdefjunkie,2015-05-25 14:37:00,10,Current radar maps show lots of precip. south of the lake so hopefully this will improve the low lake level.

I checked in with the folks at Whitefish Bay Resort today, they said the lake is up about 8"" from where it was when they got in at the beginning of the month. What a huge difference over last year!"

3905522,deadhead1,2015-05-26 07:41:00,193,I would agree with one foot below normal but way better than it was. I would say on NE end of LOW water is up close to a foot from ice out time. We need one more good rain.
