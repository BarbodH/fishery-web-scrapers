We generally parked the boat close to shore and threw our jigs out in the deep and worked them up the drop offs. Worked well for us then. What are most of you guys doing on lac Seul for walleye this time of year, vertical or horizontal presentation? I guess part of me has always enjoyed working the baits horizontally. I love casting past the past the spot and working the jig through the honey hole. Just a little more enjoyable for me vs. jigging a bait directly below the boat, but I'm always willing to catch more depending on what works better!"

Spring fishing on Lac Seul found me making the boat ride to MacKenzie Bay most days. I prefer horizontal but do both. Enjoy! Late Aug for me this year. Have never fished late Aug. Our group is late May, early spring fisherman, however we took a vote to switch it up. Perhaps less numbers in Aug, but bigger fish. We'll see!"

I will also anchor out in deper water and cast onto the flat and then jig it back off the drop. Sometimes the only presentation fish will want is vertical so I guess I adapt as necessary. Last year I caught my personal best northern ( 44"") casting up onto a flat and jigging it back to the boat while anchored in 40 fow. The jig never made it more than 10 feet before the strike. She was cruising that ledge. The next night my son caught his personal best walleye ( shade over 28"" ) vertical jigging in the same exact spot while anchored. PjShorthorn"
