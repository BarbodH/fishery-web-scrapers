Next day 3 inches of snow we went out after snow and caught a few to eat. After that typical post cold front conditions. I suspect by now things have stabilized

Of course you have Lac Suel out your back door. As for the current fishing it is really picking up with the weather and the hot bite is on according to my resident friend. tight lines no net
