This official publication implies that you may not, but I have found that a Canadian crossing is inconsistent at best, however coming back to the US can be MORE restrictive. http://cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/...9-13-2-eng.pdf"
3829641,1K1MOA,2015-05-01 08:41:00,90,"The important part if you use one is NOT to put it behind the bear, that could scare him and cause it to run towards you. Think like it is a mortar round and put the angle high enough to have it go off between you and the bear so the bear turns and runs away. The guy doing the demo in the video link you posted had no angle, it would have been behind a bear going off, not good. To his defense though, he was just showing how it worked, not how to deploy it in a real scenario."

I get up there and just mention to the owner that I purchased some bear bangers, just in case. He looks at me and says: well, actually (of all the outposts he has) the one location I am going to has had a problem bear! Apparently, the bear has been breaking in and chewing on the gas can caps. never heard of that one before. I was scheduled to open up the hunters shack for the season. When the pilot dropped me off, the first thing I saw was that the bear had ripped all the screens out. I was, shall we say, for lack of a better word: VIGILANT the rest of the trip. Did NOT see a bear, but did see a moose. That being said, the owner and I tried the bear bangers and a flare before I flew out and they work great. Highly recommended, BUT dangerous around kids and teenagers who love to do ""science experiments"" if you know what I mean. Now, I'm going to do another post because I had to clean up a huge amount of mouse droppings and I did get sick and am wondering if they were deer mice and the associated possibility of Hantavirus. I'll post a photo. And yes, it was beautiful, the fish were biting and I didn't get rained on and no texts, email,etc. Thanks for all your advice."
3907434,Mike Borger,2015-05-26 16:42:00,1554,"Glad your trip went well!For what it's worth bears LOVE chewing on gas cans, I've seen it countless times!!No explanation why other than they like to unwind by huffing a little gas."
3907730,Skywagon,2015-05-26 18:06:00,1106,"I have had 5 separate bear sightings in less than a week. Now is always the time of the year they are most visible. Was talking to a local native gal yesterday, last weekend she had a bear coming up the stairway to her cabin, said she talked to the bear and it went away. She is a member of the bear clan, said she could not guarantee it would work for everybody. Would suggest unless your outfitter is a member of the Winchester clan, to keep the outside of your camp clear of grease, garbage, fish guts and use common sense around a mother bear with cubs. There have been a few incidents with bear in the past couple of years, but they are not all that common."
3907874,rnnonmt,2015-05-26 19:08:00,992,"Bells and Whistles..... LOL The National Park Rangers are advising hikers in Glacier National Park and other Rocky Mountain parks to be alert for bears and take extra precautions to avoid an encounter.They advise park visitors to wear little bells on their clothes so they make noise when hiking. The bell noise allows bears to hear them coming from a distance and not be startled by a hiker accidentally sneaking up on them. This might cause a bear to charge.Visitors should also carry a pepper spray can just in case a bear is encountered. Spraying the pepper into the air will irritate the bear's sensitive nose and it will run away.It is also a good idea to keep an eye out for fresh bear scat so you have an idea if bears are in the area. People should be able to recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear scat.Black bear droppings are smaller and often contain berries, leaves, and possibly bits of fur. Grizzly bear droppings tend to contain small bells and smell of pepper."

3817745,fishron,2015-04-27 17:02:00,317,Years ago my brother and I took a large group of boy scouts on a canoe trip through Algonquin park in Ontario. I remember seeing bears on our approach to various campsites but the one that stands out was at the end of our trip in an established camping area prior to our traveling home. We were cautioned by park police to leave no food about and pretty much told the scouts to stay in group or take to their tents for the night. My brother and I walked the food garbage to the dump area and a ranger pulled up at the dump and began firing a large caliber hand gun at a bear. I remember seeing him walk up to said bear and jump back and put another round into the bear. They apparently took campsite bears very seriously. I've seen black bears on various occasions and never felt threatened but carrying a quality bear repellent seems to be the smart thing.
3818257,castnblast,2015-04-27 18:45:00,111,good advice right there... Have a great solo trip!
3818489,pitbull,2015-04-27 19:35:00,45,"Check on the Regulations for Entry to Canada with Bear Spray, I think it is illegal to do so. We had bear problems one year as the people who left the camp when we came in obviously had been feeding them. We weren't done unpacking when it came in and crunched Ice chest that had had frozen meat. It ignored us yelling/banging till it left. It didn't go far, damaged the Grill even after burning it off, through the night my son woke up thinking I was having a breathing Issue and then figured out it was the bear outside beside him with 1/2in plywood separating them!! I can't get him to go back to Canada since. He would hunt Bear in PA WITH GUN! The only thing I had was Wasp Spray which I sprayed around door and tied Hunting knife around broom handle if it would have came in cabin? Can you SKIN A GRIZ Pilgrim!"
3818673,[emailÂ protected],2015-04-27 20:02:00,21,"You are not allowed to take personal defense type ""Pepper Spray"", but you are allowed to take ""Bear Spray"" across the border. I would only use it as a very last resort as you make just make the bear mad. Best thing is to keep a clean camp! Clean fish away from the camp, and boat the cleaning scraps across the lake. I have done wilderness canoe trips and fly in fishing trips for many years, and only ever once had a bear bother me. I gave it space and it gave me space, eventually leaving. I had bear spray on me but did not use it because it did not threaten me. I don't want to understate it, but don't get hung up on this. Statics of ""Black Bear"" attacks in Ontario are literally only a handful over years and years. 99.9% of the time they will run as soon as they see you. Again....keep a clean camp. Also, don't set food in front of the open window at a cabin. If you are canoe packing, ""Always"" hang your food pack from a tree. A can air horn will work on the same bear that will run from you anyhow. If it is one that has been getting food where you are it won't phase him other than make him go about 50 -100 ' away, then he will come back. I have done more than a thousand miles canoe tripping and seen as many as 13 bear on one trip. Have a good time."
3819353,Guest,2015-04-28 05:26:00,0,The only problem with bear spray is the wind. You have to hope that the bear does not come at you from up wind.
3819489,Phil T,2015-04-28 05:55:00,4820,"As stated before, no personal pepper spray or mace. They are considered concealable weapons. Bear spray is not only welcome, it is encouraged. The big can isn't considered concealable. Just be sure the word ""bear"" appears somewhere on the can."
3824697,Guest,2015-04-29 12:19:00,0,"My advice is tie Bear Bells on all the bears , That way you can hear them coming. Good advice on the Bear Spray If Needed shoot it in your own eyes , It will redirect the pain from the mauling your going to receive."
3825433,1K1MOA,2015-04-29 17:31:00,90,"I am now 55 and also have done numerous solo trips in black bear country and am flying in north of Ogoki lake solo in early July. I will be base camping in a moose camp and also hiking with a pack raft to fish surrounding lakes. I carry bear spray as well as bear bangers and flares. The banger/flare kit I have includes six flares and six bangers with a thumb launcher. It is a pouch about 7"" wide by 3"" tall by 2"" thick and fits on my belt. I am guessing it weighs 8 ounces. The kit is made by TruFlare, out of Colorado I believe, and can be ordered online. Another thing you should declare to the pilot who is flying you in. Despite the numerous solo trips in the UP of MI and Ontario, I have never had a need to use them. My scariest encounter was waking up in a tent in northern MN to a ""snorting"" sound two feet from my head on the other side of the tent wall. I got up, unzipped the tent and heard something big run about 30 feet. I hit it with my flashlight and saw a black bear about 100 pounds looking at me. As soon as I yelled it couldn't run away fast enough. Needless to say that was it for sleep that night and I moved my camp the next day. The real danger of that episode was my heart giving out since it had to be beating over 200BPM. Yes, it scared me big time! Having hard walls of a cabin is a nice luxury when trying to sleep in bear country. When I am in a tent, I now setup a fishing line tripwire with a buzzer for tip-up fishing that goes off if something comes into camp. Enjoy your trip!"
3829561,schoolofhardknocks,2015-05-01 08:11:00,29,That is SO helpful. I hadn't been aware of that source. Here is the youtube demo. This seems like a great alternative to a gun:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcjlxUt9AZA
3815681,schoolofhardknocks,2015-04-27 08:59:00,29,"Hi, Go ahead...laugh, but I thought I would ask anyway. I've been doing fly-ins for 30 years and haven't had an issue with bears in Ontario, but this time I am going solo, being flown in and left for a week with just a shack very early in season in two weeks. Should I bring a shotgun or rifle or am I being overly cautious. Normally, I have NO concern, but this is a bit different."
3815705,REG,2015-04-27 09:11:00,445,We've been seeing a lot more bears since Ontario did away with their Spring hunting a number of years back (maybe that's changed) but they seem to be pretty shy around people. However - I'd keep your camp clean - especially with your fish guts. I'd take them by boat away from camp. No need for firearms.
3815977,7 Mag,2015-04-27 10:19:00,1887,"I'm not sure if you can transport bear spray but that's what I would take with me, It's not like you can take a hand gun into Canada which would be my first choice. Black bears in particular can be shy however if one does decide to attack it means business not like a grizzly which attacks until it feels the threat is no longer."
3816105,schoolofhardknocks,2015-04-27 10:42:00,29,"HI again..thanks for responses. I'd like to re-cap: I am experienced, but not a hunter ( am am a fisherman). I have bear spray and understand the nature of the black bear quite well. Yes, they almost always can be shy and scared off, but this is early Spring, on a river and I won't have a cabin as much as an old shack and I am alone. When they don't back off, they mean business! Handguns may NOT be brought into Canada. I am weighing whether or not it is worth the hassle at the border to bring in a shotgun or rifle to make what is usually an easy crossing into a difficult one. I always appreciate everyone's thoughts unless they are (as my kids say) ""haters."" By the way I am 65 years old now hey who know s how many years I can do this experience which to me (Ontario fly-ins) the BEST place for me to be on vacation."
3816465,youngknight,2015-04-27 11:51:00,228,"I live in Ontario in bear country. I understand your concern. Two suggestions.1. Bring some bear spray, if you are flying in be absolutely sure you tell the pilot so he stores it appropriately - depending on the aircraft, usually in the pontoon storage.2. Take one of those air horn cannisters. Doesn't hurt anyone but if you got a bear nosing around in the middle of the night, it will scare 99% of them off.Are these really required? No. People tent in bear country all the time. However, a little bit of insurance for peace of mind. Don't bother with the firearms - more hassle, weight than they are worth. Like others have said, keep a clean camp including fish guts...I put mine in a camp bucket and motor out to the middle of the lake and dump them there. You are completely solo - so make a bit of noise before going outside or up to the outhouse - you don't want to surprise a bear. So, if they aren't surprised, have nothing to get into (eat) and you got some pepper spray and an air horn - not only you should not have any problems, you should be more at ease. After all you are on vacation.Living and working in bear country, yes black bears typically run off - however, both myself and some peers have had incidences where the bear did NOT do the expected thing, so some sort of ""defense"" is not a silly thing."
3816481,Mike Kansas,2015-04-27 11:55:00,1463,If there is a guy in your party that you dislike tie a Pork Chop around his neck!!!
3816489,youngknight,2015-04-27 11:59:00,228,The OP said he is going solo so the only neck to tie a pork chopo around is his own.
3816657,smallcal,2015-04-27 12:50:00,119,"I would agree with the suggestions. You did not say if you are familiar with using firearms but in general if you are not a hunter or have never been trained to use a firearm in self defense, I'd stick with the air horn and bear spray. Using a firearm without experience and/or training can be worse than not having one at all.Keep everything clean, especially yourself, pack oils in sealed containers nightly, etc. to avoid giving a bear a reason to come check out the camp. As always, just my opinion."
3816761,Bill Krejca,2015-04-27 13:21:00,6107,"All good suggestions. As it reads like you will be staying in a somewhat ""rustic"" structure, may I add that additional protection from creatures will be achieved by bringing insect rings to burn and mouse traps and Decon. Bill"
3816777,Washington Walleye,2015-04-27 13:24:00,366,"I have quite a bit of experience backpacking solo in the Pacific Northwest right smack in the middle of black bear country. Leave the shotgun at home. What everyone is saying about keeping a clean camp is key to limiting any unwanted visitors. I generally hang every single thing that I have with me that has odor (including my toothbrush and toothpaste) in a tree (about 10' high and 4' away from the trunk). There's lots of videos online if you've never hung a bear bag before. Although I have met people on the trail that have been backpacking for years in bear country and never took the time. Then, as others have mentioned... not surprising a bear is the other key element. Heading off into the woods for nature's call? Call out around blind corners, etc. They have poor eyesight but good hearing and smell. In the last 24 years or so I've only had one up close encounter and it was a non-event. I came around a blind corner, saw the bear and just started talking to him a calm voice. He looked at me like I was nothing and casually walked off trail to get around me and then back on the trail in the direction that I had just come from. Grizzlys are a different story, but I don't believe that you'll be in grizzly territory (look it up if you're not sure)."
