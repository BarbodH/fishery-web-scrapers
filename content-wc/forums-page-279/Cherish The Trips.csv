Send me a PM if things work out and we would be happy to get you on the water. I might have to buy the chicken up there this year though! all the best and I hope things work out you have already had a handful these past 12 months. Andy"
3898194,ziggyzag,2015-05-23 07:02:00,125,Our family has been going to Canada for over 35 years and every trip has its own special memories. I would also like to thank my Dad and Uncles for starting this tradition and for showing us the way. Now as my Dad is getting to the point in life that his health will no longer permit him to travel to the back country fishing one of his holding on points are the trips we have taken. See his mind is still clear and just about all our conversations lead back to one of our trips to Canada fishing and ends with him saying MAN I WISH I COULD JUST GO ONE MORE TIME!! me to DAD

3898650,Pikeslayer8,2015-05-23 10:44:00,1460,"Over the years, I've been finding old fishing pictures in some of the dangest places. I've benn scanning pictures lately and have discovered old pics I forgot I had. I found my old honeymoon trip pictures and the trip I took with my wife, mother and sisters. I found the only picture of my biggest pike. Cherish them!"
3889617,Andyeye,2015-05-20 13:28:00,179,"I was looking at some old pictures last night of the last trip my dad got to go to Canada with us before he passed. He caught a big 20+lbs northern sitting in the bottom of his old Lund Pike trying to stay out of the wind. He passed away the next spring and I remember him saying he wished he could go fishing in Canada one more time. I'm realizing that I'm getting older now too and have a lot more trips behind me than ahead of me. I have had fantastic trips and some no so great but all were me doing what I love and spending times with family, old friends, and friends I just made on that particular trip. With the new season upon us here's wishing everyone the best this year. Everyone be safe, have fun, and enjoy the time."
3889657,Bakefish,2015-05-20 13:41:00,1077,"Andy, I know what you're talking about. In the bathroom down in my basement I have a picture that I look at every time I use the facilities. It's from the 80's and has several photos in the frame. Almost everyone in the photos is gone. It's kind of a mixed feeling looking at these pics. On one hand I remember the happy times the instant the pictures were taken. On the other hand I feel sadness at the loss of some really good guys, knowing that those times can never be recaptured. Treasure your trips indeed."
3889745,stumcfar,2015-05-20 14:03:00,451,"Go with your buddies as long as you and they can and take your kids as soon as they can. This will be my 24th trip to Canada. The guys who go with have changed some over the years, but a lot of great memories. This will be my sons 5th trip. I just hope he is still taking me with in 24 years when I am in my 70's! Have a great summer and great trips everyone. Cherish them!"
3889833,Carnhzkr,2015-05-20 14:33:00,964,"My dad's favorite fishing spot is known as Caribou Falls on the English River north of Minaki. We've been going to that spot, on and off, since the mid-60s. Each year, my dad thinks this will be his last. If I had a dollar for every time I watched him stand on the bank looking over the river and say ""goodbye Caribou Falls"" as we're packing to leave for home I could retire tomorrow. He's now 85 - can barely hear, has a leaking heart valve, and can hardly walk, but he, my mom, sister, and nephew will be crossing the border in three weeks. Each year, I try to convince mom and dad to leave the camper at home at stay in a lodge with electricity, a shower, a dock, and a fish cleaning house, but he wants none of that. If he's still breathing in September, I'll drag his stubborn butt and his rig up yet once again so I can hear him say ""goodbye Caribou Falls"". My favorite pictures are of the two of us holding up doubles of 27s. Got a couple of those pics."

3891297,btyreprich,2015-05-21 04:08:00,1067,"I know what you mean about looking at old fishingtrip photos to relive memories. For me, it brings back fond memories of a close friend we lost to leukemia. The fun part of the trips for us start the week we get our gear ready & buy groceries. The hours spent in the car driving up to International Falls and the next day to Ontario give our group a chance to visit and talk about past trips. We used to drive straight through to our lodge. We now spend the night in Int Falls as this gives us a chance to relax and spend time together. The best memories happen on the lake, but there are other enjoyable moments to be had if you are part of a close group. I am very blessed to have this."
3892057,MrSimon,2015-05-21 07:26:00,922,"I've been on all kinds of vacations with all different kinds of people .... but there is just something special about a fishing trip to Canada. My grandfather started taking me to Canada when I was a boy many years ago. He died last November at the age of 86. We sat in his hospice room a week before he died talking and laughing over the memories and looking at old snapshots of the adventures. Even at the very end, those memories brought him joy."
3892721,bigwalleye1,2015-05-21 10:11:00,2632,"GREAT thread. I've been smiling all morning. My Dad's been doing a second trip with me for a good number of years, and I get these off the wall phone calls out of the blue in, like, NOVEMBER, ""Hey, why don't we try this, or fish that bay next year,"" or ""remember this place? We need to go there again"". While I'm going first trip in a month, and he's not going unitl second trip in July, I saw him last week and played the ""deliverance"" theme song on him. May as well, he's wound tighter than a banjo string.... He's 76 this year, and I hope he sees many many more Canadian sunrises."
3897153,mbay1455,2015-05-22 18:14:00,25,"My wife and I have been married 37 years and have gone to northern Ontario almost every other year with her Dad, Mother and brothers since our first year together. Her dad's been going since he was a kid. Her brother is a paraplegic and a stellar fisherman and we have figured out how to manage, even doing very rustic camping in days gone by. Those trips have defined and strengthened our family like nothing else. In the old days it was the ruggedness of the trips and the exploring we would do, always trying to get up a small creek or rivulet to get to another 'virgin' body of water. The Canada trips are always what we talk about when we get together. My daughters have gone a few times and the last time we added a son-in-law. On his first day, he caught a bigger walleye than any of us had ever seen before, let alone caught. Now her mother's gone, we're all older and this year her dad turned 88 and wants to make one more trip. His eyesight and hearing are both just about gone but he insists he wants to drive his boat one more time. With an abundance of caution we're going to figure out how to do that if we have a good weather day. We're going the 1st week of August and while I don't exactly know how it will work out I can see him now, hand on the tiller, trolling for lake trout at a snail's pace and lost in his own paradise on earth. There have been times in the past, when caught in a storm, in rough water, that I was saying my prayers of thanks that his steady, experienced hand was on the tiller. You bet we're going to make this trip and we're going to do whatever we have to do to make sure the guy who has given us a lifetime of unbelievable memories, gets one more Canadian experience."
3897529,Rich B,2015-05-22 19:59:00,1081,"As Bigwalleye1 mentioned earlier that he had been smiling all morning reading these posts, I have been smiling this evening. Many of us (at least me) thought we were ""bullet-proof"" (to some degree) when we were younger and had all the time in the world to explore and take in life....these posts confirm that's not always the case. I was fortunate to have met Andyeye (and several of his good friends) last year up at Cedar Lake, and these posts are ironic in that I was scheduled to be back up at Cedar Lake with my twin brother and other friends for this year's Opener. Sad to say my wife's only sister was diagnosed with ovarian cancer just over a week before our trip. so I have stayed back to support her as her sister had major surgery last week. Have had many great trips with family and friends up north of the border, and I'm blessed to have these memories....and am hoping to making many more in the years ahead. Faith, Family, Friends......and Fishing, Rich B"
