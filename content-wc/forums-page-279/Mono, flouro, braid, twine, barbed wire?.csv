3898618,mms3rd,2015-05-23 10:28:00,148,"We do most of our serious fishing in northern Minnesota. Catch nice fish but not like in Canada. I'm afraid we don't change up enough in Canada with the chances for bigger fish. I've been doing a lot of reading over the years and can't see a consistent recommendation on what line to use. I don't use a casting reel....spinning or spincast...I embarrass myself with casting reel...fished 60 years. 1. We most often fish with topwater or shallow cranks for bass. Use mono only but do suffer from cutoffs from northerns Do we need a mono leader or just take our chances? We have the stiff titanium leader that sort of let you walk the dog. I've not tried one......son has . I like the idea of braided with some kind of leader because you throw a country mile into bays and shorelines and seem to have fewer overcasts. ..and less give in line and lighter weight. 2. For deep crank baits, braided with a mono/standard leader? 3. Trolling live bait. I often use this Little Joe variant that is a 36 inch snelled mono/fluoro leader with hook and spinner... A lot to ask.....I'm not asking for a book, just some quick recommendations.....thanks"
3899290,Bill Krejca,2015-05-23 18:00:00,6107,"I really prefer to not use a wire leader when fishing walleyes, however, I do use wire when I get several bite-offs in the same area/type of area. Anytime when casting cranks or spoons, I find it very difficult to not use a maybe 6"" wire leader. I rarely use a wire leader having a plastic coating, really like a small diameter plain wire, normally not shiny hardware. I don't think it lowers my chances of hits to any large extent most of the time. There are probably times when a wire leader is detrimental to producing, but I feel the water would have to be extremely clear, or the fish were highly educated- i.e., consistently many anglers (pressured), or the bait would be very sensitive to the leader water resistance/weight enough to cause the action of the bait to be highly impaired. Fish swimming around with a mouthful of my baits is not good for the fish nor for this fellow who has to ""cough up"" (pun intended) another 8 bucks for a new one. That's the way I see it. Bill"
3899674,Stein67,2015-05-23 21:46:00,19,"For bass fishing in Canada I still run both Power Pro and mono but in either case I tie on a 2-3' leader of 20# florocarbon with a blood knot for the last three years. I only end up with about one biteoff per trip. It comes through the guides fine and I can re-tie several times before I need to replace the leader. It doesn't kink like steel leaders, visibility is reduced when using braided line, ties with conventional knots and doesn't kill crankbait action or floating/suspending."
3902090,Further North,2015-05-24 21:18:00,2008,"Tyger Wire is what I use for toothy fish, it's tieable and supple enough to not kill the action of a lure. I typically tie in about a foot to the end of a braided line with an Alberto or reverse Alberto knot, then hang swivel snap on the end if I'm going to be throwing stuff like in-line spinners or spoons."
3903202,prov1800,2015-05-25 10:57:00,5010,As a guide on eagle lake i will yse different setups at times.the west arm has super clean water and it pays fishing there to be a bit more stealthy than say heading easttoward osborne where the water gets darker and you can get away with a steel leader.but i basically use a braided line and either mono or flouracarbon and i really dont loose a lot of jigs throughout the summer.i notice my guests do and so iam going to say thats bexause they dont feel the bite fast enough due to crappy rods.haha.sometimes i have to tell them to set the hook and if its a pike its to late.jig has been swallid and there going to loise the jig.i loose more jigs to rocks than pike in a year.its all part of fishing.just buy more jigs and keep tying them on.its usually the small pike that bite your libe of and i dont fish where they are.longer shank hooks will also help in saving some jigs rather than the real short jigs usuallg sold in store.i always get my jigs from www baitrigs.com best jigs ive ever used.no matter what you end up using your going to loose stuff.either you get hung up and have to break off a steel leader and the jig.i end up ysing a 10 lbs braid.what ever is on salebut have using suffix and i double uni that to 3-4 ft of 6 lbs flouracarbon.if i neex to break a jig of i can easily if a pike chews it of no big deal.
