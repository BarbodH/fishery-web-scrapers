I still do this at least once or so per trip or depending on bathroon wait ....... I want to go fishing! Spittin out your toothpaste and watchin it dispurse and very quickly soaping up your face and hair mentally preparing for the inevitable. Grasp the dock, take a big breath and plunge your night weary noggin deep into the ice cold water. Man O Man, I'm ready to go fishin. As this new season is upon us, I wish everyone safe and productive trips."

We boated in ourselves......with all of our gear, fuel, food, etc. Tented on Taylor Island (NE section of Lac Seul ) that year....1984. Built our own latrine, but the shower/bath was called Lac Seul. Memorial weekend was when we went. My grandfather said it was time for him to take a bath. He walked down the beach, stripped and waded out to get wet. Quick return to shore, soap up, back out in the lake to rinse off. I thought well, Gramps has been doing this for 45 + years so I'll do the same.......Holy Smokes was that water cold !!! Made your hair hurt and your feet sting like needles. The old guard on the trip had a good laugh about my whining. The best memory of that trip is the picture that was presented to my Grandmother at a family Christmas gathering that year. My uncle had quite a zoom lens on his camera and took a picture of Gramps drying off on the beach. He gave it to his mother as his Christmas present to her. The picture was nicely framed and matted. The brass plate on the frame was engraved with "" Bare A$$ Beach"". When she opened it the response was "" Oh My"". Gramps was 80 years old on that trip. PjShorthorn"

When we got back, my dad took the film in to get it developed. Couple days later, we go back to pick up our Canadian pictures and the lady who developed them (who is known around town as kinda a nympho) said to my Dad how suprized at how white my dad's legs were. Took a little while till it got funny."

That's one thing I don't miss too much from the old days. Love my hot shower in private at most of the outposts now."
3900154,jimirjr,2015-05-24 06:35:00,1149,"""THOSE"" Glendo Boys already HAVE pics of My bum... lol! Back in the late 80's / early 90's... YOU HAD to take a ""bath"" in the lake... There was no ""running"" water where We went on FLY IN's... About 6 Years ago Up at GLENDO... it was one of those HOT, STICKY, HUMID June weeks.. I said ""screw it, I'm gonna clean up at the boat ramp""... Took a towel and a bar of soap.... MAN, it was refreshing! All of a sudden, ALL the Guys were doing it..... (cept those with 5th wheels) NOW, Its become kind of a tradition.... lol! Funny how that stuff gets started..."
