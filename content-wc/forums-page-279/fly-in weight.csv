3911842,fishron,2015-05-28 05:24:00,317,"A question came up concerning the calculation of fly-in weight and overage charge. One of our guys thought that if we were slightly heavier than normal on personal weight, (he thought 150 was the calculation weight), last time I was 150, I was 16 years old I believe when they say gear allowance of 110 pounds that your only charged if your over that per man. Four men, 440 pounds of allowance. Am I right?"
3911898,Crede,2015-05-28 05:55:00,134,"Yes. You are right. For the vast majority of outfitters: If the limit is 110 lbs per person then a group of 4 has a combined allowance for gear/food/bait/drinks/etc of 440 lbs. (The weight of everything except for the four individuals and what they are wearing.) They will also ask each individual's weight (or sometimes weigh you all together). But for most outfitters that does not affect the weight limit for your ""stuff""."
3911906,octanehi5,2015-05-28 05:55:00,1104,"All of the people that take the trip are weighed, then they weigh all the gear and food, If your weight on food and gear is over the 110lb weight per person flying out of Clova. you will be charged for overage. I do not think I was ever 150 lbs. The 110 lbs allowed is hard to make this weight. In all my trips I think we made weight once, We ate saltines and walleye that week. Overages are usually flown in later that day"
3911946,Pooch,2015-05-28 06:07:00,4619,"The only camp I am aware of that has a 150# per person weight allowance is Green Airways out of Red Lake. Even at 150# some guys still over pack. As everyone knows, beverages are the black hole of your weight allowance.Search archives on this sight for a lot of weight saving tips from experienced guys.Our group is always weighed together for the flight in. Then gear weighed separately.Pooch"
3912314,forgop,2015-05-28 07:19:00,880,"I look at it like this-after investing the kind of money I am, I'm bringing in what I want to take. Better to have something and not need it that leaving it behind and need it. My first trip a group of 4 flew in almost an extra 100#/per person. (First trip for 3 of the 4) We ate and drank like crazy, and it amounted to an extra $75/person I think.. Sure, we over did it by a long shot, but always better to err on the side of caution than thinking your trip would have been that much better with another case of beer, extra sweatshirts/boots because yours got wet, or ate crappy food. It's a vacation and you should splurge where you can afford it. If you're flying in behind a bigger group coming out, odds are you won't be charged as the group coming out already paid for the upgraded plane."
3912426,adempsey,2015-05-28 07:41:00,963,"For body weight, some air services weigh you or just ask you. Some don't ask at all and probably use an average. I think it would depend on the plane, for example a smaller Cesna for a 2 person fly in would be more important to know.For gear weight, as mentioned, it is the total combined weight for your group. Couple of important points here though. If your outfitter is chartering the plane, you will be charged the overage fee. If they operate their own air service, you may be charged but most likely not. That will depend on how over you are or if you are a regular abuser. Even if you are over weight, the charge ranges from $0.50 to $2.00, with most being around $1.00. It's not much of an additional expense if it makes your vacation that much better. Just be sure to pack properly if you know you're going to be overweight. Pack the gear you won't need until later in separate boxes/bins in case they need to fly it in mid-week. Pre-flying in your beverages is great too, if they offer that."
