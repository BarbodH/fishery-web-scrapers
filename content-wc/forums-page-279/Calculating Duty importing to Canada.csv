3907050,Mark R,2015-05-26 14:31:00,1538,we paid $48.00 on 6 cases of beer and a 1.75 liter of rum. How that broke down I have no idea
3907794,TIGHTLINER,2015-05-26 18:37:00,223,Does anyone have the web site or know where I can find out how much duty I would have to pay bringing spirits back across the border? There has to be something printed to calculate bringing it home.
3908042,rnnonmt,2015-05-26 19:59:00,992,Do you actually have spirits to bring back to the US?
3908218,NARDA 1,2015-05-26 20:52:00,636,When our group brings Rye back we pay $2.85 per liter bottle. I read somewhere that the USA charges an excise tax of $10.80 per gallon on whiskey.
3908290,Further North,2015-05-26 21:19:00,2008,"I ran the numbers on a $60 bottle of Scotch and a case of beer. Darn near doubled to price of the Scotch, and added 50% to the cost of the beer. ...there's nothing I need to drink that much...especially given how much I can bring in for free."
3908538,bigwalleye1,2015-05-27 05:34:00,2632,"That would track with my experience. When we've gone in ""over"", it's been suggested by the Canadian Border guards to claim the hard liquor and pay duty on the beer."
