3901498,scar,2015-05-24 17:02:00,196,We usually bring a meal of frozen pre-cooked Chicken Alfredo with us in June. Will this be allowed? I was up two weeks ago and they make those with poultry products walk to the dumpster and deposit. Saw tons of eggs and a frozen Turkey! Forgot to ask at that time if cooked poultry was ok.
3901578,stjoeguy,2015-05-24 17:38:00,979,"I'm not sure. One site says fully cooked poultry is allowed, but another say only fully cooked, canned, commercially sterile meat products. My guess would be that frozen in a zip-lock bag or tupperware would not be allowed. It's hard to differentiate fully cooked from raw when it's frozen. Might be simpler to change the menu this year."

3902554,Skyraptor,2015-05-25 07:24:00,291,"Very simple solution, just buy it up in Canada once you cross the border. If time is a problem then contact your lodge or outfitter and make arrangements to have them pick you up some chicken. Takes the guesswork out of whether to bring it or not."
3903834,scar,2015-05-25 16:19:00,196,Still wondering if anyone knows for sure if the latest Poultry restriction includes cooked chicken.
3903890,pjshorthorn,2015-05-25 16:45:00,5654,"Scar: According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency website, fully cooked poultry is allowed as of the last update on 5-12-15. The website is www.inspection.gc.ca I would read the restrictions as written and also print a copy of the page to take with you if there would be any questions at the border. Obviously, the border agent can make the fianl decision regardless of what is published on the CFIA website. There has been quite a few threads on WC regarding this subject so using the search function may lend itself useful to catch up on past discussions. Good luck on your trip. The dinner you have planned sounds very nice. PjShorthorn"
3903946,Seanik,2015-05-25 17:10:00,218,"Scar, Poultry products are only banned from these 15 States: Arkansas, California, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, & Wisconsin. If for example you are from: Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania or Illinois or any other of the 35 non banned states, you should be OK bringing in poultry products with a store receipt from a non banned state. Examples of restricted items include, poultry meat, (other than fully cooked, canned commercially sterile meat products). This statement from the official website probably prohibits an individual from cooking and importing poultry meat. I hope this helps, Seanik in Erie Pa"
3904002,jigman 2003,2015-05-25 17:29:00,981,"Good advice. I'd only add that the origin of the poultry is also important. A person could purchase poultry from a banned state in a state where no ban exists (i.e. chicken from a Golden Plump farm in MN could be purchased in OH, NY, PA, etc.)"
