3888297,Shorelunch,2015-05-20 07:07:00,554,Is their an egg possession limit? Is their a conservation option where we can only buy up to two dozen and have to leave the rest on the store shelves?
3890569,P&y only,2015-05-20 18:38:00,133,So how many sea gull eggs is equivalent to a chicken egg? And will just a helmet be sufficient while collecting them or will I need eye protection too?
3891449,Gipper,2015-05-21 05:32:00,76,I'm surprised no one has come up with the answer as we have. We are bringing EMU eggs which are technically not poultry because they are too big. Did you ever see an EMU? Google it....they are more like livestock. One Emu egg makes a humongous omelet. We only need 7 for a group of 3 for the week.
3891473,pjshorthorn,2015-05-21 05:37:00,5654,This is where a person wears full body armor collecting the eggs. These things will kick the snot out of ya. PjShorthorn
3894033,Gipper,2015-05-21 18:20:00,76,"I wish you posted this yesterday. I was not aware of the protective nature of these beasts. But I got two eggs with some difficulty. Five to go. If you can get past the look of the speckled yolks, they are actually ok. Better if you can work a deal with the Emu owners."
3894689,pjshorthorn,2015-05-21 22:03:00,5654,"Gip: I'm sorry my timing was a little off on sending information that may have been helpful in preventing possible injury during your harvest. It doesn't sound like you were maimed in any significant way since you commented that you have 5 to go. I guess that is a good thing. The last fella I saw try this got the snot kicked out of him. I think the difference may be that Mama was sitting on her nest when this guy tried to get an egg. He had to sit on a cushy toilet seat in the boat the entire week during that Canadian trip due to very deep bruises to frontal and rear areas that one would consider to be very sensitive. In the spirit of safety for yourself and others, I would suggest that a ""trusted"" partner enter the vicinity of the nested eggs wearing a full chicken suit riding a broomstick pony. This should distract or confuse Mama Emu enough to harvest another egg of two. Best of luck on your next egg-venture. PjShorthorn"

3897497,Gipper,2015-05-22 19:49:00,76,PJ I can see where the the chicken suit and broomstick pony would work. Will have my second best friend handle it.
3898010,pjshorthorn,2015-05-23 05:40:00,5654,Gip: I think you have a solid plan. You will want to have your best friend available to pull you out of the fray if something goes horribly wrong. PjShorthorn

3884921,bushead11,2015-05-19 06:52:00,151,Curious about this too. We leave on Friday and the only thing we need to buy over the border is 5 dozen eggs....
3884961,jigman 2003,2015-05-19 07:06:00,981,"I've been hearing that egg and chicken prices are going to skyrocket from a person inside the industry. Just yesterday 2 million more layers on a farm in MN were put on the ""death list"". This thing is going to get much uglier before it sorts itself out."
3886513,canyon,2015-05-19 15:17:00,37,There great canadian chicken shortage of 2014 is well in the past. We genetically altered and grew test tube chickens and the results were outstanding I am happy to say. Seagull eggs are not a great substitute for chickens but do in a pinch. The market has been flooded with poultry products so there is no shortage expected. You should be OK.
3886545,Blue Lk,2015-05-19 15:24:00,269,"Most grocery stores have moved their eggs & poultry products to locked cabinets,much like jewellery in Walmart.Because this is Canada the security guarding the eggs are not armed.I'm just ""messin with ya"",there is no noticeable shortage of eggs or chicken in local stores."

It has also been reported that the new residents are in full production laying eggs at a rate of 4 dozen per day. Looks like fresh eggs for all customers visiting V-Bay Lodge this summer PjShorthorn

Do you guys really believe there is that big a run on eggs in Canada to make a differance its not like your going to afganistan. I'm more worried about the cheese curds to make Poutian"
3888113,deadhead1,2015-05-20 06:16:00,193,Kenora stores are fully stocked with eggs at regular prices--now bacon--that's a different thing. Package size has shrunk and prices have gone up. This could be a tough summer.
