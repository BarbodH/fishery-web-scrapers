6221908,bus33,2018-07-15 18:29:00,289,We are headed to Ear Falls end of July - 1st week of August. We stay in a private place near Gold Pines. I heard today there is a tournament launching out of that area the first Sat-Sunday we are there. I know Lac Seul is a big lake but we were talking about maybe pulling the boats to another lake fairly close by. The options off the top of my head are the river and Wenasaga. Anyone have any recommendations for anything else within 30 minutes or so that we could hit for walleyes?Thanks

You already know the lake and can find somewhere to fish or share a spot with the tournament guys. The learning curve on a new lake is pretty steep and unless you you have good lake maps, or are fishing with someone who has been there or has intel on the lake, you will likely spend much of your time trying to figure out the good locations and the current pattern. The time it takes to pull your boat out of one lake, drive and launch in another, then repeat the process later to get back to your camp is also time consuming. I would consider a different lake for your next trip to Canada."

6222958,bus33,2018-07-18 12:59:00,289,Thanks for the heads up ProV. We take our boats out every night so that isn't a big deal. We were more worried about the extra number of boats on the water.
