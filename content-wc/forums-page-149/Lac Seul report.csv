At this time of year the fish are going up and down not really moving around, a guide told me that at this time of year the big fish are where they are, drops, points, weedlines, humps, sand flats, mud flats depending on bait movement, wind, temps and rain. Some days we will backtroll and outfish the jiggers, big time. Other times no, it depends on location, depth of troll, wind, WAY to many factors to say jigging will outfish trolling."
6222342,Rondogpike,2018-07-17 05:16:00,24,We cover new water with bottom bouncers and spinner rigs. If we hit a double I mark the spot on the GPS and go back and jig the area. We have found many honey holes this way over the years. If the fish slow down we keep moving and look for another double. Good luck
6222922,flntknp17,2018-07-18 11:41:00,151,"I have done both extensively on LS and for me (just my $0.02), trolling produces larger fish and more aggressive fish on average than jigging. I absolutely do jig fish (though usually with jigging spoons or bladebaits) when the situation is right for it (like when the fish a re clearly schooled up on a very small spot). For the majority of the season, I find that trolling a bouncer will locate aggressive fish more effectively and is less affected by the mayfly hatches since it can be tailored to imitate them. I can cover miles of water and vary my depth and speed very easily while trolling bouncers to locate fish. Bouncers are also a lot simpler for my family to fish.......here, hold the rod and start reeling when you get one! Seems less prone to snagging too once you find the right combination of weight and sinker type and speed. The beauty of LS is that you can catch walleyes almost anywhere on almost any day using almost any presentation. Sometimes jigging works well, but I bet averaged over the course of a season (we often go in both June and September) that trolling will catch larger and more aggressive fish. Just my observations.

6218772,Guest,2018-07-08 20:29:00,0,"Spent spent the last week fishing out of the Ear Falls area. 7/1-7/6 Fished around Cox island, Shanty Narrows, Scout Lake/bay and Mckenzie Bay. Best fishing was in McKenzie bay on reefs. Mayflies were present but havent peaked. Many walleyes were puking up mayflies when caught though. Water temps range form 68-71 degree. Air temps were very comfortable daily highs ranged 60-80 degrees and 2 days of excessive wind 20 mph+ Caught fish in the 8-10' early in the week and last day we were catching walleye in 18-25' of water. Used mainly bottom bouncers and minnows and did catch some trolling crank baits or casting for northerns. Biggest walleye 26.5"" northern 36.5"" Set the hook! Fish on"
6218776,Big Louie,2018-07-08 20:35:00,22,Thanks Superguest! Any reports from the east side of Lac Seul?
6218800,rather-be-fishin,2018-07-08 21:38:00,429,Thanks for the update! We are heading up to Lac Seul on 7/20-7/27. Organizing tackle & starting to pack! Canâ€™t wait! Best trip of every year! RBF.
6219088,Slim03,2018-07-09 12:05:00,159,"I was up in the Lost Lake area from 6/29 - 7/3. Fishing was solid and the walleyes were transitioning. Started the trip in 8-10 feet and last day we were catching in 20-24 feet. Numbers were good and size was excellent. I found on this trip that the walleyes were not spread out as much and marked fewer and when you marked you better be right on them, some days the bite was really light and you really had to pay attention. Very few dinks caught and lots of slots and overs. Last day we boated 25 walleyes over 20. Big walleye was 26 and biggest northern was 35."
6219278,HitmanSB,2018-07-09 19:26:00,10,"Good to know the depths you tried, and will be in McKenzie some of our trip, August 11th, at Fisherman's Cove. Looking forward to another great year on the Lac, that we talk about all year in anticipation."
6219580,flntknp17,2018-07-10 10:04:00,151,"We fished Goose, Steamboat, and McKenzie areas of Lc Seul out of Gold Pines from 6/28 through 7/6/18 and had great walleye fishing as always. Fish were definitely more in summer spots than we've seen this same week in previous years. Offshore reefs and flats were better than nearshore areas for the most part. Muddy and sandy bottoms were noticeably better than bouldery bottoms or bedrock. Magic depth was mostly 14', but had good fishing from 6' to 20' almost entirely on bouncers and float rigs without spinners. I find that (for us), using a float without a spinner and only a very small piece of worm tends to match the mayfly hatch best. Pike were generally scattered by the extreme winds during the week and the low water. Some good pike fishing late in the week, but no giants. Tons of walleyes over the slot and lots in it. Seems to be a really good population structure at the moment. Matt"
6219622,MikeAnkeny,2018-07-10 11:30:00,67,As always a great report
6221682,dakota eye,2018-07-15 06:40:00,69,Any new reports? Leave Wednesday am can't wait! Thx
6221946,Skis,2018-07-15 21:14:00,1523,"Thanks for the report!! My son & I are making our first ever trip to Lac Seul July 28-August 4 (I believe). Taking my son for his HS graduation gift!! Staying at Cherob Resort. Very anxious and also nervous, as it is such a large body of water!! But it's called the Walleye Factory, so I just hope it's a trip we'll talk about for years to come!!!!"
6222030,stumcfar,2018-07-16 08:17:00,451,"I am just curious. The fish must be more scattered now than earlier in the year. I am wondering why the spinner bottom bouncer presentation over anchoring and jigging? We just came back from a trip and the two other groups in camp trolled all day with spinners and our group easily caught twice as many fish a day by anchoring and jigging. It was a different lake without the sand flats, so maybe that makes a difference. Maybe you pick up bigger fish trolling too??"
