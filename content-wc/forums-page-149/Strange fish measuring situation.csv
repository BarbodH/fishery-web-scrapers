6222080,bus33,2018-07-16 09:56:00,289,This is the rule I live by on LS. I know that 18 is the magic number but I won't keep anything over 17.5. I'm afraid of the fish loosening up when it's death or like the OP posted having the filet measured. Not worth it for me.

6223100,yoopertrout,2018-07-18 18:56:00,1172,This makes sense.
6223104,PRO-V16,2018-07-18 19:04:00,454,"Doesn't make sense to me otherwise they would or should change the slot. Also, you can't cull up there as it's a keep and kill lake."
6223142,Slim03,2018-07-18 20:16:00,159,I was up there last year and during the trip heard of several people getting ticketed for not killing fish all the way and other violations such as beer in the boat. We had a boat get checked and it was a walleye that was a legal fish at 17 7/8. They measured it multiple times knocked it again and measured and it still was legal and they let them go and agreed it was a perfect fish. But they ran them through the ringer including counting plates in the trash bag from shore lunch as the group had split up after lunch. This year my rule was anything 17.5 on up including overs goes back as itâ€™s not worth the hassle.
6223222,pjshorthorn,2018-07-19 06:55:00,5654,"Lac Seul regs require a person to immediately kill any fish they are keeping in order to prevent people from culling fish that have been in a livewell or on a stringer. The officer's comments don't make sense. The slot limit is there for a reason and a 17 3/4"" walleye is legal to keep. I understand that a same size fish would most likely fall into the slot the following season,but the officer was just imparting his opinion and not what the regs allow.Just a general question for anyone that reads this post. What is better for the fishery? Buying an Ontario conservation license ( 2 fish possession) or a Sportsman license ( 4 fish possession) and keeping 2 17"" walleye or keeping 4 16"" walleye ? I'm not a biologist, but harvesting half the number of fish per day( if intended to be eaten each day) seems less invasive to the fishery. I rarely keep any fish to take home anymore so I have bought a conservation license for about the last 10 years. Cheaper license cost and if I need to eat more than two fish a day I've been starving for a very long time.PjShorthorn"
6223224,bigwalleye1,2018-07-19 07:08:00,2632,"Just returned from my second annual trip to Lac Seul, and wanted to update the group re: the measuring fish vs measuring skeleton issues... It seems that the camp owner called the MNR and talked to a supervisor on the matter, and later received a call from the officer with instructions to have the ticketed individual tear up/destroy the ticket, and he would try to stop by to discuss the matter with the person that rec'd the ticket. The officer did not return, but, in speaking with the camp owner, indicated he may have been ""overzealous"" in his efforts to protect the resource. Camp owner told me that the point he made to the MNR was the regs indicate measuring LIVE FISH in an effort to determine length, not dead fish or fish skeletons. The skeleton measurement and process really is irrelevant, since no one has the ability to measure the skeleton on the fish before they decide to keep it or release it. Apparently, at least in principle, the officer agreed, and the ticket was destroyed. Also sounded like there was some misunderstanding on the part of the officer. He indicated to the camp owner the fish skeleton was 1/2 in over. In fact, the skeleton measured 18.25, a quarter inch into the slot, but the fish skeleton WAS 1/2 in longer than the claimed on the water measurement. Glad the issue was resolved and no fines were levied, since the ""offending party"" truly did nothing wrong."
6223232,Bill Krejca,2018-07-19 07:13:00,6107,"Perhaps the officer feared that the ""culling"" took place by simply putting over the side dead fish which were a bit smaller than the last one caught (and kept). As for the just under keepers harming next year's hatch, the logic is a bit difficult for me to""fathom"" (excuse the pun), in that logic would just dictate lowering the length limit somewhat, and to what end? Bill"
6223246,pjshorthorn,2018-07-19 07:26:00,5654,Thanks for that update. Glad it was resolved correctly. Kudos to the camp owner for making that phone call. PjShorthorn
6223252,pjshorthorn,2018-07-19 07:33:00,5654,"Agreed about culling dead fish...that would be the only reasonable answer to the officer's comment. It would seem he didn't observe them doing so as a fine would have definitely been issued. I have fished Lac Seul off and on over the last 35 years and the reduction in possession limits, the slot limit , along with the keep and kill requirement has created a very healthy fishery.

We were not worried as we measured all the fish and didn't keep any fish within .25 of an inch of the limit. Well, one of the fish was dead and was over by less than .25 inch. I couldn't believe it as we had measured all the fish twice, once on each side. She must have read my face as she said don't worry I'm not going to ding you on that when the fish die their muscles relax and they can get longer. You can't get much more dead than filleted and I would guess muscles are the fillet, so if not relaxed the have been removed. I don't know if I use this as an excuse on a bunch of fish, I know we don't keep anything within .5 inches now."

6217328,Shotgun,2018-07-04 13:09:00,759,"Two years ago on Lac Seul we were checked out on the lake by the MNR. As he was checking us he commented that he just checked two boats and all walleye were within a 1/4 inch of the no keep slot. He knew they had been culling fish to manage this occurring. He mentioned even though it was legal it irritated him to see this happening as these fish were next moving into the upcoming group, which would be laying the eggs for several year in the future. If everyone did this it would reduce the upcoming year's hatchlings as this size fish would never hit the no keep slot for several years of growth. He felt a better way was to spread your catch out over a couple inch wide band prior to the no keep slot. Interesting perspective and makes a person think."
6217340,Huntindave,2018-07-04 13:59:00,2194,"I guess if it irritated him, he should talk to his supervisor about his concerns, so his concerns could be passed on to those who write the regulations.

If you pay it, you have plead guilty to a crime. Dig deeper into it, you'd likely find it's a misdemeanor crime. Kind of like a driving around a barricade ticket I got 11 years ago. I argued it in court with both the county attorney and the judge. County sheriff has zero right to right the ticket because of a State highway construction project that had locals up in arms of increased traffic on side roads. People were finding their own detours instead of taking the state highway marked detour. The specific ticket would have been a misdemeanor on my criminal record. Getting pretty serious just for driving to work. Judge ruled that it was not in the authority of the township board to close all township roads in the area to non-local traffic. They can regulate speed and weight, but cant close the roads. Over 200 tickets were tossed out from a three day period. You can apply that reason to any ticket you received. Game, traffic etc."

6213986,elway12,2018-06-26 21:20:00,335,"I agree with Pooch - don't argue with the warden! I think it is important to look at this measuring issue closer. Let's give the benefit of the doubt to the person who got caught the fish & thus got the ticket. That he was being truthful & honorable that he measured the fish at under 18. What IF after filleting the fish some how it did ""stretch"" it to be more than what had been measured previously?? He got a ticket for something that he was not trying to get and he was following the regulations. To me that is an important thing to not have happen and if it does/did why. Just telling a person to ""keep only fish not close to the slot"" is, to me, a weak answer. It's like saying ""don't drive so you will never get a ticket or into an accident"". What is catching a fish not close to the slot actually mean...a 1/2 inch, a mm, a cm, an inch, an inch & 1/2 shorter? How many times do people catch fish to keep and they are just more than 17? It seems to happen ALL the time. Of course, I don't keep fish over the slot, I am not implying that the slot should be lengthen, or that the warden doesn't have final say(of course you can go to a judge), or that many guys don't pinch the tail & measure incorrectly etc. But it's lawful that if you catch a 17+ fish you can legally keep it. I am interested to find out from others that have said they too are going to try to see if their filleting methods change the measurement. I want to be able keep a fish that is close to the maximum legal length and not have to worrying about getting a ticket that is questionable."
6213992,Kevin23,2018-06-26 22:34:00,2205,"Most usa state reg books show how to legally measure the fish, do it that way! Some are down the body with a tape, some are under the fish with a board, some are pinching the tail, and some are where the fish lays nstural. All of those will give a different measurement. My eyes are messured according to what the dnr says where i fish in Iowa. Board and pinching the tail. When co's check the fish they usually have me do it on the board so they can see, if its close he takes the fish and the board and lays his tape on the board and measures the fish. Ive never had an issue with my measurements differing.As for the measuring of filleted fish, i think i would be calling the supervisor.

6211464,bigwalleye1,2018-06-21 05:34:00,2632,"Just returned from a trip to LS. A friend from camp I see every year was in the cleaning shack when MNR rolled in. As he's dropping the carcass down the hole and into the bucket underneath, the MNR grabs the bucket, asks if it's his fish, and proceeds to measure the skeleton. Comes up with 18 1/4. Friend has been going a long time, knows the rules. Says it was 17 3/4 with a tight pinch on the tail. That's why they kept it. Warden says it doesn't matter if it's got fillets on it or not, it'll measure the same. While I guess I'd call BS on that, the $120 fine wouldn't be worth the effort to drive back up to fight.

6211472,fsz,2018-06-21 06:02:00,144,"Never heard of it. That said, its clearly a bush-league move on the warden. Our group was stopped on a road side check this year. Wardens were great. I had even made a mistake by saying we had 36 fish when we had 30. One member stayed up in camp longer and didn't return with us. We did not have his fish. Force of habit on my part. Sometimes, once you make a ""mistake"" and give ""an inconsistent statement"" when questioned then its game-on with a full shakedown and all the associated $5* -ache. Not this time. I have had some bad experiences but also good ones. It depends on the warden and the supervisor. It might not get you out of the ticket, but I'd try to call the warden's supervisor and give him your thoughts. He won't give you any satisfaction over the phone- but, if he believes that move was bush-league he may reign in the warden or issue a directive to not measure fish in that manner. Could help someone else down the road."

One old guy in our group likes to tell the story how he got busted for what he thought was a legal northern. He measured it and came up with it being about an 1/8 below the slot, thus legal. CO came into the fish house as he was about to clean it, took out a paper tape and measured over the top of the fish. Well, this added length to the measurement and thus the fish was illegal based on this measurement. He got fined and paid it, but didn't think about the way it was measured as an issue until too late. Anyone else seen that one before?"
6211584,stumcfar,2018-06-21 09:15:00,451,"I was told by a CO in Minnesota that when measuring a live fish, make sure to measure it on both sides. He wasn't being funny, but dead serious. He said fish are not shaped perfect and they can measure different depending on what side they are laying on. Just to be safe, for me, if it is less than a half inch from being too long I usually throw them back. No sense get hassled by an over zealous CO!"
