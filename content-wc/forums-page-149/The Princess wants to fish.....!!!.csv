5587921,Moosebunk,2017-06-03 20:08:00,211,Call my buddy Pat at Lake Of The Woods Lodge. Mention Moosebunk sent ya.
5588985,narly12,2017-06-04 13:14:00,13,Check out Lost Island Lodge website. Fishing out of that lodge for 13 years and it is outstanding in every respect.
5591609,Aspencreek,2017-06-05 14:19:00,2911,"Nice place, nice boats, NICE. But wow so are those rates."
5591721,Bstar,2017-06-05 14:54:00,564,Agreed. Never been but hits the OP's criteria. Personally for that kind of money I think I'm headed to Manitoba or Echoing Lake.
5591737,camp chef,2017-06-05 14:58:00,915,Bignorthlodge.com in Minaki....only 1/2 hour from Kenora....Plenty of Big and small water.Very princess friendly

6224626,Palancar,2018-07-22 08:49:00,52,"Kisagami Lake. 60 miles from James Bay, open June and July, make reservations a year in advance. She will catch a 20 lb pike. Google the place. Expensive! Been there twice. Oh, it has waiters and waitresses....uh, make that ""servers."" Has a ""media cabin"" for TV crews. I think you'll make a good impression."
5586641,mdsn,2017-06-02 19:42:00,121,"Ok, similar to another post but dont want to hijack. Help! I need your advice please! I fish Ontario a lot. love the bigger water and can tolerate some of the more 'rustic' places. I always go full housekeeping with the guys. Now my girlfriend wants to try it. But a week in a remote housekeeping might be pushing it for the first time. I want this first Canada trip to be a winner for her. Selfishly,.... if she likes it then I can go even more! We are 40's and 50's and not too concerned with budget. Would take our own boat. So, looking for recommendations for a nicer place, good service and at least a modified American plan where we can have a cocktail and dinner served. Lac Seul, lake of the woods, larger lakes preferred. Thanks for any ideas!"
5586793,The tank,2017-06-02 21:32:00,340,If full American plan is all right I would suggest talk to obabikoin bay lodge. Jared is a good guy to talk with. (Lake of the woods) If you just want evening meals talk with Wayne at grassy narrow's. We stay with Matt and Jenn at miles bay I love that area.
5586929,Thompmd,2017-06-03 02:20:00,320,"I took Princess last year and going again in a couple weeks. We are big water people as well(Lake of the Woods) Last year was at Crow Rock(one of their cabins on a private island about a mile from their base camp) and this year to Ash Rapids. We too take our own boat and do full housekeeping. We(I really) chose them because they had housekeeping but also offered the option of a meal as long as you let them know ahead of time. We are 52. We also take our small dog. We also went a few weeks later than I used to go to have more stable weather. Much as I hate to admit it the fishing didn't change.Here was her take on the trip: she got a little stir crazy and she wished we would have went to Kenora during the week to break things up and let her shop and essentially get out. We also changed around the way I fished just a little to accommodate her and made some of the trips more sight seeing and wildlife rather than just fishing. She did a great job fishing and women are much better at adapting than us men.We take several trips per year and generally each trip is more ""his"" or ""her"" trip and it works well for us.We also tried renting a private cabin off individuals but that didn't work out.Good luck and send us a report."
5586953,That Minnesota guy,2017-06-03 04:55:00,8293,Shorten your week to a half week fishing and 1/2 week sightseeing / goofing off on the way up and back. As far as a resort you will find one.
5586977,Ndstallmann,2017-06-03 05:15:00,549,"Witch Bay Camp , Lake of the Woods. My wife said it was her first true vacation, cause you do no work. They do it all."
5586993,martinbns,2017-06-03 05:36:00,1520,"When I took my wife on her first multi day trip last year we went to totem lodge on LOTW, for us that was combined with an education on how to use our new boat by using their guide in our boat. The food was outstanding, as good as almost any restaurant I've ever eaten at, the guide was terrific and we had a blast. Later in the year we went to Five Lakes Lodge on Gull Rock lake near REd Lake, On. More rustic, but town was only 15 minutes away, we went and played golf and ate a couple of dinners in town. Both were great, another option would be Smith's Camps on Storm Bay road in Kenora, you can just rent a cabin, use your boat, they have a restaurant and town is only a short drive."
5587025,pjshorthorn,2017-06-03 06:08:00,5654,"As mentioned in the other thread, Hawk Lake Lodge would be a higher end lodge experience with all meals included. I believe guides are available as well. Close enough to Kenora to run into town for exploring and shopping if that was desired. I have heard that they offer an amazing experience. The second one to look into would be Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul. Cabins have full amenities, American meal plan and it is a very short boat ride across Lost Lake to the boat launch if you wanted to pick up your vehicle and run into Sioux Lookout. They offer guide services and a few folks I know have used Colin Gosse ( sp? ) and highly recommend him. I would love to be able to convince my wife to go in late September, just for the shear beauty of the season in Canada,but alas she is not a fishing gal.....just all princess. Have fun on your trip ! PjShorthorn"
5587113,Pezman38,2017-06-03 06:57:00,3196,"The cabins are so nice at Wrights Wilderness Camp on Gull Rock that you won't need full housekeeping. They have kayaks you can borrow and as mentioned before, Red Lake offers some shopping and a golf course if you want to take a break from fishing. Lee and Stephanie run an awesome camp. I need to get back there."
