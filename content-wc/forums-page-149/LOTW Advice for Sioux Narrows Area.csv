6219274,downriverbob,2018-07-09 19:22:00,880,"If you let me know what resort you are staying at I will give you some areas to try and baits to use. Been going in the area for over 25 years, stay at a resort in the middle of Whitefish Bay. if are interested in some information about fishing send me a private message. Bob"
6220584,Lazy Fisherman,2018-07-12 11:51:00,276,You are gonna like that area houseboating in September. Insects will be gone and usually after the Labor Day weekend the lake will not be very busy. One of my favorite times to be on LOTW.
6220878,jimirjr,2018-07-13 06:27:00,1149,"Yes Sir ! We have done this trip numerous times before... Always have a GREAT time... AND, NO BUGS.... and fewer people.. !!"
6220882,pjshorthorn,2018-07-13 06:33:00,5654,"Sir Dudeness, What are the dates of your trip? Gotta make sure I send you a few secret weapons for you to use on the trip. I'd offer up my Micro Stix rod ,but it is going back with me to Canada at the end of September/ early Oct. Gotta catch a biggin on it and see if the drag blows up !!!! LOL. PjShorthorn"
6223150,ecjte,2018-07-18 20:38:00,11,Thanks to all for tips and suggestions. Heading out today - very excited. Will report how it went.
6217060,ecjte,2018-07-03 22:09:00,11,"Excited to take the family on first visit to Lake of the Woods in a couple of weeks. Staying in Sioux Narrows region and have scoured the forums for info on the area. Any updates on recent fishing conditions or suggestions for spots to seek out when we arrive. Species preference goes something like smallies, pike, walleye, crappie/perch, and lakers. Not a muskie fanatic, but all fish are great, so we take what we can get. With family along, would be nice to keep boat trips under an hour. Stops at a nice beach area would be a bonus. Thanks in advance for any suggestions."
6217766,ecjte,2018-07-05 15:52:00,11,"Nearly a hundred views and not a single reply. Not even a report of current fishing conditions in the area?? Somebody must have suggestions for a long time fisher, but LOTW first timer. I'll take any input. Thanks."
6217816,Thompmd,2018-07-05 19:10:00,320,"I wrote a report called ""LOTW trip report 6/16-23"" on 6/24 for our stay near Sioux Narrows. If I can help let me know"
6217852,ecjte,2018-07-05 20:39:00,11,"Saw your report previously Thompmd. Sounded like a good trip and similar to how we'll be fishing. Appreciate the insights. Can you give me a sense of numbers? How many constitutes a ""good"" day? Thanks."
6217856,That Minnesota guy,2018-07-05 20:50:00,8293,"Waking up in the morning, not getting hurt during the day, not breaking the boat all constitutes a good day!"
6217870,Thompmd,2018-07-05 22:10:00,320,"I fished by myself in the mornings and sometimes in the evening. My wife is definitely a casual fisher person. I typically caught around 25-30 in the mornings and the same in the evenings so probably 50-60/day. I definitely sacrificed a few numbers because there was a pretty decent topwater bite for the smallmouth and the average size was better. There was a definite pattern to their location and I'm certain there will be when you get there. Another thing that I seem to experience on LOTW is that once I fish an area it was hard to catch many if I returned to it so I spent a lot of time finding new water and since it was our first trip that was a slow process and many times I found myself on top of where I wanted to fish. Also, we went out into Whitefish one day and there was a noticeable difference in depth and clarity that I wasn't really prepared for in regards to how I should have approached the fishing."
6217874,ecjte,2018-07-05 22:30:00,11,"Thanks. That was helpful. Will likely avoid Whitefish since it looks like laker heaven, which aren't a priority for us, and we'll try to stay off anything resembling ""big water"" with the kids."
6217948,emma17,2018-07-06 07:52:00,436,"I hope you and family have a great trip. Our group has fished out of Obabikon in late July the last few years (had to take this year off due to life's realities). I don't think I have anything unique to offer for fishing tips. For Smallies we hit the rocky (small rocks) shores with jig/plastic swimbait and/or rattle traps and had lots of fun. For Walleye we fished humps at 22 feet or so, but shallower (12-16 feet) in areas of moving water especially in neck downs. We also had success in a wind blown bay with many large Perch and Walleye. Pike we found in typical weed areas, nothing really large though. We didn't troll as we had too many on the boat. For Musky, we raised more on jig and minnow by accident. Typically in shallower water when fishing a point. When jigging keep in mind it's pretty easy to get snagged in rock so be prepared to retie."
6217956,nicko,2018-07-06 08:03:00,508,"Havent fished that area in awhile, but we had some luck south of Russell island for smallmouth and pike. Find the boulders in water, find the smallmouth. For Pike action Snake bay isn't bad. By its name you can tell what's there. Had some decent luck trolling deep cranks for large pike. Near three sisters islands there are lots of deeper trenches with shallows nearby. Trolling shad raps and deep husky jerks through those deep channels gave us some nice bigger pike. Just use some titanium/wire leaders. You'll need em. As for Walleye, find hump, I prefer to bottom bounce with crawlers after June. Keeps you moving and if you don't get any action, move. Fish are moving around those mid-lake humps and the shallows. Personally have caught bigger fish shallow after dinner than morning and day. Yellow girl is better for walleye as the water is a bit more tea colored. Good luck!"
6218760,Lazy Fisherman,2018-07-08 20:17:00,276,"You also may just want to talk to the other guests at your resort/camp when you get there. Go down to the fish house when people are cleaning their catch. I have helped people on lakes that I have fished many times. Also, I have invited new people to follow me for a day. You might want to say where you will be staying and what week you are going to be there. You might just discover that someone on WC might be at the same camp at the same time. I think you will like the Sioux Narrows area. Good luck."
