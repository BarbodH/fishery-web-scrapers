Ive been spending way more cash on lures than i normally would but thats part of the fun i guess. My question for you is what should be the focus (lures/bait) that time of year? I would think water temps should be still pretty warm the first week in sept. Normally in wisconsin we troll shap raps flikr shads other cranks as well as drift live bait. Later in the fall i start jiggin bigger minnows as the water cools. Are there certain lures we should be sure and have plenty of? Ive bought about 100-150 1/4oz 3/8 oz jigs in various colors. Ive also grabbed about a dozen different husky jerks ans flikr minnows/shads. Another question i have is about walleye location at that time.. This may seem awful elementery/amatuer but do the walleye transition to shallower water tha early in the fall? Im just trying to make sure my son has the best opportunity to get fish i can. Im doing the leg work on research. Thank you, Scott Stay safe and good fishin!!"
