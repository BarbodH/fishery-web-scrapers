6223426,stumcfar,2018-07-19 13:59:00,451,"I may be the odd man out, but I would put a piece of dog turd on my hook rather than gulp in the Ear Falls area of Lac Seul. When the bite is one after the other, we mainly fish minnows, I have on numerous times switched to Gulp or something of that sort. I will then be the only one not catching. I have talked to others who have said plastics work great below the dam in the river, but are worthless on the lake. Just my experience with the stuff."
6223438,PRO-V16,2018-07-19 14:11:00,454,"Are you pounding bottom with it or trying to fish it like a regular minnow? The only way it works great is actively jigging with a size heavier jig than you would use with live bait. I've used the same method with lunchmeat, cheese or a piece of red licorice believe it or not and caught them."
6223448,Red legs,2018-07-19 14:25:00,27,"I had a 300 fish day on the Lac on gulp minnow tipped with 1/2 crawler during last day of last years trip. Had one period in little more than an hour two of us in my boat caught over 100. We found a sand flat that was stacked up with bait and predators after a big north wind. Gulp minnows work, sometimes better than others but overv- 29 years I’ve learned they are more effective than other non scented plastics. I’ve not tried all scented plastics and I do not work for Berkeley. After cold fronts move through and the high rolls in, leeches rigged and a slower approach are the way to go. I had an old timer who was a local from soiux lookout who told me years ago “ when conditions get tough simplify. Go to a leech or a crawler on a bare hook.” I’ve taken that to heart but have learned that a soft bodied jig and a leech fished on a modified wolf river three way rig is hard to beat post cold front. It’s saved several trips for me through the years."
6223654,Aspencreek,2018-07-19 22:02:00,2911,You and I think alike!!
6223892,fishingMN4eyes,2018-07-20 10:49:00,108,"This has been my experience with Gulp in the past. Whoever is using Gulp usually gets outfished by those who are using live bait.Quote: Originally Posted by PRO-V16Are you pounding bottom with it or trying to fish it like a regular minnow?

6224694,MikeinMN,2018-07-22 13:47:00,190,"I think Lac Seul fishes best with jigs and 1/2 crawler is usually as good as a minnow. I think next most effective is bottom bouncer and crawler. Trolling cranks is probably the least effective presentation on that lake, but I do it a lot just because I like to fish that way. Color of jigs doesn't seem to matter that much, either bright colors or gold are my best spinner colors and gold orange red and white cranks seem to work best. I think a lot of people fish differently and are successful there, these are just my favorites"
6224864,Aspencreek,2018-07-22 22:29:00,2911,"I don't troll cranks either, never had much luck and would seem to hang up to often. BUT, I will use a floating crank behind a bottom bouncer, one that has very little lip to keep it off the bottom and out of trouble and let the bottom bouncer keep it down in the zone. I will also take the belly treble hook off, makes it easier to release and they attack it from behind anyway."
6222306,Skis,2018-07-16 21:11:00,1523,"Taking my son for our first ever trip to Cherob Resort July 28 - August 3. Can't wait!! Been trying to read as much as I can to make the most of our trip. 3 Questions: 1) How many rods should I take? Jigging Rod, Bottom Bouncer Rod, Trolling Rod? I have plenty of rods, but don't want to pack something I'm not going to use either..... 2) Do I bother getting nightcrawlers? From what I've gleaned for informationd, minnows appear to outperform crawlers by a sizeable margin. 3) Anything else anyone else would like to add? Thanks for the replies!!"
6222320,Red legs,2018-07-16 22:18:00,27,Nightcrawlers and leeches are all we have used for over twenty years. My favorite approach is 1/4 oz jig with a gulp minnow and 1/2 crawler tip. Leech rigs are deadly after cold fronts. I’ve had more 100 fish days than 75 fish days and have had up to 300 fish days- although they are rare. Been going for 29 years. 1/8 oz jigs in shallow current tipped with crawler or jig is excellent too. My biggest fish have all come off crawler tipped jigs with biggest beng 31inches. You don’t need minnows. They are hard to keep and overrated.
6222368,tv4fish,2018-07-17 05:58:00,2694,"I will agree with Red ^^.We also have been hitting the east end of Lac Seul for over 30 years. Have found our best fishing (catching) to be vertical jigging with crawlers and leeches. We do a controlled drift over our favorite spots. Our preference is also a 1/4 ounce jig - however, sometimes the wind conditions dictate a heavier jig - you need to ""stay in touch with the bottom"".Sometimes - it seems color can make a slight difference - but, if they're biting - they're biting.(I also agree on the minnow comment)."
6222378,Hook_settr,2018-07-17 06:19:00,127,I haven't fished Lac Seul but have fished other large lakes in Ontario (most recently LOTW). We almost always take along nightcrawlers as an alternative/supplement to minnows. We typically start the week with minnows and then switch to nightcrawlers once we know what the pattern is. Our experience is that on most days the productivity between nightcrawlers and minnows is negligible.Enjoy your trip!
6222392,MN_Moose,2018-07-17 06:38:00,964,When i fished Lac Seul gold was the color choice. Gold jigs. Gold spinners. Anything as long as it was gold.
6222470,Ricky Spanish,2018-07-17 09:21:00,1298,"About 10yrs ago, the camp's guide stole (borrowed without permission) a camp boat and trailer and the three of us took a road trip from Eagle Lake up to LS. We bought 10 dozen minnows on the way and then boated 200 walleyes in about 6hrs of fishing. All were on 1/4oz jigs, color seemed to make no difference. The last 1/2 hour we were using pieces of minnows off the floor of the boat, and when those were gone, we tallied up our numbers. We had landed 197 walleyes. I was determined to hit 200. I had only brought a jig box but one jig had a torn up chartreuse twister on it. The tail was intact and I could barely salvage a nub of the body to hook through. I dropped the jig down and pulled up a nearly 30"" pike. I thought I was sure to get bitten off or have her shake the scrap bait off the hook but we landed her. It only took about 4-5 more pitches to land three more walleyes. It is one of my most fun days on the water."
6222634,PRO-V16,2018-07-17 16:40:00,454,"I agree with all the previous comments. Been going since 94 and do just great with a jig and piece of crawler or gulp minnow. I'm not wasting a pile of money on minnows. Any color can be good but I usually use green, glow white or glow pink. If a cold front moves in those Northland Thumper jigs with the little blade get them going."
6223368,38bill,2018-07-19 11:19:00,331,FYI: I'm going up to the Vermillion Bay area this weekend (7-21-18). I contacted our long time resort owner and they told me leeches are very hard to get at this time. You may want to bring a flat of crawlers up with you then you will be sure to have bait. Probably will be cheaper too.
6223388,Limeyangler,2018-07-19 12:07:00,563,"I live in dryden and fish the south-central part of the lake. Went up yesterday and used crawlers for the first time, they work awesome. However, large ( 4""-6"") sucker minnows hooke on a small jig through the nostril and mouth fluttered around structure is also KILLER."
6223392,Bob/MN,2018-07-19 12:12:00,178,"For the last five years fishing Sen Bay all I used was a bottom bouncer with a crawler spinner rig. I run a tiller/back troll, and use long rods(8 & 9 foot). The long rods allow me to change depths without having to take my hand off of the tiller handle. They also help to keep me out of the boat shadow in shallow water."
