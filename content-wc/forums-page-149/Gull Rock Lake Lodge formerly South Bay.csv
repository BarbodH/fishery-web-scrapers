Can't say enuf about how they have cleaned up and re-energized a fish camp that we have been going to for 16 years. New furniture in the now level cabins, fresh bait and reasonable fuel and always greeted with a smile! The beach is clean and family friendly! The atmosphere is really pumped! And it goes without saying......the best RV Sites on the lake all with 50 amp. full service. We love it here and will be coming back for YEARS to come. Consider Gull Rock Lake Lodge for your next Canadian adventure. Oh and did I mention that the people camping are really FUN????"

The Moncrief family are such wonderful people & made us feel so welcome & part of their family. They were constantly asking if we needed anything & went out of their way to accommodate us. The camp sites overlooking beautiful Gull Rock are the best in the area. When it was time to leave it was super hard to say ""goodbye"" as we felt we were leaving family for a year. We've made some wonderful friends in camp over the years & can't wait until next year. If you are looking for a great place & a wonderful family to make your next Canadian vacation a great memory be sure & check out Gull Rock Lake Lodge, you won't be disappointed!!! Did I mention that the fishing was great?"
