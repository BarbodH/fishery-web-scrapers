6224204,martinbns,2018-07-20 21:01:00,1520,Wylie Point is far enough from Kenora that the fishing pressure is relatively light and the food is fantastic. We fish that part of the lake a lot and go for lunch regularly.
6224304,NARDA 1,2018-07-21 09:00:00,636,"www.birchdalelodge.com Great fishing, good equipment and nice cabins along with a steakhouse at the lodge at an affordable price. The owners boys are usually around which would give his boys someone to hang out with too. This musky was caught last month, off the dock by this young man."
6224360,ElectricSlide19,2018-07-21 11:43:00,147,"If price does not matter, then I would look at: Totem, wiley, athabasca, budd's gunisao, wollaston, and hawk lake lodge. Hawk and Gunisao are some of the best places for trophy fish."
6223812,Weby13,2018-07-20 09:09:00,57,I have a friend that is looking for a flyin or drive in all inclusive lodge in northwestern Ontario. He is taking his sons and the most important thing is great fishing. Does anybody have any suggestions on all inclusive lodges with great fishing decent food and good boats. Price is really not a factor for him. Thanks in advance!
6223878,nicko,2018-07-20 10:40:00,508,"I'd look at Totem resorts Wiley point lodge. Headed there in 2 weeks. Remote enough to be lightly pressured, decent boats and a great lodge and waters. Food is fantastic. Actually too much IMO. Its a great area with almost no pressure due to distance from other lodges.www.totemresorts.com"
6223898,BreezyPoint,2018-07-20 10:59:00,1581,"I would definitely look at Obabikon Bay Out of Morson, ON on Lake of the Woods. Beautiful camp, great setting in the heart of great LOTW fishing.http://obabikon.comFrank"

6223982,pjshorthorn,2018-07-20 13:00:00,5654,Silver Water Wheel - Lac Seul Lost Island Lodge - Lac Seul Hawk Lake Lodge - Hawk Lake Others already mentioned are also great suggestions as well. PjShorthorn
6223986,Weby13,2018-07-20 13:05:00,57,I should Add that he is not an experienced fishermen so places that are easier to catch fish would probably be best.
6223988,pjshorthorn,2018-07-20 13:10:00,5654,Most of the Lodges already noted have great guide services available as well. Great way to learn fishing for different species of fish in NW Ontario. PjShorthorn
6224086,3 Z's,2018-07-20 15:50:00,133,Witch Bay Camp on LOTW. My kids love it. It's a drive that is remote enough it has the feel of a fly in. Full service including fish cleaning. Guides are included in the price.
6224132,Obabikon,2018-07-20 18:35:00,2370,"http://tetuislandlodge.com/ Ed runs a great resort. Great dude. To be honest... for the guys that ""price doesn't matter"" we probably aren't fancy enough. We have good boats, and great meals. Fancy with nice boats on Lake of the Woods is Totem/Wiley Point"
