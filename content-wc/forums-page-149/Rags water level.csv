6224300,Slim03,2018-07-21 08:53:00,159,No problem 4th of July. Be finding out how it is again in 6 days.
6224418,mwh624,2018-07-21 14:54:00,183,Was fine a week ago. Water seemed to be down about 2 feet.
6224488,Slim03,2018-07-21 18:38:00,159,How was the fishing?
6224518,mwh624,2018-07-21 20:48:00,183,"Fishing was average. Good numbers, but lots of little ones. Battled wind that kept us from the main basin 2 of the 4 days though. Fish anywhere from 18-30 ft."
6224536,x4flatfish,2018-07-21 21:41:00,319,"Curious as to what you consider the ""main basin""? If you are running thru the rags you must be launching from Hudson or Deception? How much further are you going?"
