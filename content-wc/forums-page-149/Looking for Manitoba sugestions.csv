6222894,Darrenf442,2018-07-18 11:06:00,1369,"My wife lived in Flin Flon and had no issues with the water, most pipes are above ground since it all rock. Jan lake is good but there are two places to stay, one has crappy cabins one has nice ones. Both are hard to get. If you go to Flin Flon there is tons of places to go, like bakers narrows . More lakes then you can shake a stick at and all or good.http://www.bakersnarrowslodge.com/"
6222934,Carnhzkr,2018-07-18 11:57:00,964,"Sorry, Darren. That was just a poor attempt at a joke. It was a huge story in The States last year (or was that two years ago?) when it was discovered that there was lead in the water pipes in Flint, Michigan. It was the first thing I thought of when I saw a reference to ""Flint"" Flon. I'm sure the water in Flin Flon is wonderful."
6222976,bowtech840,2018-07-18 13:36:00,111,"Check out moak lodge. I've went the last 5 years and it's great. It's located on cedar (cross bay) so it is a trophy fishery. Can't keep any walleye over 21.5"" Our group caught 3 over 30"" last june and 15-20 over 27"". If you are into numbers and eaters you can trailer the boat about 4 miles back into town (Grand Rapids) and fish the river. Easily catch 100 walleye (15""-19"") in a couple hours. Chris is the owner and is very helpful. http://www.moaklodge.ca/Site/Welcome.htmlSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
