6221502,reup,2018-07-14 15:29:00,35,I just got back yesterday from Lake of the Woods 20 miles west of Morson and about 7 miles east of Oak Island. Camping five nights on an island. Very heavy mayfly hatch leaving billions of spent mayflies on the water. These were not hexagenia but a smaller about size 8 fly. The weather was 2 days of heavy wind and one day of no wind and bluebird skies so we were somewhat limited as to where we could fish on windy days. We fished almost entirely plastic lures and no live bait. Our boat of three fishermen averaged about 60 fish per day with a good number of 24 to 27 inch walleye. Every fish we cleaned was packed with crayfish and crayfish lures worked but not as productive as minnow baits. 3 to 5 inch Plastics seem to be the ticket. I would say the health of the resource looks good in that we caught a variety of sizes of fish. Our biggest northern was 37 in . We also caught about 10 smallmouth bass with two 18-inch included. I have to say that the Lake of the Woods walleye seem to be some of the best tasting fish I have ever eaten. I wonder if their diet of crayfish causes them to be so mild.

6221710,Bill Krejca,2018-07-15 07:33:00,6107,Nice report. Some of my best memories are time spent camping on LOW. Bill
6222668,jboutdoorguy,2018-07-17 18:49:00,81,Thanks for the report. I'll be heading up in a week and a half. How is the water levels up there this year?
6222694,Hook_settr,2018-07-17 20:03:00,127,I was told by a resort owner this weekend that lake levels are back to normal.
6222782,reup,2018-07-18 07:15:00,35,Water levels were about the same as last year at this time. Most productive areas were offshore structures near deepwater and rockpiles.
6222794,The tank,2018-07-18 07:36:00,340,We stay in milesbay every year and we thought the water was 1 foot low yet last week. Were basing this on the rock piles just out side of thompson creek. The one on the left was just under water and its normally a foot and a half under water. The big rock pile was showing rocks in between them that are normally not showing.
6222826,Obabikon,2018-07-18 08:28:00,2370,"Water levels have come up quite a bit, but that is expected this time of year. According to the charts, the lake is somewhere between 6""-12"" lower than average.https://www.lwcb.ca/pdf/LakeoftheWoo...2018.07.17.pdf They have been letting very little water out."
6222950,jboutdoorguy,2018-07-18 12:41:00,81,Thanks everyone. Any muskie reports?
