There was minor road construction in one place on Highway 105 between Red Lake and Ear Falls. The delay was less than five minutes. There were flaggers working this construction zone.There was no construction on Highway 502. As noted in a previous thread, the outer edge of the southbound lane is showing considerable wear in places along this roadway.The overpass on the roadway as you leave the east side of Fort Frances is under construction. This overpass is a few blocks from Rainy Lake Sports. There are red/yellow/green traffic signals controlling traffic. This delay was also less than five minutes.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
