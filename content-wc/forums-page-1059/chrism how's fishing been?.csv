I think I might have passed you on the river a few times this spring. How have you found the fishing to be out there? Been pretty good for me, although the weather has messed things up a bit.River eye"

Although, on the crappiest day ever (rained non-stop all day and really cold) had the best walleye fishing I've had in a couple years, all over 15"", and a couple monsters. Actually, I think the high water level has helped the fishing a bit on the really hot and still days.River eye"
