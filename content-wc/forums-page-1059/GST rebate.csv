509056,Guest,2000-07-14 11:18:00,0,Im trying to fill out my form for my GST rebate from my recent trip to Eagle Lake.Everything at the resort I stayed at was done in U.S currency.My reciepts break down the GST I paid but shows it in U.S. Do I have to convert that to the Canadian rate of the day I paid it for the rebate form? Also will they refund me Canadian or U.S ?There is no metion of the exchange on the instructions. Any advice ?Thanks

The Duty free shop converts it to Can funds for the rebate then you have to exchange that for US funds. I would call them to get an explanation as to how they want it done. If they send you Can funds, you can go to most major banks (in larger cities) and exchange it. Shoot, if you headed back up next year, just keep it. The rates right now are pretty decent."
509059,fishinnut,2000-07-16 17:56:00,642,Just make sure to circle the GST paid on your receipt and write next to it US currency. I had no problem last year. A check was sent USC.

509061,Guest,2000-07-19 08:49:00,0,"The resort gave it to me when I paid my bill.But there is a phone # on it you can call ,try 902-432-5608 from outside Canada,or 800-668-4748 inside Canada."

509063,Jesse-WI,2000-07-19 17:45:00,534,"Anything that is not consummed in Canada and the receipt is $50 or more. Cabin, hotel, souvenirs, etc"
