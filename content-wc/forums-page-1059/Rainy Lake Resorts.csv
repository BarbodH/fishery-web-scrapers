I'm looking for a resort that has a sand beach for the wife & kids to enjoy when I'm out fishing. Also I have a 16 foot boat with a 25hp motor so I would like a resort close to some of the better fishing spots,(also helps for those 1 to 2 hour mini-trips on the lake!!)Please give me your first-hand recommendations & also places to avoid, if I do this right I may convince the family to do this again!! Looking forward to your help so I can start planning for summer 2001. Thanks, Steve"
508946,Guest,2000-07-09 19:58:00,0,"I have been going to Coppens Resort for many years.No mice, hot tub, and a beach. What really keeps me going back is the friendly, family ran people who make the stay comfortable. They are located in Bear Pass Ontario. I won't point at a map, but there is some pretty good fishing close to camp."
508947,Guest,2000-07-10 13:29:00,0,For the US side my recomendation is Island View Resort. International Falls. One other consideration would be to rent a houseboat. That way you can drive to your own private sand beach and be close to the local fishing hole. TGG
508948,Brownie,2000-07-13 06:41:00,12,"We stayed at Coppens a few years back. It is nice and clean. We were there for the fishing, and quite frankly I did not pay much attention to the amenities a wife and kid might be interested in. The smallmouth fishing in Swell Bay, which is relatively close, was exceptional. Lots of large fish, and good numbers. Decent northern, but we struggled with the walleye. Part of that was due to the time of year -- we were there in early June. If you are adventuresome, I would suggest taking a houseboat. Rainy Lake Houseboats is as good as it gets. With a houseboat, you can pull up on a sandy beach, close to anywhere you want to go fishing. However, the wife and kid would not be able to run into town very easy. Good luck."
508950,Guest,2000-07-13 16:44:00,0,"Rainy Lake Lodge. It's only a few miles east of International falls. Family can go to town and shop. They have a beach and playground equipment. It's in a good walleye, pike and smallmouth area. If you go before the middle of June, big black crappies can be fairly easy."
508949,Guest,2000-07-15 23:12:00,0,"I'll second the recommendation for Coppens resort. Nice cabins, sand beach, canoes and paddle boats for the kids to play with. Good people running the place, good service. Close to both Seine and Swell bays to the south and Red Gut bay to the north. When the wind and weather get bad, you can stay right in the channel near camp and catch fish within a 1/2 mi. or so. Ask how to get to Hole-In-The-Wall; spectacular scenery (fish too!). Good luck."
508951,Guest,2000-07-17 09:52:00,0,The only downside to the Canadian side of Rainy is the one fish a day limit for Walleye for US citizens. This makes it impossible to have a fish meal each day and have a limit of 4 to take home. TGG
