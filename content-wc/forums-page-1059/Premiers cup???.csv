You can give give them a call if you like. You'll probably have to leave a message, but they're pretty fast at getting back to you. Anyway, if they cashed your check it probably means your in. Cheers.Dave"
509143,Guest,2000-07-19 21:54:00,0,"Hey Dave,Ya i think were in, plus i am assuming they got my entry since i am on the mailing list.Why so few entries?? Do you think it is the size limit? Hopefully they get some more teams in there, but it should be fun anyhow!Joe"
