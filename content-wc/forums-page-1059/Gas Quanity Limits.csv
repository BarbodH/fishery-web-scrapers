509025,Guest,2000-07-12 13:27:00,0,I tried earlier with no luck. How many gallons of gas can I bring into Canada besides what my built in boat tank holds? How long have the lines been to get through at FT. Frances? I will be going up on the 21st of July and should reach the border around 6:00pm on the 21st. We are fishing west of Minaki at Cygnet Lake and its a long and bumpy ride into town to get gas.
509026,Guest,2000-07-12 13:38:00,0,We've been following what we were told at the border several years ago. That is whatever you're boat's tank will hold plus 12 gallons in portables. I am not aware that it has changed.
509027,KnottyBuoy,2000-07-12 13:49:00,110,We have crossed 3 times so far this year and even the 2 or 3 times last year I can't remember them asking if were were carrying extra gas.....the question of the year seems to be if we are leaving the boat in Canada........have never been asked that before but twice so far this year....If you are going that far up I think they would allow you the extra fuel.....
509028,Guest,2000-07-12 15:04:00,0,"Tank full in boat and tank full in truck. That's it. Any more will cost dearly. My neighbor fessed up last year with 6 gallons x-tra, I think it cost him about 8 dollars American. Might have been cheaper to burn the Crown Royal! Depends what time you will be crossing the boarder, buisest time is Sat. morning 8:00 am to noon other than that expect about 15 - 20 min. Plan ahead!"
509029,Jesse-WI,2000-07-12 18:32:00,534,"You are allowed a ""reasonable amount"". This term is usually defined as all primary and secondary, if present, tanks full. So if you usually travel with 2 tanks in your boat, they could both be full."
509030,Guest,2000-07-12 20:14:00,0,"I have been instructed by the border mounties that you are allowed only what the vehicle tank and boats internal/external tank will hold. That means that any spare gas in gas cans (or as they call em ""jerry cans"") is extra. Extra gas is then subject to duty tax. In my 15+ trips, I have only been questioned about spare gas 2 times. Always wondered, to me spare gas is like spare money, never have extra of either!"
509031,Eyesore,2000-07-12 23:51:00,455,"Andy, simply choose the post you like best, and go with it, as it is quite obvious that you can get just about any answer you wish, from reading the above replys. My 2 cents; If its cheaper in the US, then some sort of tax will be imposed at the border. Thats just my untaxed opinion. Hope your trip is a good one. 10-4"
509032,Sabaskong,2000-07-13 05:26:00,3,"I have a cabin at Lake of the Woods and transport gas across the border at Rainy River nearly every weekend. I have been told that they generally allow you to take as much gas as you can ""reasonably"" expect to use during your stay. I generally take 4-5 extra cans, and seldom get asked about gas. That said, I know of one case this spring where a guy had to pay duty on 10 gallons. I think it depends on the customs officer's mood."
509033,Guest,2000-07-13 09:12:00,0,"2 years ago my buddy was trailering up his sleds and when asked, told Customs he had 30 gallons. It was the only time in 25 years he had been asked or inspected. They were kind enough to let him leave it in the containers at Customs and he picked it up when he returned, otherwise, they said he'd have to pay the duty."
509034,Planocat,2000-07-17 00:41:00,473,"One year I had some young snit at the border who asked me how much gas I had in my Ranger's built in tank. I told her I didn't really know, but would guess about 10 gallons.She made me pay duty on that 10 gallons. In 15 years of going to Canada, that was the only time I have ever heard of that, but it happened.Thank goodness I didn't tell her it actually had 52 gallons!"
