509090,Karl,2000-07-16 21:19:00,63,"Just got back from Sioux Lookout area. Fishing was excellent. Leeches on Lindy rigs, minnows on jigs, and white power grubs on jigs all produced well, in that order. More fish over 21 inches than in previous eight years. Walleyes were still near spawning areas, in 8 to 14 feet of water, in bays were the wind was blowing in. Shad raps and Risto raps didn't produce anywhere near like last year. Water was 66 to 68 degrees."
