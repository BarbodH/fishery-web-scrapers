Just read your message this morning. Am leaving for Lac Suel, Wapesi Bay in 24 hours. Whats the secrets this time of year up there?!"

Follow the southern most point out straight west and you will note that there is a huge flat that is 20'-25' deep. Follow the outside drop all around the perimeter and troll with bottom bouncers and crawlers or minnows. We average 30-50 fish a day from there 20-28"" + there are HUGE muskies on that flat as well as some big pike. I am usually there in July. This year I can't make it till Sept. first. Are you doing the houseboat thing or Andersons fly ins?Would like to know how you did when you return. Good luck!"
