Not much on size but numbers were just crazy. Also, there's a ton of large northern. Look in the back weedy bays and bring poloroid glasses. You can see them laying up against the bank. Any good structure will hold fish. Some of the best was right on top of the camp. Also, the area where the river comes in was just great anytime it was rainy and overcast."
