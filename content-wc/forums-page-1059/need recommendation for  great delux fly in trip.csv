We fly out of Pickle Lake about 5 Hrs NW of Thunder Bay.The Outfitter is Mocassin Trails. All the camps are the lone camp on the lake, most are pretty big water or really big water, most are new or newer camps - well equipped. The two camps we have been to were equipped with solar power, showers, screened porches etc etc.We have never had a problem putting 60-100 fish in the boat a day. Havnt caught any really big walleyes (but then again I could be spoiled living near the Saginaw Bay) but there are tons in the 2-4 lb range and the pike are so numerous you will certainly be a believer in single barbless hooks. This year 15 fish on 15 consecutive casts took the kitty !!I dont have the phone number handy but you need to speak with Jack Rezny. They have an outdated website, that is currently under construction, at www.nonta.net look under fishing lodges there should be a phone number there. If you have any trouble and want more info u can reach me at [email protected]."
