509102,Karl,2000-07-17 21:12:00,63,"Just got back from second trip this year to Sioux Lookout area (Minnitaki Lake). Fishing was excellent on both trips. Leeches on Lindy rigs, minnows on jigs, and white power grubs on jigs all produced well, in that order. More fish over 21 inches than in previous eight years. Walleyes were still near spawning areas, in 8 to 14 feet of water, in bays were the wind was blowing in. Shad raps and Risto raps didn't produce anywhere near like last year. Water was 66 to 68 degrees. Air temp was low 80's when the sun was out (it wasn't most of the time). Rain in forecast every day. Exceptionally high water levels this year, lot's of logs floating in the lake - keep an eye open for them."
