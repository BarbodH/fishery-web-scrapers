509045,Guest,2000-07-13 09:10:00,0,"I am going on a fly-in fishing trip several weeks from now and am planning on taking two FRS radios so the boats can communicate (what lures is hot, time to hit shore for lunch, general safety, etc.). Was wondering if anyone else does this? Seems like a great idea."
509046,Guest,2000-07-13 10:01:00,0,yes-they work great
509047,Guest,2000-07-13 10:14:00,0,I read somewhere that the use of FRS radios in Canada is illegal. Maybe others can comment???
509048,Frank from TBay,2000-07-13 20:00:00,312,We use TalkAbout radios on our trips in NW Ontario and they are great. This is the first I have heard that are illegal.We have been checked by the MNR and the radios were in plain view and nothing was said. They are an excellant tool and a good emergency tool as well. With their limited range and being in a wilderness area I think it is a non issue.Radios in Canada are a federal issue and the odds of meeting a federal officer in the bush in Ontario is about 0. Good fishing: Frank
509049,Guest,2000-07-14 06:52:00,0,"Actually, that is why I wrote the original note...I wanted to see what everyone thought of the so called ""Illegality"" of using these. My buddies got kind of gunshy when they saw some information saying that they were not allowed, etc. Personally, I cannot see a MNR officer arresting you for having a radio (read safety device) in your boat. I will be taking them with me. We have had some experiences in the past that could have been life threatening (extreme severe weather) and they would have added a huge safety factor and peace of mind."
509050,Paul H,2000-07-15 14:52:00,1232,They were approved early this year. However can't cite the source. Ham operator - N8Pff - saw it somewhere.Will have a set w/ me in 1 nonth
509051,chrism,2000-07-16 16:08:00,429,"FRS radios are now legal to operate in Canada. They work great out fishing, I have used mine all of this season and seem to get 3 mile range if the other radio is in sight, and about 3/4 to one mile when going over land."
509052,Guest,2000-07-17 09:01:00,0,Just got back from the Vermillion Bay area and we used our radios all the time. Sure where a great help as one of the boats had a breakdown and we were able to locate them using the radios. Take them along and have some fun as well as increasing your safety margin
