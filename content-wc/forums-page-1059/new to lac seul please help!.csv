508876,Guest,2000-07-01 20:05:00,0,"Tried to e-mail this but the address is incorrect that is listed on your post.Here is the run down.....I was up there 6/11 - 6/23 @ Goose Bay camp (same area) about 5 miles south by water. The following is a post to another guy who is headed up 7/8. E-mail him @ [email protected] 7/16-17 to get the latest update on the fishing if it's not to late. Weather..It rained the 10 days prior to us getting there and it rained for another 9 days plus a bonus of 1 day of snow/rain mix! So out of 12 possible days of fishing I was able to get in 8 full days of soggy fishing 2 1/2 days of sunshine and 2 1/2 days sitting in the cabin wondering if it was ever going to clear up! (Ended up taking the wife to Red Lake and Dryden to shop. Scored brownie points! ) Temps were cooler than normal only 2 afternoons that I had a T shirt on w/ long pants. Friday 6/16 it snowed 2-3"" and the morning temp was 45 w/rain and dropped as the day progressed, by 9am it was in the upper 30's and by 11 am it was in the lower 30's w/sleet changing to snow. By then my hands wouldn't function to put a minnow on the hook so I packed it up and went back to the cabin to warm up. Water temps1st week 55~~>52 main lake 60~~>55 shallow bays2nd week 52~~>60 "" "" 55~~>63 "" ""Fishing!st weekMost fish were in 10-18' of water due to the wonderful weather conditions. They were really scattered, you could catch a few here and there. Average haul out of 1 spot was 6-10 fish. Then it was time to move onto another spot. I tried like ##### to figure out a pattern but was not able to. I caught fish just about in any situation. Rock, sand, weeds, boulders, flats you name it and there was a few fish to be had. The only pattern was the windy side of islands, points etc. The only place I could eliminate was the shallow spawn areas! Made it very challenging to say the least.I was able to catch 2 fish over 24"" that week, 1-25"" 1-271/2"" bucket loads of 12-15"" eyes. Couldn't believe the quantify in that size range!Areas fished.Steamboat bay, McKenzie bay (clay banks & deer Island area) Ghost Narrows, Cox Island and small island around that area and Saw Mill bay. Best producing areas were Steamboat bay and islands around Cox IslandMethods of catching fishTotally fished spinners w/bottom bouncer. Best blade colors Chartreuse or orange/chartruse combo and brass. Tried to jig but with the fish scattered so much it was a lost cause.2nd weekFishing improved somewhat. Fished the same areas as above but as the week progressed the fish moved into shallower water. 8-12'. Friday was a clear day with a slight breeze and could not really catch crap the whole morning into the afternoon! The breeze kicked up some more and I thought that would help....wrong! I tried everything went deeper and nothing. Tried every color blade I had and nothing, worked the banks perpendicular to find fish and nothing! I was really frustrated by 1 pm only catching less than 10 small fish! Scratched my noodle and started to do some really serious thinking and remembered what some of the info I had read about eye. Rule #1 the eyes are probably in shallower water than you think.... So, with that in mind and since nothing else was working I proceeded to work 8-6', 6-4' 4-2' ranges. Guess what???? I freaking found the mother load in the 2-4'range! Go figure after 2 weeks of fishing in the 10-16' range the eyes moved to the inside weed line! That ##### Infisherman magazine saved the day! If you would go to the outside weed line the northers would hammer the spinner rigs with an occasional walleye but go inside the weed line and BINGO! I used the electric trolling motor to pull the rigs in the shallows and use the scarecrow method. What the ##### is that? Held my arm out @ a 90 degree angle dropped out enough line so bouncer would hit bottom in 4' of water and raise and lower my arm to adjust for bottom depth! It worked so ##### well that I still am kicking my self in the butt for not trying the shallows sooner! Those ##### fish probably were in the shallows for the whole last week and no body figured out that pattern.Other infoSaw the beginnings of the mayfly hatch on Friday 6/23 my guess is that they will probably peak next week into the following week.Minnows haven't spawned yet...ask the resort owners if they are when you up, if so get into the shallow sandy bays on the windy side! Look inside the weedline!Gas @ resort 4.00 US p/gallon. .89 liter @ EarFalls .77 liter @ Vermillion bay.3.78 liters = 1 US gallon. I took up 6-5 gallon gas cans and went into town to fill up the boat. Exchange rate 1.40 - 1.48 McKenzie Bay clay banks did produce some decent quantities of fish for others, but I never really got into the better days. My best day up there was 5 over the slot and 7 in the slot and bucket loads of 12-14 ""ers.I was up last year the 2-3rd week in July. The fishing was great. Most fish were caught down the lake in McKenzie Bay. As the summer progresses the fish tend to migrate down the lake from the area where your staying. (That area is awesome in early June and late Sept) Last year I caught all my fish on spinner rigs w/minnows in 8-14' range and trolling crank baits. The minnows were just getting done spawning in the shallows thus the eyes were starting to head to the deeper waters.. ie the reefs etc. Reccomend tha tyou get a good map. There are 2 places in Ear Falls for decent maps, 4 Seasons bait shop or Smitty's. Get one that shows bottom contours which will help locating reefs or similar areas that people are catching fish. Also eliminates many areas that the fish aren't in!If you have any other questions, feel free to write.Set the hook!"
508877,Guest,2000-07-02 15:09:00,0,thanks for the great responce will let you know how we did. we are traveling 1500 miles so we hope for good fishing. again thanks.
508878,Guest,2000-07-03 20:15:00,0,GREAT REPORT! GOING UP 7/8 STAYING @ FISHERMENS COVE. NEVER TRIED FISHING SHALLOW BUT ARE SURE TO TRY IT THIS TIME!
508879,Go_Fish,2000-07-05 10:25:00,28,"Grumbler,Could you do me a favor? Say ""hi"" to my dad, brother, and nephew while you are in Fisherman's Cove. They are up there now and I think that 7/8/00 will be there last day. My dad's boat is a 20 ft red Lund, with a 50 Hp Merc 4 stroke. They are driving a green Ford pick-up with a black topper. His name is Phil, and he could probably give you an up-dated fish report. Thanks A Bunch!Go_Fish"
508882,Guest,2000-07-05 12:22:00,0,"Golden Fawn is a nice place to stay. I've been there a couple of times and I would go back. Cabins are well maintained and updated with all the amenities. I would say that in mid-July your best chances would be around Cox's island and in Steamboat Bay. You can also venture down to McKenzie Bay if you wish. You will see some other boats in the Cox's island area, so make note of their locations and move in when they leave. Any point around the island holds fish, although main channel points are best. Any point or reef holds fish in Steamboat. Ted at the resort can give you some spots to try. McKenzie Bay is filled with islands, and can be a little harder to find fish, but when you do you won't have to move as there will be plenty of them. I rarely venture down to McKenzie. I've also found that early AM and late afternoon produces best on clear days. Cloudy days produce all day. Use spinners and crawlers or minnows. If you find concentrations of the W's, use jigs and minnows. If you choose minnows as your primary bait, make sure you have the crawlers along. I rarely use leeches at Lac Suel although many other fisherman do and they work well. I've never found color to be a factor, but I generally use hammered brass and red spinners. I use pink or orange jigs. Have a great time the weather is usually pretty good in mid-July. But................be prepared. TGG"
508887,Guest,2000-07-12 20:21:00,0,I can't complain.... this is the first trip where I wished that it would quit raining! Gets real old being soggy once you walk out of the cabin till ya return that evening. Makes shore lunches quite challenging not to mention wet sandwiches & chips are not very appealing! Good thing I threw the patio umbrella under the seats! Be prepared!Hope your Aug trip is sucessful!Set the hook!
508880,Guest,2000-07-16 08:54:00,0,"GO FISH SORRY I MISSED YOUR DAD DIDN'T LOOK BACK AT THE BOARD AS I HAD ALL I COULD DO PACKING AND PREPAIRING MEALS.ANY RATE FISHING WAS TOUGHER THAN I HAD SEEN IT IN MANY YEARS, LAKE WAS HIGH, WATER VERY CLOUDY,HOWEVER I TRIED NEW SPOTS AND FOUND FISH LIKE ONE OF THE PREVOIS POSTS INSIDE WEED LINES VERY SHALLOW.WE HAD ONY A PARTY OF 4 PEOPLE THIS TIME. WE ONLY HAD 18 FISH OVER THE SLOT WITH THE BIGGEST 9.2 LBS. ALL THESE BIGGER FISH CAME ON WINDY (VERY) SIDE OF ISLANDS IN BIG ROCKS 7' DEEP.WE DIDN""T GET MANY (31) FISH IN THE SLOT, OR MANY 17"" FISH, JUST A LOT OF SMALL WALLEYE, ALSO HAD ENOUGH ONE DAY FOR A PERCH SHORE LUNCH.ALL GOOD SIZE FOR THAT WATER. ALL OVER SLOT FISH WERE PHOTO/RELEASE!AM LOOKING FORWARD TO NEXT YEAR ALREADY"
508881,Go_Fish,2000-07-17 15:02:00,28,"Grumbler,Thanks anyway...I'm glad to hear that you had a decent trip and congrats on your big fish! Go_Fish"
508883,JJ,2000-07-10 15:33:00,72,"Sam, What day are you leaving for Ear Falls?"
508884,Jesse-WI,2000-07-11 13:16:00,534,July 2nd Broad Lake - 9am - 11:00am: marked fish deep but could only get 1 decent size pike to bite. Other boatpitched jigs/minnows at the shoreline with only 1 small eye to show.11:00am - 11:30pm: We move shallow and start pulling spinners/crawlers where the one small eye was caught. A pattern starts to develop. Our first pass catches 5 eyes.11:30 - 2:30pm: Both boats have limited out on eating size walleyes and have released manysmaller eyes. The magic depth is 5 ft. We used bottombouncers/crawlers and speed other boatuses lindy rigs/minnows and slow trolling. The 5ft area we fish transistions from rock to mud.This break line turns out to be the spot. Several slots are caught but nothing over slot. The day is calm and hot. Leeches seem to only catch pike. Most crawler rigs are catching on thefront hook with full crawlers being used.July 3rd Broad Lake -9am - 10am: We learn the reason for the deep eyes not biting. Mayflies abound in our fishing area. The wind is blowing them right into our area. The fishing is slow and bits are slow.10am - 11am: We realize bites are only coming when we travel against the wind. We put the kickermoter up and lower the electric trolling motor. Our much slower speed results in many more fishalthough not as good as the prior day. 12am - 4pm: 4.5ft or 7.3 ft are the depths that produce the most fish this day. Equal numbersand size are caught on minnows/leeches/crawlers. Crawlers rigs are producing on the second hook this day. Numbers of fish are about equal but it takes longer. The deep fish seem to preferminnows and the shallow fish like crawlers.July 4th Scout Lake Area -We are pike fishing today but find an interesting walleye pattern. We are casting rapela huskyjerks and deep diving husky jerks into cabbage. The sky is blue with lite wind. We startcatching slot walleyes in 7ft of water just inside the weed edge. We are using stiff rods andspiderwire/fireline to rip the lures through the cabbage. We are unable to reproduce this bite onany other day. The water rises over a foot during the week.July 5th Scout Lake Area -Pike fishing and bad weather. No eyes spotted.July 6th Steamboat Bay -Overcast and windy. The wind is blowing towards the narrows.We make several passes(casting) with rapela's to determine fish activity. A few small pike andseveral slot eyes are caught. It appears the eyes are close to shore. We anchor the boat indeep water and let the wind carry us to 5 feet of water. The other boat anchors in 7ft of waterin a small pocket. We use plain lead color jigs and leeches casting parrallel to shore. Rock rubble gives way to solid rock in about 4 feet of water. Fish shallower and loose the jig on almost every cast. We catch lots of fish including 5 over slot. Largest is 24.5. The other boat used yellow lindy jigs and bodies/minnows and fishes under the boat. They also have good luck.We were also able to take several fish in a creek channel that went from clay to mud and grass.Bait does not seem to matter as long as weed edge contact is made.July 7th Steamboat Bay -Large storms the previous nite leads to a late start time. We fish the same areas with similarresults. The fish do prefer color on the jigs today. We use minnows/leeches/crawler pieces andeveryone catches fish. Bait prices:Leeches run $20-$25CDN/lb and crawlers $2.5 CDN/dz in Ear Falls and Vermillion Bay. The minnows from town run $2.95/dz CDN placed in oxygen filled bag. These minnows do catch more fish for us. The size and color are better. RoadWe ignore advice and travel on 502 south of Dryden. The road had about 20 miles of dirt/mud and many construction stops. This project is to continue until fall. If Dryden can be avoided I suggest you take 17 through Sioux Narrows instead.
508885,Guest,2000-07-11 20:35:00,0,Hey Jes..Glad to hear that your trip had some decent weather and the fish were biting. The mayflies were just starting to appear when I left 6/23 and figured that they would be peaking the next week or so. Is the lake still high due to all the rain?Thanks for the post...Hope to be back up in Sept!
508886,Jesse-WI,2000-07-11 21:07:00,534,The lake was high and was getting higher. Most of my old spots were too deep to fish this time around. The Scout Lake area rose about 6-9 inches just during the week. Those PWT tournment experiences are finally paying off.Hope your next trip has better weather. I'm going to Eagle Lake 3rd week of August.
