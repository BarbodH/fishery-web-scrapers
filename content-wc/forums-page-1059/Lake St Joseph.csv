509093,Lobo,2000-07-17 01:07:00,3,Is the fishing here as good as I have heard ? Anybody know the names of the camps ? There are supposed to be 4 camps - I have found the Old Post and Camp St Joseph there are 2 more. Anybody Know where I can get a map of this lake ?? Thanks in advance.
509094,KnottyBuoy,2000-07-17 05:31:00,110,Just got back from there last week.........We stayed at Lake St. Joseph Camp and it is an excellent resort.......the Old Post is just down the shore from there.......Those are the only 2 camps I know of on the lake........Fishing was excellent.......no real big fish but lots in the 18 to 21 inch range. Very dangerous to navigate right now. Water is about 2 feet high which puts the rocks that used to be exposed just below the surface. Lots of lower units are going to need some repair. They have lake maps avaiable at the resort. Never could find one anywhere else.
509095,Guest,2000-07-17 14:50:00,0,"thanks for the help; we're trying to decide if St joe will be a good replacement for our fly in trip. It is cheaper, if you dont have to buy a new lower unit !!"
509096,KnottyBuoy,2000-07-18 06:49:00,110,Would be cheaper than a fly in.......unless you take out your lower unit......The resort said they loose 2 or 3 every week.....! They knicked us pretty good on price.....Was suppose to be $280 each for 4 days.......by the time they added in docking fees......ramping fees.....parking fees......walking fees......etc....etc... it came out to $400 each...We figured it would have been the same price to use their boat......But the walleyes are in there......clear water and the fish have that beautiful golden color......plus a nice pike occasionally.
509097,Fred_G,2000-07-18 07:34:00,908,"Check out the other camp on the lake, The Old Post & Village. Their web address is www.oldpost.com. We have been going there for 3 years and will be up there again in about 2 weeks. The camp is great and the service is second to none. As for the fishing, I have never found any better. Check it out. I think you'll like it. LOL Fred"
509098,Lobo,2000-07-18 11:29:00,3,I've been to oldpost.com and have spoken to the folks there as well as the other camp. Everything I can find sounds really good for a drive in lake. We generally fly out of this area and have grown accustomed to the friendly glacier deposits (rocks). Give an update when you get back. I'm mainly concerned with having to run 30 miles to be in a better than average spot to catch fish (this is generally when we run into problems with rocks - when we are trying to get back close to camp when the sun is finally setting).Some others I have considered are Witch Bay on the woods and Osbourne on Eagle Lk.Thanks
509099,KnottyBuoy,2000-07-19 05:26:00,110,There were people there during our stay that were running 20 to 30 miles up the lake and I didn't hear them say they caught any more or bigger fish than we did.........and we were 6 miles from camp. Someone caught a 30 inch walleye off the dock a few weeks before our stay.......Go figure!
