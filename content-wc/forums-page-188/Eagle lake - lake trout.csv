1305961,Sutsgold,2011-05-12 07:19:00,219,"I will be on Eagle lake from june 4th to 12th. I have never fished for lake trout, but wouldnt mind giving it a shot. Im guessing west end of eagle would be best. Any general advice for the first two weeks of june would be greatly appreciated. Gord, I would love to hear from you."
1306070,v-bay gord,2011-05-12 10:55:00,3168,"Unless we have an unusually cold spring, and surface water temps stay below 52 degrees, your best shot would be Trout Hole 1 or 2. If things are cold then the trout could be scattered in many other areas. I do have some trout tips on my website at http://www.vermilionbaylodge.com/lak...hing-tips.html . Check that out. I think the easiest method would be to use the 3 way rig and troll spoons or crankbaits. Pay close attention to where and at what depth you are seeing fish and work that pattern. Good luck and consider releasing the bigger trout you may catch.....they are very slow growing fish."
1306393,Thumpr50,2011-05-13 08:02:00,139,"It has been several years since I have fished Eagle but did so about the same time (early June) when I did. If you are on the west arm, you may want to look at making a trip up Clearwater Creek to Clearwater Lake (also known as Delano Lake) the creek takes about 45 minutes to navigate (depending on water levels). It has offered some very good lake trout fishing in the past. Vertical jigging Sonars or long-lining rapalas worked for us. you may have to add a little weight to the rapalas get them down, depends on how deep the lakers at at. Good luck!"
1306468,tackleman,2011-05-13 11:42:00,444,"we fish trout on the opening weekend every year and concentrate around trout hole #1, there are spots where you can sit on the shore, run your line out and sit and wait. we have had good luck that way.Clearwater lake is a long boat ride up the creek and it depends on how many beaver dams you have in your way, one year we had 5 and one of them was 4 feet high. Of course other years it's dam free. one thing it isn't free of is tree stumps and dead heads in the creek up there so if you go, take it slow and watch carefully, as you go up the creek water is continally getting clearer and makes looking for hazards easier."
1307028,stevie,2011-05-15 08:53:00,21,"in the fall starting during the later stages of turnover and after turnover the lakers are able to saftly leave the trout holes and while many stay there a large % of the pop. leave migrating,roaming ,and feeding over the north sections of the lake and even somewhat into the central sections of the lake. as the water warms it is a migration back ending up with probably 90% of the eagle lake trout in the trout holes by end of june/early july though portage bay also has a smaller resident pop. so in early june don't be afraid to try the basins leading up the western arm prior to the trout holes also. as gord indicated watch for baifish levels to be one good indicator of what depths to start,others are the depths temps range from 42-50 degrees,the windy side of basins or structures concentrating on edges of big shelves,points,and basin edges but by speeding up into the 1.5-2.0 mph for 20-30' then slowing down to 1.0 or under for 50-60' your bait will rise and fall 10-20' up and down the water column covering more depth options. early june,water temps surface 50-60 you should find fish at 35-50' whether on bottom or suspended over any depth. biggest trout will be relating to bottom,eaters will many times be higher .trolling with cleos,suttons,wolfies,any spoon you can troll with good wobble and flutter under 1.5 mph will work in silver,pearl,blue/green,chart,minnow baits like youzuris,rapalas,etc. use weights on 3 ways or snap weights 4-8oz with same amount of line out to run baits at diff depths. use enough weight to sat from vertical to 45 degrees so you knw how deep you are actually running.14# fireline cuts the water good, a long floro 10-12# floro leader on a longer 8-9' steelhead type rod with a line counter will dial you in and give you good control of where your bait is and duplicating it once a productive combination is found. you can also slowly elect troll,back troll,or even wind drift 3/8-3/4 oz jigs with large minnows,gullet strips,or sucker meat or lindy rigs with suckers or ciscos. the bank fishing tackleman suggested is very effective however we discourage it just because trout gobble dead bait so quickly by the time you get to them that 90%+ of the fish are gut hooked with a very high mortality if released and we stress c/r of trout over 6#. a 20-25#+ trout could very well be older than some peoples fishing lifetime so please consider selective harvest of smaller trout as it is a delicate fishery. if you like the comadarie and relaxing mode of this method and i can't talk you out of it we have found that by using a circle hook held with a loop of line through the eyes of the cisco/sucker and 6"" from the cisco or 1-2"" longer than the length of the bait the hook will be in the trouts mouth even though they have swallowed the bait and the result is a corner of the mouth hooked fish and releaseable if desired.clearwater is as others indicated an excellent option for action and eating size fish and depending where you are staying there are other portage/boat cache options on other outlying lakes off eagle for similar opportunities however the very biggest avg size trout in the area are in eagle so take care of em'. good luck and great times for all! steve AML"

5632122,skindzier,2017-06-26 12:19:00,137,"From Century, you are a long, long way from the Trout holes. They are in the western end of the west arm. If you have your own boat, best bet would probably be to take a day & drop in at the Vermilion Bay ramp. If not, maybe the Century folks would trailer a boat there for you. Looks like they have a trout portage lake too - that may be a better option."
5632130,wooglin,2017-06-26 12:23:00,371,"Ugh, that's what I was figuring....they do have a portage trout lake that looks like it could be a fun excursion. Thanks for the reply."
5634778,fishinnut 3446,2017-06-27 15:30:00,638,"I could be wrong but I think only Gord (Vermillion Bay Lodge) has 2-3 boats there for his guests at the end of the portage. I have taken my boat and a camp boat threw the Clearwater Creek, try around the Island in 25-40fow you'll get them."
5634826,v-bay gord,2017-06-27 16:01:00,3168,"He's talking about a different trout lake that Century Lodge has boats on........I believe it is south east of Osbourne Bay............but you are right, I'm the only camp with boats on Clearwater Lake. It's usually a tough slog up the creek in September though........the 15 minute walk over the portage trail is much nicer."
