5631794,The tank,2017-06-26 08:47:00,340,"It's something that they're working on. If you don't step out of the boat or drop anchor or dock somewhere they're not considering you to be on Canadian soil. It's as clear as mud right know. But the fishing regs still apply. Bait, limits-so on so on"
5633474,txk4,2017-06-27 06:47:00,31,"We have a place on Flag Island and are heading up next week. I am sure the resorts up there will have the scoop on this new law, now that it has been signed, and if it has changed the call in requirements. I will be glad to post what I find out when I return. To the OP's original question. Oak Island Resort seems to have a good reputation. At least I have not heard anything to the contrary up there. I believe that there are new owners in the last couple of years, but would not bet my last dollar on that. When on Oak Island, you can fish either Canada or Minn. Canada has more islands and, with my limited skills, more consistent fishing, but there are a lot of fish caught in Minn. waters every day. The resort will be able to tell you the rules for crossing the border every morning and once you have gone thru the process, it normally is not too big of a deal, but like any border crossing, it depends who you get on the phone. We get RABC permits every year ($30 Canadian) and do not have to call in every morning. If you feel the border issues are too much, Spruce Island Resort would be fishing the same Canadian waters as Oak Island and has a solid reputation also. My brother owns a cabin near Morson, not too far from Obabikon, and they have great fishing there also. Obabikon's reputation on here and in the area is of the highest level, and even though I have not been to his resort, would never hesitate booking with him. He might even be a shorter drive to get to also. Best wishes on your trip, and if you get to the NWA, I am sure you will enjoy it. T"
5633522,erino,2017-06-27 07:10:00,399,"Just got back from Flag Island Resort (just west of Oak). We had a great time and caught lots of fish. We fished the canadian side for 2 days, and then Minnesota side the day so we could bring a MN limit home.This resort has really changed in the past 2 years. The new owners are doing a great job, and their staff is top notch. If your going to the Angle I would recommend calling Flag Island Resort."
5634570,patrick,2017-06-27 14:23:00,277,Erin's we are headed to flag tomorrow whereabouts in Canada did you guys finish if you don't mind me asking
5629482,Mrnovice,2017-06-24 17:05:00,75,Thinking of booking a trip at Oak Island Resort. I did a search but nothing in the last couple years has been mentioned or showed up . Any thoughts of the area? Just looking for a peaceful walleye trip with the guys. Many trips to Canadian lakes but this would be the first summer trip to LOTW
5629506,The tank,2017-06-24 17:36:00,340,I've thought about doing the same. Where I fish when we stay in miles bay isn't that fAR from oak island and it's a nice ride up to yellow girl from there.
5629938,Obabikon,2017-06-25 04:26:00,2370,"If you're going to fish Lake of the Woods... do the Canadian side. Kenora or Morson mostly. You're going to cross the border every single day anyways, so just avoid the hassle and stay there. Just my opinion. That said... https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...rchid=70813786 There's quite a few fishing reports posted. I'm not sure anything about Oak Island Lodge, but since they aren't a Canadian resort, you probably won't find a lot of info about them over here."
5630226,nicko,2017-06-25 08:01:00,508,"Have to agree with Obabikon on this one. Was up there year before last. Lots of big open water. Most of our time was spent up in Canada getting out of wind. The Angle is wide open. We went north, but your gonna spend a a lot of time running. Yellow Girl from the angle is a nice long boat ride. What you save in $$ you'll waste in gas and time. It's a nice area for a cheap trip, just not real suited to the kind of fishing i like to do.With that said, the other issue we had was the 40 miles of gravel, mud road that destroyed my trailer and bow even with a mud guard. I will NEVER make that trip again.I'd go back, if the road gets paved. It is a nice area and I'd love to explore it more, but more prepared next time.Hope that helps."
5630866,Mrnovice,2017-06-25 15:48:00,75,"I'm not sure if I follow. Once I get to the resort, why would I be crossing border each day?"
5630914,IowaWalleye1978,2017-06-25 16:25:00,96,Mrnovice that area is great...we stay at spruce island about 10-15 minutes to the north east of oak. We would stay at oak if spruce was booked up
5630930,Obabikon,2017-06-25 16:33:00,2370,"Oak Island is on the US portion of Lake of the Woods. The better fishing is in the protected portion of the lake... (which is nearly all in Canadian waters). So, you will have to cross the border using a remote border crossing every time you want to go north or east. Spruce Island fish similar waters... but is a Canadian resort."
5630946,IowaWalleye1978,2017-06-25 17:19:00,96,Obabikon did they change the law on the remote border crossing? Thought I read that border lakes are not going to use them anymore you just need the proper license depending on which side you are fishing. I could be completely wrong on this!!!!
5630954,IowaWalleye1978,2017-06-25 17:28:00,96,http://www.newyorkupstate.com/outdoo...dian_side.htmlFound this on WC
5631450,Obabikon,2017-06-26 05:58:00,2370,"I don't that is correct at all, but I haven't crossed by boat in years. Anyone fish the angle this year? Still have to phone in, right?"
