As most of you probably know, if you were up there last week, the weather patterns were all over the place. The bite was definitely off at times, but we usually boated close to 50+ walleyes/day/angler. There was one beautiful evening of fishing when my friend and myself each boated over 50 walleyes in about 3 hours of fishing. Nice average size walleye, most ran 16-19"", with several over 20 inches, and the biggest running 26"" for the week. Used leadheads tipped with minnows almost exclusively. Pike fishing was off and on, but I don't fish for pike all that much. Our biggest pike was 38"" for the week.We did have a bear in camp during the week, and it did ransack the new cook shack, trashing the new gas grill. The bear bit through the water hose leading from the lake up to the cabin, causing the switch on the water pump to burn out. Luckily for us, one of my buddies is an engineer, and he was able to jerry-rig and repair the set up so that it worked just fine.Clear Lake is a relatively small lake, fairly easy to fish and to navigate, and I just love it up there. As much as I love fishing, I really enjoy the fish fries, grilled ribeyes, massive breakfasts, etc. just as much. I would recommend this lake, or any of Dave and Michelle's lakes, without hesitation or reserve. They're great people and go over and above to make sure you have a great vacation.Hard to believe our summer is over, from a Canadian fishing perspective. I do have a boundary waters trip set up for mid-July, though, and the Gunflint trail has always been one of my most favorite places on this earth.I enjoy reading everyone else's reports, and I hope everybody has a great 4th. Thanks!"

It is a 3-minute hop from Cairns Lake, and about 10 minutes from One Pine, Mallette, Herod, and Malaher. Great location, great fishing. I am really hoping to get to fish Herod or One Pine soon."
