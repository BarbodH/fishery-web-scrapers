5614161,Sean Mac,2017-06-16 13:01:00,8,Haven't heard much about the big sand game yet. I know South of the dalles has been pretty good so far. Were catching anywhere from 5-30' last I was out. Caught a 26'' in 5' on a clown xrap.
5614169,Sean Mac,2017-06-16 13:03:00,8,Leaving city soon be out in cpl hours. Let you know when i get there.
5617521,Sean Mac,2017-06-18 23:09:00,8,"2 boats this weekend. Fished South of dalles to myrtle. Saw 12 muskies boated 7 49'' being biggest between all of us, good day. Suday poppers and tubes were working well for smallies 18.5, two 18.25, 17.5 today in few hours trying for them. Main lake/river temps were right about 63."
5628522,wiwalleyefreak,2017-06-24 04:57:00,25,"Caleb, Heading to the Minaki area in a couple of weeks. How did your trip go? Any information that you or others could share about your recent experiences would be appreciated. Interested in Walleyes primarily and depth,bait, etc. Thanks in advance for any help or information."
5632010,Caleb,2017-06-26 10:54:00,36,"Just got back from Minaki. Big sand was really good in 30 ft. in front of sand beach. Many overs and a lot of in the slot eaters. Some big northers up to 36"" and a 44"" musky. The water temp was 62 and the weather was cool and a lot of wind."
5632634,wiwalleyefreak,2017-06-26 17:29:00,25,Thanks for the info Caleb. Do you mind sharing where you stayed? Anyone else have any info?
5633554,Caleb,2017-06-27 07:35:00,36,We stay at Carols cabins which is right next to the bait shop in Minaki
5636282,wiwalleyefreak,2017-06-28 11:23:00,25,CalebWhat were you catching fish on?
5638297,Caleb,2017-06-29 10:58:00,36,All the walleyes were caught on lindy rigs and nightcrawlers. The northerns and even the musky were caught on spinnerbaits
5596985,Caleb,2017-06-08 07:28:00,36,Heading to Minaki next week any reports from there. Thanks for any information
5600265,Sean Mac,2017-06-10 01:06:00,8,"Was out at my place last 4 weeks. Smallmouth bite was really on as of last weekend. xraps husky jerks, spinnerbaits. Tube and topewater were okay also. They were busting bait on the surface all over. Probably nailed 60 smallmouth biggest 18.5 lots in 17's between me and my buddy another 30 or so pike. Some nice size ones too all in about 6 hours Sunday. Nice 26'' walleye on xrap in about 5' also.. Fish mostly between kenora and Gunn usually. Had some nice smallmouth and some nice gators in main bay near black sturgeon. Tried entrance to Macfarlane wasn't that hot but never actually got up river. Macfarlane was arond 62 already most other bays along river were about 58. Found alot of the smallmouth whereever you found good sized steep rock along shorelines but not necessarily deep fished about 5-12' at the most. Cabbage was starting to become more visible in some of the shallows. Big pike still somewhat shallow had couple follows by a few big boys but didnt commit."
5601129,Caleb,2017-06-10 14:06:00,36,"Thanks for all that info. We stay in Minaki and fish from throat rapids north. We fish gun, little sand, and big sand mostly Sometimes we get to roughrock but mostly south of there. Hopefully we do as good as you.Again thanks,Caleb"
5611209,Sean Mac,2017-06-15 01:14:00,8,Ya was better than average day although not uncommon amazing system lots of good days. Hopefully weather is good may see some rain Sunday. Im leaving thursday after work myself. I Fish Darlington bay south of 17a bridge all the way to minaki myself. Haven't fished little or big for awhile just to long of a drive for me usually. Have a place just south of powderpuff north of kenora bridge. Got cpl friends with places just around myrtle rapids also. Good fishing all between have seen cpl nice musky at myrtle last year. Caught a 40 across from my dock fishing for smallmouth few weeks ago by accident. Interested to know how you do up there.
5611265,Thompmd,2017-06-15 03:40:00,320,"Sean Mac,We are coming to Ash Rapids/Shoal lake next week, any word on those areas. My wife/I primarily bass fish but use baits that catch everything like you mentioned."
5612425,Sean Mac,2017-06-15 12:56:00,8,"Not sure what the temps will be in there. Im sure you will still find alot of fish shallow. Id check out alot of the lead in and lead outs to larger bays directly adjacent to the main lake.. shallow islands with saddles. I know it is a pretty clear lake so id go with more natural colors. Blue, grey/silver, gold, white, black. Always have luck in spring with a spoon (Dr.spoon, daredevil 5 diamonds)but that more pike related. husky, xrap, shadrap, poppers, torpedoes, chatterbait, spinnerbaits, mepps lots of tubes. I find the smaller 2.5'' lucky penny to work best myself in spring but just personal preference. 4-5'' senko wacky works well sometimes too."
5613353,Thompmd,2017-06-16 04:42:00,320,"Thank you, that's almost identical to the colors I use with the exception as I have used a ton of crawdad hues. The torpedo has been great in a frog color with a feather tail makes a big difference.Tell me more with a spoon, in 15years of going I haven't made a dozen casts with one? We enjoy catching pike but primarily use spinnerbaits and some larger traps. Matter of fact we were pretty shocked last year at Crow Rock(1st week of July) we could hardly find pike of any kind. Always heard Shoal is excellent for big pike and was hoping to tap into that, especially for my wife."
5613809,woods,2017-06-16 08:55:00,646,Anybody catching any walleyes on Big Sand or Little Sand?
5613841,BMF60,2017-06-16 09:06:00,2,Anyone have any idea what the river channel water temp is as well?
5614145,Sean Mac,2017-06-16 12:58:00,8,"ThompmdI use spoons with big pike quite often. Early i just retrieve it in a constant slow wobble retrieve. As water warms i pick up the pace alittle. Can twitch spoon during retrieve, I also like to pause let the spoon fall and wobble back down foot or two then pickup the retrieve again. If your wanting to fish little deeper cast it let it flutter down 10-15' then pick it up and run it along bottom deeper. I have best luck with 5'' large doctor spoon half silver/nickel blue. red devil, 5 diamonds, johnson silver spoon. Also lucky strike 6'' canoe work great where ever i go. Pike can be much harder to catch when summer time temps step up, the big girls dont like warm water. First week july depending on water temps shallows can be starting to get warm for large pike. Anything big will be gone from back bay spawning areas/bays and will be relating to deeper main lake structure. I never fish less than 12-14' once summer temps start to get up. 14-18' large main lake islands, saddles, points. Find main lake island clusters 2,3,4 islands connected by shallower saddles with rock and weeds throughout your were you wanna be. Although being Mid June still not to warm I would fish areas directly related to the spawning bays but also not far from deeper water 14'+ but nothing to shallow in bays otherwise you start to pick up the warm water hammer handles."
