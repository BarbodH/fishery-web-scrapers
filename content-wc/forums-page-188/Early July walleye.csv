Fished this part of the lake a number of years ago but was there mid June the last time.Not a ton of walleye fishing experience in our group so was looking for tips on structure to focus on this time of year.Plan was to find any deeper weed beds and fish the edges, look for drop offs into deeper water from the shallow bays and any reefs/humps that fall into deeper water and work the humps/edges.Bottom bouncers with spinners/harnesses,troll cranks, some swim baits possibly slip bobbers was my plan until I can find a consistent pattern.Any tips on finding numbers of pike? Not trophy hunting just like to catch numbers.Thanks!"
5636362,Limeyangler,2017-06-28 11:52:00,563,"Interesting you don't mention jigging as part of your plan. I have found that trolling worm harness/lindy/bottom bouncer rigs are great for finding fish but in my opinion jigging with live bait once fish are found is the BEST! I don't even really bother to much with trolling as a good fish finder will tell you if there are fish present, unless you are shallow and even then it is possible to see them with a trained eye. So I look for mid water reefs, wind blown shorelines, and flats that have a nice drop off to between 20' and 35', cruise on the trolling motor until I mark fish/bait fish and drop a jig, I carry a variety of live and plastic baits but have been doing good with large sucker minnows and nightcrawler recently. its been a cold spring and the walleye have been all over the place on Lac Seul, but I went up yesterday and they were there in numbers on their regular summer haunts , just a little lethargic. I don't know the lake you are planning to fish but your intended plan sounds good. ...try everywhere....lol."
5636450,tmramrod91,2017-06-28 12:14:00,15,"Thanks-this is a fly-in camp with camp boats, so no trolling motor, we are renting the fish finders from the outfitter so no clue what the graph will look like other than telling us depth.Certainly will be jigging once we find the fish-weather is looking to be almost identical every day we are there (75 with W winds) so hopefully once we find the pattern it will be refining presentation instead of chasing fish every day.Again, pretty new to walleye-wind blown shore lines. Obviously understand the wind blown part but is there any thing particular you look for in those cases-drop offs, change in bottom?"
5636618,stjoeguy,2017-06-28 13:23:00,979,"First, I'd talk with Verne or Ryan to see what they recommend. Here's a video with Verne talking about fishing St. Joe around Eagle Island: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvSQDhgki-k I haven't fished that end of the lake but I would start with wind blown shorelines and any structure next to deeper water. It looks like that end of the lake is loaded with islands and deep water. I'd be using jigs and twister tails primarily. Maybe troll some rapalas or spoons. Two guys on our recent St. Joe trip trolled every day to find fish and had excellent results. Some times they would stop and jig and other times they just continued to troll. It was their first time on the lake but they said every spot that looked like it should hold fish produced fish. St. Joe is a fish factory that doesn't require live bait in my opinion. I know other groups that use a lot of minnows so everyone has an opinion. I remembered that someone had a post about St. Joe Root Bay on Walleye Central in the past so I did a search. Turns out it was your post from 4 years ago. Whatever you did then should work now. Walleyes may be a bit deeper than mid June but I'd start with whereever you got them then. Our experience this year was that the average size of the walleyes was much larger than in the past. Have a good time and give us a report when you return."
5636642,tmramrod91,2017-06-28 13:35:00,15,"Ya finally was able to get a group together to go back-been too long. We were not nearly adventurous enough on round 1 so want to explore some more. Wasn't sure if a few weeks later in the year would drastically change where they're hanging out-so we'll see.We fished the river outlet (a lot) and it produced loads of fish-planning on running up to where the Cat river comes in from Blackstone, should be another hot spot.i don't get to walleye fish often and love figuring out new techniques/patterns, so definitely looking forward to the trip. That lake can make anyone feel like they know what they're doing...Verne as always is doing right by us and I believe Ryan will be there the first day to do a milk run with us-being shown where to go is great, but so is figuring it out on your own!"
5636722,Guest,2017-06-28 14:03:00,0,Stjoeguy knows his St. Joe. His secret spot there is called the hole in the wall. He will have to explain where it is.
5636802,SmallyNut,2017-06-28 14:34:00,11,"The only advice I would give you is to not trust a forecast that far out, in my experience even the most recent forecasts aren't very accurate in the Bush."
