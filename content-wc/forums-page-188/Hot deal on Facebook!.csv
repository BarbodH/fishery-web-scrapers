5632418,That Minnesota guy,2017-06-26 15:04:00,8293,What is this Facebook you speak of?
5632506,wallydave,2017-06-26 15:53:00,2151,"If I have to explain, you wouldn't understand!?"
5635402,wallydave,2017-06-28 04:44:00,2151,"American plan meals, breakfast and dinner prepared in the lodge, make your lunch in the morning, or grab a shore lunch kit, boat and gas included too! Canadian taxes included! Bait and license not included."
5635482,pjshorthorn,2017-06-28 05:39:00,5654,I might as well stay in Canada till then and head right up the 105 from V-Bay Lodge. I wonder if Gord would cut me a break on a cabin until July 8th..... PjShorthorn
5635594,wallydave,2017-06-28 06:59:00,2151,Good luck! If I could I'd meet up with you@ BBL!
5635610,eyegator,2017-06-28 07:04:00,29,"I wish I could take advantage of that one!Does anyone have reviews of this place? Obviously it's economical. The cabins look older, but I don't care about that part.How's the fishing?I also noticed they shut down in mid-august. That's strange, as I'd really like to try a Sept trip to Red."
5635866,wallydave,2017-06-28 08:25:00,2151,"I have been to BBL a couple of times in early August. The fishing was pretty good for both trips. Jim can point out some good spots. Trout Falls is a good morning bite for walleyes. There is a mid-lake hump that holds fish, straight out of the Bay is a couple of islands and past there is a Bay and shore line with a drop off that holds fish. The point just out of the Bay holds fish too. The cabins are rustic, the beds are comfortable, the food is good. They close early in the season, they have a couple kids and jobs to take care of. I hope to get a group together for a trip next season! Jim and Jillian are good people! Any questions let me know."
5635890,Guest,2017-06-28 08:35:00,0,"My son and I love it there, although we have no other Canadian adventures to compare it to (Jim and Jillian have given us zero reason to even consider going elsewhere). Making our 8th annual trip July 22nd. They close early to get back home and settled in time to get the kids back in school. If you're looking for big screen TV's (or any TV for that matter) and hot tubs, this is NOT the place for you. If you want a get-away-from-everything and catch plenty of quality fish in a rustic atmosphere (at a good price, too), it's well worth it. I, too, can answer any questions you might have. Fair warning, though: I tend to provide rather lengthy answers (as I cannot say enough good things about BBL). -42"
