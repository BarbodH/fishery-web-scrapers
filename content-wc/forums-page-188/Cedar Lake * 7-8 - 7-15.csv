5636986,Rich B,2017-06-28 16:33:00,1081,"Will be back up on Cedar for a week of fishing, fun and fish fry's.....staying at Cedar Point Resort with Ray and Kathi. Hope to see some of you on the water (Prov 1800 ?) if you're fishing the Cedar lake chain that week. Will be in a black Lund Pro-V 1900 with a very wet net hopefully.... Have several Ohio friends heading north with me, as well as a good friend from PA....another friend and his wife from Zanesville, Ohio are also coming up to CPR for 5 days and will have the cabin next to ours at camp. My buddy is checking it all out (I've told him about Cedar for years) so he's going to look over the camp and the lake for a group of his friends to fish the '18 Spring Opener. Have fished Cedar a number of years for the Spring Opener, and fished it once in early August; so this should be a fun week to fish the lake chain with warmer water temps (and hopefully no snow storms - ha). Faith, Family, Friends....and fishing Cedar Rich B"

5637826,Plotman,2017-06-29 06:12:00,394,We are heading up to Cedar for the first time the week after you. We will be staying at Keystone as they accept pets. We will be in a blue Lund 2025 Impact if anyone is there during the same period? Would be interested to hear how your week goes and to maybe pass on some tips to a newbie.
