This last Saturday got out to Lac Seul for the afternoon, and it seems the walleye have moved from the shallows where they were last week and are spreading out into the main lake. Still most fish between 12' and 17'FOW. Big sucker minnows and leeches on jigs kicked butt!https://youtu.be/xsHfzcZZOgk"
5626850,CreteHusker,2017-06-23 07:36:00,20,Wondering how much this recent cold front will affect that move. I plan on hitting a lot of north shorelines the early part of this week coming up. Wind isn't expected to move around to the south until late Monday the 26th.
5626962,Limeyangler,2017-06-23 08:30:00,563,I think it will depend on where on lac Seul you are. I was fishing in the south and central part. Lots of deep water around. If you were east or west probably different.
5627562,David Anderson,2017-06-23 12:33:00,2073,thanks for the update. I head out tomorrow morning for Lac Seul Outpost for a few days. My friend just got back from that area a week ago and stated that they caught most of their walleyes in 2 - 5 feet of water. It just doesn't seem right!
5627794,Pooch,2017-06-23 14:04:00,4618,"Just got home from Lac Seul Lodge and that is exactly what we found.Bite went back and forth between leeches, minnows and crawlers every day. When the bite slowed I'd switch to a different bait and catch a few more out of that spot before moving.Wind blown sand and gravel was working. Even non wind blown sand in the evening. Bays that held fish the first day or so of the trip (6-17) were mostly devoid of fish by 6-21.PoochPooch"
5632402,PeteyK,2017-06-26 14:52:00,7,"Got back yesterday from the south east section (Sioux Lookout) and we found fish from 9' to 22'. No real pattern and with the mayflies (2nd hatch) fish were full but still hitting jig/minnow combos. Did well but ""you find them where you find them."" I'm completely amazed at what a healthy fishery LS is."
5636106,Limeyangler,2017-06-28 09:49:00,563,"Went up yesterday and found the exact same thing PeteyK. A midwater reef I discovered late last fall that I have never caught anything on before finally produced some real HOGS! It tops out at 8' and at the bottom of the drop it is around 30' deep all the way round. Fish were mainly holding at 19' to 24'FOW but a drift across the very top would also produce. Fish were not aggressive until they decided to hit, marking loads of big fish with bellies on the bottom, you had to tease them to strike, Large sucker minnows did the trick again. Best place to get Large suckers in Dryden is K&A tackle, in fact out of the 2 main dealers in town they are far and away the better choice for live bait, nothing against the other shops, they serve a purpose, just my opinion on bait options, size, quality and price, watch out for Lisa the owner, she's a miserable OLD being, don't know how her poor husband Shane has survived all these years....LOLOLOLOL."
