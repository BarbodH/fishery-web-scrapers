Weather was in our favour the whole week...cool and cloudy with some good wind but not too much. Strong cold front went through mon-tues....didnt hurt the fish totals in the least. Only partial day setback, and i use tht term loosely, was a few hrs on wed when the sun came out. When i say fish totals of more than 100 per boat everyday im underestimating. The bite was the strongest we have ever seen. But, all males, almost 0 females. !st day a 26"" was caught, then only maybe 4-6 20"" after....and we targeted them. Water temps were low....on avg high 40s-low 50s. These females must have been recovering from the late spawn. As always, Chad and Camp3 were amazing....hot running water, shower, solar lighting, 4strokes...what more do ya need. All booked again for next yr.....its hard to go elsewhere when its this good."

My son lost a pike, going by the net and measuring how much was hanging over each end of the net when the attempt was made to net, and lost, it was over 40"" easily...tht is unususal for Abamasagi. Many attempts were made to get this guy again afterwards. Largest pike on this trip was 34"""
