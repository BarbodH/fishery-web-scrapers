But I have a pretty good gig going where I'm at. And, I can bring my Alaskan with me. Some day I may got to NCC - but I'm not planning anything now."

5632458,DaBirdman,2017-06-26 15:23:00,164,So what is LCBO? Who are they? What are they associated with? Etc?

5632842,DaBirdman,2017-06-26 18:59:00,164,"Ya I initially typed it wrong on my iPhone. So the Beer Store in Fort Frances...does the LCBO control them as well? If there were a strike, would it shut down the Beer Store and any other place that sells adult beverages?"
5633042,law57,2017-06-26 20:38:00,1147,"Larry - if you are going to North Caribou Camps, tell Dusty that Bob said hello... Last Tuesday I had lunch with his grandma and his brother... Dusty is one of the finest walleye fishermen I've ever met."
5633250,phishfearme,2017-06-27 04:55:00,1242,I think that the beer store is run differently than the liquor stores but the strike could've impacted beer stores eventually in terms of getting deliveries. phish
5633674,Larry S,2017-06-27 08:34:00,665,Fished at North Caribou Camps in 2007 and met Dusty. Going to Pete Johnsons Pickle Lake Outpost camp on the Northwest end of North Caribou.We Like an Outpost camp Atmosphere where we cook our own food and are by ourselves for the time at the outpost. Also North Caribou Camps cost quite a bit more than we want to pay. Met Dusty's Dad at Valhalla Inn eating in Restaurant with Mike Borger & family in 2014
