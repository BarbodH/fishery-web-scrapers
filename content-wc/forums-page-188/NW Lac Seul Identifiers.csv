We basically cover from Ear Falls to McKenzie Bay, but basically hitting our ""go to spots"" in Steamboat as we found the Walleye tends to migrate (for whatever reason) to this area opposed to finding them further north. I like following everyone's reports from season opener to when we head out in a couple weeks. Trouble is, I can't identify with certain references because I can't seem to find a map that details the names of islands, bays or points. For example, Manitoba Point, Lunker Point, Sand Banks, Sawmill Bay, etc... Does anyone have a map of the NW section that detail these markers? Any help on this would be greatly appreciated!"
5629002,stjoeguy,2017-06-24 10:20:00,979,I'm not sure if this will work or not. It's a zipped KMZ file of Lac Seul landmarks that I originally got from someone on Walleye Central. Unzip it and open the KMZ file in Google Earth. If that doesn't work I can PM the kmz file to you or perhaps someone can tell me how to post a kmz file on Walleye Central.

5629378,stjoeguy,2017-06-24 15:29:00,979,There are a bunch of landmark names west of McKenzie Bay including Lunker Point and Sawmill Bay. I don't see Sand Banks. Try this kmz file in Google Earth. I made all the landmark labels west of Manitoba Point bigger and brighter.
5629834,h8go4s,2017-06-24 21:28:00,1673,LineOnFishing has downloadable pdf's that show Lac Seul landmarks pretty well. Zoom in to make them readable of maybe load them on a flash drive and have an office supply store make large scale prints.http://www.lineonfishing.com/index.p...ake-depth-maps

5630098,bus33,2017-06-25 07:19:00,289,Sand Banks might be what we refer to as Clay Banks. That is just east of Lunker Point...if you boat east maybe 1/2 mile you will see high/vertical banks on a point. That's what I call Clay Banks.
5632362,PeteyK,2017-06-26 14:42:00,7,"I have a Navionics Hotmap of the NW section of LS from Ear Falls to Manitou Narrows. It's a glossy waterproof map that lists the resorts, navigation routes, bay names (Scout, Rat, MacKenzie etc) depths, hazards, islands etc. If you are interested I would be willing to sell it at less than I paid for it which I think was about $20. (I mainly fish the southeastern section now). E-mail me at [email protected] if interested."
