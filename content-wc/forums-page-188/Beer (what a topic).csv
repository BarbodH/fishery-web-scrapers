The lodge had Molson Canadian and LOTW Sultana Gold on tap, and the LOTW barrel needed to be changed twice that week. It wasn't all me, but I did give it my all."
5638745,fishron,2017-06-29 14:59:00,317,"I tried Kokanee on the recommendation of the last beer thread. It's a good Beer. If you haven't tried Yengling lager, made in Pottsville, Pa, Americas oldest brewery, you should give it a try."
5638761,btyreprich,2017-06-29 15:11:00,1067,"Yuenling Beer is very enjoyable. Happy that this brand is now available in Indiana so buying some for the August trip to Ear Falls won't be an issue. Would like to try some of the Canadian Beers, but the liquor stores are closed when we the back to the cabin each evening.Sadly our resortt does not have a bar."

5627330,johnboat,2017-06-23 10:47:00,2014,Molsons. For a mere $43.95 US you get 24 cans with a free Canadian flag. It's a steal.........
5627362,Bstar,2017-06-23 11:00:00,564,If you have the time stop in at Lake of the Woods Brewing Co in Kenora. You can buy growlers there to take home. www.lowbrewco.com

5630210,Blue Lk,2017-06-25 07:53:00,269,LCBO employees are possibly going on strike tonight at midnight! In smaller communities like Vermilion Bay & Ear Falls they also sell beer because there are no Brewers Retail stores in town.If the strike happens everyone will be out of luck for beer & spirits. I'm heading to the LCBO in Vermilion Bay this afternoon to stock up just in case.
5630306,GWC,2017-06-25 08:44:00,1021,We always bring back 2 cases of Sleeman's.
