5610161,Ricky Spanish,2017-06-14 14:34:00,1298,"Thanks for the report. I was thinking the mayflies would be coming up soon based on when I started seeing them around here. I'll be at Eagle Lake this Sat morning until Mon 6/26. If we can believe the extended forecast, looks like some nice temps for fishing all day."

5613761,prov1800,2017-06-16 08:21:00,5010,ill be on eagle all week.but cool temps are here now and slowly warming and looks like a few days of rain for next week.
5636882,Ricky Spanish,2017-06-28 15:25:00,1298,"We fished Eagle out of Temple Bay 6/17 - 6/25. My wife caught a 50"" musky and 28"" and 29.5"" walleyes on the same day. My two best were a 32"" musky and 27"" walleye, so she whooped me good. Pretty much rained at some point every day, but we caught a mess of fish and had a great time. Most days we caught between 40 and 70 walleyes, but on our last day we boated 140 eyes and three pike. We had 73 fish before lunch. I chalked it up to pjshorthorn's group scaring all the fish out of the west end when they showed up. 354 days and counting, unless I rob a bank or inherit some funds."

5637946,Ricky Spanish,2017-06-29 07:32:00,1298,"Despite the weather, I think it was our best trip to Eagle. Re-reading my post, it doesn't seem to be an actual report, so I'll add that most fish were caught on 1/8 or 1/4oz jig/minnow and were found in 22 - 30FOW. Didn't find many fish shallower, or when trolling over or jigging around the weeds. One spot where there is a pretty shallow shoal that tapers out into about 9FOW, we caught quite a few slot walleyes one evening. Tried that same spot several other times and only picked up one or two small ones."
5639449,pjshorthorn,2017-06-30 07:06:00,5654,"You are very welcome. It was quite the task herding the walleye down the lake with just two boats,but we were successful in moving them down to the Viking reef area. PjShorthorn"
