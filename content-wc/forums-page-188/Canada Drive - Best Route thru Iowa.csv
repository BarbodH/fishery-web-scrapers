5639545,gopherbuddy,2017-06-30 07:44:00,51,H52 between Rochester and Cannon Falls is getting some repaving in the Northbound lanes and that sometimes causes backups in the afternoon. Construction on I35E through Saint Paul from I94 to to I694 is all done and it's a very nice road. If you're not hitting it at rush hour I wouldn't be afraid to take that rather than drive around the East side on 494. Checking google maps traffic speeds can be handy for choosing the best route through there.

5639937,Caleb,2017-06-30 12:28:00,36,I-35 north of Minneapolis was really slow two lanes went down to one and then the construction. It took us an hour and a half to go 10 miles. It was Friday afternoon so maybe other times might be better
5638106,Wall-i-Lama,2017-06-29 09:09:00,1524,"Annual trip to Canada from Quad Cities thru Iowa. Because we drive motorhome and pull boat, we like to stay on interstate. Normally, we catch 218 in Waterloo and pick up I 35 near Mason City. While we know this way is longer, it has been easier with no construction, and very little stop/go driving. Years ago, we used to go north from Waterloo using the 63/52 routes thru Rochester to St. Paul. But some of the roads were two Lane and we always had MAJOR delays because of construction in or near Rochester. Has anyone taken this 63/52 route lately and has it improved any? We are considering trying it again, but want advice from someone eho has actually travelled this path recently. Thanks!"
5638138,LOW1,2017-06-29 09:25:00,2828,"I take the 63/52 route, have gone once this year, and will be going again this weekend.There is about a 75 mile stretch of 2 lane road from around New Hampton IA to just south of Rochester. (If you like old fashioned A and W restaurants you will drive by one in Spring Valley. MN)You can avoid much of Waterloo by taking the Evansdale exit and going around the east edge of the city.Last trip there was no construction in Rochester, a little on 52 but not a big deal.I always go around the east side of the Twin Cities on 494 .I hope you have a safe trip."
5638162,Lovetofish,2017-06-29 09:42:00,458,How was the construction on 35 up to Cloquet?
5638186,LOW1,2017-06-29 09:46:00,2828,"Compared to years past it was a breeze.I remember one area where one side of the interstate was closed (in the Hinckley area perhaps?) and all traffic shifted to the other side, but the delay was very short.Also little construction on 33/53 to IFalls.All in all, very little construction delay."
5638242,Lovetofish,2017-06-29 10:30:00,458,Thanks
5638281,johnboat,2017-06-29 10:53:00,2014,"As a Waterlooian, I go the 218/18E/I35 route. There are a few that go up 63, but from those I know 218 is more popular. It's 100% 4 lane and in good shape. Google usually suggests the 218 route as well, but occasionally on the return trip it suggests 63. Not sure why.It's kinda 6 of one 1/2 dozen of the other."

5638817,Wall-i-Lama,2017-06-29 16:22:00,1524,THanks all for the info!
5639257,Pat,2017-06-29 22:06:00,203,You might consider taking 20 at Waterloo over to I35 and then head north. 20 is basically driving an interstate across that stretch.
