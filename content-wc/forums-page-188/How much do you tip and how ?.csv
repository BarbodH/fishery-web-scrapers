5629706,Mich_Fisherman,2017-06-24 19:51:00,292,"We go to a camp that has housekeeping plans only. Our group generally tips $10 US/day per guy if the dock hands are exceptional. That is if they are there for us when we leave the docks for the lake and the boats are gassed and ready to go, they are at the docks to get us minnows and there to land the boats when we get in. They also help us old guys out of the boat by holding it close to the dock. Some guys in the group complain about the amount and they are free to tip whatever but usually cave to the group peer pressure."
5629738,That Minnesota guy,2017-06-24 20:14:00,8293,"For months and months we read threads about guys planning their trips to Canada. For some it's a once in a lifetime thing, for others it's a yearly thing, for a select few it's one of many trips each year. For many of these camp employees it's a 3-4 month burst of employment. They work long hours far from home in many cases. You seldom will find mediocre employees. Mostly they are very good and take pride in helping the clients of their respective camps. Those people I'll tip very well, often as much as $100 for the dock help. The folks who clean and maintain the cabins will get $50 usually. The bad employees........they get to collect a pay check from the owner. I have no interest in making a poor performer a well paid employee. My personal feeling is if I can't afford a decent tip to people who help make my trip memorable then maybe I should stay home. As far as the fishing and weather goes it doesn't effect my tip at all. None of those folks have the power to help with that. I don't tip the owners. Their tip is if I re-book. I never tell my other trip mates what I tip. I also contribute to a group tip if there is one. Everybody has their own feelings on what a tip should be. Far be from me to tell somebody else what to tip."
5630114,port1042,2017-06-25 07:26:00,509,"Our trip includes 3 guys in a housekeeping cabin (drive-in). However, the dock hands clean (and freeze if requested) our fish. That's a big plus! We typically tip $150 ($50 from each of us) for the two dock hands. Plus, as we've gotten to know them we might also bring along a bottle of good rum for one of the guys who is especially helpful. In addition we leave $10 each ($30 total) for the girls who take care of cabin. They change the linens once during the week, empty our trash can daily, and of course they clean up when we leave. We've never been totally comfortable with ""how much"" but after several years this is what we've settled on. We tip directly to the dock hands and leave the ""maid's"" tip on the kitchen table with a thank you note."
5630146,Shellback,2017-06-25 07:37:00,8083,"So how do you tip a camp that just provides a cabin, no dockhands etc? It would just be the camp owners with no other staff."
5630178,That Minnesota guy,2017-06-25 07:43:00,8293,If it's owner only and he does a great job making your vacation as good as possible........re-book for next year. Like mentioned before if he goes above and beyond I might tip him.
5630658,law57,2017-06-25 12:37:00,1147,"I tipped the 'caretaker' $50 US - the owner doesn't involve himself with day-to-day operation of the lodge. He, owner, may or may not be at his personal lodge. I also brought $50 worth of American beer that the caretaker likes. $40 for the beer and $9 duty.There were two dock boys tending me on landings. One helped a couple of days and then had two days off - the other helped those days. I was by myself and appreciated the help. I gave each $20 Canadian and each a $15 six-pack of American beer. $10 for the beer and ~$4.50 duty.So I guess I tipped $160 US total (roughly figured $130 US and $40 Canadian). Is that right? Well, I like it there. They have an opening the first week of September - I may go back up again. Why not? I'm only 300 miles from there."
5618490,rzep,2017-06-19 10:21:00,1196,So your stay is over .. how much do you tip ? Do you add to you overall bill or tip individually people in kitchen etc ?
5618514,SterlingArcher,2017-06-19 10:24:00,92,"No kitchen or anything at Cliff & Roma's/Cat Track. My group tips the owners directly on an individual basis. Some can afford to tip more than others, but everyone gives something - usually between $20-$100 depending on length of stay etc. The service is always A++++ so that doesn't really factor in, other than we hope it continues"
5618546,BornToFish,2017-06-19 10:57:00,1224,"Greetings,I normally tip those staff members that I believe deserve a tip on an individual basis. A tip is never guaranteed, in that they need to earn a tip from my wife and me. Staff members that go above and beyond get a tip. Those staff members that show up to work and go through the motions don't do as well. We've been going to the same lodges for years. The returning staff members remember what they will get as a tip, so we normally get exemplary service. It's maybe worth noting that my wife and I are not high-maintenance guests. Tipping in US dollars goes an extra long way for the staff members when they convert the tip to Canada dollars.I normally do not tip the lodge owners as we have been friends for many years. We periodically get together during the off-season at each other's homes for dinner/drinks. If it wasn't for this, we would tip the owners as well.Hope this helps...."
5618610,mjayn,2017-06-19 11:51:00,1188,I don't tip. But only because I rent a cabin and have no interest in any other commonly offered services. If I were to use other services I would tip.
5618618,1/4 oz Jig,2017-06-19 11:54:00,90,First off I have never tipped a lodge owner and see no reason to unless they did something well beyond what is included in your trip. Maybe if they helped with a mechanical issue on my boat or vehicle or had to run to town for me. As far as the rest of the staff it depends on if I'm doing housekeeping or american plan. For the housekeeping we usually give money directly to the dockhands. American plan I've been to lodges where they have tip jars for the different workers that we add money at the end of the stay. Others we have put money in an envelope and given to the waitress at our last meal and have them divide it up amongst the help. This works good for a smaller lodge. Guide we always tip right when we get back to the dock. As far as amount it depends on how good the service is. If its american plan I usually find myself tipping around $75 for the week. Housekeeping maybe $20 for the dockhands. Sometimes things besides money make someones day. Giving a guide a hard to get musky lure. Last year we stayed at an american plan resort and were really pleased with the service the staff provided. Along with the money we gave as tip we included a nice letter we wrote to the staff thanking them. Before we left in the morning most of the staff came and thanked us for how touched they were by the letter.
5618754,BornToFish,2017-06-19 12:29:00,1224,"Greetings,Quarter ounce jig reminded me of something. I hired a musky guide several years ago. He commented during our fishing that he needed to drive to Vermillion Bay in hopes that they had a black, nine inch Suick musky lure as he needed to replace such a lure. I happened to have two in my musky box, so I gave him one of them as his tip for the day. It cost me around $25.00 or so, but would have cost him far more in time and money. He was about as happy as could be.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5618882,NP4ME,2017-06-19 13:45:00,378,"We battle every year with the issue of how much to tip. We stay at a smaller camp where it's just the owners a couple hired help. The service is not bad, but it's definitely not above and beyond. We have decided in the past to not to tip the owners, but just tip the help."
5618930,rzep,2017-06-19 13:55:00,1196,Seems like tipping is all over the spectrum .. I guess I cant go wrong with whatever I decide to do ..
5619586,Obabikon,2017-06-19 19:35:00,2370,"I always suggest 5% of the bill for guests (for kitchen help), and if a guide does a good job, in the range $50-$100 per day. (depending on how many are with the group) I remind people to tip according to service. If they ever feel that service was less than adequate to inform me, and let it reflect in the tips. Luckily, this is very rarely the case, as we have a wonderful staff."
5619818,1/4 oz Jig,2017-06-19 21:15:00,90,"Yep, Give what you feel is deserving everyone has a different opinion. Im sure some people don't even tip at all!"
