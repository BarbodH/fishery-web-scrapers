I did a search and Blackmac wrote this: Randy fldoc1 from duluth As stated you can fish Canada waters with the appropriate paperwork, i.e. licence and RABC permit, and bring fish back into Minnesota. I strongly suggest you do not have any species of fish longer than what the Minnesota regs allow nor in a greater amount that the possession limits. It may say it's OK in the regs as long as you have proof of lodging etc, but it's not worth the hassle. Also DO NOT bring leeches or live minnows across the border. Crawlers are OK as long as they are in bedding and not dirt. Salted minnows are also OK, at least for right now. Rainy has more enforcement on it than at the North/South Korean border. There is OPP, Ontario MNR, Border Patrol, National Park Rangers, County Sheriff, MN DNR and soon the Coast Guard will be out from what I hear."

As mentioned don't guess what they are, know what they are and be with-in the rules. With the vast amounts of water available there is no reason to venture into Canada. Enjoy the trip."

You must also have a receipt from Canada for any live bait on board. There are plenty of walleyes, northern and smallmouth on the US side of Namakan. If you want to fish the Canadian side of Rainy, go to Canada and fish the North Arm or Red Gut/Seine Bays . Doing so smooths out lots of compliance issues."
