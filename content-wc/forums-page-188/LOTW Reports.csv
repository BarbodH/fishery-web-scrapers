5617977,Ver88,2017-06-19 07:29:00,114,"I just returned from the Sioux Narrows area on lake of the woods. Walleye fishing was decent but not great. We had some good days with 100+ walleyes and some very slow days. The weather and wind changed on Tuesday and fishing became difficult. Fish were caught from 2 fow to 44 fow, but 30 to 32 fow seemed best most days. Water temp was between 60 and 68, but was dropping near the end of our week of fishing. Also caught smallmouth bass and a few perch."
5628258,pr9763,2017-06-23 19:27:00,4,"looking forward to hear how you all do at ash rapids, our group goes at the end of august.. please say hi to andrew aka the KRUM and tannis aka TANNA baby"
5628354,martinbns,2017-06-23 20:22:00,1520,"Hasn't been real warm so far, and it's been very windy. We fished for bass in there two weeks ago only caught a couple of pike."
5628498,Obabikon,2017-06-24 04:15:00,2370,"The warmer spring turned into a MUCH cooler summer. Not sure what's going on, but it appears the wind is FINALLY going to slow down some. Fishing has been spotty... nothing completely shut off, but nothing on fire either. Walleyes are pretty scattered."
5628922,NP4ME,2017-06-24 09:21:00,378,Anyone have water temps for the east side?
5629066,Obabikon,2017-06-24 11:06:00,2370,East side? White fish bay area or Nestor Falls? Nestor should be running around 68 I would guess. (typically a tad warmer than us) White fish will be cooler.... but I'm not sure about that temp. Most of the water temps I saw yesterday were right around 65-66
5629850,NP4ME,2017-06-24 21:49:00,378,"Thanks, Obabikon. I was looking for Whitefish Bay, but that will work. Thanks again."
5631050,mrpike24,2017-06-25 18:34:00,54,"Just got back yesterday from a week fishing the NW side of LOTW (Ash Bay, Shoal, Ptarmigan, Wiley Point area). Fishing was much tougher than usual, especially towards the end of our week. Most of my other reports leading up to the trip were much of the same, inconsistent bites and tough to find a great pattern. Water temps were showing low 60's in most areas, the mayfly's definitely were all over the lake at times. Had our best luck with walleye on windblown shorelines or in the weeds. We tried numerous points, reefs, and off shore structure with livebait or crankbaits and had very minimal luck and rarely even marked fish to boot. Usually a 30"" quality fish would be the biggest of the week but big fish were tough to find, lots in the low 20"" range but 24"" set the bar this year which was a huge disappointment. Best walleye fishing came down towards Wiley Point/Big Narrows area for sure. Had a couple good outings on Bass but with it being cloudy and cool most of the week, they didn't seem to be up shallow like usual, the one day we really got into them was last Tuesday in the Shoal Narrows where we had a 100+ day up to 18"". Still saw some beds but the fish didn't seem to be on them still. Always a great week despite not having our best of luck with the fish. Thank you Canada!"
5632858,MN_Moose,2017-06-26 19:03:00,964,Great to hear your report though disappointed your fishing improve any from what we had.
5636538,deadhead1,2017-06-28 12:37:00,193,"I would say walleye is spotty and seem to be scattered. Have caught in 14 to 35 feet of water, bass are hot on shorelines. Have had some excellent days mid June but last week has slowed down. Walleye bite is very slow, and have to work then hard. Seems like they are there but no agressive bite."
5597361,mrpike24,2017-06-08 11:40:00,54,"Just closing in on a week before heading up and seeing if anyone had any reports recently? Sounds like the water is a foot or two low and looks like the weather has really warmed up this week. Water Temps look to be in the low 60's for the most part. We will be staying in the Kenora area and was curious how the walleye and Smallmouth fishing has been and where the bass are at with their spawn right now. Anyway, just thought i'd see if anyone had any udpates. Happy Fishing!"
5597369,Ver88,2017-06-08 11:43:00,114,I will be in the Sioux narrows area the 10th to 17th and I will give a report when I return.
5597393,Thompmd,2017-06-08 12:08:00,320,I too have been searching for reports but not found any. My wife/I are heading to Ash Rapids for the first time on the 23rd. I will send a report when we return. My wife/I fish for everything and rarely fish for walleye other than what we randomly catch casting.Seems like it has been a warmer spring so far.
5597401,mrpike24,2017-06-08 12:12:00,54,"I'll be up in that area from the 17-24 so will provide a report when I return as well. Stay at Ash quite often, Tannis and Andrew are very accommodating.....Love the area!"
5597481,Thompmd,2017-06-08 12:46:00,320,"Thanks and that's good news. Spoke to them this morning and we are looking forward to it, especially trying Shoal Lake."
5598129,Redline,2017-06-08 18:34:00,73,I'm going the 14th-18th so I'll make sure to share my results as well.
5598537,Obabikon,2017-06-09 04:10:00,2370,"Water temp in our area is somewhere between 62-66. Small mouth still have eggs as of yesterday. They're very aggressive and biting along shorelines. Walleye have been pretty easy. 16-22' deep, humps, rock points... moving up shallow in the evenings. Sorry it was quick, just don't have a ton of time to write a full report. Hope that helped."
5598617,Thompmd,2017-06-09 05:14:00,320,"Thank you Jared for taking the time, much appreciated."
5600961,frozen fish,2017-06-10 11:31:00,92,"Smallmouth were still on beds in the Shoal Lake Ash Rapids area on Friday June 9. Yes, the lake level is very low. Need a good guide? PM me."
5601097,AMPHIB206,2017-06-10 13:44:00,191,"Fished this past Wednesday on LOTW. Launched at Pye's. There is a bass that has a nest 3 ft from the cement pad. It wasn't moving. Went all the ways past Wiley's resort and worked our way back. Jigged and trolled crawlers on all colors. Pink and Chartreuse were productive. Stopped at Wiley's. $11 for a dozen minnows. Had lunch only. Worked our way back to Corkscrew and Ptarmigan, trying atleast 10 spring spots. Only managed 13 walleye all day; from 8""-""26"". Fished anywhere from 12 ft to 25 ft. Fished points, flats, and humps. The 3 days winds were out of the south. didn't help us on the north shorelines. Gonna try again next week."
