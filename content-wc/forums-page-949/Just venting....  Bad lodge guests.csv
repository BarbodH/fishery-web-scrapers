We were there yesterday and they were uncommonly hard to find. Mind you the lake was like glass and not a cloud in the sky. In the afternoon we found them once the wind got up and a little cloud cover in about six feet of water up in Dark Water Bay.I deal with the public in retail and like one of the guys said 95% are great, it's those very few that piss you off and ruin your day, we just have to learn to get on with it and enjoy the heck out of the good ones!"
520885,River_eye,2002-05-31 10:51:00,1486,"We only found fish in one spot. It was along the shoreline nearby the Yellow triangle portage sign to side-sadle lake. Everywhere else was pretty dead, the funny part is that it was the shoreline that was out of the wind that day. Usually when that lake is dead calm and sunny it's pretty dead."
520886,Guest,2002-06-09 12:48:00,0,"Hey River-eye:You meet all kinds when guiding. Thankfully, I have had the pleasure of guiding great people who are on the water to have fun and enjoy the experience. There are some misguided folks who believe that because they have paid for a guide that they are guaranteed a fantastic catch, shorelunch and fish to take home. I always try to make things clear to my guests before we leave the dock. I tell them that fishing may be tough and that I perfer to guide catch and release parties that want a modest shorelunch. If my prospective clients have a problem with that, there are other guides out there that will try to fullfill their greed. Be clear, polite and confident in your pre-trip discussions then both you and your guests will know what to expect.Have you ever had someone want to send you their maps so you could mark down (your very valuable and hard discovered) fishing holes!? I have and I think this beats all for down right ignorance.Good fishingJackfish"
520887,Guest,2002-06-12 05:12:00,0,"Jackfish, yes I have done this. I was going to a lake I haven't seen since childhood, and wrote to a well-known guide at the lake. He offered to buy a hotspots map, mark it up for me, and mail it back - for $50 plus the map cost. I thought this was fair, and the response I got back was well-worth it. This is a huge lake, and I would have not known where to start; he knew that after my weekend there I would not be back, and so the damage I could do to his honey-holes was minimal, at best. My wife was a bit perplexed, thinking that fish are everywhere in the lake, but I did not mind paying the fee. When you balance the cost of travel, lodging, license, gas, and time off, another $50 for a map is a good investment. Think of charging for this service and you may make a new customer very happy. m"
520888,Guest,2002-06-12 22:29:00,0,"Sorry to be contrary Mikie but copy machines can pump out a whole lot of hot spot marked maps. I think it's only smart business to keep some information to one self. A Guides knowledge is all he/she really has to sell. You said it yourself, our knowledge is valuable. Believe me when I say it's a lot more valuable than $50.00. If a guide keeps on giving out cheap info they won't have any customers and for sure their fishing holes will be nothing but holes. I don't mind giving tips and explaining a productive pattern but xnay on the hotspotzay. As Don Corleon said, 'Don't ever let anyone know what your thinking outside the family'."
520889,Guest,2002-06-13 10:12:00,0,"Sorry about your experience. Some people are just...well you know. But....you said they were ignoring the slot and barbless regs. Is it not you and the lodge owners ""duty"" to report these infractions and/or ask(insist) that they pack their bags. If a Wildlife/Conservation Officer had pulled up beside you with illegal fish and hooks in the boat, you and the lodge owner would be facing charges along with these numbskulls."
520874,River_eye,2002-05-29 21:02:00,1486,"Last week I was guiding some folks from Grand forks, a group of 11, led by a well known grand forks business owner. They really pissed me off. I know they are a small minority, but I'd like to create some awareness.They wrote an angry e-mail to my boss stating that they were very unhappy that they didn't all get their limits of fish to take home. They caught lots, and would have been able to if they hadn't eaten so much fish for shore lunch. While they were here, they did not respect the length limits for walleye nor did they worry about pinching their barbs (a provincial regulation). They told my boss that we had told them that they all had their limits, when we said no such thing.Lodge guides are not willing to go the extra length for their customers if they do not show respect for the local regulations."
520875,PJM,2002-05-29 21:40:00,3516,"River_eye No matter what anyone say's, guiding can be tough and because people spend money for a guide they think the fish should jump in the boat. The other problem that you the face is some people don't have the touch to catch the fish and they think it's your fault. The way I look at it is if you take out 1000 people and 980 were happy with your service you have satisfied 95 percent, that's not bad. When you deal with people you never what to expect. I respect people that guide and my advice is, blow it off and consider the source."
520876,Tim,2002-05-30 04:08:00,179,"Sorry for the bad experience. Last year I hired a guide for my wife and father for a day. They caught 2 fish all day but my Dad told me that he learned more about fishing in 8 hours than he had in his whole life. Folks just don't get it, fishing is about having fun. If you need food so badly, go to the supermarket. Look on the bright side. You get to fish every day for living, as they say on the mastercard commercial, ""Priceless""."
520877,Pooch,2002-05-30 04:48:00,4619,Over the years we have ran into chumps like that in Canadian camps and in everyday work. They have always been chumps and will die being chumps. Everybody knows them. Like black flies and other pests sometimes you have to deal with them from time to time. Blow them off for what they are.Pooch
520878,Walleye Wacker,2002-05-30 05:44:00,6,Let it go man!!! I have used Guides on many occasions and if one will pay attention to what a Guide says and does they can learn more about fishing every time. Even fishing has its share of ###holes and the guys you Guided sound like they are large in that category. Fishing is the best way to enjoy natures gift and the company of friends. Fishing is not about how many fish you take home its about the good memorys and the challenge of finding and catching and the releasing of fish so the resource can be maintained. I apologize for the fools you fished with .Dont let it influence your time with the many true fisherman you will guide this year.......Catch and Release
520879,Fuzz,2002-05-30 06:08:00,85,"I invited my best friend to join our annual Canada fishing group a few years ago. He hadn't done much fishing for 10 years and had the notion that he should catch fish all day every day while we were there. The dreaded cold front went through the day before our arrival and the fishing was tough. All he did was whine the entire trip about not catching fish. He won't be invited back.I also don't understand some of our group that complains about only being able to bring 4 fish back each year. I know for a fact that they still have their fish in the freezer 9 months later because they bring them to our annual fish fry in April to plan our next trip!People such as you've described are ignorant. Anyone that fishes a lot knows that it's a bonus when they bite good. That's why they call it fishing and not catching. As most on this board, I love just being out there and the challenge.Blow off your bad guests. As others mention, I'm sure their in the minority. Good luck.Fuzz"
520880,bbakes,2002-05-30 07:02:00,121,"I guided probably the most pissed off guy for four days one time. Notice I didn't call him a fisherman! I actually put my rod down because he got madder and madder everytime I caught a fish. It didn't matter what technique we used bobbers, lindys, bottom bouncers, he whined and complained about where we were fishing and how we were fishing. If your boss is like mine, he will understand and feel sorry that such people exist. I know you can think about a day you slammed them recently and made your guests feel like they belong on in-fisherman. Remember those days spent with good people, and forget the jerks who will never appreciate the outdoors like you and I will."
520881,Guest,2002-05-30 08:36:00,0,"We have had new people come on our trip that also act like ###holes. They dont get invited back. Fishing is to much fun to let some jerk or jerks to ruin one minute of it. Foget about those dumb##### and focus on those of us who appreciate ""THE JOY OF FISHING"""
520882,Thumper,2002-05-30 15:31:00,133,"Sorry to hear that River-eye. I work in customer relations for a Local Utility and you can never please everybody. You have your values,stick by them and never apologise for them. They may disagree with your values but in the end you still have them. Customers come and go. Regards........."
520883,River_eye,2002-05-30 17:49:00,1486,"Thanks for reading guys. All other guests so far have been great. But once and a while you get some people that should be on a cruise ship somwhere warm instead, doesn't matter which country they're from. Actually, it's usually the Americans that are the easier guys to get along with for various reasons.Fishing has been decent lately, guided the lodges first fly out trip to crowduck and caught over a hundred walleyes.Anyways, good fishing all."
