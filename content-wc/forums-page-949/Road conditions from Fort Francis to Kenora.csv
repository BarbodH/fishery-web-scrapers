521367,Guest,2002-06-13 08:49:00,0,We're planning to drive from Minneapolis thru Fort Francis to Kenora and up to Minaki on Sunday morning. Our big concern at this point is getting to Kenora. Anyone with current information? We could sure use some encouragement. It sounds like the washouts were pretty bad!Thanks for any updates.
