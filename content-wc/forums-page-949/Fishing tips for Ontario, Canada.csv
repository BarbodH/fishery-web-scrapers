520173,Guest,2002-06-04 19:18:00,0,I found the `personal bug zapper` at www.cookscorner.com and searched under mosquito. There is a nice description of it there. They are hard to find but fun and efficient to use. Kord
520174,Guest,2002-06-05 12:11:00,0,"there a good fly in list of things to make sure you have athttp://www.justfishontario.com/fly-in_list.htmTake a good rain suit------a real good rain suit. Mosquitoes aren't usually on the lakes during the day, the are in the bush though, but why would you want to be in the bush. They come out about 45 minutes before dark and stick around until about 2hours after. Then they went to bed.I would cover water with a bottom bouncer and spinner rig. Vary the depths until you find active fish, then stick at it. Once you find them, you can jig them with a plain lead head tipped with twister or live bait. I would suggest live bait as it takes a bit to get the hang of plastics.Seek advice from operator about depths of walleyes or whatever you are looking for. And he should maybe mark a map for you, but the lake doesn't have probably."

520175,Guest,2002-06-11 15:41:00,0,"Well Guys Thanks for ALL the information. A majority of this info came into play for me and I was prepared.SEANIK and BOB KERR your both right on the money when talking about RON.He was very anal about his equipment. We fished Lake Burntbush. This lake is approx 3 miles wide and 5 miles long. Fishing was fair. We went up May 24 and returned June 1.We really didn't get into the fish like we anticipated we would, but we were catching 15 to 20, 24"" pike a day on the average. Walleye were slow catching till the end of the week. Big Pike was 38 inches, we missed a couple more at the boat.(Oh by the way I caught big fish. 45 pound Lake Sturgeon. No one specified what type of fish it had to be. Ha Ha) We hit all kinds of weather. Early in the week low 50's end of the week high 80's, returning home 20 mile an hour winds.Bugs never really came into play.Lake Burntbush very Nice. I didnt see anything or anybody for the entire week there. Kesigami/Portage might be the big dollar lake up there BUT I personally prefer the quite and peacefulness of a secludedlake in the middle of no where. Not having to race to marker bouys to catch the fish. And #####, at $495 it was worth it to me. Ron did charge us $.50 a pound over weight. We figured a majority of our weight was liquids. (water, beer, pop ect.) One thing we decided to do next year is drink more of the Lake water. Boil it, bring powered drinks (Tang, Tea, what ever your preference) That will cut down on the weight alot. Im still looking for the powered BEER having trouble locating that one.We disscussed going next year in June instead of May hoping the weather stablizes. The fish seemed more active when the tempiture warmed up.Well, once again thanks for all the info it really help me for this trip and future trips.JasonPS Dont forget your SNAKEY SPOONS. Pike loved them. Lime green. I took 2 and wish I had 10"
520176,Pooch,2002-06-12 06:48:00,4619,Powdered beer... Instant beer? What a great idea! Couldn't be any worse than some of the instant teas we have tried.Pooch
520177,Guest,2002-06-12 08:54:00,0,"jason - sound like all in all you had a good time with your trip - glad to hear it. try a ""shield"" type lake next time. i find them much more interesting - especially for walleye, than those james bay lowland lakes that tend to be shallow, muddy and featureless.bob kerr"
520155,Guest,2002-05-31 07:02:00,0,"hey seanik - we were also at partridge/kesagami last year - over the fourth of july - snow, rain, gale winds - lousy weather. but - we found ron to be the BIGGEST pain is the butt i've ever seen. those boats and motor on partridge were from the korean war and the ""14 footer"" was really a 12' boat with the number 14 written on it. we were hit for $1 per pound for everything over the limit, the ice box on the deck didn't work - i could go on and on. he was MUCH more concerned about his equipment lasting until ##### freezes over than about our comfort or happyness. we would never rebook with that guy."
520156,Seanik,2002-05-31 08:03:00,218,"SBobI agree that Ron is a pain in the butt at times and overly concerned about his old equipment, but the boats /motors on Kesagami were excellent as was the fishing. In August the deck refrig was working and kept the blue cold. I'm looking at Gardiner Airs 2002 rate sheet and the overweight charge is .50 lb not 1.00, yes everything is weighed before boarding the plane but you know this will happen when you book. Weather in the north can be unpredictable, bring the right clothes and be prepared to fish in it. you never mentioned the fishing, we found it to be great and worth it to put up with Rons sometimes bulls**t. Before we left Ron we had a long talked with him about how he was such an ##### at times. His answer was that he had his equipment and cabins trashed too many times, that prompted the attitude and rules. I believe its a two street for both outfitter and client. Gardiner Airs Partridge/Kesagami Trip costs is 765.00Us as opposed to the lodge on Kesagami at about 1400.00 American plan. I would book again and put up with Ron for the great fishing!"
520157,Guest,2002-05-31 10:08:00,0,"yah - we did have good fishing - on kesagami - not partridge - when we could get out - and that was only for three days - a very stiff and constant west wind prevented exiting the dock with those crappy motors. and, yes, ron is much cheaper than the lodge (and also doesn't have bait and lure restrictions) - it just takes forever to get to kesagami with his slow boats and the portage. yes, the boats and motors on kesagami were really good - did you find the ""beer cooler"" spring behind the boat cache? the water was 40 degf - a great beer cooler. ron also told us about people abusing his stuff as why he's so ""picky"" - a very mild word for what he is. i wonder though if it's not the other way around - he made us not care about his stuff and we always take extra care with bush equipment.a few other comments (complaints?): we found a continuous stream of freighter canoes hitting all the same spots (which are bouyed) over and over again and catching nothing (i think the lodge may have been closed when you were there)kesagami is a hugh, flat bottom, featureless, shallow and muddy lake. we've gone to a number of lakes in the cochrane area (james bay lowlands) and are going to stay with the ""schield"" lakes in northwest ontario. its a longer drive for us but worth it.glad you had good fishing though."
520158,Guest,2002-06-01 12:56:00,0,"To the fishermen who have been to Ron and Shirleys camps-never again for any of us! We boked with him 7 years ago and the equipment and cabins were garbage then and from what I have heard from others, are only getting worse. We flew out of his base camp and he screwed us from the get-go with the so-called over weight charges.The lake he flew us into was called Echo Lake and if any others have been there, I am sure you read all the comments on the cabin walls and under the bunks from previous guests.To sum it up-Ech Lake-Big Mistake!! He told us at the Buffalo show there were not anymore cottages in a 10 mile area around this lake. Bull! When we flew in we spotted 3 more within a mile of the lake. While there we were visited by 2 guys on atvs!! When we asked himabout it, he said they were moose camps!! Funny they all had boats docked there. This story could go on forever about him but the topper was when we got back to the plane dock, there was a man and his 2 sons waiting to be flownout.We talked to them and they were from Charlotte,North Carolina. The father brought his 2 boys all this way by plane to Toronto where they got a bus to Cochrane and Ron picked them up at the airport. Ron charged them $50 each way for the ride which was probably 20 minutes each way! Not a very nice way to treat guests, especialy from that far away. Hope they had good luck because the way their trip started, would have ended it for me!Funny thing this year he was right across the aisle from my friends tackle display in Hamburg and all agreed that he he never smiled, and the 3 days of the show, my fiends wife who was at their booth everyday said she only saw 2 people book a trip with him!! He deserves what he gets and it sure won!t be anymore of our business. Too many other deserving outfitters in Ontario."
520159,Guest,2002-06-01 14:29:00,0,pete - i wish i coulda/woulda/shoulda talked to you before we booked with him. we did however want to try kesagami lake and didn't want the cost or hastles associated with the lodge so he was the only other choice. we'll never go back to him and i hope others take heed.bob
520168,Guest,2002-06-02 18:36:00,0,Another little trick we do at lakes in noseeum (sandfly) country is to take noseeum proof screen and tape it over the screens at the rental cabins. We have been doing this for years and you sleep lots easier. The sand flys go right through regular screening. When we leave we take the screens with us. I also take a battery operated smoke detector because a lot of the cabins do not have detectors in them. I am afraid of fire.
520169,NateW,2002-06-02 20:46:00,96,"I almost forgot, we have a couple things we always pack and don't know why, but always get used. They are: duct tape, electrical tape, super glue, WD-40, and zip ties. This is a great post! There'some really good stuff here!"
520170,Guest,2002-06-03 18:52:00,0,"great post and great suggestions. a portable fish finder is a must if you can score one. Also,a burning mosquito coil is a must for the cabin. just light one when you go out in the evening or when you return. It will get rid of those divebombers that sound like a B-24 in your ear at 3 a.m. *&%# thiings drive me crazy while trying to sleep. Also consider ear plugs for those cabin mates who snore."
520171,fishinnut,2002-06-04 09:12:00,642,Pick up a mosquito net for over your bed.
520172,Guest,2002-06-04 10:26:00,0,"Whats the deal with this portable bug zapper?? I heard about it on another post. I have started taking my B1 vitamins 4 days ago and i am going up saturday i will post and let you know how they worked! who ever invented the coil was a genius that is the best thing for the cabin i have ever used! What about black flies in the boat? If this B1 vitamin dont work i'll be forced to use deet and if i happend to get any on my lures,bait or fishing line i will get skunked!!!!!!!!"
520160,the_bronco,2002-05-16 17:36:00,86,"Don't forget the lip balm with sun block, three in our group have ended up at the doctors, over the years, after returning from canada, becuase our lips were so badly burned. Bring clothing that you can layer, because you will fish in 30 degree weather and 100 degree weather in the same week and, as mentioned before, a good rain suit is a must!!!. A camera is also a good idea, Canada is as beautiful as it gets. The first time I saw Canada I fell in love with it, and someday hope to retire there. The people there are also some of the nicest you will ever meet. I just remembered, a small fan will help you sleep a lot better on the hot nights. Good luck, have a great time. I will be on Gullrock lake four weeks from today and can hardly stand it, a day seems like a week"
520161,Guest,2002-05-17 19:10:00,0,"1) Fish the wind. Fish structure that the wind is blowing into.2) Start out with what you have confidence in. Start with a Lindy or jig. Live bait it #1.3) Be prepared for any weather.4) On a week's trip you will have some poor days, some avg. days, and if you get one tremendous day it will make your trip worth the drive.(You could end up with 2-4 tremendous days).5) Fish fairly shallow that time of year (5-15 feet).6) Fish the wind.7) If you are catching a lot of ""eaters"" and would like to wrestle with a big girl, try fishing a little deeper, it sometimes puts you in a school of bigger fish.8) Stay on the bottom with whatever you are fishing (walleyes)9) If you are fishing a river fed system, you may want to try current at that time of year. The fish will have just spawned an will be stacked like cord wood somewhere on that body of water.10) Fish the wind"
520151,Thumper,2002-05-18 04:00:00,133,Nate..... great reply and advice. You should get an award for the best post of the tear in the Canada section. You can fish in my boat anytime......
520162,Red Ruffandsore,2002-05-18 05:35:00,81,"Some great tips here and I'll just add two cents worth. If you do not have access to a shower, I would recommend that you leave the bug spray at home and just use a quality bug shirt, pants and hat. The aggravation that bugs can bring can surely spoil your trip. Swimming in layers of deet ain't my picture of heaven either. You need only wear the bug clothes when neccesary and that won't be all day every day. As well I would like to echo the remark about going cheap on an isolated trip. If you can catch big fish on a shoelace, you need not worry. If you have weak spots in your rig, it's going to be a long trip. I'm sure everyone reading here has had a rod snapped accidently at one point. My best rod was busted by my buddy getting into the boat the first day on one trip. Be prepared. And please control your garbage (like I'm sure you will)"
520163,Thumper,2002-05-18 09:33:00,133,"Good advice on the bugs and deet....I hate bug repellant and will only put it on my hat,jacket ect and a tiny amount behind the ears. We fish and camp in some extreme bug situations and most of the bug thing can be prevented like this and having a positive mental attitude....Like HUH what bugs...this is nothing."
520164,Pooch,2002-05-18 13:44:00,4619,"The Deet goes on the socks, hat and maybe sweatshirt sleeves. I have not found a reason to use it on my skin. Like they said above don't fight the wind, fish it. Pooch"
520165,Eric,2002-05-18 16:31:00,114,"1 Don't forget some wire leaders.2 Good raingear3 Dardevle spoons( red and white and five of diamonds), Rapala husky jerks, Rattletraps and jigs cover this type of fishing.4 Good quality rod and reel with a backup.5 Unhooking eguipment for the notherns6 waterproof boots or shoesAll the other suggestions are on the money. Have a great time and be safe.(ps also a first aid kit) Eric"
520146,Guest,2002-05-21 12:42:00,0,"Hello,Could you forward some info over to me as well...I'll be fishing Southeastern Ontarion this coming weekend...Ant advice would greatly appreciated.Paul[email protected]"
520166,Guest,2002-05-21 13:03:00,0,"A couple of additional items:1. A First Aid Kit. Bring it and you wont use it. Forget it and you will need it.2. A small survial kit. It may come in very handy. You are in the bush, dont forget it. Treat Ma Nature with respect.3. Take a little time to admire the area. It is easy to get all wrapped up in the fishing, I advise taking a step back and taking it all in.4. Treat Canada with respect. Some things are better up there, some things arent. You are a visitor. 5. A thermometer. I find it very useful to take water temps. Especially early in the year, water temps = fish location.6. Sunblock.7. Extra keys for your truck. Think there is a story behind this one?8. Polarized sunglasses aid BIG time in fishing shallow water and avoiding the rocks.9. A measuring tape if one is not provided. Needed for measuring fish length on lakes that have special regs.10. A good map of the lake. Mebbe your outfitter provides this. Find out.I have a checklist that I provide to a lot of people going on Canada trips that is pretty inclusive. If anyone wants it, email me at [email protected]."
520167,Karl,2002-05-22 19:36:00,63,"The deet bug spray works for mosquitos but not at all for black flies and you're not going to get mosquitos on the lake, more like when you come back to your cabin. I hate bug spray, so I ended up wrapping a towel around each ankle to keep the black flies from biting through my socks (which were literally soaked with deet spray). Only happened one year, but taught me to wear light hiking boots and/or longer jeans. Remember to start a mosquito coil in the cabin before you go out - that keeps them out of the cabin while you're fishing and the smell is mostly gone by the time you get back in the evening. The sunscreen is very important, especially tops of hands, ears and nose. Sunburn can spoil an otherwise good day. Bring an old white long sleeve shirt. It's cool and protects you from sun and bugs.Most important is good raingear. You don't need the $300 Gor-Tex outfit neither. I use the $30 Cabelas special. Comes in handy to block the wind on cold morning boat runs too."

520149,NateW,2002-05-13 19:42:00,96,"I'll make this brief, you didn't say what kind of advice, so here goes:Be prepared for anything between 30 degrees and 90 degrees, sometimes on the same day.Never gamble the entire trip cheap or older equipment.If you're going to use lake maps, get a compass, you'll use it.Be careful who you invite to join your group. The wrong guy can make a normally great trip become pure #####.Sure the fishing can be fantastic, if you know how to catch fish. Some people seem to go to Canada expecting fish to tear apart everything thrown at them, It doesn't wortk that way.Obey the rules. If the Canadian Gov't makes a couple rules you don't like, Tough. Deal with it. They don't need our US$ nearly as much as we like to think they do.That's a couple, I'm sure you'll get better fishing ino from somebody else."
520152,DarrenB,2002-05-14 07:23:00,28,"** I second the bugs, they can really be brutal. Bring lots of bug spray, long sleeves, etc..** Of all things to skimp on, do not skimp on a rainsuit. Get a good quality one. Nothing worse than sitting in a boat miles from camp and drenched because your suit fell apart.** Bring a few plastic bags to line the inside of your shoes, boots. They will keep your feet from getting cold and wet.** Be prepared for all weather conditions. Bring sunscreen, scarfs, gloves shorts and a winter coat."
520153,Walleye Wacker,2002-05-14 07:38:00,6,All of the replys you have gotten so far are right on target. Make sure you are prepared for the elements because if you dont it could make your trip a nightmare. While fishing fish SLOW. Early Walleyes can be a little lathargic and a slow bait presentation ON THE BOTTOM can make the difference between eating Walleye or bologana sandwichs. If you are going to jig fish use the lightest jig you can that will get you to the bottom and fish it SLOW. I like to use Leechs and have always had good luck with them. Your outfitter will be a big help about fishing location and presentation...ask him....GOOD LUCK

520154,Seanik,2002-05-14 08:47:00,218,"WakesI did a fly-in with Gardiner Air last year to Partridge/Kesagami Lakes. Ron Barron runs a first rate outfitter service at an affordable cost. He does a thorough pre and post trip camp inspection with you and the previous party, this insures everything works and and is in good condition. August was totally bug free even on the portage over to Kesagami. All we really needed to catch Walleyes and Northerns was a 1/4 oz jig with twister tail tipped with a crawler. As a bonus Ron brought ice cream and pie in on the mid week check. Have a great week and post a report"
