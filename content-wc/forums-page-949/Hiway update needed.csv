521361,Big Fish,2002-06-13 08:18:00,138,Anyone with up to date info on road conditions in the Fort Francis to Vermillion Bay area? Trying to go north Friday or Saturday (13th or 14th). Would it be better to get to Vermillion Bay from Winnipeg or Thunder Bay on 17 than through Fort Francis? Any help is appeciated. Tryed the 800 no. for Ontario hwy. info but got a recording saying you need to enter an access code. cw
