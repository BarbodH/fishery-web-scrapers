521211,Red Lion,2002-06-09 10:35:00,8,What are the current regulations reguarding safety chains for towing boat trailers? Someone just told me that chains that just hooked to the towing vehicle were no longer legal. He thought a more positive attachment was needed such as hooks with snaps or threaded closures. Folks were stopped if they did not meet these regulations. We have six boats and are leaving Friday so I need a quick answer. Thanks for any insight out there.

The chain on the right side should be hooked to the anchor on the left side of the towing auto, and the same the other way. The reason for this is because the crossed chains will create a cradle for the tongue of the trailer to fall into if the hitch or ball breaks."
