Some advice on locating, catching Lake Trout, and Bait suggestion appreciated. The Resort owner says Big Jigs and Daredevils . We do not have downriggers. Are Big Walleyes common in these deep clear waters?"
521306,fishinnut,2002-06-11 08:38:00,642,Pick up a couple snap weights along with weights from 4-8 oz.Snap on line about 10 ft from your lure. Lower to bottom as you slow troll at depth you have found fish on your electronics. Blu rapalas worked for me. Start looking were you have 100 ft of water in area. Low light times are best.
521307,phishfearme,2002-06-11 09:46:00,1242,"eds - go to cabelas.com and enter ""diver seeker"" into the search block. this little $6 item enables you to troll at 50-60 feet (where the trout tend to be this time of year) and also has very little resistance when fighting a fish. attach a 4-5"", skinny, silver, fluttery spoon to the seeker and troll over the deepest water you can find adjusting trolling depths with the seeker.the other good option is getting large minnows - dead or alive - and jigging them of the deepest bottoms you can find."

We were there several weeks ago and the wheel on the car kept getting untracked. Not a whole lot of fun getting it lined up again. With the lower water level, you will find the water to water distance has increased. One boat brought a ""chain saw"" winch device that worked pretty good.Good luckBill"
521309,Guest,2002-06-11 20:49:00,0,Thanx for the advice..I went thru the portage last June and yes it is a pain in the a$$.. I turned the wheel until I was sore.. Not looking forward to putting my new boat on there.. although it is a neat experience to fish the clear waters of Whitefish after being in the Dark Sabaskong water.
521310,Guest,2002-06-12 07:54:00,0,"I agree with the suggestion to use clip-on weights. I have had great luck with those, and use either the floating raps in silver with blue back, or trolling type spoons. I have had better luck with thin silver spoons with green or chartreuse markings, and not necessarily the heavier daredevils. A couple of guys in my group 2 years ago had good luck with a lure called a ""buss bomb"" I think. It is a vertical jigging type lure. Make sure you have good electronics, and look for the big wads of bait fish. I have tried lots of different ways, but the most consistent producer is to cruise around until you find the bait fish, and then troll right through the bait. It seems to me the trout will come up for a lure, but don't go down for one. Oh, and go as slow as possible with plenty of turns. Good luck."
521311,fishinnut,2002-06-12 14:48:00,642,"I think that jigging lure is called a ""Buzz Bomb"". Another good one is a Bomber slab spoon (chrome/blu, chrome/blk or white)."
521312,Guest,2002-06-12 19:52:00,0,"When I was up there last year one of the guides told me they do use Buzz Bombs.. not exactly sure what they are and have not seen them in my favorite catalogs..... I am also thinking of trying one of my favorites.. jigging a Rattle Trap with a small spinner Blade attached to the rear split ring. Dont know if you guys ever tried this, but I use the tiny traps thru the ice and they really wake up the fish at times."
