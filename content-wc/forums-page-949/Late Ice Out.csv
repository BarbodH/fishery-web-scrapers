521326,Atlanta Dave,2002-06-11 17:39:00,323,We are leaving Thursday for Lake Athabasca. Got a call yesterday from the camp owner that the lake is solid ice only the small bays are open. He says that area northern alberta and Saskatchawn is running about 3 weeks late on ice out. We face a week of fishing one bay if the ice doesnt break soon. Just posting some information.Atlanta Dave
521327,Piscatorian,2002-06-11 20:43:00,12,It has been really warm up there the last several days...with some luck it will continue and your trip may be saved. I hope it's great -- we rocked 'em on the 15 to the 22 last year. I hope to see Cordell and folks next year. Best of luck.
