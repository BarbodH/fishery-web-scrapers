521360,MN_Moose,2002-06-13 07:59:00,965,"As far as I know, there is no regulatioon on quantity. Like anything else, ""reasonable and proper"". The crawlers must be in a manufactured bedding. No dirt is acceptable. As for your nephew traveling with you, you should have a regular birth certificate. Do not copy the original. A duplicate can be obtained at the court house or location of records. You should also carry a note from the parents with a phone number where they can be reached.Good luck"
