Could anyone suggest a reputable taxidermist in Manitoba (preferably Wpg as I frequent the city on occasion) that does a great job? (Also, any good or bad experiences with taxidermists in MB?)"
521181,Guest,2002-06-09 18:55:00,0,"Hi bobbyI have used Mr. Fish on two occasions and he has done a great job on both fish. I can't say at this moment whether he does replicas but I believe he does. His phone # is (204)667-8306 or e-mail @ [email protected] I have heard that Telesky Taxidermy does a good job also and they do replicas. Phone # is (204)775-6796 or e-mail @ [email protected]Hope this helps, if you need more info you can e-meil me @ [email protected]Le pic"

521185,Bobby,2002-06-12 02:03:00,211,"Thanks for the advice guys. I'm going to check out MrFish and Telesky. I saw a site on the web for Hawkins - they've gotten away from replicas and now refer you to a business in the US, $10 per inch in US funds (ouch)."
521186,Northern Manitoban,2002-06-12 23:29:00,195,Are you sure Hawkins is doing that? i had them do a replica for me 3 years ago a (Walleye) and when i was in thier show room they praised about the replica mounts and they do an awesome job.FISH ON.
