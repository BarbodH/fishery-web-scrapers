We would pull one or two off the traditional spots, but even marking fish was very hard. There were many guests at lodges that didnt see one walleye all week. I even had a rough time, and Im going on my 14th year going up there at least twice a year.The water is still very cold. Surface temp in mid 50's, and low fortys a few feet down. No thermocline that I could see yet. No new vegetation anywere with the exception of Billings bay back in pistol. That being said though, the northerns were going nuts. Caught more big fish than I have ever before, but than again, never fished for Northerns that much before either. Lots of fish in the mid 30's.Muskie were starting to school up back in Pistol in the shallows.Smallmouth were more active than I expected. Biggest by my bother just over 20"".There was practicly no wind, so the water wasnt mixing at all. I'm sure it is going to take off any day now as the fish were slowly moving on the reefs and points.The locals say the water levels are normal, though it does look low to me with hardly any current. Even down the river by the Dalls the water was hardly moving.Good luck to all going, See you up there again in August!Ron<{{}}><"

521255,Reels,2002-06-11 08:20:00,2876,"I'd say it's still pretty early. Some of the females were starting to get fat with eggs, but not alot.We fished Mine bay wich is usaully a pretty good indicator, but only yanked a few from there. When they are about to bust, that bay is loaded with them.<{{}}><"
521256,brian1785,2002-06-11 11:04:00,1534,We're leaving this Friday (14th) to go to Minaki. Any suggestions for walleye? Thanks everyone.
521257,Reels,2002-06-11 11:59:00,2876,"The spots that were starting to produce were Bowers, Rasberry, NE side of Burnt, and Wilson's Rock. They should be in full swing by the time your there.Like I said in my earlier post, Muskies were starting to bed in the shallows in Pistol. Its a blast to watch even if you dont catch one. <{{}}><"
