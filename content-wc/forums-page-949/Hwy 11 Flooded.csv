Mike gave a number to call for highway information: in Canada it is 1-800-473-2030; in the US, it is 807-473-2100. Terry"

Some of the highways have numerous washouts and water is still over some. The Lavalle Bridge West of Fort Frances has shifted so it is a right off. Be sure to call ahead before making any plans for a while.:( Note: Rainy Lake has risen more than 21/2 feet in just three days!
