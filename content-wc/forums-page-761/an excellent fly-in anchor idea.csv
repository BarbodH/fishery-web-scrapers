BRILLIANT!! it works - it's cheap - and it's light. hope this helps. - phish"

547986,Bellcon,2005-05-16 09:45:00,2,This is a very popular technique in the Boundary Waters and Quetico. Light weight and effective. Good info. Bellcon

I do like the idea of the basketball net though, it would allow for a larger heavier rock, though I have never had problems with the amount of weight you can get in an onion sack. Great ideas here on WC!!! Hawker"
