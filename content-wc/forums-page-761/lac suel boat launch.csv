547963,Larry S,2005-05-15 09:53:00,666,"Right up the 105 from where you are staying, a couple of miles is Gold Arrow camp . The owner Don Moore has many boats on a number of lakes down logging roads in the area. Maybe he will rent you a boat on one of theses lakes. You can call his camp at 1-807-529-3137 or go to his website at fishandhuntontario.com. Call him Don loves to talk fishing Larry S"

Pickrel Creek has boat caches on a number of lakes on Aureobus road, as well as acess up the creek to Pickrel Lake. I know he has a boat on Sand Lake, a good pike lake,and that you could luanch your boat in that lake as well. He also has acess/caches on most of the same lakes as Gold Arrow, out on that set of roads. You can catch walleye on Fleet lake or try Lake trout on Schultze lake, he has a boat on both. For Lac Suel,I'd go up 105 just past Scout Lake resort's acess, you'll see a sign for a public acess there. But it's a big lake for a newbie and no guide."

I am going up with a big group of firemen and they have had a few meeting with him, they all had nothing but good things to say about him. i cant wait till september, sounds like a great area to spend a week fishing."
547978,Guest,2005-05-15 23:57:00,0,"Hi. If you are going to lac saul put your boat in at the ramp under the dam, its around the golf course I think, anyway I think the best fishing is below the dam. there will probably a number of boats in the ""spot"" so you know where to anchor. You will get your limit in a day and I dont think there is any slot size here. a word to the wise!"
