547073,Guest,2005-04-17 17:51:00,0,"I've been going to Gullrock since 1992. I love it, and look forward to a week of hard fishing every year. We have been at Weaver's (now Wright's) for eight years. It is a fishing camp. I want to think that Wright's have it to keep in the same tradition as Weaver's did. The best fishing camp on Gullrock. Jet ski's etc. are not what fishermen want, and I am not driving 17 hours to listen to that stuff on what is otherwise a peaceful and beatiful piece of solitude. I like going there, I have never even heard any music from the other cabins, just an occasional outburst of laughter over a card game or something. It is truly a vacation - and the fishing is awesome. I sure hope they keep it a ""Wilderness Camp"", and I am sure they will. That is what 99% of their clients want. Lee wouldn't take a camp that has the best reputation on the lake and throw it down the sink! If the jet skis start up, we are out of there. I am betting my vacation that there won't be any of that stuff. That is what we have at home, and that isn't CANADA to me (or my group). Keep it the same - Please."

I look forward to coming to your place this summer - we had a great time last year (as we have in the past). I think you guys have a great future. I want you to know that 99% of your clients are SO relieved at your comments. Keep up the good work!

547075,Guest,2005-04-17 18:33:00,0,"You have just booked a trip on one of the finest walleye lakes in Ontario. If you have consistent weather, you are in for a ball. Either way, it will be one of the best fishing trips of your life, but if you get two days of the same wind, you are not going to believe how many walleyes will show up in the same place at the same time. There are many standard places to go. By the end of June, the fish should be spread out throughout the lake. Fish the wind and the structure (but mostly the wind if you are lucky enough to get it). Fishing on Gullrock is so good, that most people fish during the day, but morning and evening are excellent (it is just hard to get up early everyday after fishing for 10 - 12 hours). Fish will be as shallow at 4 feet and as deep as 35 at that time of the year, but I would guess you will find fishin the 12 - 18 foot depth the most. We use leeches and crawlers, but minnows are also good. We use leeches and crawlers because of money (you can bring crawlers in bedding across the border, but not leeches). Cranks also work well, especially in the evening. Fish what ever you have confidence in, and it will work. Most camps will have minnows and leeches on hand. * There are some huge Northern Pike too if you want to go after them. The owners association has some pretty good guidelines as to conserving the resource (that is why the lake is so good). You will catch good numbers of fish, and you will also catch some nice size ones to. Bring good rain gear, because you are not going to want to waste a day sitting in the cabin. And even though you will be there at the end of June, you will want to pack clothes for everything from snow to a heat wave. I have gone as early as June 2 and stayed as late as June 25. I have fished in snow on a couple of occasions, and I was also there once when it was 107 F.! Plan for anything. At that time of year, it is usually in the 40's - 50's in the morning, and will reach 70's - 80's at mid day (perfect). The bugs on the lake won't be too bad, but on shore at night they can be. The flies can reach you in the boat if there is no wind, so always have pants and socks in the boat. The flies can also be bad for shore lunch if it is hot and no wind. Other than that - the bugs really are not bad. A word of experience - Gullrock can get really rough out in the big lake (some of the best fishing is in that big wind), but there are many turns and islands that can always provide some shelter, and you will find some fish in every part of the lake (even right by your camp - where ever that is). Have your rain gear with you at all times (sometimes you just need it to keep dry on the boat ride back home if it gets rough). - And if you are on the lake for the first time, have a good map and don't cut corners close cutting through islands and points (rocks) until you know which ones are safe. There are not too many rock hazard, but have your camp owner identify on your map places to look out for. Believe me, if there is a rock in that lake, I have found it with my boat - but it is a pretty safe lake overall (Keg Lake has more rock dangers). * You may also want to carry some spare gas in your boat, the lake is much, much bigger than you think with all of those islands, etc. If you are doing any long distance running, you could run out of gas (done that before too, and have towed many a boat to camp as well). - Sounds fun huh? - Some of my favorite memories - I can't wait to get up there just thinking about it. Have a great time, and remember, let those big ones go, we all want to take a turn with those. Bring a camera (or two). Good luck!"

547936,grt1,2005-05-14 07:14:00,259,it's always the neighbours that force the Gullrock Tackle factory to shut down production early. Cant blame them for much else than that.
547092,Guest,2005-04-18 09:30:00,0,"Nipper, The owners association ask that you let everything over 18 inches go, unless you are going to keep a real trophy (a trophy is a trophy). Replica trophies are encouraged, but a real pig would be OK to keep. You can keep fish for lunch or to take home, just try to let everything over 18"" go. It has really made a difference in this lake."
547118,Guest,2005-04-18 19:20:00,0,"Well, I Just wanted to let you hard core fishing guys know, I just turn down a reservation. It was the girls that work for HOOTERS in Des Monies they said they wanted to do some walleye fishing but also some topless water sking. I told them to try a camp in Minniesota."
547119,Guest,2005-04-18 19:46:00,0,"Hey, Hooters and jet skis puts a whole different light on the subject. You might have a gold mine there! Oh well, I will just stick with my fishing I guess."
547120,Hump,2005-04-18 20:11:00,578,"Bud: Not a real sacrifice, I've been to Hooters in Des Moines. Now put some Minnesota lovies on those jet skis and you will have a show!"
547139,zugbug,2005-04-19 12:04:00,67,"Big Poppa, Wow, your on the information super highway. First you buy a boat and now you are on the computer! You are one crazy dude! Even you will catch fish on Gull Rock. Got to run, it's Tuesday and you know what that means! Yup, it's Drink Like a Fish Night! I'll hold a bar stool for you! ZugBug"
547148,nipper7272,2005-04-20 07:58:00,23,Zugbug always nice to hear from you. Thanks again for all the information. I look forward to the trip. Nipper
547233,grt1,2005-04-24 15:15:00,259,"If you have drink like a fish night on Tuesday, you will probably enjoy ""thirsty thursdays"" that we observe on Gullrock Lake. It is probably one of the most anticipated days of the week."
547290,Guest,2005-04-25 21:28:00,0,I believe Thursday is the only day the Gullrock tackle factory closes early. You get in any trouble last thursday Billy I told Malinda it was Mike fault because he built such a big ice shack and it take so much work to get back to his house that you just have to drink more wobbley pop to replenish the system.
547449,MJ,2005-04-29 18:02:00,11,I agree. That is one of the reasons we go there. We stay at South Bay and if there are jet skis anywhere around us we will never go back.
547455,Guest,2005-04-30 10:15:00,0,"we've done really well in gull jigging tipped with minnows in the evenings, otherwise pull lindy's during the daytime"
547085,Guest,2005-04-17 20:51:00,0,"Thanks Lee, for setting the record straight!!. After fifteen years our group of nine to sixteen would have been looking to a lake without jet skis- had they choose to make an appearance. Now that we know that they won't be at camp,(or at any other camp on this lake) we will see you the third week in June."
547089,nipper7272,2005-04-18 07:51:00,23,Thanks for all the great information. I greatly appreciate it and look forward to a wonderful time fishing. Thanks for letting me know about the catch and release plan we will follow it to the tee. Have a Great summer Thanks again --Nipper
547047,nipper7272,2005-04-16 07:56:00,23,I just booked a trip on Gullrock at the end of June. Can anyone tell me what the fishing is like and what to expect? Thanks for your help
547048,Hump,2005-04-16 09:06:00,578,"I have fished Gullrock for the past 16 years. it is like any other lake, depends on weather. I have seen excellent years and others not so great. i think the slot has helped with bigger fish. It is a fairly easy lake to fish and I am sure you will enjoy your trip."
547049,Guest,2005-04-16 10:41:00,0,We have fished their the past 4 years in early June. Going againg the second week of June. Great fishing each year. The lake has lots of options of places to fish and is easy to navigate on. The fish size has increased each year. 22-25 inchers pretty comon with lots in the slot size also for eaters. We just have a ball catching the eyes their. Good Luck fishing
547051,mrwalleyesneighbor,2005-04-16 12:50:00,10,Unknown to where you're staying but I have heard that Wrights Wildnerness Camp also has great blueberry picking for their customers. They cater to the family as they waterski and tube. Also heard they may be getting jet skis.
547057,Guest,2005-04-16 21:31:00,0,"If Lee starts up with jet skis, we'll leave his camp & Gullrock Lake & head further north or go on a fly out. If I want to listen to jet skis I can do that at home."
547058,mrwalleyesneighbor,2005-04-16 21:59:00,10,"I know alot of the fishermen feel that way. Lee told our group last year that he is trying to cater more towards the ""family"" and give everyone something to do. While we were there I seen he and his fiancee ""maybe wife now?"" take a few people out on a tube and race around the camp. And he advised that he wanted to try to bring in a ""younger"" crowd to his camp. I also seen someone post on here earlier about the blueberry picking around the area. I think it's great, not everyone wants to go to gull rock to fish and that's who Wrights is trying to cater to. I wish him luck."
547059,Guest,2005-04-17 05:56:00,0,"I agree with Rafter. If I want to listen to jet skis or someone pulling people around on a tube, I can stay home and have that."
547061,Guest,2005-04-17 06:52:00,0,somehow it seems that a wilderness camp and a jet ski don't belong in the same sentence. i hate those noisy things.
547062,Guest,2005-04-17 07:51:00,0,Hey Hump when you going to be up on Gullrock this year. I talked to you in the fish house last year. We'll be there the 2nd. week in June.
547064,Guest,2005-04-17 10:51:00,0,"Tubing, skis, waverunners...that's what Minnesota lakes are for! Canadian lakes and especially Gullrock are for 'Eyes!!!! Tell him to buy a resort in Minnesota if he wants a ""younger"" crowd. Gullrock Association owners need to step in here. Craig"
