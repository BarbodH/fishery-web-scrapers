I don't know if you've narrowed your search down any, but you will probably find, ultimately that the size of walleyes on any given trip may not coincide with the quality of experience. Some people come up here to troll big, bumpy and somtimes crowded waters just for that chance of the fish of a lifetime. Many others, enjoy lakes and rivers that offer above average fishing for 3 or more different species with chances of trophies for most species. Still, others love to catch lots and lots of fish of a couple species in a lake they have all to themselves. Maybe tell us a bit more about the experience you're after and we'll probably be able to help you out a little better."
536352,Mahumba,2004-01-06 21:20:00,345,"Hi American, Although I agree with bigfish I do have to say that there are many sleeper lakes in Ontario. The lake I catch my big walleye on is a lake 1.5 miles long and no more than a mile wide. If you want a better than average chance at 10 lb+ walleye fish Oligotrophic Lakes (Lakes with Lake trout in them) The forage base in these lakes consist of ciscos, smelts and suckers. This forage base grows big fish. If you are in Minnesota I'm just north of you (Thunder Bay Ontario) if you go through the pidgeon river border crossing I'm half way between Thunder Bay and the border. Email me if you are gonna travel this route. I can meet you for a coffee. Roger Mayer."
536361,Guest,2004-01-07 15:03:00,0,In NW Ontario the bulk of the really big Walleyes are caught Ice Fishing in our group. Thw window from late March to mid April is perfect. The days are warm and Spring is in the air. Just make sure that you are experienced or partnered with an experienced late season fisherman and are well equipped.
547949,Guest,2005-05-14 20:05:00,0,Anyone who ever fished Pine Falls Manitoba in October WILL tell you 10 plus lb Walleye are a sure bet. This even applies to the poorest of fishermen...
547953,Guest,2005-05-15 01:20:00,0,Nice gorg oh.............. talk like a dunce and make everyone else north of the 49th look bad You really do lots for tourism. Have you ever thought of checking out employment as a boat anchor? From: A REAL CANADIAN !!
547965,Guest,2005-05-15 11:03:00,0,I agree with Greenbacks....Pine Falls(Winnipeg River) and Selkirk(Red River) produce some huge walleyes in the fall.Decent launches and easy to fish with smaller boats.
536330,McQ,2004-01-06 10:04:00,615,"The walleye range in Canada is from Quebec in the east to Alberta in the west. Big fish can be found virtually anywhere. For example, the Province where I live Quebec has over a million lakes and any number of them can yield a + 10 pounder. The Ottawa river that is the border between Ontario & Quebec is another factory, the St. Lawrence river that drains Lake Ontario comes to mind, as Bigfish mentioned earlier Erie & Lake Ontario consistantly produce big walleye catches. For a supreme thrill try the Bay of Quinte in the late fall - catches up to 15 pounds are frequent, LOTW and Lac Suel in North Western Ontario, the Lake Winnipeg system and Red River in Manitoba, Tobin, Diefenbaker and La Ronge in Saskatchewan or Lesser Slave in Alberta all can provide you with a chance for a 10 pounder and there are many more. Having fished them all I would settle on the Bay of Quinte in November for a trophy opportunity of a lifetime. check out the photo gallery at http://groups.msn.com/McQonFishing for Superdad's Quinte gallery if you want a little incentive."
536331,Guest,2004-01-06 11:02:00,0,I would love to see your mental image of a map of Canada. Evidently you do not have a grasp of how gigantic a piece of real estate you refer to when you ask a question like that. Perhaps you could narrow it down to a couple hundred thousand square miles?

536332,Guest,2004-01-06 13:12:00,0,In the first place it is illegal to shoot big walleye...most fish for that matter. Secondly those rumours about Canadians being nice and the lakes beautiful are questionable. Ten months of winter and two months of black flies does strange things to people. When it comes to releasing walleye.....we feed all walleye over 5 pounds to our sled dogs. Anyways it is likely that the border will be closed in retaliation for the US jr hockey win over the Canadians. We've already stopped the import of US potatoes and now US dog food...next on the list ..US walleye fishermen!:P

536334,Guest,2004-01-06 14:07:00,0,I am so excited to visit your country. Would you believe that I grew up in Minnesota and have never visited Canada! I can't wait. Where are you from in Canada? I would love to stop by and get advise on the area lakes! I bet the either the zip lure or the flying lure would work best huh? Please! Throw those 5 lb fish back! Save some for my dog.

536321,Guest,2004-01-06 14:32:00,0,"Where from? Well....from the land of the midnight sun, the frozen tundra, where the two favourite colours are Blue and Blue Light, where the women are all three hundred pounds with legs shaped like giant turnips and covered in spandex track pants, where all the men wear toques and gotch, where the family sedan is yellow and has skis, where beer comes in a two-four, and the only black widow we know is the one that hitched a ride in the bananas from Mexico. By the way never heard of the zip bait....is it similar to the zipper bait or pant-ham?:P"

536307,Guest,2004-01-05 18:59:00,0,OKAY what is the best lake to catch monster walleyes up there?
536325,Guest,2004-01-05 20:52:00,0,If I had to pick one for trophy 'eyes it would be Tobin.

536326,Guest,2004-01-06 07:11:00,0,"Dumb question....you will end up with a list of lakes that is meaningless. And why just ask Canadians....we hardly have time between building igloos and being lumberjacks to do any fishing. Besides all lakes up here have ""monster"" walleye...depending on your definition of ""monster"". If you have to ask the question it is likely your fishing skills are such that you wouldn't be able to catch one anyways!"

536327,bigfish1965,2004-01-06 08:09:00,3210,"If you want big fish, you need big water. There are only 2 lakes where I would say a trohpy is a sure thing. Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. They both have big water and a big forage base. Lake Ontario may become the preeminent lake soon since salmon and smelt numbers are way down. ( Smelt eat tons of walleye fry, and salmon compete for the alwewives and shad.) All my 10 pound plus fish have come off Ontario. The Bay of Quinte in early November is your best bet for anything 14 pounds plus."
