547889,Guest,2005-05-13 08:07:00,0,Thanks for the input. We have been going to Lac Seul for about 6-7 years but always fished up in Chamberlain Narrows. First time down on this part of the lake.
547890,wooglin,2005-05-13 08:30:00,371,"We launch on Lost Lake and boat right past the Lost Island Lodge everyday...we have no problem boating a ton of fish all day long, within 20 minutes of where you'll be staying....you'll get them, trust me. No guide needed, unless you want one of course, just fish windy shores and points, drop offs...etc. Its not hard to get on them! Good luck, let us know how you do."
547900,Guest,2005-05-13 10:56:00,0,"Yep, you should have a great time at Lost Island; been going there for 5-6 years. Walleye fishing is great, but the pike fishing I would say is average. I wouldn't hesitate taking some crawlers along, even at that time. Plan on using plenty of gas; but to compensate for the high gas prices you can make some money by asking Slow Joe, sorry, I mean JD Lundman for a boat race. He's legendary!"
547947,Tyee Guy,2005-05-14 12:13:00,717,"Joe, That wasn't me...Had to be Terry!!!!!!! Besides, we know that Basel has the dreaded ""Skeg Award"" in the dining room........"
547999,Guest,2005-05-16 15:56:00,0,"Slow Joe?! Funny guy Surfer! Hard for a big ol' Lund to beat those cute bouncing Barbie boats. Besides, Jim cheated. You're right Doc, my lower unit is still in tact! JD"
547605,Guest,2005-05-05 15:20:00,0,"We are heading to Lost Island Lodge on the 28th of May. Anyone been up there that time of year that could give us any useful information? Do they fish in the immediate area? How is the road into the landing? I'm getting ""pumped"" so don't be afraid to lie to me that will get me even more excited."
547608,Guest,2005-05-05 15:39:00,0,"Son, The road in is just like Interstate and the Resort has been the #1 Canada Fishing Resort for years. The Beer is always chilled just right and the girls that serve it are all graduates of Hooters. The boats are fast, light and have automatic Fish Finders in them. Son, Im not talking about normal Depth Finders, these babys put you on the Lake Hogs. I mean big lake Hogs, make sure that you dont try to put any of them in the boat . Those fish are so big and so mean that the boys back at camp will be calling you Stub if you arent careful. The minnows they have are big and lively and if the fish wont bite the minnows the minnows will bite the fish. Now that we are talking about fish, lookout Son, you better have some tough equipment and one strong back. Those big old Hogs will deliver a caboose kicking on you like you never have seen before. I seriously recommend that you have a back brace with you and a elbow wrap or you could get a dreaded case of Walleye Elbow from the jarring attack that those Hogs will lay on you. Outside of all that I have told you make sure that you have a big enough camera to get the whole fish in the lens....they are big and mean. GOOD LUCK, ENJOY"
547615,Guest,2005-05-05 19:45:00,0,"Boy.. I say SON.... look at me, when I'm talkin to ya!! Them Hogs will put the Hurt on you if you arent payin attention"
547616,hawkeye,2005-05-05 21:51:00,112,"Fished that area for 27 years but now put in at the boat ramp, its steep concrete with scattered gravel on it, I have a 17 foot heavy -lund Pro 115 hp. motor. My prevous front wheel drive van would not pull it out. No problem with any rear wheel drive. I always carry a nylon tow belt. I started fishing there years ago the last week in May but moved to last week in June and 1st part of Sept. Now I fly into Trout Lake just East of Red Lake the last week of May and catch a lot of Trout and Walleyes back in the bays. Our number one place from Lost Island was nearby Italian bay, Go in to the bay about 1000' then on your left will be a small cove 50' wide x 30' in width, huge boulers on each side, used to sit outside with three boat pulling walleyes out. also troll up shoreline 1000' to point. Also pike fishing around sandbar across from cove, if water up sandbar may be slightly under water. We fish up in the Bear Narrows area now. Used to have good fishing in the back of lost lake clear back two where Lynx Lake drains into Lost Lake, Lot of Northern close into sunny shores. Will send a marked map if you want. E-Mail if you want. PS. I always felt that early spring shallow walleyes quit hitting at 11:00 am and started up around 4:00pm if sun was out because of their eyes. We then Northern fished. Also bass fishing just above swimming beach up from boat ramp. Also good road, watch for Boat Ramp sign on your right before you get to Hudson. Was a sand road when I started."
547675,orchard frank,2005-05-07 10:49:00,1900,"Been going there for a dozen yrs, I was there the same week you're talking about last year, it was COLD, take warm clothes and a rainsuit. Fishing will be fine, no problem with the road, just go slow if you are pulling a boat. If you get to Hudson, you went too far, watch on the right for signs, there are 2, first a ramp ahead then one at the road going down. Basel or somebody at camp will mark a map for you, or better yet go out for a day with him. At the far western end of Webster Bay, there is a sand bar sticking out from the left as you go to the back, with a steep bank. Killed them there last year, nice boat ride, can't get lost, only one way in and out, they will mark it for you. If you are standing on the docks, look right, 2 small islands with a saddle between and a flat behind them, good spot, everybody skips it, ""too close to camp"" There are some shallow rocks off to the left before you get there, may be under water, be careful, if you head straight for the islands you'll be okay, stay to the right. Send me an email if you want."
547678,Guest,2005-05-07 12:15:00,0,I just sit on the dock and catch all my fish . The only Hog I see all day is when Bubba gets his fat xxx back to the dock. The only reason Bubba ever comes in is to get more beer or eat.
547679,Guest,2005-05-07 19:21:00,0,"This is the same area we fish. I camp at Country Camping, which is about 4 miles East of the launch you are speaking of. We launch there, and fish in the area of the little bridge you must pass under prior to getting to Websters Bay. Can you tell me a little more of that sand bar on the West side of Websters bay? We are looking venture further this year, so all help is appreciated. Also, instead of going west to Websters Bay, have you ever went East over towards Deception Bay? We did a day long trip that way last year, which is where some of the forrest fires went through the year before...not a ton of luck, got a few, but nothing to brag about. Thanks!"
547711,tlars,2005-05-09 12:48:00,137,My wife and I are also heading there on 5/28. We are first timers and Lost Island. We'll be in the Sylvan with the Evinrude tiller. Let's have a beer!
547736,Guest,2005-05-10 09:27:00,0,We will be a group of about 11 guys in one of the housekeeping cabins. Stop on by.
547886,Guest,2005-05-13 07:59:00,0,Been going there for 10 years or so twice a year. I'll be there the same week. Fishing is awesome but I'm one of those guys that have to travel 20 miles by boat to fish. But we don't have any trouble boating 100 walleyes per boat per day. If it's your first trip I would highly recommend hiring Basel for a day. You won't be sorry. See you there. JD
