547825,Frankm,2005-05-12 06:21:00,154,I'm not sure of the water temps. I sent an email up to our camp. They said the ice on Pakwash went out on Apr 21. I would think they are done spawning at this point.
547853,Guest,2005-05-12 15:42:00,0,"thanks for the reply frankm. Say were are you staying and when. Our group of fellas is staying at Rowes snake falls resort on memorial day weekend and thru the week, maybe run into ya up on highline, the trout river or first bay!"
547863,Frankm,2005-05-12 19:13:00,154,"We stay at Ciancis right on Trout River. We are going to be up there a week before you. I caught my 43"" Pike in Highline Bay. We've had pretty good luck in East Lake the last few year. Good Luck! Make sure you let us know how you did."
547942,bromes,2005-05-14 09:29:00,3,"Hopefully it warms up, I guess they had snow yesterday. Hopefully not like last year rained pretty much the whole week and COLD. We've pulled some nice pike from highline ourselves over last few years. Were is east lake by the way? Will let you know how it goes."
547951,Frankm,2005-05-14 20:08:00,154,Yeah I hope it warms up too. East Lake is on the Trout River towards Bruce right after the camps (Ciancis and Trout River Lodge). On your map you should see East Lake on the East side of river. Its a small lake with pretty good depth as well as shallow spots. Scenery is very nice and fishing has been getting good. On the East side there is a nice point 12ft deep. You can jig for Walleye or fish for Pike. Also it is a nice place to get out of the weather.
