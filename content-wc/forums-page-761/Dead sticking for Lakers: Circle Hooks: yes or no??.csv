Every year we dead stick w/ smelt and after we land them, we photograph and release Lakers greater than about 5 lbs. However, the treble hooks we use in the smelt are by that time in the stomach, so we take care to handle the Laker gently, and minimally, CUT the line and let it go. I'm operating on the belief the hook is broken down by digestion in it's gut. Is the circle hook effective/better? We don't wan to miss the ""runs"" when we set the hook. Also, are the hooks broken down by digestion? Thanks. Andy"
547617,Guest,2005-05-05 23:37:00,0,Hi. the one hook we found in the stomach of a fish had been completely enveloped in stomach tissue and it had not disolved at all.
547630,Guest,2005-05-06 08:40:00,0,"Read an article recently, an interview with a taxidermist, where they showed a photo of part of his collection of hardware removed from muskies brought to his shop. Pretty ugly, the hooks and bits of leader appeared not to have decayed at all. Completely changed my mind about the hook dissolving notion. I've seen a fish with a hook hanging out its rear orifice and line goung back up inside, so I know sometimes fish can pass hooks though their system, but I imagine that if the gets stuck it is there for the duration. Amazing they survive at all with a hook in their guts, but many of them do."
547632,Guest,2005-05-06 09:04:00,0,"In most cases, if a hook is swallowed the fish will die. The old thought that a hook dissolves has been dispelled over time. It is better to use a quick strike rig, using your circle hook idea is a good one also, just don't let them chew and swallow for such a long time. Your intentions are good, and I commend you on that.

547640,troutaholic,2005-05-06 10:51:00,827,"I have to politely disagree with the debunking of the hook dissolving myth. Several years ago, I was fishing off the banks of the Mississippi for walleyes. I had a bite and set the hook and found that I was snagged. before I could snap it off, my other pole had a bite. I caught a nice 18-inch 'eye that I put on the stringer. I rebaited and cast it out. I went to work on the snagged rod and found out that there was a fish on the end - a 16-inch 'eye hooked deep. When I was cleaning the fish, the 16-incher had the remains of at least 3 hooks besides my own. - Only the eyelet remained on one - Eyelet, shank, partial bend of hook - Everything but the tip (could barely see were the barb was) In all honesty, it was one cool series. It was as if this fish waited for fishermen to get snagged on that particular snag and then ate the hook/bait!! I had put the remnants aside, thinking that I would display them at a later date. Unfortunately, I misplaced them. I even showed them to the wife who thought that it was pretty wierd!! Just Rip Lips and Keep a Tight Line"
547643,Guest,2005-05-06 11:53:00,0,"Troutaholic, That is interesting, and I'm sure it does happen at times. I think as a general rule, a swallowed hook is likely to cause mortality. Not all the time mind you, as your case clearly points out. I think my main point is to try to stay with a quicker method of setting the hook. The circle hook is a good idea, quick strike rigs, or any method where you don't give the fish time to fully swallow the hook. It's always better for the fish to remove it from the mouth, then to leave it inside. But your point that some dissolve is definately valid. All the best, Agate"
547926,Guest,2005-05-13 16:02:00,0,"Hooks left in fishes' mouths or in fishes stomachs DO NOT DISSOLVE - this is an incredibly dangerous ""wive's tale"" - circle hooks are incredible for big cats which are notoruius swallowers so they should work just fine for lakers - Larry"
547939,Guest,2005-05-14 07:47:00,0,Larry: I always thought so; this year I am tossing the trebles and using the circle hooks. Thanks.
547960,phern,2005-05-15 09:29:00,151,"Many hooks for sale are resistant to corrosion. This may explain the discrepancy whether or not hooks are rapidly dissolved by the fish's digestive system. From what I have read about circle hooks, I would opt for circle hooks for dead sticking. However, you must use larger size hooks to decrease the chance of hooking in the stomach of the fish. Don't worry, the circle hook works great. When the hook is not swallowed into the stomach, the fish starts to move away with the bait and hook in his mouth. This slow movement is like a slow hook set which is perfect for large circle hooks. A fast hook set with circle hooks will almost certainly extract the hook from the fish's mouth. Here is an excellent article on circle hooks: http://www.in-fisherman.com/magazine...ks/index1.html"
