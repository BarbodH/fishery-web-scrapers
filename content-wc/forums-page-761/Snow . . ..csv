I remember last year it was 12"" on May 12, now this year 4"" on Friday The 13th!! I continue to hope a long cold spring like last year won't repeat. Looking at the week ahead going into opener, daytime highs are forecast in the 50's but with nightime lows at about freezing. Regardless, things still look better and warmer than last year's opener. Plus it appears the much earlier ice-out could pay off . . . walleyes have been witnessed on spawning beds or roaming spawning territory for the past week."

A few weeks ago I was thinking the weather is so warm, by the time opener comes the walleye will be spawned out, well fed, and cleared out of spawning areas. Now....nope! I'm just hoping they'll be done spawning and willing to eat something. Groan...."
