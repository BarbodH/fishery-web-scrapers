547931,Guest,2005-05-13 22:36:00,0,GONE THERE 3 TIMES..LOTS OF SMALL NORTHERN. ENOUGE WALLEYE TO EAT SOME MEALS THERE. WE GO FIRST WEEK OF AUGUST.
547940,joepa,2005-05-14 08:26:00,366,"Mike, We made reservations there for 1st week of September. The camp owner said the walleye should be moving down the lake more towards the camp at that time. I hope we didn't make a mistake! Can you tell me more about the camp and lake? Did you stop going there for a reason?"
547941,Guest,2005-05-14 09:19:00,0,going again first week of august. glen the owner will show you spots to catch northern and walleye. we use spinners for northern and jigs with nightcrawlers for walleye. we found more walleyes farther up the lake.although last year we did catch many in front of the cabin.dont be afraid to try lots of places. Mike
