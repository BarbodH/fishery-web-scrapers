From reading this forum and other info, it seems like Lac Seul is Shangri-la for walleyes. So I am thinking of trailering our boat to Hudson, getting a guide to take us to Lac Seul for a day (probably Friday or Saturday, at the end of the week), then reload the boat and drive it back to our lodge on Minnitaki and home. Any thoughts or suggestions as to the feasibility of this plan? How long would it take to go from Hudson to good fishing spots on Lac Seul? It is not that I am fed up with fishing on Minnitaki. The stats cited on this forum for big fish per day etc. from Lac Seul are much better than anyone I have heard of on Minnitaki in three trips there. Thanks."

I've been to Lac Seul for 21 years and have found, at least for me, that the numbers and size are up by Bear Narrows, Chamberlain narrows or Wapesi bay. Unfortunately thats about 45 miles by boat. Others have said that fishing is real good in Lost lake or Websters bay which is about 5-6 miles by boat from the Hudson landing. I have found that there is great fishing down in SE bay of Minntaki so I don't have to travel as far. If it was me and you want to try Lac Seul, I would go to the Deception landing and go up to Sen bay which I have found to be good in the summer."

547768,hawkeye,2005-05-10 20:45:00,112,"I second what Jabs said, this will be my 28 year. Started out of Hudson and Minnitaki. The world famous walleye fishing starts North of Deception Light to Bear narrows and West to Grassey Bay. Great numbers of Walleye go way up North and spawn in four different rivers then come back down only as far as the feeding flats to the places Jabs and I mentioned. Need at least 50hp. We now have a 115. We don't go north of Chamberland Narrows anymore. You and your friends might consider taking a week in a house boat up to that area, they will take you up there, tell you where to fish. Your 25hp will be big enough, you pull them behind you. In a week you will know the area and have some great fishing."
547774,Guest,2005-05-11 06:20:00,0,Deception landing is about 15 miles north of town. past the airport. It's a nicer landing than the one at Hudson.
547777,wooglin,2005-05-11 07:39:00,371,"Thanks! Can you provide a bit more information than that, meaning what HWY do you take to get there and what body of water you launch into? Is it launching into Deception Lake or River or Bay? Thanks!"
547938,scar,2005-05-14 07:39:00,196,"jabs, would you be willing to share any spots on south east bay i know the real obvious such as minnicau creek bay and english but haven't had much success else where in that area. scar"
547946,Guest,2005-05-14 11:46:00,0,"There are some humps on the south side of the 2 islands as you pull in to southeast bay. Mine shaft narrows, west side of Kendell island"
547958,scar,2005-05-15 08:34:00,196,"jabs, thanks for the info on minnitaki. do you mean the two islands directly to the north of kendall island and then how far south? and when you mention west of kendall island do you mean the shallow rocks that extend all the way to the mainland? also we will be trying lac seul for sure and i saw your post regarding the deception landing. after putting in there how far/where to go to catch eyes? do you live up there and are you available as a guide if you do? we will be up may 25 - 30 and june 15 - 22. thanks for all your info and if i can put you on some spots in other sections of minnitaki just ask. don in minocqua,wi(scar)"
