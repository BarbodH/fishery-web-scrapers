547818,Guest,2005-05-11 22:05:00,0,Don't forget the deposit on your cans on top of the price of beer. I bought 2 cases of beer from the store that we flew out from to our outpost and with tax dep and price of beer it was $35.?? each. Glad I brought a 30 pack of Miller @12.99 from Missouri. But Don't get me wrong I loved the beer. And would do it again. Good Luck
547850,Guest,2005-05-12 15:25:00,0,"If you had a thirty pack, then that means you we bringing Miller High Life, the Champaign of beer, across the border. Did the border guards try to trade you two cases of Blue for the one 30 pack of High Life? Not an even trade...the High Life is far more valuable!!!"
547854,MoWalleyeguy,2005-05-12 15:42:00,409,"Just curious... do you guys have any room for other gear like rods/reels lures, etc when hauling all this beer up? Man... I go to fish and enjoy the outdoors."
547858,Guest,2005-05-12 18:14:00,0,What is the web site of the beer store in Fort Frances?
547864,phidelt157,2005-05-12 19:37:00,191,"What's it cost for a case of Blue at the Duty free store? I know last year we bought a few cases from the duty free store and paid duty on it when we crossed. Didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Is it cheaper to buy from duty free and pay duty on it, or just buy it in Canada?"
547868,Guest,2005-05-12 20:52:00,0,buy beer in canada. it will f*ck you up!

Doubt if they are popular with the ladies. I chewed big leaf and snuff for 15 years, gave it up. Do the same before it is too late."
547898,Hammerhead Herb,2005-05-13 10:14:00,259,I have a buddy of mine who's brother runs a liquor store. He buys his beer wholesale and that is the price that he declares (with receipts) at the border.
547932,Guest,2005-05-13 22:48:00,0,The LaBatt's we buy at the duty-free on the way to Canada has always been brewed in Canada.(Even the Bud-Light at the duty-free was brewed by LaBatt's). About $14 a case. Cans not bottles.
547758,Guest,2005-05-10 15:36:00,0,"The duty on a case of beer is about $6 to $7 dollars, depending on what you paid for it. If you buy 3 cases of beer to bring up, you get one free and pay about $14 for the other two cases. If you are paying $12 per case, your total beer cost is about $50. Buying Canadian beer is over $27 US per case. 3 cases up there is then $79. So, if cost matters, it is definately cheaper to bring your own beer and pay the duty. I guarantee it on experience. I always stop at the gas station with Duty Free shop right before the bridge, and buy a liter bottle of Crown Royal, and my friend will buy the liter of Grey Goose, so we can sip a little at night. You pay a much higher duty on the hard stuff, so claim the bottle as your free one, and pay duty on beer. If you want a true Blue, then splurge and buy a case up there."
547760,Lovetofish,2005-05-10 15:50:00,458,"It's $35.50 for a case of Blue in Fort Frances according to the beer store web site. That exchange rate = $28.69 US. I'm not sure what the duty charge is but I would guess if you bought your beer at Sam's Club or another discount store you would save money paying the duty. However, I'm on vacation, and you can't beat an ice cold canadian blue or molson. I'm like the earlier post. I bring in what I can and buy a couple cases up there. What is the duty on say a $14 US case of beer? Anybody?"
547761,Lovetofish,2005-05-10 16:00:00,458,"One more note, I also buy a case before I cross Back!"
547762,wooglin,2005-05-10 16:23:00,371,"We had three 1.75 litres of booze and three 90 packs of beer - two passengers. Thats how we got to $50. And, we finished it."
547765,Guest,2005-05-10 17:06:00,0,Yeah...and your beer drinkin' buddies spend their vacation trying to slip you into a straight jacket and making plans on how to leave you off next year's invitation list.
547766,Guest,2005-05-10 18:06:00,0,Wait! Please explain what you may bring to Canada from the US w/o paying duty? I thought I heard it was one case per person?
547770,rebelrn2001,2005-05-10 21:11:00,1563,One case of beer or 1 bottle (? 1 liter) of booze. The one guy said it was less costly if you claim the beer and pay on the booze. Also up to 7 oz of snuff. Not sure on cig's or cigar's.
547773,Guest,2005-05-11 06:13:00,0,"The duty on the hard stuff is more, so claim the bottle of whiskey or vodka, and pay duty on beer. Last year we paid about $6.25 per case and I said we bought it on sale for $12.00 per case. If you pay $14 per case, you will be at around $7.00 duty. There is a complicated formula based on how many total ounces of beer you have and how much you paid for each ounce which decides what your duty is. It was posted last year on this chatsite. You are allowed one case (24) beer ""OR"" one liter of liquor or some wine, but I have never sipped wine in Canada so I do not know how much wine you can bring over. Buy the liquor at the duty free shop and it is a huge savings. Plus you get a liter bottle which is a little bigger than the fifth you buy in america. You are allowed 50 cigars or one carton of cigarettes."
547796,woods,2005-05-11 13:01:00,646,"Reminds me of my younger days when I called the resort operator to get us 18 cases of beer. He said ""Oh, they are packed 24 to the case up here!"" So I said, ""just get us 17 then"""
547807,Guest,2005-05-11 18:59:00,0,"Hey Kernel Brownwater, ""RED MAN"" My little sister chews red man. Put a COPE in if you are a real man!!!!!"
547737,Guest,2005-05-10 10:13:00,0,We are coming through during the night so everything will be closed. Is it then better to bring the beer in and pay the fee or what??? Not sure what to do.
547738,phishfearme,2005-05-10 10:30:00,1242,"you can buy beer in the US, declare it at the crossing and pay the duty which is based on how much you paid for it in the US - it ends up costing about the same. keep receipts to avoid confusion. we do fly-ins and usually have our outfitter line up the beer for us. you're also allowed one case each duty free. - phish"
547740,Guest,2005-05-10 10:31:00,0,This has always been the most important decision we make every year. I say bring some in and buy some in Canada....just make sure you got enough to stay messed up the whole time.
547741,Guest,2005-05-10 10:36:00,0,"Where are you going? Get people at the lodge or someone wherever you are going to buy some beer and have it their for you when you arrive. Even if you know anyone anywhere along the way, they can purchase it and leave it somewhere for you to pick up in the middle of the night. Go to canada and bring in US beer? You would have to be crazy!"
547742,Guest,2005-05-10 11:00:00,0,We buy our beer after we get to Canada. mmmmm mmmm mmmmmmm.... goood beer in Canada!
547743,Guest,2005-05-10 11:02:00,0,Going to Canada and NOT drinking Canadian beer and smoking Cuban cigars is JUST NOT RIGHT. If it were me I'd park in the BEER store parking lot until they opened the next morning..you could probably use the rest anyway.
547745,Frankm,2005-05-10 11:13:00,154,Bring what your allowed and get the rest up there. We do like others said and call ahead to the lodge. They get it for us and even stick a case in their fridge for our arrival. Nothin like a Blue and a Cigar.
547746,Guest,2005-05-10 11:16:00,0,"For the past five years we have timed our itinerary to correspond with the opening of the beer outlets. The image of four reprobates rolling out ten or twelve cases (and no food, whatsoever) from a supermarket at 9am on a Saturday morning would have the Temperance Union call for reinsituting Prohibition. Cleaned 'em out of ""Bleu"" (it's Quebec) two years running. But hey, it's vacation...eh?"
547748,Guest,2005-05-10 12:01:00,0,"Beer, Beer, Beer you boys need to quit drinking that high school prom liquid and step up to a mans drink. Get yourself a case of Kentucky sippin whiskey and be a man. Rip off a chew of Red Man and wash it down with a tall glass of good old Jack Daniels. If you are going to go first class than really get messed up."
547755,wooglin,2005-05-10 15:14:00,371,"Dude, take the maximum with you, buy the rest in Canada, eh. Duty on what you bring will surely surpass the cost in Canada, eh. We did that last year, ended up paying nearly $50 at the border just to cross..."
