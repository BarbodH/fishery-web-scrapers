547791,ONE TIME DAVE,2005-05-11 11:33:00,110,This is number 10 with the same outfitter. That should tell you something. We have fished 4 different lakes with them. Did GREAT on all of them. Melchett has a lot of walleye and easy to catch. Also pike are very plentiful. The largest was over 19# with a lot over 10#. Six of us caught and released over 1600 pike and eyes at Melchett in 2004. We use nothing but artificial lures. Don't hesitate to e-mail me [email protected] if you want to discuss more. I love to talk fishing.
