558558,Guest,2006-06-18 15:22:00,0,I saw boats 3 different days down in Wine so I was curious how wabaskang was for fishing.
558615,rudy,2006-06-20 07:22:00,36,"wayne- thanks for the tips.steve and andrea are good freinds of ours.we went to school and grew up together. my brother and steve were best friends until his untimely death in 2001.it was steve's lifelong dream to own a resort and with lots of hard work they were able to buy tall pines 3 years ago.they are doing a great job and really are ""living the dream"". i am green with envy when they leave in the spring!we make a family trip out of it every year so we really have a good time with them while we're there.last year some other people in camp pounded the walleye in gawley's but we didn't figure it out until the last day.i'll be sure to check it out first chance on saturday!"
558647,Guest,2006-06-20 13:08:00,0,How was the fishing at Wine this year?
558701,Guest,2006-06-21 19:59:00,0,The fishing on wine was okay. It was tough to find the lakers. They are usually shallow when we are there but with the temps warm they were deeper. The northern bite was decent and so was the walleye bite. Like I said I saw a few boats down from wabaskang so it must have been slow up there. One thing to remember if you go down to wine is that the camp has special slots for fish on the lake system.
558703,Guest,2006-06-21 20:37:00,0,"Got back Saturday, here's a quick update for anyone going next this week or next as anyone know things change quickly on Canadian lakes, especially this one. The walleyes were caught basically anywhere you could find weeds, especially full, green, lush cabbage. Popular techniques involved simple jig w/minnow, jig w/twister, slip bobbers, or trolling spinners w/minnows along the weed edges. Find green weeds and you've got the first part of the equation figured out. The walleyes we caught were very nice, w/alot of 20"" plus fish caught. These fish that are in the weeds tend to be very aggressive and will not care alot about the color of jig or twister, just get it in there where they are at! The northern fishing once again garnered the majority of my attention and time. With 4 guys in my boat I found it easy to cover water by trolling. We would troll alot of my favorite spots and if we didn't hook up withing 10 to 15 minutes we'd move on, which is why anyone up there seen me flying all over and amassing a gas bill well over 250 dollars! But thats not so bad split 4 ways. The northern fishing was the best I've had for this early in June mostly because of 70 degree water temps and alot of emerging green weeds. I can't wait until next week to return as I think it will be alot better. We managed a 42"", 41"", 40 1/2"", and 4 38"" fish. It was fun and the weather was awesome. Good luck to anyone going next week, I think things are really going to take off even more as those weed walleyes begin to transition out of the weeds and onto the nearest reefs and flats where they will be easier for most people to fish with hanging up in weeds."
558706,Guest,2006-06-21 21:11:00,0,"My son and I went to Wabaskang for three years in a row before trying Lac Seul the last couple years where we will also be this year. The Walleyes were always abundunt in the 14' to 18' depth with jigs and crawlers. The biggest suprise that we found the second year was the size and abundunce of the perch after we found where they were hiding. Look for the biggest quite cove you can find with heavy weed cover. We would work our way about 50 feet into the weeds away from boat traffic. Look for small pockets of open water between the weeds. My son still talks about how much fun it was to catch one after another with just a small hook and sinker directly off the side of the boat. Our biggest perch was almost 14-1/2 inches. Good luck and have fun... Regards, Dave"
