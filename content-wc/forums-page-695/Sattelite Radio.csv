558648,Hump,2006-06-20 13:23:00,578,I have been running my sirrius at 88.1 fm. What do I do if I lose that signal? Is there an easier way than turning to all of the stations? I leave Friday for Lac Seul.
558651,Sutsgold,2006-06-20 14:19:00,219,"Not quite sure of your question, but you will have 88.1 everywhere except international falls."
558652,Hump,2006-06-20 14:26:00,578,"What do you turn it too then.My question was that, if I lose 88.1. I did that in Cedar Falls, Ia. and couldn't find another station. Thanks"
558656,Guest,2006-06-20 15:06:00,0,How to find a channel. Thanks

558577,Guest,2006-06-19 08:38:00,0,"Anyone use XM or Sirius Satellite radio in Canada? Will it work at about 50 Degrees north Latitude, 90 degrees west Longitude?"
558579,Sutsgold,2006-06-19 09:06:00,219,I have used both. My cottage is on eagle and it works clear as a bell. I have been as far north as lac seul and have had no problems.

558583,JDP,2006-06-19 10:11:00,1457,"I have Sirius, it works perfectly up to Red Lake and Sioux Lookout.:-)"
558585,Ketchenanny,2006-06-19 10:28:00,38,Used my Sirius with no problems at Pine Portage Lodge on Kabinakagami lake.
558586,Frankm,2006-06-19 10:40:00,154,We used ours in Ear Falls with no problem.
558592,haagy,2006-06-19 13:49:00,1,I took my Sirius boombox on a fly-in north of Savant lake. Reception was fine but I got only about 4 hours from 8 D batteries.
558593,Guest,2006-06-19 13:54:00,0,I had XM for 3 months as a free trial on my new truck when I bought it back in 2003. It worked fine as far up as Kenora. Never tried it further up than that. I canceled the subscription 2 months into the 3 month free trial because I didn't like it (music and listening choice is a very personal thing and I prefer to listen to CD's). But the reception was fine.
558594,Guest,2006-06-19 14:01:00,0,"My XM2Go Delphi worked great 50 miles north of Kenora. It has a built in antenna, and is about the size of an iPod and I had no problems. Chuck"
558646,Guest,2006-06-20 13:05:00,0,"better get one soon, the trip is less than 3 weeks away!"
