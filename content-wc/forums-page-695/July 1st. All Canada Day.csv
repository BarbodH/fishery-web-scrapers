We had planned on getting all veggies, liquor and bait in Canada but understand July 1st. is a Holiday in Canada. Is there a place open on this holiday to buy these supplies? We cannot wait until sunday the 2nd to get supplies because we fly out sunday at 6 am. Thank you for any info you might share."

We did find some smaller stores open in the smaller towns between Thunder Bay and Ignace and were able to pick the last of our staples. Bait shops were open as we had preordered our bait weeks ahead of time. We considered ourselves lucky and now pay more attention to the calander. Some conveinence stores in Thunder Bay are always open and you can pick up milk and eggs and maybe bread if in a pinch. The last few trips we have arrived in Thunder Bay late in the evening, and leave too early for the stores to be open, so we stop on the US side and pick up the rest of our food. Sometimes small fruit stands are also open. Good luck and call ahead. Pooch"
