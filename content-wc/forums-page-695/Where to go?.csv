Have been there 4 times in the last 8 years, just came back last week. It is a wide meandering river with loads of walleye and very large pike and smallmouth if you want. Look into the place. It is a 9.5 hour drive pulling a boat from Jersey. Fish are not over pressured and neither will you."

Good roads all the way, fishing is generally good. Walleye, Pike ,Muskie, Smallmouth & Largemouth bass. A ton of info on Mille Lacs will be available to you on this site! Oh, shi-, my bad, forgot I was in the Canada section!! Just ignore this post...........LOL Brian Hoffies"

As others have said its not a fabulous walleye lake,, panfish is excellent and bass can also be really good. Take a look at the French river close too where it enters lake nipissing. It generally has good walleye fishing,, pike is fantastic and there are monster muskies in the system."
558295,Buckfever1,2006-06-11 17:10:00,4,"I am from southwestern pennsylvania (Pittsburgh). In July of 2003 I went to Rice Lake, it was about a 7 hour drive. Fishing was terrible, probably because the time we spent there it was 90 degrees everyday. I have a boat I would like to bring, so a fly in isn't what I am looking for. I am planning on a trip next June sometime, so I figured it is never too early to start planning. Does anyone have any other suggestions on where to go? Is Rice Lake a good fishery for walleye? or Is there somewhere within a 8-10 hour drive near there that is better? Thanks...."

558576,Guest,2006-06-19 08:09:00,0,Just for reference... Rice lake is not a spectacular walleye lake. It is a great lake for pan fish however if walleyes are your target you would probably have better luck on just about any other lake. They do have walleyes in the lake and they are catch able however the population is very low. If you had all the conditions lined up perfectly my guess is that your group still would have had a hard time producing walleyes day in and day out. I don't want to discourage any one from going to Rice Lake I just wanted to help you understand why your walleye fishing left something to be desired. North Bound Best of luck to all fishing!
558606,Buckfever1,2006-06-19 20:42:00,4,"North Bound, Thanks for the reply. Anything near Rice lake that you suggest or any suggestions? Even if its a fly-in, I have put this on the back burner long enough. I need to start looking seriously for next June. Lac Seul would be great, but it is 23 hours away. I just dont have the time to spend 2 days driving. Thanks"
558610,Square1,2006-06-19 22:06:00,46,Myself I would suggest going the first weekend in May to the Bay of Quinte. Size does matter. The biggest fish anywhere.

558672,Guest,2006-06-20 22:42:00,0,"As far as a place to stay I can't help you buddy, I live in Toronto so Quinte is a day trip for me. There is a web site for the area, I think it's caled quintefishing.com (it is I just checked) where many of the outfitters advertise. I missed opener this year (first Saturday in May-the season opens earlier than anywhere else in Ontario) but a friend was out and he had a 20 plus fish day with some big fish coming in. It is far from remote with boats everywhere on the Saturday and Sunday but it gets alot quieter on the Monday morning already. If you can endure the endless trolling I can ALMOST gaurentee you'll top your personal best. Many people have. Not sure if you care or not but the ice fishing is a blast also. Take it easy Me"
