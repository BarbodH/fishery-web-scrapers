558366,Guest,2006-06-12 18:30:00,0,This is the Canadian way to handle the problem....We set up a bug tent and it works just fine. Bug proof your tent have a beer before bed and you sleep the night through. We keep a bucket in the tent so we don't have to go out after we close up.

Even very low concentrations of deet work very well. There are lotions that feel good on the skin and not stink like dog's breath."

558248,Guest,2006-06-09 17:14:00,0,Read on here a quite a while back about a certain type of vitamin that taken in large doses for a few weeks could slow down the buffet line on my head and ankles. Some help would be appriciated!! thanks in advance
558253,Trailerguy,2006-06-09 20:27:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Vitamin B1, some say it works for them, but it sure doesn't for most people. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
558259,north_alabama,2006-06-10 07:03:00,172,"Vitamin B1 is the one I've heard about too. One thing though, is that you are supposed to take it daily over an extended period of time (~ a couple months) for it to work. I tried it last year but only had a couple weeks before my trip. For me I didn't notice much effect, but I hadn't taken it as long as was recommended. Still had to rely on DEET/long clothing for portages."
558263,Guest,2006-06-10 09:16:00,0,Vitamins work great......you should take tons of them. The only things viatmins will do for skeeters is ad to the bottom line of the company that makes the vitmins.
558264,phidelt157,2006-06-10 10:31:00,191,"Seemed to work for me....took B1 14 days prior to the trip, then stayed with it while in the woods. Always worth a shot. BB"
558266,Guest,2006-06-10 11:31:00,0,Our Mosquitos appreciate the change in diet as well. Helps promote more and healthier offspring.
558273,Guest,2006-06-10 15:18:00,0,I thought lots of garlic is suppose to help. Ruins your love life tho.
558307,nitroman,2006-06-11 21:45:00,368,drink alot of beer get your blood alchol level way up the skeeters like a good buzz also......

558364,Guest,2006-06-12 18:20:00,0,Is this only for Mosquitos? If so I can't imagine it is worth it since the no-see-um and flies tend to be the ones that eat you alive.
