558716,Lovetofish,2006-06-22 10:46:00,458,Has anyone bought and used any preserved minnows from Cabela's. I've always salted my own. Just curious. Thanks.

If they don't we will purchase live minnows daily. I have used salt borax mix to preserve my own but was to busy with graduations and wedding to get it done this year. MWal
