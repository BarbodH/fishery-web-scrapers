558737,guidedfishing,2006-06-22 18:01:00,531,"just went throught last week, nothing major. You will not have any problems. good luck GF"
558288,Tyee Guy,2006-06-11 11:59:00,717,"Having lived here for 30 years, by all means take the 4th, or exit #59 and go east on the north crossing to the part of the Hwy 53 bypass that is open...You wil easily find this exit..If you want to get to Mike's, take the Clairemont Ave. exit from the NC south about a mile and you can see it on the right...There is a large Mega Foods on the right, and this would be the intersection you want... I noticed the other day, that it appears that the concrete for the remaining bypass is almost complete so it looks like they will meet the August deadline or even open sooner....Can't wait, as it will save us south siders a big chunk of time to head north as well..... Let North Bound or I know if you need any further directions, I'm sure we can help you out......If you send me a private e-mail here, I can give you a couple of phone #s in case you need help...."
558296,north_alabama,2006-06-11 17:43:00,172,"Thanks, I think I'm getting it. Just to be sure...I stay on 94 and go past the existing Hwy 53 exit to exit 59 (I'll be pretty well west of 53 by this time). This is called the North Crossing. I go east, past the existing Hwy 53, to the new Hwy 53 and go north? Does that sound right?"
558300,Guest,2006-06-11 20:24:00,0,"If I remember correctly, the ""old"" Hwy 53 exit was #70, which would mean you would go 11 miles farther west to reach the #59 exit and then take the North Crossing to the ""new"" Hwy 53. Does that make sense Tyee Guy? How much time does it save? Thanks for the updates.:-)"
558309,Tyee Guy,2006-06-11 22:13:00,717,"You are both correct..As far as saving time, it is really a wash, but you do miss alot of the congestion of Hastings Way (old 53) especially if you are pulling a boat....Easier to get to gas, lodging and fast food in and out....."

558704,Guest,2006-06-21 20:54:00,0,"As long as we're on the topic, how about those of us coming from the east on Hwy 29? Do we still have to go through town (Chippewa Falls)and cross the reservoir behind the dam?"
558710,bugsy,2006-06-22 06:06:00,49,Nope...29 West to 53 North...4-lane all the way.
558221,wiggle,2006-06-09 07:21:00,400,"I was going to make that suggestion to people traveling north on I94 thru Eau Claire. If they would take the 4th exit, that is the ""north crossing"" they can take that straight to the Hwy 53 bypass. It is a couple more miles, but then they don't have to go thru the narrow 3 lanes of traffic in the city of Eau Claire. Mikes Smokehouse is worth trying, but.....if your like me, and your headin' nort', you just want a burger and keep on trucking. Be safe, Brad"
558222,Brax,2006-06-09 08:09:00,52,"Wiggle, Mike's is the type of place that you order at the counter, they give you a number, you sit down, then they bring you your food at your table. They are very fast and the whole meal would only take about 15 minutes more than eating in at Mcd's. Once you've eaten there, you won't ever think of eating at McD's or BK again. Trust me on this one. My favorite is the is the rack of rib plate. About a 6"" rack of ribs, two sides of beans and Texas toast, all for $8."
558232,clemento,2006-06-09 10:48:00,48,Does anybody know the exit # of that 4th exit or know the name of the street you would be exiting on? Also do you go past 53 to get to the bypass and how is the bypass marked?
558238,Guest,2006-06-09 11:18:00,0,"I am from Eau Claire and I would definatly recomend using the new Hwy 53 for all people looking to travel up north. Even though the new 53 has not been completely finished yet a good portion has been and will shorten your drive time around Eau Claire by about 15 min or so. Depending on what direction you are coming from the bypass talked about by others may shorten your trip even more. If anyone needs specifics concerning the ins and outs of Eau Claire just let me know. Cheers, P.S. MIkes Smoke House really does have good food!!! one of my favorites. good luck fishing"
558239,Tyee Guy,2006-06-09 11:48:00,717,That would be exit 59.....It puts you on the far west side of EC....
558247,Guest,2006-06-09 16:51:00,0,thanks again guys. i've been thinking about doing this for years and yahoo used to suggest this (msp) route. my son and i met at the msp airport about 5 years ago and i do not remember having any problems getting out of there in the rental car. i do remember that you can really fly north of msp. i'll try the northern crossing this year.
558249,Guest,2006-06-09 17:15:00,0,"The rack of ribs is good. But my alltime favorite, the country style ribs, baked potato(huge), baked beans, texas toast. You'll leave with a huge smile. Don't go at the prime eating hour though because the line can be out the door. Its definitely shorter to take that 4th exit and not that 1st exit that runs along the malls and hastings way. This really sucks but its still better than coming to MN and taking I-35 to Duluth. We're all lucky that North Crossing is there because it used to be that you had to drive through town every time you needed to get to the north side of town. They have really made strides even though its taken way too many years."
558260,north_alabama,2006-06-10 07:34:00,172,"Hi North Bound, I'd like to take you up on you offer. I'll be coming up through Eau Claire from 94 out of Madison headed to Duluth and beyond in about two weeks. There have been a number of threads about this bypass and I've ended up confused. What are the routes up and back that will allow me to make the most efficient use of the partially-completed bypass? Last year on the way up we went through the old ""slow"" way, but on the way back I think we managed to get on a section of the bypass completely by accident. We'll be passing through during mid morning, so stopping for food isn't a restriction for us. It sounds like the ""fourth Eau Claire exit"" off 94 is the way to go? if that is correct, do you know what the exit signs say for that exit? What should we look for on the way back? Thanks!"
558275,clemento,2006-06-10 18:37:00,48,Does anybody know where I could find a map of this on the internet. I have looked but not having any luck finding a map showing the new bypass.
558281,Guest,2006-06-11 08:18:00,0,i doubt that they will update maps until the new road is officially open.
558178,Guest,2006-06-08 08:06:00,0,Anyone know when the bypass around Eua Claire will be completed to connect with the interstate
558179,Tom502,2006-06-08 08:19:00,118,Check this Threadhttps://www.walleyecentral.com/dc/dcb...ng_type=search
558191,Guest,2006-06-08 12:48:00,0,Just came thru 2 days ago and its not open yet. Looks nearly complete buy you still have to go 1/2 way through town and cut over to it. Should be nice when done.
558194,Brax,2006-06-08 13:20:00,52,"If your going through Eau Claire, there is a great place to stop for lunch. It's called Mike's Smoke House. It has some of the best ribs I have ever had, and the baked beans are fantastic. It's on 12 half way between 53 and the north crossing. Once you leave Mike's all you need to do is drive north on 12 until you get to the North Crossing and take that to the bypass."
558196,Tyee Guy,2006-06-08 14:21:00,717,"The entire bypass is scheduled to be open in August, however with the cooperative weather we have had they are ahead of schedule. In regards to Mike's...You are right ...best ribs on the planet!!!!!!!"
558197,Guest,2006-06-08 15:02:00,0,"i come up from central illinois. thinking of running over to minn-st paul and up this year. any of you guys take this route to avoid eau claire and duluth, the 2 major bottlenecks on the drive to ifalls?"
558198,Tyee Guy,2006-06-08 15:08:00,717,"You will not save any time or frustration by going to I-35 in Minnesota and up to Duluth....The extra time as well as the MSP bottleneck can be very taxing on your nerves....There is also some major construction happening near the Menonomie area that requires detouring and adds an extra 45-60 minutes to my drives to the twin cities.......My advise, deal with it, stop at Mike's for some ribs and enjoy the trip...."
558199,Guest,2006-06-08 15:13:00,0,thanks for the heads up
558200,Guest,2006-06-08 15:21:00,0,If you think Eau Claire and Duluth are bottlenecks MN/St Paul are the stoppers. By the time you get through St.Paul you would be almost to Duluth. Then you still have to drive up I35 to Duluth. I would reconsider.
558205,Guest,2006-06-08 17:16:00,0,"hi fellas, I grew up in eau claire and dined at Mikes my whole life and then people told me Famous Daves was better. What a joke!!! Mikes is a great place to stop and eat. I also fish Lac Seul 2-3 times a year now for the past 4 years but live in the MSP/STP metro area. I can tell you that coming to the Twin Cities would be a mistake. If you are coming from the south on I-94 take the 4th Eau Claire exit (there is a McDonalds, BurgerKIng/gas station, Subway, right on this exit). This takes you right to the ""North Crossing"" and on to 53 and you hardly missed a beat and didn't have to crawl through town. hope this helps"
