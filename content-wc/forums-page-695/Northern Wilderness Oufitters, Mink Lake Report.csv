558664,Guest,2006-06-20 17:42:00,0,"Just returned from a trip to Mink Lake with Northern Wilderness Outfitters. First trip with this outfitter and I have nothing bad to say about this operation, nice cabins great helpful staff, very nice lake. I will use this outfitter again. Mink Lake was full of 1 ½ to 2lb walleye, and a ton of 25  27 inch pike. The fish were hitting on anything flashy color did not seem to matter. We caught fish by trolling cranks, worm harnesses, jigging, spinners, spoons, and even under a bobber. Had a great week. I would like to thank everyone on this board for all the great info; I have been reading this forum about 5 times a day for the last two months getting prepared for the trip."
