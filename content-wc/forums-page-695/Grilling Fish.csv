Wanted to let you know that I used your recipe as a change of pace to our usual fried fish. I was a hit, the boys loved it so much I had requests to make it again, and I did. It really wasn't as hard as it sounds and is quite tasty. Walleye Central rules, thanks for the great suggestions. Larry"
558633,Guest,2006-06-20 10:05:00,0,"I found this recipe on the WC board about a month ago. Take an aluminum baking bag. Cut oinions about 1/2 inch thick. Lay walleye fillets on top. Slice tomatos and lay on top of fish. Layer asparagus on top of that. A cup or so of mushrooms. A cup of parmaesaen cheese with a couple pats of butter. Fold edges over and place on grill for 20 minutes. What is great about this recipe is it is quick, easy to make, and cleanup. You can substitute almost any vegetable to your own choice. I added zuchinni and that was excellent."
558644,Guest,2006-06-20 12:36:00,0,"WE do the same with foil and veggies, but in place of butter we use white wine, or some oill base salad dressing"
558654,Jig A Lowe,2006-06-20 14:55:00,87,"I do fish on a gas/BBQ grill all of the time. You should buy a special grill for fish and vegetables. They have a non-stick surface and small, circular holes to prevent losing your fish thru the grates when turning. Pre-heat your grill with the fish grate on the grill. Spray the fish grate with Pam. I usually just coat the fish in a little butter and lemon juice and season with garlic salt and pepper. But, I wouldn't suggest using aluminum foil or a baking sheet of any kind. That is not grilling, that is frying. And, you won't get a nice grill flavor. That is why grill are made with grates and not solid surfaces. You may as well do your fish on the stove in a fry pan or in the oven if you use aluminum foil. That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it."
558686,shaky legs 2,2006-06-21 12:48:00,15,You may be right about the aluminum pan but I disagree about it not being a good alternative. You do not have to heat up the oven in an already warm cabin and you do not have to fry on a stove.
557921,kbkakes,2006-05-31 20:37:00,49,Greetings to all. Eight days and counting to our yearly Ontario Fly-in. I have a question for all who care to offer some advise. The outpost cabins we have been to in the past all had outdoor fish cookers. This years does not. Does anyone have experience cooking fish on the grill would like to try but have never done it. Do you use batter? tin foil on the grate etc.? How bout some ideas. Maybe some recipes Thanks...Kevin
557925,Pat T,2006-05-31 21:28:00,221,"This recipe is a lot of work, but I usually get very good compliments. I call them fish packets. You have all done this with vegetables, but just add Walleye and you have a meal. Take a piece of heavy duty aluminum foil. Fold in two, but leave open and place an assortment of french fry cut potatoes, carrots, onions and peppers on one side of the fold of foil creating a bed. Dip two fillets in oil (I usually split the fillets length wise removing the Y bones) and sprinkle both sides with your favorite type of cajun seasoning. Place on the bed of veggies. Then repeat the same assortment of veggies on top of the fillets. Finish by putting about 4 cubes of butter on top. Fold over the aluminum and roll up the sides making sure to have a tight seal. You don't want that butter to leak out. Place the packet(s) on the grill top side down for 10 minutes. Then carefully flip and cook for another 15. Puncture a few holes in the top of the foil to let some of the steam escape. This way the packet won't balloon up on you. Enjoy! Pat T"
557926,Pat T,2006-05-31 21:37:00,221,"Try this for tasters. Ever had bacon wrapped scallops? Try it with walleye. Using the thickest part of the fish, cube some fish into about a size of 1"" x 2"" or so. Sprinkle with your favorite spice, wrap with bacon and put on schewers. I usually cut the bacon strips in half and make sure that the size of my fish cubes match with that size of bacon. These will flame up, so make sure you don't walk away from the grill. Cook until bacon is crispy. Pat T"
557927,EJ,2006-05-31 21:54:00,619,"kbkakes, I grill walleye all the time. An easy recipe is as follows: Oil fillets with melted butter or olive oil. Season with salt, pepper, dill and lemon. Place fillets on foil. Put raw onion rings and thin tomato slices on fillets. Drizzle with oil or butter and grill for about 10 minutes. No mess and perfect everytime. EJ"
557928,phaffy12,2006-05-31 22:36:00,9,"For grilling fillets, you can throw them on foil on the grill. However, I prefer to leave the skin on when I'm cleaning the fish. That way you don't have to mess with the foil, just throw the fillets skin side down on the grate."
557931,Guest,2006-06-01 06:12:00,0,"This is a quick, simple and tasty way to grill walleyes on either over a fire pit with a grate or on a grill. Take an aluminum bake pan and spray it with no-stick spray. Place fillets in the pan (don't layer them) and cover them with onion slices. Coat the fillets and onion slices with mayonaise and then sprinkle parmesan cheese on top. Lastly, season with dill weed. Cover the bake pan with aluminum and cook on the grill for 20-25 minutes depending upon the thickness of the fillets."
557938,Guest,2006-06-01 09:20:00,0,"Aluminum baking pan, bread crumbs, spices or shore lunch, mozza cheese. Pour olive in heated pan, put breaded fish in pan, once brown flip and add mozza as topper... Yummy walleye melt... Add bean... a little bread.... you'll stay warm all nite... Makes great mozza Walls sandwiches...toast your bread..mmmmmmm That's it I'm going fishing tonight..."
557948,Guest,2006-06-01 12:52:00,0,"Our main cook has a recipe very similar to EJ's. Mighty tasty, especially when you've had your fill of deep fried/pan fried. We eat a lot of fish on our trips, so trying different ways to cook fish has been something we've been experimenting with. To give our cook a night off, I've done the stuffed walleye. Can be done on grate over fire or grill. I generally bread fillets, place 2 on lightly greased tin foil. Cover generously with stuffing (stove top, previously have added water and mixed up, but not cooked). 2 more fillets on top. Wrap entirely with tin foil (greased). I double wrap. Place on grill or over fire. I flip a lot so it doesn't burn. It takes awhile to cook, up to 40 minutes. It will stay very warm in the pouch if you need to cook something else. Prep time is quick, little clean up. A good ""different"" way to enjoy your fish. It'll take a good man to polish off a packet."
557959,Guest,2006-06-01 15:03:00,0,Hey you don't need my input lots of good ways to go already listed. I do as the others have listed. Just make something up!
557960,Guest,2006-06-01 15:07:00,0,"Just watched a local TV station with a Mr. Food segment on Grilling gadjets. One item was a wipe that you use with your wire barbecue brush to clean before and after grilling. Another was a fish basket with removable handles. This allows you to close lid of grill without the handles inside. I assume you put the handles on after cooking. Finally, I recall a sheet of aluminum with small holes designed to keep things from falling through the grate. They are intended to be used 2 or 3 times and disposed of-comes in packets of 10 or 12."
