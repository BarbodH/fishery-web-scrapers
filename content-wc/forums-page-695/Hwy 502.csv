558723,timb,2006-06-22 15:36:00,2,I'm headed to Sioux Lookout area in July. What is the condition of Hwy 502? Is the road completed or still under construction? Thank you.
558734,Sutsgold,2006-06-22 17:26:00,219,"Drove it about a month ago. Was in great shape except for a small stretch of road about 60 miles into it. You will need to slow down just a bit (45mph) if your are trailering, and it lasts for only about 4 or 5 miles, but really no worries. Good luck in sioux"

558756,Skylane,2006-06-23 08:34:00,101,I have been through there 3 times this year (the last being Sunday morning) and there is no difference from last year. The same 20 miles or so stretch of road still has the bumps. Just be thankful it is not all gravel and remember the sweet spot at the end as you are heading North.
