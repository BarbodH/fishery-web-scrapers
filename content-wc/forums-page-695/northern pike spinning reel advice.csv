558524,north_alabama,2006-06-17 06:31:00,172,"Have they changed the Sahara model in the last 6 years? I've got one I bought in '99 or so that's been one of my mainstays, Never a bit of trouble. But it is a 2000 size, so it isn't my first choice for pike. For my heavier spinning setup I'm using a Cabelas Guide Series (I think - got it as part of a combo) sized for 20 lb line. I've got it spooled with 30 lb PowerPro, and typically use either wire or Fluorocarbon leaders depending on the situation (I use it for as a backup for Lake trout too). Took it to Canada last year and it held up fine. I just gave my last Mitchell 300 to my dad. Used them almost exclusively for years as a kid. Over time I came to prefer a higher gear ratio."
558660,Guest,2006-06-20 16:23:00,0,"Fireline and superlines work great...for the fisherman. But, the thin diameter is #### on the pike...especially when they roll up in it. It cuts through their skin leaves large gashes in the fish making them vulnerable to infection. I won't use a superline on pike again. I would recommend a heavy (20lb) mono line to be kinder to the fish you release. NWA-"
558708,FISHNBOWLJOE,2006-06-22 00:29:00,80,I use Quantum Catalyst PTs for all my fishing. I use a PTi 30 for bass and northern. I would suggest the Catalyst PTi 30 or 40. Good Fishing! Joe
558340,ksboy2,2006-06-12 10:05:00,38,looking into buying a spinning reel to use for pike fishing on my canada trip. i will be pulling spinnerbaits/spoons/crankbaits with a 7' rod......any advie on reels to look at. i am planning to spoon with 17 lb. test braided green line. thanks kirk
558343,bronzeback77,2006-06-12 11:37:00,97,"I would go with a Shimano Stradic 4000FH, they run around $140. If that is too much than I would go with a Shimano Spirex $60 or Sahara $60 4000FH. I have several of each and they all great reels, I would not own a reel that doesn't say Shimano on the side."

GOOD LUCK."
558350,Guest,2006-06-12 12:14:00,0,"I have to second the Shimano opinion. I reverse the handles so I can reel with my left hand, cast with my right hand. This can be kind of tough to learn but the results are worth it. I've found that holding the rod in my right hand during a strike has improved my hooking up percentage quite a bit. Of course with Northerns they will sometimes darn near take the whole rig outa your hand. Good luck,"
558355,Guest,2006-06-12 13:50:00,0,"i have a stradic, spirex and a quantum catalyst all 4000s. all are nice. i remember the first time i went to canada with my cheaper 2000s. one little cheapy shimano and an abu cardinal. by the end of the week, both sounded like a thrashing machine."
558371,idapaul,2006-06-12 19:25:00,82,try a pflueger trion or president. i use them both for musky and northern
558400,Guest,2006-06-13 11:37:00,0,I use Mitchell 300 's and powerpro #30
558432,Guest,2006-06-14 07:46:00,0,"Pick up an Okuma Epix, I believe, and just try it. Pretty smooth and you can get some good deals on them."
558466,Guest,2006-06-15 06:48:00,0,"shimano stradic. personally i had awful luck with okuma epixor, i had two and returned them both. the stradic has been unbeatable, used it now for 3 seasons."
558490,Hawker,2006-06-15 16:32:00,3967,"I too use the Mitchell 300's and have had not a whit of a problem with the reels in the past 10 years of fishing for pike with them in Canada. I use 7' med hvy lightning rods, 14# Fireline and quality leaders and have yet to have any problems. Have had several really good muskies on the same outfits while fishing for pike (all released in good shape and unharmed, biggest was a 53"") and also had no problems with the rods, reels or line!"
