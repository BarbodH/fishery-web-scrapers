How much bait should we plan on for a group of four, full four days fishing, mostly walleye. I was thinking ten doz minnows and four lbs of leeches. maybe throw in ten doz nightcrawlers. Or is this to much? I don't think minnows will live too long and i don't know if leeches will be avalible then."
558602,Guest,2006-06-19 17:09:00,0,"Leeches are a great option for your son they are dourable and can withstand a few missed hooksets, but they may be hard to come by. I would personally just buy a flat of crawlers(50 doz) might loose a few more but then you only have to babysit one type of bait. From what I've read on here they all work equally well. And if you start to run low you can go to plastics with half a crawler."
558611,Pooch,2006-06-19 22:32:00,4619,"Four pounds of leeches is too much. We figure 1/2# of mixed leeches per man per seven day trip and usually run out the last day of the trip. Minnows are usually not worth the hassle on a flyin. Later in the summer leeches will normally out produce minnows anyway. We use more leeches than crawlers and feel that later in the summer it is usually a leech or crawler bite. If I could only take one bait, it would be leeches. Crawlers are a close second choice. We always take both on a fly-in. Sometimes they want crawlers and sometimes they want leeches. Sometimes they want cranks and sometimes they don't want anything you have in your tackle box period. Leeches are the easiest to keep alive. Unless you have room in the fridge a few days of hot weather (and it does get hot in Canada in August!) will decimate your crawler supply. Pooch"
558616,IaDave,2006-06-20 07:40:00,476,When we first starting doing fly-ins we always took way too much live bait. Now all we take is about 12 doz frozen and salted minnows and some gulp plastic baits.
558657,Guest,2006-06-20 15:57:00,0,"I agree with the other guys on taking leeches if available. However, the amount depends on the action. I go with 5 other guys and fish for five and a half days. We start with 6lbs and always end up having another pound or two brought out to us. Last year we used up 9lbs. Were fishing from a houseboat on LOTW so we have the luxury of calling in for more bait. You may not be too far off with the 4lbs."

I can tell you from experience that a flat of worms packed in bedding is all you'll need. Minnows are great to have spring and fall up there, but in summer worms rule. If you feel the need to use minnows bring a couple of minnow traps with you and trap your own while there. Beaver dams are always a good place to set traps as well as brushy, shallow inflowing creeks. I just came back from Nakina last week and we managed to collect over 5-6 dozen minnows each morning before fishing no problem."
558661,Guest,2006-06-20 16:25:00,0,"Tripper, I'm sure the MNR would love to know where you fish and more importantly trap minnows as it is illegal for non-residents to trap minnows."
558663,Tripper,2006-06-20 17:07:00,9,I'm a resident of Ontario. You're quite right about the non-resident regs regarding trapping minnows (I forgot).
