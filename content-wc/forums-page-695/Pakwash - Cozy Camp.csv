558675,Guest,2006-06-21 09:11:00,0,STAYED AT COZY TWO YEARS AGO IN LATE JUNE HAD A GOOD TIME. FISHING WAS SLOW THAT WEEK HOWEVER TALKED TO SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT WENT THERE EVERY YEAR AND THEY SAID FISHING WAS USUALLY GREAT. CABINS WERE OK PEOPLE WERE FRIENDLY. CAUGHT A LOT OF WALLEYE ON THE PORTAGE BY THE FALLS AND CAUGHT QUITE A FEW BELOW THE FALLS PULLING SPINNERS. BOATS WERE VERY NICE. VERY INEXPENSIVE.
