I will be leaving for Rainy Lake, specifically Northwest Bay on June 28th. Can anyone help me out as to patterns that have been succesful for them on this waterbody. Presentations and baits. Also what can be expected as far as location of Walleye's. Will they be relating to humps sadles or open water flats. I know this sounds like I am asking alot, but I do know this waterbody has more to offer than I have been capeable of producing in the past. I am not restricted to fishing Northwest Bay as I have a rig very capeable of fishing a large portion of the lake. So any advice is welcome. Thanks in advance, Chris"
