I never made my late trip and have been watching on this board to see if anyone has posted and it doesn't appear to have had any activity. Any success at all? I had some good success in the Red River when I was up and just curious to know what to expect for next year. Hopefully the water system will rise for next year!"

I did hear of some size but the fish that we caught were 17-22 in range and very chunky. The last day we went out was about a week ago. The river is completely frozen now so maybe we will get some ice fishing in soon. As for the year in Pine Falls it was a complete dissapiontment fishing, wind, temps, I can go on and on oh well, maybe next year I guess. We are supposed to get a big dump of snow today so.... Bring on snowmobile season.... can't wait to fire up an auger and check out some northern lakes. Have a great holiday season and hope to see you all next year. Laurent"

I'll be back next year, you can count on it. We need a good snow cover but after we get some really good ice. I may give you a call to see what ice fishing opportunities may offer. I have a couple portable houses and an ATV... Thanks Hawgeye"

Snowmobile's are cruising around....wont be long now before we can test the ice. I'm thinking that the greenbacks were going good right at the end maybe its still going. There is usually a little village behind he lumber yard with shacks and trucks, I will keep you posted. Laurent"
