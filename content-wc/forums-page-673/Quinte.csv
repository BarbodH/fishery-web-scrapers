562119,Guest,2006-11-27 21:52:00,0,"Quinte is on fire. I took my dad this weekend for two days of sticking monsters and we did. Saturday we broke the 30"" mark twice and Sunday we broke 30"" seven or eight times times. We did get one totally deformed fish just over 27"" and weighing 11pounds 14 ounces! The big dogs are rolling in now and it's only going to get better. Nice eaters are few and far between though so if you're out for a meat hunt it's out of the question. Keep the cameras handy."

561898,Superdad,2006-11-05 21:04:00,64,"The fishing has been sporatic, some doing REAL well and others not doing anything. A couple of walleye pros were fishing last week and had double and triple headers with 12 lb fish. There were right on the spot. We fished the same day about four miles from them and got skunked. The Big mama's are getting close and it's the time of the year - hopefully we'll get some of the action. Stay Tuned or go to www.quintefishing.com (discussion board) David Delcloo aka Superdad"
