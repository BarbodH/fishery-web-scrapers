561757,DaveD,2006-10-28 18:04:00,57,The Sask. government has lowered the PST from 7% to 5%. Our sales tax now totals 11% (6% GST + 5% PST). So if anyone is coming to Saskatchewan to fish this will save a few bucks. Dave D

561968,uzzi,2006-11-15 14:27:00,349,"Hi there, I'm assuming you are from the US? Yes, Tobin is one of the province's best fisheries. Great place to fish all year, with many trophy walleye and pike caught annually. It is a large body of water, essentially there is the river secion from the Francois Finlay dam to just past Eagles nest, and past that is the ""lake"" where the river widens out. Walleye fishing is pretty decent in the river section for most of the time between May-Oct, July usually cools off a bit, but thats pretty normal allover. And the big pike really start feeding out in the flats in lae fall, Sept-Oct, along with the big walleye, they start making their way back into the river section. Yes, a non-cdn 3 day license is $40 CDN, and an annual non-cdn license is $80, not sure what to say about that, thats just the way it is......but I also suspect that is a very small part of your total trip cost if you are making your way up here from the USA. Once you're here, I'm sure you'll agree Tobin is a great place to fish, nice scenery and great fishing."

561991,uzzi,2006-11-17 14:36:00,349,"Heres a few more for you to check out. I've stayed at MacSwayneys, its nice, right in the Regional Park entrance. Scot's Landing is just right across the river, never been over there, but looks nice too. And Twin marine is right were you launch the boat in the Reg Park, but think they will put you up in a hotel right in Nipawin, and then guide you if thats what you're looking for. Another one is Pruden's Point resort, but it looks like their website has been shut down?? But heres a few to check out anyways.http://www.scotslanding.com/http://www.sasktelwebsite.net/tmarine/index.htmlhttp://www.macswaneyscabins.com/http://www.silvertipoutfitting.com/http://www.nipawin.com/fishing.php The last link is to the town of nipawin website thats got lots of good info about fishing in and around tobin, lake maps, etc"
