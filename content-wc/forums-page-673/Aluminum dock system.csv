562019,Sutsgold,2006-11-22 09:06:00,219,Does anyone have an aluminum dock system they can recommend. Im looking for a dock for a shallow sandy shoreline in front of the cottage. It must be easily entered and removed for the season. A roller dock is not an option. Canadian dealer would be nice as the cottage is on eagle. Thanks

He is the builder, so no middleman to pay. Told me I could haul it up to Canada on a snow machine trailer. They will build it to suit your needs. They are on my wish list. Hope this helps."
562026,Guest,2006-11-23 05:56:00,0,sorry to cut in but I am looking to build a dock and I sent them an email after looking at their site. I can let you know what they tell me if it would help. Good luck

562108,Box,2006-11-27 13:08:00,3219,"Sutsgold, I too have a steep hill at shorline, and I use an old ""Hewitt"" steel roller dock. It 32' long, all one piece. Hewitt still makes this steel dock, but also makes alum versions. Many dock makes have same/similar styles. I use my truck at the top of the hill, and a 12v winch (drops over my hitch ball) to just winch it up the hill and then cable it to a tree (although a block under wheel works as well, and I do both). In spring, just use the reverse on the winch, and it slides right back in very easy. I will get alum some day, just to make it even easier. I have little wheels on the ""front"" which helps, but next year I will put bigger sized dock wheels on front (shore side) to help it roll up easier. Don't be afraid to try roll in dock with a steep hill, as it is about the best way in my eyes to do it. Good luck! I think I have pictures of my dock and hill if you are interested. Let me know and I can post a couple to the photo section. -Box"
562143,Guest,2006-11-29 11:26:00,0,"sutsgold, price per foot for the truss dock 4'wide was about $50 per foot. Call and talk to them. I just got off the phone with Bernie and I am 99% sure they have what I'm looking for. I too have a hill...from the top of hill to water level is probably a 10' drop(at approx 45 degree grade)."
