IF YOU ARE A PIKE GUY....THIS IS NOT THE LAKE FOR YOU. WALLEYE FISHING IS ABOVE AVERAGE SMALLIES ARE ABUNDANT TOO. SOME NICE MUSKIE ROAM THOSE WATERS TOO....GOOD LUCK WITH THOSE BIG GIRLS... THAT LAKE HAS A 54"" LIMIT! IF YOU HAVE KIDS AND WANT SOME GOOD ""ACTION"" TAKE A BOAT RIDE TO ST. CLAIRE ...IT IS EAST OF SPADINA LAKE AND A LONG TRIP BY BOAT DOWN A CHANNEL, BUT WHEN WE GOT BACK THERE IT WAS AWESOME.... NOT HUGE PIKE, (36"" BIGGEST ) BUT A LOT OF EATERS...AND SOME WALLEYE TOO.... THROW WEEDLESS SPOONS !"
