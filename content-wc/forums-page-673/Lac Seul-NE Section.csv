You need to go past Chamberlain, then head west after a bit (you need a real map, or you can follow the many many boats going there) Wapesi is fantastic in spring and gives up some real sows, but alot of pressure. Lots of houseboat groups too. Andersons have an outpost north of Chamberalin which is a bit closer to Wapesi. Also closer to muskie. Just south of that site is good eye & slimer action."

561720,Guest,2006-10-24 16:01:00,0,"Only one camp up there. Ojibway Outfitters/Lac Seul Outposts. Good fishing ,Pricey, Average Customer Servicewww.lacseuloutposts.com Lots of great fishing on Lac Seul. Check out some other places before you book."
561725,Guest,2006-10-24 20:05:00,0,"Great fishing, to say the service is average would be a pretty huge overstatement. Good fishing all over the lake, but muskie are only in that region"
561730,Guest,2006-10-25 09:34:00,0,"WALLIBUSTER, Been there done that. If I were you I would check out other Resorts on LS. There are plenty of great places to fish and stay and they all will do a better job of customer service than the one Resort in the NE Section of LS."

Anderson's is very clean and is very fisherman-friendly. It has good service, facilities and food. I also think that area of the lake is the best walleye fishing (especially in the spring). You are about a 20 minute ride away from Wapesi Bay, which produces big fish."
562003,Guest,2006-11-18 18:32:00,0,Where is Wapesi Bay in relation to Anderson's LS launch. I have been at Anderson's 4 years in a row and have not heard of this location. We usually fish the Bear Narrows/Japan Bay area which is about an hour boat ride from the Anderson's launch. We are looking for other good spring locations.
562023,Guest,2006-11-22 19:27:00,0,"I totally agree regarding the comment about poor customer service at Ojibway/Lac Seul Outpost. I stayed there 2 times and likely will never go back. However, the walleye fishing is outstanding right off their dock. I have found the fishing as good fishing out of Mahkwa Lodge and the accomodations are much, much better. Face it the fishing is great on Lac Seul almost anywhere once you get to know the area."
