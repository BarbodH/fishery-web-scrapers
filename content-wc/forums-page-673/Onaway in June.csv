Now that we have some of the variables covered. Bring jigs of different colors, spinner rigs (dozens) if you want to backtroll, plastics, nightcrawlers, minnows are provided by the camp, or invest in leeches. I want to give you some good advise, but the problem is, there is not and will not be any one good answer. If it is your first time, get a guide for at least 1-2 days. Onaway is situated on a part of the lake that can give you many different opportunities, Not the least of which is the opportunity to get lost. It's a great Lake, with lots of fishy spots, but getting turned around is very easy to do, even with a GPS. We guided a group back to camp last June and they had a really nice GPS, but after going around islands, points, and into strange bays all that GPS did was tell them they were lost. Plus, Blair's guides are very good, they will show you what to do and put you on fish. Plus cook the best shore lunch on earth. Give me a shout at [email protected] I have been going to Onaway for 8 years and can clue you into some of my favorite spots. Good Luck steve"

Go to Four Seasons Bait shop in downtown Ear Falls (about 15 minutes from Onaway) and buy your spinner rigs and bead chain style sinkers (1/4 ounce to 1/2 ounce) from there. He has an incredible selection and they cost about 90 cents US each. Ask for the most popular types and colors. Buy 6 of each and see what they are hitting on day 1 and then buy mor of those. Also bring Shad Raps. Have fun on the ride to the end of Mckenzie bay or Broad lake. I have a forty pound tackle bag, but caught 95 percent of my walleyes last year with a 1/4 jig and Gulp 3"" minnowgrub with a piece of crawler. For pike, bring bass style spinners in bright colors like white and chartreuse, any bright spoon, and I like trolling outside weeds with the 7"" Original Rapala and get nice pike and weed walleyes. Try doing circles around Scout Lake in the evening or mornings with the Rapala's right at the weed edges."

They give you more than enough minnows daily, for jigging/bottom bouncing. We spend most of our time trolling Clown Color Husky Jerks..the walleyes love them. It is true what they say about Lac Seul, you can catch plenty of fish on just about all presentations. If I can help furthe you can e-mail me at [email protected]."
