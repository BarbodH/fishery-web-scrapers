562146,Trailerguy,2006-11-29 18:00:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]We'll have to agree to disagree, I could put you in a small remote lake that has been unharvested, it currently has a population of 24""+ fish, you can fish it all week and there are no small ones. Ten years ago it had small fish and no large fish. Ten years before that it was all large fish. The pike population in the lake has various sizes, with total numbers going up as the walleye peak in size. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
562147,Trailerguy,2006-11-29 18:23:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Think about this, For the sake of arguement. A 30""er lays 30,000 eggs and due to conditions at the time 3 eggs hatch that are females who survive to reproduce. The 1st one spawns when it's 14""er, then gets eaten by a pike. The 2nd one spawns several times but coditions are poor and when it's a 20""er an Eagle grabs it up of the spawning bed for lunch. The 3rd spawns sucessfully as a 30""er and dies a natural death. All three have 1 female offspring surviving to spawning age. Which one of the last 3 has the best ""genes""? The 14""er, 20"" er,or 30""er all had the same mother, the genes are the same, but the varied ages insured a hatch every year that conditions allowed. In my book the diverse ages are worth as much or more that size. Surviving to be a 30""er is luck of the draw not something spiecal about their ""genes"". Genes offer adaptability to make the best of the current conditions but don't guarentee luck. Populations that have only small fish when mature, are more likely caused by thousands of years of inbreeding in a closed system. As an example,there are a number of lake systems in Ontario that have Muskie populations that never grow over 40"". Having a 54"" minumum legal size is a joke. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

562151,v-bay gord,2006-11-29 20:57:00,3168,"When I asked a fisheries biologist about the theory that ""big hogs add little to the health of a fishery"" this is what I heard back....1) The concept that old, large walleye are sterile is highly unlikely. 2) Larger fish produce larger and more viable eggs than smaller fish. 3)Older fish put more energy into egg production than growth, hence their slower growth rate. 4)Larger fish contribute their growth genes to the population. 5)The average number of eggs in an Ontario walleye is 26,000 per pound....therefor a ten pound walleye would carry 260,000 eggs vs. a two pound fish with 52,000 eggs. 6) Fish hatcheries will use the eggs from large walleye. Would they do that if they thought it would compromise the overall production? You are right about some musky lakes in NW Ontario only having small musky. The MNR puts the 54"" size limit only on the lakes with trophy potential (ie. LOW, Eagle). Other musky lakes have smaller size limits. The idea that genes have nothing to do with a fish surviving to a large size is mostly correct, however if the fish doesn't have the potential in its genes even the most lucky of fish will never reach trophy size. The small lake that you describe having no harvest may have influences that are not common with most lakes. The fact that you fish it likely means others do as well. Small lakes are very suseptable to fishing pressure. Just some ideas to consider."

562156,Guest,2006-11-30 19:32:00,0,"One thing about larger fish. They have spawned many times, they are not new at the game. Their eggs are always getting deposited in the prime locations, because of experience and size. As for small lakes. Most are like goldfish in a fish tank. The smaller the tank, the smaller the fish will only grow. You will always have exceptions, but it is the rule."
562172,orchard frank,2006-12-01 20:04:00,1900,"You have to decide what is best for you and your group. I've been going to Canada pretty steady since the mid 60's, at first a bunch of young guys, roughing it, broke for the most part, ended up going to Lac Seul for at least 2 weeks a year from '92 til 2004, mostly with my wife, son some of the trips, buddies other times, our needs and wishes changed with the times. IMO the staff at the camp makes or breaks the trip, because the equipment, cleanliness, etc. etc. will all be a reflection of them. Young kids need LOTS of bites, size not that important, and short days. Drive to, boat in, fly in, housekeeping, American plan, each has its benefits and disadvantages. do the research and talk to someone you trust. Repeat business is a good indicator. We went to the same lodge nearly every trip for that last stretch (Lost Island Lodge), for us never felt the need to go elsewhere, although we did try some other lakes a few times in addition to the Lac Seul trips. Good Luck"
562179,Guest,2006-12-02 21:37:00,0,"Maybe I'm wrong, just a fisherman, after all. I would think that the older, larger fish stop spawning at some point. Is this true, or not."

562123,dutchboy,2006-11-28 02:13:00,5717,"Ya just can't argue with the quality of fishing in Canada. Outstanding quality and quanity, someone is doing something right! Kudo's :hail: As for Minnesota's problem it most likely has more to do with the DNR and their stocking program (or lack there of) then over harvest."
562125,River_eye,2006-11-28 08:46:00,1486,"Sure the MNR employs some smart people, but how many lakes do they actually get to experience under-foot, (or under boat). The lodge owner usually lives on the lake, and has local knowledge. I would hazard a guess that when a lodge owner chooses to go catch and release, it's because they feel the MNR regs aren't sufficient enough. Look at Sabaskong Bay, on LOTW, still decent fishing, but nowhere near the quality of other remote parts of the lake. This is proof that fishing pressure has an impact no matter what, and the MNR regs don't always do the job."

Fishing quality and equipment quality. 3. What draws you to try a new camp? Recommendations from friends. We like to fish different bodies of water. So, our preference is to try a new lake/lodge every year. 4. What turns you off enough to not return the next year? Poor fishing, unfriendly owners, and poor equipment. 5. What does it take to make you keep coming back? We have yet to find a lake/lodge that we really want to or absolutely have to go back to. 6. We have experienced some Do ""no fish taken home"" lakes chase you off or draw you to them? No fish taken home implies a quality fishery and larger fish. My group would be more likely to fish a lake like this just to see how good the fishing really is. 7. How important is it to take even the smaller limits home? It is a non issue. We eat fish almost every day. I think Baxter's first post hit the nail on the head for our group. It is about the experience and being able to get away from email, cell phones, and just have a good relaxing time."
562137,Trailerguy,2006-11-28 19:21:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Maybe I'm just pestmistic, but I'd venture there are more lodge owners who go catch and release because it's the trendy buzz words. They are hoping to snag some high end guests who would like to think the fishing is better because of it. So without exerting any energy or effert they have the ""best"" fishing hole. But that's fine, it keeps them from thrashing around ruining the really good fishing holes, eh? The truth is that lakes with no harvest eventually implode as the population gets to be predominatly ""old"" fish, only to regenerate and go through the cycle again. Maybe that's why the ministry usually sets the limits as 1 fish over XX inches, to cull those big hogs that are eating machines with little to add to the health of population. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
562138,v-bay gord,2006-11-28 21:50:00,3168,"Trailor-guy.....sorry to disagree but the truth is that fish populations will not implode when there is a no harvest situation. Natural mortality rates are in the order of 50% from one year class to the next...in other words you would expect to have half as many two year old fish as one year old. This continues on up the pyramid with the biggest, oldest fish being the smallest in the population. Contrary to myth, the biggest fish are vital to the health of the population by supplying the genes to potentially produce similar trophy sized fish......The bigger the female walleye is the more eggs she will produce. The fact that the population of these big fish is relatively small means their contribution to the total number of eggs laid is similarly small...but vital. The MNR regs that allow for harvest of one ""over"" bigger fish is more to appease the fishermen and lodge owners, and has no biologically positive result."
562139,Guest,2006-11-28 22:27:00,0,"I am not a biologist, but I have always heard that the reason that many lakes like Lac Seul have a slot limit, is because those slot size fish are younger and more fertile and produce the most eggs. The big old 31"" walleye will have less eggs than the 21"", just like a 55 year old woman is less likely to get pregnant than a 25 year old woman."
562142,v-bay gord,2006-11-29 08:06:00,3168,The reasoning behind the slot size is that it protects the highest percentage of the mature spawning population. The 21 inch fish will have far less eggs than the 31 incher but because that segment of the walleye population is more numerous the end result is more eggs are laid. The big fish contribute eggs but because they (big fish) are relatively few setting a slot size that takes in more of the population will have the best results. A healthy 31 inch walleye is an egg factory and it would definately not be a mistake to release all those big old fish.
562144,River_eye,2006-11-29 11:44:00,1486,"I had a different understanding of the issue. I have been told that the most prolific spawners are the fish in the low 20's (varies by lake) the Older fish, 28"" and up are less fertile. BUT..... they carry the genes of a 28"" fish so one fertile egg from a 28"" fish is worth more than a 22"" fish. Also, my opinion on the catch and release is that they genuinely want to help the fishery for the most part. Most don't go to C&R because they fear loss of guests wanting to take fish home. They don't start attracting the new guests until the fishing actually gets better. Just a theory, that's all. I agree that lakes with abnormally high populations of a species, can implode without harvest, but that is less likely to happen where there is a diverse species mix. Remember, there were strong populations of fish in these lakes long before we started fishing them. If populations implode because we go C&R then it's a result of a management screwup we did a while ago."

562031,Crede,2006-11-23 18:28:00,134,"The combination of the US-Canadian dollar exchange rate and the price of gas has got to be squeezing the owners pretty significantly - has to cause them to raise prices (in US dollars), cut profit, or both. When the US dollar was stronger, it helped them keep prices in US dollars relatively low. This is the other side of that coin. To answer your questions, in order of importance for our group when booking a fly-in : 1) Quality of fishing (primarily walleye) - We usually go to a place we have been before (rotate 2 of them). When trying a new place, only go to one personally recommended to us by someone who has been there before (and at the same part of the season). 2) Quality of equipment/accomodations. 3) Service. 4) Availability. Prefer the first and/or last few weeks of the season. 5) Cost. This may move up the list as more sons in our father-son combos start having to pay their own way. 6) Take home. Used to do it.
