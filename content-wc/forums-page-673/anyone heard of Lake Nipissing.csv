562130,Guest,2006-11-28 11:17:00,0,We are in the process of trying to find out about this lake(smallmouth primarily but a little bit of everything)and was hoping to find someone who has fished it?
562132,grt1,2006-11-28 16:56:00,259,Google the city of north bay ontario. it is on Lake nipissig and maybe you will get some information there.
562133,Guest,2006-11-28 18:00:00,0,"Hoosier, An extremely popular fishing lake for Ontario residents and some US residents alike. In fact, a reality fishing show was held on Nipissing 2 years ago. Anglers out of North Bay fish the eastern end of the lake a ton. The mouth of the French River (on the south shore) is perhaps the most heavily fished area, particularly at walleye opener. Some giant 'eyes have been known to come out of there. As you said, there is a little bit of everything in there. Fishing Nipissing or that whole area, IN GENERAL, is cheaper than most NWO (northwwestern ontario) destinations for example, particularly if you're in Southern Ontario, Michigan, Ohio, New York, etc. I haven't fished there in a long time, though I do know some who still do, and I would categorize the fishing as ""fair"" from an overall northern Ontario perspective. One last thing, it's big water that is wide open, no shelter, so plan accordingly. NWO Fishing Bum"
562134,Mondo_OH,2006-11-28 18:37:00,58,the fishing on Nipissing has really dropped off the last 10 yrs or so IMHO Google the Ontario Fishing Network message board you will get ALOT of help there
562158,guyzumi,2006-11-30 22:26:00,79,"I know of many people who fish Nipissing. I live about 45 minutes west, in Sudbury. Here is a site where some of the anglers may be able to help you out.www.neoba.org it is North Eastern Ontario Bass Anglers website. hope this helps, have fun, bring an extra prop or two!!"
562183,rockpt,2006-12-03 14:14:00,589,"I made two or three trips a year to Nip from the mid-80s to the late 90s. Fished the Sandy Island/mouth of French River area. Really beautiful, sheltered area with lots of islands, bays and narrow channels. The walleye fishing was really good in the 80s but steadily declined due to netting. According to Ontario MNR, the netting decimated the walleye fishing a few years ago and it's starting to recover, but nothing like it once was. My brother still makes one trip to Nip a year and last year, he caught less than 5 eyes in a week of fishing. I understand the smallies are much better if you know what you're doing. There's also lots of northern and some muskie, but it's not considered a premier muskie lake like Eagle, LOTW, etc. NWO Fishing Bum is right about the open water being dangerous. The open water portion runs west to east for miles and can get really nasty fast when the wind picks up. But the west arm or Sandy Island/French River areas are very sheltered."
