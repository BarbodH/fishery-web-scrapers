562064,Guest,2006-11-26 17:04:00,0,Be real carefull sending that Walleye back. Latest I'ver heard is that PETA is organizing Walleyes and Northerns and they'll be represented by a UNION. Heard they're doing the same with Deer and Moose. You're probably stepping on Brother Walleyes rights as a Union member by having him act as a bait fish. I'm also sure that there will be a school of Lawyers ready to represent brother Walleye in a Civil suit.

562068,Guest,2006-11-27 09:13:00,0,That is time consuming method of getting minnows. Use a minnow net! The chance of you getting caught is Slim to None. Anything you do in Canada is illegal other than reaching for youe check book to pay the goverment.

562051,Guest,2006-11-24 18:52:00,0,"...but, of course, many of us have had this happen dozens and dozens of times...and I'm sure many of us (myself included) have left the walleye in there if a pike took a pass at it or already had a hold of it. Quite often the pike won't let go. I've hand-landed numerous pike, who won't let go of the walleye, even with my hand across the top of their heads behing the gill plates...still won't let go. The largest pike I've landed like this, unhooked, was 35"", holding onto a 19"" walleye broad-side. I'd say the most common from my experience are pike in the 30-32"" range, attacking walleye in the 15-18"" range. NWO Fishing Bum"

562054,bellbuoy,2006-11-25 06:09:00,490,Wouldn't a Northern in that range (32-35 inches) be protected and have to be released anyway? Isn't the slot range 27.5 to 35.4 inches (70-90 cm)? Bellbuoy

Looking forward to a hardy discussion on this one, Thanks,"
