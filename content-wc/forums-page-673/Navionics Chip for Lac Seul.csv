I thought they were to finish the work this summer so just wondering if the new info has been added to the chip? If anyone knows the release date, that would help. I don't want to buy a chip unless it has this new data on it."

Navionics sent me a couple of screen shots of the old data and it was bare bones. I will hold off buying this chip until the information has been updated, just wanting to know when that is."
