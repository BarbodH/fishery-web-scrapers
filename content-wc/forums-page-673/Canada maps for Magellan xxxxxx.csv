I just used it on a 600 mile trip over Turkey Day, with the pre-set map that came with it - it worked great and was on to a T, eventhough I already knew where I was going and didn't need the assistance. So, being new to this GPS stuff, does anyone know if you can download maps of Ontario/Canada or specifically Lac Seul, for Magellan GPS units? Thanks!"
