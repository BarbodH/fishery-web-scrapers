Early in the season which is my only experience on the lake the walleye and pike are very active and we catch many if not most of the walleyes on crankbaits which I like. For our group the biggest fish have been 44 inch pike, 29 inch walleyes and 19 inch smallies. We did get into some Lake trout one year and caught a dozen or so up to 25 inches or so. They are nice folks, we have only stayed at Caribou Falls which is the drive in housekeeping camp. The other two are fly or boat in. Since most of our group take their boats we stay at Caribou Falls since the other camps rates are built around their providing guides and boats with no allowance if you bring your boat so it is way cheaper and I don't want to give up fishing from my own boat. We always catch plenty of fish and it is a conservation waters area only so should stay productive for years to come. Paul"
