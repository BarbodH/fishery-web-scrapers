Check out KO Lodge. The river has a lot of walleye pike large smallmouth and an occasional sturgeon. The lodge is the best and their are also cabins if you want. I have fished all over Quebec and Ontario of the last 15 years and if I was taking a young guy withe me this would be the first place I would consider to break him into fishing. Good luck on whatever you do"

A different twist this year, I will be taking my 13 yr old grandson for the first time. We would use the American plan and don,t want to long or hard of a drive from Erie, Pa. Domaine Shannon East of La Verendrye preserve looks interesting and may be what we are looking for. My concerns are; How long and what is the condition of the dirt road to Domaine Shannon? I would be driving a Honda crv, is this type vehicle Ok for the road? The fishing does not have to be trophy or huge quantities just enough to keep us interested. Any information or suggestions will be appreciated. Thank you,"
561920,retire55,2006-11-07 15:02:00,1029,"Hi Seanik: I looked up the brochure I have for Domaine Shannon. On the map providing directions to get there, it is stated that the distance travelled on the Clova Road is 45 miles and then there's 8 miles from the Clova Road to Lac Sequin. I can't speak to the condition of the road or whether a Honda CRV is an acceptable vehicle to make the journey."

561963,Guest,2006-11-14 22:05:00,0,"seanik- having driven the clova road many times, even 45 miles can be rough. i dont know what a CRV is car or SUV but any vehicle with low clearance will bi in trouble- if you took your time and paid attention it could be done but you would have to be real carefull- after any rain storm the road can change drasticlly- perhaps some of the guys on here who go to osullivan lake can help you. if you are just looking for good fishing, you might want to check with some of the guys who go to the cabonga resevoir- i understand that the fishing there is much improved the last years but have never actually fished it. - another place to try would be the ottawa river up aroung deep river, 1 hr above ottawa- have fished the river there and did real well- paved road all the way-another place might be the camps around Mt lauier Quebec- good road and nice camps- lots to do in that area beside fishing- w ehad a vehicle breakdown there last year and stayed in 2 days - had a ball- rented atv's and mountain bikes as well as fished good luck but the clova road can be rough or easy - one never knows wg"
561983,Seanik,2006-11-16 17:45:00,218,"Hi Walleye General, Thank you and the previous posters for the input. The Honda CRV is a small suv with almost 9"" of ground clearance, but it's a 2006 and still pretty and the Clova road might mark it up a bit. We are now looking at taking a train out of Senneterre to Clova and having our outfitter pick us up and transport us to the lodge, possibly on the Gouin Reservoir. The train trip to Clova from Senneterre takes a little over 2 hours and costs 43.30 roundtrip. The problem is fitting arriving and leaving times into the outfitters schedule and yours. The planning continues,"
561986,Guest,2006-11-16 22:40:00,0,Seanik- if you are going to clova- why would you drive to Senneter-thats about a 13 hr drive for you- you could drive to clova in less time and not worry about the train- the road to clove thru Mount lauier and parent is fine and would be no problem- we drive it each year - while the last 100 mile is gravel road other than the small stones the road is a highway compared to the other clova road- we can easly drive 45/50 mph- the drive time from the 1000 idlands to mt lauier is about 3 hours and an addtional drive time to clove about 3-1/2 - have you picked a outfitter on the gouin? i would guess you are flying in to the goiun- have fished the gouin often- some great trips and some so-so- thats fishing is guess i know several guys who take the train from montreal to clova and also know guys who take it from new york city- dont know your cost restraint but i have been with several outfitters who will fly you in to the goiun from St anne du lac- no gravel road at all- i also had a great trip years ago with a outfitter flyin from deep river off the ottawa river- paved road all the way- the one thing to remember about the train is they only run to clova once a day- if you are weather delayed getting out of you camp on departure day you will miss the train- - lets talk abit and ill try to help insure a good trip- if you have a phone number email to me at [email protected] and we can share some thoughts- hope this helps- good fishing area up there- have been going every year last 25 years WG
561993,retire55,2006-11-17 14:54:00,1029,Hello again Seanik: Can you share with us which outfitter you will be using that has cabins on the Gouin Reservoir? Thanks
561998,Seanik,2006-11-18 10:07:00,218,"Hello Retire55, The outfitter is; La Pointe aux Dore (Walleye Point). We were there in 2004 and 2005 and really liked their operation and the only downside was the approximately 180 miles of dirt road from Mt.Laurier. The Gouin Reservoir now has slot limits but I'm not sure what they are. We where there in early Aug. on both trips and the Walleye bite was plentiful but on the small side. All in all it was a very relaxing trip with a lot of sheltered fishing water."
562000,retire55,2006-11-18 11:54:00,1029,"Hi again Seanik: Thanks for the information. I recently read on Quebecpeche.com (an all French web site dedicated to fishing in Quebec) that the powers to be have decided NOT to introduce a walleye slot limit on the Gouin Reservoir in 2007 or in 2008. Although I have yet to see an official press release, the information posted came from a very reliable source."
562016,PIKEMAN1,2006-11-21 20:36:00,14,"The Clova Road is very rough.About 20 mph is about all I could do in pick up truck.Berthelot lake outfitters is 70 miles east of senneterre on a very good dirt road,55 mph easy.they fly out to gouin and several other lakes.they are very good people.From Clova there is an outfitter called Tamarac Air Service that flys to Gouin and Lake Hebert which is better than Gouin.If you would like to talk e-mail me your phone number and I will call you."" Good fishing"" [email protected]"
