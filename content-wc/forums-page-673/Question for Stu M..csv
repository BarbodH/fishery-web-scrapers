There are area's that will need to be avoid for a little longer, but there are also plenty of TOP producing area's ready to go NOW!!! I was on the ice just prior to this latest cold snap and there was just over three inches of ice. We did put in a small effort and didi manage to catch a couple of small 'eyes and dropped one that had some weight! The current forecast is calling for a major drop in temps beginning tonight, By tomorrow the ice will be prime in an area that always produces hawg's for us!!! When are you planing to head up this way? Stu. Shoot me a PM and I'll give you home tel. number.[email protected]"
