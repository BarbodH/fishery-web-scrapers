Someone please explain how you can be unsuccessful and then still have to pay, if it is 100% guarenteed (perhaps I am reading it wrong). Looking at there site was comparable to watching a used car dealer commerical (no offense to any used car dealers, just a stereotype). I wonder if their guests are allowed in the water? I am willing to bet the other lodges around the lake drove them out of business, due to there arrogance and poor marketing skills. That would explain why they are the only people in the world to bad mouth Lac Seul. Needless to say I will never be going to Forrest Lodge."

563932,JDP,2007-03-15 22:00:00,1457,"I have fished Lac Seul since 1986. Many years I have fished a week in May, a week in July and a week in September. I can tell you without a doubt,my opinion only, that the fishing pressure in July has increased SIGNIFICANTLY over the last 5-6 years. People have started to take ""day trips"" to Lac Seul from neighboring lakes. I support this opinion with the observation of a startling increase in the use of the one public access that I can observe during my stays. I really don't agree with ""Forrest Lodge"" that Lac Seul is suffering water clarity/quality issues from and Houseboats and Outposts. The number of houseboats and outposts are controlled. (NWO Fishing Bum or Destroyer correct me if I am wrong!) Yes Sunlight, Broad and Vaughn are crowded at certain times. This is beacuse the fisherman are lazy and are not willing to put in the time to find fish on their own. The well run resorts occupancy rates have to be much higher than they were 5,10 years ago. This increased demand has been fueled to some degree by Internet Message Boards such as Wallleye Central. This fast rising demand has enabled resorts to raise package rates, apply and raise minimum cabin charges. The rates at the resort I have frequented have increased,depending on your party size,25%-50% during the perod of 2002-2007. I will agree with ""Forrest Lodge"" that there are many other lakes in Northwest Ontario that one could pursue and have an enjoyable Canadaian experience."

Yes there is a significant increase in numbers of people visiting Seul every year but is it too many for the lake to handle, no. I don't like to see more people on the lake either but the water quality is not going to suffer because a few people are bathing in the lake...that's a bit of a stretch forrest lodge. Will Lac Seul turn into the next Lake of the Woods in 10 years? No. They will not allow that much development on the lake, but the days of fishing in solitude are over I am afraid. Your right, this board has definately contributed to the popularity of the lake. D"

563802,schick,2007-03-09 18:15:00,35,"Can anyone tell me what the conditions are like at Lac Seul. The latest lake levels are apparently a little down, but I wondered if there is a good snowpack that will bring the lake up? Also is there an extraordinary thickness of ice? Last year the ice went out very early, but I suspect it might be later this year. Does anyone have a site you can to get snowpack, ice conditions, weather, etc., for the Lac Seul area? Getting anxious. NE Piker"
563882,Skylane,2007-03-14 04:16:00,101,"Not big snow this year, neighbor on our lake (south of Lac Seul) says the ice is about 30 inches. We need a lot more snow and or rain to get our lake levels up to where they need to be for this time of year, my lake is down at least 2 feet. Heading up tomorrow and will do a little fishing for a week or so."
563910,Guest,2007-03-15 10:20:00,0,"Get off Lac Seul. I lived on Lac Seul for 6 years and sold my camp because of the increase in fishing pressure. In my opinion and that of some of my guests, it was not a good Canadian experience. Try to fish Vaughn lake with 20 or so other boats, go to Broad or Sunlight and same thing, more boats. Wennesaga, same , just to many fisherman after the same thing in a lake that is giving up to many fish to too many people. Water depth and clarity are critical factors for a healthy fishery, house boat gray water, outpost camps dumping gray water and the volume of outpost users that bathe in the lake are all serious indicators of whats to come. I might suggest that there are other quality fisheries in Ontario without the pressure of Lac Seul, and the Lac Seul price tag. I have a photo of a 36"" 14# walleye that was released during a late July fishing trip. Many of my guests catch well over 200 fish daily with most in the 16-19"" range. Shop around before you worry to much more about water depth on the Lac Seul flowage."

563914,Guest,2007-03-15 11:03:00,0,"Lac Seul is a good lake, if you like the volume of people on it. I had some very good fishing when I lived there. The implementation of the slot size has helped to improve the number of fish, although it has also put tremendous pressure on the under 18"" fish. Lac Seul sells itself, many fisherman have heard the name and have had the opportunity to fish for the walleye and now a good musky population. I simply feel that when a person comes to Ontario to experience the Canadian wilderness and pays good money for it, they should get what they pay for. Ontario is known for its quality of fishing and the numerous tourist lodges and resorts. Lac Seul, I'm afraid, is becoming over exploited. Lodging rates are going up faster than inflation, of course supply and demand dictate this increase. I would hate to see Lac Seul turned into another Lake Of The Woods. I'm all for growth mind you, but not at the expense of our guests.Hope for heavy late season snow or early pre-opener rains. And maybe the LOTWWCB will keep the dam closed."
563915,Guest,2007-03-15 11:08:00,0,"Vaughn never was just a fly in, and yes it was closed due to over fishing. If you were in there by yourself in the early 80's consider yourself lucky. Tons of walleye but nothing big, try the sand banks."
563921,Guest,2007-03-15 14:43:00,0,"""Vaughn never was just a fly in"" I guess since I dont remember seeing any houses or cabins I just thought it was..again it was 26 yrs ago..funny thing about it was, out of almost 30 trips to Canada on several different lakes, that one time to Vaughn was the only time we've ever been checked by the MNR"

I have fished the Northeast section of Lac Seul for more than 10 years and if our group comes across 2 or 3 other boats during the course of the day that is a lot. Even on our boat ride to camp out of Deception Bay I don't see that many boats. I live in New York where the lakes are packed with both fisherman and pleasure boaters week in and week out, regardless we still have several of the top fisheries in North America (Lake Erie, Oneida, Champlain ...). Your negativity towards Lac Seul is not very well justified."
563923,Guest,2007-03-15 16:53:00,0,I agree. Theres many parts of Lac Seul you wont see many fishermen or boats. I am a pilot who flies over Lac Seul almost everyday flying people into the fly in lakes north of the Lac Seul area. I see boats from the air but not the huge numbers of boats.
