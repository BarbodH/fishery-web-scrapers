562410,Trailerguy,2006-12-22 22:45:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Tallpines is located in a relativly shallow lobe of the lake. Not much going on there, however the ""river"" flows through that area. So the 1st narrows, which is about a 1/2 mile west funnels fish between the shallow (less than 6') to the deeper water in the next portion of the lake ( up to 30') section. That area is right in front of my cottage. You can catch some fish in that section, especially in the spring. But most of the year your best fishing or easyiest (for a newbie)is going to be farther north to the ""big"" lake or Gawley's bay. That's 7 or 8 miles across the water. There are other closer places that may be turned on at a given time, as well, the camp owners will know where people have been catching fish at what ever time of the year you go up. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

562113,Guest,2006-11-27 16:00:00,0,Only drawback to Wabby is the clear water. I would rather be on a stained lake. Fishing can be easier and more productive in stained water. Of course we like to catch fish but it may not be as important to others.
562120,Trailerguy,2006-11-27 22:13:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]How ""clear"" the water is on Wabby is dependant on where you are at and when you are there. Deep water tends to be clearer than shallow. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
562131,Guest,2006-11-28 11:49:00,0,Hey Trailer Guy You know anything about Eagles Nest they say it just down road from Dutchies store.
562135,Trailerguy,2006-11-28 19:03:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]No, I've not heard anything,but I haven't been up there since Grouse season. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
562141,Skylane,2006-11-29 06:20:00,101,"Trailer Guy, heard the partridge were thick this fall. Wanted to get up, but it did not work out. My lake neighbor and his group got 86. How did you do?"
562148,Trailerguy,2006-11-29 18:26:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I was there for 10 days, took my limit daily, usually before 9 am. It took a couple of months before fried chicken even sounded good again. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
562154,Guest,2006-11-30 18:58:00,0,Wondering what the fishing is like on Wabaskang near the Eagles Nest camp? Been to Wine and curious if it would be worth my time to stay there.
