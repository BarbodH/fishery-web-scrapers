563682,walleyewarriorwannabe,2007-02-28 16:41:00,2,I am going to the northwest arm of Rainy Lake the first week in July. Any information that will help me fish for the walleyes in that area will be appreciated. Thanks
563773,Guest,2007-03-08 16:06:00,0,they should be easy to find on any reef or rock hump that tops out at 15-25 feet.if you have a navionics mapping unit you'll have no trouble finding them.otherwise you can locate them the hard way with a paper map.they are usually aggressive all day and will gobble half a crawler on a jig or rig.last year they were even suspended off the sides of the humps and could be caught trolling deep diving cranks.

564127,walleyewarriorwannabe,2007-03-27 06:39:00,2,We will be staying at Amik Lodge. This is a realtively new operation with only a few cabins. The owner/operator Vince Amik will be providing maps of the area and I expect we will get information from him. I am looking for other opinions and options on what to do. he indicated to me that he has success with crawlers but not as much with leeches. Any additional information is appreciated.
