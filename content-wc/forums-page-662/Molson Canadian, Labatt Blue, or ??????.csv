563902,wacky tambaqui,2007-03-14 19:04:00,10,I'll have Alexander Keith's or any Sleeman's beer at the fishing hole any day. Another good bet is Molson Ex -which I also call Vitamin X -to liven things up on the lake ;-)

564094,Guest,2007-03-23 17:34:00,0,Trolling for kings on L Ontario a few years past and we had a cooler full of three different beers. All on board bypassed the other two till the Molson Golden was gone. late in the afternoon I reached into the bottom of the cooler and low and behold found one last Molson hiding in the corner. You'd a thought I just won the lottery when I pulled that one up from the ice. Molson Golden all the way!!!!!
564095,Guest,2007-03-24 06:18:00,0,Last year we stopped in a small bait beer place in northern ontario and thought we would give Carling Black Label a shot. We hadn't drank this since we were kids and figured a six would not hurt. If it was bad we could just feed it to the fish. I was shocked how good it was or possibly we were real thirsty.
564100,guide7,2007-03-24 17:10:00,70,"Can you say ""Kokanee""? Best beer I have ever had. Brewed in British Columbia and available in any Beer Store in Ontario. I always bring some home on our way back thru the Duty Free shop. 7"
563854,biggeorge50,2007-03-12 12:32:00,128,High octane as in Molson XXX. 6.7 or 6.8 I believe.
563859,Guest,2007-03-12 13:12:00,0,"We usually get a little each of Molson's, Labatt Blue, and Moosehead. Push comes to shove, Dad gets the last Molson's and I get the last Labatts."
563860,Guest,2007-03-12 13:28:00,0,"Just tell him you want some ""Hi Test"" He may be impressed. If he isn't tell you some ""O'Keefe Extra Old Stock Malt Liquor"" The original strong 6 % he man's swill, If you can choke this stuff down ,you can drink anything.first beer I could afford as a kid in the good old Stubbies!!"
563873,Guest,2007-03-13 07:13:00,0,Free beer.cold beer and my brother in-laws beer are my 3 favs to drink. But Sleeman Cream Ale or the IPA Ale is a good choice and Keiths is good also. I can't remember seeing Keiths anywhere but in Nova Scotia.
563875,Guest,2007-03-13 14:42:00,0,"I look at beer as your just borrowing it anyways for alittle while. Cheaper the better, but a good cold Blue is always preferred. Keiths too. You can buy Keiths in other places than out East. Its carried in alot of places around NW Ontario. Even a Coors Light, its brewed by Molson, sure beats an American Coors Light."
563877,Matches,2007-03-13 18:08:00,236,"Even the American Brewed,King of Beers, Budweiser you purchase in Canada is 5% Alcohol which you can't get in the US. Figure that one out. In Canada, it's always a BLUEtiful day!"
563879,Guest,2007-03-13 20:16:00,0,cant go wrong with a 24 of carling for 26.40 or james ready for the same price
563887,Crappie Kid,2007-03-14 10:00:00,1581,It was 73 here in N. IL today and I stopped on the way home for 12'er of 'Blue'. I plopped on the driveway and my neighbors had no problem helping me polish it off. Now back to winter.
563888,jigman 2003,2007-03-14 10:13:00,981,"Too bad it wasn't ""real"" Blue. I'll drink Americanized Blue, but it sure isn't the same as the Canadian. You guys who mention IPA's; do any of them come in cans? I'd really like to have some, but all the IPA's I've found in the states come in bottles only. Nothing like one of those hoppy brews on a hot day....... Talked to my outfitter, stuck with Molson Canadian, Blue and Blue Light. Oh well"
563898,Thunderstick,2007-03-14 17:42:00,35,"http://www.thebeerstore.ca/ Check out this site. They say that in heaven there is no beer. But if you believe that Ontario is heaven then, good news...there's beer!!"
563799,1shooter,2007-03-09 17:15:00,1493,Kokanee all the way
563801,Guest,2007-03-09 17:39:00,0,I'll second the Sleeman Honey Brown Ale. Could go for one right now.
563804,Guest,2007-03-09 18:28:00,0,"I am from the Land of Beer on Lake of the Woods....all of us locals drink Old Vienna beer brewed by Molson. I agree with others that Molson Canadian is the worst beer going in Canada. It is just an overrated beer, purchased because it is shown so much in commercials."
563805,Guest,2007-03-09 20:58:00,0,"Labatt Blue. Wish I had one right now. 3 months from today, I will be drinking one in the cabin! Fritz:cheers:"
563807,PJM,2007-03-09 22:19:00,3516,jigman 2003 Labatt Crystal is my favorite beer in Canada.........
563812,bugsy,2007-03-10 05:32:00,49,"For anyone looking for a full-flavored treat, try Labatt Ice. To me, Blue is great, Labatt Ice is even greater."
563817,Guest,2007-03-10 08:05:00,0,Put me down for a 12 of Blue. :cheers:
563818,Guest,2007-03-10 09:00:00,0,"Well up here in the land of Ice n Snow us Canadians love our beer.... anyways on to my answer.... I drink a brew called MacLays it is brewed by Sleeman and is 27.00 a 24... Good price right? it is an awesome price for a Sleeman made beer... it is a India Pale Ale just like Alexander Keiths but at a faction of the price and it tastes just like it. if your looking for a bargain and like Keiths, Give MacLays a try. A Canuck."

563846,jigman 2003,2007-03-12 06:21:00,981,"Thanks for some different brands. Since I buy our beer from our outfitter, would these brands be available from him? I know-I should ask him, just don't want to sound like what one Canadian oufitter (who I never used again) called me-""f#$%ing tourist""."
563778,jigman 2003,2007-03-09 07:18:00,981,"Thinking of sitting on the deck in Canada and enjoying a cold one. Wondering what everyone's preference in cold drinks is? I tried some Kokanee last year, good stuff, but kind of lacking in the flavor department."
563781,Guest,2007-03-09 08:03:00,0,Anything you're paying for
563782,uzzi,2007-03-09 08:37:00,349,"Coors Light, Canadian or Alexander Keiths are all my personal favorites"
563785,T Mac,2007-03-09 09:51:00,10084,"Try some ""Boh"" (Bohemian). That's what I usually buy. But...I like Molson, and Blue...and Kokanee and whatever else is in the cooler. I also like Blue Moon ;)"
563786,mcdee,2007-03-09 12:05:00,276,After a hard 12 hour day shingling roofs or any other labor intensive job! Nothing is more refreshing then a couple of Canadian cool ones in a row!:cheers:
563789,Guest,2007-03-09 13:20:00,0,Had some Rickards Red and also their India Pale Ale last year. Both were real fine IMO. I do like Alexander Keiths alot too.
563790,biggeorge50,2007-03-09 13:57:00,128,I don't really care for the high octane stuff. Molson Export is what I normally drink up there.
563791,Guest,2007-03-09 13:59:00,0,"Glad to hear you guys enjoy are fine canadian beer. And good to see you drinkning some pretty fine brands such as Alexander Keiths, and Rickards Red/Pale. Molson Canadian is absolute swill compared to those others I mentioned, never drink it!! You should try also Sleemans, they make a honey brown, cream ale and others, and my personal favourite Moosehead(green bottle). As previously menioned, nothing is better than a crisp cool beer after a hot day on the job or on the water....except maybe two or three. D"
563793,uzzi,2007-03-09 14:46:00,349,"Molson Export is still 5% alcohol...same as most other regular beers...so not sure what you are meaning by high octane? I've persoanlly never had Export, I'm not sure its available in Western Canada (where I'm from). But its an ale, not a lager, so maybe you're referring to the taste or the ""bite"" as compared to a crisp lager? Just curious."
563798,Guest,2007-03-09 17:09:00,0,"a blue bottle right out of the icy slushy cooler..the label just slides when you touch it, a little carbonation cloud at the bottle top after its opened,the chilly sweat on the bottle,and your slip bobber goes under.... get the picture. runnin for a 12er now.. bender goooone!!"
