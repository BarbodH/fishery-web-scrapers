A fishing trip with my wife allows us to spend ten days alone without distactions. Sort of lets us get back to our friendship that gets watered down the rest of the year. Those of us who make a trip with our wives have figured out what works for the girls and still allows some serious fishing for us. If she points out a new place she wants to fish, we go fish it. We have found some dandy new spots from her just saying ""let's go over behind that place and try it"". She has no pre-concieved notions of where the fish ""should"" be. She tries color combinatins I would not even consider and outfishes me many days. I've learned to not poke fun at her choice of lures. When it comes to trying something different or experimenting she is far more patient than my regular buddies. Keep it simple and fun. Bait her hook and remove her fish for her. Do dishes.

564096,Guest,2007-03-24 09:37:00,0,"My wife & I have gone a a couples trip with her sister and her husband for the past nine years to Ontario. We started out on Eagle, went to the Indian Chain for a couple years, and have fished Lac Seul for the past three. My wife insists (along with her sister) this is her FAVORITE vacation of all because it is so relaxing and they love the beauty of the Canadian wilderness. What makes the trip all the more enjoyable for the ladies is some compromise on the part of myself and my brother-in-law. As follows: (1) Time of year/weather-I love early June fishing, but the weather can be still kind of iffy. You can catch as many fish in late July or early August on Lac Seul and the weather is much warmer which is the liking of the ladies. If fishing is slow, they love to tan! (2) Cabin-basic accomodations are fine as long as they are CLEAN!! We stay at Scout Lake Resort, the cabins are nothing fancy but they are very comfortably furnished, good beds/mattresses and most importantly they are very clean!! (3) Bringing a couple bottles of wine for the ladies to enjoy with dinner never hurts!! (4) Remember its a vacation, not just a fishing trip-We rarely are out on the water before 8 in the morning, we pack a nice lunch and picnic on an island during the day and we come in for dinner around 7 p.m. and play some cards, relax with an adult beverage or two and are in for the nite. We still catch plenty of fish and it doesn't become work for them. }("
564122,Guest,2007-03-26 15:05:00,0,"The outhouse is a problem with some. But a couple buckets of water every day down the hole helps keep smell down.Keep the lid down, Mothballs work also. You can also put some wood ashes down the hole this helps.Do not fish them to death ,my wife likes to fish but not from 6am til 8 0r 9 pm."
564036,Guest,2007-03-21 13:38:00,0,This year three of us guys are taking our wives along to Canada. My wife has never been up there and has limited experience fishing. Any of you who have been in this situation have some words of wisdom to offer?
564037,jigman 2003,2007-03-21 14:15:00,981,"I'm still trying to get mine to go, but if I did, this would be my plan. 1. Go to a place with FANTASTIC fishing so I could catch a lot of fish in a hurry (to satisfy that urge), and so she wouldn't need much skill to catch plenty of fish. Nothing like frustration to shut down the fishing. 2. Go to a place with some or all of the meals provided. While I personally don't like American plan places, for her I think it would be nice. 3. Go to a place that has some comfortable furnishings. Nothing like sitting on a hard log bench or chair while reading a book to guarantee no return trip. 4. Change my focus regarding fishing. I learned this a few years back with musky fishing in northern WI. I used to go and pound the water for hours and hours everyday. I was then too tired to go out and do some of the ""night"" things. I now go and do a little fishing and a lot of the ""night"" things. She's happy and I'm happy. As we all know, ""...if Momma ain't happy, nobody's happy"""
564038,Guest,2007-03-21 14:28:00,0,"About 3 years ago, my wife decided she wanted to go. With no other wives going and her not ever fishing much, I worried that this would be trouble. I fish at least 12 hours a day in the heat, cold, wind or rain. She assured me that she would be fine reading and relaxing in the cabin, maybe fishing off the dock, or even on nice days, fish on the boat. After the fist day of catching keeper walleyes on the dock, she tried the boat. By day 7 she was a diehard fisherman. For months leading up to the trip, I worried about all the bad things that might happen, when in fact, it turned out to be one of the best things I could imagine. She is now on her third year and looks forward to and is an integral part of the trip. Don't worry so much, if my wife enjoys it (she is not an outdoor person), I think most wives would. Besides the drive( from Oklahoma), what is not to like about a Canadian fishing trip?"
564039,Guest,2007-03-21 14:33:00,0,"I agree with the post above. Im a pilot in NW ontario and would love to promote a fly in trip for what your looking for. If you think the secluded setting is what they would want, by all means do a fly in. I would, if its there first time, recommend a lodge type setting on a good fishing lake. Boat in is nice but a drive in where you can get to your car and go for a drive to break the trip up might not be a bad idea. Depends if your familiar with the lake, mabey hire a guide day or 2 to put you on fish quicker intill you learn the lake??? Just ideas to keep the trip fun for them and good chances they'll want to join again in the future. Trip length?? How long do you think they can handle doing a trip is the question. All depends on what you think they'll enjoy.."
564041,2 DOGS,2007-03-21 16:40:00,361,"I did this over 15 years ago and it was the best thing I ever did. This will be the 10th summer we have spent on Lac Seul. It turned out she loved it and I have a fishing partner about 5 days a week. (She still has the good sense to stay in when the weather is bad.) I also had the good fortune that something happened about every other year, whereby she would say, what every man dreams of hearing, well the second most wanted, ""wouldn't you like a bigger boat?"" We have gone from a 16' Lund in 97 to a Triton 215X, with a new boat in 98, and 2000. Now you tell me if it isn't a good idea to take your wife fishing? I've done a lot of stupid things in my 64 years but that sure wasn't one of them. Well, maybe talking her into going deep sea fishing, ONCE! That will remain a ""guy thing""."
564045,Guest,2007-03-21 18:26:00,0,"i took my young bride to lac des milles lacs 15 yrs ago with my current fishng buddy and his wife.it was one of the best and most talked about trips ever..(4 people in a chevy cavalier for 14 hours).it was like taking a kid for the first time.small northern were a treat and cigar walleyes brought yips and hollars.the excitement of having someone new with no excpectations is priceless. we also had built in cooks and housekeepers.(not that we expected this, but it was a bonus)and having someone to bunk with besides ""hubba bubba"" also added some extra treats. we now are on our 6th trip coming up in sept.and i prefer her company over anyone elses.(i also get a 2nd trip of the year as she prefers to go in the late summer when the weather is nice..)trolling crank baits is very easy fishing, and teaching her to jig was easy as well. getting her involved was the best thing i could have done. now when i have conversations with the guys, she is included and adds her own input and enthusiasm..treat her right when you are there and you will have a fishing partner(that doesnt snore) for life.. jig out"
564047,Guest,2007-03-21 21:44:00,0,"Best advise ever for you. Find out what week and where I am going, and go the week before me. My entire life I always have heard ""you should have been here last week.....""."
564049,Guest,2007-03-22 02:16:00,0,"A happy wife means a happy husband.(this works with kids to)Make sure she is confortable with whatever situation your in.If she says it's to wavy, go to a spot where it is protected,don't argue with her,explain that the fish are biting but if she says that she wants to move do it.Don't huff and puff.Make sure she has a great time even if it means catching slimers in a bay when all the other boats are catching 24 in. walleyes on the main lake.It won't take long before she starts counting down the minutes until next years trip. Terry"
564051,Guest,2007-03-22 06:31:00,0,"Only two keys to happiness: 1) pick a nice cabin and 2) make sure it is set in a nice location (near the water with a good view and some open areas and rocks right out the door). Even if this means sacrificing on the fishing quality, go for these two first. My wife has gone up north on remote lake fly-ins with me twice now (with another couple) and the thing the ladies like most is a nice clean cabin. The second thing they like is a nice view from the front window and/or deck and a nice ""yard"" to walk around. Remember, they don't view the camp as just a place to stuff some food down and get eight hours of shut eye between fourteen hour fishing marathons. This is their home for several days. And if your wife is like mine, she may want to spend a few more hours on shore than the boys do. So make sure the setting is nice. I think hot running water is also a necessity too, which a lot of the deluxe places have. And I think a lodge with meals is not required. At least on our trips, one of the highlights of the day is everyone (not just the ladies) chipping in and creating a good meal in the evening."
564053,jigman 2003,2007-03-22 06:47:00,981,"I would agree that a fancy lodge isn't a priority IF I were to go with another couple or two. I was thinking of a trip with just my wife and I when I first posted. Going with another couple(s) would be a different situation in my mind. My first priority would still be easy, world class fishing."
