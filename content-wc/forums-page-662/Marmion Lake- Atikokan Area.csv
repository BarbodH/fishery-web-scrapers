Does anyone have any advice or tips for Marmion in early may? Any other advice for Atikokan lakes in the spring? Specifically wondering about Turle, Icy, Eye, and Williams."

If you see a 14' Lund with a Johnson 20hp (me) or a 16' Grumman with a 25hp Johnson (fishing buddy) both with Wisconsin numbers, it might be us. We stay at Finlayson and launch at the landing along the hyway. For eyes in the spring I would recomend the Seine River north of Marmion. We camped on an island in the river for years until the laws changed about twenty years ago and you were forced to go through an outfitter. Most of our group at that time were retired and we started taking the easy way, houseboating on LOTW. A few of us however still fished Marmion for snakes. The last time I went, Marmion was CPR only for eyes."

I've fished up there for several years but have never really paid attention to the names of all the lakes and rivers. If not, how do I get to the Seine and where should we concentrate our efforts? thanks for the help!"
