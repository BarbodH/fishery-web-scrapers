564183,Guest,2007-03-29 18:20:00,0,"Mark R.-I understand what you are saying. However, to me, the intent is the same. You know when you're lit (I do anyway). If you know you've had a couple too many and get behind the wheel anyway, then you are being reckless, just like you are when you point a loaded gun at someone. Perhaps the charge would go from first degree homicide to negligent homicide. Either way, it's homicide in my book. Look guys, drink all you want. Just get a DD. If you can't get a DD, then call a cab, walk home, wait it out, whatever."
564193,Guest,2007-03-30 11:44:00,0,"They would not let us continue. We had to go back to U.S. soil no matter what. There we could either drop him off then return, or just stay in the U.S. We had decided as a group beforehand that if he was not allowed through we would stay in Minnesota. Bander6"

The guy set out to kill the family with his vehicle the moment he put the keys in the ignition!!!!!!!!! Don't drink and drive; it the new generation. Stay in the US if you have issues with other laws in other countries. You wonder why Americans are despised around the world. Jigman 2003 said it best about 8 threads ago!!! This topics has got to stop on this website."
564200,Dacotah Eye,2007-03-31 11:32:00,2722,"The paper he filled out was more than likely an application for a Ministers permit which has a $200 fee attached to it. The paper work he was supposed to fill out was probably for a Permanent Certificate of Rehabilitation and would cost $1,000. I found this information at TIAC Customs and Borders. If your DUI is older than 10 years you may be considered rehabilitated. :cheers:"
564165,Old Critter,2007-03-29 10:11:00,14,"Expungement requires a court hearing that results in an order sealing the file and ""expunging"" the charge or conviction from your record. There are different kinds of expungement proceedings and all expungements are not the same - even if you are successful in obtaining one. Technically, once an expungement is achieved, customs shouldn't be able to access files that have been sealed. But to be safe, a person entering Canada with a expunged charge or conviction should have a certified copy of the expungement in his possesion. The other option is to contact the Canadian consulate and comply with their ""rehabitation"" requirements - and pay the fees."
564166,jigman 2003,2007-03-29 10:21:00,981,"Every year some Americans (I'm one too) have to come on here and complain about Canadian laws. Every year I get a kick out of it. Most of the guys complaining about Canadian laws are the same ones that are the first to say ""America, love it or leave it"". We sure don't want to ""bend"" our laws to assist ""foreigners"", but expect the rest of the world to accommodate us. If you made a mistake, then be responsible and take care of it the right way. Use one of the links posted on this thread and fill out the paper work. If you don't want to pay a fee to enter Canada, that's cool. Stay home and fish. End of story."
564168,Guest,2007-03-29 11:12:00,0,Very well put Jigman....couldn't have said it better myself.
564170,Guest,2007-03-29 11:30:00,0,"Yes it's their law and of course we have no choice but to abide by it. However, the punishment should fit the crime and to have to keep paying for a crime years afterwards hardly seems fair. The penalties for a DUI conviction are pretty stiff and once ""time is served"" it doesn't seem right to deny an otherwise law abiding citizen a week or two of fishing in the great white north."
564171,Guest,2007-03-29 11:53:00,0,"Another option that apparently works (for a fee) is ""Border Crossing Services"" 1-800-438-7020 www.bordercrossing.ca This is a legal service based in Canada."
564172,Mark R,2007-03-29 12:20:00,1538,"Thats what I'm talking about get out the check book and lets go fishin. Do you think 'W"" used these guys when he visited Canada a few years ago? To think he could be elected president twice and still be refused entry into Canada because of a prior DUI."
564174,Mohleye,2007-03-29 13:07:00,368,"For what it's worth, there was a news story Tuesday on NPR about Canadian Customs refusing entry to Americans with DUI's. Not sure what made it newsworthy at this particular time, but you could infer that maybe enforcement is being increased. So hoping you won't be checked may not be the best plan this year."
564175,Guest,2007-03-29 13:13:00,0,"I am a lodge owner and was at a KDCA (Kenora District Campowners Assoc.) last spring where a presentation was given by senior officers from the Ft. Frances border office. They told the members specifically that ""they were not legally compelled to recognize 'expunged' records."" When given specific examples, the officers responded that each officer has discretion but, ""they personally would deny entry if they came across a DUI within the past 5 years, even if the record had been expunged in the US."" For those that feel that this discussion point has been beaten to death, I will tell you that I continue to be surprised by the variability in ""rule interpretation"" and enforcement. Most reasonable people just want to know what the rules are and how they will be enforced. Simply calling the border will not give you those answers. Sorry there isn't a better way. Mike Willems"
564177,jigman 2003,2007-03-29 13:41:00,981,"not so fast-I can see your point, but you are used to our American legal system. Here, it is all about giving criminals a second chance. That fact is largely due to the fact that there is a lawyer under every damp rock (my apologies to any lawyers out there). It isn't like that in most places. I believe in many European countries your first DUI results in a permanent loss of your driving privileges. To be honest, it makes me sick to think that a guy can kill a family while driving drunk and only get a few years in prison. That same guy could kill the same family with a gun and get life. Both instances the guy used a weapon. Both instances the guy made a choice to do what he did. Don't get me wrong, I like my adult beverages. I just make sure somebody else is doing the driving."
564179,Mark R,2007-03-29 14:08:00,1538,"jigman, I think the difference is the drunk didn't set out to kill a family and the guy with the gun probably did, either way they are dead. Wouldn't the charge then be motor vehicle homicde rather then a misdemeaner DUI for the 1st time offender. Don't get me wrong what starts out not so serious can take a real serious turn if something happens."
564112,jigman 2003,2007-03-26 06:36:00,981,"With the ongoing passport controversy, there is no way I would attempt entry without checking with Canadian customs. Last year, both myself and my passenger were asked for passports or other ID (birth certificate). Fortunately, we both have passports and neither have any criminal records. I think that this year and next, a lot of guys will be getting checked."
564113,rpieske,2007-03-26 06:58:00,1276,Here is a link to a website that will provide you with the latest information on entering Canada. I have found it to be reliable.http://www.infonorth.net/
564121,Guest,2007-03-26 14:21:00,0,"Have been going to Canada for the last seven years and have only been asked to show identification once. My friend had a DUI three years ago and has never had a problem getting across the border. He is a passenger in a vehicle that is pulling a boat. I have been told that your license plate is scanned and recorded each time you cross the border and that if you are consistent in dates of travel from year to year, the less likely you are to encounter problems. Last year we paid duty on the extra beer we brought across and it was the easiest crossing of all of them. I have a list prepared of everything we have and everything we have to pay duty on and read that to them when they have questions. It seems to help. The other thing that we established with our friend is that if he were to get denied, he is responsible for finding a way home from International Falls. He can drive or hitch hike back. One person should not ruin the fishing trip of many. Just my experience. Good luck to all."
564123,Old Critter,2007-03-26 15:29:00,14,"Do not take for granted that if you are not driving you won't be IDed. I've sailed right through and I've been in situations where the agent asked for everyone's driver's license - including those in the back of the van. I make two trips a year and about one in four they'll ask for DLs. We've never had a problem in my groups. However, a friend had his son denied entry because of a DUI. The others in the group proceeded through IF on their trip, but the son's mother had to drive to IF to pick up the kid. Last year, a friend of mine (with a DUI) was on a cruise trip that originated in Seattle and went along the inland passage of BC. On the way back, the ship stopped in Victoria for a couple of days of sightseeing. Canada customs wouldn't allow my friend off the ship. He ate peanut butter sandwiches with a few others while the rest toured Victoria. He doesn't know how customs found out about the DUI."
564129,Guest,2007-03-27 12:08:00,0,"We have been going to Ontario through IF with the same 4 guys in the same vehicle since '93, and the 3 other guys had gone for many years before that, 3 years with the same vehicle (it's a '72 Dodge Class A motor home, but hey, it works for us). In '02 we took a different 4th guy, and who knows why, but they checked our DL's. Of course the new guy had a DUI the previous year in Wis. He filled out some paperwork, paid $200 Canadian, and they let us go thru, but told him to fill out the paperwork & send it in if he wanted to return to Canada in the future. 2 years later, in '04, we brought this guy along again and we went thru IF again. He hadn't filled out the paperwork, didn't even read it, in fact, but thought he would only have to pay another $200 Canadian and get in. WRONG! They checked our DL's again that year, checked out our vehicle as long as we were there, called us into the little building, and proceeded to ream this guy out. When the lecture was finally over and she told us we had to leave Canada or be arrested, the lady went outside, stopped traffic headed south so we could get into the line, and stood and watched us until we were all the way back on the US side of the bridge. Of course, then we had to explain why we were in Canada only about an hour and the US guys searched us again. We ended up having a good time fishing in northern Minnesota that year, but he doesn't go fishing with us anymore. It's a shame, too, because he was an excellent cook. My recommendation is don't take any chances. Fill out the paperwork well in advance. If you have a DUI, don't put your friend's vacation at risk, stay home and spend some time fishing with your kids or something."
564130,Mark R,2007-03-27 13:07:00,1538,Did they say why you all had to go back or was that your choice
564146,kbkakes,2007-03-28 13:40:00,49,"So in other words, In some cases, Ontario does not want Americans with DWI convictions in thier country unless you got the cash? OOPS...double standard."
564151,Guest,2007-03-28 17:00:00,0,"Here's a question I have not seen answered on the dui question.Maybe someone out there is, or knows a lawyer.On the info. site about dui's there is a section saying that""If you received a pardon or expungement for your convition in a country other than Canada, it is possible that you are no longer inadmissible to Cananda.""It says""You should carry the pardon or expungement documents with you when you seek entry into Canada as it is your responsibilty to demonstrate to the officer at the port of entry that all of your convictions have been expunged or pardoned."" SO what exactly does this mean ??? They can, if they so choose let you cross if you have enough paperwork? MY friend who wants to go with us in July recieved a deferred jugement last May on his dui(first and only offense). If he has all his paperwork with him, will they let him cross or not?? Thanks......Eman"
564153,2 DOGS,2007-03-28 18:35:00,361,"It would be my suggestion that you have your friend contact the Canadien Authorities and ask the pertinent questions rather than take the advice of some wannabe attorney on Walleye Central, who watched Boston Legal the other night. That way he will get the straight scoop and nothing is lost by going through other people. Good luck."
564163,Guest,2007-03-29 09:03:00,0,How come there are so many people with DUI's.....maybe that is the better question to answer.
564064,Guest,2007-03-22 17:19:00,0,About 3 years ago I was picked up on a drunken driving charge in the US where I live. Can I still get across the broder into Canada or what do I have to do?

564065,Guest,2007-03-22 17:38:00,0,Seven different people will give you seven different answers on this board. Call the border crossing that you will go to and ask them their advise. You should be able to but you have to pay a fee. Try to communicate with them also via e-mail or fax so that you have some documentation when you get to the border.

564101,Guest,2007-03-24 17:54:00,0,I think these answers assume you are the driver and driving your vehicle. the license plate in this case is the connection. I would think that if you are a passenger in someone elses car it wont be a factor. the last time we were there they did not ask for IDs from anyone. just the usuall questions of where were born etc.
564105,Sutsgold,2007-03-25 09:16:00,219,"DO NOT ASSUME YOU WILL GET IN IF YOU ARE NOT DRIVING! They really dont care who is driving or not. DUI in canada is a felony. I have heard of stories of people being take off of buses and denied entry. Had a friend of mines group get held up last year because a member had a dui. They would not let them in and it put everyone in a position where they had to choose between their fishing buddy and the trip they have been waiting for all year. Do the paperwork, and do not take a chance with other peoples vacations on the line. Best of luck to all."
564107,Guest,2007-03-25 11:41:00,0,My grandaughter has been going to Canada with us for many years. Her boyfriend wanted to go along last year and told me he had a DUI and wanted to know if he could go. I called customs at Fort Francis and told them the situation and they told me he would have to wait 5 years before he could enter Canada. I asked if he could fill out some form and pay for a special permit. Again he told me he would not be allowed to enter.
564110,Springseeker,2007-03-25 22:07:00,96,"I have a buddy who had a criminal record for some minor offence and he was never allowed from Canada into the US. Once he was taken off a cruise ship that docked for 5 hrs in LA and jailed,then deported. It turns out that in Canada after 3 years he could apply for a pardon and clear his record. It took some paperwork but he finally got his pardon. Maybe your gov't has a similar plan? Good luck!"
564111,Guest,2007-03-26 05:54:00,0,"We have been fishing in Canada since 1999, we have had at least one person every year with a DWI along. We have never had an issue but have heard of others at the lodge we stay at say that a member of their group had gotten refused entry. The lodge owner says from his experience, people pulling a boat of their own and not bringing the offenders vehicle seem to crusie right through customs with minimal questioning. Basically probably comes down to what kind of mood your customs agent is in and how busy the border crossing is when you arrive."
