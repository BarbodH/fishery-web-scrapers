This is a nice 27"" eye caught on a 1/4 oz chartreuse jig and minnow....gotta love jiggin big eyes on Seul...even in the winter!http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y58.../Seul07007.jpg There was 36"" of solid ice in most places, some water and slush on top due to warmer temperatures. Should be an early ice out around April 24 if I was to guess. See you on the soft water soon enough! D"

564143,Guest,2007-03-28 10:01:00,0,Its called a toque my friend...a wool knit toque. If you actually went outside in the winter you would have one too.
564147,Guest,2007-03-28 15:04:00,0,How was the fishing? Any numbers or size?
564154,Guest,2007-03-28 20:23:00,0,"""Hi. I'm Bob McKenzie and this is my brother, Doug."" ""How's it goin', eh?"" Once I saw the hat, I just could not stop thinking about toques and my intro to the great white. Two and half months until LS and SWWL and the best week of the year! Destroyer and NWO, you guys crack me up....IA Walleye"

Master Dangler won't be joining us this year so we can get some real fishing in, the big boy will probably come back next year. This will give me an opportunity to chip away at his ""blind luck"" MA list. Mr. 31 and I will be doing a little more fishing together this year."
564162,Guest,2007-03-29 09:02:00,0,"Glad we can amuse you Craig...winters are long up here, nothing else to do but fish and jab at each other. Jigger its probably best you left ""the mouth"" behind this year, I am sure you are sick of hearing him jabber about all the 29's. Mr. 31 is the real deal though, guided to perfection he can bring 'em in with the best of them. Here's a little scene for you too picture... That 27"" I caught last weekend...can you picture it, holding the rod, slowly raising the jig about a foot and half then a slow drop and oh....what was that...it was a little tap and then thump!! There she is..set the hook...ohhhhh its heavy....yup...there are the long slow head shakes...its a good one...a minute goes by, look down the hole and there it is!!!....its a pig eye!!...more head shakes and finally I get it in the hole and hoist it on the ice...whooo....a nice healthy 7 lb walleye, snap a few shots and release the beast to be caught another time. I thought you might want a little reminder of what its like to jig up a nice eye...soon enough my friend...soon enough. I hope you guys have a good trip....will never quite be as good as the year with me, the bum, and chris...that was magic. D"
