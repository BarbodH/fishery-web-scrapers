I would appreciate it if anyone could forward me some pictures from Lac Seul: big fish, wild game,scenery, fun times, etc to my email which I could use to support my case. Thanks in advance. Email address is [email protected]"

For the last seven years, we have been going to LS, all in the central part of the lake. There are fewer resorts in the central zone than in either end. First and foremost, there is and can be great fishing in virtually all the lakes of NWO. Some lakes are better than others, some have different fish species, and some have different seasonalities. Likewise, all can be poor for some period of time, depending on the weather, and that is true for LS as well. What I have found in LS and why we have been back ever year for 7 years now is (a) more consistant walleye fishing and (b) generally larger fish more numerous than in other lakes I have fished. The pike fishing is not as good as many lakes I previously fished, but in fairness, I spend virtually no time targeting them. We have caught very nice pike in LS, and perhaps we would do better if we tried for them. The biggest issue with pike on a big water like LS is that I think to really target them, you need to be there in the early spring when the big pike are still in the back bays attracted to the warm water. Post those few weeks in May, the big girls largely head to the open and deeper water. The little pike remain in the weedbeds, but I personally believe that the big pike (and they have to be there) in LS are an open water fish relating to the reefs and sandbars that can be found in the main body of the lake. In the cental part of the lake there are no muskies, so I cannot comment on them. The walleye fishing is simply great and I have experienced several of those legendary 100+ fish days. Last year, after dinner, I and my two fishing buddies, caught nearly 100 walleyes after dinner. Nothing huge, but a school of 12 - 20"" walleyes must have been parked under our boat, because no jig every got to the bottom without a hit. Over the years, our biggest walleye is a 31 1/4 mamma caught by my son. I have personally not broke the 30"" barrier yet, but have gotten several 29's. There are plenty of very big walleyes in the LS system. In the central part of the lake, the smallmouth fishing is becoming very good. I understand its even better in the easter end where the bass have been established for a longer time. I have lots of pictures to share, but none are digitized (this year will be my first for a digital camera). If you go to the Silver Water Wheel website you can see pictures from their guides and I am sure the other resorts on the lake also post fish pictures. I am not associated with any lodge, just a paying guest. I love the lake because big water tends to product bigger fish and more of them, and where we go, non-resort boats are pretty rare. Thus you get a bit of that feeling your on a lake by yourself. I have only stayed at one resort on LS, but given that we have returned year after year, you can tell I am very satisfied with that resort. NWO has lots of great lakes and lots of great resorts. LS is one of those great lakes, and if anybody needs to be convinced to spend time in God's country, they may not be the kind of fishing partner who would be happy on the lake. LS, like all lakes, will have its bad days when the fish shut down due to weather or other issues. If person really did not want to be on the lake during these times, then they may become a bit of whiner when they happen. A couple of years ago on LS, we had a day when it was really tough. We worked at it very hard, but did not have our typical day. If somebody was new to LS that day, they would not have been impressed. By the next day, the fish were in a better mood and we had figured out a different presentation they wanted and life was great again. Point is, fishing partners should be happy on the bad days too, because there will be slow days. Not sure if this is what your looking for, but good luck with your decision. IA Walleye"
