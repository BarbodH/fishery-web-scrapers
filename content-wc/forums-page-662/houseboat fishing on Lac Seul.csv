564104,5richards,2007-03-25 07:59:00,131,Has anyone had any experience renting a houseboat to fish on Lac Seul? I would appreciate any information you have -- Am interested in --of course eyes but also pike -- any suggestions with respect to location - rentals - time of year - problems etc. Look forward to any and all comments! thanks

Did not really like that the houseboat had to stay in one place. We brought along three boats of our own. To get fuel every day we had to pump it out of the same tank that the houseboat runs on. We ended up useing to much fuel so there wasn't enough to get the houseboat back to camp. It was in a good area for fishing, our group had five eyes over 29"" on a seven day trip."

564189,lrpetp,2007-03-30 08:03:00,37,We have been using Whitewing for over 15 yrs. and find that it is a very enjoyable way to fish. You may not be able to move the houseboat but why would you want to? The houseboat is parked at the mouth of Altimeter and Manitou which is one of the best fishing areas of Lac Seul. I have oserved guide boats from lodges which will travel long distances and hours to fish this area and you are only minutes away from the houseboat. Where I come from five fish over 29 inches in seven days is pretty good.
564190,Guest,2007-03-30 08:46:00,0,"They do park the houseboat near altimiter creek. Yes I do agree that it is a very good area to fish. We have some other areas we like to fish, it would have been nice to park at.I would say the experience is comparable to staying at an outpost cabin. One thing that bugged me a little is they park the two houseboats 100'apart, you take the houseboat 30 miles to get away then park right next to someone once you get there."
564192,JDP,2007-03-30 11:04:00,1457,I believe there is an agreement or some type of regulation on where their houseboats can be parked. The only spot I have seen WWL houseboats parked is at Altimter/Manitou creeks. Perhaps someone else can fill in the details on the houseboat parking locations. I agree to travel that far and then have another houseboat is not deiserable.
