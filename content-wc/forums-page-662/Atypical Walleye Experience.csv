I had even fished the lake the week before, and had the best fishing I've experienced on that lake to date. This is your typical Canadian shield lake, with structure depths ranging from 65 to 14 ft. The weather had changed, cooling down somewhat, but not to the point that it should have turned fishing off all together. Upon arriving at one of the traditional spots, I marked, what I thought and still think, was clouds and clouds of suspended bait fish. We fished hard and long, changed presentations and ended the day with one, small walleye out of 25 feet of water. I had been catching them in 20 to 14 ft all summer long. Any ideas on what happened?"
564292,Guest,2007-04-04 17:36:00,0,you forgot to bait your jigs???????
564293,Guest,2007-04-04 17:39:00,0,someone removed the hooks off your jigs????
564294,Tripper,2007-04-04 18:35:00,9,"I'm gonna take a stab at this one. When you say fall, exactly how late in the fall? If it was post turnover then almost certainly a lot of the fish in your lake were likely a lot deeper than you'd ever imagine. I've got a water access cabin on a large lake east of Kirkland Lake in N/E Ontario that sounds pretty similar to the lake you describe. When turnover occurs on my lake the walleye seem to really bunch up on large, deep sand and mud flats in the 40-55' range. They havn't stopped feeding....drift over them snapping a heavy jig and minnow just off the bottom and we catch lots, perhaps some of the best fishing of the year. I don't do a lot of it unless I'm meat hunting however because of the high mortality rate involved in dredging them up from those depths. As far as the supposed clouds of baifish go, of course it's entirely possible you're correct, but my guess is you mis-read your graph. I've always found that shortly after fall turnover there's a ton of detritus and miscellaneous crud suspended from top to bottom. For those not familiar with the phenomenon it can be pretty frustrating as their graph appears to be loaded with fish."
