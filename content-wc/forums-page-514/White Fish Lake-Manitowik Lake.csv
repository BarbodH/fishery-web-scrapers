It was our groups 8th year fishing from Totomenai Lodge, so we have seen the lakes at all different water levels in many types of weather. There is no question, that this lake is a very tough lake to fish. It is big and deep. The dam is repaired so the water levels are somewhat more predictable. We have seen water levels change as much as 3 feet in a week in May. During dam repair, the water level was 25-30 below normal pool. So how was the fishing? The four of us caught 202 fish in 4 1/2 days of fishing. We caught our limit of walleye by Monday evening and ate smallies for breakfast every morning. A total of two pike were caught, one when fishing for smallies. The lakers were down deep, 60 feet plus and we did not fish for them. A major storm hit the lake on Wednesday morning and another on Thursday afternoon. All fishing then went to a shutdown mode. The walleyes disappeared from their normal locations. We still caught a few smallies. Leeches are the king of the baits at White Fish/Manitowik. I have only caught maybe three walleyes on lures in eight years. Again, Totomenai Lodge's service was outstanding. A very clean cabin with comfortable beds is the norm every year. The food was first rate since they redid the chicken dinner. The homemade pie was again the best. Boats and motors were in great shape with no problems. Fish were cleaned and packed perfectly for transport across the border."

We caught a lot of walleye during our week there. This lake is mainly a live bait lake. Most of our walleye/smallmouth were caught on leeches as well and the remainder on worms or minnows. However the average size of Walleye was quite small (around 1 pound). The largest one we caught between 3 people was 4 pounds. There were also plenty of Pike but nothing bigger than 30 inches. We stayed at Hidden River Lodge. Found the service ok. Had to ask for a lot of things like a bbq,life jackets..owners were busy servicing their buddies that came up from Michigan. Overall, it was ok. If you want numbers, Whitefish Lake/Manitowik is the place to go. Thanks to all for their help."

We are staying at a place called Hidden River Lodge East of Wawa near Hawk Junction. Anyone been to this resort? Hows the fishing on these lakes? Heard there are lots of small pickerel and pike. Not many lunkers in there? Also heard pike only go for live bait. Looking forward to this and any help is appreciated. Rgds"

566424,Guest,2007-06-19 10:48:00,0,"My group and I was just up there, Whitefish Lake and the Magpie River, and the fishing was terrible. After we fished for about four days, with very few catches, we were being told that there were wildlife biologists on TV talking about something being strange(lack of fish being caught)in the whole region, and they were looking into it. My group and I have been going for nearly ten years now, some of them longer, and never saw anything like it. We came home two days early, and believe me, that's not something we take lightly. I hope you have better luck. Let us know."

566550,budfox,2007-06-20 10:35:00,11,Is it the lack of fish or the fact the lake is big and deep? What time of the year did you guys go?
