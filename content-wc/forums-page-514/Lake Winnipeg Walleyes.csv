1236989,manitobawalleye,2010-09-21 04:57:00,885,You should check with members of the Fargo Morehead Walleyes Unlimited Club. A lot of their members come up and fish.
1225015,Blackwatercats,2010-08-04 08:48:00,23,"a 20lber is pretty much a guarantee, I hope you get a 30lber. The cats are feeding themselves plump. we are catchiung small 32 inchers that are so stuffed and thick they feel like they could be in the mid 20's. Good Luck out there.So where's my invite Roger?"
1225022,manitobawalleye,2010-08-04 09:06:00,885,there is a launch in winnipeg beach there is also one at balsam bay harbour on the east side...not far from the casino
1225024,manitobawalleye,2010-08-04 09:11:00,885,you are to busy with your favorite fish Donovan.... we will see when it gets closer to the date...
1225227,cbprov,2010-08-04 21:57:00,1010,iam int too let me know dates Chris
1225465,manitobawalleye,2010-08-05 21:55:00,885,last weekend in august...i will talk to you next week
1226735,fishncamp,2010-08-10 20:13:00,49,I agree to wait until late september......the south basin can be spectacular at that time. As mentioned earlier the wind can change everything in a hurry. Cranks and side planers...have fun and play safe!
1227986,I Fish GS,2010-08-15 18:05:00,290,"Only made it out on the big lake one evening for 3hrs. I had planned on go in out end of last week but rain and kept me off lake. I went out of Winnipeg Beach out in to 25-28' of water pulled spinners, and cranks didn't get any bits. I did mark a lot of fish all over on bottom, suspended any were up to 10' down wish something would have bit so I could see what they were. Will have to make another trip. Did get out on Red for 2 days many 18-20lbs cat with biggest being 26lbs 11oz. Brian"
1235718,I Fish GS,2010-09-14 21:19:00,290,"I'm getting the itch to come back up to try for walleyes. We have had a lot of rain down here on the RED with it getting high, so much for fall walleye here on the river. Will this run off affect the fishing in the south side of Lake Winnipeg? Brian"
1235905,Blackwatercats,2010-09-15 20:10:00,23,Some gates at the dam are open right now. The water is ripping and very dirty. We trolled up a 23incher near the mouth and some other guys are reporting greens being caught but If it is going to be like this up untill draw down I am heading to pine falls. They are catching good numbers there already.
1236901,poolguy,2010-09-20 18:56:00,1,anybody from fargo area going to pine falls? all of my regular group either didnt get there passport or just cant go. anyone interested email me. i have a boat and a truck to get there just need a fishing partner.
1222729,Danny61,2010-07-27 08:19:00,42,Im in Roger if you need another boat I would really like to find a good pattern on the southern basin for july and august.
1222918,manitobawalleye,2010-07-27 17:50:00,885,"OK Danny....we will wait and see what Leonard says. I know a local that would probably be in as well as 1 or 2 WAAM members. But the weekend mentioned is the only one I can make it. Very busy fishing LOTW in August. I have sidescan, snap weights, big blades, lots of cranks, Lake Winnipeg C-map and planer boards Ed. Ed sounds excited enough to come up for a trip and fore-go his beloved catfish."
1222995,avidangler,2010-07-27 22:13:00,3,I stand corrected as to the commercial season in summer ending(thx) but the point is that the commercial guys do catch walleyes during the summer fishing season in the south basin.Therefore so should anglers be able to
1222999,Blackwatercats,2010-07-28 00:12:00,23,"The south basin is a huge area and I guess I may have spoke prematurely. I consider the south bain as the 3 - 4 miles north x 15 miles across where we do the bulk of our ice fishing for greenbacks even thought that is just a fraction of the south basin.If you were to head out 10, 15, 20 miles or more north from the mouth into water where you may find 30 - 40 feet depths and cleaner water then no dought you could find eyes, but what size and how many? I don't know what the entire south basin looks like as far as water clarity in the summer but my thought is if it all gets dirty why would the eyes not keep moving north away from the cloudy dirty water?What size boat would you need to safely go out in that water? can't see a 20 footer being even close to big enough?"
1223063,Danny61,2010-07-28 09:00:00,42,"I launched out of winnipeg beach last sunday water was real dirty caught a ton of white bass and drum but no walleyes not that my jig and minnow could even sit on the bottom for longer than 3 minutes before it was pounded by a bass or drum. I tried cranks #5 pearls and the white bass just hammered it every time i got it out, if I get out this Sunday I will head way out to the middle of the basin as long as the wind is down. usually you can get out on calm water first thing in the morning."
1223106,manitobawalleye,2010-07-28 11:10:00,885,have you tried inline or snap weights in front of big blades on gulp harnesses.....
1223305,Bandit,2010-07-29 04:42:00,140,If we can put this together in August count me in Roger
1223548,manitobawalleye,2010-07-29 18:16:00,885,Ok Leonard and Danny ....pm me your phone numbers and we will talk in a couple of weeks.... after AYA Championships on the 14th weekend....
1224869,I Fish GS,2010-08-03 19:14:00,290,"Thanks for all the info. I will be up there starting 8-7 to the 12th. will be staying in Winnipeg Beach the 11th and 12th. Is there a boat launch on the southeast side of the lake I will be at the casino. I have a 21' Ranger I think that will handle the Big Lake and I'm taking the whole family with so I can have more rods out. I just fished the Grand Forks Cats Incredible tournament, didn't catch a cat over 11lbs but still managed a 33th place finish. So I will have to go to the Red to see if I can still catch a 20 pounder. Brian"

1221611,Blackwatercats,2010-07-22 16:50:00,23,"I see your point Jim, however I think of the end of march at the end of ice season up here in manitoba. The bite is crazy....untill...the dirty water starts flowing and the bite disapears, drill a hole, find dirty water, move and find clean. In the summer the south basin is pretty dirty. Add wave action to futher cloud up the shallow sand mud bottom. They call them Greenbacks because of their emerald green coloring they get from the limestone in the north basin....where they spend their summers. If the majority are in the north basin how do you catch them in the south baisn? I hope I am wrong and someone does fighure it out, i just don't believe there are any big schools of large walleye in the south basin in summer with the exception of a few stragglers.I wish anyone heading up goodluck but please be safe, many boats and lives have been lost to that lake."
1221662,Bandit,2010-07-22 19:47:00,140,Thankyou Jim
1221680,manitobawalleye,2010-07-22 21:20:00,885,"the way to do it would to have 10-20 guys sharing gps spots and keeping track of movements..... just like some of the early great lakes salmon charter captains you would need some big fast boats for safety sake.... but if you have ever fished pinefalls in the fall, which i am sure you have.... you have seen what could happen when the wind blows..... the lake can become unfishable and dangerous in a hurry..... people have told me that it gets worse than erie..... Bandit and I have fairly big boats and there are many days when i am not headed out there... I have fished the lake in open water south of hecla island in the summer...... another thing that would help is multiple rods..... 1 rod a person is not the best way to get a wide spread out.....and try to sort out a program.... bring your boat up here Jim, and you and I and Bandit will go for a spin..... will even bring Ferris along for an extra stick...."
1221910,Bandit,2010-07-23 17:45:00,140,Sounds Good Roger
1221914,I Fish GS,2010-07-23 17:56:00,290,Jim I was up there when you were ice fishing can't wait for the ice. Just like Erie the fish move long distance but not all the fish move. Where do the commercial boats from Gimli fish do they go to the N basin? Thanks for all the input. Brian
1221981,Backwater Eddy,2010-07-24 06:54:00,3871,"4 anglers in a well rigged large water walleye boat..(Sidescan would be very useful for example)....In fair winds weather, fallowing several days of strong North winds in mid to late September........running a wide spread of plainer boards with a mix of cranks and spinners.....would find amazing things on the South Basin of Lake Winnipeg. 3 crews of 4 in each boat, working in unison, and sharing info openly, all the better. I'm confidant of this."
1221991,manitobawalleye,2010-07-24 07:19:00,885,"in september you would find them for sure Ed as they would be started to head to the red...... july and august would be the tougher months.... i have checked the south end of hecla area in august....combined with scouting ice spots... in june there are lots of fish headed up and along the east shore.... the main shiner spawn seems based more on the east side... that is why manigotogan can have a very hot beach bite..... the problem we have here is most guys with big boats are taking advantage of lake of the woods and other bodies of water or away fishing various tournaments .....it is hard scratching up enough guys to get together on the same weekend....you could even plan an outing for 4 boats and have to cancel that morning because of the winds....not many guys even commit to it because of this issue..... leonard,the only weekend i might possibly have open for a day trip is august 25 weekend.... winnipeg beach launch?"
1222331,avidangler,2010-07-25 23:11:00,3,I am sure the commercial fishermen are netting walleyes in the south basin as we speak.Pretty hard to believe all the walleyes head to the north basin for the summer .Isnt Gimli fish selling fresh walleyes in their stores ? Isnt Gimli in the south basin ? Price would be sky high if Gimli had to pay for the gas to get to the north basin lol
1222641,manitobawalleye,2010-07-26 21:03:00,885,the season usually ends at the end of june..... the FFMC in Selkirk is not operating right now.
1222693,Backwater Eddy,2010-07-27 06:41:00,3871,"I agree with Manatobawalleye's plan, and would add....sidescan would reveal a lot of info now left unknown out there.Basin movements may be there in the summer on the South Basin, and they may be high ridding or even suspended fish..I suspect suspended...but...who knows? As found on large basins like Lake Erie, they found he fish move wide around boats and the boards were key to tuning in the presentation. I suspect this may be true on the big lake as well. I seen aerial photos of schools of walleye on Erie 1/4 mile wide, spitting in two around a boat trolling through them....that photo told me a lot about walleyes on shallow basins.The new sidescan imagery options now out along with a lot of water time would surely spot large herds of greenbacks on the prowl..if they are indeed there.Trust me, it will cause you sleepless nights if you think on it too much."
1220265,I Fish GS,2010-07-18 10:04:00,290,Andy one fish walleye on Lake Winnipeg in the summer. I have fished it in the winter. I have looked at Satellite shots and the water looks dirty. Will be up there on Red catfishing thinking of trying the big lake if the weather is right. Brian
1220362,Blackwatercats,2010-07-18 16:39:00,23,don't waste your time...enjoy the cats they are going good right now. the eyes are far north
1220469,manitobawalleye,2010-07-18 22:06:00,885,"there are some local south basin fish..... not a very consistent bite however, and they can move around a lot with the wind... lately they have been catching a few a mile off shore from winnipeg beach and north to gimli.... mostly just eater size fish....not really a trophy fish bite...."
1220509,Bandit,2010-07-19 06:19:00,140,Yes the local camp owners troll the beach after the wind has pounded the shoreline and catch a few good fish. Very tuff to try and plan a fishing trip around the Big Lake wind patterns.
1220737,I Fish GS,2010-07-19 17:24:00,290,Thanks for the info. I will be up there for a week in Aug. Going to do some catfishing if weather is nice would like to give lake a serious try plan on trying spinners and cranks. I fish Lake of the Woods think it might be the same. I have also caught catfish while pulling spinners on Green Bay for walleye. Thanks agian Brian
1220741,I Fish GS,2010-07-19 17:57:00,290,Any good places to stay on the west side of lake? I stayed at the Hamiton House when I was up ice fishing it was ok. Brian
1220952,Bigfishhunter,2010-07-20 12:24:00,803,"I Fish, listen to blackwater and manitobawalleye, the fish in Lake Wpg migrate heavily. The reason that you do well in the winter is that the fish that reside in the north end of the lake (long long way) move south. Right now those fish, which are mostly the trophies everyone is used to, are up at the north basin. Lake Wpg is nothing like LOTW, it is a big shallow bowl, LOTW is a shield lake with lot's of structure and diversity and full of fish. The catfish fishing is out of this world in Wpg, enjoy it."
1221085,Bandit,2010-07-20 19:55:00,140,( I Fish ) Is comparing LOTW South Basin to Lake Winnipeg. LOTW South Basin with the Rainy River running in is Very Similar. I have fished both for over 30 years. I have friends that have cabins on Lake Winnipeg South Basin and they catch fish all year when the weather is right ( They call it the Beach Bite )
1221415,Blackwatercats,2010-07-22 01:27:00,23,manitobawalleye and myself are in the same walleye club here in winnipeg. we spend a great deal of time slamming high numbers of big fish all winter on the south basin of lake wpg. There are a few reasons why none of us even attept it in the summer. I will leave it at that rather than going into details.you can decide if you want to throw away a full day of your vaction time. I will say this if you do it and find the needle in the hay stack...go buy a lottery ticket when you get home...lol Have a great vacation!
1221530,Jim Carroll,2010-07-22 12:42:00,1665,"There are giant schools of fish in that lake obviously, and they are not scattered out in unfishable concentrations. The issue is access and safety. I believe in the next 10 years that somebody will crack the code on Lake Winnipeg in the summer, and that it will become more commonplace to go fishing for walleye during those months out in open water, just like we do on the Great Lakes. Just like the south basin ice bite was discovered, who did that 10 years ago? Not many... I know if I lived up there what I'd be doing. Jim Carroll NPAA #13"
