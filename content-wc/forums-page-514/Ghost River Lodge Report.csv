Size was smaller than we normally have caught, fewer in the 18-21"" range but lots of fish in the 14-17 range. The largest was 25 1/2"" and we numerous22 and 23' fish. I had the largest walleye on I believe I have ever had on a line and unfortunately was not able to even get a look at it, that was on Singapore Lake. Walleyes were caught in 12-30' and on jig and a minnow, what else is there? The weather was good, cool and some wind but only one day of rain and wind. Can't complain about that. My son and I estimated we caught 300-350 walleyes over 5 days. We drove right up to the window going in and had to wait at IF for 25 minutes coming out, we crossed into Canada ona Sat. and came out on a Friday. I have been into Canada 20 plus times and was asked questions both entering and returning I have never been asked before. We had an excellent trip and the service Darrel and Don gave was excellent as usual."

They like the treatment they receive there too! I would like to give it a try one day, but my boat/cabin buddy likes the Ear Falls area of LS! Andrea at Goose Bay has always been good to our group! I taking a new guy with us next year to the Goose, maybe we can try Ghost River one of these days!"

1239578,Guest,2010-09-30 15:45:00,0,Was there a year ago. Great people! Fishing was rough because the weather was rough. I wish they had 25hp motors - would allow for more fishing and more exploring. I think that lake has a lot of potential. I would go there every year then.
