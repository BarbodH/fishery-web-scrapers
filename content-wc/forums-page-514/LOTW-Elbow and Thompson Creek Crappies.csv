1236145,1700SS,2010-09-16 21:33:00,104,"Justin and Jared are correct, those are the temps I have been seein. Bill, good luck and talk at u next year, U should not have a problem finding them. I could not find them in schools up at Thompson Creek just like Dick said. But if u put ur time in u will get ur limit, up to 14"" is what we had. CYA next year. I did Muskie fish a couple of days.Brett"
1236671,PJM,2010-09-19 21:57:00,3516,With the water level in that channel right now and you went though with a big boat your lower unit would be toast. Are you sure they were going into the Obabikon
1236843,Obabikon,2010-09-20 15:16:00,2370,Saving 20 seconds isn't worth the risk. Slow down when you go through the narrows. Stay all the way over to the west side.
1235130,1700SS,2010-09-12 14:57:00,104,"Bill,Been blowing 20mph gusting to 40 since we got here on Friday. Went up to the Elbow to get out of the wind today and had 4 man limit in 3 hours. They are going. Talk to you later, I have fish to clean.Brett"
1235202,Bill Krejca,2010-09-12 19:52:00,6107,Attaboy! Bill
1235226,Obabikon,2010-09-12 21:27:00,2370,"The word is out... even with all the wind, there's been a ton of traffic by the camp headed that direction. We've been catching some big ones... nothing much in the big lake though."
1235294,congo,2010-09-13 08:31:00,42,Good Job Brett! Wish I was there.
1235298,Shorelunch,2010-09-13 08:44:00,554,Do you guys have a set path going through the channel heading into Obakikon? I put-put through and stay to the west side and hug the big rock. But I've seen pretty big boats going through on plane too. We were up there last weekend and did OK. Back up this weekend.
1235369,Obabikon,2010-09-13 12:07:00,2370,"I was up there musky fishing past the elbow, and there must've been 10 boats (which is a ton for a Monday). Next weekend, I'd be suprised if there weren't 20+."
1235978,J-Man,2010-09-16 09:04:00,191,Dick Moore reported crappies biting up in Miles 9/15. They got their 30 crappies in 3 hours. They werent school up yet. Caught them dragging crappie rigs on the bottom with minnows.
1236004,Bill Krejca,2010-09-16 11:27:00,6107,"Thanks for the report, Justin! That water temp has got to be dropping. Bill"
1236044,J-Man,2010-09-16 13:49:00,191,57-58 reported from most everyone..a few casters saw 60 in some bays...another frost last night and some high 30s for lows over the weekend. might get a little early muskie trolling done this year!
1236110,Obabikon,2010-09-16 18:42:00,2370,i've seen 59-60 casting the past 3 days.
1233517,Ia Walihntr,2010-09-06 15:20:00,320,Red Tail You have a PM Marv
1233835,1700SS,2010-09-07 16:50:00,104,"Bill, one of these years we will get together. I will be on the water Friday afternoon (9/10), can't wait. I will try to give a couple reports here as the week goes on. I will be taking my lap top. Take care."
1234282,Bill Krejca,2010-09-09 06:19:00,6107,"Good luck, can't wait for the reports. Mark an ""X"" on the side of your boat where you get 'em. Bill Krejca"
1234306,J-Man,2010-09-09 07:20:00,191,"Had a couple guys run up to the Elbow and didnt get a sniff. Hit a spot in Miles and caught 8 in an hour, then nothing after that in another hour or trying a few other spots.This was Wed (09/08.)"
1234436,Bill Krejca,2010-09-09 14:54:00,6107,"This seems a bit unusual for this time of the year, I would have expected some fairly good reports to be coming in by now. Last year, the late bite was attributed, at least by me, to the late very warm water temperatures. What do you feel is holding up the bite this year? Crappie population down cycle, or other? Bill Krejca"
1234472,1shooter,2010-09-09 17:03:00,1493,I think the cold front that came through late last week put a damper on them. Even the walleyes where a little slow.
1234519,J-Man,2010-09-09 19:15:00,191,"Reports of water temps in the 62-64 range from a guest this evening. My opinion, based purely on second hand observations and reports (i haven't actually fished crappies in lord knows how long!) is that the water temps might be a bit high yet. One of our biggest groups that normally does very well on crappies have told us over the years that they do the best when the water temps are 55ish during their trip the third week of September. Would agree with Shooter about this weekend's MAJOR cold front having a negative effect on all fish activity for awhile. Reports the last two years seemed to trend towards smaller windows. It could have been morning, afternoon or towards evening..but when the bite turned on, it was like old times for a few hours each day. Everyone got their crappies, but it took a little more work than it used to. That isn't necessarily a bad thing either. Don't want it to be too easy right?"
1234599,Bill Krejca,2010-09-10 07:05:00,6107,Don't want it to be too easy right?[/QUOTE] Right....unless I'm there. Bill Krejca
1234724,J-Man,2010-09-10 16:00:00,191,Had a couple second and third hand reports of some crappie success in OB over the Labour Day weekend. Was told by both sources that the fish were active biting in 17-20 feet near the Elbow.
1234738,1shooter,2010-09-10 16:41:00,1493,I went through there and saw about 10 boats in the elbow. We didnt stop to try for any but there was boats there.
1233131,1700SS,2010-09-04 11:07:00,104,Jared any reports as of yet on the crappies. I will be up next Friday thru the 18th. Is water high enough to get into Obabikon? Bill are you out there? You going up also?Brett
1233132,J-Man,2010-09-04 11:19:00,191,"Haven't had anyone coming or going through that said they were up after crappies. Talked to some people this morning that said they may give them a try this weekend. Water level for OB is not an issue. It will be about 10 days before we have people really chasing them, but should here some reports from others in the area before that."
1233140,Ia Walihntr,2010-09-04 12:36:00,320,"Justin, See you Sat. the 18th. Can't wait. Bet the west point of your bay has some crappie action already being right next to a wintering hole. Marv"
1233146,Bill Krejca,2010-09-04 13:16:00,6107,"Brett, Looks like we will miss each other again. I am heading up the 17th, will be in camp at Young's on the 18th. This year, my son Nate, and our pal Jared (""got a ... of a lot to learn"") will be coming up with me, for a total of 7 guys. Nate wants to revisit some of our old camping spots. My guess is that this should be a more normal year in terms of the cooler water congregating the crappies. I also expect the leaves will be displaying their normal fall colors - I really missed that last year....it isn't just the fish we go after. Water level looks to be OK for entry into Obabikon, does anyone know the present surface temperature? Good luck, Brett, give us a report when you get back, I'll do the same. Bill Krejca"
1233177,Ia Walihntr,2010-09-04 16:52:00,320,"Bill, Will be at Mylies Place Resort near Hansons Bay starting the 18th. Also hope the fall colors are starting. Check out this website: http://www.myliesplaceresort.com Then Click on: ""Current news, fishing reports, & discussions"". Justin Gaudry handles the LOTW board for Morson area, Just as Thatcher from Duck Bay Lodge does for the eastern part of Sabaskong Bay. Justin tracks the water temps and it will be posted on one of the links."
1233220,Bill Krejca,2010-09-04 20:50:00,6107,"Thanks, Ia W. It looks like 66* on Friday, its going in the right direction! Mylies was one of the places that I left my vehicle back when I use to camp in Obabikon in the 80's/90's. It is pretty much a straight shot north between the islands, heading for Obab. I plan on several crappie trips from Stevens Bay to Obab during the week, stop over and say hello if you see me. I have a 20' red Alaskan with a F115 Yamaha and T-8. If we're fishing, I'll be the guy in the front with the big grin on his face. Bill Krejca"
1233230,Obabikon,2010-09-04 23:09:00,2370,"None yet. Maybe starting the patterns... it's been a tough year for crappies, so it'll be interesting to see how the fall goes."
1233284,Ia Walihntr,2010-09-05 10:37:00,320,"Bill, Used to work for ADM in Cedar Rapids before I was transferred to Clinton. I and my wife will be in a gray and white Alumacraft Tournament Pro 170 tiller. I may not hit Obabikon for crappies but will hit the hole south of Hay Island and a few other wintering spots. I'll be looking for you. Marv"
1233475,Bill Krejca,2010-09-06 11:48:00,6107,"Marv, I spend some time south of Hay Island, too, maybe we'll see you there. Bill Krejca"
1233505,Red Tail Chub,2010-09-06 14:21:00,17,Not going to Spruce Island Camp anymore? How come? Just wondering because we go there.
