1239762,BCKevo,2010-10-01 15:04:00,6,We have found a bait that works for us. Unfortunately it has been hard to get locally in BC. Can anyone help with where I can find sources online that ship to canada. I have tried cabelas and wholesale sports but neither have the specific bait i am looking for. If you know of any online shops that could help I would appreciate your assistance.BCKEVO
