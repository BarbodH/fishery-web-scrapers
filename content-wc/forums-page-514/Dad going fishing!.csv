1239369,Fishin Fun,2010-09-29 18:43:00,218,Hope you have a great time. My dad brought me fishing for many years up to Canada. Unfortunately he died of a heart attack in 2002 at 54 years of age. I have so many great memories of my times fishing with him that make me smile and laugh. I can't wait to start taking my 2 boys up there with me. I hope they love it as much as I do. Cherish these times with your dad. Great times! I'm jealous.

It is one of the best things we have ever done. We have made so many memories over the years, and plan on going as long as God let's us. Here are a few pics of my Dad."
1239435,fishforlife,2010-09-29 23:55:00,77,"You left me in 1993, but as we planned, I have packed your gear for you each year as the group leaves for the far north. Each time we catch and release a fish I know you hear me say, Dad, this one's for you. Each time your grandsons say they wished you were here, all I can tell them, with a tear in my eye, is you are. I am all that I am because of you. With all my love,Your son RobTake your kids fishing, and they'll love you beyond death."
1239467,wildduck223,2010-09-30 07:31:00,38,"Thanks all! I need to work on my son to go also. He did go 3 years with me, but never with grandpa. I'm hoping to get him to come next years. That would be great to have 3 generation in the same boat."
1239475,tv4fish,2010-09-30 08:00:00,2694,"Yes, it is. We have done it here in Minnesota a few times -- Doggone Grandson is sooo competitive - he keeps track of who catches the most fish - AND you know who that ends up being (like THEY say --- Kids and fools )"
1239210,wildduck223,2010-09-29 10:37:00,38,"It been 15 years since dad went fishing with me in Canada. He was unable to go because of health issue, two hip replacement. Now that he's feeling better, he wanted to go again.I thanks the lord for this. We will be doing two week next year. I got my dad back, the new memory of him and I fishing again is PRICELESS . Dad is 80 years old also."
1239221,tv4fish,2010-09-29 11:02:00,2694,"Congrats I'm going the ""other way"" I'm wanting to take my Grandson up to Canada with me ! I have taken my Son on one trip already (about 10 years ago) and now I'm hoping my Grandson, who is 13, won't be bored with a fishing trip (since you know how this younger generation is with their computers, Ipods, etc.). Plus, where we go, it's a fairly LONG boatride. Nonetheless, we have tentative plans for next year. After all, I have to show my Son and Grandson how to get to our hotspots before I forget how to get to them !!!"
1239244,rebs,2010-09-29 12:22:00,7587,"That is wonderful, you must be a good son and I bet your Dad is very proud of youHave a great time and don't forget the camera, I would like to see fish pic's and the big smiles on both your faces"
1239255,dave10,2010-09-29 12:37:00,342,"It's great that you have the chance. My dad died suddenly at age 61, almost twenty years ago, before he got to see me and his grandsons develop into better fishermen. I can't help but think of how much he'd enjoy going out with us if he was still around. Cherish every minute of your trip. Dave"
1239266,Juls,2010-09-29 12:50:00,13414,I'll second that! Have a great time!Juls
1239285,wildduck223,2010-09-29 13:55:00,38,"I will enjoyed having my dad. Yes, I""ll have movie and picture of him catching fish next year. I can still remmeber taking a left turn off Hwy 502 before Dryden in the RV, pulling boat . The road started out being black top, then dirt road to mud hole before Hwy11. He thought I was lost, so did I, but never told him I didn't know where the heck I was. We still laugh about that trip, never did it again."
1239317,Guest,2010-09-29 15:40:00,0,"Take them while you can cause you never know when that last trip will be for the two of you together. Took my Dad many years ago and then he had a heart attack. He never wanted to go back after that cause he thought he would ruin the trip for everyone if something were to happened to him while we were there. Couldn't talk him into to ever again. This past year had the pleasure of being in camp next to a Grandpa, son and grandson and they had a blast. I think I enjoyed it as much listening to there stories after each days fishing. The grandson caught the biggest walleye and northern of their group and was he ever excited. I sure hope the three of them have many more trips like it. Life is short so take advantage of the moment!!!!"
1239340,Wall-i-Lama,2010-09-29 17:42:00,1524,"Took my dad this year for a week on LOTW. He is 82 and doing very well. First day, he struggled to hook up on the walleye that were biting lite. I kept telling him ""how to do it"", but it didn't seem to help. He never said a word. By day 7, I was asking HIM how he could sit there in the same boat , use the same type line, rod, reel, jig and bait and out fish us 3 to 1. The ole man taught us all how to fish!Enjoy the trip with your dad!"
1239347,Bill Krejca,2010-09-29 18:07:00,6107,"Dad's last trip was when he was 92. We camped on an island on LOW. I know he appreciated it, although he said it wasn't as much fun as when he was younger, like when he was in his 80's. Bill"
1239363,wallydave,2010-09-29 18:39:00,2151,"Well done Duck! With my dad it was golf, he is gone now, and I have taken my son on a son/dad trip to Lac Seul. Have a great trip!"
