Not a typo that business employs a lot of people.Cheers Warren"
1237026,lonewolf73,2010-09-21 07:24:00,17,"Village Corner has always been one of our stops for food, gas, coffee, etc. on our annual trip to Cedar Lake. We hope to see a new facility there next summer as it would be a great loss. The staff at the restaurant, convenience store and the pump attendants were always courteous and helpful."
1234296,Guest,2010-09-09 07:00:00,0,Been stopping there for 30+ years and had stopped just two weeks ago for gas. Was always the stopping point before heading north on 105. Is there another gas station in VB or do people now have to go to Dryden?
1234305,Blue Lk,2010-09-09 07:20:00,269,"No that place was Bratland's & has been closed for years,There is another gas station/tackle shop at the west end of Vermilion Bay(Bobby's Corner)"
1234355,pjc,2010-09-09 10:15:00,6,Does anyone know the history of the Village Corner?When did it 1st open?Who owned it etc.?I think the Dudar brothers owned it for awhile.Was always a great place to visit.
1234403,Golden Eagle,2010-09-09 12:26:00,2642,"Were the Dudar brothers into curling and offering to match customers for double or nothing on their purchase? Ran across them in 1972 on my first run to Red Lake. They got us started on jigs and grubs by giving us a few complimentary samples. Over the years we had several guys who thought double or nothing was a good deal. Yeah, good deal for the guy who pays wholesale for tackle."
1234434,bpetersen,2010-09-09 14:41:00,251,I believe you are thinking of Bratland across from Bobby's. It closed a few years ago.
1236251,38bill,2010-09-17 12:03:00,331,"Its the place on the NW corner when you turn north to go to Red Lake. We always stopped there for a ice cream cone on the way up and they had really good home made fries in the cafe. They always seemed to be busy, I hope they rebuild."

1236716,wallydave,2010-09-20 08:01:00,2151,"Our Group from Goose Bay always stopped at the ""Corner"" for gas going up to Goose Bay, and stopped for gas and dry ice on the way home. If memory serves me there are no other gas stops at VB. Full service gas station, you do not see those around anymore! I hope they can rebuild by next June or we will need to find another place for dry ice!"
1236723,Blue Lk,2010-09-20 08:21:00,269,"There is a full service gas station on the west end of VB(Bobby's Corner),they also have dry ice,bait,tackle,licenses etc."
1236732,wallydave,2010-09-20 09:01:00,2151,Thanks for the tip! We rarely head west on our way home! I hope they increase thier dry ice order for next season!
1233485,Blue Lk,2010-09-06 13:29:00,269,"Just a heads up for those heading up this way.If you plan to stop at The Village Corner in VB,(junction Hwy 17,105) for your fishing licence,gas etc,you may want to reconsider.It caught fire this morning.I drove by & the fire crews were still at the scene,looks bad.The original building has been around for 60+ yrs."
1233508,Golden Eagle,2010-09-06 14:31:00,2642,Sorry to hear that. I've stopped there multiple times a year for a bunch of years. Last spring I asked them about the guy who hangs around there and drives a black truck. The girl at the counter was fresh from Wisconsin and hadn't met the guy in the black truck.
1233591,Bubbles,2010-09-06 19:25:00,7,Thats terrible. Stopped there many times while working and on my way to Canada North Lodge in Ear Falls.......Good food at the restaurant too....Hope its not completely demolished
1233617,Glenman12,2010-09-06 20:47:00,762,wow...too bad...never stopped there but noticed it on all trips thru there for a long long time..
1233652,tackleman,2010-09-07 05:50:00,444,ckdr.net has a video of the fire scene
1233678,MC620,2010-09-07 08:09:00,91,Gord probably had a front row seat. Maybe he will have an update.
1233701,canadian,2010-09-07 09:22:00,4,The building will be a complete loss. There is no roof left on it
1233718,muskyff,2010-09-07 10:00:00,8,Is this the store with the moose out front!
1233771,Stu,2010-09-07 13:16:00,472,"Wow, that is terrible. That was always our last stop before Wabby and the 1st stop on the way home. I hope they rebuild it."
1234229,JEREDOG,2010-09-08 19:56:00,21,the village was always one of our favorite stops. always had great service. hope they rebuild before we come up next year
