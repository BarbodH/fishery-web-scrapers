John and Barney at the lodge are very nice and the lodge is well kept and comfortable from what I saw. Fishing for walleyes is fantastic. Especially on the south end of the lake at the mouth of the Allanwater river. Lots of structure all thru the lake. Big pike to be had as well. Ex even caught a rock bass in there the one day. Take a good map though as there are lots of rocks and to get from the lodge to the main lake you have to run the rapids (not that hard to do if you follow the directions). Train in is nice, drops you right at their door and you are not limited by how much you can bring versus a float plane. In my 7 times there, most boats I ever saw on the lake was 8 so not crowded. Biggest walleye I caught there was 28.5 inches in length and was caught in the deep trough behind Star Island. Seen John from the lodge catch a 14 lb pike on his flyrod behind the island as well. All boats from the lodge come with rock guards and are insured as part of your daily rate. Nice fish cleaning facilities across from the lodge. Lake can get rough in a hurry so one has to be mindful of the weather but in rough conditions can always find areas that one can fish. Just a beautiful NW Ontario lake."
