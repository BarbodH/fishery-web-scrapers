1194567,crazydog,2010-04-28 23:30:00,12,"Dutchies has been the best for over 15 years.. they have changed hands in the past few years, but the service , has stayed the same with quality service and a friendly smile.... not to mention the (call ahead) stocking of our favorite cold beer , that is always ready for us to load."
1194842,team walleye,2010-04-29 17:07:00,336,who owns dutchies now? last i knew i thought it was a family from iowa.
1194894,Blue Lk,2010-04-29 19:26:00,269,"I remember when the original ""Dutchie"" ran the place(1960's).Anybody else remember him?"
1194976,crazydog,2010-04-29 21:54:00,12,"The new owners are from Iowa , I believe the wife/mother and daughter run it most of the summer.. the previous guy (not sure if he was dutchie)had been there at least 10-11 Years and he and his wife ran it...again great people... in my book they have been A #1 for many years."
1195006,teddi,2010-04-30 04:50:00,349,"the original owner,s name was holdstrom and they built the first store. dutchie [jan lowman] built the new building. he was a proper *** and still is. it has changed hands about 5 or 6 times since then."
1195079,team walleye,2010-04-30 08:16:00,336,I think I run in there for something everyday of the trip.
1236581,preswicken,2010-09-19 14:24:00,1,no dutchies open year round yet.
1236630,go dart,2010-09-19 19:01:00,77,Ya Dutchies ia a great little store. Why are so many lodges and places like Dutchies owned by Americans? You would think the Canadians would own those businesses
1236733,wallydave,2010-09-20 09:04:00,2151,"We have always stopped at Dutchies for licenses and beer! When the exchange rate is lower, I pick up some Cubans too!"
1192451,team walleye,2010-04-23 09:29:00,336,Is Dutchies in Perrault Falls open year round? If not does anyone know when it opens? Always love stopping in there when fishing on Perrault Lake.
1192455,Peffley'sCamp,2010-04-23 09:45:00,37,"No, they do not keep the store open year round. In the past it seems like the store opens about a week or so before the walleye opener (usually with some shorter hours at first) and then the regular summer schedule kicks in.Give Rikki a call at Skyline Lodge to confirm. 877-452-2809."

1193416,team walleye,2010-04-26 06:47:00,336,I really like this place. The rainbow store down the road is a nice place as well with a very friendly staff!
1193434,Tin Cann,2010-04-26 07:41:00,6,Love Dutchies Where is Rainbow store?
1193440,Peffley'sCamp,2010-04-26 08:08:00,37,Rainbow Point Store is located at Rainbow Point Camp and is about a 1/4 mile North of Dutchies on the East side of the road. Also a nice store to shop at.
1193451,team walleye,2010-04-26 08:28:00,336,"Both are very good stops with a great staff. I believe Rainbow sells licenses as well.if anyone on here works at either, send me a message. I have few questions about the stores."
1193499,Moondog,2010-04-26 12:08:00,362,Dutchies is a great place!!! Rikki let us use their phone for over an hour when VISA wouldn't allow us to use our credit card in Canada.......they thought it was stolen and put a high level hold on it. Also have beer at a good price.
1193502,Peffley'sCamp,2010-04-26 12:13:00,37,"Talked to Rikki this morning, she plans to open May 10th."
1193814,team walleye,2010-04-27 07:04:00,336,Awesome! Thanks for the info.
