1236252,tackleman,2010-09-17 12:40:00,444,"well I was given a little lesson today.I was at fishermans point and met some guys who were hauling in the fish. I hadn't had a bite and said to them ""i must be doing something wrong""I was jigging and so were they, I never got a bite, they hauled them in.In a moment of clarity, Ichecked my jig, no minnow, now I knew the problem, put a minnow on, got a fish,, go figure.Anyway these guys told me they were at the same spot yesterday and must have caught 150 walleye. fish were in 18 to 23 feet of water. water temp was 55degreesit is really rocking and rolling out there now, winds gusting up to 38 km/per hour when I came home the waves were 2 feet and growing."
1236731,Guest,2010-09-20 08:56:00,0,were the guys you talked to in a red lund prov from IA?
1237180,tackleman,2010-09-21 15:16:00,444,"yup, there were 4 in the boat."
1233960,Pat T,2010-09-08 06:27:00,221,"Any reports on this lake? Heading up in about a week. Water temps, weather, fishing reports?"
1233967,Uncle Paul,2010-09-08 06:47:00,292,"Just got back last Sunday from Gull Rock and it was our first time there. Caught lots of fish in the 14 to 18 inch size range I think our worst day was 20 and a couple of days we caught over 70 fish and we were told it was a slow bite. Used live bait with Lindy rigs from 14-30 FOW lots of rain and wind so it's hard to tell you the water temp as it was changing. Fished Keg, Red and Gull Rock also the river and fish were everywhere"
1234684,1850 Magnum,2010-09-10 13:27:00,16,"I am in Red Lake right now. The fishing has been good with alot of 12 to 15"" but have seen more 16 to 18 in the last couple of days on the flats of Gull Rock. Have gotten a few 20 to 22"" and one 24"". The winds have been a problem but it just makes things more exciting. The weather besides windy is 60 degrees during the day and 40's at night. The fish are still biting."
1235208,Pat T,2010-09-12 20:04:00,221,Any update magnum PI?
1235318,tboying,2010-09-13 10:07:00,6,Thanks for the report guys. I am going up Friday the 17th and have heard the last couple days the bite for larger walleyes is really picking up. Also heard that the weedbeds in the normal northern spots are gone. Any truth to that? I like to fish the weedbed just north of the gullrock and also the claybanks.
1235380,Uncle Paul,2010-09-13 12:55:00,292,"Don't know about the normal spots because this was my first trip but my biggest northern were caught at the Three Sisters and the bigger eyes were off of the Clay Banks, the biggest of the trip 26.5 was caught right where the river empties into the lakes."
1235382,tboying,2010-09-13 13:00:00,6,"Thanks, are you talking where the river enters gullrock from Keg?"
1235501,tackleman,2010-09-13 21:21:00,444,"went out today around 3pm for a couple hours, only got 3 off the heel of the boot in about 20 feet of water. talked to a couple boats, they were saying it has been slow this week, guess that's because the winds have really been blowing and the lake has been very rough.hopefully the next few days will see lower winds and warmer temps, the water temp is 57 degrees, down 7 degrees from last week."
1235954,Pat T,2010-09-16 06:55:00,221,Any lake updates...heading up there early tomorrow morning!!!
1235990,flntknp17,2010-09-16 10:59:00,151,"Can't speak about Gullrock specifically, but I can tell you that about 95% of the cabbage on the western end of Lac Seul is dead and falling over and this was the case in pools on the Wenasaga also. I would assume Gullrock would be similar. Pike were STACKED in the areas with living cabbage, but it was dying quickly. I left the 11th.Matt"
