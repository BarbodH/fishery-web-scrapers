I bought a Humminbird 150 ( same as 160 but not a dual beam) and used it for a week.I saw no ned for a dual beam unit and it worked flawlessly all week. It was an outstanding depthfinder. Very clear, showed bottom, structure and fish clearly.It came in a case with rechargeable battery and charger. It was used appox. 12 hours a day for a week. I recharged it 3 times in the entire week of use. I would reccommend this unit to anyone. The cost was also very inexpensive. Bought it on EBay brand new for $120 shipped to my house free. I will be buying the ice transducer for it next month for my fishing hut."
