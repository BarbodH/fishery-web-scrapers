1237552,Bigsauger,2010-09-22 19:56:00,12,What are the resort / outpost options on the east side of Lac Seul?
1237731,Rodney Bondele,2010-09-23 14:56:00,73,"Just stayed at Mahkwa Lodge. The House keeping cabin we stayed in was rustic but comfortable. The American plan area looks very nice. They are remodeling and building new cabins on the on the house keeping side. Price is fair. I have heard June fishing can be outstanding, but they fill up early. I have also stayed at Chamberlin narrows and ran the rapids from Sioux Lookout to get to lac Suel. What can I say? It is all good.Rodney Bondele"
1235596,2746,2010-09-14 11:01:00,3206,"Have been fishing Canada for nearly 50 years and in that time have had two fall trips where we experienced what you describe. Both times the locals said the lake was ""turning over"", something that's caused by the top layer of water cooling and then falling to the bottom. I know that happens but don't have a clue if that's what we actually experienced or not. It at least made a good excuse for the fish not biting."
1235844,MikeMcC,2010-09-15 15:47:00,72,If the slow walleye fishing is a result of the fall turnover hopefully it is done soon. Anyone know how long the turnover lasts? I have a week long trip starting this weekend. Staying towards Ear Falls but hope on doing a considerable amount of fishing around McKenzie and further east if weather and wind cooperate. Will post results upon return.
1235902,Guest,2010-09-15 19:42:00,0,My take on the fishing was the weather. STIFF north and east winds make tough fishing conditions. Many days boat control was a challenge and made fishing windy sides of shore not possible. Fished in a 20.5' boat and had lots of water over the bow trying to fish. Did locate some fish on the windless sides of islands but nothing to get real excited about. Usually had to fish with the wind down the shoreline. The fish were in a negative mood majority of the week. Nobody was hammering the walleye in the camp I was staying at. Considered heading to Sunlight but the wind/waves nixed that idea. If the weather cooperates you will have a good trip. Be open minded and move if the fish are not biting!
1236403,Rodney Bondele,2010-09-18 09:38:00,73,I was fishing Lac Seul at the same time in the Hudson area and experienced the same problems. I struggled with plastics every day and would go back to minnows. We also had a hard time catching fish under 18 inches in many areas. On Friday after the wind switched to more of a southerly direction the fishing did pick up. The pattern that stood out the most was finding ciscos schooled up near shore and fishing around them.
1236916,Guest,2010-09-20 19:31:00,0,"I fished Lac Seul out of Hudson from Sept 4th-Sept 11 and had some fairly good days on walleye despite the weather. On Day 1 we were fishing mostly medium to large minnows on jigs and put 110 fish in the boat among 3 of us for a good start to the trip. The larger minnows were clearly producing a lot better than the small ones, specially in the am. Jig colours were also important with different colours working in different spots and at different times. Most of our best success was up North in the Bear Narrows area. Slots and over slots were hard to come by all week and our largest by a good bit was around 26"". Fish were generally located around 16 to 22 FOW. The weather got worse and the fishing got tougher as the week went on but we still got fish, including my first Master Pike at 40.5"" and nearly 17 lbs. I found that the fish turned on in the afternoon around 3:30 pm or so and then it was steady until it was time to make the long run home around 5:00 pm. I really like the Spring for consistent big walleye but I wouldn't miss getting in a Fall trip if the opportunity arises. The scenery was great and there was almost no one on the water most days. I would do it again in a heartbeat."
1237123,flntknp17,2010-09-21 11:40:00,151,Glad you caught fish! Man it was tough for us and the rest of the folks on the west end. I am not familiar with the area where you were fishing. We stay around Ear Falls and I haven't ever gone any further than Mackenzie Bay. Interested in other areas of the lake.Matt
1237169,tv4fish,2010-09-21 14:49:00,2694,"Hey Matt: You may want to consider trying the east portions of Lac Seul - as mentioned - the Bear Narrows, Chamberlain, Vaughn Bay, etc. areas are all pretty good. In fact, I think you would also find the roads going up to the east from Dryden are better than the ones going to the west side."
1237342,nitrodude,2010-09-22 10:04:00,60,Great advice here.
1237379,JDP,2010-09-22 11:44:00,1457,"I fished the east side for over 15 years, but in the last 5 years have switched to the east and will not go back west anytime soon.The roads from Dryden to Sioux Lookout are very good.The fishing on the east side is excellent.I have fished Bray Lake, Aldous Bay, Bear Narrows and Chamberlain Narrows to name a few areas."
1237431,flntknp17,2010-09-22 13:25:00,151,Thanks guys for the suggestions. We keep going to Ear Falls in part because we know the lake so well on that side and the owners of Gold Pines have treated our family well for more than 30 years.I would like to try the east sometime though for smallies and maybe a muskie......Matt
1235011,flntknp17,2010-09-11 22:39:00,151,"Just got back this evening from a week on Lac Seul (Ear Falls end). The fishing was tough to say the least........there were 13 fisherman in camp and I would guess there were about 200 walleye landed total. Thats not a lot for ~78 fisherman-days on a water that good. The water temp dropped steadily while we where there as daytime highs were in the low 50's and nights were in the low 30's with frost most nights. We had a strong north wind 5 of the 7 days I fished with yesterday being unfishable due to huge waves from 30+mph wind. We had no trouble finding fish at all. They just wouldn't bite in numbers. I would pull up to a spot and see plenty on the finder and almost always one or two would bite immediately.....then the spot would die and we would have to move on. As far as I know only one walleye cleaned in camp this week had anything in its stomach (I cleaned one with two minnows in it).........all the rest were empty. On the positive side, the pike were in fine form and I have never seen fatter, stronger pike anywhere, anytime. Thats good to see as I am used to seeing huge numbers of smallish pike in Lac Seul. I saw fewer, but they were really nice. I threw a few musky sized baits thursday and had about an 8lb average for maybe 10 pike landed with fish to 16lbs. We fished from the railroad bridge to about halfway up Mackenzie and the walleye were just in an odd mood at best. Had a good time though enjoying early fall in a beautiful area and saw some cool wildlife (wolves, bear, otters, sandhill cranes, and of course hundreds of eagles).Will post a couple pics tomorrow.Matt"
1235015,flntknp17,2010-09-11 23:08:00,151,Forgot to add that the gas station on the corner of 17 and 105 in Vermillion Bay burned down on Thursday. Kinda sad......we have stopped there for years.Matt
1235049,Hump,2010-09-12 07:50:00,578,Were the camps full?
1235132,flntknp17,2010-09-12 15:07:00,151,"We stayed at Gold Pines. Our family has been going there since the middle 70s and I have been going since I was 5 (1986). Bill, Helen, and Peter treat us like family and I will keep going back! This was my first trip up bringing my own boat and without my dad going along so it was sort of a learning experience.As I said, there were 13 fisherman this week at Gold Pines, I would guess thats about half full. It looked like Evergreen had a decent number of folks this week judging by the boats I saw. Looked like Golden Fawn had none (maybe they are done for the year?). By the middle of the week we knew about everyone fishing the west end of the lake since there just weren't that many of us. Had a couple days where we didn't have a boat within a mile for most of the day. Went to Mackenzie on Tuesday and saw a total of three boats the entire day. Here are a few pics. Can't seem to make them just show up as pics........help anyone?http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...7/100_0086.jpgOver-the-slot from the mouth of the Wenasaga Riverhttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...7/100_0088.jpgSlot fish from Lunker Pointhttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...7/100_0089.jpgFattest pike I have ever caught.......had shoulders!http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...7/100_0082.jpgNice fish of 37"". These were just super healthy, hard-fighting pike. I can't wait to see how the pike fishery there develops in the next few years!Matt"
1235151,Hump,2010-09-12 16:27:00,578,They show as pics with me. We always stay at Evergreen and never go further than Steamboat. didn't even go that far this year. glad you had a good time.
1235367,Guest,2010-09-13 12:00:00,0,"Fished the same area and would have to say the fishing was marginal at best. The weather was not the best>3 days of north winds and 2 days of east winds. Water temps dropped 6 degrees to 59 degrees by the end of the week. Afternoon bite was much better than in the morning. Most fish by weeks end came out of 14-17' of water. Biggest walleye was 24"" otherwise lots of smaller fish not many in the slot or over the slot. In the last 17 years this year was at the bottom for quanity or quality of fish. Highlight was a 40"" northern and a 18"" smallmouth. I'll be back to try it again next year... 8 months to go!"
1235390,Mike Kansas,2010-09-13 13:47:00,1463,Noticed in the pictures that it appeared that you were fishing plastics. Did you try live bait and if so was the fishing any better with live? When we have gone in September our best luck on LS has been with big minnows or crawlers on jigs. Mike Kansas
1235421,flntknp17,2010-09-13 15:49:00,151,Caught about half the 'eyes on Gulp! minnows and about half on a power grub with a real minnow. Didn't seem to matter all that much what we used......the ones that were gonna bite did and the remainder weren't aggressive at all. I think we nailed the transition from summer to fall and the fish weren't sure what they wanted to do. Matt
1235422,Rich B,2010-09-13 15:50:00,1081,Matt - thanks for sharing the photos - nice fat pike by the way - glad to hear you had a good trip even though the walleyes were not going - Rich
1235493,bpetersen,2010-09-13 21:06:00,251,Nice looking pike...
