There's a lot of worthless water out there and would like a few hot spots to try if anyone else has been to this area. I was there last year and had some luck at north end of Dokis island, Puddick Island and Sand Bay. Any help would be appreciated. I'm looking for bays with some cabbage weeds. We're staying at Key Harbour Lodge."

1220973,ohiojmj,2010-07-20 13:45:00,1262,I'm already back. Here's my report: http://www.ohiogamefishing.com/commu...d.php?t=151351
1235806,Buzz 880,2010-09-15 12:36:00,3,thats a nice pike you caught looks like around henvey.I fish the key and GB almost every weekend fishing has been slow this year.But nice weather to be out in sorry to hear about your skeg but there is lots of hard water on the bay.
1236629,PIKEMAN330,2010-09-19 18:54:00,101,I have only fished that area one time.About the only place I liked at all was Fox Bay.That is why we have not been back.
1236726,ohiojmj,2010-09-20 08:37:00,1262,"The ""key"" for our success in GB has been to find decent cabbage weed beds near deeper water. As I see it, the problem is finding decent water to fish in such a vast area. It was intimidating on our first trip until we got some help with location. My July trip was hampered by 90+ temepratures and high sun. I'm not sure that I'm going to give up on a place that I've visited twice that produced abundant wallaye one year and a 42"" pike (plus one of equal size lost at boat) this year. I've been told it's not a place for qauntity, but good for quality."
