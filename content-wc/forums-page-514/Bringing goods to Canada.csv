As I plan to go to Gan with my wife later this week, I pulled my boat to Gan and left it there rather than bringing home to PA, and then all the way back to Gan, later in the week. I'm planning to buy a new bowmount here in PA and take it with me to mount on my boat. Is there anything I should be concerned about crossing the border with a new bowmount in a box? I'm thinking as long as I am returning to the states with the motor, it shouldn't be a customs or tax issue. Is that correct?"

Your answer of course would be no. Other questions have to do with food items guns etc. Again, that's what I recall.....maybe someone else know for sure. I did the same thing 3 years ago (left my boat in Canada from a spring trip) and brought up a finder to mount. There were no questions ask then that created a problem."

Apparently you're supposed to get a permit to do so or stand the chance of being fined.Anybody know the straight skinny on this?"
1235636,octanehi5,2010-09-14 14:16:00,1104,"Shellback we go back and forth to Quebec a few times a yr. some times we bring boats and sometime not. we leave the boats at a friends house in canada if we are going back up. upon returning to the states we have never been asked if we brought a boat back or not,Its stands to reason that if your boat is behind you,its with you, the border guards in canada only check whats going in to canada. so once you get into canada with your boat,you only need to worrie about getting back in the states,with the cubian cigars you bought. I have also found in my 25yrs. + of fishing in the great north,I do not answer anything if not asked about it.in other words do not volunteer any info crossing into or out of your home land. I hope this helps you out"

1236221,Guest,2010-09-17 09:40:00,0,"Canadian tax authorities want to make sure that they receive their fair share of boat registration fees. They have the authority to confiscate boats permanently left in Canada if they are not registered. There is an exception if a boat is stored at a marina which provides service to the boat in the off season. Changing the oil qualifies as a service. We leave a boat year round at a marina which charges a reasonable storage fee and does whatever service work is needed in the off season. We are provided with a very simple form that can either be dropped off at Canadian customs or faxed to them. This is more convenient for us than towing our boat back and forth to our cabin. I understand that from time to time enforcement raids have been done. Re bringing goods to Canada, the only problem I ever had was when I did not bring receipts showing the value of the lumber and building materials I was bringing across. It took the customs agent some time to calculate a value and I ended up getting dinged with a bit of a premium on the duty but they were nice enough about it. Just bring a receipt for anything on which a duty is owed."
1236646,J-Man,2010-09-19 19:39:00,191,"To leave your boat between trips legally, all you need is 5 mins worth of free paperwork. It's a temporary import permit. Have the make, model, serial numbers of your boat, motors, trailer reg, etc all ready and you will be in and out. The service requirement is correct for winter only. It is not a requirement for the summer. We usually get a call every year in late november or december checking on permits for winter storage when Canadian customs does an audit via site visit. At times, the paperwork has been forgotten by guests or not done if they planned to come and get the boat but then it got too late so they left it for the winter. Usually, a call and fax will clear up anything that is missed, but they do want things current so that any registration and sales tax on the values of the boat is paid if they will be left in canada ""permanently."" I don't know of anyone that has been fined as long as they have taken care of the paperwork promptly when asked. You would more likely be given a short time frame to take care of it and then a warning to remove the boat or pay the tax would be my guess. Having the permit will also help your cause when you bring up a new graph or bowmount trolling motor. You can use it as proof that the new items will not be left in canada ""permanently"" and should be not taxed as such. At times, customs agents, especially in Rainy River and Fort Frances (surprise, surprise) will give people a little hassle about winter storage work permits. Just tell them to check their manuals and it will show that it is allowed. Be polite and patient and they will have to fill your paperwork and you'll be on your way for the winter. Summer is never much of an issue."
