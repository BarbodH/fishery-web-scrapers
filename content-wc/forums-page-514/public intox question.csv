1199686,stinkycat,2010-05-12 14:13:00,2018,I know this sounds like a story but the question was for a buddy of mine that had a DUI a couple of years ago. I have a clear record as far as I know and thats my story and I am sticking to it I agree its public info but to foreign countries? But I guess they can go on the internet just as fast or faster than we can!

1200177,Dacotah Eye,2010-05-13 15:26:00,2722,I believe the US government provides it to Canadian border authorities.

1236893,Obabikon,2010-09-20 18:36:00,2370,I believe the Patriot Act had some to do with the enhanced information sharing.

1199220,Pines,2010-05-11 12:29:00,10,"OK, I read the sticky on crossing the border with a DWI or DUI, but with the question they ask ""Have you ever been convicted of a crime"" Does this include public intox? A guy going with us payed a fine on public intox at a football game. Will he have to tell them about a public intox or just ignore it?"
1199250,jigman2003,2010-05-11 13:51:00,15,"Was it a misdemeanor or simple forfeiture? Forfeitures are not ""crimes"", they are the same thing as a speeding ticket. At least in the states they're not crimes - I do imagine that if they were to run him they could see that he had been ticketed for the offense. If asked (I've never been asked if I've been convicted of any crimes) I'd sure as heck be honest."
1199279,Pines,2010-05-11 14:58:00,10,"Simple forfeiture, payed his fine.We did'nt know if it would affect the crossing."
1199310,JinxCanada,2010-05-11 15:58:00,1306,"no public intox is not an inadmissible offense. unless he was charged with something like ""mischief"" he should be ok."
1199416,Mark R,2010-05-11 21:17:00,1538,mischief is an in admissable offense? What about Hi Jinks?
1199418,Mark R,2010-05-11 21:23:00,1538,"On a serious note, what if a person is arrested for say DUI but either takes a defferd judgement or beats the charge in court either way the result is no conviction. Does the arrest alone make them inadmissable?"
1199469,JinxCanada,2010-05-12 05:34:00,1306,no. only convictions (includes fines/probation etc) are considered.
1199515,stinkycat,2010-05-12 07:38:00,2018,My question is how does the Canadian border crossing officials have access to any records from the US? How do they know if you have a DUI or not? Have not been to Canada since 2002.
1199528,Walleye_Wrangler,2010-05-12 08:17:00,138,Hi-jinks --- LOL
1199576,scotttheguide,2010-05-12 10:00:00,73,"stinkycat,I don't think Jinx can answer that question, but I think criminal records are public information as long as you are not a minor. Our borders are kind of busy so I am sure information and data bases are shared. If you want to know for sure what is on your personal police record you can call the state police where you live and they can send you to a private agency that will screen you and run your prints. I think it cost like $45. Then you can get a copy of your report, Hopefully it says 'No criminal report found"". Then you know for sure if anything is on there."
