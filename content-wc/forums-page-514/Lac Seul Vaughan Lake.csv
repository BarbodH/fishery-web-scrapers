1237119,ksimo264,2010-09-21 11:21:00,2,"I have been reading about the Lac Seul fishing spots everyone travels to. Has anyone ever fished Vaughan Lake part of the Lac Seul? I fished this area app. five years ago while staying with Fin and Feathers Ontario North Outpost. I have not been there recently but have fond memories of catching big numbers of walleyes and nice Northern Pike also. Curious to see if anyone has boated up to this area from Ear Falls.Thanks,KSIMO264"
1237179,teddi,2010-09-21 15:11:00,349,not to many go from ear falls as it is 80 miles down the lake. i have fished it in the past and found fishing has dropped off badly over the years. logging road acess has opened the lake up to everyone now and it is getting hit a lot harder now
1237186,IaDave,2010-09-21 15:35:00,476,Fished 2 weeks ago with a guide and the 6 of us caught 130 in 6 hours. The weather that week was bad so I thought 130 wasn't too bad. He said normally it would be 150+ in a trip. Fished a couple of wind blown points in 5'-12' water. Also fished a rockpile in 25' of water. It was a little over an hour from Deception Landing. No other boats were fishing but a few were passing thru.
1237860,Skiball,2010-09-23 21:35:00,82,"ksimo:Just got back from Lac Seul. We stay at Mahkwa which is about 2 miles from the Vaughan entrance. Other fishermen had good luck with the eyes. We fished northern in Vaighan last week. Got a 15.5.lb and 13.0 lb. The northern fishery in Vaughan is still real healthy. Only problem in the last two or three years was the abscence of weeds in the first two weeks of Sept due to high water. Other than that, Vaughan continues to put out great numbers. We actually have fished Lac Seul for 18 years adn prefer the main lake but it took years to learn. Can't wait til next year. Only 11 months and 4 weeks to go.Happy Fishing.Skiball."
1238041,ksimo264,2010-09-24 14:49:00,2,"Ski-Ball,When you went to Mahkwa lodge, did you fish the area around the Ontario North Outpost cabin (formerly owned by Fin and Feather). We were wondering if it would be beneficial to stay at Mahkwa and boat down to the areas we use to fish at that outpost intstead of flying out there. Would you recommend Mahkwa? We use to go the 3rd week in July and remember trolling firetiger rattle-traps for Northerns. It was an awesome feeling when they latched on, what a fight.Really loved that area and want to go back. Any feedback about this area would be awesome.Thanks,KSimo264"
1238267,Rodney Bondele,2010-09-25 16:52:00,73,Just fished out of Mahkwa a couple weeks ago. We fished several spots on Vaughan Lake. Yes Mahkwa is an option. They have house keeping and american plan. Our house keeping cabin was old but they have remodled several cabins and are building a new one. The american plan area appears very nice. There is also a different place near Mahkwa. I can not remember the name. Good LuckRodney Bondele
1238298,Pooch,2010-09-25 18:48:00,4619,"Lac Seul Adventures? Something like that. We stopped by and had a look around. Not real impressed. Mahkwa is getting run down, but still better of the two. Nice folks at Mahkwa.Pooch"
1238320,JDP,2010-09-25 19:41:00,1457,There is another small (2 cabins I believe) place that I believe is adjacent to Mahkwa Lodge called Mahkoon's. Lac Seul Adventures is around the point towards the opening to Vaughn Lake.
