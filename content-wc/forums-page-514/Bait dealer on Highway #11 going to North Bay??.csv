519143,Guest,2002-04-12 23:12:00,0,I forgot to mention that this book is at all beer and booze outlets all over Ontario. Interestingly enough it has a very nice pic of a walleye on the cover. Again ......If it was me I would not sweat over it.Dave
1237977,Derek LBO,2010-09-24 10:58:00,1,"One great place to stop is at Lake Bernard Outfitters, they have Bait, Tackle etc. and are on HWY 11.Lake Bernard Outfitters93-B Ontario ST. (AKA Hwy 11)Sundridge 1-705-384-7948"

519133,Guest,2002-04-09 18:56:00,0,"Can anyone tell us where a good bait dealer may be located on Highway # 11 North on the way to North Bay? We are going to a lodge in Quebec but after talking to them tonite, they do not sell leeches but said we can buy them in Ontario.Thanks in advance."
519134,Guest,2002-04-09 21:58:00,0,"If you are driving north on Hwy 11, and were not able to find a bait dealer that sells leeches, you would have to be blind or driving in the middle of the night. Hwy 11 is used by thousands of people each and every day and is part of the Trans-Canada Hwy. One place that you may want to stop at is north of Orillia, on the right side called Epps Sporting Goods. If I remember correctly they have been there since before Christ was born. Interesting place to walk around in and you may be wanting make a pit stop by then. Just because I am intersted, would it be ok to ask where in Que. you are going? I ask because if you leave 11 at North Bay, and are going to Que, you are either crossing at Mattawa or Tamiscaming. The next crossing north of that is New Liskeard. It may be to your advantage to stay in Ontario longer, than the spring backroads of Que.dave"
519135,bigfish1965,2002-04-09 22:46:00,3210,Can you bring leeches inter-provincially?
519136,Guest,2002-04-10 05:40:00,0,"This place is just east (1 mile) of North Bay at the junction of Hwy. 11 and Rt. 63. They should have everything you need.Trout Lake Outdoor Centre Phone: (705)495-4227 3791 Trout Lake Rd. North Bay, ON We pass by this place on our way into Temiscaming, Quebec and get some last minute stock-up done before we enter the bush. What lake are you heading to as I may know a closer source for bait and tackle?"
519137,Guest,2002-04-10 19:02:00,0,Thanks guys- Epps I do know where its at but never stopped there. Will this time. T-Bone- we are going to Lake Ogascanan. Thanks for the help also.
519138,Guest,2002-04-10 19:39:00,0,"I just read a post at another site about the Import of Bait. It says that it is illegal to bring Live fish, crayfish, or salamanders into Ontario. As for leeches, it is illegal to bring leeches into Ontario, unless you are the holder of a commercial lic. That may not apply to taking them into Que. I am just replying to the post above. Dave"
519139,Guest,2002-04-10 19:50:00,0,"REMBRANT100- These bait stores ARE IN ONTARIO. Yes, your!e right, no importation of bait except worms in artificial bedding allowed into Ontario from other areas."
519140,Marc Thorpe,2002-04-11 04:52:00,384,Same applies in Quebec guys.Reason is they want no introduction of foreign species in water shields.I would check the regs before going and buying your live bait.Most waters in Quebec dont even allow live minnows.Best check the regsmarc thorpe
519141,Guest,2002-04-11 07:22:00,0,"I'm going to check the reqs, but I anticipate having trouble finding the exact rule on this. Are you stating that you believe it is against regulations to take leeches bought in ,say, North Bay - Ontario 15 miles across the Ottawa River to a lake in Quebec? If the answer to that is yes, how would anyone know? I know there are several species of leeches, but isn't a leech purchased in North Bay, Ontario likely the same leech purchased in Laniel, Quebec? Each ""dealer"" probably buys them from the same source.If you know the web site that has the reqs, please post it...I'd really appreciate it as I want to play by the rules."
519142,Guest,2002-04-12 23:02:00,0,"What I said was that you may not bring those, as bait, INTO Ontario. See page 9 ....Ontario Fishing Reg. Summary.....Import of bait.....I also said that I did not know if it appied going the other way.That said: If it was me, I would not worry about it. Again, I am only replying to the above post as to the import of bait rules. It is not that I agree.....But it is the law. Dave"
