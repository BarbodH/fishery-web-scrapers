1238830,BGunn,2010-09-28 05:03:00,880,"I got to be honest with you, The last time I was in Nestor Falls (8 years ago) we stopped at a bait shop for minnows.$30.00 per small scoopAn honest 50% of them were Three-spined sticklebacks that the Crappies wouldn't touch.Since then we've found that the Arnesen's, and the people at the NW angle are more ""Fishermen Friendly"".Just Sayin'...."
1238911,Fishoil,2010-09-28 09:55:00,1277,That would turn me off too if I got charged that much for crap minnows. In my experiences in the 15 plus times that I've been there bait has been reasonably priced and good quality.
