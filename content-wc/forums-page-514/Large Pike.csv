1238843,Bigfishhunter,2010-09-28 06:52:00,803,"Pike are my primary species, I catch thousands of them in a summer season and then hundreds in a winter season (I go out less in winter). I never net fish anymore, first of all I don't care if they get off, I have caught enough. When I do net fish it is usually because it is someone else in my boat who is hooked into a big one and I know they would be dissapointed if it came off and they didn't get their picture. For that reason I have a great big net with a great big bag on it. I scoop the fish, lift the hoop out of the water and leave the fish to rest easy right side up in the bag as we get the camera ready and maybe tools. I wear Carhart pants and in the side tool pocket goes my Baker hookout and Baker spreaders if I need them fast. I also have the livewell full (I have a 55"" livewell) which can help as well, if I don't have a net or want better control for reviving fish in rough water, plus the running water seems to help them recover faster. Also when handling smaller pike, too many people grag the line and throw them into the bottom of the boat to get the carpet all slimy and wipe off the only protection the fish has. I always tell people to grab them in the water on the back of the head. I call this my kung fu death grip, see attached photo. This does two things, it seems to force the fish to open its mouth, and they don't kick either. Grabbing the gill plate works on larger fish, just use two hands when you pull it out of the water."
1238851,Golden Eagle,2010-09-28 07:32:00,2642,"Sometimes a large bait will have all three treble hooks in a pike's mouth. Remove the easiest first, then the next easy one and so on. It's quick and easy, but especially good for the fish.As Gord mentioned, sometimes the easiest hook to remove is best reached by going past the gills. It can be done quickly. Have the tools ready and just do it."
1238891,dutchboy,2010-09-28 09:13:00,5717,If fishing big Pike for fun trade out the treble hooks for single hooks and bend the barbs flat. Easy release and better for the fish.
1238909,Golden Eagle,2010-09-28 09:51:00,2642,"Good advice re: using single hooks, which I've done with spoons, but my most productive bait is a Suick. I use a dead bait on a circle hook, but only about an hour or two each year. Bass sized spinnerbaits are another go to bait at ice out. A couple of days later a JSM produces. Then I go to Suicks."
1239044,eyemike,2010-09-28 16:45:00,233,Buy extra treble hooks and a real good wire cutter. Cut the trebles at the bend and release. Muskie fishermen have been doing it for years.
1239087,Bigfishhunter,2010-09-28 19:44:00,803,"I know but muskie fisherman only catch as many fish in a season as I do in a morning, if I were cutting hooks everytime that I caught a big fish I would spend like 250$ every weekend on hooks. Now I could probably cut that down to 100$ if I only cut hooks on fish bigger than 36"" but still, with pike one has to learn good handling methods and hook removal."
1236372,Golden Eagle,2010-09-18 06:25:00,2642,"My pike fishing has improved greatly the past couple of decades, but I credit C & R over slots. Still, too many fishermen are boating big pike before fishermen learn to properly care for a pike when practicing C & R. A lot of big pike are injured during C & R. It's a shame."
1236431,2746,2010-09-18 13:23:00,3206,"I don't know if anyone knows the number of big pike lost to incorrect handeling or not but it's got to be major. Some folks have taken the time to learn but I'm continually surprised at the number of guys I fish with or have been around that grab for the eyes, allow them to wrap up in the net, leave them bleeding from the gills or allow the fish to flop around on the bottom of the boat. Most of those pike, even though they swim away, will not live long and, in those cases, C & R does little good. Kevin Geary, now running a place on Nungesser, used to talk a lot about handeling pike on his TV series years ago. Haven't seen anything like that for some time however."
1236806,dutchboy,2010-09-20 13:18:00,5717,"Anyone wanting to learn how to handle big Pike just wonder over to the Muskie sites. They BBQ at least a guy a week for improper release methods. Keep your hands wet. I also try to wet the net before scooping them and I never pull the fish or net completely out of the water. With a big hoop net it's easy enough to let the fish swim in the net while pulling the hooks. I actually put the handle of the net in the rod holder which Free's both hands.Remember it's the slime that protects the fish. Be gentle and they will provide another fight another day.Yes, slot limits help!! How could they not?"
1237606,Campcountry,2010-09-23 07:09:00,164,In the area where I usually fish for pike in Northwestern Ontario large pike have been plentiful in recent years and I believe the slot size has helped. This year however the large pike have been few and far between and I believe that angling pressure over the last couple of winters is the culprit. Over the last few winters there has been some non-stop ice fishing going on with large pike being the target. Hauling these big guys up on the ice when it is 20 below zero is probably a death sentence.The slot size resulted in bigger pike but that also increased the popularity of catching the bruisers. The slot size should help the population recover and the cycle will repeat...
1237612,wallydave,2010-09-23 07:31:00,2151,"Most of the time, I try to release pike with minimal handling, flattened barbs to ease release, and try to release without using net. Aside from wet hands, wet net and not let the fish flop around in the boat, what are tips to assure a healthy release?"
1237662,Aaron-IN,2010-09-23 09:36:00,500,I've noticed a significant improvement in both numbers and size of Pike on the Winnipeg River (Minaki) since the slot went into effect there.
1237666,2746,2010-09-23 10:08:00,3206,"I'm no expert and would like to learn more about handling thes big fish as well but, I think you've already identified the most important ones. Barbless hooks, try to release while still in the water and w/o a net, if handling is necessary use a large wet net and attempt to leave them in the lake or, if using your hands is the only option, be sure they are wet and don't use gloves. (If you use your hands a firm grip in the upper gill directly under the chin is probably best for you and the fish but I spend a good deal of time leaning over the boat trying to release them without taking them out of the lake) As someone said, it's the loss of slime that will eventually kill these fish so anything we can do to prevent that is good. It's all a far cry from the old methods of sticking ones fingers into their eye sockets or dispatching them with a billy club before hauling them into the boat.Perhaps an expert who does this regularly will chime in and correct us all."
1237767,Guest,2010-09-23 17:33:00,0,"IMHO, I believe the slot is helping to increase numbers and helping to preserve size to a degree. The best ""trophy"" genetics have already been removed years ago, and are FUBAR in most systems. I'm speculating in years to come that there will be a greater chance of hooking into fish 36-44"" than there is today. But the chance at catching a 48-50""+ pike in Ontario's ""easily accessible"" water bodies is a thing of the past. Only way to do it would be to go to a fly-in outpost really. Keep in mind that the big ones have always been out there, but you weren't catching them."
1238216,2746,2010-09-25 10:22:00,3206,"about the survival rate of released pike or, for that matter, any species. The use of artifical baits vs. live bait makes a big difference. Unless one learns to pay close attention, live bait (even dead bait for pike) is often taken so deeply by the fish that release becomes difficult. That's much less of a risk with artificials. Not trying to advocate restricting the use of live bait but, when considering survival of released fish, it's certainly a question to consider."
1238400,v-bay gord,2010-09-26 07:30:00,3168,"My observations on pike handling are that most anglers don't have the right tools to begin with.....pliers that are too small or too short to reach into the mouth. A pair of ""hook-outs"" work well. The other observation is that many anglers tend towards using the ""brute force"" method of hook removal rather than backing the hooks out the way they came in. A tip that most should consider trying is to go in through the gills with your hook-out or long pliers to get at deep hooks. As long as you are gentle in the gill area you can often back out hooks easily that would be very difficult going through the mouth."
1235376,Babamel2,2010-09-13 12:36:00,414,a number of years ago the Canadian regulations included a Slot for pike. This year our party caught a few that were in the slot and 3 that were over. I was wondering if in recent years you have caught an increase in the number of pike over 26 1/2 in?
1235424,Rich B,2010-09-13 15:52:00,1081,"I was up NE of the Soo several weeks ago with my wife, and she caught a real nice 27"" fat pike when we were bottom bouncing for eyes - got to believe the slot has helped. Rich"
1235470,Wall-i-Lama,2010-09-13 19:16:00,1524,"We think the pike fishing gets better each year and believe that the slot really helps. See attached photo of 40"" that is still swimming up there!https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...727825&thumb=1"
1235494,Bigfishhunter,2010-09-13 21:11:00,803,"yes slots are a good thing. My father and I catch on average 15-20 fish each over 40"" in a year, and about 15 Years ago, mine and my pop's numbers were not that high. we would get a lot of mid 30's with the odd one over 40. We believe it has to do with the increase in catch and release fishing."
1235497,flntknp17,2010-09-13 21:15:00,151,I have been fishing Lac Seul for pike for about 25 years and have noticed a huge change in the size structure of the pike there. I catch far more large pike now than we ever did before. To my eye the slot has worked magic on that lake. I can honestly say I caught as many pike in/over the slot there this year as I did under it. Really makes for some fun fishing and still allows keeping an eater or two for dinner.Matt
1236200,Mike Kansas,2010-09-17 08:09:00,1463,"Our group has been fishing Lac Seul for over 25 years. In the beginning Pike was our choice of species. We actually had days in early July years back that one boat with two fisherman would have days of 200 Pike or better fishing weedbeds. Trophies were far and few between with the majority of Pike being in the 25"" to 35"" range. The last ten years our group focuses on Walleyes and Smallmouth however we do catch some Pike while fishing with jig/minnow for Eyes or casting for Smallies. We have caught bigger Pike doing that than we have throwing Spinner baits all those previous years. We have caught at least one Pike every year for the last ten that has been 40""++. Biggest being 45"". My wife caught four Pike this year trolling In Line Spinners that were all over 40"" and the biggest was 43"". It appears that the Slot has really helped and the Toothy Critter population has a few more Big Girls in it that can be caught. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1236217,tv4fish,2010-09-17 09:34:00,2694,"Mike You gotta tell us where you have been fishing on LS to get those numbers. ---- My group has also been fishing LS for that long. I'll never forget our first trip up there -- we stopped at that little store in Dinorwic, right where 72 goes north off 17. We went in and asked the little old gal who was working behind the counter ""Where can we go to catch big fish and LOTS of them ?"" Her response ------------ ""you shoulda been here 50 years ago"""
1236226,Mike Kansas,2010-09-17 09:58:00,1463,"We have fished for all the years out of Lac Seul Lodge at their Outpost camp called Black Bear. Keep in mind we use to go the first week in July when the weeds were coming up around the islands and points. We used 3/4 oz spinner baits and would beat the weeds to death. This is when we were younger and could cast for 10 hours a day. We now go in early June to the same place and focus on Eyes and Smallies. The weedbeds are not up yet in June and our group spends very little time throwing spinner baits for pike . We do troll In Line Spinners and big Cranks for Pike and we catch a fair amount on them. I think last year I trolled with my wife for a total of 6 hours and she brought in some nice pike. If I were going for Pike I would go the earliest in the year I could and cast the shallow bays with spinners or swim baits or I would go in July/August and beat the weed beds to death with V spinners. If you want to see the biggest Pike we got there go to our website www.sirmanski.com and look at the Fish Photo Section. I think it was a 45"". Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1236235,Flip Silverlake,2010-09-17 10:57:00,645,"My wife and I spend most of the summer on Lake Of The Woods out of Kenora. This year she caught 4 Northern over 40 inches. We have never had that kind of Northern action fishing up there. I only fish for Walleyes and we were picking these up on jig's tipped with a leach. She had one do a Tarpon tail dance but we didn't get it close enough to really eyeball it. I was going to try and boat one of the Northern by grabbing it behind the eyes, and it was so wide across the back that my hand was not big enough to grab it. We had one that tried to torpedo the boat. He just keep swimming and hitting the boat with his nose, after we let that one go he went after a Pelican. Yes i think the slot limits on Northern are working and next year should be a hoot!"
1236337,DanL,2010-09-17 20:37:00,262,We have fished lake Minnitaki for about 15 years. The last few years we have seen the number of pike in and above the slot increase. This year was the best yet with pike up to 41 inches and quite a few others above the slot.
