1097948,Northern Exposure,2009-04-17 14:18:00,29,"I was wondering if any of you guys see caribou, either on shore or in the water, when fishing. The farthest north I have ever been is Savant lake and I didn't see any there. Any idea of how far north you have to go to see them in the spring time(late May)? I would think the guys that fly-in farther north would see them, or am I wrong? Next year I am going to go farther north and one of the things I am hoping for is to see some wild caribou."
1097949,tackleman,2009-04-17 14:34:00,444,between Red Lake and Pikangikum there are several herds of woodland caribou.I have seen them on the ice in the winter but they also are spotted on the road toward Nungessor Lake
1097960,Jimmy Jig,2009-04-17 15:39:00,1905,They have been seen on Lac Suel
1097970,Big Tex,2009-04-17 17:23:00,27,Lots of caribou on the Slater Islands off of Terrace BayI fished the Albany river and never seen any sign of cariboo

1098147,Guest,2009-04-18 20:01:00,0,you don't have to fly or go very far north of red lake ontario Caribou have their calves here on Pine Island on nungesser lake right now they are making their way across the ice out to the island they waint until just before ice out to minimize the number of wolves that find them. they travel in small groups maybe averaging 4 but I've seen as many as 10 or 12 My son hayden who is 6 and I came out to camp today and we saw one caribou by itself and a set of 4 tfresh tracks in the light snow that was fallng. Interesting that we see a lot of wolves between now and the end of june when the caribou start making their way off the island. its kind of fun seeing the caribou walk by the window in the morning between may and july.
1098249,Guest,2009-04-19 08:29:00,0,"I have seen Caribou on Lac Seul in the Southeast section of the lake more than once. Sorry that I don't have a picture with me, I know the proof is in the pudding or in the picture of the said creature along a recognizable section of Lac Seul shoreline. The last time was 3 years ago. Late August surprisingly. I moved slowly into a bay for sneak attack at trophy pike (none to be found on that trip), but we did see a beautiful male on the top of the hill at the back of the little bay (more like a pocket). I continued down the shoreline into the next pocket, and the caribou worked its way down the backside of the hill and hid behind a tree. Did I mention that the tree was 4 inches wide, and the caribou only hid it's eyes behind the tree. I think it believed if I can't see them, they can't see me. We stayed back and let it swim away to the next shoreline. I call the area 'center of the world' other people might call it Mclean's bay. coordinates of the spot are: 50'21'13,18 by 92, 6, 53, 19 Dragon out"
1098316,Fishoil,2009-04-19 11:05:00,1277,I fish about 60 miles north of Savant Lake and we occasionally see one there.
1098753,steve03,2009-04-20 15:34:00,22,"I agree with kgeary, Nungesser is a great place to see caribou. We see some evey year and we go in late June-early July. We have seen them swim across the water many times. It is a great place to see them, with great walleye and pike fishing all year long."
1099530,Guest,2009-04-23 10:28:00,0,Hayden and I were out ice fishing for pike on Monday we saw a group of 10 caribou right behind camp. A few hour later one ran right up to us on the lake. came within about 40 yards She didn't seem to wan to go into the bush we took a bunch of pictures some good ones with hayden and the caribou in the same frame. can you post pics on here?? anhybody know how? later when we were going home we saw another group of 5 Oh yeah we caught about 8 pike no monsters but Hayden enjoyed everyone of them. still over 2 feet of good ice. plenty of snow in the bush. supposed to snow again this weekend. not looking good for ice out
