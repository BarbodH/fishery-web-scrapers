1098894,Guest,2009-04-21 06:02:00,0,"MartyT You are missing a chance to fish a excellent Walleye/Northern lake that Dave has to offer his guest and guess what it's FREE. Peffleys has a boat on a private lake about a 30 minute walk through the bush that has a lot of large Walleyes and Northerns, I know as I have fished it several times with great success. The experence will be very close to a fly in ( which I have also experienced ) and it's free to Peffleys guest. July is the best time to fish this lake and yes I have fished it in July. You need to talk with Dave about this adventure, put your billfold away and enjoy."
1098935,MartyT,2009-04-21 08:20:00,23,"Thanks, I fully intend to use Peffley's portage lake for at least one day. Was looking at the fly-in as an added ""adventure"" for our vacation."
1096937,MartyT,2009-04-14 09:35:00,23,"Taking the wife and 2 kids for their first trip to Canada this summer, staying at Peffley's on Wabaskang Lake in late July.Considering a one-day fly-out to a remote walleye lake, figuring it'd add a bit of adventure to the trip - but don't know where to go or what outfitter to use. (Or, for that matter, how much I'd expect to pay for 4 people on a trip like that). Suggested lakes? Insights? Recommended outfitters that would pick us up at Wabaskang Lake? Things to avoid? Cost?Thanks!"
1096970,Glenman12,2009-04-14 11:32:00,762,"Your resort owner should be able to set that up for you...ours has a list in the lodge with the name of the lake, the distance and the cost per person"
1097028,Guest,2009-04-14 14:53:00,0,"faron buckler at excellent adventure in ear falls has some boat cache one-day flyin lakes where fishing is ""like it used to be"" - we've been to rainfall and zinzania(sp??) lakes - incredible! phish"
1097091,Oldschool,2009-04-14 18:08:00,163,"Faron and Joyce are just up the road before getting into Ear Falls on Lac Seul. Indeed, they do have some nice daily lakes. Xaxania is the best fishing I have ever had in my life. Several hours of nonstop walleyes in the 20 - 26 inch range. Biggest was 28.5 inches and fat as a hog. Biggest northern that I have ever caught was just over 41 inches from there as well. It's a small lake, and catch and release, so the fishing should still be good now. Also used them to go to Broken Mouth. Also a small lake, but it has great fishing as well. There are others in that same area before Ear Falls, so you can look around. I agree that the lodge will set you up. I was told this year to expect $175 -$200 per person per day. Pretty steep, but the family will remember it forever; no question. I am looking to take my 9 year old grandson on a trip this year as well. I don't like the cost, but I will absolutely love the memories. Good luck, and I hope you have a great time up there. Roy"
1097198,Skywagon,2009-04-15 06:24:00,1106,"Oldschool,I was interested in the lake you mentioned, Xaxania. Could not find it listed anywhere and Excellent Adventures site did not make mention of it. Is that the correct spelling and do you know where it is located in relation to a town and or Lac Seul? I realize there may not be a road to it. Thanks for any thoughts."
1097269,teddi,2009-04-15 09:47:00,349,the lake is possibly zizina [wrong spelling]. it is south and west of ear falls. a little north of wabaskang. there is a road to the lake [close]. i know this because i have a boat on the lake and drive to it.
1097421,Oldschool,2009-04-15 17:16:00,163,"I took the spelling from the receipt given when we did the trip. I just looked it up on the MNR map section, and they list it is Zizania; change the Xs to Zs. The outline of the lake is correct as the east side has 3 finger bays, one of which held pure gold after several days of a westerly wind. The location is just as teddi said. It's just a short flight from Lac Seul. I know that there was no developed road right to the lake, but there was a logging road not far from it when we flew in. It's been 4 or 5 years since I have been there, but there was a canoe on shore in where a creek entered the lake. There were at least 2 outfitters using the lake when I was there, as there was another cache of resort boats half way up the lake. Never did hear the name of that lodge. A couple of phone calls up there will get some nice information and actual rates. http://themnrstore.mnr.gov.on.ca/eng...=2015460055900 Above is a link to the MNR map site where Zazania can be found. There may be other, better sites, but I do know that this one has the lake listed. Roy"
1097429,teddi,2009-04-15 18:02:00,349,my boat is down in the north west end past the creek. it should be on shore close to the trappers cabin. the whole lake has very very good fishing and is well worth the flight.
1098641,MartyT,2009-04-20 10:33:00,23,"Thanks all for the replies. I contacted Faron at Excellent Adventures, they won't pick us up at Peffley's camp, and getting to their place from Peffley's at the crack of dawn is quite a challenge - 20 or 30 minutes by boat back to the vehicles, and then another 45 by car. So still looking for one that will pick us up at the camp. Dave Peffley said he's used Wilderness Air (http://www.great-fishing.com/) in the past. They sent me a rate sheet and it seemed a bit high. Guess I'll have to think on it a while..."
1098643,teddi,2009-04-20 10:39:00,349,try little beaver in ear falls. they have boats on the lake.
