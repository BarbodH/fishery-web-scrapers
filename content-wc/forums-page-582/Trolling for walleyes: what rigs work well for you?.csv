1100128,Moondog,2009-04-25 21:07:00,362,We have had some pretty bad experiences with Vanish......mostly knots that break. When we were salt water fishing in Florida it was pretty much taboo to use Vanish. Those old guys down there turned us on to Power Pro and we have been using that exclusively in Canada with a fluorocarbon leader........usually Yo Zuri or Seagar with much better results......few breakoffs or knot failures.
1100178,fisher_i_am,2009-04-26 08:19:00,498,some pics of the rigs would be nice to see and add a bit the thread... I use only one hook with maybe a beed on a lindy weight so my pics are not to interesting. considering trying more spinner rigs with crawlers as leach prices are up there
1100199,hawg,2009-04-26 09:15:00,2008,"Wow, sounds like some of you are shark trolling."
1092090,brwhite,2009-03-29 12:25:00,41,"I've been building my own trolling rigs for a few years and I'm wondering what setups people prefer. I started with the ones in the area stores with ~30 lb test with a hook, some beads, and a spinning blade. This gets hooked to the in-line 1 to 2 oz swivel weight.I've now moved to 3 way swivels with a weight off one and the leader off the other.I've made rigs with metal line and also stingers attached.This year I've made up a bunch of florocarbon rigs to see if that works any better.Just wondering what else is out there to try and if anyone thinks some methods are clearly better than others.Man I'm getting some serious canadian blue balls... just a little over 2 more months!"
1092098,ILScott,2009-03-29 13:01:00,139,"I use 20lb Fireline for more rigs. I make them about 36""-40"" long with a aberdeen hook, cooper or silver hammered colorado blades and beads. When I fish with them I use a bottom bouncer and make sure the bottom bouncer just ticks the ground. /walleye all the time and once you find them you can jig for them.Scott"
1092111,Pooch,2009-03-29 14:23:00,4619,"I pretty much agree with ILScott with the exception being that I use Vanish fluorocarbon in 12 and 17# test. I truly believe the fluorocarbon makes a difference most of the time. I store my pre-tied rigs in small zip lock 3x4"" bags from WW Grainger. Wife bought me some bags from a craft store two years ago and they were crap. Pooch"
1093173,Guest,2009-04-01 13:01:00,0,"I'm with you guys that tie our own rigs. Gives me satisfaction knowing I made it and it works as well or better than store bought rigs. I am not a bottom bouncer guy, but fish with people that swear by it and it comes down to how do you like to fish. Personally, it is not for me. My question to you guys are where do you find a nice selection of beads? I prefer using the larger size that you don't normally find on the premade rigs you would buy at gander or Cabelas."
1093236,cprost,2009-04-01 15:59:00,102,"Michael's, Hobby Lobby. etc. carries beads."
1093264,drlee,2009-04-01 17:15:00,409,"In 1957, I started trolling for walleyes with the equivalent of a little joe spinner (in a variety of colors), with a bead/chain sinker, usually about 1 oz. Still doin' it and still catchin' walleyes. Gotta love it!"
1093538,Pooch,2009-04-02 16:21:00,4619,"drlee,Remember the old June Bugs and Prescott spinners. They still catch bunches of walleye on any given day. My largest walleye ever was caught on my home made Prescott knockoff and minnow.Bullet sinker ahead of a spinner rig catches lots of fish and the occasional rock.Pooch"
1093661,Steve of Madison,2009-04-02 21:32:00,230,"I have been tying my own spinner rigs for several years now. I have tried Power pro so the northerns aren't biting me off but the line is too limp and easily tangles. I use 17# florocarbon now. I discovered that if I'm going to pull a minnow rig (single hook) that a #2 heavy wire red TruTurn works great. Hooks them in the corner of the mouth everytime and rarely do I miss or short strike, something about that little bend. That reminds me, need to buy some more beads."
1094137,bpetersen,2009-04-04 22:00:00,251,I have purchase beads off Ebay for several years and at a very good price.
1100121,worthsr,2009-04-25 20:26:00,52,"We have always used the steel wire rigs. I'm making a few this year for the first time. I found everything I need at Bass Pro Shops. The steel is hard to work with but it holds up well and doesn't get all twisted. I'm a little nervous about how well they will hold up, so I'm just making some for myself. If they hold up I'll share with the others next year."
