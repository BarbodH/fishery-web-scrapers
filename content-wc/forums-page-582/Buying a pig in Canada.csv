1099344,GNO,2009-04-22 18:32:00,153,Cloverleaf Grocery in Emo would be able to set up if you run into any trouble finding one. They have a butcher shop on site and will take care of you.
1099077,MTP1882,2009-04-21 18:41:00,2,"Alright, I know this is a really unusal question but I am going to ask any ways.Our group is going to Chamberlain Narrows the first week in July and would like to do a pig roast one of the nights. I have already discussed it with the owners of the camp and they are on board, they even offered to provide us with a spit. We are all from New York so throwing a pig on an airplane is not a good option and we rather not drive the thing up in a cooler 1500 miles. I was wondering if anyone knew a place between Fort Francis and Sioux Lookout where we could purchase one??? If so please provide contact information if available.Thanks for your help."
1099163,Skywagon,2009-04-22 06:59:00,1106,"I just did a little quick research and did not come up with anything in the local phone book or google search. Here in Canada, a meat processer is known as an abattoir. I assume you want a smaller whole pig that is skinned. I was of the impression at one time there was such a place west of Dryden, but not sure that it still exists. Not really much livestock around here other than a few cattle. Hopefully VBay Gord will read this and might have some insight to if there is anyone doing that out his way. I will make a couple of local inquiries today."
1099170,Larry Mac,2009-04-22 07:21:00,530,"Hi MTP 1882, You guys from New York really know how to throw a party. You probably already asked but I would think your camp owner should be able to help, maybe even have it there waiting for your group. If he has the spit he might have had a pig on it at some point in time. You and your group have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1099183,tackleman,2009-04-22 07:55:00,444,"Well it just so happens that a friend of mine is a pig farmer and he lives just outside of Dryden, If you come up through fort frances to dryden on 502 you are just a few kilometers from his farmwhen you hit the junction of 502 and the road behind the papermill, basically where you have to turn right to go to dryden, you turn left and follow that road until you get to Wall Street. Turn left and go to the farm on the right hand side, it's about 1 kilometer down the road.My friend is Bob Wall and he provides pigs for pig roasts and will even roast it for you if so desired. you can reach Bob at 807-937-4357."
1099189,v-bay gord,2009-04-22 08:01:00,3168,"You can buy a pig, ready to go, from Robert Wall.......1-807-937-4357. He is licenced and is located just west of Dryden on Hwy 594 (turn at ""Wall St""). You could continue on from there and get out on Hwy 17 by Eagle River. The pig roast idea sounds like fun......"
1099196,@Lunker,2009-04-22 08:28:00,835,"Dang, can I bring a dish to pass and my own beer?"
1099207,Skywagon,2009-04-22 08:58:00,1106,"Sounds like Tackleman and Gord have you covered. If that does not work out, you might try calling Griffiths Country Meats at Oxdrift 807-937-6716."
1099211,cast_and_blast,2009-04-22 09:12:00,1098,Would the pig need a passport? Scott
1099237,MTP1882,2009-04-22 10:25:00,2,"Thanks a lot everyone! I will get in touch with Bob Wall and see what he can do for us.We are always looking for something new to try out, it should be a good time."
