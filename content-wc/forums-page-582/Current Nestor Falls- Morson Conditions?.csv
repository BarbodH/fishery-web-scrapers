1099403,J-Man,2009-04-22 23:06:00,191,"I was up at the lake on Sunday (4/19.) I would be surprised if it went out before May 1. There was a very little amount of slush around the shoreline of our bay, but there wasn't anything break up and only some blackness on the ice. It's been chilly during the day since Monday and still freezing temps at night.I should be up to Morson again in the next day or two and can post when iI see what has happened since Sunday."
