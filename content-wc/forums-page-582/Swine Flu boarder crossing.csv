1100849,Guest,2009-04-28 15:56:00,0,What do you think will happen trying to cross the Canadian boader if this thing swine flu thing gets any worse? I just crossed the boader today heading to Red Lake and was asked some different questions.

1101010,Guest,2009-04-29 08:19:00,0,"Thanks Bill, it's good to be back in Canada. Do you still got alot of snow, I heard the ice was still 30in. in places. Vbay gord spelling was never my strong point. Common sense might be thought I got out of the tourist business when I saw that my guest not being able to get across the boarder controled my years end. Along with DUI's Passports late ice and maybe now the threat of the swine flu crossing boarders this could be a tough year for my friends still in the business. Tackleman I can tell you two questions they didn't ask me, was how much beer and cigarettes I had, that's a first. Stop over for beer new address # 9 Mcneely Bay."
1101035,v-bay gord,2009-04-29 09:46:00,3168,"Bill.....the question you pose regarding the border and swine flu implies that further restrictions on who can cross is a possibility. My take on this, and such a question being raised, is that rather than being a common sense approach, it is alarmist and without any basis of fact. There are already enough issues at the border, as you so rightly point out, without creating new ones. That is my irritation with your post. Your spelling is creative, but not out of place on a fishing forum."

I think swine flu is being blown out of proportion. That said, the governments don't have a history of using logic to make their decisions. So, hopefully nothing will happen... but never count them out!"
