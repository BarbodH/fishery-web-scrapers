1099012,Five Lakes Lodge,2009-04-21 13:49:00,4,"The local cell phone service provider in the Gullrock Lake (and Red Lake) area is TBay-Tel (www.tbaytel.net or call toll-free 1-800-264-9501). Incidentally; all cell phone towers in the Red Lake area (including the Gullrock tower) have now been converted to digital.A few months back I contacted TBay-Tel to inquire about coverage in this area for other service carriers. I was told that Sprint does have roaming contracts with TBay-Tel; Verizon also has contracts in place with TBay_Tel but you should check with your provider to ensure your phone is properly set-up (Verizon may have to change the ""PRL"" number on certain models). US Cellular does not currently have any roaming contracts with TBay-Tel. Hope this helps."
1099068,Moondog,2009-04-21 17:54:00,362,That is super information. That means we should have cell phone coverage at South Bay with our Verizon phone. Will take our phone into Verizon and see if the PRL number needs to be changed. Thanks for finding out this info. We have been using wi-fi and Marys satellite phone to check for messages from home for the last 2 years. Really appreciate your effort.

As mentioned before, phones with both annalog and digital are more likely to get reception. The casio ""boulder"" gz'one works great. (and it's water proof) Double check w/ your carrier about costs. Verizon has the US and Canada plan which I use, and it saves me a ton of money."

1087013,Steve of Madison,2009-03-10 21:44:00,230,"AMEN to that!!!!Top priority for me when I go to CA is that when the phone rings......I know it's not for me!!!!!! Because if it was, nothing I'm going to do about it anyway!Good grief, boys and thier toys."
1087059,Mohleye,2009-03-11 07:18:00,368,Ever since I've had a cell phone I've told people it doesn't work in Canada. I don't anticipate telling anyone anything different.
1087066,Pooch,2009-03-11 07:31:00,4619,That's my story too and I'm sticking to it. Now as long as we all tell the same lie it should work. Pooch
1087144,Lundexp,2009-03-11 11:29:00,901,Amen. I do bring my verizon GzOne with me to the lake of the woods just in case but almost always have it shut off because it's always roaming and drains the battery quick.
1087371,joepa,2009-03-12 07:41:00,366,"I have always used my On Star to call from Quebec, worked every time."
1098650,Jigmatt,2009-04-20 10:53:00,9,I have Alltel as a provider and am able to get signal on Keg lake and the north end of Gullrock....not a great signal but good enough to call home once or twice.
1098693,Opti-Mist,2009-04-20 12:20:00,1402,"It is my understanding (doesn't mean 100% right) that CDMA systems (e.g. Verizon, Alltel, Sprint) are only used in the US. The rest of the world used the GSM system (as does AT&T, Cingular, Quest, et al). The systems don't work together. If you have a CDMA system, it will not work in Canada unless you are near the boarder. When I had a Verizon CDMA phone, it barely worked at the boarder."
1072933,Fishin Fun,2009-01-10 18:54:00,218,Are there any cell phone providers in the U.S. that work in the Red Lake area? Looks like Verizon wireless has limited coverage in Ontario. Anyone know?
1073046,joeman79,2009-01-11 10:10:00,417,I know my altell phone did not work at Red Lake.
1073069,Juls,2009-01-11 11:21:00,13414,"Try contacting the Visitor's Bureau or Chamber closest to where you will be staying.Depending on the size of the nearest city, they might be able to give you some info on renting a cell phone up there. You pay a deposit, use it, return it, and then they bill your your credit card when the final bill is ready.Worth looking into. That way you don't have to change your cell phone provider just for this one trip.When I went to Dryden last year I rented a cell phone from the local phone company in town.Just a thought...Juls"
1073091,2746,2009-01-11 13:45:00,3206,"My verizon has always worked in Red Lake and to the south at Gullrock. I was told that analog works, digital does not and my phone is both. That was true last summer but was also told that they were upgrading to digital in that area.....just don't know when. If you have a camp reserved or know one you could ask them."
1073168,Guest,2009-01-11 20:06:00,0,In the Ear Falls area my Sprint phone worked in analog mode.
1073218,Moondog,2009-01-12 09:04:00,362,Two years ago we had a digital Verizon phone at Gullrock and it did not work. We were told that only analog would be able to get reception. So last year we talked our local Verizon dealer into letting us use our old analog phone and it didn't work either. Stopped at the local cell phone dealer in Red Lake and were told that we were SOL either way. Very disconcerting.
1073230,AllenW,2009-01-12 09:49:00,11482,"Same here, Verizon and Nokia phone, staying at the Chukuni River campgrounds we would get service, had to walk around a little sometimes to get a better signal though.My understanding is the Nokia's have better reception than some others, but I have no way to prove that.Al"
1073233,Golden Eagle,2009-01-12 09:53:00,2642,My Verizon works in Red Lake with roaming charges. Would use it only for an emergency. Won't work at the camp I fly to.Many camps have wireless internet service and that's been working fine for me. Check e-mail once a day and go fishing. It's nice to get a radar report on the weather. Lets me know whether to fish up the lake or down the lake on certain days. Or pack my rain gear and just go fishing.
1073737,Pooch,2009-01-14 14:29:00,4619,"My older Verizon LG 4500 phone works while near the major towns on the way to Red Lake. It is digital and I assume will work on an analog system. The problem I had two years ago is that Verizon ""revised"" my plan and even though I had a signal in Canada I could not make or receive a call. Back home local Verizon store said that I should have been able to use the phone as I had in the past. Next trip it worked fine. I assume an employee made an error when he re-programed my phone earlier. Talk to your local Verizon store and ""pin them down"" and make them show you it will (depending on your plan) work out of the country. ie Mexico and Canada. I also had a signal in Eleuthera a couple years ago, but could not use the phone. It's not a perfect world out there in cell land! Pooch"
1073739,Golden Eagle,2009-01-14 14:45:00,2642,"With a Verizon plan, dial: *228 listen for the message, then press option ""2"" to upgrade your ability to receive from new towers. Stay on the line while it's upgrading and then your phone will shut down and then restart. I do it every time before taking a trip."
