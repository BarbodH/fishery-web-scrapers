1099680,bardern,2009-04-23 22:00:00,28,"I live on the St. Lawrence near Morrisburg which is south of Ottawa. IMHO the fishing on the st. lawrence is on a par, or perhaps better, with Quinte. we were pulling 5 fish limits in under 1/2hr last spring with fish running up to 12pds! top three in Eastern Ontario1. Lake St. Lawrence (head pond for Moses Saunders Hydro generation). middle stretch Iroquois-Cornwall. lots of fish potential of huge 12+pds2.Lake St. Francis great numbers.3.Quinte - still cold water King still absolutely amazing just before freeze-up"
1100345,Taurcan,2009-04-26 19:48:00,6,"Thanks guys I really like the looks of the Arnprior area for the Madawaska and the Ottawa Rivers. The St Lawrence has been attracting me as well. I presume from your email Barden, that you believe that the best fishing is downstream from Prescott. We've looked at homes, in Cardinal, Iroquois, and Morrisburg.All of these areas seem to be multi species, which is another advantage. Any further thoughts or refinements, keep them coming.ThanksTaurcan"
1100422,bardern,2009-04-27 08:33:00,28,I wouldn't say that Prescott and down river is significantly better its just convienent for me and I fish here a lot.1000 Islands has outstanding fishing and St.Francis is no sloutch either.
1098185,Taurcan,2009-04-18 22:11:00,6,"What would you consider to be your top 3 lakes or rivers in Eastern Ontario, within say, 80 miles of Ottawa, that have the best Walleye potential? I currently live in Kitchener, and will be moving to the Ottawa area.We want to locate on a lake or river that has a decent potential for Walleye.Up to 80 miles or 1.5 hours of driving to Ottawa would keep my wife happy as it's a lot closer than our current drive of 5.5 hours to see the Grandkids!Any help would be appreciated. Just need to know the lakes or rivers. I don't expect to get your Honey-hole.Thanksand keep a tight line!Taurcan"
1098226,retire55,2009-04-19 07:47:00,1029,"Regardless where in the Ottawa area you choose to live, the best walleye fishery by far in Eastern Ontario is the Bay of Quinte. Indeed, its a trophy walleye fishery each year during the months of Oct, Nov and Dec when the big walleyes migrate from Lake Ontario into the Bay of Quinte in preparation for the spring spawn. However, its 160 miles from Ottawa. You might better consider walleye fishing in Quebec. Some possible locations are the Réserve Baskatong or La Vérendyre Park. Both locations are approximately 100 miles from Ottawa."
1098237,Guest,2009-04-19 08:14:00,0,"You will be close to White Lake, which is excellent for panfish, fair to good for northerns and bass but mediocre at best for walleyes."
1098244,Taurcan,2009-04-19 08:19:00,6,"Thanx for the Reply. Familiar with Quinte and it's reputation.If I live in Ottawa or Kitchener, it's a 2.5 hr drive to Quinte.As an Anglo, although I had relatives in Trois Rivieres in 1650, I don't think I would feel welcome living in, or around, the small towns and villages of rural Quebec.Don't get me wrong. When I travel in Quebec, I stay in B&B's and still practice my high school French from 45 years ago. A spring chicken may hack it, but this old dog, just ""ain't"" about to start over.I'm still trying to find the ""best of the worst"" around Arnprior, Renfrew, etcThanks againTaurcan"
1098252,Taurcan,2009-04-19 08:29:00,6,"Thanx RSH8 White Lake was indeed one of the possibilities we were considering. I appreciate you helping to cross it off my list. My wife immediately saw the ""excellent panfish"" remarkand thought it a great place. My answer was that ""our grandchildren are not going to always want to catch panfish"" Jeeesh! That was close!Thanks againTaurcan"
1098553,Superdad,2009-04-20 07:47:00,64,"I would agree with the Bay of Quinte as the BEST in eastern Ontario. It's a 2.5 hr run down and many from the Ottawa region travel down, especially when the big Mamas are here in the fall. You might want to have a look at www.fish-hawk.net as it's based iin Ottawa and you could get seom comments from there. Cheers"
1098582,McQ,2009-04-20 08:39:00,615,"Interesting take on this area - being resident here for the better part of 40 years and all my life in eastern Ontario & western Quebec I've found the St. Lawrence, Ottawa & Rideau river systems will offer as good a multi specie opportunity as any other waters in the country. The potential for great walleye fishing is very high within a 40 mile radius of the city of Ottawa. I fish Quebec extensively, mostly for the remote access but have enjoyed many a day on the Ottawa & Rideau systems. Within a 2 1/2 hour drive you can cover off the St. Lawrence from Montreal to eastern Lake Ontario, all of the Rideau from Ottawa to Kingston and the Ottawa from Montreal to Pembroke. Hundreds of miles of area with launching facilities in every village, town and city along their routes. I'm biased of course but there is no finer place to be for the best, fishing has to offer."
1098803,Taurcan,2009-04-20 18:05:00,6,"Thanks to Superdad and McQ Never fished Quinte but would love to. After the Easter weekend on the following Tuesday, and looking at 2 homes on the St Lawrence,we drove along HWY 2 and 33 into Picton. Then up to Belleville.Knowing the reputation of Quinte, I had a perpetual fisherman's drool, ,as I drove past many of those waters. I'd never get my wife to settle down 2.5 hours from Ottawa. I might get her 1.5 hrs tops, away from our grandkids in Ottawa. Therefor McQ, what say you? Ottawa R, Madawaska R or a better lake? Looked at the Rideau lakes. Of the 3 areas which is the best, or is there a better choice within those areas?I really appreciate your knowledge, and expertise guys. Love to fish with you someday!ThanksTaurcan"
1098823,FISH HUNTER,2009-04-20 19:14:00,161,Mississippi Lake is near Ottawa and from what I hear has a decent walleye population. FISH HUNTER
1098893,McQ,2009-04-21 06:01:00,615,"So many variables to consider! If you're trailering a boat it really doesn't matter where you hang your hat at night. I'm not a big fan of any of the lakes in the region, too much development and limited walleye fishing. Now, the river systems are very productive so any area around Ottawa is a good choice. Arnprior, with access to the Ottawa & Madawaska would be top of the list for me, a very close second would be locating on the Rideau system somewhere around Kemptville. It is my experience that the Ottawa river east of the Chaudiere Falls right down to Hawksbury is prime for walleye, much more so than the upper reaches so you may consider the Rockland area too. My thoughts are do what is best for your particular basic needs, family etc. because regardless the choice you will find yourself having access to everything within a reasonable and short drive. As an aside I live directly across the river from Ottawa east in Gatineau and have enjoyed the company of my francaphone neighbours for 25+ years with narry an issue or problem and yes I'm still unilingual English with a smattering of franglais to get myself in trouble."
