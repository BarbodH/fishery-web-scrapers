1100248,scar,2009-04-26 12:40:00,196,Heard some rumors that ontario may have or is close to passing new regulations requiring boater certification needed. All boaters would need to pass a test. is this true? what ages? everyone required? thanks for any information.

In the end, it's pretty much what it was criticized for in the beginning--a money grab! NWO Fishing Bum p.s., there are some important tidbits in the certification course if you're travelling through marked channels with buoys, in high-traffic areas, etc., that may be useful for somebody that has never boated, but its applicability in northwestern Ontario (NWO) is virtually nil."
