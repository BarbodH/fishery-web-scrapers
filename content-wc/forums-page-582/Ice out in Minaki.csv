Shawny Bay might even produce. Nto sure how we will guide ourselfs without Dinger? I guess wewill manage."

Hope to find some crappie as we did one year. Caught a 14 incher last year. My partner is threatening to haul us up to Rough Rock one day. Do not have much confidence there, except caught 3 muskies in about 15-20 minutes fishing tubes for smallmouth once, while my brother was thowing a muskie bucktail without a follow at the same time. Good luck to everyone, Don"
