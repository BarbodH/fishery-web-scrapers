1098917,McQ,2009-04-21 06:59:00,615,Your best source for Canadian hydrographic charts is http://www.trakmaps.com/index.php. They are surveying and increasing the portfolio available on a continuing basis. Their charts are also available from a host of resellers but it's easy to order online and depending upon the mail will be in your hands within 10 days.
1098937,MartyT,2009-04-21 08:26:00,23,"Does Trak Maps sell a bunch of maps that aren't listed on the website? Because all I see is a few maps for Lac Seul, Wabigoon and Manitou..."
1098943,McQ,2009-04-21 09:06:00,615,"Just send an email to Trak with any questions you may have - if you don't see what you want they may well have the ability to produce it for you. In the past I've ordered special maps and they were able to get them to me quite quickly. Like any producer they heavily stock the more popular items but have the surveys for most situations.Just to give you an idea - I personally have over 2300 maps for lakes in Quebec but with over 1,000,000 in the province don't have enough lifetimes to fish them all."
1099151,DanM57,2009-04-22 06:26:00,135,I contacted both Trak Maps and canadamapsales.com and neither had the map I was looking for. Any other suggestions or should I just assume I am SOL? I appreciate the help. DanM57
