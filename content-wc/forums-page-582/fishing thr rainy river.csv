1099043,Guest,2009-04-21 16:06:00,0,Fish Rainey and part of the LOW in spring and fall. Ya there is a lot of fishermen. Nice part is if the weather is nasty and LOW is wild you can fish the river. Lots of spots.Never been disappointed. We us to fish Rainey for spring walleyes the first of April. Weather can be very cold but the catch was super.Ice floating in the river. Fished Clementson and Birchdale. Good luck
