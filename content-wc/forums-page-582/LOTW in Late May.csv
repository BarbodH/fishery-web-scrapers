I have never been up there this early in the year and wanted to fish for pike and walleye. Any help on what to use and where to find them (not specific locations but general areas, depths, structure)? I hear obabikon would probably be my best bet for pike. Thanks"

Find the bays with sand beaches and fish them for walleye. There's a huge sand bay on the east side of Dawson and many others scattered around. If you want to take a ride, go west to Pony Island. Another big sand bay there. Should be interesting. Never know what the weather be in late May."
