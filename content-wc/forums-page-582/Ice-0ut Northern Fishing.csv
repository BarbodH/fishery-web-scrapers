We usually target walleyes and most northerns we catch are accidental, so I could use some help in targeting them. I've had some success near rapids and lake shorelines or bays with spoons. I'm guessing south facing muddy bays would be the prime location at this time of year, but what baits would you suggest using? Spinners, plastics, spoons?"
1098467,Pile-It,2009-04-19 21:05:00,3,"2 of the best we have found for pike are, a large Johnson silver minnow (or the knock off look-a-like that Cabelas sells) tipped with a large grub trailer. The grub changes the action from a tight spin to a side to side wobble. or a ""daredevle"" ( pay the extra $$$ for the brand name--they seem to be a little heavier than most spoons and run a foot or 2 deeper than the rest) ...a good thing early if the grass is submerged a little deeper. Make sure the hooks are sharp on the big lures they can dull quicker than the small hook or you'll miss a few hookups."
1100223,Jigmatt,2009-04-26 11:07:00,9,"We fish the big pigs in shallow bays, preferrably the warmest water you can find. We dead bait them. Frozen ciscos beneath a big bobber. This early in the year we've found that the big females aren't in the ""chase"" mode yet. Just sit back and enjoy a warm sunny day! I've caught several over 36"" and the biggest to date is a 44"". This works from the opener to about mid June."
1100299,v-bay gord,2009-04-26 16:58:00,3168,Jigmatt.....I hope you are using a quick strike rig or circle hooks on those ciscoes. Swallowed hooks are a major cause of mortality.
1100343,thib,2009-04-26 19:38:00,3,"Hello,I've haven't fished with dead bait previously but have found some decent resources on how to do it using quick strike rigs. I'm going to be doing a fly-in from Nakina in 3 1/2 weeks and have been thinking this might be worth doing. I did check with my outfietter on the availability of bait and he said Shiners and Chubs were available locally.I have a couple of questions about this though.- How do you guys go about bringing in the dead bait on a fly-in? - If you were going to be using it all week, how many do you think you'd need per person? Thanks,Pete"
