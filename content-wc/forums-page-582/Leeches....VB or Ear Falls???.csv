1100182,Moondog,2009-04-26 08:32:00,362,Wanted: Nice large healthy leeches...........who has the best on the road to Red Lake? Vermillion Bay? In the past we have purchased them in Ear Falls but looking for other/better alternatives and pricing. What say you?
1100186,DanM57,2009-04-26 08:43:00,135,We have been getting our leeches at Bobby's Corner in Vermillion Bay. They aren't great but they are the best we have found.
1100193,Pooch,2009-04-26 08:59:00,4619,"There are a couple bait shops in Ear Falls. One is a gas station and the other is a dedicated sports shop that I can't remember the name of. Others will jump in here with some names for you. Search Ear Falls and you should find some leeches. It doesn't hurt to call ahead a month or more before your trip and see if they will reserve some for you. If it gets hot and dry they can get scarce and pricey. We've cut our use of live bait in about half since leeches and minnows have gotten so expensive and I really think we catch at least as many fish. Plastics do catch fish, but it isn't a given like a spunky leech or other on the hook doing the attracting for you! Good luck. Pooch"
1100216,teddi,2009-04-26 10:45:00,349,"in ear falls the gas station is smittie,s and the sport shop is 4 seasons. they both have what you are looking for"
1100218,Jigmatt,2009-04-26 10:52:00,9,"We don't use many leeches, strickly jig and minnow, but 4 Seasons Sport Shop in Ear Falls is where we buy minnows. Good quality bait and a fair price. The shop is on the right hand side of 105 as you're heading north. Mike and Pam Havenor are the owners."
1100290,JayM5209,2009-04-26 16:18:00,1050,"With no intention of starting an argument or extended debate, but.......For the past six or seven years our group has taken two flats of nightcrawlers along for our week in NW Ontario, and haven't bought/used a minnow or leech during that time. The solid consensus of all six of us is that we've caught and released every bit as many fish as we did when buying minnows. Plus, the crawlers are so much easier to keep lively and healthy.Just my experience. Good fishing to y'all."
1100319,GNO,2009-04-26 18:16:00,153,"If you go the Nestor Falls route, then Anglers Pro Shop in Nestor has good quality and prices. Otherwise, Rainy Lake Sports in Fort Frances usually has good leeches and competitive prices."
1100464,Hump,2009-04-27 10:45:00,578,We always take a ton of crawlers and in the past two years have left behind tons of crawlers. We go to Lac Seul and minnows have out produced the crawler. Never have used a leech.
