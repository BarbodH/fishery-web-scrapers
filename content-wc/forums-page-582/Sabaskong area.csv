1092935,Guest,2009-03-31 18:32:00,0,"J-man, Do you remember if the water was down in 06? I know my brother nicked a rock up there that year when he was right behind me, I couldn't have missed it by much either...haha. We turned around to check it out and it came up to about a foot below the water, I think that was more south of Horseshoe, but can't remember for sure. July 25, I'll be up in Miles for 2 weeks, can't wait!!!"
1092955,J-Man,2009-03-31 19:56:00,191,"Yes, the water level was down in '06 compared to the last couple of years at least. I was muskie trolling in October when my fishing partner was pointing out the lower unit killers. We could barely see two of them and the others were a little bit below the surface. So I didn't see those two with my own eyes, but if this guy says there is a rock there, then it's there. One was fairly close to a shoreline so it shouldn't be a problem for most anglers, but it would be a nasty surprise for a troller coming up on it.I now wish I had gone over and put GPS icons on them. As I said, the area looks like it would be safe to run wide open. YIKES!!"
1093001,rpieske,2009-03-31 23:25:00,1276,"I caught a 28"" walleye casting for muskies on that rock last summer. You are right it is South of Horseshoe Island. There are at least two. One close to shore and the other darn near in the middle. That whole area is good to fish."
1093015,Guest,2009-04-01 02:55:00,0,"Bob, you never know what is going to come off of those rocks, thats for sure. We've had excellent fishing in that area also, although we've never chucked the big baits there. BTW, didn't some people use to mark bad rocks with a white buoy? Haven't seen any for awhile."
1093086,rpieske,2009-04-01 08:43:00,1276,"Some of the camps used to go around and mark rocks with jugs. Some of the markers you see can be nets from the reserves. Since the Canadian government removed a whole bunch of buoys years ago, there are some dangerous rocks that can be hit by unsuspecting boaters. Heck, I hit one about 5 years ago that I KNEW was there, but had a momentary brain fart. Send me an email or PM and I'll give you the GPS numbers for that open water rock you are looking for. I guess you know about that long point that is hittable in the same area. Give me a shout if you are in the Nestor Falls area. I'll send you my local number up there in the email. I'll buy you breakfast some morning."
1093103,alanb,2009-04-01 09:17:00,56,"1shooter, no resort - we've got a place that's been in the wife's family for over 50 years. The core of this group that goes has been making an annual trip since 1971 and the spring opener for 10+ years. I'm the youngster in the group learning the routine for the grandkids. As for underwater rocks, I am always on the lookout and taking it slow the first day out. You never know what could have gotten moved around by the ice over the winter. That giant rock on the southeast corner of Smokehouse Island used to be completely in the water."
1098933,@Lunker,2009-04-21 08:04:00,835,Will the 6214 map cover at least as far west as Manitou Island?
1098950,alanb,2009-04-21 09:29:00,56,Yes. The western edge of the 6214 map covers to the eastern edges of Basil and Painted Rock Islands. Lots of water to the west of Manitou Island is charted. Alan
1089038,J-Man,2009-03-18 13:04:00,191,"Not sure of the exact dimensions of the Hyrographic lake maps, but I can tell you for certain that there is more detail on the Canadian charts than the hot spots maps. Whenever I have put the two side by side for someone new to the area, they always take the 6214 map and put the hot spots map away for emergency back-up.The scale is bigger, rocks are more clearly marked etc. It's really a shame people spend money on those charts when they are coming up to LOTW and could get the good ones. There are other places to buy the 6214 charts as well. Thorne Bros in Fridley has had them and probably Rollie and Helens too, but you could check in the webstores pretty easy and I imagine get it quicker with less shipping. Also, the 6214 map covers more useful area than the hotspots map. Most people fishing Sabaskong and areas out towards Miles, Sunset and Dawson Island have to use 2 of the hot spots maps to get the same thing you get on one superior quality Canadian Hydrographic map. MAKE SURE YOU DON'T WASTE MONEY ON A DIFFERENT MAP!!"
1089058,rpieske,2009-03-18 14:50:00,1276,"Lots of good advice above. Here is some more.... I live in Nestor Falls, which you will be passing through on your way to the Young's launch area. I get up there about May 15th. I fish Stony, Stevens and Sabaskong from May to mid Sept. each year. Been fishing this area for over 50 years. Give me a shout through Personal Message or email and I'll help you out with marking your map for you. I'll give you my phone number in Nestor Falls so we can meet. Who knows....if I don't have any company at the time I might even take you out for a day of fishing. Just let me know. Good luck."
1089064,Dipstick,2009-03-18 15:29:00,101,"I have both of the maps mentioned. You will find the 6214 much easier to follow and more accurate. It is extremely clear when following it in the boat. Can't say that about the Hot Spots. Too much info crammed onto the map. However, I enjoy reading the Hot Spots and jog my memory every once in a while when looking for a new spot. Get 6214 for navigation and Hot Spots for reading material. The Hydrographic Chart 6214 measures as follows: Complete chart with side panels is 32.5"" by 31"" There is a chart on each side, measuring 21"" by 28"" It covers from Nestor Falls west to the west end of Miles Bay The adjacent chart showing areas west of Miles Bay is 6215. If you are only going as far as Miles Bay or Obabikon, then 6214 will be good. Tight Lines"
1089166,alanb,2009-03-18 22:43:00,56,"Thanks for the valuable feedback. I was guessing that the Hot Spot map should be a backup to the 6214 chart, which J-Man and Dipstick confirmed. Going to order mine tomorrow morning."
1089168,Guest,2009-03-19 00:24:00,0,Thanks for all the input guys. I have already ordered the hydro map after my last post. went right to the website and called the 800 number and gave the cc # and its on its way. Thanks for the input on the other types of maps also. Its 2 am and im on a business trip and cant sleep thinking about this trip!!! thanks also for the personal help from some of you and i will be in touch pm'ing before i leave for the trip. Thanks again and i hope i sleep this time!!!!!!!!
1092586,1shooter,2009-03-30 21:05:00,1493,what number Hydrographic Chart would you get for the Miles Bay area. We fish out of the Grassy Narrows resort.
1092607,J-Man,2009-03-30 22:43:00,191,"6214 should give you enough area to fish for about 25 years!However, Grassy is towards the west edge of that map, so you may want to get 6215 as well. I always have both in my boat because you never know where you might end up when you are out muskie hunting. If you get as far as the west side of Miles, you're more than halfway to some more goodies further west.Dang, I wish I was out there looking for the big one right now. Instead, I'm trying to pick up some cheap baits on ebay and keep getting outbid. If the OP is getting as far as Miles Bay and Obakikon, he might want to consider staying in the Morson area next time and save a bunch of traveling time; both in the truck and on the water. I HATE FISHING HOT SPOT MAPS!! Sorry, had to get that off my chest one more time. BTW: Jared's advice about GPS and map chip are right on. Worth the price of the handheld colour unit and chip if you don't have one already. If you end up liking the area and plan to return, one for the boat would be an excellent idea as well. Go for the colour though. I only used the monochrome for a year before I went to a colour unit. One look at the difference in a buddy's boat and I was shopping for a good price on the colour.Have a great trip."
1092703,alanb,2009-03-31 08:54:00,56,"I called and ordered my 6214 map on the 20th. They quoted 2 to 6 weeks delivery, which was explained as a standard lead time, but it arrived in less than a week. $20 + $6 shipping & handling fee. WOW! What a difference in detail - shoreline, reefs, bottom type, depth, depth contours, etc.. We're based out of the north end of Miles Bay and I found details on 3 spots right around Smokehouse Island that WILL be checked out this year. It would have been dumb luck to find them otherwise. J-Man I now share your opinion on the Hot Spots Maps. I guess my old Hot Spot map could still serve a purpose as water-proof tinder for an emergency fire or emergency toilet paper!"
1092799,J-Man,2009-03-31 12:19:00,191,"AlanB: I'm glad we have you converted!! I'm sure the fishing hot spots maps are great for lakes that have no other map options, but they are pretty much only good for what you just said when you can buy a hydro map of LOTW.Be careful up in Miles Bay. Even the hydro maps aren't perfect. In 2006, I fished quite a bit in Miles with a good friend that has spent many many years prowling around up there and he point out at least 4 bad reefs NOT on the map. I don't have access to my map right now, but they were in the area south of horseshoe that otherwise looks like it would be a good travel route to the west side of Miles.If you haven't already found them, check with your outfitter to see if they can mark them for you. If not, I'd be glad to point out what I was shown and saw with my own eyes if you are launching from Morson. I'm around the resort 99% of the time. I didn't get them on my GPS so I can't offer co-ordinates or I would post them for everyone."
1092919,1shooter,2009-03-31 17:38:00,1493,What resort you guys stay at?
1088525,Guest,2009-03-16 19:43:00,0,"Hello all toothy critter hunters! Im taking my brother fishing for the first time. I have been in the red lake area a few times but i chose to take him to youngs wilderness camp in early june. looking for a little help like do you recommend getting a map of the area now and studying it? Are there alot of obstructions to loose props, lower units, brothers etc??? I need to tell you that the only way we know how to fish is to cast shorelines pretty much, sounds silly on a walleye board but we wont be fishing for walleye except for a dinner or two. Smallies and northerns will be the targets and by looking at the maps stony bay and stevens bay stick out as potential targets. I see obabikon lake is not too far (on a map) is it hard to get to?? looks like shallower, potentially warmer water for action? Anyway any tips or help on hidden rocks would be greatly appreciated and also any areas that I do not have to cross great expanses of exposed lake are looked at first as i am one to definately respect the water. thanks everyone"
1088557,Obabikon,2009-03-16 21:08:00,2370,"There are quite a few rocks that could do some damage. The investment of a GPS unit and lake chip is worth it. That said... Obabikon Lake (which is just north of my camp) should be pretty easy to get into this year. There's almost double the snow on the ground of an average year. Which, in turn, means a higher water level when that snow melts. There's some excellent northern fishing up there, and several fantastic musky spots... (but those wont' be open in early june) I hope you enjoy your trip... if you're in the area, feel free to stop by the camp with yellow cabins."
1088582,Dipstick,2009-03-16 23:40:00,101,"Maps! Maps! Maps! Get your maps now and you will see how big an area this is, how many islands, reefs, channels there are. Easy to get lost. In a rain or mist, all the islands look the same and the channels disappear. GPS and a lake chip are recommended. I now carry ""give-away"" maps in my boat when out there. I have been stopped many times by fishermen who are lost. Some didn't have any sort of map, or the map was in the other boat with their buddies and they got separated. Some left their lodge and went around the islands and couldn't find their way back. I give them a copy of the map and point them in the right direction. We have even been stopped by guys with a decent map but they were turned around. On a gray day on that lake, it is easy to get turned around if you are not familiar with it. There are reefs all over, especially in Stony and Stevens. They don't call it ""Stony"" for nothing. Getting proper charts of the lake will help get you excited for the trip. There are hundreds of humps that will tempt you. This is big water. It can get rough in a hurry. Lots of long open runs, but also lots of islands and channels to hide behind. Tight Lines"
1088624,Bill Krejca,2009-03-17 07:05:00,6107,"nfg, It would be a good idea to get a map prior to going. It will give you a chance to get more familiar with the area. Keep in mind that it never looks exactly like you picture it on the map. There will be plenty of chances to get turned around, but each day the landmarks will become more familiar. I suggest getting map no. 6214, Sabaskong Bay. Young's will also give you a version of the map, with spots marked to try. Obabikon is maybe 25 miles down the lake. It is a long way to go, depending on your boat, navigation skills/luck, etc, but I go down there a time or 2 each year in the fall when we stay at Young's. Study the map carefully each time you move, not all/many reefs are marked by buoys. It is a great area, good luck. Bill Krejca"
1088719,Dipstick,2009-03-17 11:32:00,101,"nfg I agree that Chart #6214 ( Sabaskong Bay) is the chart to order. The cost is $19.95 Cndn. The charts are high quality, great detail and accurate.

1088752,Guest,2009-03-17 13:22:00,0,"Thanks for all the input, i will be ordering a map asap. Whoa, 25 miles to obabikon, that may rule that out as i do not know the system and i'm sure we can catch fish elsewhere without putting myself in danger. The reefs that some of you speak of, are they generally marked by buoys or other?? i know what you are talking about when you say it all looks the same as i have been the boat waving down people because i bit off a little more than i should have. I do not have a gps unit, is there one you would recommend over others?? i dont want to say money is no object but safety isnt. thanks to all."
1088759,Bill Krejca,2009-03-17 13:58:00,6107,"nfg, If you follow the recommended routes, you should be OK. I would say most reefs are shown on the map and are not marked with buoys. Those that are marked, as well as those shown on the map may have several humps nearby that are not shown, i.e., an ""X"" may be shown indicating one hump when really there are more than one. This is common on most lakes and maps, so it is not peculiar only to LOW. Not to make you unduly nervous, it is not a mine field, but you need to check your map whenever you move to a new spot. This is just good judgement on any body of water. Bill Krejca"
1088775,Obabikon,2009-03-17 14:57:00,2370,Lowrance H20 handheld (color) is the GPS unit I have and love it... (should be a little over $200 bucks) Lakemaster is the chip that I have. It has 1foot contour lines... pretty sweet. (about another $100)
1088883,Dipstick,2009-03-17 21:39:00,101,"Cabela's and other retailers, are selling out the Lowrance LMS-522ci Sonar/GPS in the $449 to $499 range. Add the Navionics North card and you are good to go. The North card also has Red Lake which you said you frequent. You get the benefit of a GPS and sonar making it easy to find your way in all conditions; enables you to find the humps and stay on them; rocks and reefs are marked and those with buoys show you which way to go around them; with the card you build a route right in your unit before you go. Then just follow it. The benefits of a combo unit are unlimited. Viewing screen is larger than an H20, important as you age. By the way, not difficult to get into Obabikon. Really a nice ride. Just make sure you carry enough gas. A GPS with sonar would the trip in more enjoyable than just using a chart. After 3 or 4 days of straight fishing, we always find the trip to Miles Bay ( passing Obabikon ) a nice diversion. It adds some adventure to trip. Tight Lines"
1089032,alanb,2009-03-18 12:34:00,56,"How big (physical dimension) is map #6214 from the Mantoba map store? Is it better detail than the Fishing Hot Spots map for Lake of the Woods Southeast Section? The Fishing Hot Spots map is 24"" x 36"" in physical dimension. We fish Miles Bay and occasionally down to Obabikon Bay. We carry a hand held GPS, but our boats don't have any electronics other than a basic fish finder so getting a chip is of no help. To help if you haven't seen this Fishing Hot Spots map, on one side covers an area on the left side from Miles Island down to Brule Island, and from Saabaskong Bay to the bottom portion of Whitefish Bay on the right side. The other side is all Whitefish Bay up to Yellow Girl Bay. That's a lot of territory covered that we would never use. Thanks for the help. Alan"
