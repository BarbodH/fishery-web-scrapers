4056154,Bowtech84,2015-07-17 12:58:00,572,We fished cedar lake by Grand Rapids a couple weeks ago and all the signs hung up around the lodge stated that no fish over 55cm/22 inches can be harvested. Well when you convert 55cm to inches you come up with 21.65 inches. We were later stopped by the warden on the water and I asked him about it and he said if anybody kept a fish over 21 5/8 inches they are getting ticketed. We don't keep the borderline fish anyway but it was kind of misleading.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

4032105,pjshorthorn,2015-07-08 18:17:00,5654,"Not sure why anyone would keep a 14"" under. Is the fishing that difficult on this lake ? PjShorthorn"
4033217,Bob_Loblaw,2015-07-09 08:03:00,109,"Sounds like they misread the regs, pj. Although those 13 inchers DO make tasty eating...smaller filets crisp up real nice in the hot grease!"
4033289,pjshorthorn,2015-07-09 08:16:00,5654,"I agree that they misunderstood the regs or ignored the regs.......one or the other. My question is/was, why keep a 14"" or under fish vs. a 16""-17"". They taste the same and a fillet can be cut up into smaller pieces to cook however one prefers. It seems that a person could harvest less 16-17"" fish vs. 14"" fish in order to have the same amount of fish for dinner. Just curious...... PjShorthorn"
4053394,alanexpup,2015-07-16 15:45:00,278,HI. we stay 2 weeks now and by the time its over we have had to much fish to eat that we don't want to bring anything back. saves a lot of money and hassle. no dry ice to worry about to find at places along the road. etc etc etc.
4054050,Pooch,2015-07-16 20:52:00,4619,"When I crossed the border ten days ago I had salted leeches and salted minnows and they made me carry them back and dump them in a dumpster on the USA side of the border. I have a letter from the MNR saying that it was OK to bring in dead salted minnows and leeches, but it wasn't worth a hassle so I just did as the border agent told me. They were nice about it, but I sure hated to waste good bait.Not a big deal as this was the first time I've ever been questioned about what type of bait with me in sixty some trips into Canada fishing. Agent asked ""what bait do you have with you?"" and I answered him honestly.Pooch"
4054410,pjshorthorn,2015-07-17 04:34:00,5654,"Your experience just makes me go .....HHHHHMMMMM???? Doesn't make any sense when it is salted bait. Crawlers, I can understand that one if they were packaged improperly in dirt. Was there any kind of explanation as to why you couldn't bring them in when you were told to dump them ? I assume you crossed at I-Falls, is that correct? Thanks for any additional info. PjShorthorn"
4054658,Campcountry,2015-07-17 06:02:00,164,"The regs for walleye in the Winnipeg River system north of Kenora including Minaki stipulate that you can keep walleye between 35 and 45 cm (about 13 3/4 to 17 3/4 inches). I know of someone who misread the regs the ""other"" way and for years only kept fish bigger than 17 3/4."

4027825,fishman10,2015-07-07 09:38:00,226,"There is no way you can be fined for not having flotation devices, if you are not fishing, unless they admitted to fishing without them. Simply tell them ou borrowed some. But it is a safety issue, why wouldn't you not have them? An officer tried to fine me for not having a helmut for my atv. It was in the back of my truck. Didnt happen"
4028049,IA Nate,2015-07-07 10:43:00,12,"We hit one of these roadblocks on this road--perhaps our second Canada trip which would have been 1998(?) and since we had read about it on WC we were prepared. All our fish were packed in clear plastic, with a legal section of skin attached, we had all the fish in one cooler and made sure it as the last thing to go into the truck, we kept all our fishing licenses together in the glove box so they all could be produced at once. We were smart and followed the rules. We were polite to the MNR officer and were checked and back on the road in just a few minutes. Meanwhile the truck next to us were being complete jerks. Didn't have skin on several filets, wrapped everything in freezer paper, could only find a portion of their group's licenses--yet somehow made it all to be the MNRs fault. When they came over and tried to drag us into it they got pissy because we wouldn't side with our ""fellow Americans."" The guys couldn't quite figure out that the more the cussed and yelled, the more infractions the MNR seemed to find. As we were leaving the OP were writing up the driver for not wearing a seat belt..."

4028345,Golden Eagle,2015-07-07 11:51:00,2642,"Wondering about illegal bait, since I salt my own, commercially purchased, tuffy minnows."
4028409,HeHooksHimself,2015-07-07 12:16:00,725,"I have told this story in other posts but it is worth repeating here. About 2010 we were stopped just outside of FF for a check. No problem, we knew we were legal since i had personally counted our fish. We had everything ready for the MNR officer and were shooting the bull and smoking our last Canada cigar when the officer says to me, ""I keep coming up with 17 walleye."" I replied, ""No sir, we only have 16, I am sure of it."" He says, ""Well, you count them with me."" ""One, two, three,...fifteen, sixteen, seventeen."" Sure enough there was 17. Obviously they were frozen together and we screwed up. He asked who was going to declare the extra fish and the three other guys with me suddenly got very interested in the quality of the dandelions along the pulp check pullover. I said, ""Well, it's my truck I guess its me."" He said, ""You know, if you were 5 over or more I would take everything you have here, but since it is obviously a mistake I am just going to issue you a ticket, something like a traffic ticket. However, nothing is cheap here and it will be about $260."" Once he assured me that it would not affect my next trip in the fall I agreed. He took my catch, but only 4 for some reason, and sent us on our way. My group was quite sure the HST refund would cover it but for some reason they only gave us $60 back. Lessons learned: Hooks is no longer allowed to be the one to count the fish in the freezer. Whoever is in charge of counting the fish should never let them freeze together. Treat the officers with respect, have your stuff ready and cooperate. Try not to take your truck to Canada. Become a dandelion scientist so the dandelion inspection seems to make sense if you have trouble. If your trip costs you an extra couple hundred bucks take it in stride. Fish On! Hooks"
4028545,Golden Eagle,2015-07-07 13:31:00,2642,Better if each dandelion scientist puts his own initials on his own pack of fish.
4028905,IA Nate,2015-07-07 15:02:00,12,"One year we had counted and counted several times and knew we could keep three more fish on the very last day. So we caught our three, cleaned them, packaged them and into the freezer. Then counted again. One over. Could not for the life of us figure out how we were one over. Then we noticed one package was different than the rest. Somebody else in camp had found themselves one fish over and chucked the extra filet package into our basket. The next year we had a newer cabin with a freezer large enough to keep all our own fish. We never use the camp freezer in the fish cleaning house anymore."
4030089,northernbite,2015-07-08 06:18:00,1186,That why we don't bring fish back from up there. I don't want the hassle. The guys that go with me get a package of fillets from me from Lake Erie. All's well that way. Paul
