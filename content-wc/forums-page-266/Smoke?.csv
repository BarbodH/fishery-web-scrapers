4049578,skindzier,2015-07-15 08:18:00,137,I got back home last Tuesday. Didn't notice any smoke while at camp at all. It was very strong in parts of North & South Dakota coming home through.

We did have some high haze filtering the sun inf we had a west wind, but a whole lot less than I've been seeing in the Twin Cities. I think it helped tame the sun a little on the really bright days, but I couldn't smell it. Our winds were mainly east, south or SW and north, so any smoke we got was pretty minimal. Cool sunrises and sunsets, though!!"
