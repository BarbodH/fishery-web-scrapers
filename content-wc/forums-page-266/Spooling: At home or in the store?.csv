4044073,biggamefisher,2015-07-13 16:44:00,540,That's just not so. Line twist has nothing to do with oscillation and everything to do with the way the line uncoils from the spool of line onto the spool of the reel.

4047266,rwz1,2015-07-14 12:52:00,6,the one time I had the BPS do it I had to strip everything when i got to Lac Seaul. Was a waste if all the line and more importantly fishing time. If u do it yourself you'll know its done correctly. It doesn't take too long and provides a chance to check reels and lube them up.
4047946,Guest,2015-07-14 17:18:00,0,"I always spool my own, simply because it is way more effort to bring it in and have someone else do it vs me doing it myself (unless you have other reasons for going there). Also, when I spool my own reels, I spool about half W/mono backer and the remaining half w/power pro for my Shimano Curado I bait casters (with this formula I get 3 spool fills with 1- 300 yard spool of power pro). I always use the same diameter line backer (6# mono) as my main line (20# power pro) which is 6# diameter also. With my spinning reels, I generally spool 1/3 with mono backer & 2/3 with either power pro or Fireline (I use both for different reels). Now, I will say that I have no comments, good or bad about the quality of line spooling done by a store, I just prefer to do it myself (kind of like preparing your own parachute) if there is an issue, I have no one but myself to blame, plus it is way too easy to do, no need to bring it in. If by chance you do get line twist from improper spooling, you can always, w/boat moving let your line all the way out in the water (with nothing attached to your line) and then simply wind it back up (with boat still moving) and line twist should go away. Bottom line is, I know when I do it myself, it gets done the way I want it done! Good Luck !"
4048042,wallydave,2015-07-14 17:39:00,2151,"I like spooling my reels at home, I like to try some new line on a reel or two, plus some of my favs, Berkley Vanish and Northland Bionic Walleye line. To each his or her own!"
4057226,fishpoop,2015-07-18 02:29:00,630,"If you get a poor job of spooling done at your local tackle shop before stripping all that line off your reel and throwing it out try this to remove line twist; remove all lures and tackle from your line, bare line only please, when out on the water let all the line out behind the boat while moving forward at a slow speed then reel it all back in. The line dragging through the water removes all the twist and it will pack and lay on your reel very nicely when done."
4042857,cma14,2015-07-13 11:46:00,6,"I have always spooled my own reels by hand. I'm curious as to your thoughts on if there is any advantage to having Bass Pro do it for me? If so, why? What's the ideal amount of line for 30 and 20 lb braid?"
4043161,JOE WALLEYE,2015-07-13 12:51:00,753,if its a spinning reel spool it yourself at home. the automatic spooler will put all kinds of twist in your line. bait caster you can have spooled at the store if you prefer.
4043313,MrSimon,2015-07-13 13:36:00,922,I've always found that spooling up my own reels is part of the fun. I don't really see a benefit to having it down at the store.
4043433,Hawker,2015-07-13 14:09:00,3967,"At home, course it helps that I have the same line winder on the workbench in my garage they have at the store LOL!Admittedly, I'm stumped with your question ""What's the ideal amount of line for 30 and 20 lb braid?"" Are you asking how much line it would take to fill a specific reel?"
4043465,cma14,2015-07-13 14:14:00,6,yes i am. Some times i wonder if i have put too much line on the reel. Don't use braided line that often so i'm wondering how much others use.
4043521,alberta bum,2015-07-13 14:25:00,312,"As for the braid depends what kind of reel and how you are going too fish with it. My spinning reels i used to jig with, I put 60-80 feet. My level wind counters I use too pull dipsy divers and jets, I put 225 feet on them."
4043761,pjshorthorn,2015-07-13 15:24:00,5654,"I spool my own equipment. I 've seen too many guys that have their's done in a store only to find out the young guy didn't do such a good job. Regardless of the line type or lb test, I fill mine till there is about an 1/8 inch of space left on the spool for spinning reels and maybe a 1/4 inch on casting reels. I use Ambassaduers for casting so the spools are larger than some other models. PjShorthorn"
4043873,Hawker,2015-07-13 15:58:00,3967,"Rule of thumb for me is to fill the spool (baitcast reel or spinning reel) approximately half (1/2) full with a quality mono line, tie mono to braid with back to back uni knot and fill spool to within 1/8-1/16th of an inch to spool edge with the braid of choice."
4043953,biggamefisher,2015-07-13 16:25:00,540,"How do you figure that? Most good stores remove the spool from the reel and, in the unit itself, the spool itself is held in place and the line winds from the spool of line right onto the spool of the reel, effectively the same setup as a bait caster being wound up, absolutely zero line twist.. Recently just started using the store method, don't think I'll ever go back to doing my own."
4044041,JOE WALLEYE,2015-07-13 16:38:00,753,If the machine does not match the up and down oscillation of your reel you get crossed line and twist.
