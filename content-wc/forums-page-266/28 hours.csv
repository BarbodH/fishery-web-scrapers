PjShorthorn I think that sounds good! Dad lit the fire in me...now it is time to light his fire. Sunday thru Saturday fishing...life is good...God is good.
4055514,Slab Seeker,2015-07-17 09:47:00,14,Looking forward to the report. We have been to Kay's Birch Lake outpost and always wondered how the LS cabins and fishing were.
4055538,sauvain,2015-07-17 09:51:00,63,We have been to the Birch outpost 5 times...and loved it. We just thought for my son's first time we would go with electricity and flush toliets Birch is a tremendous fishery no doubt. We have friends who fish Lac Seul and maybe not the numbers of Birch but size may be slightly bigger overall.
4056130,John N,2015-07-17 12:47:00,362,Electricity and flush toilets are good. Likewise taking sons on trip. Have a great trip! Heading north from Iowa in about a week to Lake St. Joseph. Can't wait. John
4057050,law57,2015-07-17 21:18:00,1147,"3 generation tripi - did that many times. I'm dating myself again - but 40 years ago two of us drove from NW to Nester Falls on a Friday night before Memorial Day. When we got there nothing was open - couldn't buy a licence. So we napped in the truck until the bait dealer opened. When we got to the landing there was a boat floating behind a truck. We knew there was a truck there because we could see the bug deflector. The boat was still tied to the trailer. Dad was standing there in shock. Kid was scared and grandpa looked like he wanted to commit suicide. There was just nothing we could do. We didn't have a big enough truck (Toyota 2wd) to pull them out. We took them back to a restaurant for breakfast. Nobody was going to steal their stuff - it was all under water. I said to dad to call his wife and tell her what happened. Then try to salvage stuff to continue the trip. If that wasn't possible, have his insurance deal with a garage to get things working - if possible. Then rent a car and go home. I have never forgot the look on grandpa's face. I would have given anything to sooth his feelings. I hope the son found some compassion for the old dude."
