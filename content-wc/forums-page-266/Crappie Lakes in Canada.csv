4056826,GarryB,2015-07-17 19:10:00,365,Slab crappies are my favorite fish but I have never fished Canada so please PM me with the names of the lakes that have a great population of slab crappies that are not overrun with boats. Prefer medium to smaller size lakes.Thanks in advance for those who are willing to identify the lakes I should be looking at.

You can get in touch with him at this link: http://gatewaynorthoutfitters.net/ You won't need to go very far into Canada! He is located just north of Emo, ON which is only about 40 miles from Fort Frances, ON. One of my friend's went up there last winter and superbee got him into a remote lake via snowmobile where he caught big, slab crappie's to his hearts content! Superbee has been up in that area for a long time and really knows what he is doing. Tell him DIRTBALL sent you! Good luck! 1DIRTBALL"
