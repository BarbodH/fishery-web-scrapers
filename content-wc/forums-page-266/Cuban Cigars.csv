4039081,ftfarms,2015-07-12 05:49:00,444,Cubans are not cheap in Canada. It was my bother in law that wanted them so I smoked one with him. Not a fan of any make of cigars. We've tried others I just can't remember the names.
4039697,btyreprich,2015-07-12 09:25:00,1067,"I work part time at a local store near my house with a walk in cigar humidor.The cigar expert at the store said it will likely be 2016 before Cuba cigars are available for sale in the U.S.Whether it be Canada, Russia, or Swtzerland - those Cuban cigars are expensive!"
4042049,Rlcrouse,2015-07-13 07:57:00,286,"I've picked Cubans up at Dutchies and Smitty's, but save your money and buy some good cigars here. Of all the Cubans I bought up there, they were dried out and not really any better than a Romero y Juliet or Macanudo."
4042649,Stu,2015-07-13 10:27:00,472,"Rainy Lake Sports is probably your best bet. I have purchased cigars from Dutchie’s in the past and they were stale. The store to which btyreprich is referring is the Village Corner, but it burned down on 2010 and I don’t believe they’ve ever rebuilt it."
4042689,wallydave,2015-07-13 10:39:00,2151,My first couple of trips to Ontario I did by some Cuban Cigars just because I could! Yea the exchange rates were better then too. Latley I bring some good cigars from Cigars International. Sign up for email and try some of the cigars they have on special. The really goods manage to make their way North! Happy shopping!
4043289,MrSimon,2015-07-13 13:33:00,922,"BINGO! You can get much better quality and cheaper cigars at your local store in the US. Cuban cigars can still be good, but ones from The Dominican, Honduras, or Nicaragua are just as good or even better these days. But if you really want one just to say you did .... go for it."
4044289,adempsey,2015-07-13 17:44:00,963,The Romeo Y Julieta are what I used to buy. They are popular and not super expensive. I used to get the smaller ones.
4049458,popi,2015-07-15 07:55:00,593,"Check out ACID cigars, typically dark wrapper=strong light wrapper=light My personal favorites are the blonde belicoso , windy city and extraordinary larry. Any of these three are better than the few I have had from Cuba which I bought in Mexico."

4054354,forgop,2015-07-17 03:08:00,880,"For non-Cuban cigars, my top pics for buying are cigarplace.biz, atlanticcigar.com, and cigarsatyourprice.com. Once you get signed up with CI, Thompsons, cigar.com, etc, you'll be bombarded with mail forever."
4037025,walleye IA,2015-07-10 21:09:00,129,Where do you guys buy Cuban Cigars Between Fort Francis and Ear Falls.What band do you recommend and the much should I expect to pay. I have never tried a Cuban and would like to try one this year.
4037065,bigdaddyguns,2015-07-10 21:20:00,608,"Might try Dutchie's in Perrault Falls. I seem to recall a sign in the store advertising they sold Cubans, ... not like the Seinfeld episode ;-)"
4037441,btyreprich,2015-07-11 08:09:00,1067,My buddy used to buy them at the gas station / general store in Vermillion. bay on our way up to Ear Falls. Expect to pay $20 in U.S. Funds He said to be sure they were not dried out.
4037457,LoDo,2015-07-11 08:12:00,721,We purchase in Dryden. You can purchase at several different places. Be sure to give them a good smell and feel for freshness.
4037497,pitbull,2015-07-11 08:27:00,45,"Try the Duty Free Store, there also good for the Skeeters in evening."
4037713,Guest,2015-07-11 10:58:00,0,I bought one at duchies for about $12 3 weeks ago
4038161,Pikeslayer8,2015-07-11 15:24:00,1460,Rainy Lake Sports in the Fort.
4038961,forgop,2015-07-12 04:11:00,880,Buy them online and have them shipped to your house. That's what a friend of mine does. Canada taxes are outrageous.
4039041,ftfarms,2015-07-12 05:30:00,444,Macanudo I think is the one I have smoked before. The wrap is green and gold outlined in white. I think I've payed any where from $12-$18 on them.
4039049,forgop,2015-07-12 05:33:00,880,Ouch. There's far better cigars for half the price in the cuban world.
