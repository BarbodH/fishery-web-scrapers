I was told if they are over 16 I don't need written permission from both parents. They are divorced and the father is not in the picture. Just want to make sure all is in order, his first fly in. THANKS"
4053482,youngknight,2015-07-16 16:46:00,228,"My original feeling was should be no problem at all but make sure you get a consent letter from his mom anyhow and if you are really worried, call the Canadian Services Border Agency...don't rely on fishermen for this type of question. Having said that, I did a search on the CSBA website and got the Travel with Minor bit below, but didn't know the age considered a minor, did some searching and got the defn immediately below, even that was from a different website for Cdn kids, but I would think that the defn would remain the same. So, make sure there is a good consent letter from his mom and contact info. I doubt it will be a problem at all since he is 17 and not 7.Persons under 18 or 19 years of age, depending on their province or territory of residence, are considered children and need appropriate documentation to travel abroadTravel with minorsBorder services officers watch for missing children, and may ask detailed questions about any minors travelling with you.We recommend that parents who share custody of their children carry copies of their legal custody documents, such as custody rights. If you share custody and the other parent is not travelling with you, or if you are travelling with minors for whom you are not the parent or legal guardian, we recommend you carry a consent letter to provide authorization for you to take them on a trip and enter Canada.A consent letter must include the custodial parents' or legal guardians' full name, address and telephone number. Some travellers choose to have the consent letter notarized, to further support its authenticity, especially if they are undertaking a significant trip and want to avoid any delay."

If I were you, I'd have a signed note from his mother indicating that you have permission to take your grandson into Canada from xx date to xx date for the purpose of xxxx. She should sign the note and you should take a photocopy of his mother's passport or driver's license for signature comparison."
4053498,Andyeye,2015-07-16 16:50:00,179,"I have taken grandkids under the same situation that you are talking about. We had a permission slip explaining who you are, the parent giving you permission to have him with you, the dates of arrival and return and signed by the parent. We had it notarized and had no issues. These were grandkids under 16. I would do it just to save any headaches at the border. Have a great trip!"
4053914,LOW1,2015-07-16 20:00:00,2828,"If the father is not available to sign the letter, hopefully mom has sole legal custody. If there are any court papers which establish this, I would take a certified copy with me to Canada."
