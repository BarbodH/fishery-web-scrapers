I was warned by my fishing partner on this trip that it could become addicting. If it does become an addiction, do you offer a ""rehab program "" to get a fella back on the straight and narrow ? How long would the program be and what does it entail ???? I'm thinking I may need to look at my vacation calendar and start blocking out some dates now PjShorthorn"
4045577,prov1800,2015-07-14 06:33:00,5010,There are no rehab programs available yet.something needs to be done though as this addiction escalates rather quickly.good luck.

I was thinking more along the lines of a day of 10-12 walleyes over 30+ inches and 6-8 northerns over 45"" PjShorthorn"
4047418,wallydave,2015-07-14 14:11:00,2151,First acknowledge you are addicted to musky fishing! Next put your musky gear down and slowly walk away to your best walleye/pike lake and never look back! Repeat as needed!
4048714,prov1800,2015-07-14 20:48:00,5010,Haha.my problem is iam addicted to all the species.and enjoy having days off from guiding and heading out all by myself.just hard to pick the fish species for that day.but because i fish so much for walleye its usually trout or bass and pike and muskie.but its hard deciding which one to pick.tough problem.
4048738,bigwillies,2015-07-14 21:10:00,515,just hard to pick the species for the day?...days off from guiding so im goin myself?...think u have figured things out. wished i had that problem. u r a lucky fella.

4054514,pjshorthorn,2015-07-17 05:29:00,5654,Prov1800: C'mon Man !!!! Your are kill'in me !!!! You are not helping out with the potential musky addiction dillemma I'm going to face on Eagle Lake. Don't give up guiding because your boat side manner on addiction counseling is somewhat lacking.. LOL Those are beauties!!! Glad you had a succesful trip. PjShorthorn
4043489,prov1800,2015-07-13 14:19:00,5010,"Had some guests sraying at clarkes norther lights resort.we were going to go to lac seul on friday but with 35+ km winds i decided to fish cedar lake.still did pretty good despite the wind there.walleyes still all over the place.found them in around 8-10 ft in the weed beds and 15 + FT along the shorelines and points.fished four spots and still managex around 40 or so and even fished a few spots for muskies.had some follow ups and lost two fish.Saturday we headed to lac seul and basically were the only ones out there as camps were turning their guests around.again got to fish all my old spots without anybody in sight.walleyes were also very shallow in some spots and down to around 17 ft on the main lake.fishing was very good using up 10 doz minnows and havjng time to cast for some northern pike.caught a pile of pike with 3 -38"" and a 40"".they were mainly in the weed beds.lake was like glass all day and 30c it was a scorcher. sunday found us back to cedar lake for a muskie day.again nk wind and 30c again.turned out to be one of those bonus days.saw 25+ muskies.just lost count.had about 6-7 on and off.but ryan brought two into the boat one being a beautifull hybrid.all came from the weeds only three fish came from the rocks.amazing day which doesnt happen to often."
