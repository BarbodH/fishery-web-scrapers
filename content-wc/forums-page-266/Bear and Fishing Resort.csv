4036313,Rayiii,2015-07-10 14:17:00,40,I'm looking for a bear and fishing outfitter in Canada. Would like to have it all guided with the meals included. Would be willing to do our own meals if not offered by the outfitter. We will have six hunters. Has any one been on that trip of a life time and would like to share their secret spot or any other info you might have. Thanks for your responses.

The Bullpit Steakhouse is part of the lodge so you order off of a menu instead of everyone eating the same thing. While I'm not a bear hunter, I have seen some nice bear taken while I have been up there."

Fishing options consist of walleye, perch, northern, burbot and lake trout ( catch and release only). I believe they book bear hunts through the end of August. All meals are included. PjShorthorn"

4056146,johnboat,2015-07-17 12:57:00,2014,Leaving for 5 Lakes Lodge on Gullrock in 34 1/2 days for a Bow Bear Hunt/Fishing trip with a buddy. I have fished there for years and have always been happy. This will be my first Bear Hunt there. Meals are not provided. I have seen some nice trail cam pics and hope to call it my secret spot in the near future. The owner/guide has lived in the area all his life and has recently obtained some new BMA's that haven't been hunted on in several years. We will be the first to hunt a couple of them this year.
