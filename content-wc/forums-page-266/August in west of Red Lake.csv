4029393,LoDo,2015-07-07 18:56:00,721,"Id love to hear some pointers, depths, colors, etc.... I'm going to the Woodland Caribou Prov Park west of Red Lake Aug 13 to 21. This will be our groups first year going this late in the season. We prefer June, but June wasn't in the cards this year.Would love to hear some short recommendations for Aug fishing. We'll fish for Walleyes 70% of the time. The other 30% will be for northerns and lakers.Best,LoDo"
4038361,zeebee,2015-07-11 17:37:00,1144,"I have fished Trout Lake....just east of there in mid august. Eyes most frequently occupied that 20'-40' depth and we did well trolling DHJ 13's and Deep tail dancers. Bottom bouncing with 2-4 ozs weights and slow death real effective too. Key is to get down deeper than June. Then when located you could jig if quantity was the target. Larger pike were also found at that depth off points and mouth of bays. Lakers are gonna be in the deep main basins and if you have a portable downrigger, troll spoons such as Len Thompson platinum in firetiger, 5"".50 - 70' down over deep water.If no rigger, jig for them in similar locale with 1-3 ozs jigs and white twister tails. Nice time of year......cooler, no bugs and weather more stable."
4038417,LoDo,2015-07-11 18:12:00,721,"I keep hearing fish will be deeper in mid/late Aug. Should be fun reeling fish in from that deep. June is usually a quick fight. Sounds like the fight in Aug requires a little more time. I'm still going up with med/light action, med action and a couple med/heave action trolling rods. I love catching fish on the med/light action jigging rod. I hope you are right with the weather forecast. Going into the year knowing late Aug was our trip i was skeptical of the warm temps. I'm really hoping for nothing warmer than mid 70s. I'd love 60s if possible. I'll fish for 15 hours in 60 degree temps. 80s on the other hand usually requires mid afternoon breaks. Any tips with colors this time of year? Spring for me is usually bright colors. Do we stick with the same or move to the more natural colors? Best, Lodo"
4038441,zeebee,2015-07-11 18:29:00,1144,"August is the best kept secret when it comes to weather. Mornings typically low 60's and days to mid 70'....remember I say typically. Bring clothes for any encounter and......dont neglect sunscreen or you will fry.Color wise I use perch, silver/blue, golds and even firetiger in cranks.....dont seem too particular and I have no fav's. Keep a spinning rod rigged for a cast to a promising outcrop of rock...if weeds present all the better. Floating Rapala J 5 thru 9 work well for this tactic.The big ones will move shallow to ambush and then move back deeper. Some years our largest come casting to such shallow points/rocks especially but not limited to evenings. My son is particularly skilled at this...I will slow the boat to a crawl as we troll by and he will cast right up to the shore.....sometimes they hit in 2 FOW...pretty exciting. Dont overdo this technique.......you will soon learn to pick the hotspots. Like a reef that barely breaks surface but has tall reeds emerging and several boulders...thats a likely hotspot.Once you experience mid August you will be ""hooked""."
4038569,LoDo,2015-07-11 19:43:00,721,"Thanks for the tips Zeebee! I feel confident with my colors, many of which you mentioned. I like the weight i have to get down to the 40'+. Should be a good time reeling large females and big donkeys with a med/light action rod at those depths. I'm really hoping the temps are as you mentioned. I'd rather sit in a boat with 50 degree temps and rain that 80s with full sun. Simply my preference. Regards, Lodo"
4049962,mms3rd,2015-07-15 10:02:00,148,"We fished Douglas Lake inside the park in the middle of August a few years ago and had great luck for northerns and walleyes...didn't try trout.I expected the weather to be pretty settled, but we had a lot of variety.Our best luck was in 21-24 feet of weather with best fishing in the evening....but caught my 28"" walleye in about 8-10 feet with a lot of structure....best northern of 39"" was in maybe 12 feet among a lot of structure.Basic bait was Little Joe spinner with nightcrawler or minnow, or jig tipped with half a frozen or live minnow or half a nightcrawler. Did catch some smaller northerns in bays on topwater.....pretty easy. Lower Downtown?Mike"
4050146,LoDo,2015-07-15 11:13:00,721,"LoDo = yes! At the time I joined this site I was living in lower downtown Denver. Unreal the changes I've seen in Denver the past 13 years! IMO, the changes have all been positive. Big time population growth which brings tax money and several improvements, primarily within in downtown and city neighborhoods. Thanks for the fishing update. I'm familiar with Douglas lake. What outfitter did you go through? We have been going to Donald Lake for 8 consecutive years. We are not familiar with Aug fishing. We assume fish will be deeper and perhaps the colors we'll be using will be different but all in all we feel confident with the size and numbers we'll pull. In the 8 years we haven't been burnt, so to speak. 28"" is a good one. I think 28"" is the largest we have pulled out of Donald Lake. We have had a few 44-46"" northerns in the 8 years. Of the 6-8 in our annual group I can't remember a time where at least a 40' was caught. There are only three cabins on Donald Lake. All three are privately owned and ""grandfathered in"". There has been rumors of the Queen not allowing more cabins and essentially would love to have the three current cabins removed. The camp rules are no 18"" or greater to be kept and only conservation licenses allowed. Needless to say, the lake produces quality and quantity every year. Aug 13 departure!!!"
4050618,phishfearme,2015-07-15 14:32:00,1242,"We spent two weeks at the telescope lake outpost of Viking outfitters in late july/early august - and portaged to 4 other lakes including embryo. Telescope and Embryo are both oligotrophic lakes which mean they are clear, deep and fairly infertile - ie: lake trout lakes. Not sure what type of lake you’ll be fishing but there’s quite a few oligotrophic lakes in the area. these are very beautiful lakes. Besides not bringing enough gin with us (Hugh Carlson may a private gin run for us which indicates the quality of this outfitter!) we didn’t bring enough crawlers either. It was incredible – we would troll around, catch a walleye then throw jigs/lures in the spot and get nothing – but then drop a crawler over the side and we frequently could get a dozen or more walleye from the spot. Lesson for us was to always bring plenty of crawlers – the trip would’ve been poor without them. we got plenty using the above strategy and never had to fish deeper than about 15 ft - even on bright sunny days. Concerning catch and release walleye fishing in deep water – I suggest you look at the following thread:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...hlight=fizzing and take Jul’s comment to heart. otherwise - look for some wild blueberries and red raspberries in open areas - best we've ever found - and incredible on pancakes. phish"
