I liked that white on white jig your son Brendan was using. If you want to know a fisherman's favorite lure, look on his sons pole. Nice trip and report."
1336323,515,2011-08-01 19:08:00,254,Great job as always Mike. Thanks again and definitly worth a look for a future trip.
1336621,HeHooksHimself,2011-08-02 13:55:00,725,"Mike, I must have missed this when you originally posted it, but what a great report. My BIL and I have been going to Canada at least once a year for about 12 years now, and we have been thinking the grand kids need to be about 12 before we take them. After seeing your chronicle, I am rethinking that. We usually go in the spring and again in the fall. you were lucky to have good weather, too. Did the kids ever just get bored with it all? Wonderful report, thanks for sharing it."
1336709,Moondog,2011-08-02 18:35:00,362,"We had our 2 grandkids, girl 6, boy 8, with us for a week this summer in Canada. It was their 4th year. Our granddaughter was pretty darned content to be minnow girl, leech girl, net girl and has been fine all four years. Our grandson, who was good the previous 3 years, was a real PITA!!! Neither really fished but he wouldn't do anything, play with his toys etc........all he wanted to do was play with our toys!!!! The saving grace for him was that it was warm enuf to swim. I think it depends on the kid."
1336729,Mike Borger,2011-08-02 19:28:00,1554,"True enough. The jig bite was so good though that neither of my little ones wanted to troll. I happily obliged them, but if I'd have trolled (especially at night) some larger fish would've been had. Not complaining though, not by a long shot. Both of my kids really made me proud.Thanks for the kind words.Quote: Originally Posted by SmokeyGreat job as always Mike.Thanks again and definitly worth a look for a future trip.Thanks bud, hope your summer's going well too.Quote: Originally Posted by HeHooksHimselfMike, I must have missed this when you originally posted it, but what a great report.

Wonderful report, thanks for sharing it.Moondog is definitely right, it depends on the kid. I'll say this though, even if the kids aren't into the fishing as much it's still an experience they'll never forget.It's definitely a different kind of trip with kids that young, a bit more work. You need to be prepared to entertain them in different ways and probably won't be able to fish exactly as you'd like. But that's okay.I personally don't think there's such a thing as too young.Definitely bring them!My 7 year old daughter likes fishing, doesn't love it. But loves the outdoors and will happily spend the day in a boat.My 4 year old boyreally amazed me this trip. He fished hard with intensity all day long every day. It was also the first time he's used only a spinning reel. I had let him use mine a bit last year trying to teach him how to use it, but he'd been mostly using a pushbutton reel 'till this trip.The way he handled the equipment at the age of 4 almost brought a tear to my eye. Yes we did get lucky with the weather. A July or August trip is probably the safest bet for really young kids. Both of mine love to swim so the summer months are a no brainer."
4055970,wantabigone,2015-07-17 11:55:00,39,Just came across this older post. So Mike..... which lake do you like better now? Aba or Ara?.... lol (just read your ARA report of this year. Cheers

I'd much prefer to post it in full here, but there's a limit to the number of photo's that can be posted. Speaking of which if you do click on the link and are using dialup prepare for some grief LOL! Big thanks to everyone on the board who helped me plan this trip! Several of you guys went above and beyond sharing info with me. (You know who you are!!) Hugely appreciated guys, THANKS! Cheers, Mikehttp://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...howtopic=55787"

1335440,Knoxabilly,2011-07-29 15:59:00,225,Awesome blog! Looks like you and your family had a great time! What was the largest eye?
1335442,Mike Borger,2011-07-29 16:04:00,1554,"25"" was the largest. I did have an absolute beast on well over 30"" jigging on one of the mid lake shoals. Fought it for a good 15 mins and she got unbuttoned right beside the boat. No doubt in mind if I'd trolled at night in some key areas (we had the full moon on Friday the 15th) I'd have put some big fish in the boat. It was all about the kids though on this trip and trolling after dark wasn't on the agenda."

Fish On"

1335525,adempsey,2011-07-29 22:35:00,963,Always enjoy your reports. Thanks!How would you compare Aba to Ara/Meta for fishing?
1335540,Mike Borger,2011-07-30 06:35:00,1554,For us white was king. 99% of our jig caught fish were on white. Have a great time up there bud!
