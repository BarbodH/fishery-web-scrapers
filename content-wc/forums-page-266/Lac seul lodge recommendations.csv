4055466,ftfarms,2015-07-17 09:27:00,444,Never heard of the first one but we've fished around earfalls and perrault falls for years. Late june fishing should be good out of both areas but your getting close to the time fish down towards mckenzie bay is getting great. So with that said I would have to say onaway lodge. Never stayed there but have stayed in scoutbay with lizzy walston. Fishing is good for walley and pike. We probly would still fish up that way but we don't like driving that far no more and we found morson Ontario over two hours closer and fish is as good if not better. (morson is fishing the lake of the woods). Have a wonderful trip and god bless. I forgot I have fished around soixlookout (lac suel) also and fishing in that area is good that time of year also. good luck.

4045529,mswope13,2015-07-14 06:23:00,73,I second Evergreen Lodge! Pat's runs a great camp. Boats are best you will find on Lac Seul.
4045897,LoDo,2015-07-14 07:37:00,721,"This ^^^^^ Excellent owners, lodge, cleanliness and location on the lake! Because you are going in June you'll want to spend some time fishing MacKenzie Bay, Ghost Narrows and Manitoba Pt. Onaway may have the best location on the lake. Lac Seul Lodge is another good one. Have fun!!"
4047306,adempsey,2015-07-14 13:17:00,963,"One thing I forgot to mention. When I have to find a lodge that accepts pets, I usually do a Google site search because it's often impossible to find the info on the web page.All you do is type ""site:http://lacseulwalleye.com/ pet"" [without the quotes] into a Google search and it will search the entire website [Evergreen Lodge in that example] for the word pet. Often I still have to email though."

4049330,Plotman,2015-07-15 07:12:00,394,"I just checked their website and it says ""No pets please"". Maybe this is a new rule. Thanks for the tip though."
4049562,skindzier,2015-07-15 08:16:00,137,"I don't think Timberlane's website specifies either way, however the fact that they take dogs was the whole reason I started going there..."
4050018,vaquero01,2015-07-15 10:20:00,101,Takes pets. We are taking are Lab for the third year next month. For 2 WEEKS!
4050466,Mark R,2015-07-15 13:29:00,1538,"Evergreen allows dogs in camp. If you want to be sure give Pat a call and confirm it. We have been going up there for the past 20 years and there is always a dog or two running around. As mentioned earlier the boats and motors are top notch and the rest of the camp is also very nice and it's close enough to Era Falls that if you need something you can take a 5 minute drive and be ""down town"". Good luck."
4055218,Plotman,2015-07-17 08:35:00,394,"So far I have found the following that accept pets and still awaiting word back from others. 1. Cherob resort 2.Gold pines camp 3. Evergreen lodge 4. Timberlane lodge 5. Onaway lodge Obviously Lac Seul is huge, is there a certain area or end of the lake I should be concentrating on in late June to lessen the need for long boat rides from camp?"
4041745,Plotman,2015-07-13 06:18:00,394,"My family and I are looking for lodge recommendations on Lac seul that will accept dogs. Looking to go late june for 2016 due to son graduating high school. Looking to find a place that we want to return to year after year for many seasons instead of jumping around trying to find that ""perfect lodge"". Calling on those that have been returning year after year to the same lodge in hopes of targeting primarily walleyes and pike. We recently got back from Packwash lake/trout river and although fishing was OK, it wasn't what I remember as a kid when my dad would take me to Canada. Hoping to make some memorable times with my family for many years to come. Read a lot of posts on Lac Seul but, it seems quite a few lodges don't want pets even though I expect to pay for that privilege. Any recommendations appreciated."
4041849,Anglin Andy,2015-07-13 06:59:00,100,"Hello, I highly recommend staying at Gawley's. Doug and Gayle have Great Accommodations and are Great People. Rates are $55 per person per night. Included in this is Dockage, Electrical, Fishing Cleaning Building and Ice. Fishing in June should be minutes away to less than 30 minutes. (807)-222-3333 Dave"
4041897,skindzier,2015-07-13 07:18:00,137,fishtimberlane.com on Lac Seul Just got back from our 5th time there. Great folks & great fishing. Always take our dogs.
4041929,1DIRTBALL,2015-07-13 07:31:00,49,"You won't need to search any further Plotman! www.LostIslandLodge.com . You would not be able to find anyone in Canada that will treat you any better than Shane & Chris Hayes! I'll admit to being biased because they are good friends of mine. I'm not related to them and I don't get any kind of spiff for referrals! They are just extremely likeable people and as helpful as you could hope for. I don't know whether or not Shane allows pets. You can check about that on their website. They do offer any kind of service you would expect from any good Canadian resort. Including guide's if you want one. If you are fortunate you might end up with Sam as your guide! Sam is an awesome guide and also Chris and Shane's son. Any more superlative's I could come up with would not be of any help to you so I will close for now. I just know you would really enjoy yourself there! Tell them Keith sent you! Bon chance, Mon Ami! 1DIRTBALL"

4043841,Hump,2015-07-13 15:52:00,578,"Allows pets. Moose, the renowned dock hand and guide, has two dogs in camp and while we were there several people brought their dogs. Just clan up any mess."
4044329,adempsey,2015-07-13 17:51:00,963,"I made a list of lodges on Lac Seul if you're interested. It gives you a general idea of where the are located on the lake. Most are near Ear Falls, but there are a few that are more remote.http://www.lineonfishing.com/index.p...ake-in-ontarioJust scroll down to the bottom of that page and click on Lac Seul."
