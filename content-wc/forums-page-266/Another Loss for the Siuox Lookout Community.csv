They were there rolling when we went there in mid June. I know Horton's has moved in, but I had hoped with the loss of Knobby's literally right next door that they'd have been able to ramp up the breakfast offerings to take some advantage/provide a new service. Always much preferred their coffee over Horton's, and they had a solid donut selection, which is a lot more that I can still say for Hortons, even after a year plus in business."

But there were still quite a few people in there. Sad to see it go, hate to see any business get put out by another business after so many years."
