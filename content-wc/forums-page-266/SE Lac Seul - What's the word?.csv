4050114,mwh624,2015-07-15 10:51:00,183,Head up in few days to fish Lac Seul out of Deception Bay. Probably head up into Sen bay and out into the Taylor Island area. Haven't seen a report lately from this part of the lake. Any know the water temp and what depths the fish seem to be in? Tight Lines!
4050650,pjshorthorn,2015-07-15 14:48:00,5654,Matt: Check in with rnnonmt. He has fished this area for a few years and probably has the best intel on spots and how the fishing was this summer in that area. He also posted some videos of his trip. PjShorthorn
4054074,ScottL,2015-07-16 21:02:00,733,"I would like to know also, as we are fishing the same area. If you see a Crestliner with a couple of Yamaha's on the back, stop and say Hi."
4056642,rnnonmt,2015-07-17 16:39:00,992,"I would be happy to share some fishing experiences for NP or walleye from the SE or NE section, but really it doesn't matter what section you are in. I'm sure there are plenty of folks here with better input than I as I have only been on the SE section for a few years and spent a lot more time in the NE section, nonetheless, I would still share some of my findings. My first suggestion is no mystery but the basics is all that you need to start with. I will start at wind blown points with transitions (bottom or vegetation transitions) ..... that usually about as far as I need to go. Of course all the trips I have made since the early 80's combined with all the old timers prior to me have been able to shorten my run & gun method. Remember, combined with the aforementioned ... whether it be water current or wind current. I know your probably thinking..... that could be the whole darn lake??? Yep, its just that easy. Good fishing and stay safe. PM me if you would like a little more detail. I posted a couple vids of this years trip on youtube. I bought a gopro and had a blast making good use of it. Just search rnnonmthd on youtube or my posts on WC. Jimijr and PJshorthorn: I cant wait to hear how your trips went. PJ has to be chomping at the bit by now to find some Esox masquinongy with Vbay. Did you pack the tobacco for spirit rock or are you just planning on bringing your yoga pants for this trip??? lol"
4057274,pjshorthorn,2015-07-18 05:03:00,5654,"Well Brian, you are correct. I'm raring to go !!!!!!!! 4 more days and a wake up before making our first leg of the journey north. About now, I would imagine that Jimirjr has a few tears in his eyes as they should be starting their journey back to reality today. The tobacco is packed along with a special prayer written by V-Bay Gord. I would publish it on WC , but it has some pretty colorful phrases in there You are a pretty perceptive fella as I've been on an emotional roller coaster on what clothing I should pack.........I've opted to leave the yoga outfit at home as I figured reeling in 10,000 fish will be enough of a workout. The weather is going to be fairly warm so I'll be bringing my chartruese thong instead so I can take a dip in the lake on occasion. I also have the knitting needles packed as Gord holds a sweater knitting seminar every Friday afternoon on the veranda........thongs are optional. PjShorthorn"
4057474,cuamb,2015-07-18 07:20:00,203,"Just got back from Taylor Island area yesterday. Weather was very interesting all week with storms, heat and wind. Fishing was pretty good early in the week but was tough for us on Wednesday and Thursday. We caught fish as shallow as 3 ft (windy bays with weeds) and as deep as 20 ft (mid lake humps). We also caught them in wind swept rock points. I mostly fish the NE section so I am not as familiar with the Taylor Island area. There are other people that I am sure did better than me. Good Luck, I am sure you will do well."
4057666,rnnonmt,2015-07-18 08:50:00,992,LMAO Pat!!! Careful taking a dip with your chartreuse thong on... your bait and tackle might be confused by a muskie for an American Hardwood Lure series called the Mini-Mag! Good luck to you this trip. Hope to hear about and see some pics and videos (not of the thong of course)!!! or the knitting class ok?
