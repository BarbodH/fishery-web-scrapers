Was curious if anyone has been up there this summer - how'd your trip go? I'm trying to recall locations that we did we at - I remember beneath the waterfall was good fishing and a spot called Bare *** rock (i think?). My memory might be going a bit fuzzy Also, if anyone is going to be up there July 31st-August 5th let me know! Thanks, -Patrick"

4053818,Skyraptor,2015-07-16 19:32:00,291,My brothers just came back last week after spending 8 days fishing. They stayed at SRC and they had very good fishing the whole week. They only had rain really 1 day and their last 2 days was a bit warmer but still the fish hit. They managed to all boat walleyes of over 24+. Don will be able to point to you where the fish are hitting and on what but you really can't go wrong at any spot you fish. Would appreciate a report when you get back. I'm planning on next year and was there this past October. Good Luck!

I recently bought a drone (I do photography and video work) and might bring that along as well, get some cool aerial shots of the camp - Tena seemed excited by that. Will post that as well if that happens."

4056706,iowafishingdude,2015-07-17 17:34:00,9,I was flying some farms here locally last week and had some pissed off hawks circling and squawking at it so I'm used to the antagonism
4056722,pjshorthorn,2015-07-17 17:49:00,5654,This is a pretty cool idea for new vids documenting your trip. I just hope the bald eagles don't get pizzed off......that could become an international event Have fun on your trip !!! PjShorthorn
4058330,iowafishingdude,2015-07-18 13:50:00,9,Ha yeah and the drone is black and white - when is bald eagle mating season? Hopefully not now
