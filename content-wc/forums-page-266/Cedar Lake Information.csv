4051954,Andyeye,2015-07-16 07:13:00,179,Our group will arriving 8/15 at Cedar Point Resort. We had a great trip up there last year and I can't wait to get back. If anyone is heading up there before then and would like to post some information on whats working I would appreciate it. Last year we met fellow WC'er Rich B. and his group and they were gracious enought to share some tips and really helped us out. I would be happy to share any information to anyone that may be up there the week we are there. I would like to get some pointers and tips on some of those summer crappie spots up there. We did very well on walleyes and smallies but never found the crappies. I did get some Muskie gear I just hope I don't get that muskie addiction I have been reading about on this site.
