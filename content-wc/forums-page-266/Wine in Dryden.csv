An old standby we get from our local LCBO (99 King Street in Dryden) is a Jackson-Triggs Shiraz (a Canadian wine), we buy it in a 4L box, but it is probably available by the bottle also, an inexpensive wine, but tastes good. I sometimes will buy wine by the case in the States that is not available in Canada and bring it in, I think the duty is about $6.00 per bottle if you chose to go that route."
