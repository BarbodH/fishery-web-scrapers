Between two great countries, both of which overall strongly encourage commerce and interchange between the two of them. Unlike some places I have been, never a hint that a $20 bill is expected in order to cross. Enjoy it. Take advantage of it. And before you complain, recognize that it is far better than most."

The person reading the scan display wasn't certain so these boats were pulled over to the side and searched. The rod tubes could be mistaken for a shoulder fired missile launcher. All that was found was the rod tube. The last time I was scanned you had to pull up so that your trailer hitch was up to the white line. When the operator was ready, the officer would wave you forward and you idled through the scanner module. Then you waited for the operator to read the scan, said thank you to the officer and you were on your way. That was quite a few years ago. Remember, I older than dirt."

4053730,Pikeslayer8,2015-07-16 18:57:00,1460,Which countries border laws are the most reasonable?
4053986,Obabikon,2015-07-16 20:39:00,2370,"I think there's a difference in having the most reasonable border, and most reasonable border laws. 1. I think Canadian custom officers are (in general) a little nicer when crossing. Obviously not everyone, but as someone who crosses 25+ times per year... going into Canada is easier than going into the US (for the average person without a record). 2. I think the DUI law is so insane that Canadians automatically win the border laws side. Preventing felons from entering your country makes sense. The idea is to keep out hardened/dangerous criminals. It could be easily fixed in many different ways."
4054090,Pikeslayer8,2015-07-16 21:10:00,1460,So do I
4054170,muskyman73,2015-07-16 21:44:00,402,"I agree, the agents are nice. We made sure to eat the eggs with the serial numbers ending in even numbers on even days and odd numbers on odd days - We did not want to go against the grain and break any laws in Canada. Oh ya, we did not bring any poultry products into Canada. And no guns too, as the Canadian border agents were much more concerned about the poultry products, than the weapons. Thank you for the eggs Jared, we really appreciated that. They went well with the 14lbs of bacon we cooked up."
4054602,Guest,2015-07-17 05:48:00,0,"This is a loaded question. There are so many variables to consider here. remember, some people were just born ornery or they're just having a bad day. We have crossed at International Falls coming home when GI Joe from the border patrol is reading serial numbers of pickup trucks and offered no explanation. But even scanning the boat is not problem."
4054682,Bigstorm,2015-07-17 06:10:00,799,We've difficulties with both (although not often). I'm guessing it depends on how the agent's day is going and how you answer their questions
4054770,law57,2015-07-17 06:37:00,1147,Did American Customs every subject you to their X-ray machine? In 2006 they made us drive our truck/boat into it and sit in the truck while they performed the X-ray. I objected and they said there was no danger. But they have not used that thing for years... I wonder why? Both my friend and I have experienced cancer since that time. I'm not saying the cancers were caused by the X-rays - but I'm not saying there weren't Who knows?
4054842,Pikeslayer8,2015-07-17 07:04:00,1460,You are the first I've heard of to go threw the x-ray machine for rigs. Sorry to hear of the cancer. That really sucks.
4054890,MrSimon,2015-07-17 07:17:00,922,"Like most of you, I've been crossing both ways for 25 years. NEVER had a single issue either way, so from my personal experience it's a tie. I've never even encountered a rude agent. Lines do seem to be longer going into the US. This really is a Ford or Chevy kind of question."
4055018,pjshorthorn,2015-07-17 07:47:00,5654,We went through the same X-ray scanner that year in I-Falls on the return back. Haven't seen it since then. PjShorthorn
