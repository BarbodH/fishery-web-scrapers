I've never fished lotw in the summer or on the Canadian side so I jumped all over it. Riding up in the father in laws extended cab silverado it's gonna be a interesting trip with a 5yr old and 10 month old.... Not the first time we've done this went lotw warroad area last jan. When the little ones was 3 months old.... Anyways what should I expect for fishing? Jigs? Rigs? Raps? Bring the Muskie gear? Crappies? Any input greatly appreciated! Rocks, sand, mud? Think the cabin is right by buena vista.."

Muskies are on the sand and rocks both. Walleye have been good, but on the sides/bottoms of humps in deeper water for the most part 20-25 feet. On occasion, they'll move up shallow... but that's been the regular pattern. Be safe and have fun!"
