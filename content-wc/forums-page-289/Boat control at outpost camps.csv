3660930,youngknight,2015-03-17 16:42:00,228,"True Old Timer - emergencies are a concern although not perhaps that relevant to boat control. There are a lot more solutions now for communications. As a volunteer fire department in rural forested Ontario- not the boonies of northern Ontario though - we have dealt with a number of people who died while hunting. In the end they were just as dead as someone who died in an outpost camp. However, sick or injured people do have a better chance if not so remote - however, generally speaking 1 hour is the normal timeframe to get advanced medical care in the majority of emergencies. Even that portage lake will require a lot more time than that I suspect.I did want to consider inviting my 81 year old father along but that safety factor is an issue - plus his knees could never take very long in a small boat.But back to the topic, you carried in a good length of rope, presumably to tie up or to make your own anchor."
3676554,bkw67,2015-03-21 19:34:00,70,The first time I did a fly-in... I tried jigging and gave it up quickly. I stick to back-trolling when using bottom bouncers. Sometimes I do a little drifting when casting spoons or other crank baits.
3677058,Babamel2,2015-03-22 05:42:00,414,"I use a basketball net with one end tied shut, put a rock in it and tie to a rope,. An anchor for a few bucks"
3678650,Walleye_Guru,2015-03-22 13:51:00,62,"I personally pack one or two drift socks in my back pack. They're small, fold up tight and dry out quickly. Remember too that drift socks aren't only for drifting. You can effectively use them while trolling. You can tie one off the bow and back troll or forward troll. Or you can tie one or two off the stern and do the same thing. I recommend using a bowline knot though, you want to be able to untie the dang thing when your done. I use nothing but a bowline knot. I personally back troll A LOT! It's really the only efficient method for staying on active fish. I'll eat waves, I'll listen to the endless motor noise and, yes, my arm will get sore from running the dang tiller arm all day, but in the end, I boat tons of fish. In all honesty, when the fishing is red hot, the only thing you'll pay attention to use how much fun your having. Good luck!"
3660210,youngknight,2015-03-17 13:49:00,228,"Interested in what some of you guys at outpost camps do for boat control - I believe boat control is one of the least discussed yet most important parts of fishing. On my 19 foot Lund I utilize drift socks, kicker motor, bowmount motor with anchor lock function with iPilot - and still can be infuriating - particularly big water, lots of wind and waves. However, don't think the bush plane will carry my rig in so a 14 foot with a 10 hp or so motor and probably no real anchorsA short piece of rope and trying to tie onto a rock - sometimes surprisingly difficult to find - has made for some challenges, particularly jigging or even staying on a reef or point (where wind is often a pain in the keister).So what do you folks do - bring along a drift sock - that can help, bring your own length of rope for a long enough anchor, one of those anchor bags where you fill with rocks or or...?I know boat control is well discussed in other parts of WC but many of the techniques just aren't available on a fly-in trip. Last year I flew into a series of very small lakes - one cabin, just a 15 foot length of rope, not much in the way of rocks, and I neglected to pack anything better like a drift sock...even though the lakes were small, light to moderate winds made it difficult to stay on the structure."
3660258,TheDFP,2015-03-17 14:01:00,39,We bring a drift sock and extra rope for an anchor. I can't stand keeping the gas motor running when I drifting. There are days my arm gets a little tired from starting the motor all the time. We also have spots we only fish when the big water is calm to help us stay on point. Another method I use is to move to another spot with less wind.
3660290,Aspencreek,2015-03-17 14:03:00,2911,"It's tough, anchor bags and drift socks are easily packed, but sometimes you just have to backtroll. Dealing with the conditions, above and below the water is why it's called fishing, not catching."
3660418,MrSimon,2015-03-17 14:19:00,922,"We don't take drift socks or anchors or anything like that. We like the simplicity of fly-in fishing. Just take what the weather gives you and adapt accordingly. Drift if you can, troll if you can't .... pretty much sums it up."
3660482,JayM5209,2015-03-17 14:30:00,1050,"I don't do many fly-ins but have a lot of years in 14' camp boats. The only two items I take along for boat control, even on all the drive in trips, is a free mesh bag to fill with small rocks (think spuds or onions sack) and a 50' length of rope. 3/8"" nylon is plenty heavy enough for this use. If I can't fish an area with a makeshift anchor and judicious use of the 10 hp, I'll go elsewhere for the morning, afternoon or day.My mantra is simple, simple, simple. One rule now is, If I've hauled it to Canada twice and never used it, it's not going again. Despite the fact that it takes three pickups for my group of six to travel to NW Ontario for a week, I can still remember the first two or three years when four of us took everything we needed for a week in my 1977 Pontiac LeMans station wagon. Wouldn't trade a single week from the last 20 years for memories made in one week the 1st 20!Youngknight, sorry. Wasn't real helpful re: your original question."
3660562,youngknight,2015-03-17 14:42:00,228,"Yeah Jay, I will remember to take a long rope with me this year. I did get for Christmas a Cabelas anchor bag to put rocks in so I will use that instead of the onion bag but good idea with that..last year on our trip we had terrible weather...some days blowing us off the lake in heavy wind, rain, lightning...my son is a pretty good trooper but weather was even too bad for me for a lot of the time...and not much opportunity to hide from the wind when weather was okay to be out...i.e. not much in the way of islands. The day before we got picked up with sunny but windy...pilot said it was the busiest flying day they ever had flying out groups that had been stuck in camps 1-3 days longer than expected due to poor flying conditions. Will try not to pack the kitchen sink though!"
3660778,pjshorthorn,2015-03-17 15:53:00,5654,"This suggestion may not be conducive to a fly-in trip, but it is something we used years ago when we needed to control drift speed and had no drift socks or rock bags. On our houseboat trips we would bring all of our live bait in with us and then store it 5 gallon buckets that we sunk to the bottom of the lake. The buckets had numerous holes drilled in the bottom and sides of each bucket to help keep them at the bottom with some rocks for weight. One particular day we had a heck of a time drifting slow enough with the wind and back trolling was a swampy event with a camp boat. At lunch I threw one of the empty 5 gallon bait buckets in the boat and we used it the rest of the trip as a drift bucket The key was having the holes drilled in the bucket. One of the other boats in our group grabbed a bucket with no holes and it didn't work as well. It just sank and was constantly under the boat with a lot less boat control. In a pinch, use what ya got to slow down the boat!!!! PjShorthorn"
3660826,jambi,2015-03-17 16:03:00,504,If the drift is too swift then I drop the anchor - anchor bag with rocks (made from a basketball net) and bring my own rope.
3660874,55walleyes,2015-03-17 16:24:00,131,I would appreciate thoughts and suggestions on drift socks. I have never used one. I did take one last year but did not use it. I am sure using it could really help in many situations but wander how big of a hassle it is to use one? Does it get in the way?
3660914,Old Timer,2015-03-17 16:34:00,255,"Some posters have mentioned simplicity. First of all, there's nothing simple about fly-in outposts. Just for starters, you're unloading and re-packing all the time. This applies to the stay-over the night before, then the unloading and packing the plane, then the unloading the plane and lugging it up to the cabin. Then helping the group before lug down their gear and pack the plane. Then do it all over again on the backside of the trip. No thanks anymore.And heaven help you if someone gets seriously ill or dies in a fly-in camp. Nothing simple there. When I used to fly in there were no radio phones or anything else. I know of two groups where someone did die. One group put the body in a sleeping bag and hung it from a tree so the critters didn't get it. The second group put the body in a boat and anchored it out in a bay. For me, I get my outpost fishing by staying at camps having remote portage boats. I seldom have competition because most folks with expensive fishing rigs don't want to sacrifice their comfort for a rowboat. On the portages I carry a 3hp, one rod, a handful of jigs, a sack lunch and a 25' stretch of rope. If it's a windy day, I'll pick a small lake or a river. Mild winds and I'll pick a bigger lake. I'll use a rock for an anchor with rope hitch from the Boy Scout field book. At the end of the day I walk out and return to the camp where I have all the amenities of home. I've been fishing Ontario for more than sixty years. I quit the fly-ins maybe fifteen or twenty years ago. It's hard to pass on the great fly-in trips I've had over the years. But the best lake I've ever found in Ontario is a walk-in lake. It was great forty years ago and is still great today because so few people fish it."
