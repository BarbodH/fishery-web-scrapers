3689842,adempsey,2015-03-25 07:42:00,963,"Just a note, I saw some new bouncers from Matzuo the other day. Look pretty good. No clue if they function well or not, but I plan on picking some up.http://www.matzuo.com/bottombouncers"
3690690,mwh624,2015-03-25 11:35:00,183,1/4-5/8 oz jig depending on the depth you are finding fish with your sonar.
3694738,youngknight,2015-03-26 10:57:00,228,I picked up a package of the fast clip version from Canadian Tire last week. Seem well made.
3683034,mwh624,2015-03-23 15:53:00,183,"#15 or #20 lb floro. Spinners aren't finesse rigs and the stiffer line helps prevent fowling. Early season, #4 or #6 blades. Warmer water go up to an #8."
3683730,Clairebear,2015-03-23 18:47:00,938,"Great article, I've tied for years but this read covers anything anyone could ask for. Thanks for posting this."
3683914,adempsey,2015-03-23 19:21:00,963,Thanks! I am glad you found the article useful.
3685210,JinxCanada,2015-03-24 06:14:00,1306,"on Lake Erie...I run #6 Colorado blades, and 1/0 bait holder hooks Eagle Claw double barb"
3685458,NUF,2015-03-24 07:09:00,94,I use 20lb Bloodrun also thanks for the article adempsey.
3686802,sauvain,2015-03-24 12:58:00,63,OK I will be fishing Lac Seul July 18th for 7 days...suggestions on colors and blades sizes...and hook sizes
3688746,Aspencreek,2015-03-24 20:49:00,2911,"That's just the thing, we could give you some suggestions, but they would all be guesses. Water temps, levels, clairity, moon phases, high and/or low pressure systems, and of course the mood of the fish at the time all will make a difference. Example: I was slaying them on a home made rig of red and blue beads and hammered brass blade all morning, to the point that the red hooks were barely red. Then I stopped for shore lunch, and of course you know the rest of the story. Not a bite, until I switched to green beads and a silver hammered blade. The next day it was something different again. Play around and you will find the combination that works for you. Just make sure you are hitting the bottom once in a while."
3689514,Guest,2015-03-25 06:18:00,0,ok suggestions on bottom bouncers??? Type?
3689738,bcmss396,2015-03-25 07:21:00,296,We've been building them with 20lb Fireline (Smoke or Crystal) and have had a lot of success. No Northern bite-offs. In full disclosure we're fishing very stained water. Blair
3689786,Aspencreek,2015-03-25 07:31:00,2911,"Anything will work, as long as you make contact with the bottom once in a while. The pencil weights work well for me, they are easy to hook up and if you are using a snap swivel to attach to the harness you can just put the eye through the snap. The 3 ways also work well but I personally don't like all that stuff hanging on my line swinging around while I'm trying to net the fish. My brother will use nothing but sliding football or walking sinkers with the line directly through them then tie a snap swivel. You can't change them out as easy, but they work and are cheap. Then there is the chain sinker (a ballchain with a chunk of lead on it) the first time I went out with a guide he gave us a couple to use, and they will work fine. To make sure you don't get snagged up while backtrolling if someone gets a hit the motor goes into neutral and everyone reels in until the fish is landed. When you are ready to get lined up again AND MOVING, that is when the harness is released and played out slowly (these rigs are NOT casted). If your rig is allowed to sit on the bottom and then dragged you will be snagged. Then you have to go back to retrieve it or lose it. BUT, if you don't get snagged up at least a couple times your not hitting the bottom."
3675290,TheDFP,2015-03-21 10:28:00,39,I will be making some crawler harnesses for my trip to the Goiun in Quebec. Couple of quick questions: 1. Colorado blade size: #3 or #4? 2. Line weight?3. Hook size: 2 or 4Thanks for the feedback in advance.
3675322,fosterthedog,2015-03-21 10:39:00,51,"As far as blades I like #4's. 8 or 10# flouro for the line. A #2 behind the blade followed by a #4 both octopus style in red. Headed up that way late June, Good luck."
3675330,retire55,2015-03-21 10:40:00,1029,"Size of blade can be impacted by time of year. In May or early June, I'd suggest number 3 and smaller blades, in late June, July and early August, size 3 and 4 blades and in late August and September, size 5 blades. Personally, I like to use 14 pound test mono to be able to pull harnesses off snags as well as to deal with the occasional gator."
3675738,Aspencreek,2015-03-21 13:58:00,2911,"Ditto above: I use the interchangeable clevis for the spinner blade so I can put on what I want whenever I want. Just make sure you stack enough beads or floats to keep whatever size blade you use in front of the first hook eye. And have some fun with colors /sizes and floats, some of the strangest combinations will work. I let my grandsons help me with bead threading, and some of the combinations are interesting, but they all work. #2 octopus hooks in red and #2 or #4 behind. 14# XT is my line of choice for all spinner rigs."
3675850,adempsey,2015-03-21 14:46:00,963,I recently put together an article discussing some of these topics that may be helpful to you.
3676058,Blades-n-Beads,2015-03-21 15:58:00,484,"Mt preference is, big water big blade. (LOW, LacSeul) I like deep cup Colorado blades in 5&6's Flouro line 14-20lb and circle hooks number 2&1. Smaller lake I drop down in blade size and hook size."
3676658,polaris-pete,2015-03-21 20:14:00,343,"I use both sizes in the Colorado blades. Smaller Lakes I use the #3 and larger Lakes I use the #4 but take some of each size. I use #15 Florocarbon ( Seguar) in 48"" lengths and if I have to shorten them somewhat I can cut some off.Hooks I use #4 with the #3 blades and #2 with the #4 blades. I have over 300 Harnesses ready to go. I also use Red hooks and Blacks.In harnesses you can make whatever you think will work. You will get lots of opinions but do what you like in the end."
3677802,kona77,2015-03-22 09:32:00,236,Good article by Adempsey.. Have been tying my own rigs for years but you can never stop learning or picking up new suggestions.Tie my rigs very similar to Aspnencreek's recommendations.. Interchangeable clevis rigs are all I use.. Allows me to change the bladesto the conditions I am fishing. Almost always use heavier line (12-14lb) to help combat the number of bite-off's from Northerns.Have caught 3-4 of my biggest Northern's on a warm harness.. Always a lot of fun !!!
3677866,Timing,2015-03-22 09:45:00,95,Article is a great resource!!
3682610,MrSimon,2015-03-23 14:11:00,922,I've started using 20lb fluorocarbon .... no pike bite-offs so far and the walleye don't mind the heavy line in the least.
