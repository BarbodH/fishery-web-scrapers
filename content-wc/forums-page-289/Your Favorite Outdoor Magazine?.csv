But over the past few years I get so annoyed trying to read a story with all the advertising. They can't just run a story from beginning to end without jumping through the pages ( mostly unnumbered ) 3 or 4 times to find the end of the story. They do this, of course, so you read the ads in between the articles. I know they have to have advertisers to stay in business but there is more advertising now than there are articles. So I have cancelled most of my subscriptions but keep a few bowhunting mags and my NRA mag that comes with my membership. I now get most of my entertainment and knowledge from the internet and outdoor tv shows ( though there is too much advertising there too). Mike as far as your idea for a magazine, I like it but a my advise would be to keep your articles as one continuous story from start to finish without jumping all over the magazine to find the ending."
3652090,michigan walleye guy,2015-03-15 09:21:00,95,"Just my two cents, but I'm not interested in Grayling fishing or Salmon fishing in Alberta, Nova Scotia, etc. I'm 95% a walleye guy and I'm nuts about Ontario. But the Boundary Waters Journal shows that subscribers will pay a premium for a well-scripted quarterly journal that focuses on excellent photography and trip destinations, and is printed on very high-quality stock.Now, if you could put together a Angling Ontario fishing show that focused mainly on walleye, lake trout, and pike, then you'd have a winner! I love the Midwest Outdoors and the Fishing the Midwest shows, but there's not enough 'fishing Canada' material for me. For example, yesterday's Fishing the Midwest show spent 10-15 minutes on planer boarding for perch in South Dakota. I still watched it, though."
3652282,Ogoki,2015-03-15 10:18:00,291,"By far my favorite magazine is the Boundary Waters Journal. If there was such a magazine about all of Northern Ontario and fishing and huntings articles , I would subscribe. There was a magazine around 1990 called Fishing The North Country . I loved it but it didn't last too long. As one outfitter at a sports show told me, that I was of a dieing breed . He said the vast majority of his customers were from 55 to 70 years old . In addition Janice , the park ranger who has been stationed at Cache Bay in Quetico for 30 years , told my group last year that the main park canoeists that she sees are men from 55 to 75 yrs. So I would guess a magazine catering to that age group about Northern Ontario would be a hit . Problem is the ads will be Viagra and Depends . LOL Speaking of Outdoor Life and Field and Stream magazines , while at the Deer and Turkey Show yesterday a free one year of either magazine came with the price of admission . Are they saying people won't buy it so they have to give it away ?"
3653770,dutchboy,2015-03-15 19:19:00,5717,"No what they are saying to their advertisers is "" we distribute to blank numbers of people thats why our advertising rate is what it is."" They are protecting their rates."
3654194,Da' Walleye Assassun,2015-03-15 22:18:00,358,Viagra can be an important addition on a fly-in. Keeps you from rolling out of the top bunk.
3654370,NUF,2015-03-16 04:58:00,94,I still like Fur-Fish-Game. I still like to trap even though I am in my 50's just a little slower. I do agree with most of the comments most magazines are all ads anymore. I think some of this is due to the fact that we have far less outdoor writers in this day and age of technology.
3654482,Bill Krejca,2015-03-16 06:27:00,6107,"Boundary Waters Journal is the one which I ended up keeping after, low, these many years. Excellent in all respects. A retention exception is my boxes of 1930's, 40's magazines which my dad had saved, and which I savor. The big 3 growing up, were Sports Afield, Outdoor Life, and Field And Stream. I guess, as a kid, I learned more about my developing interest from these than most others. Funny, so many folks complain about ads on magazines - I frankly enjoy most of them, they are about an endeavour of interest. Also, fewer ads is a harbinger of disappearing circulation = no more magazine. Many magazines seem to include more and more ""old news"" articles Although this may not be of interest to those of who have been at the sport for a while, it is wise to keep in mind that young folks/ new-to-the-sport folks have to start somewhere, so these may be of real interest and help to them. Articles trying to sell a product can be a real pita, especially those which really stand out as such. A good test of an ad disguised as an article is the multiple use of capital letters in the text (brand names) - these are a giveaway, and can be determined as easily as if being printed in fluorescent type. I normally make it a point not to read these. Usually. Been a long winter. Bill"

Darryl Cronzy had a show back in the day which focused mostly on fly in fishing destinations.Quote: Originally Posted by OgokiBy far my favorite magazine is the Boundary Waters Journal.

One an interesting travel piece on a ""preferably"" far north destination. Even if I know I'm never going to travel there it's nice to dream.Second I like reading stories, pieces of literature that are more narrative. That's what drew me to the ""big 3"" (Outdoor Life, Field and Stream, Sports Afield) as a young child. It was the tales of outdoor adventure. As a writer and a story teller at heart these are also the kinds of pieces I prefer to write. I can whip off a narrative piece easily. On the other hand writing a how - to piece on bottom bouncing for walleye is like giving birth - very difficult LOL!My vision of a magazine (and that's all it is is a vision ) would encompass the entire country and be dominated by far flung angling destinations nationwide. Nothing pedestrian - you wouldn't see a piece on downrigging for salmon in Lake Ontario, or drop shotting for bass on a busy cottage lake.Mixed in with that a bit of interesting narrative and some how-to stuff that's directly related (how to pack for a trip, how to plan a menu, shorelunch cooking, etc, etc..)Anyhow I love this thread and thank you for your thoughts.Hopefully didn't hijack it too much."
3661482,MikeinMN,2015-03-17 19:23:00,190,"My favorite outdoor magazines are Great Lakes Angler, In-Fisherman, Big River, and a weekly newspaper type deal called Outdoor News. Just because a few others have asked for opinions, here's a few of mine. I absolutely agree with a previous poster that a story should be continuous, not continued on page 97. I really like the ""lake of the week"" feature of Outdoor News, and I think Canadian resort owners would love to contribute some content to a ""lake of the week"" profile (and maybe also run an ad for at least that issue). I personally like a few adventure type stories thrown in. I may never actually get there, but I do have a fascination with the far north. I like a few historical stories now and then. For example, Canada has pictographs, abandoned POW camps, very old marked grave sites, and even a large abandoned resort that I read about on a canoe blog. I like the way Outdoor News has game warden incident reports weekly. I do like the occasional story about fish I don't normally catch. For example, I don't even know what a sheefish is, but I know there are some in Canada, and I would like to try to catch one if we ever cross paths. I kind of like a fish, game, or camp recipe page with a photo or two. That's enough opinions from me unless Mike B. would like to fly me in somewhere as a consultant. Think tax write-off Mike."
3661530,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2015-03-17 19:41:00,5533,"I HATE the ""lake of the week"" in the Outdoor News. I've personally seen it ruin a great lake. I canceled my subscription as soon as I saw that and they haven't got a dime from me since. Many years ago."
3664066,Bakefish,2015-03-18 14:47:00,1077,A friend of mine holds the world record sheefish at 53 lbs. He caught it in Alaska in the 1986.

3655002,jerry1928,2015-03-16 09:26:00,216,"My wife tells me I am the cause of the mailmans bad back. With my magazines and all the unwanted outdoor catalogs the mail box is full every day. I remember when Sports Afield went frome hunting fishing to Biking and hiking, I was going to cancel but I never got around to it. They almost went under, now it is back to hunting/guns and is one of my favorates, not for fishing but for hunting. Sports Afield gets you with 6 magazines a year instead of the normal 12. I agree, you can almost read the rest of them from the mail box to the recycle bin. I also would not keep track of when to renew, but my wife caught on. They would have me renew every 6 months so I was paid up for several years in advance."
3655402,Ogoki,2015-03-16 12:59:00,291,"Again it's probably not a big enough market to print something like that at least imo Mike , That is my exact thought too. Not a big enough market . Of all the guys I fish with in Ontario , four total, only one guys son ocassionally goes with us and that is canoe trips only as the others sons either have no interest or not the money for fly ins as they are making house payments , children etc. Lack of market was the reason , I was told was why ""Fishing the North Country "" went out."
3650802,michigan walleye guy,2015-03-14 22:41:00,95,"How many of you guys subscribe to 5 or more outdoors magazines? I was happy this a.m., finding the latest Outdoor Life issue in the mailbox, and pretty much read the whole thing before doing anything else today. Here are my favorites:Boundary Waters Journal--published 4 times a year; excellent mix of trip reviews, fishing articles, and canoe routes. The photography is generally outstanding, and the quality of the paper used to print the magazine is unparalleled. I archive and bind every issue at the end of the year.Ontario Out of Doors--pay a premium to get it delivered in the States, but worth every penny. Lots of walleye fishing articles and trip reviews, which I love more than anything. A close second to the BWJ. Mike Borger's connection to this site makes it even better.Field and Stream--Excellent writing, with generous doses of wit, sarcasm, and humility mixed in. Bill Heavey and David Petzel are two of the best writers of our generation. Again, my favorite articles are the trip review types. My only criticism is that there is a serious deer hunting bias in this mag., and I'm more of a fisherman.Fur-Fish-Game--old school to the core. If you're a trapper, there is no better reading. Photography leaves a lot to be desired.Midwest Outdoors--love the ""Canada Fever"" inserts during the winter months. Writing is very ""homespun,"" but also very good.Outdoor Life--sometimes reads like a Popular Mechanics mag., but enough of the good writing still shines through. My favorite magazine growing up, because of all the Canadian fishing articles, but has gone in a different, less effective direction the past few decades. Could be so much better.In Fisherman Magazine--another publication that has seriously gone downhill over the years, due to the loss of the Lindner brothers' influence. I still subscribe, mostly because of the ""North with Doc"" articles. What about you guys?"
3650850,last chance,2015-03-15 00:13:00,3262,"I always liked great lakes fisherman, the old one that is. and tied for 1st spot was florida sportsman. of course I read field and stream outdoor life and a lot of others. but I just got tired of reading and the books just piled up so when my subscriptions expired I forgot to renew. but I was an avid reader for something like 25+ yrs."
3650970,Mike Borger,2015-03-15 05:05:00,1554,"Hey thanks! Seeing as how we're on the topic of magazines I have a question for you guys. Don't mean to hijack the thread, but it's related.If there was a magazine that featured only top angling destinations across Canada would that interest you? I'm envisioning something thick and glossy with lots of amazing photography for each travel destination."
3651058,gumbygold,2015-03-15 06:14:00,252,I canceled all of mine because every few years the topics repeat and any new stuff is on the web before it ever hits print.
3651258,Ruddiger,2015-03-15 07:04:00,649,"Howdy,That was kind of what I was hoping Ontario Out Of Doors was when I paid for the subscription last winter. Upon refection my expectations were way off. Prior to subscribing the only copies I had ever seen were ones in fishing camps from around 8-10 years ago and it seemed perfect for me. Lots of good fishing articles and spotlights on certain waters. Once I got the magazine, however, it just felt like a rehashing of Field and Stream. Don't get me wrong as its a well done magazine, however, WAAAAAYYYY too much hunting coverage and most of the fishing information was really rudimentary at best. Again, its not the fault of the magazine that it did not meet my expectations, but it wasn't something I wanted to renew after receiving it for a year. What you described was what I hoped I was getting.Take care,Ruddiger"
3651314,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2015-03-15 07:16:00,5533,"I've got just two left the are still coming I am going to cancel. Then that's it for magazines cluttering up my house. The magazines are no good anymore. All adds. If I can read the entire thing from the mailbox to the front door, that's pitiful."
3651426,dutchboy,2015-03-15 07:37:00,5717,"Keep in mind that ""real"" magazines & newspapers provide instant access for young people & kids. I understand all the on-line guys but how many times have kids looked at a magazine you were reading and then asked a question? I know my way of life is passing but I can't help but hope that some paper survives as I think it has immense value. Mike your idea sounds good. Quality photography is always fun to look at. However try to keep a 75 / 25% balance on scenery vs fish. Hit many species, but I don't need to see 30 Walleyes, the only thing different is there size. Good thread."
3651530,BenBeattie,2015-03-15 07:50:00,232,"I'll defend Ontario OUT OF DOORS (OOD), not just because mike and I are writers for that magazine, but because I think it's a great publication. I much prefer an actual magazine to anything online. In my opinion OOD is the most relevant magazine for what I love - Fishing AND Hunting in ONTARIO. In-fish doesn't appeal to me as much as a lot of the content is for things I'll never fish for in areas I'll never travel to.As for the ads… how else are they going to pay the bills?? Bottom line, there is no better magazine for fishing coverage that is strictly Ontario based. And there's a bunch of writers from NW Ontario… Jeff Gustafson, Drew Myers, Gord Ellis and myself included. Thanks to the OP for the mention and kind words about Ontario OUT OF DOORS. It was my fav long before I ever got into outdoor writing."

I wonder if my kids would do the same or if they are to into technology.Back to the original idea, the articles stink. They are the same stuff over and over again. All about promoting the sponsor. Show the same fish/deer/etc 37 times. 75% of the magazine is adds.You are right about the photography. That's how we started attempting to copy some photography techniques. HOWEVER, along those lines I see some guides over utilizing the same photo techniques again and again and again. It's gets redundant."
