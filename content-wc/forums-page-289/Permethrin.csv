3678586,Slushfish,2015-03-22 13:14:00,263,"We had trouble with the ankle biting ""beach flies"" on LOTW. Started using Sawyer and Ultrathon from WalMart or Gander but for the same price, you can buy permethrin concentrate and mix gallons of it. Spray it in the boat or on clothes for beach flies and skeeters, not sure on black flies."
3684162,Gipper,2015-03-23 19:59:00,76,I use a product called Farm and Dairy fly spray. It contains Pyrethrins. I spray it on the floor of the boat from time-to-time when the black flies are active. No one has to apply any chemicals such as DEET directly then. It keeps the black flies away for awhile. I found it at Farm and Fleet but any product with Pyrethrins would work I'm sure. I believe dairy farmers use it on livestock.
3656954,Draco1206,2015-03-16 18:41:00,175,"Anybody ever use Permethrin to keep black flies and mosquitos away? I know nothing works better than 100% deet. I just hate using deet, melts the plastic on your reel handles and fishing line, and just not good for you. God forbid if you ever get it in your eyes or mouth. With Permethrin you saturate your clothing with it and it's supposed to keep all manner of evil little buggers away from you. I also heard of a new product from Australia called Bioshield, anyone ever use this stuff? Can't find much info about it on line. Anyways first hand knowledge is always better."
3657018,Pikeslayer8,2015-03-16 18:49:00,1460,I've used the Orvis Buzz-Off shirts for years and swear by it. I've gone many a trip without using bug dope at all. Might be that my blood is just intolerable for most skeeters. http://www.walmart.com/ip/21947774?w...591192&veh=sem I use this on all my clothes in addition to the shirts.
3657042,adempsey,2015-03-16 18:56:00,963,"It's very similar to Allethrin, which is what's used in the Thermacells and other repellents. So, I'd imagine it would work as well as that."
3657074,bigdaddyguns,2015-03-16 19:01:00,608,"For the ankle biting flies, we have had protection using Coppertone Spray Sunblock and/or Repel Lemon Eucalyptus Repellent especially on exposed skin. The Repel spray should work on clothing too. Mid summer the mosquito's are manageable but the flies can be overwhelming."
3657474,rather-be-fishin,2015-03-16 20:18:00,429,We have had good luck with this product for biting black flies in the boat. whitemountaininsectrepellent.com RBF
3657626,ftfarms,2015-03-16 20:55:00,444,I use permethrin around home for flies and Mosquitos but never took it up north. Last year the end of may and first part of june the Mosquitos were the worst I've ever seen them. Any dose of deet Didn't work any longer than a half hour. Cooper tone sunblock spay about the same whitemountaininsectrepelant was as good. Permethrin was probly the only thing I didn't have to try. I hope to never see them that bad ever again.
3657666,Pikeslayer8,2015-03-16 21:03:00,1460,Same week as mine last year. I came outta camp with only a couple bites and I think they got me in my bunk. This year I plan on spraying down my sleeping bag with permethrin.
3658778,youngknight,2015-03-17 08:00:00,228,"Just be careful guys applying permethrin out on the water - it is considered highly toxic to fish and other aquatic life...it doesn't take much overspray into the water to cause an issue - on that you will not see or make a connection to, but it is there."
3659146,pjshorthorn,2015-03-17 09:29:00,5654,Coppertone Sports sunblock works pretty well to repel skeeters and flies. Apply a couple of times a day to keep the bugs away. I think it helps prevent sunburn also. I use other products with Deet etc. but that is not my first choice unless the bugs are unbearable. I love a good breeze....less bugs and good chop on the water = good walleye fishing!!!PjShorthorn.
