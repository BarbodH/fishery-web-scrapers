3530002,1/4 oz Jig,2015-02-10 19:50:00,90,"This rod is warrantied from St. Croix for 5yrs so i don't think it's worth getting the protection from bass pro. St. Croix is a great company and stand by they're products. I never registered the rod or anything. I would recommend registering it on they're website but if you don't theres some letters on the rod that are the manufacture date that they go by. I did ask them if there was a problem with this rod because it seemed odd that it would break right away and they said not that they were aware of, but this was last summer and this rod series is new."
3533554,NY Walleye,2015-02-11 16:09:00,78,St criox honors their warranty. Broke a rod recently and paid for shipping they took care of the rest. Great rods
3533834,polaris-pete,2015-02-11 17:20:00,343,I agree they are good rods but what good is a Warranty when you're on a fly in fishing trip and the rod that you bought purposely for these trips break!!
3534130,wallydave,2015-02-11 18:58:00,2151,I have done the Bass Pro trade-in like you did. The eyecons have been great to use! When you can feel the jig sliding down rocks when fishing in current you have a great rod in your hands! Happy fishing !
3684346,fleegs,2015-03-23 20:21:00,8,I'm looking at the 63MLXF and pairing it with a Pflueger President or Supreme. Is this strictly a vertical jig rod or will it be fine for other applications?
3685474,bigwalleye1,2015-03-24 07:15:00,2632,"Huh? So are you advocating for a different rod or for not buying a rod with a warranty? What good does no warranty do? A rod without a warranty puts you in the same place on a flyin as a rod WITH a warranty. A busted rod. If the quality is there, the warranty is a backup plan. Having a warranty issue on a trip sucks, but at least the rod can be replaced once you get home. That's the whole idea in carrying a backup rod."
3685802,camp chef,2015-03-24 08:19:00,915,This a great rod for all types of applications. I have one and really love it.
3685882,fleegs,2015-03-24 08:31:00,8,Great thanks. It's first test will be a trip to Lac Seul in June. Then the lakes of MN.
3686594,adempsey,2015-03-24 11:38:00,963,"I own several St.Croix rods and whenever I am in the market for a rod, that's who I go to first. Although, not a St.Croix, my favorite Walleye rod is a one piece 6'3"" medium extra fast. The only problem is I rarely use it because it's one piece. I don't have my own boat or a truck, so hauling around one piece rods can be a real pain. I don't know about you guys, but for me it's often more hassle than it's worth. Especially on a fly-in.I use a Falmbeau Bazooka Pro rod tube. Maybe I need a new rod case?"
3688570,Aspencreek,2015-03-24 20:21:00,2911,"I will be driving by the St Croix factory again in a couple weeks in Park falls WI. They have a nice showroom and sales racks for 2nd's. My collection of St Croixs are all considered seconds, and if you can find the errors on any of them, I'll give it to you. And the prices, are worth the trip. I certainly don't need anymore rods but I always find one I need when I stop in."
3526370,Knoxabilly,2015-02-09 21:02:00,225,"I pulled the trigger on a 6'3"" eyecon today from basspro! I saved $20 off by trading in an old rod. I plan on pairing it with a Pfluger President size 30. Can't wait to feel the first ""tap tap"" on this bad boy. Any one else have experience with these? Spring fever is in full effect here!"
3526666,rsiminski,2015-02-10 05:48:00,53,"Last year I purchased an eyecon rod 6""6"" jig n rig 2 piece rod partnered with a flueger president reel for fly in trips. I can say it is a phenominal rod and I couldnt be more happy with the results. The sensitivity is outstanding, you wont be dissapointed."
3527066,Mike Borger,2015-02-10 07:26:00,1554,"Love the feel of the rod - bought two for my kids to use last year and I ended up using them.But, both rods broke right near the tip, and I'm pretty careful with my stuff."
3527194,1/4 oz Jig,2015-02-10 08:02:00,90,"I fully agree with Mike. I had a 6'3"" eyecon it was a light rod and very sensitive. I loved it until I set the hook and the tip just snapped off broke the line and fell in the lake. I'm thinking there might be some issues with the quality of this rod. I know the eyecon and mojo lines are manufactured in mexico. I called St. Croix when I got home and they said they would replace it. Instead I decided to take advantage of they're upgrade service and got a legend tournament instead. Just paid the difference between the eyecon and legend tournament which I think was $120."
3527586,Algoma Guy,2015-02-10 09:39:00,48,Iv'e got the 7ft 2 piece. It is the best rod I have ever owned. The sensitivity and overall feel of the rod suits me perfectly. I have noticed though that since I put power pro on my reel I am tangling right around the tip a lot for no reason. What line were you guys using when you broke the tips?
3528138,1/4 oz Jig,2015-02-10 11:40:00,90,I was using berkley nanofil either 6 or 8 lb. I really liked the rod but breaking after 4 days of use was a bummer. I was definitely able to see a difference in sensitivity when I switched to the backup rod.
3528418,Knoxabilly,2015-02-10 12:54:00,225,Bass Pro offered replacement on it for 2 years for $24- I think I will definitely take advantage of this from hearing about the tip issue. I broke the tip of a Triumph but it was like 8yrs old and my premier has been really good thus far. I appreciate the feedback guys!!
3529514,gordy28,2015-02-10 17:21:00,437,wow - talk about a timely thread I am also on the market for a 6'3 mxf rod for jigging Would have bought the eyecon on Saturday at the new BPS in Niagara had they had it in stock Wanted to compare against the same set up in the Avid but they didnt have any in stock based on the tip issue think I will upgrade to the Avid cheers gordy
3529586,FloridaRigger,2015-02-10 17:45:00,335,I was told that if a rod wasnt in stock you could have them order it and still do the rod trade in.
3529802,polaris-pete,2015-02-10 18:37:00,343,I had the exact same rod in my hands at Cabelas last week but the only one they had was the display model and really wanted a new one instead of the display. Looked and felt like a really nice rod and the Cabelas guy said they were coming in next week. For $130 I don't expect a rod tip to break! I bought an Okuma ( DEAD-EYE) in the same length and action and hope it will give me better service than the St. Croix would. I have a couple 13 Fishing Omens in this length and action but they are both 1 piece rods and hard to get on a float plane with out damages.I hope St.Croix gets this problem fixed.Some of their ice rods had a lot of issues last year also. Rods shattering and guides that were so far out of line they could not be slightly bent back. I still like this Eyecon and may call St. Croix tomorrow to inquire on the problem.
