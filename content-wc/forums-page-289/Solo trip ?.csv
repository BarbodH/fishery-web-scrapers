3687722,fosterthedog,2015-03-24 17:25:00,51,"So here's the story, my employer gave me an extra week of paid vacation this year. We do our regular trip in late June to Quebec and can't get any one (in our group) interested in doing a late trip (September ) so it looks like I'm on my own. I'd be willing to fly to western Ontario, Manitoba looking for an outpost camp without renting a car, hate paying to rent when it sits idle for 6 days. I need walleye, propane, and an outhouse to satisfy my needs. Any outfitters that will pick you up at the airport and fly you in? I've done trips out of Thunder Bay a couple of times and not what I was looking for. I fish long range trips out of San Diego (in January)and that is my fallback option (to go in the summer), but I'd love to be in the Great North for a week in the summer rather than in the Baja. Any opinions, options, or advice appreciated. Thanks Steve"
