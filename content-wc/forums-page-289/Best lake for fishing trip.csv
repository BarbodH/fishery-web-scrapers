3689570,Guest,2015-03-25 06:36:00,0,"Try Gow-Bush-Kon Lodge in Gowganda, great walleye fishing, lake trout ,jumbo perch,no closed season on bass and pike, Lots of other lakes close by to try depending how adventurous you are."

Become a productive contributor and business will come naturally when users recognize your knowledge. Pay attention to the posts of the more respected members on this site who operate lodges or guiding businesses. In spite of the fact that you may be enamoured with Lake Muskoka, it would be difficult to suggest there is world class fishing for anything there. I grew up close by and would never consider recommending it unless you want to provide a guided tour of million dollar boat houses as you try to avoid pleasure craft operators. The gent is from PA so he does have some impressive fishing at his disposal on Erie or Quinte but if your idea of a Canadian vacation involves trolling for walleye on the Great Lakes then have at it. My suggestion would be to fly into Thunder Bay or Winnipeg rent a car, get yourself into NW Ontario between Kenora and Ignace/Sioux Lookout and experience drive-to walleye fishing like you have never imagined. Lac Seul comes to mind but ther are many headwater lakes on the English River system that are simply amazing."

3633930,Eyehunter2230,2015-03-10 09:58:00,110,Hey everyone! A buddy and myself were thinking about taking the boat up to canada this year for a fishing trip. I have been looking online for places to go and they all look like they would be great to fish. Does anyone have any suggestions on places to go whether it be a Fishing Lodge or just a good lake to fish on! Thanks!!-Chris
3633970,Fisherman Ted,2015-03-10 10:02:00,461,"Glad you are heading up to have some fun. However you need to be more specific on many levels: - what part of the country do you want to head to - what do you want to target - how do you want to target - what time of year - what is your price range - lodge, campground? - how long a trip are you looking for? etc"
3634066,Eyehunter2230,2015-03-10 10:21:00,110,"You are right, sorry about that. We were thinking about heading up to Ontario in the summer (August-September) to target walleyes. We prefer to jig but are willing to fish for them however we need to in order to catch them. I was thinking about a 4 days of actual fishing. I would like to fish some chain lakes but I am afraid that my boat will not be able to navigate the channels so a bigger lake will have to suffice."
3634114,WalleyeWally28,2015-03-10 10:30:00,298,"Check out Whitewing Resort on Lac Seul. Nice cabins, great owners and fantastic walleye fishing.www.whitewingresort.com"
3635162,tuiflies,2015-03-10 14:43:00,158,Donnelly's Minnitaki Lake Lodge is my suggestion.
3639122,fosterthedog,2015-03-11 13:54:00,51,"I see you are from Pittsburgh, long drive to western Ontario for for 4 days fishing. I would consider eastern Ontario, Sudbury and to the north, it's a 12 hr trip rather than 24+. Did a quick Google search (eastern Ontario fishing lodges) and saw several. I fish in Quebec,flyin trips, and would add more hours of driving from Pittsburgh,than where I live."
3639346,Seanik,2015-03-11 15:08:00,218,"Hi Eyehunter2230. Check your private messages, may be what you are looking for, Seanik (jerry)"
3639418,SinOrSwim,2015-03-11 15:42:00,1528,"Also, remember most poeople will recommend the lodge they go to no matter what. Not saying that is a bad thing. But, ask someone what kind of TV to buy. Guarantee we all say buy what is hanging on our wall. But, everyone is different. Even within our group there are some who love the owners and some who don't think much of them at all. This is a great place to get some ideas but also, as long as you do your reserach and find the places that have the things YOU want, you will have a blast."
3639666,fosterthedog,2015-03-11 16:49:00,51,"X2, Do you're own research its part of making the trip you guys want it to be. PM Mike Borger he's fished all throughout Canada and will be more than helpful. You've got plenty of time to figure it out and are going at the time of year when lodges/camps want your business. Great time to catch some big fish,not so much numbers, but big ones and eaters are always close by."
3639722,Eyehunter2230,2015-03-11 16:59:00,110,I've done a good bit of research and have found a couple good places. Lots of members here have been extremely helpful too!!
