3665410,ILScott,2015-03-18 20:07:00,139,It is owned by Wine Lake Camp and that is where people that go into Wine start their adventure. I have heard people catching walleye right at the falls by the cabin. Every time I have gone into Wine there has been a boat right before you go into the next part of the lake.
3674314,HeHooksHimself,2015-03-20 22:04:00,725,"We pick up our boats from Herb there at the Eagles Nest. Their operation is primarily on Wine Lake, where we go. Most people only use that cabin for Friday nights and take their boats to Wine Lake Camp for the week. There is a huge difference between the two bodies of water. Wabby is busy with many cabins and camps. Wine Lake is remote and only accessible by portage. Some camps on Wabby use the Wine Lake system as a remote day trip. We have been going to Wine Lake Camp for 15 years. There is a reason we only use Wabby to get us to the portage. But, Wabby may just be your cup of tea. The fishing seems to be pretty good there. In any case, tight lines and fish on!"
3675722,billy weaver,2015-03-21 13:55:00,470,"You are right about the comparison between Wabby and Wine. We go to Peffleys on Wabaskang. We have been going there for 26 years and always make a trip to Beaver Lake at least once every year for fishing and a shore lunch. The access to Beaver is from Wine. There is more boat traffic on Wabby, but having electricity with hot water showers in every cabin is necessary for us old f--ts. In our younger years we would portage the second set of falls and go north to Sharon Lake. We have our best fishing (by far) in a smaller hike in lake called Lost Lake. Lost Lake is a catch and release lake with boats maintained by Peffley. There are guys who fish for Lakers in Wine using down riggers (in June). I do have friends who go to Wine Lake every year and speak highly of Herb and the camp."
3676666,Guest,2015-03-21 20:15:00,0,"Thanks for the info guys. My wife developed some mobility problems, so trips into the back country are out now, although I still go. Nice comfi camp will do just fine. Billy weaver, you mentioned Lakers. Sounds like there are some in Wabaskang, have you ever chased them? Plan to spend a morning or two giving it a try. Sounds like Aerobus Bay is the place to be."
3678034,billy weaver,2015-03-22 10:16:00,470,"I have not fished for Lakers in Wabaskang in June as they would be in deep water and require downriggers or heavy weighted rigs. The guys from our camp who do fish for Lakers with downriggers go to Wine Lake. We do catch Lakers in shallow water during the first week of the season at the first portage (north end). I am sure there are guys who can give you tips on Laker fishing in June but am busy fishing for Walleye, Pike and Yellow Perch and can't seem to find time for Lakers but I would like too."
3678538,Walleye_Guru,2015-03-22 13:06:00,62,"I'd call the local MNR for that region. Ask for the fisheries biologist or a tech that covers that lake. First question out of my mouth after a super polite greeting would be ""was the lake ever surveyed?"". There were a handful of lakes in Ontario that were surveyed back in the late sixties early seventies. Who knows, you might get lucky. If they have copies of the maps, see if you can get a hold of it. Odds are they won't know or won't send you one if it exists. They don't want to be inundated with people trying the same things But it is worth a shot. Next, hit Google Earth. I take a screen shot of the lakes and paste it into powerpoint. Then I use PP's design feature and trace the outside of the lakes and all the islands. Whola! There's your custom made lake map! I make several copies. One just of the lake and the others for potential walleye spots, pike spots, lakers ect. Put it all in a nice little folder and there you go. Easy reference for when you do talk to someone with hot bite info or mark waypoints later on. You could also visit (http://www.web2.mnr.gov.on.ca/fish_o...plorer_en.html) I did check quickly and did not find your lake. good Luck!"
3678714,billy weaver,2015-03-22 14:14:00,470,Go to Peffley's Camp web site there is a good topo map of Wabaskang that you can get. I think most of the web sites of Wabaskang Camps have some kind of map you can down-load.
3680962,UKBDM,2015-03-23 06:54:00,178,"We have some guys in our group who consistently catch lakers in Aerobus Bay the last week of June. I wouldn't call it ""fast"" action but they usually catch 4-5 during the course of the week. Probably don't spend 4-5 hours total doing it. Dipsy Divers and 2.5-3.0"" spoons in 35-50' of water. Silver/green, silver/blue, or hammered nickel seem to be the ticket."
3681082,ftfarms,2015-03-23 07:13:00,444,"I caught my first laker up in Aerobus around the first day of june a couple years ago. I was casting a whistler jig with a worm in the rocks in the narrows half way up in Aerobus 22"" little laker He come out of 8' of water It was late ice out that year and they were still shallow."
3663138,Guest,2015-03-18 10:18:00,0,"Have a cabin on Wabaskang lake booked starting June 13th. First trip to this lake. Plan to work on the Walleyes and maybe get into some Lakers. It's a large body of water, I sure would appreciate any info about fishing the lake this time of the year."
3663826,HeHooksHimself,2015-03-18 13:31:00,725,There has been lots of info on Wabby in the last few years. Just check out the search feature.
3664018,Guest,2015-03-18 14:24:00,0,"Thanks HeHooksHimself, I'll try it."
3664330,billy weaver,2015-03-18 15:46:00,470,"I'll be at Wabaskang the week of June 13, what camp will you be at? This will be our 25th year."
3664386,Guest,2015-03-18 16:02:00,0,We will be at The Eagles Nest cabin. Its part of Wine Lake Camp. Where are you?
3664418,teddi,2015-03-18 16:08:00,349,Wine lake camp is on Wine Lake not Wabaskang. You have to cross to get to wine lake and make a portage.
3664562,JAY221,2015-03-18 16:46:00,877,"I believe that Wine Lake has the first or second residence up the channel from Tall Pines that they rent out on Wabaskang. Later, Jay"
3664586,billy weaver,2015-03-18 16:54:00,470,"The Wine Lake camp owner has a cabin to rent on Wabaskang right at Perrault Falls. It would be the south end of Wabaskang near four or five other camps. My group will be at Peffley's Camp on the north end of the lake. There is a member Mike Kansas I believe that knows Wabaskang as good as anyone, if you need tips look for his threads."
3664650,billy weaver,2015-03-18 17:17:00,470,Make that Big Mike instead of Mike Kansas although both can give you good advice for fishing Canadian waters. I think Big Mike has a relative that has a camp near where you are staying.
3665346,ftfarms,2015-03-18 19:54:00,444,Richs rocks at that time can be good Steve's trees. Harold's point and mikes cove are all good at that time of year.
