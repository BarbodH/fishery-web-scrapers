3672954,MrSimon,2015-03-20 14:00:00,922,"In my opinion, just do the drive. There is something special about looking out the car window and watching the world you know slowly melt away and become the Northern Canadian Wilderness."
3676306,LoDo,2015-03-21 17:19:00,721,"Our Denver group of 6 have flown into Minneapolis or Int Falls the last 7 years. We are joined by 2 in a 1988 Forester that carries all our gear, grocery and supplies. We roll 8 deep to Red Lake, sleep in the Chimo Air parking lot until they open. From there Chimo fly's us in Woodland Caribou Prov Park. This year, we are seriously looking into flying to Winnipeg and taking a charter to Woodland Caribou. The price is a bit more, but it might be worth the change."
3665586,Aspencreek,2015-03-18 20:32:00,2911,Now if I had to drive from Phoenix........
3665626,Tonyo,2015-03-18 20:37:00,212,"Funny this topic comes up this year. I have worked a deal for air travel for my brother and my dad to Red Lake from Kansas City International. KC to Minneapolis, Minneapolis to Winnipeg, Winnipeg to Red Lake. 15 minute drive to camp. Yeah it was a little pricy, $1K each but man will it be worth it. Long story but it may be the last trip my brother may ever make and it got my dad to go again after 6 or 7 years not going because of the drive. The bonus plan is now that dad is going my uncle is going too. Money is less important than family and friends and I guarantee you this will be the best trip to Canada our group will ever make. Counting the days until we are all in camp together. TonyO"
3665682,rnnonmt,2015-03-18 20:49:00,992,I got a good laugh on this one. Being in the aircraft business I have available a lot of options but it is still cheaper to drive there in a gas guzzling RV towing my boat and take 3 weeks off on my salary to go to Canada than charter an aircraft and be gone for only one week. I really wish it was the other way around!!!
3666346,Lake Wisconsin,2015-03-19 06:59:00,1960,"A buddy I use to go to Canada with is a full time comercial pilot. He has access to some pretty decent rates for smaller planes. Even when we took into account the plane would just sit on the runway for a week while we were up there, the cost was still way to high for us to consider. Simply cost prohibitive for us."
3666386,pjshorthorn,2015-03-19 07:08:00,5654,"This thread really peaked my interest and for grins I took a look at a couple of charter services from Atlanta to Sioux Lookout,ON - 6 people - 7 days. For a 1400 mile trip, the minimum aircraft suggested was a ""light"" jet. The initial price was $16-17K with a lot of other potential fees that were not outlined until the charter service understood the trip details. Regardless, Ron's comments were spot on....cheaper to drive the gas guzzling RV and enjoy the scenery along the way.PjShorthorn"
3666602,MrSimon,2015-03-19 08:03:00,922,"An RV is an interesting alternative. They aren't cheap, but they sure are comfy for long trips!! And flying isn't as fast as you think, especially if you have a few connections. Factor in driving to the airport, waiting for a few hours, the flight, layovers, customs, baggage, rental car etc etc etc .... it's still an all day event for sure - and hectic. If flying, I assume you buy all your food once you arrive?"
3670570,Aspencreek,2015-03-19 21:04:00,2911,"Our group considered an RV also, then after thinking about it, driving 502 would not be appealing, I see too many struggling up and around those grades and I don't want to be one of them."
3671714,rnnonmt,2015-03-20 08:02:00,992,"Ive been on a few charters before. Unfortunately for work and not play. Im an aircraft mechanic and had to rescue one of our planes when it was in Bangor Maine. I went from Phoenix to Bangor direct (no stops) in a Citation X. It was the fastest corporate jet at the time (kind of still is) but the bill was about $55,000 USD round trip. 10hrs total round trip of flying time... the aircraft only had to wait for me for about 6 hours as I repaired the airplane. You can do the math.... that's about $5500 per flight hour."
3671810,LOW1,2015-03-20 08:19:00,2828,"For us its 650 miles to our cabin. I find that 12 hour trip to be the perfect distance. For me the drive is relaxing. I like to hit the road at about 4:00 am and try to be in Cloquet MN at noon. From there its north with pine trees having replaced the cornfields, the temperature starting to drop, and water coming more and more into view. So no, I would never exchange a relaxing 12 hour drive for a six hour flight/airport experience, the chance to get grounded/killed by a thunderstorm, or the opportunity to get sick in a small plane and puke in my tackle box."
3672066,bushead11,2015-03-20 09:11:00,151,"Guys - Thanks for the responses and I agree with you all 100%. A commercial flight or paying 5-50K for a plane is not my cup of tea. My question was more based along the lines of: if anyone has gotten a ""hook up"" from a friend or has been offered a flight up in a plane vs. driving. So our situation is this: We have our gear and a total of 6 guys. 4 in Madison, WI and 2 in Chicago. The Chicago guys would drive the whole way and pull a trailer with all our stuff. One of our guys here in Madison has a client who is a pilot with access to a plane that would fit the pilot and 4 other guys.... So. Do we try to figure out what the gas cost and pilot time is worth to them or just do the drive. It would cut down the travel by about 10 hours and give the family guys an extra night with the wife and kids to lessen the ""im not your babysitter for a week"" complaints.... Thoughts?"
3663330,bushead11,2015-03-18 11:08:00,151,"Only thing i hate about the trip is the 13 hour drive to get there... Commercial flights are over $1,400. Wondering if anyone has ever chartered a flight or knows a pilot in Ear falls...? Any recommendations would be awesome!"
3663386,Mike Borger,2015-03-18 11:14:00,1554,The cost to charter a plane is prohibitive. Surprised you're saying commercial flights are so much. I've flown from Pearson in Toronto to Thunder Bay a number of times over the last couple of years and the return flight has been around $240.Some of the outfitters fly directly out of Thunder Bay which makes things incredibly convenient. Last fall when I fished Whitewater Lake with MLO we rented a minivan for the week at the airport in Thunder Bay then drove 21/2 hours to the jump off point in Armstrong. Cost roughly $150 each for the van rental and was totally worth it.
3663410,SinOrSwim,2015-03-18 11:17:00,1528,I looked at this a couple years ago. Looked at a private plane from Ankeny Iowa to I-Falls. It was like 9 grand for a 4 seater and 13 grand for a 8 seater. That is EACH way. Because you are paying for both the flight up and back and then up and back again. I don't remember the exact costs but it was crazy expensive.
3663522,bushead11,2015-03-18 11:44:00,151,We have a few contacts that are pilots but do not own a plane big enough to hold 6 guys. We have room for 2 more in our outpost and were thinking of trying to find a pilot that would want to stay the week and we would chip in or pay for his trip...
3663770,Pooch,2015-03-18 13:05:00,4619,"I wish we only had a thirteen hour drive. Our trip is around twenty four hours each way of seat time. Day and a half up and the same coming home. Butt test.We use the time to just unwind into and out of the trip. Talk things over and pick up last minute supplies on the way up then just readjust back to work on the way home.I enjoy the time in the truck together coming and going. The long drive wears us down, but heck we are with friends and that is invaluable.Kind of like fishing the wind, don't fight it, use it to your advantage.Pooch"
3663834,Golden Eagle,2015-03-18 13:32:00,2642,"1400 miles, one way, for me for multiple trips per year. Usually a solo in October. It works."
3664226,Old Timer,2015-03-18 15:14:00,255,"I believe there is commercial service from the states to Thunder Bay and International Falls. There are plenty of outfitters within 50 miles, both fly-in and drive-in, who will pick you up at either airport for a fee if you don't want to rent a van. I have friends who have flown from Colorado to International Falls several times. On different trips they've been picked up by the outfitter, caught a shuttle bus or rented a van to reach outfitters within fifty miles.A charter plane will choke a horse. Pick an outfitter close to IF or TB and you'll have plenty of options. And by the way, not all good fishing is at the end of the road."
3665338,kayakmatt,2015-03-18 19:53:00,105,"I've pondered this topic for years. We all know that there are numerous individuals or groups that are leaving for fishing trips to ontario from major metropolitan midwest, and even southeast US cities say the second week of June. If there was a way for even 10 of them to meet and coordinate, they could likely arrange a non stop direct flight to INL or even Souix Lookout from their major city. I know I'd be interested...as I just paid $1400 for two of us to get to Winnipeg! I know every summer I meet fellow Tennesseans in Canada, and would confidently say there are probably at least a 100 Tennesseans fishing in NW Ontario the second week of June...and we all mutually exclusively found are own expensive and burdensome way up there.lI met a guy a few years ago that wanted to solve this problem of empty corporate airplanes deadheading all over the country. He started a company called Social Flights...a Facebook to hook airplanes to passengers...looks like his concept didn't make it! http://uncommonbusiness.blogspot.com...com-review.htmRegardless, there should be a way a large group of NW Ontario fisherman could hookup and charter a plane to their central destination and save all the commercial airline hassles behind."
3665450,Aspencreek,2015-03-18 20:13:00,2911,"13 hr drive to ear falls........I really do mean no disrespect here, because some people just can't endure being in a vehicle for that long, but I am in my truck from 8am until 6pm every weekday, that drive from Madison to Ear Falls is easy for me. But one way it works for me is our camp is Fri to Fri, we leave on thurs morning and stop in Ft. Francis overnight, stay at the Super 8, have a good meal next door, a good breakfast at the motel, get our groceries at the safeway and I'm on the water by 1-2pm. On the way home it's non-stop except gas, and the McDonalds stop in IF (that is a must). A good way to make the trip easier is gas stops ever 200 miles, everybody out, bathroom breaks and snacks, XM/Sirius radio if you have it, and a good snappy conversation. If you are dragging the wife along....my apologies and sympathies."
3665458,rnnonmt,2015-03-18 20:14:00,992,If there was anything I could give advise on this is it. Aircraft charter will NEVER be less expensive than commercial air travel. I have been in this business for almost 20 years. The only way charter pays off is if your TIME is WORTH more than your TICKET. Bottom line... that's it.
