To the north to Farewell Bay and to the south through a shallow opening towards Bay of Islands.We have only stayed at LSL one year, but are looking forward to returning this July and I've thought about this all winter. Are these two openings always open? Especially the south opening? Is one or the other seasonal?Anyone with experience in that area know for sure? Looks like if the lake is really down you could be trapped in the bays.Pooch"
3687258,Carnhzkr,2015-03-24 14:57:00,964,"Pooch, what Rod told me two years ago was that the shortcut (southern route) is usually not navigable for the first few weeks of the season. If that's the case, the longer trip around the north is always open. Being a reservoir, the water level in LS rises during the summer."
3687522,Shotgun,2015-03-24 16:15:00,759,We've used the south route the first week of July. Had to slow down to an idle and raise the motor as high as possible. Never hit anything but there were several trees sticking up. As I recall it's not a long way around if it is too shallow. If you go onto/download Google Earth and put in Ear Falls Ontario you can very easily find Rat Bay to the south and see the routes.
3688498,Pooch,2015-03-24 20:08:00,4619,"We've traversed both ways numerous time, but the south pass is handier when headed south. You're right in that there really isn't that much difference going through the north opening.Last year was my first year in that area of LS and the water was still fairly high so I didn't really get to see a normal pool for that time of the year. Even the north opening isn't all that deep if I remember correctly. Lots of stumps if I remember.I was surprised that we didn't catch many fish in the two bays between LSL and either opening. We were there just prior to July fourth last year. Maybe earlier in the year there are more fish in those back bays.Anyone going to be at LSL over the fourth of July this year? Met carnhzker there last year and enjoyed his company on several occasions.Pooch"
3689530,Shotgun,2015-03-25 06:26:00,759,"Pooch, I would have to agree as we never caught many walleye in the bays either. However, after supper we'd fished along the bank on the opposite side of the lodge and caught some nice size pike. One of our best areas for walleye was as you come out of the south pass trolling around the islands to the east. Did well there for walleye. Your going a few weeks ahead of us. Would be interested in your success.Have a safe trip."
