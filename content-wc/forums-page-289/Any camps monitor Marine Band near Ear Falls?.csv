One group I fish with does in the fall, but earlier last summer my wife and I were in the Mckenzie Bay area and there was no traffic on the radio at all. When you get over near Mahkwa there is some chatter all day long. I think Mahkwa camp might monitor, but I'm not sure which channel they listen to.Just wondering.Pooch"
