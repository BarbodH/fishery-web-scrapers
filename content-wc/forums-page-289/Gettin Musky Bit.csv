3688290,zeebee,2015-03-24 19:29:00,1144,Been fishin for walleye for years. This 2015 Im gonna try an Oct vacation and chase Musky. Big fish equate to bigger adrenaline rush. Anyone else been thru the process?
3689482,BornToFish,2015-03-25 06:03:00,1224,"I am primarily a walleye fisherman, but love chasing muskies. I have vacationed in NW Ontario the last several years for about ten days during the middle of September. I experienced a fantastic musky bite during some of these trips. The key seems to be hitting the weather and water temperature trends at just the right time. I found that the muskies often move shallow just before turnover. The weeds are typically fading fast, which seems to congregate the muskies and bigger northern pike. I move a large jerk bait (e.g. a Suick or Bobby Bait) slowly around the few remaining stands of cabbage weed that I can find. Three stalks of cabbage weed in close proximity to each other can be magical. I watch the wind to take advantage of any slightly elevated water temperatures that the wind might cause due to piling surface water in bays. This bite seems to break down when the water turns over.The key has been moving the bait slowly. My personal best fish came with the jerk baits laying motionless on the surface of the water at boatside.I was in NW Ontario during approximately 10-25 September 2014. The above musky bite did not develop while I was fishing. The autumn weather was so warm while I was fishing that it probably happened after I left for home. I caught several nice fish during the same time frame in 2012.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

Granted, it's not as exciting as hooking up while casting, but it's a heck of a lot more exciting than not hooking up at all. You'll cover a lot more water this way, and it seems that you'll hook musky in areas you probably wouldn't be casting. Go figure. I do this out of necessity because I just can't put in the casting hours I once could."

You could catch the muskie fever. If you do get out the check book, the equipment is not cheap. And one more thing Good Luck"
3690634,Larbo,2015-03-25 11:24:00,231,On my last trip to LOTW's last year I did not bring my walleye gear. I would now rather catch one 45-55 inch musky than 100 walleye in a day.
3691330,NP4ME,2015-03-25 14:54:00,378,"Exactly! Don't do it!!! Your time, money, energy, and life will be consumed by it! But if you do take the plunge, make sure you get the proper release tools."
3691842,lassh,2015-03-25 17:04:00,553,"Been through the process during the last couple years...Its expensive but when you succeed its a huge adrenaline rush. You are near at great area on LOW to do some early October fishing. Just fish the rocks, and shoals to see who's home then run out to the drop offs or deep humps for some walleye. A lot of guys troll for muskie at that time but I'm not really into that (yet). A mixed trip for walleyes and bass with several windows focused on muskies makes the time fly. Get yourself an 8 or 9 foot muskie rod and an Ambassadeur Record reel (unless you want to spend the cash on a Diawa). Unfortunately I have recently been bitten by the Musky on the fly bug. Its been tempered temporarily as I am planning my first trip to Detroit River in April. Good luck on your fall trip."
