3673602,Crede,2015-03-20 17:43:00,134,"Yes. The people at the Lodge refer to that water as the ""back lake"". It is about a 5 minute walk from the lodge to that dock over a decent trail. The dock is primarily used when Makokibatan is rough due to a strong west wind. The staff is willing to take some boats around to that dock so that guests who don't want to boat in the big waves can still fish. In May 1997 our plane landed us there and we walked in to the lodge due to ice still coming down the main lake. Little Makok is really a series of 3 smaller lakes. In my experience, it is primarily fished for pike. The only places where I have had decent walleye fishing on it are right where the water from Hebner comes into the western end and at the narrowing at the eastern end where it empties into Makokibatan (and only May - June). The access to Makokibatan is reliable but rocky - depending on water levels. We always go thru slowly with the motor trimmed up. Some years require going thru at a crawl with someone up front spotting. Multiple boats go thru there every day. I have been to Makokibatan 12 times over the years. Trip #13 starts in 71 days."

3673866,adempsey,2015-03-20 18:50:00,963,Thanks. You must have some great stories from that place. Looks like a great lodge and fishery.
3676330,EddieNorth,2015-03-21 17:41:00,32,"I use to hunt the lake through nakina air service when they had it,we caught lots and lots of walleyes.The rapids were good and some of the back bays.Great hunting their too."
3671362,Weby13,2015-03-20 06:54:00,57,My buudy told me that Eddie north acquired Hebner Lake from AWO and Little Makok lake outpost. Both are part of the Albany River. Has anybody else heard this? I've seen hebner on AWO's website but cant' seem to find any info on who owns Little Makok. If its true it looks like it will be a great addition to a great outfitter and I just have to figure out a way to clone a bunch of Eddies to put at each camp!
3671546,Mike Borger,2015-03-20 07:37:00,1554,"Yes he has acquired both of those camps to go along with Richter, Windsor and Blackbirch. Little Makok is interesting, don't think it's been fished much.Will be fishing Blackbirch in September this year."
3671570,Draco1206,2015-03-20 07:39:00,175,Yeah my son told me this about a week ago. It was posted on Mike Borger's Facebook. We're hoping he can acquire Washi Lake some day also. Although we loved Eddie and his camp at Beteau we prefer to be by ourselves at our outpost camps. We don't need a chaperon/guide.
3672018,adempsey,2015-03-20 08:59:00,963,Where is Little Makok? Is it the lake between Makok and Hebner?side note:Anyone know what this is on nearby Abazotikichuan Lake? Nets?https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Mim...d4a4f143aa7492
3672122,vteye,2015-03-20 09:18:00,812,We flew into Hebner May 2013 picking up another group. They did well on nice pike said they caught 4 or 5 over 40 during the week. They were not happy with size of walleyes which ran smaller than they expected. It was a difficult week with a huge cold front.
3672234,Mike Borger,2015-03-20 09:56:00,1554,Yes it's the lake between Makokibaten and Hebner. Decent sized lake over 10km's long with direct access to Makokibaten and the Albany River.
3672250,dog2,2015-03-20 10:02:00,198,"It is the lake on the south side of Makokabatan.It connect's to Hebner Via the river on the west end of little Makok,it is not navigable between Hebner and Little Makok, shallow water rapids!AWO owned both camps Little Makok was used primarly as a moose hunting camp the last several years.My understanding is Eddie is planning to upgrade LIttle Makok,at this time it is a primative camp(meaning roof, beds, table type stove.) The Albany river is accessable to the north east aprox 1 1/2 mile away. Hebner is a shallow lake, deepest place we found was 35ft in front of the cabin. Pike in almost every weed patch;Walleye's on points and in current areas lower Hebner is box shaped 10/15 ft smaller pike,walleyes at outlet andin the connecting waters.There is a portage to another lake o n the south shore on lower Hebner there is a boat there ;but the portage needed to be recut due to numerous trees down and brush.On Upper Hebner is another portage to the long string bean lake,there is a canoe there. The walleye avg was 20"" pike 24+. We caught several over 40 inchs. Hebner trip was in 2014 in late July! I hope this helps answer some questions on location and fishing. From the scarce info on Little Mako I have found this info to share; walleye and pike in the this river /lake system tend to run a little larger with brook trout in the Albany this info is from an old brouchre from Nakina air Service.(1995)"
3672458,adempsey,2015-03-20 11:01:00,963,Any idea if the guests from Makok lodge fish it? I noticed a dock on Little Makok south of the lodge.
3672626,Mike Borger,2015-03-20 11:30:00,1554,Good question.
3673322,Weby13,2015-03-20 15:56:00,57,Thanks for the info! Looks like some great water to fish!
