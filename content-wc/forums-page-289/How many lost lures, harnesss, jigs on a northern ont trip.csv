3682914,Freytown,2015-03-23 15:21:00,770,"Remember you are not alone, so plan as a group as far as the lures go...we always did. One boat, one tackle box. And as has been said, the lures depend on the fish your after."
3678970,Aspencreek,2015-03-22 15:54:00,2911,"I think back to when I was doing fly-ins and I always packed to much clothes. And it was HEAVY. But now with the synthetic fabrics, jeans and cotton T-shirts are something I wouldn't even pack, well maybe 1 pair of jeans. But now that I drive to our camp my clothes list is still way less than what it used to be. TIP: the new synthetic clothes can be washed while you are taking your shower or in the sink. Just throw them on the floor of the shower and soap up, rinse and hang, the clothes will dry overnight and you stay fresh as a daisy. Do not forget your GOOD rainsuit, (you do have a good one, right?) it can also double as a jacket for colder nights or days, and teamed with a polar fleece you are good to go.As said before don't skimp on the jigs, plastic, and spinner rigs, just a couple of spoons are enough and the lures I left at home. Salted minnows and worms are the way to go, like was stated before, THEY MUST BE KEPT COOL, or they are gone, Keep them in a styro cooler with ice packs."
3679146,youngknight,2015-03-22 16:35:00,228,"Went on my first fly in last year but only for 5 days and ended up only fishing maybe half the time..weather was just terrible...I don't mind fishing in a light rain and did on a number of occasions...however, blowing pouring rain, thunder and lightening...worst week of weather outfitter saw in years...so I didn't get a real appreciation of how many lures, jigs, worms we would use. I was happy to have enough extra clothes along...had a fire in July most nights to warm up and dry off and even then, some clothes never did get try..sun on the very last day, and even then not very warm. Have Viking raingear and really like it but sitting in the blowing rain...even it gets soaked through."
3679274,roscoe33,2015-03-22 17:12:00,653,"Don't skimp on essentials, boots, rain gear, knife, jaw spreader. These all get packed before any alcohol. If you can't go a day or two without booze, well.. If you are really close on weight, you can put 100 jigs in your pocket. As far a crawlers, you can transport them with very little bedding, then take a small bag of dry bedding mix to put them in at camp. And keep all pills, over the counter or prescription, in their original labeled containers, not in a baggie, or in your pocket. Or take your chances at the border."
3679306,Blades-n-Beads,2015-03-22 17:18:00,484,"Youngknight, great advise has already been given, cut back on your clothing but cover warm/cold clothes, you can wash what you must just don't bring doubles of everything. Don't short cut yourself on tackle, for 3 days fishing 12 hrs a day I will have with me , 3 dozen crawler harnesses, 3 doz jigs, one doz deep divers of assorted depth range, doz bottom bouncers, and misc spoons, bucktails. For 3 guys 3 full days fishing 1/2 flat of crawlers. Along with some salted shiners. When your all done packing and have some extra room toss in what you tossed out."
3679418,kzoofisher,2015-03-22 17:40:00,5144,"The OP didn't say he drinks so this isn't pointed at him, but one beer is 48 1/4oz jigs, call it 44 if you use really heavy hooks. With a small adjustment on beverages you could take more jigs than you will use in a season. To answer the OP's question, I would load up on whatever your favorite style of bait is and go with that. How much do 50 cranks weigh? Or harnesses? The weight is going to be in bottom bouncers or inlines and even that won't amount to more than a couple pounds. Pick out your assortment and weigh it. Take out the dozen 1 1/2 oz jigs you've been carrying since that one time you fished Lakers in 100' and weigh it again. Now pair down your clothes. You need two pair of underwear, one you will wear on the way there and wash on Monday night and the other you will wear Monday night to Thursday. You need one pair of shoes that are waterproof and no others. Depending on what month you go you need one pair long johns, one pair pants, one pair shorts, two short and one long sleeve shirts to layer and high quality head to toe rain gear that acts as a top layer of insulation/wind breaker. If you are going in July dump the long johns and bring another pair of shorts. Along with the clothes you have on when you leave home this will cover you for a week. A sleeping bag and an inflatable pillow if you don't trust the camp pillows. Weigh all that and make up the difference in food. This isn't a fashion show, it's a fly in fishing trip."
3679586,TheDFP,2015-03-22 18:19:00,39,"Another option, if available. Take everything you want to make your trip/vacation enjoyable and comfortable. Pay extra $$ for the weight overage or see if they can fly in stuff on a check-in. I take almost my whole tackle box. I don't want somebody tell me about a hot lure I have sitting at home. As others have said, good rain gear is not something to cut back on!"
3679650,P&y only,2015-03-22 18:31:00,133,4 dozen crawlers?? Is that for the first day?
3680186,Live to jig,2015-03-22 20:37:00,159,"Very simple 6 bottom bouncers from 1 -2 oz, 20 assorted harnesses, a good assortment of Tungsten jigs and some 3"" tails, couple slip bobber sets and 3 or 4 Erie Dearies. If there is a newbie along I will take some extra if I like him haha, other than that I'm good.Now if you were to ask what I have bought over the years to take....that's a different store."
3682210,MrSimon,2015-03-23 12:19:00,922,"Ahhhh ... the age old question of how much tackle to take on a fly-in. Too much is bad and too little is bad. You have to find what is juuuuust right. For me, it's one medium sized Plano box and a Tupperware container full of soft plastics. Together it weights about 10 pounds and fits nicely into a backpack. My kit includes bottom bouncers, crawler harnesses, stick baits, swim baits, spinners, spoons, shad style crankbaits, rattle traps, drop shot stuff, extra hooks, swivels, topwater, various jigs, leaders, and some various other items. It's literally taken years to refine my tackle selection, but I'm very pleased with where I'm at now and have always had what I need and just a little bit more."
3682306,SSH,2015-03-23 12:47:00,526,"It depends on the lakes as to how much tackle you can expect to loose. I fish a drive to lake that is a reservoir similar to Lac Seul that has lots of sunken timber. In five days of almost bottom bouncer fishing I could go though 40-50 harnesses and a couple of weights. As we have become more familiar with areas to fish, we have switched to almost exclusive jig fishing. Probably go through 30 - 40 jigs per person. I've never really counted them, so it may be a few more. Buy my jigs at Cabelas in the spring by packs of 25 for about $5. We do troll cranks occasionally, so we use a lure retriever to save as many as possible. We bring salted minnows pretty much exclusively with occasionally buying leeches in Canada by the pound when a little bobber fishing fits the environment."
3677898,youngknight,2015-03-22 09:52:00,228,"Hi guys, I know there are many variables - lake substrate, hours fishing, depth of lake, fishing technique...etc, but for a typical northern Ontario walleye trip (some pike), how many crankbaits, crawling harnesses, and jigs do you typically lose...I suspect mainly to snags. Not really sure how much to pack..don't want to take too few for obvious reasons, at the same time with weight restrictions don't want to overdo it either. Along the same lines, how many worms and plastics for jig heads) do you typically bring? I figured 4 crawling harnesses, 2 dozen jig heads, half a dozen crankbaits, same amount of spoons and spinners for pike, and 3 dozen plastics. Probably 4 dozen worms. 7 day trip."
3678018,SinOrSwim,2015-03-22 10:12:00,1528,"I would over do it on that stuff and find areas to save weight somewhere else. Last thing you want to do is run out of stuff that directly impacts what you are there to do. Fish. Same thing goes with booze. Take more than you think. Can't run down to the liquor store for an extra bottle. Take one fewer pair of boots. Put all toiletries in small packages. Like, don't take a bottle of advil. Take 10 or 20 tablets in a plastic baggie. small toothpaste etc. All that stuff adds up. I have run out of beer and run out of minnows on a fly-in. Granted a jig head is a jig head but if yellow with a red eye is working way better than plain yellow, you will be upset if you run out of yellow with a red eye."
3678306,adempsey,2015-03-22 12:03:00,963,"We've never really lost that many lures or jigs on most trips. There were a couple of lakes that had a lot of sunken timber where we lost maybe a dozen or so jig heads.Your numbers are reasonable, but I'd up the number of jig heads to 3 or 4 dozen and harnesses to a dozen or two to be safe. Ultimately it depends on what you're fishing for and how you like to fish. For example, if you're a die hard troller, then maybe take more lures or harnesses and fewer jigs. Adding some new techniques is also great, because let's face it, when you're on these types of trips almost everything works. So, for walleye, I'd also bring some slip-weights for Lindy rigging and some Slow-Death type rigs. Also, for worms, do you mean live bait or plastic? Four dozen live worms seems very low, but it would depend on how you plan to fish.These are my thoughts on packing fishing tackle: http://lineonfishing.com/index.php/a...#Fishingtackle"
3678322,packpro,2015-03-22 12:09:00,695,"Lots of factors here. Just a few general suggestions. When using mono I lost twice as much gear. When I switched to 15 lb braid I lost less. Kept track of jigs one year. With the braid I only used eight all week. The braid will let you work out of snags, and you will have less pike ""bite offs"". We also like swim baits. It catches all species, walleye, pike, and smallies on our lake. We can get through a whole week with 2-3. We also try to select cranks and minnow hard baits that are flexible for all species. That way you only need a few. Wire leaders will save you a few reties as well. In our group, in Canada, all colors of jigs seem to work, but everyone has one they have more confidence in. The guide in our camp uses unpainted jigs. When we portage everyone takes whatever they can fit into a sandwich bag. I would start there and then add a few fun items."
3678426,Manitou,2015-03-22 12:43:00,125,You will be glad to have a lure retriever the first time you get that $10 crankbait unstuck.
3678442,Walleye_Guru,2015-03-22 12:46:00,62,"In all reality, you can leave the cranks and spoons at home. Or if trophy pike is an option, you can bring some lindy rigs, xraps and spoons, but if you're just after walleyes, a jig will work an obscene amount of time. Given your weight and size restrictions, I'd get 2 or 3 Plano deep storage boxes and throw them in a back pack (http://planomolding.com/index.php/fishing/2373005.html). 3 would be more than enough for a season's worth of fishing, much less a week. I guide all summer long in Ontario. I have one box that I use for each trip. If I run low on a particular item (say swivels or a certain color jig) I simply top it up from my stock supply once I'm back to the lodge after a day of fishing. I like backpacks because they're super portable and you can fit those other necessities in it  rope, drift sock, needle nose pliers, side cutters, 1st aid kit, flash light, extra fishing line, bug spray, camera, fillet knife, matches or lighter, utility knife, clippers, empty anchor bag, towel, toilet paper, whistle, stringer and shore lunch stuff. I use a carbineer to clip on a life jacket to the outside when I'm not wearing it. I also clip on my water bottle for the day. If you're fishing dark stained water, make sure you keep your presentations on the bright side  white, orange and all the fluorescents. I tend to lean toward jigs of orange and yellow on our darker lakes and have tremendous luck with that one simple lure. Thinking of line  I recommend an 8- 10lbs braid. I tie on a fluorocarbon leaders with a blood knot and tie jigs direct using a uni knot. The set up will double for pike if you use finesse and a beefier fluor leader, but it'll take some practice. Remember the saying, 90% of fish are in 10% of the water. In Canada, 90% of the fish can be caught with less than 10% of lures. Jigs for your situation are the go to. Good Luck and let us know what you decide to bring and how it all worked out."
3678458,youngknight,2015-03-22 12:49:00,228,"Thanks guys. Adempsey, good info on your link. Why would you suggest 1-2 dozen crawler harnesses...I agree you don't want to be caught short on a fly in trip, but do they get damaged, wound up and kinked? bite offs"" snags?? I did mean live worms...I will up the amount. I see the link refers to a ""flat"" of worms. Sorry, but I have only bought worms in containers holding dozen or two...how many in a flat? NOt sure where to buy such a thing. I live in Ontario so maybe this is an American thing? Thx"
3678530,adempsey,2015-03-22 13:04:00,963,"If you do a lot of trolling with harnesses, as many do, it's a good idea to have plenty on hand due to bite offs and damage. You will catch Northern Pike on them and, if they don't bite it off, they can do some serious damage as they flop around in the boat. Of course, for damaged harnesses you could simply re-tie them using new line. They weigh next to nothing as well. On the other hand, if you just want to troll occasionally, a half dozen may be just fine.As for the worms, a flat is 500 worms. It's a common measure in the industry. That would be for four guys fishing with worms all the time. Again, how many will depend on how you intend to fish."
3678666,JayM5209,2015-03-22 13:59:00,1050,"youngknight, my group hasn't bought minnows in many years. We take one flat of crawlers for a 5 or 6 person group. In addition to the plastics and hard baits we use, a flat is usually sufficient.A caution for you . . . . plan ahead of time as to how you will keep the crawlers cool. It's fairly easy to keep a flat alive through a seven day trip, but you have to be intentional about it every day. Nothing can kill off a flat of crawlers quicker than getting too warm. - put one person in charge of the crawlers - make sure they're checked every day (and ice added, if you have ice) - when you get to the outpost, repeat the rule for everyone to hear: NO CRAWLER THAT LEAVES THE WORM STORAGE BOX AND SPENDS THE DAY IN A BOAT CONTAINER EVER GOES BACK INTO THE STORAGE BOX BACK AT CAMP . . . NEVER!!"
3678746,pjshorthorn,2015-03-22 14:17:00,5654,Thanks for sharing your article. It is a great piece on planning for any type of trip to Canada or points beyond. I appreciate the time and effort that you put into it. PjShorthorn.
