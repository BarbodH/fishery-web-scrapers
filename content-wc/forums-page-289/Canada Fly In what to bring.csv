3687242,Draco1206,2015-03-24 14:55:00,175,Absolutely agree on the baby wipes. Greatest invention ever for outpost camps. Good raingear is a must unless you plan on staying in the cabin during some good fishing weather.
3687266,packpro,2015-03-24 14:58:00,695,Here is our list. Good starting point. This is just a suggestion for our specific camp. You can add/edit as necessary for your trip.
3687626,adempsey,2015-03-24 16:56:00,963,"Hidden Bay has a list on their site.This article may be helpful as well.I'd suggest reading up a bit on fishing rivers, current and rapids for Walleye. Gage Lake looks like it's basically a widening of the Cat River, which should make for some awesome fishing."
