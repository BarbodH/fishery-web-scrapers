3670186,Walleye_Guru,2015-03-19 19:41:00,62,"You'd be surprised how many guys will learn how to clean fish if their dinner depends on it. In our case, I usually do it, but don't mind. We aren't a big group though. Cleaning fish for double digits doesn't sound fun at all If people aren't good at it, practice makes perfect! Big groups need to rotate duties unless someone enjoys the particular job - cleaning, cooking, packing. I've seen groups do it both ways with success. It really boils down to the group dynamics. Each party is different and should do whatever makes things gel the best. Probably the best advise is choice your group wisely and you won't have issues."
3671986,Bakefish,2015-03-20 08:52:00,1077,So you're a fluffer?
3672562,davenathe,2015-03-20 11:20:00,113,"Right now. No one likes the free loader. All our bodies ache at the end of the day, that is what happens when get old."
3675522,LundDriver,2015-03-21 12:22:00,30,"My wife does. We have been fishing together for 20 years. We rarely do shore lunch. We come in around 6pm for dinner. My wife goes to the fish house while I put the boat to bed. Then I head to the cabin, cut potatoes, onions etc. Make us a drink and have everything ready when she bring back the fish. I cook. When dinner is done my wife usually curls up on the couch with a glass of wine and a book while I go down to the dock with a couple of AK IPA's to see if anything is biting off the end of the dock. Repeat the same thing next day for two weeks. 145 days to go till LOTW!!!!!!!"
3676290,Baseline,2015-03-21 17:12:00,3207,"I figure you catch em your boat cleans them. Face it fish cleaning isn't that difficult. I found it was more of a lack of effort for the guys who said they sucked at it. We have a group of 6 guys who take a trip every year. On fish keeping days we form an assembly line. I bought a rechargeable knife a few years ago. I can fillet a bunch of fish in minutes. The rest of the guys take care of skinning, washing the fish and cleaning up. We are done in minutes. Then we split in two groups for cooking and cleaning crews. Observation: Ever wonder why the same guys that can't do certain work duties aren't very good at about anything."
3676370,bigtimeelectric,2015-03-21 17:56:00,174,We pack a cooler with our favorite spirits and mix and leave down by fish cleaning house. Once we get in we usually mix a few and bs while cleaning fish. It is amazing how good a crown 7 tastes after a .long day on the water!!!!!!!!!
3681986,Timing,2015-03-23 11:35:00,95,Right on!!
3659226,bigwalleye1,2015-03-17 09:52:00,2632,"I clean all the fish because I DON'T LIKE BONES. Also, by cleaning and packaging, I keep count. Don't ask me why, but suffice to say I did not pay the ticket when we were all counting our own. Apparently the disntinction between ""conservation"" and ""Sportsman"" and ""2 vs 4"" got lost on somebody. Additionally, I'd rather not bring home dinks at 12"" to say I caught a limit. I'd rather go home short of fish than short on size. (hasn't happened yet) We don't keep any ""overs"", so I want to maximize the 4 ea we get in my boat."
3659634,retire55,2015-03-17 11:14:00,1029,"For at the last 15 years, our trip participants have usually numbered either 4 or 6 guys on walleye trips. After I was taught how to clean walleye with an electric filleting knife, I volunteered to clean all our harvested walleye. Since we always fish in Quebec, the skin is always left on for take home walleye."
3659874,Bill Krejca,2015-03-17 12:29:00,6107,"Our groups clean their own fish, usually several clean while others help with the cooking. Guys who want to take pike home are tested as to their determination to do so by getting to clean the pike themselves. We seldom have any pike going home. Bill"
3660906,South Dakota,2015-03-17 16:30:00,24,"Hey with regards to the northern sliming your cooler in the boat, we have been placing the northern in a separate kitchen garbage bag in the cooler away from the walleye. Works great and makes cleaning the cooler much easier!"
3661082,Aspencreek,2015-03-17 17:45:00,2911,"Our group is usually 6 guys, 3 do all the fish cleaning, the rookie is NEVER allowed to clean, he is the beer maiden, and the other 2 (Me +1) do the cooking. My son, who would rather clean fish than do ANYTHING else has gotten so good with a battery operated filet knife that he can do double the other guys. Plus Blair at Onaway showed him how to do a Northern the right way, and those have become a real hit on the menu. Only he does those slimey buggers. That garbage bag idea is one I am going to employ.As far as take home fish, we will only keep walleye between 16-18"", even if it means we go home shy, and we don't fish for take home fish until weds-thurs. we don't eat fish every night so there are some days when there is nothing to clean early in the week. With the size of your group you need more guys with knives and less with bottles standing around giving advise. Just sayin."
3661346,Blades-n-Beads,2015-03-17 18:49:00,484,"In regards to South Dakota reply, X2 with the separate bag for Pike. I like to use a XL heavy duty zip lock bag with a handle on it, you can get a 4 pack from Walmart or Amaozon. They work excellent and hold up very well, easy clean up and are see through."
3665642,Aspencreek,2015-03-18 20:43:00,2911,Those are now on the shopping list......right after BAIT.
3668482,davenathe,2015-03-19 13:18:00,113,"Same as most groups, out of 6 guys 2 get started on fish right away. I take lead on planning meal and 1-2 help with prep as needed. I like meal prep so can get started on drinking beer sooner. Now that think of it what the **** on the other 1-2 doing...lol"
3669154,jambi,2015-03-19 15:29:00,504,I wish I was cleaning a walleye while drinking a cold beer NOW
3669610,alberta bum,2015-03-19 16:55:00,312,"Heck,,, you intrested in a July trip??? I'll trade the ole lady in for you!"
3656106,packpro,2015-03-16 14:53:00,695,"For a large group you need at least three guys. We have one guy who works like a surgeon. He does the take home fish. A couple of other hacks filet up the shore lunch. Even if you have never cleaned fish, Canada is the place to learn. Lot of practice for the week. Our rookies get assigned to either skinning or taking out the ribs. Small steps before turning them loose on the fish. Again mis cuts can usually be saved for a shore lunch fish."
3656122,SinOrSwim,2015-03-16 14:58:00,1528,"Do, those work well?"
3656298,Draco1206,2015-03-16 15:55:00,175,"Our group is pretty much the same as most of the others here. We have a few guys that pretty much do most of the fish cleaning. We get a little assembly line going. As far as if the skinzit works or not, I watched the videos on it and it looked like a pretty neat tool but it only does the easiest part of the cleaning process. It only takes the skin off, you still have to fillet the fish out by hand. I can guarantee you that most experienced fish cleaners can do it much faster by hand than with the skinzit. What does it take to skin a fillet, maybe two or three seconds? With the skinzit you have to align the fillet correctly and it takes just as long to take the skin off, and then you still have to clean the machine thoroughly after you use it. But it is a pretty neat gadget if you're looking to get the perfect gift for the fisherman that has everything, or you want to add a little more weight to your fly-in."
3656314,fishinnut 3446,2015-03-16 16:01:00,638,"They work but you just have to get use to it, works well for the rib bones."
3657466,mudpusher,2015-03-16 20:17:00,248,"X2 ... I've been cleaning the fish for twenty years. What Knife are you using, electric or manual ?"
3657482,port1042,2015-03-16 20:20:00,509,"Our lodge cleans the fish for us. And they really do a great job. Our boat is met at the dock and the only question is ""do you want to freeze them or eat them?"". Either way they are beautifully filleted and delivered either to the cabin or the freezer. I don't mind cleaning fish, and my fishing partner is really good at it. But this is even better! The dock hands get, and deserve, a nice tip."
3657522,pjshorthorn,2015-03-16 20:29:00,5654,"I'm a little old school so I still use a trusty Rapala knife from the day. My grandfather gave me one and said, "" Here, figure it out "". I got a lot of practice on my first trip as a teenager. Those electric knives scare me. PjShorthorn."
3657578,michigan walleye guy,2015-03-16 20:38:00,95,"I have the privilege of being both the designated cook and the fish filet guy. I love both jobs! I'm one of those people with several different filet knives, and I love using my old standby Rapala knife as well as my real gem, a 9"" filet knife from Wolverine Knife Works up here near Rapid River, Michigan. That being said, I'm more than happy to do both the filet work and the cooking, and leaving the dishes, cleaning, etc., to the other guys. We all just kind of know our jobs without saying a word--one of the perks of going with pretty much the same group of guys year after year."
3657994,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2015-03-17 04:41:00,5533,"The cleaners cook? There is your first problem. When we go the cleaners don't cook and the cooks don't do dishes. I'm with you. If they are taking fish home, I'd leave that to them to clean."
3659090,Mike Kansas,2015-03-17 09:16:00,1463,"I do it all on our June trip. Clean fish, cook meals, do dishes, clean floor, clean out and gas boats, sort minnows, retie all jigs and lures and fluff beds. The other guys just drink and play poker and yell at me when their glass isn't full or they need more snacks. I hope one of them reads this because if they do you will see different opinions. Mike Kansas"
3655346,SinOrSwim,2015-03-16 12:30:00,1528,"Do groups have a few people that clean most of the fish or is it a trade off all the time? We have always only had a couple people that clean fish. Some don't know how and some just aren't that great at it. We always flew in and and conservation licenses and didn't take fish home. So, no big deal. Now, we drive and people get regular licenses and all want to take fish home. Well, with a group of 10 to 14 guys, that is A LOT of extra fish to clean. adds a lot of time which hten makes dinner later and later. Thought about even telling people if they want to take home fish, they are responsible for cleaning them??? Plus, I HATE cleaning Northern. The slime makes me almost vomit. I'm not sure I will even clean someones walleye this year if it has been in a cooler with northern. Making me gag thinking about it now. Curious what systems others use and how they handle stuff like that."
3655378,camp chef,2015-03-16 12:54:00,915,"I clean all the fish for our fish dinners,( Usually 2 or 3 for the week) because I am the best at it and they are cleaned the way I want them. We don't take any fish home so it is not an issue. If anyone in our group would want to take fish home it would be expected that they would clean and package their own."
3655474,pjshorthorn,2015-03-16 13:09:00,5654,"Over time our group settled into their specialty for the trip. It may be cooking,cleaning dishes,cabin cleaning,boat prep,firewood or cleaning fish. I cleaned the fish for our group( 6+ members) every year regardless of whether it was dinner or take home. Worked for us. PjShorthorn."
3655578,SinOrSwim,2015-03-16 13:20:00,1528,"We sort of did the same thing. But, the group has grown to 10 to 14 guys. Big difference cleaning fish for 6 guys to eat only and 14 to eat and take home. There are nights now we don't eat dinner until 8 or 9 pm. We don't really mind doing it, but the time it takes is getting a little out of hand."
3655602,forgop,2015-03-16 13:28:00,880,"In my trips, I've always been the guy that goes in and does most of the cooking for everything other than the fish. The other guys are cleaning and I'm busy working on the potatoes or whatever else we've got in the works. Fewer bugs that way."
3655610,Pikeslayer8,2015-03-16 13:29:00,1460,"Yup, same here, when we roll in we assign 2 or 3 guys on the filleting, 1 guy as bartender and the rest cranking out dinner and gassing up boats. The system works well and we have all done the menu enough that we can have most dinners ready about the time the filleting is done and keepers are packaged. When planning for a fish fry, we plan on 1 1/2 walleye per man. Nice thread Sin."
3655626,swank,2015-03-16 13:30:00,44,"Our group is a group of 15. We all have our own jobs, cooking, bait, boat ect. There are two of us that clean all the fish for shore lunch and take home. My brother and I are the fastest and do a good job at it so it has been our job for years."
3655666,MrSimon,2015-03-16 13:40:00,922,"We have a group of five. Usually two guys do the cleaning, two guys do the in-side prep, and the last guy handles odd chores like firewood, filling water jugs etc. We always do our fish cleaning in the middle of the day. Always!!! Less bugs, plenty of light, and you aren't dead tired with a bunch of hungry guys waiting on you. If you want to take fish home, you have to clean them .......... except for the one guy who refuses to clean fish - but is highly entertaining so I clean them for him."
3655850,Blades-n-Beads,2015-03-16 14:14:00,484,"Pretty much the same here as others have said, I don't mind doing the fish with my buddy we have a pretty good system together besides I hait bones in my meal. If I missed one no one to blame but myself. Funny thing when you have the same group how each one falls into his place in the chore department. But then again there's always one who just can't seem to find his nitch, that one will be designated bar maid for sure for the duration. For the guys that do want a fish for take home I always have my vaccuum sealer along and will seal them up for who ever."
