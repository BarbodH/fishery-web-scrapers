3677722,JIGSTER,2015-03-22 09:23:00,30,We are going to be staying in the ear falls area the last week july. I have been to the area a couple dozen times but have always wanted to see it from the air. I would like to consider a day flyins with my teenage son for an all new Canadian experience. Looking for recommendations from this area so I can start doing some calling and researching. Thanks for any advice!

Then a few guys went back on a third trip. Wilderness does a great job. Often they can pick you up on your lake or a near by lake ( check with them). Our pilot did a great job helping turn the boat over and making sure we were fishing before leaving. Highly recommended. They Have number of remote lakes in the area."

3682378,Old Timer,2015-03-23 13:22:00,255,"You'll like the fly-in. Years ago my daughter and I stayed in a cabin on Lake of the Woods for three days. We didn't fish there, but rather flew out for two day trips to different lakes. We had great fishing and two days were plenty for her. Back then, the whole trip was no more than a fly-in outpost at a distant location.Just make sure to tell your flight service you want plenty of action on an easy-to-fish lake. You don't want to spend your six hours searching for fish."

3683466,P&y only,2015-03-23 17:31:00,133,Brommie? If that's the same lake I fished it's a small world. Just big enough to land a plane on? I fished it out of birchdale lodge on eagle when Ernie owned it. That lake was ridiculously loaded with big walleyes.
3692330,JIGSTER,2015-03-25 19:03:00,30,Thanks for the replies and suggestions! I will probably stick something in the immediate ear falls area. I will start contacting some soon. Any more recommendations on an outfit from that area?
