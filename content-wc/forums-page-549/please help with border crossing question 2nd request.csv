1163394,VernH,2010-01-26 09:01:00,1077,"I've had a Remote Area Border Crossing (RABC or Canpass) for almost 15 years now. That allows me to cross the MN/Ontario border INTO Ontario. To get back as of late, I need to show passport or passport card. So no, you don't need a passport to leave the country but you need one or the pasport card to get back in. Since you said you don't need any info on getting back in, I assume you already knew that.The past few years enforcement coming back as been a bit relaxed cuz they were behind on issuing passports. That is no longer the case.If you are really bored and want to really be informed, you can read the stuff below. Some of it may or may not apply.You may say that you really don't need all the stuff. Many have been ""pinched"" along the MN/Ontario border for the stuff listed below. I think only tha stuff about the radios hasn't been enforced.....when in Canadian waters I only use my radio for weather reports.....Vernhttp://boating.ncf.ca/equipment.html#p6http://boating.ncf.ca/laws.htmlHere's some more info, Note the stuff in red:U.S. Visitors: Canada's border rules have not changed, although American publications continue to print false information about ""Canadian Customs"". But in June 2009, you will need a passport, NEXUS card (below), or FAST card to enter or return to the U.S. from a Canadian port. (U.S. citizens can fish or drop anchor in Canadian waters without being considered to have left the U.S.) You must report to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) immediately upon returning to the U.S.A. Everyone on board must have either a NEXIS card or a Boat Landing Permit. If you don't check in, you may get fines and/or imprisonment. Check with the CBP in Department of Homeland Security for the latest information. The Canadian Coast Guard's Office of Boating Safety [Government directory] lists ""Requirements for Foreign Recreational Vessels in Canadian Waters"". Visting boaters staying in Canadian waters less than 45 days are exempt from most regulations for safety equipment if their boat is legally fitted and licenced in their home state. Visitors must follow most other Canadian boating regulations wuch as speed limits, toilet and discharge regulations, age and power restrictions, drinking and driving laws, VHF radio station licence, marine radio operator licence. Pleasure Craft Operator Card (PCOC): Starting September 15, 2009, boat operators require proof of competency to operate a boat in Canada (younger operators and operators of small boats already require it), including visitors (non-residents) staying more than 45 days or who operate a Canadian licenced or registered boat (includes most cottage boats). You are exempt if you and your boat are in Canada less than 45 days, but you must carry proof of residence. Proof of competency can be one of these three: Pleasure Craft Operator Card (PCOC), a renter's document (see below), or an ""operator card"" that meets the requirements of their home state or country. The PCOC is recognized in both Canada and the U.S. and can be aquired from a Transport Canada authorized business. You can study and get a PCOC online from BOATEREXAM.COM. (about the company) Download their study guide for free. They've been helping boaters get their PCOC online since mid-2000! Renting a boat: People renting a boat will need to get a ""Rental Boating Safety Checklist"" before heading out. They do not need to acquire the PCOC, operator's certiciate (a dockside session is required instead). However, you must have a valid radio operator licence to transmit on a VHF radio outside the U.S. (listening does not require a licence). NEXUS card: a joint program between the Canada Border Services Agency and U.S Customs and Border Protection, for frequent, low-risk travel between Canada and the U.S. by land, sea and air. Boaters can call a Telephone Reporting Centre (TRC) 30 minutes to 4 hours prior to arrival. Everyone in the boat must be a NEXUS member, otherwise regular reporting procedures must be followed. A NEXUS card will likely replace the I-68 and CANPASS programs, and can be used instead of a passport when entering the U.S. by land or water (but not by air). [Government directory: NEXUS] CANPASS is a telephone reporting system for recreational boaters entering Canada from the U.S. was reinstated by the Canadian Border Services Agency. Check for latest changes. [Government directory: Border Control]I-68 & OARS: The U.S. also has special border programs for boaters: ""Canadian Border Boat Landing Program"" (I-68 form) and the ""Outlying Area Reporting Stations"" (OARS). Forms are valid for one year and everyone on board must have one. It is convenient for boaters who travel across border waters for a day or two.The above info is from (http://boating.ncf.ca/canadaborder.html) Wanna use your marine radio in Canada? read this:Foreign visitors: To legally transmit using VHF radios on a foreign boat in Canada require a valid Ship Station Licence (2003: $150 for 10 yrs) and operator's licence from your home country. Transmitting around the Canada/U.S. border is usually ignored, but make sure you follow proper radio procedures. http://boating.ncf.ca/canadaborder.html#fccA foreign boater who wish to legally tranmit using their VHF radio in Canada requires a valid ship's licence plus an operator licence.

U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Canadian government have recently created exemptions for VHF marine radio licences for radios used in home waters, there are international treaties governing radio usage outside home borders that boaters must still abide by.The U.S. FCC processes applications for VHF radios for boaters in American licenced or registered boats travelling to Canada. Phone the the FCC toll-free at 1-888-CALLFCC for current information.All radio operators must have a Restricted Radiotelephone Operator's permit, Form 753 ($45Cdn in 1998) to actually transmit on a VHF radio in Canada.

1163596,scar,2010-01-26 18:58:00,196,thanks everyone for your help. the passport card is my answer.
1166684,JinxCanada,2010-02-06 14:42:00,1306,"actually if you want the technically correct answer for entering Canada...the answer is you do not need any identification at all (written in IRPA) however, you WILL need id crossing back into the USA. the way the law is written here is that if you can satisfy an officer of your citizenship and you are either a US Citizen or Permanent resident of the USA while crossing into Canada a verbal declaration is sufficient. but....the best way to satisfy an CBSA officer is by way of a passport. just saying you don't actually have to by law have anything at all."
1167454,Guest,2010-02-09 11:49:00,0,Would a photo copy of your passport work to enter and to return or do you have to have the original passport with you when coming back? Always wondered what would happen if I lost mine but happened to have a copy of it with me just in case. Anyone have any knowledge to this question???
1168433,Steve of Madison,2010-02-12 15:02:00,230,"A photocopy of your passport is not the same thing.You can get a replacement passport if you lost it but it will cost you. Here's a tip, don't lose it, put it in a secure place everytime. Sorry to sound like your mother here, but being responsible is your job."
1173497,JinxCanada,2010-03-01 22:07:00,1306,"like i said..to enter Canada if you are an American citizen or a permanent resident of the USA when entering from the USA you do not require any identification at all...as far as the law is written, however, it is the officer's discretion on if they believe you are who you say you are....and they only way to PROVE it is with correct I.D. i hope that helps."
1163245,scar,2010-01-25 18:22:00,196,Can someone tell me if I can cross the border going into Canada from minnesota without a passport. I thought I had heard that a special kind of drivers license or another type of document can be used? I do not need any info about what is needed to cross back into the U.S.
1163264,prov1900,2010-01-25 18:55:00,544,"http://canadaonline.about.com/gi/o.h.../menu-eng.html scar, I think you may be referring to the CANPASS card..."
1163275,stinkycat,2010-01-25 19:14:00,2018,Don't you plan on coming back?
1163281,prov1900,2010-01-25 19:25:00,544,Lucky guy!!!
1163282,brn2fsh,2010-01-25 19:28:00,49,"Best thing you can do is contact a border station and ask them. You don't need a passport to get into Canada--but you need one to get back into the states. We had to show ID for our children this year (Going both ways) so a passport was easiest.Adults only had to show a drivers license going over this year, but we were asked for the passports coming back. Rob"
1163345,Obabikon,2010-01-26 06:10:00,2370,You can cross into Canada with a drivers license... it's crossing back into the U.S. that gets tricky.
1163352,Aaron-IN,2010-01-26 06:53:00,500,Take your birth certificate and drivers liscense. The US wont prevent you from coming back in. You will create a lot of hassle for yourself though and will wish you just got your passport.
1163358,CAFish,2010-01-26 07:22:00,3,"Better yet, if you don't have to travel internationally by air, just get a passport card. Only $45 and also good for 10 years.Here is the link to the website:http://travel.state.gov/passport/ppt...card_3926.html"
1163378,Larry Mac,2010-01-26 08:10:00,530,"Hi Scar, I agree with Aaron-IN, if it is at all possible to obtain a passport I would highly recommend it. We have all (including the kids) obtained our passports when they were just talking about it and kept postponing the implementation date. We have found it wonderful both going into Canada and returning home. It just made crossing so much nicer and easier. Have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1163385,Kruger,2010-01-26 08:31:00,259,Last year crossing at Saulte Ste Marie we handed the customs agent our drivers licenses when going into Canada. He asked us if we planned on trying to get back into the U.S. with just our licenses. When we told him that we had passports he said he needed to see them.
