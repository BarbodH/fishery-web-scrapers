1171027,mrwalleye5,2010-02-22 06:52:00,1922,Just to give you an idea. This is Manitoba...Quebec will be a bit higher. 98.9 cents/litre or...$4.48 CDN/Canadian Gallon(bigger then US)..or $3.73 CDN/US Gallon ( Converted). If you want to factor in the exchange take another 6 percent off of those values. To simplify.. I was across the line in December and I paid $2.89 US/US gallon. This converted to equivilant Canadian Gallon and Canadian currency is $3.68 and our price is $4.48. So you are looking at 80 cents more per gallon then you would pay in US. W5
