1171314,Guest,2010-02-23 07:41:00,0,"Looking for recomendations for a good drive-to or fly-in outfitter within 4-5 hours of the Soo. Walleye, northern, bass if possible. Any advice appreciated. Our group usually goes thru Int'l Falls but it looks like the Soo is this years destination. Prefer cabins over lodge; don't want a ""family"" destination type of place."

1171468,Rich B,2010-02-23 17:16:00,1081,Check out Happy Day Lodge - I've been up 3 times and it's the only camp on the lake. Run by a younger couple with their 2 sons - docks right out in front of the cabins - very clean and well run camp. Good fishing and plenty of water to get off by yourself - be sure to take along a GPS to find your way back to camp if you're out after dark. Lot's of repeat customers (I mean going back 20-30 years) so that speaks well for the fishing and camp. Website is: www.happydaylodge.com PM me if you want more info. Good luck on your search. Rich B

They have both a lodge and housekeeping cabins and provide an american plan. They also have outpost lakes you can be the only cabin on the lake. Good people , good food and close by fishing, no need of 45 min. runs."

What sets Brace Lake apart from the others is the new Owners, Kyle & Teri Poleski. A young Couple in their early 30's committed to your Canadian Experience vacation. I take all of my groups of 8-10 to this camp in confidence that we are leaving satisfied,and as friends. If you have any questions or concerns about this camp,call me at 419 304-8361 and I will honestly answer your questions. Pics if needed. My favorite choice.Kindest Regards,Rob"

1171978,Guest,2010-02-25 09:24:00,0,Thanks for all of the info. I'm searching thru the sites and will go to the Indy Boat Sport Travel show this evening. We've been going thru Int'l Falls for over 20 years but this and probably next yr. will be going thru the Soo. Feels like starting over from 20 yrs. ago looking for a decent place with good fishing. Thanks again.
