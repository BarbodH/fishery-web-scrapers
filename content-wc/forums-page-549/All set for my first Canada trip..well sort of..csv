1170924,stardaddyed,2010-02-21 18:16:00,20,"We (wife and 3 fifteen year old boys) were looking for a summer vacation and fishing trip. Did my research and have selected Deer Trail Lodge on Lake Eagle. We met the owners at an all Canada show and they were very helpful. Great references too.Now the realization has sunk in that I have to figure out how to do this! Here are the problems: novice fisherman, some bass fishing with moderate success. We are going the first week in August so I know it is not ""prime"" fishing season. What I am looking for is volume. I really don't care about what kind (other than enough Walleye for lunch). I would love to catch ANY size Muskie (just to say I've done it). I've been told by others that as long as I don't care about species and size I will be happy. So the first question is: Is this correct? Will I catch fish?The second question is related to the first. Where can I go to find the best information on what I should bring to make the trip successful? This would include food, clothing, equipment, etc. Third, where can I find basic information on fishing for Walleye, Northern and Muskie?I know this is a lot of questions but i have a long time to gather the info so bring it on! Thanks folks.Ed"
1170943,LIKEWALLEYE,2010-02-21 19:01:00,70,The resort owner should give you ideas and hints on what to use and types of bait. Dont bring potatos across the border. Dont forget your passport.-------have a good time
1170944,celticbass1,2010-02-21 19:20:00,67,"I'm no expert by any stratch of the imagination and I've never fished the body of water you are going to so keep that in mind. I have however fished in Canada for 17 or 18 years and have bass, pike, walleye, and trout fished for 30 years or so. 1.For me the most important tool in fishing a body of water I've never fished is a fish finder. It doesn't have to be fancy, just tell you what the bottom depth is and if there are weeds. Fishing in 60 feet of water wont produce fish so don't fish there 2. To catch numbers of walleye keep it simple and relatively small get about 50 1/4, 1/8, and maybe a few 3/8 ounce round jig heads. Next buy several curly tail grubs in a variety of colors. Tie em on a 6' light action rod and cast to weeds and rocks in water from 10-30 feet deep. Tube jigs work really well also. Keep your line tight all the time and when you feel the tick of a fish, set the hook. 3. For pike and Muskie if you don't care about catching a monster then use the same trick as item number two, go small, 1/2 ounce spinnerbaits in white and chartreuse with a combination blade configurations. Many people would argue with this tactic but you will definately catch pike and might catch musky. Musky are very difficult to catch but your lodge owner should be able to help you out. Also get some 1/2 ounce rat-l-traps for pike fishing. If you really wanted get in to musky fishing many people would suggest that you get very large rods, reels, and lures that would tire even the most seasoned fisherman out while using them. Instead get a 6'6"" medium heavy rod with a good baitcast reel. If you've never used a baitcaster get help learning before you get there and practice before you go to Canada. 4. As for what to bring, I'm not sure what the lodge provides for bedding but I always bring a sleeping bag, a sheet, for hot nights rather than sleeping in the bag, and my own pillow. In August bring a variety of shorts, t-shirts, a rain suit (it rains a lot in Canada), Blue jeans , swaetshirts, and one fall weather coat. You probably wont need the coat but better safe than sorry. Bring at least two pairs of shoes, waterproof hiking boots are handy, and I like a pair of sandals for walking around camp. Don't forget bug spray because there will definately be mosquitoes in August especially at night. A deck of cards, a book, filet knife, something to sharpen the filet knife, flashlights, snacks and a sense of adventure. There are many other things but I'm getting too long winded here. 5. If you drink alcohol, bring a case of beer with you or a 1/5th if you prefer. You can bring one case or 1-fifth per adult in to Canada without paying tax. We have actually found it cheaper to bring all of our alcohol over from the US than to buy any in Canada. Even a cheap case of beer in Canada is $28.00. Don't bring potatoes or blueberries in to the country, they will probably take them from you anyway. That's it for now I'll be interested to see what others say."
1170946,tackleman,2010-02-21 19:27:00,444,"In my opinion the first week of August is the prime fishing time. I find walleye very slow in early season on Eagle but as the water warms so does the fishing.Well I don't know the location of the lodge you are going to I'm sure that the camp owners as well as any of their guides will gladly show you some spots.Have a great tripand enjoy Eagle Lake, it is truly a spectacular lake in fishing and scenery."
1170991,eyemike,2010-02-21 21:56:00,233,"I stayed on Eagle Lake in August this past year. It was my first trip to Eagle. I have been going to Canada since 1983. Get a guide for at least one day! It will be the best money that you spend the whole week. Eagle is Big! It is full of walleyes, big walleyes. It is full of big smallmouth, big lake trout, big pike, and monster musky. If you don't hire a guide for at least part of your time you will be disappointed I will just about promise you that. The lake is not the type of lake that you pull up to a point or some rocks and just catch fish, a guide fishes every day, they will put you on fish. Take a good gps so when you do go venturing off you have the secure feeling you will get back. If you are renting a boat, rent one with at least a 40 hp. motor so you won't be spending all your time going to and from. Take lots of lindy rigs with you with about 3/8 to 1/2 oz. sinker. Most of your fish tend to be caught in 20 plus feet of water in August. Again I stress to you Hire a guide you will not regret the money you spend. Mike..."
1170995,bpetersen,2010-02-21 22:44:00,251,"I have fished Eagle in Early August and it was good walleye and Smallmouth fishing. Your resort owner will give you some spots to try. I believe Eagle has a law now that doesn't allow night fishing. It usually doesn't affect most people. We take enough food for about 3 or 4 days and then hit the grocery store. There is a good grocery store in Vermillion Bay for extra supplies. Also, if you choice to go out to eat, try Buster's Barbeque in Vermillion on Highway 17. It is very good food. Kevin, the owner, use to be a resort owner and could give you some tips, also. Blueberrys should still be o.k. this time of the year. It might be toward the end of the picking season. Ask the resort owner for the nearest patch. We bring our own night crawlers into Canada as long as you don't bring them in dirt. No leeches or live minnow can be brought across the line. Minnows will run about $4 - $5 per dozen in Vermillion Bay if your resort doesn't sell them, if you choice to use minnows for bait. I use lindy rigs and jigs mainly but many people will use crankbaits. Shad raps and reef runner work well and I have caught walleye up there with Johnson's silver minnows. Try these links: The first one is for the ministry information and the second will have endless information and ways to order information about the Vermillion Bay area and ways to get maps of Eagle. The usually offer a packet of information and map of the area if interested.http://cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/pub/bsf5082-eng.pdfhttp://www.noto.net/ Good luck. If you would like more information. Send me a PM."
1171052,hoosiercanadian,2010-02-22 08:47:00,104,"I absolutely agree on getting the guide for the first couple of days, which may cost you at least $ 150.00 a day, but will be worth it, don't skimp here, the rest of the time ,for walleye , and bass , fish points and shoreline where the wind is blowing into. On bright sunny windless days, fish for walleye and bass in the mornings and the evenings, in the middle of the day cast for pike around weed beds, beaver dams, and fallen trees, you might even luck into a muskie that way, personally i wouldn't waste alot of time on the muskie, ive fished in canada all my life and have never caught one, only been on one lake where there were any, Lake Of The Woods, and we were targeting mostly smallmouth, i now fish way out of their range . A word of advice on running a boat on a lake you aren't familiar with is to be very careful , especially if you let the boys run the boat, never been on eagle, but i'm sure it has it's share of reefs, you just can't run a boat wide open on water you don't know, learned this the hard way many years ago. I remember as a kid running the boat with my parents on a cannadian trip , was way out in the middle of the lake , hit something, and it threw the cover of the 18 evinrude off up into the bow of the boat, luckily not hitting anyone, another time i was coming out of a big bay opening up my 55 johnson, took my eyes off the water breifly to look at some approaching weather, hit a reef , blasted my lower unit 10 miles from camp, needless to say it put a damper on on my trip, just be careful, i take my 4 daughters every summer, been taking them since they were babies, it is the highlight of my year, and the memories will last forever."
1171061,dutchboy,2010-02-22 09:27:00,5717,"Welcome to Walleye Central!Assuming the wife and boys won't be fishing all the time just be sure you have what you will need. Your style of fishing will mesh with Eagle Lake, no matter how you like to to fish.Guides are a great place to start. Have them show you locations relatively close to your resort. You will become much more comfortable going to spots close by then running 10 miles across the lake. Remember, it's a vacation not a stress test. Do things that will make you comfortable. If you wanna catch Pike, spoons (five of diamonds) spinnerbaits, rattle traps all produce. I always bring at least 2 of every bait, I tend to get bit off or hung up on rocks and will lose at least one. lol As others have said, bring jigs, lots of jigs. Dress them with split tail grubs or the plastic of your choice. Bass, Pike, Walleye will all fall prey to jigs.You must have a locator. If you are renting a boat from the resort make sure they have one. Other then that a quality net (don't bring a pan fish net ) rain gear, clothes for all weather, pliers, jaw spreader and most importantly.........a good camera and you will be set to go.You are gonna love this trip!!"
1171074,AllenW,2010-02-22 10:12:00,11482,"If the owners gonna help ya, wait to get the guide and see what happens.Also if just you, and your out for muskies, find a heavy northern /med musky rod and mid priced reel like one of the Garcia 6500C series ad some 45#+ musky line like the stuff from Cortland's Musky master, and pick up a FEW musky baits, Bulldogs seem to be popular, I like Bucktails and Reef hawgs and a Black Suick, all depends on how much you want to spend, it gets pretty easy to tie up $300-$500 in musky baits and still not have a lot of them.Add a few northern baits and you can go for both with the same set up.A good big net is a must, especially if your out by yourself.Not rubber btw.Fishfinder?Call the resort and ask if they supply one with the boat, if not, buy a basic unit that's adaptable to the transom of the boat with out screwing a mount on it, most resort owners get a little funny when you head to wards their boats with screws and such..Trolling motors?Once again call, if they send you off in a boat with a 30-40 hp motor or so, you may not need one, if their motor won't work for trolling ask them if its ok to bring one or they may have one for rent.Probably better to rent unless you'll have use for it in the future.Remember, this is only my opinion...fwiwAl"
1171077,eyemike,2010-02-22 10:24:00,233,Go to this website and check out this guide http://www.eagleeyeguiding.com/ Mike... there is an insider member ...vbay gord that can probably help you out with every question you have. He probably knows that lake better than anyone on this site. Go to member list and p.m him ...Mike...
1171087,PIKEMAN330,2010-02-22 11:01:00,101,My favorite lures are jigs and twister tails for walleyes.also pay attention to the wind and fish where the wind is blowing in.For pike four and one half inch doctor spoons and one and an eighth oz. Johnson Silver Minnows are about all you need.In Aug. the pike will be in weeds so the weedless Johnsons are a must. I have caught some of my largest walleyes on these spoons fishing in reeds.I am aMusky fisherman but for your first trip I would forget about them. Way to much time and money to invest.Since you are going to a drive to lake it is not so important to take everything you will need You can always go buy it.Not like a flyin where if you don't take it you don't have it.On a lake as good as Eagle you can keep it simple and still have success. Good fishing Pikeman
1171127,bpetersen,2010-02-22 14:04:00,251,"1. Needing an electric trolling motor depends on how you do your fishing and if your engine is small enough to back troll. You can get by without one if you drift, use the engine and back troll or anchor and jig or cast. 2. Without a doubt, have a fish locator, if for nothing else to read your depths. P.S. One thing I have found out about this forum is you can usually find someone to answer questions. It has been a great help for me. Don't be shy about asking questions. The more prepared you are, the better off you will be. I don't have any GPS reading of Eagle but maybe some of our fellow member can give you a couple of coordinates to get you started. I am one of those people that doesn't use a guide. When I went to Lac Seul last year, this forum really helped me get prepared."
1171299,Babamel2,2010-02-23 07:09:00,414,"If you will be using more than one boat, having a set of walkie talkies or other two way radios, can really be a wonderful way of communicating. If you will be using lures, be sure to bring plenty of steel leaders, Pike teeth are sharp and can easily cut fishing line.Setting the drag properly can save a lot of snagged lures. Set it tight enough for setting a hook but no loose enough that it will slip when snagged. When ya do get snagged, quickly release the line, back up the boat and pull it free from the opposite side. Using Fireline, Power Pro or one of the other thin lines allows you to use a 20 lb plus line (which helps for retrieving snagged lures) but still have a light enough line for good fishing. (thats my 2 cents worth)"
1171981,Aaron-IN,2010-02-25 09:30:00,500,Buy of couple Torpedo top water baits and have fun wiping out the smallmouth in the morning and evening. It really is that simple.
1172081,Paul H,2010-02-25 14:55:00,1232,"A few different ideas. Don't overlook panfish - both for the eating aspect, and just plain fun. Perch and rock bass if they are there. perch are always good eating, easy to catch and can be fast action. Any beaver hutch can be a good location. Piece of crawler or even take some waxworms. Big minnows if you can get for pike and bigger walleye. Torpedos as someone said - small floating rapallas and PLENTY of jigs and grubs - highly recommend gulp or power bait, both for walleye and smallmouth. Bug protection - especially if out at night. If you plan or can do night fishing, a head net is a good idea. Definitely have a GPS - and a finder - don't need nothing very fancy. Save time for sight seeing, wild life watching, northern light viewing, loons calling, campfires, and the TIME OF YOUR LIFE."
1172203,eyemike,2010-02-25 21:14:00,233,"You can not fish at night on Eagle Lake. You can fish until sunset, They were pulling some big eyes after supper pulling cranks in deep open water. The eyes are chasing schools of baitfish. the lures used were deep diving Wally Divers, #7 & #8 ShadRaps, I would try an assortment of deep divers and then troll troll troll. You have an hour or 2 after supper to do it. The resort will be able to tell you when sunset time is. Mike..."
1172334,Aaron-IN,2010-02-26 10:55:00,500,"When you say ""you cannot fish at night on Eagle""...what exactly does that mean? Does that mean you can't be on the lake in a boat after dark? Just wondering how in the world they would inforce such a .......(well, I won't say it) rule on a lake that big.?"
1172353,Nimstug,2010-02-26 11:55:00,2605,"Well, it means you can't fish on Eagle between certain hours. The times I fished it, we and the others at our lodge were off the water about the time you'd have to put on your nav. lights. Since there are two or three definitions of sunset/dusk and dawn/sunrise, the advice to check with the lodge is good. The times I was there in August, we were coming in about 8:30-45, about a half hour after actual sunset. You can be on the water in a boat after dark, as we had to run to our boat-in camp's ramp so we could get a Bandit removed from my son's hand. The camp came after dark and got us. It's a rule on Eagle, just as the slot limits and other fishing regs and has been in existence since at least '98, which was the first time I was there. Eagle has made a good comeback as a fishery and, from what I have heard, continue to improves. It's not just the MNR that's watching, it's the camp owners too. NimstugWhen I grow up, I want to be a little boy."
1172379,Aaron-IN,2010-02-26 13:10:00,500,"Nimstug,Thanks for the reply. I don't mean to be a dummy here but is the point of that rule to protect the fish? That just seems really silly to me. When I first saw that thread my first reaction was that it must be for safety reasons for boaters but that does not sound like the case. I've been going to Canada for 30 years and have never heard of such a rule on any lake (granted I've never been to Eagle). Does anyone else want to weigh in on this? If the rule is to protect the fish how does the MNR figure it will protect the fish? I fish at night all the time up there and can tell you except during certain moon phases you have a better chance of hurting the fish population during daylight hours than you do at night. Interested in any info on this."
1172387,Nimstug,2010-02-26 13:37:00,2605,"It is my understanding it is to protect walleye. I can't comment on how the MNR came up with this regulation for just 'one' lake (there may be others?) Speaking in generalities, I don't think Eagle is any more dangerous to navigate at night than any other of the big shield lakes. Nimstug"
1172059,Guest,2010-02-25 13:48:00,0,"Good info all. From my perspective, the need for a electric trolling motor, while nice, is not a critical need. Why: a) On most rental boats, they often have only one battery for starting the engine, which means you need to bring an additional battery if you plane on running the trolling motor a great deal. Then perhaps a charger as well. b. While trolling motors are nice for holding on the ""spot-within-a-spot, for all the back or forward trolling I have done in Canada on vacation, we have managed to do just great with the single motor, which includes engines all the way up to a 90 HP. With the new engines you dial down your RPM to set a trolling speed in the 1. 1 - 1.3 MPH range and if you want to go slower than that just kick it out of gear ever other minute or two and you can be as slow as you want. The depth finder is the key bit of equipment especially if your going in July/August when the fish will be more frequently located on off-shore reefs. With a depth finder you cn find any reef pretty quicly even without GPS (both are better but if I had to have only one in Canada where not every lake has a great navigation chip, the depth finder is the key tool). Get a good portable and you will be in great shape. Cheers... IA Walleye"
1172075,Golden Eagle,2010-02-25 14:37:00,2642,"Stardaddyeyed, I see a great opportunity for you. Sell the family on the idea of your pre-fishing the lake. Go with an experienced fishermen and fish Eagle in June. Hire a guide, but tell him you need a little more than usual and offer to pay extra for fishing tips, plus fishing spots that will produce for your second trip of the season when your family joins you. Take a GPS and ask if your guide minds if you mark a few waypoints. I wouldn't do it without requesting permission. Do it and he might have you trolling in circles in the deepest part of the lake. Then you can offer a somewhat experienced fishermen to your party in August."
1171019,Skywagon,2010-02-22 06:29:00,1106,"I will repeat what was suggested in getting a guide the first day or two. It is costly, but will be invalueable in helping you and your crew, in learning how, where to catch fish and easily be the difference in catching fish or not. This first year, in your situation, that would not be an area to scimp on. Good luck on the Musky, they call them the fish of 10,000 casts. I would suggest that 3-15 years olds might tire of the lack of action rather quickly. After you get walleye figured out, maybe the boys could go out on their own, while you try for Musky.We all loose lots of jigs and lures in the rocks, but as your group is learning, they will loose many more at first. Talk to your camp owner and find out what colors and jig sizes he suggests, plan on buying 10 colored lead head jigs per person before you leave home (try Cabella's, Gander Mountain, Bass Pro) and that will just be a start. Also, a lot of times the eyelets on lead jigs are painted over, blocking the hole. There is a very inexpensive item ($3-4) you can buy to knock the paint out, it is a good investment. Good luck on your trip."
1171020,deputy dog,2010-02-22 06:33:00,305,"if possible get a hand held gps, learn how to use it before u go, get a guide the first full day of fishing, and mark the spots he takes you to on the gps. you can always find new spots but it's nice to have a few tried and true spots from the guide. if you can take or get night crawlers consider it for tippin jigs, always been successful for us."

1171045,stardaddyed,2010-02-22 08:14:00,20,"You guys are awesome. I am so excited I can't stand it. I've never been to Canada so getting into the wilderness will be exciting.When I spoke to the owners about guiding they offered a tour of the lake and all the help I wanted but do not have guides. They said I didn't need them. I was curious about this but some friends at work said that is probably true...given what I want to do. Everything changes when you go from ""I'll catch anything"" to ""I only want big big walleye"". As long as I don't care what kind of fish I catch I am OK. I am a little nervous with that. If the camp I am at doesn't have guides can I get one someplace else or am I stuck? The cost here is not the issue because the way I look at it I am dropping some cash for the trip and more importantly time to drive 15 hours then spend a week and then drive 15 hours back. Another couple of hundred bucks is pretty small price to pay. In fact it is in the budget.Al, misunderstood. At any one time there will be at most 2 or 3 in the boat. Wife won't fish, on son has no interest and the other two may go for half a day at a time. we won't be over crowded. Most of the time I expect it will be me all alone (which is fine). Already have a hand held GPS. It was suggested that I get one because I was told that once you get away from camp the shoreline looks the same in every direction.....water then rocks then trees. Very easy to get turned around.Two more questions: Trolling motors and fishfinders? Need them or not.Ed"
