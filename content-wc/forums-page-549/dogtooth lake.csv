1171848,Rich B,2010-02-24 19:35:00,1081,"Joe - run a ""search"" on Dogtooth lake as there were a number of posts last year on this lake with good info/details. From what I remember, a number of guys thought it was a good lake to fish - except for one naysayer (ha). It will take a little time getting to know it, as it's a larger lake). Good luck, Rich B"

1172187,ScottL,2010-02-25 20:40:00,733,The best map of Dogtooth that I know of is the one that Wayne at Dogtooth Lake Resort has put together. The Navionics Premium North chip has the basic background map of the lake but no contour lines. I'll see if I've got anything else that I could send your way. It's a great lake by the way and I really enjoy fishing it.When in June are you going and where are you staying. I'll be there June 26th thru the 30th.
