1172164,tackleman,2010-02-25 19:28:00,444,"I find it hard to fish the river, those **** fish keep taking my minnows.What am I doing wrong?"
1172169,hoosiercanadian,2010-02-25 19:33:00,104,"I walk the trail along it, and cast the pools below several sets of rapids between the pine road bridge ,and where it flows out of Little Vermilion Lake, and before it flows into Red lake , the trail can be muddy at times and the banks steep , but the fishing has always been good, i love moving water !"

1172649,Whopper,2010-02-27 13:44:00,340,I was on the stretch that leaves Little Vermilion last spring would have loved to fish it but it was off limits but I can just about imagine what swims there. I heard some stories from people that have and they always have a smile on their faces
1172664,Golden Eagle,2010-02-27 15:40:00,2642,"Whopper, that was a nice 16 footer that you salvaged and brought back to camp. Mike is over the cold swim and is returning May 15, 2010. Probably smarter and much more experienced."
