1172393,Nimstug,2010-02-26 13:53:00,2605,"Got into a discussion toward the end of another thread with AAron in Indiana regarding the history, reasoning of prohibiting night fishing on Eagle Lake, Ontario. My understanding is it is to protect the walleye fishery, and it is unique to Eagle. I know the regulation goes back at least 12 years. And for awhile Eagle was considered something less than an ideal place to fish.Something about the habitat or history a of netting? MNR studies, or advocated by lodge owner? Is Eagle the only 'big' lake in NW Ontario with this regulation? I'm not looking to generate heat; actually looking for a little light on the subject. Thanks,Nimstug"

1172455,tackleman,2010-02-26 17:00:00,444,"the guys I fish with on eagle have had a camp there for over 50 years and they told me that when night fishing was allowed EVERYONE would go out at night and bring home huge amounts of large walleye, this would remove the big spawners. When the ministry finally got the lead out of their butts and realized what was happening, they introduced the no fishing at night regulation.This has certainly helped but it also is incumbent on the camp owners and locals that fish the lake to keep to the size regulations and protect those spawners to bring the lake back.I don't know if commercial fishing still takes place on eagle , perhaps vbay gord knows if this is happening."
1172492,wallhawk,2010-02-26 19:14:00,22,"it has been at least 15 years since night fishing has been outlawed on Eagle. there used to be a hundred boats or more in 80 foot of water catching monster walleyes and northerns that were chasing ciscoes at night (not a good thing). the fishing has improved greatly over the years partly as a result of the night fishing ban and the 18-23"" slot. now you catch a lot of 23-25"" walleyes and at least one 27"" to 30"" on a week's trip."
1172505,v-bay gord,2010-02-26 19:56:00,3168,"Without researching dates and such (terrible to get so old and forgetful !) the following is my recollection on these topics........ The night fishing ban occurred back in the 80's (?) after the MNR started to come up with proposed fisheries strategy plans for Eagle Lake. Back then, apparently most anglers and lodge owners felt that the lake was inexhausable in the amount of walleyes that could be harvested. Remember, back then the limit was higher, and there was no size limit. Someone discovered that in one particular area of the lake, Viking Reef, trolling big rapalas over 80 feet of water at dusk would yield you as many huge walleyes as you wanted. The fish were coming closer to the surface chasing ciscoes and were vulnerable to being caught. Apparently many limits of 6 to 8 pound walleye were the norm. Even the lodge owners were becoming concerned over the slaughter going on. With a little push from the MNR saying that they were going to impose regulations, well, suddenly the lodge owners became conservation minded. This is where the regulation for the night fishing ban was born. Originally it was just for walleye, but inforcement issues around that caused it to be extended to fishing in general. Since then other regulations have come into effect, such as the slot size for walleye and pike. Perhaps this makes the need for the night ban somewhat less, but regardless it is still in effect. What is amazing, is that it is the only lake in Ontario with such a regulation. Personally, I think it still serves a purpose and should remain. Someone mentioned the commercial fishery and if it still exists. Yes, there is one licenced commercial fishery on Eagle Lake. It is licenced primarily for whitefish, with a small incidental catch allowed for walleye and pike. It is limited to the main section of the lake.........a 15 x 5 mile section stretching from Viking Reef to the Walleye Rocks. Back in ""the day"" we (the Eagle Lake Conservation Group......a whole other chapter on the history of the lake) spent the entire summer on board the commercial fishermans boat. Of course when fishing is tough it is always easy to blame someone else.....such as a commercial fisherman. The reality is they catch mostly whitefish, and are good at targeting this species. The walleye they catch would not represent the annual shorelunch consumption of some of the bigger lodges. In the past few years I know the commercial fisherman is having a harder time targeting the whitefish without the incidental walleye catch. He feels this is due to too many bigger walleye in the lake. An interesting take on the situation.....who really knows? What I know today, is that the fishery on Eagle has rebounded big time. I know that big walleye are still being caught before dusk using the same techniques that were raping the lake back in the 80's. The difference today is that catch and release and slot limits are working. People are not coming back to camp with six eight pounders on a stringer (do that now and you would be shot). There is control on this regulation mainly by the camps and residents, but the MNR are still enforcing this regulation."
1172536,Nimstug,2010-02-26 22:21:00,2605,"V-Bay,Thank you for the history and the unique circumstances that brought about this about. Very interesting that it is the only lake with that regulation. NimstugPS: Go USA!"
1172601,Aaron-IN,2010-02-27 07:58:00,500,"V-Bay...yes, thanks for the reply. Very interesting indeed. It sounds like you can't fish at all on Eagle at night regardless of whether you keep anything or not."
