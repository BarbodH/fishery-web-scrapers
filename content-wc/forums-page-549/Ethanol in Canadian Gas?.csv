1172052,Guest,2010-02-25 13:18:00,0,"In 2008 our gas supplier for camp( Esso) told us we no longer had a choice, but we were going to receive ethanol fuel, after we received the first fuel fill up with ethanol fuel added, half of our fleet of 30 outboard motors was down for repair because of fuel problem, every outboard motor we owned had to go into the local shop for carburetor cleaning. Ethanol works as a cleaning agent, and loosened up any build up in the carburetors, it's also hard on the gas line hoses, it eats the rubber hose. Ranted and raved to our fuel supplier & told him of our problems, he gave me a ball cap & a t- shirt that didn't fit to calm me down, it didn't work. In 2009 we we were able to get fuel 89 Octane with no ethanol delivered to camp at a extra cost & never had a single motor in for carburetors cleaning. The ethanol fuel didn't seem to bother those that brought their own boats into camp. Maybe their motors were use to already burning the ethanol fuel. Sorry guys but I have nothing good to say about Ethonal being added to gas. It has a very short storage life, Ethanol doesn't mix with water, it separates it. It's not a good mix for outboard motors."
1172122,GBS,2010-02-25 17:21:00,2271,"I have the same motor as noted, but it has been run it's entire life with ethanol here in Minnesota. No issues. It got it's first water seperator/fuel filter last spring. Fill the tank in the fall, add seafoam, go out for a last trip or two (to get the treated fuel to the carbs), top off with both, if needed. Winterize. Put her away for six months. Run her all summer, and repeat."
1172171,Skywagon,2010-02-25 19:35:00,1106,"We have run 10% ethanol in our (many) sizes of gasoline engines for years on the farm with no problems. This ethanol hype is over exagerated by a few. Possibly, it did clean some carberators that had not been using it, but that is a far as it goes. I think you are as likely as not, to find ethanol in the gas up here, don't worry about it, it is not a problem. All my boat motors, 4 wheeler, snowmobiles, lawn mower, weed eater, chain saw and wood splitter all burn it with no problem."
1171102,Lake Wisconsin,2010-02-22 11:59:00,1960,"I have a trip booked to a drive in lake for this June. The lodge we are staying at has stated you can't bring in your own fuel. They are fine with a full tank in the boat, but don't want fuel can's in the back of your truck due to insurance liability. I asked if their dock fuel contains ethanol  and she stated yes, all CA gas contains 10%. 2 years ago I had major issues with my motor running like crap, spitting and sputtering. After a lot of trouble shooting, I finally hooked up a different gas tank to my boat with fresh, non-ethanol fuel, and wham  issues went away. Since then I go out of my way to make sure I run 100% gas in my motor (2000 Johnson 115 horse carb 2-stroke). Depending on where the fish are, I will run through about 40 gallons of fuel. My boat holds 24 gallons, so I am short 16. So I am at a dilemma. Run their gas and take a risk of having a poor running motor while in Canada. Or pack in my own fuel (covered truck) and sneak in fueling my boat at night when they are called it a night. Any other thoughts or suggestions?"
1171111,v-bay gord,2010-02-22 13:00:00,3168,"Premium gas in Canada should not have ethanol. Perhaps your lodge owner can arrange to have 16 gals. available for you. If not, is there a nearby gas station where you could pick up some premium gas? Short of that, I would contact the lodge and state you need to bring in the proper fuel and ask them to store it ""safely"" for you."
1171112,Pooch,2010-02-22 13:00:00,4619,I don't remember seeing any fuel pumps with ethanol in Ontario. Unless they don't have to be labeled like in the USA.When we stay at Mawkwa Lodge they don't want fuel around the cabins becasue of fire regulations and just plain common sense.Maybe I'm not paying close enough attention.Pooch
1171228,adempsey,2010-02-22 19:09:00,963,"In Ontario most gas stations offer three or four different gas options. The cheapest two are usually 10% ethanol (max allowed by the government). I am not sure about the top end ""premium"" one. They should be labeled, but I am pretty sure they aren't all ethanol-free."
1171255,tackleman,2010-02-22 21:43:00,444,buy a couple cans of seafoam for marine engines and bring that with you to add to any gas you buy here. It is a great product and the only mechanic I trust up here in Red Lake swears by the stuff. It not only reduces the amount of water in your gas but it is also a gas conditioner .
1171263,orchard frank,2010-02-22 22:32:00,1900,"I agree with using seafoam. Another thing you might try is to add the new gas every time you get down 5 gallons or so, that way you would not be running pure ethanol gas, only a partial mix."
1171305,Blackmacs,2010-02-23 07:24:00,2121,"I wonder if your issues stemmed from a bad batch of gas and not necessarily from the fact that it had ethanol in it. It may possibly could have though. I guess I would talk to the lodge and see what they could do for you. After all there are engines that the manufacturers specify 91 octane. I can't believe they would tell a customer they can't come because of their outboard. Most of the resorts in Minnesota carry 91 octane non ethanol, especially ones that are open in the winter catering to snowmobilers. Anyway I would take an extra 6 gallon portable tank with me and carry it with in the boat, assuming you have room, just in case you have to use their fuel and you'd run into issues. that way at least you'd have fuel you have confidence in to get you back to the dock. BTW ""insurance liability"" probably mans we want you to pay for our fuel. I can see the potential for issues with guests bringing 100's of gallons of their own fuel though."
1171387,Flip Silverlake,2010-02-23 11:50:00,645,ALL pump gas in Canada is E-10. This covers all dock gas also. I have the same motor a 2000 115 Johnson and it did not seem to bother my motor. I did install a Racor 10 micron fuel water seperator and use that new Marine Stabil with every fill up. Seafom is also good. You cannot get anything with out it being E-10 north of the boarder. The law went into effect in 2009.
1171420,retire55,2010-02-23 13:23:00,1029,"FWIW I telephoned Imperial Oil's (Esso gasoline) technical hotline in Ontario today to ascertain information about ethanol in Esso gasoline. I learned 4 things. 1. Apparently the new law (requiring ethanol in gas) has not yet been fully implemented. 2. Esso's regular unleaded gas normally contains 10% ethanol (E10). Your receipt will show RUETH for regular unleaded ethanol. However, not all Esso stations pump E10 and in those cases your receipt will show RUL for regular unleaded. I checked with my local Esso station today and they don't pump any gas containing ethanol. 3. Mid octane gas available at Esso pumps will normally contain 5% ethanol. 4. Esso's Supreme grade gas normally contains no ethanol at all."
1171584,Guest,2010-02-24 07:52:00,0,http://www.imperialoil.ca/Canada-Eng...lsProducts.asp I live in Thunder Bay and have yet to see Ethanol in our fuel. I only see it when we go to the US. Pumps are marked with a posting if ethanol is in the fuel.
