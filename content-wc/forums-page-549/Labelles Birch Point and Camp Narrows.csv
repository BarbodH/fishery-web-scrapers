1171805,Jeff Jones,2010-02-24 18:02:00,49,I have narrowed it down to these 2 camps for our first canadian fishing trip. We are after smallmouth and any other bonus fish. Which do you recommend?
1171815,Davis Viehbeck,2010-02-24 18:14:00,48,Both are solid camps. Biggest difference is drive to vs boat to. Camp Narrows is water access. DV
