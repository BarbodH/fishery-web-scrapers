Seems like a very good place but I have been down that road before coming up here for over 20 years now. We are looking at doing the Housekeeping Plan, bring your own boat, and maybe having a few meals in their Resteraunt. That way we are on our own schedule. We mainly go after Walleye as the last several years we have went to Lac Seul, but I am loking forward to going after the smallmouth to for a change. I have always loved LOTW. I appreciate your feedback."

The bass fishing is excellent and walleye/musky/ even trout are all within easy distance. The trout are strictly catch and release unless you have a tag. The guides are good. Use one for a day or two then you will know the area better. It's really reefy in some areas. Have a great summer and if you want to come earlier in the season, we have our tourist camp located on the south end of LOTW. (Bell Island Outpost camps) We have the last two weeks left in June. Good luck with your summer trip."
