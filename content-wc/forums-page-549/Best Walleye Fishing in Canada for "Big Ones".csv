1171595,Jiggy06,2010-02-24 08:18:00,7,"Just Checked my Master Angler Book for all of Manitoba. Cobham River Lodge, the lodge I go to tied for the biggest Walleye caught in the provience for 2009. 31 inches. Pretty good considering they only have 60 guests a year compared to hundreds of people fishing the other places. They have a website www.cobham-river-lodge.com Jiggy06"
1166994,manitobawalleye,2010-02-07 19:55:00,885,wasn't this initial post in regards to fly-in lakes?
1167566,MoWalleyeguy,2010-02-09 17:02:00,409,"""We are already booked for next spring"" Who is we???... I thought you were the GUEST!"
1167703,LeeMB,2010-02-10 07:27:00,83,"I have the lodge that is 5 minutes from the Graveyard and Little Gods. We catch tons of Walleyes near 28"" and up to 30"". I have had many peoiple catch over 5 walleyes in one day over 28""."
1168091,kgeary,2010-02-11 09:57:00,88,"Because of the portage to get around the rapids Nungesser lake is like a fly-in (without the expense of flying). The portage acts like a gate. For our guests we have a boardwalk and atv so they don't need to carry anything. Simply walk 300 yards across our boardwalk. The lake is about 28000 acres, big enough but not intimidating, with very little pressure. I realize that there are other bodies of water that produce big walleye but for a combination of price, scenery, wildlife and remote yet easy to reach, Nungesser is hard to beat. I've had days with 5 or 6 over 28 inches and guests report similar days. myself and my wife Debra have caught walleye over 30 inches, my 9 yr old daughter caught a 32 incher, Hayden caught a 30 incher when he was 5. I've found it interesting that none of the walleye over 29 inches have had any broken fins, hook marks etc that would indicate they have been caught before. I think Anglerdonny had it bang on."
1168871,teddi,2010-02-14 13:11:00,349,what about dogtooth lake east of kenora? lots of big walleye come out of there every year with no flying or boating in.
1169355,haybay larry,2010-02-16 05:28:00,136,I have been fishing the Bay Of quinte for 30 years and have been rewarded with many fish. In the late fall till ice up you can get big numbers of LARGE fish mid teens are common. Besides the Walleye their is an untapped fishery for Large and Small mouth Bass. This is a large area that can be fished all season with success....Larry
1170306,Guest,2010-02-19 12:56:00,0,"Lots and lots of options here. First let me start by saying that the lake that I fish has not been mentioned. We catch fish to 30 inches each trip. and any time of the year. We have fished it fo 10 years, and the odds of catching a 26 inch fish is greater than catching a 17 incher.( we target big ones) Basically, every one has there favorite lake, and if they can figure out where they are, the sumos will be there. Are some lakes better than others. You betcha!! But Canada has walleye everywhere. Our lodge owner told us once that Eagle Lake had a commercial fishery on it bach in the 50s that shipped 5 train cars full of fish per week. That is a lot of fish Go find them"
1170452,rigger1,2010-02-19 21:12:00,35,Are you catching these fish on Eagle lake? What resort do you go out of?
1170614,Guest,2010-02-20 15:24:00,0,no--It is a smaller lake about 20 miles from Eagle lake. would never mention the name of the lake on here. Dont like a crowd.

1164091,corvette1,2010-01-28 11:01:00,243,turtle chain i live 250 miles from the bay of quinte the big fish start coming into the bay from lake ontario oct till ice up the launch in picton is good look on a map east of toronto about 100-150 miles you will see the bay kgeary in the fall they are all full of eggs my 16lb was 32x22 i been at the bay for 15 years in 02 i lost a good paying factory job now i just go a couple times a year for the day manns 20+ deep reef runners rapala deep tail dancers with off shore boards all the fish are from a boat
1164270,Angler Donny,2010-01-28 22:01:00,11,"I am from Minnesota and we have been going to Nungesser lake for the past 5 years. The reason we go there is that there is no other lake in Canada that has the numbers AND SIZE of the Nungesser lake WALLEYES!Numerous Walleyes over 27 inches are very common as well as Walleye over 30 inches. Every trip we caught them except on the last trip we decided to concentrate on the BIG ladies of the lake ( Northern Pike). We were not dissaponted as we caught 12 over 40 inches! The reason the fishing is so good is that it is a big lake with hardly any fishing pressure. You need to go to either Anglers Kingdom or Nungesser Lake Lodge to get in ,because of the waterfall rapids keeps the TRASH out! Sure you can spend $3300 to a great lake like G-ds Lake ,but why go there when you get even better fishing at a 1/3rd of the price on Nunngesser! Also the named lodges are great. Family run with good service and a smile on their face. Nungesser is by far the best Walleye like in Canada. PERIOD!"

1164745,Angler Donny,2010-01-30 21:45:00,11,Trash means fishing pressure with many boats

1164865,SSA,2010-01-31 12:43:00,19,I believe Goose Bay camp has 3 outpost cabins at there location on Nungessor.
1166682,JinxCanada,2010-02-06 14:36:00,1306,"for BIG WALLEYE definitely Colchester Ontario in Lake Erie!!! The Walleye Capital of Canada!!! we routinely see 30"" plus 10-12lbs walleye all the time. last year in the tournament there i saw over 20 10+lbs walleye come in to be weighed. these things looked like rottweilers without legs...and this is not uncommon in this area. the average smallmouth is also around 5-6lbs and you can catch those all day...along with jumbo perch etc. Lake Erie is by far the best fishery in Canada when it comes to this type of fishing"

1157472,Rgate,2010-01-02 19:17:00,14,I guided over 70 days last year out of Morson on Lake of the Woods and caught quite a few big walleyes in 09. I've loaded some some photos into an album here on Walleye Central but am not sure how to link the album into this post - you can find them under Rgate. (here you go... https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...hp?albumid=385 )We also have a data base with fish caught through 2009 that you might find interesting. The link is http://buenavistaresort.com/cgi-bin/dbase.cgiI've been at Lake of the Woods for 37 years and there are more big fish now than in the past. Good luck finding a big one.
1157508,sptrix,2010-01-03 02:56:00,175,"We fished Nungessor several years ago when Kevin first opened the camp. East winds and rain had plagued the area for the better part of a month and when we first arrived, despite rain and strong winds, we caught all the walleyes we wanted. Pike were a different story. The only big pike to come during our week there were caught when they came after hooked walleyes.We did catch hundreds of walleye and many, many nice fish. I think it would be fair and accurate to say that Nungessor is a walleye factory. I think it would also be fair to say that Kevin Geary treated us exceptionally well and that he had the best equipment I'd ever seen at a camp. It was only his second year in operation so there were many improvements being made at the camp with respect to cabins, but the ones he had modified were very, very nice. Although we've decided to fish the far north for lake trout, I would endorse Kevin's camp and Nungessor Lake for those seeking a fantastic walleye destination."
1158038,ScottL,2010-01-05 08:54:00,733,"Dogtooth has produced many trophy class walleyes. I haven't cracked the 30"" mark yet but have had at least one 28+"" fish each of the last three years. The fishing is not ""easy"" and for the novice can be quite frustrating. Dogtooth is just a few mile southeast of Kenora and is a drive to lake with only one resort on it."
1158334,camp chef,2010-01-06 14:51:00,915,"I have fished all over Northwest Canada and by far the best Big Walleye and Huge pike water has to be Nungesser Lake. I don't have a camp on the lake and I didn't even stay at a Holiday Inn express last night, but I plan on returning to Nungesser as quickly and as often as I can afford."
1158431,Guest,2010-01-06 22:30:00,0,"I like your sense of humor camp chef. Thanks sptrix - over the years I've shared my experience and given my opinion on which lakes in the NWT I believe have the best Lake Trout fishing. I've shared my opinion on which lake holds the Biggest Ontario Pike. I started a blog - lots of pics and stories, kind of fun, lots of info, lots of big walleye. Have one photo of my neice with a 32 inch walleye caught in July. beautiful thick healthy fish. Of course I talk about pike too much but I can't help myself - check it out. on my main page click on ""current fishing reports and news"" don't forget to search the blog archive for 2009 and 2010 posts' Still not much snow up here. Had a few flurries over the holidays but still unbelievable. I'm sure we'll get our share before the winter is over. It's been a wierd year Heck we were catching walleye in 4-6 feet of water all day long in mid september. I won't even tell you how many we caught in one boat in one day. But the guys with me were laughing like school kids. The weather stayed so warm the whitefish didn't even start to spawn by October 1. The big walleye were having a hayday feeding on them. from mid september to mid october we were catching them in 8-12 feet near the islands in front of the big flat whitefish spawning bays. I haven't fished the bay of Quinte but have talked to people who have. I imagine the whitefish spawn has a lot to do with the great fishing late fall. lots of fun."

1150116,brown eyes,2009-11-25 00:04:00,4,"Hey, you do not need to go too far. If you are close to Selkirk, there are lots of walleyes there over 28 inches. I caught lots of them last month. You can see my post too. Anyway, I hope you find a good fly in fishing lodge."
1152853,Guest,2009-12-08 08:59:00,0,Nungesser Lake north of red lake ontario. I've fished over 300 lakes across Canada and it is the best walleye lake I've found.
1152891,SoulFulCry,2009-12-08 11:29:00,158,lol yeah u would say that kevin cause thats where ur lodge is n promoting ur lodge is good but red lake is far superior for fishin #s n bigger ones
1156720,Guest,2009-12-29 12:57:00,0,"That is true, I do own a lodge on Nungesser. That doesn't change the fact that Nungesser is the best walleye fishing I've found. I tell people all the time that there are better fly-in lakes for numbers of 35-40 inche PIKE but not for 46 -50 inchers. And of the 300 plus lakes that I've fished Nungesser is by far the best walleye lake for both numbers and size."

1156818,lobo1,2009-12-30 03:36:00,734,"I wouldnt trade my fly-in or remote drive-in trip(s) to the far north for anything - there are some big fish up there but that isn't all we look for in a trip. We can catch the big ones (eyes) right here at home......and more of them - than we can on any of our canada trips. I dont care where you go up north - you just aren't going to find the hogs you get down below - on a regular basis. I would agree with Ben and Bill that your real hog fish are going to come from the Great Lakes premium destinations where you can CPR numerous trophy fish on any given good day. I have had days here in Michigan where I have had to struggle to catch anything to bring home for the pan under 7-8 pounds. Lakers and brookies are another story - those hawgs they get way up north are hard to duplicate any place else on earth. I guess what I am saying is that if you are just looking for enormous walleyes you might have to look other places besides fly-ins at far north destinations. That all said...........would I love to go to GODSLAKE, or GUNNISAO or GREAT SLAVE or any of the others - YOU BET !!!!! I would live at Canadian fishing camps all soft water season long - if I could afford it!! lobo1"
1156820,IRISHATTACK,2009-12-30 05:40:00,44,"Good for you Geary, if you have a lake that has quality fish in it, I would talk it up also. What is wrong with saying a lake is good. A good, honest camp owner should tell you that there are trophy fish in it, if there really is. I do not hear or see anyone saying Nungesser does not. I have talked with many of owners who swear they have big fish and clearly do not. They just want your money."
1156834,Larry Mac,2009-12-30 08:04:00,530,"I have never fished Nungesser Lake personally but I have friends who fished the lake out of Anglers Kingdom this year (2009). They have fished Canadian lakes like me for many years and they said they have never caught the quantity and quality of walleye like that in their life. Their son's pictures are posted on their website holding some absolutely beautiful walleye (their name is Wulf). Nungesser Lake is on my bucket list of lakes to fish. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1156879,scotttheguide,2009-12-30 11:10:00,73,"By way of producing fish as a measurement how would anyone in general define a successfull fishing trip to Canada for trophy fish?I mean in a weeks time how many would someone expect to catch over 30"". I consider a Walleye over 30"" to be trophy class. I know myself and some of the guides I know on LOTW will put big numbers of Walleyes in the boat each week, and release them of course.In an average week (7N/6D Trip), Hundreds of 14-18""(eaters), Lots between 18-24"", and maybe 10-20 in the 24-28"" range. Always seem to get a couple each week 28-30"". In most cases my guests are not die hard fishermen, in fact some are complete novice, allot of father/son and families so I also have allot of bigger fish that snap the line or just get off. We also don't fish walleyes all day, we do some Bass fishing and some pike fishing. But they seem to catch allot of good Walleyes. I have been to some other Lakes and yes the fishing is good. I have not fished any Lakes in Ontario where the fishing was not good. But I have never been to a Lake where I caught an unbelievable number of 30"" fish in a week.Just wondering what defines a good trophy Lake in your opinions because I would rate LOTW on top of my list. There are some monster Walleyes in this Lake. I would probaly rate Rainy Lake and Eagle Lake as numbers 2 & 3. I just like the big lakes for big fish."

1149309,Bill Krejca,2009-11-20 19:28:00,6107,"Dust - Some conventional wisdom preaches that as you go farther north, i.e., some of the ""fly-in's"", the walleye average smaller due to cooler water and a shorter ""growing"" season. It may be that the numbers caught can be quite large while the size may not equal fish found in water farther south. Having not done a study, I don't know, so I can't debate the issue. The point being, that perhaps larger average fish are to be found south of many of the very good fly-in camps. Bill Krejca"

I have been to Elk Island lodge and God's River Lodge. God's River lodge is the best location with good equipment, meals and guides. We always go the tail end of May/begining of June and from God's river lodge, we head either to Little God's or the ""graveyard"" and nail big walleyes. Most of the time, husky jerks in firetiger or clown work great but my son caught 4 walleyes in one afternoon with each in excess of 10 pounds casting Lucky craft pointer lures. Jigs and twisters also work. The other thing cool about God's river lodge is you are right on the river and the brookies are big - in excess of 20"". They are also allowed to go to Siemons lake and in one morning, we had 17 northerns in excess of 44"". We are already booked for next spring."
