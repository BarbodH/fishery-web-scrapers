I repeat the process until the bag is full. I can usually get about 10 dozen in that size bag. Once full, put it in the freezer until the day before you are ready to use them. Once you take them out of the freezer for use, you really dont need to re-freeze them if you are going to use them for a few days in a row. With that much salt, they dont really go bad, they turn a little ""leathery"" but seem to work just as well as live minnows plus they last a lot longer on the jig."
1167969,Minnow Man,2010-02-10 20:04:00,85,"Minnesota Anglers Fined Posted by Mike Ebbeling on Wednesday, February 10th, 2010 am 8:15:00 AM Two Minnesota residents have been fined a total of $1,300 after attempting to smuggle live bait into Ontario at the Sand Point Lake Entry Station in Rainy River. Arthur XXXX and Thomas XXXXX were fined for transporting live minnows into Ontario for use of bait. The bait was seized and turned over to a Ministry of Natural Resources Conservation Officer. Read this article in the Dryden Paper, $1,300 would buy an awful lot of bait."
1167971,Mich_Fisherman,2010-02-10 20:30:00,292,"Yeah.....we live with that politcal crap between the US and Canada in our waterways. There have been fisherman that have bought minnows (on lake st clair), in Michigan and fished over the imaginary line ... Canadian border only to get fined for not fishing with Ontario minnows that have been ""certified"". Even though you could be fishing 10ft away back across the border. Fines for having minnows in the boat have been as high as $350. Too bad the 2 countries cant come to some sort of an agreement. Seems to me that the receipt that you get from the bait shop that already says ""Certified VHS Free"" should be good in either country. I guess that would be too simple and logical."

1168282,fishforlife,2010-02-11 22:11:00,77,"Excellent point Phish. Too many people think that you ""have to have live bait"" in Canada to catch walleyes, as I did until last year when all our nightcrawlers died the first day of our trip. We fished the whole week with Gulp & Gulp Alive and did as well as with crawlers or minnows. All depends on many factors including angling ability. Whatever the bait, I hope everyones goal is to enjoy the great places we go to and the memories we make each time we go. By the way Phish, I've gone bye mile marker 58 and have not seen you out there with your sign. ""Headin North"". 8 of us going back to Brace Lake out of Nakina the last week of August. Take Care !!!Good fishing,Rob"
1168339,stumcfar,2010-02-12 08:09:00,451,"I used to laugh a few years back, when crossing into Canada to fish Buffalo Bay on the Manitoba side of Lake of the Woods. They would always question if we had live minnows or not and the vehicle right ahead of us was the bait guy, supplying the minnows to the bait shop at Buffalo Bay. We couldn't bring in a dozen, but he could sell them gallons of the same Minnesota minnows! That has probably changed now."

1168465,v-bay gord,2010-02-12 16:55:00,3168,"Well, actually it's not. It's about the spread of disease and exotic species. While the regs may seem dumb when it involves border waters, there is no way to control where the bait goes once it crosses the border. Considering the hundreds of lakes that they may end up in, it is only common sense to have some restrictions."
1168543,Skywagon,2010-02-13 06:06:00,1106,"Crappie are starting to show up in the Wabigoon lake system. Did they come in from a minnow bucket, or some idiot that thought it would be cool to have them in the lake? We will never know, but either way they are not welcome. Just an example on what can happen, witnessed in my back yard. There are good reasons for the bait transportation laws."
1171460,Bigstorm,2010-02-23 16:50:00,799,"I usaually bring 15 or 20 dozen salted minnows with me. They dont have any problems with that at the border and in my opinion, it works just as well as live bait, plus they last longer on the jig"
1171500,Guest,2010-02-23 19:31:00,0,How do you salt your minnows?
