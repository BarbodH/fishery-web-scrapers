Compared to the various methods I had used for the first 30 years to store and transport home harvested fish, I believe the FoodSaver method works the best. Our fish are cleaned soon after harvest, individually vacuumed sealed in FoodSaver bags (8 inch X 22 foot roll) and then either frozen immediately or covered with ice (remote locations) where no freezing facilities exist. This method facilitates separating harvested fish between fishing partners after the trip and once home, there's nothing to do except put your fish in the freezer. I also believe fish stored via this method come the closest to the taste of eating fresh fish."

1172877,dabirdsman,2010-02-28 09:07:00,317,"I use my food saver for everything, but for fish I also have a different method. I put my fillets in a regular freezer bag and fill the bag with water, squeeze out all air and seal the bag, you'll never get freezer burn. I've never let my fish sit for a year and a half though."
1172889,aggie kolisnik,2010-02-28 09:52:00,39,"I use a similar method except I put the fillets(don.t rinse, just wipe with towel) in the bag and seal(take all the air out) and then a slightly larger bag is used to put the fish bagggie in and I fill that one with water. The fillets don't freezer burn and when time to thaw, I break the ice with a mallot or anything and they thaw in 10-15 minutes with no soggy fillets. I wash them just before I prepare them for eating. Our guests like this method for freshness."

Has saved us a ton of time at inspection stations, we've never been fined for bringing to little or unidentified fish back home, and we eat so much fish while in Canada it makes up for the ones we don't bring home."

1172937,JETSTER,2010-02-28 11:41:00,448,"Thats a good idea have to remember that,usually just put them in water."
1172949,5 of Diamonds,2010-02-28 12:13:00,151,Our groups have the same philosophy. Gosh we have some awesome Walleye meals when we're there!
1173036,Moondog,2010-02-28 16:34:00,362,"Have used all or parts of the above methods for years until we started fishing the Florida flats several years ago. No restrictions on bringing fish back to the U.S.A. so we could fill the freezer in the camper with as many fish as we thought prudent. Problem with vacuum packing is that it it bulky and takes up a lot of space with all the extra plastic. Also in the past I have had any number of fish trashed when the seal on the Food Saver bags leaks and then the fish is full of ice which really ruins the freshness and flavor. I suggest using Press n' Seal. This product is virtually foolproof if you use care. Fillet the fish and leave on the skin patch, wrap in Press n' Seal and take care to PRESS the air out and freeze flat. Then put frozen fish in marked freezer bags. Have done this the past 3 years in Canada and with zero freezer burn (just ate walleye last week from May '09) and no problems with inspection etc. Since we always get a conservation license the numbers don't amount to much but the process is easier and much cheaper than buying a Food Saver and their expensive bags. IMHO"
