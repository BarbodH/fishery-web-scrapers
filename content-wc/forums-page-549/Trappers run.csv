1173143,lionfan19,2010-02-28 22:23:00,41,I was here first week in june 2009. Water was way high due to dam being open upriver. Did not catch a Walleye untill third day of trip very slow. Had to pull pike out of the treetops due to the very high water. Motors at camp were junk two of them kept overheating. We are very serious fisherman and have been to quite a few other camps and done very well. Wish we had known about the possiblily of dam being open and would have not booked this location.

1173244,lionfan19,2010-03-01 10:09:00,41,Camp is on the Ogoki River maybe less than ten miles upriver from Ogoki lake. Its north of Nakina and one of quite a few camps that Twin Lakes outfitters runs.
