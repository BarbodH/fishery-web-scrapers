From there, my wife and the rest of our group will depart for home and I will squeeze in another week with just my boys. My only problem is I haven't yet figured out what to do with my boat. I won't need it at SWW and I really don't want to trailer it from Dyrden down the logging roads to SWW. Maybe I can find someplace to leave it in Dyrden until I pass back thru on my way to Red Lake.? Thanks everyone for all the good info."
1172515,MikeMcC,2010-02-26 20:48:00,72,I'm lucky enough to be planning a two week fishing trip for early August. The first week is all set for Lac Suel. The second week I am leaning towards Red Lake. How does Red Lake compare to other lakes in the area? We will mostly be targeting walleye using my own boat. I will be fishing with my two young boys and plan to stay at a housekeeping only cabin. Being close to a small town is appealing with kids if they need a break from fishing. Both Howie Bay and Sunset Lodge look like good values on Red Lake. Any thoughts or suggestions on this or differnt locations would be appreciated.
1172521,tackleman,2010-02-26 21:16:00,444,"you will not be disappointed in Red Lake, it is a world class fishery.The walleye are everywhere and are usually about 15 to 25 feet deep at that time. It is a big lake but any campowner will be glad to mark spots for you and even though I haven't stayed at any of the camps mentioned, I know both the owners and they are both good people. Howey Bay camp is right down town and sunset lodge is about 5 km from town. Both are well run and clean.August is a great month, the water is warm and the fish are active."
1172524,MikeMcC,2010-02-26 21:31:00,72,"Tackleman, thanks for the info regarding Red Lake. Is there any compelling reason to boat into any of the other adjoining lakes. Are there any ""must see"" tourist stops to make in the area. Do you have a favorite restaurant. Sorry for all the questions but I am already getting excited and it's only Feb."
1172529,eyemike,2010-02-26 21:55:00,233,Have you looked at GullRock Lake just south of Red Lake? It joins Red Lake by the Chakuni River. It is a five lake chain with four or five good resorts and excellent fishing. Quite a bit smaller than Red and alot easier to learn quickly. I know a few people that go to GullRock and it is one dandy lake. There is alot of posts on this website about GullRock I woud check it out. Mike...
1172582,Guest,2010-02-27 06:49:00,0,"My pick would be Howie Bay camp it has the best location, it is centrally located so you can fish the west or east ends of Red Lake and only a couple miles up river from Keg Lake which can be really good fishing in Aug."
1172639,SoulFulCry,2010-02-27 12:34:00,158,red lake in august is amazin fishing with all the 5 interlinking lakes havin there populations of fish n good ones as tackle man said any depth fr 12 in shallow ends to as deep as 40 in the clearer western sections i have fished this lake all my life n u wont be disappointed as for accomodations withthe boys welll howey bay is good so is sunset island vacation retreat is a lil way out of the way but close to all the major beaches that ya can bring ur boat to n do what ever water activities but i guess for all around howey bay is best with all the town n buisnesses close by hope ya have a great holiday n hope ya get that wall hanger

1172701,tackleman,2010-02-27 18:13:00,444,"as you can see from my profile, I live on Gullrock and it is all part of the red lake system, to run from red lake to gullrock is about a 30 minute run, depending on the size of motor you have, fish in the river from red to keg lake, fish keg lake, fish the river again as it leaves keg to gullrock then into gullrock for more fabulous fishing, from gullrock you can go back into the river and down to 2 island lake(but i've never fished there). or you could go across gullrock to the north end up a creek and into ranger lake.All these waters are full of fish, if you come to gullrock, you will see the boats more concentrated in areas than you would on red lake, this is because a lot of the camps on gullrock have several parties that like to fish together. If you plan to fish gullrock, just head to where the boats are concentrated and fish that area. if you have a depth finder you will be able to see the drop offs and just fish them. Don't be afraid to join the boats either, the fishing areas are quite big and in the 20 years I've lived on the lake, I have only had 1 guy complain that I was in HIS spot. Most just ask you how you are doing and let it go at that.Red Lake has great fishing and if you REALLY want to fish other lakes, just go down the river as mentioned above."
1172727,freespoolin,2010-02-27 19:57:00,472,"Been fishing Red/Keg for 14 yearsand have always stayed at Sunset Lodge, Rene and Adele at Sunset are great people. The Red Lake/Keg/Gullrock system is a great fishery from May to September. Rene will tell you where his guests have been catching fish. Take his advice."
