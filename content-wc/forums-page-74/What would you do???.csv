6573260,26IsoLead,2021-06-25 18:55:00,22,"sent you a pm with details, 50 years HS NEO, 8 different schools"
6573270,Eckohlt,2021-06-25 19:23:00,3685,Got it
6572888,SweetD,2021-06-24 21:19:00,243,"Just me but I’m 100% in on my Canada trip in September. If it doesn’t happen I’m not settling for something less South of the border. Did that last Summer and not close to the fishing or experience we desire. Again, Canada or bust for us. I get trying to get something in but would rather sit it out and wait til next year if can’t go North to Ontario!Good luck to everyone no matter where you land!"
6572908,Eckohlt,2021-06-25 03:25:00,3685,"I'm going to land the same side of the border your going land,I have zero interest south of I-falls"
6573106,26IsoLead,2021-06-25 11:43:00,22,"No border to cross, fishing and ambiance as good or better"
6573132,SweetD,2021-06-25 12:24:00,243,"And you forgot zero walleye! Not that I would be opposed but costs seem much higher and no desire to stand side by side with others and fish. I also don’t love being guided. Our preference is to be self sufficient at an outpost far away from others and catch,cook and gorge ourselves on fresh walleye that we caught. Sorta a walleye snob I guess &#x1f60e;"
6573136,26IsoLead,2021-06-25 12:37:00,22,"I get all the walleye I want 30 minutes from home, casting, jigging or trolling"
6573154,fishingMN4eyes,2021-06-25 13:37:00,108,"Congrats, not everyone is that fortunate. Love the gorgeous shoreline scenery behind you as well......"
6573160,Eckohlt,2021-06-25 14:06:00,3685,"The back ground in the pic is what I try to get away from,other than that that's a dandy fish"
6573232,Wallychowder,2021-06-25 17:40:00,1567,I hope you didn't eat that one ?
6573244,26IsoLead,2021-06-25 18:21:00,22,"That was the week of the NFL draft with 47 degree water, the guy in the photo is an ex-player of mine Bill O'Hara"
6573246,Eckohlt,2021-06-25 18:27:00,3685,We're you a football coach?and if so what team?
6572470,drew59,2021-06-23 19:52:00,87,No. Poor wording on my part. My wife and I are fully vaccinated and staying hopeful for being at VBL in August. We aren't giving up until our dates are ruled out. Two years is too long.
6572486,v-bay gord,2021-06-23 20:29:00,3168,"I agree. Cabins are ready to go, the fish are too. I'm looking for positive announcements in the coming weeks."
6572594,emma17,2021-06-24 08:44:00,436,Tough call NARDA. I respect you're trying to do the right thing for the US lodge owner. IMO it seems the best you can do is ask the US lodge owner if you can be pencilled in for your reservation and request they call you should they receive a legitimate reservation request for your time slot. At that point you'd have to make your final decision.
6572596,NARDA 1,2021-06-24 08:50:00,636,That is exactly what has been done.
6572636,fishingMN4eyes,2021-06-24 10:13:00,108,You said that all last year too. Please tell us more....
6572638,prov1800,2021-06-24 10:18:00,5010,Hope Canada happens Narda. You guys been coming a lot of years and nothing wi be the same in Mn.More than likely a zoo.
6572640,Eckohlt,2021-06-24 10:21:00,3685,What more can I say?all's I can say I'm booked a few times in late fall and I'm thinking positive about being able to go.
6572642,prov1800,2021-06-24 10:41:00,5010,All you can do Rod.Anything can happen.
6572704,NARDA 1,2021-06-24 13:22:00,636,"The MN Lodge is great, but like you said "" It's not the same"" I hope it happens. The problem is I can't wait until the last minute to cancel the MN trip. That wouldn't be the right thing to do. So I hope a plan is worked out in the next week or 2."
6572710,Eckohlt,2021-06-24 13:53:00,3685,We are way way overdue for something good to happen john
6572386,RichA$1970,2021-06-23 14:24:00,1159,I’m not sure but going to ride with Eck on this one. My resort is open so I’m optimistic for September.
6572396,prov1800,2021-06-23 15:12:00,5010,Worst case scenario Rod is ice fishing
6572400,Wallychowder,2021-06-23 15:23:00,1567,I keep telling him to take your auger !!!
6572408,BreezyPoint,2021-06-23 17:03:00,1581,"I am curious as to how you all estimate cost to reopen'? Maybe it's big for some people, but the place I have booked say they will be ready within 48 hours. Frank"
6572426,Eckohlt,2021-06-23 17:44:00,3685,I'm going to take my auger in sept and stop by prov1800 house and give it to him.
6572434,1shooter,2021-06-23 18:00:00,1493,I am optimistic but at what point is it worth the Canadian resort owners to open
6572448,NARDA 1,2021-06-23 18:35:00,636,"The Canada Lodge is up and running to an extent as we speak. I have spoken with the MN Lodge owner and he knows the situation and is holding a cabin for us, I just don't want to keep him on hold. I want to give him enough time to rent the cabin out if we don't take it. We would rather go to Canada but it's such a crap shoot with them doing 30 days at a time. I just don't see why they can't lay out a plan so lodges and customers can make a reasonable decision."
6572450,drew59,2021-06-23 18:52:00,87,Gord: Fully vaccinated and staying hopeful!
6572454,v-bay gord,2021-06-23 18:55:00,3168,"Ah, welcome back Breezy Point."
6572456,v-bay gord,2021-06-23 18:56:00,3168,"Is that me? If so, yes I am, and yes I am hopeful."
6572298,NARDA 1,2021-06-23 10:09:00,636,My group has our Canada trip planned for Sept. 8th. Do you think it has a chance or should we go with Plan B. For our plan B we have a tentative reservation at a lodge in MN.
6572316,Da' Walleye Assassun,2021-06-23 10:56:00,358,Can you explain the situation to the Minnesota lodge owner and try to work something out?
6572318,Mr. Sauger,2021-06-23 10:57:00,285,"If you have to make a call soon, I think Plan B is a much safer bet. My thinking is based on speculation, assumption, and mind-reading. ROI on short season - How long of a season will the resort owner need to make it worthwhile to open up? In other words, how many weeks of full resort revenues will it take to payback the expense of opening up the camp. Lead time? -How long will it take to get the resort in shape once the surprise announcement is made opening up the boarder (recruiting and rehiring staff, materials, other services etc.) Wild azz assumptions: - Resort needs 2 full months (8 weeks) of full cabins to recoup this season's ramp-up expense. - It will take 2-4 weeks from the time open-boarder date is announced until resort can be occupied (and that may be optimistic) (call it 3 weeks)Bad news math:Including your Sept. 8-14 trip minus 11 weeks is June 30. Canadian and Provincial authorities have one week from today to fully open up the boarder. Hate to be the Debbie Downer, but it ain't gunna happen"
6572334,Bergy,2021-06-23 11:42:00,83,Go to Plan B. Sure thing and you get your trip.
6572338,v-bay gord,2021-06-23 11:53:00,3168,"I would wait a few weeks before cancelling ""A"". I'm thinking there is a chance for August / September. For lodge owners that actually live at their lodges, opening for a shorter season would still make sense."
6572344,bigwalleye1,2021-06-23 11:58:00,2632,"What's your drop dead date on your MN reservation? That's gonna be the decision maker. If you are at the drop dead cancel date, evaluate the chances of a Canada open and then make your go/no go decision. That's about all you can do."
6572350,bbheli,2021-06-23 12:14:00,1387,"I doubt that anyone is opening. Seems Canada and US are a long way away and now the Delta strain is stirring everything up and Canada is very tough on this issue so why would they go backwards when they don't have it where they want it. Also, the camps are probably not ready and help everywhere is hard to find and the cost to open for a few short months would just not seem worthwhile. Congrats to anyone that gets in if I am wrong but as for me I would plan a sure thing if your time frame to get away is limited by family, vacation and work scheduled and so on."
6572354,Wallychowder,2021-06-23 12:24:00,1567,"July 15th,16th,17th,18th rolls around and BOOM ! Sorry Folk's wallyworld closed until August 21st !!!!!"
6572356,emma17,2021-06-23 12:31:00,436,Agree w V-Bay. Is your lodge owner at the camp already? Do they say they'll be ready to go as soon as opening is announced?
6572382,Eckohlt,2021-06-23 14:14:00,3685,"I've said all along be ready to saddle up for the fall,for sure sept n oct."
