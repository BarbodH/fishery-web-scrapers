I can attest to the fantastic operation Luenbergers is. Both pilots we dealt with were top notch in loading, unloading, flying and just being personal. The weigh in went flawless and no issues in any way at all. As ALWAYS, Chad and Dawn were incredible!! Chad was not able to get into Aba this spring to fill the 3 ice houses....NO issues. We were given several blocks of ice to help in camp. Also, camp 3 now has a full sixe propane fridge as well as the smaller 1 in the 2nd cabin. These 2 fridges are more than enough for food, beer, etc. Camp 3 also had a large, brand new bbq. Fishing.....We were in last Aug, instead of June in 2020 and of couse a late summer fish is different than our typical spring, post spawn fish. So we were anxious to see if there was any difference this June seeing there has been so little fishing pressure. I can easily say, the #s of fish per boat, per day, was no different from all our other yrs. But 1 big difference was the consistency of fish in the 19-21"" size range being caught in 5-10ft and sometimes in 10-18ft of water. Water temp hovered in around 65F in those depths for the week. Kudos to TLO and their new relationship with Luenbergers!! Of course as a group, you get used to who flies you in. Nakina Air has always been a fantastic safe way to fly. Luenbergers matched them in all ways. I can attest to this if anyone has any worries. Our next trip back is late Aug, prob back into Aba again Cheers"

But I am happy that Chad and Dawn are doing OK and that you had a wonderful trip. We always stayed in Aba 2 and I think about it almost every day. Again, so glad to hear the world up there is well."

6573500,gmattbruin,2021-06-26 15:57:00,174,"Hey, no nothing we would consider large in size for either pike or eyes. Biggest walleye was 24"" and the biggest pike was only 31"" But like i mentioned above , the amount of healthy, fat, 19-22 was way more than normal. None in the group really targeted large pike in our shortened 5day trip. Usually we are in for 7, but it didnt happen this yr Cheers"
6573786,NM_Trout,2021-06-27 18:13:00,1094,What about lake trout? Any sign?
6573832,Fishquest,2021-06-28 04:40:00,89,"Sounds like a fun time was had, Thanks for the report."
6573884,gmattbruin,2021-06-28 06:59:00,174,"Hey, my son spent some time targeting them but no luck. We seem to have found, we get them usually by chance while working for walleye in shallower during tht time of yr. There is 2 deep spots on the lake and none of us have ever had any luck marking them or catching them with laker tactics. So maybe they are in transition during the 1st couple weeks of June? Idk"
6573898,gordy28,2021-06-28 07:28:00,437,Thanks for sharing Glenn Sounds like a great trip. You have put Aba square in my groups cross hairs for 2022 Cheers Andrew
