6571672,stumcfar,2021-06-21 10:01:00,451,"Talked to 2 Ontario outfitters this weekend. They are both going to make it through this mess, one because they are lucky enough to rent cabins to construction workers (less income, but still something) and the others because they do logging in the winter and also sell bait. They both told me they know there will be a lot of camps that don't make it. One story told was of a young couple that sold their home and went all in on a camp and now stand to lose everything. I don't want to be told stories of how ""the majority of Canadians"" don't want us coming into their country. Get out of the big cities and ask these people what they think and feel. They are unhappy with their premiere and miss the heck out of all their American friends and guests. Hopefully next year will be more normal and camps that don't survive will eventually be reopened by new owners. One has to feel bad for the ones that go broke until normalcy takes over again though."

6570842,Cgillespie,2021-06-18 10:13:00,120,"I had one scheduled to Cat Island Lodge on Trout Lake for same dates. I postponed to 7/24-7/31, but that's not looking likely either. I'm seriously starting to wonder if it will be reopened in 2022. I can get on a plane and fly to most places in Europe, but I can't drive my truck to Canada."

6570904,Cgillespie,2021-06-18 12:12:00,120,"I'd write a letter, but since he doesn't listen to his own citizens, I doubt he would listen to a lowly American. Also, what is the deal with the weird symbols when I post something?"

6571218,Wawajake,2021-06-19 15:57:00,413,"Three or four of us Canadians did our best to explain how the rumours of a June opening was ridiculous, but we were dissed ( and dusted) for sharing our reality, and our knowledge of the political landscape these decisions are being made in."
6571230,rather-be-fishin,2021-06-19 16:11:00,429,Wawajake I was being realistic & was very doubtful all along of the border opening. This is something that cannot be rushed. I am ready & waiting for when the border does open this Summer/Fall Or next! üëç‚ù§Ô∏èüé£üá®üá¶ RBF
6571232,Wallychowder,2021-06-19 16:16:00,1567,"Well wawa, I'm not Canadian, but i say it's not opening till January 22 !"
6571242,Slim03,2021-06-19 16:55:00,159,At this point I‚Äôm not sure how late it will be. It my speculation is it will be late enough that the tourism season will be almost over so that many camp owners cannot financially open due to the costs that are incurred and not being able to be profitable. I would never hold it against a camp owner if they have to make that decision either to be in business the next year. By forcing the late opening then declines the amount of people crossing the border which then allows them to see how well they can handle the situation and keep it controlled. I think it‚Äôs all a crock of at this point but is what it is. A little more than 4 days notice would be great so we can continue to plan alternatives.
