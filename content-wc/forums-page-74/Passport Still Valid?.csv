So a couple of weeks ago I went online and filled out all the info to get it renewed. The next day I received a notice saying it was approved and within a week I received my new card in the mail, couldn't have been easier. For crossing the US & Canadian border it's the best thing since sliced bread, many crossings have express lanes for folks who are part of the Program. Only issue is if someone in the vehicle doesn't have a card you can't use the express lanes. Have had more than one Border Agent say to me you should get all the guys in the vehicle to get a card then you wouldn't have to wait in these long lines. It's also nice to have at the airport, when going through security many airports have a separate line if you are a member of the program and it's much shorter and quicker. Donscs"

6568080,pjshorthorn,2021-06-09 11:44:00,5654,To Bill's point.....how about your outdoors card and fishing license ? I'm going to have to get both of them if the border were to open. I know exactly where my fishing gear is though....LOL. PjShorthorn

I have been dealing with another situation through an agency in Washington, DC that has been frustrating to no end. We are about 9 month in on this issue that should have taken about 4-6 weeks for approval. Some of those federal folks need a swift kick in the pants Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6568352,CI_Guy,2021-06-10 07:48:00,2118,It's never been a problem going to Canada but there are several Asian and European countries that will not let you in if your passport is within 6 months of expiring.
