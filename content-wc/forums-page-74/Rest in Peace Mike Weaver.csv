6571384,[emailÂ protected],2021-06-20 08:18:00,18,Mike Weaver passed away this past week. He and Gerri owned Weaver's Wilderness Camp on Gull Rock for many years. Mike was genuine in all regards. He had an infectious smile and he always seemed happy in what he was doing. Thank you Mike and Gerri for many great years. Mike will be sorely missed.
6571704,Pat T,2021-06-21 10:59:00,221,I just heard this yesterday and totally agree what a great guy he was. Was fortunate to get to see him and Geri a few years ago when they made a trip back to their camp (now Wrights Wilderness Camp). My sympathy to Geri and any other family members who are left to morn his loss. RIP Mike. Howard Pattee

Mike and Gerri ran a great camp and were both great people! I have very fond memories of Mike Weaver and wish to extend my deepest sympathies to Gerri. Rest in Peace Mike Weaver, you deserve an eternal peace!"
