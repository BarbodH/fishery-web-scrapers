The younger guys on our fall trip have been great about getting an evening fire going. We all sit around, the younger ones drinking beer, the older ones bourbon. It's one of the things we look forward to on our late season trips. Warm on the front, cold on the back. My buddy and I get there a little late. We fish a nearby shoreline that's good for walleye and jumbo rock bass after dark. Sure hope we can build on that tradition this fall."
6570180,gordy28,2021-06-16 05:37:00,437,Some great ones in here. Love the idea of happy hour on the dock and lunch on a beach! Added to the things to try list for sure Fishron I love the fires as well especially on those cool nights. I love going to the family cottage in October. Freeze during the day fishing but warm up at night at the campfire w a drink. Nothing better Cheers Andrew
