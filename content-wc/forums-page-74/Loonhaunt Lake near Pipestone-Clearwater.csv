4702986,skirkpat,2016-04-04 10:45:00,12,"Usually fish on Lake of the Woods out of Nestor falls. But flying in to Loonhaunt for 3 days the last week of July (yes, already counting the days!)I've never been to Loonhaunt. Can any of you experienced folks give me some advice? I usually jig for walleyes with jig an live minnow. Anybody care to share summer spots on Loonhaunt or strategies that work?Also, love to cast for pike or smallies. Same question on those? Anybody use tubes/jig for this?Finally, I read that there are some nice Lakers in Loonhaunt? Never fished for them but sounds like fun. Just find deepest part of lake, drop tube or silver spoon to bottom, and reel up 10 feet? Then drop a little, and reel up another 10-20 feet? Until all the way up to the boat? I'm not into trolling for Lakers, don't have the equipment to get deep enough I dont think.If you just want to share general experiences on Loonhaunt that would be good too (or heck, even LOW sabaskong bay area!) Just excited to wet a line up north this summer!Good luck and Best fishing to all!ps. 100% catch and release with exception of a couple shore lunch walleyes"
