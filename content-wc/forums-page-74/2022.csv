6570582,Canadian fisher,2021-06-17 13:11:00,97,"But Fisherman Ted said its 100% opening on the 22nd, he had the inside scoop and told every lodge owner to start hiring staff and get ready for end of June. How could it not be opening in 5 days? Millions of people still waiting to get fully vaccinated, still no indoor visitors allowed or even indoor dining. I mean obviously he is privy to highly sensitive information that only Canadian government officials and Ted would know since he's an American lodge owner in Canada and voted for people to represent him Supposed to be an announcement on Monday about the re-opening plan. I sure hope my American neighbours are allowed up here soon to come enjoy their second home that they have been kept away from for the second summer in a row. Miss having them around for some beers and BS."
6570798,Billswest,2021-06-18 08:34:00,32,"Got the word last week that the trip I booked in September,2019 for 8 of us to fly into Chase Lake (N of Kenora,Ontario) in June,2020 was cancelled again. We were rescheduled to June,2022. Disappointed, for sure, but also sympathize with our outfitter and the hit his business is taking again. Also a disappointing sell to my grandkids who are tired of hearing all of Gramps stories about fishing Chase in the past and are crawling out of their skin to get up there and try their luck themselves. Life's lessons are hard in a lot of ways......."
6570892,ackermannsacre,2021-06-18 12:01:00,196,Got a message from Gullrock Lake Lodge that the border is closed until at least July 21st...
6572160,Prairieboy43,2021-06-22 18:42:00,38,"Wow. I had expected the border be open by now. Guess I'll be heading west this summer again to Skeena River for Steelhead, Coho. Enjoy my east trips to Kenora, Lake of the woods, Sioux Narrows. Never fished smallmouth before, however it's fun. Those little fish like the warm water. Put up scrappy fight. Managed to catch couple 5-6lb smallmouth last time in Souix Narrows. Relaxing place to fish in hard rock country. Good luck to all this summer. PB43"
6572332,Jesse-WI,2021-06-23 11:37:00,534,well it comes down to what the science says...........https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news...ome-pm-trudeau
6572384,Eckohlt,2021-06-23 14:16:00,3685,Should come down to what the fisherman say
6570240,That Minnesota guy,2021-06-16 08:15:00,8293,And it's a good one!
6570262,Eckohlt,2021-06-16 08:58:00,3685,We'll cross that bridge when we get to it
6570338,kzoofisher,2021-06-16 14:59:00,5144,"New public bridge going up between Windsor and Detroit. The owners of the private Ambassador bridge fought it long, hard and in court. See, their bridge kinda has a monopoly on truck traffic. They managed to get all funding from the US blocked and the bridge looked like it wouldn't happen even though the Canadians had already appropriated $550 million for it. The Michigan Senate turned the money down! Eventually the project got approved and the Gordie Howe Bridge became more than a pipe dream. Construction has started and soon there will be traffic from freeway to freeway in both countries. I think every border crossing should have one route that lets you bypass the town. Give the city streets a break from those just passing through."
6570362,That Minnesota guy,2021-06-16 15:48:00,8293,Thats a nice thought but the local economy is built on that traffic going right through town to the bridge.
6570420,RichA$1970,2021-06-16 19:05:00,1159,"Well maybe I missed it, but halfway past the week and I have not seen the big announcement that was brewing on WC. Hopefully tomorrow or Friday there’s some news or just another month down the drain."
6570442,prov1800,2021-06-16 21:00:00,5010,We all know the answer Rich
6570444,Slim03,2021-06-16 21:08:00,159,Yep another delay with no answers or direction.
6570460,kzoofisher,2021-06-17 03:56:00,5144,"Meh, I've always figured that those who are going to stop for supplies are going to stop anyway and it will be easier and quicker for them if the ones breezing through take another route."
6570472,Eckohlt,2021-06-17 06:03:00,3685,"I- falls is a nice little town to go through to the border,the people a nice n friendly there,but I can't speak about that Minnesota guy haven't met him yet,I'm sure he's a good guy also"
6570476,That Minnesota guy,2021-06-17 06:10:00,8293,"No he isn't, you don't want to meet him."
6569984,That Minnesota guy,2021-06-15 11:24:00,8293,The bridge currently is for sale if you would rather invest in it then GameStop.
6569988,Eckohlt,2021-06-15 11:33:00,3685,"Naaaaaaa,I think I'm going to buy a turbo otter,not the four legged creature,then I can fly under the radar to cross,camo color"
6569994,That Minnesota guy,2021-06-15 11:47:00,8293,"Seriously, it's for sale. It was in the local paper a month ago."
6569996,Eckohlt,2021-06-15 12:00:00,3685,"Maybe I'll make a low ball offer this fall,first I want to cross it to make sure it's sturdy,if I buy it only WC members can use it,FREE,that Justin guy he will be banned for life from using it"
6570138,v-bay gord,2021-06-15 20:38:00,3168,"Would it not make sense for both governments to co-own the bridge? After all taxpayer dollars have paid for the highway on both sides of it. To let the crooks who currently own it charge a toll all these years has been a disgrace. What if a private person bought it and decided to plant flowers across it and close it to traffic?I hate the toll bridge.......by the way I have ""run"" the bridge twice without paying the toll, with great satisfaction. My wife has forbidden me to do that anymore.....we'll see."
6570144,Slim03,2021-06-15 20:49:00,159,With the way they are acting about the border if I was to own it privately I would close it and plant flowers across it just to prove a point due to the loss in revenue. Would seem like a fair move since they don’t seem to care much about lodge owners. I would still let fellow fisherman across like others suggested but the rest may just have to take the long way around.
6570186,Obabikon,2021-06-16 05:58:00,2370,"At the very leastâ¦ We are going to get all of August and the fall to those who have been vaccinated. I'm incredibly confident of that. What we need is all of July also, and that is not looking good"
6570194,Wallychowder,2021-06-16 06:07:00,1567,"The crooks probably want to sell because they're not making any money with just Limited crossing ! If they were smart they'd hang on to it , and when they do open the border (to fishermen) they could charge a ridiculous toll amount !!! $100 cars and pickups. Pickups pulling boats $125.!!!!!!!&#x1f923;&#x1f914;"
6570208,That Minnesota guy,2021-06-16 06:55:00,8293,No they couldn't because their bridge starts and ends with government streets. Any gouging and the governments close down the streets and you have a walking bridge. There also was some talk of a new crossing thats government owned. The problem there would be getting the two governments to work together.
6570238,v-bay gord,2021-06-16 08:12:00,3168,"I think they are already gouging. Why do they only accept cash....US $.? Why are you not able to buy the ""card"" at the toll booth? Why is the card only good for one year.? (back in the day you could buy a card which had a number of crossings, which had no expiry date) No credit cards accepted. If they want to run it as a business then make it convenient for the customer. If you show up at the booth with only a credit card you are told to go back to the US and find a cash machine. It's all bullsh@t! That's my rant for the day..."
6569658,Bill Krejca,2021-06-14 06:54:00,6107,"A long time ago, for work related reasons, my trip to LOW didn't start until mid Oct, Oct 16, to be exact. Plans on staying in a cabin were changed, so we opted to camp out. Knowing the owner and manager of Turtle Portage Camp, we were allowed to camp on their deserted grounds, which made access to the outdoor privy very appreciated. The road trip got underway in a snow storm, my '66 Pontiac Bonneville, pulling my Thompson boat, got stuck in a Cloquet gas station, but we finally got back on the road and finally ran out of the snow. Camping out on the lake was cold, luckily, no more snow for the week. Fishing was not as good as it would have been earlier, at that time, I hadn't gotten down my understanding of how to seasonally adapt my catching techniques. Tree coloration was beautiful, the yellows along the shore were spectacularly gorgeous. Lots of fun, cold every day, I still remember bringing the same ice back which I started with in my small cooler. So later fishing can be done. Bill"
6569934,RichA$1970,2021-06-15 07:58:00,1159,"Friday it opens for some lucky Americans in Las Vegas who get to go to Montreal for playtime, must be nice."
6569940,That Minnesota guy,2021-06-15 08:21:00,8293,"Oh, you mean kinda like after 911 in New York when baseball resumed. Yes sports pays a part in helping people forget their troubles. Don't forget Hockey is just as important to Canadians (maybe moreso) as football is to Americans."
6569950,maddogg,2021-06-15 08:45:00,178,Like fishing doesn't?
6569958,RichA$1970,2021-06-15 09:43:00,1159,Just saying making exceptions for something non essential (the world will continue without a game as it has without fishing). If it’s ok to let vaccinated sports teams in then why not apply the same rules to vaccinated tourists? They also will generate $$$$ so what makes them so essential is the question?
6569964,rockpt,2021-06-15 10:03:00,589,"I’ve taken about 12 October trips to LOTW. Fishing can be fantastic, but come prepared for everything from Indian summer to snowstorms. I was at an island camp during the October 2006 snowstorm and we couldn’t cross to go home for three days due to the weather."

6569974,kzoofisher,2021-06-15 10:33:00,5144,"Should let tourists across just like hockey teams, 23 people at a time and the next group goes after the first group comes back. That'll work great!"
6569980,Eckohlt,2021-06-15 11:03:00,3685,"If only WC members ran the border,the old saying,we would be in like flint,months ago"

6569516,Slim03,2021-06-13 16:52:00,159,Is it time to start a 2022 thread yet? Got the call today saying not looking good for the couple trips I have booked that were already missed last year.
6569522,Eckohlt,2021-06-13 16:55:00,3685,"You can start a thread for 2022,but I'll be doing Ontario trips in 2021"
6569524,That Minnesota guy,2021-06-13 17:07:00,8293,Stay positive.
6569532,Slim03,2021-06-13 17:20:00,159,Oh I was trying to and thinking we would get across. I still think it’s possible but going to be later than I wanted. Looking at booking into September now. Frustrating to see this going on and what lodge owners are having to deal with as well as those of us trying to get up safely to go fishing.
6569534,Eckohlt,2021-06-13 17:28:00,3685,"Sept can be a great time of year in Ontario,but bring clothes for every type of weather under the sun"
6569536,Eckohlt,2021-06-13 17:29:00,3685,I'm keepin the faith mn guy
6569544,Wallychowder,2021-06-13 17:50:00,1567,"As soon as That Minnesota Guy lets us know that the traffic in Ifalls has picked up and that there's a waiting line outside the Chocolate Moose, We'll know it's a go ?..............Lol.Lol."
6569552,That Minnesota guy,2021-06-13 18:04:00,8293,You will be able to Trick or Treat at the same time.
6569554,Eckohlt,2021-06-13 18:05:00,3685,"Lol we will let Minnesota guy be the eye in sky for us,mn guy keep us posted on the traffic there heading north"
