Fished early which us best on the chain and we were done and boat loaded by noon.Had 5-6 dozen minnows and used them up in the 2 1/2 hrs we fished.Excellent day on a excellent lake and nice to see new scenery."

Wind was also blowing away. Had to use a camp, console boat, no tillers at camp to rent With temps and wind very slow fishing ,did a lot of drift jigging with minnows and leeches. Ended up with 8 walleye on leech,9 northern ,some perch and a rock bass Did hire a guide on Tuesday, he took us to Lake Winnibigosh,got our limits of small walleyes 12 for 2 of us some pike and perch. Very good guide, Lyle Unger Had a very good week despite the weather fishing, But Its Not Canada. Again Love Your Posts keep them Coming Larry Schroeder, Henderson Nevada"
