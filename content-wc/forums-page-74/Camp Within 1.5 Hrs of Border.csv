6572552,Wallychowder,2021-06-24 05:47:00,1567,I just tried sending you a PM. same thing here it wouldn't go through. I would call up to Tinker's and talk to Kari or Dallas
6572604,1shooter,2021-06-24 09:16:00,1493,this is where you want to go. launch your boat and short boat ride and you are on the island. Been fishing this area for almost 20 years and have never had any issues with my truck and trailer at the landing. As far as the camp the owner is top notch as well as his staff and family. Oh yea the fishing is fantastic.http://obabikon.com

6572246,JDP,2021-06-23 07:52:00,1457,Bergy your PMs are full.
6572278,Wallychowder,2021-06-23 09:01:00,1567,Let's try this again ! VIC&DOTS camp just north of Nestorfalls.
6572312,Orange crush Pamper guy,2021-06-23 10:44:00,6,Vermillion Bay lodge. Just west of Dryden. We love that place and the fishing is great literally 1/4 mile from the camp. Gord and his wife will take care of you and make sure you are having a great time.
6572326,Bergy,2021-06-23 11:08:00,83,I cleaned up the inbox. Vic and Dots is not near spots for Walleye fishing per the owner. I spoke to Gord and they are full. It’s difficult finding something.
6572360,Wallychowder,2021-06-23 12:33:00,1567,Call Tinkers ! Dallas will put you on the walleyes
6572392,Bergy,2021-06-23 14:52:00,83,Can you tell me more about Tinkers? Cabins nice? Docks nice? Docks protected from the wind? How far to travel on water to decent Walleye spots? Anything else you can share?Thanks - appreciate the insight.
6572394,Wallychowder,2021-06-23 15:02:00,1567,"cabins beautiful, protected dock, friday night fish fry delicious, like i tell people, you can catch walleye right off the dock, or you can travel out to miles bay, or anywhere in between."
6572442,Guest,2021-06-23 18:15:00,0,Try Evergreen Lodge on Eagle Lake .Clean cabins and docks protected from wind.
6572546,Bergy,2021-06-24 05:37:00,83,Walleyechowder - Can we touch base by phone to visit about your experience in the LOTW’s area? I tried you sending you a pm but it would not go thru.
6568322,Bergy,2021-06-10 06:00:00,83,"Our group has decided to try and plan a trip to Canada in July 2022. The group wants to stay within 1.5 hours of the border of Minnesota and Ontario. I have looked at the Northwest Arm of Rainy Lake, the Seine Bay/Red Gut Bay Area of Rainy Lake and also looking at the Morson/Nester Falls area of LOTW. Any suggestions on where to stay on LOTW? Or other Lakes? These are the things we are looking for:Mainly target WalleyesGood mapping of the lake and hazards - detailed chip preferred Protected docks from the wind Good road to the resort - not much gravel if any. Fishing close by on the water Good clean campThanks for any assistance."
6568392,Bill Krejca,2021-06-10 08:50:00,6107,"Sort of reminded me of the old saying of manufacturing/procuring a new product: Good, Fast, Cheap - pick any two! That said, and hopefully of more help to you, the Morson area can be a fun place, a number of resorts, and pretty good fishing. A larger boat is useful as wind can be a factor. Eight miles to the north of Morson, is Obabikon Bay Camp (Obabikon), a neat place, with lots of nearby fishing, and gorgeous scenery, well run, great owner. Bill"
6568438,jambi,2021-06-10 10:12:00,504,Young's Wilderness Camp on LOTW at Nestor Falls. Checks all your boxes. Did 10 trips with my Dad here before I changed to flyouts after he died. I'll be going back in the future.
6568442,Hawker,2021-06-10 10:17:00,3967,"Indeed, if the border opens, a double thumbs up for Young's Wilderness Camp. As Jambi said, they check ALL your boxes with ease! Been going for 28 years straight prior to last year, can't say enough good about them!!"
6568552,Bergy,2021-06-10 14:15:00,83,Thank you for the suggestions. We are looking for a resort we can drive to. We will be bringing our own boats.
6568568,Hawker,2021-06-10 15:20:00,3967,"Have been taking my own boat for the past 10+ yrs to YWC. Short 3-4 minute boat ride to the island lodge. They'll assist unloading/loading boat, gear, luggage etc and deliver all your stuff right to the door of the cabin. Electric and cords on the lighted docks for charging as well."
6568572,Wallychowder,2021-06-10 15:32:00,1567,Where do you leave your vehicle and trailer ?
6568636,Hawker,2021-06-10 18:01:00,3967,Private road/drive to secure parking at their private landing.
6568784,Baseline,2021-06-11 07:30:00,3207,"I've been fishing just north of the border for nearly 40 years. My recommendation would be to schedule your trip in late August or even early September. The weather will be cooler and still stable, bugs will be mostly gone and the fish will still be glued to the reefs and weedy shorelines. If it has to be July it will usually be warm, buggy and the bite is mostly in the AM and PM. Lake of the Woods, Nestor Falls is a good choice. Young's on Stevens Bay allows access to some great areas to fish LOW. Young's might be hard to get into in July because they have lots of loyal customers. Your group could also stay on Crow Lake at Hansons or Boreal. Crow has lake trout, SMB and musky. All the resorts have access to Stevens Bay on LOW at a private landing 5 minutes away. You would also have access to Whitefish Bay which is a short 7 mile drive and has some of the best midsummer bass and pike fishing to be had. Access is at Vic and Dots. Downside is you have drive. Upside is you have more variety and if this is your first trip it gives you an opportunity to do research for future trips. I personally like Hanson's Resort and usually stay there when I fish this area. Morson is also a good area to fish LOW. Morson is basically at the other end of the areas you can access from Stevens Bay. There are also several resorts that are located on Islands in this area and all have secure mainland parking. LOW will provide walleye, pike, musky, SMB , LMB and crappie. LOW would probably be the best choice for mid summer fishing, but late August and September even better. Rainy is also good, but IMO is better in late August and September. I most familure with the Red Gut, Swell and Seine Bay areas. Excellent walleye and pike fishing. SMB can be had, but you have to use deep presentations. The Landings is located in the middle of Red Gut. Taylors Cove and the Fisheries are located on Bear Passage and give easy access to all the bays in either direction. If you have any questions you can PM me."
