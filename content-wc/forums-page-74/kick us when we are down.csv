6572866,Wawajake,2021-06-24 20:18:00,413,"Once again some of you Americans are assuming these proposals etc are aimed specifically at the USA , when actually it is aimed at outside investors from countries like China that are driving the prices of Canadian real estate up dramatically. This has been happening for a few years now in the condo market in Vancouver and Toronto for eg, but now it is happening when there is also a severe shortage of new build housing due to pandemic and its effect on trades and materials. So when foreign speculators buy up properties and sit on them , vacant or underutilized, that is one red flag and taxation that our Gov can use to slow down the market price rise. If it effects Americsn cottage owners it is a side effect, not the primary reason. Here in Ontario , whether in cities or rural, home prices have increased 35 to 45 percent in one year......a unheard of increase that has to be slowed , by policy decisions and by any other means eg any other supports to get new housing built quickly . Because our economy cannot handle other methods used in previous decades like raise bank mortage interest rates , that tool is unavailable in the 21st century. ."

I'd be shocked if this tax ends up applying to legitimate vacation property, just like I'd be shocked if the US government imposes such a tax on Canadian snowbirds who have property in Florida, etc."
