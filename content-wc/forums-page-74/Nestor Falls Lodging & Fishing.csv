6570732,Bergy,2021-06-18 05:07:00,83,"Anyone have any experience with the resorts in the Nestor Falls area of LOTW? Looking at Meline’s, Tinker’s and Sunset Cove. Or other suggestions? Looking for a good clean resort with protected docks from the wind. Also owners who will assist with where to fish. How is the Walleye fishing in this area of LOTW? How far do you have to travel by water to get to good fishing areas?"
6570898,Lac Seul John,2021-06-18 12:06:00,31,"We stayed at Young's Wilderness Camp a few years ago on the American Plan. The cabins, food, boats, and people are all top notch! We had a guide for half the week and he took us for about a 30 minute boat ride each day to walleye fish. It was early summer and the fish were setting up on rock humps in 17 to 25 foot of water - so having a guide was key to finding the structure. You could catch pike in the weeds and while walleye fishing, but the big ones were caught trolling diving cranks over deeper water (not really my cup of tea). We didn't really try for muskie. I believe there is alot more fish closer to the lodge earlier in the year, but cannot say that with certainty. I think the lodge sits in the middle of a large spawning bay. People did fish closer to camp, but I cannot recall how they did. I think the walleye fishing there rated about as good as any other body of water I have fished in Canada (Eagle, Lac Seul, Wabigoon, & a Red Lake fly out), but it was a bit of a trip to get to the fishing grounds. I've had exceptional days at Lac Seul, but not sure how that measures up as I have spent alot more time there and know that lake alot better. I also had a great experience with the guide - but I understand that he is now the owner of the bait shop in town, and no longer guides on the lake. The owner - Perry - guides as well."

6571040,Hawker,2021-06-18 18:43:00,3967,"His name is Treavor and the bait and tackle store is ""Bite Me Bait and Tackle"" next to the post office and grocery store in Nestor Falls. Great guy, excellent guide and he does still guide on occasion on both LOTW and Crow Lake! I second the recommendation for Young's Wilderness Camp! Excellent accommodations, clean, well run camp with excellent lodging, fabulous host's (Perry & Carol Annuik), excellent staff, etc, etc, etc!!"
6571068,Bergy,2021-06-18 19:59:00,83,Does Treavor have a resort? We are not interested in Young’s. We want a drive to camp. Any insight on the places I mentioned or others in the area? How about the Walleye fishing in the area and how close to Nestor Falls?
6571094,Lac Seul John,2021-06-18 20:54:00,31,"Yep Trevor that's our guide. Good times!The resort is short boat ride from the ramp, about a mile or so."
6571354,Bill Krejca,2021-06-20 06:50:00,6107,"Vehicle is left at the landing, next to the camp's resident house, so it is fairly secure. Bill"
6571370,Wallychowder,2021-06-20 07:27:00,1567,I would check out Arrowhead resort
6571620,jambi,2021-06-21 07:46:00,504,Some of these resorts in Nestor are right on the highway...Just FYI.
6571732,Bergy,2021-06-21 12:33:00,83,Ok. We don’t want to be right on the highway. Any recommendations in the Nestor Falls area for a drive to camp with protected docks from the wind?
