6570324,Eckohlt,2021-06-16 14:12:00,3685,Nice ice cold root beer
6570326,7 Mag,2021-06-16 14:14:00,1887,I was thinking more in the line of beer with out the root.
6570330,prov1800,2021-06-16 14:24:00,5010,Our lilacs have bloomed and gone.Ill keep trying and see if its a late spawn.Wayne Clark said the shiners havnt spawned yet either so who knows.since when we had crappies they always spawned around the 70 f temp and has been that way for a number of years.ill check again next time iam out.
6570364,Eckohlt,2021-06-16 15:49:00,3685,Those crappies might all need a C- section
6570376,prov1800,2021-06-16 16:34:00,5010,I've performed hundreds of those.
6570382,Eckohlt,2021-06-16 16:44:00,3685,"And I'm sure you are licensed to perform them,without taking all the schooling to get your degree,you just have to go buy a sharp knife"
6570384,Eckohlt,2021-06-16 16:45:00,3685,I need the root
6570440,prov1800,2021-06-16 20:54:00,5010,I was giving a Chicago cutlery knife around 20 years ago and still have and use it.Its getting thinner but good for a long time yet.Just recently I thinned it down as its reaching near the top and wider there.
6570452,Eckohlt,2021-06-17 03:19:00,3685,"Let the wife read your post it will give her a idea what to get you for Xmas,that's if your a good boy for the rest of the year"
6570464,prov1800,2021-06-17 05:13:00,5010,Morning Rod.Being a outdoorsy guy iam pretty easy to shop for.Anything to do with fishing or hunting.I seem to have about everything I need though.But here is some good news .Was watching to Toronto news this morning as this area seems to dictate how our province rolls.They said there isxnot one person in any hospital in a ICU.Now that's good newsYesterday I got my second dose of moderna which was scheduled for August so our vaccinations are ahead of schedule also.That kinda news is good news.They lifted the Ont/Mb order restrictions yesterday meaning Manitobans can cross into Ontario which also is good news.If they are double vaccinated they won't have to quarantine on there way back otherwise they would have to.
6570140,prov1800,2021-06-15 20:39:00,5010,Pick another calm day.Fishing was pretty good on the west end of Cedar today but further east I went i ran into huge mayfly explosion.Everywhere.Caught my 4 walleye within a few minutes so just went and cast for smallies.Unreal action on some bass lures.They are on there beds and it was almost every cast.poppers worked greàt as did a tiny torpedo and a few crank baits.Unfortunatly I lost 2 lures to muskies.lol.Figure well over a 100 smallies today.Almost to calm and to hot but not complaining.
6570162,Eckohlt,2021-06-16 03:17:00,3685,"John you better take Wednesday off to rest your arms,water must be warm if the flies are hatching already,all the fish are going to need Botox to fix there lips after you get done with them"
6570196,prov1800,2021-06-16 06:08:00,5010,Water was 70f on main lake.Bays are warmer.Earlier than normal hatch.Walleyes bite good in the first few days and there were no flies down in the west ends clear water.my st Croix mojo med bait caster and the pro max reel worked real good easy on the arm and hand.
6570222,Bill Krejca,2021-06-16 07:26:00,6107,"Yeah, life is heck!!!! Bill"
6570226,prov1800,2021-06-16 07:34:00,5010,Somedays you get lucky.Still no crappie spawn yet Bill very strange.
6570290,Bill Krejca,2021-06-16 12:33:00,6107,"Betcha it's over! Either already occurred or didn't happen. Not gonna happen, sometimes just not a predictable event. Bill"
6570294,prov1800,2021-06-16 12:43:00,5010,Weird.been trying since water temps hit 60f.They like it warm.maybe happen yet.Was really looking forward to that.
6570308,7 Mag,2021-06-16 13:49:00,1887,"Don't know if you have any Lilacs around but some people go by the old adage that “when the lilacs are blooming, the crappies are spawning."
6570316,Wallychowder,2021-06-16 14:00:00,1567,And the mushrooms are popping too. We used to cook up mushrooms and crappie and have a feast !
6570320,7 Mag,2021-06-16 14:11:00,1887,"That sounds like a good meal, just add a cold beverage!"
