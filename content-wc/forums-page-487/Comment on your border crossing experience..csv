Just got back from a week up at Cedar Lake (up past Eagle) and had good experiences at the border both heading up and returning back to the States. Guards were all very professional, and once their questions were answered, we drove on. Rich B"
1315279,Glenman12,2011-06-06 20:47:00,762,Hi Rich. read your other post about the lousy fishing for your week...looks like that was the case thru most of NW Ontario for that week...what days and at what time did you cross the border?..we are hoping to be there this Friday at around 2:00PM
1315287,Rich B,2011-06-06 21:01:00,1081,"Glenman, We crossed over on Sunday at about 7:30 am, and had no wait time (of course it was a Sunday). Came back and crossed into the US on Sat about noon (again no wait time). The water temps were upper 50s to low 60s all week......your week should be excellent as the water temps should be up and a lot of the fish into the shallow bays, etc. Our best bites were down the lake past the long narrows and near the spawning areas....the deeper south end of the lake was dead (so to speak) for the entire week. We worked back into Nelson lake and took some nice large Crappies and perch, and a few nice walleyes; but nothing consistent bite wise for the walleyes (though the crappie and perch got going a few days). Best wishes to you and your group for a great week at the Lodge (Dean as always was very helpful - they have a full camp this week, so I'm sure you'll get some updated info when you check into camp). Take good care, Rich"

A big drawback for many using the link form is that it requires your name, address, and phone number. With that information, depending on your comments, you could be targeted for some very special attention next time you cross into Canada. Just sayin."
1315427,Mike Kansas,2011-06-07 09:01:00,1463,"Crossing the Border is simply a matter of being courteous and respectful. I always turn off the vehicle when I reach the guard station and have all the windows rolled down. I also request that the rest of our group only speak when asked a question by the guard. Always tell them the truth and have all your paperwork ready. Have always had a good experience with the guards. They have a tough job and you can make it easier for them and you. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1315469,Larry Mac,2011-06-07 10:08:00,530,"I posted this comment yesterday on another thread but just wanted to share this current experience from last week;""I crossed into Canada at International Falls @ 11:00 PM Friday May 27th. There were just a couple of vehicles ahead of me. The Customs Agent was very nice and asked a few basic questions, scanned my passport and told me to have a nice visit to Canada.I returned via International Falls Saturday June 4th and drove straight to booth. The Customs Agent was very pleasant, asked me how the fishing was, did I bring anything back and then proceeded to ask me where I would recommend taking his family fishing when he is off of work.""These were very pleasant crossingsThank you Custom AgentsHave a great fishing seasonSincerely,Larry Mac"
