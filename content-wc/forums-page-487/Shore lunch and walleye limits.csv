1312989,mclemson,2011-05-31 10:32:00,19,"You had said, ""Please show me the language for your claim in the regulations."" I was browsing WC on my mobile phone and knew I had just seen it in the regulations the previous day, so I provided you with the link.I'm sorry I couldn't help you more."
1312992,mclemson,2011-05-31 10:37:00,19,It's just like in the US -- you are going to find different regulations on almost every body of water. Especially the waters within a few hundred miles of the US-Canada border. Zones tend to define fishing regulations. Lake of the Woods (where Obabikon and I fish) is in Zone 5 and Lake of the Woods has exceptions for the regulations in Zone 5. Lac Seul is in Zone 4 and also has exceptions from the regulations. Lake St. Joseph appears to be in Zone 2 and the limits you stated are correct. Though this PDF does say that non-residents camping on Crown land are subject to conservation limits:http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodcons...ent/198220.pdfAnd of course as you know you must obtain a St. Joseph tag from the lodge/resort/guide/etc.

1310911,bigwalleye1,2011-05-24 19:37:00,2632,"We eat walleye every day for shore lunch and bring no fish back to the lodge during our stay, except for the last day, where we do shore brunch. We scramble a pound of bacon, a dozen jumbo eggs, and a can of sliced potatoes together, then have a cold melon for dessert, and bring back our 4 fish limit to bring home. Quite a meal for 4 guys.... I do know some guys in camp bring sandwiches for the day, eat them in the boat, and have fish for the evening meal, but I think they're cheating themselves out of shorelunch, and that's not something you can have at home the way you can in Canada. To each their own, but I think shorelnch is vastly UNDER rated. Those who haven't experienced it can't understand what the big deal is about it. Those of us that have just smile and nod......"
1311016,rebs,2011-05-25 06:30:00,7587,"a shore lunch cannot be beat, a walleye dinner at home is great but does not compare to a shore lunch on the lake shore with an open fire and a cast iron skillet, fresh air, atmosphere etc.. Man my mouth is watering now."
1312553,Glenman12,2011-05-29 20:35:00,762,"didnt know about this in 1981, our first trip to Canada..4 novices..fishing was good on Cedar Lake so about mid week we decided to do a flyout...( it was only $75 back then)..they recommended Vaughn Lake..caught a bunch of eaters and decided to go in and do shore lunch..that was my first and it was great continued fishing caught some more eyes and the guy manning the stringer inadvertantly hooked the stringer on the rear brace of the boat..of course when we took off the fish got into the prop and had to be discarded.. as we came out of a bay we were approached by a boat with an Indian with long hair wearing a flannel shirt...lo and behold he was MNR...he checked our licenses which we all had and checked what he had on the stringer ..he then asked if we had shorelunch..we said we did and pointed to the beach where we ate..he told us to wait here... He then went there and got out of the boat..we dont know what he was doing at the time..but turns out he was looking for carcasses of filleted fish we had eaten..dont know if he found any but he said we were fine and he left.. was a long time ago and dont remember if what we had on the stringer when he stopped us combined with what we had for shore lunch would have put us over our 6 fish limit but it was a lesson learned Ironically, we've been to Cedar Lake 30 times since and havent seen MNR once.."
1312576,Obabikon,2011-05-30 04:25:00,2370,"There seems to be a little confusion. The Walleye limit for a sport license (the big) is (2) per day and (4) total possession. That means if you want walleyes for lunch ever day, you can't take any home. However, you can still do a shore lunch with crappie, perch, and northerns. So, if you're up for several days... then 2 days out of your trip you need to eat something other than walleye for lunch. I personally think the rule is silly, and next to impossible to enforce. However, that is the law, and it's designed to protect our walleye populations. It's also meant to keep people from Northern Minnesota from doing multiple ""day"" trips up and taking 4 back each day."
1312644,3M TA3,2011-05-30 11:35:00,2846,"I'm quite sure you're full of it on this one. Please show me the language for your claim in the regulations. I don't believe it exists. I've purchased both the Conservation license and the Sporting license and only camp/fish on Crown land, have been checked several times by the MNR, and have never had a problem. Is it possible you're just making this $#!t up?"
1312680,mclemson,2011-05-30 13:29:00,19,True for some areas: mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/2ColumnSubPage/STEL02_165432.html
1312697,Bill Krejca,2011-05-30 14:23:00,6107,"Having camped (and stayed at resorts) many, many times in various parts of Ontario, I have found the above to be true for the areas I fished in. There are just scads of stories of folks not understanding the rules, and being fined for, after having a limit, eating that species. Fridays (fry-days?) seem to be one of the favorite days for the officials to check possessions. Bill Krejca"
1312797,3M TA3,2011-05-30 18:48:00,2846,Please. You can do better than this. Cut and paste the language if nothing else.
1312805,v-bay gord,2011-05-30 19:02:00,3168,"There are different rules in different fisheries management zones in Ontario. Unless you are knowledgeable on all of them I would not be so hasty on your scepticism. The two fish limit on the regular licence applies to the boundary waters such as Lake of the Woods, and more specifically to those day users crossing the border to fish Ontario waters. Need the documentation? Look it up ...."
1312942,3M TA3,2011-05-31 08:11:00,2846,"You got the sketicisim part right. MUNSHAW made a blanket statement ""I beleive Americans camping on Crown Land (public land) in campers etc. are subject ONLY to a conservation licence (2 fish). Americans camping at a licenced outfitter can get either a sport licence (2 fish) or conservation licence (2 fish). "" MCLEMSON says ""true in some areas"" and then offers the whole brochure as evidence. I already know the rules for where I fish but the point was one should know the rules where they fish. One rule doesn't apply to everybody, necessarily. And MUNSHAW's statement was BS. That's all."
1310729,mclemson,2011-05-24 11:26:00,19,"If a walleye catch limit includes any fish eaten or given away (http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...ge/199168.html), how do people have a walleye shore lunch and still go home from a weekend trip with a limit in their car? It would seem that if I eat a 13"" walleye at lunch with some beans and potatoes, then take two 17"" walleye back to the dock, I'm breaking the rules.Anyone have advice on this?Additional guidance: ""any fish not live-released are part of your daily catch and retain limit""http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...ge/198680.html"
1310732,fishman10,2011-05-24 11:38:00,226,"you are allowed 4 walleye in possesion under a normal lisence. you are allowed 2 in possesion under a conservation lisence. MAKE sure you have the right lisence. you are allowed to eat and keep your limit for the day. e.g- eat 1 and keep 3, or eat 2 and keep 2. but you can eat walleye and take your limit the next day, as long as you dont go over your daily possesion limit. so you can eat all week long and then take your possesion limit home when you leave as long as you havent gone over your daily limit."
1310737,mclemson,2011-05-24 11:41:00,19,It appears from this source (page 3) that non-resident anglers (I'm a Minnesota resident) can only take 2 fish in one day:http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodcons...nr_e001325.pdfMaking me think we ought to be packing sandwiches instead.
1310748,jswinter40,2011-05-24 12:10:00,127,2 licenses for non-residents. 4 walleye limit for $45? and 2 walleye limit for $22? has been that way for awhile and current regs don't show changes as far as I see. some resorts only sell the 2 fish conservation license to help their particular fishery.
1310785,mclemson,2011-05-24 13:31:00,19,"But under a sporting license (possess 4, daily limit 2), not a conservation license (possess 2, daily limit 1), it would still be impossible to limit out on a 2-day or 3-day trip if you're eating a little walleye for lunch, correct? A consumed walleye counts against the day's total?I'm just confused because everywhere I read that they eat walleye for shore lunch, and everywhere I read they limit out. How can you do both except with a longer trip?"
1310806,Bill Krejca,2011-05-24 14:18:00,6107,"Folks wanting to take their limit home normally do not eat any fish the last day, and applicably keep enough to fill out on, thus maintaining a lawful limit to take home. Another approach if they wanted to eat fish the last day would be to, say, eat pike the last day, and then not take pike home, etc. Bill"
1310833,Munshaw,2011-05-24 15:00:00,279,"I beleive Americans camping on Crown Land (public land) in campers etc. are subject ONLY to a conservation licence (2 fish). Americans camping at a licenced outfitter can get either a sport licence (2 fish) or conservation licence (2 fish). That is correct, if someone camping on crown land eats two fish for lunch, then takes two more home on the same day, they are breaking the rules. If someone eats a shore lunch, then the next day takes 4 walleye home and they are staying at a lodge, they are within the rules. It's a bit complicated, but make sure you are clear. Americans camping on crown land are often targeted by conservation officers, because many try to take home more than they are allowed. It's quite common up here (Thunder Bay area). As always, its usually a few bad apples. I susupect the vast majority play by the rules."
1310851,stumper1300,2011-05-24 16:09:00,231,"Nothing to be confused by. If the daily limit is 2 fish and you eat 2 fish, you go home with the 2 fish in your belly .You took your limit( or ""limited out"").If you also took 2 more fish to the dock, you broke the law. Pretty clear?"
1310877,mclemson,2011-05-24 17:44:00,19,"Might have to convince a few folks to eat pike or perch for lunch I think. We'll be up at Lake of the Woods for just three days of walleye fishing.This is a helpful clarification. It doesn't explain what I read elsewhere in terms of folks gorging themselves on walleye, but answers my question."
1310886,stumper1300,2011-05-24 18:16:00,231,Sounds to me like they are bragging about breaking the law weather they know it or not.
