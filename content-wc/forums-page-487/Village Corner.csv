1308489,tackleman,2011-05-18 09:34:00,444,I stopped at the Bakery a couple days ago and the lady there told me that the corner will NOT be rebuilt. the owners are currently renovating a location in downtown Dryden for their new business.Kinda hard to believe they would abandon that location. I thought it was a gold mine. If it isn't rebuilt it will certainly be a great loss for the vermilion bay area.
1314889,HeHooksHimself,2011-06-05 22:08:00,725,"Was through VB last week. Village corner still in shambles. We were not disappointed with Busters, although they could use another egg in their omelets and no side orders of cakes, you must order the pancake meal. Good food though and the people are very pleasant. Allan (Bobbys), however, lost my business for good. Everyone else was trading US vs. Canadian at 5% (the exchange rate is currently 3%) and he was stabbing us for 10%. As entertaining as it is verbally sparring with him, stealing is frowned upon in Canada as well as the US."
1314893,rather-be-fishin,2011-06-05 22:26:00,429,Where is Buster's?
1314903,bpetersen,2011-06-05 23:28:00,251,Busters is right across the street from Bobby's. It is a very good BBQ place. Pete
1308312,HeHooksHimself,2011-05-17 21:14:00,725,Does anyone know if the Village Corner was able to reopen? If not is there another option for breakfast in Vermilion Bay?
1308316,HeHooksHimself,2011-05-17 21:23:00,725,"I see that Village Corner will not be open. Sad. it is such a part of our routine. We can go to Bobby's for our license, as long as we can take the cussing out he usually has for us. Say something to him like, ""Didn't mean to wake you up."" and see what you get. it is pretty funny and we always initiate rookies with Bobby."
1308345,Blue Lk,2011-05-18 05:25:00,269,"I heard a rumour that Buster's,just across the road from Bobby's was going to start serving breakfast.The grumpy old guy at Bobby's is Allan."
1308366,v-bay gord,2011-05-18 06:13:00,3168,"Correct, Buster's has started serving breakfast....there is also the Bakery (near the fort) that does breakfast/ coffee/ etc. Heads up though, if you plan on making a ""quick stop"" for gas on a Saturday you may be in for a wait. With only one gas station serving the highway, the fishing crowd and the locals, you may have a delay. What used to be two busy locations has now been condensed (because of the fire) into one."
1308381,81Saluki,2011-05-18 06:53:00,97,"We LOVE Buster's ribs ... usually get a rack to-go for each of us (plus a bottle of their awesome sauce) when heading up to open the cabin. Hope they do well with their b'fast menu!BTW ... sure wish someone would buy the old Bratland's place (across the road from Bobby's). It was always nicer to visit ... and no one ever made rude remarks to us, unlike the grumpy old guy at Bobby's. :-("
1308411,Sutsgold,2011-05-18 07:34:00,219,"I LOVE the rude comments. Im never offended. It is so old school, it totally cracks me up. Allan, keep doing your thing."
1308435,Golden Eagle,2011-05-18 08:11:00,2642,I stayed in my van while my rookie went into Bobby's for license last Friday. Rookie returned to the van and asked me to go in with him to prevent a fight. I explained on the ride to Red Lake.
1308441,jkwildhunting,2011-05-18 08:19:00,361,x2 We started going there as Corner was always busy we can get in and outta bobby in good time and always fun to walk thru the shop and listen to what Bobby has to say...You usually end up with a few good laughs...that is if you can take some humor the guy wont make us stop from coming!
1308442,HeHooksHimself,2011-05-18 08:19:00,725,"We love to initiate the rookies there. We send them in with a loaded question and he always leaves them speechless. I will admit though, I think he can go over the line, but I blush easily. I know it is not Bobby, but i heard a rumor that Allan is Bobby's twin. Not sure if it is true. We usually stay in Vermilion Bay at the Pine Grove Motel and they are serving a continental breakfast this year. Perhaps Buster's will serve as our dinner location. I hope the Village Corner can rebuild soon!"
1308483,Golden Eagle,2011-05-18 09:24:00,2642,"Bobby and Allen did well curling. Made some money over the years. They'd flip a coin for double or nothing on a customer's tab. Mostly won. Even when they lost they were out only the wholesale price and the ""winner"" couldn't wait to get back and beat them again, but that usually didn't happen. Can't remember a customer winning two in a row. We'd drop in with a dozen or so in our party. Lots of action."
