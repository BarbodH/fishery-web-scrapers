1312908,scar,2011-05-31 06:02:00,196,"Need info about this crossing. We are going up on Sat. June 11 and know this will be a very busy day. We usually cross at I falls but the boys want to see the north shore for the 1st time and I want to visit Tetagouche state park as we may climb there later this summer. I know I falls will be very backed up on this date. How bad does the line get a P. River? Also, I need more info about the bypass of T. Bay- What roads to take to get to Sioux Lookout area and how much longer will this route take? Thanks!"
1312916,Guest,2011-05-31 07:00:00,0,About 20 miles past the border take a left on 130 and you will come out on 17. Take a left. Then it's Hwy 17 to 72 to Sioux Lookout. We've gone both ways and it's 58 miles further than going through the Falls from where we live in Northern Wisconsin. Get a map at visitor center when you cross the border. There is even another shortcut off 130 but it only saves a few miles. We come home that way because the crossing is a lot quicker--never more than 10 minutes as compared to 2 hours + at the Falls. Good fishing.
1312922,Pooch,2011-05-31 07:08:00,4619,"Pigeon River is a small crossing relative to Fort Francis. Normally it's much quicker, but since it's a smaller crossing and if there is a lot of traffic (an event in Thunder bay area) it could take a while. We always favor it over FF if possible.Drive to Sioux Lookout might be longer via Pigeon River if that's where your headed. Might depend on where you departed from. From Illinois it's kind of a toss up, but more interesting to go up 61 and cross at Pigeon River. Be aware that traffic on 61 north of Duluth can be heavy and slow on holidays. Also since it's along the shore it can be really foggy in some areas. Pretty drive overall.When returning to the states we take the 130 bypass around Thunder Bay which saves very little time, but have found the river bypass is much quicker. I don't have the directions, but someone reading this will surely volunteer them.Pooch"
1312953,dkrusin,2011-05-31 09:05:00,97,I think it is 130 to Barrier Dr to River Road to 588 to 11/17. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong.
1313035,phishfearme,2011-05-31 12:07:00,1242,pooch is right on as usual and dkrusin is correct as to the fastest route to 11/17 - and it's all paved now the entire way. pidgeon river is MUCH easier than I.F. although the duty free store can be short on popular brands ar specials. phish
1313966,Spin,2011-06-02 13:56:00,42,Drive the speed limit on Barrier Road. Last 2 years I've been up there I've seen the OPP driving down it the other way. I think its a 50kpm road
1314062,guidedfishing,2011-06-02 19:32:00,531,"In addition to the OPP that patrol this stretch, I have also seen game wardens setup up a check point where 130 meets 61. We had one of our group pulled over for 10km over in the 50km zone. He was given a very stern warning and the OPP officer made it clear how much of a pain in the butt it would be if he gave him a ticket.good luck, and yes my perception is that short cut is watched fairly closely, its very easy to speed on that route so be mindful.good luckGF"

1314356,elway12,2011-06-03 16:41:00,335,Thanks JJJMN That's an excellent map and directions. We will be trying this route for the first time the 2nd week in July.
