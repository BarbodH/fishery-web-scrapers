We stay in 3 cabins usually (16 - 20 guys).We are going again June 3rd.Norm runs a good operation, always on time and always ready to help fit your plan into his schedule.He has 25 HP Mercury 2 strokes (new this year) on 15' Princecraft, and they are very well cared for. He had 20 HP 4 cycles last year but said a few guys had trouble starting sometimes.
