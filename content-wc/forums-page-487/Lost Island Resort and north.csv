1314810,Iowa Hawkeye,2011-06-05 18:39:00,90,How far is it to Three Sisters and Chamberlain from the Lost Island Resort. Is this a long ride and tuff navigating? I was thinking the Rags would be on this route. Thanks for the help

Lost Island, Crooked, Manitou, Rags, 3 Island Stretch, Banana Island, Taylor Island, Monument/Green Marker, Bear Narrows, 3 Sisters, Little Chamberlain, Chamberlain. Navigating isn't toooo bad, definitely don't want to stray too far from the main channel. Don't go based on a GPS map chip alone... lots of rocks aren't marked on them. Good luck and good fishing!"
