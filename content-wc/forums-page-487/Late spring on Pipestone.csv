We did however catch several 10+ walleyes. Some dandy lakers still up shallow and a 50 in. catch and release Musky while trolling crawler harnesses"

Were you using minnows? Just curious, I use to own a cabin on the Pipe that I sold in 2003 and I always started the season with the opening week, which can be majical!! Congrats on your 10+ eyes."
1314540,camp chef,2011-06-04 11:48:00,915,We used minnows and crawlers. We did fish the bays but at the wrong time of day.our group has some early risers in it. On the water early off by 5 pm for cocktail hour .sunshine and flat water made it tough. Next year my boat partner and myself are going alone so we can fish until dark without disrupting the flow of cabin life
