1222690,IaDave,2010-07-27 06:38:00,476,Anybody been up there recently- Heading up in a month and wondering how low or high the water is in the creek/river that goes from Butterfly Lake to Lyons Bay. If they have had half the rain we have gotten it shouldn't be low.
1223371,Guest,2010-07-29 09:04:00,0,"We were there in late June, had to slow down some to get thru the channel without bumping bottom, probably added 5 min each way to the time of our runs. Kevin at TEC says I do it wrong, should go thru on full plane, but when I tried it I bumped, and I don't have the guts to do that unless the water is real high. i have a 16.5 Mirrocraft with a 50 hp Merc. Fishing was good but very different from last year. Some fish were already on main lake humps. Some spots were great one day and poor the next, especially on bright sunny days. Biggest problem was that my wife did not catch many large fish, she is still pouting about that."
1311377,metmen,2011-05-25 23:31:00,142,Hey guys headed for timber edge for the first time I plan to be there the last week in june I have only fished 3 or 4 of wyomings lakes what can I expect up there and does anybody have any good tips that they wouldn't mind sharing. I will be taking my 18ft spectrum with a 140hp johnson a 9.9 kicker and good electric trolling motor. Thanks JB
1311829,IaDave,2011-05-27 07:31:00,476,I'm not much help on that time of year as we always go in Sept but Kevin will be very helpful. You will have to go thru a small river(hope the water is high for you) into Lyons Bay and then into the main lake. It will be a quick for you unless the water is low. The camp is older but well kept the only thing I didn't like is the cabins are up on a hill and you have to drive down to the docks. All in all it is a good camp for the price. PM me if you have any questions.
1311870,Guest,2011-05-27 09:34:00,0,"We will be there the same week. Have been going at about this time for several years. The fish will be well after spawning, all the spawning reserves will be open. We catch them at that time using various general methods, depends on weather. Some guys like tossing small jigs into weedbeds, this worked well for us last two years. Others vertical jig on fixed spots. We often bottom bounce with spinners or troll with cranks that run 15 to 20 ft. If we don't find fish at our favorite spots, we look for waves breaking onto the shoreline and try various depths offshore. We will have a 16.5 ft MirroCraft, should see you at the dock. Hope you have a great time."
1311920,metmen,2011-05-27 12:10:00,142,Hey thanks for the input i will look for you so you like pull the deeper cranks I love fishing cranks i will have to make sure I have a few deeper runners. You mainly target the walleye how is the pike fishing? Do you take live bait with you or do you get it up there?thanks JB
1312180,Guest,2011-05-28 10:45:00,0,"Yes we like to drag cranks around also. We pull Shad Raps (usually the Walleye finish), Bombers, or Reef Runners at about 2.3 mph just using flatlines. Never seen anyone up there bother with planar boards etc. Silver and sliver/blue are good colors for us. We get most of our pike while fishing for walleyes, or we go to weedbeds like those in Redpine Bay if we want pike specifically. There is a good weedbed right in Butterfly Lake right by the houses just a few hundred yds from the camp. Last year a guy who went with us and had hardly fished at all got two 40+ inch pike tossing little jigs into weedbeds. There aren't a lot of weedbeds on the lake, I can show you some when we are there. We never try to bring in bait, just buy it from Kevin at the camp. We don't use crawlers much anyway. Even if we plan on trolling with cranks, will usually take along some minnows or leeches as backup, we often change our plans while we are out on the lake, and its a long way back to camp.."
1312305,metmen,2011-05-28 22:09:00,142,Hey thanks for the tips I am going to try to pick up a few deep divers but with the price of cranks I don't want to go crazy i need to save some money for fuel. If you had to buy 3 or 4 what would be your go to crank. Thanx JB

1314730,Guest,2011-06-05 11:39:00,0,"I'd like to get back to the original post. Any info on the water level in the channel between Butterfly and Lyons Bay and Minnitaki? How has fishin been? How have things been for the rest of you guys who use the camps in Pickeral Arm, or those who fish on Minnitaki in general?"
