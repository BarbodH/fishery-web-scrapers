1314811,Rich B,2011-06-05 18:49:00,1081,"Just back from our Spring trip up to Cedar Lake (Cedar Lake Lodge) last week with my brother and a few other good friends. Had excellent service and help from the lodge (one of my brother's trolling batteries lost a cell - they let him borrow a spare for the week). Total round trip mileage from eastern Ohio was 2,525 miles. One of the guys said it best about last week's weather....if you took all the sunshine from all the days and put it together, you might have a short day's sunshine.....tough fishing weather with high winds, cool temps and lots of rain in that area of western Ontario. Not many eyes shallow.....and the deeper ones weren't biting (at least not for us).....I had a nice Musky caught on a perch shad rap, and a good friend was able to use the large net to ""snag"" the lure right out of the Musky's mouth.....not many guys have the talent to do that without catching the Musky as well.....saved me the time to take a quick photo and release, though it was fun fighting the Musky for about 10 minutes or so before it was released boat side for me (ha). Got into some large perch, slab crappies, and enough walleyes for 3 fish fry's......had a great time, though had one of our friend's outboards almost caught fire.....guy pulled up to our boat and his Merc outboard was smoking.....seems the ""rectifier"" (?) overheated and came close to catching his outboard on fire....cooled it down with his extinguisher - he then trailered it up to a dealer in Red Lake (which replaced the electrical component for him). It's running OK now.....our new quote in camp is ""hey dude, your motor is smoking""......whole new meaning to the Merc advertising ""Set the water on fire"" - ha. Hope the weather patterns turn around for you guys up north this week.....back home to Ohio and 90+ weather with lots of sun. We did see a bear on the way up to camp and a wolf ran across the road right in front of our truck on the way back to the border.....Cedar lake is beautiful and will be missed until next year's Spring trip.

1315249,Rich B,2011-06-06 19:44:00,1081,"Bill, It's the Cedar lake just down the road from Cliff Lake, a little north of Eagle lake and a little south of Lac Suel. As windy as it was some days, I'm glad we were not on a larger body of water.....my brother has a Pro-V 1800 with a Merc 175 that moved us along (kept telling him that 2/3 throttle was plenty, with gas about $6.00 a gal - ha). This was our group's 3rd trip up in Springtime, and the poorest fishing....not that we didn't get into some fish, but not the action we were expecting, and not for lack of effort. The weather didn't give us a break, though we made the best of it and all in all had a great week. The youngest member of our group (42) was complaining about his shoulders and arms on the 2nd day....good thing he brought up some Aleve.....I was laughing at him, as I popped another cold Labatt's......we both have desk jobs, and I told him we've got to start working out before these week long fishing trips.

1315257,BuckeyeBill,2011-06-06 20:08:00,76,"Rich, I've made that trip quite a few times to western ontario. Have made trips to ear falls to fish lac seul twice, two trips to minnitaki and one trip to Big Vermillon near Sioux Lookout. Love fishing this region but at 60 I don't know if I can handle those long drives like I once did. Also live in eastern ohio. Wife and I are headed to a lake northeast of Sault Ste Marie in a few weeks to chase my favorite - smallies!!"
1315259,Rich B,2011-06-06 20:16:00,1081,"Fellow Buckeye, I hear you about those drives......I'm late 50s myself, and I spend a night at my brother's place outside Milwaukee on the drive up and back....though that's a long drive each way no matter how you break it up.....I do love the fishing up in northwest Ontario. Mid-July my wife and I are heading up to Tunnel Lake (also northeast of the Soo) for a week of R&R and bottom bouncing (and some SM Bass action); and staying at the Grand Falls Camp's cabin on Tunnel. Where are you and the Mrs Buckeye heading for in a few weeks ? Rich B"
1315398,BuckeyeBill,2011-06-07 08:13:00,76,"Rich, same area. We are staying at the outpost lodge and could fish tunnel lake but will probably stay on Jobamageeshig and fish for the smallies there. We catch the occasional walleye on Jobam and they are all 25"" or better but there just isn't many of them. We do the evening meal plan (great food) and the wife feels comfortable on the smaller lake as compared to Lac Seul. I have had her in tears before!! Only fished Tunnel once and didn't have much luck so we never went back. Best of luck to you and the Mrs. in July!!Bill"
