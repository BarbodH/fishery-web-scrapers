The discussion in our party last week during our week in Western Ontario began early as one in our party is a really good walleyer and said it was clear line that made the difference. I think it is better feel and more finesse. While I intend to change out my line to clear for my fall trip, i am still somewhat skeptical. We had a blue anchor rope and a chartruese (I realize this is an attractant, but is anything chartruese in the walleye's natural diet?) jig head next to the minnow, but some how the idea that the walleye could deduce that that darn visible line was suspicious and made the difference... Wonder what the opinions are on walleye central about this?"
