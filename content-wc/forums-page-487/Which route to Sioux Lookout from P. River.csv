1314039,scar,2011-06-02 18:13:00,196,Map quest shows 599 to 642 is 30 miles shorter then taking 11/17 all the way to Dinorwic and then 72 to Sioux Lookout. I am not familiar though with 599 and 642. Anyone know which is the best route?

1314109,fishman10,2011-06-02 21:12:00,226,"i have travelled both and can tell you to take 11-17 to dinorwic and then head north. the other way may be a bit shorter, but it is a turkey trail. GO TO DINORWIC AND HEAD NORTH. end of conversation."
1314169,BenBeattie,2011-06-03 06:26:00,232,I live in Sioux Lookout and travel between here at Thunder Bay regularily. Take everyone's advice and stay on 11/17 until heading North on 72 at Dinorwic.

Keep your eye out for moose on that stretch of road, early in mornings this time of year, you are as likely as not to see one."
