1315262,Larry Mac,2011-06-06 20:21:00,530,"I crossed into Canada at International Falls @ 11:00 PM Friday May 27th. There were just a couple of vehicles ahead of me. The Customs Agent was very nice and asked a few basic questions, scanned my passport and told me to have a nice visit to Canada.I returned via International Falls Saturday June 4th and drove straight to booth. The Customs Agent was very pleasant, asked me how the fishing was, did I bring anything back and then proceeded to ask me where I would recommend taking his family fishing when he is off of work.These were very pleasant crossingsThank you Custom AgentsHave a great fishing seasonSincerely,Larry Mac"

1314519,jswinter40,2011-06-04 09:53:00,127,"thanks Tyson, i will be crossing on a saturday in July.. we'll make sure to get there before 8am."
1314638,JMKC,2011-06-04 21:49:00,238,"We crossed at 1:45 PM, two cars in front of us, ten minutes and we were through. Lucky I guess. JJ"
1314682,REG,2011-06-05 08:03:00,445,6pm Friday eve. - 2 cars in front of us.
1314774,JayM5209,2011-06-05 15:33:00,1050,"10:30 a.m. yesterday (Saturday) southbound. No cars in front of us, pleasant woman working our lane who wanted to talk about perch fishing, and we were at the Shorelunch Cafe for breakfast after barely touching the brakes at the border."
1314809,Iowa Hawkeye,2011-06-05 18:23:00,90,"Wow!, on a Saturday?, what gives? no one going to Canada this year, or was the north bound side backed up?"
1315037,LOW1,2011-06-06 11:13:00,2828,Two of my kids and dog and I crossed southbound at IFalls about noon on Friday. One car in front of us. Agent asked where home was and opened cooler lid and that was it. There were many more border agents on duty than usual-perhaps we were there at shift change time. Northbound traffic also seemed light.
1315042,HeHooksHimself,2011-06-06 11:21:00,725,"Crossed the border into Canada on May 27, typical questons, five minute wait. On the return around noon on June 4 we drove right up. 30 seconds tops. I guess our scruffiness was enough to convince the agent we really were weary fishermen preparing for a long day on the road."
1315048,dewyg,2011-06-06 11:30:00,1006,"I was back and forth across the ifalls bridge this weekend on 3 seperate occasions. Customs officers said that people are car pooling and cutting down the line ups. Roughly same amount of people, just more to a vehicle. One good thing about high gas prices."
1315057,tv4fish,2011-06-06 11:47:00,2694,Might be hard for us travelling fishermen to do that BUT - I'm game -- any single gals looking to spend a week in Ontario - they can car pool with us
