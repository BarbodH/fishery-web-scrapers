Been doing this for 30 years (missed 2 for stupid reasons)., but this is the second trip for this lake. We've got a good group with good people. I used to be one of the young **** raisers in the group, still one of the younger ones, just take things slower. Good luck to all - BFG"

This is a trip I did about 15 years ago but have been tied up salmon fishing ever since. I can't wait to be back with my old buddies from the Midwest, fishing walleyes in some of the prettiest country anywhere. I miss it so much. Trouble is, I think I'd miss the Northwest if I had to move back. Got my tackle boxes jammed with Rapalas, Mepps, Roostertails and some jigs. What am I missing? I'm afraid I'm gonna need two bags, plus the rod tube."
1313866,Mike Kansas,2011-06-02 09:51:00,1463,"We will be back on Lac Seul at Lac Seul Lodges Outpost Camp Black Bay on June 11th. This is the 25th anniversary of us being at Black Bay and enjoying the great hospitality that Lac Seul Lodge supplies. Have two first timers going with us this year and I can't wait to see how they react. Great area on Lac Seul to be at...minimal boat traffic, great fishing and great company. Best of luck to all of you and may you have great fishing and a safe trip. Mike Kansas"

About 12 hrs of driving to FF, a few fitful hours of sleep before we hit the road for Lac Seul, Goose Bay Camp! 5 hours more on the road until we hit camp and hit the water! Then we hit the walleyes! Then a few beers, a few walleyes, repeat as often as possible, while staying legal of course!"

1310905,kegisfly,2011-05-24 19:22:00,22,"I had one of those rapalla spoons. I caught the biggest pike of my life on it and then I lost it on a snag last year. Those spoons are sold on ebay if you're interested, but they aren't necessarily cheap there. I will check out those Northland spoons. I liked the single hook rapalla spoons... They were fairly weedless, had good action, cast nicely, and seemed to really attract the fish, but, with the single hook, there were more fish that swung and missed. Thanks for the info.kegisfly"

1311046,wallydave,2011-05-25 07:36:00,2151,"kegis, I did find some Rap spoons on e-bay, some were pricey, just not the ones I bought! The Northlands look to be pretty close to the Rap, but without the great concave/convex shape. Only one way to find out, and in 10 days we actually hit the water on Lac Seul!"

1308902,wallydave,2011-05-19 08:01:00,2151,"I had made a promise to myself I would not buy anymore tackle for this years trip. Yea I know, good luck with that! So I found some spoons on the Northland site that reminded me of a rapella spoon that is now out of production. The Rap, was a single hook, weedless spoon that had great action. I always caught pike on the ones I had. Now that these new spoons are on the way, I here by promise to not buy any more gear for this years trip! With just 15 days until we hit the road North its time to work on the supply list, that does not include anything else for the tackle box! Really I mean it this time!"
1308979,NemegosendaRiver,2011-05-19 11:00:00,66,"HA! I was done in March. Well, I place an order for a Rapala Pliers Kit (clippers, jig eye buster, etc.) for my nephew's birthday (his first trip this year). I thought to myself, what if a million twister tails isn't enough?! So I ordered the Berkley Ribbontails in orange/white. Yesterday, my BIL was placing an order and had him add on two more packs of Ribbontails (Chart and White) along with two BPS XPS Nitro Shad hardbaits. I don't have anything in my box that everybody else doesn't already have so this year I am trying these. I think I am done now....I think. I may have to paint up some more jigs."

It was everything we hoped it would be and we've looked forward to this year's trip for months.

We have less than 60 days to go. We are taking two first timers on a fly in trip. Both for their high school graduations presents. It will be a good time. I like the garage pile picture, that is funny, I already have a table in the garage with stuff starting to find it ways to it, new fishing lures, first aid kit, rain gear, portable depth finder."

Sure can't wait to catch some fish. The lakes down here Norfork, Bull Shoals, Table Rock are 20 feet high due to the flooding and fishing is difficult. Ready to hear the loons and eat some walleye."
1307432,wallydave,2011-05-16 07:52:00,2151,"Last weekend I relined all my reels, couple ultra-lites, lights, and medium action set-ups, tackle box still needs a little light housekeeping to be trip ready. My official ""hoser gear"" is in the wash, ready for packing. I'll start to line up groceries and supplies next!"
1305193,J Arendt,2011-05-10 14:03:00,45,Blue Fin-- I'll keep you posted on Gullrock.
1305216,Moondog,2011-05-10 15:15:00,362,We were up at Gullrock for the opener last year and started right out fishing summer patterns. I think the early ice out last year really screwed up what we would consider normal fishing. Usually the walleye are skinny right after the spawn. Can't say that I really noticed much of that last year. We will be there for the opener again this year and expect terrific fishing.
1305443,NemegosendaRiver,2011-05-11 05:58:00,66,"64 days. We had our Canada Meeting this past weekend. We know who's driving and how many gallons of milk we are going to need. Outside of that, it was fun to tell stories that 75% of us have heard 100 times (four first timers this year.)14 guys (10 Adults, 4 Kids)30 cases of beer7 Bottles of LiquorTons of fishWe have a blog so that those of us who are geographically separated can obsess about the trip together. We started it in 2009. It has been pretty fun. If anyone has the time or ability, I recommend doing it for your trip.www.thechutes09.blogspot.com"

1305497,Mike Kansas,2011-05-11 07:46:00,1463,How could anybody going fishing to Canada not be excited. In a month we will be jigging on Lac Seul and enjoying the bounty of mother natures beauty. Everybody out there in WC land have a great trip this year and BE SAFE. Mike Kansas
1305499,NemegosendaRiver,2011-05-11 07:54:00,66,"It helps the time go by. We have gone from Long Train Ride to Short Train Ride to Float Plane over 35 years. We have had fish taken (improperly packaged-2006 which we are still pissed about), Fined, beer taken (back in our more daring days - Now we just pay the duty), wallets lost, run out of gas, in-camp surgery, knees blown out, etc and yet this still remains the best trip a person could go on. We seem very organized because we do the exact same thing every single year. We get gas at the same places, eat at the same restaurants on the way up and back, the meals remain the same in camp, we have had the same buy-in for the daily and weekly fish pot since I was 8, and any deviation from any of this would be dealt with by the fishing Gods in an angry manner."
1305506,Jack77,2011-05-11 08:14:00,168,"We went with Air Ivanhoe 2 years ago, Katagi lake. Do you guys take the road of death (556) taking that road is an adventure all by itself."
1305543,NemegosendaRiver,2011-05-11 09:34:00,66,"No. We kicked around the idea a few time but never have taken it. We don't even mess with 129. We go up 17 to Wawa, stay the night and take 101 over to Foleyet in the morning. On occasion George will have a slower schedule on Friday than on Sat and we will leave late Thursday night instead of Friday morning and drive straight through to get into camp Friday evening.Half of 556 unpaved?"
1305545,Jack77,2011-05-11 09:38:00,168,Well over half of it is unpaved. Very trying on your nerves but it cuts a lot of time off of the trip for us. We are going up to Nakina this year.
1302849,Moondog,2011-05-04 09:08:00,362,"10 days until we leave for Gull Rock. Live in Southern Colorado and you almost can't get there from here. Send money, need diesel and lots of it."

1305187,Blue Fin,2011-05-10 13:47:00,47,I will be heading up to Gull Rock 4 weeks from this Friday. You guys will have to let me know how it goes. I am curious to see if there will still be skinny walleyes this year. We have been going to the lake for a few years now and it seems like it was more of an issue last year than any other. Did either of you see that as well?Travel safe and good luck.
1305191,camp chef,2011-05-10 13:59:00,915,I am on different water

Probably will think of a couple of things we could have used after we get there and a dozen of things we took in that we don,t need but that will be on next years list. Lets go."
1302554,Dacotah Eye,2011-05-03 14:47:00,2722,I mostly get pumped at the gas station.
1302557,Jigger1,2011-05-03 14:51:00,234,53 days and crawling the walls - I've got two newbies this year making the trip.
1302572,Lovetofish,2011-05-03 15:15:00,458,9 weeks sounds better then 66 days. At least I'll soon be able to catch some local crappie.

My 2 bopys have never been there and they are in for a treet. more eyes than you can count. Also taking our daughter for her first trip this year. think she is more anctious than anyone. hope everyone has a great trip and catches the fish of a lifetime !!!!"
1302581,camp chef,2011-05-03 15:31:00,915,"God willing and the creeks don't rise.If I have learned anything,it is that nothing lasts forever. I have lost some good friends that assumed our Canada trip was going to happen every year. I am happy that this year we are not taking anyone along for ""The final trip"" as we have in the past."
1302770,Ogoki,2011-05-04 04:01:00,291,In less than a month I go to a work related school for two days . Return on a Wednesday evening . The next day I leave with 3 guys for a seven days of camping on a fly-in lake that has never had a cabin on it . Return on a Sunday evening and catch up at home . Leave on Thurday with my wife and labs for 8 days at Ogoki Reservoir . To top that off I have a bear hunt booked for August . All of this Lord Willing of course . Semi-retirement is GREAT !!!!!!!!!!!
1302807,Babamel2,2011-05-04 07:21:00,414,"Not me I never get pumped, actually dread the day. I know it is 67 till we get to come home. to make things worse I have been going through stuff now for several months making sure that horibble time up there will be as trouble free as possible reels greased, trailer in good shape, menus planned and all that horible stuff that bogs make life misserable prior to leaving. I do this to make that week go faster as we anticipate the day we can finally get out of that remote area back into civilization, with phone calls to cranky customers, overgrown lawns and grumpy neighbors. What a relief from being out there in the middle of no where."
1302846,tv4fish,2011-05-04 09:01:00,2694,UMMMM - Lately I don't think THAT is what is happening at the gas station.

In the next week or two, I will start replacing the line on my reels, last weekend, I oiled and greased the reels, I have my clothing and weather gear ready, been checking the ice-out blogs and web-cams. The sunny cool mornings are reminding me of a great morning on Lac Seul at Goose Bay Camp, warm breakfast to start the long day on the Lac, standing outside the cabin, warming my hands with a cup of coffee,looking out past the boat into the rising sun.... yes the walleye juices are flowing!"
1302366,nitrodude,2011-05-03 07:53:00,60,"54 days and counting down to my 16th consecutive year on LS!! Two new young men added to the group this year, my son and friend's grandson, will hopefully carry our tradition into the next generation. Our group originally started visiting the same place yearly in 1968 and four generations now have enjoyed it. I can't wait!!"
1302372,NemegosendaRiver,2011-05-03 07:57:00,66,"Our group has made the trip every year since 1975 and we have another generation joining us this year as well. Me, my brother, and my two cousins started going with our Dads and now we are starting to take our children (Our Dads still go). There is nothing better in the world."
1302377,camp chef,2011-05-03 08:08:00,915,16 days until we leave for brand new water.( Pipestone Lake )The four of us are actually a scouting party for the rest of our group. The whole group with the exception of me and my boat partner are headed back to Caribou in a few more weeks. There is nothing more fun than getting a chance to play on fresh water.
1302404,Knoxabilly,2011-05-03 08:50:00,225,Does a bear sit in the woods? I'm getting so excited...I'm taking 2 green horns this year! 24 days

1302424,BrianZ,2011-05-03 09:25:00,18,24 days until we leave. its ahrd to focus on anything else. i keep picturing the spots we will be fishing and imagining all different weather scenarios and how we will adapt to maximize the amount of fish landed.
1302433,Bjz23,2011-05-03 09:55:00,4,"18 days!!! Lake of Woods for the first time......Have been studying Google earth, Fishing Maps and marking my GPS for weeks now. Sounds like I wont need my auger thank god. I can taste that fresh Walleye already."
1302438,keek,2011-05-03 10:15:00,1003,38 days and I am so excited. We have our opener this weekend so that will only increase my obsession. Just ordered a spare prop and some rattlin rouges.
