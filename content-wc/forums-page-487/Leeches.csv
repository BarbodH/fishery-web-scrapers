Anyone have any recent experience purchasing this year and what's the quantity/LB cost currently? Any recommendations on Bait Shops would be greatly appreciated since I haven't been up there in 4 years or so. Thanks!"

1217366,fishman10,2010-07-08 19:32:00,226,"i just returned from sioux lookout. the current price is 35 in nw ontario. i just purchased a lb in the sioux because i ran out and had no choice. i was charged 45 and they are the smallest that i have ever seen. i wiill try to return them next week when i return. i didnt look at them as they were in a bag and was shocked when i got home. they were the only people that sold them by the pound and i would strongly recommend you buy them before getting to the sioux. i dont want to knock the seller, maybe it was just a bad batch, but i am being honest with you."
1217386,GNO,2010-07-08 20:25:00,153,"$35 is a real good price, where did you find those at?"
1217468,fishman10,2010-07-09 07:28:00,226,anywhere in the thunder bay area as well as verns in ignace.

1314477,jswinter40,2011-06-04 07:16:00,127,I have fished LS in the sioux lookout area for a number of years and we never buy leeches because they have always looked pathetic there. I would pick up prior to SL to be safe.
