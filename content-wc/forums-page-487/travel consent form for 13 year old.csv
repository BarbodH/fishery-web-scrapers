1313938,Guest,2011-06-02 12:37:00,0,I need to have a letter form my wife for me to take my son to canada with me. Does anyone if there is a form letter that I could copy to fill out with our information?
1313984,campchick,2011-06-02 14:39:00,96,Check with Canada Customs to be sure. In Fort Frances the number is 807-274-3655.

1314021,Obabikon,2011-06-02 17:16:00,2370,"Something like this... ""I _____ give my consent for Billy to travel with his father (Full Name) to ( ) Resort, ( ) Town, ( ) Province, Canada. Their trip will occure during these dates _____ _____ 2011. If you need, I can be reached at the following numbers. Work Home Cell Thanks, _______"" It doesn't need to be notarized, and I don't believe that will actually help in the situation. Don't forget his passport or birth certificate if he doesn't have one yet."

But I had a notarized permission letter with all their info including where and when we would be traveling. It came in handy when I got pinched for speeding way up in the Waswanipi area. It would have help to be able to speak French on that one!"
