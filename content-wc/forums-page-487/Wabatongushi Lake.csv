1314410,archie_james_c,2011-06-03 20:42:00,120,I'm working at a lodge up here at Wabatong. The eyes are still hanging around the shallower bays with outflowing rivers/creeks. Sub 8 FOW is the ticket right now and were doing very well rip jigging rocky points and shorelines and trolling rapala floating minnows and bombers...pics to follow.
