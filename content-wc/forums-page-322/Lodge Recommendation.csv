2910897,Simple Man,2014-06-18 14:11:00,92,"x2 for Clark's on Cedar. Great lake & great accomodations. Like Troutwater stated, you can always take a 1/2 day and cross the street to Cliff to target Lake Trout."
2911481,SinOrSwim,2014-06-18 15:55:00,1528,Easy with the dirty talk boys! This is a family site.
2911689,pale ryder,2014-06-18 16:51:00,1937,"X3 on Clark's, on Cedar or the Indian chain."
2911897,NARDA 1,2014-06-18 17:49:00,636,What Danbear said!!! My group will be there 8/23-8/30 for our 26th year and will help you anyway we can. Terry
2909025,eyezonz,2014-06-17 22:48:00,3,Please help starting to get overwhelmed. Looking to plan a trip to Canada this August. Can any one recommended a lodge cabin that encompasses the most of the following list.*big walleye *musky*bass*nothern*brook trout*lake troutwould like all species of fish to be present with out traveling away from lake by land*bait included* drive in* nice cabins* wifi* full kitchen* satellite tv would be nice but not necessarily neededalso the shorter the distance from international falls the betterthanks ahead of time
2909089,clearis,2014-06-17 23:39:00,47,"Given the number or species you are looking for, look at Lake of the Woods. To target that number of fish, plan a trip that is at least 10 days to 2 weeks."
2909169,Obabikon,2014-06-18 04:38:00,2370,"To narrow your search a little, I'd suggest the White Fish Bay area Sioux Narrows. They'd be the only area to have Lakers."
2909729,eyezonz,2014-06-18 08:45:00,3,Not really looking to target anything other than walleye and bass but I like incidental catches that's why all the others are listed.The four on the list I actually care about catching are* Walleye* Bass* Musky* Brook Trout
2909841,SinOrSwim,2014-06-18 09:28:00,1528,"what do you mean by full kitchen? In your cabin or meals included?I'll be interested seeing the responses on this. I'm making my first trip to Hawk Lake Lodge in August but other than Musky, brook trout and maybe the Satellite, I think they fit many of the parameters on that list? That is a very comprehensive list."
2909977,troutwater,2014-06-18 10:10:00,299,"Clark's on Cedar Lake has a lot of those options. Their upgrade cabins have TV, AC, and are really nice. Bait is also included in their packages. Would you be renting a boat? If so they have the best on the lake. Now the downside is that I'm not aware of any brook trout fishing in the area, and to fish lakers you'd have to pull the boat out and go across the street(like literally) to Cliff. Good luck in your search"
2910129,Danbear,2014-06-18 10:43:00,72,"Look into Birch Dale Lodge on Eagle Lake only 3 hours from I-Falls, has all the species but Brook Trout. Cabins have complete kitchens and they have a Steakhouse on property where you can eat at or take the meal plan. I would suggest taking at least the dinner only plan and prepare to get fed. We will be making our 7th trip to Birch Dale in August arriving on August 16th and if you come that week I will take you fishing myself no charge and show you some spots. Give Marcel a call at 1-807-227-5262 or check out their web site on the web or check them out on Facebook.Hope you find the place you desire.Danbear"
2910577,stumcfar,2014-06-18 13:02:00,451,"The only place I could recommend to cover your list best would be ""heaven"", but hopefully you are not ready to book that trip yet!"
2910633,fishinnut 3446,2014-06-18 13:24:00,638,"Danbear, You never took me out on a guided trip and showed me your honey holes"
2910793,elkman99,2014-06-18 13:48:00,180,You might look at Clark's Resort on the Indian Lake chain. It has everything you are asking for except for Brookies. satelite tv in the deluxe cabins and free bait. http://www.clarksresorts.com/
