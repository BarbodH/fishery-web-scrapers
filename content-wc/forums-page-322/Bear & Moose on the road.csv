2909185,PRO-V1,2014-06-18 04:54:00,142,Fishoil if you don't mind me asking where were did you end up fishing.? Mike
2909209,stjoeguy,2014-06-18 05:00:00,979,"Here'e the response I got from Pat, a fellow St. Joe fishing friend. We leave in 2 days!!!"
2909321,SinOrSwim,2014-06-18 06:32:00,1528,"LOL whatever! I drive the Canadian Speed Limit and nothing more. Two hands on the wheel at 10 and 2. Okay, maybe I go into some of those curves a little hot. I can understand not seeing much on the way up because we are always traveling from about noon til 3. But, teh way back we leave at dawn so the sun is just staring to come up."
2909329,tv4fish,2014-06-18 06:41:00,2694,MorganMan: Me thinks you need to remind SinOrSwim that the speed limit in Canada is KPH and not MPH..........
2909649,Fishoil,2014-06-18 08:11:00,1277,We fished Pashkokogan out of North Albany on this trip but took a ride to Pickle for some needed repair work on one of the guy's trucks.
2910593,stumcfar,2014-06-18 13:05:00,451,"From Vermillion Bay to Ear Falls we saw 6 moose on the way up, late evening, and 3 moose on the way home, early morning. Also probably a half dozen whitetail."
2911489,SinOrSwim,2014-06-18 15:58:00,1528,"We take that route to Onaway. Our guide last year couldn't believe I had never seen a moose. The year before my father in law went with us for the first time. He and the guy he was with had boat troubles so they went back. They came back out with a different boat and on the way watched a moose swim to shore, watched it get out, shake off and walk into the woods. WTF LOL I've been going over 20 years and haven't seen a glimpse and he gets that????"
2911753,rather-be-fishin,2014-06-18 17:08:00,429,"SinOrSwim ~ if you stay at Onaway Lodge and want to see Moose, take a very slow drive on 105 at dusk between the resort and Dutchies. Also stop in at Dutchies and ask the best spot to see them. We do this every year as a tradition. üòú There is a very good chance you will see a moose or two or more. Be sure to have your üì∑üìπ ready!üòÑüëç Only five weeks to go for our return trip to Lac Seul can't wait! üò¨ RBF"
2903857,stjoeguy,2014-06-16 14:56:00,979,I've heard from two groups that saw record numbers of bear and moose on Hwy 599 in NW Ontario last week. Has anyone else seen more than usual numbers? They also reported very high water and a lot of mosquitos. I wonder if the bugs are driving them out of the woods.
2904361,luv2fishcanada,2014-06-16 17:18:00,41,"Your information is correct. On way north we saw a couple moose along 502 and another 4 on 105 between Vermillion Bay and Gullrock. These were all during the day. No moose on the way home but several bears. I'm guessing part of it is to get out of the woods and the bugs which were horrible. There is water everywhere. Good luck on your trip north, I wouldn't want to do it at night."
2904633,Hewhocookstomuch,2014-06-16 18:50:00,66,"Trip starts tomorrow first leg. Meeting Stjoeguy at the Minneapolis Airport, check in with a friend who was at St. Joe last week to get a fishing report. Next Cabela's to stock up on gear. Then to guy's home three hours up the road . Next two days gathering supplies and packing for the long haul to Saint Joseph on Friday, arrive Saturday noon. Then wet lines, full report in two weeks. That is if we survive the squitors and flies."
2904897,Fishoil,2014-06-16 19:53:00,1277,Just this past Saturday I only saw one bear and no moose from Pashkokogan to Ignace. The Saturday before on the way up I saw 3 moose and a bear. A week before that a friend saw 11 moose in the same stretch. BTW: They're working on the bridge at Pash. They have stop lights set up but it won't cost you much time. The rest of 599 is in good shape all the way to Pickle. Have a great trip!!
2905665,REG,2014-06-17 06:37:00,445,"Couple of weeks ago on the northern part of 502 - saw 2 moose on the way up - and both were crossing the road. It was raining pretty good for that stretch. On the way back on the northern part of 105, we saw 8 moose. Granted, we start back pretty early in the morning, but 8 was a record for us. Luckily, all were happy to stay off the road. As others have said, the skeeters were out much earlier and much thicker than usual for the time of year."
2906441,Draco1206,2014-06-17 10:11:00,175,"We saw 3 moose on our way up to Nakina, 2 moose on the lake we were on and 7 moose on the way home. That's about double what we usually see. We also saw 4 or 5 bears which is about normal for us."
2906697,SinOrSwim,2014-06-17 11:01:00,1528,I have been going up for 20 years and have never seen a **** moose. Been a few years since I have seen a bear. Going up twice this year so hopefully we see one when I have my son with me.
2907233,Mike Kansas,2014-06-17 12:59:00,1463,"We saw four Moose, one Bear a Fox and at least 7 Deer on the way up last week. Saw three more Moose and the first Wolf ever on the lake. Coming home we saw nothing but I bet some saw us. It has to be the Mosquitos...they were everywhere last week. Mike Kansas"
2908793,5thsuit,2014-06-17 21:09:00,54,"We had one bear travel thru our camp, one on our portage and another up on the Cobham. First bear we have seen in this area in 4 trips. Over the last 30 years we always see moose around Ear Falls roadway."
2908857,MorganMan,2014-06-17 21:31:00,341,"I have never seen a moose either? This is year 21 or 22? That's ridiculous. Last couple years I was driving. Other years, riding with SinOrSwim and let me tell you, no sleeping as it's one of the scariest rides on the planet. Truck is all over the place trying to keep all 4 wheels on the ground.....yikes!"
