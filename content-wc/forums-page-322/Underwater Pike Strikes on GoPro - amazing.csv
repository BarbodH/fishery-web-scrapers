2913145,Brandonkop,2014-06-19 00:55:00,124,"Watch as Northern Pike Attack a jointed Salmo Crankbait Underwater. I built an underwater housing to troll with and tried it out for the first time. This is what happened. Filmed at Floatingstone Lake with clear water and the fish were on the prowl. Check out how these water wolves track and pounce on the helpless plug. Personally this is the most epic underwater fishing film I've created this year. Check it out, lots of action and some surprises that I never would have expected if I didn't see it myself.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUXdhg8gCL0"
2913169,WiGuy,2014-06-19 03:42:00,4,That was really cool. Hard to understand how they can wolf the bait down and still not get hooked.
2913249,wesman40,2014-06-19 05:16:00,45,Verycool video. Can you post a video or pic of the housing.
2913401,boof,2014-06-19 06:24:00,115,That is awesome. What is going on here with your housing? How are you capturing this footage?
2913425,Bigstorm,2014-06-19 06:45:00,799,were the hooks removed? Seems like a lot a strikes with no hook ups.
2916025,Brandonkop,2014-06-19 15:39:00,124,Unfortunately someone already has a patent on a trolling case for go pro and sells them for a pretty penny but they are pretty inexpensive to make. I'll make a video on how I built it in the near future since I might make another one. But for now here are some pics.http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a3...524_005541.jpghttp://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a3...524_145157.jpghttp://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a3...526_141555.jpg
2916033,Brandonkop,2014-06-19 15:42:00,124,"The hook had two barbed trebles on it right out of the package. Since this is a downrigger set up, you don't hold the rod. It sits in a rod holder. I noticed the rod bounce a few of the times when they would hit but then they would be off so fast couldn't even grab the rod. This was only from about an hour of fishing and two of the fish out of all the strikes were actually hooked. I think the proximity to the boat and being only a few feet from a downrigger ball and the camera shown has something to do with their precaution. Because my brother was just dragging a crankbait and he doubled my hits and fish to the boat. I was just doing this to get video, its not to catch fish. The enjoyment comes after from watching what happened down there."
2917881,reconssd,2014-06-20 06:48:00,147,Put a number 5 rattling J-Plug on the line and get ready for some rod bending action. Just make sure you extend the back treble hook. This ensures more hook ups because the treble is at the end of the lure. Any color works. Fire tiger and blue chrome have been my best producers. Very cool video.
