2916833,fergiefish,2014-06-19 19:06:00,197,"Matt, What types of lures do you use and what depths do you typically find the big northerns?"
2917049,flntknp17,2014-06-19 20:22:00,151,"Virtually any of the non ridiculously huge muskie lures are good.....mostly because very few people are willing or able to throw them on Lac Seul because (on the west end at least) everyone comes to fish walleyes....just my $0.02. Also, I believe that location is far more important than absolute depth. Need to find places that are prime feeding locations.......think of the way a house cat finds a location in a home that is safe, yet from where they can see everything that goes on. Current also matters because it often shows in bottle necks and these matter as much for catching big pike as they do in shooting a big deer for the same reasons. I'll post some baits I use often. They're generally muskie baits. I like gliders and swimbaits best. You can see the Storm Giant Flat Stick for scale....it's about 9"" or so. All the hooks are replaced with Owners because the stock muskie hooks are almost always not optimal for pike even on good lures. Good lures include, but are certainly not limited to muskie sized bucktails, gliders (I like the **** Hound best), swimmers like the Spro BBZ, BIG paddle tails, grandma lures, jakes, etc. http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...ps5003b0a7.jpg Hope this helps. Matt"

Can't recommend it enough if you fish the Ear Falls area or English/Wenasaga River system. I've been a regular at Gold Pines since about 1985 and can't say enough good things about it. I'll be there starting July 5.....only a couple weeks! I've been going in September for several years, but am switching it up a little this year. Matt"
2898145,Guest,2014-06-14 21:25:00,0,We've stayed at Gold Pines for the last 10 years and wouldn't think of staying anywhere else. We go up the first week of June and had another great year. Peter & family are great hosts and even better people. Good luck to all!
2900297,fergiefish,2014-06-15 17:32:00,197,"Matt, Sorry we will miss you. I will leave a report for you. What cabin will you have?"
2901129,flntknp17,2014-06-15 21:48:00,151,"Can't remember the number.....I typically go with just one other person and stay in the little one by the main dock, but taking six of us this time so we are in the four bedroom one next to the main lodge. When will you leave? I'll likely be there at a good time Saturday morning. Good luck! Matt"
2901425,fergiefish,2014-06-16 05:04:00,197,Unfortunately we leave at 5 AM to get on the road and beat the rush to the border. We will have to watch out for moose at that time. What areas do you like to fish at that time of the year? We typically are in the Steamboat area and will be taking at least a couple of runs to Mackenzie Bay. We will be buying a flat of crawlers and a pound of leaches and hopefully miss the mayfly hatch.
2902689,shagookin,2014-06-16 10:16:00,5,"We are coming to Gold Pines for the first time this Saturday... We can't wait! We hear nothing but good things! Looking forward to catching some fish. There are 4 of us with two boats.. any suggestions on where to catch some large Pike?? Like to catch walleyes, but LOVE to catch big pike! John"
2903369,fergiefish,2014-06-16 13:01:00,197,"We have never found the big Northerns on the west end (40 plus), but I have to say that we never specifically target them. We will typically find good eaters on the weed edges, and an occasional slot fish. I think the larger fish are hanging a little deeper than we typically fish. I will be using my electronics to find deep humps and try a little harder for some larger pike. Anyone that fishes that time frame on the west end have any better luck?"
2904841,flntknp17,2014-06-16 19:33:00,151,"I go mainly for pike and I promise the slot+ fish are there. Can't fish the same way you do for smaller pike and expect to see too many big ones.....they just don't behave same most of the year. We saw and had on a fish I would estimate at 46"" last September.....got off at boatside and has haunted me for 8 months. I'll be back in three weeks! I would suggest four things: If you've found lots of 12""-18"" walleyes, you're probably near a big pike Fish deeper and in more current you're likely doing now during the summer Fish big, main-lake structure and don't get too worried about finding weeds, macro structure > micro structure Fish muskie sized lures....no more 3"" silver minnows if you want to see 40"" fish with consistency I've put a lot of work in to Lac Seul pike and it won't ever be Wollaston or Reindeer, but I can drive there in a day and it is still very good. 20 years (or however long its been....can't remember) of the slot has been just the ticket for pike there. Matt"
2905233,fergiefish,2014-06-16 21:32:00,197,"We have found plenty of the 15-18"" eyes, but I am sure the smaller baits I am using for the northerns are not to the big girls fancy. I do not typically carry a lot of big musky baits but have large spinner baits as well as bucktails. What are your favorite baits for the pike? What depths are you finding the bigger fish. I know you will be coming up the week after I do, and I will have similar conditions."
2906065,shagookin,2014-06-17 08:04:00,5,"I have fished the east end of lac seul for the past two years, casting until I cramped up for Musky.... Have caught some nice pike over there, but haven't broke the magic 40 inch yet. I appreciate the help... will try larger structure... thought with the warm up coming the big girls might be laying up in the shallow bays at the end of the day... pitch some large spoons and hard baits up there and see if any thing explodes! May try some dead bait (suckers/ciscos) at some feeder creeks and streams, to see if I can catch a large pike cruising in 12-15 foot of water. Are there many musky on the west end of the lake? The long term goal is to catch a 40""+ pike, but only two 39 1/2 fish so far! If I can consistently catch fish in the 32-35 inch size, that would be great.... John"
2896281,fergiefish,2014-06-14 06:26:00,197,"Heading up to Lac Seul in two weeks and will be staying at Gold Pines Camp. We have been going there for years and can't say enough good things about the fishing and our wonderful hosts. This is the one time of the year that can't come soon enough, and after arriving in camp, goes way too fast. Here is to safe travels, fabulous eating of fresh fish, and company of good friends."
2896521,Pooch,2014-06-14 08:03:00,4619,"fergiefish,Have you ever read the history behind that area of Gold Pines? Pretty interesting and it seems of historic activity. I've never been to the camp, but years ago read a book on the history of Lac Seul. Gold Pines played a fairly significant part of the early trade in Ontario.PoochPooch"
2896537,South Dakota,2014-06-14 08:09:00,24,Hey Pooch do you remember the name of that book? It sounds interesting! Thx
2896793,bigwalleye1,2014-06-14 09:39:00,2632,X2. I'm very interested as well in the early history of the area.
2896857,geomax,2014-06-14 09:58:00,29,"I dont have all the books by memory but ""the gold rush to red lake"" and ""the second gold rush to red lake"" by D.F. Parrott have quite a bit of history. The first book would likely best include the area around goldpines as it was a major transfer point where goods where brought over ice on lac seul from Hudson and then up to the Mines of the Woman lake and Red Lake area. I think the first one touches on the Ear Falls Dam as well which again has much history."
2896905,Pooch,2014-06-14 10:26:00,4619,"It's called ""Yesterday the River"" by Rae Kiebuzinski. I believe she was from Ear Falls and you might be able to find a copy in that area. I found mine on Amazon several years ago.Good luck. It's a very good read for a history buff.Pooch"
2897265,Guest,2014-06-14 13:08:00,0,"The hosts at Gold Pines, Peter and Christa and Bill and Helen, must be doing something right. They have a waiting list for people to rent cabins. I can't get in in the week that we have vacation. Maybe there is a vacancy up at Gull Rock. I don't want to pass them by but, even in January when I made the first call, they were booked up. I couldn't commit to a specific week last year because there was a surgery involved."
2897321,fergiefish,2014-06-14 13:44:00,197,"I have read a little about the history. Gold Pines actually has a book on the subject although I can not remember if is the same author. I will have to spend a little more time reading their book this year. You are correct in regards to Peter, Christa, Bill, and Helen. Pete and Bill are there every morning to greet you as you go to the dock, and usually there when you come back to camp to help you dock your boat. I love watching Bill get garbed up with a vintage life vest and take the fish remains to the island to feed the eagles. My only issue is that I wish that I could spend another week at camp. I am working my way to retirement, and then I should be able to accomplish that goal."
2897393,Hump,2014-06-14 14:52:00,578,"If Gold PINES IS FULL, CHECK OUT EVERGREEN. NICE CAMP, NICE BOATS"
2897689,muskyroller,2014-06-14 17:40:00,56,"If you are set on being up in the Ear Falls area, give Evergreen a shout! Great boats/motors, good docks, good accommodations. Plus, Gary is awesome...great stories, outstanding knowledge of the area, and will put you on fish."
