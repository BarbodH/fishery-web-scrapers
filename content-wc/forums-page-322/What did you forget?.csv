2908801,grizzley,2014-06-17 21:12:00,2518,Couple years ago we drove up to a local river on the first day of trout. When we got there I realized I had forgotten the boots for my boot foot waders and had to drive back home to get them. Got back there an hour after opening time and still got limits.
2908833,MorganMan,2014-06-17 21:26:00,341,"Good grief, I forget something every year. Last year was a my boots. My Bogs, that are slip on and waterproof. Year before that was a coat to wear under my rain bibs.......year after year there is always something. Never fishing gear though!!!! Most years forget one or two of the grocery items too! Lists and more lists, yet something doesn't make the trip. There is some beer drinking as I get it all ready???!!!?? Could that be it? We make do with what makes the trip."
2909337,MrSimon,2014-06-18 06:46:00,922,"When doing fly-ins or staying at outposts, forgetting something important can be really bad. I'm so paranoid that I make a very detailed list .... organize everything in a giant pile in the garage .... go through everything at least twice ... then load it all up at once. It seems like the transfer of stuff from truck to plane ... or truck to boats (heading to outpost) is where we forget things. Things that often get left in the truck .... sunglasses, hat, camera, charging cord etc etc."

2906257,fishinnut 3446,2014-06-17 09:19:00,638,"I would say I'm pretty good most years and take enough cash for the little things we forget, but 1 year I forgot ALL my Musky lures () So we went to Canadian tire and Bobbies and spent our enough cash !!!!!!!!!!"

2906425,oleJoe,2014-06-17 10:09:00,114,"well this year on a fly-in we forgot 3 large nets and my locater. We remembered the nets and stopped and bought 3 but didn't realize I left the locater at home till we un packed. No problem we knew the lake and was just at ice out. When I got home there it was on the shelf in the laundry room, where I put it after changing batteries. I never put anything on that shelf either!!!!!"
2906449,SinOrSwim,2014-06-17 10:17:00,1528,"I actually made a spreadsheet with all my gear listed. I have a column for the item and then I have a column for ""have"", ""get"" and ""packed"". I purposely don't pack everything til the last minute. It all gathers in my office and makes quite the mess starting a couple weeks before we leave. (wife hates this btw). Then, the morning of or night before everything goes in totes etc. That way, I know in my head and that I marked it off the list right before we leave. If I pack too early, I have a fear I might pack it but then one of my kids or someone will take soemthign out and not put it back. It should be noted, I had this system in place when I forgot my pillow though. LOL But, I figure at least I won't leave something major like rods or tacklet etc."
2906593,tv4fish,2014-06-17 10:42:00,2694,"SinOrSwim: Sounds like we are similar - I have a checklist -- broken down to: Items in boat -------- Items in truck (tow vehicle) ------- clothing ------food ----- beverages -----snacks. For some reason - that darn list gets ""added to"" every year."
2906681,SinOrSwim,2014-06-17 10:59:00,1528,"Yep, mine has sections within the list. Like, clothes, toiletries, Gear, Tote Items and then shared items. Certain things I have like a battery bilge etc go in a public tote and some stuff goes in my private tote. Oh, and I take WAY TOO MUCH!! LOL"
2906737,patricktjms,2014-06-17 11:10:00,67,Does the pillow have a spot on the list also?
2906905,SinOrSwim,2014-06-17 11:41:00,1528,Yes. My list is good. It's the the person in charge of the list that was the issue.
2906921,patricktjms,2014-06-17 11:44:00,67,I would like to see this list. So I could make one of my own.
2907521,The Donger,2014-06-17 14:45:00,48,Not a darn thing. We took way too much
2901841,patricktjms,2014-06-16 07:11:00,67,"So its happened to everyone. You get to Canada, start unpacking or setting up the boat, and you realize, ""Crap!!! I forgot the _____!!!"" What important piece have you forgot over the years? Camera? Tackle box? Net? Money? Beer?"
2901905,btyreprich,2014-06-16 07:27:00,1067,"Over the years I have neglected to bring a few grocery items - eggs, onions, etc.Luckily there are two grocery stores in Ear Falls but it can be a pain getting off the lake early enough to make it to the store before it closes.My buddy and his son forgot their life jackets one year so it was a ""mad dash"" to Gander Mountain in Duluth before the store closed! Made it to the store with like 10 minutes to spare!"
2902033,SinOrSwim,2014-06-16 07:56:00,1528,"I forgot a pillow one year. We drive up to my brothers north of the cities the first night. I noticed it then. So, on the way up the next day we stopped at Walmart for some stuff and I bought a new one. Then, we drive up to Sioux Lookout and we used to stay at the bunkhouse at Red Pine Lodge before flying out the next morning. Some how..........some way I forgot it AGAIN!!!!!! Got to the cabin and didn't have a pillow. I ended up using a skanky throw pillow from one of the couches. Wrapped in a sweatshirt. Thank goodness I was drunk and wasn't thinking about what my head was laying on. LOL"
2902313,Tx Jig tyr,2014-06-16 09:16:00,140,"Once we left without the fishing rod case, did a U turn and drove an extra 150miles that trip. Another time a friend forgot the drain plug for his boat, not bad, except it was not the ""usual"" size. ended up using a thermos jug plug for the week!"
2902625,Carnhzkr,2014-06-16 10:05:00,964,"We weren't staying at a lodge, but a camping area with no amenities. My mom had packed my dad's duffel, but forgot to put it in the camper (of course it's mom's responsibility to pack everything except the fishing gear - that's my dad's only responsibility). My dad spent the entire week in the underwear, socks, & pants he left home in. My mom had one over-sized sweatshirt she loaned him - it was light blue with a teddy bear on the front. We still have a few pictures of dad in his filthy blue teddy bear shirt."
2902865,imafishslayer,2014-06-16 10:44:00,64,Shoes.When we left Chicago it was 80 degrees and I had my sandals on. Forgot to bring extra shoes and when we got up there it was 40 and raining all week. Had to make a run to int'l falls to find a KMart.Sent from my DROID RAZR HD using Tapatalk
2903945,Simple Man,2014-06-16 15:28:00,92,"Forgot my passport last year and had to have my wife Fedex it to the hotel in Ifalls. She was not very happy with me when I called her and needless to say reminded me in her own special way how much of a dumbazz I was....LOL. It all worked out though. The lady at the front desk of the hotel said they get ""many"" Fedex packages with passports each summer."
2903977,Live to jig,2014-06-16 15:36:00,159,We stay in a hotel before heading into the bush....of course forgot my body wash in the shower in the hotel so got to use Dawn all week....little rough on the hair but the walleye didn't seem to mind.
2904089,port1042,2014-06-16 15:58:00,509,"Last fall we arrived at the lodge, unloaded the car, and were on the lake by mid-afternoon. We were back for dinner about 8:00pm. I opened the refrigerator and that was the first I realized I had forgotten the steaks, brats, tater tots and a bunch of other frozen stuff. I guess I took one bag out the freezer when I packed the cooler but not both. I did have a box of Eggo's and a couple of frozen microwave breakfasts! I'm still living that one down."
2906185,CMesserschmidt,2014-06-17 08:58:00,1006,"I will never forget the time me, my dad, and grandpa left for the north woods from the cities. We got about 45 minutes from the house and I hear my grandpa drop the F bomb which rarely happened. We looked at him and he just started busting out laughing.He says I forgot my dam teeth!!!! We had to turn around and head back to his house so he could grab his dentures HAHA!! We were all busting a gut the whole time.One of my fondest memories and it comes up a lot. Sure do miss him, but it's memories like that, that we will never forget about him."
