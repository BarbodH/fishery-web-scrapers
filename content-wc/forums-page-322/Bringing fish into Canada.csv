Any special rules apply to bringing fish into Ontario? Fresh, but frozen solid as a rock right now. Any thoughts I should concern myself with? Thanks."
2901593,ftfarms,2014-06-16 06:04:00,444,I would leave them at home. That's a pretty gray area.

So long as you have a license from the states to cover them, and they're able to be identified and counted, and legal-like for transport within your home state, I'd do it. Frozen 40 fillets in a block??? Mmmm, not so much."

You maybe want to weigh the advantages of bringing in vs the possibly of an agonizing amount of hours you may have to spend explaining your attempt to do your friend a favor. And then maybe have to pay a fine. All officers also may not see your generous offer in a like manner, which could be good or bad, etc. Vs venison - probably would not be bringing in half of a deer.
