I know that crawlers produce and there are fish everywhere but want to find a hog! Any pointers on locations or presentations are appreciated. Boys are pumped for first trip. Me too! Be safe everyone"

Fish jig/minnow and fish slow. Look for drop offs, humps ,long points and fish the windy sides. Might also do some bottom bouncing with crawlers to help locate fish. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
