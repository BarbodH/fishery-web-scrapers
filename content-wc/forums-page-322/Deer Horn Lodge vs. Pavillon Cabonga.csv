2589217,Fishing Guy,2014-03-24 12:19:00,8,"Hi Everyone! I would really appreciate your opinions and comparisons between Deer Horn Lodge and Pourvoirie Pavillon Cabonga.A Little Background: I fished on the Cabonga Reservoir a bunch of times around 1990. We always caught lots of walleye and pike. My main interest was pike and we usually caught 10-35 pounders back then. From what I can tell, the bigger sizes aren't there anymore. Can anyone confirm that? I use to stay in a cabin that I think was government run. It no longer exists. I've decided to try my luck on Cabonga this June and wanted to get your reviews. It will probably be me and a buddy.My Questions to YouIs it worth the extra long drive to Deer Horn Lodge?How do the facilities compare?Pavillon Cabonga is right near the highway. Does that make a big difference in terms of the area around the outfitter being ""fished out?""Do I need a 4x4 for the Deer Horn Lodge road (or can my regular car make it)?How has the pike fishing been over the last 2-3 years?I will be renting a boat and motor. When I use to go, my friends had their own 150 horsepower motors and they got to the ""spots"" easily while it would take an hour for us with a rented 15 horsepower motor. Is it the same at these 2 places?Are the owners/managers of each of these places friendly and sincere or just money hungry and trying to sell you every little thing they can (like so many outfitters I've been to lately, sadly)?I'm trying to get clear on whether they offer the American Plan. I was at the Montreal Fishing/Hunting show a few weeks ago and I had a very brief chat with someone at the Pavillon Cabonga booth. She said they do cook for you but then someone told me you needed a minimum of 10 people. Can anyone offer clarification on that? Thank you guys so much. I sincerely appreciate all of your input. If anyone wants to join us, let me know! I remember those waters getting a little rough and how the islands made it very easy to get lost. Not to mention hitting rocks and such several times, killing the prop, etc. I think it's best to have a second boat to watch each other's backs."
2589345,Guest,2014-03-24 13:12:00,0,"It's been a few years since our group has fished Cabonga. We always stayed at Deerhorn and really liked the camp. Steve Hamel was running it back then and now I believe it's being run by his nephew. I felt we got good value for our money at the lodge but always had a problem with the park fee that we got no value from. The fishing over the years was good. Pike was better before the large drawdowns due to the water companies. We usually could manage a couple pike in 36 to forty inch class and many smaller. Cabonga has sauger, (red phase), golden walleye, blue phase walleye, and some that are very dark. My largest was 30 inches and in the good years 20 inches was about average. We stopped going because of the drawdowns that skrewed up the forage base and killed some of our best spots. It may be that the level has been stable for several years and I would like to go back in the future. I know that section quite well. They offer an American plan. The road in (17 mi) can be rough (washboard) but you can make it with two wheel drive going slowly (25-30 mph). We're from Southern Pa and never thought the drive was too long. (12 plus hrs) Take a guide and try lake trout. We did that once and on our own from then on. It's a long run to deep water but I'm very good at remembering waterways. Fished lead core and caught trout to 10 pounds. (they come much larger. We also caught them at walleye depth. (12 to 15 ft) trolling hot n tots just off the deep water. Can't help with Pavillion but have heard Deerhorn was better. Good fish can be had close to camp but the further you travel the better it gets. We fished to about 15 to 20 miles from camp and I can see it like the back of my hand. Good Luck and report back."

2589617,emanonmac,2014-03-24 14:43:00,62,"I've stayed at both places and found Deer Horn to be the better. No Indians and their dogs crapping outside your cabin so you can smell it all night. Cabins at Deer Horn are in better shape and never had a problem worrying about any equipment or food going missing while fishing or sleeping. Didn't make it up last year but the previous year (2012) the water level was fine. The year before it was way down to the point where Steve had to move some docks around for boats to tie up on. I understand it was rough going if you tried to make it to the big water for Lake Trout with the level so low. From the pictures that are posted for last year, it appears the level was down again. Going up the 3rd weekend in June and staying at Cabin # 18. Hope the water level is good this year or I'm going to be giving up on Cabonga."
2592617,joepa,2014-03-25 08:39:00,366,"Minnow: We used to go to Pavillon Cabonga but found the fishing was much better near the Deer Horn area. At Pavillon, you have to put up with the Indian's dogs which will be in your boat at night, eat anything that resembles food, including nightcrawlers and salted minnows. If there are any containers that have a food odor, they will be damaged by the dogs. Also, the dogs sometime leave their scent which leaves a very unpleasant odor in your boat. The Indians, especially the younger generation, are a royal pain in the butt. They drink most of the day and fly around in their boats creating havoc. It was especially disturbing to fish all day and catch a few fish, and then see a boat load of Indians head down the lake in the evening, and within a half hour, come back with a boatload of walleyes. We had our cabin broken into twice with various things missing when we returned. Most of the time they were after money especially any change left in the cabin. We always took our wallets with us. Deer Horn was so much better! If the government would stop messing with the water levels, that area could be one of the best for walleyes. Watch out if the water level is down, and I mean as much as 9 feet! I also agree on the daily park fees. They are ridiculous! Steve's nephew will help in any way! Nice guy! Go slow going in for the 18 miles to DH. I cracked the windshield on my truck by going just a little too fast!"
2592689,Fishing Guy,2014-03-25 08:56:00,8,"This is really helpful info. Thank you! If there's anyone else who'd like to share their experiences, that would be great!"
2601161,Fishing Guy,2014-03-27 09:25:00,8,Do you pay the park fees to Deer Horn Lodge or before you enter?
2601217,Fishing Guy,2014-03-27 09:32:00,8,"I seem to recall that back in the day when I fished Cabonga, the Indians were the only ones allowed to use drift nets. I think that was the case so correct me if I'm off. So between their excellent fishing skills and the nets, they caught more."
2602337,emanonmac,2014-03-27 13:04:00,62,Park fees and fishing license fee can be paid at their store when you check out.
2617618,still fishin',2014-03-30 22:50:00,69,"FG, We fished DHL every year since 2001 except 2012. We went to Cabonga Lodge last year. The fishing has been below average since 2009. We had several 50+ fish days ( not everyday- but at least one each year). From 2009 on, we've had none. Not that it's terrible every day; some days 10 fish, some days 2. We're going back to DHL this year but if we have another slow year we'll have to look at other options especially if the water level is low again (it was fine last year). The staff at both places have been helpful. I understand that no one can control the fishing. Maybe the tactics and spots we fish have worn out but when everyone in camp has similar results I tend to think its the fishing and not the fishermen. The pike have also seemed to disappear. We used to catch them while targeting walleye routinely. Now we catch very few even when targeting them. Good luck fishing up there. No matter how bad the fishing was, I never came back from Canada wishing I had stayed home. I hope your experience is similar."
2833937,Fishing Guy,2014-05-26 11:27:00,8,I called Deer Horn Lodge to make a reservation. They said they're booked until July and that it's best to reserve and pay the deposit by Christmas (6 months earlier!) to get a spot. Apparently they have a lot of regulars who fill June quickly. I asked if they have an American plan and the guy said they do not. You have to bring your own food.
2833969,Fishing Guy,2014-05-26 11:38:00,8,"Since Deer Horn Lodge is full, we're considering Pavillon Cabonga. Does anyone have any recent info on them? Are the dogs and all of that from ages ago or is that like last summer? Other than that, we'll take other suggestions for anywhere we an drive to in the area to get large pike. Thank you!"
2834057,Fishing Guy,2014-05-26 12:18:00,8,Pavillon Bark Lake is on the same body of water. Anyone have reviews of that place? Thank you!
2835569,Guest,2014-05-27 04:31:00,0,"I can't recall anyone who has considered Cabonga mentioning Dorval lodge which is on the Dozois reservoir, equally as large as Cabonga and not far above Cabonga right on highway 117. That being said, I must admit that I have not fished there. Years ago I had back and forth messages on this site with a guy who went by the call name ""genty"" who was familiar with both Cabonga and Dozois, and claimed Dozois was better. If I were to try the Dozois out of Dorval lodge, I would probably hire a guide for a day. Take a look at there website, or maybe there are some on this board who could comment."
2905985,eatsleepfish,2014-06-17 07:50:00,52,"Hey, we are headed up the following week and we'll be in the same cabin so don't stink it up! We didn't go last year, either but looking forward to this year. Water levels look good, too. 360 meters according to:http://ottawariver.ca/reservoir-levels-discharges.php"
2615882,cnydave,2014-03-30 16:10:00,33,"I have fished both camps and agree with most, the facilities etc. are better at deer horn. The fishing has gone down hill the last few yrs. as a result of low water etc. in the res.Normally most people pay for the park permit at deer horn itself. And yes , it is a rip off , Steve Hammel was a great outfitter and his nephew has the same attitude , The best fishing is the last few hrs. before dark , the problem is knowing enough to leave an area that you are catching fish at soon enough to get back to camp. It is very easy to get turned around on this water when it gets almost dark. Do not ask how i know this !!!!!!!!!When ever i stayed at deer horn i always went to barrier lake , you will pass it just before getting to deer horn on the road going in. We always caught more fish and bigger fish at Barrier. I have had some great trips here in the 80's & 90's but based on my last few trips i will not be going back. As far as the indians they are a hair shy of a pig , they steal from your vehicals when parked at Barrier and definitly do take care of woods etc. Maybe things will improve but untill they do i will fish other outfitters and bodies of water. I may try the Dozis Res. this yr. to see if this is any better than deer horn. Steve & his nephew are great people , but , they have no control over the water levels on the cabonga or Barrier."
