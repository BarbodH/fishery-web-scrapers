2907105,shortmag,2014-06-17 12:32:00,70,"Try to learn how to use a steele. Usually, 3 or four strokes and you're good to go. It does take technique but well worth the time to learn. Got practice as a young man skinning 14,000 mink per season. Seems like a lifetime ago but the skill has served me well."
2907217,Kartman35,2014-06-17 12:57:00,245,"A steel is a useful tool in realigning the edge of soft metal blades that go out of alignment during use. The steel will straighten and align an already sharp edge when used properly, but it will never take a dull edge and make it sharp. The little ceramic 'sharpeners' that are often packaged with filet knives perform the same task."

2844113,Gregking,2014-05-29 07:28:00,2658,"Cabelas is where I got mine but Amazon sells them. I bought it because of all my deer knives. I found out how awesome it works and did all my knives. It takes awhile to get the edge back in shape but once it's done all you need to do is maintain. Did the kitchen knives also. Make sure to tell your wife, mine kind of freaked out, said she almost cut her arm off. Idk about that, she was stretching it quite a bit."
2844153,Gregking,2014-05-29 07:31:00,2658,"FYI, if your in a hurry I would go with a belt sander sharpener, forgot the name but I saw it at scheels over the winter. I like the sound of a blade on stone. Plus I'm trying to slow my life down tired of running around at Mach chicken all the time."

But I use the wifes fancy chefs choice more often than I care to admit. Almost as good and a lot less time spent sharpening. http://tinyurl.com/okh53wd She won it a trade show raffle a couple years ago and I was assigned the task of learning to use it. She has the professional model which is the same except a bigger motor and is a heavier duty model. The price seems high but when you buy as many stones as I have, if you add it all together it is probably a better deal to buy the sharpening system. That 3rd stage polishing makes a big difference in sharpening and durability of the edge I carry a set of crok sticks http://tinyurl.com/jw5d6kj to keep the edge tuned during use. Some say you can use them to sharpen but I use mine to true and deburr the edge. Of course, I have a dozen or so fillet knives and keep em all sharp and trade off if one gets dull. Beer drinking and knife sharpening is not a recommended activity."

2899977,Kartman35,2014-06-15 15:20:00,245,"In the OP one of the poster's questions was about how to sharpen a knife. If you actually want to learn how to sharpen on stones, there are lots of youtube videos on knife sharpening, but by far the best is a series done by Jon Broida, the owner a Venice California shop called Japanese Knife Imports. Jon has lived and studied knife repair and sharpening for many years in Japan and his techniques come directly from hundreds of years of traditional Japanese sharpening. After watching this series and with a little practice, anyone who has the manual dexterity to tie a fishing knot can effectively put an edge on a knife using simple bench stones. It is simply THE best way to sharpen knives, while removing the least amount of metal and it can be fun too. Be sure to watch the individual videos that talk about how to hold a knife while sharpening as well as movements, tip sharpening, flattening, double bevel basics, burrs and burr formation, angles of approach and thinning as well as any lectures regarding double bevel knives. (double bevel means sharpened similarly on both sides where single bevel is hollow on the back as in traditional sushi knives).http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEBF55079F53216AB Regarding your Cutco knife, it shouldn't be any harder to sharpen than any other quality stainless steel. The steel is in fact softer than most quality German blades and not that much harder than Rapala knives. As far as the gizmos mentioned in this thread so far...the Lansky is probably the best choice as it's small and easy to take on fishing trips with you. A fancier version for more dollars is the Edgepro. An excellent unit, but not long after getting one I bought some waterstones and haven't touched it since. Much rather sharpen freehand now. Stay sharp!!"
2903041,troutwater,2014-06-16 11:44:00,299,Thanks for the great info! I'll for sure check out those videos. How long does it take you to get your filet knife sharp freehand?
2905385,Kartman35,2014-06-17 00:32:00,245,"About five or ten minutes I guess. A filet knife and most western knives in general (German and french chef's knives) are made of relatively soft steel and for this reason do not benefit much from a high level of polish. A medium abrasive stone such as a 1000-2000 or so grit Japanese synthetic waterstone is all that's needed regarding polishing. These stones are abrasive enough that as long as there's no significant damage to the blade (big chips) you can raise a burr on both sides and be done in five or ten minutes. If ever there's lots of damage, I'll use a more abrasive stone first (400 grit) and that will take an extra five minutes or so. All that's needed to get started is a stone in the 1000-2000 grit range. Lower grits are useful for repairing damage, but are too abrasive when you're learning as any mistake becomes damage quickly. Finer is useless on soft steel. If you over polish a blade it will slice paper beautifully and shave armhair but won't have enough 'bite' to cut food well. You can also use American natural stones mined in the Ouachita mountains of Arkansas, however these take much longer to sharpen on as somehow they are less abrasive for any grit range. For example a surgical black arkansas stone will polish to a level similar to a 5000 grit waterstone yet it will take about 3-5 times as long to finish using the Arkansas stone. One thing that's cool about the Arkansas stones though is that they stay flat. Waterstones need to be flattened often using a either a diamond flattening plate (easiest but pricey) or a flattening stone(half the price of the diamond plate but may eventually need flattening too) or you can buy drywall screen and set it on a flat surface (tile or granite counter top). Oh yeah and don't miss the video regarding the magic marker trick if you're gonna try freehand sharpening. Essential for learning to hold a consistent angle."

2837185,MikeinMN,2014-05-27 11:51:00,190,"I'm also a big fan of the Edgemaker. I have an older set I bought from the owner of the company some time ago at the Northwest Sports Show when they used to have a booth there. I have used Lansky also, and that system does get a knife just as sharp, but I prefer Edgemaker for simplicity."

2838601,walleyeduran,2014-05-27 17:39:00,286,"Once your knife is sharp, I just use the hone side on the edgemaker and it keeps the blade clean. But, I fillet my fish without cutting any bones so that might help a lot."
2838729,markb11,2014-05-27 18:18:00,196,I'm terrible at sharpening so I bought a new 3 stage chef's choice on ebay for less than $20..it was a two year old model but works like a charm. Don't know what I would do without it!
2841593,troutwater,2014-05-28 12:30:00,299,"Great information guys, thanks. I'll definitely pick up a few of the ones that have been mentioned. What about sharpeners that can sharpen really hard steel? I have a Cutco filet knife that does hold an edge extremely well, but it's really hard steel so its hard to sharpen. I've had it 13 years so it does need touched up. They have a forever guarentee on the blade, but don't want to send it in every time I need it touched up."

Anyways I was curious to hear any tips on improving my knive sharpening abilities, or a good kind of sharpener to use. Since I've been designated PB(pike b*tch) on our trip for my somewhat decent ability to get boneless filets, it would be nice to learn how to keep a sharp knife."

2836057,Steve Ediger,2014-05-27 07:58:00,97,"Lansky makes a very good and reasonably priced sharpening system for about $25. You can get it from Amazon, Cabela's, Bass Pro, Gander Mountain, etc. It comes with five different stones and with a little practice, you can have your fillet knives (or any knife) razor sharp. The system holds your knife blade at the same angle for each stroke, which is what makes sharpening difficult for most of us."

My favorites are the Edgmaker - Pros: inexpensive, does a decent edge; Cons: wears down pretty easySmith's Diamond hone - Pros: actually for dressing edge up; Cons: if knife is dull will take a lot of workChefs Choice sharpener - Pros: make an outstanding edge, will sharpen serrated; Cons: expensive (around $150-160), need power"
2836377,bigwalleye1,2014-05-27 08:56:00,2632,"The Edgemaker big popi references does wear down, but if you dip it into hot water for a time, the little round ""blades"" can be rotated a few clicks to expose new edges, and, once you go all the way around, hot water again, yank 'em with a pair of pliers, flip them end for end and reinsert. Nothing does as good a job as a good oilstone and a ceramic hone in my book, but I do carry a couple of these for quick sharpening. Edgemaker also makes a smooth one, called a ""Finishing tool"" I think, for the final honing, and I like that as well. Only drawback to edgemaker is the very tip doesn't get as sharp as I'd like."
2836521,MrSimon,2014-05-27 09:28:00,922,I take the Spyderco Sharpmaker. It is very compact and gives a good edge. Takes some practice to get good at it though.
2836569,patricktjms,2014-05-27 09:54:00,67,I work in an orthopedic surgery center and about twice a year a guy comes around with a mobile sharpening truck and sharpens all of our surgery insturments. He is nice enough to do my knife set while hes here and they come back to me dangeroursly sharp.
