2887385,jveri,2014-06-11 08:47:00,70,"Thanks for the suggestions guys, I will check out those tite lok holders for now. Hopefully I can find some here in Canada before I leave for my trip in two weeks."
2914161,Bearing Man,2014-06-19 09:59:00,30,Downeast rod holders. Mfg. in Maine. great for trolling and keeping rod fixed to side of boat.
2916529,Mike Borger,2014-06-19 17:38:00,1554,I have both the Down East clamp on holders and a set of Tite-Lok's.The Tite- Lok's are the ones I usually bring on fly in trips. They're bulletproof and as light as air. Way lighter than the Down East versions.I always bring a couple of small chunks of wood to assist in clamping them to the inside of the boat. Sometimes it's not that easy to do without the rod holder slipping around. The small chunk of wood on the inside of the boat makes it easy and super tight.
2884777,Mr. Sauger,2014-06-10 13:45:00,285,I like the all aluminum ones form lock tite. They are a bit pricey (maybe $25) bit they work great and you won't lose your rod & reel on a snag.
2884785,jveri,2014-06-10 13:46:00,70,"Nicely done, sounds like an awesome outpost camp!! Our usual group is 24-28 guys and one year we had 30. Seems harder and harder to get people to commit every year. Best of luck up there, tight lines!!"
2885729,SinOrSwim,2014-06-10 18:18:00,1528,Goodness. We had 14 last year and I thought that was a pain in the ***. lol
2885745,MorganMan,2014-06-10 18:27:00,341,"Yeah, that sounds like fun, but way to much work unless each cabin took care of themselves? We used the Titelok rod holder that clamped to side of aluminum boat easily."
2886129,Sportdog,2014-06-10 20:14:00,6735,If the boat has oarlocks these work well for me.
2886201,Sportdog,2014-06-10 20:36:00,6735,Another pic.
2886697,Guest,2014-06-11 05:27:00,0,"My group purchased Eagle Claw clamp-ons through amazon. They a heavy duty, well constructed, and I tested mine on my own 16 footers gunwall and they are rock solid."
2886825,lassh,2014-06-11 06:18:00,553,"Hey Phish, Whats the lag bolt in the second picture for? Have a great trip!"
2886897,SinOrSwim,2014-06-11 06:35:00,1528,I just have MorganMan hold it. If he gets tired I slap him and tell him to quiet down and switch arms. What could be better than a rod holder that grabs you a cold beer? (that would be IF you could drink in a boat)
2887153,Jack77,2014-06-11 07:47:00,168,We have used the Tite-Lok rod holders from Cabela's for years. They will clamp to anyside and you can adjust the angle. They have worked great and I highly recommend them.http://www.cabelas.com/product/Tite-...h-All+Products
2884417,jveri,2014-06-10 12:23:00,70,"Just wondering if anyone has used any clamp on/screw on rod holders with any success on a fly in trip? Our camp has just basic 14' or 16' lund boats with swivel seats, looking for something to make trolling a little more enjoyable is all."
2884481,Pikeslayer8,2014-06-10 12:37:00,1460,I used Cabelas Quick draw rod holder with a Cabelas Aluminum Clamp-on Rod Holder Mounting Base. Worked good as long as you don't use a split grip handle. http://www.cabelas.com/product/Cabel...h-All+Products
2884545,phishfearme,2014-06-10 13:12:00,1242,1 1/4 inch plastic pipe with holes drilled into it at various heights and wired (bailing wire is best) to the seats - see photos. cheap and very effective. phish
2884569,oldccm,2014-06-10 13:16:00,109,Is that a fishmark 320 in the background? I've got the same one and still use it on my fly ins. Works great except I'm on transducer #4 now
2884601,jveri,2014-06-10 13:20:00,70,@phishfearme that is some redneck ingenuity at its finest!! Did you troll with it or just used it as a rod holder when docking/running about? Is that one of Mattice Lake Outfitters camps in the background with the red roofs?
2884649,phishfearme,2014-06-10 13:27:00,1242,"yes, it is a 320. used it for years but I also damaged the transducer and found it was only slightly more expensive to get a new one (humminbird pirhanamax) that uses AA batteries that last forever. phish"
2884665,oldccm,2014-06-10 13:30:00,109,"I hear that. Because I only go one one fly in a year I still use mine. I actually swapped out the head unit for a hummingbird 502igps that I had in my old tinner, bracket was the same size. Color screen and gps but the battery only lasts about 8 hours now lol"
2884673,phishfearme,2014-06-10 13:31:00,1242,"flattery will get you no where! use them almost exclusively to keep the rods out of the boat so as not to step on them or damage them. no, not Mattice, that's the bow lake cabin (north of 51 outfitters) - although we're flying with Mattice in about 10 days. by the way, I did: - cut my grass and discovered a car - had my porch collapse and killed more than three dogs - saw a sign that said ""say no to crack"" and pulled my pants up. phish"
2884689,jveri,2014-06-10 13:35:00,70,"Oh ok, looks like it might be able to troll some small baits. If youve never flown with Mattice ur gonna love it. We are going up on June 27 to Whitewater Lake with 16 guys. Great accomodations and crew at this outfitter.This will be my 7th trip up there and it never disappoints. Which lake are you guys going too?"
2884753,phishfearme,2014-06-10 13:41:00,1242,we're actually using Mattice to fly to another outfitter's lake - Kearns lake with thousand lakes outposts. our outfitter does not have a commercial airplane so he charters with don. this will be our second trip to Kearns - you can see my first trip report at:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ghlight=kearns good luck at whitewater - 16 guys!! whatta mob - probably like herding cats! phish
