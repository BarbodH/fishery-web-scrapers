After MUCH research I found that 70% of the people who die in float plane accidents do so from drowning NOT injuries. The authorities recommend all passengers wear manually opened life jackets. The idea being that you don't want to have an inflated vest in a small flooded plane with a small exit door and ensuing panic. Most of the time the pilots just ask me if mine is manually operated and when I say yes they say ""no problem."" I just returned from a trip and the pilot and owner said NO WAY and I had to not wear it. Anyone who thing he or she has time to put one on in the most typical type of accident should watch this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ5D0Qa0PBkorhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBkzh0LKe5IThe Transportation Safety Board of Canada knows there is an issue but seem to be focusing on egress and harnesses. http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/britis...ning-1.2187132What do you all think?"
2915609,phishfearme,2014-06-19 14:26:00,1242,"most drown because they can't get out of the airplane! I think the life jacket would only help once you get out - so the priority has to be to get out first. once you're out, there's probably a lot floating around to hang on to - like the pontoons. by the way, the first video is from a movie (the mother load) phish"
2916217,Yaba,2014-06-19 16:38:00,88,"Ive been flying in the bush for almost 30 yrs. NO way Im wearing a life jacket in the plane! Work has us do ""Dunk Tank"" (egress) training were they turn you upside down submerged in a mock up of an aircraft....its unbelievably difficult to get yourself orientated to get your seatbelt off, find a door handle, move it in the right direction, then actually push the door open and get out all while holding your breath. Now try doing it when your fighting a lifejacket thats tangled or caught on something.....good luck!"
2916257,Skywagon,2014-06-19 16:50:00,1106,"I went through a water egress course 2 years ago, quite an eye opening experience. I am a fair swimmer (a certified scuba diver), but still found it difficult to try to put a life jacket on when in the water, add doing that after having to escape the cabin of the plane and there is not much energy left. The best thing is to have a life vest already on, one that only operates manually. The most important thing you can do is to familiarize yourself with the inside of the plane and access to the door. If possible, seat yourself near a door and get real familiar with it. If you are in a plane that dumped over, you will probably be upside down, be familiar with your seatbelt, you may be hanging against it and will need to unlatch it quickly. We practiced escaping from a simulated cockpit in the pool (a lot), you will not have that advantage. Be aware of your surroundings, that is what will save your life, you won't have much time. With all that said, float planes are very safe. A high percentage of flip-overs are on amphibious planes, when the pilot forgets and leaves the wheels down when landing in water. Most float planes you guys are traveling in do not have wheels, that automatically takes that problem out of the equation. Enjoy your fly in."
