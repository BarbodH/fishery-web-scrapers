My father and I have been going to the Upper French for the last 25 years or so chasing muskies 2 weeks a year. While we have done pretty well on the muskies the fishery has changed in the last few years, 10 years ago we would catch pretty good number of pike while muskie fishing with a half dozen 15-18 pounders during the trip. Not so anymore even small pike are hard to come by which makes for very long days. To change things up i've decided to plan more of a pike (maybe some walleye) trip, with hopefully more action using a little lighter gear and smaller lures. I have narrowed my lodge choice down to The Fisheries Resort in Bear Passage, has anyone stayed here? How is the northern pike fishing in the area from Bear Pass to Redgut in general? (we would be going the first 2 weeks of Septeber-2015). I hear there is a fishable population of muskies in the Redgut section? Can anyone recommend a good guide for this area for pike (and muskies)? What would be the best grocery store in Fort Francis to stock up on our way up? Thank you gentlemen. Jay"

Unless theres trains going by every hour it still seems to be situated in an ideal location with the option to go north into Redgut or south into the Swell and Seine areas."
