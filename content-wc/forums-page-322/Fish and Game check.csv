First trip to Canada in 1977 and coming home the border guard in International Falls asks the driver of the car in front of us: ""how many Walleyes do you have?"". Driver responds by saying "" what's the limit""? Border guard rolls his eyes and tells drive to pull over. The guards basically pulled everything out of their car looking for who knows what. Bet that driver never answered a question about fish limits with that answer again!"
2909241,HeHooksHimself,2014-06-18 05:42:00,725,"I told this story before, but this thread reminds me of it again and I know some of you might enjoy it. About 3 or 4 years ago the MNR had a check right outside of Fort Frances at a pulp check area. We knew we were good because I was in charge of counting the fillets and I know we had sixteen for our group of four. We were in my truck and were having our last Canadian cigar while the officers were doing their check. Finally the officer looks at us and says, ""I keep coming up with 17."" I respond, ""Couldn't be, I counted those things several times myself!"" At this point the other three guys become very interested in the dandelions on the side of the road and the officer invites me to count them with him. Sure enough, there were 17. Obviously a couple of them had frozen together and had the appearance of one package when it was actually two. I apologize profusely and admit I had made a mistake. He responded that it was obvious, but he had to issue a ""ticket."" and confiscate my catch. He explained that if we had been five over, he would have seized everything. And then he apologized that while the ticket was similar to a traffic ticket, nothing was cheap in Ontario and the ticket ended up costing me $260 and four walleye fillets. The lodge was in my name and we were due to get something like that as our HST refund and I would receive it so it would be a wash. That year, the Canadian government determined that our refund should only be $60 so I had to eat the rest. As of now I am no longer allowed to be the fish counter, which is fine because I am usually busy removing hooks from myself. Fish on!"
2909409,tv4fish,2014-06-18 06:57:00,2694,"We fish Lac Seul (Sioux Lookout) and the usual ""game check"" area for us is just south of Dryden. There is a perfect spot on the west side of the highway where they can ""stack up"" quite a few vehicles to check. It is staffed by plenty of officers, so the check time is pretty quick. They have a ""back up"" squad car about 1/2 mile further south - we have assumed that is there in case somebody decided to bypass the check area. One year we not only had that check done (Yes, we were legal), but also had been ""selected"" for the complete search at the border coming back to the U.S. - and those guys at the border are THOROUGH. I think due to a funding shortage, the one south of Dryden hasn't been set up in the last couple of years."
2910537,packpro,2014-06-18 12:52:00,695,Same exact story for us. Honest miscounted by one. We owned it and made the sacrifice of one limit and the fine. However we did a group (12) kick in for the fine. Now we have a fish counter and a checker. Really more embarrassing than anything. MNR guys couldn't have been nicer during our numerous roadside recounts. RCMP guy though was a hard a**.
2910769,troutwater,2014-06-18 13:43:00,299,Wow!!! That's a crazy story. Glad they were able to nab them!
2912097,Further North,2014-06-18 18:37:00,2008,There's a few things dumber...but not a lot...
2912129,Further North,2014-06-18 18:41:00,2008,"You've got to 7 or 8 different kinds of dumber than a bag of rocks to pull a stunt like that. I hope they took their trucks, boats, tackle, rods, reels, extra clothing and dirty underwear and made them walk home after posting the titles to their houses as bail...."
2907745,Bakefish,2014-06-17 15:37:00,1077,"I haven't seen one of these on the road in many years, but I got an up close last Saturday. They had one set up just before entering Fort Francis. They made me pull the tarp off the boat, open the truck bed hatch and the cab and looked in every cooler. They unwrapped every fish to check our limits. Just doing their jobs. The officer was businesslike, professional and polite. A sign on the road said Road Construction Ahead, but as you got closer to the flashing lights it was obviously not construction. One of these checks every few years is reason enough to obey all the laws in Ontario. A few extra ounces of fillets is not worth the penalty. The officer even commented on the good job we did in wrapping our fish for easy identification."
2907777,thyme to fish,2014-06-17 15:48:00,307,"I am all for it,,,,,,,they can check me everytime follow the rules,,,,nothing to worry about,,,,,abuse our fisheries,,,,,you should pay in $$$ and lose your license and next time your boat"
2907833,Hump,2014-06-17 16:17:00,578,We had one several years ago south of Ear Falls. I didn't mind except we had to repackage things and repack the van. Interesting to talk to the warden who was very nice.
2908361,BuckeyeBill,2014-06-17 19:06:00,76,"Bakefish, we got stopped in the check also but I told the officer we did not keep any fish to bring home. He let us drive on through. We fish smallmouth and kept only 4 fish all week for one shore lunch. Only my son and I and we had to catch over 600 smallies for the week. Lots on topwater. What a blast!!"
2908409,go dart,2014-06-17 19:26:00,77,I can't imagine anything dumber than bringing more fish than your legal limit home.
2908505,fishron,2014-06-17 19:49:00,317,"This subject brought to mind the one and only time I was checked by a warden in the many years my buddies and I fished a great little walleye lake in southern Ontario, Wolfe Lake. That particular year, Ontario had required that all fish had to have the skins and just about the whole fish attached to the filets. I know the guys on this board can remember that time. I was on my way to the thousand island bridge with a limit of walleye, towing my boat, (PA license) and a SUV with flashing lights pulled me over. It was a lady warden and she was polite and straight to the point on seeing our catch. The son of the owner of the lodge we stayed at for many years, (Green Shingle Lodge, no longer there and the best lodge I've ever stayed at anywhere) was the best walleye fileter I have every seen. He had those fish cleaned in such a way that they looked whole, but with a small snip the filets were free. No doubt much to the surprise of the warden."
2908513,Mike Borger,2014-06-17 19:51:00,1554,"I got pulled over a few years ago just east of Geraldton on hwy 11.I was super concerned as we did have one limit of fish that were packaged individually, but my buddy did the filleting and neglected to leave a patch of skin on.There were two trucks ahead of us in the lineup with Ohio plates and when we spoke with the officer he said not to worry. It's guys like the group in front of you we're really concerned about. Seems they had 267 walleyes in their cooler. I remember the number because it was so big LOL!"
2908577,BuckeyeBill,2014-06-17 20:01:00,76,Those dumb Buckeyes !!
2908721,Fish_Heads,2014-06-17 20:58:00,154,Really..........They could'a gone to Lake Erie & had the same amount of meat by keeping 18 walleyes !
2909177,PRO-V1,2014-06-18 04:48:00,142,"Have gone down to Rydens the last couple Saturdays, (which is usually camp change over), and the co's have had the check set up. Mike"
