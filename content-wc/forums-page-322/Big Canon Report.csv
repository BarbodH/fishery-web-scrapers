Walleye, Pike, Perch, Small mouth, and Lake trout.....(Muskie also when they are in season.) All were turned on. had trouble catching under 18"" walleye. We caught our limit in a hour (8 guys) all were right on 18"" We threw a ton of 18+ back over three days. approx. 100 per boat/per day. Every spot was turned on and the average size is up to 18"" from 16"" just 5 years ago. Typically we have to hit up the portage lakes for that kind of action. Not this year. The main Lake and the river were on fire. Lake trout were up high and we caught our limit trolling 33' of water in two hours. They were hitting everything......cranks, #9 shad raps, strata spoons, and dare devils. Large pike were schooled up in protective bays. One 40"" while fishing for walleye. When targeted 38"" (2) 36"", 35"", and a 34"" in a two hour period. Perch were harder to find as the weeds are just starting to emerge, but enough were caught for a good take home fish fry. The small mouth were huge with eggs, and just starting to move up to the shallows. We only fished or them one afternoon with top water. Everyone caught a few, but they were immediately released. Big pike destroyed my top water in 18"" of water. Saw it coming, what a rush. 10' after the hit, it snaps off my 15# Spiderwire. Mix in the great food and cabins and our group is already scheduled for next year."
