2911297,phishfearme,2014-06-18 15:14:00,1242,"you mean some of you DON""T? I guess it has to do with sophistication. Hugh Carlson understands! we actually bring in martini glasses with a variety of olives! see photo. but mixing with tonic, lots of ice and a lime is about the best on a hot summer's day at the lake. a few trips ago when LarryS joined our group, we got him addicted to G&Ts and now we have to bring an extra bottle of tonic and an extra lime. phish"
2911329,tooski,2014-06-18 15:22:00,393,"If my group drank like that on a fly-in we would need an extra flight just for the olives. Christ, how many olives per drink?"
2911681,misanthrope,2014-06-18 16:50:00,43,Carlson's are the salt of the earth. Hitting Telescope on Friday. Although I'm looking forward to the 17 hour drive like a prostate exa
2911705,tooski,2014-06-18 16:54:00,393,Misanthrope- Telescope seems to be a popular lake with them. Have you been there before?
2911737,misanthrope,2014-06-18 17:04:00,43,Fished Telescope last year and have previously fished middle and lower McInnes.
2911777,camp chef,2014-06-18 17:18:00,915,Saphire martinis with Jalapeno stuffed olives every night at cocktail hour in our camp too!!!On the rocks though.LOL
2911809,Larry S,2014-06-18 17:25:00,665,"Tooski, We have a cocktail or two before dinner, Phish and a couple of the guys like their martini's. I would rather have a gin and tonic, or a scotch on the rocks. We also bring a bottle of Glenlivet along. I leave tomarrow to fly to Minneapolis and meet my sister. We will then drive to Thunder Bay and be flown from there to camp Saturday morning. Phish and the guys are flying to Thunder Bay and then have to drive to Armstrong and be flown in from there Will be in touch with you before your vets trip Larry S"
2911857,phishfearme,2014-06-18 17:43:00,1242,this isn't just a drink - it's dinner!
2911873,phishfearme,2014-06-18 17:47:00,1242,using crawlers on telescope made the trip go from mediocre to quite good. there's rock piles on the right and left sides as you enter the far eastern portion of the lake that were really good - with crawlers - couldn't raise a fish on twister tails. best of luck phish
2911889,phishfearme,2014-06-18 17:48:00,1242,"in addition to the ""camp chef"" - you are also the camp resident high class mixologist. phish"
2907641,The Donger,2014-06-17 15:10:00,48,"Flew in to McInnes Lake with Viking outposts on May 30. Camp in good shape as usual and new 4 stroke Honda motors on the boats. Yeah baby! Two days in one of our crew had a medical issue. We got on the satellite phone and Viking's plane was there within an hour. They flew out Sunday at about 4:30 with our sick guy and another of our crew. Our guys hit the hospital in Red lake, spent the night in a hotel, drove to International Falls, delivered our sick mate to his his wife, our healthy guy drove back to Red Lake and Viking flew him back to McInnes immediately. At no charge!!!! Granted our lead guy has flown with Viking before but that was really extraordinary and highly commendable. To see our guy pounding across the chop to meet up with us only 24 hours after he had left was extraordinary! We had a fine fish fry that night and toasted Hugh, Craig, Rosanne, Enid and all the crew at Viking. Wonderful people. Our sick guy is on the mend by the way. I think he just wanted to sneak out on fish cleaning detail."

2907681,tooski,2014-06-17 15:22:00,393,But how was the fishing? Love reading Enid's blog by the way.
2907977,adempsey,2014-06-17 16:54:00,963,"Yes, that is indeed some good service!"
2910169,phishfearme,2014-06-18 10:47:00,1242,"the Carlson's are terrific outfitters - on our 2 week trip to telescope with them we dropped a dozen eggs and during the mid week check, we told hugh that we needed some eggs and he said he'll get them out in a few days and ""was there anything else?"" - we told him we're quite low on gin - he then said he'd be out later that same day!! he knows a real emergency. phish"

2910873,tooski,2014-06-18 14:07:00,393,"Jay, I agree 100%, great report. I have to add though that sometimes the negative reports can be helpful, sure depends on how they come across don't you agree? On a side note to Phish- who the **** drinks gin in Canada?"
2910953,IaDave,2014-06-18 14:30:00,476,I wondered the same thing- I thought Steeler fans drank Iron City Beer
2911089,JAY221,2014-06-18 14:46:00,877,"I agree on the bad reports also being helpful. You have to read them with a grain of salt because you are only hearing half the story. I know that you can't please all of the people all of the time. Later, Jay"
2911233,tooski,2014-06-18 15:08:00,393,"IADave, Years back I worked in Pitt a few weeks and I'm telling you Iron City was all they had. Maybe I was in the wrong part of town but seriously, that is all the bars served...Kinda like Red Stripe in Jamaica... By the way- that is Phish from years back in my avatar..."
