2913769,Bob/MN,2014-06-19 08:21:00,178,The locals a Sioux Lookout said they had over 9 foot of snow in the area last winter. The water this year is the highest it has been in 35 years.With the high water there is a lot of floating wood so be watchful.
2915433,Blades-n-Beads,2014-06-19 13:47:00,484,"Thanks for the updates guys, as things are changing for the worse it seems. Finally getting out of here come this Monday afternoon. Hope the roads don't continue to deteriate with high water. Best advise from most reports so far is take it slow on the water (lots of floating logs and debris), most likely will try a few honey holes if the eyes are not there I'm headed directly to shallow bays , what use to be shallow bays! With water temp reports of 55-62 I'm sure there are a huge number of big fish still shallow trying to soak up some heat. Bad day fishing is still better than a good day at work."

2905001,Blades-n-Beads,2014-06-16 20:19:00,484,"Anyone have any info on the rain and high water around Dryden and just north to LacSeul , headed up in a week and wondering if there has been wash outs and flooding around that area also. LOW I guess is 2' + high, LacSeul the same?"
2905497,Guest,2014-06-17 05:51:00,0,"You can watch the water level rise and fall on the chart at www.lwcb.ca. Go to the site, click on basin data on the left and then choose your body of water. Right now, there are several spikes on the chart for Lac Seul inflow, so they must have had some downpours up there."
2905721,tv4fish,2014-06-17 06:53:00,2694,Looks like they are going to have to revise one chart --- the inflow went off the chart.............
2906361,Limeyangler,2014-06-17 09:40:00,563,"Hey Blades, i'm in Dryden. Lots of rain here in Dryden, wont be getting on my lawn tractor to mow the grass anytime soon, ground is saturated, such a shame eh? I was up at Williams Bay last Tuesday, road up there was in best condition i've seen it in a long time, they are hauling lumber out so the road is being graded, and the secondary smaller trail in from the main logging road has also had some potholes filled and brush cleared. As for the water levels on that part of the lake, they are the highest i've seen in a while this early in the season. There has been some local flooding and washouts, here are some details from yesterday from our local CKDR radio station website's news section:A flood outlook remains in effect in the Dryden area. The areas include Wabigoon Lake, Wabigoon River system, Eagle Lake and the Eagle River system, as well as, low lying areas west of Dryden. Water levels along Highway 605 in the Rugby Creek area, along the South Minnitaki Road in the Beaver Creek area and along Highway 105 in Buller Creek have been high, and have risen with recent rainfall. The public should be aware that increasingly high water levels and flows may impact crossings, and flooding in low lying areas is possible and will persist for an extended period of time. ]The Ministry of Natural Resources is closely monitoring the weather and developing watershed conditions. You will be able to check that site yourself for updates by following the link below http://ckdr.net/news/index.php Hope this helps."
2906521,Yaba,2014-06-17 10:34:00,88,I think that in general ALL water levels are at record highs in Northwest Ontario....and more rain in the forcast.
2907497,dgoody,2014-06-17 14:41:00,4,Limeyangler are you the guy who posts videos from Lac Seul on YouTube? Great videos!!! I will be on Williams Bay Fri.
2908489,Limeyangler,2014-06-17 19:46:00,563,"That would be me, and thanks, glad you like the videos! Post a report, i would love to be there too, but a sick wife and chores put that idea to rest.....lol."
