2914009,Lovetofish,2014-06-19 09:29:00,458,A couple weeks away from our annual trip to Canada. Looks like a mess getting through the Twin Cities again. Will travel up I-35 from southern MN. According to MN DOT looks like I should take I-494 and 694. Any help will be appreciated.

If you're going Duluth to the Falls on 53, be aware there is a hillside area in the Ash River area (between Virginia and Ray) that they're watching closely for mudslides, which could cause problems. Few ways around it."
