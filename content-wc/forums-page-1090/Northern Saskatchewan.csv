I'd like to take my two young boys fishing in Northern Saskatchewan next year, but I've never made it any further north than P.A. eventhough I live in Regina. If anyone out there could offer some suggestions as to good drive-to lakes, time of year (from what I've heard, June and September are good times) and successful tactics, it would be appreciated. Good Fishing,Mick"

The Churchill river system/La Ronge area is OK, as are the many lakes further north along the road. You can also head west to the Pinehouse area (turnoff is about 10km this side of La ronge). June/July are good bets - bring the bug juice! There are cabin rentals at many of the lakes - best bet is to get the accomodation guide put out by the Sask gov't/DTRR (head office used to be on 3211 Albert st a few years back). This guide will help you narrow your decision to a few places in that area - cabins/showers/campsites/guides etc. I would suggest Besnard lake as a good place to start - not too big, but big enough that you won't be playing bumper boats. Do take a guide for at least a day though - lots of underwater rocks/reefs.chris"

506611,Guest,1999-12-03 13:17:00,0,"This can be an excellent lake if you take a guide. The lake is huge and there are alot of rocks but if you can have a guide take you to Pickerel Bay in May, june or July, you will have no problem catching 10-25 walleye per angler ranging from 2 to 7 pounds. As well many guides will take you for lake trout when you have your fill of walleye fishin. Did this lasy year and caught a 18 pound laker. You can rent a boat and guide north of la ronge at english or waden bays."
