506590,Guest,1999-11-25 10:05:00,0,"There can be some decent sized bugs up there in June, especially early on. Nothing that you cannot handle with Deep Woods and, if necessary, a good bug jacket with an enclosed hood. The fishing can ge so good up there you may not notice anyway!"
506591,Guest,1999-11-25 10:39:00,0,"From April to August in a typical season there will be Black Flies, Mosquitoes, Deer Flies and Horse Flies, all bite and some take flesh(Black, Deer, Horse Flies)All are very tasty...Seriously June is a major bug month but the fishing is the best when the bugs are out. Like the other guy said you can endure it with some good bug spray and a bug suit. A smelly cigar in your mouth will help to disperse them as well. Eating lots of Onions and Garlic prior to heading out will turn them off but your fishing partners may not put up with you.Usually the Black Flies are gone by the end of June but it depends on how wet it was during the hatch and how hot it is when you get where you are going. Mosquitoes are around for most of the warm weather but generally only are heavy at dusk and early morning. July is Deer Fly **** not much repels them and they come to the funeral of those you manage to kill. If you are near farmland expect Horse Flies see Deer Fly **** only triple the size.I live up near Ottawa, Ontario and we get some pretty heavy bug activity but in the woods and anywhere further north it's a different ballgame. Bugs so thick that you can't eat without getting some in your mouth, forget about baring your privates for a trip to the John...Cover as much skin as you can and hope for the best.I always have a can of Muskol and my bug suit handy. It gets so bad sometimes that you have to drive around the lake to get away from them. A big motor helps cause a 5hp won't outrun a swarm of Black Flies.We do what it takes to endure it knowing that there can be a big payoff as far as fishing goes. Besides we live here what else are we going to do?Hope this helps.Ken..."

On fairly hot days they aren't a problem on the water. For common black flies, once in a while they will be bad, especially if it's hot out and your boat is covered in Pike slime. Horse flies are only usually a problem if you're wet, from swimming or somthing. And Deer flies have painful bites but they are few and far between."
