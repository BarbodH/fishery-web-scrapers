Hank Parker ""Deep Down Carlina Riggin"" or some such name. A great rod that I used primarily for bottom bouncing and throwing/trolling heavy crankbaits. The rod cost me in the vicinity of $130.00 Canadian two years ago and came with a one year warranty. I sent an e-mail to Berkley customer service in the States and they passed me over to their Canadian counterparts. I was told to send the broken rod in along with a brief explanation of how it broke and a cheque for $9.95 Canadian. I received a brand new replacement rod today. They sent me a Gary Roach GR250, IM6, 6'8"", Medium, Pro Select ""Trolling/Bottom Bouncing"" rod. I couldn't be happier! This looks to be a honey... long cork handle with a trigger grip, every bit as good and possibly better for my application, than the one I broke. What service!! Biggest problem I have now is that I'm going to have to wait 5 months or more before the ice is off the lakes to try it out."
