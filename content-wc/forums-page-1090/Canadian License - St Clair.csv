506600,Guest,1999-11-28 16:38:00,0,"Can anyone tell me the cost of an annual non-resident fishing license for use in the Canadian waters of Lake St. Clair. If so, is it in Canadian or US funds ?"
506601,Scott,1999-11-29 10:15:00,385,"Annual non-resident fee is $55 Canadian funds, including GST. This type is for full limit. Also conservation licence available for reduced limit for $33 including GST tax. Regular 7 day lic. $35, 7 day conservation is $21."
506602,Scott,1999-11-29 10:24:00,385,I should have said the licence fees are for Ontario and not Canada. Each province would have it's own fee structure.
