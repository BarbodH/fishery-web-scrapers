They are the narrow spot you went through in the Pash. river when Lawrence took you to Greenbush. You come around the point, hug the right shoreline, then cross over to the left midway through. East Pash. seems to be mostly shallower water less than 10 feet. The key for us has been spawning areas since we are there during or just after spawn. Later in the year weeds may be a factor, I'm not sure. The falls are at the portage into McCrea. It's about a 15-16 mile ride from camp. There's a nice deep hole there that holds lots of eyes and the river running out into the lake is fairly deep with good fishing also. There's also an awesome spot for shorelunch on a point that sticks out into the river by the portage. You'll see it if you make it back there. We fish spawning areas or deeper water nearby those areas. In the spring when we go, we average 50+ walleyes per boat a day if we concentrate on them and 100 fish days aren't uncommon. The northern fishing is pretty good too. I finally got one over 40"" this year, it'll be on their website this winter. How would you rate the fishing up there when you go? I've heard it stays pretty good all summer, but obviously the walleyes aren't going to be in the same spots that we fish in the spring. Also, does the water level hold up all summer, or is it significantly lower than spring?"
542968,Guest,2004-08-26 09:32:00,0,"Thanks for the info. The fishing is always good, although we do have to work at it sometimes. I think Medcalf fishes good in the summer because of the deeper water and the bigger eyes are usually down deeper. Didn't make it to Doran this year but we normally catch a bunch there or on Thelma. I don't know what the water level is like in the spring but the barrels were still on the docks August 1st. I blew through the narrows all week (my boat Lawrence) going to Medcalf so it was higher than average. They've had a real cool and wet summer so fishing was different than most years. My daughter was bummed because there were no berries to pick. We had to fish deep water, 20 to 30 feet where normally it's 8-14. Water temp was 68-69. My e-mail is [email protected]. Send me an e-mail and I'll forward some pictures."
542682,Guest,2004-08-17 14:09:00,0,Anyone ever fish Pashkokogan?
542702,Guest,2004-08-18 10:28:00,0,"Used to go up to Pash for 3 years in a row from 96-99. Very remote, you won't hardly see any other boats on the lake...one heck of a LONG drive and the last 3 hours on a extremely bumpy road. Kind of like 502 after it first opened up. Walleye fishing was o'k. Lots of 12-14 inch fish. Very few larger fish...never caught a fish over 20"". Northerns were good. Caught quite a few while trolling/casting the weedlines for 'eyes. C,P,R'd a 41"" northern on our last trip there in '99. In short, we determined to cut 3-4 hours of driving time and catch as many, and larger 'eyes at Wabaskang and now, Gullrock. Hope this helps, Craig"
542791,Guest,2004-08-20 15:54:00,0,"It is a long drive. We've been going since 89. Only fish Pash a little and that's for Northern. We spend most our time on Medcalf and portage one day to Thelma or Doran or Greenbush out of the North Albany camp. Great fishing on these lakes. Easy to fish and get around on. Lakes are deeper with nice reefs and sandbars for shorelunch and swimming. Nice sized walleye and a lot of them. I don't remember how long they have had the size limit but it has helped. 16""-22"" fish are very common."
542802,Guest,2004-08-21 16:26:00,0,"Any of you ever fished Minchin Lake, or done youself or know anyone who has done the portage from Minchin into DeLesseps Lake. I'm curious whether the portage is even passable anymore, given that the MNR lists the old pre-1975 routes as ""not maintained."" Last time through Sioux Lookout no one at the MNR could help at all! Appreciate if anyone with contacts could ""ask around."" Thanks"
542849,Fishoil,2004-08-23 13:00:00,1277,"I've been going there since '98. Where do you fish in Medcalf? I've only found a couple of really good walleye spots in there. Pashkokogan is a different story, it's hard not to catch walleyes, and some pretty decent ones too. Have you ever caught any trout in Medcalf? I see lots of fish down deep, not sure what they are. Did you see the bear in camp last year? (AKA Lawrence);-)"
542885,Guest,2004-08-24 07:45:00,0,"Lot's of spots in Medcalf, most of them next to deep water. I don't know of any trout there. I think what you see are white fish. I've heard about that bear story."
542895,Guest,2004-08-24 10:18:00,0,Do you fish the main lake at 5 mile or east pash? Lot's of rocks out there. I've had good luck by cigar island and the weed beds on the west shore at times but this year it was tough. Only fished a couple hours and a storm blew through. Ever fish the bridge?
542897,Fishoil,2004-08-24 11:09:00,1277,"The hole by the bridge is usually good, 5 mile point is good, the reef across and to the west is good. The hole below the rapids at 9 mile is great, as is the hole and river below the rapids and portage into McCrea. The east lake has some great spots. You need to be careful, but it's safe enough if you use your head. When do you usually go up there? My group is always there for the season opener (the week before they normally open). Did you hear any stories about some idiot who brings up a big glass boat? That's me."
542904,Guest,2004-08-24 12:18:00,0,Never been down that far other than when Lawrence took us to Greenbush. None of my party want to take their big boats out there. I'd love to spend a good day or two on east to learn it better but don't want to go alone. We are there first of august usually. Same time next year. If you have a map I could mark some spots for you on Medcalf.
542944,Guest,2004-08-25 14:56:00,0,I don't recall seeing rapids at 9 mile. I'll get there next year. Is it by the Pash river? What kind of water depth is east Pash? Do you fish the weeds or are there hole out there. Never seen the falls.
