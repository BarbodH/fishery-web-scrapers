542745,Mike Kansas,2004-08-19 11:57:00,1463,"NWO Fishing Bum, This trip was actually my first time at SWWL. I have fished Lac Seul for many years at Black Bay out of Lac Seul Lodge. I really enjoyed SWWL and our group will be looking at going back next year. I have been to Lac Seul three times this year and will be going back in September. We will have fished four different Lodges and they all have been great. Lac Seul is just simply a great fishery and I think it might be hard not to enjoy anyplace on the Lake. We already have trips booked for next year at Black Bay and Lac Seul Outposts....hopefully will book a couple more. Catch and Release"
542748,Guest,2004-08-19 12:23:00,0,"NWOFB, I understand your desire to keep some form of anonymity and I respect that. I do appreciate the information you provided, regardless if I know exactly who you are. Just thought I'd take a guess based on the first hand knowledge you gave and the interest in the SWWL. I am really looking forward to my first trip to Lac Seul and NWO as a whole. We'll have 7 full days on the lake to try and figure out how to catch some walleyes. With the weather this summer I imagine it's key to stay mobile and versatile in your fishing. Not sure if you visit the OFN (ontariofishing.net) but I will post a detailed report Early in the week of Aug 30th. Again, thank you to everyone who has answered my questions."
542753,Guest,2004-08-19 13:31:00,0,"I'm not certain, but I may see you out on the water. Of course, you won't know it's me, but if you come along a boat landing (and of course subsequently releasing) many big walleyes, it may just be me . . . Enjoy your week."
542756,Guest,2004-08-19 14:02:00,0,"LOL NWOFB! OK, I'll keep my eye out for you."
542930,Guest,2004-08-25 09:26:00,0,"Hey Mike Kansas, thanks for the information on this lodge too. This is another one of the lodges that I have heard good things about and was told to check out. They are pretty booked for 2005 too."
542939,Guest,2004-08-25 11:41:00,0,"Hey guys, Mike Willems does weekly fishing reports on Just Fish athttp://www.justfishontario.com/disc8_toc.htm They are about the best and most detailed reports that I have read. The guy runs a good ship and has a well trained staff. Can't go wrong."
542679,Mike Kansas,2004-08-17 13:28:00,1463,A group of 12 of us just returned from SWWL. The entire staff of SWWL treated us 1st class and the fishing was excellent. The food at the lodge and the Guide prepared shore lunchs were top of the line. I would recommend the SWWL to anyone who is looking for an awesome piece of Canada.
542685,Guest,2004-08-17 17:11:00,0,I have to agree with you Mike. Hope to get there for a day trip the end of this month. What was your personal best fish of the trip.
542695,Guest,2004-08-18 08:15:00,0,Who was your Guide? Going there next week. Any other tips/advice?
542696,Mike Kansas,2004-08-18 08:29:00,1463,I fished with with two Guides. Brandon and Ryan but all of our group said their Guides were great. Most of our big fish were caught with 1 1/2 oz bottom bouncers with gold or silver blades and 3/4 oz jigs tipped with white twister tail and a minnow. We spent most of our time in 30 to 35 ft water in Bray Lake.
542697,Mike Kansas,2004-08-18 08:49:00,1463,"29 1/2"" was the biggest but we caught lots of fish between 26"" and 28""."
542715,Guest,2004-08-18 18:20:00,0,"I agree also SWWL is unreal. I've never seen anyone so wild about eyes as Mike and his staff. I'll be back up there in a couple weeks, searching for a giant."
542728,Guest,2004-08-19 07:00:00,0,Leaving tonight for SWWL. Can anyone tell me who's been there recently what the approx. surface temps are?? Thanks.
542739,Guest,2004-08-19 11:13:00,0,"Mike Kansas, I figured you were an SWWL visitor from the nature of your posts in the past. Good to hear you enjoyed yourself with some of the new guide staff. Did you book for next year? JBB, Surface temps are fluctuating in the high 60's to 70's, although fishing will be much like Mike Kansas described for the next month anyway. Bouncers + in-line spinner combos and jigs are the two main presentations. The issue to watch now is the cold front that swept across northwestern Ontario yesterday. The passing of the front brought forth destructive winds, and behind it cold, arctic air. Traditionally, such weather slows the fishing. Usually, the day of the front passing is OK. It is the following day (as in today) which will reveal the extent to which the cold front is affecting fish production. Regardless, things should slowly rebound after today. I have found when the eyes are deep, like they are now, such a weather shift has less affect on the fishing, than when they are shallow in May/early June."
542742,Guest,2004-08-19 11:28:00,0,"NWO Fishing Bum, Thanks a lot for the info. I read about that crazy day yesterday on Lac Seul on another board/report. By the way, you wouldn't happen to be MW from SWWL would you?? It was his report I read on justfishontario.com If you are, it will be a pleasure to meet you.... (I am one of Simmy's friends coming up to camp on the lake). If not, thanks again for the information and of course, good fishing to you and everyone else here. Ben."
542744,Guest,2004-08-19 11:52:00,0,"Ben, I am not MW, although many people have confused me for him. Having said only that, some people out there will know who I am. Whether right or wrong, keeping some form of anonymity seems beneficial on these discussion sites. I try to present non-partisan information and advice based on my experiences and knowledge. When people know who you are, where you are from, and what you do, they tend to look at your posts differently, often dismissing your ideas because they believe you are biased. Obviously, we are all biased in some form and we are all entitled to our opinion, but this is the trend I have found. I had not read MW's report yesterday, but looking at it now, I would say it appropriately describes the recent weather events of the region. As I said earlier, today's fishing will likely dictate the extent to which the front affected fish production, and from today forward things should start to rebound, barring another major weather shift."
