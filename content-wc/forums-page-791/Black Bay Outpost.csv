542888,Mike Kansas,2004-08-24 08:38:00,1463,"Ia Dan, Lets dont start any rumors about Sasquatch living around Black Bay. After all we have only seen him twice and it could have been a man in a costume. I first fished Bray about 8 years ago and it was the first week of June. We caught fish but it wasnt any better than any other part of the Lake. My last trip this year into Bray was great. We caught a lot of big fish but all were in 30'/35' of water and I think the fishing was part of a late summer deep pattern and we hit it just right. I personally would not make that run from Black Bay again. Lots of unknown water and it could be a great trip to mess up a motor on. Have you explored the water east of Black Bay towards the north east arm of the lake? Lots of great water there and that area of the lake has a strong reputation for good fishing. Heck Dan the whole lake is full of fish if you just fish the wind and stay on a strong pattern. How did your group do this year? Kansas Mike"
542916,IA  DAN,2004-08-24 16:49:00,53,"Mike I agree with you, I don't know if there is a bad area on Lac Seul.We have had better yrs. up there than this yr.,but it was a funny yr for the weather.In one day I had shirt on,shirt off,shirt on with rain gear,then rain gear with jacket,all of this in last week of July don't figure.We usually fish Aldous,Rocky Point,around Fish Gut and some of the islands in that area.We went to Wolf Narrows but not to much luck there this yr.We havent really ventured any farther than Manitoba Point as far as going North East,are we missing something.We always figured there would be more boat pressure up that way.Are you talking around Mckenzie Bay or further East.My sons bringing a group of guys up next yr and staying at the main lodge the same week we will be there.Were planning on coming over and fishing with them for a day or two so any ideas where to start fishing in that area(Big Island,Ghost Narrows,Poplar Narrows).We dont usually fish that far east,we have been going to McDonalds Light and working our way back to Black Bay.Our biggest walleye this yr. was 26.5 and Northern was 37in.,but plenty of unders to eat.One thing about Lac Seul is that my worst day of fishing up there is going to still be better than my best day back home.Dont forget to root those Hawkeyes on.

542929,Guest,2004-08-25 09:20:00,0,"Yea Mike Kansas this is Tina, Because of all your help I am now the Lil Walleye Slayer, but still have a lot to learn. Out of our group of 7 this year I had the biggest Walleye and the biggest Northern this year. I want to thank you and IA Dan for all the helpful information about Black Bay Outpost. You both have been very helpful. Oh yea and I would love to see SASQUATCH too. Last year I videotaped a moose eating lillies on Sunlight Lake and this year I videotaped a bear that swam across Altimeter Creek in front of our boat. Maybe one of these years I will get to videotape SASQUATCH. Thanks Guys, Lil Walleye Slayer"

542630,Guest,2004-08-15 19:53:00,0,"I've never stayed at black bay, but I have fished that area quite a bit. Very good fishing in that area, we do well on a big sand bar next to there."
542648,IA  DAN,2004-08-16 14:47:00,53,We stay there the last week of July.I don't know what you want in information.This was my 5th yr. there and we'll be going up there again next year. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH.
542772,Guest,2004-08-20 11:17:00,0,"Thanks IA Dan, I just wanted to know if this was a good place to stay and the owners were cordial and the camp and outpost were kept up, cause websites can say anything but you don't know until you have talked to people who have actually stayed at some of these lodges and outposts. We have been fishing Lac Seul since 1997 and were just looking for some other resorts to stay at. We were down around Rocky Point at eh beginning of August, heading down to see if we could find Aldous Bay and Black Bay Outpost and I caught a 36 inch northern, it was the biggest northern I had ever caught and it took me a while to get it in the boat, he just kept pulling more and more line out and boiling the water from left to right every 25 feet or so. It was so exciting for me and my husband was excited for me as well. I released it so someone else can catch him and experience the thrill that I experienced."
542776,Mike Kansas,2004-08-20 12:11:00,1463,"Lil Walleye Slayer, Is that you Tina? If you can get into Black Bay you will love it. The cabin is first class with shower and all new appliances. Outside Biffy ....but its clean."
542811,IA  DAN,2004-08-22 16:53:00,53,"I'll have to agree with Mike and he should know he's been going there alot longer than our group.Dan the owner is a top notch host. My 30 yr old son went with us for the first time.Boy does he have some good memories,the great fishing,the beautiful scenery,and the night he went down to the boat to get his camera(northern lights were out)he heard the brush next to the dock making one Hxxx of a racket so he started running up to the cabin and he said he turned and seen something bigger than him jump into the lake.He wasn't sure if it was a Bear or a Moose but he wasn't going outside the rest of the night regardless.I asked him if he had to go up to the outhouse what he was going to do and he said he was going to sleep with his cheeks closed tight.HAHA When Dan came out to bring us gas we told him about it and he said it was probably a Moose since it jumped into the lake. The cabin is in excellent condition with all the comforts of home except no indoor plumbing and no electricity.1 shower,1 stove,2 refrigerators,1 freezer all ran off of L.P. gas,solar lights.We usually have 6 guys every yr. but we expanded to 7 this yr. to see how it would be.Sleeping isn't a problem but the kitchen can get a little crowded when feeding that many.Dan just put on a new boat dock a couple yrs. ago that can hold 3 big boats without a problem.Mike's right though its hard to get in there so if you have a chance don't wait to long because I know Dan has a waiting list for Black Bay.I hope this helps,good luck.

542837,Mike Kansas,2004-08-23 09:26:00,1463,"Ia Dan, We have had that same thing happen a couple of times. Somebody will be outside at night and noise in the brush followed by a huge splash.....we figure its SASQUATCH."
