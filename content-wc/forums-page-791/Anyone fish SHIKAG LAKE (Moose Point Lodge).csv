542789,Guest,2004-08-20 15:20:00,0,Next Thursday I am taking my 13 year old nephew up to Shikag Lake in North Central Ontario (South of Sturgeon Lake)for his first Canadian fishing trip. I know he is going to have a good time regardless. Just looking for any help or insights on the lake. (www.moosepointlodge.com)

These were some of the best trips I ever went on as far as walleye quantities and quality. Fish bit aggressively all 3 times. Try heading west, then north from the lodge through the narrow river channel and up into those waters north and west. I think you should do well."

As the earlier poster said, make sure you head up through the very narrow channel and fish that area north and west of the outposts. Your host will mark that spot on a map for you. BE CAREFUL and go slow through there, because there are some really big rocks..My buddy caught a 26"" walleye right in the opening before crossing that narrow. It's also a great spot for a shore lunch. We caught northern all day long just trolling spoons or body baits as well."
542940,Guest,2004-08-25 11:58:00,0,Thanks Zim1 and BSilver: My tackle is packed and I can't wait for work to be over tomorrow. Thanks for the heads up on the NW section for bigger eyes. From the lake map are you talking directly north of the outposts or to the West of where 'SHIKAG' is printed on the map [http://www.moosepointlodge.com/MapLake.htm.] Has anyone fished Pallette Lake or Willow Lake that connect to Shikag on the West and North ends? Did you find any better weed beds for BIG pike? We are only up there 3 days so any help goes a long ways. I will give a report on Tuesday. Thanks again.
