Good luck...I'm sure ol' Simon will be on the water too. He sure loved to fish Canada. Tell Mike I said ""HI""....Thanks, Brad"
542555,Guest,2004-08-12 17:40:00,0,"Thanks for responding. I was always meaning to ask you, where are you from? I figured it was cold and wet this past week. The ten day forecast has highs in the upper sixties and lows in the low fifties to upper forties with little rain. Was there anyone coming into Holly after you and before us? I thought this was the only cabin on the lake, at least that's what their brochure and website says. That was one reason we picked this lake. If it's not, rest assured they will hear about it from me. Sorry to hear about the gas situation. I hope you complained because that is uncalled for. How did NWO respond to your complaints? Was the cabin comfortable? Did everything work? I am sure I will have more questions as I think of them so I would appreciate it if you would keep an eye on this website. We leave Monday a.m. and fly out Tuesday a.m. Thanks much, winneconne"

We also had some motor trouble, but were able to remedy the water in the tanks by decanting it from the large tank, then putting it into the portable tanks.....Lodging was adequate..."

542557,Guest,2004-08-12 18:21:00,0,"Rest assured there is another cabin on the lake and I saw the other crew motor by once or twice. It isn't their cabin but another l;odge. really no problem as we never spoke and even considered asking for fresh gas when we had the problem. The cabin was comfortable and another group was flying in as we left. However this was a local carpenter and some guys from Montana there to complete the siding on one wall. They wee going to fish too so I don't know what the deal was. The outboards were fairly new and the water problem could happen to anyone. Now if there is still water when you get there that's a different matter. There is a drain plug on the tank to drain off water but we weren't equipped to remove it. They need to do so when they fly you in. Can't imagine sitting there 5 days without a motor. You won't catch any off shore or the dock. I would take a bottle of gas drier with me and use it in my tank anyway. Also prop the small end of the plastic tank up so that any water will settle at the other end of the tank.When you leave the cabin and go to the left you will soon come to a narrowing portion of the lake. This is a saddle that connects the opposite sides of the north end of the narrows. Depth rises from about 30 to 9 feet or so. We found this while using bottom bouncers with a rigged crawler (man I/m an Arky that is starting to sound like a longtime 'eye fisherman). We then switched to a jig and minnow or a jig,plastic grub and crawler or leech. Dropp to the bottom lift about 5or6 inches and hold it about as still as you could. When the would hit just start reeling slowly but steadily and they would get hooked. When you want to move just go on through the narrows watching your depth finder. As you get to Grew lake the immediate left was a good site for a pike or 2. Marked quite a few fish there but didn't work it. People before me wore them out there . Then there are two small islands on the right as you enter Grew. Go around them and there are 2 pockets on the right. I caught several pike in those weedbeds on a spinnerbait.5-8 feet and just scattered. The others wore out the walleyes in the smaller cove back towards Grew.Pike cove has a row of big rocks in the water on the left side. Walleyes wewre on outside edge of the weeds in about 12 feet. 8-12 really.See them on the screen at 8 feet in 12 feet of water but catch them off bottom. More as you request"

542558,Guest,2004-08-12 18:38:00,0,Where abouts was the other cabin? Any particular color and size of jig? How big were the pike? and the ones you missed? How do you suspect all that water got in the gas? Did you catch enough fish for shore lunch/dinner? Enough for now. Much appreciate your time and info on this.
542603,Guest,2004-08-14 00:26:00,0,"asu72, thanks so much for all the information. We are leaving Monday a.m. for International Falls, spend the night, watch Monday night football (Packers-Seattle, we're from Wisconsin)and head across the border Tues morn. My son & I are pretty serious when it comes to fishing, so we'll see how we do. Watch this message board around the 23rd and I'll let you know how it went. It was a pleasure chatting with you."
542626,Guest,2004-08-15 17:27:00,0,take plenty of drinks. the water is pretty turbid in a glass. best art of our meals were the smoked sausages. they made a good snack or served as breakfast and lunch. plenty of crawlers and minnows. there are baitwells at the cabin to keep minnowa alive. catch a few leeches under the boats. they get by saying there is only 1 cabin because the other one is on grew lake. holly and grew are connected at that saddle i mentioned.extra firewood up the hill from the outhouse.take a can of gas treatment and use it right off the bat. good luck and please report when you get back.
542627,Guest,2004-08-15 17:28:00,0,by the way how many are going?
542633,Guest,2004-08-15 20:38:00,0,"We have six going. Thanks for the tips. We are packing 10 gallons of water. How many were in your group? We received a call today from NWO and they asked us if we could be up there tomorrow afternoon instead of Tuesday morning and they would fly us our early at no charge. They really gave no reason so we are hitting the road at 5am, about a 9 hour drive for us. Do you think minnows are necessary? Where did you buy them? We weren't planning on taking any, just crawlers and plastics. Thanks again."
542918,Guest,2004-08-24 19:45:00,0,Bet winnecone got weathered in.
542947,Guest,2004-08-25 18:28:00,0,"It was an adventure for sure. Lows in the upper thirties and highs only in the forties. Winds on Thursday were probably close to 40mph. Hardly August weather. Tipped over three trees by the cabin. Had to stoke the wood burner every morning and evening. But we managed to fish somewhere every day. Unfortunately had to wear layers of clothes and raingear most of the time. Caught enough for some big fish frys. Nothing real big: walleye, 25"", northerns, 38"", 37"", 34"" and smaller. Saw my son catch the 38""er, his biggest to date, so that was worth the trip right there. Some guys from Ark. came in right after us and I don't think their weather is any better from the sound of it. But I think we are going to give the lake another chance next year. I think it has good potential of producing some nice fish and quantities but the weather was against us this time. We have had some very nice fly-ins prior to this, so I guess we were overdue for a lackluster one. The cabin, I thought was very nice as compared to others I stayed in. We even checked out the other one on Grew (no one there), and it wasn't nearly as nice. But all things considered, a great time was had by all (and besides it was a week away from the office), and that's all that matters!"
542954,Guest,2004-08-25 20:17:00,0,how did you catch them and where? did I help any? what about water in gas?
543036,Guest,2004-08-28 16:31:00,0,The walleyes were caught with jig/crawler or leech. Most were caught west of the cabin by the island or in the first narrows to the south. The narrows were pretty good until the fronts came through. The northerns were caught with Silver Minnows/twister tail and Mepps bucktails in the bays by the cabin. We did not experience any water in the gas but I did mention it when we were checking in at NWO. It was great exchanging these messages with you. As I am a regular on this website I will check often or you can email direct at: [email protected]. Take care.

542600,Guest,2004-08-13 17:48:00,0,the other cabin is a couple of miles south.The largest pike was 18 pounds another was 11. the one i lost was about 20. Of course nothing makes a fish grow faster than almost being caught.I know he was one to be proud of. He was in the first pool after you pass over that saddle I was talking about earlier. Looking back that was where I caught acouple of yellow perch. If I had it to do over i would perhaps use one for bait. They were about the right size.Probably illegal though.We had no trouble catching enough to eat. Typically about 25 or 30 a day. If I had had a more dedicated partner we could have caught twice as many. We fished from abot 7:30 til 10:30 and about 5 til 8. I did go out one afternoon by myself but didn't seem to locate them like other days. Skeeters were bad so I went in. Also if you stand on the dock and look west the bank on the left was pretty good.Go down to you see the point with the rocks visible and work the 12-15 ft depth back towards the cabin. Just before you get to the point across from the cabin was a good spot for several days. Late in the day they would move in and were easily caught.My marker bouy may still be there. They were in 15 feet and showed on the depth finder at about 12.We caught them off the bottom about 6 inches.I used a 3/8lead head with a zoom curl tail minnow in a gray colorwith a worm or leech. my partner used a plain leadhead but just hooked a minnow through the area just below the dorsal fin. when we anchored over them he caught them betterthan me.Since we were short on minnows I kept using crawlers. Again I have never seen a depthfinder so necessary.We marked fish then we caught them.
540988,Guest,2004-06-20 20:56:00,0,"My son & I will be flying in to Holly Lake via Northern Wilderness Outfitters, Fort Francis in August. We would be interested in hearing from anyone who fishes this lake before that. Any suggestions, spots for walleyes and northerns, baits, etc. Thanks in advance. Winneconne"
541222,Guest,2004-06-28 21:08:00,0,going august 5-10 will report as soon as I return.
541236,Guest,2004-06-29 21:13:00,0,when are you going?
541262,Guest,2004-06-30 19:57:00,0,"Will be going right after you, Aug.18-22. Will be waiting to hear from you. Thanks for your reply. Winneconne"
541264,Guest,2004-06-30 20:07:00,0,I will do all I can to help. I don't know what to expect but we will work hard at catching some walleyes and an ocassional pike.I wonder if smallmouth exist there. Surely they do. I was afraid you were one of my group! lol
542301,Guest,2004-08-02 21:26:00,0,Leaving tomorrow. Will post report about the 12th.
542306,Guest,2004-08-03 07:12:00,0,Thanks for remembering. I'll be interested in your thoughts on the fishing and the accomodations. Best of luck and have a safe and great time. Winneconne
542376,Tyee Guy,2004-08-05 12:52:00,717,"I fished Holly a couple of years ago...For pike, go left from the cabin as you look off the deck, there are some shallows and weeds. Further down that area into the river there are some nice rock piles for eyes. Again looking from the porch out into the lake, there are a couple of islands with rock bars that produced, and closer to the cabin on the right there is a LARGE reef that is also good, but BE CAREFUL of it. Don't ask, I think you get the picture.......When you see sea gulls STANDING in the water, you will know what I mean......"
542529,Guest,2004-08-12 07:49:00,0,Tyee guy must have fished withed the other outfitter. There are two cabins on the lake and we stayed with northern wilderness outfitters. Our cabin was on the north end of the lake and there were no shallow water near us. A marked hump is just southwest about 300 yards but only comes to 7 feet. Accomodations: adequate 7 went and worked out fine. take water unless you don't mind boiling lake water and drinking tea colored water. The first day 4 of the 6 outboards(6 horse yamahas) quit running because of water in the fuel. One tank had 70% water. We are all backyard mechanics and with a leatherman and determination we got 2 running. we then had to drain all tanks and refill them by filling a clear pitcher andwaiting for the water to settle.Pumpo some into a clear container when you get there. We told them but who knows if they will fix it? Also lay in some firewood from a pile behind the outhouse. It was cold and rainy and a fire felt good. No complaints as to accomodations. Fishing: we caught enough to keep up the interest but don't expect to catch 50 a day poer man. We found a few concentrations but they would be there one day and gone the next. Weather perhaps? Minnows were the best bait but crawlers and leeches worked. Hint you can pick up a few leeches every morn under the boats. a minnow dip on a stick worked great.The only thing I would need is a bunch of 3/8 leadheads and a bucket of minnows. Our biggest walleye was about 24 inches long but most were 14 inches or shorter. No smallmouth but a few northerns. I lost 2 big northerns. A big double willow leaf spinnerbait chartreuse in color is all you need for them. just got in and i will add more soon. ask any question and i will try to answer.
542536,Guest,2004-08-12 11:28:00,0,"I fished with the same outfitter that you had NWO. We fished Wabakimi last year and did pretty well. Had boat problems too, but not as bad as you did. There is nothing worse than having boat problems on a fly-in or any other trip. We like NW outfitters, but their equipment could have been a little better. The boat I drew had a very small crack in the fuel line and the backups had the same problem. Sometimes (actually a lot of the times) the group ahead of you doesn't report problems or hides things they did, like chipped and mashed props. This especially happens later in the year. The best luck I have had in regards to equipment is with Pipestone Fly Ins, Mike Henry. Did two flyins to Wabakimi (a great lake) with him and never had any motor issues as he checks things real well and buys new motors every year. In fact, I hit a reef while I had a husky jerk stuck in my calf and he had insurance on the lower unit which cracked. That made my week. He also took the treble hook out of my leg for me which was burried. Mike has other fly in lakes and I highly recommend him. Going to Thaddeus (a drive to camp) which is cheaper this year (8-14-04 - 8-20-04). I have 2 boys (15 & 12) and flyins generally don't discount for kids, so I am going a little cheaper this year. If you do go with Mike, you will pay a little more ($50 for 5 days), but you won't have to worry about the equipment and he is an excellent fisherman and really puts you on the fish. There are two reasons we didn't go with Mike on Wabakimi last year: #1 He can only have 6 in his camp(@ Wabakimi) and we now have a regular group of 8. #2 We couldn't get the week we wanted (2nd week in August). My kids are both good baseball players, so we have to wait for all the tournaments to be over. Mike also has great guest retention and once you get a week, you have to deposit on it when you return to keep it, so and not many weeks turnover. In short, he is a great outfitter and I know I will use him again some day. Wish you would have had better luck, but it sounds like the weather has been crappy and there was a late mayfly hatch up there. May the fish be with you!"
