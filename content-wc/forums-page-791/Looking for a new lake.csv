Thanks again for any info you may have!!!"

Great accomadations and hosts. We fished there in June and could get to great water and fishing within 15 minutes of the lodge....we got a 31 1/2"" and a 30"" Walleye plus about 600 Walleye for the week ( 4 of us)."

542932,Guest,2004-08-25 09:41:00,0,"I just got back from Happy Landing Lodge with my dad, grandfather, and younger brother. They had great boats, 17'lund outfitters with new 50 hp. honda four strokes, they were sweet. They have 13 different lakes, we only tried three, but all the boats, motors, and gas were already there. We just had to carry our rods. We caught Between 85 to 100 walleyes per day per boat the biggest one was 30.25. My dad got a 47"" muskie and my grandfather caught a huge 22"" smallmouth. I can't wait to get back there next year. The lake we caught the big walleyes on was called Yoke Lake. Good Lake"

543012,fishman,2004-08-27 15:16:00,60,I can believe it as 3 of us in 2 1/2 days on Lake of the Woods in June had over 200 Walleyes and we were keeping track. Also last year on a fly in 5 of us had over 350 in 3 days of fishing. Its possible if you hit it right and find the fish.
543023,Guest,2004-08-28 06:57:00,0,Greetings- I HIGHLY recommend Holinshead Lake which is located 2 hours north of Thunder Bay. It is a 6500 acre lake with only 4 beautiful cabins on the lake with no other access. You can go at any time of the fishing season and expect excellent walleye fishing. We go in Aug. when the weather stabalizes. I too am over the 50 mark and have fished several Ontario lakes and have been going back to Holinshead for 14 years in a row and the fishing just keeps getting better. I would be happy to help out in any way. Just e-mail me at [email protected].
543031,Guest,2004-08-28 13:49:00,0,"600 'eyes in a week for four people...... 600 divided by 4 people is 150 fish per person divided by 7 days of fishing is a bit over 21 fish per person per day. You can't catch 21 walleyes a day........in Canada........during peak season? Maybe you better watch some videos....""how to"". No intent to flame, my friend. It's just that 600 fish in a week for four good sticks who are serious fishermen is NOT out of the ordinary. Peace Lunker"
