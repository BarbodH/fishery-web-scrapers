542948,WillieB,2004-08-25 18:35:00,292,What oufitter are you flying in with? Great area...great fishing. Had 9 days on Kittyhawk Lake thru Jubilee Outposts in 2002....excellent.
542955,Pooch,2004-08-25 20:22:00,4619,Just got back ten days ago. Sixty five miles north of Red Lake. Coldest weather we have ever had in August. I mean a dash of frost on the boat seats in the morning. Fire in the wood-burner most nights. Fishing has been slower all summer. (Three trips) But we still caught more fish than we deserved. Also size was down just a little bit until the last few days when it warmed up just a tad and the old girls were hungry. They have not really had a summer up there this year and ours here in Illinois appears to be waning faster than nornal. Good luck. Pooch

542996,Pooch,2004-08-27 07:03:00,4619,"We have fished Birch for many years. Neither a bad or great lake. Just another Canadian lake. Sometimes a little short on size but good numbers of ""too large to eat fish"" but not really a braggin' fish. Getting far enough north that the size falls off. A 28 inch walleye is a braggin' fish that far north. It's the trip with old freinds that makes any lake a great lake. Pooch"
543018,Matches,2004-08-27 20:56:00,236,Is there a lot of netting on Red Lake?
543019,Guest,2004-08-27 21:26:00,0,"Our group just flew out last Sunday after a cold, windy, rainy week at Thicketwood Lake(only cabin on the lake) in the Woodland Carabou Park NW of Red Lake. Did mention that it was cold and windy? Jezz, I was like late Sept. Never the less, we caught 'eyes at almost any place as long as we were at 20-30ft(some places were better that others). This was the first time at this lake but we have been to another in the general area. Much to our surprise, we saw a guy in a canoe that was going to camp on our Lake over night. He was not very happly with all the motor boats he came apoun on his 28 day canoe trip. There are no designated camp sight(as well as sight for portages) in the Park but you are incouraged to use a site that has been used before. He was a loner as he said he appoligized for telling us to go way(we were just concerned that he was OK). And we thought we were tough guys for going to a fly-in and having to fend for our selfves in with the only cabin on the lake. This guy was one tough dude to be out for 28 days by himself. We met some guys after we flew out that were up there last year at the same time and it was so hot that they fished in their underwear! Fishboy"
