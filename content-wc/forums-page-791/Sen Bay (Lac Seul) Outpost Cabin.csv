542859,Guest,2004-08-23 15:37:00,0,We were fishing Sen Bay this past weekend (Brrrrr) and noticed an outpost cabin in the SW part of Sen. Does anyone know whose cabin this is and if is it available to rent? Are there any other outpost cabins on or near Sen Bay? Thanks. Skinny
542886,Guest,2004-08-24 08:01:00,0,"Skinny....can't help with the cabin in Sen Bay, but will be fishing there the week of Aug 29. If you don't mind, could you let me know how you did, where you fished in the Bay, and what patterns, etc you used. I have never been in Sen Bay but looking forward fishing up there. Matter of fact, haven't done much fall fishing for walleye anywhere. Did you try any Gulp? Thanks ... my email: [email protected] if you choose to answer that way."

Found a chartreuse jig head with minnows worked well. Biggest walleye caught was by Brad and it weighed in at just a tad over 7 lbs. A whole lot of people there on the August long weekend but last weekend, I had the shoreline to myself. Next year I am taking my boat along and will launch there and explore the area some more. Brad also caught a small mouth bass as well from shore."

Turn left on it. You will cross a bridge, there is a boat launch there on the river, not sure if it will get you into Sen Bay or not. But you can also keep going down that road and watch for two trails heading off to your left. Trails be about 100 to 200 yards apart. That is how I accessed Sen Bay. No formal boat launch down there but guys do launch there boats from there and guys have their boats tied up there for the summer etc. Guys just backed in to the bay. Those two trails would be 10 kilometers max from the bridge if I guessed right. There is an opening on the right side of the road near the second trail where guys will park if all the parking is taken down at the waters edge. May also be some boat trailers kicking around as well. Sorry I can not be more specific with my directions in terms of distances but it was my first time there and I did not track mileages etc. Also try giving the MNR office in Sioux Lookout a shout as they would probably be able to give you some great directions."

542970,Guest,2004-08-26 11:23:00,0,Good luck fishing up there. Sure wish I was back there. But a 1900 kilometer drive does not make it feasible to go there except for once a year. Pity. Wife's family has a cabin on Kawaweogama Lake. Spent last 3 weeks there. Where you driving up from?
542987,Guest,2004-08-26 19:39:00,0,JohnAB...live in a small town named Vichy Missouri. About 1200 miles from here. Anxious to try Sen Bay and well as other spot I previously have fished. Thanks for all your help! Marty
