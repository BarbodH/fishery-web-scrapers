542858,Guest,2004-08-23 15:30:00,0,Was hoping some of you maybe have fished the English River in mid or late September. Am thinking of coming up for a week with some friends that are staying at Little Canada Camp. Any advice would be helpful. What is the fishing like and is the area easy and safe to navigate? Please jump in here if you have fished it.
542922,Guest,2004-08-24 23:46:00,0,"we fished the river just below the dam at ear falls and it is terrific fishing. you can limit out in a day and there is no slot, well when we fished it anyway. good luck."
542924,Guest,2004-08-25 08:11:00,0,"Alan, thanks for the answer....what time of year did you fish that area?"
542956,Guest,2004-08-26 00:17:00,0,"Hi. when we fished just below the dam at ear falls it was in june. We had struggled all week fishing our regular places on lac saul and then some guy up by himself asked if we wanted to go just below the dam. there is a nice launch ramp right there too. its about a 3 minute ride from the ramp and we anchored along the shore with about 5 other boats and using leaches and tiny hooks and a couple of split shot cast it outabout 20 feet. either walleyes or northerns would bite. that was about 5 years ago. there was no slot size in the river then, I dont know about now though. 6 I think is what each person could have in pocession. He This guy we were with said the fish congragate here because so much food stuffs come through the power dam its an easy meal for the fish. good luck."

You turn off 105 at ""Smitty's"" covienence store, which is about a block north of the ""Trillium"" motel. If you've ever been to Ear Falls, you know the where these are, unless you blinked and missed town,lol. Last weekend when I drove by there were a half-dozen boats anchored in the current. :)"
542990,Guest,2004-08-26 23:54:00,0,Hello Wblock. I think every river in canada is called the english river LOL. No not really. but it does seem to everywhere. before they built the dam at ear falls it was the english river. if you go to sioux lookout which is the eastern end of lacsaul the english river is there too. good luck.
