542797,Guest,2004-08-21 06:26:00,0,"Quick calcultion in my head, at 80 cents a litre would work out to about $2.30 -$2.40 a US gallon in US dollars. W5"

542801,Guest,2004-08-21 16:21:00,0,3.79 liters per gallon.
542829,Guest,2004-08-23 08:14:00,0,"Each province adds a provincial tax to gas pricing. So each province probably has a different price. The further away you are from large urban centers....the higher the gas prices. Here in Quebec, the price varies from 86 cents to 1 dollar per litre or more."
542864,Wall@y@,2004-08-23 17:41:00,191,80 cents per litre works out to 3.03 dollars per gallon.
542906,Guest,2004-08-24 14:14:00,0,your head calc. is off. If gas is 80 cents a litre then 4 times 80 equals 3.20 per imp gal. The exchange rate last friday was about 77% so 3.20 times .77 equals 2.46 an IMp gallon with US money. Since a gallon of US fuel is 83.3% of an imperial gallon then the cost per US gallon with US money is approximately. $2.05. Not a bad deal.

542910,Guest,2004-08-24 15:03:00,0,It is currently 85.9 cents a litre in La Ronge.I believe it is going to be going up from that very soon.
542920,Matches,2004-08-24 21:30:00,236,"I just drove through Saskatchewan a couple of weeks ago. You will average between 83 and 87 cents per Litre. Whit is right, it is 3.8 Litres per gallon. After 25% exchage rate (use a credit card for best exchange rate) I say you will average $2.45 per gallon in US dollars."
