542879,Guest,2004-08-24 06:39:00,0,Has an alternate year size and slot limit ever been tried? Would such a thing work? If so I think people would be more receptive to the idea. I know the regulations are meant to benefit everyone but considering the amount of U.S. dollars that cross the boarder each year I would think there could be some attempt made to make everyone a little happier. I for one would still be making my 2 pilgramages North each year but I am sure that there are many that might seek alternate locations.

542891,Guest,2004-08-24 09:36:00,0,"Save a Walleye, eat a Muskie! A big one. Must be 54"" to keep although I hear the limit is coming down. A 50"" fish will feed the whole camp for the week. Even if it spoils throughout the week you could just use the leftovers to trap Eagles. They are tasty too with Sturgeon stuffing. Who needs Walleyes?"
542892,Reels,2004-08-24 10:05:00,2876,We could also fry up some suckers! We have to bring our sucker expert though.... so you better go to anger management classes before we leave. I don't want you stressing him out again. I might not see my truck ever again. <{{}}><
542902,Guest,2004-08-24 11:58:00,0,"I guess it just depends on what your priorities are. I like to eat walleye, but that isn't the reason I go chase them. Fishing is more important than catching some groceries. I'm headed to a walleye lake in western Canada in a few weeks which is totally catch and release. That's just me. For some folks, the main reason to fish walleyes is to get some to eat. That's cool, too. They just need to pick a place where the limits aren't so restrictive. There are lakes with abundant smaller walleye and liberal limits that I visit when I want to keep some to eat. LOW is a wonderful place. However, the nets need to go, before other restrictions are metered out, in my opinion."
542903,Guest,2004-08-24 12:12:00,0,I will be up there and I will KEEP EVERYTHING!!!!! I love the new rules because all the nimrods keeping 2 and throwing all the rest eyes back make it easier to catch 40 or 50 and have a cooler onshore in the weeds and keep loading it up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 Yeah baby I love catch and release.
542909,Guest,2004-08-24 14:55:00,0,We should get bigger coolers!
542830,Guest,2004-08-23 08:20:00,0,"So mnwallyman, where will your party of 10 go now? This is a trend that is not going to go away. Eventually we'll see this type of management in most areas....count on it. So, eventually, you will have to deal with it. The idea that natives are netting ""all"" the fish is another misconception. While I am not happy about the liberties they have with all their modern fish-catching equipment, they are not the sole reason for these new limits. Take a look at the Minnesota side of LOW. Harvest levels have exceeded the recommended levels for a few years now. Is it the natives that have taken too many fish here? No! The fact is that there are more & more fishermmen, with modern equipment, keeping too many fish. The same goes for the Canadian side of LOW & the Winnipeg River system."
542836,Guest,2004-08-23 09:20:00,0,Keep a walleye who cares about trees
542840,Guest,2004-08-23 10:05:00,0,"Netting is not allowed! When attempting to boat a Canadian great care and caution must be practiced. They bite and will continue to attempt to cause harm when boated. A spear or large gaff should be used. There is a new proposed law that will allow shooting before actually bringing the beast into the boat. It is only proposed! I say a spear and a louisville slugger will work fine. Shooting is overkill and a waste of good ammo. And, you wouldn't want to accidently shoot a walleye!"

542855,Guest,2004-08-23 14:50:00,0,"In reply to the limit on Walleyes, we have been going up to the same Lodge, (Lac Des Mille Lac Lodge) since 80. Some years hard to catch even 12"" to 13"" inchers. The last two years all 18"" plus. Fishing has improved greatly over the last few years and the Slot Limit is the Reason. We keep only what we can eat,(and two is plenty). It won't matter to us if the limit is ""0"". Steaks & Brats are great. We will still come up and enjoy the Beautiful Land and People. You guys saying you won't come back, I believe Steve was right, You are coming up for all the wrong reasons. Stay in the States and look at all the beautiful cigarette butts, Mickie D wrappers and all the other crap you throw out your window. Illinois Fisherman, Lac Des Mille Lac, see you next year!"

542872,rebelrn2001,2004-08-23 21:35:00,1563,"My wife and I go each spring to Wabigoon. We don't catch very many walleyes now the way it is. We normally target pike because they are more fun. That is why we go..for the fun. We do however, bring 'our limit' home of pike and walleye. A total of 8 walleyes (this year it was about 13-14"" with one about 15""). We might eat 1 or 2 meals up there. If we are only allowed to bring 4 back (2 each) I will eat at least as many walleyes up there as we would have brought home. My point is: I will get my $1500 worth of fish one way or the other. The lodge we stay at charges us as if there were 3 of us which is there minimal charge for the cabin. It sound selfish but I like to bring fish home so we can share them with our parents once or twice during the year. They enjoy it as much or more than we do but they are too old to make the trip each year. I do not catch more than we are allowed and we will not catch/have in posession more than the limit. Eating 2 fish each for 5 of the 7 days will deplete the fishery quicker than the 4 now. If the new limits are for the ""Winnipeg system"", is Wabigoon in this 'system'? I'd be curious to know. Thanks."
542875,Guest,2004-08-24 04:48:00,0,Well Don and Mike if you'll just send your money straight to Canada and stay home it will be fine with me. That means they make money and I get the fish. Oh and I'll mail you one of the beautiful people and take a picture too. You guys can save a walleye just eat a tree
542876,Guest,2004-08-24 05:17:00,0,"Rebelrn, I would love to see Wabigoon do something about a slot and none above as well as lower limits. I know what you are saying about the number of fish you take out in total compared to others, but it would be impossible to look at it on a case to case basis. I feel that over all, in the grand scheme of things, not being able to take fish home would be a benifit to the fisheries. I fish Wabigoon- Dinorwic, and am disapointed in the Walleye fishing. We keep enough small ones (under 18 inches) for a couple meals and do not bring any home. If this would be implemented I would hope after a period of time we would see results like some of the other success stories out there."
542877,Guest,2004-08-24 05:37:00,0,You know i'm always amazed at the number of people that say catch and release. Don't bring fish home and then they tell you that they ate fish every day when they were in Canada. Do you folks really believe they don't count. Come on if you eat four fish there its just the same as bringing four home. If you really believe in what your preaching then eat bologna for your shore lunches.
542784,Guest,2004-08-20 14:11:00,0,"Why do we go? It's the clean water, the blue sky, the trees and fresh air. It's listening to the loons sing and the wolves howl at night. It's spending quality time with your wife and kids and friends. It's a time to relax and smile and laugh. No TV news or phone calls or crowds or traffic. It's also about eating shore lunch. It still needs to be protected so our grand kids can enjoy what we have. If that means two fish then so be it. I'd still go if I couldn't bring anything home. We still get to eat them fresh when they're the best."
542790,Guest,2004-08-20 15:48:00,0,"Thanks guys, good info. I hope this new law has the intended affect. I expect that I will see even fewer boats there next year, which makes me feel sorry for some of the resort owners. It makes me wonder ...... Is the Ontario game commission trying to tell me that my family would likely have better walleye action if I went to almost anywhere else in NW Ontario instead of the Winnipeg River system? Will this mean that people will target northerns and smallies harder around for shore lunch and soon deplete those populations in the system too? Will people start to keeping more 27.5 and over fish to eat so soon we will catch fewer trophy size?"" IaCraig :)"
542793,Guest,2004-08-20 16:43:00,0,Why not fish Quebec....Most zones are 6 fish limit and some up north zones are 8 fish limits with no size regulations
542807,mnwallyman,2004-08-22 00:08:00,1,I think that this new law will do more harm than good for the resorts up there. Our party of 10 will not be back if this law passes. This will effect the resorts the most. I agree that something has to be done to protect the fishery but it is not the fishing that is doing the most damage. I believe that the natives netting is going to do alot more harm than the amount of fishing that is done. Also what will this do to any tournaments in the area?
542816,Guest,2004-08-23 05:15:00,0,I say we start eating Canadians

542738,Guest,2004-08-19 10:57:00,0,by the book it states that your shorelunch catch is part of your daily bag limit. You may of course fish but nothing else in the live well or cabin.
542749,Guest,2004-08-19 12:39:00,0,"Steve, Is the 2 fish limit for a specific lake or NW ontario? Please don't post part the story and get LOTS of people confused. Just talked with the MNR in Kenora and it has NOT passed as of Aug 19th, they are pushing for 05 and it will be on the Winnipeg system ONLY. Any fisherman who is concerned can contact the Ministry. Lac seul and most of NW Ontario is not affected. Welcome to Canada, Thank you for taking care of our resources. Pat"
542751,Mike Kansas,2004-08-19 12:51:00,1463,"Pat, Way to keep them straight Girl. Never got to thank you for the great time we had at Evergreen in June. Janet is still showing everybody the picture of her 31 1/2"" Hog Walleye. I never thought a fish could come between us but Im thinking divorce if she doesent stop flashing that picture in front of me. Not to mention that sly little grin she has when she shows the picture. Catch and Release"
542757,Guest,2004-08-19 15:31:00,0,"I understand what you are saying. I really do but there is a border involved. Just remember, it is their country and us Americans are simply guests. There have always been special seasons, fee, limits, etc. for residents only, in Canada. It is a different nation and they make their own rules. It may have nothing to do with conservation at all. However, it is their call and Americans do not have a say in it, other than staying home if we don't like it."
542758,Guest,2004-08-19 16:15:00,0,"Pat, The information I got was from the owner of the resort I stay at and yes it is on the Winnipeg system. Minaki. He did also say it was effective for 2005. If I spoke incorrectly, I apologize. I thought that I did say it was for next year."
542761,PJM,2004-08-20 00:14:00,3516,Steve I E-Mailed the MNR and here is what they sent back Walleye on the Winnipeg River system in 2005. The proposed changes are as follows: A slot size for walleye from 35 cm to 45 cm (13.75'' to 17.75'') with only one (1) allowed over 70 cm (27.5''). This will apply to both residents and non-residents Catch and possession limits will be as follows: * Non-resident sport licence: 2 walleye * Non-resident conservation licence: 1 walleye Walleye is the only species that will be affected by the proposed changes. Please be aware that these are proposed only at this point
542762,Guest,2004-08-20 05:57:00,0,"Wow! Even though the slot will be below 18"" and 2 fish they are going to allow you to keep a 28"" fish? I would rather band taking big fish completely and allow eater size only. Why take a fish like that? I realize they are saying that is a trophy size but reproductions these days are the way to go for any species. Thanks for the accurate info and setting me straight. Again, I was only relaying what was told to me by the place I stay. Does the MNR have a website? Steve"
542766,Reels,2004-08-20 07:58:00,2876,"Hey, at least you won't have to worry about being hungry! You can fry up a 17"" and a 30"" fish. That should fill you up. There was a link here a while back on favorite ways to cook the 10 pounders. Try using the search feature. <{{}}><"
542767,Guest,2004-08-20 08:18:00,0,"30"" should fill up a whole families bellies especially when you serve it with Bald Eagle egg salad and some nice Baby Loon patties."
542775,Guest,2004-08-20 12:07:00,0,"Amazing how concerned everyone gets over having to keep a few less fish. If you are so concerned about how many fish you have to take home, why not stay home and spend all the money you saved on your trip and just buy a freezer full of fish. When we go up it is about the experience, not ""I spent all this money and only get a couple of fish, that's not fair""."
542721,bigfish1965,2004-08-18 22:12:00,3210,"The limits are getting lower because more people are catching more fish. Pretty simple. The 'glory days' of stringers to take home are gone. we are all paying for it now. LOTW and Lac Seul were once considered remote locations. With new highways and urban sprawl, they are far too aceessible and far more people are fishing it. If all you want is a few fillets for the freezer, buy them at your local grocery store. Monies from licenses go directly to resourses. Enforcement and biology are the two biggest expenses. Ontario has more lakes than any other jurisdiction on earth. The revenue from the 3 million or so licenses they aell a year doesn't even scratch the surface. Why would anyone be suprised that locals would get a different limit than non-residents? The bag and possession limits are already in affect in the border waters of LOTW.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/fi...p_E_fr2004.pdf"
542722,Guest,2004-08-19 04:50:00,0,"I agree with Big Fish. Things need to be worked on now to preserve and inhance the fishery that is in place. I do not see why anyone should have a problem with different rules and limits for visitors as opposed to local people (this is also done in the states), we are fishing for sport not sustinance and should appreciate just being invited to fish in this great country. I don't understand what the big issue is about bringing fish back, but if it was not allowed it would make sense to me. There will be even more pressure on the Canadian lakes as the baby boomers get older and have more money and time to travel, so if a few people quit coming because of bringing fish home I am sure there absence would not be noticed. Things change and we should except that fact and realise it is being done in the best interest of the fishery."
542723,Guest,2004-08-19 05:52:00,0,It has passed. It is happening!
542724,Guest,2004-08-19 05:58:00,0,Amen brother.... One other thought....you catch 2 18's for lunch and then by law you can't keep another fish that day? Just can't really make that add up in my head.
542725,IaCraig,2004-08-19 06:18:00,434,"Big Fish, I could not get your link to open. So I will repeat my questions: For the Minaki system, does anyone know if this 2 under 18 law has actually passed starting in 2005? Or is it still a proposal being contemplated? It is Ontario's resource so they can do whatever they want, and I as a foriegner will play by whatever rules they set as long as the border remains open to us and I continue to enjoy the trip. But on Walleye Central I am still allowed to state my opinion and mine is ""Either Ontario has a fishery problem or they don't, and imposing tighter limits for non-res than res and ignoring impacts of native netting sounds like something politicians focussed on pleasing voters instead of addressing the actual problem would do."" . IaCraig ;-)"
542732,bigfish1965,2004-08-19 09:43:00,3210,Craig...the link is a PDF and you will need Acrobat to read it. No one is ignoring the native fishing issue. The plain and simple matter is that they are untouchable. The courts have sided with them nearly every time. The natives are bound by federal laws and not provincial ones. Canada signed some treaties years ago that were not exactly in our favour at this point in history but we are obligated to live by them now.
542733,Guest,2004-08-19 09:58:00,0,"Get over it guys! The days of bringing home fish ""to remember our trip"" are over. Bring a camera if you want to remember. If any of you won't come into Canada because you can't bring anything home, I say you are coming for the wrong reason. My 2 cents...."
542734,Guest,2004-08-19 10:26:00,0,"Can't bring potatoes, can't bring dog or cat food, have you got any tobbaco products, any acholoic beverages, are you leaving anything in Canada, have you got any gifts, any firearms. I wonder if they will let us bring our own fish. Why not make the limit 0 and MNR can play cards all day long."
542735,Guest,2004-08-19 10:34:00,0,"You catch and eat 2 for lunch. Can you then legally continue to fish? Seems at some point you have to possess to release? Is this addressed in the regulations? Last I saw of Canadian fishing regulations, it looked like an IRS handbook. Not against the new limits, just don't want some overzealous 19 year old CO writing me a ticket."
542737,Guest,2004-08-19 10:54:00,0,the law has passed and is on the books!
542699,Guest,2004-08-18 10:08:00,0,"It was brought to our attention after our trip to Minaki this year that a new law will start next year. The new possession limit will be 2 fish instead of 4 and both must be under 18"" as oppossed to the current law of 3 under 1 over. This law is only for us foreigners. Locals can still keep 4. Limits on Northern and Smallies stay the same. I don't know about you but 2 fish under 18 doesn't even make a healthy shore lunch........I may have to start keeping smallies"
542701,Guest,2004-08-18 10:24:00,0,"It's been like this on LOTW for years...four fillets, potatoes and beans is more than enough for my shore lunch."
542703,Guest,2004-08-18 10:33:00,0,"Same way on Gullrock. Just got back...had all the fish meals we wanted for 5...unless your on the Adkins diet...more than enough. Gullrock has had this in effect for 5 years and we C,P,R'd over 60 'eyes over 18"" in the week. Craig"
542706,Guest,2004-08-18 12:53:00,0,"Dude, if you can't get filled up on 4 walleye fillets off 16-18"" fish, either you waste a lot of fillet when cleaning or you eat too much."
542709,Guest,2004-08-18 15:57:00,0,"Has that law passed for certain or still a proposal? I don't mind a 2 fish limit but both under 18 makes me cringe a little. I can't help but to think about a 7 - 8 lb northern that we were unable to revive a few years ago, and how we had to let it float away because it was in the slot. (it ruined my day, even though I'm sure something ate it). It will really bother me if I have to do that to a walleye. As for shore lunch, our visit to Minaki this year produced very few walleyes 16 - 18 inches, so we did keep a few 19 - 20 for shore lunch during the week. We would have had beans a couple days for lunch if we could only eat 16 - 18 inchers. IaCraig"
542710,KSauers,2004-08-18 16:58:00,385,"Shore lunch isn't the question,but only 2 to bring home. I might as well stay here in Wisc. and fish the lakes the indians spear."
542712,Guest,2004-08-18 17:42:00,0,"That is really the issue......I know a lot of people don't care about bringing fish back and are all about the ""conservation"". I understand that too. However, when you go to a place that has had that law in effect, no big deal. You know it is there and choose to keep going. When you are used to being able to keep a 20-24 without feeling guilty or at least 4 18's and then the law suddenly changes, that is when I have a problem with it. We caught so many fish trolling that were pushing 25 and up. 18 and under were very hard to find. ####, I buy licenses for the kids just so I can bring back the meat to treat ourselves to throughout the year to get us through until next year. I really will start keeping smallies even though I never would as a rule. I think for the money we spend for a week up North, 4 fish is not too much. But, what do I know?"
542713,Guest,2004-08-18 17:50:00,0,"I made the comment about ""shorelunch"" more as an example then anything. Obviously 4 fillets, taters and beans should be more then enough. However, according to the law then, after you eat those 2 fish you are done for the day. I do understand and support the whole conservation idea. I do not understand or support the decision to only allow 2 fish per person under 18"" to be brought back when the rule does not apply to the locals. The Minaki area is abundent with eyes. We were having trouble on both trips this year catching anything under 20. Now that's a nice problem to have. I don't bring anything back when I go with the boys in June but on the family trip in July it is nice to be able to bring fish back to feed the family. It is nice to cook some up once a month to remind you of the trip and get you pumped for next year. Nobody is saying that you go up there to supply meat for the table since the last time I did the math each walleye is worth over a hundred bucks! Just my personal feeling on the matter."
542717,Guest,2004-08-18 20:13:00,0,I think you had better get used to very small limits in the future. Just checkout what northern Minn. is considering right now. Major reductions on most species. Fish management is doing the right thing and it will be only as matter of time and there will be no aggragate bags either. Two FISH per person is plenty with the amount of people who descend on the lakes every year. The locals are crying foul because creel sense's say they are by far the smallest fishery users. Non-residents are far and above all other user groups. The locals feel they should not be overly penalized for another user groups damage. Control the largest user group first. Its only going to get worse. Too many people means low limits.
542718,Roadhog,2004-08-18 20:26:00,17,"We just got back in July from NW Ontario. Some of us have been going to the NW Ontario area for over 30 years. We have a group of 12 fishermen including some fathers and sons. So, as you can see, we enjoy our once a year trip and hope that we can continue to share this experience with our friends and loved ones. All the talk of a two fish limit in this thread and in the prior postings bothers me a great deal. Many years ago the limit used to be 6 walleyes/person. The reduction to 4 walleyes/person was somewhat difficult to get used to. A reduction to 2 Walleyes/person would make our group evaluate some other options. Our group goes up once a year, we normally have one shore lunch during the week and like to bring home our limit in Walleyes and Northerns for fish frys with our families and friends. We observe the slot limits and try to release all ""non-keeper"" fish in such a manner that they will survive to preserve the species. Some questions come to mind...... 1. What happened to the money from the 30 years of fishing licences I paid for? Isn't it too bad some of that money couldn't be used to restock the lakes or do fisheries research, I don't know if that is what it is used for or not, if the Canadian govt. operates like the U.S. govt. I would think that this is money down a rat hole. 2. We all live in Illinois, so money and time dictates one trip a year for our group. I've talked to some groups from Minnesota that go up 2, 3, 4, or 5 times or more during the course of the season. Do these people bring back their 4 fish limit each time? I'm sure most of them practice proper fish release techniques, but how many fish that swam away died later? 3. In regards to question #2, some camp owners cater to people by having a 3 day or 4 day fishing package. Why not limit all packages to a one week stay? I would think some lakes have a lot more fishing pressure due to these short stay packages. 4. Although I am not a hunter, I know that the elimination of the spring bear hunt had a huge economic impact on some of the camps I think that lowering the limit will have the same chilling effect. 5.Which makes more sense....Bringing home 4 walleyes and having one shore lunch during a week's trip or bringing home two walleyes and having shore lunch every day for a week? I'm all for preserving the fishery for our children to enjoy, but before stumbling blindly into this new reduced limit show me some research to prove that this will actually have a positive effect. Isn't that what we pay our PST, GST and licence fees for each year. Just my two Canadian cents."
