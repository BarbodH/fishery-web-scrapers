Goose Bay Evergreen Golden Fawn Gold Pines Pros and cons, one compared to the other, that tye of stuff. It looks to me like the fishing should be the same, I can get rate info myself. Is one of the lodges more secluded then the others... want that great north woods feel Thanks"
534034,Guest,2003-08-01 11:12:00,0,"Evergreen is the most secluded of all you listed. If you look at the web site is sits back in the trees in a channel off the main lake. Goose Bay and Golden Fawn are on the main lake. Gold Pines is somewhat secluded but has a lot of boat traffic. All are good camps but I think Evergreen has the best equipment (boats and motors) and cabins are the newest. There are 2, 4 bedroom cabins and a 3 bedroom cabin to accomodate large groups. The camp is similar in size to the others with 8 cabins."
534035,Guest,2003-08-01 12:35:00,0,"Of the resorts you mentioned I like Golden Fawn the best. I've been to Evergreen and Goose and they are fine resorts but, Golden Fawn seems to have the best docking system and all the cabins are near the lake. None of these camps are what I would call secluded as the Ear Falls area is well traveled. You will have a great time no matter what resort you pick because the fishing is excellent. If you are planning for June, I would make my reservation NOW as all the resorts will fill up. I haven't been to Golden Pine. TGG"
534038,Guest,2003-08-01 13:28:00,0,"Opinions vary, I would recommend Gold Pines, we go there every year. Peter, Christa, Bill & Helen are great people and will take care of you."
534039,Guest,2003-08-01 13:48:00,0,"I should explain ""secluded"" 2 years ago we stayed at a place in Sioux Lookout, when we walked down to the lake we could see downtown and a highway, in addition to that there was another resort, that was located right ON the highway. Not that seeing another lodge is all that bad but I would be really disapointed if I drove to a resort and found out a highway ran 50 yard in front of the lodge."
534040,IaDave,2003-08-01 13:59:00,476,"AVS- If you want seclusion do a fly-in. I know that there are some resorts that have outposts on Lac Suel. I'm staying at that resort in Sioux Lookout that is only 50 yards from the highway. I love it. Once you get to the cabin all you see is the lake and very seldom do you hear the highway. To be honest, the only thing I want is seclusion on the lake and the fishing around there is great."

The last couple of years we went there we found the best fishing is just below the dam but then there are quite a number of boats there too. I would save that for the last day if you need to fill your limit. all those lodges, if I remember right are on the on a river like part that leads to the dam. this part of the water starts probably 10 miles? from the dam. Gold pines is nearest to the main body of water and on lac saul, the others are on this wide river portion. they have some good maps that show their locations so you can see what I mean. Yes they are all good. we have stayed at golden fawn and timberlane. evergreen is tucked into a tiny inlet where my wife and I used to catch some nice fish when the water was normal and the guy from evergreen called our lodge- timberlane at the time- and complained the we were in there fishing. lost of good memoriesfrom las saul. good luck"

Not one complaint could be thought of, and the fishing is great, catching 500-600 fish within the group. Our biggest walleye of the group was 25"", and for northerns it was 32"". River fishing seemed to be the most productive after thunder storms since the fish would rarely bite in open water. We already have reservations for next year, it was a great year."

Do a search for lodges near Hudson, Ontario - Lac Seul starts at Hudson's back door and if you want the ""real"" feel of the Canadian Bush, try driving some of the logging roads that run from Hudson to Ear Falls and fish some of the lakes in there. We just returned from there, are going back in 2 weeks, and wish we'd never have to leave. Also, don't rule out lodges that aren't right on Lac Seul but are only a few miles from either the Hudson launch or the Deception Bay launch. I could recommend Deerpath Lodge or Country Camping."
