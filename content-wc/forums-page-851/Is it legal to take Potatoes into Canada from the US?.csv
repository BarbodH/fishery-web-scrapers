534242,Guest,2003-08-08 13:49:00,0,How about Watermelons. Can you take them to Canada?
534151,Fishoil,2003-08-05 08:04:00,1277,I was told that you cannot bring potatoes into Canada from the US unless they are canned. This sounds ridiculous and if it's true I probably shouldn't have brought that 50lb bag with me this spring. Is there any truth to this or is somebody misinformed?
534152,Guest,2003-08-05 08:48:00,0,Some visitors have had their spuds confiscated at the border and others have been let thru. I had mine taken on July 18 at Rainy River and then drove a mile down the road and bought a bag that said grown in the USA. There has been a blight on spuds produced in certain US states but it seems the ban on importing them into Canada is inconsistently enforced.
