534232,Guest,2003-08-08 10:05:00,0,"I am thinking about buying a Crestliner 18' Canadian tiller boat. What are the pro's and con's of this particular boat? I am looking for something that is stable in big waves and is relatively light. Also, would you go with a 60 hp 4 stroke or a 50 ( Yamaha ). Thanks in advance for the help."
