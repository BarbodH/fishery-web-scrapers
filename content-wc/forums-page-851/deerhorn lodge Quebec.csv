534186,E_Fish_N_See,2003-08-06 08:39:00,26,"Jay, Getting back on topic - Steve Hamel at DHL has a really great laminated topo map of the entire lake with just about all the submerged rocks identified and it has GPS coordinates on it. When I was there, he had 7 maps left and he did not say whether he was getting more. I was tempted to by one @ 25 CA$ but I am comfortable with my topo's that I bought at a tackle shop in L'Announciation. I am sure every tackle shop from the border to Mont Laurier will have them. Let me know if you want the map reference numbers. Is this your first time to DHL? Mark"
534195,Guest,2003-08-06 13:44:00,0,Just for your infos my pimary language is not english and sometimes if a compare my writing to others that learn from there 1 year at school I'm not shy to post any comments. If grammar is not important don't mentionne it. Thank you
534197,E_Fish_N_See,2003-08-06 15:07:00,26,nemio2: I was not commenting on your word choice or grammar usage - rather that of Vitreum. Please don't take offense.
534198,nemio,2003-08-06 15:18:00,96,Excuse-me.
534199,Guest,2003-08-06 15:34:00,0,"Mark: This will be the first time to DHL but we have stayed at Pavillon Cabonga the last two years. We probably have fished the same areas since we always end up near Fog Island. We found the fishing quite tough, especially last year, when hardly any fish were being caught. We did catch some nice walleye toward the end of the week though. (the indians said to wait for new moon) I think I'll just buy one of their maps since I need to know where the rocks are. I dinged up my SS prop last year, cost me $130.00 and still isn't right. If you want to share any info I will give you my email address. Thanks!"

We probably have >fished the same areas since we always end up near Fog Island. Did you ever go past Fog Island? The farthest we went this year was the south side of the Lumber camp in Waskega bay but fished the wrong side. If you go there, you want to fish the south west side, what is called ""Rock Lake."" Last year sucked for us, too! This year was fantastic! I caught a 5 pounder in Mike's Bay and I caught a Brown Walleye, called a Sauger? is St Patrick's Bay. How was Pavillon Cabonga? I always here stories that you have to lock everything down otherwise the Indians steal you blind. New Moon on Walleyes? That is something to think about. Might have to plan the next trip around that and see what happens. Might have to wait two years, my wife has a ""bun in the oven"" that will preclude me from going to Canada next year. Probably going to spend a week at Lake Champlain, though. Please keep in touch - my email is: [email protected] Mark"
532190,Guest,2003-06-11 14:09:00,0,"Going to fish out of the lodge deerhorn. Has anyone imfo. on the fishing there for walleye? Were to go, what to use,How deep to fish. Going June 22- june 28. Thanks for all the help. and how deep to fish. Going June 22 - June 28."
532221,Guest,2003-06-12 05:21:00,0,"We are heading up the 28th, our first trip to Deerhorn. We used to go to the Gouin Reservoir but our outfitter closed this year because the water was too low. I haven't heard anything about the lodge or Cabonga in general. Hope you slam them, but leave some for us. Good Luck, Josh"
534114,E_Fish_N_See,2003-08-04 11:53:00,26,How'd you do? I just got back. Got a 5 lb 'eye in Baie Mike.
534127,Guest,2003-08-04 18:08:00,0,we had a great trip lots of eyes and some nice ones 5-7lbs. pike were nice also but no big ones. will be going back next year for 2 week or 3 weeks agian.
534171,Guest,2003-08-05 16:59:00,0,Going to Deer Horn Lodge at the end of August. Any recommendations? Would you happen to know where I can get a decent map of the area I can study before the trip? Thanks!
534172,Vitreum,2003-08-05 18:09:00,221,here's a recommendation. why don't you and your buddies buy and ad???
534173,Guest,2003-08-05 19:02:00,0,If it's in bad taste to mention a fishing camp let it apply to everyone not just Quebec. What is the official position of the site admin. on mentioning a particular camp?
534181,nemio,2003-08-06 05:44:00,96,So if I do understand each and everytime that a product or a outfitter is name on the site he should by a ad? Golden will be happy if it's the case. Or members should not help others with their past experience and keep all infos for themselves. WOW it's going to be a very attractive site. By the way there is walleyes outside Manitoba & Ontario and that area is call Quebec. Good fishing!
534183,E_Fish_N_See,2003-08-06 07:28:00,26,">here's a recommendation. why don't you and your buddies buy >and ad??? Dude, get some grammar lessons but that is not the issue here. The issue here is whether I or anyone else on this thread is pretending to be the outfitter and trying to sell his location. Well, there is probably no way that I can convince you that I am not the outfitter just typing these words so let me just say (for the record), that I am not that person. Furthermore, if I were, wouldn't I be putting my URL up and trying to sell my location even more? So what is the purpose of this board? Its for like minded individuals who like to fish for Walleye to meet and discuss those fishing issues and specifically, ""The Canada"" portion of the board is obviously directed for those who fish in Canada. If the outfitter's name on the Subject line gives you offense then maybe it should be changed to ""Fishing the Cabonga Reservoir."" But who cares? Do you fish there? If not, then why do you care? I have been going to Cabonga and staying at DHL for the past 23 years and with the internet I would like to try and find others who have also been going there to share info, swap stories, and the usual banter. I think this is the purpose of the site. Who cares if it centers around where you stay?"
534184,Guest,2003-08-06 08:13:00,0,"Wow! Ask a simple question! I have received so much information from this site concerning numerous subjects that I was unsure of or inexperienced in. For instance, I have purchased the following upon recommendations and suggestions from the very kind people who have taken the time to respond: A new Lund 1800 Fisherman, two Yamaha motors, a Minn Kota trolling motor, a Lowrance and a Vexilar fishfinder, two Okuma line counter fishing reels, two Shimano trolling rods, Power Pro fishing line, etc., etc., etc. Those who reponded gave their honest opinions based on their experience and were very helpful when making my final decision. All the items mentioned above were topics on this board. I guess they all should have been ads as you suggest! Eliminating brand names or names of camps, lakes, bait shops, hotels, lures, and other things that people have experience with is about the dumbest thing you could have said. Since I will be driving from Pennsylvania to DEER HORN LODGE for the first time, I just wanted some information. By the way, I have been a daily viewer of this site for 3 1/2 years. My registered name is joepa but for some reason I can't sign in under that name when posting a question."
