534209,Guest,2003-08-06 21:07:00,0,I leave in two weeks to go to a spot in Ontario. We have been going there for many years and usuall fish the same in the the same spots. Troll worm harness rigs or cranksbait near islands or drop offs. I want to try new tactics. My boat is set up for planner boards and I have downriggers that I use on Erie. What are the best methods for catching Walleyes on medium lakes? Thanks Jay
534210,Stevie B,2003-08-07 06:12:00,157,"I don't think that anybody here would argue that the best method for walleye is jigging. Very cheap and very effective. Locate the fish with your trolling methods and then switch to jigs. If there is a chop on the water all the better. Position your boat so it will drift right over your spot. Keep the jig about 1""-1' off the bottom, and twitch it every few seconds. Planner boats are not used a lot in Man/Ont. Most of our lakes up here are too dark and deep for fish to be spoked by a boat. Fish do not spoke easy at all here. I have caught walleye in 3' of water vertical jigging with the motor running on a sunny afternoon. Hope this helps. Fish ON!!"
534211,Guest,2003-08-07 06:57:00,0,"I agree. Leave the planer boards at home. If you want more variety in presentations, just take up bass fishing! In no time you'll have spent a Mint and can throw everything including the kitchen sink. Otherwise, stick to bottom bouncing or, my personal favorite, a jig/minnow combo. The less trolling, the better too. When walleye fishing, a bring as little tackle as possible, and hope to use even less. J"
534212,Guest,2003-08-07 07:21:00,0,"Remember, you can only use 1 line per man (woman) too so that may affect your thoughts on trolling."
534222,Guest,2003-08-07 16:59:00,0,"trolling.....with all due respect and no intent to flame, I can't think of a more boring way to fish. I'm a big fan of vertical jigging. Get intimate with your electronics, look for that ""spot on a spot"", feel the bite, and BURN THE FISH (practicing CPR, of course)! But, I have to give you a ton of credit. At least you're open-minded enough to consider other methods. Good luck and have fun. Lunk"
534227,Gary_IA,2003-08-08 05:54:00,144,"You might scan the articles on Walleye Central, justfishontario.com or In-Fisherman and pick a method you haven't used before and devote 15 minutes or one half hour a day just trying a new (to you) way to fish. Slip bobbering may be one of those ""new methods"" you use for challenging bottom conditions such as weeds, wood or rock or fishing a spot on a spot or when the jigs and rigs are being lost in the rock. It also might be your answer to fishing reefs when you don't want to take your boat in any closer. Its supposedly a good method for fishing in cold front conditions when fish are in a neutral feeding mood."
534243,Guest,2003-08-08 13:58:00,0,"Wow you sound just like me. We just got back from our latest trip to Ontario on Wednesday and used the crawler harness/crank bait trolling approach almost exclusively. This worked modestly, but I would have hoped for greater production. I could blame it on weather (which was bad..east winds low pressure), but I've always wondered if I jigged more, would I get more fish? Someone said that they switch to jigging after they locate the fish. We do this too occasionally, but we define locating as catching three or four in the same proximity which means probably ten or more trolling passes. Should we start jigging an area sooner after only one or two fish?"
534245,Guest,2003-08-08 15:42:00,0,"Thanks for the tips and ideas I already went out to a local tackle shop and stocked up on more jigs and purchased a set of marker bouys. I like the idea of spending a little time each day fishing a new technique. I think that I will probably troll until I find an area and throw out a marker and thne come back and jig the area until I get the feel of it. Work a short time if no bites, 20 to 30 minutes. Can't wait to go and try the new ideas. Are we there yet!! I am worse than a little kid sometimes. Thanks Jay"
