You couldcatch larger fish at the top of the hump at about 16', but needed low light and wind. We did have a great day fishing viking reef and some other reefs near by. We used 48"" floating Lindy rigs without blades. If you have a drift sock, I would suggest you bring it. We had a great trip but had to work harder that usual for the Walleyes. Let me know if you need any other info."
