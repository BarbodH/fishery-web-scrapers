534107,Guest,2003-08-04 10:46:00,0,"I have fished Lost Lake going on 4 years, in fact I am leaving August 7th. I stay at Lost Island Lodge. First the fishing...Fishing Lost Lake is pretty simple. This time of year the fish can be caught in 6 to 35 feet. However our best fishing comes from 17 to 25 feet. I usually fish with either crawlers or crankbaits. Others in my group fish leeches and minnows. I am convinced anything will work. Start with points, Islands, and reefs. All will hold fish. I have found bigger fish on the reefs, but the last three years the biggest Walleye of the group has come from main lake points. Running up to the main lake will take some time, depending on motor size. The water levels are down 3 to 4 feet, so extra caution will be needed. I could easily see a hour or two boat ride to the main lake, but agian it depends on how fast. I hope this helps. Wade"
