If you would like more info about which size boat to take for the size of your group, where to fish etc. you can contact me by clicking on the personal message icon (second from left at the top right of this reply)."

(10-12 years, good memory..but short) Class act, no surprizes on price, no extra charges. All boats are either new or newly remodeled and in excelent conndition. Many sizes to choose from. Has boats that go Friday to Friday, Saturday to Saturday, and Sunday to Sunday so it can fit almost any time frame. Here is the web site: www.floatinglodges.com Jim, his family and crew will treat you right. They even have a free mid week supply run. Give them a shout @ 1-800-743-5171. Good luck with your choice....The houseboat is really an awesome way to see LOW. You put your cabin where you want, and the fishing is also fantastic. We leave in 15 very long days. Swede"
