You may find the answer to your query if you are looking at Ontario at the following link.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/fishing/gen.html"

534247,Guest,2003-08-08 20:24:00,0,"In Manitoba 1 rod per person during open water. 2 hooks per line. A common rig here is the pickerel rig, with 2 hooks above a weight. I tie a hook onto a line with a palomar knot and a jig at the bottom."
