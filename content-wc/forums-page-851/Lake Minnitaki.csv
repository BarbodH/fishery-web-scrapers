534125,Guest,2003-08-04 15:26:00,0,Anybody have any fishing reports for Lake Minnitaki? I will be headed up on the 15th and I am interested in finding out what has been happening there as of late on the lake. I stay at Pickerel Arm camp when I'm up and would highly recommend them to anyone.
534131,iamwalleye1,2003-08-04 19:05:00,1589,Hey John I would like to wish you good luck. I am just moving this up so maybe someone can help! Let me know how you do! We are also leaving on friday the 15th 7:00 AM!
534138,Guest,2003-08-04 23:48:00,0,"Just returned from Sioux Lookout area July 31 - am going up again Aug 16. While we didn't actually fish Minnitaki, we had pretty good luck on the river that flows from Minnitaki to Abram & into Botsford (?) Lake - called either the Sturgeon River or Marchington River, depending on who you talk to. Also had some nice catches on some of the lakes down Alcona way, 15 or 20 miles down Hwy 643 from Sioux Lookout. Don't think you'll be dissapointed. Can't wait to get back up there!!! P.S. Why stay at Lodges? CAMP!"

Found my biggest in 18-21' of water. Had a hard time catching freezer pike (25-27""), most Pike were to big to keep. Smallmouth were few and far between. Biggest fish this year, 5+ Walleye and 13lb. Pike. Good luck, tell Lee and Larry I said hey. Bo"
534157,Guest,2003-08-05 10:26:00,0,Thanks all and Hi Bill are you still with Mazak? Let me know how you do! We are leaving at 3:00 am so maybe we won't cross path's unless it's at the border but I don't think any of us will get stuck there for four hours. My buddy just brought the biggest lund they make sure is nice makes my 16ft look like a minnow.
