534168,bigfish1965,2003-08-05 15:53:00,3210,I read it online. It was referring to license sales in Canada. A drop over the last few years is noted especially in urban areas.I'll see if I can find the info.
534175,Guest,2003-08-05 19:34:00,0,"All this abuse about not giving out your ""HOTSPOTS"" is wearing me down. I have shared my spots for years and I have always found that it results in making everbody a better fisherman and helps all of us catch fish. The most important distinction between fisherman and idiots is the proper management of the resource. Treat your catch kindly and release it to fight again and propagate. If we are all good fisherman the resource will be there for generations. So share them hotspots and practice catch and release. After all ...its just for fun."
534182,Guest,2003-08-06 06:40:00,0,I do agree with helping your fellow fisherman out. Case in point since we are on the subject of helping out does anyone have any info on Halleys camp fishing out of caribou falls. Thank you
534220,Guest,2003-08-07 16:34:00,0,"all posts on here are done voluntarily, no one is holding a gun to peoples heads and making them reveal their info, if a guy wants to help another guy out he should certainly be able to without being criticized. if you don't want to then you have no reason to be on this website at all since the whole reason behind walleye central is the quest to become a better fisherman."
534108,Ivy,2003-08-04 11:18:00,556,"I don't want to be to philosophical here but JP is asking about more things than just fishing. Why be generous with your fishing information? Why not be greedy and keep all the information to your-self? In fact, why help anyone at all. Why go out of your way to help someone else? I guess you can go through life taking care of #1 and only your self. However, I think in the end you will not be as fullfilled as someone who went out of his or her way to help another. My brother just finished a 10 day canoe/camping trip down the Mississippi. Just him and his dog. I asked him if he lost weight since he kept the amount of food he brought to a minimum. He said he would have if the people he met and camped with along the way didn't keep give him so much food and beer. Ivy"
534135,bigfish1965,2003-08-04 21:33:00,3210,"There has been a steady drop in the number of people fishing. You can point to a myriad of reasons all contributing to the decline. Some may say, "" Good more fishing spots for me."" But realize that in the long run, it is bad for fishing. The more people ( read taxpayers) enjoying the outdoors, the more will be spent on maintaining the resource. I had a great local honeyhole. I fished alone there for years. I've caught more ten pound walleye in the last 8 years than most catch in their lifetime. However, one thing occured to me. If something went wrong upstream, if a factory spilled or a farm dumped and wiped out the fish, who would care but me? No one, and there would be no one around other than me to testify to the need to protect this mini-fishery. So I let the word out slowly but surely. Now a group of us fish the spot with great success. There are none but catch and release guys. I don't tell people that I think will fill a freezer..at least I won't tell them enough. We have let it be known with the local MNR that this is an area to keep an eye on. It is a highly successful fishery and hopefully we can gather enough political clout to keep it that way. So, to make my long winded story short, we need the numbers. If it ever comes down to one last fisherman, no one will ever care. If you want to get someone hooked on fishing, give them a great first experience. We as a group have evolved tremendously over the last 30 years. No one would have ever thought to keep the small ones and let the big ones swim away in the 60's and 70's. Now we know better. Knowledge is the key."

Save the name calling for some other time, maybe it more closely resembles you. 2. I fish for only enough to feed me for the week and possibly 1 days catch to bring home for family. I have been fishing Canadian lakes with family since I was four. In fact I have been canoeing and camping for 18 years, much less destructive than your outboard motors. This year canoeing is out of the question since my girlfriend is unable to paddle. So next time think before you insult fellow fisherman. -David"
534144,Guest,2003-08-05 06:34:00,0,"Lac Seul fished out? bwwaaaaa haaaa haaaa. You obviously are on crack. As for the whole sharing/not sharing fishing spots, GPS points, bait secrets....blah blah blah. You have to be a real dikchead to NOT share that info. if someone asked - stop being so dang conceded - no you don't have to tell them everything (god forbid), but hook a brother up, help him out, let him catch some fish too (oh yeah, at Lac Seul its not even hard to catch a fish, so your ""hot-spots"" are probably not really even that hot). That is the whole point of fishing, getting others to enjoy the sport with you. And what is more enjoyable than catching the fish? Not much. Lastly, as for Lac Seul going to be overfished in the years to come - you are on crack too. There is so much freakin water up there its not even possible to overfish that lake. The size of the lake alone will not allow it to be overfished, not to mention the slot and limits. My two cents. >Actually those people who read about Lac Seul and believe it >is good fishing have been sucked in. Lac Seul is fished out >and is not the place to go. So please jp dont go there you >will be wasting your time."
534150,MK,2003-08-05 08:02:00,322,"So what you're saying is that all of the lakes you fish, the ""secret spots"", the type of lure and/or presentation you use, etc. all come from exhaustive research on your part. You've never asked for or read about any of these things? Even if you've read about it, you're using someone else's information. I think that most of us, if we look back honestly, will find that most of our fishing abilities come from advice or suggestions freely given to us by fellow fishermen or ""bought"" from guides. Same goes for our favorite fishing spots. We didn't just fall into these lakes, even though we have fallen into some of them, someone pointed us in the right direction."
534154,Guest,2003-08-05 08:58:00,0,"Mike, they're not buying your ""fished out"" story. Maybe you should have mentioned the alligators of McKenzie Bay."
534155,Ivy,2003-08-05 09:58:00,556,"Bill WI, I read your response to Mike's post on Lac Suel. I don't know MikeKansas but he might want his hook, line and sinker when you're done with it. Ivy"
534156,Guest,2003-08-05 10:16:00,0,"Bigfish, Out of curiosity, where did you learn fishing was on the decline. I have heard it is actually rising. In fact, some research I reviewed, albeit published in 1998, showed fishing to have the #1 growth rate of any recreatoinal activity in America, just ahead of snowboarding. And, of course, the number of anglers, particularly American, going into northwest Ontario each year continues to rise. If you have studies revealing decline, I would like to know from where, just for research and interest purposes."

Because I have experianced first hand how a nice little lake was stripped of all walleyes over 10"" by one party who followed my vehicle tracks to gain acess to the lake. Before that he coundn't figure out how to get on the lake! If you or anybody else wants waypoints you can get them the sameway I did. By the way even a ""guest user"" like yourself, can click on the icon and send me an e-mail, I'd be happy to compare notes with you. ;) John"

534045,Guest,2003-08-01 16:41:00,0,"Why do you guys advertise all of your fishing spots. Point in case Lac Suel. Each year the crowds get larger soon you will be complaining how poor the fishing is. Let these fishermen find the spots the way most of did, hard work and exploring."
534049,Guest,2003-08-01 18:16:00,0,Because we all help each other on Walleye Central.
534056,Guest,2003-08-02 00:03:00,0,i agree with old guy. whats wrong with having a few spots from other guys. adds to the collection we all have.
534060,Guest,2003-08-02 05:32:00,0,"first ,on walleye central we assist one another, 2 ontario with the slot limit , i doubt if it will become overfished as in yrs past .seems the fisherman for most part on lac suel respect the slot limit ,which insures fish for the future ."
534092,Guest,2003-08-03 20:26:00,0,"1) Today's ""hot spots"" are always in a state of flux 2) A general location might just have a ""spot on the spot"" that, if one doesn't find, isn't going to sell it out anyway 3) On my ""home"" Candadian water of Lake of the Woods, there are so MANY spots to fish, I'm not worried about it - I could give away 90% of my spots and still have enough secrets to keep me busy for two weeks 4) I've got such confidence in my fishing skills that, if I can't go to ""plan B"" and catch just as many fish, I'd better take up bowling 5) Like the others have said.....we're all just out to have a good time and share a bit of cameraderie anyway Lunk II"
534093,Guest,2003-08-03 20:27:00,0,I have to agree with the individual that wrote this post. It appears as though the majority of fisherman out there today coudn't find or catch fish if someone or some show wasn't telling them where to go and what to use.
534094,Matches,2003-08-03 20:55:00,236,"JP, this is fishing. I believe everyone has a few spots they're not going to mention here unless someone else mentions it first. I mean, everyone has got to have a few places they want to believe no one else knows about, right? Even if you really don't catch the lunkers there??? By the way, I caught 2 9 pounders yesterday at my secret spot, (cough, cough, cough)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

534104,NateW,2003-08-04 08:54:00,96,"I think all of us outdoorsman have an obligation to ""pass it on"". Whether it's good places to fish, tips on quality equipment or just plain getting someone involved for the first time. I think we owe it to each other to not just make things better for oursleves, but to also make things better for each other and for those wanting to get started. The information shared on this board is intended to improve everyone's walleye fishing experience, and the regulars on this board live up to their obligation to perpetuate their dedication this sport. I am proud to say that I have taken a couple of friends who were non-fishermen when we first started hanging out, and I have converted them into serious walleye-chasers! Now one of those guys at age 39 has purchased his first shotgun, spent some time at the trap range, signed up for a hunter's safety course, and is going pheasant hunting with me on opening weekend. It's never too late to bring somebody into the ""brotherhood"" of outdoorsmen. If it takes a big Iowa rooster or a nice Lac Seul walleye to make them addicted for life, it's worth it! You never have enough hunting or fishing buddies! Besides, I have noticed that being a ""teacher"" of the sport has somehow made me a better ""student"" of the sport . Does that make sense? Has anybody else noticed that?"
534106,Guest,2003-08-04 09:33:00,0,Actually those people who read about Lac Seul and believe it is good fishing have been sucked in. Lac Seul is fished out and is not the place to go. So please jp dont go there you will be wasting your time.
