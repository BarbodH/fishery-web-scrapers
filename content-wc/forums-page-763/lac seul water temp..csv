547552,Guest,2005-05-03 10:53:00,0,I reviewed the Water Temp data for the middle of Lac Seul and it is 4.5 C right now. This was about the same as the beginning May 2004 (maybe one week ahead now). The temps have cooled off in NW Ont since the third week of April and that has slowed the water temp from warming. But warmer temps are forcasted for later in the week so the lakes and rivers should start to warm up again.
