Has anyone been there and how was your experience? How was the smallmouth fishing at this time of the year. What would your lure choices be for the pike? Any info would be appreciated."

547652,Guest,2005-05-06 15:24:00,0,"Hi, I have fished sandybeach lake several times. Stayed at the other camp that is on the lake. There are only two camps on this lake with no public access. Mostly a northern pike lake, with some smallmouth and lake trout. Mostly fished july and august. Baits for northern pike, spoons and mepps spinners along with 5 inch rapalas. Stoped at pinecliff once and it looked like a nice camp. Larry"
