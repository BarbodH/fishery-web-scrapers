""We have determined that the existing size limits haven’t had a significant beneficial impact on the walleye population in the Bay of Quinte, but have had a negative impact on the economies of local communities,"" said Ramsay. ""Removing the slot size regulation will increase angling opportunities without adversely affecting the numbers of larger fish."" Under the regulation change, anglers will now be able to keep walleye that are up to 63 centimetres long in parts of Lake Ontario, including the Bay of Quinte and Prince Edward County. For all of Lake Ontario, the walleye catch and possession limit is four fish under a sport fishing licence, and two fish under a conservation licence. For both types of licence, anglers are also allowed to keep one walleye greater than 63 centimetres long. ""I certainly support this decision,"" said Ernie Parsons, MPP for Prince Edward-Hastings. ""This is a top notch walleye area in Ontario and removing the lower size limit is good news for anglers and our local economy."" The ministry implemented a size limit for walleye in eastern Lake Ontario in 2002 following public consultation over concerns about the health of the walleye population in the Bay of Quinte. A review of the slot limit found that it only resulted in a 10 per cent drop in overall angling harvest and didn’t have a beneficial effect on the breeding walleye population. The regulation change is in effect pending the results of the regulation review currently under way. The ministry is developing a fisheries management plan for the Bay of Quinte in partnership with stakeholders. This plan will guide future fisheries management decisions.
