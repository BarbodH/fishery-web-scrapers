547515,Guest,2005-05-02 16:05:00,0,"I just flew over Lac Seul last week, and it was open north past Taylor Island. Big V usually opens up sooner that Lac Seul, so I would assume that it is open as well. I'm way up north on a reserve teaching right now, but the weather in Sioux was fantastic up until a week or so ago. The snow is back, but I'm pretty sure the water is open."
547735,Guest,2005-05-10 08:04:00,0,"I was out fishing for walleye on Minitaki two years ago on some deep water humps. There was another boat fishing the same hump, and they caught two huge Lakers. They were easily 20-30 pounds each. After you go through the chutes from Lake Abram we went to the right into open water. The water comes up from 100+ feet to about 30 feet. Not sure what they were using. I think it was live bait. Good luck!"
546782,Guest,2005-04-04 20:32:00,0,"is this a good spot for a couple of ladys to try lake trout fishing this spring, or would another lake in the area be better??? regards brenda"
546789,Guest,2005-04-05 10:27:00,0,I would say that Big Vermillon would be a very good choice. The trout are not real big but there are alot of them.
546796,Guest,2005-04-05 16:06:00,0,"hey jimmy jig. have a place on minitakki and tried big v once last year in may and could mark fish but could'nt connect. need advice- what do you use,what areas of the lake and how deep do you target, how deep do you get your baits. how fast how far back etc. would like to try again in late may or mid june. catch and release only as i don't care to eat them when 15 -18"" walleyes are numerous. thanks, don"
546803,jimbo,2005-04-05 18:47:00,223,I go the first of June (june10th) for a week. I stay at DeerPath Lodge. The lake trout are good at Big Vermillion. Nice place to fish
546814,Guest,2005-04-05 20:57:00,0,"thanks for the info. guys, i would think you want to fish near shore or around the islands for the seson opener right?"
546818,Bryan Baker,2005-04-06 04:57:00,6,"i have a cabin on botham bay on big vermillion lake just up from what used to be big vermillion lodge. i do not fish lake trout but chase some serious muskie, pike and smallies. i have met people from around the world that come to big V for the trout numbers and sizes. i have seen many lodge boats from around sioux lookout area on big v as the guides take them out and do well. there are a couple shelves in the bay they seem to concentrate on in early june. good luck and let me know if you need any muskie tips or a place to stay."
546853,Guest,2005-04-06 18:55:00,0,"bryan, would you care to share were the shelves are? e-mail me at [email protected] thanks brenda"
547459,Guest,2005-04-30 17:19:00,0,Lake has smaller trout that regulations have made very difficult to keep. Big Sandy has larger trout but not very tasty. Whitefish are good to eat too. Mark S
547463,Guest,2005-05-01 07:37:00,0,"Hey, we stay at Country Camping right on Big Lake Vermillion. Any suggestions for muskie fishing (areas, rigs, times of the day)? We spent a half day on there and I got a muskie to raise beside the boat while trying to catch smallies, big sucker too....I am a newbie to muskie, have the pole and luers, just need some tips. Thanks!"
547473,Guest,2005-05-01 13:46:00,0,"Big V would be a great place to try for Lakers. Unfortunately, the number one bait, (that being large minnows) is no longer allowed. No live bait for Lake Trout starting this year. However, the lake trout population is very high, with numbers up to 15 trout for two people in one day. There is quality despite what alot of people say, with fish over 34 inches possible, although it is true that there aren't that many of them being caught. Fish from 18-28 inches are more likely to be caught. Be very careful of the slot size though. Be sure to have your depth finder tuned in. It is mandatory to find mid lake humps, and to spot fish. Good Luck!"
