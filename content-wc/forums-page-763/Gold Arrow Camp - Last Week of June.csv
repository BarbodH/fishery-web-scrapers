I would really appreciate any information or tips that anyone has about the camp and the numerous lakes - which lakes, where we will find the fish at that time, what you used, etc....I would guess we would be bottom bouncing, agree? Thanks for any help or suggestions. Bob"
546750,Trailerguy,2005-04-02 11:17:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]I went there for many years before buying my own cottage up the road. I still fish some of those lakes every year. Click on the PM Icon after my username and I'll try to answer your questions.
546767,Guest,2005-04-04 08:57:00,0,"went there last year for the first time at the end of July, can't complain about the numbers of fish that we caught, only in 8-10 feet of water. I must admit that putting the boat in and out every time got to be alot of work towards the end of the week. I would definatly get a 4 or 5 horse motor instead of the 9 horse that they give you. Take salted minnows, thats all that we used for the whole week and that worked fine.Make the extra effort and do the portages, its well worth the effort. Last year we were the only group that portaged and we caught the greats numbers of fish. good luck I wish I was going with you."
546769,Guest,2005-04-04 09:19:00,0,Been there three times and twice at the end of June. They will give you good info on where to fish and what lake is hot. We have used minnows and white and chartreuse twister tails and the Walleye fishing was always good. Seemed like the shallow 6/10 was always best for us and try to fish the banks and points with the wind blowing in on them. GOOD LUCK
547692,Guest,2005-05-08 22:58:00,0,"My father owned this lodge back in the 50's and was all log cabins. Great place, great fishing, used to catch lots of walleye off the dock in the evening. THere was stories of a 6 foot plus muskie swimming around across from the camp near the cliffs. There was also a huge eagle nest up there that I remember. Hooked into a few big ones when I was a kid, that broke my line pretty quick, so we never knew for sure. :O) But it was a good story. There was also a lot of big jackfish caught at the end of the resort to the left in the shallow weed filled bay. 14# plus that I remember. Would love to go back there some day. Also remember a BIG black bear trying to get into our kitchen at the main lodge one night and was shot by my uncle through the screen door. WOW.Great excitement when I was a kid in the 50's. Memories are great.:O) Hope you all have a great day. Gage Perth"
547693,Guest,2005-05-09 00:50:00,0,Hi. those memories sound great. I too have good memories of canada when I was still in the single digits. You should put those down on paper so they are not lost. someday they might be all we have left the way the world is going.
