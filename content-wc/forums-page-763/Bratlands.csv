547601,Guest,2005-05-05 10:50:00,0,Hi. is this the place where you would turn north to go to ear falls and points north? this was a gift shop on the corner? what happened to it that it closed?
547602,Guest,2005-05-05 11:02:00,0,"I think you are thinking of another store. Bratlands was farther west of the turn to go north to Ear Falls. It was on the south side of the road. It closed last summer after some financial trouble, I guess. I don't know if someone else has moved into the building or not. It is a good location. the world according to grumpy"

I heard they had some fuel tanks leaking into the ground. The guy next door has lots of gifts and tackle. The Shell station just east of the old Bratlands place."
