The west end is typical reservoir and is clay colored. Depending on how hard the wind blows determines how much silt is stirred up. There are days when you can't see 3 feet down and then there are days when you can see 8 feet down. I have never worked with an ""aqu vu"" so I am not exactly sure how good they are in stained water of this magnitude."
