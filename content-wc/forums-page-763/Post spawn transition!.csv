Unlike a few years ago when we hit the spawn dead on and catching big fish was absolutely unbelievable. My experience this early in the season is somewhat limited and need to know or at least be reminded of some things that will indicate a transition and if bays, points, etc are the key. Most of our fishing this year will be out of the Sioux Lookout area on Minnitaki and Pelican Lakes. Have fished this area a few times in the spring, but mostly in the fall. I'm really getting anxious to go and will be taking some first timers and want to show them the time of their lives. So anyone willing to chat about possibilities would be greatly appreciated. Most times I go all I need to worry about is myself and have been fairly successful in getting on fish. Will be going to an outpost the following week up on Lac Seul. Can't wait to get there as I know that section really well. Best of all, my only son will be in the outpost group and I can't wait to make some wonderful memories with him. Thanks in advance...refreshing your memory will also help me! eyesnatcher"
