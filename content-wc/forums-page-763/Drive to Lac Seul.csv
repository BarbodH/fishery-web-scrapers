547682,rebelrn2001,2005-05-07 20:20:00,1563,I'll be with the wife near Dryden the week of the 11th of June. My 2 cousins are going to be on Lac Seul. We are going to drive up to fish with them for a day (I've been there with them but that was 2 years ago). How long of a drive is it from Dryden (to Fisherman's Cove) and what highway do I take when going north off of 17? I can't make it out from their web site...it's too fuzzy. Thanks.
547683,Rich J,2005-05-07 22:52:00,65,rebelrn Take 105 north at Vermilion Bay. I think Fisherman's Cove is about 1 1/2 hours (80 mi.) from Dryden. Someone else might be able to give you a more accurate time. Rich J

547687,rebelrn2001,2005-05-08 14:35:00,1563,"Thanks guys. I'll plan on at least 2 hrs drive time plus maybe a stop for gas. If anyone has an updated estimated time please post. If we're too early, I can always fish a little bit waiting for my cousin's to get on the water. Dan"

547721,rebelrn2001,2005-05-09 15:32:00,1563,"Great, I'll do 75-80 on 105. I hear it isn't a very hilly or crooked road so I can go really fast. Driving really fast at dawn is my favorite. My vehicle weighs over 5000 pounds and a moose only weighs, what, about 1000? so I shouldn't have a problem if I hit one right?"
547722,Guest,2005-05-09 16:54:00,0,"I don't recomend speeding up 105. Last year our driver got nailed for a $100 ticket (could have been worse, The speed he was going actually warrented a MANDITORY court Plus a MIN> $300 fine). There is a OPP (county mounty) sub station on 105 in Ear Falls. We now call the local police --""OH -- Pee Pee"" !!:rotflmao:"
