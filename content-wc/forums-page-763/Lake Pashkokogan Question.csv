I would appreciate any information you may have on this fishery. I have a place to stay and my own boat. This lake is near the end of Pickle Lake Road in Northern Ontario. We will primarily search for walleyes but would be interested in northern fishing hints, as well. Can't wait! Good fishing to all the Walleye Central contributors. Dr. Lee"
