547597,Guest,2005-05-05 08:02:00,0,This is a great forum. I discovered it about a month ago. I am making my first trip to Lac Seul in July. I have heard so many good things about this lake. Where can I get a good fishing map of the lake? We will be staying around the Scout Bay area. Where are some good areas to fish within a reasonable distance? Thanks.

There are four maps for Lac Seul, and you will want the Southwest map if you are staying in the Scout Lake area. You will be traveling at least 30 min to get to the good spots. Big Island, McKenzie Bay are 15+ miles away, but that is where the fish are going to be at in July. You will catch a ton on just about any windy point. RESERVE A GUIDE FOR THE FIRST DAY!!!!! If you want, E-Mail me at [email protected] and I will give you a few pointers on Lac Seul."

I agree with above that is the place to get maps--as I have gotten several there myself. However I believe what you want is the NW map not SW. The NW Map includes MacKenzie Bay and the other places you will fish. In all our previous trips to LS we have never boated outside the NW Map. There are some very good places close to Scout Bay. Any one of the islands in Bay of Islands will produce good fish. Bay of Islands is right were Scout Bay opens to LS. The first three islands you see as you come out of Scout Bay have always produced nice fish. Fish the side getting hit by the most waves. The third island has a sandy shoreline. When the waves are pounding that beach it stains the water several feet out. Troll along the line of stained and unstained water--we call it the slime line, and you'll do well. You can take a lot eater-sized fish from the mouth of Scout Bay. We will be there July 22 - 29. Go ahead and click on my e-mail if you have any more questions."

Click on the number and it will pull up a PDF file. Good places to fish, Mckenzie bay, Broad lake, and South Bay good places for walleye. Pike you can catch just about anywhere. good luck"
