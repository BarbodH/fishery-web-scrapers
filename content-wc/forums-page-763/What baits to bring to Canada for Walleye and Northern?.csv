547705,Guest,2005-05-09 11:48:00,0,What lake and when are you fishing?
547708,Guest,2005-05-09 12:25:00,0,Just bring plenty of beer and bug spray....the fish will jump in your boat.

Don't take beer with you from the states, buy real beer up there. Nothing like a REAL Labatt Blue, I can taste it now. MMMMMMMMMM. See those 'eyes frying up, smell the spruces, listen to the loons, wow."

For walleye it is like any other, it depends on the depth and the bottom and how big the area is, are you going to anchor and cast over a spot? or are you going to slow troll w/a bottom bouncer? A jig w/a minnow or leach or crawler will all work. You can cast a Rapala type lure too if the depth is right (water and lure). If the fish are there, they are like any other fish, they will bite if presented the way you learned in the states."

547727,Guest,2005-05-10 01:15:00,0,Hi. just bring money. Its probably cheaper than hauling all that stuff all that distance anyway. the canuks need it anyway.
547729,Guest,2005-05-10 02:43:00,0,"Spoons(johnsons silver minnow 3/4 oz)and some daredevils same size red/white,firetiger, five of diamonds,some husky jerks,tenn shad, firetiger,blue/white,silver/white.Some rattle craps 3/4,1oz same basic colors then experement with different colors.It seems that every body of water has a HOT color(the one you don't have of course)For walleye bring some spinners with different colored blades ,hammered silver works best for us,jigs/twister tails,green,white,black(you can also tip the johnsons with a tail),some smaller rapalas, shad raps same colors.Try to bring a wide assortment of of sizes and colors,and don't stick with one thing.What the fish were killing today they won't even look at tomarrow.Hope this helps,good luck,and have a great time!!!

547730,lobo1,2005-05-10 04:07:00,734,"It kinda takes the fun out of the trip - not taking a bunch of stuff - but we could do fine with just a few items. In 7 trips to 5 differant camps we would have done just fine with metallic gold jig heads and white power bait tails; on our last few trips we ended up using strips of meat cut from the belly of walleye and didnt even use the power bait(although this may be illegal in places - it is quick, easy, catches fish, and doesn't fall off). Our other lure would have to be the firetiger bomber long A - hands down the best bait at all camps we went to for pike and walleyes alike (when not jigging). Throw in a few Johnson silver minnows in various colors (bring some of the big ones too) and add a few titanium leaders and you are good to go. Now I always brought my big tackle box full of lures and baits but these above worked very well at every place we went to. lobo1"
547732,Guest,2005-05-10 05:58:00,0,"I bring a ton of tackle up north every year, but I catch 99% of fish on five different things; 1. A 1/4 ounce jig (bright colors like white, orange, chartreuse) 2. Spinner rigs in the same jig colors plus hammered nickle 3. Size 18 orignal Rapala in Gold/Fluorescent Red 4. 3/4 ounce Johnson Silver minnow tipped with white or chartreuse. 5. Bass style spinners"
