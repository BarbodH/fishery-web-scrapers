547564,Guest,2005-05-03 18:53:00,0,THought about making a few spinner rigs with circle hooks. Has anyone tried this? DId it work? What size hooks did you use? ANy info would be great
547566,Guest,2005-05-04 08:09:00,0,"I'm planning to tie a few myself as an experiment. I have not used them on trolled rigs yet. Here's a link from the SF forumhttps://www.walleyecentral.com/dc/dcb...ng_type=search do an advanced search on circle hooks and you'll probably know more. My only chance to use these rigs will be from 6/25-7/5. I've begun using circles for virtually all of my live bait fishing and like them alot, mainly for ease of release."

The line just slides out of the corner of the mouth and the barb catches there. They also work well for a simple bait rig when drifting or still fishing near feeding areas."
