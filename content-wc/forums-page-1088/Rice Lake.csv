Worth checking out -- their website is:http://www.ricelakecanada.com/elmgrove.htmlThere's a whack of other places on Rice and many of them have a web presence. Do a search on Rice Lake and the names of some of the towns around the lake if you want more info. BTW the wallys can be hit or miss this past June was poor, the one before treated me very well. If it was me, I'd try and go a little earlier than the last of June. Book early though, the accommodations fill up for when school is out in the States."
