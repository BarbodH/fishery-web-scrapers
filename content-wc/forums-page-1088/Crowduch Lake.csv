506779,Guest,2000-01-11 18:07:00,0,I am planing on fishing Crowduck Lake in Manitoba and I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this lake in the summer. Thanks

It is really something, almost like a fairy tale - lots of big walleyes, catch litterally dozens and dozens of 21-24"" and if lucky some over 26""to30+"". The north end seems to have fewer but bigger fish. Take lots of white grub tails, 3""- 4"", and your favorite jig heads, and a couple of tubs of minnows per day. And bug juice!The lodge there is first class, actually the whole operation is first class. Great fishing! If you want to stay at the lodge and don't have a reservation, Book now for the summer of 2002!"

Although the crowduck lake camp is booked until 2002, there are a couple other lodges that have boat caches in this lake and offer day trips. If you need any more info, just ask, or e-mail me."
