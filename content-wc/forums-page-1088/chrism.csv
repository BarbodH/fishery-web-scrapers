506795,Guest,2000-01-11 22:18:00,0,"HeyI've learned to fish that river a bit at a time - started by renting a boat from T.end camp in the late 80's and finding my way east a little each time. I learned to fish the area by myself (got a long way to go!) and found most of the reefs by being on the water for both the high water level and low level years. I fish mainly with my girlfriend and a few others, and basically have found the spots with a combination of maps/sonar/structure/guides and mostly luck!. I have been lucky enough to spend about 25-30 days a year out there for the past 5 years, mostly extended weekends... I'm now in a green lund with a 50honda - perhaps we've passed on the water?!?How about you?"

I've worked for eagle nest the last three years, the last two as a guide. I have a cottage somwhat near trail end, so I've been there my whole life pretty much."
