506734,Guest,2000-01-04 21:18:00,0,i heard the new regs were that by 2009 everybody had to take a course unless they were 55 or older.By 2002 you well have to take a course to drive a small boat (12-15) foot. there are lots of new rules you can get a book at SGI or some places sell them.walleyeman

506735,Guest,2000-01-10 19:04:00,0,"walleyeman:This is what I understand about the new operator cards.1. All operators born after April 1, 1999 have to have their cards by Sept. 15, 1999.2. All operators operating craft under 4 meters in length including Power Water Craft must have it by Sept. 15, 2002.3. All operators must have their cards by Sept. 15, 2009.For more info try this site.http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/obs-bsn/main.htmSifter."
