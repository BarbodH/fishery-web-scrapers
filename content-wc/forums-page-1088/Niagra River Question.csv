I don't know if it's the regulations so much, or if it's more that there are no boatlaunches above the rapids. The lower niagra is full of rapids, and whirlpools, so I don't know whether it's safe to run a regular boat on them."
506705,Guest,1999-12-28 12:39:00,0,Go get your steak...on the canadian side park your car near clifton hill...you can walk downthe path that leads to the bottom of the falls....at this point your fishing withinview of falls...
