506697,KnottyBuoy,1999-12-27 06:29:00,110,It is one of the best lake trout lakes in Ontario. Long and very deep but the water is crystal clear. We stayed at Lumber Jack Lodge on the south end last year for a week and Whiskey Jack Lodge on the North end this past summer. Both are excellent resorts and the owners treat their customers very well. We never caught a walleye on Sturgeon but their are excellent lakes near by for day trips to catch both walleyes and northerns......and it is a beautiful area.....we saw moose and bear on both trips......You will love it. We downrigged for the trout but many people jig for them with artificials........both methods produced.

506699,KnottyBuoy,1999-12-30 08:58:00,110,The one I was referring to is North of Ignace about 50 clicks......big...big lake....
506700,Pooch,1999-12-30 14:53:00,4619,"Thanks for the feed back. I think we are on the same page. The few folks I've spoke with seem to point out to me that Sturgen Lake (just south of Savant Lake!!) is a great Lake trout lake, with poor Walleye fishing. How about the northern end of the lake? I'm not sure I know how to fish for anything but Walleye anymore! So I'm still looking and pondering. Once we have found a camp and lake that we like I am nervous about trying a new lake and camp. But there are way more lakes up there than I'll ever get to set my foot in. Life is way too short!!"
506701,KnottyBuoy,2000-01-01 08:26:00,110,We stayed on the North end last year at Whiskey Jack resort ........many of the guests did fly in trips for Walleyes to other lakes but the resort does keep boats and motors on remote lakes that you can drive to. We fished Squaw Lake and did well on walleyes and caught some niced sized northerns as well. You can catch the trout with no problems but the walleyes are tough to locate......due to the depth of the lake......we used downriggers for the trout but they are down about 60 feet so whatever you can do to get a bait down to them........Once you catch a few trout you will like it.......you are also only 50 miles from Lac Seul if you want to take a road trip towards Souix Lookout. Lots of options in that part of the world......We are seriously thinking about a trip to St. Joseph lake up towards Pickle Lake.......highly restricted but is suppose to be excellent for walleyes and big pike.......can't wait to get back up.......Good luck on planning your trip.....
