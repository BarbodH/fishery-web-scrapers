Last time I was up 12/18 the sport shops were closed, still? I have heard there is approx. 3-6"" snow and approx. 12"" ice with some plowing of ice roads. How about crappies around Nestor? Any info on LOTW from Nestor to Sioux Narrows would be greatly appreciated!! I will have a report on1/10."

Hven't seen one re: Sioux Narrows or Nestor Falls.""Ice fishing this week got off to a good start. Most of the week saw good activity with a goodnumber of eating sized walleye, and a few sauger and jumbo perch to boot. I would not say limits foreveryone everyday, but close to it. The shallower houses on the reefs (18 to 22 feet) out produced thedeeper houses. Best presentation early in the week was a minnow on a plain hook, with a smallsplitshot and bobber. Fished on a dead stick. Later in the week the plain hook continued to work, butaggressive jigging with Jig-O-Wopper type jigs, and Swedish Pimple type spoons tipped with a minnow headworked the best. On Friday, Brenda Wilson of Minneapolis caught a 28"" walleye she plans to havemounted. Fishing on Sunday was a little slower with a mini weather front blowing through.Ice conditions are good with the thickness being way in excess of a foot. Snow cover is alittle sparse, with the winds blowing some areas clear of snow. Snowmobiling conditions are tolerable.http://www.baystorecamp.com""Hope to hear from you soon regarding renting your cabin in July."
