506690,Guest,1999-12-31 05:47:00,0,"Mike i assume you mean cabonga reservoir near manawaki quebec. It's a big body of water, many islands. I haven't fished there for 20 years. The water level can really very from day to day. Went fishing with a buddie there. One day we tie his boat up with anchor out [only 10 lbs.] in the dry sand. the next morning we wake up the boat had drifted away! Water was up 2 feet! Many walleye and pike there. If i had the choice i would travel about an hour further north to la verendrye park. It is a provincial park with many lakes including part of the cabonga. There are first class accomodations at le domain. This is an area run by the parks people. With each cottage you get a boat for each 2 people and rights to fish a lake of your choice. Again this has been 20 years ago but was great accomodations. I have also fished at the other end of the park at barage dozois. You can fish off the shore for walleye below the dam. My wife and i fished there and caught over 100 walleye up to 3 lbs in 2 days from shore. I'm not sure where you are from but the fishing license is very expensive for a non resident like myself. Any more info e-mail me...larry"
