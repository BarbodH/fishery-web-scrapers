506632,Guest,2000-01-05 21:23:00,0,Could someone tell me when is best time of the day go to Scugog for walleye? I heard that there is no luck between 8 AM and 4 PM. Is it true?What to use for the bait?
506633,walleyed,2000-01-06 20:40:00,11,Found over the years that scugog is best at dusk but also can be good in the am until about 10 am.Smaller spoons tipped with minnows seem to work fine. Also leadhead jigs with minnows. Set lines are live minnows about 2-4 inches long. Hope this helpsWalleyed
506634,walleyed,2000-01-06 20:44:00,11,Spoke too soon. My hut blew down the lake about 500 feet on tues. Broke things up a bit.What a mess. Well i guess I have some repair work to do.Need stronger anchor rope I guess or maybe just remember to tie it better..Walleyed
