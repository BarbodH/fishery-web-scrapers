506792,KnottyBuoy,2000-01-12 06:40:00,110,Is that the north end of the lake or south end? We drove to a Squaw Lake on the north end ......not a good road and you would never get your own boat in.......the resort had rental boats back there. On the southern end there were several lakes you could drive to. .......But the roads are terrible and the landings are worse. Lumber Jack Lodge on the southern end had some rental boats on trailers that he let us use to gain access to some walleye lakes......Lake of the Bays and Wintering Lake.......

The best advise I can give is, check with the camp. They usually have large maps and they will tell you were to fish. Most of the lakes that I have been to, there would be no way of getting a larger boat on (no ramps & some portaging). When are you planning your trip?"
