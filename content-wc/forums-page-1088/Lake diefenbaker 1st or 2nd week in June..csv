The water level as you know, makes a big difference on Diefenbaker at any time, but I've had lots of success running blades behind bottom bouncers in relatively shallow water. I've also had pretty good success pitching jigs and crankbaits to the Shallows in the very back ends of the coulees. The water is still pretty cool in early june and we've found that a lot of the big girls like to hang out back in the shallows on the south facing shoreline. We've caught some real nice fish in less than two feet of water at this time of year.As for how the tournament will affect the fishing, my guess is that due to the size and nature of the lake and the endless amount of structure, the tournament will have little or no effect. A week after, there'll be a whole new batch of fish. The fish seem to move around a lot in Diefenbaker. What might have been a hotspot one day, will be cold as heck the next. Pre-fishing for the Riverhurst tournament has taught me that. I've had many of my ""can't miss spots"" turn ice cold during tournament days."
