Lodges and Outposts Innoko 2021 Brett October 16, 2021 Innoko Pike 2021 The Year of King Rich July 3-18, 2021 Here we go! I love watching shows on the History Channel and the Discovery Channel. Searching for lost gold or lost cities is super interesting for me. Not so much because I expect them to find the gold but because I enjoy the quest. For 20 years I searched for a place to catch 30-inch 10lb walleyes on a semi-regular basis. I sent more than 30 years and more than 30 fly-ins and spent a lot of bucks only to come up empty. Then while watching a fishing show, I heard something that changed my approach. The comment was quite simple, something along the lines of If you want to catch big fish, you need to fish where the big fish live. I know duh but if you step back from the obvious part of the statement it was saying you need to search for the best water and spend your time fishing water where a 10lb walleye isn't 1 in 100,000 but maybe more like 1 in 20. From that show I learned about Hawk Lake lodge in 2016. I heard they typically catch 200+ 10lb walleyes a year. With a little quick math. If they run 200 guys through there in a season fishing on average 4 days each, I should have a good shot at a 10lb walleye if I fished for 4 days. My first 4 day trip yielded a beautiful 29- and 29.5-inch walleye but I couldn't quite claim a 30 but after 5 visits over 4 years I managed to catch multiple legit 10lb walleyes. Fish where the big fish live! After the success of the walleye quest, I switch over to chasing big pike. The magical pike quest is a 50in 30lb fish. I started looking for a place to catch a 50. Along the way I learned a lot. First they weren't the stupid rockets a lot of walleye fisherman hate. Catching 40in 20lb pike is every bit the challenge of catching a 10lb walleye, maybe more. One of my first stops in that quest was Great Slave. Trout Rock is a super lodge on GSL that regularly pumps out many big pike. During my visit in 2017 I met another super serious pike chaser who quietly mentioned that he had found the best place in North America for pike where his group of four regularly catches 200 40in pike in a week. The problem was he wouldn't discuss the name of the place or much more than it was in Alaska on the Innoko. I did manage to get his cell number and stayed in touch with him. I confirmed he wasn't talking about Midnight Sun, so I did a few web searches and came up with Safaris. I ultimately asked my new friend if this was the place and he said yes. I GOT IT! Step one a place that turns out a ridiculous number of big pike. Then the hard part began. A phone call to Safaris in September 2017 didn't generate a call back until November 2017. Then the interview began where I felt like I was being questioned for a job at the FBI. The owner is very particular and doesn't want to fish with guys he doesn't like. I must've passed the interview because he said he would let me know if he had any openings in February after the other regulars either locked in or passed on the upcoming season. BTW. His season is 6 or 7 weeks with 4 guys max. So basically 28 guys get this chance. My problem was the summer of 2018 was already booked with 3 trips, but I still was hoping for the invite. When the invite came in February, I was pretty disappointed to say I needed to pass but 2019 would work. He said OK let's touch base in late fall 2019. I made the call again in November and struggled to find guys who would put up the ~$6000 for a week of fishing no matter how much I talked up the fishing. Then COVID hit and everything changed. One of my groups that had two trips planned for $4000 total got cancelled and I convinced them Safari's was the best way to save the fishing season. Ultimately, they got to go in 2020 and caught 140 pike over 40inches during a 6-day trip which including a 50.25. I had to stay home and help keep my wife safe. They were extremely excited to go back in 2021 and I was able to join and due to a last-minute cancellation, we were able to get 2 full weeks for 1.5x the regular price. Here is the story of what happened. I arrived Thursday night at midnight at the Anchorage airport and made my way to our hotel. In the morning we hit the iHOP / Cabela's / Liquor store and made our way to the busiest float base in North America. The float base in Anchorage is really an amazing site with 100s and maybe 1000s of float planes. As usual we hurried up to be there at noon and didn't leave until closer to 3p. The flight to Holy Cross was approximately 3 hours and 320 miles W/NW of Anchorage. The tiny village of Holy Cross is about 150 people. It literally wasn't visible from the air at all. We only knew we were there when the runway of crushed rock appeared from about ½ miles away while on final approach. The changeover in Holy Cross was anything but smooth but the net/net was we departed at around 730p for the 140-mile boat ride upriver trip to the houseboat which would serve as home base for our quest of Alaskan pike. We arrived at the houseboat at around 1145p and the sun was casually thinking about setting. While we were there in July sunset was 1255a and sunrise was 4a. We unloaded onto the beautiful 1M$ houseboat equipped with 4 bedrooms down and 2 bedrooms up and 2×3 piece baths. Morning came quickly both literally and figuratively. We were up around 630a. We finally had breakfast and hit the water around 930a. The location we were fishing was the Innoko River. The houseboat parking space was strategically chosen many years ago by the owner. He parks his houseboat above all the flowage from the Yukon. By doing this he guaranteed himself much clearer water from other rivers like the Iditarod. Clearer water meant better visibility and better pike fishing. I should also mention the owner of Pike Safari's  Bruce Werba is a bit of a legend in western Alaska having made the area his home for more than 40 years. Some of his original fishing expeditions were literally from the pontoons of his tiny float plane. He would jump from slough to slough chasing pike. After running a successful fishing camp and very successful moose hunting business (200 hunters p/y), he invested in a 70ft 3 level houseboat to lead these safaris' for pikes. All of Bruce's equipment is top notch and super well maintained. We couldn't ask for a better operation. Bruce's fishing boat Ok on to the good stuff. The fishing! The first day we landed 34 pike over 40. I just typed that, and it sounds crazy, but it is true. We put most of the fish on the bump boards to prove and confirm our eyes weren't deceiving us. To add to the insanity, it was far from our best day. It was probably more like 3rd or 4th best of the 12 days we spent on the Innoko. Attachment 330022 Little fast on the pic. I was in the process of lifting it horizontal The Innoko is a major river system draining western Alaska. Although technically it is linked to the Yukon it is very much its own beast. In places she is more than 2 miles wide and every mile contains dozens of sloughs and creeks (20-40 ft wide and 4-10 ft deep and miles deep) once you travel/fish up the slough you find back lakes which are huge bodies unto themselves with 4-8 ft of water in normal water conditions. Most of the fishing occurs in the sloughs, back lakes, or where the slough feeds the main river. 95% of where we fished if you fell in, you'd only need to stand up. One exciting session started with sliding into a slough I know I had fished at least twice. During those sessions I'm sure we pulled out 4 or 5 40s, so it was a known good spot. As we slide deeper the outside of the turn was deeper with a nice big beaver house. I looked left at the shallow weeds behind heavy brush where the normal shore line would've been with lower water. I shook my head at the heavy matted weeds and casted right at the beaver house and prompted got snagged. Honestly in places the grass was as heavy as a nice front lawn with a bit of spring flooding. (6 inch tall grass and 4-6 inches of water). Steve on the other hand snapped on a Barney spoon and threw all the way to the very back of the grass. For those new to barney spoons they are literally the craziest looking spoon I have ever seen. (Call out to Mike for previously mentioning them) Well I am not sure if it was his first, second or third cast, I was busy with my snag, but suddenly I hear an explosive splash and turn in time to see a 25lb pike in maybe 4 inches of water cruising full speed out to the main river channel. I got to open my bail and wait for Steve to be dragged around by the beast before netting the 46″ pike below. Next we unsnagged me while Steve fired back to the front lawn grass and nailed another 46.5″ on the very next cast. A memorable session to be sure. Check out the grass behind Steve where he found this beast in 6 inches of water. 2nd cast into that grass yielded a second beast. 46 and 46.5 back to back casts! Special call out to the Barney spoon guys in Ohio. I don't think Steve could've fished anything else in that heavy stuff. Another session of note. It was about 4p and the sun was just starting to slide down a bit. In this particular slough the water was clearer than normal and we timed it JUST PERFECT. We could see about 3-4 ft deep into the water. The slough was 1-6ft deep so we could see all the pike laying literally everywhere you looked. They were 6 inches from shore in 4-6 inches of water. They were suspended in the top 2-3 feet of water in the middle and literally everywhere in-between. The absolutely best part of this session was they were all hungry or angry or whatever but any well placed cast was a guaranteed hit. You just needed to pick your pike! A few times a smaller pike would shoot after your bait and test your reflects to not hook up while targeting a big one but in general we caught 40+ a will by just picking our pike. As we hammered the pike Rich got more and more excited until he was literally standing in the bow of the boat like a 7ft center setting a pick. Thankfully I managed to cast around his pick a few times but he definitely did a great job of blocking me out. THANKS RICH! Honestly, I've wondered at times if I was meant to be a guide because watching his excitement was so contagious I didn't really care too much. Any big fish in the boat is a win for me and the team! Rich picking the big ones out of the slough Double headers are easy when you are shooting fish in barrel. Look at that girth! There were times where we fished back lakes and threw max effort casts but probably 50% of the time we were in the sloughs in tight quarters (20-40ft wide) fighting big fish. On our best days we were catching 100+ pike and the slower days it was probably more like 30, but the most amazing stat was that 20-30% of the fish were 40+ and built like offensive linemen. Tough broad heavy river fish that wanted to rip the rod out of your hands. As a point of reference, we weight one particularly heavy 43 in fish at 25.5 lbs. We had a 46 go 28lbs. Special number 3  Three lakes Three lakes is an area shaped like a clover leaf. With three lake lakes off the main river and was the place where the 50 came out of the year before. One evening in three lake my partner and I landed 38 pike over 40 with 12 45 or over. At one point we had 7 straight over 40. Including the story of the lost big one. Three Lakes beauty Beast MODE! Hey  I found one too! Ok. Story of the big one lost. Everyone/every trip has one of these stories. I'm going to tell it, but honestly it always feels like yadayada the big one got away. So here goes while fishing three lakes during the above big fish feeding frenzy my partner hooked up with a big pike. They were all big, but I say this because when they were ultra-feeding, they engulfed our 1oz spoons. Landing and unhooking big tough fish take a few minutes no matter the single barbless hooks. When I hooked her, I knew this fish was special. I had my drag on the Shimano Ventana turned almost all the way down having hooked so many big fish and this fish felt special. It turned approximately 20lbs of drag like it was nothing. I turned to my partner who was working his fish with the guide and said this one is special. Can you help over here? I was hoping the guide could control the boat so we wouldn't free drift while I was fighting this fish. They grunted they had their hands full. Ok. I'm on my own. The fish took 50ft of line left and another 50 on the run back to the right but it was still there so I was in the game. I was still hoping for a bit of boat control, but they continued the matter at hand. After several minutes of just hanging on to the fish it finally decided to run out to the middle of the lake. The boat was roughly perpendicular to the shore meaning I needed to raise my line over the roof of the 22ft boat from the bow or run the risk of cutting the line on the back of the boat/motors. Then it happened so quick I still can't quite figure out what happened. The fish was speeding behind the boat. I lifted the tip of the rod over my head as high as I could reach. The fish must have been deeper than I thought or who knows. I lifted my rod never feeling anything different until it was gone. At first, I thought the line was cut on a prop or maybe just broke. As I reeled in the line, I felt some weight and thought for a glorious moment maybe the fish was just swimming toward me. No such luck. What came back to me was a bit surprising. I got the spoon minus the ring holding the single hook on the spoon. Those rings were rated to well over 100lbs and the beast must've have straighted the ring or broke it. While sitting on the gunnel contemplating the glorious 50, I had just lost I noticed the other guys were finished and they asked me what happened. After explaining the story to Bruce, he said yep that's what the huge fish do. The 40-45 have speed and good strength. The 45+ fight down with incredible strength and are tough as heck. He said the rare 50 had both speed and incredible strength and had been known to make 125lb leaders fail and tear up drag systems. This ring was a first as normally he sees guys losing the single hook when the hook eye wasn't completely closed but losing the ring too was very rare case. Back to our successes. Here is some more big fish pics: Lots of doubles Beautiful day amazing fish Good example of the places we were fishing. Look at all that green. 20+ lbs. of Alaskan power! Doubles! Doubles! Why do I always have the smaller fish in these double pictures? Must be size of my hands! Lol Wow just wow! Hey! I think I got the bigger one here! Photobombing from Alaska Photobomb 2 Buddies! The weather for the 12 days was mostly good. We had one day of solid rain and 52. We had 3 days of highs in the 50s with off and on rain which is normal for this part of Alaska, but honestly, we were lucky and had 6 days of 65-75 and sun. I was super happy we could leave the rain gear in the bag more days than not. I would like to thank Rich, Steve, Steve for helping make this trip happen. Honestly, after I lost the 2020 trip this became their trip, and I am just along for the ride! Our guide fishing South of the houseboat  Griffin was amazing. He was patent, helpful, cooperative, and super fun to fish with. Also, a big thank you goes out to Bruce who clearly does this simply for the joy of seeing us catch fish while working his butt off at 70+ years old when a lot of successful Alaska businessmen would be retired on a beach somewhere. At the beginning of the trip Rich pulled out a crown and asked us to agree to a bet. The bet was whoever got the most 40+ would be declared King. They would get the crown and be proclaimed Pike king for the next year. We would all bow before the king and proclaim his greatness. We all agreed so here is the resulting picture. Final numbers: Week one 98 over 40 Week two 238 over 40 336 total 40+ of those 42 were over 44 By fisherman 105 Dick 93 Hummell 71 Brett 67 Steve Biggest 3×48.5 I'm limited in the number of pictures I can insert here so the full story with pictures is available on Mike Borger's site/Forum and my own blog. www.canadafishingtips.com"

6606618,Eckohlt,2021-10-30 03:22:00,3685,I'm in!!!
6608612,bthomas3333,2021-11-07 19:53:00,465,The lodging and fishing is very pricey (But similar to say LacLaMartre) but the big issue is chartering a flight to fly you 300 miles into the wilderness. It helps to share the charters with the groups in front and behind but no two ways about it...expensive trip. Brett
6617434,bthomas3333,2021-12-14 16:04:00,465,"Hello, I recently uploaded video of the fishing on the Innoko. If anyone is interested in the first 6 videos / go pro (45sec-6min) each. These are not professional video by any stretch but the quality is HD and it is a chance to see the scenery of Western Alaska and a few flashes of pike.

6606330,vteye3,2021-10-28 14:19:00,496,"Congrats BT on a great trip, Alaska has never failed to deliver on my prior trips. Incredible numbers of trophy fish, yeah dude any pike over 45 is a trophy even in Alaska. See any animals?"
6606370,bthomas3333,2021-10-28 17:45:00,465,"On the animal front. River Otters Saw black bears. More than a dozen moose. What looked like brown bear tracks (huge!) Biggest tracks I have ever seen. Bald Eagles everywhere including a juvenile bird that was roasting within 100 yards of the boat. The river otters are a cool story. During the 12 days, despite fishing all single barbless, we had 3 fish that appear to have died. One of the injured fish was released into a slough which we fished nearly every day. Well we returned the next day and turned a tight corner and stumbled on a bevy of otters snacking on the dead pike. We stopped and killed the engine about 30 feet from the 5 otters. They all stood up on their back legs. Looked at us, then looked at each other, and then looked at us again. I am pretty sure they had never seen a human. They were trying to figure out what we were and whether we were a threat. The stare off went on for about 10 mins and finally they grabbed the fish and retired to the deeper grass/swamp. It was amazing to see them trying to work out what was going on without the normal first instinct of animals we see where they just run away. Brett"
6606396,7 Mag,2021-10-28 18:57:00,1887,"I would of enjoyed seeing the otters, sounds like you had a great trip."
6606542,vteye3,2021-10-29 15:22:00,496,"Glad you saw some animals, Alaska sure is famous for everything being big: big bugs, big fish, big bears (Aug 2020 we found a track that was 7 wide and 13 inches long). The otters are neat, ferocious critters like everything in the weasel family."
