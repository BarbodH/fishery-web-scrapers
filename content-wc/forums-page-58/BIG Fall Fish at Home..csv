The big, stained shallow rivers and lakes of the area provide plenty great and remote fishing for walleye, pike and brook trout. Moving back to Eastern Ontario's Ottawa Valley I continue to visit the north, both in the east but eventually spending more time in Northwestern Ontario in Superior country. Amazing trout, pike and walleye fishing to be caught there as well, it's impossible not to love the trophy fishing and surroundings. But at home in the valley these past years fishing has been equally tough to beat. The variety of species, the endless seasons to chase such and, the caliber of trophy fishing to be found is truly remarkable. From all that Lake Ontario, the St.Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers plus the infinite cottage and back lakes provide, there's just often too many good choices for fishing. But one thing is for certain though, through spring and fall I just want the biggest, baddest and toughest to catch, as big, bad and tough as they come!A fall report, many BIG Muskies and a couple other badass fish examples can be found in the link below.https://bunksoutdoorangle.com/a-tonne-of-muskie-fun/"
