6618850,v-bay gord,2021-12-20 19:48:00,3168,I think I'm going to puke...
6618854,pjshorthorn,2021-12-20 19:58:00,5654,You should have never let Barbie Breast Implant operate the ice auger. That kind of simple harmonic motion ( vibration) can cause almost anything to explode...... PjShorthorn
6618918,Clairebear,2021-12-21 05:55:00,937,I thought this thread was about flying a drone.
6618968,prov1800,2021-12-21 09:39:00,5010,Have done 3 fishing shows.All 3 of the camera guys had drones with them and they each took a few minutes of drone footage.Never asked if the needed a special permit but can't see why they would of needed one I have friends with drones and they can use them most places in the wide open spaces.
6619020,v-bay gord,2021-12-21 12:36:00,3168,"I'm pretty sure every married man has a drone at home, and no license to operate it. (sorry, couldn't resist)"
6619022,Bigtaproot,2021-12-21 12:38:00,900,Probably no less moral that having a beer in the boat which is probably illegal but sure in enjoyable.
6619096,Eckohlt,2021-12-21 18:02:00,3685,"Root just don't be driving that boat,or big momma might swat you."

6618328,Clairebear,2021-12-18 13:44:00,937,Fancy boats are like breast implants: You don't need them but they sure are nice to look at.
6618330,v-bay gord,2021-12-18 14:04:00,3168,I can't recall ever being p*ssed off at the improper operation of a breast implant....
6618422,pjshorthorn,2021-12-19 05:16:00,5654,Would operating a breast implant be something like trying to start an older two stroke motor ? PjShorthorn
6618442,v-bay gord,2021-12-19 07:27:00,3168,I guess it might be possible to exceed the no wake rules depending on size and speed.....
6618452,Bakefish,2021-12-19 07:44:00,1077,To exceed the no wake rules you would first need to determine the whorespower and efficiency of the hole shot.
6618658,Obabikon,2021-12-20 06:55:00,2370,"I completely agree. Except many local Ontario people act like they own them also. I was hiking back to a lost lake when I was 16 years old, and while we were fishing the bank a float plane landed on it. The owner came over and asked us where we were staying and who we were. I have course told them. He then screamed at me and told me that this was his private lake and he was the only one to allow access to it. I was young and apologized and left. Then the OPP called us to tell us that he had tried to file a complaint… I asked what that meant and they said we would hear back. Then the MNR called us and informed us that he does not on the lake. He has the rights to the boat cache and that is all. He was local, he owned a fly in business and had sold “private lake“ to guests. I wish I had been as knowledgeable at the time of the confrontation…"
6618700,Fisherman Ted,2021-12-20 09:11:00,461,"That guy gives all of us a bad name. I am not aware of anything being truly private. The lakes are open for all. Perhaps it should be called something like ""a single boat cache exists for this body of water but does not preclude anyone from hiking, flying or even dragging in a boat for the day and fishing"". Although for marketing purposes that's not quite as sexy......."
6618706,Wawajake,2021-12-20 09:20:00,413,"Your sort of right Obabikon , yes it is those "" special ""* permissions that the MNR has given some Cdn and US lodge owners that is contentious with many locals that used to be allowed to find a way into those lakes across crown land....My wife worked for many years for a logging / land Management company that owned numerous complete townships ( a township in Canada can be roughly 6 miles by 6 miles size) so of course many of these townships completely surrounded many a lake. So these private companies owned all the land around these lakes.....BUT did not own the water beds....the lake itself was always retained ownership by the "" crown"" in otherwords the province of Ontario, which is the taxpayer Ontario people. All crown land and lakes was always freely accessible by locals and tourists even ( although some camping time limitations are imposed to limit "" squatting"" on crown land......so as you can see there is reasonable cause for you and I to be concerned when the MNR picks and choses who can use a lake based on financial decisions rather than letting all Ontario people access, whether by plane or walking ,snowmachine or Atv across crown land...as long as fishing regulations are adhered to , to protect the fish stocks . Now I have probably opened a can of worms, for some on this website, but I am just giving a glimpse of the other side of the issue."
6618808,Obabikon,2021-12-20 16:47:00,2370,"For the record... the MNR did call, and basically told me I was free to fish the lake anytime I wanted. A boat cache is not ownership, and the land surrounding the lake was crown land. I have since been back to that lake several times, but never seen another person back there. People can certainly become entitled, especially when money is involved. It doesn't really matter if they're from the US or Canada. The reality is, people don't own lakes... no matter what they think. I don't think the original poster was meaning to say he ""owned"" the lake... as much as he was the one who had easiest access to it. The phrase though, obviously strikes a chord in some of us (including me) who have had entitlement experiences."
6618182,That Minnesota guy,2021-12-17 17:47:00,8293,"You all should be worried...........sports leagues are cancelling games, moving games, have games with no fans. It's looking bleaker by the day."
6618184,Eckohlt,2021-12-17 18:10:00,3685,"It will be a go for opening,don't lose any sleep over what's going on now.it's looking bright for the opener."
6618192,NM_Trout,2021-12-17 19:16:00,1094,"That's why ""owned"" is in quotes folks. The lake is being rented to me by the week as a solo tenant, marketed and sold as such to me by the outfitter. I own the recreational rights to that outpost for a week. 168 contiguous hours of private water, for me and my drone ;-) Beware for anyone other than conservation officers, outfitter, or water bombers needing a hasty dip!"
6618220,Skywagon,2021-12-18 04:06:00,1106,"Out of curiosity, which lake are you referring to and in what area is it located? Thank you"
6618224,RichA$1970,2021-12-18 04:27:00,1159,"I’ve gone with a group with a big city fisherman who brings nothing but gadgets, more crap than just a couple of poles and a small tackle box. He spends more time playing with his drone than fishing along with always being way over weight limits. I laughed when people think they “own” a lake for a week just because they are the only ones there. I feel for some of the outfitters on what they have to deal with at times."
6618238,Cgillespie,2021-12-18 05:53:00,120,Let's hope this is long gone by then. I leave for NW Ontario in 177 days. I hope that's enough time for this to blow through.
6618242,prov1800,2021-12-18 06:33:00,5010,Iam all for that.
6618250,NM_Trout,2021-12-18 07:56:00,1094,"It is a good thing to be simple and easily amused! Are you likewise amused by folks who think they own a car when paying for it, or own a house that has a mortgage on it too?Oh yeah... that lake and its fish are mine... all mine. <insert maniacal laugh here>"
6618292,prov1800,2021-12-18 10:53:00,5010,Ģoing to be a go for my wife and i this afternoon over at Clarks ice shack.First outing for the year and hope for many more.
6618316,RichA$1970,2021-12-18 11:52:00,1159,"No, I just really get amused of the big city fisherman with the 50 lb tackle boxes, 210+ lbs of gear like they are getting deployed and the ones who sport the “Master Angler” patches to show everyone they are real outdoorsman."
6618102,NM_Trout,2021-12-17 12:37:00,1094,"I'd like to bring my drone with me to Canada to the outpost I visit, and take video. Unfortunately, Canada has enacted some pretty draconian laws associated with drone operation. Seriously draconian. (for anything above 250g MTOW)Especially if you are a Canadian. You have to license to either a Basic or Advanced operator, and in some instances that requires effectively a small private pilot's knowledge to pass the test.For foreign operators, you have to get a SFOC (Special Flight Operation Certificate) in place before operation.As of 5/26/2020, Canada was not processing SFOCs for recreational operators. I can't tell if they have turned that back on yet or not. Anybody know?"
6618108,Wawajake,2021-12-17 12:58:00,413,"Will a fishing rod with 14 lb Fireline and a medium size spoon pull one of those drones out of the sky ? .....I hope so , hate to have to bring the shotgun with me when fishing."
6618118,NM_Trout,2021-12-17 14:19:00,1094,"Yes, I just heard from the Canadian Transport folks, and they are back to processing recreational drone operation SFOCs!Woot!"

6618130,NM_Trout,2021-12-17 14:42:00,1094,"Well, given that we outpost on a lake in which we are the sole ""owners"" for the lake for the week, I suggest that any other fisherman on my water use only a baitcasting rod instead of a spinning rod. It would make the extraction from your colon much less painful ;-)"
6618148,Wawajake,2021-12-17 16:04:00,413,"No one "" owns"" the lakes and many a local Ontario fisherman disagrees with MNR on those policy decisions , .....but I digress. Enjoy your time on our lakes."
6618152,Walleye2242,2021-12-17 16:17:00,263,Thinking the same. I would never think I owned a lake because i did a week long fly in at an outpost.
6618166,Clairebear,2021-12-17 16:49:00,937,"I am a basic Canadian drone pilot and in 2018 when we travelled to Alaska for 3 months I sent an email to the FAA requesting permission to travel and fly my drone in US airspace. At the time there where no real quide lines for Canadians flying in the US. They did send me an email saying that they had reviewed my CA licence and would accept it as the guidelines where very similar to theirs. Never another question asked. Printed copies of there emails to carry just in case. Some amazing water falls and emerald green lakes and mountains to be videoed in Alaska, NWT and the Yukon. I fly a DJI Mavic 2 Zoom if anyone is wondering."
6618170,v-bay gord,2021-12-17 17:04:00,3168,"That's an action packed quote that deserves its own thread, but I digress..."
6618178,Wawajake,2021-12-17 17:27:00,413,"With the Ontario Tourism/ fishing industry in a sensitive rebuilding situation, now is not the time to debate that issue. Lets get a good year in 2022. It's worrisome times this month after announcements today."
