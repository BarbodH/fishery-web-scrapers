6616710,Yellowfin123,2021-12-11 11:14:00,2182,"""tornado ally"" has changed from 15-20 years ago, it used to start out in oklahoma and run northeast about 300 miles, now its shifted southeast, your more in the thick of it now.. notice all the tornados in alabama, miss, arkansas last few years? kansas and oklahoma been fairly quiet"
6616732,Cgillespie,2021-12-11 12:50:00,120,"The storm went about 30 miles east of us. I stood out on my back deck and watched the lightning as it moved past, it was very intense. My mom's house in Jonesboro AR got hit by a tornado in March 2020. Luckily this one missed her by 10 miles. It was fast moving, didn't take long to get from Central Arkansas to Western Kentucky."
6616774,Timmer92,2021-12-11 15:40:00,451,I'm jealous! My kid's ski racing season started today. Another year where I likely won't touch the ice.
6616790,Limeyangler,2021-12-11 17:07:00,563,Kudos to you for putting your kid first

6616456,Cgillespie,2021-12-10 08:34:00,120,"Nice slabs. If I could ice fish all winter, I think I could handle living up there."
6616552,Bill Krejca,2021-12-10 16:17:00,6107,"All right, nice fish! Love it! Bill"
6616602,Limeyangler,2021-12-10 19:55:00,563,"Lol I often wonder how people who don't Ice fish avoid insanity living up here, I've come to the conclusion that they don't!"
6616604,Limeyangler,2021-12-10 19:56:00,563,"Crappie are so much fun, and taste so good."
6616614,7 Mag,2021-12-11 04:30:00,1887,They're a lot of fun to catch and they taste the best when caught in cold water. Thanks for the pics.
6616638,Cgillespie,2021-12-11 07:37:00,120,If I couldn't fish I'd probably take up heavy drinking. One of the advantages of living down here is year-round fishing. Of course the brutally hot and humid summers suck.
6616642,Limeyangler,2021-12-11 07:54:00,563,"Well I have to admit that the winters are harder on me than when I moved here 15 years ago, the very fact that it is a balmy -11C with little wind but i'm sat here typing on a fishing forum when there is nothing stopping me from going fishing is proof of that....lol. I am going for a sled ride so my buddy can show off his new sled to me in a couple of hours, but i'm definitely less 'gung-ho' in cold weather than I used to be."
6616644,Limeyangler,2021-12-11 07:56:00,563,you're most welcome.
6616654,Cgillespie,2021-12-11 08:47:00,120,I'd rather deal with a blizzard than dodge tornadoes like we did last night!
