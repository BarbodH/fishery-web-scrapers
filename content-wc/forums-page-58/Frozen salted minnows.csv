6610424,ukats18,2021-11-16 08:45:00,4,Any stores in Ontario have these for sale? Been going fishing in Manitoba and Saskatchewan for years but was going to bring wife and kids up to Ontario this summer. In Manitoba and Saskatchewan they are everywhere (live minnows prohibited) but I see a lot of doing it yourself subjects here for frozen salted minnows but nowhere to buy them in Ontario.Is it possible?Thx!Dave

One of our trips scheduled for late May next year is to an outpost where live minnows are not allowed. Long story short, they can put together a large quantity of frozen minnows to accommodate most frozen minnow needs. As John stated earlier, many bait shops across Ontario will carry what you need. Where in Ontario are you planning to fish?"

6614190,Riding high,2021-11-30 06:40:00,69,I've tried frozen minnows from bait shops up north. Havnt found any that worked very good after they thaw. Don't stay on the hook very well. Last couple years I got them from best baits from Ohio. If you can figure out how they make them and make them yourself when you're up there or maybe someone will make them for you before you get there. This year we used mostly artificial minnows and worms. Worked as good as the live ones we had.

Around here, some of the bait dealers collect the ones which die in the bait tank and then freeze them, which already get a head start toward the mushy process. Even adding salt usually doesn't help to prevent the softness. Bill"
6614314,prov1800,2021-11-30 16:20:00,5010,If seen them fill the containers at Clarks Baits with live minnows so those are not dead and mushy yet.Iam a lucky guy that can go and help myself there.As can there guests.In my book live bait is the only way to go.If your coming up to Canada and want to catch a bunch of walleyes I don't understand why you would want to use frozen minnows you still have to pay for.Can you catch fish on frozen minnows Yes.Will you have a better chance with a live minnow.Absolutely.No brainer.
