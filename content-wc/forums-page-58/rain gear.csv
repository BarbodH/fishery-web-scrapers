6613336,prov1800,2021-11-25 19:29:00,5010,I honestly don't wash my rain gear.I guide most days and dont have time for that.Use it when it rains let it dry depending on weather and stick it in my dry bag till next time.End of the season I do a smell check and might wipe it down with soapy water.That's it. Do I wash my truck.NO.I live in country and go down gravel roads daily it woukd just get dirty again next day and yes rain does pretty good job keeping it clean and my truck is white and they look cleaner than most other colors.sometimes if iam at a beach with my boat I'll give it a once iver otherwise no I don't wash it much.It's white also and looks pretty clean all the time.rather be hunting or fishing than cleaning.

6613546,prov1800,2021-11-27 06:49:00,5010,I have my moments
6613634,prov1800,2021-11-27 14:14:00,5010,So with all this rain gear talk I finally opened my dry bag with my rain gear in it that's been in my basement a while now.Was a pleasant surprise that no foul odor cane out of the bag.Whew.Worst thing I find I do is when i grab a minnow is roll it around on my left thigh to line it up for putting on the hook. wether I have rain gear on or not it's something I do with every free minnow I use.Its a small area I seem to use consistently and there is really no bad odor as i did get my nose right in on it.So just going to hang suit up on a hanger till spring.Heres my Frogg Toggs my wife bought and the largest smallmouth I've ever caught.
6613636,7 Mag,2021-11-27 14:18:00,1887,Thatâ€™s a nice smallmouth John!
6613638,prov1800,2021-11-27 14:35:00,5010,"Thx Mag.it was caught on Eagle on a muskie day.It hit a bucktail and felt like a muskie strike and fought like a muskie lol.23 1/2"" never measured girth wish we had cause it was girthy."
6613686,Eckohlt,2021-11-27 18:30:00,3685,Without those free minnows you probably would not have caught that pig smallie.
6613690,prov1800,2021-11-27 18:35:00,5010,No minnows that day Rod.Strictly bigger muskie baits.That pig hit a shumway flasher #8 blades.

6612016,Eckohlt,2021-11-21 07:09:00,3685,"Nothing that big john,but if you go on a major diet I can maybe help you out lol."
6612120,Wallychowder,2021-11-21 13:38:00,1567,"That sounds all well and good, but i dont think I'd want to carry an oxygen tank with me out in the boat because I have a zip lock baggie on my head &#x1f923;"
6612196,Eckohlt,2021-11-21 16:00:00,3685,Also nice to have that blue tarp incase you get a hole in your outpost roof.
6612200,prov1800,2021-11-21 16:13:00,5010,That's about the dummest thing ice heard
6612236,RichA$1970,2021-11-21 17:51:00,1159,I just put some baking powder in the sink and hand wash with cold water and then air dry.
6612502,drlee,2021-11-22 17:51:00,409,"I throw my rain gear in my washing machine with Tide and run the ""gentle"" cycle. My 20 year old rain gear is just fine. You are welcome!"

6612714,NM_Trout,2021-11-23 10:40:00,1094,"It's goretex, so I wash it the same way I care for my Simms waders.1) Rinse off exterior to get rid of any larger soil.2) Using a mild powder laundry detergent (and only a little of it) I had wash in a bathtub. 3) Turn inside out and repeat wash.4) Rinse well.5) Let dry. On the inside, I spray with isopropal (sp?) alcohol and look for pinholes, and repair with Aquaseal. Let dry, turn rightside out. 6) Spray outside fabric with Durable Water Repellent.Nikwax or Revivex.I have a goretex jacket that is about 25 years old and going strong."
6613332,AsianAngler,2021-11-25 18:59:00,67,"Good Grief! While I don't over wash our rain gear, it is very important for keeping you dry and comfortable in wet conditions... why wouldn't you care for it? I also use Nikwax according to the gear care tags. Our gear has held up well and doesn't stink. I suppose you non-washers think the rain will wash your car and boat as well?"
6611740,Walleye2242,2021-11-20 08:21:00,263,"How do you all ""wash"" your rain jackets/coats? Any tips? Thanks."
6611744,Eckohlt,2021-11-20 08:31:00,3685,"I like to keep mine smelling fishy,the rain will wash it."
6611754,7 Mag,2021-11-20 09:14:00,1887,X2 I do the same
6611824,prov1800,2021-11-20 12:31:00,5010,WASH.lol.thats funny.
6611866,That Minnesota guy,2021-11-20 15:35:00,8293,"Speaking of rain gear. Does anybody have the Aftco brand? Satisfied? Looks like it will set me back $500 plus, so I just gotta decide if I want rain gear or a steak dinner."
6611868,prov1800,2021-11-20 15:42:00,5010,Rain gear can set you back.I always had cabelas guide gear.Great stuff but my parka blew out of my boat and didn't know.350+ for a new one.Ended up buying a complete parka and bibs from frog toggs.3 years now and totally satified. 300 for both.
6611870,7 Mag,2021-11-20 15:48:00,1887,"I have a frog toggs poncho, it is well made and I have North Face rain gear, very happy with it as well."
6611956,tandm,2021-11-20 21:03:00,679,"If you still insist on washing rain gear, find the ""CARE"" label, which should be sewn inside the rain gear.The label on my raingear says cold water, mild detergent, no bleach. Basically, a 5 minute run in an unexpected downpour does the same thing. Mine gets ""washed"" several times each season. My concern is getting it completely dry before stowing it, long term."
6611958,dschiebel,2021-11-20 21:05:00,85,"I bought a blue tarp from Walmart for 6.99 American. Cut a hole for my head, and cover my head with 2 gallon zip lock bags 14 for 2.49 American. Been 7 years and worked great. I may look ridicules. but staying dry. Spent the rest of the money on a fly in to Great Slave Lodge."
6611992,Eckohlt,2021-11-21 05:06:00,3685,"I have more rain gear than scheels,all bought from good will with tags still on the items,bought for little or nothing."
