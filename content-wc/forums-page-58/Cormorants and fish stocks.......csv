6613218,NM_Trout,2021-11-25 08:41:00,1094,"If you boil down the writing from the author, his paper argues that cormorants are not the problem. All the pollution and global warming from people causes the issues. Read between the lines, and it says that if you want to make the fishing better for the humans, you have to get rid of the humans."
6613226,prov1800,2021-11-25 08:55:00,5010,Your absolutly right but humans aren't going anywhere yet so rules and regulations will have to be a big part for where we are headed.Living in NWO and fish summer and winter as far as fishing goes i would have to say its fantastic and getting better all the time.
6613248,Laketripper,2021-11-25 09:44:00,103,"No doubt..""birds of a feather do flock together"" in the fall. The hundreds of cormorants appeared early summer and the pelicans even sooner. Now the cormorants I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they were displaced by forest fires...the pelicans settled in late spring."

6614388,kzoofisher,2021-12-01 03:28:00,5144,"That is full of ""may"" and ""can"", hard to take it seriously. It also says the issues with cormorants wouldn't exist if humans hadn't changed the ecosystem. Destroys its credibility. Historical records are light on mentions of cormorants making it hard to know if they're returning to areas they used to inhabit or expanding their range. I'll wait to see what the biologists have to say in a year or two about fish numbers before I start pointing fingers, we're in the middle of a natural experiment."
6614478,Laketripper,2021-12-01 10:30:00,103,"I have been fortunate enough to spend the last several years experiencing the ""ice-out to ice-in""seasons on the waters of NWO. It is quite fascinating to observe the full cycles of the wild life through the seasons. I saw cormorants and pelicans like never before....right now I am going to attribute that to the simple reason of very little boat/human activity on the lakes and they are moving into fresh feeding grounds with great fishing and no competition to disrupt them.Also having the high forest fire activities would also be a factor. Worse case scenario they had to move into better hunting grounds because they depleted their food source elsewhere.Best case scenario is that once boat/human activity get back to ""normal"" around the waterways the birds will disperse again.Very simple thoughts,I know , but by the time the fish counters come up with a theory on all this there will probably be an answer. I am looking forward to the next few seasons to see how this all plays out."
6614510,NM_Trout,2021-12-01 13:45:00,1094,Yup. Gander and Goose arguments. Throw it all out. Shoot the Cormorants and lets see what happens :-)
6614552,troutwater,2021-12-01 17:02:00,299,"I've always found this topic interesting. Recently I listened to a recording of an Iowa fisheries biologist talk about stocking 100 muskies that ranged from 12-18."" Out of the 100 only 1 survived after the transmitters died 40 days in or something like that. A big culprit was bird predation. At one point a pelican barfed up 5 muskies before it was able to fly away when they were following the transmitters. It was a good listen if anyone is interested."
6612984,Laketripper,2021-11-24 09:03:00,103,"Thanks V-Bay Gord for the insight read on Cormorants.The author compares the Cormorant as being no more a threat to the fisheries as a Loon or Otter. I agree with that,but I've never seen more than a few Loons or Otters fishing together at one time. My encounter with the Cormorants was in the hundreds,floating across a bay,most likely over top of a school of baitfish.I've never experienced a group of Cormorants like that. The author also states that there could be localized issues where predation could be at a level that will conflict with fisheries management...I'm assuming he is refering to hundreds of Cormorants floating along a bay. It's quite possible, because of the numerous forest fires occuring in NWO this season the Cormorants were simply displaced. I'm hoping the Cormorants were a one time experience. The Pelicans are going to be more of a threat..seems to be more and more of them hanging around...capable of consuming 4 to 5 lbs. of fish a day each."
6612990,prov1800,2021-11-24 09:21:00,5010,Not every lake has the huge cormorant populations.As I said earlier on Eagle Lake the west arm has onlý a few where the east end has hundreds.I fish many lakes here and some lakes have almost none.Cliff Lake for instance has very few. Could it be trout lakes are to deep for them.Clay Lake has huge numbers also were Cedar Lake is moderate as is Lac Suel.But on those lakes the pelican numbers are up.Instead of culling mnr should just go a spray the eggs so they dont hatch.Create some jobs.eventually numbers would dwindle.
6613006,Yellowfin123,2021-11-24 10:35:00,2182,"east side of eagle is more shallow isn't it, like osborne bay.. what was going 200 years ago with the birds vs fish? its the humans, not sure why people freak out over eating a walleye like its the hope diamond or somethin, just stop at mcdonalds a get get a filet o fish sandwich its the same thing, throw the fish back!!"
6613086,v-bay gord,2021-11-24 15:43:00,3168,"Cormorants and pelicans can also eat crayfish....of which Eagle Lake has had the rusty crayfish issue. If so I'm happy to have them....in moderation of course. An overabundance of any species is probably not a good thing. Every fall it's common to see bunches of loons feeding in groups over deep water.....I've seen groups of 50-100, most often with gulls overhead. Same with mergansers.....you'll often see 20-30 chasing bait fish along shorelines in late summer, early fall. I regularly have 8-12 bald eagles congregated near me in the fall......they probably eat fish too. I know 3 fat guys in a Ranger boat are capable of consuming 4 or 5 lbs. of fish a day....plus beer. Anyways, glad that a few people read the article, and perhaps it generated some thought. I will point out that P.J. probably didn't read the article I suggested for him, otherwise he would have had a comment."

6613154,fishron,2021-11-25 05:22:00,317,"My favorite southern Ontario lake had no Cormorants back in the day, forty some years ago. Loons, mergansers, grebes and osprey were all part of the normal outdoor scene. About twenty years ago cormorants were becoming part of the wild community. This caused some locals to shoot them when ever they could, not wanting to see a great reduction in the fish population. Indeed, the fishing was in decline and the cormorants were very efficient fish eaters. At the same time, eurasian milfoil invaded the lake and took over many shoals and areas previously inhabited by native water weeds. The lake community recognized the threat and tried various methods of control. Weevils, shoreline aerators, did not stop the invader. Choked off spawning areas and late season slime covered milfoil became common. To me the milfoil was the true culprit. The thickness of a milfoil bed makes fishing it impossible. That's not to say the predator fish don't hide and hunt there constantly. Now on our annual fall fishing trip to the lake we are limited to smaller areas to fish. In one bay, off a small island the cormorants have established a yearly roost. In the evening, dozens of them fly in and roost in the trees and strike up an almost human sounding chatter. Interesting how a loon will swim close to my boat but a cormorant flies off, say when I get within shotgun range....... they're not stupid."
6613158,prov1800,2021-11-25 05:39:00,5010,Your just a popular guy
6613164,prov1800,2021-11-25 06:11:00,5010,Definatly shallower in some areas by east end.Lots of small islands and rocks sticking up there.on wet and windy days there are tons of cormorants all crowded together sitting on them.I mean lots.Never saw that 30 years ago and did not see pelicans either.Iam not in a panic over it just saying.Not sure how much a cormorants eat in a day or what size fish they are after but they are good at fishing.In Asian countries they use cormorants to bring fish up.Some of the rocks they sit on could have 50-100 of them in one spot and there are a lot of those spots.Not a normal thing in my book.Us humans dont like competition like got to kill all the wolves because they eat deer.As of right now I don't think the cormorants or pelicans are doing much damage according to catch rates on Eagle.
6613182,Bill Krejca,2021-11-25 06:49:00,6107,"After reading the professional ""reports"", it occurs to me that there are so many variations from different bodies of water, and so many influencing factors of which we humans continue to be unaware, that the truths seems to be confined to different areas, albeit conflicting. As I stated here some time ago, I have heard of steps taken by individuals in reducing the cormorant population by night time raiding of the young by drowning. The one Manitoba island in particular was devoid of all vegetation, and the raid involved eliminating thousands of the young birds. The lake's walleye population reportedly recovered after this raid. As to pelicans, I do not remember seeing these birds on LOW from the 1940's up to about the 1970's or so, when many started stopping by. They have a way on the water of circling and herding fish into the middle, and seemed quite good at it, from my binocular view point. Apparently good enough that a petition was sent round, at least in the Morson area, some time ago, to advocate shooting them. I never heard much about it after that. So many factors influence the varying acts of nature. Bill"
6612790,v-bay gord,2021-11-23 17:11:00,3168,"I had referenced this article in another thread (now deleted...?) because someone mentioned a concern in the number of cormorants observed on some NW Ontario lakes in the past year or so. As I know all WC members take pride on being on the cutting edge of fisheries science I think this is a good article to arm yourself with when dealing with your boorish relatives this Thanksgiving (US) weekend.From my observations, I've seen less of these birds the past two years.

When he said that the fisheries issue was being more threatened by humans as ""we are responsible for climate change"".... he lost a significant amount of credibility. His writing is full of ""may"" and ""can"" and he is critical of the MNRF because they are acting on data which is not apparent to him. All the while postulating his position based on data he is not providing to us.Nah... this was similar to a politician switching parties, and the receiving party using this as AH-HA! See? We were right! I got a chuckle out of the Avian Conservation group posting that his writing had a conflict of interest, even though his position benefited them. Odd that a ""science based"" organization would not understand what conflict of interest is."
