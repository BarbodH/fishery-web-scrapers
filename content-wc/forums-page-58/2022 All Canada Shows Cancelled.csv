6614638,Cgillespie,2021-12-02 07:56:00,120,"My dad was a marketing guy and worked hundreds and hundreds of trade shows in his career. He worked a lot of shows at McCormick Place in Chicago, where he was responsible for all aspects of the setting up and tearing down of the displays for his company. It was unbelievable how expensive it was for simple tasks, such as plugging in an extension cord, to be completed thanks to union rules. Factors like that are one of many reasons that the trade show industry in probably in a terminal decline. One thing to add, with the Teamsters running the labor at McCormick Place, you never had to worry about stuff getting stolen while being crated and taken to the loading dock. The same cannot be said about New Orleans and some other convention centers."
6614654,7 Mag,2021-12-02 10:34:00,1887,"I've seen this first hand, i spend quite a bit of time at the Chicago IMTS show. Lots of money paid out for the floor space, rigging as well as the electrical installs."
6614670,troutwater,2021-12-02 13:46:00,299,"I'm disapppinted but totally understand it. My girlfriend and I were planning on going to book a place for our trip, so maybe now we will at the NW Sport Show. I for one love the shows, and as others have echoed there is a tremendous benefit to meeting face to face with the lodge operators. T"
6614672,Cgillespie,2021-12-02 13:49:00,120,That's a huge show. PROMAT was the big one for my dad.
6614682,RichA$1970,2021-12-02 14:12:00,1159,"One thing that irks me is when you spend time talking to an outfitter and then find out it’s some guy out of Chicago who says I’ve fished there forever and all the glorious BS. I understand it’s good to have someone help out if the owner has to run an errand or take a break, but some of these hired hands are professional BS’ers so I ask now if they own the camp and will be up there all season. Not to bash a friend or loyal customer who helps them set up or let’s them crash at their place, but there some I wonder about."
6614698,Eckohlt,2021-12-02 15:42:00,3685,"Even some owners will try n set the hook on you,not only the help,some have that car selling pitch lol"
6614718,v-bay gord,2021-12-02 17:10:00,3168,"If he weighs more than 250 pounds, he's probably not a lodge owner (or at least one that does any work)....."
6614736,Eckohlt,2021-12-02 18:16:00,3685,His jaw is getting a work out.
6615022,walleyecheek,2021-12-04 08:54:00,2231,So are you saying Lodge Owners are skinny little things ?
6615042,Obabikon,2021-12-04 09:47:00,2370,"When I read that, I chuckled... thinking of some of the ""larger"" lodge owners out there, that I know still work very hard."
6614300,Obabikon,2021-11-30 14:54:00,2370,"This isn't going to be the end of these shows. All Canada will be back next year (assuming everything keeps trending positively). Basically, many resorts have opted not to go to the shows this year, because most have a large number of guests already on the books (from 2 years of back log). There is not a lot of incentive to do shows this year, and there is a lot of incentive for resorts to save money. SO... they simply had too many resorts back out to justify the show. It'll be back and busy in 2023."
6614304,NARDA 1,2021-11-30 15:25:00,636,"Obabikon, this is what I've heard from a couple of lodges. I will miss working the Chicago show in The Birch Dale Booth this year and expect the show to return next year."
6614310,That Minnesota guy,2021-11-30 15:43:00,8293,I'm not so sure. It's a pile of dough they spend for these shows as you know. It's a year after year expense for some. I think I would rather spend $5k for a web site build with drone footage that would last several years instead of this steady parade to the shows. Have you found out much they raised the price of the booth space at the Northwest Sports Show in Mpls this year? That will be a pretty good barometer of how much more these shows will cost.
6614324,Obabikon,2021-11-30 18:17:00,2370,"Everything is going up in costs. Most lodge owners were kept in the loop with the evolvement in canceling the 2022 all canada show. I'm 100% confident that they intend to be back next year, and many resorts plan on exhibiting in 2023 (that had told them they would be passing on 2022)."
6614326,Obabikon,2021-11-30 18:19:00,2370,"As far as the Minneapolis show goes... we paid for the 2020 show that we were not allowed to do. That was rolled over to 2021 and eventually 2022. I don't know what the cost change will be eventually, but everyone is simply trying to get by."
6614336,chunger21,2021-11-30 19:20:00,11,This sucks! We love going to the show every year and consider it our winter trip to Canada. Two years in a row of missing out on it really hurts.
6614398,pjshorthorn,2021-12-01 05:47:00,5654,"Unfortunately, for your business and the outfitter's business, there will be customers lost due to their desire to not be vaccinated. I guess one could look at the business attrition as a detriment or an opportunity for future business growth. I would like to think that new customers will bolster both business segments for the long term; in repeat business since there will be some openings now vs. being difficult to get into the pecking order for popular lodges and guide services in the past. PjShorthorn"
6614470,prov1800,2021-12-01 10:13:00,5010,Hope everything keeps going smoothly PJ.
6614548,pete kraft,2021-12-01 16:58:00,28,10K for 1 show or all 3 shows? I have always attended the Chicago show. Never paid attention or looked to see if the vendor list was the same at all of the shows.
6614578,Obabikon,2021-12-01 20:55:00,2370,"The average booth costs between $1000-$2000 for one booth (many resorts have double booths... 2nd one usually comes at a bit of a discount). It varies for electricity and things you rent. Then add $200 per day for food and lodging. Gas and other things like pamphlets and other advertising you give away. Typically an owner pays another person to be there. We do single booths... but I estimate the 3 shows we do cost around $9000-$10,000 (total). That is assuming my time traveling away from my family is worth $0. I'm not complaining... I'm just sharing information."

6614176,Cgillespie,2021-11-30 05:12:00,120,I wouldn't think there would be a decent ROI for lodges and outfitters to enter these shows at this time. The trade show industry was in decline before Covid and I'm sure that decline has been accelerated. It's pretty easy to find out about lodges and outfitters in the internet and social media.
6614184,That Minnesota guy,2021-11-30 06:11:00,8293,May it rest in peace.
6614200,Bill Krejca,2021-11-30 07:34:00,6107,"Too bad, used to be a fun time to revisit some old and start new, memories, a sort of like being there during the winter. A camp owner a few years ago told me it cost him $10K for a spot, considering all the total expenses. Times change, and it could be another year of COVID uncertainties, so few camp folks willing to gamble for the return on the investment. Bill"
6614206,RichA$1970,2021-11-30 08:01:00,1159,"Time to do it virtual which I know is not the same but if I owned a lodge I would make sure I have a sharp website with tons of pictures of the camp, boats and amenities vs just someone holding a nice fish. Plus a couple of videos of the camp and lake showing what they offer. A good website nowadays means a lot and like someone mentioned, $10,000 to cover the shows vs maybe $1,000 for a good website saves a lot to the P&L."
6614246,prov1800,2021-11-30 10:46:00,5010,Most camps have the roll overs coming this year.So why go blow a bunch of money that most dont have when they should be pretty busy.Make some money and do the shows next year.Hopefully there guests will be vaccinated and have no problems getting into Canada.I personally know a few guests of mine that will not get the shots and will not be coming.
6614266,Hillbiehle,2021-11-30 12:48:00,66,"We used to attend these in the 90's and I attended one about 10+ years ago (which was much smaller than previous years). Since then, I've been a bit skeptic wondering if the fishing and pricing was good enough, why would they have to advertise via sport shows when so many outfitters have repeat business from existing customers. Probably not an accurate reflection but I have been suspicious of the companies that attended multiple shows throughout the Midwest. Seems like a lot of unnecessary work and expense, particularly if you have a good customer base."
6614278,NM_Trout,2021-11-30 13:05:00,1094,"Well, keep in mind that the customer base has a tendency to die off, AND be a little guarded about their favorite outposts :-) Plus the social aspect of the show is a lot of fun. Getting to visit with multiple vendors and get questions answered in real time is great. So is being able to get a gut feel for what the vendor's customer service side might look like.* *(Caveat : the above is submitted by a curmudgeonly old guy who prefers paper when reading / writing and thinks that texting is evil)"
