6616708,gordy28,2021-12-11 11:14:00,437,Love the responses I also had my Dad and my Grandpa start me on the walk around the store piece. In Canada it was either Canadian Tire or a store called LeBarons. The biggest treat was when we could pick out a Rapala or a Mepps Love fish online and use it a ton for issue number 1 And I also get made fun of by my wife for the amount of time we spend talking about our trips and âplanningâ Andrew

6616714,bthomas3333,2021-12-11 11:29:00,465,Tripus Interruptus! - Another problem which is especially acute right now is booking trips a year or two in advance and finding yourself during COVID with 6 deposits out for 2022 and to make it worse the trip you really want to take isn't even one of the 6. Lure Multiplus - Another 'problem' is when you kill the fish on a particular lure and lose it during the trip. Then you decide the answer is to buy 3-4 of those for next year and want to 'try' 5 other colors in the same family. One lost lure becomes a purchase of 20 lures! Yeah...I have all of the ones mentioned in the article too! Here's hoping we can travel in summer 2022 so we can clear some of these trips and push a few to 2023. B-
6616950,Pooch,2021-12-12 11:04:00,4618,"It seems to be a seasonal disorder based on long dark cold days accompanied by an over whelming desire to make new ""stuff"" based on previous fishing experiences still fresh or even stale in memory. Like the rest of you afflicted, I'm not searching for a cure. My wife may be, but I'm not. Once winter locks me into either pushing snow or making ""stuff""... ""stuff"" usually wins. I have too much ""stuff"", I make too much ""stuff"" and I seldom get rid of my ""stuff"". I make ""stuff"", gift ""stuff"", remake ""stuff"", repaint ""stuff"", etc.. Accompanying this affliction is the innate urge to pour lead ""stuff"", which then requires painting that same ""stuff"". Then finding a place for storing that ""stuff"". That leads to buying more storage ""stuff"". Crank baits? Large tubs of that ""stuff"" that will never get wet and occasionally the same new ""stuff"" follows me home. Someday there is gonna be a lot of ""stuff"" on garage sales when all of us are fishing the big pond just barely over the horizon for many of us ""stuff"" collectors. Pooch"
6617008,HeHooksHimself,2021-12-12 14:56:00,725,"I certainly can relate to some of the afflictions mentioned. One sure sign of both aging and becoming predictable is that for every gifting occasion I seem to get mostly fishing shirts and Cableas/Bass Pro gift cards, which contributes greatly to the accumulation of odd, seldom used and gawdy fishing lures and gimmicks. And Christmas is only two weeks away! Fish On! Hooks"
6618240,prov1800,2021-12-18 06:22:00,5010,With deer hunting over now and putting all that gear away its time to look for my ice fishing gear.Some of the lures I use in the winter iam sure I left in my boat which is all tarped up and covered in snow.Not going to untie and go looking in there.Wife had a hair appt on Dryden yesterday so i had a hour and a half to kill in town.No Cabelas here so went over to the next best place.Clarks bait and tackle and did a little shopping.Found a great selection of vibratos and grabbed a couple of bondy wabblers.Will be ice fishing shortly as Clarks have there shacks on the ice at KCs Landing on Edward Lake.Anyone looking for some great ice fishing and accomadations this is the place you want to try out.Easy fishing.Cabins are 100 yds from ice shacks.Ill be headed over there in the next few days for some fresh walleye.First ice fishing is always good.For any of you guys that need a bit more of a adventure and like to ride your sleds there is the awesome 40 mi ride into Anishinabi Lake Lodge which the boys had to open up with all trees down down after our snow storm.Looking forward to the next few months.

6616564,gordy28,2021-12-10 17:18:00,437,Wandering the isle of a local fishing store for the 3 time in as many weeks looking for something I really didn't need it dawned on me that I may have a problem Newest post is up. My effort at some satire during this painful shoulder season lol https://www.northernjacks.com/post/top-5-signs-you-may-have-a-fishing-problem Cheers Andrew
6616568,Eckohlt,2021-12-10 17:27:00,3685,"It could be you have to much money,and your looking for a place to unload it.cheers back atcha"
6616572,gordy28,2021-12-10 17:41:00,437,Could be true although most trips to the tackle store I rationalize myself out of more purchases than I make
6616594,Yellowfin123,2021-12-10 19:28:00,2182,"i guess i'm guilty of #1,2 and a little bit of 3 walking into the garage for no apparent reason and stare at the boat for 15 minutes, then go back in the house, yea thats a little weird.. looking at WC and the wife walks by and gives ya the ""eye roll"" then says, are you reading about dead worms?? yes thats a sure sign of some problems"
6616628,Eckohlt,2021-12-11 06:47:00,3685,"Tell the wife it could be worse,you could be sitting in a bar talking about dead worms."
6616640,Walleye2242,2021-12-11 07:38:00,263,"driving to fleet farm and cabelas just to walk around and look knowing I am not going to buy anything yet. When i was a kid my dad and i had seperate gear for canada. we had tackle for river fishing and fishing around home and then our canada fishing tackle. the canada tackle only went to canada. We kept in up in out attic but duiring the winter times....every once in awhile...my dad would call down...hey..i getting the canada tackle down...i got so excited. we would sit in the living room with our tackle boxes and clean our reels...go through lures and teal about what we caught on different lures. The old Thin Fins....red, green, yellow....haha. What great times."
6616648,Bill Krejca,2021-12-11 08:11:00,6107,"Yup, Dad started the same tradition, which I have continued - gear for Ioway and nicer stuff for Canada. Even when Dad got too old(93) to go up, he still would sit down and go over his Canadian gear, I still have swivels and other stuff, neatly tied together with safety pins, which he assembled. There is a certain memory factor which is exacerbated by just the handling of such associated jewels. Bill"
6616652,Walleye2242,2021-12-11 08:31:00,263,"Still have my dad's and gramp's tackle box's. They sit in the corner of our cabin still. They are still loaded with hand made little joe's and lures. Even a handmade wooden tackle box my gramps made long ago. Old ""steel"" poles from long ago and old reels that weight about 20 pounds each. haha."
6616678,Laketripper,2021-12-11 09:46:00,103,I'm probably offering info that's already known but Ontario MNRF has a viewer called Fish ON - Line that offers good info to help with Warning sign #1.
6616686,bbheli,2021-12-11 10:19:00,1387,"I can sure relate to that, I use to not be able to get out of Bass Pro Shop for under $400.00 but now when I find myself in the I need this should have this mode I review my cart before the check out and as another poster stated I talk my self out of why I thought I needed it. Cust my spending in half. we all know the saying ""the tackle catches the fisherman"""
