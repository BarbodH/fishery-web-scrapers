If the PCR test is still required, we're planning to essentially isolate for 2 weeks prior to leaving on 6/14. Our doctor said the turnaround on the PCR is 24 hours, so we'll try to get tested about 66 hours out to give ourselves plenty of time for flight delays, etc. We've put off this trip too long, so we're not taking any chances."
6613820,Riding high,2021-11-28 12:03:00,69,I hope they don't require a booster shot. I may not be able to go. I had covid in February 2021 didn't have any symptoms but lost taste and smell for 3-4 days. Got vaccinated in May. I again tested positive the end of September. Again I way the lucky one didn't have any symptoms. The big But is I did get sick from the vaccine so I won't take something that makes me that sick to prevent something that didn't make me sick. I was bad 6 hours after the poke for 24 hours.

I am 58 and just started getting the flu shot 4 or 5 years ago. I have never had a reaction to that vaccine, but I know others that have. Same with the covid jab. I had no ill effects (except a darn sore arm) but my partner I go to Canada with had what almost mirrors your experience except I believe it was 12 hours before he had a reaction. Fever, chills didn't want to get off couch at all. Finally went to sleep and woke up and everything was back to normal.....which was 24 hours later for him as well. Sooo, my point of view is I'd rather be sick for 24 hours and recover than what could possibly be the alternative. Just my perspective."
6614662,Jdconins,2021-12-02 12:40:00,62,"Does this mean that you have to have a booster shot with proof and also what is a vaccination passport? One in the same or something above a normal passport. A third year would kill me if I don't get to go to Canada next June fishing, its the only time I get to cut loose and let out some steam without a cell phone or internet. This new variant has me a bit concerned. Thanks fellow Walleye guys Jd"
6614664,Andre (wallyandre),2021-12-02 12:55:00,2274,"Yesterday I went to take a look at my camp in Port Kent NY from Montreal. The day prior crossing I fill-up the informations request in the ArriveCan: giving name, a picture of my passeport, uploading my 2 vaccines proof doc. and when I came back I present my passport and the officer scan it, gave it back to me and say welcome back.FYI I didn't take any chance I also had the docs on paper also; never know when those computers can make errors but I didn't need it.Crossing the US border was also very easy: where are you going? For what? Have a nice day.I cross the border 50 times a year and apart filling-up the ArriveCan a day prior there is no difference.Use ArriveCan, it simplify the entry in Canada:ArriveCan"
6615366,Baseline,2021-12-05 19:21:00,3207,"It sure is a only Guess --- Canada doesn't seem to want to do anything to loosen things up. The US has been pressuring Canada to get rid of the test requirement, but they refused based on the US continued Covid problems. They have always been content to imposing different restrictions on import items and leaving them in place for a couple years or even permanently like the one walleye a day rule on Rainy Lake. I'm headed up Jan 8 for an ice trip for lakers and it looks like entry requirement will be the same as for the trips I took in August, September and October. Best thing anyone wanting to schedule a trip for next summer is to get the pokes and be prepared. Passports are still taking up to 3 months to get so spend the winter getting those and renewing the old ones."
6615396,RichA$1970,2021-12-05 21:11:00,1159,"I kind of think Canada got screwed by the US when they finally reopened the border, the US did not reopen for Canadians in the same manner. The current requirements were no issue for me when I crossed this fall."

6616106,10lbeye,2021-12-08 11:57:00,61,"Just crossed 3 days ago for a 2 night stay. In addition to neg COVID test, I was chosen at random to take a rapid test. They gave me a blue box kit--had 24 hrs to take it. Upon arrival at hotel, I went online and registered and set up a video session with a public health official who watched me swab my nose correctly. Made arrangements for pickup at our hotel. Overall, it was not a bad process. Canada is taking COVID seriously; everyone masked up, proof of vaccination required for restaurants, concerts, etc. No complaining or incidents that I saw. I respect their approach to it--their country, their rules. I would guess that much of this will change come late Spring/early Summer. as COVID (hopefully) wanes."

6612964,Mojo-NC,2021-11-24 07:25:00,1929,"I wouldn't be too sure about the possibility of Canada removing COVID-19 testing requirements for entry as long as the numbers continue on their current trend. If anything, they might even tighten the window a bit more. We fished Canada in September and everything went smoothly regarding border crossing with the 72 hour window requirement for testing. I went on a cruise the week after we returned from Canada and the window for confirmatory testing had just been reduced from 72 to 48 hours. That worked fine too, but my wife and i had to wait until we were already in FL until we got tested. That could have resulted in an unnecessary trip to FL if either my wife or I had turned up with a positive result. Testing is free, can be done using the Walgreens drive-through, and is not too inconvenient. The website is pretty good about identifying the stores that do the testing you need, scheduling appointments, and getting the results back in a reasonable timeframe. However, it could potentially be a major PITA for those who live in the boonies, don't live near a testing site, or aren't proficient using the current technologies (smartphones, tablets, or computers) for scheduling and receiving the results."
6613002,RichA$1970,2021-11-24 10:25:00,1159,"I checked Bloomberg’s global vaccination rate and Canada is over 76% of their population vaccinated with 2 shots and an average vaccination rate of around 50,000. In 6 months they should be >90% so hopefully maybe the test can be lifted. I’m going to Thailand in January for work and they only require your vaccine card and 1 day to chill in the hotel which will be no problem."
6613328,AsianAngler,2021-11-25 18:43:00,67,"We have gone through twice since August. The only real hassle was the random test. Got nailed the first time we went through. Hopefully, the long wait times have improved since August. Otherwise, not that horrible. Hope they get rid of the random testing next year."
6613568,Obabikon,2021-11-27 08:12:00,2370,"With Canada dropping the random tests for ""short trips"" from Canadians, I think it's a real possibility that the 72 hour test is done by next summer. That said, we don't know what is going to happen next week... much less 7 months from now. I do know that there is pressure coming from the tourism side (and probably many other sides) to be more efficient and effective with the way they are approaching things. I do not believe the random tests will be around next year. The purpose of them was to collect data. If they haven't collected enough by then, they never will."
6613606,That Minnesota guy,2021-11-27 11:30:00,8293,"Being a natural skeptic I think there will be continual boosters required, new variants yearly and continued testing. It's a big $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ business."

6613654,Obabikon,2021-11-27 15:44:00,2370,"Sharing this clip.... By Amanda Coletta4:33 p.m. Washington PostTORONTO — Canada said Friday that it is dropping a requirement that all fully vaccinated Canadian travelers who are returning to the country present a negative coronavirus test at the border — if their trip abroad is under 72 hours.Jean-Yves Duclos, Canada’s health minister, said the country is also “reevaluating” the testing requirements for fully vaccinated U.S. citizens entering Canada “and will provide an update on any adjustments at a later date.”The testing measure has been a source of much frustration in the many tightknit communities along the U.S.-Canada border, where crossing several times a week to watch a sporting event, buy cheap gas, enjoy a meal or visit family is common.Politicians, residents and business leaders on both sides of the border have said the hassle of getting a test for a short visit and the cost of the specific tests accepted by Canada, which can be as much as $200, would deter the day-trippers on which their economies depend.The change to the testing requirement goes into effect Nov. 30. It does not apply to Canadians who aren’t fully vaccinated or to those traveling abroad for more than 72 hours.Canadian officials also said that some travelers such as international students and professional athletes, who are currently exempt from entry requirements, will as of Jan. 15 be able to enter the country only if they’re fully vaccinated."
6613662,prov1800,2021-11-27 17:02:00,5010,With the new variant out now iam already getting a bad taste in my mouth.
6612436,Jdconins,2021-11-22 14:09:00,62,"Sorry if this is repetitive but what are the items needed in order to cross into Canada for next year? I am aware of the passport and vaccination card but not sure of the rest. Show negative test 72 hours prior to entering? I sure if things change with the virus those will change as well. thank you,"
6612454,Eckohlt,2021-11-22 15:11:00,3685,Next year is 5 weeks away
6612480,Bill Krejca,2021-11-22 17:12:00,6107,"I don't think anyone has a good feel for how entry will be handled in the foreseeable future. My guess is that not much will change for some time, and possibly the same rules will apply in May. The only change, maybe, being that a few more convenience hours will be added to the small window of 72 hours now required for allowable crossing. Folks not having their shots will continue to not be allowed in, I'm guessing, and probably also the booster shot will be required. COVID cases again seem to be rising, so the powers that be would not seem likely to soften the entry requirements. Bill"
6612516,Eckohlt,2021-11-22 18:24:00,3685,"My guess the 72 hour covid test will be gone,the Canada app gone,,,vaccine with booster n passport go fishing."
6612518,Andre (wallyandre),2021-11-22 18:26:00,2274,Thats what I think to! Except if there is a major raise of cases at that moment
6612552,hoppy63,2021-11-22 19:29:00,367,201 days until I'm fishing in Canada. Booster scheduled for Tuesday the 30th. I still see negative tests and ArriveCan in the future. No big deal.
6612562,prov1800,2021-11-22 19:52:00,5010,Sounds good to me.
6612566,Cgillespie,2021-11-22 20:24:00,120,"I'm hoping the 72 hour test is gone by June, but I won't be surprised either way. I just hope the US does away with the negative test requirement to fly back home. I've had 3 shots already so I'm good in that department. I'd think proof of vaccination will be required for the foreseeable future. No big deal if you ask me."
