6488234,RickOnt,2020-09-30 11:45:00,217,There are 2 cabinsThe bigger which we stayed in has 3 single bunks and a futon.Hot n cold running water to the kitchen sinkA separate shower houseThe smaller cabin was not hooked up at that time and was used for sleeping extra people.and a separate fish cleaning house which had a freezer in it. Don and Austin kept the freezer full of ice.
6617332,ryguy,2021-12-14 06:37:00,11,I did whitclay a few years ago with Mattice and we loved it! I'm looking at it again this year but with Ogoki Frontier to try the far other side of the lake.
6617336,Larry S,2021-12-14 07:17:00,665,"Did you go to the search engine here Andrew, It has 20 or so reports on Seseganaga Lake"
6617438,gordy28,2021-12-14 16:16:00,437,Thanks Larry I did check the search function out. I think most of the reports were older At this point we ended up booking Miniss Lake w Slate Falls I pushed hard for Whiteclay but was outvoted lol Thanks! Andrew
6617464,bester,2021-12-14 17:18:00,18,I've been with Sue and Jason twice and have another week booked with them in August. I'm sure they won't disappoint you. Haven't fished Whiteclay yet but would like to get up there at some point.
6617558,Larry S,2021-12-15 06:40:00,665,"Miniss will be Great . My sister & I almost booked Maskara Lake for an early trip (End of May /Early June),but due to a problem are going to Antenna Lake with Clarks Outposts for our first trip of year We are also tentativly going back to North Caribou Lake for our 4 th trip there at end of June/Early July and last ,3rd trip to Uchi lake Lodge in Early September Will write up reports on all of them."

6487472,gordy28,2020-09-28 06:31:00,437,Hey there As we start to think about our next trip I stumbled onto two lakes that are interesting but I haven't found a lot of recent infoSeseganaga Lake Two outfitters - Ignace Outposts or Rusty Myers. For my group Ignace is a shorter hop from Thunder Bay but open to either. Main questions would be: How good is the fishing on Ses? Feedback on either/both outfitters and finally solitude factor? Looks like there are 5 or 6 outposts and 1 lodge on the lakeWhiteclay Lake Again two outfitters - Ogoki Frontier (which I cannot find much info on) and Boreal Forest (who recently took over the cabin) Similar questions - hows the fishing? Feedback on the outfitters? Have heard the Boreal camp is in a better location but interested in others opinions and feedback Cheers and many thanks Andrew
6487548,Whopper,2020-09-28 09:57:00,340,"Can't speak about the outfitters as the two I went with at WhiteClay no longer service the lake. Done 5 trips all amazing, the walleye fishing is outstanding and the pike fishing was good with 40"" fish available. The Boreal camp is the one I would go to, that camp is situated in the middle of the lake. WhiteClay is very scenic and has a beautiful gorge to the north of that camp. Besides the fishing lots of wildlife to be seen, moose, bear and eagles even sited a wolf and woodland caribou on one of my trips."
6487596,Pooch,2020-09-28 10:57:00,4618,"Used to fish Ses' fairly often years ago. It is a pretty typical Canadian Shield Lake. Though fish size was probably average to above average. It is a very nice lake to fish, but can be confusing to a first time visitor. Lake does not have huge open water areas so when the wind kicks up it will not usually be quite as bad as some other lakes we have fished. Lake is kind of divided into two parts by a large island (or land mass). If I remember correctly there are two passages connecting the two halves. We stayed at the Lodge. I found that there were too any people there for my comfort. I think the lodge tends to (or used to) cater to large groups or corporate type get togethers. If I were to return I would lean towards an outpost for more privacy. I've always been intrigued by Rusty Meyers cabin. It was new the last time I was there. (About fifteen or so years ago) So things will surely have changed a lot since. I'd rate the lake itself as above average for fishing. Lake has a lot of reefs and islands to work around keeping it interesting. And the lake is relatively large area as it ""sprawls"" more than some other lakes. Let us know what you decide and put together a trip report to where ever you end up going. Pooch"
6487616,gordy28,2020-09-28 11:47:00,437,Thanks Whopper - really helpful and appreciated Andrew
6487620,gordy28,2020-09-28 11:49:00,437,"Thanks Pooch - really appreciate the detailed response - we would definitely go the outposts route - like you we like to do our own thing Will definitely do a trip report - thats a huge part of what my blog is about - actually thinking about a shorter/closer trip for 2021 (Sess/Whiteclay is for our 2022) trip as trip reports, trip content seems to be the most popular blogs by a long shot Cheers Andrew"
6488220,RickOnt,2020-09-30 11:19:00,217,"Hi AndrewI was at Whiteclay 2 years ago when Don Elliot owned it.We had a great trip.Mainly fish for Walleye biggest 26"" but the 18"" - 22"" were everywhere you expected them to be.We did one trip to the Ogoki River and got many fish in the white water.Here we did see one other boat tied up to shore and one in the river, none down at our end of lake.Two trips to the Raymond River and once again many fish caught in the white water.Many trips up the East arm and to the gorge once again lots of fish in neck downs and on the many shoals.The Lake is very deep in the top near the gorge we marked a lot of fish here that I think were Lakers or Whitefish but we did not have the gear to get deep.But if I ever go back I would take gear for Lakers.Biggest Pike was 36"" fat and healthy.If you have more questions shoot awayGive me a message or preferably emailRick"
6488222,RickOnt,2020-09-30 11:21:00,217,Don has his own planes so no charge for overweight.As long as you were not too crazy.
6488224,RickOnt,2020-09-30 11:27:00,217,"Sue, who now owns Whiteclay with her husband Jason, Boreal Forest.Is a good pilot. She put us on a beach in Windsor Lake, with no dock."
6488226,RickOnt,2020-09-30 11:30:00,217,"The Boreal Forest camp is definitely in a good place on the Lake. A big lake but lots of areas to get out of the wind, wit the arms and rivers."
6488228,gordy28,2020-09-30 11:32:00,437,Thanks Rick - great input and really appreciated! Andrew
