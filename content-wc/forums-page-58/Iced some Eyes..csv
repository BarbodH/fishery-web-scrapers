What we did not expect was 9 of ice as usually this deeper lake freezes later more like a trout lake, so after an hour of breaking trail and checking I e we got to drop some lines on one of our preferred spots. We had no action for an hour until the sun hit the tree line, then we iced a few nice walleye, some were small and went back but I took home one just under 18 and one just under 22, fun afternoon."
