6613968,Camoclad,2021-11-29 06:32:00,628,"Of course, I just bought plane tickets for next summer, now all this talk of variants better not cancel next season. I'd travel and fish in a hazmat suit if need be."
6613988,Mojo-NC,2021-11-29 07:35:00,1929,"Well, if that happens we'll be in the same boat (pun intended). Misery loves company. For what we paid for our airline tickets to INL, we could probably fly to some nice exotic destination instead."
6613992,RichA$1970,2021-11-29 07:49:00,1159,"I feel for you guys who have to fly as with connections, luggage risk, Covid requirements and then still having to rent a car to get to the dock I think you all need a beach vacation after you get done with the fishing trip."
6614018,Camoclad,2021-11-29 09:20:00,628,"We did ok on our tickets this time, it was about $500 round trip from Atlanta to INL. I guess trip planning is like that expression that, ""you shouldn't fish memories"" when selecting where to fish on a lake, I think the past experiences of trip planning were so easy pre-pandemic that I am ""planning on memories"" and when it doesn't go so easy I get nervous/aggrevated! There will be no greater peace than to finally see that float plan leave us for a week! I hope all goes well for both our trips."
6614020,Camoclad,2021-11-29 09:24:00,628,"It is definitely worth the work to coordinate and plan the travel to have the opportunity to fish in such a beautiful/peaceful place. I don't mind the beach, and we do that pretty often since we are within a days drive to many beach locations though nothing compares to that week in Canada. Maybe it will all go well, have good weather, and get back on the good side of Murphy's Law! Ha!"
6614026,Mojo-NC,2021-11-29 09:30:00,1929,"It's difficult but we manage. We have a pretty good routine down that has not failed us yet in nearly 20 years of our trips to Canada, minus the canceled C-word year of 2020. It does get expensive with airfare, groceries, and renting a large vehicle just to drive up to Ear Falls to park it for a week, BUT IT's STILL WORTH IT! Even with the restrictions, camp boats, and limited tackle we are allowed to bring, we've still managed to catch a bunch of fish including two 30+"" walleyes, and five 40+"" pike. Can't complain about that."
6614236,stumcfar,2021-11-30 09:57:00,451,"I think these new variants are going to be the new normal. If the world shuts down for each variant, what kind of life is that going to be. Get vaccinated, don't get vaccinated and let the chips fall where they may, is my feeling."
6614280,NM_Trout,2021-11-30 13:08:00,1094,"I booked airfare as well, and made sure to select the option to cancel without penalty. Fingers crossed. I have $1200 as a deposit in place."
