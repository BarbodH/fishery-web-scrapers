Tennant is a lake we flew into with Twin Lakes Outfitters and the two moose hunters he chatted with were likely their customers. That trip into Kab which he briefly showed brings back very fond memories of a great trip. I am afraid my days of doing a trip like this may be behind me but for you youngsters I encourage you to go for it! Otherwise one day you will wake up saying shoulda, coulda, wish I woulda. Thanks Andrew. Hooks"

Life is too short when you have your health and I feel for those who bought into the scare and lost the past 2 years. The video just shows how soothing it is along with the struggles and improvising you need on a trip like that."

6613400,gordy28,2021-11-26 07:49:00,437,"I love watching outdoors and fishing related content on YouTube. One channel I watch frequently is Lost Lake. Awesome canoe and backcountry trips and lots of fishing His newest video goes through Ogoki River Provincial Park. Kapitowonga Lake, Tennant Lake, Kayedon Lake and Ogoki Lake. I loved our time on Ogoki Lake and really enjoyed the video so I figured I would share for like minded soulshttps://youtu.be/K-Dnqos_7S0CheersAndrew"
6613432,Walleye2242,2021-11-26 10:55:00,263,Agreed...i watch his channel quite a bit. Love the content and watching the scenery.
6613464,tooski,2021-11-26 15:44:00,393,Thanks so much Gordy- I have done that exact trip but from the Ogoki River back down. A lot of portaging but fantastic canoe trip. Thanks again....Joe T
6613486,Bigtaproot,2021-11-26 18:40:00,900,Super cool. Really appreciate your sharing it
6613506,v-bay gord,2021-11-26 21:20:00,3168,"A lot of folk won't watch this because it's more than a minute long. It's worth the hour and a half. My thoughts are that wilderness is so valuable, and not appreciated enough. Time where you can be alone is almost impossible these days. I'm impressed by the ability to document such a trip...on your own...aerial shots and all the planning that went into it. I'm also struck by the attitude to fishing.....perhaps being a lodge owner I see too much of the goal being a frozen fillet in the freezer. It's refreshing to see nice fish being caught (on barbless) and released. Thank you for the post.....and thank you to the dude who made the video. My only complaint might be his attempt at singing......."
6613580,That Minnesota guy,2021-11-27 08:53:00,8293,There are 2 or 3 guys doing these long distance paddles. They are inspiring and seeing the wilderness is something we all should watch. 150 years from now I have to wonder how much wilderness will be left? How much have we lost in the last 150 years?
6613594,gordy28,2021-11-27 10:43:00,437,Glad everyone enjoyed. Lately I am really loving the idea of a longer paddle trip but I think the plan is to push a little farther this year (2022) and then who knows If you like this style of video check Northern Scavenger. They have an awesome series about going across Labrador for a 3 month trip and also a good one going through Wabakimi hitting some well know fly in lakes like Whitewater and Whiteclay Cheers Andrew

6613610,Laketripper,2021-11-27 12:13:00,103,I'll be giving it a full watch...just saving it for a rum and popcorn evening.
6613616,fishron,2021-11-27 12:56:00,317,Thanks Gordy. A really well done video. Brought back memories a two week long canoe trips I made in Algonquin park in my twenties. The gear and food have made great improvements since then. (45 years ago). I asked my brother a few years back if he was good for another one. He just looked at me and shook his head no. Ron
