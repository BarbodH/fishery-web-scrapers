I got out of the habit of posting for sure, mostly because of time and even when I had time to make my videos my internet here is soooo bad it was impossible to upload them so I just stopped, I did however continue to take video footage of almost every time I went fishing over the last two years and now that I found a local grocery store with free fibre internet for customers I have been busy editing, I have been uploading to my YouTube channel like crazy as I wade through the editing process, have around 20 uploaded recently with over 39 more to make, keeps me out of jail . Lol."
