520724,Northern Manitoban,2002-05-31 15:38:00,195,HKSBH.I rebooked for next friday the 7th.I guess there is ice floating around Reed and you could get the boats out tommorrow.But you would have to watch out for ice bergs lol.I'll be getting in late friday night.I'm probably going to be coming in one vehicle my friends going to pull my boat.So look for a burgandy ford truck and a green dodge ram.I don't think i'll be needing to take my jeep.We usually stay on the water front side of the lake.If its available?we spend long days on the water.Maybe i'll see you there?

520726,hksbh,2002-06-03 21:32:00,3,"Reed lake most ice is gone but ice still on north end. People have been fishing Bucks bay on east side and what I call Bills bay around the corner from the campground.Snow lake is out ,Tramping out ,Wakusko almost out, the smaller lakes are all out.Athapap at Cranberry portage is still iced in but Cranberries are ice free.Every thing should be open by this weekend."
