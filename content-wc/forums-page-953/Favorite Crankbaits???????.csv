520926,Ohio fisherman,2002-05-30 15:16:00,989,"Hi there. In order to try some new methods this year, I was wondering what are the favorite crankbaits? Specifically, I prefer to begin with ShadRaps and go from there. I like either the #7 or #8 in silver or gold, then perch, then firetiger. If you also like the ShadRaps, what size do you prefer? What do you think of the thinner baits? Thanks and good fishing, Ohio fisherman."

They are relatively inexpensive, run true out of box, take trolling/ bumping rocks, and they catch fish.Shad raps catch fish, no dought, but in my experiance they won't stand up to trolling abuse.I won't pay $6 for a lure that will only work long enough to catch 2 or 3 fish. At $3.5, the Bomber is the bomb.Steve"

520932,Guest,2002-06-03 15:47:00,0,just back from fishing caught eyes in the hundreds mostly on the rattle-trap da silver one when got tired of casting put on the white jig with the white tail and just lifted it up and down with a fish on just about every lift.
