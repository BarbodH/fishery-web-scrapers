520865,SWeed,2002-05-30 01:15:00,66,"I was at Gullrock for the walleye opener (May 18?).....I was staying at North Shores Camp on Two Island Lake and the ice did not come off Gullrock unil tuesday. The fishing was slow and tough, You should have good fishing when you arrive in June. I did catch the biggest walleye i have ever caught in Canada an 8+ lbs of spawned out female is huge... Really like the lake and will be back there again. However not for the opener.... Any questions let me know.... Good Luck"

Some of the biggest fish we have caught have came right there in two island, around the two small islands. Where were u guys having luck?"
520867,Guest,2002-05-30 10:50:00,0,"I seen the post on Gullrock, this will be my fourth year going. I have Gullrock and Keg pretty down pat on spots never fished two island, would like to try it this year. Can you give me any insight as to where the fish hang out?Thanksjeff"
520868,Guest,2002-05-30 15:44:00,0,"On two island, when we usually go, around the first two weeks in June, the fish are around points where the wind is blowing in, fish also hang out near the mouth of the chukini river where it flows into Two Island. There are two islands in the middle of the lake, around these islands, especially the windblown side, can produce some large fish, usually around the islands we catch some very nice fish, although we dont get the large numbers of eaters. Now can you give me some info on your spots on Gullrock? Thanks"
520869,SWeed,2002-05-31 22:42:00,66,"When I was up for the opener. We caught all our eaters on Two Island in 33-25 ft of water on the north side of the big point east of the two little islands.....south of the point and you head towards dam... Tried fishing north of the little islands no luck, good water and marked fish, but no hits...When we got out on Gull Rock we caught fish up by three sisters in deep water, did catch a few eaters and couple large fish off point west of three sisters. If your at Northern Shores, Tell Hugh hi from the iowa boys that caught the first limit eaters opening weekend... We came in with a limit and no one else in camp had caught a walleye.... We went deep and drifted spinners/ or floating jigs on 2 oz. bouncers. Minnows and crawlers both produced. It was slow hard fishing. I am sure by now the walleyes are jumping in the boat. Wish I could go again in june... Relly like the area... We also fished the wall and boot island, no luck. Spent some time on Keg and caught a buch of big white fish, fun but not when your after eyes.... Fished for northerns in Stone bay one afternoon, several fish over 40"".... Have you ever fished on red lake for lake trout??? Have fun at gull rock and good luck...."

520871,Guest,2002-06-03 20:03:00,0,"I wanted to tell you about my experience on Gullrock. First I will not be there until mid July so fishing conditions might be different. We stay at five lakes lodge, great camp with great owners Bud and Melinda. For fishing the most popular and most productive is the sunken Island out in the middle of the lake southeast of the boot. Another spot is the island heading to Keg or boot island iteself. The thing about Gullrock is find a group of active fish and stick with them you will catch your share.Best of successJeff"
