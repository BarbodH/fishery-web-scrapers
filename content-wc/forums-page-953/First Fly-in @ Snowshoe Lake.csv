We were wondering whether to bring live bait and if leechs are worth the trouble. Any ideas on gear to bring that people have found indespensible on their own trips would be helpful. I read the excellent post a while back on this subject and I`d like to keep the thread alive. My own contribution for things to bring is a tennis racket-looking thing which is a handheld bug zapper. You push the button, gently wave it at a mosquito and ZAP! You have not only killed it, you vaporized it. After the 50th mosquito and several of those pesky biting ankle nipping flys it was worth the 10 bucks. It got to the point that my nephews were opening the door on purpose to let more in the cabin to zap. Enough of that. Thanks for your replies ahead of time. Kord"

521042,Guest,2002-06-04 08:14:00,0,"They were on sale at a local store (Cook`s Corner-Manitowoc, Wis.) and I`ve seen them in The Sportsman`s Guide(www.sportsmansguide.com). Another good tool is a battery operated cauterizer which physicians and podiatrists may have access to. I believe I have seen them in some fishing catalogues in the past. They are the best for cutting fireline with the hot tip. Also great for opening the eyes in new jigs. Burns right through them in a second. I always have a few in the boat as it saves me alot of time. Kord"
