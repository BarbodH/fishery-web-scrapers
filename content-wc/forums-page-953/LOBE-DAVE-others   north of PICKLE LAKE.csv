520984,lenray,2002-06-02 09:13:00,467,What a fishery caught just about all males and the locals said wait until tlhe females start biting. It got so that I didn't even cast just put out enough line so that I could lift it out without reeling even caught one on the back cast as the bait fell behind me. When it was time to get 10 between the 5 of us to eat it was just minutes.You guys who fish the way north country know what I am talking about.Thanks Lobo Dave and the others who shared info. wit me. It was 1088 miles one way for us.Wasn't inspected either way at the Soo other than to ask where we were going and the usual questions- where from etc. very pleasant experience at the border.len
520985,lobo1,2002-06-02 18:49:00,734,"something else - isn't it ? I have still to get into the females on a regular basis. Our best eye was 25"" this year. Were all of yours still full of milt ? Our northerns were still waiting to spawn - what a year ! I guess Mo Nature is about a month behind where I was.Glad to hear you did well. lobo"
520986,Guest,2002-06-02 19:44:00,0,Hi LoboYeah they were all full of milt everyone one female that we returned went 27 in. didn't see it caught by a buddy. Is it like that every year up there in the spring//???TAKE CARElen
520987,lobo1,2002-06-03 09:27:00,734,This is our first year with the long winter/late spring - AND we usually go in the first week of June. We've never had pre-spawn fish before - something new. Never had ice before either !Glad to hear you had a good trip.How did you like Pickle Lake ?Steve
520988,Guest,2002-06-03 10:46:00,0,I liked the town of Pickle Lake we gassed up just before 9 pm there time then drove out into the bush on the way north and slept in the trucks until going in on Sat/ in the lite.Came out once to get the Wings score that was about 200 miles round trip.Also went up to Windingo Gary's driveway and met Gary you had to hook up his gas pump to your truck battery to get gas very interesting.Can't imagine what the fishing would have been if the ladies were biting.A buddy of mine a young 68 who had only caught one eye in is entire life--we caught 53 and had another 20 plus to the boat no netting in a one hour time frame maybe an extra 15 minutes.len
520989,lobo1,2002-06-03 12:29:00,734,I think if the females are in the same spot they run you off the lake !!Sounds like a return trip is in order.lobo
