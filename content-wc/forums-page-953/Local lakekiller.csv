I have taken a couple smaller walleye to eat, but always CPR the nice ones. This lake had fish of all year classes, therefore it was a lot of fun. Last week I returned to it, and found a boat pulled into the lake and left there. It belongs to a local who used to own a camp and was a timberspotter for Boise Cascade before he retired. He apparently has fished this lake every day since the opener with several cronies. All indications are that they are removing full limits everyday. He has a reputation for doing this until the fish are gone and then moves on to another lake to do the same. Why do the locals do this and how do you deal with them?"
520934,SWeed,2002-05-31 22:47:00,66,"How deep is the lake, got any cement blocks? Too bad but the locals probably deal with them like we do. If it is legal you can't do squat and you can't legislate people not to be stupid..... By the way did you make sure the plug was secure in his boat?"
520935,Guest,2002-06-01 00:11:00,0,"My honest advice. Big hole / his boat. There is absolutely no way around this. MNR can't / won't enforce rules. So sad, but true.To win the war, yah gotta sink the Bismark"
520936,Guest,2002-06-01 11:14:00,0,I was hoping for a little more positive advice?
520937,Guest,2002-06-01 12:38:00,0,"TEADRINKER- sorry to say but I would think that the before mentioned replies to your subject couldn!t be MORE positive than that! If you care about this and other lakes, can!t fish if theres no boat. Getting this way all over it seems, we have to do our own thing to preserve what little fishing hunting areas are left and these types of slobs have to be dealt with in other ways if law enforcement will not step up to the problem.Just my 2 Cents but I know what would happen to that fella and friends if they were in our territory."
520940,WillieB,2002-06-01 12:54:00,292,OK...POSITIVELY sink the boat
520938,Northern Manitoban,2002-06-01 12:58:00,195,Do you know what the regulations are for this lake it must have a limit for fish?i would find out where he lives and report him.If there is a limit on this lake and he is taking fish home everyday chances are unless he's giving some of this fish away that his feezer is packed full of fish which is illegal.There must be a limit.I know where i live i'm allowed 6 fish per day but if i have 6 in my freezer i can't go out and catch and bring home 6 more.I have to eat whats in my possesion (freezer) before i bring more home.Reporting him they might even go to his house and check his freezers.Its been done before.Write to your local newspaper about this.People that do this are not fisherman they are poachers.And i have no use for them.The funs in the catching not the keeping.FISH ON.
520939,Guest,2002-06-01 19:17:00,0,"That's a good point, 22A Ontario allows 4 a day and 4 possesion limit, I guess I was too ###### to realize that, I'm going to have to find somebody from the MNR to talk to. The boat isn't really an option because I own property in the area that isn't always attended and even if I was inclined, what goes around comes around."
