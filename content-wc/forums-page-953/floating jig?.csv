520907,bbakes,2002-05-30 10:47:00,121,"A floating jig head is simply a jig that looks simaler to a leadhead, but it actually floats. I use floating jig heads on lindy rigs a lot. Simply run a slip sinker up your line, tie on a barrel swivel, make a 2-8 foot leader and tie on your floating jig head. The jig head will not float straight up unless your at a stand still. If you are backtrolling it will not contact the bottom, but it will stay up off the bottom. A floater is just the ticket for fish suspended 3-4 feet up off the bottom. A classic lindy rig will ofter stay very close to the bottom, thus fishing under these fish."

I fish with 8# Magnathin and use the same when tieing the floating jig on a 10""leader. I use 15 inchs of 4# line for a drop with a 1/2 snag free sinker. By useing the lighter sinker drop I will only lose my sinker on a bad snag. This is also a terrific rig for suspended Walleye in deep water. You just have to adjust your lengths to the desired suspension level. Have used minnows,worms and Leechs.Catch and Release"

Its caught fish this way when everything else seemed to slow down. The floaters can be hard to find though. Some look like painted 1/4 oz. jig heads and some are elongated and about 1/2 - 3/4 inch long."

The amount of shot will vary with drift speed and depth. Bait with half crawler and drift with boat sideways to the wind. The floater will keep bait just above rocks. There are other ways to fish these floaters, but this is the easiest. And it works!"
