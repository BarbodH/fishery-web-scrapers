Is the higher gear ration better for keeping bait moving slow?Should I do my 4.4 to 1 or 5.2 to 1 or 6.0 to 1 spinning reel?The second choice will be my backup.Thanks,Bob"
521018,Peanut,2002-06-03 12:58:00,929,"Well, it may help you to understand the ratios as follows:The higher the number, the more line you will reel in in a single rotation of your handle. The first number is the multiple. For example, on 1:1 reels, like fly reels, one rotation of the spool will reel in one spool diameter of line. A 6:1 reel, on the other hand, will reel in 6 times this diameter in a single rotation.I'm not sure what you mean by slower - do you want to reel in slower, or do you want the retrieve to be slower? Using your numbers, if you reeled a 4.4:1 and a 6:1 reel at roughly the same speed, the retrieve on the 4.4 would be slower, in that less line would be reeled in. And, conversely, with the 6:1 reel, you could reel slower than with the 4.4:1 reel, yet each may be bringing in line at the same rate (ie: feet/second, or whatever).In short, I guess, the smaller the first number, the slower the retrieve. Hope this helps,derrek.""Just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get me."""
521019,Guest,2002-06-03 13:07:00,0,"Thanks for the info. This is what I was looking for. In general I want to be able to retrieve jigs as slow as possible. One more questions. Given equal geer ratios does spool size play into it. I have two reels equal 6.0 ratios but one is much larger than the other. I would assume small spool equal slower pace given equal ratio.Thanks,Bob"
521020,Peanut,2002-06-03 13:45:00,929,"Yes, I think you would be correct. derrek.""Just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get me."""
