515267,Guest,2002-05-27 08:54:00,0,"I just got back yesterday from happy landing and we had a great trip. Each day we caught 40 - 60 smallies all prespawn so they were really fat. Plenty of walleyes to go around 5 over 26"". One guy in the group caught a 45"" Muskie. Can't wait to get back."
515268,Guest,2002-06-01 08:54:00,0,I'm planing to go back in early Sept. If the fishing was this good in may I can't wait to see it in the Fall. I'll post a report when I get back from my second trip.
515269,Guest,2002-06-03 06:16:00,0,"Hi there,Happy Landing is a gorgeous, well run resort on a beautiful chain of lakes. I had the pleasure of staying at Happy Landing while working with the Ministry of Natural Resources doing lake trout work on the surrounding waters. Contact the owner Matt Koerbitz and visit the website at www.happylandingfishing.com and tell him that Davis Viehbeck from Thunder Bay MNR sent you! The guide boats are 17' lund outfitters powered by honda and yamaha 50hp four-strokes. This place is great! P.s, Bring your appetite!Tight Lines,Davis Viehbeck"

515238,Guest,2001-10-30 16:39:00,0,"If you are looking for a lodge that has full service including guides take a look at southbaylodge.com they are really nice couple from so. Missouri that feed you well and they have an excellent staff of young college age fisheries biologist that know everything about the plants,and animals. Fishing there also is very good for big northern pike and lake trout. Walleye are in their portage lakes, but their guides know all about that stuff and when is the best time to go after them, or lake trout or pike. good luck."
515239,Guest,2001-11-02 14:38:00,0,"I have been to Happy Landing twice, once in 2000 and once in 2001. If you are looking for a fully guided trip for your group look no further. We went with 6 guys on our trip in 2001 and it was one of the most enjoyable fishing trips that I have ever been on. The new owner had brand new guide boats this year, a new food menu, this year we had flexible eating hours, and the fishing was awsome. Every cabin has seperate bedrooms, multiple baths, and decks on them. Our trip was Aug. 2-8. We have already made our reservations for next year for the same week. I highly recommend this resort give them a call at 218-283-0990. Tell them that Rich sent you."
515241,Guest,2001-11-14 21:06:00,0,There is a new owner there and Matt Koerbitz. Great place. Here is his toll free 1-800-766-0876 and site www.happy-landing-lodge.comDon't look for an e mail address because there isn't one there.Happy fishingBob
515242,Fitch,2001-11-21 21:42:00,75,"I was there this summer with a crew from Japan. Out guide was Morgan. He took us 4 of us plus himself in their new Lund Outfitter. It was amazing even with that load and a 50 HP Honda we could cruise about 30 MPH. These people from Japan had a blast catching Walleye, Northerns and Bass. We were treated like royality. Great pool tables and food. Not to mention the bar........lol. They place has a face lift of new equipment. The new owner Matt has gone way out to make sure his guests will be happy. Going to book again for this coming year. Recommend this place A++++"
515243,Guest,2001-12-07 11:43:00,0,"I have been to many fishing resorts throughout the U.S. and Canada and was thoroughly impressed with Happy Landing Lodge. Annie and I spent six fabulous days there and while I spent many of my days fishing with Seth, Annie fished a few days and relaxed near the lodge. The CUSTOMER SERVICE was outstanding!! The food was great, the best part was we could eat when we wanted. Not only is the lodge great the area is great also. It really is God's country up there. There is something to be said about waking up to the LOONs everymorning.I would like to take this opportunity to Thank Mr. Koerbitz and is staff and cannot wait to see you all next summer for another Absolutely Amazing week on Pipestone Lake.Thanks again,Pete Ryan"
515249,Guest,2001-12-20 15:55:00,0,I went up to Happy Landing this summer after talking to Matt Koerbitz at the Minneapolis 10 day show. I booked a trip in Auguest for 3 days of fishing and I must say it was wonderfull. Everything that Matt had talk about at the show was carried throug plus much more. The food was wonderfull and I loved the home made bread! My buddies and myself took a guide with use when we were there and I must say it helped the fishing. Morgan and Seth our guides new were to take us. The fishing was great each day and each day we fished a different lake. With so much water and with such a helpfull staff I would recomened this resort to my clients and friends. For more information call Matt at 1-800-766-0876.
