6332996,port1042,2019-06-20 14:59:00,509,Have a great trip. We didn't make our normal trip to Perrault this spring so I need to wait until Labor Day week before I'll stop regretting that change. Rather than worry about the Hawkeyes or the Huskers why not just settle on the Badgers and enjoy the trip?
6333010,team walleye,2019-06-20 15:31:00,336,You know my brother in law is a big Wisconsin fan. Born and raised in Wisconsin and went to UW. Let's just agree that the big 10 in general sucks
6333348,eyegator,2019-06-21 15:46:00,29,That's really too bad. Cheers to another 4-8 season
6332096,team walleye,2019-06-18 07:18:00,336,Leaving for Perrault Falls this coming Saturday about 2am! Right now I am currently sitting at work in front of the computer trying to figure out how I am going to make it through the work day and get past Wednesday and Thursday. The brutal week before the trip had a strong hold on me!
6332180,labsrus,2019-06-18 10:00:00,557,I feel your pain. Been out fishing Lake Erie a few times this year as well as Oneida. Been lucky to get some nice fish for the freezer I have a new Garmin unit on the boat and last night I was looking at some features on the Garmin. Went to the lake where I fish and messed around with some of the chart settings. Looked at various tracks and waypoints on the lake. Started to think of our trip later in the year. looking forward to being able to walk out of the cabin and to the boat and just hop in to go fishing. The only thing to bring is my cup of coffee. Good times.

6332216,BlueJayBert,2019-06-18 12:31:00,15,Heading to Manotak on Saturday! Why does this week go by so slow and the week in Canada flys?!! Maybe I'll see you at the Sandbar in the evening. Safe travels.

6332302,Jeler,2019-06-18 16:24:00,92,"Hey you Cyclones have the same anxiety us Hawkeyes have! I feel your pain,( i'm envious) we don't leave on our fly in till late August and it's also starting to drive me nuts! All ready lying in bed to sleep and bouncing things around my head as what to take/bring, and do I have it on my ""packing List"" spread sheet.I sincerely wish you a great time fishing, safe travels from one Iowan to another, and most important relax and have a fun.JeffSolon, IA"
