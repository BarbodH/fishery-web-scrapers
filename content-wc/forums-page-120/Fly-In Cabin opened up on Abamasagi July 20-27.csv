We are headed to Abamasagi through Twin Lakes Outfitters July 13-20 for our second year and I just saw an unexpected cancellation occurred on a cabin for July 20-27th. Maybe my own excitement in leaving in a few weeks has me at a fever pitch, but thought I would mention it here for others. (Sort of like wanting to share your favorite movie or book or opinion...you can't help yourself) I can try to talk the wife into letting me stay an extra week, but I'd likely be served papers while I'm working. Very reasonable rates (at least to us) and a search on this forum shows a great reputation."

Answer was yes, but camp was closed a week while waiting for moose bow hunters. I was dropped off. Told Pete to tell camp owner I was in camp. Had one of my party call my wife to let her know I'd be home later. 8 days later was buzzed by owner, meaning: bring in a full limit of walleyes because I'd be having a dinner guest. Back at cabin that night I saw that all my warm beers were in the refrigerator. Party time with owner and a couple of camp workers. Boated my best ever walleye during the extra week."

And for those that know this lake thts saying something. We arent #counters, but in all our trips you realize youve boated and released over 100 walleyes each day......not this time. Those #s were easily 150 to over 200 on a few days. Thts amazing see that its not JUly-Aug where you find them in deeper water on structure bunched up and you set up ontop of them and vertical jig one after another. !st 3wks of June are a shoreline, points, rocky bays, etc type of fishing but it was lights out!!!! The week ended with the beginings of an early mayfly hatch....1st time on this lake we seen tht taking place. Chad and TLO is still a fantastic outfitter."
