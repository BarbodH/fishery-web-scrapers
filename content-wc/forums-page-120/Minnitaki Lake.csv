To be honest, I think things will only get better as the fish are scattered all over. We caught fish in anywhere from 5-30 feet. 20-25 seemed like the spot though. As always, find where the wind is blowing and start shallow working out deeper. I would think by the 5th you would be good and they will be in their summer patterns and easier to locate. For the most part they are not out on the reefs yet but that should change quickly. Water is OK but it is dropping. They really could use some more rain up there to help keep it closer to normal. If I had to guess maybe a foot or a little more low for this time of year. If you want any more detailed info just let me know. Good luck and safe travels!!"

Could be an all day rain today, but it's supposed to clear out for the rest of the week. I went out yesterday afternoon and you're right the fish aren't where they usually are this time of the year. We did scratch out a fish dinner though. The water is a lot higher than it was this time last year, but I have seen it higher."
