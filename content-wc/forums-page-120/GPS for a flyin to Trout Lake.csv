6323062,cnewcomer,2019-05-20 01:44:00,4,Heading to Trout Lake in for a fly in to Boois island in early June. I am a novice to hand held GPS units. Any reccomendations for a GPS purchase for this lake. The easier to use the better. Also can I get a Trout Lake map on these units? Thanks in advance.

I have an old Garmin Explorist and it does the job just fine. I will be at Booi's the first week in July. Been ther once before. Great lake, great camp, and great people. You will have a wonderful trip."

6333910,tim.123,2019-06-24 00:04:00,13,How was your trip to Booi's? Heading up there this Friday. Interested on how you did. Any Mayflies around?
6333974,cnewcomer,2019-06-24 07:15:00,4,"No issues with Mayflies at all. We were there June 9-14 cold weather, 40s in the morning and lots of wind. The big female walleyes didnâ€™t seem real active that week with the largest walleye between four of us was 23 inches. But always a great trip at Boois. I got the feeling Jim and Tracy only have a few more years until selling out. Have a great trip"
