He's 63 with a bad hip, bad knees, and is as far away from an outdoorsman as you can get. He is going with a gentleman that is 80 that has been there several times.Has anyone been at this camp? I would appreciate some feedback. My concern is the condition of the camp boats. Do the have flat floors, size, etc. I looked on their website but couldn't get a good idea. Frankly, I'm a little concerned. I've given him my inflatable life jacket and told him to keep it on. I hate to step on the toes of his fishing partner who has several trips under his belt but would feel better knowing what it's like at that camp."
