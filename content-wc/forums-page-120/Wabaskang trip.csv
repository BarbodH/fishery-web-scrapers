The weather was perfect low 70s day with 50 nights, clear skies with just a cloud or two, just a slight chop on the water, and the big walleyes were on the bite. 29 1/2 was the biggest. A lot of 22s must have been a good year class. They were in fairly shallow water but the water was warming fast. I have been going to this camp for 30 years and the bite was as good as I have ever seen. I'll bet most of the lakes in the Perrault Falls, Ear Falls area was good last week. Billy"
