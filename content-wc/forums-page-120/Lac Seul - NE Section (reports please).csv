6334016,wooglin,2019-06-24 08:46:00,371,Wondering if we can start a thread for musky/walleye reports out of the NE Section of Lac Seul. I'm staying at Lac Seul Outposts 8/10-8/17 and would like to hear how everyone has been doing up in that area. Thanks!

The weather is supposed to clear out by tomorrow, so I will probably spend most of the time on Lac Seul. I'll let you know how it goes. I'd rather not take that boat ride in the rain, so I'm staying here yesterday and today. Paul"
