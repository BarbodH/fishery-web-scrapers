6331372,BuckeyeATC,2019-06-15 16:19:00,88,Myself and a couple other individuals will be flying into Mamkwash/Upper Goose Lake area later this summer (July/August). Have any of you fished either Mamakwash or Upper or Lower Goose lake? Just wondering how you did? Were the fish shallow or deep? Any other details you might be able to provide. Thanks in advance.

You have large open lake areas, rivers, water falls, rock walls, portage lakes, etc. Early on I did not keep detailed records like I do now. Looking back through the logs 2008 was our best year for numbers. Eight guys boated 2,056 fish. Over the years we caught walleye to 30"" and pike to 42"". Here is my report from July 4 - 11, 2008: As a group we caught 2,056 fish Best day for group was 423 fish (west wind) Slowest day for group was 141 fish (east wind/rain) Most fish per guy was 296 (Dewey)(I had 295) Best individual day was 94 fish (me) Slowest individual day was 10 fish Largest walleye was 28"" Largest pike was 41"" (Dewey) Had to have bait. While some fish were caught on cranks, spinners and jig/tail combos the vast majority were caught with a chunk of night crawler (went through 80 dozen) Lows were in the 40's and 50's We hit 80 on Saturday the 5th otherwise 2 days hit 70 and 4 days in the 60's Black fly and mosquitoes were bad We had 1"" of rain fall during the week Fish were everywhere form 4' to 25' of water - wind blown points were best. Very few fish on main lake humps. Mayflies were just starting to hatch One year we caught over 400 walleyes from the dock. Let us know how you did when you get back. You can PM me for more details."

Have always caught a lot of fish with some size mixed in. Walleye to 29"" and Pike to 42"". I don't think you can go wrong on any of those three lakes on the Berens River system."
