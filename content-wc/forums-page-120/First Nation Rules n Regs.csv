6331868,Obabikon,2019-06-17 12:10:00,2370,"I'm going to use Lake of the Woods as an example Groups of 10 eating 2 (or often more) walleyes everyday for a week, then taking home 4. That's in the range of 100+ walleyes for every single group of 10 that does that. At our resort, we have 35+ guests each week. They almost always do a shore lunch. Our resort alone takes more fish in a year than most natives. So, being conservative... we kill 250-300 walleyes a week. We're open 20 weeks a year. We are probably an average resort for kills. I'm not saying that netting's a good thing. I refuse to buy fish when I'm out to eat for that reason. However, the reality is... fishermen are much bigger consumers than commercial operations. While there are more of us, we still are the ones taking the higher quantity (by quite a bit) out of the lake. Fishermen are also the ones most likely to buy fish at their local diner. The key to any fishery is regulation. You should be safe building in Red Lake, because it is a well regulated fishing industry. Just like Lake of the Woods is. Most commercially fishing natives who I know are incredibly respectful of nature. They understand what they take out of the lake is special, and they want their grandchildren to be able to use the resource. Of course, there are bad apples, just like every now and then reading an article of someone taking 500 walleyes and trying to smuggle them across the border. I've also read about anglers having freezers full of fish at home, and still keeping more limits. If netting is done correctly... it will not hurt the fishing (at all) especially on large fisheries. This is why this is such a ""nuclear"" topic. People feel very strongly about it. With the original post, it was pretty obvious what direction it was headed. The reality is... it isn't that simple. A handful of guys netting is not going to destroy a lake. The 500,000 fishermen that travel there and take 10 fish out each are much more impactful."
6331888,johnboat,2019-06-17 12:55:00,2014,How about this for an example:What are the total dollars kicked back to the resource in licensing etc from the fisherman compared to what the First Nation has to pay in to do their netting?I'm just curious if the First Nations are charged by the pound or if it is an annual fee that they are required to pay to use the resource.
6331894,kzoofisher,2019-06-17 13:10:00,5144,"Iâ€™m not aware in either Canada or the US of any rights that are dependent on your monetary contribution to society. You may be on to something though. $100 every time you want to speak freely or go to church. $10 for every round you fire from a gun. $1000 for the presumption of innocence. $100,000 to not have to incriminate yourself. Might be able to balance some budgets that way."
6331934,Bill Krejca,2019-06-17 15:11:00,6107,"Lo - I'm not familiar with the present situation at Red Lake. In many areas the netting has not done a deal of harm to the fishery, in some other places with which I am familiar, nightly pounding has decimated a diameter of several miles, it all depends on many factors some of which I am familiar, others of which I am not. Some factor examples are availability for jobs in the area, distances traveled, accessibility to the water, general economic conditions, agreements between locals-perhaps including local businesses, availability of fish in the area, hatches over the years, proximity of processing facilities, supply and demand, and probably many other factors not easily explained. Like most everything else in life, conditions can change, either for better or worse or as in sickness or in health.... Regarding pay to play(netting license, et al)- I am not aware of any yearly, etc., fees paid for netting privileges by those who do, general opinion is rather that the govt furnishes the equipment, but this could be completely false. Those who are aware of differences in my comments, please correct me, I have just stated what I believe to be the circumstances. The north woods is still the greatest place I have ever been, and consider it just one step below Heaven. Bill"
6331942,Namegosikaa,2019-06-17 15:29:00,61,"It's my understanding that first nations are not subject to size slots or limits and require no license, having said that netting outside traditional territory for commercial purposes requires a commercial license. Nakina for example, esnagami is in the traditional territory of aroland first nations but Ara lake lays outside, both are netted but Ara is commercially done with mnr approval. It's important to keep in mind that first nations have always used nets or traps for fishing for millennia, it's never been about sport but survival and to some extent that has stayed the same. Many first nations communities have no or limited access to a economy, it's not uncommon for unemployment rates of 70+% so hunting and fishing remain a huge part of their livelihoods. I personality might kill 5 fish a year for a shore lunch or two but I begrudge no one who needs it nor do I point fingers when fish and game numbers decrease because when you point a finger and look at my hand you will notice three fingers pointed right back at me"
6332008,Obabikon,2019-06-17 20:22:00,2370,"It is almost like you're comparing two totally different currencies and saying one trip is cheaper. How much is NW Ontario worth? The MORAL thing would be to give it back to the natural inhabitants. First Nation people that we slaughtered and destroyed cultures. We could move out and let the true Natives decide how to live on their land. That (of course) is not realistic. So (in a way) the Government compromises. We both get to use the lake. People complain about First Nations netting and killing fisheries, but completely ignore what we have done. 1. We over harvest, because we over populate. 2. We pollute more, because we over populate. 3. We are the ones responsible for invasive species, because we don't care about ramifications. 4. We are more likely to build huge homes right on the water, because we are self-centered. Who are really the ones destroying nature? After all of what I have said, I'm happy with the way the balance is currently working. Lake of the Woods has better walleye fishing now than anytime in my entire life. There's netting, and there's a ton of tourism... however the MNR has done a good job of regulating the wellness of the fishery."
6332018,Obabikon,2019-06-17 20:50:00,2370,"Let's talk about farming in the US for a second... remember when we had wooded areas? Nobody cares what clear cutting does to the environment or much less wildlife habitat. Much less insecticides and fertilizers... which have destroyed WAY more fish populations than Natives have. Farmers need to make a living, right? Natives don't want to kill a fishery. That's their lively hood. Let's not be hypocritical of other cultures, simply because we don't like one small aspect of one. We caused more damage to North American lakes in 10 years (from 1980-1990) than Native Americans have caused in their 12,000 years on the continent. VBay pointed out earlier, this topic is nuclear. I should have stayed away, but I feel pretty strongly. Christians can refer to Matthew 7:5..."
6332056,tv4fish,2019-06-18 05:37:00,2694,"THAT might be ""overstating"" things just a bit.I'm a former farm kid - and there were and are quite a few farmers that do and did care about the environment and also they know and realize what makes good ""crop land"" and what is best left as a forest, rather than even try to ""clear cut"" and attempt to farm it. Some farmers actually have some common sense.............."
6332072,Obabikon,2019-06-18 06:24:00,2370,"I'm not sure what I overstated, but I would say that MOST farmers care about the land. The exact same is true of First Nations fishermen. Farming has caused a lot of damage to the environment over the past 100 years. I'm not saying that farming is bad. I am personal friends with many farmers. They work hard and live off the land. They are good people, who care about the environment. I am personal friends with many First Nation fishermen. They work hard and live off the land. They are good people, who care about the environment. Sure... in the past there have been examples of bad people exploiting the resource. But, most of us learn from our mistakes as people."
6332204,LoDo,2019-06-18 12:09:00,721,"To be honest, I'm glad I went here with this thread. Several good points, learned loads and can't be more excited to build this cabin! Thanks all!"
6332312,emma17,2019-06-18 16:48:00,436,I'm not debating your entire point. This idea of giving back the land to original inhabitants that was forcefully taken from them is quite the slippery slope for the entire world. There are plenty of bible references about land grabbing too.
6332480,Obabikon,2019-06-19 05:59:00,2370,"I guess I see what you're saying. I wasn't meaning to suggest that land returns actually needed to happen. Just trying to remind people the real reason for the treaties. The problem is, many people look at treaty rights and welfare in the same way. That's wrong. Treaty rights are so that Natives can live the way their culture chooses in the world we forced on them. Welfare is to take care of people unable or unwilling to work for whatever reason. Just two very different things in my mind."
6333284,PRO-V16,2019-06-21 11:35:00,454,"Kevin, it was obviously a joke. Can't believe you fell for it."

6333904,The tank,2019-06-23 22:47:00,340,Joke or not fish meal is real high in proteins and years ago when I drove truck part time I hauled it to a purina plant they put it in some specialty feeds for show pigs. It stinks soooo soooo bad.

I would be especially interested in learning about your land purchase journey and what you have learned about your cabin building dream in Canada.I can also give you some suggestions on fishing the West end of Red Lake as it looks like you are heading up there soon this season and next.Best of luck,PjShorthorn"
6332070,Pooch,2019-06-18 06:22:00,4618,"I had read an article several years ago stating the there are more trees across the central plains now than in the distant past. If I ever find the paper, I'll share it.Looking back upon my youth I can see that there are more tree lines in the country, but less and less trees in the cities. Dutch Elm eliminated most of the nice mature trees in our local small town years ago and replacement plantings have had sporadic success.I agree completely about anglers taking far too many fish out of most any waters. Especially the further north you travel.JMOPooch"
6331534,kzoofisher,2019-06-16 13:23:00,5144,Glad you chimed in. Is it true that to really fatten up the pigs you supplement the walleye meat with a mixture of musky and bald eagle?
6331536,Hot Runr Guy,2019-06-16 13:26:00,16061,"Actually, it's only the Musky cheeks. The rest of the fish isn't worth using,,,,, HRG"
6331550,lionfan19,2019-06-16 14:16:00,41,Kzoo I about fell out of my chair laughing when I read your post. Good stuff.
6331564,LoDo,2019-06-16 14:36:00,721,In other words First Nation is allowed to net walleyes in their spawning grounds and ruin fisheries. Got it!
6331568,v-bay gord,2019-06-16 14:56:00,3168,"Well, aren't you glad you finally got that out of your system. Now back to frying up my musky cheeks...."
6331570,kzoofisher,2019-06-16 15:01:00,5144,HRG was on fire with his post too.
6331734,Freytown,2019-06-17 06:09:00,770,Spot On....you get it. FT
6331752,LoDo,2019-06-17 07:07:00,721,Yes. Fairly new to this site and didn't realize you can come out and be so blunt. Good to know! A group of us are under contract buying land and building a cabin this summer. We certainly didnt know first nation was allowed to net fish any longer. Impossible to find this info on line. Makes sense i guess. Would hate to invest on a lake thats a popular netting area for first nation.
6331782,Bill Krejca,2019-06-17 08:06:00,6107,"Information on this activity is not real well publicized, other than an occasional protest of one kind or another. Areas hit can be medium sized bodies of water as well as large bodies of water. Nets can pretty much decimate the fish population if continued in an area. Winter netting and/or night time netting is not as well observed, although very real. Waters with access to a processing depot are subject to this activity, fly-in fish pick up is not uncommon from waters which may not be close to the packing factory. Bill"
6331796,LoDo,2019-06-17 08:51:00,721,"Should one be concerned building a cabin on far west Red Lake? Red Lake is a huge fishery and I notice Black Bear and Bow Narrows receive plenty of traffic within their camps. There are a few options in unorganized NW Ontario to build a cabin and would hate to pick an area / lake where netting completely ruins a fishery. Lets be honest, we go to Canada to enjoy time with family and friends, but we'd all prefer to do that catching fish too."
6331244,LoDo,2019-06-15 07:46:00,721,Anyone have good info on first nation rules and regs fishing Ontario? Do they require fishing license? What about conservation or sportsman license? Do the first nation folks have a slot limit? Do they have a limit on fish they can keep? I'm curious the rules for first nation in Ontario compared to natives in the states.
6331272,v-bay gord,2019-06-15 08:53:00,3168,"The short answer is no, no, no, no and yes. Likely a nukable topic."
6331282,kzoofisher,2019-06-15 09:34:00,5144,"Don't know anything about the First Nations in Canada. I do know that in the US we made deals with the tribes; if we want to change the deal we have to break it even though they've been living up to their end. It's like if you bought a new boat from a dealer but when it was delivered it had half the HP you agreed to, none of the electronics and a lower end trailer. You go to court and the court tells you too bad, you're stuck with it. After 15 years of battling in court you finally win and the dealer agrees that in the future you'll get what you paid for. Then the dealer decides he could have gotten a better price so he tells you your going to have to pay more for the boat you already bought. You made all your payments on time and it's paid off and you tell him to jump in the lake. But he has good friends in politics so they wrote a law that lets him repo your boat and gives you the opportunity to negotiate buying it back. Oh, and you're not allowed to buy a different boat from someone else. You would rightly think that dealer and politicians are scum, never to be trusted and probably ought to be jailed. In the case of the treaties it isn't you who bought the boat, it's your neighbor. You're mad he got the deal so you want to take it away from him or force the dealer to give you the same deal minus the original ripoff. You can start a petition drive to force your point of view but you're going to have to convince a majority of people in the rest of the country that your neighbor is the bad guy here. Good luck with that."
6331288,LoDo,2019-06-15 09:59:00,721,Hilarious! Don't dare ask a question about the first nation folks on this thread.
6331306,kzoofisher,2019-06-15 11:47:00,5144,You can ask an honest question which you did. You got a couple of honest answers in response. Just a matter of time until someone comes on here crying that it isn't fair that they can't have what someone else has because they haven't paid the price.
6331310,v-bay gord,2019-06-15 12:06:00,3168,"Well, the question does not contain any background to answer the question without it becoming an emotional and pointless argument. Perhaps a better question would be ""Should treaties be honored today?"" The questions you ask about limits, licenses etc are the outcome of legal obligations resulting from the original treaties."
6331444,Baseline,2019-06-16 07:00:00,3207,Yep. The Native Nations all have supersized trawlers cruising all the lakes. They grind up all the fish and export it to Iowa as pig food.
6331474,kzoofisher,2019-06-16 09:18:00,5144,"Wait, wut? It's all Iowa's fault? Oh man, I feel bad about that. Now, if you had said it was all Nebraska and Ohio's fault I would be 100% behind you."
6331514,Kevin23,2019-06-16 12:23:00,2205,"Feeding pigs ground up fish from canada? Never heard of that one. Every pig farmer I know here i iowa feeds a blend of soybean and corn, and melons/pumpkin in the fall. If anyone does feed fish meal, i would assume its for a special diet additive.. calcium maybe? Surely not enough to drive a commercial market export from canada.... Sounds like a wives tale rumor spread from someone who did sell some to a pig farmer from iowa once. Just like the people who think the Minnesota natives spear millions of walleye to sell to casinos down south."
6331520,lionfan19,2019-06-16 12:28:00,41,"Baseline is spot on, I export ground up walleye from all the lakes up here. We only keep the big females. Pigs seem to like them best."
