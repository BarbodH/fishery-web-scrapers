Are the walleye at the dam area yet in late May and do they move away from the dam area by the end of June? Or do the walleye pretty much stay in the dam area all the time? I have fished below the dam usually no more than 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile away from the dam in early June. thanks in advance, Pete"
