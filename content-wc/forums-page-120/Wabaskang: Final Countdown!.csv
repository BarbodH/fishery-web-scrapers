(6/22 to 6/28)It looks like it has been a cool spring, but that it will be normal to warm at the end of the 10 day forecast. I've never fished NWO at this time of year, so I'm not exactly sure what to expect. I've been opening weekend and early September recently, and August/Sept in the past.I've read a fair amount of reports over the years and think I have some idea of what to expect. Anybody with experience at this time of the year, let me know if these sound right:Surface water temps in the mid to high 60s (higher in bays, lower in large basins).Subsurface weeds (cabbage) will be growing, but not to the full height/thickness.Northerns will be in mid-depth weeds and perhaps rocks too. Small fish will jump in the boat--larger ones may be tentative but are not yet constrained to deep parts of the lake.Walleye will be shallow (10-15') often around weedlines. Larger fish will be starting on deeper structure and open water patterns.Bass will be spawning or in post-spawn and should be active in shallow cover.Perch and Crappie will be in shallow weeds and pencil reeds.Trout are already in their summer holes and at least 30 feet below the surface.Some chance of mayfly hatches near the end of end of the week, especially if the week is warm. Basins with mayfly hatches will be tough for daytime walleye.We'll have three first-timer kids with us and two first-timer wives with us. I'm really looking forward to showing them a good time. The way I look at it, the more fun we have, the sooner I'm coming back!Anybody other tips, tricks, spots, reports? Feel free to PM me."
