6194814,pjshorthorn,2018-05-16 04:43:00,5654,"Many of you may recall a thread from last year where I kept track of how many states were going to be represented via fishing trips to Canada with the number of people from each state included. Since the opener in Canada is now upon us, it is time to start gathering the information for this year. How many US states will be represented this fishing season in Canada ? Post your state and the states where your group members are from ,as well as, how many individuals from each state. I'll keep track of how many US states are represented this season and send out a periodic update. Below is last year's synopsis which was quite impressive on the number of states represented.Wisconsin was the leader,but only due to a bus trip of 42 individuals which may be a suspect data point,hence the asterisk next to the state. I really think is was a beer drinking/ cheese eating party that got lost and crossed over into Canada to replenish beer supplies. I hope everyone has a great trip this year with many new memories made during those trips. PjShorthorn Iowa -71 Michigan -29 Illinois - 39 Wisconsin- 106 *. ( 42 person casino bus trip gone wrong ???? ) Ohio - 20 New York -12 Indiana - 20 Nebraska - 10 South Dakota - 12 Florida - 13 Colorado -14 North Carolina - 7 Kansas - 35 Minnesota - 36 Pennsylvania - 17 California - 3 Kentucky - 14 Georgia - 4 Virginia - 2 Nevada - 2 Connecticut - 2 Maryland - 2 Texas - 19 Arizona - 1 Missouri - 9 Mississippi - 2 Utah - 1 New Jersey - 3 New Mexico - 1 Massachusetts - 3 South Carolina - 1 West Virginia - 12 Tennessee - 14 Arkansas - 3 Vermont - 6 Idaho - 1 North Dakota - 1 Washington - 1 Puerto Rico - 1.
