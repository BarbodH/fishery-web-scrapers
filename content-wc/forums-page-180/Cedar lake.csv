5729217,wallydave,2017-08-21 06:41:00,2151,My wife and I will be on Cedar Lake the week of 9-15 @ Cedar Point Resort if you are around it would be nice to meet you!
5729825,Bill Krejca,2017-08-21 10:33:00,6107,You are going a week too soon! I'll wave on the way in! Bill
5730081,wallydave,2017-08-21 11:44:00,2151,I'll try to leave a couple of fish for you!
5702034,Bill Krejca,2017-08-04 15:31:00,6107,"I'm guessing you are fishing the clearer west side early, then maybe move over to the east side, which is not so clear, as the sun becomes more of a factor. I'll be up the last week of September, perhaps this time, we'll meet up. If you have time, put some ""X""'s on the rocks where the hot spots are!! Bill"
5702874,prov1800,2017-08-05 08:11:00,5010,We did fish west side more thsn the east side.more structure on the west side.didxeast end sone but real slow and could hardly find a fish down there.no schools and when you found some no bite.lol.west side much better in certain areas and early was best and didnt last long.i have had nunerous slow days of slow fishing and this last week ranks in the top.found some crappie hangouts but they behaved the same as the walleyes.had to be very patient to get them even though they darted up to your bait had a look and went back down.lol.good thing i had guests this week that were up to the challenge.all in all we ended up doing pretty good.smallmouth bit pretty good in certain spots and perch were on fire.muskies seemed to be in a good window to but pike were almost non excistent.iam sure we will meet up in sept this year.
5706946,wallydave,2017-08-08 07:02:00,2151,We will be leaving for my first trip to Cedar Lake a month from today! Any updates on the fishing?
5713314,prov1800,2017-08-11 06:30:00,5010,ill be out on cedar a few more times before you get up and ill let you know whats happening.it will get good by and in September as it always does but fishing is fishing.
5713418,wallydave,2017-08-11 07:16:00,2151,29 days to go! I am looking forward to trying a new lake!
5715274,SinOrSwim,2017-08-12 10:24:00,1528,"We just got back. Had a really fun trip but the fishing was brutal. Brutal might be too nice of a word. Makes it very tough with an 8yo. One group had more musky (2) than they had anything else. We tried different depths, minnows, worms, areas. One area of the lake was producing a few fish but when you get there and there are 6 boats already in the area.....makes it tough to find a spot. I don't want to teach my kids to be ""that guy"" who moves in on another person. Wasn't just us. Both cabins on either side were having a similar experience. Didn't get up by 5:30 but one morning on the lake by 6:30 to 6:45. Still nothing. would mark fish in some spots but no bite. That said, it's one of my favorite places. The camp, people, the location, the entertainment for the kids with the planes, playground, paddle boards, flat area to toss the football etc. Broke up the trip by making a couple trips to Vbay for lunch, mini golf and ice cream. Had an awesome trip but have never in 20 plus years caught so few fish."
5726833,eyeboom,2017-08-19 13:10:00,940,"We just got back from Cedar. Had to work through some adversity also. On the way up from Nebraska, we lost a wheel/hub assembly off our Ranger 621 around Fargo. After checking with Ranger and all of the dealers in a 500 mile radius with no part found, we ended up at Visto's Trailer Sales in Fargo. The guys there were able to fabricate a hub assembly, cap off the brake line and get us back on the road. On the way back, we were ""greeted"" by a deer that wiped out the passenger side of my friends new Ford Expedition. After pulling a fender out we were able to proceed home without any further incidences. Now for the report. We stayed a Cedar Lake Lodge with Al & Kim. Having read many posts about poor fishing, we knew it would be a challenge, and had to up our game. The first afternoon we ""hunted"" the southwest section of the lake and had some success on walleye up to 17"" bringing in a decent stringer. The next morning we worked over some of the areas we found the day before and had similar success along with catching some bonus crappie and perch. After a mid afternoon lunch, we headed over to the east side where we had found structure on previous trips. Checked several spots and didn't mark any fish which had us concerned. On our ""milk run"" we headed over to couple of other main spots and it was game on. We averaged 52 fish per day for 4 people so it was good fishing. The best part was that we caught really high quality fish there. The majority of the walleye were in the 17-18.5"" range and very healthy alone with some jumbo perch, small-mouth and a couple of 15"" crappie. Our biggest walleye went 29, 27, several 25's (one being the fattest I've ever seen on Cedar) and a dozen or so from 22.5-19 all released. Presentation: We tried everything from plugs, jig and minnow, leeches, crawlers etc. Our go to presentation was rigging with wire bottom bouncers, a 30"" fluorocarbon leader and a #4 Gama hook with 2 small beads. Speed was from .4-.9 mph. Depth ranged from 7-17'. Interestingly enough, one of our hottest bites one day was on a flat next to structure with a bright sun in 7-10' of water. Those fish hit like a freight train! I was constantly glued to the Humminbird and noted that the vast majority of fish came in transition areas from soft to hard bottoms. Hook/bead colors didn't seam to matter. Al and Kim are great hosts along with Bill who constantly made sure our needs were met. A BIG bonus to the trip was meeting guide John Jacobs (prov1800). Just a great guy and a real pleasure to talk to. He made the effort to come over to our island just to meet me as I had messaged him previously. He sent me some ""fish porn"" of previous monsters he has caught and all I can say is WOW! All in all our best trip ever to Cedar (with the exceptions of the break downs). We mainly fish the Missouri River reservoirs and utilized those tactics on Cedar which proved to be very productive. Moral of the story is that you need to try various approaches beyond the usual methods and let the fish tell you what they want. Phil"
5726857,eyeboom,2017-08-19 13:19:00,940,More pics of the bigger fish
5726897,prov1800,2017-08-19 13:41:00,5010,Great report phil.glad it all turned out good.great to meet up with you.
5729009,Pat,2017-08-20 23:31:00,203,"Got back today after a week on Cedar Lake. It was our first trip to Cedar and we stayed a Clark's Northern Lights Resort. Wayne and Karla run a nice camp and set us up with a ""starter"" map of spots to try. My biggest concern on a new lake was making sure we didn't run into a rock or deadhead log, it's always a little stressful learning where all the danger areas are. Most real danger were marked with a jug, I did find one rock area about 1.5' deep where the rope was there but the jug gone. I was basically idling through the area and watching the depth and avoided disaster. Found one other spot where I tapped a deadhead log that was about 2' under water, again idling so no damage. On to the fishing report. The ""crew"" was my wife and I. Tried most of the usual techniques but found a jig and minnow to be the most consistent approach. Caught the vast majority of fish from 8 to 18 fow, with mid-lake humps being the best structure followed by bars running our from islands. Our best day was Wednesday when right before the rain came in. Our fish ranged from 13"" to 18.5"", no big ones, and we averaged 20 to 25 fish per day. Couple days we did some exploring/sightseeing since it was our fist time on the lake, so fishing time was reduced. We had better luck on the west side of the lake, but found and caught fish on the s too. But since we were finding fish on the west side we didn't make the run l the way over to to east every day. I believe was say prov1800's truck and trailer one day at camp but I didn't get to meet him, we were in and out camp and never crossed paths. Maybe next time. We'll return to Cedar, had a very good first experience. With more knowledge on the lake now I think we can hit the ground running next trip."
5694794,eyeboom,2017-07-31 18:28:00,940,"We leave the the 11th for Cedar. Looks like we're in for a bit of a challenge! May have to break out the ""banjo minnow"" LOL. Phil"
5694850,WallyWarrior,2017-07-31 18:45:00,2488,"In no way am I proclaiming the banjo minnow to be a great lure, but there was a day when things were going very slow, busted out the ole banjo and hammered the fish. These were bass however, but it really did a heck of a job on that day. Have never caught a fish on them since then and actually no longer have them in my gear. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
5695122,Pat,2017-07-31 22:48:00,203,"We're headed up the 11th too for our first trip to Cedar too. Hope things pickup before then, always like a good first impression!"
5695154,prov1800,2017-08-01 03:13:00,5010,Fishing will pick up eventually.it always does.going out early again this morning.weather is cooling off starting today so fishing will srart getting better in a couple of days.
5695258,SWM08,2017-08-01 06:11:00,10,"Yeah we leave for cedar September 1st, I hope it does pick up by then . If the walleye fishing remains slow, how about the perch and crappie? We love doing the shore lunch thing and would feel better if those species were easier to find for our shore lunch fish. I assume the smallmouth fishing has still been good? Thanks"
5696530,prov1800,2017-08-01 17:01:00,5010,Perch are biting.not really after them.dont like eating worm in them.caught some walleyes today.still slow.September will be good fishing.
5699186,SinOrSwim,2017-08-03 08:17:00,1528,"Well, let's hope they are really hungry this next week."
5700042,prov1800,2017-08-03 14:52:00,5010,We went out today early again 5:30.seemscevery day this week we have good luck early.today again we did good on some deep structure around 20 ft.6:30-7:00.it would slow down already.bounced around here and there and picked up a few mire fish.id take my guts back into some weedbeds that i know and drop shot and todayvdidcreal good.its definately improvingvsince last week.i cast for muskies today whilecmy guests caught walleys and had a goodcwindow.bad thing was i had 4 big fish on and lost all 4.lol.
5701218,SinOrSwim,2017-08-04 07:21:00,1528,5:30????? c'mon! LOL Not sure I want to get up that early and really not certain I could get my kids up that early.
5701802,prov1800,2017-08-04 12:56:00,5010,Haha.thats up to you matt.mornings were good.not many people in camp catching.
5670234,SWM08,2017-07-17 19:47:00,10,We leave for Cedar lake in 46 days! I have heard some poor reports from Perrault lake but not a whole lot about cedar! Anybody been to Cedar lately and done well with the walleye? This will be our first trip to cedar lake and we are going the first week of September and getting a little concerned ! Thanks
5671314,wallydave,2017-07-18 09:39:00,2151,"I'll be there in September too! Interested in any fishing and road reports! We will be driving my wife's car, reports of getting tar on the vehicles won't be well received!"
5673314,Plotman,2017-07-19 07:04:00,394,"We are there right now!! Wish I could paint a pretty picture but, its been pretty slow for everyone in camp. The biggest shock to me is how crowded it is especially, on the better known areas. We have 3 in the boat and are new to the lake however, even those who have been coming here for years seem to be struggling. Plenty of smallmouth and perch to keep things fun enough as well as a few pike mixed in. Water temps 68-71 walleyes caught anywhere from 6-18ft around weeds and rock with both live and artificial baits. Saw a 27 1/2"" walleye get caught although are biggest so far was 21"" both of which are still swimming."
5673794,Guest,2017-07-19 11:44:00,0,"We will be on Cedar for a week starting on Saturday. The reports are not encouraging. I have been going there for 10 years, and we focus on Muskies with walleyes being secondary. I hope the Musky bite is on if the walleyes are slow."
5673818,walleyehunt13,2017-07-19 11:56:00,10,"I was there June 24th to the 30th. Muskie fishing seemed to be very good. We are beginners and did not fish them that hard. We caught 2, with 44 inches being the biggest. We also had 2 follows and missed two others."
5678026,prov1800,2017-07-21 13:01:00,5010,Just finished taking two guys out wed/thur.got one on wed.saw around 30 in the two days.so they are very active.probably could of had a few more if the figure 8 s had been better.most guys do them nice in practise but totally screw up at crunch time.lol.
5678186,skindzier,2017-07-21 14:08:00,137,"Count me in that group. I think I end up with the assumption that there's no fish following and then have to go into the 8 at the last minute when I see one so that it ends up awkward, maybe jerky with some slack. I think the key is making yourself believe that there's always a fish there, even after 200 casts without a sniff. Easy to say behind a keyboard. Harder when you're out there doing it..."
5678522,prov1800,2017-07-21 19:26:00,5010,Got to do it everytime.sometimes they come up from underneath the boat.orcif its wavy or dirty water you havecto do it.i tie 4 ft of leader line direct to my main line .so when i hear 4 ticks coming through my guides i go into a 8 nk mattercwhat
5694034,Guest,2017-07-31 11:27:00,0,"Just got back on Friday from Cedar. It was the toughest year we have had for walleyes (I have gone 8 out of the last 9 years). We only fish walleyes about 4 hours a day, and usually have no problem catching fish. However, we actually got skunked one day this year. We also didn't have enough fish to eat for one of the days we planned to eat fish. That had never happened to our group before. The amount of fish we marked on our electronics was amazing, but just couldn't get them to bite very often. When we did catch them, it was hard to find fish with any size. 19"" was the biggest caught in our group (6 guys for 6 days). The thing I found odd was that although all of the walleyes we caught were very healthy, almost none that we cleaned had anything at all in their stomachs. Musky fishing was OK, but not spectacular. And yes, you have to figure 8 every time. I have caught many more fish on the figure 8 at Cedar than away from the boat. And, keep figure 8ing if you had a follow. A 45"" followed my topwater this year, and followed one and a half figure 8's before disappearing. I didn't see him again until he came from under the boat and smashed the bait on the fifth time around."
5694554,prov1800,2017-07-31 15:38:00,5010,"I am guiding a couple of guests out of clarks.weather is in the 90,s and water temps are around 80 f by noon.fishing is about as tough as i have seen it.using all my experience to put fish in the boat.getting some as the day goes.went out at 5 am and that helped with our morning bite.coolercweather coming starting tomorrow then cooler yet through the week.ill see how tomorrow goes ascwe will go outvearly again.not many fish coming into camp."
