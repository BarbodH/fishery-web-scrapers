Fishing in that area is pretty good although this year was weird in that it was a few here, few there. Had to keep moving. A couple miles west is usually some pretty good fishing for eyes on reefs and around islands. Go east/ southeast a few miles past Hangingstone point and you will find some really good walleye fishing on reefs. I'm not a bass guy and don't target pike much, but there were lots off bass guys fishing that whole area during the FFBC when we were up. Never stayed at Camp Narrows, but if I'm correct, Tom owns the place and is a good stick. He'll help you out I'm sure. You might be getting up there around the time when the slab crappies start to school up, not sure. Tom could let you know. Biggest crappie of my life came from Shelter Islands....19""er. Hope it goes well for ya! Any questions feel free to ask and I'll help best I can. Eric"
