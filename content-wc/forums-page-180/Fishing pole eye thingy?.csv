5730785,BornToFish,2017-08-21 18:40:00,1224,"Greetings,You might want to post the question on the ""strictly fishing"" forum to open up a wider audience. I am not an expert in this field as I am not a rod builder.I believe the insert is often referred to as a line guide. These are often made of plastic or ceramic. These inserts sit in a wire frame. I don't know how these are made, but suspect that the line guides are not replaceable, as you might well break them trying to insert a new one.If my suspicion is correct, you might need to contact a rod builder to have the entire piece replaced. I believe this is a pretty straightforward endeavor for someone that knows how to do it and has the appropriate equipment. Alternatively, you might be able to send the rod to the manufacturer if you want the appearance of the complete rod to be unchanged.I will defer to others with more knowledge in this field.Kindest regards...."
5730817,bfish,2017-08-21 18:51:00,1096,It is all one piece. Mudhole dot com is could place to look for your specific model of guide and size.

5731505,U D,2017-08-22 06:43:00,249,It's called a rod guide.http://www.jannsnetcraft.com/fishing-rod-guides/Very easy to replace. You will have to buy the entire guide you cannot get just the wear insert. You should be able to get it very close though.
5734001,terrapin,2017-08-23 09:09:00,353,"I just had one replaced on my crank bait rod. A local guy did it for $10.00. He un-wraps the old guide, installs a new one and then re-wraps it. I'm sure it's an ""easy"" diy project, but for $10, I'm happy to support the local rod builder.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"

5736633,38bill,2017-08-24 15:23:00,331,They are called the guides. Ferrules are used at the connecting joints in a two piece rod.
5736857,kasmerelake,2017-08-24 17:29:00,2,"you need a new replacement guide, double foot, with same ring size and metallic finish. Unless your comfortable with this please go to local rod builder. This is how I got into rod building with a ""ring insert"" popping out on a Loomis casting rod in 08. Tight Lines"
5736873,kasmerelake,2017-08-24 17:33:00,2,Also if you use braid you need a high quality guide and insert. A quality guide can cost $10.00 or more. Cheap rings on guides will groove with line wear. Dont go cheap on a guide!! John
