5735537,Shellback,2017-08-24 07:09:00,8083,"If you are fishing where the lodge owner marked ""X"" on the map, and you don't expect company? I'm guessing more experienced fishermen would have moved on when the saw the spot occupied. But maybe these folks were rookies and didn't understand the unwritten courtesy."
5735577,fishmanric,2017-08-24 07:25:00,219,We were fishing Pine Point on Lac Seul this year when an armada of boats pulled in on us and started fishing. We packed up and left. All popular spots were pounded daily so we just ended up fishing our pre trip way points and all held fish. Never did pound them but caught enough to be satisfied.
5735593,Bstar,2017-08-24 07:29:00,564,I would expect company on Lac Seul that has several camps on it but not on a 20k acre fly-in lake with 3 cabins on it. I guarantee you they weren't rookies.
5735617,Multispecies Guy,2017-08-24 07:40:00,447,"Experienced or rookie, what makes some people think this sort of behavior is acceptable? To me it's like going on a picnic in a park where there are a dozen empty tables and sitting at the one that's already occupied. Or spreading a beach towel right next to another group with miles of empty beach. I can't attribute it to simply not knowing much about fishing, I attribute it to being a knucklehead in general."
5735641,pjshorthorn,2017-08-24 07:46:00,5654,"Whew !!!!!! When I read the title of the post, I thought BStar was talking about me ........ PjShorthorn"
5735929,Shellback,2017-08-24 10:01:00,8083,"So my brother is on a work trip to rural SD. He sits down at a local cafe to have lunch. A few minutes later another fellow walks in a sits at the same table. Then another couple fellows sit down also. So my brother, thinking he's interfering with a group, decides to ask if he should move. The fellows explain that the old woman running the cafe expects people to fill up one table first, before going to another. Said she wasn't running her butt off serving a bunch of different tables. What's this got to do with crowding a fishing hole? I don't know, but just because you think and feel different than others, doesn't make them ignorant, as the OP likes to think."
5736025,Bstar,2017-08-24 10:59:00,564,"lmao! Come to think of it, I do recall my brother saying the old guy had a striking resemblance to pjshorthorn!"

5732609,Wall-i-Lama,2017-08-22 14:15:00,1524,Careful now!
5732737,Ricky Spanish,2017-08-22 15:30:00,1298,"I'm sure if you took an informal poll at lodges in the same area, Chicago area visitors would place #1, followed by Minneapolis area, in being the most [insert any adjective], simply by higher population and expendable income levels in the Midwest. This goes for all the good adjectives, too. Lodge owners, like gord, are allowed to troll on here, too, right?"
5732913,v-bay gord,2017-08-22 16:39:00,3168,All guests with a sense of humour are welcome here at VBL......even those from Illinois!
5732969,Multispecies Guy,2017-08-22 16:57:00,447,Have you seen the Bears play in the last few years and heard the callers to sports talk radio shows in Chicago on Mondays? Not much of a sense of humor for most Chicagoans recently. Thank goodness the Cubs gave them something to be happy about.
5734465,emma17,2017-08-23 13:30:00,436,"On the other side of the crowding story, I had a great experience four years ago. We were camped at Abrahms Lake. Early our first morning I strolled into the office to ask about spots. As the words were coming out, the door opened and a father-son (older fellas) walked in and the camp owner said to me, ""ask them, they've been coming here for 20+ years."" I asked, and their answer was: ""Just follow us, we'll take you to all the spots"". I was dumbfounded. Come on I said, I can't crowd you like that. They laughed it off and insisted. Our first morning we caught our limit quickly, and as lunch hour came, they said, ""follow us, we're going to make shore lunch"". They did it all. We ended up fishing with them for three days on and off. I'll always be thankful to that group of guys. They were incredible fisherman and even better people."
5734993,drew59,2017-08-23 18:49:00,87,"More of this would be nice. If I see someone in camp struggling I try to help them (assuming I can!). There's enough fish for everyone. I only fish twice a year (both in Canada) so maybe I don't get the whole ""secret"" spots thing. It bothers me to see someone travel that far and have a lousy time because they aren't catching fish. Just be respectful. Say ""hello"" and help out. Make some new new friends."
5735009,HeHooksHimself,2017-08-23 18:58:00,725,One of my goals in going to Canada is solitude. Therefore I respect the space of others and would appreciate the same from them. A simple request is only being polite. I would never assume that others would embrace me encroaching on their spot. However a polite request might result in me embracing another person encroaching on me. Just sayin' Fish On! Hooks

5735513,Mike Borger,2017-08-24 06:56:00,1554,"That would have really bugged me, but knowing Miniss, I'd have left without saying a word and went to fish another spot. If it happened again at another spot, well then I'd have a polite conversation with them.One can only assume there was no real malice or intent to upset you guys, those guys almost certainly don't know any better."
5731985,v-bay gord,2017-08-22 09:28:00,3168,The whole point of flying in is to have a guarantee of some solitude and to not have to deal with crowds of idiots. I suppose the other group didn't have that expectation and were lonely for human contact. Either that or they were from Illinois..........
5732001,Ricky Spanish,2017-08-22 09:30:00,1298,"Gonna get me one of those. I live within 15min of Freemont, WI and roughly an hour from the Fox River and Winnebago chain. I never fish any of them because I'd rather ""fish"" in a bucket in my driveway than catch fish around dozens of other people. It never fails that one out of every dozen boats is loaded down with jerks being extremely rude or downright dangerous to others."
5732041,Bstar,2017-08-22 09:52:00,564,Hey now! I'm originally from Illinois. Lol! I'll just say they were from a state that borders Canada.
5732081,v-bay gord,2017-08-22 10:16:00,3168,"Did the boat have ""AML"" on the side?"
5732089,Ricky Spanish,2017-08-22 10:26:00,1298,"Ha! Me, too. And to gord's point, THE BIGGEST TOOL I've ever met in Canada was a guy whose name rhymes with Lanny Furbeck. What a punk he was in the bar at Temple Bay."
5732121,law57,2017-08-22 10:48:00,1147,"Yes - I had two guys do that to me too. They had followed me around all week. One day they came up and asked if I mind if they drop their anchor. I was slowly backtrolling the spot - very rocky - it's easier to get a snag back if your anchor isn't on the bottom. That was really a good spot - nice fish in the 20-28"" class all week long. So I know how you feel. But on a 20000 acre lake, I'd just move to another spot. I know lots of guys like to catch numbers of fish. I'm in it for two things - finding them myself and finding the biggest walleyes I can catch. I'll keep moving to do those things. Sometimes you find fish where you don't expect them. For example - they aren't on the big rock pile today. They are 40 feet off to the side - where there's no snags. I see it as 'catchers' and 'fishermen'. When the kids used to go along we'd fish spots where they could load the boat - no skill there. Walleyes are easy to catch when you find them. But they aren't always easy to find. That's were (I think) the fun comes in.Just move on and enjoy your trip. You traveled a long way and spent a lot of money. Don't let things get in your way of having fun."

5732297,Bstar,2017-08-22 11:35:00,564,"What's ""AML""?"
5732329,Bstar,2017-08-22 11:45:00,564,"I agree with you Law and there are always two ways to look at a story. We did most of our prospecting in the morning and then came in for a late lunch/early dinner. So it was nice to have a spot close by where we could count on some fish. It would have had a big issue if they followed me around all week. Like you said it's a 20K acre lake. Like I said it happened those two nights and we didn't run into them again so I take it that they got the message. I'm like you, I like to prospect for spots. Don't get me wrong I will try the spots that they marked for us knowing that they probably mark the same spots for every group but I will look for and find some spots that might hold more or better fish. It's the fun part of the game. That being said, I feel that I should not have to give up a spot because I'm being buffooned by an ignorant fisherman."
5731593,Bstar,2017-08-22 07:40:00,564,"So we drive 900 miles to Sioux Lookout and then fly another 70 or so to Miniss Lake with Slate Falls Outposts. We know SFO has two outposts on the lake about 3 miles apart. We are in the east cabin and the first evening we go to fish a reef that Ryan w/SFO had marked on the map for us. Now this spot was about a mile east from our cabin and produced a lot of fish for us during the week. So we are fishing that first evening and we are all catching and having a good time when three boats from the other cabin come buzzing in to fish the same spot! Now I don't know about everybody else but if I see someone fishing a spot that I want to fish I will just go find another spot to fish rather than crowd them on that spot. Now this lake has 20,000 acres of fishable water and there are several spots closer to the west cabin to fish. It was a calm evening so wind was not an issue. So we continue to fish, a little upset, without saying anything to these guys mainly because two of the boats had young boys in them. So the next evening we go back to the same spot. Again all of us are catching and again here comes a single boat from the other cabin with obviously grandpa and his two young grandkids. Now I'm all for teaching kids how to fish but fishing etiquette should be part of the equation. At about the time grandpa pulls up my brother lands a nice 19.5"" walleye. So grandpa proceeds to motor directly to my brothers' location and tells his grandson to drop the anchor and tries to strike up a conversation with my brother! Now he is literally close enough that he could have dropped the anchor in my brother's boat! At that point some comments started coming out of my mouth and I started taking video of the situation. No cussing was involved due to the kids being there but grandpa got the drift and had second thoughts about anchoring in that spot and decided to drift. Since we were backtrolling with bouncers at the time we just kept circling him until he got the message and moved about 50 yards away. Still too close in my mind but we let him be and he eventually left. Now we are a pretty easy going group with a live and let live attitude and we know nobody ""owns"" a fishing spot on a lake but to me there is an unwritten rule that you don't infringe on someone's spot until they leave it. What do you guys think?"
5731737,mjayn,2017-08-22 08:36:00,1188,"20k acres of water, not worth the worry. Honestly I would go fish the spots near the other camp. If they see you on the spot they will either come fish by you because they don't know where to go or fish the spot by your cabin because they were told to go there and don't have any interest in looking for new spots. Eitherway you can adjust and fish in peace. I learned long ago that I do not know the situation the other person it is. It is possible, even likely that the deekers are just idiots with no etiquette, but you never know, they could be dumping ashes on an dead fishermans favorite spot(this happened to me... right after yelling WTF, they started dumping the ashes)."
5731769,Ricky Spanish,2017-08-22 08:48:00,1298,"Ouch! I was also thinking it was likely that they had the same spot marked by the outfitter, and possibly didn't have the experience or knowhow to find another."
5731777,Hwy 101,2017-08-22 08:50:00,33,"Every camp I have been to marks up a map with some current location which leads to ""community spots"". I have had boats fish really close to me in similar situations which startled me at first. After a brief but polite conversation I found out that they had been struggling and just didn't know how to walleye fish or find good locations by looking at a map. They just didn't know better and didn't know how to ask for help. We told them to drop anchor right next to our marker and they proceeded to catch more walleyes in an evening than they had caught up to that point in their trip. It was very satisfying listening to them hoot and holler every time one of them netted a fish. I don't think I would have had an issue with an old guy with his grand kids on board. Now if some able bodied guys that feel they can get me to blink and bump me off a spot its game on."
5731785,Bstar,2017-08-22 08:52:00,564,"Yeah we ended up fishing some other spots further from the camp and really didn't run into them after that. I do know they mentioned it to the camp owner on a check flight and he pretty much told them that if somebody is on a spot to leave them be and that it's a big lake with a lot of spots. We did strike up a conversation with one of the guys that first night and they had fished the lake before. No, they weren't dumping ashes that I can guarantee. It didn't ruin our trip by any means."
5731817,WallyWarrior,2017-08-22 08:56:00,2488,"Kind of my thought. Using the same outfitter and not thinking that this scenario is possible is a bit crazy. The anchoring would upset me a bit, but the whole ""my spot"" thing is a bit of overreach in this situation. It's no more yours than any other community spot that is pointed out by the outfitter.

5731865,Bstar,2017-08-22 08:59:00,564,"The issue we had with the old guy was that he barged right in. Now if he would have said 'hey you guys mind if I fish this spot I'm trying to get my grandsons on some fish"" we would not have had any problem with it. And probably would have helped him out. Attitude is everything."
