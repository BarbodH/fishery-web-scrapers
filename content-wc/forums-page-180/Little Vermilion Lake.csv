We got chased off the lake because of lightening on Sunday afternoon, other than that Wed. it rained hard all day and the fish were very hungry. The numbers of fish and big pike was fantastic! 10 pike 38 to 41 inches, 11 pike 35 to 37 inches, and a bunch 26 to 34 inches. When pike fishing slowed the walleyes were on fire! Our final day we caught 105 pike and walleye. every other day 75 to 85 each day. My daughter, Crystal, equaled or beat her personal best pike 8 different times. 35 inches was her best, she caught 3-35 inch, a 35.5 inch, a 37 inch, a 38 inch, a 39.5 inch, and a 41 inch. She is quite the fisherperson! I got a bonus 29 inch walleye to boot! biggest of the year so far at Sportsman's! What a special week this was with my daughter."

5734673,eyegator,2017-08-23 14:54:00,29,"How are the numbers of walleyes on that lake? I'm looking for a place, and I like to catch enough eyes to eat for the day first thing, then look for big pike all day. My buddy would rather try to catch 100 eyes in a day, even if the biggest is 20-22inches-- is that possible there?"
5734793,Golden Eagle,2017-08-23 15:56:00,2642,"May 16, 2008 I had a couple of new guys fishing with me on Little Vermilion. Told them they could boat 100 walleyes a day. Attempting to prove me a liar, they stopped at head of 1st rapids and began counting walleyes. Lost count at 100 after only 60 minutes. When walleye bite went slow we'd lift our jig a couple of feet from bottom and sting a huge pike that had put the walleyes tight to the bottom to avoid being eaten.One of the guys on this thread is such a good catcher that he continued to hook walleyes on a bare jig head after losing his grub."
5734801,Golden Eagle,2017-08-23 16:00:00,2642,Good to bleed those walleyes and put them on ice as they like to spoil if you catch them early in the day and eat them that night. Why not wait until you're hungry and the sun is getting low in the sky before you fish for dinner. Or catch them off the dock while your partner is pealing potatoes.
5735433,rockape,2017-08-24 06:15:00,215,"I didn't think there were walleyes in there, or very few of them! Looks like I have a new lake to fish if that is the case."
5735441,rockape,2017-08-24 06:22:00,215,My bad. Different Little V. I was thinking of the one near Sioux Lookout.
5735497,Whopper,2017-08-24 06:52:00,340,"Perfect eaters are plentiful, can't guarantee 100 a day every day but if the conditions are right it's achievable. No need to bag eaters to begin the day, once located dinner can be caught on the way in at the end of the day. Pike fishing can be phenomenal"
5736209,eyegator,2017-08-24 12:35:00,29,Thanks everyone- it sounds like that it is nice numbers lake- which personally is all I need. Good idea on catching eyes at days end vs first thing. I will be sure to take a closer look at this place.
