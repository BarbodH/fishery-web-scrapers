Been fishing up there for just 12 years but have never seen this before. I just saw pictures from a post on Facebook that showed the nets that were not being tended and were full of dead fish. Such a same to see these fish go to waste. We had good overall fishing this year but did notice that the number of fish was down some and the frequency of larger fish was down quite a bit. Just hoping it was an off year, hoping that netting is not having a negative effect on fishing there."
5728825,That Minnesota guy,2017-08-20 20:04:00,8293,How could netting have a positive effect?
5728865,Wall-i-Lama,2017-08-20 20:20:00,1524,Perhaps I should have said an overall negative effect? I don't know how wide spread this is and it's a very big lake. That's what I posted this is to see if anyone else saw this? It might have been isolated to just one bay. Let's see what other have to say.
5728977,dschiebel,2017-08-20 22:17:00,85,We saw the same thing last year. We removed the nets to never be used again.
5730169,MN_Moose,2017-08-21 12:08:00,964,"We've noticed a negative affect on the fishing around Kenora. Smaller fish, less quantities fewer big fish. If we head way out south of the Barrier Islands it helps to improve results. I would guess that the people setting nets see the reduced effects also and moved to other areas accessed by roads. I would agree that nets go unattended. I caught a crank bait in a net that was out there a long time."
5730193,LOW1,2017-08-21 12:26:00,2828,I'm curious. Where around SN were the nets?
5730385,Lazy Fisherman,2017-08-21 14:03:00,276,"In years past, I have seen nets in Long Bay."
5730465,srk-low,2017-08-21 14:51:00,78,As of two weeks ago two nets were set up in the very eastern part of Regina Bay. They are about a 1/4 mile from the waterfall coming from Dogpaw Lake. Been all over Whitefish Bay and haven't seen any others this year.
5730689,Wall-i-Lama,2017-08-21 17:46:00,1524,"In western whitefish bay, near dinner island and Louis inlet.Others told me nets were in long bay also."
