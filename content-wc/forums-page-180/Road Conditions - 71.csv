5730697,jkretch,2017-08-21 17:50:00,80,Leaving Friday for Vemilion Bay. I see the 502 thread about conditions. How is 71? I don't mind a slight delay but the gravel on 502 would bother me as I'm towing a boat. Thanks in advance.
5731585,bigdaddyguns,2017-08-22 07:40:00,608,We drove 71 south last week from 17. There were three or so construction zones only one was active during that timeframe 630-8am. Wait time was a couple of minutes. Other than that delay it was clear and the road surface was in better condition than 502. Overall 71 is a better road for pulling a boat and I would take it over 502.

Even on it's worse day, 71 is a much better and safer road to travel versus 502. Love the fact that you travel through a few small towns just in case you need gas or have car problems."
