First let me tell you that Verne Hollett and Ryan at SFO are great to work with and the cabin and everything that goes with it is top notch. The boat slips with the hand railings are a welcome amenity for us older fisherman. The beds were real mattresses with box springs and were very comfortable. The kitchen was very well equipped with plenty of pots, pans dishes, coffee pots ,etc.. The covered porch had a new gas grille and a three burner fish cooker worked flawlessly. The cabin itself had plenty of room for our group of six. The bathroom, although somewhat small was more than adequate with a sink, shower and a flush toilet. There is an outhouse also. Everything is solar powered except for the stove which is propane. Verne also provided a small generator to use free of charge to power a CPAP but my brother decided he could go without it for the week so we wouldn't have to listen to the generator at night. We did use it to charge our phones and FF batteries though. The boats were 16' Alumarines that were a little tired looking but very stable. One of them had a slight leak. Motors were 15HP Hondas that ran all day and sipped fuel. Now for the fishing. Miniss Lake is a huge lake with hundreds of islands and channels to navigate. It can be intimidating at first look. It also has a lot of rocky outcroppings and reefs that you need to be aware of. I found an app for my phone that is very easy to use and was very accurate as far as hazards were concerned. It is Topo Maps Canada. The only downside is that it will only work with Apple Iphones. But it will take out all of the guesswork as to where you are at on the lake. I also had my Garmin handheld GPS with me but never used it. Ryan showed us some spots on the map before we flew in and they pretty much panned out. I had also contacted Mike Borger after his trip to Miniss last fall and he was kind enough to send me a digital marked map with over 20 spots marked. Thanks Mike! More on that later. You cannot possibly fish all of the areas on this lake in a week or for that matter in a lifetime. There are a ton of fishy looking spots. The beginning of the week we fished some spots fairly close to the cabin. We fished a numbers reef that Ryan had marked but most of the fish were on the smaller 15-17"" size with a few larger fish to keep our interest. I did catch a 41.5"" pike on a bottom bouncer there one evening. As the week went on we ventured further and further from the cabin. We went down to the southwest corner of the lake where Mike had marked an in flow creek with rapids tumbling into the lake but when we got there it was nothing but a trickle due to the low water conditions. So we spread out to check some spots that Ryan had marked and I went to check out a small island that had a nice hump on it to the north. We caught some really nice walleye in this area. They were some of the most vividly marked walleye that we have ever caught. Deep golden undersides and dark on top. We even caught a handful of blue walleye. And these fish were fat! There were some that were 20"" long that had to weigh 4-5 lbs. They were that thick. Although we never found any spots that produced all day long, we did catch fish on almost every spot that we tried. Our biggest were a pair of 25.5"" walleyes that my brother and his daughter caught. Pike were everywhere and mixed in with the walleye. Our bigs for the week were 41.5, 40, 38 and 34"" I caught the 41.5 on a bouncer. My neice caught the 38' on a bouncer and it was a very thick fish- we called it a Borger style pike. My nephew caught the 34 on a jig I believe. The highlight of my trip was on the last day. We had decided to wrap things up at 2:30 in the afternoon. We were fishing in the southwest end of the lake again and I decided I had to try trolling a Live Target Sucker in a narrow channel that Mike Borger had caught some large pike in the fall. As I got set up the clouds were building in the southwest and we heard a few claps of thunder so I knew we wouldn't have too much time left to fish. After about 15 minutes trolling in the center of the channel I got a hit and it turned out to be the 40""er. What a way to end a trip! That Live Target Sucker produced a fish everytime I used it during the week. From a walleye smaller than the bait to the 40""er. It's a great bait! All in all, this was our best fly-in trip ever. We tallied 971 fish caught during the week with many more that were hooked and lost. This is with a couple of newbies and my wife who is not an accomplished fisherman but likes to fish in Canada. We will be back!"
