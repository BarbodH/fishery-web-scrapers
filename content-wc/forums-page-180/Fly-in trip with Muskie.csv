5725273,Hovey,2017-08-18 12:15:00,7,"Hello, I am looking to book a fly in trip to Canada for next summer and this time I am looking for a lake with muskie. I am from Louisville, Kentucky and looking to keep my drive within 18 hours. I have found Confusion Lake with Wilderness Air Escapes, Kay Lake with Nestor Falls and Grant Lake with Gateway North. I was curious if anyone had any experience with these lakes and could give some input? Or if anyone knew any other lakes that fit the bill. I know monsters can be caught on some of the larger lakes but I do prefer being the only cabin on the lake (I know there are two on Kay), there is something about that feeling of solitude. Thanks for your help"
5725409,DeBo,2017-08-18 13:02:00,211,I do drive in trips to LOTW and the Winnipeg River for musky every year and have always wanted to try a fly in as I never have. There aren't a ton of options and you listed the ones I have looked into the most.Personally I would most like to go to Kay as it's a short flight from Nestor and the cabins look very nice.Has a reputation for big fish not numbers.Heard there are a couple other private cabins on the lake as well so I don't think it has the isolation you want.Kishkutena is one you didn't list that gets great reviews.Once again not a single outpost lake but a short flight from Nestor.Rowan is known to be world class but that is lodges and not outposts.The best place I know of besides this forum for outpost info is www.lineonfishing.comI believe the guy who runs that site posts on here occasionally.You can do a search for musky and a there are a fair number of options that I didn't know about before finding that site.There are also a few lodges on big lakes that have access to some numbers lakes that might interest you as well. Since you probably have 0 desire to haul your boat to Ontario from Kentucky I'd say a fly in is a great option.Let us know how it goes!

You'll have more bigger water options and you can still get that remote experience.If it were me, I'd strongly consider boat-in camps on lakes like Lake of the Woods, Eagle Lake and Lac Seul. There are some fly-in camps on Lac Seul as well (http://andersonslodge.com/, http://www.pickerelarm.com/lac-seul.html)."
5725729,Ricky Spanish,2017-08-18 15:35:00,1298,Eagle Lake Island Lodge is a boat in camp. Nice place and a chance at some big muskies in that area. Lindner did a show out of there a year or two back that you can see on Youtube.
5726225,fishpoop,2017-08-18 22:40:00,630,http://www.alexandersonrowanlake.com/http://www.rowanlakelodge.com/I've not been to either camp so have no personal first hand experience. Alexanderson is new to me as I've never heard of it before. Rowan Lake Lodge has been around for many years. Both are fly in operations as there is no road access to Rowan LakeRowan Lake is well known for trophy muskies.

5729537,Hovey,2017-08-21 08:49:00,7,Thanks for all the input everyone. I will have to research the boat in trips some. My dad is going with me again and he went to Canada in college for muskie but never boated one so I am really wanting to find a place I can make that happen. We have been on one fly in trip to a pike/walleye lake and really enjoyed the experience and being away from everything but the fishing wasn't great. I was hoping to find the same experience but with slightly better fishing. Thanks again I really appreciate all the advice.
