5737873,wallydvr41,2017-08-25 12:07:00,5,I knew Hubert and trudy well. Yes the water has cleared. And fishing is ok. The walleye have a lot of restrictions now. No minnows live or dead allowed. Huberts nephew i think now runs the old farm. http://www.pourvoiriefern.com/?lang=enThis is where i stay now. Great people right in Duparquet. I go for bear every other year. https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...7327b70a9f.jpgSent from my SM-G935V using Tapatalk
538751,Jim Heiss,2004-04-11 10:12:00,4,I use to fish this lake back in the late 70's when I was only 18 years old I remember it was a very good fishing lake then. I don't remember the name of the came we stayed at thought. If anyone has info on the name of the camp and if it still exist today. And also if this lake is still a good fishing lake? Anyone with info on this lake would be greatly appreciated.

An alternative would be Lake Wetetnagami who list here on the business directory which I can recommend.http://www.wetetnagami.com/en/accueil.html

2826761,Guest,2014-05-23 04:08:00,0,"I am headed up to Lac Duparquet tonight. The walleye and Northern pike fishing is as good as its ever been. We have been staying at the same camp every year for 40 years. Years ago it was called Hubert's Vacation Farm, but nowadays his grandson has taken over and it is now called Pourvorie du Portage. Yes there are many reasons why we keep coming back, value and hospitality being at the top. Over the years we have pulled out many good size walleye and northerns and have never failed to get our limits to take home. Our top trophies include a 46"", a 42"", a 41"" and too many high 30"" Northern Pike to count, Walleye get big here too, with my personal best being a 28"" that I have mounted. I hope someone sees this as i would love to share this wonderful Lake."

5737849,FishManMAV,2017-08-25 11:38:00,1,"My dad, uncle and cousins used to stay at Hubert's Vacation farm. Hubert and his wonderful wife Trudy. There was a sauna that Hubert would fire up twice during the week, he always held one night for a gathering where he would cook something, fish, bear whatever was in his freezers. I remember the first time my dad took me, I was about 17....thats the beginning of my transformation from the know-it-all kid to ""my dad is cool"" and I really loved being around him. That was the beginning of our family traveling there 4 more times until the mid 1980s that's around when the water turned to a brownish rust color, unfortunately the quality of the fishing dropped so we never returned.Has the water cleared up so you cans see the bottom again? And is the fishing there as great as it used to be? Let me know because I'd love to return."
