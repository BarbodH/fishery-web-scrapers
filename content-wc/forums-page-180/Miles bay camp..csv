We caught over 400 walleyes around 40 smallmouth 4 big crappies and a few peach with a couple of snot rockets. Biggest walleye was 24"" cast for muskies a couple days had 3 follows. One was in the upper 40 inch range. The KBI bass tournament was going on. One of the boats in the KBI blew his motor by horseshoe island. We pulled them up to firebag island so they could catch a ride back up to Kenora. Had a good time with Matt Jenn and Alicia. Thanks too everyone in camp. Had some real nice folks in camp that was willing to help in any way. Nice to meet people like them. Oh and thanks Jenn for the cake. It was awesome. Looking forward too next year."

The kids caught a lot of fish right off the dock. The kids also had a great time playing with Matt and Jenn's kids and they said next year ""we should go for two weeks'. Fishing was good once we got the hang of finding the right spots. Plenty of action and great shore lunch spots. Great fun vacation."
