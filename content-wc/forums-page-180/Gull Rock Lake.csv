For those that have been up that way before, do you recommend going in to Red Lake to buy bait? And are crawlers still effective in early September? Many thanks in advance!!"
5738561,martinbns,2017-08-26 06:05:00,1520,I was up there last year all be it in August and on the recommendation of the Camp owner we used minnows exclusively. I did pick up some leeches in Red Lake but they were ineffective. Does your camp have bait?
5738649,ace,2017-08-26 07:36:00,10,We go up every year and stay at Golden Hook. They have plenty of bait at reasonable prices. Minnows are all we ever use but they have worms and Leeches as well. Gullrock is a great lake to fish and Keith will tell you some spots. You won't have to go far to find fish. Jigs and Lindy rigs is all you'll need for eyes. Suicks for the pike. I'll be up next week 9/1. Looks like the temps are gonna drop a bit so it should be really good.
