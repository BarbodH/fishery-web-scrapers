5693922,Guest,2017-07-31 10:51:00,0,"Well, we made it. Departed roughly 5-1/2 hours later than usual, which cut my nap time at Anchor Lake down significantly. After a blink of a snooze, continued to I-Falls, hitting the border about 30 minutes later than usual. 15 minutes and we were through. Brakes got done--after many very creative phrases were coined, questioning the lineage and mental capacity of the fine folks that designed the caliper pins on my truck--but the pilot supply line didn't survive the damage from the aforementioned lovely and talented wife. She had to order parts (went with the whole burner assembly, not just the line), and I wasn't waiting around until Tuesday for them to arrive. I left very detailed instructions (and hinted that she might just want to call a service guy), but even though the parts arrived Monday--and despite yeoman effort on her part--the second sentence out of her mouth when we got back into cell-phone-service-area was ""the water heater still doesn't work."" (The first sentence came in the form of a question: ""who is this?"") As it turns out, the natural-gas powered water heater works better if you open the gas valve. She successfully installed everything, which was kind of impressive. -42"

5723922,Bayou,2017-08-17 20:09:00,52,Roughly 14 hours and our group will be off to Minniss Lake with Slate Falls Outposts. Can't wait as I've really been looking forward to this one.

5661826,clegg,2017-07-13 06:15:00,38,12 hours from now we'll be on the road heading up to Clova. Air Tamarac will be picking us up tomorrow morning at 7:30 and we'll be heading up to Hebert. part of the fun is driving through the night in the trail.

Actually, tomorrow night we sleep at the Falls Motel. Eat dinner at the Thunderbird Lodge, then Saturday cross over. A nice breakfast at the Harbourage in Fort Frances, a quick stop at Safeway, The Beer Store and a few souvenirs in town for the kids and we'll be golden! CANNOT WAIT!!!!!"
5675450,Guest,2017-07-20 09:15:00,0,"Just under 24 hours from our scheduled departure. Sleep in the truck at the Anchor Lake rest area tomorrow night, cross the border bright and surly Saturday, a quick stop at Four Seasons in Ear Falls to pick up crawlers and licenses and then a short hop to the launch on Red Lake. I say ""scheduled departure"" because my life seems to really hate me. Last night, brakes started squealing on the way home from work. Not driving 2k miles like that, so I have a brake job to do. Walk in the door and the lovely and talented wife informs me that the dryer ""doesn't work."" Looks like I need to replace the thermocouple. This morning, no hot water in the shower: water heater pilot light won't stay lit. Probably another thermocouple. ""Luckily,"" the aforementioned wife found a youtube video about water heater thermocouple replacement...and decided to give it a whirl while I'm driving to work. More accurately, while I'm sitting dead still in traffic, still a bit irritated by the surprisingly cold shower I took. Great time to be getting the phone calls about the hexagon shaped thingy that holds the other thingy in place, and which L-shaped thingy with the stick she should use. At this point, what I know is that she was able to remove the plate that seals the burner chamber, and the two control lines from the gas control valve...but bent the pilot supply tube trying to take the gas line off. What I don't know is (a) what kind of a mess I get to deal with when I get home and down to the basement (after the brake job), and far more importantly (b) what time we'll actually get to leave for a week of much-needed escape at BBL. At some point, I should probably pack and get the boat ready, too... -42"
5675514,pjshorthorn,2017-07-20 09:28:00,5654,"Look at it this way, all this stuff could have come up while you were halfway way to BBL. All the stuff like this at my home always happened when I was traveling. Take her one step at the time and you will get them all done before taking off tomorrow. You may not get any sleep,but you will get them done. Travel safe and have a great time with your son in that new boat. I look forward to hearing about how you guys do. Don't forget to fish the mouth of Biron Bay up in Pipestone if there is a NW wind. Lots of big submerged boulders at the entrance so be careful. Good jigging spot you can drift. Ask Jim about it for more details. PjShorthorn"
5677050,wallydave,2017-07-21 05:31:00,2151,"After all of that stuff you deserve a week off at the lodge! Say hi to the ""J crew""! Have you ever tried a Friday night border crossing? Most of my early trips North were early spring trips, crossing Friday always saved hours of waiting, this time of year it might not be so crowded! Any safe travels, catch a couple for me, have a good time away from all the stress! Pat and I are thinking about a return trip to BBL!"
5677578,emma17,2017-07-21 09:14:00,436,"4t2I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing with you. I felt your pain reading that laundry list of challenges. Loved the ""thingy"" conversation. Big credit to your wife for giving it a go. I hope it all works out for you. As PJ said, cross them off the list one at a time.Our countdown is 5 days, 5 hours until we head up to Obabikon for 4th straight year. We stop in Duluth for the night."
