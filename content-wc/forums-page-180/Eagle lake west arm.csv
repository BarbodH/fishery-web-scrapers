5727009,eyeboom,2017-08-19 15:52:00,940,Nice fish John. It appears your refresher course was a success!
5727057,prov1800,2017-08-19 17:37:00,5010,Yes it was and refreshing to see sights again.it is quite nice there.
5727529,ToxicAngler,2017-08-20 05:52:00,30,"Back before the economy crashed a group of us would stay at Kimberly's Eagle West and exclusively fished the west arm. Many a good fish caught that way including some dandy muskies. I always enjoyed our portage trips to Trout & Brown trout lakes. It would be the last week of September and the water would be cooling off just enough for the Lakers to be shallow in the mornings. We'd wake up at O'dark thirty and begin the day long adventure, portaging through 3 lakes, (if I remember correctly), to get to the Rocky shoreline that held the spunky trout. Really good times!"
5728681,prov1800,2017-08-20 19:05:00,5010,Did the guide trip today.great guests and some pretty good fishing also.lots of slot fish again which the boys enjoyed catching.got a few smallmouth and amazedcat the number of rock bass today.very windy today so that did limit us to spots fished.found fish pretty steady in 15-20 ft.jigs and minnows worked well as did lindy rigs.
