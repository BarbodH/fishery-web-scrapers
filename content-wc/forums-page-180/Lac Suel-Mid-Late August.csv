5727265,lazermule,2017-08-19 20:39:00,86,"I was thinking about making another trip in mid September, what's the bite like on Lac Suel then? Thanks, LM"
5727481,prov1800,2017-08-20 04:44:00,5010,In my book the bite on lac suel is always good no matter what time of the year.definatly in mid September its real good.
5729577,fishingMN4eyes,2017-08-21 09:25:00,108,Will be headed up to the Ear Falls area in a week. Any updates between now and then would be greatly appreciated!
5736441,fishingMN4eyes,2017-08-24 14:13:00,108,Bump.
5736865,ToxicAngler,2017-08-24 17:30:00,30,I'll be up there also fishingMN4eyes. Looking forward to slaying some eyes! I would appreciate some sort of report also. Sounds like the bite is picking up. Where you staying? We'll be at Lac Seul Lodge
5736969,jakeman,2017-08-24 19:48:00,32,Fished out of Lac Seoul Lodge two weeks ago and have fished the area for years. Hired a guide for two days to learn more of the lake and spent a day out of Deception. Both were a waste of time and money. Hit the Mill and drown some crawlers with pink spinners. Use your electronics and jig some plastics on the obvious structure. Don't be scared to check shallow in the west facing nooks if the water starts to cool. PS. The Anderson guides are douches. Make sure you roll some wake at them in their little tiller boats!
5701418,bus33,2017-08-04 08:57:00,289,We just got back and found the ticket was pulling spinners of various colors tipped with minnows or leeches. We were finding the best fish on flats in 17 fow @ 1.0 mph. We also found fish in Sawmill in 5-8 fow pulling spinners. The weather for us went from 90's to 60's and everything in between so we had to work a little harder to find the fish.
5702042,thomas_o_rourke,2017-08-04 15:37:00,8,We are staying at the main camp area just south of Sioux Lookout.
5713162,KC Walleye,2017-08-10 23:07:00,274,"Would love some new reports.....we are currently driving from KC to Onaway. It's midnight and almost time for a nap. Lol. Looking forward to some good reading when I awake. Post up peeps.....please. Thanks, KC"
5713370,prov1800,2017-08-11 07:02:00,5010,"this report would be from last Monday when I took my fish out for a day.put my boat in at scout bay.all islands in nash bay held lots of fish in the 17-20 ft range.the shanty area was also very good and a few of my secret rock piles.lol.did still find lots of fish in front of and in weed beds.we did have a great day with lots of fish and 4 real big ones.both had forgot our phones so no pics.2-30inch and 2 -28 inch.figured that would happen,lol.was a nice CALM DAY.weather has been stable and looks to stay that way so I suspect fishing will very good."
5715346,btyreprich,2017-08-12 12:59:00,1067,"We left the lodge yesterday and are now back at home. Fishing ended up for,our group,on a very strong note. Multiple fish both in the slot and over! Personal best was a 6.1 lb Walleye. We found the fish in deeper water - 25 to 30 feet - and a simple jig head and minnow is all it took. I even tried a Sassy Shad on my jog head and managed to catch fish. Next year we'll have to make the trip in June due to a number of work & school conflicts for our group. In later part of a June - I hope the fishing is as good then as it has been for us in early part of August out of the Ear Falls area."
5715714,KC Walleye,2017-08-12 21:37:00,274,"Our first day on Lac Seul. Fished mainly south western islands down by Indian island area. Caught fish all day in 20-30 FOW. Caught some on jigs and minnows but big jigs with big plastics were the hot ticket. Plastics outfished live bait probably 3:1 if not more and fish were much larger also on the plastics. Biggest was 27"" today so tomorrow we go in search of some bigger fish. Hopefully everyone else is having some luck. Tight lines. KC"
5718338,lazermule,2017-08-14 21:31:00,86,"Just returned today, fished the 11th, 12th and the 13th. We were on the east end in the Deception Bay area and Loon Rapids. Just about any hum in 17-22 FOW we caught fish. Did catch a good one in 7 feet though when my son was casting for pike. My wife figured she'd keep jigging and pulled up a 15 1/2"" incher. Got a few 21 and 22"" and a number of small ones but ended up with a limit of real nice fish and a few nice smallies.Have fun, be safe...and don't be like the guy that came right by me (like 25 feet) and started fishing. With 640 square miles of water that shouldn't happen.LM"
5725769,KC Walleye,2017-08-18 16:33:00,274,"Well our trip is over and we are driving back to Kansas City. I will give a quick synopsis of what we found or learned in or time up there. Another big kudos to Blair and Cathy at Onaway Lodge, another year of wonderful accommodations and service. First class people and operation. Met a fellow Walleye Central member in camp when we were there. Clint, from Illinois, great to meet you and best wishes to you and your Dad in future endeavors.Fishing was pretty typical for August on Lac Seul. We drove South every day except one morning. We fished mainly around the Indian Island area and north of that on sand flats and rock reefs and islands. We found that when fish were contacted in the morning they were more responsive to big plastics and aggressive tactics. Afternoons the bite became a bit slow at times and fish were best taken with slower tactics such as vertical jigging rock/sand transitions or slow trolling floating jigs with minnows behind a bouncer. Fish found in usual depths. All in all was a great trip and many nice fish caught, we have never caught so many fat 23-25"" fish, but the 28+"" eluded us. Onaway Lodge again is highly recommended. Tight lines y'all,KC"
5726113,KC Walleye,2017-08-18 20:29:00,274,"I should clarify.....I was not meaning to bash Silver Water Wheel. They seemed to do a great job on getting their clients on fish. I shouldn't let a few instances taint the lodge's great reputation or guide fleet image. We did have a very pleasant conversation with one of their guides while he backtrolled by us. Their boat was ecstatic because it had just boated a 28.5"" Walleye, and were fist bumping and taking pics before a successful release. The guide was very pleasant and talkative when we asked how big the fish was. Also, if anyone wants any additional information on fishing spots or tactics we used, please PM me l, as I don't want to post anymore after reading back today's earlier post."
5726753,prov1800,2017-08-19 11:34:00,5010,Most of there guides arent local guys. Most are hired on from southern ontario.so that might explain their actions.good guides wouldnt have to crowd you out they would just move on to the next spot without creating a scene.always makes me wonder with so much water around. Glad you had a great trip and you enjoyed our awesome country.
5687138,thomas_o_rourke,2017-07-27 10:45:00,8,"We are heading up to Lac Suel for the first time and fishing with Anderson's Lodge. Any thing to keep in mind while we do? Any advice, and as always, hows the fishing?!?!?!?!"
5687370,lazermule,2017-07-27 12:18:00,86,Making my 2nd trip this summer August 10-14th so I'll try to get back on here with a report. I'm camping at Abrams and trailering to the Deception Bay landing. LM
5694482,mwh624,2017-07-31 15:14:00,183,Mid lake humps and wind blown points (22-32 FOW if I had to guess) should treat you well.
5695490,Lake Wisconsin,2017-08-01 07:41:00,1960,I was there a few weeks later than you (last week in Aug) and current was key - so think of wind blow areas and narrow spots in the lake. Don't be afraid to go shallow either. Our best spot was in 5 fow.
5695506,Lake Wisconsin,2017-08-01 07:47:00,1960,...
5697402,thomas_o_rourke,2017-08-02 08:03:00,8,Thanks for the info!
5697898,pjshorthorn,2017-08-02 10:54:00,5654,Where are you staying on Lac Seul with Anderson's ? I might be able to help you with spots to consider fishing. PjShorthorn
5698098,lazermule,2017-08-02 12:21:00,86,Just got a tip from a friend that just returned yesterday that crawlers were the key for them. Had more minnows than crawlers and wished it were the other way around as the crawlers were HOT and they caught little to nothing on minnows. They were around Vaughn Lake area. LM
5698106,KC Walleye,2017-08-02 12:22:00,274,"I will be at Onaway Lodge from August 11-18. We will be fishing Main lake areas out in and around McKenzie Bay Area and branching out accordingly based on reports and success and such. That time of year you can find fish in all depths still but we usually concentrate our jigging effort a bit deeper, 15-30 feet typically but sometimes shallower. If fish are shallow we like to cast cranks for them. We usually jig minnows and cast cranks 99% of the time so we don't do much dragging around of crawlers or anything, but that always works well also. I will try and post some reports when up there if camp wifi is good. Best of luck to you."
5700474,nelsonj,2017-08-03 18:55:00,1,just returned today. Put boat in at the Lost Lake (near Hudson) landing. Weather was HOT until this past Tues. We did well besides the heat. Best luck was along weed lines in 8-12 FOW. Mainly troll with crawlers and minnows.
