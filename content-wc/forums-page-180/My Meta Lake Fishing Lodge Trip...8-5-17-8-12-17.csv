5723562,Juls,2017-08-17 17:07:00,13414,"Meta Lake Blog....Pretty long read...Sorry! This year, my regular fishing partner Steve, couldn't come, due to vacation time already used, and Frank's regular fishing partner Bill couldn't come, due to having two new hips and two new knees installed, so Frank invited me to fish with him, and I gladly accepted. We left Friday Morning at 4am, August 4th. Frank Parzinski and his brother, Bob, rode with us. We stopped at Tony's Restaurant in Birch Run, MI for breakfast on my recommendation, and the guys loved it. As usual, the size of the meals was ridiculously large!The border crossing took about an hour, due to traffic, but we had no issues going through. It was amusing though, because after the agent looked at my passport, he looked up and stared at me, for what felt like a long time...then, he finally looks back at my passport and back at me again, and says, ""Julia Davis...that sounds familiar...there's a “Juls” on “Walleye Central” that used to fish tournaments and write articles..."" I smiled and said, ""That would be me."" My truck mates laughed, and the very nice agent chatted a bit and asked where my boat was? I told him it wouldn't fit on the plane. He told us to have a great time and wished us good luck fishing, and sent us on our way. We never stopped for lunch, but did stop in Longnac, ON for dinner. It would only be another 45 minutes to Nakina from there. We arrived the Leuenburger Apts at 9:30pm. Everyone passed out pretty quickly, so we could leave by 5:30 the next morning to catch Leuenburger’s float plane to the lake.We arrived at Meta Lake Saturday morning to a warm cozy lodge, and our happy hosts, John and Cheryl. They had a breakfast of scrambled eggs, sausage, toast, and hot coffee waiting for us, while all of our equipment and luggage was delivered to our cabins by Erin, Trevor, Dawn, and Doug (the lodge staff for this season).After breakfast, I went down to our cabin, while the rest of my clan finished their breakfast, and talked over coffee. I brought all our luggage in off the porch and put them in our different rooms. Then, I started putting some gear in the boat, after finding out which dock we had, and which boats we had to choose from. It wasn't long before they came down and everyone was ready to go fishing!Saturday....(day 1)There's a cold front coming through and a full moon at night, so I'm not expecting any great ""catching"", by any means. Not like we have had in the past anyway. If Steve were here, he and I would skip breakfast the rest of the week, because it's not served until 7:30 in the morning, and we would be down on the South end of Ara Lake by the time the sun came up…( to try and cash in on an early morning bite.)But, I can't ask Frank to do that...not with his health restrictions, so we'll have breakfast, and just enjoy the fishing for what it is up here in beautiful Ontario, and enjoy the experience. Who knows if he'll ever make it up here again...so, this trip is all about making it memorable for him.Frank and I went to the north end of Ara on Saturday, and caught a handful of pike...nothing big though. I commented on how the sky was darkening and raining in the distance, and asked him if he wanted to go in and try to outrun it...he said, ""Yes, let's do that"". We made it back to the dock with a couple minutes to spare before the sky let loose and a heavy downpour commenced. He and I played Rummy 500 and sipped on Crown Royal manhattans until Frank and Bob came back in. They said they went to the north end of Ara to stay dry, and it worked.Dinner was at 6pm and consisted of an artisan lettuce salad, baked chicken legs and thighs, cauliflower, and a wild rice pilaf...with an apple cake drizzled with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream for dessert...Yummy!!!Sunday (day 2)Breakfast was at 7:30 and was French toast and bacon. Meal time is when Capt's Bob and Ned Boytim join us, so we can hear their fishing adventures each day too. Bob and Ned live in Marblehead, OH and charter on Lake Erie too. We all headed out on the water by 8:30. This time Frank and I headed to the south end of Ara, to fish the big weed bed. The water levels are down about 3 feet this year, so things are definitely different. We followed a trail I still had in my GPS app from last year to mark the four corners of the weed bed, and then started to troll and drift cast it, and the rest of the south bay area, the rest of the day. Bob Boytim caught a 39 1/2 inch brute on his first cast down there, but he and Ned would only catch a total of 24 fish the rest of the day. But, that was still better than what Frank and I would do the rest of the day too. We only caught maybe a dozen fish all day, along with many ""follows"". It was still a good time, and the weather was fantastic! We came back in at 4pm, played some cards, and had a cocktail, before heading up to the main lodge for dinner. Dinner was grilled pork loin, roasted Brussel Sprouts with bacon and walnuts, and rosemary roasted potatoes...with vanilla ice cream with a fresh tart raspberry sauce on top for dessert…Yummy!!After dinner, Cheryl and I took the canoe out for a ride along the shoreline with her dog Philson. You'll see him in the pictures. He's a Full blooded Chow and even has the blue/black tongue they are known to have. We stopped and sat on a big rock and sipped margaritas while the group of 5-6 Loons serenaded the sunset with their soulful calls. It was quite magical, and I'm feeling very fortunate that I got the chance to experience that memory. Monday (Day 3)I'm was up at 4am...and, decided to write this blog. I made a couple pots of coffee, and I'm quietly sipping some, while my cabin mates still sleep. It's almost 6am now, and the sky is beginning to lighten. At 6:30 I'll go up to the lodge for an hour to see if I can stream my Game of Thrones episode on my Amazon video. I hope it works! (update…it didn’t work!)I think Frank wants to drive the boat today, but I'll try and talk him out of it... he's not moving very well, and I think it will be easier on him if I just do it. I didn't realize how spoiled I was the past 3 trips up here when Steve did all the driving. Wish I had my Ranger 621 up here, because putting along at 15.4 mph with these little 15hp tillers is crazy slow! Ha! Fun...but, slooooow. We had ""eggs to order"" with home made bread/toast, hash browns, and homemade sausage for breakfast, and it was delicious!After breakfast, we headed back to the cabin to get ready to head out on the water. Frank wanted to drive today, so I obliged, and sat in the front. I told him, to go wherever he wanted to go, so he took us over to the south end of Ara Lake again. We trolled all his memories, and areas he knew from past trips up here, (which are very similar to mine) and caught some nice pike, but nothing big. We hit Stoney Bay too, and cast the weeds to add a few more to our total. We headed in around 3pm to relax and play some cards before dinner. The menu tonight was sliced roasted turkey breast, mashed potatoes and gravy, yummy roasted carrots in a butter sauce with sautéed sweet onions....with a ""butter tart"" thingy with raisins for dessert...Yummy!Tuesday (Day 4)This morning we had the ""eggs to order"" again, with bacon, fried taters, and homemade bread/toast. It was my turn to run the boat, but Frank requested that we head to the north end of Ara Lake today...I nodded in agreement…We trolled from the point above ""Walleye Ally"" to the islands, and back around again. We worked the whole area around the islands too, and only picked up two fish all morning. There were fish showing up on the sonar that the boat was fitted with, so we knew they were there.... they just didn't want any of our limited offerings today.We have a high pressure system over us right now, along with a full moon, and last night we had some pretty good rains and thunderstorms (lots of lightning) too, so there's that...but, it is what it is, and no one here is complaining! We headed to the channel after lunch and trolled the entire length of it. We picked up a total of 5 pike and 3 walleye today, before heading in to have a beer and to play cards again before dinner.Tonight's dinner was spaghetti with meat sauce, garlic bread, and lemon meringue pie....Yummy!Wednesday (Day 5)Breakfast was an egg bake, with homemade toast.Frank and I headed out at 8am and headed to the south end of Ara Lake again. It rained overnight again, but cleared out by breakfast. The wind was out of the WSW at 7mph, so the ride was a little bumpy only when we got over to the main lake area on Ara, and headed south.I steered the boat to the main lake point on the left side of the bay at the bottom of Ara, to see if there was anything hanging out there this morning...there was, but they were only walleye. We caught 5 of them, before getting far enough in the bay to get off the shoreline, and out to the weed beds to troll for pike.We had our best day so far this week, and caught a total of 21 fish. A very weak number compared to past trips up here, but we were very happy with that. I always say, ""I love to fish...catching is just a bonus"". Some sportsmen will know how I feel, and other people who fish, will have no clue, because it's all about size and numbers to them. Anyway, it was a great day in my book, and Frank agreed.I ended the day, by taking Frank to a spot Steve would take me to towards the end of each day, because the wind was right for it, and I could make the perfect drift there with Frank in the front of the boat. (He is limited to only facing the starboard side of the boat with his disabilities). After a half a dozen casts to a weed bed I had pointed out to him, he had a big pike hit his spoon 5 feet from the boat. After playing it for a bit, I helped him land a nice 36"" Northern. I didn't get a picture, because it needed to get back in the water quickly, and my phone was on the other end of the boat...sigh!We got back in to play cards and have a cocktail, before heading up to the lodge for their Wednesday night walleye fish fry.Thursday (Day 6)We enjoyed a breakfast of blueberry pancakes and sausage, then headed out on the lake. Frank and I went South on Ara again, and started a troll in the big weed bed. There were three boats there from the Ara Lake Lodge, drifting and casting our markers, so I made a pass right up through them, and caught the first pike of the morning. We kept heading south and gave the Ara boys the area. After trolling around the south end for a few hours we headed over to Stoney Bay to eat our lunch and troll some more. We caught quite a few walleye and a handful of pike in that first pass. The largest of the day came from only 4 feet of water....it was a nice healthy 38"" specimen. I did get a picture, but it’s dark…. I didn’t get a chance to turn the boat around, so the sun would be on the fish, because I had to show Frank how to use the iPhone camera, and then had to get the fish back in the water quickly. The larger they are the more fragile they are out of water, in my opinion.We didn't want to get caught on that end of the lake with the forecasted wind that was supposed to arrive in the afternoon, so I took Frank over to the east shore and trolled it all the way back up to the channel. Steve and I had done the same troll last year, and caught fish, so I was confident we would too...and, we did. Nothing big, but it kept us entertained. For dinner, we had salad, baked ham and scalloped potatoes, and your choice of a wild blueberry, or apple crisp, with ice cream...Yummy!Friday (Day7)It's the last day to fish... We started the morning out with a breakfast of eggs, fried potatoes, bacon, and toast.Frank and I stopped at the “secret spot” in the channel that he caught his 36” pike the other day. The lack of wind made it possible to stay in the weeds a little longer, and the shadows were right. As usual, Frank said, “Dollar on the first fish?” I agreed, and let my fire tiger silver minnow fly. It plopped down and made ripples on the glass like surface. I could see all the weeds and watched as a small pike darted out from the dark depths and attacked its prey…”Fish on!” I said, and Frank “Again? Oh brother!” (I think he may have caught the first fish once during the entire week). So, we made another bet when we started in a new area…to give him a chance to catch up. But, I caught that first fish too. lolThen, we changed the bet to be double or nothing on the first walleye of the day….but, I caught that one too, so now I was up by 4.00 for the day, and he gave up on the betting.I caught 18 of our 21 fish on Friday, and I’m guessing that’s why Frank had had enough and was ready to go in early (2pm). We played some cards, and had a couple of cocktails before a dinner of Grilled steaks with salad and baked potatoes. Dessert was a nice no bake cherry cheesecake…Yummy!I think I gained a lot of weight on this trip…lol That’s just too much food for me each day…but, I was more than happy to shovel it in, so I will pay the piper and work it off again…eventually. It just takes longer now that I’m getting older. lolAnyway…I had a fantastic trip with my friend Frank, and I just wanted to share the experience with all of you. Thanks for taking the time to read this (if you got all the way through it!)"
