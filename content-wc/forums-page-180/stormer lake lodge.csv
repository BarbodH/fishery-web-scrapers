We will be sure to leave a few fish for you, although their mouth's may be a bit tender. I hope that you guys make some great memories!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5721882,krazyk711,2017-08-16 20:24:00,26,"If you want to catch walleyes between 15"" and 23"" all day this is definitely the lake for you. Caught them in 6' and as deep as 42' but nothing over 24"" ??? We caught alot of smaller pike up to 5 or 6 lbs trolling cranks and casting..we did manage to tag 3 nice ones, 38,39 and 44 all caught within a 1/2 hour in a small weed pocket of outlet bay ! it's not a big pike lake despite the perfect habitat as we tried. Nice boats,clean camp,long drive,lousy food and ""unique"" owners..Tried it once and will not go back.."

5728289,BornToFish,2017-08-20 15:00:00,1224,"Greetings,My wife and I just returned from another fabulous week of fishing at Stormer Lake Lodge. We boated about nine hundred walleyes during the week. The vast majority of these fish were caught between 8:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.. We did not fish mornings before breakfast. My wife did not fish after dinner while I was out on the lake. We had two and one-half days with blue clear sky and flat-calm conditions.The average length for these walleyes was about 18-19 inches. We caught some ""shorts"" and LOTS of walleyes in the 17-19 inch range. We caught walleyes in the 20-24 inch range on an hourly basis. We also caught 25-27 inch walleyes on a daily basis. The winner of a ""walleye pool"" among another group in camp caught a 29 inch walleye. Stormer and Kirkness Lakes boast a very healthy walleye population.There were several different walleye patterns going last week. We caught the majority of our walleyes while fishing (vertical jigging) rock humps with a jig + live bait. The color of the jig and type of bait didn't matter - just get something in front of them. We also caught walleyes snap jigging, casting crank baits over the tops of rock humps, running Lindy Rigs and bottom bouncers and casting weeds/shorelines. There was something good happening for all fishing techniques. We enjoyed ""switching it up"" from time to time to introduce variety into the fishing day.We caught about twenty northern pike in the 25-35 inch range while walleye fishing, even though we never targeted the pike. I sensed that the majority of larger northern pike were on the rock humps as we had no shortage of bite-offs and walleyes being eaten on the way to the boat. Other anglers in camp reported the same suspicion as they were doing well on rock humps for their northern pike compared to weeds along shorelines.We believe the lodge's meals were spectacular! My wife and I enjoyed having a salad and bowl of homemade soup, from the lodge's fabulous salad bar, with each evening meal. We also enjoyed the homemade desserts. We were very pleased with every meal, but our most favorite meals featured bbq ribs, roast turkey, roast beef and steaks + shrimp. The lodge's complete menu can be seen at the following link:http://redlakeontariofishing.com/dining/The lodge provided a camp-wide shore lunch on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday. We simply brought three ""eater"" walleyes on each of these days, as all of the classic accompaniments of a traditional shore lunch were provided. By mid-week, many guests were requesting half-portions for their evening meals as they were ""stuffed full"" by then!My wife and I first met the owners of Stormer Lake Lodge (Dave and Linda Becker) about twenty years ago when they owned another fishing lodge. They are now among our very best of friends. Dave has been my fishing mentor for almost as long as I have known him. My wife and I also consider the Beckers to be ""unique"", but in a very good and special way!We stayed at another fishing lodge on a house-keeping plan. We compared the cost of a vacation at this lodge (cabin, upgrade boat, gas, our food) to our stay at Stormer Lake Lodge where everything is provided except our bait. The price difference just isn't that great. The incrementally higher price for our week of fishing is easily justified by catching 4-5 times the number and much better size of walleyes, all while fishing on two lakes that have only one fishing lodge. We rarely fished last week when another boat was within a quarter mile of us. When someone was close by us, it was because we invited them! Pressure from other anglers/boats simply isn't a factor at Stormer Lake Lodge.Every angler needs to decide how to best spend his/her hard-earned money and vacation leave when planning a fishing trip. A particular fishing trip may not be a good value for a particular angler, but could be a great value to the next angler. The number of returning guests and people on a ""wait list"" wanting to schedule a vacation suggest that many anglers consider a vacation at Stormer Lake Lodge to be a good value.My wife very much likes vacationing at Stormer Lake Lodge. She likes ""sleeping in late"", having all of her meals served to her and yanking walleyes pretty much all day long. She is very pleased to visit with friends or read a book during the evening while I am on the lake. Scheduling another fishing trip is now an ""easy sell"" .Please note that my wife and I do not have a financial interest in Stormer Lake Lodge. We pay the same rates as every other guest. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5663906,troutwater,2017-07-14 05:49:00,299,"Wow great report thanks for sharing! I've never done a walleye only trip before, but have considered it for an extended weekend for a few years now. I'm mainly a muskie fisherman and a very novice walleye fisherman. Sounds like this would be a good lake to go to."
5664018,BornToFish,2017-07-14 06:46:00,1224,"Greetings,Troutwater, thanks for the kind words.I am a walleye fisherman first, and a musky fisherman second. My interests are at opposite ends of the fishing spectrum. I love the finesse game of walleye fishing, and the power ""in your face"" game of musky fishing. I've learned over the years that there is a learning curve for both species of fish that anglers must master to consistently catch fish.There are lakes in NW Ontario that I would classify as good walleye waters, but are demanding of the angler. That is, successful walleye anglers pretty much have to know what they are doing to catch fish on a consistent basis. Successful angler needs to know specific locations to fish and have their equipment and techniques fine tuned. These walleye waters can offer trophy walleyes, but often immensely frustrate novice walleye anglers.On the other hand, I've learned that there are walleye waters that offer good numbers of fish to anglers. In such waters, novice anglers can fairly easily catch walleye and catch the ""walleye bug"". Novice anglers will be able to jump on the walleye learning curve on such waters and move up the learning curve with confidence. At the same time, trophy walleye hunters are often frustrated on these waters as they get tired of catching fifteen inch walleyes day after day.Stormer and Kirkness Lakes offer the experienced and novice walleye angler something at the same time - size and numbers. This is a fairly unique combination of walleye attributes! The lakes are big enough to explore, yet small enough to learn good locations to fish during their first week on the lake.I'm absolutely confident that there are other great walleye fisheries within NW Ontario. I know that my wife and I are completely satisfied fishing for walleyes on Stormer and Kirkness Lakes from Stormer Lake Lodge. Our only sacrifice is that I am not able to target muskies on these lakes as they are too far north from the musky's natural range. My wife doesn't mind the trade of tremendous walleye fishing for the chance at a musky.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5665594,TRFDDS,2017-07-14 21:30:00,13,Thanks for the info Guys! Looks like an amazing place. Mike
5665618,gullrockguy,2017-07-14 22:20:00,44,"i used to guide for the previous owners when they needed more help. believe me, i fish a lot and whenever i got the chance to go to stormer lake, i booked time off my regular job so i could go and guide, the fishing is that good."
5666090,Guest,2017-07-15 11:07:00,0,I got to Red Lake a couple of weeks a year. Do either of theses lakes have public access for a day trip or two? An hour drive doesn't seem too much for that fishing. M
5666186,BornToFish,2017-07-15 12:49:00,1224,"Greetings,There is public boat launch on Stormer Lake. There are some important caveats to note:1) The last twenty miles or so of the road to Stormer Lake is gravel. You might want to ponder this for a moment if you have a nice boat.2) The boat launch is completely unimproved, and accompanied by plenty of rocks to negotiate.3) There is no parking available. You would likely need to park along the gravel road. There is daily traffic by vehicles traveling to/from the Pikangikum Reserve and Red Lake. Again, something to ponder if you have a nice pickup.4) There is a daily launch fee for non-residents of Ontario.Kindest regards...."
5679026,Hwy 101,2017-07-22 12:16:00,33,"Returned last night from our trip to Stormer Lake Lodge. The walleye fishing was very good for both numbers and size. We did best fishing steep breaks in structure from 10'-28' fow. Other groups did well fishing the deep edge of weed lines. We caught pike both in cabbage and out on off shore structure. A hammered brass spinner bait with a motor oil tube trailer out fished spinners and spoons by a wide margin. Top water baits provided a lot of entertainment with the smaller pike. We only counted fish the last night and had 76 walleye and one pike fishing from 7-9pm. Earlier that day we had gone through 8 dozen minnows and a bag of Gulp from 1:30 to 5 pm anchored out of the wind next to an island. My son dropped and pulled the anchor countless times to get the boat to hold in the right spot but once we were over the fish it was non-stop action. We had bait fish and walleyes on the electronics the whole time. I caught more fish that day than I have ever caught in my life. Truly epic. Pearl, white and orange 2.5"" twister tails worked ok but minnows out fished them about 2 to 1. The only benefit was getting the jig back down without having to re-bait after every fish. I did make an attempt to fish Shiver Minnows and Jigging Raps during the trip with absolutely dismal results. There are probably a lot of guys (probably most) that can fish these baits better than me but it was extremely discouraging. My son thought it was hysterical and reminded me of it numerous times on the drive home. We walked up the road to the boat launch working off the chocolate cake and ice cream desert. It looked pretty sketchy. My first reaction was this would be a b#### just to get a canoe in here. To call it unimproved is generous. Booked for 2018."
5679314,BornToFish,2017-07-22 15:23:00,1224,"Greetings,Hello Highway 101! I'm glad that you had such a great trip and positive trip report. It sounds as though you and your son had a great trip that led to some great memories being made. I like your description to summarize your trip: ""truly epic""! What more can a guy say than that?I'm already starting to gather things and get ready for our upcoming trip in mid-August.Kindest regards...."

5034761,BornToFish,2016-08-02 14:09:00,1224,"Greetings, Stormer Lake Lodge was re-opened last year, having been closed for several years. The new owners are veterans of the fishing lodge industry. Stormer Lake Lodge is the only fishing lodge on Stormer and Kirkness lakes. The Lodge owners and staff are truly devoted to customer service. I have now fished from Stormer Lake Lodge for about nine weeks and can honestly say the lakes are fabulous walleye fisheries - I'm speaking in terms of size of fish and numbers. The northern pike fishing is something that I am now exploring, and have been very encouraged by what I have seen so far. The lakes have smallmouth bass, but this is a species that I haven't yet targeted. The forage base for the lakes appears to me to be shiner and spot-tail minnows, rather than perch or small minnow species. Stormer and Kirkness Lakes are connected to one another via a short and easily navigable river. Stormer Lake is a relatively small lake compared to Kirkness Lake. The Lodge is American Plan only. The six cabins and three ""apartments"" are in excellent condition. The Lodge's boats are 18 foot Lund/G3 with either 40 or 50 hp motors. Please send to me a private message should you want more information. I am headed there later this week. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5035025,Hwy 101,2016-08-02 17:12:00,33,"We fished at Stormer Lake Lodge last week. The fishing was incredible. Between my son and I we caught 75-125 walleye every day, and we didn't really fish that hard. Very pretty camp with great employees and owners. Frozen minnows or crawlers on a 1/16 jig worked best for us."
5047666,ManitowishWaters,2016-08-08 13:29:00,39,Headed up this Fri. night. I will report back.
5659754,TRFDDS,2017-07-11 20:55:00,13,"Searched for Stormer Lake on the message board and found this thread. Any recent updates on Stormer for the 2017 season? My dad and I are looking for a Ontario trip in 2018 with good boats and LOTS of Walleyes, and maybe some pike or bass as a sunny calm day option."

5660186,BornToFish,2017-07-12 07:16:00,1224,"Greetings,My wife and I just returned from another fabulous week of fishing at Stormer Lake Lodge. I have reported to many of our friends and on Walleye Central that the walleye fishing is sensational. Some folks didn't believe us. Thus, we used hand-held ""clickers"" to count our fish on this trip. But before I report our numbers, I want to put things in perspective.I fished about two hours each morning before breakfast while my wife slept in. I also fished about two and one half hours each evening after dinner while my wife visited with friends. We fished together during the daytime, about nine to ten hours.We fished for five and one half days. We essentially lost an afternoon to high winds, thus were not able to fish in our preferred spots. We were greeted on our final day of fishing with a formidable cold front. You likely know what that can do to walleye fishing.We registered 631 fish in the boat. We mostly targeted walleyes. There were some incidental catches of northern pike and perch. I'm confident that the number of walleyes was over six hundred. Although we did not measure the length of many walleyes, I'm confident that the average length was about nineteen inches. Walleyes in the 20-24 inch range are common. We caught walleyes in the 24-28 inch range every day.We were greeted on Monday morning of our trip with a blue clear sky and flat calm conditions - hardly ""ideal"" walleye conditions. The morning bite was slow for us. However, about midday the sky clouded over and the wind picked up to produce a nice chop on the lake. My wife and I boated 184 walleyes that day.A unique characteristic of the walleye fishing on Stormer and Kirkness Lakes is that there are multiple patterns in play each day - weeds, rocks, shorelines and suspended. We caught walleyes while vertical jigging in 25-30 fow on rock humps and also casting/rigging in five fow along windblown shorelines. The ""best"" walleye bite is often during the middle of the day, rather than in ""prime"" time (i.e. dawn/dusk).We targeted northern pike for about two hours one afternoon. We boated pike at 32, 36 and 41 inches, along with a bunch of ""eaters"" and hammer handles. Others in our group spent more time chasing pike than we did. I know of three other pike over forty inches within our group, with the biggest at 43.5 inches. Pike from 30-40 inches were a daily occurrence.Stormer and Kirkness Lakes are about 6,000 acres or so in total. The lakes are connected by an easily navigable channel. Stormer Lake Lodge is the only lodge on these lakes. The lodge has thirteen boats, so fishing pressure is not a factor. If you can, look at a lake depth contour map for Kirkness Lake. You will appreciate the abundance of structure to target for walleyes. The amazing thing is that there is LOTS of structure not even shown on the lake map.The lodge boats are mostly 18 foot Lunds (Outfitter?) with a few new 18 foot G3s. The motors are mostly 50 hp Yamaha tillers, some 50 Honda tillers and a few 40 hp Honda tillers. The boats are fitted with a basic sonar unit, bait cooler, net, an anchor and a bow-mount trolling motor. All boats have floors and casting decks. All of the lodge's boats are comfortable to fish from, but more importantly are a stable platform when the water gets rough.You mentioned a possible interest in staying at Stormer Lake Lodge in 2018. If so, I urge you to contact the lodge owners (by email) fairly soon to express your interest. The lodge is at nearly full occupancy in 2017. The cabins that open up for 2018 will likely be quickly booked.Please do not hesitate to contact me by private message if you would like to chat further.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5661162,Hwy 101,2017-07-12 15:46:00,33,Great report. We are leaving for Stormer Lake Lodge Friday. Last year was our first time on these lakes and it was truly epic walleye fishing. BornToFish gave me a few pointers before our trip (actually he marked up a map with his spots!) which was extremely helpful. Thanks again Mark.
5661234,BornToFish,2017-07-12 16:35:00,1224,"Hello Hwy. 101,It was nice to see your post on this thread. I hope that you and your son have safe travels and a wonderful time on the lakes. Make some great memories!!! The walleyes were clearly established on the off-shore rock humps when we were there last week, rather than shorelines. The northern pike seemed split between the rock humps and the cabbage weeds (i.e. shorelines).Good fishing and tight lines!!"
