Canoe on trout lake leaked so bad only 1 could fish while the other baled water
1262145,FishingTraveler,2011-01-16 12:00:00,1,"I also sent you a PM. I was there a few years ago. I found the owner and his son to be great. I have sent a few people there since then with some really good results and some mixed. I think some of it depends on what you are used to. For walleye, this area doesn't compare to many norhtwest Ontario destinations. But if you are looking for smallmouth, walleye and pike combination for a reasonable price, I found Lost Lake to be a nice place. I have some more detailed reports on a personal web site but want to respect Walleye Central by not posting the addresses on the forum. PM me if anyone is interested.Chris"
