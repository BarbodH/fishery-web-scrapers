1261920,lacywbosu,2011-01-15 09:02:00,171,Thanks for the information on Basil and his amazing abillities to catch Pacific Sailfish on Lac Seul. I am canceling my Costa Rica fishing trip and will try to hook up with Basil. It will be nice to drive as I hate flying. Can't wait to see the fishing tackle he uses.
1261989,ManitouBass,2011-01-15 14:22:00,201,"Harvey Cochrane, hands down the best guide I've dealt with. He's a great guy also, which is always a plus.He's taught me more in the past two years than I learned in 28 years previous, lol"
1262136,orchard frank,2011-01-16 10:54:00,1900,"Hey, Mike, ask Sir Basil to relate the story of winning a custom made rod for being the Top Guide on Lac Seul, and the old man (Jim) whined about it so much that the next year he was awarded a rod of his own, also for Top Guide, but inscribed right on the rod was the disclaimer ""Senior Division"". Two buddies of mine went up one year and booked a day with him. Basil, knowing there was an odd shaped blowdown up near Grassy told Ed and Little Mel to ""duck down quick, see that big bull moose up there?"", so as they ducked down he eased closer, every time they tried to look he would snap at them in a loud whisper ""STAY DOWN"" After keeping them in the bottom of the boat for about 2 miles, he told them, ""okay ease up real careful and look at this big SOB"" He couldn't tell the story without breaking up. The million fish they caught that day was way down on the list for them."
1261459,Mike Kansas,2011-01-13 09:19:00,1463,Would love to hear from others about Great Guides. There is a Guide that fishes out of Lost Island Lodge in Ontario whose name is Basil. In my 50+ years of fishing Canada I have never fished with anyone any better. He puts you on fish every day and a lot of fish. However his greatest talent is that he recognizes what makes a fisherman happy. For example we book him when we take our wives out fishing and he caters to their every need and makes sure they catch a bunch of fish and have a great time. The wives love him and cant wait to get back to the lake and fish with him every summer. Now all us guys know that when the wife is happy so are we. Basil is a fishing hero and can make my wife happier than I can....he is younger than me...hope the wife doesent read this. Lets hear about your favorite Guide. Mike Kansas
1261482,Hump,2011-01-13 11:16:00,578,"Here I have been reading your posts , looked at your website and I thought you were the fisherman that everyone aspires to be. I didn't think the great Mike Kansas needed a guide!!! I heard you were a legend in NW Ontario, kinda like Ontario's answer to Minnesota's Babe Winkelman."
1261489,Mike Kansas,2011-01-13 11:53:00,1463,"Hump, You are 100% right about my fishing prowness. I'm a Legend In My Own Mind. However if a Guide can keep my wife happy in a boat AWAY from me then he becomes my HERO. Mike Kansas"
1261499,tlars,2011-01-13 12:35:00,137,"Hump, you've been in the house too long. Go scoop some more snow. I've fished with Basil also (only once) and with my wife. Mike is right on. Basil really knows how to keep guests in his boat happy. I really like the way he holds his rod by the butt, cradling it with his thumb and forefinger. Watched him catch nice (22""+) walleyes with this grip. You can sure tell that he's spent a lifetime working with his hands. I've got some great guide stories about the SWWL guides. They are all top notch at finding fish, keeping to boat on fish and cooking spectacular shore lunches. Can't wait for soft water!"
1261504,lacywbosu,2011-01-13 12:58:00,171,"When you get as old as me, eventually you get to travel a little. My best guide ever was a 115 lb. Panamanian working at Roy's Zancudo Lodge in Costa Rica. He was the captain, first mate, and second mate. Just him and me landing Pacific sails, dorado, yellow fin tuna off shore and grouper, snapper, mackeral, jacks, rooster fish, and sharks inshore. We were trolling for sails near a school of bait fish on the surface that the birds were whacking. The tuna and sails were there driving the bait to the surface. We made one circle and Rafael yelled Tuna, oh no another one. He puts the boat in newtral as I start crankin and a third tuna is hooked. I landed three 100lb yellow fins. What a circus."
1261506,Mike Kansas,2011-01-13 13:05:00,1463,We have caught all those species on Lac Seul with Basil. Mike Kansas
1261509,tv4fish,2011-01-13 13:11:00,2694,"We have caught all those species on Lac Seul with Basil.Mike: My sides are hurtin' here.I have a guide story, but can't tell you the name of the guide. On our first trip to Canada we did not use a guide - bottom line, we didn't catch squat On our 2nd trip, we thought (being the cheapskates that we are) - why don't we just follow a guide and his clients and see where THEY fish and then we'll fish the same area (and NO, not right next to them -we have SOME scruples). At the time I was running a 17 footer with a 50 hp. Merc. tiller. It had the typical 6 gal. remote gas tank. We also carried a 6 gal. gas can for back-up. So, we launch the boat and watch for a guide with clients to launch. One shows up and our plan is underway. The guide is running the typical small boat with a 25 hp. Merc. So, we have no problem following and staying w/n eyesight. We're cruising along for quite a while - through parts of the lake system that we have not seen, and the pilot (as in ME), is gettin' a little nervous. We round a point and in front of us is a huge body of water. About the same time the motor starts coughing - as in - we're running out of gas! I tell my Buddy - this is it - we're not going any further, we need the gas to get back to the launch. By the time I gas up the boat tank, the guide is out of sight! I said as long as we came this far, let's try fishing! Bottom line, that spot is the same spot we always hit first every year we have gone up. We have expanded our ""hot spots"" by trying different spots in that same area also. We have continued to have good luck. It WAS a ""guided trip"", but I can't tell you who the guide was."
1261514,Hump,2011-01-13 13:32:00,578,"I do have cabin fever! I need to get out of here. Only two more weeks to sun , golf and fish! Great answe by mike!"
1261779,IowaWalleyeGuy,2011-01-14 14:40:00,47,"As far as the best guide I have used on my trips to ontario, Colin Gosse is the man !!!We fished first week in sept. last year and hired him for one day.My family has used ""smokey"" on Minnitaki in the past, but after seeing Colin's web site I gave him a call.My concern was keeping my 8 year old daughter interested and catching fish while out on the water for the day.Colin has a young son so I felt he would be a great fit.Well My daughter caught her first Walleye in Canada, 25in. and was having a great time ALL DAY...OVER 8 HOURS out on the lake.She actually fell asleep on the way back going across the lake!!!Colin is a teacher not just a guide, I have fished in Ontario for over 30 years and learned more in one day with him than combined trips with other guides.He usually guides for moosehorn lodge but also runs his own guide service.We caught lots of fish and had a great time !!Just talked to Colin a few Days ago and I think he might be able to slip by in the evening when we come up in june this year, his days are filling up, can't wait for some more big eye's!!!!"
1261834,tiz,2011-01-14 18:45:00,18,"My countdown on the lower part of my screen says 4 months, 15 days, 19 hours, and 23 minutes to Marten River, ON. I am taking my 12 year old son on his first father/son fishing trip. The resort owner has twin 12 year old boys and set us up with a day with a guide on an outpost lake. I can't wait. I don't know if this kid that I know to always have a gameboy in his hand will be able to hold a fishing pole waiting for that tug or walleye feel. I guess we will see. Here in Atlanta we had a week of ice and snow, yes almost five inches. School was closed all week and the roads are still icy. No salt, no sand, and no plows. We hired a guide out of Rhinelander, WI several years ago and went Musky fishing. Steve would hook a musky and let me wife do all the work after the hook set. She loved it and can't wait to head back up to the Rhinelander area. She was very impressed with the number of bars that one city can have in such a short walking distance....."
