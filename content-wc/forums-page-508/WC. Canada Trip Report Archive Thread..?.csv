WC is a bit of a new forum for me to check in on. It's enjoyable to see here that many folks on both sides of the border have great tales and appreciation for Canadian waters and its fishing. It would be of interest to me (and maybe all) if anglers here could take the time to dig up some old, favorite trip reports to link in this thread. Link reports on site or off, doesn't matter. Pop up as many as you like as often as you like. This would give us something to enjoy over the winter, it could help us with future trip ideas, it would give us the chance to better know one another and it would be fun show and tell.Bunk."

I've read several of your trip reviews (along with your outstanding photos).....they are truly a pleasure to read. Rich"

Along the same ""line"", sort of - It would be great if more of the folks who have asked for camp/lake/ river recommendations would just follow through on giving us a report after their trip. It is recognized that we all have to play ""catch up"" after returning from a trip, but it just plain is appreciated by the recommender, as well as by so many other folks interested in reading the report. If the fishing wasn't that good, change your name on the report! Bill Krejca"
