1256202,campchick,2010-12-18 07:07:00,96,"September can be a great month weather wise but not every year. 2009 was absolutely fantastic but 2010 - not so much. As a camp owner, it is my favourite month. I love the weather (if it is good), the absence of bugs, the fall colors, the smell of the wood smoke. I like the fact that I can devote my full attention to building projects and ongoing maintenance because there are fewer guests. In our business we see a predictable pattern repeated yearly. Spring guests are usually groups of guys, summer is for families and when labour day rolls around it pretty much heralds the end of the fishermen as children are back in school. It is too bad because the fishing is superb. The air even smells different in the fall - can't explain it - you'd just have to be here. Take care everyone, stay warm and keep thinking of next year's fishing trip!"
1256241,Golden Eagle,2010-12-18 09:41:00,2642,Life is better because of my many October fishing trips to NW Ontario.
1256775,SeulAreaWalleye,2010-12-20 16:24:00,100,"Nice to hear that there are many people on here that enjoy walleye fishing this country in September, and even October. I always end up guiding steady in the fall, but no where near the pace that I go all season long. Many of these bookings happen last minute as well, when people can get a better reading on the weather patterns. Cheers to all of you that have fished Canada in the fall, I truly believe that it is the best time of year up here! Thanks for the feedback, and Happy Holidays to everyone at WC!"
1256790,gary2242,2010-12-20 17:04:00,49,"HiIt totally depends on what lake. In some lakes the September Walleye fishing is amazing and in other lakes the Walleyes take off down deep or head out in the middle of the lake where it's really deep and school around 20 feet down to feed on Shad, Lake Herring and small whitefish that are coming shallow because of the cooler water. I would stick to a small lake or a shallow lake. Wabigoon and Dinorwic would be my first choices because the water is shallow and the Walleyes basically stay in the same areas they are in all summer. Plus the pike, bass and muskie fishing is amazing that time of year.The Clearwater/Pipestone Chain of Lakes and the Seine River Chain of Lakes are also hot spots in September because the Walleyes are mirgrating and you can slaughter them just outside narrows between the different lakes. As far as weather, in mid September you can spend the day sun tanning on the beach and wake up the next morning with snow on the ground. If the wind is coming from the west or south you get nice weather. Cold fronts can come down from the arctic over night and it's a whole new ballgame. Traditionally, right around the beginning of September on the holiday weekend is when the weather turns nasty and then it's usually nice by mid September. By mid September the trees are usually in full fall colours and it's beautiful.As far as what the Walleye are hitting, they are usually more attracted to lures with natural colours in the fall like Perch, silver and black and silver and gold. Red and Firetiger slow down that time of year. Chartreuse works on some lakes during the day but it's better at night. For jigging, un-scented white twistertails with a tiny piece of worm or a small jig with a live minnow or salted minnow works best. Salted baits work great but scented baits do not work in the north. If you have been covering your lures with Berkly Power Scent or another brand of scent, wash your lures before you use them. Make sure you wash your hands a couple of times after touching gas.Gary"
1256804,SeulAreaWalleye,2010-12-20 17:56:00,100,"I guess I'll mention that Lac Seul east has a major walleye migration in the fall as well, every year certain areas light up unbelievably with cooling waters temps."
1256904,Bill Krejca,2010-12-21 07:04:00,6107,"It is interesting how the bait of choice varies from water to water. For example, on LOW, when I fish crappies in Sep, I always use Berkley scent, with a modified cap, actually squirt it right into the tube or hair jig. Walleyes also hit it very well. It just must make a difference where you are fishing. As we become ""somewhat more educated"" on the sport, the learning never stops! Maybe that's why it continues to be fun! Bill Krejca"
1262094,MorganMan,2011-01-16 07:47:00,341,"We have been up in late August to mid September for the last 18 years and found the same variance in weather. Not a problem if you are prepared. However, the last couple years have been very HOT in late August.....90 plus! Cabin never cools down and we end up swimming to cool down.....usually don't prepare for that! We are working on a Sept trip this year instead as we would rather start a fire in the cabin rather than sweat all night long."
1262111,GWC,2011-01-16 08:52:00,1021,"We were on Gull Rock Lake the third week of September. The Friday before our arrival, it snowed & there was gale force wind. This kept the lake pretty rough all week. We leased a 16.5 foot deep-v with a 50 hp 4 cycle from our host at Poplar Point Resort. We were on the lake all week & had a great time. We caught a good number of walleyes & several large pike. We usually make our trip in June. I really like June but a second trip in September is definitely a bonus & fishing is good then too. I don't think you can pick a bad time. We've been going there for several years now & Eddie & Lisa have always made our trip(s) special. We'll be going back in early June this year. I'm not sure about September but we may make a second trip again this year. I'm hooked on fishing Gull Rock Lake. We've caught a lot of big fish"
1262182,castnblast,2011-01-16 15:10:00,111,"I live in thunder bay and fish alot. If I could only have one month to fish it would be Sept 15 - Oct 15th. The air is clear and the launch is never busy. Everything in the bush senses the the change in season and walleye are no exception. The bite is on the the fish are aggressive. Days are short and the weather can blow up in hurry, but thats part of the experience. IMO, there is no better time to be out. cnb"
1255788,SeulAreaWalleye,2010-12-16 08:15:00,100,"I was wondering if anyone could list the factors here, that deter them from booking September fishing trips in Canada. For several years in a row the weather has not been a factor at this time, and fall has been beautiful in Canada. I do understand that kids are back in school, and family trips are harder to plan. Most lodges slow down and offer discounts to trips at this time, while some even close up early. The traffic is down, scenery are beautiful, and walleye/pike fishing is at it's best. Musky fishermen will book all the way into November, so why do most walleye fishermen overlook September?"
1255794,Pooch,2010-12-16 08:31:00,4619,"I'm not sure that September is all that slow. Some camps are busy for the fall Lake trout fishing. We've fished early September for a number of years targeting walleye and did very well. September 2009 was the warmest part of the summer while September 2010 was quite brisk. Fishing was decent both years.I have a good friend that likes to make a Mid September fly-in trip as the foliage can be pretty most years. Much later and there is no foliage.Fall trips are like spring trips, you can't predict the weather.Pooch"
1255797,new hips,2010-12-16 08:42:00,498,"Colin, good question....we would usually fish Lac Seul in September. The first 2 weeks I would agree, we fished it in the third week one year and froze to death most days, with high winds which made fishing big water impossible. Labor Day traffic is also a concern, hotels and border crossing jammed. We preferred Labor Day week, but also found out that area locals were out in numbers as there was local access nearby. We usually fished Kleiners Point and it was nothing to see 5-6 boats in a quarter mile area. One year the locals would fish right along side of your boat,they snagged our marker buoy!!!!!! that's my 2 cents worth, that sort of turned us off. It's my favorite time of year, but also good fishing back home, could be another factor. With a lake that big nobody should fishing 10 yds from your boat.New Hips"
1255801,Mike Kansas,2010-12-16 09:02:00,1463,"We have fished Canada many times in September and October. However I prefer fishing rivers with dams that time of year. We have fished the Red River at Selkirk Manitoba and the English River at Ear Falls Ontario. Both allow less exposure to inclement weather because a big body of water can get rough during higher wind and the rivers have less exposure just because of their design. From a fishing standpoint the fish are coming to the Dams and rivers in order to pack on some weight in preperation of winter because the food supply can be more concentrated. Kind of like going to a restaurant. These type of conditions and elements can allow large concentrations of high quality fish. We have caught more 30"" +++ fish in these areas than on the lakes in summer. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1255861,AllenW,2010-12-16 12:27:00,11482,"We fished Red for many years and always went in late Sept, fishing was awesome, lake was deserted and the occasional snow flurry kept the moskitoes away.Third week in Sept would be my favorite, dress warm though it can get cold.Usually that time of the year we fished shallow for eaters and deeper 30-35fow for trophy size.Al"
1255875,Golden Eagle,2010-12-16 13:27:00,2642,"My favorite trips are in October. Usually I go alone and am the only fisherman on the lake, sometimes the only person in camp if the owner is away. Latest I've gone is the week after nonresident moose season opener in the Red Lake area. Once a blizzard and strong winds kept me off the water, so I sliced a steak off the hind quarter of a moose hanging in the fish house and threw it on the grill. My other favorite months are: May, June, July, August and September."
1255881,cast_and_blast,2010-12-16 13:50:00,1098,"Been going in September or October for over 10 years. We've been in shorts and t-shirts and we've been in every piece of clothing that we brought along - and everything in-between. We love that time of year - and yes, it IS slower at most resorts. We ALWAYS get a significant discount that time of year whether it be for a fly-in, cabin, house rental or houseboat. This past year the fall colors were stunning - made great backdrops for fish photos! Good luck! Scott"
1255931,Bill Krejca,2010-12-16 17:48:00,6107,"Fall is a great time to go. Less people on the water, no bugs, fantastic tree colors, usually good fishing. I really enjoy my annual mid-Sep. trips and the relative solitude. Weather can be a bit tricky at times. The latest I've gone was Oct 16, 1966. Got stuck on the way up in a gas station in Cloquet, pulling my boat in a snow storm. We tented out on LOW for a week. Other than my week-long tooth ache, Dad and I and another fellow had a great time. The same cooler ice we brought from home came home with us. Like most trips, it can be a memory maker. Bill Krejca"
1256050,Pete eer,2010-12-17 09:38:00,14,"Our group went to the Red Lake area the second week of September this year. After the first night we were the only group in camp. The fishing was great, no bugs, the weather was cold but we were dressed for it. I have tried all the summer months in the past but I will go back in September next year."
1256056,REG,2010-12-17 09:47:00,445,What everyone else said. We've noticed that bugs are mostly nonexistent - even in the evenings - in Sept. Plus Grouse season opens up around the middle of Sept. and that can be a fun addition to the fishing. But the kids can't go in Sept. like they can right after school is out in June so we won't be doing Sept again for awhile. Another possible detraction is the day is shorter by Sept. too - but that's not much of an issue.
