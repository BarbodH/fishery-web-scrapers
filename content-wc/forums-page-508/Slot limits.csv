1261542,tackleman,2011-01-13 15:35:00,444,"there are several slot sizes that are in force in ontario, you must check the regulations to verify that you do not possess any species in the slot limit for that species or that particular lake you are fishing on.for example on my lake, gullrock, you can't have more than 1 walleye over 18.1 inches.On Lac Seul you cant have a walleye between two different measurements (lets say 18 to 25 inches, for arguments sake) but if you check the regulations you might be able to have 1 over 25 inches.each species has it's own slots better check and be sure than gamble and be sorry"
1261578,Hump,2011-01-13 18:46:00,578,Does anyone know about this lake. I am in full support of whatever regulations they have. I have fished both Gull Rock and Lac Seul and both are great fisheries and will continue to be.
1261580,Bill Krejca,2011-01-13 18:51:00,6107,"Hump, The fishing rule book for Ontario is many pages thick. The province is broken down into a number of regions, each with their own regulations. In addition, the regions are further broken down into separate bodies of water, sometime even bays of a lake, with different rules for limits and sometimes even different opening times (or none at all). Legal size limits also vary, in some lakes the fish have to be immediately killed if kept, in most they can be kept alive. How great it would be if we had as many opportunities for fishing in Iowa, such that it would be necessary (if it is) to have that close regulation of the fishery! If it will be your first trip, plan on spending 1/2 hour or so when you first get there finding your region and all the pertinent regulations for the water you will be fishing. Have fun! Bill"
