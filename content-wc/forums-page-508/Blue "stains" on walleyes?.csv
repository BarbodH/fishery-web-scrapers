We did fairly well catching our daily limit of walleye but a few of those walleye had blue ""stains"" or markings on them. It was on the outside of the fish and some on the inside when we filled them. Kind of like a person had marked them with a blue sharpie. Any idea(s) what it was? We were somewhat concerned that it might have been mercury or something. However, we did end up eating them and they tasted as good as all of the other delicious walleye we catch each year"

The following is an excerpt from thefreelibrary.com , a Google result.""The blue walleye owes its cobalt cast to a lack of yellow skin pigment and the presence of a blue protein in the mucus coating its skin. This protein, which Schaefer and the collaborating scientists who discovered it dubbed ""sandercyanin,"" does not affect the health or taste of the fish.""Several years ago, while fishing Kenoji Lake on a fly-in trip, we caught a ~lot~ of blue walleye. Ate up just as good as the typical yellow / bronze ones."
1261236,eyemike,2011-01-12 11:08:00,233,I have found that in some lakes whether it be minerals or plant life in that particular lake will give the fish a blue hue. My dad and I fished a remote lake in Canada that the pike and the walleye had a blue tint. You could actually rub it off the fish. I don't Know what exactly causes it but I know it is environment.
