I have always stayed at 3 Seasons Camp, another outfitter about 10 miles from Taggart Bay Lodge. While I haven't stayed at Taggart Bay Lodge, it's where I park my vehicle. The launch ride from Taggart Bay Lodge to 3 Seasons Camp is about 35 minutes. While I primarily target walleye on these trips I also fish for lake trout. I'd say the average walleye caught is 1 Â½ to 2 pounds while the average lake trout caught is 3 pounds. The minimum length limit for lake trout is 20 inches (an 11 year old lake trout by the way). The minimum length limit for walleye is a ridiculous 12 inches but hardly anyone keeps walleye that small. Northern pike (up to 12 pounds) are usually caught whether you target that species or not. White fish and bass are also taken. Taggart Bay Lodge is a well run outfitter with excellent equipment and cabins. A few cabins require climbing lots of stairs to and from the water. Consequently, be selective when making a reservation. The Taggart Bay Lodge web site can assist in picking a cabin location. American plan and house keeping plans are available at Taggart Bay Lodge.
