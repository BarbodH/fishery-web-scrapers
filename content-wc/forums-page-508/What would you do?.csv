I wanted to try Lac Seul from what I hear it produces good #'s and from what I seen on other posts I was planing on Timberlane Lodge,called and talk to them,friendly,resonable,BUT just the couple days before Christmas we ge a package in the mail from the lodge where we always go,opened it up pulled out a calendar,and a new price sheet which seems cheaper because of new owners,now with the new price list was there new brochour totally different!I was on the front cover sheet with my 515lb. black bear I got last yr.! I know I dont have to go back but that put big smile on my face!just wonder what your guys thoughts would be?reading all the threads some people seem to find a place and go there 10-15 yr."

Quit trying to please.It never hurts to try somewhere new and get another type of experience for your time here on planet earth.As for Timberlane, I have never been to the lodge, but I know the owners since I bought a quad from them at their sports store in Ear Falls this past November. I have nothing but good to say about the way they conduct business and their ethics. I would assume the camp is run the same way. Vance and Wendy are local people who were raised in Ear Falls and after running a camp in the NOrthwest Territories , sold it to come home , where they bought Timberlane.My neighbour went to school with Vance and he guides for him sometimes when the camp is busy and he tells me the fishing on Lac Seul is amazing. so why not give it a shot.I too go down to Eagle a few times a year and fish with my buddies, usually in the west arm, and it is the dead sea compared with a lot of other lakes in the northwest, but I think it isn't the number of fish caught, it's the fun you have trying to catch fish that makes the trips memorable."

Lac Seul will give you good fishing. But they won't make the weather any different. Maybe take the money saved on lodging and toss it towards a guide?Me?I stay one more year.

1258881,dutchboy,2011-01-01 11:11:00,5717,I was just teasing you.Have a great time where ever you go.

Vance and Wendy are super friendly and have gone the extra mile every summer for us. It is my favorite week of the year hands down. Give Timberlane a try. You won't be sorry."
