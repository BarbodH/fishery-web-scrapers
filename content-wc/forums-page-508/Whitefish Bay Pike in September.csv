1261993,Beagle_Nut,2011-01-15 14:35:00,52,Anyone able to share some info on fall pike fishing in / around Whitefish Bay on LOTW? Thinking of going there next year to Whitefish Bay Camp after we talked to them at the All Canda Show last week. A few older posts have me concerned the water in the area could be excessively clear. Thanks.

I used to regularly go up through Turtle Portage to fish for big northern. But now my boats too big and I'm too old to do it alone. You should have a good time there and you will definitely enjoy the beauty that is Whitefish Bay.
