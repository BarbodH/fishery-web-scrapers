1259800,camp chef,2011-01-05 10:45:00,915,No-seeums...guarenteed. I have the same problem
1259904,Moondog,2011-01-05 20:46:00,362,"Some people don't react much to bites by noseeums. I do and really suffer!!! They itch so bad that I make myself bleed. My doctor says that I am allergic to insect bites and prescribed a strong cortisone cream. BUT.......found something that works better!!! Voltaren Cream. Usually prescribed as an anti-inflammatory cream for arthritis and is available in Canada without prescription. So what is an allergic reaction but an inflammatory response and it has been a life saver not to mention a sleep saver. Don't leave home without it. Works on all bites better than anything I have tried. Noseeums come thru the screens, crawl up your pants legs and can generally get anywhere you don't want them."
1259913,eyemike,2011-01-05 22:05:00,233,I agree with the no-seeums they are nasty little buggers. we spray the screens with yard guard to keep the buggers out of the cabin.
1262086,MorganMan,2011-01-16 07:20:00,341,"I have had a problem on my legs the last couple of years also.....red rash and thought bugs too.....then allergy to bug spray......everything. Then I had the same problem in Florida last year. I have developed an allergy to the sun and it is only on my legs. I fish in shorts in Canada, don't even take pants with me even in September. I will use rain gear (bibs) if needed but it turns out to be sun allergy. Bummer."
1262141,Moondog,2011-01-16 11:21:00,362,Duh! I now remember several people at camp that developed an allergic reaction to the sun and it is just as you describe. If you google it and read the signs and symptoms you may have your diagnosis. Good call Morganman
1258970,bigtimeelectric,2011-01-01 20:17:00,174,"Every year I go to canada for over 15 years now I develop itchy red bumps on my legs and arms after a couple days in camp, nobody else that comes with gets this. I have been to drive in camps and fly outs and this occurred at both. nothing seams to relieve this itch. Does anybody else experience anything like this? or is there a fishing dermatologist out there with the cure all? haha I would appreciate any help I might get from this forum.THIS IS NOT...1.bug bites2.poison oak or ivy3.an std4.bring own linens so rules out laundry detergent5.food alergy as we bring in our own6.sunburn7.any alcohol related issue"
1258977,Rich B,2011-01-01 21:39:00,1081,I'm thinking this has to be an allergic reaction...do you go up about the same time every year ? and to the same general area of Ontario ? Anyone else in your group or the camp get these bumps ? Do you go swimming or get into the water ? Years ago I got a itching rash on my hands and forearms when I was up north....turned out I was getting them wet with lake water (catch and release) and the sunlight along with the weed pollen in the water that got on my skin caused the break-outs.....sunblock and no more lake water cleared it up. I've seen pine scum on lakes' surfaces.....somehow you're getting an allergic reaction to something up north....good luck with your skin problem.....I'll bet someone on this board will help. Rich B
1259005,Golden Eagle,2011-01-02 07:16:00,2642,Possible fish allergy?
1259019,BrianinVA,2011-01-02 08:08:00,160,Could it be a reaction to your sunblock? There are a lot of unpronounceable ingredients in sunblock and reactions are not uncommon.
1259023,Paul H,2011-01-02 08:22:00,1232,"Has to be SOME weird allergy. Do you wade or get in the water? I can see getting your arms wet fishing, but not the legs unless you wade, push off the boat etc. Do you wear shorts - are the legs exposed to sun? Do you walk through any tall grass? There has to be something common between the arms and legs. I'm allergic to so damm many things I'd probably never notice it. All I have to do is brush a pine and I get welts. I'd still look for some small bug. Possibilities: Wood pile - fire wood Something on a piece of furniture - I can't handle wool at all. Bedbugs - remote but possible. Something in the water Algae as someone else said. Calamine lotion and or topical Benadryl"
1259042,gpbrown,2011-01-02 09:37:00,359,Sounds like an allergic reaction as others have stated. You might try to get an injection of Kenalog from your doctor before you go up next time. Maybe a month or couple of weeks before you leave.
1259074,Blue Lk,2011-01-02 12:34:00,269,"Although you think it is not bug bites,I'm thinking you are the victim of ""No-see-ems"",also called sandflies.Those little buggers are so small they will come right thru a screen window & leave a nasty,itchy welt.You don't even know they are around till it is too late.Some people are more sensitive to these,I know I will itch for days."
1259196,troutaholic,2011-01-03 06:59:00,827,I think that Rich B hit on the head....Pine sap/needles. I have to wear gloves and a long sleeve shirt when I cut down the Christmas tree and handling pine wood during the year. No one else in my family is affected. I had the same outbreak on year in Canada when we portaged through a pine forest (shorts and t-shirt).
1259203,scgibby11,2011-01-03 07:34:00,109,"Here is my guess:Are you swimming or does this occur in areas that get wet with lake water? If so, it is ""swimmer's itch."" This is also known as schistosoma dermatitis. We have it in almost all of the lakes in northern Michigan. The life cycle is somewhat complex, but humans intercept the life cycle when a small form of parasite is shed by snails, trying to find ducks. The snails are primarily in shallow water 3-4 feet or less, and they shed mostly in the morning. When these buggers penetrate human skin, our immune system kills it under the skin, so we can't get the actual infection. However, it sets up a VERY intense reaction in the form of a itchy, red papule--more intense than a mosquito bite. You can get hundreds of them, commonly on the legs if swimming or wading in shallow water.Rubbing off with a towel vigorously after going in the water or dipping hands in shallow water will prevent it.Scott"
1259252,tv4fish,2011-01-03 10:18:00,2694,"I'm going to agree with BlueLk We have one member of our group that suffered from the same thing for years. He started spraying himself VERY liberally with bug repellent - problem gone. Our guess was that he was just more ""sensitive"" to those little critters and he was the only one with that kind of reaction."
