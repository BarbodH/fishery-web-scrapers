1257918,jigmeister,2010-12-27 12:38:00,34,"hump,i have been fishing this lake since i was a kid. the walleye and pike fishing is very good. the smallmouth bass fishing is an added bonus. when i was a kid they weren't even in the lake. i heard that a smaller lake flooded into ldml and they went nuts frome there. in the spring i would troll floating rapalas in any color along the shoreline. maki bay, portage bay, open reserve and bolton bays would be my choice of places to start. hook island and any other big islalnds would produce as well. i would consider this lake an action lake not a trophy lake although i know trophies are in there. last year we stayed at pine point resort and did real well until gale force winds kept us off the lake the last 1-1/2 days in june. if there is no wind, drop a jig and minnow and you will connect with walleye. as this is a tea stained lake, there is usually a bite going on somewhere. PLANOCAT this is rick from chicago. i stopped by your rv to say hi last june. . hope all is well. won't see you this year as we are staying at sleepy dog cabins on wabaskang. make sure to bring a gps and watch out for rock piles. the **** things come out of nowhere.happy new year and i hope all your baits get devoured. jigmeister goooone!!!"
