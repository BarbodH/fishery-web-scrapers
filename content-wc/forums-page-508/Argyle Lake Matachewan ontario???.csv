1261643,bucktaker,2011-01-14 06:39:00,4,Hello has anyone had any experience with this place? Or can anyone recommend any one in this area? Thinking of staying here as a base location for a week of fishingLooked at Google map of this area lots of semi-remote lakes does anyone do good just dropping a boat into places like these?Looking for large pike and eyes.... Thanks
1261699,Curryale,2011-01-14 09:50:00,50,I have fished quite a bit in the area but never on Argyle Lake. You are right that many of the Lakes in the area are accessed via logging road and can be considered semi-remote4 wheel drive truck or ATV is necessary to get into several of the lakes to the west of Matachewan.Overall this area gets hit pretty hard for Walleye and Pike. It has been that way for as long as I can remember. It would not be my top choice for large fish - or numbers of fish.
1262095,bucktaker,2011-01-16 07:50:00,4,"""Hit pretty hard"" is this by locals or who???I guess I should define large as a 30 in pike which will be our main target.I was up there in 09 with a too large fiberglass boat and didint fish the smaller lakes. the plan this yr is to take a 16 ft crestliner kodiak 25 hp scand a atv to access.just wondering what out sucess could be.Looking for other options besides Arglye lake for camp"
1262142,Curryale,2011-01-16 11:35:00,50,Yes the area is fished pretty hard by the locals in the area. 20 or so years ago it was a lot of non-residents.Bloom Lake isnt a bad walleye and pike lake. You should be able to get into some Pike around 30 inches there. You will need to take an ATV in and carry the boat about 100 yards to get to the water though.There is a nice campsite on an island. Stayed there 2 years ago for a weekend. Fishing was slow but caught one pike in the high 30's and two walleye over three pounds. Tommy Lake is a bit closer. You can likely back the boat into the lake with the ATV.I have never been to Stumpy Lake but I understand you can get in by ATV and is considered a good walleye lake in the area.
