1255054,lassh,2010-12-12 20:25:00,553,"Lount lake, one of the many lakes on the English River system offers excellent walleye, northern and smallmouth fishing. Muskies are rumored to be occasionally caught but by no means are they numerous. I just had to cancel out of my week there (June 25th) with Kenora Air. It may still be available. Give MJ at Kenora Air a call if you are interested or drop me an email. It is a fly in from Kenora, but it is a short flight and reasonably priced. They fly in a cook with you to prepare the weeks meals and there are no guides. They have good boats and motors and there is plenty of water to fish. Good luck finding the right place for your group."
1255686,tcb63,2010-12-15 17:28:00,2,"Hello NP4METo answer your question regarding the fishing between Pipestone and Clearwater, Pipestone has much better bass fishing Clearwater has better walleye fishing. Walleyes are not easy to target in Pipestone. As for lodges there are seven only because Clearwater in the central lake in the chain, the cabins mentioned are 70% American owned and occupied a few weeks per season, the remainder are owned by locals who do not fish a whole lot. Plus if you stay at a lodge on Clearwater you also have easy access to the 5 south lakes that are shallower stained water with very good walleye, pike, bass fishing.The total chain of lakes is about 30,000 acres with 9 lodges total, to put things in perspective Eagle lake is 68,000 acres with 26 lodges and its still a great fishery like our chain. Pipestone-Clearwater just as with Eagle have Ontarios big 5 species to fish for.If you would like a lot more info on Clearwater-Pipestone without dealing with someone who knocks anything thats not in their interest I'd be happy to chat.TerryLittle Moose Lodgewww.littlemoose.com"

1258201,GNO,2010-12-28 21:40:00,153,"The Clearwater/Pipestone Lakes are easy to navigate. Pipestone offers a remote feel and some great multi species fishing. The North end of Pipestone offers the best fishing for walleye and smallouth with alot more structure that is easier to fish. The walleye fishing is very good for decent numbers and excellent trophy potential. Lake trout fishing is good, but can be challenging if you are not familiar with how to fish them. If you have any specific questions, you can email me at [email protected] I can also give you some references if you want to talk others who fish it."

1253251,PJM,2010-12-04 00:08:00,3516,NP4ME Lake of the Woods is a great lake and there are endless possibilities. I fish out of a resort in Morson Canada called Buena Vista Resort and you are fishing the islands. The lake has different personalities depending on when you fish it. www.buenavistaresort.com Also look at the owner's son journal at http://buenavista.livejournal.com/ The pictures are great...............
1253294,MidWestFishman,2010-12-04 09:00:00,44,"I am going to Canada next year for what will be my 13th trip. I have stayed at some top end lodges in Sask and Manitoba. I have decided I have had enough of flying (I admit it- I am highly adverse to flying after what seemd to be a couple of close calls). I made my reservation for next year at Hawk Lake Lodge which I can drive into. While a prior post here may kinda sounds like an advertiement for Hawk Lake, I can say that I talked with some folks that have fished there and they really raved about it. They were very pleased with the fishing, the food , the staff and the accomodations. I also talked with the new owner who seems like a super guy and was very flexible with me on a few items I needed help with. I am not a musky fisherman but enjoy pike and walleye and want to try my hand at smallouth. I also admit that the thought of all the small portage lakes where you have the place all to yourself appealed to me. Wherever you go I would get references and make sure that ALL your questions get answered by the lodge owner. Like someone said there are a lot of very good lodges and to me half the fun is trying to decide where to go. Good luck on your trip."

1253324,Guest,2010-12-04 12:07:00,0,"Staying in Sioux Narrows is a nice place to try for all species. Whitewish bay has Muskie, Pike, Bass, and Lakers and Long and Yellowgirl bays are close-by steady producers for walleye. Try Tomahawk Resort, its a great place to explore the Lake from. They have a webcam is you want a good look at their settings at http://www.tomahawkresort.ca/ReginaBayCamera.cfm. ps Its not too big a water as suggested earlier. Depth charts are very good and there are lots of nice bays to shelter and fish in."

1254914,NP4ME,2010-12-12 10:58:00,378,Anyone have any info about the Clearwater-Pipestone chain? How is the fishing? Remote? Tough to navigate?
1255017,Outfitter17,2010-12-12 18:09:00,127,"Hey NP,I have owned a lodge on the north end of Pipestone for 10 years, the main lodge burned a couple of years ago, so we are not running the camp at this time. If you want to email me at [email protected] I can fill you in on the fishing on Pipestone.Clearwater is not remote at all there is a road accessing most of the west side of the 10-11 mile lake, plus there are 7-8 lodges on it along with 60-75 private cabins. Once you cross the north portage up to pipestone most of the cabins stop, but they can still cross the portage and go fishing for the day.The two lakes are fairly easy to navigate, no marker bouys, but hopefully the main rocks are marked with jugs.Again if you need some more info, just email me."
1255044,Guest,2010-12-12 20:02:00,0,"As I posted earlier I have stayed at the Gateway North Outfitters outpost so I am not familar with the resorts on Clearwater lake. We do launch at a ramp in Clearwater and travel through Clearwater and over the portage into Pipestone lake. Clearwater seems to have several resorts and many cabins. Pipestone lake has one resort called Pipestone Lodge. I have not stayed there but I have stopped and bought gas there. Run by very nice people and they do have both housekeeping and American plan options. Pipestone has several outpost cabins and about 10-15 cabins. Both lakes are fairly easy to navigate and most really serious hazards are marked or discussed . Fishing has always been good, the smallmouth on Pipestone are everywhere and if targeted 50-100 fish days would be possible. Our group usually goes after walleyes in the morning for shorelunch. In the afternoon some in our group target muskies and some go after lake trout. I have been told that walleyes are less common in Clearwater lake and become numerous in Pipestone. Both lake are clear and deep. At the outpost we stay at on the north end of Pipestone we see very little boat traffic and it has a fairly remote feel and look. I had never fished for or caught lake trout. One day(in September) we decided to troll lead core about 35 feet down though a deep water basin looking for really large walleyes. We didn't catch the eyes but the lake trout were really snapping and we caught many lake trout up to 10 pounds. I had a blast and never would of guessed that catching lake trout would be so much fun, I am now a regular lake trout fisherman. Maybe Lucas from Gateway North Outfitters will chime in, he has encyclopedic knowledge about this and many surrounding lakes."
1252708,NP4ME,2010-12-01 10:49:00,378,"Looking for some help on our search for the 2011 trip. Our group is going to be about 8 people this year. We would like to be able to catch a variety of fish...walleye, northern, muskie, and smallmouth. We would like a place that offers an American Plan package. We also prefer a drive-to lodge, but one that is remote as possible. And probably our biggest request is a lodge that does not push a guide. Thanks for the help and I will be looking forward to some recommendations."
1252742,thunderatwork,2010-12-01 12:46:00,79,"muskie and smallmouth will keep you fairly far south, as far as ontario anyways. for bigger northern you need to go farhter north than waters that hold smallmouth. lake of woods comes to mind for good fishing of all four species. but i won't tackle that one without a guide for all four species as its way to big a water for me. I think even lac suel has very limited smallmouth. But i'm sure someone will have a good suggestion for you. good luck"
1252744,wallydave,2010-12-01 12:54:00,2151,"Have you tried a search for ontario drive-in lakes? You will find plenty of sites that way. It will be hard to be able to fish all four species in the same body of water, and the same time frame. Most lakes with walleye have a 3rd weekend in May to start walleye, most muskie lakes will have a later start for muskie season. Good luck on your ""hunt"" for fish!"
1252754,Guest,2010-12-01 13:30:00,0,"Consider Gateway North Outfitters on Pipestone lake. It is a 25 mile boat-in outpost on Pipestone lake, which holds smallmouth, walleye, northern, muskie, lake trout, etc. Cabin will hold up to 8 people. To me a special place and the cost is very reasonable. I really like the chance to be fairly remote at this outpost yet be able to take in my own boat."
1252756,wallydave,2010-12-01 13:41:00,2151,www.canadafishinghunting.comcliff lake has the kinds of fish your looking for.
1252954,joeman79,2010-12-02 14:31:00,417,Big North Lodge out of Minaki should be able to meet your needs.
1252959,SSH,2010-12-02 15:00:00,526,You might try looking at LOTW Northwest Angle area. Good area for all the species you are interested in.
1252994,DonC,2010-12-02 19:04:00,93,"NP4ME, If you want an upscale lodge, with excellent food (has a chef), great smallmouth, muskie, pike and walleye fishing, with some river current in places, and 5 lakes to fish, I recommend Birch Island Resort in Minaki Ontario. www.birchislandresort.com. The best I have done was 100 smallmouth in a day (prespawn). Caught 6 muskie in a week, mainly fishing for smallmouth with tubes, and walleye up to 31 inches. Great boats and very nice accommodations. I have topo maps and have gone there since 1998 so I do not use a guide and mainly fish smallmouth. Have caught a few largemouth, and some black crappie in early June. Don"
1253075,KSauers,2010-12-03 07:52:00,385,I'll second both of these . Minaki has what you're looking for. Is musky high on your list? If not go earlier in June. Better northern fishing then. They go deep when the water warms.
1253078,Guest,2010-12-03 07:59:00,0,"Hawk Lake Lodge would be an excellent fit for you and your party. www.hawk-lake.com Its right off the Trans-Canada 30 miles east of Kenora, so easily accessible. It is on Hawk Lake (2,600 acres) which has a great fishery. However the best part is it has 19 PRIVATE lakes at its disposal. You can fish a different lake each day and be the only boat on the water. They have all species except muskie. Smallmouth (they are famous for), lakers, pike, walleye and even crappie. They have some huge walleye. In fact they hold the world record catch and release walleye (38 inches) and several smallmouth records as well. You will catch hundreds of smallies, all averaging 17 inches or better with many in the 19-21 range. The nice thing about this place is that at any time of year there is always great fishing as they have so many private lakes and its been a catch and release fishery for decades. They do a full american plan, free happy hour, snacks/sodas in the cabins, hot tub, sauna, poker room etc etc."
