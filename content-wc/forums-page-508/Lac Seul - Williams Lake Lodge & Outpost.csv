As well, I'd run a search on this lodge.....you'll probably get info from the last few years. Good luck....I know how important it is to get to the right camp/lodge up north. Rich B"

Williams has pretty good pike fishing, not a lot of walleyes, you must run up the river to fish Lac Seul about 30-45 min trip. That's the drawback, Williams bay has pretty decent fishing, the best areas are Kleiners point, average walleye over 20in. Plenty of locals also as there is a campground down on the end of Williams Lake. No real advantage to the outpost, as the camp goes right by to get to Lac Seul, it's about 2 miles away. Best to have a GPS as there are a few turns to get to Lac Seul, the first year was intimidating. We gave up after 4 years, logging roads last 30-40 miles,if water levels are to low you can't get through the river to Lac Seul, it's only 3-4 ft deep in areas (happened to us one year)-long boat ride to good fishing - to many locals fishing the same areas (they will pull up on the same point your fishing) They had great equipment and boats, we never had a bad trip, we always went in September. My personal best was 40in pike and 28in walleye, I lost a bigger one at the boat, all on Lac Seul. We had a lot of spots in 4 trips, saw a lot of bear and couple of moose. PM me if you need more infoNew Hips"
1260085,JDP,2011-01-06 18:53:00,1457,IMHO Williams Lake Lodge would be worth a try in late August thru September. I have never stayed there but have spoken to the owners who seem to be top notch. My thoughts:1) Lac Seul levels are often at least 3 feet plus higher in late August/September versus May/June. This will make the trip down the creek much easier. You can verify this by researching Lac Seul on: http://www.lwcb.ca/index.html2) There are many deep water structures near where the creek dumps into Lac Seul walleye school up later in the season. Often these fish are often larger. 3) Boat traffic is down significantly after Labor Day.4) A Navionics chip will be of assistance especially to a first timer.Good Luck!

They are located on Chamberlain Narrows, which is the largest Walleye spawning area in Lac Seul so not only are their millions of Walleyes, they catch all the big 7+ pound females that seem to hang around there all year. Because of all the Walleyes, their area is the best for monster pike and muskie. You should check out their fishing off the dock video. www.lacseuloutposts.comAnother cool way to really fish and explore a huge amount of Lac Seul is to rent a floating lodge (giant houseboat). That way you can fish a new part of the lake every day instead of always heading back to a camp. They rent floating lodges out of Sioux Lookout www.siouxfloatinglodges.comGary"
