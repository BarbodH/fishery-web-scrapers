559871,Guest,2006-07-31 16:01:00,0,"I'm heading to Dogtooth Lake (near Kenora, Ontario) this weekend for a week of fishing. I was wondering if anyone has fished this lake especially during this time of year. Does anyone have some tips for targeting walleyes on Dogtooth? I've heard of some people fishing Kilvert Lake which I believe is connected to Dogtooth. Does Kilvert have fishing worth the time to get there? I've looked online for lake maps of Dogtooth with no luck as well. Any help would be greatly appreciated; I know we're looking forward to a week of walleye fishing! Yammy Guy"

If you are staying at Dogtooth resort, Wayne has maps and will help you out as much as possible. If you need further assistance post again and I will help as much as I can. I can try and e-mail you a map. This was my first trip up. Very nice lakes. Caught my first big walleye 26"". You'll have a great time regardless of the fishing. Joe"
