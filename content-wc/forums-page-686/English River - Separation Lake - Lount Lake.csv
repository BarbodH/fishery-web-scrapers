Like to know generally how fishing has been, water levels and qualtiy etc. Heard that one camp was for sale there and another wrecked by a group of fishermen from midwest. thanks"

559778,Guest,2006-07-27 12:03:00,0,getting ready to go up to seperation lake in 2 weeks. have heard water is down about the level it was in 2003. have heard it was for sale.
559878,Guest,2006-07-31 17:18:00,0,"Got back Sunday morning after one week at Separation Rapids campground and one week near Blackduck MN so my information is a week old. Water level is down 7 feet from the last two years. It was the lowest that I have seen in the last six years that I have been going. That said, you can still travel the rapids below the camp. Fishing was good but not what I would call fantastic except for smallmouth was the best I have ever seen. Best walleye was 26"" but caught lots of 22"" fish. Went to Lount lake one day and did very well. Also down to Kettle Falls twice, also did well. Know where you are going though as two lower units were destroyed while I was there. I also have a new nick in mine. I don't think water level is affecting the quanity or size of the fish but some people were struggling as they did not adjust the locations as perhaps the fish might have moved from when water was high last year. I believe the lodge and camp are sold but Jordans will not say. He had all his children there the week I was there and I think it might be a final family trip. Some employees feel that it has been sold. Dave"

Last year the water was darker than ever before, couldn't see more than 6 inches into the water. I suspect that was due to high water last year and stirring things up. Was it cleared up this year ? Sounds like your fishing was about what we have experienced last several years, still good, but it helps to know the area and where to find the fish. It sounds like water levels are particulary lower this year, and personally, I prefer that as usually gets more current which can concentrate the fish sometimes. But you need to know this area or leave your motor behind. It should be interesting this fall. Many folks up there this year ? Where did you fish in Lount ? I knew the place was for sale, will be curious to see who ends up with it. take care and thanks for the information"

We basically fished where Separation and Lount connected and around 400 hole. Found points that had current flowing past and walleye were stacked on the downstream side of the point. The campground only had my wife and I and one group of 4 from Rockford IL. during the week. Three groups came in on Sat and we left on Sunday. > >"
559994,Guest,2006-08-03 21:00:00,0,fishing better improve or will have to go to Manitoba or Great Lakes. Low levels will be fun. Lots of reason to use correct maps. Leeches or crawlers working?
