559888,Guest,2006-07-31 23:17:00,0,I am in the beginning stages of planning a trip to this area next summer. We have been to Lac Seul five times and even though this is an outstanding lake we want to explore a new area. We like to fish mainly for walleyes and northern pike and are looking for a drive-to camp. We bring our own boat and cook our own meals. Any thoughts on a place to stay would be appreciated. In my mind I would like to stay on a lake with good fishing and also fish several nearby lakes. Lake Nipigon looks HUGE on a map. We fish out of a 17 foot Alumacraft Trophy with a 70 hp motor. Would we be limited to smaller area lakes with that rig? Are there smaller lakes or rivers in the area with good fishing? Any thoughts or tips from someone who has fished this area would be welcomed. Thanks in advance.

559903,Guest,2006-08-01 14:59:00,0,Nipigon Lake is primarily known as a trout lake. Especially known for trophy brook (speckled) trout.

559933,Guest,2006-08-01 22:34:00,0,If you don't mind me asking where do you camp? We are probably looking for a place with cabins but might consider camping. Are the locations you mentioned on Nipigon? Have you fished any smaller lakes in the area. Thanks for any help.
559990,Guest,2006-08-03 19:59:00,0,We camp at the indian resorvation at Gull River.Its on the West side and end of lake.
559996,Mr Ranger,2006-08-03 21:27:00,272,This camp is a bit north of Nipigon but you might want to check it out. Five hours north of Thunder Bay. Have not fished surrounding lakes because we did not have to. We use the camp 16 foot boats which work fine. I have been up four years running and really enjoy it. Great fishing and great owners. They offer campground and cabins. Not much of a camper myself and use the cabins but love this lake for Walleye and Lake Trout. Check it out if you wish. Tell him the old guy from Wausau sent you!www.osullivansrainbow.com Good Luck
