Never thought of it being a problem before, but with some border rule changes, etc; does anyone know if that will be a issue at the Ontario border ? I ran a search for propane, but nothing addressing this noted. Thanks, Rich B"

They would have stopped us if its against the Law. Since you mentioned, I better check before we go this year.:-)"

559799,Guest,2006-07-28 07:35:00,0,Just returned a few weeks ago with a smaller propane tank. Had no trouble either way. On way into canada I had to open the boat to expose it. no questions were asked.
559800,Guest,2006-07-28 08:46:00,0,I stopped bringing my propane tanj when I saw the camp I stayed at had a few extra. It might be worth a call to see if they have gas grills if so thet probably have extra tanks and gas you could use.
559805,Guest,2006-07-28 11:08:00,0,They caught a local here in NW Ontario with a Propane tank filled with fillets. He had a spot for Ice and it was insulated. Fines were huge.

He did not say a word about it or the two cans of diesel fuel beside them. Did ask about booze, tobacco, bait. Answered all the question truthly and he said to have a good trip."
559882,Guest,2006-07-31 20:02:00,0,What kind of idiot would take the time to make a fake cooler and smuggle fish. It really isnt that expensive to buy over the counter.:banging:
