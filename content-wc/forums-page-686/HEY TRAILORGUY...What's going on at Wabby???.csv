559248,Guest,2006-07-10 23:20:00,0,"Dave, I had a good time last week with your group...very nice people. I'm glad you guys found the walleyes. Don't feel too bad about the rest of the week, it was tough for everyone. Hopefully next week when I'm up it will be alot better. Tell Rocky to watch out for those hooks! See ya next year bud. Mike"

559988,Guest,2006-08-03 18:15:00,0,"I was on the lake from July 22-28 and the fishig was very good. I didn't know what to expect after the dismal walleye fishing over the 4th of July, but I was optimistic that it couldn't be much worse! We were in luck, we probably had the best walleye trip I've ever experienced in my life. The fish were out on the reefs and very active. The first day a lady in our group caught a 32"" monster on a jig/minnow, and it never slowed down all week. We caught most of our walleys trolling crankbaits out in the deep water adjacent to the reefs and did really well. Others stuck to jig/minnow and did equally well, while others pulled spinners w/crawlers and had great success. The walleye fishing that week left me speechless. As many know I prefer to northern fish, but with the walleye bite what it was, I barely casted for northerns all week. We did manage several large (38-41"") northerns out in the deep water on our cranks while fising walleyes that made the trip even better. If fishing was as good everytime we go as it was last week I'd never come back home!"
559043,Guest,2006-07-03 13:43:00,0,Looking for a Wabaskang Report...how's the fishing? Craig
559086,rudy,2006-07-05 14:32:00,36,"i was there last week.fished out of tall pines camp.fishing was good once we figured them out.there was huge mayfly hatch that absolutely ruined all of our normal spots.we tried them all with very little luck,they just weren't there.however we stumbled upon the fact that when the wind blew into ANY island point or slow tapering shore line you could easily catch them.the trick was to use 3/32 ounce(or as light as you can fish) crappie jigs tipped with 1/3 of a nightcrawler. stay out in 10-12 fow and pitch it up into 4-6 fow!you could see bottom in 10 but those fish were oblivious to the sunlight or anything else and were that shallow as long as there was a ripple on the water.if you moved over them they would scatter but return soon.when the wind quit you would see that there were thounsands of minnows tight the shoreline rocks EVERYWHERE.this week might be totally different but there were flies still hatching on saturday so it should hold for awhile. this pattern produced fish for us everyday (except the first day)and i had a 22,25 and 27 inch fish doing this. good luck!"
559121,Guest,2006-07-07 01:17:00,0,Thanks for the update...sounds like a Mayfly hatch of the century! Craig
559161,Guest,2006-07-08 19:58:00,0,"I just got back today from a week up there out of Jim @ Julies's. The walleye fishing was tough to say the least. We had the already mentioned mayfly hatch to contend with and also a lightning storm for the ages on Fri night that I think shut down the norhern fishing for at least 2 if not 3 days. I fished every place imaginable trying to find active walleyes, and didn't have alot to show for it. The only constistent producer was up in Gawley's bay in the weeds, and even that wasn't great. Like Rudy said, hitting wind blown points produced for us also, but we were pitching jig/minnows. To tell you how off the walleyes were I've got a friend that fishes there alot and he was up this week also and he couldn't get anything going also, and he is an awesome walleye stick! With alot of spot jumping we were able to catch limits and enough for 5 meals of walleyes, but it took alot more work than usual. The northern fishing was relly good towards the middle of the week with our boat putting a 40, 39 1/2, 39, 38 (2), 36(4), and several other 34 and 35's over the side rails. The big girls were not afraid to hit the big musky baits with authority, whether casted or trolled. I think anyone going up in the next couple weeks will have alot better walleye fishing as the mayfly hatch ends and things get back to normal. Mike"
559162,Guest,2006-07-09 00:36:00,0,How's the Smallie action been this year Mike? Craig
559179,Guest,2006-07-09 18:18:00,0,"The smallies have been really good, for the guys who fish them. If you target them, go early mornings with topwater around any rocks that have pencil reeds amongst them and you usually will find fish. I have also seen guys doing well pitching ringworms and twisters into the reeds and rock piles and catching fish. I've always had my best smallie success up in North Bay (McCleouds) but I know the area north of Peffley's camp is pretty good also."
559180,Trailerguy,2006-07-09 18:52:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I just got back this PM. I had a house full, all the kids, grandkids. We didn't spend much time on Wabby this trip, even then the kids had good luck with pike in the weeds for a few evenings. We were splitting up most evenings in two boats. That storm the other Friday nite was real flashy, I figured it would shut down the walleyes, and the kids (young and dumb, heh,heh), were up to some serious adventures. It's been a few years since my daughter-in-law could get off work to make the trip, so I wanted her to catch some serious fish. She caught her biggest walleye and pike to date last week. We went out on the logging roads SW of Wabby, to some smaller remote lakes, where the water is more stained. One was an hour out on the four wheelers and then dragging a boat in to boot. It is actually used as a fly in lake, but I knew there was a way in... We went to it three days in a row and it never took more than an hour to drown 3 dozen minnows. 14-20"" eye's were thick hanging around the wind blown points, even when the wind dropped and the sun was bright in mid day. I don't remember catching so many fish in one week for a number of years like we did last week. I talked to some of the locals during the week who were fishing Wabby, they were catching some Walleyes but not any excess, like we did in the bush. You gotta love those little lakes that don't get much pressure, they can save your trip sometimes. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
559229,Guest,2006-07-10 16:53:00,0,"Big Mike, Thanks again to you, Chad, his dad, and the rest of your buddies for all the great advice on where and how to fish last week. You guys saved our week as we were really struggling on where to find fish. Rocky, Dave, and myself had a lot of fun tossing the ""big baits"" Friday after you left. Didn't catch any big ones but had some good strikes. Hope we can all do it again next year. The last we saw of Reid, he was having a great time playing with his cousin and helping out Uncle Jim. I have a feeling this time apart may be harder on his mom and dad than it is on him. Take care. Dave, Rosie, the other Dave, Sharon, Rocky"
559238,AB,2006-07-10 19:33:00,61,Hey Trailerguy and Big Mike - sounds like summer is a little early this year. Glad you guys had a good time and got onto some fish. What's the berry picking prospects looking like at the end of this month?
559242,Trailerguy,2006-07-10 21:31:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I checked out an old, proven spot while we were there. It looked pretty dismal, 1 bush in 10 had berries, 1 ripe berry, 1 half sized white berry and a couple green ones the size of bb's in a clump. A freind had checked another spot, and he was optumistic that rain (which came while we were there) would produce a crop. So I'm thinking they are going to be spotty this year, definatly not a bumper crop where I was looking. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
