(Aug 5-12 and Aug 12-19). He just recently had surgery, and is not physically ready/able yet to be able to do the trip. I have paid $800 in reservations, which I will forfeit if we don't take a trip there this year ($200 per person per week reservation price @ 2 weeks = $800). I talked to a fishing buddy of mine, who might be able to go with me on the 12th-19th, but nothing is definite yet. So, I guess I'm ""selling"" these reservations at a very reduced rate, (maybe even giving them away) because I most likely won't be able to go, and the deposit is non refundable. If somebody here is interested in going, please let me know. I'm trying to recover some of my investment if possible, but I'd really like to help Jerry and Ellie keep those cabins full, if possible (since this is 2 years in a row now that I've had to cancel / reschedule trips at their resort due to family health issues). Total trip cost is about $400 per person / week, so if I end up just ""giving away"" my deposit to someone who can go, you'd be getting the trip at half price. Contact me if interested, ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder [email protected] cell 608-333-1011"
