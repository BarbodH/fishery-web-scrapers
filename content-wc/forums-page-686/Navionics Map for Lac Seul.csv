559921,prov1900,2006-08-01 20:14:00,544,"I bought one and havent used it. People say it is the way to go, but don't solely depend on it for navigation. I have looked at it on my GPS and compared to what I had in the past at Lac Seul, i.e., a blank screen with a line, it is well worth the $150."

Takes the worry out of getting lost and lets you focus on enjoying the lake. Well worth it, plus it allows you to explore other lakes in the region if you so choose. Best of luck."

Also thoughts on best place to buy this unit and software. I am going back up the end of the month and need to make a dicision. Thanks"
