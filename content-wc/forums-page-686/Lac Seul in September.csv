559910,Guest,2006-08-01 17:02:00,0,Heading to Lac Seul the second week of September. Taking a housboat (pulling 2 boats)from Hudson to Chamberlain Narrows and would like to know approximate distance and travel time. Also would like to know what to expect in terms of weather and if the walleyes will be in deep or shallow water. Thanks!
559918,Guest,2006-08-01 19:49:00,0,"ITS 30 TO 33 MILES, I WOULD THINK A HALF DAY WOULD GET YOU THERE, WATER WILL BE ABOUT 65 DEGREES AND THE FISH AROUND 25-35 DEEP. THATS MY BEST GUESS A MONTH AND A HALF IN ADVANCE OF YOUR DEPARTURE. TAKE LARGE MINNOWS WITH 5 DOZEN PER 2 GUYS PER DAY, THAT TIME OF YEAR THEY WORK GREAT."
559943,Guest,2006-08-02 09:09:00,0,Think you would be better off in main part of Lac Seul. The Chamberlin Narrows area and north of it is a great spring and early summer zone but late season you want to be south of there in bigger water and be working deep water around humps and drops. just my opinion....would be nice to hear what others think. One great late season spot is Bray Lake...on Lac Seul. Holds a lot of fish and big fish in August and September.
