They were all perch. Walleyes often choked up small perch when caught and in the their stomachs I often found perch when cleaning them.We even saw some small perch schools in the shallow weedy areas when fishing pike. I had no idea that Lac Suel was such a strong perch forage base lake. So my question is this. Are there any BIG perch in this lake? Big as in ""Devils Lake"" size perch? And if so can you give any advice on where to find them and tactics. Next year I would like to take some afternoons to hunt for them if the big ones are out there. I bet bored with fishing walleyes all day for 6 days. And I would love to bring home some big perch."
559940,Guest,2006-08-02 08:40:00,0,Isn't it illegal to use Perch for bait? I thought that NO GAME FISH could be used for bait. If anybody else knows anything different I would appreciatte their comments.
559942,Guest,2006-08-02 08:51:00,0,I would guess that it was also illegal for the camp owner to trap the perch minnows.
559947,Noel,2006-08-02 10:07:00,115,I cant say whether it is illegal but I would think not. He has a minnow dealers license and runs several traps. Do you think all minnow dealers sort out their minnows to remove perch? I havent stayed at any other camps so I cant say what the minnows look like at other camps.
559948,JDP,2006-08-02 10:38:00,1457,"The Ontario Fishing Regulations specify the fish that may be used as bait. (The""Minnow Family"", Mudminnows, white suckers, sticklebacks, etc.) Perch are not included in the list of fish. Resident Ontario Anglers with a valid fishing license may may capture their own bait-fish for their personal use. There are restrictions on methods and quantities. Non-Resident Anglers cannot take bait-fish by any means."

559951,Noel,2006-08-02 10:54:00,115,"RevRider, It is a great fishery and that is why I spend the mornings catching eyes and the rest of the day pursuing pike and smallies. What's it to you? But if i do go back to camp to play games with my buddies I will be sure to invite you since you seem to know all about it."
559953,Guest,2006-08-02 12:23:00,0,"noel, the largest perch i've caught in the ear falls area is 11"". hardly a monster. and that is rare. usually smaller."
559954,Noel,2006-08-02 12:47:00,115,"Whit, thanks. That is the kind of feedback I was asking for."
