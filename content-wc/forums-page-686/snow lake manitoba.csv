I know the owner of Wekusko lodge (Tony Brew) your best bet is to fish Tramping lake which he guides on, its a great fishery.There's many more lakes in this area that have great fishing.

Snow lake itself has good walleye fishing stocked trout lakes its my favourite area in Manitoba to fish,Flin Flon is not far either another great area to fish. The mine is in shutdown mode in Snow lake. NM"

Want small eaters? - fish Snow Lake itself and stop by the Diamond Willow for lunch or a pop. Also, if you can, while in the area, fish Reed Lake and move on over to Athapapusko (by Flin Flon 1-1/2 hours away) for great deep water lake trout action."
