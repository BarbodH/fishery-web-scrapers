559987,Guest,2006-08-03 17:55:00,0,The fire ban is still ongoing. It's very dry up there right now.
559989,Guest,2006-08-03 19:36:00,0,The fire bas was lifted a couple days ago. Heres a link....http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/affmb/f...RFZmapeng.html

Use EXTREME caution and use any other method possibly than an open fire. Just because a government department allows it, doesn't mean it should be. The ban was lifted because ""average rainfall in the district"" was adequate accoring to their table of stats."
