559957,Guest,2006-08-02 13:28:00,0,"Not knowing where you would be travelling from....I would suggest Gullrock Chain of Lakes near Red Lake, Ontario. The fishing year after year is excellent. September is a great time to be there as the walleyes are feeding more aggressively as they prepare for tougher winter months ahead. I would recommend either Golden Hook Camp or Wrights Wilderness. Have stayed at Golden Hook and very much enjoyed our experience. Gook Luck....."

559975,Mike Kansas,2006-08-03 09:20:00,1463,You should look at the English River below the Dam at Ear Falls. We have been going to Little Canada Camp for the last two years in September and the fishing has been excellent. The rates are very competitive and the camp owner provides excellent service. The Walleye move up the river to the Dam area in the fall to forage up for the winter and it provides an excellent opportunity to catch good numbers of fish and good size of fish. If you have any questions please email me. I can help you with a map of the areas to fish.www.littlecanadacamp.com Mike Kansas
