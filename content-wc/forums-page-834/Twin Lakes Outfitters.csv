We live in southern Indiana and the owner is from north central Indiana. A friend of ours has been going there for about 16-18 years and we finally decided to try it. Wish we had decided that many years and dollars before. The other outfitters are forrest lodge and bear paw lodge. They both have web sites, but Caribou Lake Lodge doesn't."
536706,Guest,2004-01-18 16:55:00,0,Twin Lakes Outfitters is awesome. Bill and Michelle will treat you like a $million and the fishing is beyond imagination. They have also been replacing the old cabins with new cabins and full size comfortable beds. We were there in August. I am booking Patience Lake for next summer. A trapper using the cabin when a storm hit him pulled a world record walleye out of the ice. It was over 30 pounds and the guy choppied it up to feed his sled dogs. Bill was just telling me the yesterday. www.twin-lakes-air.com Gary The Trout King

The times I have I was given some great info that helped me plan a succesful fly-in. I am interested in booking with Twin Lakes out of Nakina and was wondering if anybody had any experience with their services good or bad. Thanks in advance boys. Chromer"
536637,BuckeyeWilly,2004-01-15 17:31:00,41,"Chromer, i flew in with them one time about 12 years ago. Flew into their camp on Kayedon Lake, 1st week of June. Nice cabin & a nice older gentleman running Twin Lakes. Wonder if it is still under the same management? Not sure he had his own planes because he used Leuenbergers to fly us in that week. I have also flown in with Leuenbergers a few times which is located on the same lake - Cordingly, I believe. Need any other info let me know. Willie"
536640,Guest,2004-01-15 19:29:00,0,"Thanks for the reply Willie. I beleive they changed management a few years back and now have their own planes, an otter and a cessna. How did you guys make out when you fished Kaydon?"
536642,BuckeyeWilly,2004-01-15 20:46:00,41,"Chromer, the year we hit kayedon the ice was out late. We had extremely high water and some rough weather (snow) the first 2 days. Walleye were tough to locate. However, the weather improved the rest of the week and the 'eye action really picked up. We located most fish any where we found current. Nothing big but lots of fish. The pike fishing was oustanding. They were back in the bays hanging around any new emerging weed growth. Used johnson silver minnows and white trailer tails. What a blast!! We also caught a few speckled trout where the river left the lake. If memory serves me caught them on small mepps spinners. His cabin was paneled on the inside and very well kept but again this was a few years back. Leuenberger also has a nice log cabin on this lake - I believe seperate bedrooms, etc. Looked real nice from the outside. You also have access to Ogoki Lake (I believe that was the name) which is a huge body of water. All in all it was a good trip, run by nice people. But I have to admit I have enjoyed everyplace I have stayed in Ontario and enjoyed each owner. Lots of great people."

536651,Guest,2004-01-16 06:56:00,0,"Bill and Michelle Faring bought Twin Lakes three years ago and they are replacing the cabins with new ones and really trying to fix the places up. You can see an example of the new cabins on their web site at http://twin-lakes-air.com/ New cabins are large with amenities like solar lights separate bedrooms, etc."
536659,Guest,2004-01-16 09:25:00,0,Have not used twin lakes but have used AWO out of Nakina 8 times. Migh take a look at their services. Six different lakes with cabins holding up to 8 people. This is a good operation with great fishing and great value for dollar spent. I can help with maps and fish locations. Dave [email protected]
536662,Guest,2004-01-16 13:59:00,0,"Forgot to mention, Twin Lakes doesn't operate from Cordingly Lake, they are on Lower Twin Lake about 6 miles out of Nakina"
536664,Guest,2004-01-16 18:07:00,0,"We used Twin Lakes in 2002. Went to Saga Lake in late July (last full week), fished for walleye and caught 14 inch up to 26 inch (only one at 26 released). Most were typical 16-20 inch. The cabin on Saga didn't have running water or solar lighting at that time, but Bill and Michelle were ok to deal with. Boats had 8 horse motors, but the boats did have swivel seats. Planes were ok, but didn't seem as well maintained as Leuenbergers (we had gone with them the previous 12 years). Bill's prices were much better for 3 people, than Leuenbergers. All in all no complaints and I would use their service again, but went to a drive to lake in 2003 and caught plenty of fish and the cost was extremely low."
