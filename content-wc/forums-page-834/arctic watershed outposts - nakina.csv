We did fish Melchett a few times in the river that exits the lake and the area between Melchett and Kap. Also the point out from the old fuel dump on Melchett. I am a lot more familiar with Kap and would be glad to mark a map for you if you'd like. Don't know about the outfitter, but I don't think they have their own planes anymore. Seems to me they contract with Leuenbergers for their flying now."

We fish with artifical lures and never used live bait. With six men on Kap in ""01, 6 on Melchett '02 and 8 Melchett '03 we caught and released over 5,171 eyes and pike. We keep eaters only, and fish using conservation license and don't bring any home. Do have maps available."
