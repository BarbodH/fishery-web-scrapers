536714,Guest,2004-01-19 06:56:00,0,"Our company is disappointed that the Fire Inspector (the Ontario Government)spent only 2 days inspecting the property and then over 3 months deliberating AFTER they turned over the site. We feel they should have spent the time to conduct a more intense investigation. Within one hour of the papers reporting there was no insurance on the property - the police left the site. The Fire Inspector left shortly there after. The firefighters on site told us that there was no indication of arson so we took it upon ourselves to hire an independant firm to conduct an investigation - this was only after we were told the investigation was over. In the second week of November, the fire inspector and agents from the Electrical Safety Authority informed us they need to return to the site to conduct more test. We agreed. The problem was there was really nothing left to inspect - demolition had already begun as the site had been turned over. In early November, it was reported through the CP that the Fire Inspector had ruled out arson - what else could it have been? There was no lightening in the area that night. Also, we have heard from the citizens of Minaki that there were continued electrical issues all summer long, such as transformers making popping sounds and a few computers were damaged through power surges. Our investigators found in a very short time several electrical issues on the site, even after the cleanup had started. Everything from falsified Inspection Certificates before the power was turned back on in the Summer of 2002, to a 3 year old wasp nest in one of the transformers. If they were physically on site to inspect, I think they would have found the wasp nest. What is the definition of a Government cover-up? Phil Archer Owner - Minaki Lodge"

Wasp nests are a paper like material, they don't conduct electricity, if you live in NWO you got one somewhere on your property. Quite obviously the fire inspector didn't rule out arson, only the rumor mill spun that out. Quack,Quack, Waddle, Waddle, Quack, Quack............"
536716,Guest,2004-01-19 09:04:00,0,Aghhh...good ole TRAILERPARKGUY is flappin (or quacking) again...nowwhere does it say a wasp nest conducted electricity - the point was that there was obviously no maintenance done on the transformer. And my understanding is that many residents DID complain. What?? Do you have stock in Hydro One?

536729,Guest,2004-01-19 17:14:00,0,Just out of curiousity - what is your hate on for the ownership group of the Lodge? You seem to be a regular MINAKI BASHER! Over the last year your post are just so filled with contempt! Why? Accusing us of burning down our own Lodge is nothing short of moronic!! You truly are showing no class. Iowa PIG farmer? Sorry to insult the fine Pig Farmers of Iowa!!! I spent the entire summer at the Lodge - I know there were some issues - some our fault and some others but at least we tried!! We put over $4 Million into the property fulfilling a dream. Have you ever been able to be this passionate about something? Didn't think so! We didn't just sit around spewing stuff on a keyboard of a computer. More than you can say?? Why don't you tell the fine people of WC the real reason you are such a miserable SOB and then we will understand. Get it all out once and for all.
536731,Trailerguy,2004-01-19 17:28:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Well now there you go Turbo, spinning out of control, without a clue, reverting to name calling because your spinning routine isn't up to snuff. Take a deep breath, then look in a mirror, you might just start to see what the rest of the world see's."
536733,Guest,2004-01-19 19:10:00,0,EVEN MORE MORONIC..........
536735,Trailerguy,2004-01-19 19:22:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]Well I guess if that's what you saw in the mirror...........Who am I to argue?
535501,Guest,2003-10-26 18:26:00,0,"interested observer nailed it IMO. The lodge burnt clears the path to cover the point in condos. IMO this act of God has been very kind to Archer, replacement insurance on the lodge structure itself notwithstanding. The so-called loss on the structure can be made up many-fold by re-developing the site. Just idle speculation of course."

Getting the locals involved in the redevelopment planning is a stroke of genius. How can they possibly fight a plan that they've helped put together?"
535569,Guest,2003-10-30 21:33:00,0,It was actually thier idea - this effects the town a great deal. Alot of people there make money when the lodge is open.

535608,Guest,2003-11-06 19:38:00,0,Nothing really yet...investigators are coming back out Tuesday to look at a couple more things! They did say they ruled out arson- that being said no excelerant was found. I was at the lodge today for the first time since the fire - wow - I have never seen anything like that before. How's the fishing?? Where have you been??
535609,Reels,2003-11-06 21:40:00,2876,"Fishing is good, I just got back from Lake Erie at the the WC get together. Great fishery. Never caught so many big fish in one day other than here. I will be back in Minaki in June. If your around, drop me an e-mail. If the dockside is open, I'll buy you a martini. Ron <{{}}><"
536708,Trailerguy,2004-01-18 17:40:00,1407,"Well the Thunder Bay paper had an article today, here's some high lights: TOP STORIES Search News Archive Minaki Lodge fire cause undetermined By Staff - The Chronicle-Journal January 18, 2004 And The Canadian Press An investigation by the Ontario Fire Marshal’s office wasn’t able to determine a cause for a devastating fire Oct. 12 that destroyed much of the majestic Minaki Lodge north of Kenora. “I’m not saying it’s not an arson, and I’m not saying it’s an accidental fire,” lead investigator Guy Degagne said Friday of the blaze that leveled the main building of the historic lodge. “I’m saying it’s undetermined, meaning that there’s not enough facts from the fire scene itself to go one way or another.” Investigators were able to determine the blaze started in the west wing of the main lodge. The Fire Marshal’s report said electrical failure from wiring or appliances could not be ruled out, although a high-voltage power line was eliminated as a possible cause. ;) IMHO if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck............."
536709,Guest,2004-01-18 19:25:00,0,"No Insurance.... subtrades, suppliers not paid, out of town business owners ....... HMMMMM ...... Sounds like payback to me. Glad nobody was hurt in the fire or fighting it."
536711,Guest,2004-01-18 20:04:00,0,"Pure speculation now , on everybodys part. To however lay blame or speculate blame on anybody is wrong. It was a fire that was rather unfortunate but is now history. Instead of all the pointing of fingers and bad mouthing that has been going on, we should all now move forward & support the Lodge Property - whatever the future holds for it. It is a beautiful property in a beautiful part of our world. Let's all enjoy what it has to offer. Good Fishen Rob"
535404,Trailerguy,2003-10-16 15:35:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]When the owner had a ""vision"" for the future of the property, it doesn't mean he shared it with the help,or the rest of the world, eh? ;)"
535406,River_eye,2003-10-16 16:12:00,1486,"Not bad Rod. Was talking with Josh the guide this past weekend and he had some funny stories to tell me about the rest of the season after I left, including one about a BMW and also the final party. Sounds like I missed some fun times."
535408,River_eye,2003-10-16 19:29:00,1486,"It does seem also convenient that the fire was started in such a way that the hotel complexes were spared (fire started right where hotels and lodge are connected, and wind is blowing away from the hotel and towards the lodge."
535429,kenora99,2003-10-19 21:35:00,3,"Without the old lodge Minaki is now just condo's with a 9 hole golf course. The Minaki residents who worked there for the past few years will certainly miss the place for the income, but remember it was closed for a good number of years, and was probably never missed. I cannot see the locals wanting the place to go down the drain either, as it would bring needed income, exposure to that are of NW Ontario which is certainly needed. But not everyone would look at it that way. Tourism is the main base in this area, lumber is no longer the major source for any communities in NW Ontario, and that includes Kenora. By better and more promotion of tourism we will build these areas into World Class places to visit and keep returning. I hope Minaki does open with a nice lodge/restaurant/etc..again. What the heck why not. If it is good for Minaki, it is also good for other immediate communities. To build a new Main Lodge of quality is a good $3-5 million bucks to make it fit in. One has to consider other places that are available in the area. But this area really has no real quality dining establistment except for a few on Lake of the Woods. At least not that I have access to without a vehicle. Kenora has nothing in quality either. We shall see what happens with Minaki. I am curious. No one losses on this except the Archer Group, and I find that itself interesting."
535439,Guest,2003-10-20 21:42:00,0,"Sad to see it go. As story in Grand Forks Hearld. Seems so to have plan but it was reported that rebuilding was $ out of question but maybe new condos, sell lots, privet homes. nice fast plans in one week time. The lodge was on prime land big $500,000+ lots. Sounds fishy. I never stayed there but allways drive by to look at the beatifull lodge."
535443,IaCraig,2003-10-21 11:52:00,434,"Accidental or arson, it is still sad. IaCraig"
535446,River_eye,2003-10-21 14:27:00,1486,"But what's sadder? The fact that such a grand old building burnt down, or the shape that it was in before the Archer Group took hold of it. Bottom line, if the place can't make money, it has no future. I'd rather see it go out with a bang and be remembered as a beautiful historic building, than let it waste away and be known as an ugly neglected property."
535455,IaCraig,2003-10-22 16:11:00,434,"River-eye, to me what is sad is that there will be no future generations able to build memories of the Lodge or experience the history it holds. Seeing historical items in person gives me feelings I can't get from a book. I don't care if it is an indian arrow head that I hold in my hands, or a fallen down old miners shack in the middle of the forest somewhere. Being able to touch it gives me an appreciation for past ways of life that a picture in a book doesn't. Showing my age. IaCraig"
535456,River_eye,2003-10-22 18:47:00,1486,"Craig, I agree with you about being able to touch history, and I have childhood as well as recent memories of the place. My argument is, I'd rather remember it for what it once was, than know it for what it has become in recent years."
535476,Stillwater,2003-10-24 12:25:00,87,"Hey guys, I don't know anything about the place, but, Interested Observer was right. It may appear that everyone loses here but that may not be so. In my hometown of Stillwater, MN we used to have the old Territorial Prison, built before Minnesota was a state, Cole Younger, a member of the Jesse James gang was once the editor of the prison newspaper. It had been vacant for about 75 years and was a HUGE liabilty. The city of Stillwater has been trying to sell it for YEARS but every developer ran afoul of the Historical Preservation Society. Last year some goofy kid burned it down while investigating rumors of withcraft/haunted building nonsense. The city of Stillwater now writes off the loss and the developers now have a clean slate to work with on a VERY developable piece of prime real estate. While many people are weeping in public (mostly history buffs who don't contribute to the city treasury), there are also those who will say (off the record of course) that the little pyro was a godsend. Scott"
535386,Guest,2003-10-15 13:22:00,0,"The main building at Minaki Lodge burned to the ground on Monday. Apparently, there was no insurance. An investigation is underway."
535389,Vitreum,2003-10-15 16:51:00,221,"somebody help me here. don't know much about minaki. just what i've read here. as i understand some outfit bought it for a couple of million dollars and spent several million more to improve it and get it going again. my question is this. what kind of lender would let it go uninsured? mortgage lenders down here in the states will buy insurance if it lapses and charge it back to the buyer. was this some sort of private investment group that put up the money? if so, the management was terribly negligent to the investors. this saga just gets stranger and stranger."
535391,Guest,2003-10-15 19:42:00,0,Archer Group held the mortgage - we had a mortgage on our own property!
535392,River_eye,2003-10-15 20:15:00,1486,"From what I've read in the papers, Archer group owned it, and invested it's own money so it's the only party that loses financially."
535394,River_eye,2003-10-15 20:26:00,1486,"Turbo, it's funny that Archer was shopping for insurance. If he had bought it within the last week or so, there would be a lot of fingers pointed at him, instead, nobody would suspect him of burning a multi-million dollar building that he owns and is uninsured. I'm interested in your comments on this, but in my opinion, the Archer group isn't in as bad of shape as it would appear. The lodge and Archers name are somwhat tarnished, whether deserved or not, but now that Archer has taken a loss, people are feeling somwhat sorry for him, and would probably be quicker to support his future development of the property. Condo's or somthing to replace the lodge will be approved a lot easier, and with the lodge not in existance, the property has a better chance of making money than it ever did."

Wayne D"
535401,Guest,2003-10-16 12:35:00,0,"I wouldn't feel too sorry for the people of Minaki. Believe it or not most of the locals around there are probably happy that the lodge burned down. As I understand it (I could be wrong...just what I've been told by several locals over the years), the locals played a pretty big roll in the failure of the lodge over the years......I just don't get it. Sorry to hear about the fire Turbo....it's a sad situation. That lodge can never be replaced."
535402,Guest,2003-10-16 14:25:00,0,"There's certainly a puzzle piece missing here. The whole thing smacks of arson, but who's to gain? The fire was way too convienent, no guests to harm, sprinklers just happened to be drained, business was in the tank, fire in the middle of the night so response would take a little longer... One explanation could be that the owners were stuck with a white elephant losing money that also happened to be a historic landmark, something difficult to get permission to remove, and with it out of the way, redevelopment of the site is now more easily accomplished. And if the owners aren't trying to collect on insurance, there should be no fraud charges to contend with. The lack of insurance helped out there. But this is just speculation. Sometimes a fire is the easiest way to get rid of these pesky historic buildings, government regulations and all."
535403,Guest,2003-10-16 14:44:00,0,"There is a money making plan, I tell you! Lemme see.. ""I can't afford insurance, so I'll burn the s.o.b."""
