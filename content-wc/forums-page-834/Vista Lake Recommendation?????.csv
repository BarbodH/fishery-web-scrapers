536663,Guest,2004-01-16 16:32:00,0,Has anyone been on Vista Lake outside of Savant Lake. Owned by Vista Lake outfitters. Just looking for a report. Might be going there. Thanks
536666,Guest,2004-01-16 19:17:00,0,A group of us were there about 10 years ago and when we got to our outpost cabin the propane fridge did not work. The caretaker at the lake told us the camp owners new it was not working before we came and did not tell us. Fortunately there was another cabin about 1 mile away owned by the same people which was empty and we took our milk and meats there and when we wanted perrishable food we traveled the mile to get it. We felt the owners shoud have told us about the fridge and could have given us some ice for our coolers. We would not go back to Vista lake Outfitters
