536582,Guest,2004-01-14 10:17:00,0,"Isn't time that Americans start to #### about Canada, & Canadians start *****ing about the U.S.??"
536583,MK,2004-01-14 10:25:00,322,"Welcome to Indiana. Too cold to want to stay outside very long. Frozen ground but no lakes frozen enough to safely ice fish. No snow cover to snowmobile. In other words, typical depressing winter in Indiana. Keep looking at those fishing photos and keep your chin up, another 3 months and it'll be raining every other day. BTW, did you get the email I sent with the builders names ?"
536588,Ivy,2004-01-14 13:19:00,556,"MK, Yes I did . Thanks for the information. Ivy"
536605,Stehle,2004-01-15 04:55:00,95,"How about the ""tree rat"" posts a couple of years ago? That could well have been the funniest running thread ever."
536622,NateW,2004-01-15 11:12:00,96,"But seriously, I once made the mistake of asking for favorite fish camp recipes. Then I made the mistake of asking for a notification when a new message was added. My boss was in my office and then my e-mail started ""BING!--BING!--BING!"" as about 20 notification hit me in 30 minutes. Don't think I'll do that again...."
536631,Guest,2004-01-15 14:28:00,0,The one back about 4 years where a guy had mice in his tracker boat...they had pee-ed in it and the aluminum was corroded all the way through. Yah...like that could happen!
536668,Reels,2004-01-17 06:46:00,2876,"Yep, the mice one was good. One of my favorites was Erico and his squirrels. <{{}}><"
536550,Ivy,2004-01-13 18:02:00,556,"It's cold. It's gloomy. I'm stuck in Indiana looking at a picture of my Dad an I from a Fly-out we took a couple years. And it got me wondering What would be the "" Mother of all Cabin fever questions?"" D.W.I's ? Potatoes? What? Ivy"
536551,Mike M (Sask),2004-01-13 18:05:00,374,Soooo...Which spinner blades do you polish last?
536552,Guest,2004-01-13 18:39:00,0,I think the winner or a strong contender is Phidelt 157 a few years back on when was the best time to cross the border with some recent DUIs. Over 200 posts and a lot of ruffled feathers.
536554,DaveIN,2004-01-13 19:11:00,191,The one that always tickles me is for some one to ask which splash guards are the best. There is a post about this on Boats and Motors currently.
536555,Matches,2004-01-13 19:17:00,236,"How about, what do you pack for the perfect shore-lunch?"
536558,Guest,2004-01-13 19:33:00,0,""" Catch more fish on Red hooks or plain steel"" ""How many wraps do you use with your improved clinch knot"" "" Does it really help to hook leechs upside down"""
536565,Guest,2004-01-14 04:32:00,0,What about the snow fleas thread a few years ago?
