I caught and released it in June 2003 on Lake O'Sullivan in Quebec. Caught it drifting a pink and white 1/4 oz. jig (seems everything hits that) in 12-15 feet o' water. I need to post a picture of that one. It was 10 pounds 10 ounces and did NOT have a Pike in its mouth. I'll post the photo. Happy New year Andy"
