My question is where to go?? I remember reading that the NW section is better in the spring and then the walleye tend to migrate eastward. Is this true? Would I be better off in the NE section of the lake? We will be trying to book something for the last week of July or first of August. Please give me some info from those of you that frequent this area. I booked a trip last year to a place with several other resorts on the system just over the border and all 2 of us could land was a 6 inch walleye...real bummer(plenty of smallmouth). I would like to find a place that has walleye, northerns and muskie if possible. Thanx in advance for all the help!! Jason"

I fish the central portions of LacSeul at Silver Water Wheel Lodge and the walleye fishing is so good, we hardly ever spend time on Pike or Smallies. Both are available in the central, but the walleye fishing is just exceptional. We go late June/early July. www.sww-lodge.com Jigger1"
