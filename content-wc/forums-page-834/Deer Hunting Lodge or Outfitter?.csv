We would consider just about anywhere with the chance for a big buck. We understand that the density can be low, but would like to do a northern hunt. Cost is an issue. We are very experienced hunters, including big woods and do not need a guide, however, we would prefer some scouted land or stands or something to start with. Any suggestions on where to go? Thanks, O F"
