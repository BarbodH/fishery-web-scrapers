536737,Guest,2004-01-19 20:13:00,0,"To be blunt, ENOUGH ALREADY ! Tired of the darn bickering over all the events that transpired at the Minaki Lodge. The way I see it if you were not there, why all the bad mouthing ? Yes, everybody is entitled to their own opinions but to base these opinions on hearsay/rumours or what little snippits that have been in the local papers is wrong. Yes, I was out there & to be honest I actually did enjoy myself - and can honestly say that I did enjoy working for Phil Archer.Why did I quit when I did ? Let's just say that there were others involved in the ""management team"" that I wouldn't waste my time getting a oxygen tank for if they were having difficulty breathing. Having said that, all this speculation on who's wrong, who started, what they said, what was done, what wasn't done , who did what, the ethnic origin of anybody envolved, is totally uncalled for. During my time out there I can tell you that I worked daily besides all the trades people. To suggest that there is ""payback"" for outstanding work is absolutly absurd. ALL of the trades people out there were professionals & did top knotch work. For them to possibly endanger their personal lives & the lives of their families for the sake of ""settling"" the score is nonsense. As for the ownership group, Phil / Don / Rod / Terry, the guys that I had personal & professional contact with, I will go on public record and state that I have nothing but respect for these individuals. What they were attempting to accomplish was nothing short of a miracle. Phil Archer has his heart in the right place & truly has a deep love of the Lodge & all that it represents. Yes, he is a business man who likes to make $$, but show me anybody who isn't like this. During the reconstruction of the Lodge & property these individuals didn't hesitate to make sure that things were done the ""right way"". They were determined to make this a ""first rate"" project. The delay of the opening of the golf course is a perfect example. It could have been opened earlier, butit wasn't up to the standards that Phil expected to present to his guests. Delaying the opening of the course was a huge financial hit. How do I know this ? On a daily basis I dealt with guests in person & on the phone inquiring about the course opening. Anther thing that hurt the lodge was the buracratic bungling of the issue of a liquor licence. The value of lost business due to this must have been incredible. Once the licence was issued, I'd say that Dockside was THEE hotspot to be in. Not once during this process did I hear Phil whine / complain about it. His attitude ? Claimed it was the cost of doing business. He sucked it up & stayed determined to operate a first class operation - for his guests & the local area. There is many more instances of things that happened to the Lodge & the ownership group that was out of the control of those operating the Lodge, but thru all of the adversity they maintained a great attitude and continued in a forward direction. Bottom line ? All of this negative crap has to stop. All the name calling has to stop. Nothing is gained by what has been taking place on this board, a board that by the way is for ""fishing""(last I looked) So instead of the B.S, why don't we ALL think of the positives that can come out of a terrible accident. It is still a fantastic area to visit & fish. It's a world class fishery, so why not enjoy it ? Do you need to stay at the Lodge ? Nope. Stay with any of the other local camps, I'm sure Brian or Duane would love to see you. They supported the Lodge & Phil everyday. I'm sure that if you are out there, you might be tempted to whack a few balls into the bush or maybe have a Martini while sitting Dockside watching the world go by. Good Fishen Rob anybody has a problem with my post, please feel to E MAIL me and we can debate this in private.[email protected]"
