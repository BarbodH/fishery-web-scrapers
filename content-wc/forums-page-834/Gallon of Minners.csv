536652,McQ,2004-01-16 07:00:00,615,"I just checked with a local broker and prices this time of year are running from a low of $50 - to a high of $95/gal. It appears there is a wide spread shortage of good minnows and they are priced accordingly. This is for common shiners and there is a major shortage of bigger minnows - over 4"". Golden shiners are in short supply too. Maybe someone knows why the price has doubled in a very short time frame. What was explained to me this morning is the runoff from farming operations has spoiled most of the creeks that are the trapping waters locally. This as a result of heavy rains last fall."
536656,Reels,2004-01-16 08:38:00,2876,I was wondering this morning what a gallon of minners were. Can you buy them by the gallon without a commercial liscence? How many minners in a gallon? <{{}}><

536685,kelloggs5car,2004-01-17 18:22:00,27,just cut up pieces of that 12lb walleye from your other post and you won't have to worry about minners
536686,Guest,2004-01-17 18:47:00,0,"A gallun is typically around 80 dozen. varies on size etc. price depends on availabilty and how trapping is going. when I was involved here locally with retail, our wholesale cost was around the 80 - 90 buck range. You can purchase a ""gallun"", but most retailers prefer not to sell them that way. The reason for that up here is that they have no real way determining a cost. When they get in a gallun, they don't count them. They assume that they are getting X amount. Reselling them would be a pain. No real way to give a ""fair"" cost for a unknown number. The other problem that I could see is also that up here you are only allowed to posess a certain amount of live bait (minners)anything over this amount & you need a permit.This permit is a live bait/commercial fishermans license. These are limited permits & actually only a certain amount are allowed per region. In other words, Yah just ain't gitting one. Thats it basically....... Good Fishen Rob"

536720,Guest,2004-01-19 12:15:00,0,Is it legal to trap or seine minnows?
536721,Trailerguy,2004-01-19 12:58:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Last summer I rode along with a freind, who owns a resort. He picked up minnows from Whitewing, near Ear Falls. They have one of the ""commercial"" licenses in that area, and a larger block to trap in. They sell minnows by the scoop, about 25 doz. a dip, or about 75 doz./gal. My freind also has a couple licinses so that he can trap specific lakes for his own minnows, but most of the time is too busy to do so. His licenses are a result of a grandfathered clause before the current rules went into effect. He does also have to have a license to sell the minnows he buys to his guests. Also any Ontario resident can have one minnow trap and up to a certin number of minnows from that trap. Non residents can't trap minnows in Ontario. I know Whitewing sells minnows for fly in's as well so apparently if you purchase from a commercial dealer you can posses a large number at one time, I would think a receipt would satisfy the MNR."
