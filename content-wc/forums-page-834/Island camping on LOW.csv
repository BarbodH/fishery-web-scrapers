We used to do this every year but with babies, etc., it's been difficult. We usually start our trip from Hanson Bay and travel up to the Kenora area and back - camping on islands. I've heard since our last trip a few years ago that you need camping permits? We've never had (or new about ) these in the past. I've looked on the MNR web site but they have no info regarding this. Can someone inform me if you do need these permits, where to get them, where you can/can't camp (Whitefish Bay/Crown Land?) and any other needed information. We have a family cabin on LOW/Ontario and are from MN. Thank you."
