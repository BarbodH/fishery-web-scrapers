536691,AL,2004-01-18 07:30:00,89,"I am looking for a new tackle bag with fly-in trips being my #1 priority. I have been using 3 different bags (one for cranks/ spoons/ etc, one for jigs and bodies and a third for spinners etc.). I am thinking of going to one bag such as the Cabelas Super Magnum. Any other ideas out there? Anyone have the Cabelas Magnum series bags?"
536693,Ohio fisherman,2004-01-18 08:17:00,989,"I have used the Cabelas bags - both in the Magnum and Super Magnum sizes. These are very good quality bags. The magnum is not quite large enough. The super is big enough but when loaded is way too heavy. So, I now use two magnum sized bags. That way each bag can be somewhat customized and sometimes only one bag is necessary depending on the outing. Good fishing, O F"
