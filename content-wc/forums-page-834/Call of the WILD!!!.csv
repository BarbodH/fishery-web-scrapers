536675,Guest,2004-01-17 13:17:00,0,It's a judgement call. If nights coming and you feel you're up to the jaunt I'd get going. Keeping a fire going at night in the winter is no easy task. The other thing you don't want to happen is your buddies come looking for you at night when you're overdue and hit the same spot that took your machine. 2 miles is not very far for someone in shape. If you have medical conditions or if the going is bad you might want to stay but only as a last resort. I'm in good shape and I'd go as soon as possible.

536677,Hawker,2004-01-17 14:07:00,3967,"Trying to recall some of my old survival training from years gone by. I'm pretty much to the conclusion that unless you light that fire pretty quick and get dried off and warmed up your likely not going to make that two mile jaunt/walk and live to tell about it under the conditions you describe. You'd have to be in extreme good physical condition to make it the two miles in wet clothing at temps double 18 deg.! I say you'd better get dry and warm first, besides, the fire will help attract attention to your location in the event your buddies come looking for you."
536679,Guest,2004-01-17 14:47:00,0,hope you have some burning material 2miles out? We always carry a loud whistle around are necks.be save everyone.
536683,Guest,2004-01-17 15:30:00,0,If you just fished when the water is water and not ice you wouldnt have to worry about this.
