536556,Guest,2004-01-13 19:20:00,0,Need somebody besides me who can fish to go with me this week. The two guys I go with couldnt catch a cold from an Eskimo Hooters Girl.

536584,Guest,2004-01-14 10:36:00,0,"Vant, Great idea . I need to dump these guys. One of them is the Carp Champion of Illinois and the other loves to catch Bullheads. The only reason I fish with them is it is so easy to catch more Walleyes than they do. Like one a day is a winner. I live in Olathe. Where do you live? Sure hope you dont like to fish for Carp or Bullheads. Include your email address in your next post and I will contact you. Got some more great storys about the bums Im stuck with."

The Dam is a steady producer of fish and there are spots all the way down river that we did good at. Best luck has always been on jig/minnow A lot of the time we would anchor when we found a hole or drop off and vertical jig. Depending on current we would use 1/4,3/8 and 1/2 oz jigs. Had some luck casting crankbaits at rocky shores or in pool areas down river. Hooked up on some nice Pike with the cranks."
