Good Fishing,Pikeman"
4830642,Walleye_Guru,2016-05-12 20:07:00,62,"Dngleberry - Sorry to hear about the error on your bill, not sure what happened?? Could it have been the Onaman boat rental charge? Regardless, we'll make it right with you. We just over hauled Cabin #8 and kicked out all the mice! It'll be the most popular cabin on the lot now! Gotta love the Northwoods living! Good luck and hope to cross paths with you in the future. Chad"
2466481,Jim_C,2014-02-19 09:56:00,9,Well they say a picture is worth a thousand wordsl Thanks Pikeslayer8 for the treads!
2466497,Pikeslayer8,2014-02-19 09:59:00,1460,"Your welcome, but props go to Moosebunk. The master of adventure."
2467713,eyemike,2014-02-19 17:47:00,233,"20 minute walk in to Onaman. Definitely not a mile. Clean and package your fish before you hike out knocks down the weight a lot. I have watched a 90 year old man walk in several times it just took him a little longer. Carnhzkr has the right idea stay on the island, less walking. I walked in every day for a week a few years back, had a smile on my face every day. Mike..."
2467881,123chadder,2014-02-19 18:40:00,429,20 minute walk is close to a mile
2468681,Jim_C,2014-02-20 06:52:00,9,BTW I was wondering why Bob calls it a resort. Likely to the fact they have electricity and toilets. This is upscale when you’re used to fly in outpost.Sounds like this Lake Onoman is a hotspot how big is this lake? Does it have shelter and contour?Bob indicated that you can likely get walleyes in numbers in and around the river that flows by the camp and into Nipagon and the somewhat sheltered bays adjacent to the rivers mouth offer big pike and at certain times of the year specked trout. The URL with the photos seemed to bear this out to a degree. He said more days than not there was enough shelter to allow you to fish this area of Nipagon even with the 14’ 15 HP boats. Don’t trust my trailer for a 2000 mile round trip.I heard Nipagon has a no barb hook rule? I use Rapalas for walleyes ”trolling” and pike “jerk baiting”. That could be a lot of hooks to replace. You guys have been great. This seems like an A#1 camp except for the drive.
2468737,walleye IA,2014-02-20 07:12:00,129,I sent you a PM
2472113,SSH,2014-02-21 09:02:00,526,"My son and I stayed at Pasha a couple years ago. The walk from the parking is about 1.1 miles to Onaman. My son had a GPS in his phone, so the distance should be very close. It wasn't a bad walk, but carrying in depth finder, minnow bucket, food, rain gear, lunch/beverages, tackle and rods does make the hike a little bit of work especially with the black flies biting like mad.We had very good fishing in Northwind and another small lake. We did catch four nicewalleyes on Onaman that were 23 to 24 inches, but the mayfly hatch was horrendous.We were covered with mayflies and could see them on the depth finder coming off the bottom of the lake.IMHO, I didn't care for hauling a boat every day to the lakes other than Onaman. Onamon Lake had cached boats to hike to."
2472377,Jim_C,2014-02-21 09:57:00,9,"I'm 54 and had enough of that nonsense years ago. The owner at Pasha informed me he always had boats on at least 10 lakes (~20 during peak season). Hum I wonder, dragging boats thru the bush, not me? Been their done that. Won't be doing that again.Thank you all."
2512354,Walleye_Guru,2014-03-03 17:35:00,62,Jim - quick clarification.... Onaman does not require you to carry a motor. And the easiest way to pack fish out of the lake is to clean them while you're there. Good luck with the rest of your research. Thanks Chad
4826450,Guest,2016-05-11 12:25:00,0,"Stayed at Pasha lake last summer, second week of July. The cabin we stayed in was the oldest one they had. Girlfriend did not like the mice! Onaman Lake was awesome! Yes it was a five mile ride down the highway then 30mi north on a maintained logging road then another 10 down a two track and yes then a mile walk with your gear plus a gas can. 18 to 28 in Walleye every other cast! Also fished Northwind. took my own boat! another awesome Walleye lake we caught over 20 in a matter of a few hours the largest being a 28 incher. after I got home and reviewed the bill I found they had charged we for boat rental on Northwind! $128. But then there is Lake Nipigon. Took my boat there also. Landed a 40 inch Northern on the flyrod!!!!!! Going back there this summer. Going to back country camp."
2464689,Jim_C,2014-02-18 17:53:00,9,"The owner of the Onamon River Resort seemed amicable and informed me excellent fishing for big pike and very numerous walleyes was just 3 miles downstream. Where the river opens to the bay (walleyes) and in the somewhat sheltered bay of L. Nipagon (big pike). He has numerous smaller lakes or spots on the river that offered excellent pike and walleye fishing. Some not too far from camp. What impressed me is he never mentioned money. We just had a nice chat about the camp and fishing. He stated he bought new motors this year.The owner of Pasha Lake Camps informed me that he had access to > 30 lakes loaded with walleyes and pike, which at least 10 always have boats on them. Each lake has its own flavor bigger fish vs. number and so on. With some lakes real close to camp with easy access, some a bit of a drive - portage. What concerned me was he went right when you want to send in the down payments, when I said I was undecided he seemed to lose interest. These camps are a 900 mile + drive for our team. I really can't go without feeling confident about the guys fishing and equipment as well as their willingness to help you find the fish during your stay.I'm hop full you folks might help in my decision?"
2464841,dutchboy,2014-02-18 18:22:00,5717,To many people fail to ask for the sale. Pasha wanted your group and wasn't afraid to ask for it. Don't hold that against him. Go where your heart tells tells you to go.
2464913,Pikeslayer8,2014-02-18 18:30:00,1460,I agree. I've also been keeping tabs on both these camps as I feel both are prime waters. Probably can't go wrong with either and as Dutch said go with your heart.
2464969,Jim_C,2014-02-18 18:54:00,9,"I been burned 2ce on Fly ins where they sounded very promising. lousy equipment and less than stellar fishing. Then I've been on 8 fantastic Fly ins Big pike up to 25 pounds and walleyes limits daily with many thrown back. Feelings aren't facts. What is tangible can be trusted. BTW if anyone what's a fly outfitter that's down to earth, honest with great fishing try Air Cochrane? Just trying to keep the price down with the drive to option."
2465137,Pikeslayer8,2014-02-18 19:28:00,1460,You talked with both owners so you got the facts. Seems to me you want reassurances. There have been lots of reports on these two camps. Try the search funtion
2465193,Carnhzkr,2014-02-18 19:38:00,964,"After researching both Pasha and Onaman River on this site and speaking with both outfitters, I was leaning toward booking with OR, mainly because the lake that Pasha is on has no walleye. I understand there are lots of great walleye lakes a drive away, but I like to fish an hour or two after dinner, so I'd rather have walleye at my doorstep. However, I got the strong impression that the premiere walleye lake available to both outfitters is Onaman Lake, which is available by a drive, then a walk of a mile+. I ended up booking with Bauers, which is on Onaman. It's a fly-in out of Nakina, but priced out only a couple hundred more for my son and me than what I would have paid at OR."
2465385,Jim_C,2014-02-18 20:25:00,9,"An hour is a log portage thru the bush, especially if your carry out your limit and a motor - gas. Thanks for the warning. BTW, perhaps you've never had the misfortune of running into into a slippery camp owner. Call it reassurance or whatever you want. I just want someone to share that is of that experience.Allow me to please narrow it down. Are the walleyes at the mouth of the Onaman River where it flows into Lake Nipigon and are the sizable pike in the immediate bay in which the river flows. I'll leave it at that.Thank you"
2466089,walleye IA,2014-02-19 07:58:00,129,"Jim, I'm not sharpest tool in the wood shad, so do you mean the walleye's ARE at the mouth of the river, or are you suggesting that they are not there. I'm also considering this resort for my first father son trip."
2466233,Jim_C,2014-02-19 08:32:00,9,The owner said that good walleye fishing for numbers was located where the river dumped into L Nipagon. If you do go kindly let me know how you do?
2466417,Pikeslayer8,2014-02-19 09:27:00,1460,Another forum but I would feel intrigued. http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...howtopic=70646http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...53#entry829542
