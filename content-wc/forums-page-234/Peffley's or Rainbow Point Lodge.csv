If your wanting Wabaskang lake why not compare Gawleys parkview camp to Rainbow. There kinda close to each other. The folks at peffleys are nice people but in my mind a little pricey. I like both Gawleys and rainbow for the reason if you need something dutchies little store is right there. The Gawleys are great people and camp owners. For me it's what your wanting to fish for. Both are good walleye lakes with peuruallt being a better smallmouth lake. I would say Wabaskang would be the better pike lake.
