4678954,MattPoke13,2016-03-28 07:35:00,4,"Hello All- We are finally taking on Lac Seul this coming fall and I am hoping I can get a couple of questions answered. How is the fishing near Whitewing the first week of September? We will be using camp boats, and I am wondering how far we will need to venture. Also, how bad/heavy is the boat traffic in that area? We have always ventured to outposts, and while we know this will not be nearly as remote, some of the guys are concerned that it will be ""bumper to bumper."" Finally, I am thinking of hiring a guide for my father and me the first day. Any recommendations, and do the guides offer half-day bookings? Thanks in advance for the help! Poke"
4679962,Steve Ediger,2016-03-28 11:07:00,97,"I have been fishing Lac Seul three times a year for the past 4-5 years, mid June, end of July, and end of September. My favorite trip is the September trip. I have not fished as far north as Whitewing. I fish out of Lac Seul Lodge which is several miles south of Whitewing. The fishing from McKenzie bay south that time of year is great, but I can't speak for north of that, I would assume it is also good. As far as fishing pressure, at the end of Sept. we hardly see another boat on the lake. I think that is one reason I like it so much. We do see a few moose hunters though. If you find fish that time of year, you usually find a BUCH, and they are hungry. I bet you will really enjoy your trip. Steve"

Younger son has school in late August so no way can we go any later in the year. Lodge owners will tell you that this can be a GREAT time of the year because: 1. Less boat traffic - many people have to get the kids back for school 2. People are afraid the weather will get too cold 3. Not as many flies 4. Bigger fish and you'll not have to travel all that far. You are going to LOVE Whitewing. Beautiful camp with GREAT equipment. Dave & Bobbie run a first class report. When I finally retire, my buddy & I plan on fishing as late as we possibly can in this part of Lac Seul. Enjoy!!!"
4681274,MikeinMN,2016-03-28 16:36:00,190,"Our group fishes Lac Seul that time of year and we stay basically right next door to Whitewing. In my experience, fishing close to camp could be a challenge this time of year. We run pretty far to fish every day. Pretty far from Whitewing to me means Mackenzie Bay and farther. The boat traffic is pretty minimal unless you park right in the middle of a narrows. I usually don't fish the popular spots like the Sand Banks or Manitoba Point, and I usually don't see very many other boats. I would recommend a guide for your first day. It's a big lake, and at least for our group it took a while for us to consistently have good fishing. Also get a good map or GPS with a chip, there are a few obstacles, and the buoys that mark travel routes and hazards are not really maintained anymore. I hope my post does not sound negative, it really is an exceptional drive-to destination."
