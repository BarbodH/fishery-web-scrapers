Curious if the water has gotten warm enough for the walleye to spawn or if they're still holdin their eggs. Anyone know? Thanks! Good luck to the opener guys!"
4830250,ElectricSlide19,2016-05-12 17:38:00,147,Curious about this as well!
4830914,Lmbkiller,2016-05-12 22:22:00,639,"When the ice is out of the incoming rivers or a lake with no tributaries, walleyes will commence spawning activity and it will last 2-3 weeks ish. All fish species don't spawn at the exact same time or area so there is a period of time in which it takes, not one single event"

4831226,prov1800,2016-05-13 05:45:00,5010,The main factor with walleye spawning is water temperature. They prefer somewhere around 50 f.they stage near there spawning areas till temps rise and will then go to where they spawn.some walleyes that spawn on shorelines might spawn later if temps are not right.these fish could atvtimes still have eggs in them as they might spawn later.was out last werkend for lakectrout and the main lake was at 42f and some bays were at 46-47f.so parts of thectributaries the walleyes spawn in would have been up in the 50 f range and doing there business.pike will have spawned already as they spawn much earlier.
