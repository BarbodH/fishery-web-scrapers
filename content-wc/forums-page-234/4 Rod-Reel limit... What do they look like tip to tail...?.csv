4829034,levee breaks,2016-05-12 09:37:00,5,"1st message on Walleye Central....sure satisfies the non fishing days. Going to Canada for the week of June 6th and since we can't take unlimited rods with space/weight restrictions...we take 11 rigs for 4 guys. 5 medium or medium light spinnings, 6 to 6'6"" with 2500 type reels. half with 6lb and the rest with 8. I use nothing but Cabelas Pro Line co - mono...Inexpensive and awesome. Other rigs..4 medium or medium heavy spinning rigs 6'6"" to 7' with slightly bigger reels and 10 - 12 pound Pro line and 2 casting rigs..6'6"" MH action ugly stick lites with Abu silver max' with 12lb test for casting or trolling lakers or pike or walleyes. One more thing...about half the rigs are 2 piece for the portage lakes we fish...much easier for transport! Good Catching"
2716721,jaximus,2014-04-24 02:36:00,117,"@borntofish... while i agree with most of what you say, i disagree on light being more sensitive than a medium power rod. my favorite rod is a medium power fast action st croix. i can feel the tiny tick of a perch at the far end of a cast, no problem. i would say that the most important thing is confidence and familiarity with equipment. fishing is how i spend most of my time, so my rod is just an extension of my body, if you blind folded me and tied on any lure i own, i would tell by feel which lure it was. in canada, you can catch all the walleyes you could possibly want with just a handline, so saying that you need specific equipment is just silly. the moral of the story is... when you are in gods country, fish with something that you dont have to worry about or think about or concentrate on. enjoy the scenery and fishing and friendship."
3756345,bushead11,2015-04-11 19:46:00,151,I started this thread almost exactly 1 year ago... Wondering if anyone has any new input. Ive got 2 new spinning reels and 2 new bait casting setups. Looking for line suggestions...

3756449,bushead11,2015-04-11 20:13:00,151,What pound test do you use and braided or mono on either set up?
3756945,Da' Walleye Assassun,2015-04-12 00:33:00,358,"On the spinning outfits I have had great resuts with Spiderwire Ultracast in 8 pound test on both my medium and medium light power rods. Ultracast has low memory, low stretch for a monofilament line, good knot strength, and small diameter for the pound test. Ultracast is also on my casting reels. Walmart sells Ultracast. I tried several flourocarbon lines and went back to Ultracast."

3759105,bthomas3333,2015-04-12 18:08:00,465,"I also disagree with Borntofish. Where I would agree is in the lower end rods. Stuff that is under $100. A good bit ago I used a Shimano Compre ML Fast rod and it did have decent sensitivity, but when I moved up to St Croix Walleye Legend it was a game changer. The Medium power with Fast or Extra Fast tip is just as sensitive at the tip as a ML rod and it has the backbone for better hook sets. The other nice part about the medium is the ability to control and minimize the fighting time against smaller fish. I think the overall survival rate has to be higher for a fish caught and released faster.I also have 30+ years of fishing walleyes in NW ON but to each his own.B-"
3760033,Aspencreek,2015-04-12 21:24:00,2911,"X2........while I thought my Gander mt guide series graphite rods were pretty good, my gradual switch to St Croix has been a complete game changer. The sensitivity is off the charts, I can feel the minnow or worm get nervous."
3781801,Guest,2015-04-18 20:01:00,0,"Simple answer. GLoomis rods. Two of them. One that fishes 1/16th to 1/8th ounce. The other that fishes 1/8th to 1/4. Light Shimano reels because I'm holding them all day. 6 lbs test mono, nothing else. I fish 1/16 in a chop and 1/8 in rollers. Anyone gets on my boat with more than two rods...stay at the dock and learn to retie. Come with me and learn to fish."

2702746,Guest,2014-04-20 17:28:00,0,"I am no help. Heck I don't even have a 4 rod limit on the front deck let alone for the entire trip. I bring 17 setups, partner brings another 12. We use most of them. Some stay in the cabin. I can lay down in my rod lockers with room to spare so space is not an issue."

Then 7 foot plus medium/medium crankbait pole 12 lb mono sufix seige. The other pole geez maybe a 7ft. 6inch medium heavy/ heavy with a 6500 Abu with braid of our choice. Covers every thing"
2704962,BornToFish,2014-04-21 12:22:00,1224,"Your question might be a bit vague to some folks as we aren't sure what species you will target. I'm assuming walleyes and pike. Are other species possibly in the picture? My suggestions are as follows: Maybe consider switching one of your spinning rods to a Light or Medium-Light power. I fish fairly shallow water during the early season for walleyes, by this I mean less than 8--10 feet of water. I use six-eight pound monofilament as the main line, a small in-line barrel swivel and a six pound fluorocarbon dropper to a 1/6 ounce jig. I tie the dropper directly to the jig - never use a swivel. This set-up is supremely sensitive and is all I need to handle all walleyes that I encounter. I don't know what size pike you are targeting. If they are big enough, you might want to switch your MH casting rod to a medium-heavy musky rod. At the end of the day, take with you the equipment in which you are confident. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
2705226,bushead11,2014-04-21 13:06:00,151,"Pike, walleye and smallies. Outside of pan fishing with the kids, those are the species I fish in southern wisconsin as well. My question was to partly ensure I'm matching things up correctly. I finally bought some new gear and tried to put together some combos for specific purposes. Up until now if been using the same 2 rods and reels I bought on a shoe string budget back in high school for all applications... Just wanted some feedback on what I put together and make sure I didn't miss the mark... Thanks guys!"
2705338,BornToFish,2014-04-21 13:26:00,1224,"Like I mentioned, I think it's imperative that you take the gear in which you have confidence. Your brain has to be happy when you are in the boat as it makes it much easier to catch fish. The worst thing that could happen is that you will be in the boat regretting that you should have brought the other rod/reel instead of what you brought with you. You did well in selecting your recently upgraded fishing gear. The only item that I will re-iterate is that you might be duplicating your spinning rods. This is why I suggested switching one of your spinning rods to a Light or Medium-Light power rod. A combination of Medium and Light/Medium-Light rods should cover all of your bases for walleyes and smallies. I know that I would have to use a 1/4 ounce jig to have the ""right feel"" with a Medium power rod. This would absolutely drive me crazy. I much prefer to use a Light power rod with a 1/16 ounce jig, especially in the spring. I can feel the bottom as well as the bite, yet have enough power in the rod to handle any walleye that I encounter. I serve as a mentor of sorts for many guests at the Lodge that I stay at. A common mistake that I see many first time anglers make is to fish with too heavy of gear and fish too fast. I absolutely know that concepts of light and slow are important to my fishing success. Good luck to you on your upcoming trip. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
2705362,BornToFish,2014-04-21 13:29:00,1224,"I was assuming that you are primarily fishing in a lake as opposed to a river/tributary. If the latter, you might be better off with the heavier power rods as you might need a heavier jig just to reach and stay in contact with bottom. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
2707050,bushead11,2014-04-21 19:46:00,151,Wisconsin-mostly lakes Canada - Woman River I have a ML set up that I will bring. I'm actually bringing 6 just wanted to see if everyone would have spent their money the way I did...
2708586,BornToFish,2014-04-22 07:07:00,1224,"I'm glad to hear that you are taking a ML power rod with you to Canada. I do the vast majority of my fishing in NW Ontario during August and September. I'm closing in on fifty weeks of fishing in Ontario during these two months alone. The majority of this walleye fishing is jigging, especially vertical jigging. This is in contrast to cranking, trolling, bottom bouncing and the like. I have met many walleye anglers during my fishing trips to my lodge of choice that I would rate as highly skilled anglers. I can honestly say that none of them use a medium power rod or heavier. About one half of these anglers use a light power rod. The other half use a medium-light power rod. I use a St. Croix light power rod. These anglers recognize that feel is of paramount importance to ensure success. The game is all about being able to feel the bottom so as to ensure their lure is in the strike zone, as well as being able to detect a subtle bite. Fishing with heavier tackle (i.e. rod and jigs) is like putting a heavy wet blanket over something that needs sensitivity. I know that what I've described in this and previous posts work extremely well for me and numerous other successful anglers. This may or may not work for you. Like I said in my first post on this thread, go with what you have confidence in. You will catch fish when your brain is happy. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
