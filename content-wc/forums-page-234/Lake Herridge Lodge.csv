I was wondering if anybody can give me information about this lake and the lodge. Our group of 14, mostly family members are heading up to this lodge for the first time, we were wondering how the walleye fishing is, we are headed up in late June. Any information would be great, dad is 83 and doesn't get around as well as he used to so we needed a place that was easy access for him. We fished Marten River last year and a good time but the fishing wasn't that great. Thanks for any help you can give us. Peewee 17."

I have a slight preference for Garden Island due to it's location, but it's not really that significant. You would have a great time at either of these lodges. Fishing for Walleye and Smallmouth can be good to amazing. The Northerns are in there, but you have to work for them - at least in the summer when we went."
