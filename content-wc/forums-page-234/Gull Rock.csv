4839674,martinbns,2016-05-15 17:28:00,1520,"My wife and I are going there the last week of July, how far from the town of Red Lake is it?"
4839706,Stringbean,2016-05-15 17:46:00,279,From the stoplight in Red Lake down to the driveway of Five Lakes Lodge is 11km (6.9 miles) on Google Maps.
4834026,Guest,2016-05-13 20:50:00,0,Have been fishing Gull Rock for 11 years but always in late August. I'm going up May 28 thru June 3. Where can I find the walleyes this early in the season? Thanks for any tips
4834098,johnboat,2016-05-13 21:08:00,2014,"Everywhere! First snug up to the ""insole"" of the boot. Fisherman Point is always good. Then you can go to the shallows and reed beds by Ranger Bay. You won't be able to get into Ranger as it will be closed off then. Starratts is another good spot. Probably fish your usual spots except maybe for the reefs and youll be good. It will be 15 years in a row for me at Gullrock. All have been the same week as you or the week after. Last year I did a 2nd trip up in late August/ early September for a bear hunt and fishing. Was anxious to see what would happen later in the year. I prefer Spring as it has been better but probably not a fair comparison since I was actually on a hunt in fall. Great lake! Have a great trip."
4834106,Poplar,2016-05-13 21:08:00,7,"I'll be up there the same week. What camp are you staying at? Expect to find eyes in shallow bays, rocky points and with the early ice out sunkin islands and reefs might produce. Jig and minnow or leech and live bait rigs (lindy rigs) are the go to. Hope this helps"
4834954,SNOPRO,2016-05-14 08:11:00,108,We're staying at Golden Hook.
4834994,Poplar,2016-05-14 08:18:00,7,Poplar point. We'll be in the white Ranger with a white Evinrude 150. Good luck
4835026,SNOPRO,2016-05-14 08:25:00,108,Are crawlers on lindy rigs good this early? Or are minnows the preferred bait this early.Where do you stay poplar and jonboat?
4835418,Poplar,2016-05-14 11:23:00,7,"We stay at Poplar Point. Great camp. Crawlers should work, especially if water temps are up. Leeches always produce, and we'll have both along. But our bait of choice is always gonna be minnows. Minnows will also get you an occasional pike. Only problem with crawlers is sometimes the little perch won't leave you alone, especially in the bays."
4835650,SNOPRO,2016-05-14 13:01:00,108,Yeah big perch would be OK. I'll be in a black and silver Lund Pro V w/135 Merc and Iowa boat numbers. We're bringing up crawlers just in case that's what they're hungry for. What's your hometown?
4835698,Poplar,2016-05-14 13:49:00,7,"LeMars. How bout you? I've been going there since '02 but my oldest brother started in 1980 and has only missed a couple times. Says the fishing has only gotten better thanks to the slot. Back in those days he said a 21"" eye was considered a big fish. I agree on the big perch. I did catch a freaky huge one a few years back outside Stoney bay but usually we catch them on accident"
4836018,SNOPRO,2016-05-14 17:06:00,108,"I'm up in Janesville,Ia. My neighbor got me going up about 12 yrs ago. He and his wife have been going up for more than 40 yrs. Always stayed at Golden Hook but looked at Poplar Point and liked the place. Love everything about Golden Hook, including the new owners, except they're only 6 days to a week instead of 7. Love the lake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
