I was unable to track down a phone number for Lund, to ask them about how my boat was built. I searched through my records from when I purchased the boat and found a telephone number. I called this number and received a recorded message that went something like this: ""Please leave a detailed message and we will get back to you within three business days"". I surmised that Lund encourages owners of Lund boats to contact a servicing dealer and pay for needed services and/or information, rather than provide direct customer service. I wasn't the least bit surprised at this most recent experience with Lund Boats. All of my experiences with Lund Boats have been the same. I simply cannot think of anything positive to say about the company."
