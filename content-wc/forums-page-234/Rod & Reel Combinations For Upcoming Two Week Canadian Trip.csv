Here is what I plan on taking for my rod and reel combinations. #1 6' dedicated jigging rod M/L spinning reel w/Fireline #2 6'6"" medium general purpose spinning reel w/8# mono #3 7' medium spinning Rod reel loaded w/10# mono/extra spool of 10#braid #4 7' M/H baitcaster w/17# mono #5 6 1/2 medium baitcaster w/20# Braid #6 6 1/2 medium baitcaster w/12# mono I'll be bringing one extra spinning and one extra baitcaster reel. Species we are after are #1 Smallmouth C&R, #2 Eater Walleye, #3 Lake Trout, #4 Whitefish, and if all else fails.....#5 Northern Pike So what do you guys think? Don't hold back!"
4825290,Algoma Guy,2016-05-11 07:36:00,48,"Here is what I would bring based on the equipment you have provided:1. 6'6"" medium general purpose spinning w/ 10lb braid. Jigging walleye, casting shorelines or drop shoting for small mouth and smaller northerns.2. 7' MH baitcaster w/ 20lb braid. Jigging or trolling for lake trout. Larger northerns and possibly casting spinner baits for smallies.How do you plan on targeting the whitefish? The 6'6"" spinning might work. You would be surprised at how many times guys have brought 4-5 rods in the boat and ended up using just 1 or 2 of them. Don't get me wrong it is always nice to have ample choices and definitely bring a spare in case something breaks. If space is not an issue bring em' all."

4826346,ukcats11,2016-05-11 11:57:00,12,"I've been debating the same thing. My trip isn't until 2017 however lol I'm thinking 3: 6""6 ML spinner for live bait jigs 6""8 M spinner for small mouths and light cranks 7""3 MH bait caster for pike"
4826426,Bakefish,2016-05-11 12:16:00,1077,One advantage to being the boatowner on the trip. There will be 10 rods in the rod locker. All mine.
