The long portage(3 lake portage) is an adventure but we caught huge numbers on it. Biggest fish was one 27 incher but most fish 24 and under. The main lake where the cabins are caught lots of numbers. We are not Pike fisherman but there are huge pike in there, we caught them while walleye fishing. I would go back again. Jig and lots of frozen shiners is all you need."
