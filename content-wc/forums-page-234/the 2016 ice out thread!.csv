4644897,prov1800,2016-03-17 11:15:00,5010,I think youl be allright. All cold nights which should keep things tight.especially through bush trails.it will warm up during the days.if ice lifted it would be great.i dont know where your planning your fishing.i know you said eagle but irs 65 miles long.you might have read the pist somebody went swimming down at the east end.dont go there.sled is always the safer bet.it will go all over just need to make sure engine stays cool and get lubrication.last week the ice surface was ice.NOW it could be sloppy .screw a few self tapping screws into your tire lugs those work wonders.wont hurt your tires any.
4645721,Obabikon,2016-03-17 15:38:00,2370,4 years ago I think. It was the earliest ever (from what I've been told). Somewhere around April 10.
4645745,Skywagon,2016-03-17 15:43:00,1106,"I am estimating we got 8"" of snow yesterday. All morning was spent blowing snow with the skid-steer for myself and some lake neighbors. I went out on the lake with the snowmobile this afternoon to test it out, basically all slush, but that was no surprise. Had my Ranger on the lake fishing on Monday, but would not consider it today. Would guess (hope) the lakes will lift before long and all will be better, though good ice probably won't last long."
