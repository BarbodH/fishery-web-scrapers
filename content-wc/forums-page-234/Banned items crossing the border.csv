4838794,ziggyzag,2016-05-15 13:54:00,125,Hey does anyone know if they have lifted the ban on eggs and potatoes crossing the border into Canada??
4838842,kzoofisher,2016-05-15 14:07:00,5144,I believe only eggs from Indiana are still banned. Potatoes are good too. What's the temp of the Bay? I might have a meeting in Grayling next Sunday and need some big smallmouth to test how my tendonitis is coming along.
4839258,ziggyzag,2016-05-15 15:33:00,125,Well before the cold and snow today East Bay was around 48-52 deg. As it sounds you already know you will be able to test your tendinitis for sure fishing smallies in East bay good luck if you go. Man those pro bass anglers who been filming shows here as of the past 5 years sure have let the cat out of the bag on the small mouth fishing here in T.C.
4839714,Stringbean,2016-05-15 17:50:00,279,Here is the link to official information on the ban on eggs. http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/.../1421341727507
4839778,kzoofisher,2016-05-15 18:22:00,5144,"What the bass guys on the south end don't know is that when it gets too crowded you can run north a couple miles and pound 6-10# lakers on your bass gear. Quite the hoot, too."
4840058,btyreprich,2016-05-15 19:29:00,1067,"The web link has information showing that eggs are still banned - eggs co,in from Indiana. Does that mean that if the egg carton states that the eggs come from another state - say Wiscosnsin - that these eggs can be brought into Canada?"
4840074,1jigfish2,2016-05-15 19:34:00,110,"From what I understand, you need to keep the receipt of where they were purchased. You may have to show it at the border."
4840666,btyreprich,2016-05-16 04:25:00,1067,"Based on this post & comments from everyone, I just might take the chance and buy eggs here at home. We just bought some at a local grocery store and paid under a $1.00 a dozen. Will make sure to keep by receipt to prove the gigs were no purchased in Indiana."
4841546,Bakefish,2016-05-16 08:49:00,1077,"In my many crossings into Canada I've learned that the less you have to talk about with the guards, the better off you'll be. I'll get my eggs in Canada."
4842257,oleJoe,2016-05-16 11:19:00,114,"I,m from Ohio and we bought our eggs in Ontario last year. They didn't even ask at the border being our state was not one that was band.....I guess. Already got our eggs for this year. This waiting is tough."
