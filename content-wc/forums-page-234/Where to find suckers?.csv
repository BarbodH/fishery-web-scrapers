Somewhere around 8 inches for deadbait pike fishing. Place in ear falls that we get them from isn't open yet. It can be in Canada, ordering online, or on the way up from Chicago. Thank you!"

I have tried this method with excellent results--you can buy the suckers ahead of time, freeze them, and thaw them as needed. Especially useful when suckers might be hard to find. And especially applicable to suckers, who aren't exactly the hardiest of baits."
