4835386,Obabikon,2016-05-14 11:11:00,2370,"That's a good question. If you were portaging from lake to lake, you might not know which lake you were going to camp on. So, I would assume they would give out cache's that apply to multiple lakes, but I've never done that... so can't say for sure."
4835586,v-bay gord,2016-05-14 12:40:00,3168,"I've never heard of this rule applying to someone boating/canoeing and camping. If you are leaving your boat unattended (ie. caching it) on a lake I can see that being a no-no. If you are allowed to camp on the lake, and the boat is with you, I don't see a problem. The boat cache process that I'm familiar with, at least in the Dryden MNR District involves documentation and putting boat cache i.d. numbers on the side of your boat. Can't see how that would work on a temporary, or one day basis.?"
4836218,Obabikon,2016-05-14 18:25:00,2370,"I'm sorry... I misunderstood the rule. It is UNLESS you are camping, you can't leave a boat in over night. If it is with you, you have not ""cached"" the boat. Completely my fault. Not meaning to give any misinformation. You can not leave a boat unattended."
4837402,bigwillies,2016-05-15 07:24:00,515,That's what I was wondering about was the boat cache permit.
4833354,Obabikon,2016-05-13 16:45:00,2370,"I didn't want to hijack another thread, but... correct me if I'm wrong. There is not a resort who has ""exclusive"" rights to a lake. They don't own the lake. They have the rights to the boat cache on the lake. This basically means they are the only ones who can LEAVE a boat on the lake. If anyone wants to canoe into a lake in Ontario... it is perfectly legal. Even if it upset other operator that owns the boat cache. They don't actually own exclusive rights to the lake itself. That's free game. I guess the exception would be if they owned all the property around the lake, put up no trespassing signs, and the lake was too small to land a plane on. Then... they legally would have exclusive rights."
4833394,Walleye_Guru,2016-05-13 16:58:00,62,"What you are referring to is an ""Outfitter Lake"". Yes, you can carry a canoe into the lake, however you can not leave it overnight. This is the classification that most ""fly in"" lakes fall under. Example: You carry the canoe in, fish for the day and then leave the canoe there while you return to your cabin. Then the next day, you head back to the same lake where you left the canoe and fish for another day. That would be a no, no. The exception of course, is if you have a Provincial Camping permit."
4833434,Mike Borger,2016-05-13 17:10:00,1554,You are not wrong.
4833482,prov1800,2016-05-13 17:23:00,5010,This type of rule is only for non resdents.as a resident you can camp on any crown land for a period of 21 days.this also goes for leaving a boat as a resident.21 days and it would have to be moved.
4833666,v-bay gord,2016-05-13 18:42:00,3168,"I could be wrong, but I think the two are different. You can camp for 21 days on the same spot before you need to move. If you leave a boat on a lake, even a resident, you need a boat cache permit (easy for a resident to get). The MNR will tag your boat saying you have 21 days to move it before they confiscate it. Maybe a subtle difference, but a difference all the same."
4833898,phishfearme,2016-05-13 20:08:00,1242,remember that thinks are different in Quebec vs Ontario - In Quebec you can have exclusive rights. and things vary within Ontario also but there are not exclusive rights - if you can get in you can fish - leaving boats though without an appropriate LUP is a no-no.
4834218,chris.brock,2016-05-13 22:46:00,112,"That's right.To add to that, (Ontario) boat cache permits are not always easy to get, even for residents there are logging and access roads on crown land that can't be used by just anyone in a motor vehicle, to protect outfittersin quite a few cases you can trespass while canoeing/ portaging"
4834338,Skywagon,2016-05-14 05:10:00,1106,"You are spot on Gord, except for the part about getting a boat cache. It is about impossible to get a new boat cache on a walleye and/or trout lake in our area anymore (even for an outfitter), a jackfish lake nobody wants to fish would be a different story. I have pursued this."
4834754,bigwillies,2016-05-14 07:30:00,515,So does a resident have to tell the mnr which lake they intend on putting the boat? Or can it go anywhere?
4834794,Obabikon,2016-05-14 07:39:00,2370,"By ""put"" do you mean leave?Anyone can take a boat/canoe to any lake that they wish. As long as they don't trespass to do so. To leave that boat there overnight... you have to get a permit for a boat cache. Unless you're camping."
