4834914,MikeG1,2016-05-14 08:04:00,434,We were discussing fish finders on another thread. Nice to chat again. I'll surely provide info upon my return. I'd also welcome hearing your experiences at Hebert. We are also in 26 the week of July 3- 10... Another gentlleman on this board will be in 26 the week befor me. This will be my first trip here so I'd welcome any of your experiences...suggestions. Mike.
4835090,Bigredmf,2016-05-14 08:42:00,129,"At Hebert there are fish everywhereOur first trip we stayed on the island and did not know where to start. The other group I was with started fishing about 10 minutes before us and had landed and released probably 20 eyes before we got out fishing on the back side of the island.We have had fronts go thru and slow things down for a day but if you keep jigging points and humps you will be good.I am trying to recall if it was there were there was a huge mayfly hatch and the eyes where spitting them out when we jigged them up. Things got slow so I dropped down to a 1/16 oz jig and that helped.The lake is pretty shallow so if you find yourself at the north end and were trying to get south in 30 mph winds it was a struggle with the Nadeens they used to have but with the Lunds it should help.Never had a map with the contours so you had to find the structure with your finder. We happened by a couple of spots where we drifted over a hump and had just about doubles on every drift for several hours.All reports are the fishing is better than it was 10 years ago.Jean and Eliane have invested nicely in the operation with the upgraded boats, motors, jackets, bbq's and nets and I am sure there is more. With their increased emphasis on conservation the lake should be strong for years.When I moved a few years ago I believe I lost my marked up maps but am confident I'll be on fish in 10 minutes.For years we tried to plan on a full moon trip and long-lining at night produces very good numbers. Make a point to troll at night!Red"
4835834,MikeG1,2016-05-14 15:35:00,434,We are very much looking forward to this trip.
4837170,octanehi5,2016-05-15 06:29:00,1104,"The number of night crawlers I bring per man,if they are 90% jigging is 500.Along with gulp alive,TriggerX. Numbers for one boat in a day can easily top 200 a day.There are alot of 40 to 60 foot bowls in the lake.In my opinion the south side near the island is over fished,5 camps on the island, only 2 in the north, The biggest deepest holes are all in the north,which hold the largest populations of fish.If I add it up I have spent 4 months worth of time on this Lake,With the imposed slot limit by Air Tam of 14 to 20""And only 4 fish,The numbers of larger fish has been growing steadily over the yrs.Our over the slot catches were from 21"" to 31"" we did not catch a 29"" The 31""was 11lbs largest fish caught that yr. by a guy who never fished for walleye.My group is only 6 weeks out.Yes this is a late ice out,it will not effect those going after mid june,earlier than that could be slow"
4731354,MikeG1,2016-04-12 17:48:00,434,We fly out 10:00am. On sun. July 3. Return flight at 10:00am. Can't wait.
4735866,youngknight,2016-04-14 09:42:00,228,Be sure to post a report. Thinking Hebert or Charlotte will be my next trip. You planning on chasing some pike or strictly walleye?
4736010,MikeG1,2016-04-14 10:28:00,434,"We will be targeting eyes primarily, but some pike too. I find throwing large spoons and cranks to be a nice break from hours of trolling / drifting. But, we'll not leave fish to find fish. Just happy to be going. I'll post upon return."
4736162,Andre (wallyandre),2016-04-14 11:09:00,2274,Mike if you want the map for the lake you can purchse the Navionics App on you're phone or tablet or even better you can get it on a Navionics+ card.
4737162,fishron,2016-04-14 17:31:00,317,"Mike, my group is fishing the week before you. We are trying to get a hard copy of the map that shows the lakes depth contours. Hebert has so many good walleye areas that it hardly seems necessary. Danielle, the camp custodian can put you onto good areas. He will probably mention that on Hebert, jigging is more productive than trolling. We have found this to be true. Take some swimbaits in the five to six inch sizes in bright colors. Rig them with large single belly weighted hooks. There great for pike and occasionally a good walleye. Much easier on the fish and you when it comes to unhooking. Jigging in the 18 to 24 ft range (sometimes deeper) is the ticket for walleye. If the weather blows up, get out and fish, if it's safe. The fastest action we've had comes with those conditions. There're big walleye to be had. I hope you and your buddies get into some."
4737434,MikeG1,2016-04-14 19:00:00,434,"I printed a few of the maps. I was able to access the map on line and I printed them in pieces and taped them together, it worked ok. I don't have a smart phone and the finder I'm bringing has an older mapping program that cannot be updated and doesn't have a slot for a card. I really thinking the map will work for us. the lakes I've been to before we didn't even have a map. I like the idea of swim baits. It gives me a reason to buy more stuff. Is it ok to boil the water and drink it. I was thinking we could use it for drink mixes like lemonade and coffee."
4739970,fishron,2016-04-15 15:22:00,317,"Mike, we do use the water from the lake for cooking and making coffee. The cabins have percolators and we make sure we make it strong and long. One of our guys has a small water purifying device that is guaranteed to produce water that's drinkable and won't set you up with intestinal parasites for years to come. Using the lake water cuts down on the weight of water you bring in for drinking and allows more room for staples like bourbon. Lot's of mosquitoes but none with zika. If your on the island you won't notice the bugs."
4748194,MikeG1,2016-04-18 17:06:00,434,.......Much thanks to all.
4834498,octanehi5,2016-05-14 06:17:00,1104,"As long as you boil it for 20 mins, its fine, For 6 guys in camp I also have them fly in two fresh water jugs (5 Gal ).One other thing to be aware of if you make ice for your beverages,make sure you boil that to, Beaver fever is no fun.as of today its still not ice out yet"
4834562,MikeG1,2016-05-14 06:41:00,434,"We are having 2 jufs delivered. im also bringing chlorine that ill put in the boiled water for insurance purposes. i understand only a 1/4 tsp. is needed to purify 1 gal. so, plans are to poil then chloiniate. I'm surprised to read there is still ice on lake. Is this typical? I thought it might be an early ice out this year. How many crawlers should I bring per person? What is the most common size jig....3/8? Thanks again for everything."
