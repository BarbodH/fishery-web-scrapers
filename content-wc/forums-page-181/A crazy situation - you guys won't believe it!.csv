5693458,kzoofisher,2017-07-31 08:37:00,5144,Suggestion for a compromise. Releasing an individuals camping records is an invasion of privacy but anonymous records are not. The MNR should send the FOIPPA applicant the records for the entire park from the April 1 through the date he made his request. Tell him that overall park usage is information in the public interest but the usage of individuals is not. Hope this helps.

I am totally on your side regarding this argument, but I am afraid this is about to fall under the ""no good deed goes unpunished"" category.In the 1990's, savvy fisherman on Lake Mille Lacs in Minnesota were totally up in arms when all of the ""secret"" mud flats and offshore structure were made available to anyone who could afford/install GPS equipment and chip data. What took these old-school guides decades to learn and master were now made available to every Tom-Dick-and-Harry. This is true for Rainy Lake, Lake of the Woods, and literally any good-sized lake you can think of.There is simply a growing segment of fisherman who want to get for nothing what took other fishermen years, or decades, to learn and master.I sincerely hope this ends up in your favor. But a gut feeling tells me it won't. Good luck."
5693482,LOW1,2017-07-31 08:43:00,2828,"It's not for you to decide what the purpose of the law is. Your and the ministry's obligation (and every else's) is to comply with it. If the law needs changing, then change it. But don't encourage the law to be violated for you benefit. Sorry to be blunt, but it seems very clear that you only abide by the laws that you agree with."
5693506,Shortline,2017-07-31 08:45:00,234,"Under the intent of freedom of info act, It seems to me that the fact that you got a permit should be public info......in the fact that you applied and paid for a gov't permit is a public revenue stream, and that is no big deal. The info should CEASE after that point, though in my opinion.Particular info on that permit should not be available to the public. If you paid by credit card, for instance......your cc# and receipt should be between you and the govt to secure payment. Your trip itinerary and personal plans are yours and yours alone, IMO. To try to get that info through the gov't is sneaky and cunning (I give props for the attempt), but to attempt to make it a legal issue just illustrates the lack of character of the ""investigator""."
5693514,3M TA3,2017-07-31 08:48:00,2846,"So Mike, this really isn't about revealing your fishing hot spots but about your right to privacy. Really, the fish has nothing to do with it then. I can understand that. This is a far greater matter than that for the MNR to resolve, one would think. It would seem though that you have opened this can of worms by reporting on something that others truly want and are willing to go beyond the norm to obtain it. I think that until the laws are changed, what and how you report ""certain things"" needs to be throttled back a bit. No need for folks wanting icing on their cake. Lesson Learned, perhaps. I don't know a thing, by the way, about your Canadian Laws."
5693530,Mike Borger,2017-07-31 08:50:00,1554,"I like it, as long as names aren't on the permit records. Kind of like someone paying their income tax in pennies LOL!Quote: Originally Posted by michigan walleye guy 2.0Hi Mike--I am sorry that your awesome (as usual) video and trip info. are being used for entirely wrong purposes.

But a gut feeling tells me it won't. Good luck.Thanks! Like I said in my post I received a letter from the MNR last week. They have decided to neither confirm nor deny the existence of the camping permit to the individual in question. It's highly unlikely the info will ever be released. If the person does appeal and wins, I then have 30 days to appeal myself. At that point I currently have 3 different lawyers salivating at the chance to take the case for me pro bono because the publicity would be huge.FWIW I was just interviewed on the topic this morning by a radio journalist from the CBC. It's a pretty big story."
5693538,Mike Borger,2017-07-31 08:51:00,1554,"You are clearly deluded, no doubt about that now."
5693554,Mike Borger,2017-07-31 08:57:00,1554,"It's about a lot of things. A persons right to privacy, and yeah for sure, revealing fishing hot spots. If any fish needs protection it's wild trophy sized brook trout from a lake 4 hours from southern Ontario.The laws don't need to be changed at all, they're fine the way they are. They simply need to be enforced or enacted for their given purpose.Most of what I write about and publicize are remote outfitters and camps where this would obviously not be an issue."
5693562,NP4ME,2017-07-31 08:59:00,378,"Mike, You are a true veteran on this site...you should know the way he thinks about things is beyond reason. Some of his posts never cease to amaze. This is just another to add to the list."
5693578,Mike Borger,2017-07-31 09:11:00,1554,"I'll be honest, I've never really noticed before until now. The only thing I'll admit is every person is entitled to their opinion. I might not like it, but I will respect it. So my apologies to LOW1 for calling him deluded."
5693122,Mike Borger,2017-07-31 06:36:00,1554,"Some of you already know about this, but I'm sure many don't and it's something worth telling.Back in May if you recall I did a 12 night canoe trip in the interior of Algonquin Park with my young son. For those who don't know, Algonquin is probably the most popular park in Canada. It lies an easy 3 hour drive north of Toronto and is visited by thousands upon thousands of people every year.Many of those people visit the park to fish the interior lakes for brook trout, something I've done myself for a great many years. Good brook trout fishing does exist, but it's hard to access, and the smaller lakes are exceedingly fragile. My son and I had an incredible trip catching a number of trophy sized brook trout between 5 and 6 pounds. I had a park biologist tell me that what we accomplished likely hadn't been duplicated since the year 1917. A bit tongue in cheek, but the point was clear. Trout fishing of that caliber in Algonquin in this day and age is more than just rare, it's the angling equivalent of winning the lottery and getting struck by lightning all in the same day. I put together an almost 40 minute video of the trip and made it purposefully vague. Vague for obvious reasons. This is not a fly in outpost camp or a lodge far off the grid. It's a lake that if its whereabouts was known it would be decimated very quickly. I first fished this lake more than 15 years ago, and have been keeping it in my back pocket ever since. This year I felt my son was old enough to tackle the challenge and I wanted to see if it was still as good as I remembered. It was.If you haven't seen the video, here it is: https://youtu.be/i9OSV-Q24F4?t=1sNothing I have ever published has garnered as much of a reaction as this, and at last count I had 127 different people messaging me directly asking for the name of the lake. I politely declined each one. Now here's where it gets interesting.A couple of weeks back I received a 5 page letter from the MNR's information management section. Someone had filed a claim under Canada's freedom of information and protection of privacy act. They were requesting a copy of my interior camping permit from the park. Each night in the park you must reserve a specific lake to camp on so if anyone had a copy of that permit they would easily know which lakes I fished.I had an hour long conversation with the official who sent me the letter. He seemed FAR more interested in following protocol to the letter rather than using common sense. Protection and preservation of our natural resources should be the primary mandate, but apparently not. In his words, because what I do can be construed as a business, it potentially opened the door a crack for this info to be released. Never mind the fact that this was a personal trip and the video in question isn't even monetized because it contains a Neil Young soundtrack.He wanted me to respond to him in writing covering a number of points in detail as to why the info shouldn't be released. They were slated to have a meeting about this last week and needed something to present as an argument.Well, I'm kinda busy this time of year, and I was more than a little bit mad. My email response to him was short and terse. Basically I said that my own right to privacy was being violated and that if a decision to release the info was made I'd contact every media outlet in North America. It's potentially a very big story, one that would set an enormous precedent for a great many anglers in the future.In any case I returned home from northern Manitoba on Saturday night and a letter was waiting for me from the MNR. The gist of it was this. Based on my email response to them they opted to ""neither confirm nor deny the existence of the information"" to the person who filed the request. LOL!It's potentially not over yet as I was informed the person who filed the request can now appeal. I truly hope and pray all of this goes away now, but time will tell.The fact someone would stoop to something so low and underhanded to find someone's fishing spot is frankly beyond belief to me. The way the MNR handled the whole thing rankles me as well. What they should have done is immediately denied the request. The fact that they're even entertaining the notion is ridiculous in my opinion. Pretty crazy stuff eh?"
5693130,Jesse-WI,2017-07-31 06:45:00,534,very sad indeed
5693218,LOW1,2017-07-31 07:38:00,2828,"The open records law should be complied with. Unless the law allows for an exception for this situation why shouldn't the permit copy be provided? And why do you feel that you have an exclusive right to a private fishing lake inside a national park?If the lake can't handle fishing pressure, close the lake to fishing.If the law needs to be changed, change the law. But until it is changed it should be complied with.And not confirming or denying is bueracratic BS if ever I heard any. How would you feel if you contacted the government's map department about a map and other information on a remote lake and the response you got was that they could neither confirm or deny that it exists?Perhaps the party who requested the information is a jerk. Or perhaps he is just creative and persistent."
5693274,Mike Borger,2017-07-31 07:50:00,1554,"You have seriously got to be kidding me LOL! Wow.Of the hundreds upon hundreds of people who have chimed in on this situation your response is the only one who thinks this way. I can only assume you don't fully understand the situation, or it was you who filed the request for information."
5693290,Doublelung76,2017-07-31 07:56:00,42,"Unbelievable,I have been quietly reading your stories and watching your vids for a while.u give so many people a awesome,free review of some of the best Canadian fishing and I thank you for that.the problem nowadays is everybody wants everything handed to them.i wouldn't blame u if you didn't ever post again.im totally envious of your trips and the results but the way I see it u do ur homework and earn it pal!your vid on Evans confirmed what I thought about Jim saari after talking to him in Harrisburg and lit a fire under my butt to start doing flyins and catch some gators.if there is anything this fishing community can do to help your cause let us know and would be glad to help!again thanks for the vids and info,they are so freaking inspiring for a esox addict like myself!"
5693322,Doublelung76,2017-07-31 08:04:00,42,"unbelievable-again! As fisherman and conservationists the solution is a no-brainer and anyone who feels otherwise is on the wrong side of the fence(the lazy,not wanting to fail in order to succeed side of the fence)"
5693330,LOW1,2017-07-31 08:06:00,2828,"It sure wasn't me who requested the information.Why do you feel the ministry has a right to violate the open records law to protect ""your"" lake?If the law allows the information to be withheld, fine. The requester then shouldn't get it. But the law should not be broken, for your or anyone else's benefit. Just curious - Are their any other Canadian laws which you feel are not applicable to you? All sorts of bad things happen when government officials pick and choose which laws to comply with and which to ignore."
5693362,LOW1,2017-07-31 08:11:00,2828,Obey the law. Don't pick and choose which laws to follow and which to ignore. Change the law if the law needs changing.It's the difference between anarchy and civil order. And the difference between democracy and dictatorship.
5693402,Mike Borger,2017-07-31 08:29:00,1554,"I abide by the law. The freedom of information act was NOT meant to be used in this way, if you can't see that then you're deluded. A record of someone's interior camping permit is private information. If it was released it would be a gross violation of my own right to privacy."
