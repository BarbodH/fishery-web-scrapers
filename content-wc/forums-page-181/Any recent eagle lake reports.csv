5710594,Remi,2017-08-09 19:47:00,41,"Thanks to Mike and Limeyangler both inspired me to post and share video. This is my first attempt at video, created a channel, not sure if that's normal, still trying to figure YouTube out. This one is more of a family slide show.https://youtu.be/4RnMJxYn84g"

5717066,skimottaret,2017-08-14 08:20:00,40,Fished Vermillion and Nash bays on Eagle the 11th of Aug with a guide we have been using for 8 years in hot calm and bright conditions and fishing was tough. 20-30' only and very light bites. lowest numbers ever with this guide who knows his stuff. Had been on Thaddeus during the week and again very slow walleye fishing with most in the camp giving up on walleyes and going musky fishing.
5717290,v-bay gord,2017-08-14 09:54:00,3168,"Too bad you only had the one day opportunity. Our experience (ie our guests) was the opposite.......good morning and evening bite happening anywhere from 18 feet and deeper in Vermilion Bay during the week of August 5 -12. Best results from a group that managed to score some leeches when they crossed the border.......but crawlers and minnows were also working. That said, it's fishing and everyone will have a different experience."
5717298,skimottaret,2017-08-14 09:59:00,40,We did get onto some fish but mid day fishing was probably not ideal in the conditions but unfortunately we only had one day and had to leave lake by 4pm to travel home. The bite at Thaddeus was very much early day and late evening but slow overall ime

5700250,v-bay gord,2017-08-03 16:18:00,3168,"Here's a 27 inch I caught 2 days ago on a Rapala Tail Dancer in 17 feet of water. Drop-offs, humps, weeds......all producing at intervals during the day. Crawlers, minnows. A 29 incher released this afternoon by a guest....jig and crawler in 24 feet."

5700642,Walleye will,2017-08-03 20:58:00,218,Thanks for the info! Will definitely pick up a flat of crawlers then. Will
5701578,pjshorthorn,2017-08-04 10:24:00,5654,Everyone knows that is Susanne's fish and you were just nice enough to pick it up out of the net for her. PjShorthorn
5701770,NARDA 1,2017-08-04 12:17:00,636,"This was my ""catch of the week"" from a couple of years back. It appears that the fishery is improving!!!"
5702330,v-bay gord,2017-08-04 19:47:00,3168,"Narda, I'm thinking most fish look small when you hold them......that's why Steve Herbeck and Joe Bucher look great holding muskies.....they both are midgets....."
