5719458,phishfearme,2017-08-15 15:12:00,1242,"although we decided not to go to mcinnes (we went to telescope with Viking) I can at least tell you my reasons for ruling it out. first, here's what's on the Viking web site: McInnes is a 25 mile long north/south lake located 70 to 95 miles north of Red Lake. We have 3 well spaced outposts, located in different parts of the lake. There is no other outfitter on the lake. All cabins are 4 bedroom with propane fridge, chest freezer and stove with oven. Hot/cold running water with shower. All cabins have a deck to enjoy sunsets. This lake hosts walleye, northern and lake trout. The walleye in McInnes are of a larger average size than in our other lakes. The lake is divided into sections. The main body and northern arms are deep and provide habitat for lake trout and structure for great late summer/fall walleye fishing. The east shore and south end are shallow and home to great walleye/northern fishing. This lake is an experienced fisherman's dream, but yet provides great opportunity for the novice fisherman. there's a number of code words in this - such as ""experienced fisherman's dream"" and ""walleye are larger than average"". to me this is exactly how one could describe a oligotrophic lake - one that is deep, cold and infertile - ie: a lake trout lake. these lakes tend to be not good for walleye but the ones that are there are larger than average. they are also hard to catch (experienced fisherman) and would probably require deep trolling anytime except early spring. so, take it for what it's worth - we selected telescope which is mainly oligotrophic but has large areas of traditional walleye/pike area - and were happy we did. our second choice was dolphin from which you can access mcinnes - maybe this is a better option for you. and also, the carlsons are EXCELLENT outfitters - bringing us in an emergency gin delivery phish"

Reasons for choosing this lake were access to multiple other lakes, classic walleye structure, and placement of the cabin. Just seemed like the right choice for us. My girlfriend and I finished the week with 250+ walleye, with many in the 21-24"" range. Could've caught more if my gf had her sh@t together. Lol. Every typical walleye spot held fish. Wind blown points/breaks close to deeper water."
5720402,zeebee,2017-08-16 07:14:00,1144,"The reasons u stated as presenting possible negatives are the reasons I choose this lake. Ive fished many oligotrophic lakes and as long as they are not subject to over fishing, they are my preferred bodies of water. Fish tend to be big. I fished Trout lake north of Red lake which is quite a bit larger than Mcinnes and took PB's of 33 lbs laker and 47"" northern in consecutive years. Walleye were in the hundreds and averaged 22-24"". They do fish different than shallow lakes but that is no biggee. The option for lakers is nice as I fly in a portable DR.Ive heard good things about outfitter so thats a key. This is a 10 day fly in, smaller lakes become too familiar after 3 days."
5720930,spooled,2017-08-16 11:19:00,30,"Go! Talk to Craig and get his intel on locations. I was there in Sept. of last year Moose hunting and fishing. Stayed in middle camp. There were several hour long periods where it was physically impossible to catch more fish. I'm serious. Lure hits the bottom and you get hit! We fished from 12' out to 40' and there were walleye at every depth. Most fish were between 18""-22"". We stopped using the net the first day and were swinging 22"" walleye over the side like a bass fisherman. Pike on every point. The lake trout were deep at that time so we didn't catch many. It takes a little time to figure out how they bite. One experienced guy could catch 40 fish an hour and the newby would catch 5. Same gear. PM me and ill give you more intel. Top notch outfitter! If I had the time I would go every year and nowhere else. Mark"
5721610,zeebee,2017-08-16 17:26:00,1144,Thanks ....your comments are much appreciated.
5721634,phishfearme,2017-08-16 17:34:00,1242,"I want to go to that lake and learn from you. hundreds averaged 23 inches - so you didn't catch any 15/16 inchers?? for each 16 incher you would need to catch a 30 incher to get that average. you are clearly the best fisherman ever, fishing the best lake ever. phisih"
5721786,zeebee,2017-08-16 19:07:00,1144,"Dont forget the big lakers and NP's tadpole. 100's of walleye on a 7 day fly--in are common. As for math...let me correct myself....by far, the most common size were 22-24""...happy?If you go fishing with me, you better be the ""best"" swimmer."
