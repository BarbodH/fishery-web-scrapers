5711490,fldoc1,2017-08-10 08:06:00,69,Our group will be going to the Morson area and fish west towards Miles Bay and beyond. We will be going the first week of Sept. At Marine General in Duluth they talked about using downriggers on LOW. I am wondering if anyone has used downriggers and how they worked on the Canadian side of LOW. My wife and I go in early June each Year and bottom bounce with crawlers. This really works for her as she is a passive type fisherlady. She really is does not get jigging for walleyes. I am thinking that I will bottom bounce to locate walleyes and then jig or use a slip bobber. I had not thought of bringing one of my downriggers. Randy from Duluth
5711754,U D,2017-08-10 09:43:00,249,Down riggers only work on the American Side.I couldn't resist.
5711866,fldoc1,2017-08-10 10:53:00,69,OK - I sure left an opening for that comment. I have only fished the American side in the winter. My boat is not that big so have focused on the Morson area to get wind protection from the islands. With almost no islands I wonder if the American side is like fishing lake superior where one is exploring vast water areas in search of roving fish. I see the Canadian side going out of Morson as having islands everywhere which provides more visible structure to fish. There are still larger open areas but with lots of water less than 20 feet. Miles Bay does have some 30+ foot water so curious. Randy from Duluth
5711874,reconssd,2017-08-10 10:56:00,147,"Good one U D. I haven't used down riggers in Canada. However, I have used dipsy divers and dipsy rods with great success. It doesn't matter what body of water. If you really want to have a blast, run some j-plugs while you are up there. It really doesn't matter what color, because the action of the j-plug drives them crazy."
5713754,fldoc1,2017-08-11 09:31:00,69,Thanks. I have dipsy divers and J-plugs for Lake Superior so a nice option. Randy from Duluth
5714474,fishpoop,2017-08-11 17:28:00,630,"https://webapp.navionics.com/?lang=e...y=mspkHzd%60_Q Scrolling/zooming around the Navioncs Miles Bay map the deepest water I see is around 36 feet. Which leads me to wonder if downriggers are even needed? Between bottom bouncers, dipsy divers, snap weights, etc, you should be able to get a crankbait or crawler harness down that deep if needed. It's kind of up to you how you want to fish but I think you could get by without them. Now, if you were going to Whitefish Bay then I could see bringing them."
5716666,lakerbreaker,2017-08-13 20:16:00,253,"Ran one pass with downriggers last week in sabaskong around the hay island basin area...in the time it took us to get set up and go about a half mile with no bites, my brother in law got 3 eyes jigging ...needless to say we abandoned it and went to jigging and drop shotting...we had them on the boat for laker fishing already so it was no trouble but not sure if I would bring them just for rigging the Canadian side...quite a few nets out so be on the lookout..."
5716794,stjoeguy,2017-08-13 21:39:00,979,"Hey Randy, I was just up at Lake of the Woods near Morson for the first time. We launched at Buena Vista Resort and stayed on an island near Buff Island. We fished as far west at Comegan Island and maybe 10 miles east of Buff. My experience was that there were a lot of islands but not much deep water or structure. Mostly vast areas of 18-22'. We vertical jigged where we could find structure such as near marker buoys and some mid-lake humps. We got our limits in two days but worked for them. Most fish were found in 16-18'. The biggest were 24.25, 22.5 and 21.5. There were quite a few small saugers along the way. Four of us wound up with 16 walleyes or saugers, 6 perch and a 12' crappie. The crappie was nice but it was the only one we got. Our best spot was near the west end of the channel along the south side of Comegan Island. I don't use downriggers but I don't think the area would be right for downriggers. Bottom bouncers or trolling Rapalas would probably be better. It wasn't my trip or my boat, and we were four guys in the boat, so I was vertical jigging like the rest of the crew, but in the last five minutes, as everyone else was storing gear, I started pitching jigs toward shore and working them back the way I do on St. Joe and got 3 hits on 3 casts. Have a good trip. Paul"
5717018,Shorelunch,2017-08-14 07:49:00,554,"Been fishing out of Morson for a long time. Jig and minnow/plastics/leech whatever, trolling spinners with minnows/leech/crawlers or plastics and bottom bouncer, trolling or casting cranks and produced walleyes time and time again. There's endless structure to fish. In Sept, you can try bottlenecks/current, sand/points/weeds, windblown points with jigs or any other method above. There is limitless structure and spots to try."
5717026,lakerbreaker,2017-08-14 07:58:00,253,Bring dropshot stuff along too...we couldn't buy a fish on anything else one morning...a lot easier to just slide a sinker on than retie a jig when fishing snaggy areas too...
