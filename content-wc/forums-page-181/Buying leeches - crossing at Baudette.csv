5711522,fldoc1,2017-08-10 08:14:00,69,We will be going to LOW near Morson in early Sept. and wonder if there is anyplace to buy leeches in Canada once one crosses the border at Baudette. Randy from Duluth
5711954,BornToFish,2017-08-10 11:32:00,1224,"Greetings,It might be difficult to buy leeches anywhere in NW Ontario in early September as leech season typically winds down by early August. If you find an outlet, consider calling them fairly soon and reserve some leeches for early September. Even then, they might not be in the greatest shape.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5712802,The tank,2017-08-10 19:02:00,340,I'm up there now I couldn't find any leeches anywhere. Was told leeches are done for the year.
5713098,martinbns,2017-08-10 20:58:00,1520,"I bought leeches today in Kenora at Sunrise baits. That being said, all the fish we caught today were on minnows, waste of $10."

5714242,The tank,2017-08-11 13:53:00,340,That's where I called before I left home. And there the ones who told me that thay couldnt get any more. The big bait shop on 11 just off the lake.
