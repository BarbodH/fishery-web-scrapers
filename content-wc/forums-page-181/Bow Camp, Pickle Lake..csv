Weather was with us & no rain the whole trip. Saw 5 moose on the way up to Pickle & 4 on Bow itself. Encountered 2 40""+ Pike, but did not boat them. Nice average size walleye(about 19"") with quite a few 20+ up to 26"". Also saw a couple sturgeon. Short float plane flight in. Good trip."
5701778,Guest,2017-08-04 12:26:00,0,I have been to Bow twice but it was before Dwight bought the camp- I think over 10 yrs ago. We always had that type of luck and perfect size lake to get around in camp boats with 8HP. I didn't realize he opened them back up to fishing I had heard he was only doing moose hunts with few groups strictly for fishing.
