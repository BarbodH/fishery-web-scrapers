5721050,lazermule,2017-08-16 12:19:00,86,"If this is true, then the flat that leads around the bend (SW) to Vaughn lake would be nearly dry? I was out that way in late June and we had areas of 1 1/2 to 2 feet in that area. Last weekend I was in Deception Bay and level was down but not 2 feet down from late June. LM"
