5707274,johnboat,2017-08-08 09:37:00,2014,"If it's your first time pulling, my advise is take a test run before you go. In a lot of cases it's one persons boat and another guys truck. So, if possible, take a test ride with the boat hooked up to the truck that will be pulling it. Different height trucks, will you need a drop hitch, does he have the right size ball, are the safety chains long enough, what type plug does he have for electrical? Dont even get me started on whether the trailer lights will work! Ha! It might seem trivial, but it's sure hard to find stuff you need or switch stuff out at 5:00a.m. when you are packed full and chomping at the bit.Which brings me to my second bit of advise. Your boat is a boat. Not a 18 wheeled flatbed capible of hauling everything you throw in it! If you ask me, overloading your boat is the #1 reason for blown tires and busted springs and axles. (Assuming reasonable care and maintenance has been taken with the trailer.) Heck, even the way you load your boat can make a difference. To much weight in the back, not enough tounge weight, your trailer will be swaying back and forth and will drive you crazy on a long trip.Good luck and happy pulling."
5707418,steve.a,2017-08-08 11:12:00,274,I carry a lot of tools now after having a problem without the needed stuff. I never had a problem for many years and felt over confident until it happened. I think my problem started with sticky caliper bushings but it is hard to say after a bearing fail. There is a lot more to go wrong when you have four brakes on the trailer.
5708018,Baseline,2017-08-08 17:49:00,3207,"I carried a spare hub for 25 years. It finally happened to my snowmobile trailer while returning from a ice fishing trip. It sure was nice to have that hub, slip it on, bolt on the tire and get going."
5713170,still fishin',2017-08-10 23:33:00,69,"If you lock your spare to the trailer, make sure you can open the lock before you leave."
5703034,outdoorsron,2017-08-05 10:57:00,843,"Hello: Don't know why guys take so many extra parts. If you have maintained and inspected your equipment your good to go. As far as the tow vehicle if something happens to it you can't repair it yourself anymore. Used to be if you carried plugs , points , dist. cap and fuel filter you could probably get it going. Been going to Canada for over 30 years and drove to Alaska 2 times , only problems were flat tires. Good Luck. O - R"
5703122,Babamel2,2017-08-05 12:24:00,414,"I try to give the axles a shot of grease just prior to unloading. That way there is a little pressure on the bearing buddy so that as the hub & grease contract as they cool, the bearing buddy absorbs the difference. This minimizes the possibility of grease entering the inside of the hub."
5703146,Multispecies Guy,2017-08-05 13:00:00,447,"Interesting technique. I'm assuming you meant ""water"" instead of ""grease"" in your last sentence."
5703154,fishpoop,2017-08-05 13:07:00,630,"First trip to Canada got 40 miles from home and had a trailer tire peel the tread on a 1 year old tire. It didn't go flat and was properly inflated. How often do you hear of a tire peeling? Second trip to Canada, Ethanol gas ate a small hole in the line under the cowl causing the motor to run lean and scorch a cylinder. No way of knowing or preventing it before hand that I can think of. This was when ethanol was first being used and outboards weren't set up for it. You couldn't find non ethanol gas anywhere at the time. Had the motor rebuilt. Third trip. Rebuilt block cracked. Bought brand new motorFourth trip to Canada, last day of the trip new motor wouldn't start had to get towed back to resort. Got home, can't remember exactly what part but some small part on the carburetor linkage came loose and got sucked into the carburetor. Warranty repair.Fifth trip to Canada. Got to the resort and notice the trailer bow stop roller was missing. It was tight with no sign of damage when I pulled out of the garage at home. Have no idea to this day where on the road I lost it, how or why.Sixth trip, water pump impeller failed. This one I'll admit I should have changed the previous fall. Other than the water pump impeller, none of these failures were normal maintenance items.My last trip to Canada in 08 actually had no breakdowns! Yay!! Couldn't believe it."
5703330,rickn,2017-08-05 15:55:00,993,"We were in Canada in June, brother got gas from the resort. Crappie gas! Plugged the fuel filter, motor would only idle. He had a new filter with him.fixed it right up! Just a bit tricky changing it from the boat side!"
5703546,btyreprich,2017-08-05 20:38:00,1067,Ere are a few items in out boat trailer tub: Disposable latex gloves to keep your hands clean when greasing the Bearing Buddies Road flares which I store in a welders brazing rod case to keep the flares dry Inexpensive hydraulic jack from Harbor Freight - car jacks dont always work on trailers Assorted fuses Replacement trailer light bulbs Roll of duct tape - boat covers are always getting holes in them from long highway drives
5706178,steve.a,2017-08-07 15:21:00,274,"I carry a small floor jack that came in a plastic carry case from Sears I think and has came in very handy. Also I carry two hubs. A couple of pieces of cardboard is nice to have as coveralls, rubber gloves, flashlights, breaker bar with right size sockets are also good. I have a tandem trailer so I carry a length of chain with a splice link that I can hold up an axle off the ground until I find a good place to do a hub replace. A big dose of patience is needed also"
5706762,outdoorsron,2017-08-07 22:59:00,843,"Hello: My guess as to why people have bearing trouble is because of bearing buddies. Bearing buddies do not replace actual yearly inspection of hub assemblies , bearings , seals and repacking the bearings. Just remember DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN THE AXLE NUT. A bit loose is better than tight Just my opinion. Have been trailering for over 30 years , never had any bearing trouble. Good Luck . O - R"
5706922,MrSimon,2017-08-08 06:49:00,922,"I do agree that proper maintenance is ESSENTIAL and will eliminate most problems .... but not all. I have a fully stocked tool bag that I've put together over the years. It's funny what tools you don't think about until you are stuck somewhere and need something specific you don't have. There is some great advice in this thread already. Here are a few of the weird things I've needed over the years. BIG wrenches - axles nuts, hitch ball nuts, etc Complete electric kit - shrink tubing, fuses, wire, connectors, etc Drill and bits Random nuts, bolts, washers Extra ratchet straps and bungee cords JB Weld & 3M 5200 It might seem like a bunch of stuff ... and overkill .... but if you pack it all in one big duffel bag and just toss it in the truck, it's easy insurance."
5707194,Lake Wisconsin,2017-08-08 08:47:00,1960,"The one piece of advice I did not see - SLOW DOWN on rough roads. I see these folks just flying over the bumps and the trailer actually getting air. My brother is one of these guys - and his axle broke (near his house thankfully). Took him 2 months during prime fishing time to get it back and running. Most boat trailers are ran on simply leaf springs. They work fine, but you need to keep in mind these are not the same suspension as your towing rig."
5701258,dutchbuoy,2017-08-04 07:45:00,6,"So we are heading across the border again for a week of fishing, but we will be pulling a boat behind us for the first time. Looking for advice on preparation, tools, etc to take along to minimize any roadside issues that could come up?"
5701322,skindzier,2017-08-04 08:32:00,137,"1.) Functional spare tire (check it before you leave, including the pressure) 2.) Trailer wheel bearing grease. Don't know how far you'll be pulling it. At minimum, grease before you leave home and before you leave camp. If you are going a long way like we do from Denver, grease again during the trip. 3.) If you don't already have a transom saver, get one. 4.) If it is an older trailer, make sure you have spare bulbs (newer trailers are much more forgiving when launching after forgetting to unhook the harness) 5.) Leave a spare plug in the boat"
5701402,bus33,2017-08-04 08:54:00,289,1. Good Spare 2. Floor Jack and 4 way lug wrench 3. Wheel Blocks 4. Grease Gun 5. I used to carry parts to rebuild hubs but now carry two new hubs to just replace if necessary. They are not that expensive and rebuilding hubs on side of road sucks. 6. Electrical tools to repair lights if necessary.
5701530,emma17,2017-08-04 09:59:00,436,"Great advice on the 4-way lug wrench. We had a tire blow just over the border last week. It was the wrong time to discover the lugs holding the spare tire were a different size than the lugs on the wheel. Thankfully we had an adjustable wrench on hand. On a related subject, has anyone experienced vibration/shuttering in the tow vehicle at 70 mph when pulling a trailer? I've read it may be unbalanced wheels on trailer, but why at higher speeds, and why not all the time?"
5702298,downriverbob,2017-08-04 19:08:00,880,"Guys have been trailing to Lake of the Woods one way 1,000 miles for over 20 years. A couple of additions to the others list is a pair of light weight coveralls will help keep you clean. Even though I have a single axle trailer I have carried a second spare tire mounted on a rim. I lost a tire/rim one the first years going up and was not going to go back home without a spare so had to purchase a very expensive replacement in Sioux Narrows, Ontario. On the way home one year lost two tires and was glad I had two spares. Also before you leave back lug nuts off and put anti-seize on the lugs, save you problems down the road. Also a set of road flares or LED road flares will help you have a problem while traveling a night/early in morning. Bob"
5702578,outdoorsron,2017-08-04 22:57:00,843,"Hello : If you properly inspect and pack your wheel bearings before you leave there is no reason for bringing any extra parts or grease gun. I have traveled thousands of miles with no problems. A spare tire or two yes how many you need it's your decision. Inspect the condition of the tires . Tires also have manufacturing dates on them. In my opinion if they are over 5 years old I would replace them if you are traveling longer distances. Completely inspect the trailer for broken welds , broken bolts, the ball hitch , axle bolts and spring bolts and hardware , wiring but most of the wiring will be hidden. Does the trailer have brakes? The brakes may need adjustments and servicing. Good Luck. O - R"
5702626,fishpoop,2017-08-05 03:13:00,630,Maybe pack along a couple of blocks of wood as a jack base support in case you have to change a tire on a soft/muddy road shoulder so the jack doesn't sink into the dirt.
5702834,Multispecies Guy,2017-08-05 07:54:00,447,I've heard of guys taking an extra leaf spring if they have a lot of gravel road to travel. Lots of good suggestions above. Take as much as you have room/towing capacity for. Better safe than sorry. Have a great trip.
5702858,fishpoop,2017-08-05 08:09:00,630,"Something to keep in mind when traveling in Canada; distance between towns may be far, repair shops for boat/motor/trailer/tow vehicle may be few, and parts may be even fewer without a special order that might take days to a week to get. With that in mind, it's better to be prepared and bring as many spare parts as you can pack. Don't count on them be easily available. My motto is: It's better to have and not need than need and not have. I've had more than a few Canada fishing trips screwed up by mechanical breakdowns. Don't know if I'm cursed or not but it seems that if something is going to breakdown it will do it in Canada and not on my local lake. lol"
