We intended to fish walleye SE of Wylie Point just above Big Narrows on a series of spots we had good luck on a few weeks ago. All day nothing, a few SM Bass on minnow tipped jigs where the walleye should have been, we casted for Bass a bit, one little one. Then around 4:00 pm I decided to try one last hump that had been productive before, sonar showed nothing, I decided to heave my jig and minnow as far away from the boat as possible and drag/pop it back to the boat and voila, walleye. After 7 hours of nothing, I caught a fish including several very nice ones almost every time I tossed it out. Probably 40 or so total, drive my wife nuts, every time she tried it she got snagged. Beautiful 9 hour day on the lake with 2 hours of catching and 7 hours of nothing."
