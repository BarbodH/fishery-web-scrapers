What ever you do do not bring more then 20 dozen minnows apiece across the border. Huge fine and turned them around to comeback another time Anny other ques send me a message."
5700994,BornToFish,2017-08-04 05:37:00,1224,"Greetings,I fished Glitter Lake in the late 1980s with a small group of anglers. This trip was essentially before the advent of sonar units. We had a hand drawn map of the lake with a few ""X""s drawn on the map to guide us to the ""hot spots"". We did okay in terms of numbers of walleyes, but do not remember catching many fish over twenty inches or so. I also recall catching some nice smallies and northern pike.Consider doing a search of the Canada forum for ""Glitter Lake"". There are three other threads out there for you to discover. Here is a link to one of these threads:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...t=glitter+lakeThe previous post mentions a limit of twenty dozen salted minnows per person crossing the border. I believe the limit is ten dozen salted minnows per person.I hope that you guys have a great trip and make some great memories together.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

5715858,pinwheeled,2017-08-13 07:33:00,181,Buy your live bait from NWO. Cost is about the same and you don't have to worry about crossing the boarder or salting.
