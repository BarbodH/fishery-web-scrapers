5715746,Multispecies Guy,2017-08-13 06:05:00,447,Going to Shoal Lake Lodge on Sept 9-16 for a primarily SMB/pike trip but may have time for some musky fishing. Can anyone familiar with that area give me a little guidance on what musky lures/colors to take? I have room for 2-3 Plano trays so I need just the basics. Thanks and I will post a fishing report upon my return.

5715818,Multispecies Guy,2017-08-13 07:13:00,447,"Thanks, I will check out your report. My first trip at any time of year to that area. I have to limit my musky arsenal due to space in the boat (boat-in camp). It's a trip with wife and grown daughter who are not ""pound the water from dawn to dusk"" types. Wife will quilt in the cabin most of the day and daughter will be up for 4-5 hours on the water so I have some time to chase muskies. While I won't turn down advice on specific spots, I mostly want advice on which 10-12 lures and in what colors to have with me."

Dotted with wonderful bass/musky habitat.Top waters, blades. suicks....whatever the fish tell they want. Bring along at least one 10/13"" jake/grandma and troll while your arms rest.It is illegal to target walleye downriver of Ash rapids.One hasn't fished LOW until they've fished the ""Lab"""
