5714842,Mike Borger,2017-08-11 22:16:00,1554,"As many of you guys know my young son and I traveled to Gangler's Burnie Lake outpost in far northern Manitoba July 22-29.The entire premise of this trip was to show that trophy sized pike could indeed be caught in the heat of mid summer, and not just early spring when they're stacked in the bays.Well, we did just that. Emphatically. My boy and I set a new 2 man camp record catching 40 trophies during our week. My boy also set a new camp record for the largest fish ever recorded at that camp, a fat 461/2 inch fish, AND he caught it on a topwater lure. I was quite proud. Worth noting I consider 40 and up a trophy. The so called Manitoba Master Angler size for pike is 41. So it was forty fish between 40 and 461/2 inches. I was told it was a record, so who am I to argue? It's a pretty awesome story, definitely worth checking out!http://www.canadafishingguide.net/su...ielakeoutpost/If you'd rather just watch a video I pieced together this full length highlight reel of the entire trip:https://youtu.be/G3fRO5X1ags?t=1sHope you enjoy, Cheers, Mike"

5714914,Shellback,2017-08-12 05:36:00,8083,Great Adventure! Glad to see you are still posting. I thought all the BS from your other trip would sour you from sharing your adventures. A big thanks from me for sharing!
5714938,ToxicAngler,2017-08-12 06:08:00,30,Congratulations to you and your boy! I've watched the videos on YouTube and what an experience. So many big fish caught.
5714962,HeHooksHimself,2017-08-12 06:16:00,725,Can you possibly get bored with trophy pike? It sure looks like Brendan is developing into a great fisherman. This is the first video with the two of you that I really got the impression that he was your partner more than your kid. Great days! Fish On! Hooks

You're so right about my son, he's really progressed a LOT this year. We're a perfect team in the boat!"
5715074,Mike Borger,2017-08-12 07:14:00,1554,Have to say this. I just spoke with Ken Gangler and Brendan's 461/2 was not a camp record. That title goes to a 49 caught a few years back. There was some mis information relayed to me about that and it's my fault. As a writer I should have checked.It's not really a big deal for anyone other than my kid. He's been yapping about it non stop for two weeks now and he'll be crushed LOL! This morning he's going to learn a small lesson in humility I think.
5715394,Lazy Fisherman,2017-08-12 14:25:00,276,"Mike, Thanks for sharing your trip report. Sounds like you and your son had a great time."
5716066,dhottle,2017-08-13 09:37:00,163,Great report & pictures Mike. Your son is definitely developing an accomplished anglers swagger. Keep up the reports & videos.
