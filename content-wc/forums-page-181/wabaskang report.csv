The lake is down 2 - 2 1/2 feet in my opinion & the usual spots for us held little fish. We would catch a fish here n a fish there. The daughter/son-in-law found them in water that is at least 25 feet deep. The fish weren't 25 feet deep but the water was n had to be that deep to produce. Trolling deeper wally divers is what worked for them in a wonder bread pattern. The daughter caught n returned a 29"" er for big walleye of the week for us. Big Nose n the bay to the north into the river was the most productive. The roads going up from Ft Frances were being worked on but really didn't delay us at all. BUT, slow down for the bump signs immediately as the bump might be next to the sign or a half block down the road n some are car bottoming jolts. Later, Jay"
