5722834,John N,2017-08-17 11:29:00,362,A question from my friend Tom S. who wasn't able to log in: I enjoyed six fly-in Canadian fishing adventures in the 1970s and would like to have a repeat performance! Can anyone recommend a service out of either Fort Frances (Rainy Lake) or Kenora and relate a little information about any recent experience? Thanks in advance for your thoughts!
