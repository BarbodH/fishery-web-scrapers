We usually only up there in the Spring, but I will be back up up for a Fall trip this year as well to close up the cabin. What are some pointers on fishing the area up there for Fall Musky, Walleye, Smallies etc... The Spring I like to run alot of jerkbaits and swimbaits and have tons of luck. Will it be similar? What are your recommendations!"
