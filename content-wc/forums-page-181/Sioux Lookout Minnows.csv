5721898,martinbns,2017-08-16 20:46:00,1520,I pay $5/dozen for mediums in Kenora.
5722026,gaspumper,2017-08-17 05:10:00,73,I thought you were only allowed 120 minnows per person in Ont. 4 guys 4x120=480 minnows in your possession.
5722034,JAY221,2017-08-17 05:17:00,877,"I believe the 120 is when you are talking salted minnows & bringing them across the border. Later, Jay"
5722090,martinbns,2017-08-17 05:57:00,1520,"Just thinking out loud to myself, how would you keep the minnows alive for that long? You would need an aerated tank or something. IF you are staying at an isolated camp on an island or something, why not just bring along a minnow trap?"
5722154,Crede,2017-08-17 06:41:00,134,I do not think this is correct. The 2017 Ontario Fishing Regulations Summary limits baitfish to 120 per person. It does not separate out live vs. preserved.
5722186,law57,2017-08-17 06:52:00,1147,"Years ago we used to stay for a week - 4 of us. We'd buy all of our minnows in Dryden and transport them to the lake in coolers with ice. At the lake we put them in a 5 gallon pail. We drilled small holes in the pail to let fresh water in, put a rock inside to sink the pail, snapped the top on tight and sink the pail in 6-8 feet of water. Those minnows made it the week with no problems. Now, the resort has fresh minnows delivered."
5722242,gaspumper,2017-08-17 06:59:00,73,Baitfish 120 Includes those caught and/or purchased. See list of permitted baitfish species.
5722250,gaspumper,2017-08-17 07:00:00,73,"Only resident anglers may capture baitfish, using the methods outlined below. One baitfish trap no more than 51 cm (20 in.) long and 31 cm (12.2 in.) wide can be used day or night. Baitfish traps must be clearly marked with the licence holder's name and address."
5722762,milfish,2017-08-17 10:40:00,249,"Wow I never knew there was a limit on how many minnows one guy can have. We have been purchasing 30 to 40 dozen per guy for the last 20 years and have never been told by the dealers that we were over the allowed amount. I will check with our wholesaler and find out if we've been in violation. We have the inner part of an old washing machine that is about 30 inches in diameter made of stainless steel and full if small holes. We then made a spring loaded, hinged, lockable treated lumber top with handles. we load the minnows in the container and then sink in about 5 feet of water off the dock. Keep in mind we are there the later part of September/early October and the water temp is cooling down. Over the course of the week we might loose a couple of dozen but we have the bigger minnows that we like and don't have to bother the camp store early in the morning to replenish our bait wells. We never have more that 10 dozen per guy in the boat while we are fishing so maybe we're O.K."
5717466,milfish,2017-08-14 11:13:00,249,"We are going to Chamberlain Narrows the first week in October. We are looking to purchase a large order of extra large minnows. The supplier we have used in the past is gone and the minnows we received last year were very small. Any ideas for a supplier that can provide us with 150 dozen large minnows? We can pick them up any where from Dryden to Sioux lookout. Thanks, Milfish"
5717554,bigwalleye1,2017-08-14 11:50:00,2632,"Check with Deb at J&D baits in Sioux Lookout. 807-737-2980. South of the Hudson turnoff by about 3 miles, west side of the road. Small red sign. As you cross through the bridge construction, they're just pat the top of the hill on your left."
5717570,x4flatfish,2017-08-14 11:53:00,319,Try JD Bait and tackle just south of Sioux Lookout. Never used them and don't use minnows. 807-737-2980 Can't your outfitter help you?
5718154,pjshorthorn,2017-08-14 17:56:00,5654,"This !!!!!!!! Deb "" The Minnow Lady"" is the best. Tell her the oxygen cylinder guy recommended them too. She may not remember the reference as it was close to 15 years ago, but you never know. I would call them soon to make sure they would have everything you need for your trip. Tell Ken and Brenda howdy for me too......they may only remember me as a fella that did some solo trips to LSO. Back in 2012 and 2013 during the fall. Have a great trip on the Seul. PjShorthorn"
5718218,David Anderson,2017-08-14 19:17:00,2073,We stop at Ojibway baits just as you come into Sioux Lookout. Vicki always has a great selection of Minnows however you probably need to call ahead as 150 dozen Large minnows could be as much as 2 gallons worth
5720130,law57,2017-08-16 04:31:00,1147,"I have no idea where you can get minnows near Sioux Lookout. But it made me think, with an order that big, maybe the minnow supplier will fly them to you at your destination resort?I see the minnow guy drop into the resort that I frequent often. He's got a little piper with the doors removed. That thing can take off in a bath tub! He just drops in, dumps off a few bags of fresh minnows and away he goes. I'd check with your outfitter or resort owner to see if the minnows can be delivered to you - fresh and no transportation worries. WTH - it might be worth a try."
5720218,martinbns,2017-08-16 05:34:00,1520,"Out of curiosity, how many of you and for how long are you going that you would need 1800 large minnows?"
5720946,milfish,2017-08-16 11:27:00,249,Four guys one week and we will use them all most likely
5721042,lazermule,2017-08-16 12:10:00,86,"And my curiosity, what is the going rate for minnows in the area? I always use crawlers, and at $3.50 CN/dozen at Ojibway baits I didn't think that was too bad. I'd like to try minnows at some point but don't know what to expect for price. I have herd of as much as $1 each but haven't looked myself. LM"
5721258,bigwalleye1,2017-08-16 13:24:00,2632,Resort prices are around $6 a dozen usually. Bulk price may be half or 60% of that on a purchase that large.
