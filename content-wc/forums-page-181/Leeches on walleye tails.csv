5721618,phishfearme,2017-08-16 17:28:00,1242,"Ricky - I think you found it - but there is still little on this Wikipedia link (and other links) that address if these are native to the north or anything about their natural history. will do some additional searching. thanks, phish"
5722498,Ricky Spanish,2017-08-17 08:50:00,1298,"This was my favorite bit: But leech taxonomy and systematics will eventually be revised in due time, not because there are many uncertainties about their phylogeny, but because the major clades of clitellate annelids  and whether the clitellates are themselves a clade  have not been fully elucidated.I bet those leech biologists are a riot at parties."
5722778,phishfearme,2017-08-17 10:47:00,1242,obliviously you are a man of fine extinction for elucidating the afore mentioned tributaries. wild and crazy guy!!
5662754,phishfearme,2017-07-13 13:29:00,1242,I've wondered about these for years - small leeches attached to mainly the tails of walleyes. see photos. - how do they get there in the first place? - do you remove them to help out the walleye or just let them be as part of the natural environment - are they baby leeches that drop off when mature to reproduce? any natural history of these would be appreciated. phish
5662850,Bill Krejca,2017-07-13 13:57:00,6107,"Hmmm.. never have seen green ones. I pull the black ones off, if I notice. Seems like I've seen them more (black ones) on pike, but maybe I haven't looked, will start looking now, just to see what's up. Bill"
5662866,Ricky Spanish,2017-07-13 14:06:00,1298,"Curious about this, too. Maybe v-bay gord or prov1800 will chime in, as I noticed they are on many/most of the walleyes we catch at Eagle Lake."
5719426,phishfearme,2017-08-15 14:56:00,1242,"well - with no response from the WC crowd I asked the same question to the MNR and this is what I received: We circulated your e-mail around to fisheries staff to see if they could be of assistance.* It was confirmed that they do appear to be leeches, but as to what species they are, samples would have to be collected so they can be identified. * Sorry we do not have any further information for you at this time. so, hopefully this reposting could result in a better resolution - any thoughts? phish"

5719602,Limeyangler,2017-08-15 17:02:00,563,Fish lice.
5719634,phishfearme,2017-08-15 17:43:00,1242,"definitely not lice and I also don't think its any of the two ricky options. they are definitely a type of leech - we've pulled them off walleye and drop some into the boat and watched them act exactly like a leech. i'm just curious if they're a native or invasive variety, should we or shouldn't we pull them off the walleye and how did they get there in the first place. I have seen walleye tails almost totally covered by them and the fish was not doing all that well. phish"
5719946,Aspencreek,2017-08-15 20:59:00,2911,"I have noticed them on some of our walleye too. Did you notice them only on the fish that were caught around weeds, or sand flats, or mud flats? That's what we seem to notice, on mid lake humps surrounded by deeper water, no ""leeches"" or ""lice""."

5720650,NARDA 1,2017-08-16 09:37:00,636,Do you usually go to Eagle earlier in the season? I have been going in late August early September for many years and don't recall seeing this. I will be looking from now on.
