5699682,Lovetofish,2017-08-03 12:20:00,458,Guess I can't go then. Which lake?
5699770,stjoeguy,2017-08-03 13:20:00,979,"Todd, I was all set to email you when the 6th guy called and committed. We'll get together one of these days. We're heading back to St. Joe, but to Eagle Island on the west end of the lake. I've never fished that area before and I'm really looking forward to it. Looks like a lot of islands and mid-lake humps. Mike Borger's videos definitely helped prime the interest but I don't have to be convinced too hard to return to St. Joe."
5699890,fldoc1,2017-08-03 14:00:00,69,I have looked at mike's videos and info on the Slate Fall trip to Lake St Joe. The cabin looked super and I can only guess that the fishing will be awesome. It will be an interesting area to explore. Our group will be going to LOW near Morson in early Sept.. I hope you will do a summary and I will be anxious to find out if you agreed with Mike and how you did. Maybe even comparing the Eagle Island area and fishing to the Winoga cabin and area of Lake St Joe. Randy from Duluth
5712978,Further North,2017-08-10 19:57:00,2008,...at some point a trip like that switches over from being a fishing trip with a drinking problem...to a drinking trip with a fishing problem.I get that everyone takes their Canadian trips for different reasons...but i can drink beer at home...
5713058,halfmoon007,2017-08-10 20:32:00,121,"Got to have 25 lbs a guy. sounds crazy but when u shop look at the weight of every thing u buy and it all adds up quick. Now enter in your cooler and carrying devices. Every year I say these turkeys are getting Oil and breading. Note the same 6 guys just flew in with a record 400# over weight. I agree with Adam just pay the overage and don,t blame it on the camp cook. If the camp cook doesn't get to bring in his 4 liters of rum in plastic pop bottles get a new cook LOL. after the last 6 years Ive learned the beer drinkers are to blame. also with today's water filtration their is no need to take bottled water. my rum mix is dry country time Arnold Palmer with filtered lake wtr. and the boys all drink the same lake water that is 99.9% beaver fever free after filtration. halfmoon"
5716258,lindyman,2017-08-13 13:57:00,7,"We just got back from Hooker lake using Slate Falls Outposts. It was 2 guys and 4 women packing for 7 days of fishing and we were 400 pounds under the weight limit. We packed steaks potatoes and really everything we needed even 60 dz salted minnows and we were under the limit, we didn't have beer or any liquor,filtered our own water.This was our first fly in and we were really impressed with Verns set up, clean cabins clean outhouse, no mice and lots of quality fish. We didn't fish hard, on the water by 9 am lunch by 1pm back on the water by 4 off the water at 8pm and we still had over 600 walleyes and 50 northerns . The group b-4 us had 1500 for the week but like I said we had only one die hard walleye guy and the rest only fish once a year"
5716466,zeebee,2017-08-13 17:44:00,1144,"Beer, water, pop should get flown in early, most do it at no charge. Trolling mtrs, bagged minnows, batteries on a fly in??????.... what next high heels and a leather whip?Hey, better yet a 10' snowman replica donned with a WWII era German helmet with Bannon kissing its orange sprayed ***"
5717890,tsquared,2017-08-14 15:28:00,57,http://www.canadianflyinfishing.com/weight-allowances/ We've used Amik before and here are their guidelines...we had beer flown up early though...
5717986,stjoeguy,2017-08-14 16:09:00,979,"Liked Amik's line in the last paragraph of the article: ""go to Cabela's or Gander Mountain (we know you've been there before)"""
5696370,stjoeguy,2017-08-01 15:11:00,979,"This September's trip will be our first fly-in. Slate Falls offers a 4% rate reduction if the total weight for 6 guys and gear is less than 2,400 pounds. It seems reasonable to me, but I have no idea how much groceries etc are going to weigh. For those with fly-in experience, what are your thoughts about how obtainable a goal that is. Easy? Next to impossible? We'll have no really big guys & no heavy beer drinkers."
5696442,bthomas3333,2017-08-01 16:10:00,465,"Hey - This would be tight for my group of 6. We have a couple of smaller guys ~180 and a couple of BIG guys 6'6"" 300+. The breakdown for us in the past ~20 or so trips.6 Guys - 1500#6 Guys Clothes and Tackle Bags 400#Food - 150#Minnows in bags - 50#Here's the killer items for us...Beer (~20# per case) / Water / Soda / Marine batteries for trolling motors - Finders / Nets.Have fun!B"
5696618,stjoeguy,2017-08-01 18:03:00,979,"Thanks for the reply. That's good information that gives me hope. I think we can save a couple hundred pounds with smaller guys, the camp boats have electric start so we can connect fish finders to the starting batteries, and we won't be bringing minnows."
5696650,adempsey2.0,2017-08-01 18:38:00,612,"It's probably quite easy to do really. A typical fly-in trip allowance is 100lbs of gear. Assume the average dude is 200lbs and you have an extra 100lbs per person to work with compared to your typical trip. Shouldn't be too hard to accomplish if you don't drink a lot of beer.Weight allowance gets eaten up fast with the liquids you bring (case of 24 bottles of water is ~25lbs, case of 24 cans of beer/pop is ~20lbs). So, don't bring too many. Get a good water filter like a Platypus, they work like a charm and you won't need to bring any water. Plan your breaky/lunch/dinner menu's accordingly as well - pick dinners that use fewer liquids and make sure one person plans/buys it all. Otherwise, you will almost certainly be over and have a ton of extra leftover food. Even so, I often plan down to the last piece of cheese, but still, it's so hard to predict what/how much people will eat and there is always leftover food. Which is always better than not enough!September can also be a bit tricky, as you may have to be prepared for 90F and 35F depending on where and when. However, to save 4%, I wouldn't lose much sleep over it. Personally, I'd spend an extra $1-2 per pound in overweight charges so I an relax more about my packing/menu."
5696866,Jig Man,2017-08-01 20:22:00,95,"Spend the money, you are vacation. less stress is worth a few bucks. A lot of times they fly in extras a few days later at no cost."
5696914,The tank,2017-08-01 20:53:00,340,4% of 1500 is only 60 bucks. Not enough to worry about.
5696954,stjoeguy,2017-08-01 21:12:00,979,"You're right. I'm not going to lose any sleep over it, but it is a challenge. They don't even charge for any weight over the 2,400 and just bring it in on the check flight. But when you combine the discount, being a retired bean counter, and the fact that I'm tired of bringing way too much on our June trips you get a goal I'm willing to work toward. Thanks for the help. I'll let you know how it works out."
5697314,law57,2017-08-02 07:16:00,1147,I know a guy who operates a fly-in camp. He had some guests who required more beer than the plane could carry - along with the normal load. He had to charter another flight - $3000 to bring in their beer. Now that's the trip I want to be on!
