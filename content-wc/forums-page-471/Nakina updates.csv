1312321,GOBIG,2011-05-29 05:19:00,126,Any nakina area updates? How is the fishing.
1312794,Jack77,2011-05-30 18:37:00,168,It seems like a few of these guys should be getting back by now. I am heading up in less than two weeks and would love to hear how things were up there.
1312822,TIGHTLINER,2011-05-30 19:43:00,223,Where are you headed up there with what outfitter and what lake?? Using awo for melchett lake this coming friday have heard nothing but good about the outfitter and the lake. Been to kag lake 4 times in the past however the outfitter is no longer in business probably would not use him again anyway.
1312860,Mike Borger,2011-05-30 21:23:00,1554,"Just back from Nakina on Sunday, my group flew into the Attawapiskat river on Friday the 20th.We caught the tail end of an extended warm front Sat and Sun and the fishing was incredible.Water temps ranged from 56-61 in the heat of the day. Sunday night a major cold front settled in and we had minus temps and snow for the next 3 days. Water temps plummeted and averaged 41-43, quite a drop.The fishing slowed considerably but we adapted and still caught plenty of trophy northerns and lots of walleye when we bothered to fish them.Top pike lure of the week for me was a white 8"" reaper rigged on a very lightly weighted swimbait hook with a small, trimmed skirt at the head pushed up over the snap of my fluoro leader.You could work it dead slow through the shallowest water with long pauses suspending the bait right in front of the pike. That triggered a lot of strikes from what were mostly inactive fish.Innumerable pike between 35-39"", 37 between 40-45"" for our entire group.Walleye we didn't bother counting.Whoever fishes that camp next with warm stable weather will have a heyday.In general everyone we talked to up there was reporting fantastic fishing. Water levels are up from last year and if the weather cooperates whoever's going will do well I'm sure.Cheers, Mike"
1312911,deputy dog,2011-05-31 06:43:00,305,"solo, headin up with eddie aug 13-20 and saw that there is a road that goes north out of geraldton into nakina. main route is north out of long lac but other road would cut off decent amount of time. have you/would you recommend taking lesser traveled route? is the road conditions good enough to take the road? good to hear water levels are up over last years just hope they remain normal through the summer. any travel tips for ur as we are headin up out of ohio through the soo? great report as always!"
1312933,tooski,2011-05-31 07:40:00,393,"DD, You might have it reversed. The main road is 584 out of Geraldton, not Longlac. Eddie recommends the shorter route out of Longlac but it involves around 20 miles of unpaved road. I think it is called Crib Rd. I have a hand drawn map of the shortcut. PM if you are interested and I will send you a copy."
1313068,Jack77,2011-05-31 13:18:00,168,I spoke with Kyle and Terri from Brace Lake and they said that the road had just recently been graded. I am planning on taking the logging road out of Nakina. I made a map by piecing together Goggle Earth screen shots.
1337771,pike50plus,2011-08-05 20:08:00,584,"I used crib back in july and other than some dust not bad at all, no traffic either. Saved 45 minutes?"
1337962,Jack77,2011-08-06 18:18:00,168,I found the same thing back in early June. The crib road is the way to go.
1337995,hoppy63,2011-08-06 20:50:00,367,"going to kap lake with awo aug. 20-27th. glad to hear crib is in good shape. anyone been to kap or to any of awo's lakes in the past couple weeks? first time up..looking forward to it. is crossing the border a hassel still, or are things smoothing out? have dui issues, would hate to be sitting at border, while buddies are tearing up fish! also is portable fishfinder recommended? any ideas for packing, food, clothes, equiptment, etc........appreciated. pm me if you wish. thanks in advance......"
