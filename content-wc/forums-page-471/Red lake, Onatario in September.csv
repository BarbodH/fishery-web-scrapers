Any tips would be great. How are the post narrows and other areas this time of year. I had a great time up there in May and would love to get back. Thanks! Marc"

They have the big Red Lake Fall Classic on Labor day every year, the cutoff is 150 boats total and they have a waiting list of people wanting to get in and fish.Sorry I cant help you with any other information on fall fishing on red lake as I fish just south of you at Gull Rock and will be there 2nd weekend n September and fishing is usually outstanding!"

Chartreuse, yellow or green and the brighter the better for colors.Have fun.Al"
