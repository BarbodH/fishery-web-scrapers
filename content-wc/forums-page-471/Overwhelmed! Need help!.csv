1337090,fishforlife,2011-08-03 21:01:00,77,"I can tell you that if you are looking for great fishing and nice cabins and very nice hosts, You can't beat Brace Lake outfitters out of Nakina, on with Kyle & Teri Polesky. I take a group of 8 there each year, and our whole group agrees that we have found a treasure for all of the above reasons. They also have the best fly-in price around. We do the housekeeping trip, but they do offer the American Plan. If you need any more information, you can PM me and I'll help all I can. are group of 8 will fly in on 8-19-11 can't wait. Check it out. How old is your father, and how much is he limited in doing? 220 miles of shoreline to explore between 3 lakes. 18' ceder boats with 15 hp Merc. Log cabins with running water showers toilets stove and fridge. Deck with fire pit right on the lake. We go in late Aug. no bugs and fishing is still good. Largest Walley 27"" Largest pike was 44' plenty of others. This place is heaven to us fisherman from lake Erie area. Best of luck wherever you decide."

1330008,unclepaully,2011-07-14 19:29:00,112,"Well here is the deal. I have just been given the greenlight by my wife (no comments...you have to get the ok too) to start planning my next Ontario adventure. The problem is I've been planning it for the last 2 months and can't decide where to go. Our group will be small, most likely 3 of us. Last year we went up to the Attawapiskat but this time we are looking for something a little different. My dad is getting up there in age and he needs a place that is more than just a hardcore fishing camp. Once in a while he sits the day out and a (clean) comfortable inside and outside space is important. i.e. screened deck, couch, recliner, deck with a view, fire pit... that sort of stuff. I guess the other criteria would be: price: under $1400 per person Allows smaller groupsOnly cabin on the lakeLocation: anywhere in n. ontario, or northeast manitoba Fishing: would like lots of numbers of walleye(at least 30-40 per day with a good day being much more) along with a shot at a decent pike. Also a lake with some some character(waterfalls, cliffs...) wouldn't hurt. Here are some outfitters that I am considering right now. 1. Showalters 2. Thousand Lake Outposts (stonehouse lake) 3. Northern Outposts 4. Viking Oupost 5. Big Hook Wilderness Camps 5. Mattice Lake OutfittersBased on all of the criteria what outfitter and lake would you recommend. Your input will be very much appreciated as I will use it as a major basis for our trip destination.Thank guys!"
1330017,wallydave,2011-07-14 19:47:00,2151,Check out the 2012 fly-in for 2 thread! Lots of info there! www.canadafever.comThis site has plenty of info too!
1330035,filetnfish,2011-07-14 20:38:00,4,howey bay resort at red lake is a very relaxing camp. we've had some days on redlake where 2 guys can boat upwards of 200 walleye
1330042,Mr Walleye,2011-07-14 21:07:00,29,"Northern Outposts is awesome fishing! Camps are basic, but very comfortable. Ryan and Kathy Brady are awesome hosts. Mattice Lake Outfitters are also very good, but I'm not sure the fishing is as good. Hope this helps!"
1330099,jambi,2011-07-15 06:02:00,504,I've used Showalters twice; both times to a lake with trout & pike only. Great camp and fishing. Headed up to fish their Irwin Lake outpost in late August. Great outfitter I'm sure he has one to fit your needs.
1330131,fishnutbob,2011-07-15 08:06:00,633,Ive used Showalters alot Flying me into my remote cabin. Ed runs great camps you cant go wrong with their outposts.
1330251,new hips,2011-07-15 14:27:00,498,"I will be fishing Showalters this August 19, Apps& Meddick,I give you a report if you choose them. We have fished Big Hook 3 times South, Central, great lakes and a ton of fish, no complaints."
1330300,unclepaully,2011-07-15 17:32:00,112,new hips what were the cabins like with big hook? What made you decide to switch outfitters???
1330322,new hips,2011-07-15 18:53:00,498,"Our last visit was probably 10 years ago, cabins were basic, I'm sure they have made improvements since. Fishing was fantastic, also at that time they had 6hp motors, so you never ventured to far. We started fishing Lac Seul, mainly because of cost of fly- in."
1337065,Walleye Wanderer,2011-08-03 19:50:00,101,Remi runs a great operation with nice clean camps and great fishing out of Nakina.http://www.awonakina.com/
