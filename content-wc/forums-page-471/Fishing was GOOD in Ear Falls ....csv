Of course, don't be stupid like this guy. Stay legal where ever you go. Not only was this the wrong thing to do, it's not worth paying $128 per fish when caught. An Ear Falls man ""has been ordered to pay $6,000 for having too many fish in his possession. Conservation officers received complaints ... about an angler who fished in the same spot below the Ear Falls Hydro Dam several times a day over the course of a week. Officers investigated and found that [the guy] had 31 walleye and 16 northern pike at his home. He was only licensed to possess 4 walleye and 4 northern pike."" Jeez. Kudos to the MNR for finding and busting the dude!!! -- Luv2Jig"
