1337811,MorganMan,2011-08-06 06:34:00,341,Just keeping this thread near the front. Someone has to be getting back??
1337989,rather-be-fishin,2011-08-06 20:27:00,429,"Got back today from NW area of Lac Seul and we had another AWESOME trip....Last Sunday two of the ""newbies"" on our trip had the HOT boat and they caught: WALLEYES 26"", 27 1/2"", 28"" & 31 1/2"" TROPHY Walleye all in the same spot in a 3 hour span, between 5-8pm. UNBELIEVABLE!!! My goal has been to catch a 30"" Walleye all my life!!! Proud to say I was able to witness it. The the next day, they caught a 41"" Northern.....beginners luck is what I say! It was a trip of a lifetime for them & me too!!! The rest of our group caught MANY 24-26"" FAT walleyes that really put up good fights. Jigs were the best lure...chartreuse, pink, parrott, white, purple. If the jig bite slowed down....spinners worked well: pink, chartreuse & Tommy Harris Spider spinners. Depths that produced the best 15 - 25 ft. Used minnows the most, but also got some on crawlers. Our weather was HOT upper 80's most of the days. Winds 6-9 mphs, NW - SW. One Storm blew threw on Thursday....had to take refuge on sandy beach on an island, then cleared with blue skys and continued fishing. Mostly trolled or drifted island points in Bay of Islands and McKenzie bay & also fished South Inlet. Tried South Bay, but bite was slow there yesterday, which was a calm day in that bay. Water is LOW 3-4 feet and some of the reefs in McKenzie Bay are TOTALLY out of the water, which I have never seen in many years. Once again, Lac Seul lived up to our hopes and expectations and we had an ABSOLUTE BLAST!!! Already looking forward to next year! Rather-be-fishin....again on Lac Seul"
1337991,rather-be-fishin,2011-08-06 20:38:00,429,"Another thing, there are many forest fires burning up in the area around Lac Seul, several new ones started today from lighting strikes.....smokey haze was the worse with NW winds..."
1338124,lcwhit,2011-08-07 13:44:00,104,"the water is low, but i believe its only about 18"" maybe 2' from normal levels. i've seen it a whole lot lower this time of year."
1333285,rather-be-fishin,2011-07-24 08:26:00,429,"Looking for current fishing reports for Lac Seul. Our group of 8 is heading up there on 7/30. Taking 4 newbies with & want them to have a fantastic time catching those nice Lac Seul walleyes! Busy getting ready to go! Excitement is building! Would appreciate any reports/tips/water levels in the McKenzie, Bay of Islands, Manitou Narrows, South Bay/Inlet area! Thanks! RBF"
1333486,Steve of Madison,2011-07-24 20:48:00,230,"Had a great time fishing LS last week out of Onaway Lodge. Blair and Kathy do a great job and run a top notch camp.WATER LEVELS are a bit down from last year 16-24"". The whale backs are sticking out everywhere, some are really close to normal travel routes so be careful.Weedlines are defined and close to the surface.Water temp started at 68 on friday and by the middle of the week the readings at the surface were 76 to 78. It was really hot early in the week and warmed the water rapidly.There was a fire near Sawmill and the smoke on monday drove us off the lake until later in the day. We literaly were in a bubble where we couldn't see any other islands or landmarks, good thing for GPS.We caught fish along weedlines and main lake humps and soft bottom reefs.When we found fish they were hungry and colors didn't mater.Also........we SAW our first BIG Tiger musky ( it tried to steal a walleye from my son's jig) I have no idea how big it was but, the back that came out of the water was a good 4' long and no head or tail in sight, the first time it went after it. The second time all I saw was a mouth that was a good 10"" wide, it missed the walleye but caught my attention. If that monster was on the end of my line we were going to need a bigger boat (yes, that's a JAWS quote). That is the first time I have heard of Musky in this area (Bay of Islands, Scout bay).Overall a great trip....again!"
1333668,PARAJOHN,2011-07-25 11:59:00,15,"Steve, thanks for the post. We are also heading up to LS on the 30th in the same area and appriciate the info."
1334643,scgibby11,2011-07-27 20:01:00,109,"We were on Lac Seul last week too, the last few days of the incredible heat, then a couple normal days.We found the bite to still be quite good. 18-24 feet was the ticket off of about any reef or island and sometimes on the midlake humps.On the really windy days we tried forward trolling boards with success and drifting spinners with success.Our best was a 29in walleye on a minnow jig. Colors didn't matter a bit for us."
1334704,rather-be-fishin,2011-07-28 00:22:00,429,"Scgibby11 ~ Thanks for the update! I was just wondering tonight if you were back yet and how your trip went? What area of the lake did you end up fishing? Were the maps helpful? What baits worked best? WOW a 29"" walleye that's AWESOME! Do you plan on going back? Just finishing up packing tomorrow and then the rest of our group are arriving at my house to spend the night Friday and then on the road early Saturday morning. Can't wait! RBF"
1334705,rather-be-fishin,2011-07-28 00:23:00,429,Parajohn ~ Where are you staying on Lac Seul? Have a great trip! RBF
1334830,PARAJOHN,2011-07-28 08:46:00,15,"RBF,We are staying at Golden Eagle in Ear Falls. We found out a local guy owns it so we thought we would give it a shot. It is our first trip to this side of LS and we are bringing our families with us. I see you are from my neck of the woods, but I won't hold that against you. Go Bluejackets!!"
1334878,scgibby11,2011-07-28 10:35:00,109,"Rather-be-fishingI'll bump you with a PM too, but thanks very much for your maps and advice for the Ear Falls area of Lac Seul.To answer some of your questions:1. Best baits were chartreuse/yellow jigs with minnows, but colors were not real critical for us.2. Best area: We enjoyed Steamboat bay the most for its location and scenery as well as the fishing. We did real well right around the narrows itself. Many other spots too.3. We will definitely go back. It was way too much fun!Scott"
1334922,rather-be-fishin,2011-07-28 12:03:00,429,"Parajohn ~ we have stayed at Golden Eagle years ago & Scott & Alma treated us very well! Scott does a great job of guiding & has a great sense of humor! Since your almost my ""neighbor"", I have a map of some good fishing spots in that area if your interested I could email you it. Shoot me your email address. Anything to help out another ""Ranger""! Oh yeah, Blue Devils RULE!!! LOL RBF"
