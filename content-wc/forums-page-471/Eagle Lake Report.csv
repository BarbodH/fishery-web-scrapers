1331137,JIGSTER,2011-07-18 12:47:00,30,"Heading up to Eagle this Friday for the first time. Taking son and wife for there first Canada trips. Looking for any current reports on patterns,baits, presentations, ect. Not looking for anybodys hot spots just some starting information. If anybody does want to share a location or two with a private mail it would be greatly appreciated though! I know a guide is recommended to get started, but this already a max budget trip and gas keeps going up!! We will be in the Vermilion Bay area. Thanks for any assistance. Come on Friday!!"
1331145,greg2648,2011-07-18 13:04:00,80,"I cant help you much with the fishing. But, we just came home through there and there were alot of critters on the road. We saw moose on 17 and bears on 502. That was on the blacktop. Please be cautious. Greg."
1331146,v-bay gord,2011-07-18 13:07:00,3168,Had some folks run down to the Viking Reef / Net Island area and do well on the mid lake humps....20ft or so....on bottom bouncers and spinners...either crawlers or leeches. There is still a shallower bite going on ...12-15'......jigs/minnows/crawlers or trolling crankbaits all seem to work. Very warm and the bite may be moving to early morning hours. Bring some good bug spray...the ankle biting flies are pesky when the humidity goes up. Have fun!
1331426,JIGSTER,2011-07-19 05:53:00,30,Thanks for the replies fellas! 4 days to go!!!!!
1331510,NARDA 1,2011-07-19 09:06:00,636,Make sure you leave a few fish in the lake for me........ I've got 50 days to go!!!!!
1331571,Danbear,2011-07-19 11:02:00,72,"I am by no means an expert on Eagle but after 3 trips there I have had some luck, I use mainly a lindy rig with a minnow. Here is where I would try. 1. North end of Round island 15-20 FOW. 2. South end of Round Island you will have to feel for the cabbage beds fish at end of the cabbage or right over it with a slip bobber.3. The bay at Snow shoe point lots of active Northerns in the weeds.4. The rock reef at the entrance to Clearwater creek watch closely because it is not marked fish north side and east side for wallyes, south side in the weeds for northerns always get some nice eater size northerns here. 5. The narrows east of Trout hole #1 it's GPS spot 33 on the map, if you have a west wind drift through the narrows or back troll try right down the center 1st, then south and north side till you find active fish.6. A friend from work just got back 2 weeks ago and said he did well off McCalls Island in Vermillion Bay.Hope this helps, let me know if you did any good I have to wait 51 days till we leave. Good Luck !"
1331637,stevie,2011-07-19 14:36:00,21,"1. fishing report 7/2-7/16 water temps are now approaching mid/high 70's surface,going over 80 by days end with 1 degree change every 5-10' down to 20' thermocline setting up around 25-28'. projected hot,relativley flat, sunny weather for the week with temps avg.g mid 80's to mid/high 90's so undoubtably water temps will rise some. last report 6/26 i stated mayfly hatch was/had been sporatic,light,hadn't really affected fishing much,and it looked like it was pretty much done and over. i was wrong. it started again /continued at weeks end into mid week of 7/2 week not so much as surface hatches but a thick 4-8' larve bug line at 12'-15' and fish were gorging on them. walleyes left alot of the deeper humps that had been so good for several weeks and the bite was best on weed edges,thick cabbage, and on tops of shallower bars 12-15'. still plenty of fish caught but guides who were avg.g 70-120 fish per day had to scoot around more to figure things out and find pockets of active fish that spooked easily and catches avg.g 30-50. crawlers and leeches on stand up jigs were as good or better than minnows. muskys were also affected because everything they eat was up high,fat,lazy,burping and farting,easy to catch,and it appeared most feeding was being done at night during hatches.day time saw lots of big ,lazy follows and those hitting were nipping and slapping resulting in many missed fish.guides were reporting days of 10-25 follows with 2-5 hits boating 1-2 high 30/mid-high 40"" fish and the bigger fish on and off or missing baits. by thurs- fri and going into and through 7/9 it ended,things came around quickly and everything was back to normal by mon-tues of the week. walleye catches sky rocketed. they moved back or became very active again on the humps and reefs 17-25' going shallower to the tops of shallower humps and very aggressive feeding as the water temps rose through the week but there was still a good big fish bite going in the cabbage on weedless jigs and leeches.the wolf group boated over 800 walleyes in 4 days,the winslow group of 12 ate fish twice daily took thier limits home and boated a bunch of fish 25-30.5"". doc rick also boated a 30"" fish.all groups that were guided or started the week out with guides and got patterns/presentations figured out had an excellent week and caught alot of fish of all sizes. keep it simple 1/8-1/4 oz jigs and rigs is all you need on the humps and in the weeds.the basin pm trolling bite was given a try late last week and it is happening over 50-80' 8-18' down on crankbaits and with this type of weather will get better and better with ciso rises to the surface 7-10;oopm. most all big pike came fishing walleyes on bigger chubs and small suckers as the bigger fish have gone to the basin and deeper water for the most part with the occasional wanderer up shallow. muskys also responded positivley and were much more agressive with some good catches. gary holburg boated 50 and 49's,jeremy 51.5,49.5,46,44,frank 50.5,dave 47,tony 49,44,and a bunch of low-mid 40's with every group having shots at big fish but still alot of on and offs or boatside hits that didn't stick but definatly a step in the right direction,both weeds and rocks but as water temps rise and more sun typically weeds become a dominate pattern. with projected sun,heat,and low winds and rising water temps give early and late alot of attention. blades,topwaters,and jerk baits been moving most fish. with surface temps where they are we will be encouraging/recomending no fishing lake trout on eagle till water temps drop again as releasing big trout over 10-12 # and especially the jumbos 18-25# will be very difficult and a high % potential mortality. if you're going to fish lakers go to clearwater,buzzard or one of the other nearby numbers trout lakes where eating size fish are the norm.look at 65-70' depths.trolling spoons,minnowbaits,cowbells with a sucker or cisco,and jigging spoons or jigs with sucker meat. bass are scattered around on rocky points,broken rock shorelines with timber in thick reeds that are intermixed with cabbage though the holburg group spent a day with danny and tore em' up avg 15-19"" on leeches. i'll get a bunch of new pics up on the board shortly so stay tuned. steve AML"

1332228,Limeyangler,2011-07-20 21:55:00,563,"Hey Jigster, i have not been to Eagle in a couple of weeks, but the bite was still relatively shallow at the south east end i fish.I have been to a couple of other lakes in the past week and the walleyes have definitely been concentrated in the cabbage.I'm no expert but would say the extremely hot weather has them hunkered down in the weeds. The weather is due to be scorching and humid with storms, i'd try to find weeds and maybe a deeper bite on mid water reefs ( i was up at Lac seul the other day and the big girls have definitely arrived at their summer deep spots)Her's a video of the weed bite on Wabigoon at the moment....just a thoughthttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWwc1ZXK-sE"
1336345,Danbear,2011-08-01 20:09:00,72,"JigsterDid you try any of my spots ?If you did I am suprised you didn't catch a northern.Overall though sounds like you had a successful trip.20-30 walleyes a day in my book is a pretty good day.I have never found the bigger perch, I think they are easier to findearlier in the year. Usually we catch northerns mixed in with the walleyes when we fish with minnows. But a Black and Silver Rapala X-Rap fished off the reeds and weeds always nets us a few northerns, also had some good luck on a 5-6 inch swim bait. Well now you can start planning for next year. My gang leaves in 39 days, can't wait.RegardsDanBear"
1336749,JIGSTER,2011-08-02 21:02:00,30,"Danbear I did try all of your spots except for the narrows in the west arm. Tried both spots for northerns and tried walleyes around Round island two different times with no action. I was also suprised we didn't run into any northerns while walleye fishing. We didn't have much luck on walleyes with minnows, used mostly crawlers, so that could've been the reason? Any how a good experience!! Time to start planning for next year!"
1336335,JIGSTER,2011-08-01 19:34:00,30,"Had a good week, took a couple days to get on fish after the heat and a big cold front the day before we arrived. Found fish around submerged reefs in Portage Bay. Mostly hanging at 30ft. on the reef and suspended same depth off. Mostly crawlers and some on leeches. My son and I fished 3-4 hours in the morn. and about 3 hours at night. We usually caught 20-30 fish per day. Not sure how that compares to other peoples experiences? Would be interested in some responses. several fish a day in the 22-23 inch range with lots of 14-16 inch eaters. biggest was 26 1/2 inches. Lots of small perch in bays, nothing over 9 inches. Is there many larger perch in the lake? Only dissapointment was northerns, spent many hours casting bays 2ft - 10ft with all of the usual northern stuff and couldn't catch a fish! Evidently not looking in the right spots?? I always thought find weeds find northerns, wasnt the case. Tries reeds and cabbage. All in all a good week, jury is still out if we will go back or try something different. Scenery was fantastic but there was more than expected traffic on the lake. Thanks for all that replied with advice and good luck to all that are still preparing for trips this year!!Also no problems at all at the border, 15 min. wait going in sat. around noon and 30 min wait coming home around 10."
