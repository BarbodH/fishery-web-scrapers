1335832,cuamb,2011-07-31 11:48:00,203,I don't think Lakemaster has a chip for Lac Seul.
1336838,cuamb,2011-08-03 08:56:00,203,Any new fishing reports for the area. Be there a week from today.
1337903,rook-eye slayer,2011-08-06 13:31:00,42,"lake master doesn't have a chip for lac seul - wish they did though. be smart about your boat, trust your electronics, but know that they ARE NOT perfect.there are a bunch of marker bouys that were WAY off - like scary difference off.look for ""shoals"" on the navionics chip - get up wind and start rippin lips!!!"
1333973,tsquared,2011-07-26 07:20:00,57,"Headed to Banana island/taylor island on the 5th. Have done a few fly ins, but first time to Lac Seul. Anybody fish the area recently or have any advice for Pike and Walleye."
1333996,gowrlop,2011-07-26 08:11:00,109,Two weeks ago walleyes were in the 15 to 22 ft range on all traditional locations. Windward ponits and islands will hold fish in those areas. Water is low watch out for the mindfields.
1334719,Iowa Hawkeye,2011-07-28 05:07:00,90,"T-squared where are you staying, lots of good fishing just north of Taylor. Small mouths are great in that area also. Good Luck"
1334772,Skywagon,2011-07-28 07:18:00,1106,"I was up that way two weeks ago Friday, lot of houseboats heading back in. Fishing is good in that area, lots of structure everywhere, play the wind. Hard to generalize on depth. You will catch fish, unlike the fly-in lakes, you may need to put bait on your hook."
1334813,tsquared,2011-07-28 08:00:00,57,Iowa hawkeye - we are doing the houseboat routine and told them we wanted to stay between Banana and Taylor. Glad to hear about the smallies as one of our buddies was REALLY pushing to do something this year where he could do some smallie fishing. Do you need to go all the way to bear narrows or are you referencing the area below. We are 8 days away (not that I am counting)! Thanks for the reply.
1334998,car19fan,2011-07-28 14:40:00,1,Some of the guys in our group have been going to LS for over 40 years and have come to the conclusion this is the best multi species area of the lake. The past 2 years we've had great luck jigging for walleyes just south of Taylor all along the rocky face of the first island. A few of the guys like to cast for pike and have good luck Just north of Taylor. This will be the 3rd year in a row for the houseboat from Hudson to Taylor. We head up usually the first week of Sept but going late Aug this year. I've seen reports of the lake level being down and wondering if the houseboats are able to take the shortcut through the rags?
1335287,cuamb,2011-07-29 10:04:00,203,We were up in early June and made it through the rags on the way back. Glad to hear the fishing is good by Taylor Island. We are headed up there in a week. Usually go up to the Chamberlain Narrows/Scalar area but not going to go as far this time. This will be my 17th time up and the first I've fished south of Bear Narrows.
1335349,Guest,2011-07-29 12:09:00,0,"Tsquare, we have a crew taking off on the 5th with a houseboat also. We have made the trip for about 10 years now. everything looks like it should be a grest week. see you there."
1335743,rook-eye slayer,2011-07-30 22:54:00,42,"we were up and parked the houseboat on Taylor Island july 9-15. Fishing was great.When the wind is fro mthe NW, there is a great rock shaol that comes out just at the entrance to bear narrows - threw muskie baits and pulled in some nice eyes and northerns.just northwest of the entrance to bear narrows there is a green buoy - gets shallowed up in a hurry so watch out - but we nailed them every day there consistently in the 19-26"" range. If you've got a navionics chip, it's the buoy that is marked incorrectly - when your GPS tells you that you should be driving over the buoy - look east and you'll see where i'm talking about.Good luck and have fun, i know that I did. we're already planning next years!!!"
1335813,tsquared,2011-07-31 10:49:00,57,Thanks for the reply. Need to get going so I can quit buying tackle every day. Is the Navionics chip superior to lakemaster?
