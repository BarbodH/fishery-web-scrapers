If there is any sense or logic in this I am not smart enough to figure out what it is. So I am going to good old Canada instead. It may be socialist, it may be expensive, but its still great. ."
1337247,v-bay gord,2011-08-04 10:32:00,3168,"I don't want to divert the original topic but I am sure you already contribute to ""what is best"" for your own community......ie roads, parks, schools etc.... A majority makes a decision and follows through. There will always be dissent and disagreement...no different in any system. You need to move from just considering yourself a ""taxpayer' to thinking that you are a ""citizen""......with the rights and responsibilities that go along with that. Corruption? If it only happens in socialist systems, then what happened to the U.S. banking community? No corrupt politicians in the capitalist versions? By the way, I don't view Canada as a socialist system......we may just be able to have a greater ""community view"" as opposed to the U.S. which might have more of an ""individual view"". .....and sure, we could swap tales and beers anyday!"
1337251,HeHooksHimself,2011-08-04 10:50:00,725,"I'll go with the beer, then we can include religion in the discussion as well! Just kidding, i would rather talk about fishing and we both have a passion for Canadian fishing!"
1337294,v-bay gord,2011-08-04 12:38:00,3168,.......beer it is!
1337300,wallydave,2011-08-04 12:48:00,2151,"If the taxes I pay while I am in Canada, keep the roads to our favorite lakes in good repair, and keep quality fishing, both size and numbers available for my jigs and lures, I'm ok with that! Yea, I could drink a beer with you all and we'll swap good fishing tails!!"
1337302,jignminow,2011-08-04 12:54:00,168,The Holocast snip is WAY FUNNY!!!!!
1337305,jignminow,2011-08-04 12:57:00,168,Only if you are taking it back with you. I don't buy my booze and food in Canada and have any plans to try to bring them back.
1337353,Bill Krejca,2011-08-04 14:56:00,6107,"Wow, never in my wildest dreams would I ever have guessed that my innocent question about what form to use and where to get it would spark all the controversy and multiple thread subject content! I will admit, though, that it has been very entertaining to sit back and digest. Now about world peace and global warming.............. Bill Krejca"
1335527,v-bay gord,2011-07-29 22:42:00,3168,"The only b.s. is your attitude Jinx. Too bad you are the ""welcoming committee"" at the border. You might consider the fact that tourism is an industry that employs people and contributes heavily to local economies......especially in small towns. The rebate is a smart move on the part of the government."
1335640,JinxCanada,2011-07-30 13:54:00,1306,"ya, and THEN I have to pay the 13% at the border on everything I buy on top of that. awesome deal!"
1335785,Guest,2011-07-31 08:45:00,0,"Jinx always wants it both ways. He is always so proud of the laws when they keep out those darn drunks yet if the laws affect him, well there must be something wrong with them Do the right thing, Jinx. Support your government consisitently. You might build some credibility then."
1335795,Weby13,2011-07-31 09:37:00,57,Have Americans stay in the States and Canadians stay in Canada and see whos country will suffer more!!!!!
1335809,v-bay gord,2011-07-31 10:39:00,3168,"With the number of Canadians buying properties in the U.S., winter vacationing, and cross border shopping, I wouldn't be so quick with your assumptions."
1335882,phishfearme,2011-07-31 14:35:00,1242,"v-bay - i agree, it USED to be that way (canada need US income more than the other way around) but will probably be the opposite in the future. canda's huge amount natural resouces will make your dollar strong for the for-seeable future - regardless of how ""socialistic"" one may view your laws. phish"
1336973,downriverbob,2011-08-03 15:30:00,880,"Jinx, I guess I don't understand why then I still see alot of Ontario license plates still in Sam's Club and other shopping areas in Michigan. BOB"
1336999,v-bay gord,2011-08-03 17:16:00,3168,"Agreed phish......and it is not so much that the ""country"" needs the income, but the small regions and communities on both sides of the line, that rely on people crossing the border. That's why some attitudes (Jinx perhaps?) irritate me so much. As far as ""socialistic"", perhaps it is time that people started thinking what is best for the whole community / country, rather than what is best for the individual. If that is being a socialist....then sign me up. Might be one reason why the Canadian debt is under much better management. Never mind the medicare system............bonus points for that (IMO)."
1337188,LOW1,2011-08-04 08:40:00,2828,"The weak US dollar makes it tougher to vacation in Canada but it sure is helping exporters to Canada, including farmers here in Iowa. The US and Canada are tremendous trade partners."
1337199,HeHooksHimself,2011-08-04 09:11:00,725,"The problem arises there. What if I think ""what's best"" for the community is different than what you think is best? Does that give you the right to take what is mine and distribute it to your cause? Corruption is why socialism fails every time it is tried. Haven't you ever read ""Animal Farm""? But hey, we could drink a beer and spend all day in the boat together!"
1334563,Bill Krejca,2011-07-27 15:12:00,6107,"Who knows whether the refund is in effect this year, and if so, what form is appropriate for US residents? I tried on line, then phone call, gal said she knows nothing, gave me HST phone no., put on 15 minute hold, gave up. Any help out there? Thanks, Bill Krejca"
1334566,lund rebel,2011-07-27 15:22:00,138,"We got our form from the resort we stayed at Harris hill resort, it takes about 2 months to get the check. so maybe your resort will have them."
1334577,Bill Krejca,2011-07-27 16:25:00,6107,"Lund, Thanks, I just got back. At least it appears the rebate is still in effect, the gal at the tax bureau didn't think it was real. Perhaps I can find my old data if no one knows which form to use, if I can find it. I'll post if it turns up. Bill"
1334699,JayM5209,2011-07-27 22:36:00,1050,"Bill, I think this is what you are looking for -http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/gf/gst115/gst115-08e.pdfThe information sheet on the rebate for tour packages is here -http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/gi/gi-032/gi-032-e.html"
1334764,tv4fish,2011-07-28 07:09:00,2694,"FWIW: The people at the Duty free shop in Fort Frances don't really know or care about the rebate form - we went through the same scenario - the truth IS that yes, if your resort gave you a proper receipt and you had the right ""services"" provided, you can get 1/2 of your HST tax back. It DOES take a while."
1334814,Bill Krejca,2011-07-28 08:08:00,6107,"Thanks, Jay and TV, the lady I was referring to worked for the tax service of Ontario. I was rather surprised that no one apparently ever asked her that question before, I just dialed the no. on their tax web site. So it goes. Yeah, as I remember it took about 2 months last year to get the refund. Thanks again, guys! Bill"
1335374,JinxCanada,2011-07-29 13:18:00,1306,"it's such BS that you guys get your taxes back. why the **** should you? we pay our taxes, and when I go to the USA I certainly don't get anything back. it's total BS. Want to come to our country? you should pay your share like the rest of us. just my .02 and you should HAVE to get a boaters licence the same as all of us Canadian residents."
1335393,HeHooksHimself,2011-07-29 14:03:00,725,"Jinx, maybe your rant should be directed at your confiscatory government. You Canucks have chosen a cradle to grave government intervention. Your economy depends on us from the USA and in these tough times many of us are having to tone it down. Your government recognizes that and realizes that they will lose incrementally more fishermen without some type of rebate. Take heart, however, with the current group in charge in the USA, we will soon turn into Canada or the typical socialist European country soon and we will probably solve the border issues like Europe has and have a common currency and government system soon. By the way this does not in any way relate to the holocaust.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...cons/icon7.gif"
1335403,Bill Krejca,2011-07-29 14:27:00,6107,I guess I just look at the refund as a good business decision to generate more tourist trade. I'm not mad at any one. Bill Krejca
1335479,downriverbob,2011-07-29 18:29:00,880,"Jinx, When you come to Michigan you only pay 6 percent sales tax compared with Ontario's 13 percent and there is no sales tax on food. Maybe why there is some many Canadians shopping in the states Eh ! BOB"
