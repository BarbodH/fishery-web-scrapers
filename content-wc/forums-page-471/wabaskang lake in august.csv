We did allright but i want to give it a try in august. i usually fish lac suel just across 105 in august but wanting to fish a smaller lake and a bit cheaper place than lac suel. any help would be appreciated. Ive fished lac seul in august for 25 years and english river for about that long so just looking for a change. thank for any help.

I'm not much of a help.I don't think there is a bad time of the year to fish the lake, but because of weather, any given week can turn out less than stellar. It is generally an easy lake to fish. My understanding of August is that you need to generally go deeper than in July, and that fishing is generally a bit slower, but probably more stable (no major bug hatches)."

There are a lot of walleye in the lake so don't get frustrated if you can't find them the first day. Fish the 3rd narrows in the evening for plenty of fish to eat. Some people call it the hotel because they check in every night guaranteed!"
