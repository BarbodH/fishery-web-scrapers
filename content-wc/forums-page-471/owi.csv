I had a friend go through it about 15 years ago, for opening his big mouth and offering them the info., all they wanted was his money, it cost him back then about $180 non refundable. If they were strict on the rule about 75% or more of U.S. fisherman wouldn't be able to go into Canada. They don't do a complete check of all records and unless you have a very serious criminal record with U.S. felony's will anything show up for them. DUI just does not show up or I know a lot of people would not have gotten in., If you want to go through all the red tape it takes about 6 months worth of paper work. Or, just try it, and if they don't like the way you look and do anything at the border it will cost you about $200 to get in on site."
1336127,Mark R,2011-08-01 10:26:00,1538,"I disagree you are IN Canada when you cross the broder. How long you stay in Canada depends alot on the Customs Officer. I'm just sayin what they told two guys in my group last year, "" get the paper work done or don't come back""."
1336137,BigJim&TheTwins,2011-08-01 10:51:00,12,**** Canada!!!!!!
1336227,Guss,2011-08-01 15:04:00,27,"As stated earlier this post also is bad advice. The sticky has current info pertaining to DUI's, when they scan your passport your FBI record shows up, if you have been convicted of a DUI it will be in front of them. It is then when they may start asking questions, answer them to the best of your knowledge. Lying about it will only cause you trouble. Each officer handles the questioning differently, no given routine. Just remember one thing, even if the officer does not check you out on the DUI, that does not mean that if a OPP stops you for a traffic violation he will see it the same way, a DUI is considered a felony in Canada.."
1336229,ftfarms,2011-08-01 15:07:00,444,Eriksat1 thats not true because it shows up on your pass port if thay run it. We were detained for over 35 mints in may because i was arrested for a dui in 2008 and found not guilty the officer run it several times to make sure it was a non conviction as he said. Every ticket i had in my life showed up on it even if i got court supervision for it. There is no hiding anything; if thay run your passports it will show up.
1336846,Fish For Fun,2011-08-03 09:36:00,775,"Best advice yet, stay in the US and spend our $$ here. For what it costs to go to Canada I can do 2 or 3 trips here in the US. Every years we go to SD or ND for a week and have a blast. Everything is much cheaper than in Canada and closer."
1335580,ciracoggon,2011-07-30 08:55:00,11,anyone else have problems getting inti canada because of an owi?
1335601,S.Larson,2011-07-30 11:09:00,2408,"Everybody from the USA will have problems getting into Canada with a OWI on their record,.........."
1335605,v-bay gord,2011-07-30 11:15:00,3168,"Check the ""sticky"" at the top of the Canada forum for info on DUI's......."
1335620,ciracoggon,2011-07-30 12:32:00,11,i dont understand it i had to pay 200 cash for temperary residents 2 years ago to get in and this year i didnt even try because they flat out told me over the phone they wouldnt let me in without the proper paper work wich i cant access because my records were flooded in the cedar rapids IA flood of 08......
1335650,Guest,2011-07-30 14:42:00,0,Ddi you use an attorney for your OWI? If so they should have records. Did you check the courthouse?
1335849,ciracoggon,2011-07-31 12:39:00,11,are court house was flooded in 08 and they still havent recovered all of the records......
1335897,JAY221,2011-07-31 15:24:00,877,"I don't know what ""proper paper work "" you are needing but records of charges/convictions are available on the State of Iowa Court system for all the world to see unless it is something sealed by the courts. Again all the OWI stuff is at the top under a sticky. Later, Jay"
1336073,eriksat1,2011-08-01 07:37:00,6029,"The article in the sticky is a old article. In recent years I don't know of anyone who has had a problem crossing by car. They don't ask the question about DUI anymore, it's pretty much ""don't ask don't tell"". I think Canadian resort owners were losing too much business. Show them your passport and keep your mouth shut you shouldn't have any problem."
1336077,Mark R,2011-08-01 07:48:00,1538,In this case I think that is bad advice. He has already been identified has having a prior owi and paid the $220.00 fee. I think once they run his name or Passport he will be identified and if he doesn't have proper paperwork he could be in more trouble then just being turned around and sent back.
1336086,peter8,2011-08-01 08:28:00,1177,"Maybe think about going somewhere in the good old USA. I did that over 12 years ago when I was questioned about how much gas I was bringing into their country ( said 12 gallons was max) and just got sick of the over all rude attitudes of people until it came time to ask for your $$. My group has fished Mn,SD,ND,MI,Wi, and looking forward to fishing Erie someday. We don't miss going north of the border at all. As an example the 2 of us in my boat caught over 70 walleyes our last day on Oahe this year,Over a dozen fish 24"" or better on Devils Lake in the 5 days fishing there etc. The trip is what you make it and some days you also have trouble catching anything. But I still enjoy myself and feel better about spending my $$ in my own country."
