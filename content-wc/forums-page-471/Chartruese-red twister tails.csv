I like to use them both in Canada and in Kansas. I bought a 100 a couple of years ago but Im just about out. Those canada rocks seem to eat them. Any way I have looked and looked and I have not been able to find any. Im in hopes that someone here might now of some place that I can get some. Thanks"
1336651,jazzman,2011-08-02 15:35:00,13,"I think you might be talking about a product called "" Munchies."" (chartruse body with red or pink tail) They were distributed by Lindy/Little Joe. I think they may be hard to get or discontinued. I too have used them effectively in Canada. Maybe others can help more."
1336665,oleJoe,2011-08-02 16:27:00,114,You might try chartruese and a red dye pen. Would be a lot of work.
1336763,bfish,2011-08-02 22:00:00,1096,"Red dip would be quicker than a pen, but still messy. Spike-it is one brand (of many) that has both dip and pens."
1336766,JayM5209,2011-08-02 22:09:00,1050,Don't know if any of these are getting close to what you're looking for. . . Cabelas has one that's a bubblegum body and chartreuse tail.

1338050,stevensinks,2011-08-07 08:30:00,330,Thanks for the info. I thought I had found a 100 but when the guy checked they had been sold. So Im still looking. Why has red gotten so hard to find? If I cant find any I have never tried dye but I may have to.
1338069,Bill Krejca,2011-08-07 09:15:00,6107,You may not want to dip too many at one time. My luck with dipping has been the the dip color eventually takes over the whole lure. Bill Krejca
