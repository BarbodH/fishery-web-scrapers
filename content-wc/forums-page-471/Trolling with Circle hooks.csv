My wife has a habit when we are trolling to just begin reeling in when she has a hit while trolling. While she catches her fare share she loses more than she should as well. One of my favorite methods is to Lindy rig with floating jigs. This year to help my wife I Lindy rigged circle hooks with a sliding float above the hook. She trolled with the bail open and line in her index finger. When she felt a hit she let line out for a couple of seconds then began realing in. This proved to be the ticket for her as before I typed this I tried to think if she lost a single fish and I do not think she did. At any rate, I am curious how others are have had success fishing with circle hooks. Also is anyone making lead head jigs with circle hooks?"

With the dead bait, there is no wait.I don't fish for walleye with live bait rigs, but if I did, I'd probably prefer circle hooks."
