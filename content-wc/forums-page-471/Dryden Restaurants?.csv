1334916,johnboat,2011-07-28 11:55:00,2014,Wild horses couldn't drag me to the A&W across the street from the Inn we stay at in Dryden. I have eaten at a resturant in a motel in town that was pretty darm good though.
1334970,fishingfever,2011-07-28 13:50:00,85,"For years the only place we've eaten coming and going is the A&W. Guess I won't have to save a seat for ""johnboat"". To each his own."
1335029,Blue Lk,2011-07-28 15:51:00,269,"If you enjoy Chinese food the Hong Kong House in downtown Dryden is excellent,the place is nothing fancy but the food & buffet are great."
1335039,Bobbajig,2011-07-28 16:17:00,24,my family and I used to eat at Kuppers the food was excellent but the best treat was the chocolate rumballs from their bakery!!
1335112,lunker99,2011-07-28 19:52:00,236,Does the Transcanada serve breakfast?
1335177,Skywagon,2011-07-29 05:46:00,1106,"I just checked, Trans-Canada opens at 6:00 AM for breakfast."
1335219,Pezman38,2011-07-29 07:38:00,3196,"Yep, Sorry forgot to mention that we eat breakfast their before heading the rest of the way north! Food is always good."
1336929,johnboat,2011-08-03 13:03:00,2014,"It's not that the food is bad its this: 5 years running I have ordered the Papa Burger or what ever it is called. It comes with cole slaw. They have never had cole slaw. So I ask to just substitute fries then. They say sure but always CHARGE me for the fries. So I end up paying full boat for a combo meal that I don't even get. And extra for fries to substitute for what I don't get. Plus, twice they were out of Root Beer! And once they didn't have ice cream. Mercy, Thats like going to Hooter's and having male waiters, no chicken wings or beer. I know, its no biggie. But sheese a man's got to take a stand sometime. Maybe I'm just a tad craby after the ride to get there. My new plan works better anyway: I make up a bunch of sloppy joe mix at home, freeze it haul that and patato salad up, nuke it in the hotel lobby, have supper, then start on a little Evan Williams - coke - and a splash of water. And everyone is the better for it!"
1336932,Guest,2011-08-03 13:10:00,0,A&W out of Root Beer? u gotta be kidding That's like Wrigely running out of beer.
1336942,Lovetofish,2011-08-03 13:33:00,458,Next time just get the Chuby Chicken. lol
1334706,rather-be-fishin,2011-07-28 00:30:00,429,Looking for a good place with good food to eat lunch in Dryden on our way to Ear Falls area of Lac Seul.....Heading up there this Sat. 7/30. Would appreciate any recommendations! 2 days and can't wait to be back on the waters of Lac Seul! RBF!
1334717,Blue Lk,2011-07-28 04:53:00,269,http://experiencedryden.ca/placestodinec29.phpTake your pick.
1334732,NARDA 1,2011-07-28 06:11:00,636,Kuppers Bakery would get my vote.
1334744,tackleman,2011-07-28 06:48:00,444,"no doubt about it, the place to get a good lunch, lots of food for a reasonable price, the patricia inn, located at the stop lights on the way to walmart. if you come up 502 and go into town past the paper mill, don't turn left at the lights , go straight, it takes you past the high school, safeway and over the railway lines on the bridge. when you get to the stop lights, go straight across the highway and into the parking lot.the wife and I eat there every time we go to dryden, great value and good food."
1334749,CI_Guy,2011-07-28 06:55:00,2118,"We ate at the Patricia Inn last week going through Dryden. 3 out of 4 thought the food was terrible! My wife, who doesn't complain about food often, ordered pancakes off the breakfast menu at lunch time and said they were inedible!"
1334756,tv4fish,2011-07-28 07:03:00,2694,"Tackleman: I have to agree with CI_GUY - when did you have decent food at the P.I. -- we HAVE tried it a couple of times - and I would never recommend it to anyone. The truck stop that is located west of the P. I. has your ""typical"" truck stop food. ""rather be fishin"" -- Are you looking for ""home cookin"" style food or ???"
1334763,Mark R,2011-07-28 07:07:00,1538,Is the PI across from McDonalds? need a spot that has room to park the a vehicle towing a boat.
1334766,Skywagon,2011-07-28 07:10:00,1106,"I would suggest the TransCanada. It is a good restaurant on the west side of town, on the south side of the road, only a block or so west of DQ on route 17. The food is good, the helpings are generous and it is where I go more than the other sit down places in town. I go to the Patricia Inn on occasion, but it is a ways down my list. Cuppers is good, more expensive and in my estimation, is more of a place to go for the ladies in town, I do go there with my wife, as I need refining."
1334782,Mohleye,2011-07-28 07:30:00,368,"There's also a Tim Horton's in Dryden, which is sort of the Canadian equivalent of Culvers."
1334786,Pezman38,2011-07-28 07:34:00,3196,+1 Been going to TransCanada for supper the last 7 years. The other guys in my group have been going longer.
