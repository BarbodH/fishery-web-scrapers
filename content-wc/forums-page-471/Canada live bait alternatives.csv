1337545,kansasity,2011-08-05 07:18:00,80,"I think we are gonna have an array of viddles for the fishy's this year. Crawlers, minnows, live and gulp 3"", heavily scented plastics as I have been soaking them for over 2 months now with Kickin Bass, and Kickin Walleye scent. I do have a bag of the Berkley Power Bait leeches. The ones mentioned in this thread already. Just happened to come across some. Hopefully they will see something they want! Good luck. Mike"
1337950,greenie,2011-08-06 17:16:00,87,Usually we get minnies but this year we are bringing 2 flats of crawlers. Twister Tails with no bait works good. Cranks will produce. Spinnerbaits work for Sm. Bass and Nortrons. 6½ days til we are on our way to the English River at Grassy Narrows!! Woo Hoo!!
1338126,northsky99,2011-08-07 13:53:00,41,When people say they are using 3 and 4 inch gulp are the using the scented ones or just the the ones that come in the packages .Which ones are more effective in your opinion?
1338128,Bill Krejca,2011-08-07 14:07:00,6107,"The ones in the package are also allegedly scented. I use those in the package because I think it is the action, rather than scent that accounts for most of the fish, and those in the package are priced better. Bill Krejca"
1330408,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-16 07:21:00,1460,"Sometimes I will bring up a doz. of frozen ciscos. Make a harness on cisco and throw out in bay under bobber. As the cisco thaws, the smell will draw in the pike from afar. At least that is my story and I'm sticking to it.This year I tried ciscos for walleye. I choose a Gapen ""Ugly Bug"" jighead with no body and put cisco on. Bam, nice wally. I decided to try cut bait ciscos with good results. Anyone else have more experience with ciscos?The first time I decided to use them was when I took my oldest son on his first trip. I had my boy make a harness and threw off dock first night in camp. Boy catches dock pike = trip sucess for DadSlayer"
1330447,orchard frank,2011-07-16 09:54:00,1900,"Second on the crank suggestion, specifically Hot-N-Tots. They work great, trolled, cast a mile, bang them off the rocks, catch pike and smallies great too. Another thing that worked really well for us was tube baits. Sometimes they really out-produced twisters and other plastics. My best was a pretty big 3-4"" with a light head inside, 1/8 oz. Pumkinseed (I think it is called), kind of a orange/yellow with dots, was a great color. Glide-type retrieve instead of jigging. They would inhale those things. Sometimes we would leave camp without any live bait on purpose, just to make sure we stuck with artificials. Jigging spoons and blade baits are also a hoot on deep reef edges. Talked to a group of guys one time that swore by Mepps -type spinners. fun learning the presentation tricks that will help the artificials work best."
1335969,halfmoon007,2011-07-31 19:38:00,121,"we have gone in to Canada (Ramsey lake) totin 3 flats of crawlers for the last 20 years. jigging with a 3 inch twister tail and a crawler. and we have found that mister twister has a sassy grub (Not shad) in a perch color. this plastic out fishes our old method 2 to 1 by far. dont understand it but it works. going in in august with only 1 flat cause we bottom bounce floating harnesses and spin-n-glo rigs. mister twister is clearancing thier 25 packs of these on their web site its about 25 for 3$ something, they have a great web site. we also use other colors of these. give em a try. Good luck all, Halfmoon from Michigan"
1336036,DavKin,2011-08-01 04:45:00,104,"Pikeslayer8, Yes, sometimes we use pieces of cisco a.k.a. junk. We fish it either vertically on a lead head or Lindy rig with a floating jig head or plain hook. It is a nice diversion when crawlers and leeches are slow."
1336051,GWC,2011-08-01 06:41:00,1021,"We seldom use live bait. Twister tails, bagleys & bandits have produced a lot of fish for us. Yes, there are times when minnows work well & other techniques are slow. Minnow get expensive so we usually keep switching lures until we find something that works. One year, my fishing partner & I tried every lure we had in our tackle box(s) and just about everything caught fish. This was in June & the fish were in shallow. We would use a lure until we caught a fish or gave up then switched to another lure. The dept the lure & distance behind the boat seem more important than style or color. What we missed in numbers was made up in size. While we fish for walleye on most days, we also enjoy fishing for northern's. We've taken several 40 inch & over Northern's using light tackle (8 pound line on light rods). We have had some nice walleye as well. I would say that 80% are usually over the limit in size. When we use live bait, we catch a lot of small fish. We normally make a June trip but we have also gone in September and we've done well on all of our trips. We're planning another trip in September this year. This will be my seventh trip to Gullrock & Poplar Point Resort. Guess I'm hooked on both."
1336101,Bill Krejca,2011-08-01 08:59:00,6107,"Besides the Gulp 3"" and 4"" minnows I've mentioned before, another sometimes excellent bait is the Berkely Powerbait black leeches. These are the 3"" older plastic models, not the Gulp models. They are a little hard to find. I like to use an orange 5/8 oz jighead, the Do-It mold being called ""Walleye"" and I remove the shoulder with wire cutters, use a short shank #1 or 1/0 ""bait"" hook. I like to fish this straight down, just off the bottom and give it a barely up and down wiggle, and hang on! Bill Krejca"
1336140,JayM5209,2011-08-01 10:57:00,1050,"For someone who has only used live bait in the past, I think the thing to do is take a variety of the plastics and/or lures mentioned in this thread and experiment. Then use whatever works for you. It's a great mystery to me why a particular bait, lure, or presentation works for one person and not another. It takes trial and error - lots of experimenting - to find the things that work for you, that you're comfortable with, and that you develop confidence in.As for me, over the years I've accumulated enough lures, baits, plastics, etc., etc., to last me, my son, and my granddaughter our lifetimes, and still have stuff left for my great, great, great grandkids to get rid of in a garage sale. I cannot catch a fish on a Gulp product. Just can't, and I've tried hard to do it. On the other hand, if I could only take one presentation on a week long trip to Canada, it would be a bag of Cabelas' Action Tail Shads, 3"" inch size in the Reel Shad color, and a handful of Blakemore Road Runner jigs, chartreuse color only. The only backup would be several Northland Whistler jigs, preferably white but chartreuse would do. With those few items in my pocket, I'm confident I'd eat walleyes every day."
1336176,Lovetofish,2011-08-01 12:49:00,458,Salted minnows.
1336686,Bigstorm,2011-08-02 17:33:00,799,"I agree with using salted minnows, buy them at a place local that lets you scoop your own, salt them (about 10doz per bag) then freeze them until you get up there.They work as well as a live minnow in my opinion and last longer on the hook. Even as the get chewed up, you can ball them up on the hook and still catch more than you would on plastics (on average)"
1336706,bigwalleye1,2011-08-02 18:32:00,2632,"Not exactly on point, but I can relate at $4/dozen. I went the other way and sought out the local bait wholesaler. We're buying a quart of minnows (30 dozen) for $55, or about $1.85/doz. We run 60 doz in a 4 day trip, and we're now saving $140 on minnows. If you're fishing Lac Seul, PM me for more info."
1330140,NathanH,2011-07-15 08:23:00,697,"Wanted to get some feedback from those who go to Canada about what types of bait they are using. It looks like leeches run around 35-45 dollars per pound and minnows are 4 dollars a dozen. While I'm sure will be paying for leeches and some minnows I am also looking for other options in the plastics dept. One thing I know we won't do is pull worms, very effective just not our cup of tea. So what types of plastics are you using? If you can be specific with brand, color and size thats great. Also if you have a brand you just hate or don't care for let me know that as well. I just started using some Mister Twister Tails 3 in black and have been pleasantly surprised. I also purchased some Northland Grubs to try as well but haven't yet."
1330154,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-15 08:57:00,1460,"Nathan, Great question. Plastics are my downfall. Love to buy em. Often, I don't even use at all like I plan so diligantly. This year I tried out Berkley's Power Nymph. Power Nymph, love the name better than the results, but when downsizing it wasn't bad. My favorite on Canadian shield is gulp Hellgramite, black. Order online as hard to find in tackle shops. Tried new Ripple Mullett. Liked it more for crossover lures for pike. Thumper tails were hot for me. Like the black and gold, and try to trim small."
1330185,erieangler,2011-07-15 10:52:00,57,"I swear by berkley gulp alive leeches. You may find them a bit high priced, but consider that I can usaully catch 3 or 4 fish on the same bait. They are productive on walleye and pike on the jig, float and slip rig. I. No longer use live bait in Canada."
1330203,twobearlake,2011-07-15 11:43:00,379,"I have been having great success for walleye and smallies with the all-white Trigger X paddle tails. They are much more durable than the gulp and I can usually catch 10-15 fish on each bait - I do need to keep spraying the scent though. The main reason I need to switch baits is when there is a short strike and the tail gets nipped off. I was skeptical at first, but now I am really liking the action of these baits. I use them with a 1/8 or 1/4 oz no-snag jig head (white/orange, white/pink, or black). Interestingly, I have found the all-white Trigger X to out fish the black/white and the black/blue 10:1. I plan to try all-white twister tails/paddle tails soaked in the Trigger X ""sauce"" and see how that works - sure would save $.TB"
1330227,HeHooksHimself,2011-07-15 12:35:00,725,"Walleye Assassins are my favorite plastics. I get the shad color with the twister tail (other tail choices are not as effective). They are hard to find so I usually order them online (Bass Assassin website) for somewhere around $4/dozen. The electric chicken color works well too and about three years ago was the hot bait. We just put them on a 3/16 oz. jighead, usually chartreuse. We catch smallies and pike on them as well. Of course one pike and they are usually unusable."
1330233,twobearlake,2011-07-15 12:45:00,379,"Excellent info. I love the Shad Assassins for bass, I did not know of the Walleye Assassins. I'll give them a try. No luck with the paddle tails, just the curly tails?Thanks.TB"
1330291,Guest,2011-07-15 17:04:00,0,Slimers are great! Used them a lot up to Pasha lake and the wallies loved them.A little expensive but sure a lot cheaper than real leeches and a lot easier to keep. Different sizes and colors.
1330341,Guest,2011-07-15 20:43:00,0,Forget the minnows and leeches. We have used all three the past 25 years in Ontario and the crawlers will almost always out fish the other two especially in the summer months. Good luck!
1330351,adempsey,2011-07-15 21:36:00,963,"Gulp Minnows 3"" and 4"" in black shad on jigs.Gulp Fry on slow death hooks.Gary Yamamoto 3"" and 4"" single tail grubs on jigs. I use bubble gum/cream white/blue pearl silver flake/clear large silver flake/root beer large gold flake/gold pearl/pearl gold and black flake/baby bass/natural shad. The Kinami brand are the same but cheaper with fewer color choices, they are an off label ran by his son or something - so get these if you can find them.Yum 3"" and 4"" walleye grubs in white or pink blush. Best value and top producer for me. I am slowly migrating over to the Yum grubs from the Yamamoto since they really produce and are far cheaper and more durable. Although, I doubt I will totally eliminate using the Yamamoto grubs since they are truly excellent baits.I also like Kalin's grubs, but I don't normally use the ones I have for walleye fishing. I have a bunch for panfish (2"") and for pike/musky (5""/6""). I wouldn't hesitate to use them for walleye too though, I just have a boatload of the others to use.Pink and white are my go to colors. Always produce."
1330400,v-bay gord,2011-07-16 06:55:00,3168,If you really want to get away from live bait then don't overlook crankbaits. We are into mid July and trolling baits such as a Rapala Taildancer will still produce walleyes for me. It's a simple and highly effective technique.
