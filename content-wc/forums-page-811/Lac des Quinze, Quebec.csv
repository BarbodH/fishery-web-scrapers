540144,Guest,2004-05-31 10:31:00,0,"Just got back from a week at Lac des Quinze/Lac Simard. Weather was cold and wet but the walleyes were hot! Our group caught over 400 hundred for the week, most in the 15-18"" range with 5 biggies over 28"". They were hitting all day and did not need to go out at night or at dawn. Pike were also good with two 41"", a 42"" and one 44""!"
540151,jale6666,2004-05-31 16:52:00,14,"I too just returned from lac des quinzes from a weeks fishing. we were fishing the northern end near remigny. Although the weather was poor the bite was decent, caught our limit every day, no larger fish but most in the 16 19 inch range. RENE... what part of the reservoir were you fishing? where were you staying? We have only fished that end of the reservoir and were looking for some info on the rest. feel free to e-mail me with some info if you are willing to help. jale6666"
540228,Guest,2004-06-02 17:32:00,0,"jale, we stayed at a friends cottage at Grassy Narrows. Fished Simard and the east part of des Quinze. Usually just located them on fish finder and either jigged with jigs tipped with nightcrawlers. Also trolled Hot n Tots and Rapalas as well as Lindy Type rigs."
540230,jale6666,2004-06-02 19:33:00,14,Rene...if you don't mind could you drop me an e-mail so i could ask you a few more questions about that end of lac des quinzes thanks jale6666
540297,Guest,2004-06-04 10:08:00,0,we call 16-18 inch walleye cigars or bug eaters in Erie.
540298,McQ,2004-06-04 10:30:00,615,"Up here we call them ""DINNER"" nothing finer tasting than a polluton free cold water, walleye filet."
540346,Guest,2004-06-05 08:28:00,0,"Pollution free? Anywhere there is man there is pollution. Don't the environmentalists talk about airborne ddt and pcb coming from third world nations. Have you ever seen a lead smelter in Canada pouring black smoke into the sky, and a paper mill spewing pollutates in the water. I have, in your pristine Canada, on my way up to those beautiful infertile lakes with clear water and small walleye. The only reason there still are some big pike up there is that the Indians dogs won't eat them."
540350,McQ,2004-06-05 09:33:00,615,"You raise a good point about the pollution issue - I'll tame down the retoric and suggest that a visit to points further north will expose you to less pollution than you are accustomed to, people and environmental."
539984,Guest,2004-05-26 12:41:00,0,Anyone ever fish here? Headed up in July and was wondering what to expect. thanks.
540007,Guest,2004-05-27 00:12:00,0,"I fished it when I was younger and went ice fishing there 2 years ago. All I can tell you is that its a pretty big lake, for around here anyway. We didn't do to great ice fishing but when your hut isn't in a good spot then there isn't much you can do about it in winter. I remember catching good size walleye in the 3-4 pound range when I was younger. Lac des quinze is connected to a huge chain of lakes that end up in the outaouais river. You can actually drive a boat from lac des quinze to ottawa! So there is a lot of water to explore. Hope this helps. If I can dig up any more info I will et you know."
540030,Guest,2004-05-27 16:06:00,0,"We went twice to Lac des Quinze and we did horrible. We went to the lower end of the lake, and drove 10 miles by water to Lake Sumard, and fished there. In the 2 times we fished it, the largest walleye was only 5 pounds. Some days we had to drive to town and buy hamburger because we couldn't catch dinner! The camp owner blamed the Indians, Canadians blame the Americans, the French the English... Whatever the cause, you could have better fishing in the states and save a whole lot of cash, or do more research into more remote lakes farther north."
540060,Guest,2004-05-28 11:50:00,0,"Fished des Quinze and Lac Simard over the past 10 years and have never been skunked. Many 50+ walleye days, big pike and 4-5 lb. smallmouth later in the summer."
540086,Guest,2004-05-29 07:53:00,0,"Bob, I also live in Ohio. We have a small lake here called Lake Erie. A place where some call it the walleye capital of the world. My personal best from there is 12 pounds. What's your biggest Simard. Erie has 9 pound bass, my best 7 pounds. What's your biggest from Simard? My question is, why spend all that money, drive all those miles to a place that has no better fishing than Mosquito Lake. Yes Canada is beautiful. If your going to spend the time and money to go there, go to better lake! Do your research, find a more remote lake with a southern drainage for big walleye, pike, and bass."
540087,Guest,2004-05-29 08:58:00,0,"I agree on Lake Erie, but...... Went out of Port Clinton last Monday, waves almost rolled over one boat and had to catch a guy that almost went over the side. Waves were 4 to 6 instantly, caught a couple of nice eyes just before we got blown off the lake. Last year Memorial Day weekend, same thing. Wind changed and got hit broadside by a rogue wave almost rolled over. Love the lake and the huge fish but it can really get bad in a hurry."
540089,Guest,2004-05-29 09:40:00,0,"For the amount of money you'll spend going to Canada, you could charter for a week with a small group of guys on Lake Erie. You'll be on the fish, and on a sea worthy boat. If the weather isn't any good in Ohio, Ontario won't be any better."
540090,McQ,2004-05-29 11:39:00,615,Lac des Quinzes is a reservoir and part of the Hydro Electric reservoir system of the upper Ottawa River. Walleye and Pike fishing is excellent. If you are interested I have free Quebec bathymetric charts (over 2300) in .tif format on my group site at http://groups.msn.com/mcqonfishing which include most of the lakes along the system and they can be opened with MS Image or Photoshop. Site access requires registration with MSN passport or your hotmail account - select Quebec lake maps from the menu and email your request to [email protected] .
540091,Guest,2004-05-29 12:34:00,0,Thanks for the responses. McQ thanks for the info and link. Should find some usefull info at your site.
540122,McQ,2004-05-30 14:06:00,615,"Thanks Fred, I try to bring as much information as I can to this site. Walleye Central is the prime information center for many of us."
