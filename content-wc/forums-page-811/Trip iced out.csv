540378,Atlanta Dave,2004-06-06 17:46:00,323,Talk about a bummer we were to leave thurs for Lake Athabasca and knew the 1st week had canceled and found out tonight our week is canceled. Tough after you wait a year and lose your week. Hope no one else has this problem. Atlanta Dave

540380,McQ,2004-06-06 20:20:00,615,"Dave, that's terrible. I know how you feel, plan - plan - plan and then to have this happen is sure a downer. Can you get in at a later date?"
540404,Guest,2004-06-07 14:04:00,0,"Dave, That really sucks!! I was cancelled out of Misaw the 15th of this year but was able to re-book for the 20th to the 28th. i am crossing my fingers. Are you re-booking for this year? Did your buddy e-mail you the information i sent him?"
540405,Guest,2004-06-07 14:47:00,0,Dave - its so unpredictable that first week of June with the ice. I was able to rebook with Arctic Lodges on Reindeer Lake on the Manitoba/Saskatchewan border. You may want to check them out
540412,Atlanta Dave,2004-06-07 18:57:00,323,Everyone thanks for feeling our pain. We have the opportunity to go the 20 of August. 2 in our group took that option I for one will wait till next year no matter how much it sucks.Some how to me a week the end of August does not a week in June make.As I said before I wish this on no one else it is painful. Atlanta Dave
540416,Northern Manitoban,2004-06-07 21:56:00,195,You got that right August doesn't compare to June fishing.I have room for one more guy in my boat this week lol.Oh well good luck next year and enjoy the summer.I'm sure you will find some great action somewhere? NM
