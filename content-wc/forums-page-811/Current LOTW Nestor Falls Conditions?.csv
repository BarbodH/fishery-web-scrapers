Rising waters, and still relatively cooler temps delayed the walleye spawn, and most other typical spring movements. Everything considered, it looks like a week or more behind ""normal"". That, of course, can change quickly. But, at least you'll be looking at higher water than last year."

Although, I caught a nice one yesterday casting the weeds for northern. Weeds are just starting to come up in Stevens and Stoney, not so many in Sabaskong. Have seen a few muskies moving in to spawn, but not beat up yet. Walleye fishing has been pretty good. Can't predict the Mayfly hatch this year. The weather has been too unpredictable."
