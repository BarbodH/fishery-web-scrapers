540396,Trailerguy,2004-06-07 09:24:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]A quick look at bank exchange rates today say 1 USD = $1.3271 Canadian. However if you don't exchange your money at a bank you can expect that tourist operators who are there to make money, are going to do just that!"

540415,Guest,2004-06-07 21:16:00,0,Credit cards are nice but some charge an extra 3% for using one. Ask before you slide the plastic. Banks on the other hand charge a 4% rate for cash transactions exchanges so it all balances out.
