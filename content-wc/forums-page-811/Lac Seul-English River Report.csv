We caught about 50 to 75 walleye/sauger/whitefish/perch/northern a day and didnt really fish that hard. Had a couple of windy days but overall a good trip. The males were all staged below the Dam and the females were coming in, you could not of hit it on any better week. The eyes were in and hungry. alot of 14""-17"" walleyes and the biggest around 22""-26"" all in all a great trip to ear falls I also ran into Walleyefisher below the Dam one day they got blown off Lac Seul and I'm sure He can confirm the great fishing below the Dam, Though the said they also did very well on Lac Seul about 100 fish a day. Well there you have it, Any Questions??????????????????"
