The only hard part is getting the crimped S-Hooks off the chain. Either take it to a service station or borrow a bolt cutter to get them off. I have yet to find these hooks made out of high test steel so they aren't very hard to cut off. Have the new set of hooks w/clasps with you that you pick up at any hardware store, open the clasps and slide them onto the last link of your safety chain. In regards to czy42strokes post about trailer safety I noticed a statement it is against the law to tow more than one trailer behind your vehicle unless your driving a commercial vehicle. My question - is a fifth wheel considered to be a trailer? Is it okay to have a pickup towing a fifth wheeler and have a boat hooked up behind the fifth wheeler? I do know in Minnesota it is legal with a fifth wheel trailer but not with an ordinary travel trailer. I've seen this fifth wheel hookup often in Ontario and can't believe people are doing it if it is illegal. I wish when the so called experts write these helpful hints they would try to think of all the different scenarios to save on the confusion. Two couples in our group are thinking of doing this very same thing this year and it would be nice to know if we will get pulled over because of it."
540385,Guest,2004-06-06 23:50:00,0,I read the government thing and I could be wrong but it does not say that you must have locking hook it just reccomends it. like the chain it says but my trailer came with a cables. I would think if these things were mandatory they would put it that way not just reccomend.
540386,Guest,2004-06-06 23:55:00,0,I just reread it again and the first line says MUST HAVE 2 methods of connecting the trailer to the tow vehicle. the part about the chains crossing and the latches that close is only RECOMENDED! If the latches and chains crossing were mandatory it also would have said MUST!
540402,Guest,2004-06-07 13:12:00,0,"I agree, this is confusing....for what it is worth here's another reg I got from: <http://www.canlii.org/on/laws/regu/1990r.618/> (2) The safety connecting device referred to in subsection (1) shall, (a) not be attached to any part of a trailer hitch that would render the safety connecting device ineffective should the trailer hitch or its attachment to the towing structure fail; (b) have the minimum slack necessary for adequate articulation; (c) have an ultimate strength not less than the gross weight of the trailer or trailers being towed and where the safety connecting device consists of two chains, two cables or two other links, each chain, cable or other link and its attachments shall have an ultimate strength equal to the gross weight of the trailer or trailers being towed; (d) be connected in such a manner so as to prevent the tow bar from dropping to the ground, and to keep the swing of the full trailer within safe limits in the event the tow bar fails or becomes disconnected; (e) be equipped with a hook or hooks or other means of attachment that will not become disconnected accidentally;"
540419,tjsker,2004-06-08 07:53:00,301,To me that sounds like you should have a clip on that S-hook or you'll lose in court.

540440,tjsker,2004-06-08 14:54:00,301,"Got new chains last November, cost me $15,000. Of course it had to come with a new trailer, boat and outboard. My wife was not impressed, LOL."
540172,PigBoy,2004-06-01 12:28:00,120,"I was doing an archive search and found this little tidbit from 2002, anyone know if this is still in effect? Ontario regulations require that your chain hooks not be the simple 'S' hooks. They must be the type that has a locking clasp. I am heading up in a couple of weeks and need to know if I need to make changes to my safety chains."
540173,Guest,2004-06-01 12:49:00,0,"I would. I have to do mine as well. But seeing how you're not a resident, you don't want a fishing day ruined my having the MTO pull you over on a roadside check. Those MTO guys are everywhere these days....looking at big rigs, small utility trailers, and I'm sure, guys towing boats. Be careful, and for a few paltry dollars it will be peace of mind. J"
540175,Guest,2004-06-01 14:17:00,0,"YES the law is hooks with safety clasps it is being enforced in southern ontario every weekend,save yourself some possible grief,spend 10 bucks and put a set on"
540197,Guest,2004-06-02 07:04:00,0,"I use a piece of bicycle inner tube and it has been reported on here that it is legal. Just cut two inch wide rubber bands. Put it on the S hook, hook up the hook and strecth the rubber across the opening. I did not describe it very well, but if your hook can not be removed without removing the rubber band, you are probably set."
540219,Guest,2004-06-02 14:31:00,0,I have used the bike tube method for the last 3 years and was stopped and checked two years ago. A trooper was out on 502 about 20 miles south of Dryden. He went back and looked at the hooks and gave me the go ahead. I use two strips of the tube on each hook. It seems to hold tighter.
540220,Guest,2004-06-02 15:04:00,0,"Does this only apply to the safety chain at the front of the boat or does it also apply to the tie-down straps on the back of the boat? If someone had the link to the boating regs for Ontario that specifies this requirement, could you provide the link here? Thanks."
540222,Illini Bob,2004-06-02 15:43:00,16,"My 2003 Lowe came with factory made rubber strips on the S chains. Don't know where you can get them, but I'm sure they are out there somewhere."
540227,Trailerguy,2004-06-02 17:31:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]The rubber band thing used to be acceptable, but this year the regulations reflect a ""closed fastner"", I was told that eliminated the rubber bands."
540235,Guest,2004-06-02 21:12:00,0,Are you refering to the safety chain S hooks from the trailer to the tow Vehicle or the tie dow straps on the back of the boat S hooks? Bud

Pulling a trailer requires extra care and attention. A trailer puts extra weight on your vehicle and increases the space you need to drive and stop safely. Trailer safety involves some simple and important rules. A trailer must be registered and licensed before it can be used on the road. Before using your trailer, make sure it is in safe operating condition. Inspect the lights, tires, brakes (if equipped), bearings, safety chains and hitch.. The law requires brakes on trailers that weigh 1360 kg (3000 lb) or more. Use the correct class of trailer hitch on your vehicle. (Class I  up to 2000 lb; Class II  up to 3500 lb; Class III  up to 5000 lb; Class IV  5000 to 10000 lb) Repair or replace broken or worn out hitches. Contact a trailer hitch retailer for more information. Thinking of buying a trailer? Consider the size, power and condition of your vehicle. Trailer dealers can help match your vehicle with the right type of trailer and the proper hitch system. You must have two separate means of attachment between your vehicle and the trailer. Safety chains should be crossed under the tongue to prevent the tongue from dropping to the road should the primary hitch accidentally disconnect. It is RECCOMENDED that chain hooks have latches or devices that prevent accidental disconnect. The breaking strength of each chain should equal the gross weight of the towed trailer. (See: Farm Vehicles and Equipment and The Highway Traffic Act, Appendix A - chain grades charts.) Chains are required for goose neck type trailers that utilize a ball and socket type hitch. Fifth-wheel type hitches that have safety latches do not require safety chains. When attaching the trailer to a vehicle, make sure it is hitched securely. The trailer tongue should be snug on the ball when locked. Never overload the trailer. Overloading or poor load distribution can cause serious swaying and separation when driving and possible tire, wheel bearing and axle failure. Also, the law requires that loose objects be covered with a tarp and everything be strapped down so nothing can bounce or fly off. Adjust vehicle mirrors to clearly see traffic approaching from behind. Keep the load low. Use extension mirrors if necessary. It is against the law to tow more than one trailer behind your vehicle unless using a commercial vehicle. You cannot carry people in a house or boat trailer. You cannot accelerate as fast when towing a trailer, or stop as quickly. Maintain a speed that avoids sudden stops and slow-downs. Be alert, increase your following distance, keep out of fast lanes of traffic and always use your signals when passing or turning. Road Safety. It starts with you"
