I chose the Lund because I have always wanted a Lund, but every time i see a Viper go by I can't help to wonder if I wouldn't have liked it more. I think the one I drove went about 42 MPH with two guys in it. I do remember that the storage was a little short on that boat, i think it was a 2000 model."

Here is my 2004, I know many guys that have this boat back to 1996 and none have had any problems with the glass or anthing. Here is my boat $22,900 loadeed up.http://community.webshots.com/album/89962196lTFhTh"
