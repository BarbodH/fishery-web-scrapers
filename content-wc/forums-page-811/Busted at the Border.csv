Posted on Sun. May 30, 2004 Anglers at border caught over limit BY CHRIS NISKANEN Pioneer Press Minnesota conservation officers have made another bust of illegal fish stowed away in a vehicle. But this time, the vehicle was coming from Canada. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers were conducting a search on a vehicle at the Minnesota border May 25 when they suspected something fishy. The Missouri pickup, with two men and a woman, contained a cooler with a legal limit of 12 walleyes and 12 northerns. (The Ontario limit is four walleyes and four northerns each.) When a customs agent conducted a secondary search, looking under the hood, he found two large yellow plastic bags and a bottle of alcohol hidden on top of the engine. That's when Minnesota conservation officer Lloyd Steen of Ray, Minn., who had been called in to help with the inspection, questioned one of the men. ""He said he was the one who hid the fish under the engine hood and he should be the one held responsible,'' Steen said. ""I explained to him that they were all in possession of the fish, and I found it hard to believe that his partners didn't see the fish being placed under the hood."" The bags contained 41 frozen and partially frozen walleyes and 12 northern pike. The three Missouri anglers were fined $880 for possessing an overlimit of Ontario walleyes and importing them into Minnesota. They were Dennis A. Berger, 45, of Blue Springs; David E. Holley, 44, of Lake Lotawana; and Brenda S. Bowen, 46, of Browning. Lino Lakes officers recently pulled over a vehicle on Interstate 35 that smelled fishy. That vehicle contained 117 walleyes, which resulted in charges for several Minneapolis men. A search at the anglers' home turned up 305 sunfish, 145 over their limit. The men face fines up to $3,000 and possible jail time."

540270,retire55,2004-06-03 17:16:00,1029,"Maybe if the fine per fish over limit was more painful like $100 per fish instead of the paultry $20 per fish, poachers would think again. $4100 would have hit their pockets books a lot harder than $880."
540289,Ivy,2004-06-04 07:32:00,556,I find it hard to understand smuggeling food across the border. A fisherman smuggeling fish across the border is like a Farmer smuggeling vegetables across the border. Ya gotta know he can get more. It's not like Canada is the only place in the world you can catch fish. Ivy

I would say you need stiffer penalties down there! Wonder why they didnt turn them over to the Canadian authorities?"

I understand accidents will happen, but 41 over and 113 over is unforgiveable. Make an example out of these idiots. I'd keep going, but I don't want to share my true feelings. Especially regarding out of state people who.... OK now I'm fired up.....Better get off."
540432,Guest,2004-06-08 13:19:00,0,"I'll finish your statement for you ""Pissed Off"". At least this is what I would have said . . . especially out-of-state people who can't catch fish like that at home because their parents and grandparents committed the same brutal act for years to their local fishery, ultimately causing it to collapse. You would think they would learn, but instead the selfish punks need to travel and rape other fisheries. You know what, now I am getting really pissed off too with the more I think about it . . ."
