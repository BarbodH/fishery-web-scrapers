WALLEYES PROBIBLY WILL BE MORE SCATTERED BY JUNE 18, MORE SHALLOW, 14-17FT."

The ? is, are there any reputable bait shops along the road in that area to get supplies? We will be staying at Miles Bay Camp, are there any hotspots in the Miles Island area a guy should know about. Any other tips about the area would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. RKG"
540288,MTJ,2004-06-04 07:29:00,106,"When are you headed up? Right now I would target walleyes in the shallows near spawning grounds. They may be moving to transition areas soon, which would be points and weedlins relative to spawning grounds. As for bait shops, Mylies has minnows but I would call if you are looking for leaches. If you plan on using crawlers I would pick them up on the US side, just make sure they are in artificial bedding and have the clerk write you an invoice that says ""out of dirt for 15 days"". MTJ"
540296,Shorelunch,2004-06-04 09:13:00,554,Mylies or Buena Vista are good bait stops. BV has a decent store along with the bait and excellent bread. They also sell LOW there too. There's also a little cafe and small bait shop (same building) in Bergland that has pretty good food.
540304,Guest,2004-06-04 13:32:00,0,What town are these shops located in? If we should buy crawlers in Mn and call about leeches does that mean the only have minnows?

540305,Guest,2004-06-04 13:49:00,0,"Both Mylie's and BV are in Morson and both have websites. You can email or call them to see what they'll have. I don't know about the lodge you are staying at but many of the island resorts in that area either have or will get crawlers, minnows and leeches for their guests. The island resorts get them from Mylie's or BV."

To find the websites just type in Mylie's Place or Buena Vista Resort. NO POTATOES or dog food accross the boarder. If you are buying booze I would say to pick it up at Tax free just before the bridge, usually works out to be cheapest. Boarder should be no problem. Good group of customs agents this season so far. Good luck and hope to see you on the water. Will also be heading up on the 11th. Hope the weather is good. Fish should be on."
