We've tentatively made a reservation at the Budget Host Inn. Any feedback on this motel? We're just looking for a clean bed to catch a few hours of sleep. Thus far it looks like you can't beat the price.In addition, anyone know a good cigar place in Fort Frances or Dryden? Thanks"
512427,Guest,2001-05-11 18:36:00,0,"There's a cigar store west of Fort Frances, it's almost out of town. Believe they even carry Cuban cigars."
512428,BobG-IL,2001-05-12 16:55:00,7,"Nice motel. Not fancy but very clean and has all the essentials. Barney's Restaurant, directly across the street, serves a very good breakfast.Have a safe trip!Bob"
512429,Karl,2001-05-13 12:18:00,63,"The best place to get good Cuban cigars is in Ft. Frances. They carry Montecristo, Cohiba, Partegas and other top quality cigars.Doc Halliday's Cuban Cigar HousePhone 807-274-0484It's located about two miles west on highway 11/71. Don't know how early they're open. Call beforehand.The ""Cuban"" cigars they sell at all the gas stations are junk."
512430,Guest,2001-05-14 13:06:00,0,"I know I'm going to be called all kinds of ugly names, but (IMHO) Cuban cigars are vastly overrated. Maybe they had their day, but The Dominican Republic has it going on right now and are producing smokes of a higher quality and flavor. (You guys are going to beat me up on this one, I know!! : )"
512431,Guest,2001-05-14 14:15:00,0,"Thanks everyone. Although I've yet to try a true Cuban (but will next week) that's exactly what I've heard Nate. I'm headed up what has not grown to be the dreaded 502, but will make sure to visit the cigar shop in Fort Frances."
512434,Guest,2001-05-15 08:55:00,0,Most of the Cuban cigars found in Canada are rolled in Montreal. The Budget Host is alright. There is a Holiday Inn in I-Falls. TGG
512432,Karl,2001-05-15 16:57:00,63,"You bet I am. First of all, EVERY cigar labeled as Cuban must be imported by ""Havana House"". They have the exclusive rights to import and sell Cuban cigars in Ontario. And they have agents that regularly do spot checks resulting in major fines for selling fake Cubans. So, there ain't no cubans rolled in Montreal being sold anywhere in Ontario, sorry.I never smoked cigars until three years (trips) ago. Started with the cheap celophane wrapped ones. They're junk. You get what you pay for. Next two trips, after doing extensive reseach all winter, I learned what's good and what's not. And sampled, and sampled. My conclusion is that there is absolutely not a better cigar than a Montecristo #4. Last year they cost $20.00 Canadian each. But well worth it. Partegas ""Petit Corona"" came in second, same price. Tied for third were Sancho Panza and Romeo & Juliet petit coronas. Never could justify $50.00 Canadian for a Cohiba, although I'm told they are excellent.Lastly, while Dominican cigars are well made, they in no way compare to Cubans. I live in a major metro area with some very exclusive cigar shops. I've asked the owners if they have anything similar in taste and quality to a Montecristo. Got a resonding ""nothing comes close"" from each of them."
512433,Guest,2001-05-15 18:42:00,0,"I've been dabbling with cigars for about seven or eight years. Had the opportunity to sample several authentic Cubanos while in Jamaca on my honeymoon in 1996 and then again in Nassau two years ago. I have a hard time finding anything that tops an Arturo Feunte #5 Corona. Don't get me wrong, the Cubans I tried (Parteges, Cohiba, Macanudo) were pretty good smokes. But the ones from the Dominican Republic were much more consistant and in my experience have remained so.I recently read (I don't remeber where--Wall Street Journal maybe?) That I'm not alone, Cuban growers are becoming so hungry for foriegn currency, they're rushing the entire process and producing a sub-standard product and the ""mystique"" of Cuban cigars is not nearly as vailid as it was ten years ago.But it all comes down to taste. Tastes are like opinions, every has their own..."
