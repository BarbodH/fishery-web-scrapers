Are the old fashioned bright orange life jackets that fit around your kneck acceptable. They're certainly the most popular in the states, but wanted to make sure they would be OK in the great North. Thanks for the help!!"
512419,Frank from TBay,2001-05-11 02:52:00,312,I always bring my own vest when I go somewhere else. It fits and I know I'll be comfortable. Get a jacket that you can wear comfortably all day. I wear a jacket all the time when travelling on the water and about 75 percent of the time when I'm stopped. Your boat supplier should get you life jackets if he is renting you boats bt thw way. Good luck.....Frank
512420,Moose_MI,2001-05-11 17:04:00,31,Still curious if those good old fashioned life jackets are OK. Some of the guys in the group dont have the nice vests and I dont want them to have to go spend 50 for something there only gonna use once....Thanks all...
512421,whitey,2001-05-13 14:46:00,36,Yes you can still wear the orange ones. Check wall mart etc. vests should only be $20.00
512422,Guest,2001-05-16 06:22:00,0,I believe Ontario requires bright life jackets. So orange yolk type jackets are probably good.
