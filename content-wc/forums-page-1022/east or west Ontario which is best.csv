West is better overall but there are good and bad lakes on both ends.Manitoba and Saskatchewan are much better than Ontario overall. Much more expensive, too.Depending on where you drive from, I would look for the best lake the least distance from you. I would say drive in camps are more plentiful and better fishing on the west end.I know I didn't help, but it was a tough question.TQO"
512601,Guest,2001-05-16 03:21:00,0,I live in the North east and I go to North western Ontario every year. Most of the lakes in the east end have been destroyed by populations and over harvesting. If I can find a good lake in the east i would go to it!!! There is less population of canadians and americans in the wetern part of ontario and it seems that the lakes are not fished qutie as heavily. The east has Toronto and ottowa which are large cities. The west has Kenora? Hope this helps. E-mail if you want some good places on the western end. Good luck.

512602,darcyfish,2001-05-16 13:56:00,15,"Sounds like the west should be your choice, I personally never fished in eastern Ontarion but fish western every summer. Most of the lakes are multi species so you can fish just about anything.This area has heavy fish regulations but it reflects on how good the fishing is and the size of the fish caught(Hawgs) http://www.geocities.com/darcyfish54/1968.html"
512600,Guest,2001-05-16 16:10:00,0,I agree. If its easy to get to its probably have seen its best days. The great lakes of the past are worn out in many cases. With all the trophies taken home and with a short growing season its to be expected. I go way north by the NW territories at a pure catch and release lake. This is the type of place where you can expect many trophies every trip.
