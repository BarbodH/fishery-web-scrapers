Well I am sure it will be an enjoyable trip, hopefully with walleys and small-mouth bass, I could leave the northerns alone. What are some thought about fishing the Winnipeg river? Hope someone can help. Catch and Release. Thanks."

Some days are hit and miss and thewater level can play havoc every once in a while but overall itsa good place for Walleye, Smallmouth and Muskie. Its a big bodyof water and the weather can play a pivitol role as with any large body of water.The ice went out on April 29th. Not sure how the weather hasbeen but I would say pretty typical for this time of the year. I would suspect that the water level is high right now but notfor sure.My only complaint about the Minaki area is that the only store intown has a limited selection of Canadian Brew. Oh well. Good luck"

It's a narrow spot in the river that is full of eyes in the spring. Water temp in the lakes will probably be a bit too cold. Buy your beer early. They close around 5. Marcy's husband is the local mountie. good luck."
