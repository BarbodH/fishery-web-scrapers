I've heard, through my vet, that all I need is an up-to-date rabies, and a clean bill of health voucher from my vet. Am I wrong? I can't seem to find any info on this subject. I need help because he howls at night when I'm not home! LOL"
512463,Guest,2001-05-12 11:58:00,0,"Joe,Yes you can. Your vet is right, so follow his advice about shot records. A suggestion, however, you had better check with the facililty you plan on staying at to see if they allow pets.Remember to keep your eyes open and your feet dry.S.v.m"
512464,Guest,2001-05-12 14:29:00,0,"Just a friendly tip. When traveling with a dog, DO NOT stop at a ""REST PARKS"" on the highway and let your dog out. This is the easiest way to ""pick up something"" from across the country. Look for an exit from the highway that does not have a big station or an attraction. Drive a mile or so and then stop and let your dog out. Caring water and give him a drink but no feed. Feed him at night when he has all night to relax. This will help from having a ""mess"" in the vehicle. Hope this helps a little. We have been at this for over 30 years.www.geocities.com/wrightkennels/"

This will eliminate any hassle that they might give you. I have always had this, and have never had any problems in 10+ years."
512466,Guest,2001-05-15 15:27:00,0,You will need your certificate of vaccination and a clean bill of health from the vet. Depending on where you are going you may want to get the dog a shot for Parvovirus. Check with your vet on this. I believe the virus is in the soil in N.W. Ont. and can be fatal to your dog. Also heart worm pills as we have a few mosquitos. LOL
