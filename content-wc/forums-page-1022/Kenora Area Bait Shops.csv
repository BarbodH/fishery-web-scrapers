Without having to go directly into Kenora town, what else is around. I know of Reddens, Clearwater Shell, and the place near Rabbit Lake, where else is there ?Thanks for the information."

512461,Guest,2001-05-15 15:17:00,0,I second Sunset Baits. I have found it has the best baits in the area but I don't know of any shops outside of town.
