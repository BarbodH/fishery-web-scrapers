I am hoping to get some tips and pointers about fishing that part of the lake that early in the season. Thanks in advance for any help.(Mp35 et al, I've read that you have fished out of Goose Bay and seem to know the lake well. Do you have any GPS coordinates for the NW section like you listed in a post below for another part of the lake? Thanks again.)"
512621,Guest,2001-05-16 16:15:00,0,"See other post for GPS coordinates. This time of year you will probally be heading to Sawmill Bay. Winnasagua river is hot but don't think it opens up till the end of May. If it is closed try the mouth. Bannatyne creek and Iron creek are close to camp and might be a good bet. Another hot spot is Turkey creek in McKenzie bay. Don't know what type of boat you'll have but with a 25hp, McKenzie bay is a good 45min-1hour trip one way in decent seas. Broad lake/Sunlight lake are another hot spot and that is another 45 mins away from McKenzie.Ask Andrea @ Goosebay > she is willing to set you in the right direction and put you onto fish. Get a GOOD lake map > the one's she hands out are not worth much. The 2 tackle shops in Ear Falls have decent maps (Smitties or Two Seasons) In Vermillion bay you can also get them. Get one that has bottom contour lines on it. Once you locate fish the map will help eliminate the areas not to fish. The map she hands out doesn't cover much of the lake. Hope this helps > if ya have more ?? Drop me a line!Be sure to give a fishing report when ya get back.Tell Andrea, Mike & Jo said hello.."
512622,Winnie,2001-05-17 07:54:00,375,"Thanks for the location tips. We fished Sawmill some last year, but didn't do too well. I think they had already moved further out into the lake by then. Anyway, we primarily drifted jigs tipped w/ minnows. What other presentations would you reccomend we try? Thanks for all your help. Promise to give you a recap when I get back."
512623,Guest,2001-05-17 15:59:00,0,"Been going to LS for the last 8 years for a total of 23 weeks of fishing. The first 2 years all I did was jig w/lead heads or floating jigs. Took someone out from the camp and he was a spinner rig guru and that got me hooked! Think in the last 5 years I have gotten out the jigs about a handfull of times. If the bite is reeeeeeeal slow I will get the jigs out, otherwise it is spinner rigs. I do know the locals use the piss out of glow white jigs and pound the ##### out of the eyes. But then they know right where the fish are too! Then again I see them pull spiners expecially when they are a guide. Wonder why that is?Prefer spinner rigs cause you can cover a lot more water vs jig fishing. As you know, that lake can be a b*tch when it comes to boat control. My best luck is on the windy side of any given structure. Spinner rigs allow me to cover more water and to use the wind to my advantage to locate the eyes. Once I locate em, then it's back and forth till no more bites and then move on to another area. I don't burn to much time in a dead area > 20-30 min tops. No fish > move onto more productive waters. A slow day is 30-40 eyes a great day is 75+.I have always had good luck behind Cox's island. There are about 5 islands due east of Cox's island. The furthest 3 have been veryproductive. Always been the east/se sides of those islands.SouthEast end of Cox's island there is a BIG rock (bout the size of a VW car) surrounded by water > south side has been very good.In Steamboat>go throught narrows follow island on your left to the end. 3 islands just east of that long island > Fish the south sides of those islands.Outside Sawmill Bay to the sw is a larger island that has a row of tree stumps on the sw side of it. Decent drop off > 4'-8' in a boat lenght. Eyes will stack up on that drop off. If eye have moved out of Sawmill I'd check that area and the islands to the south of the mouth.When you exit sawmill take a left to follow the shore > there is a hump that runs from shore to the second island on the right.Eyes will stack up on one or the other side of that hump.Hope this helps...."
