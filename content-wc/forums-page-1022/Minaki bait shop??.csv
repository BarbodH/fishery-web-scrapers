512411,Guest,2001-05-11 04:45:00,0,"RC, you can buy bait in Minaki... I don't remember the names butwhen you get there just ask. I think the Marina sells minnows.As for golf, If your a US citizen use to US golf courses yourgonna be disappointed with the courses up that way. I'd stickto fishing."
512412,Guest,2001-05-11 05:34:00,0,"You can get minnows @ Jacks. Located right by Paradise 2.As for golf courses, Falcon Lake is close by. Too bad the lodge is closed, you could have played the 9 at the lodge.If you drove a little further, some nice courses close to the Steinbach area. Another place for bait is right on the river by the train bridge. North Star is the place, go there & Marcie will look after ALL your needs......Good FishenRob"
