512288,Guest,2001-05-06 14:11:00,0,I fish the Nestor Falls area and White Fish Bay. I've often wondered how old the fish are that I'm catching. For example is a three pound walleye 10 years old?
512289,Guest,2001-05-06 16:53:00,0,"Old Fisherman,The following is a chart showing average sizes for walleye. Keep in mind the term average, since many variables such as water temperatures, forage, and genetics will have an affect on these averages. AGE LENGTH WEIGHT 1 -- 5 - 9"" -- 1/4 2 -- 10-11"" -- 3/4 lb.- 1 lb. 3 -- 12-14"" -- 1 1/2 - 2 lb. 4 -- 16-19"" -- 1 3/4 - 2 1/4 lb. 5 -- 19-22"" -- 2 - 3 lb. 6 -- 22-24"" -- 3 - 4 lb. 7 -- 24-26"" -- 4 - 5 lb. 8 -- 26-27"" -- 5 - 7 lb. 9 -- 27-28"" -- 7 - 8 1/2 lb.These growth rates are an average based on several lakes in the Minnesota and Wisconsin areas. In Canada, they may differ slightly, however, this will give you some idea of how old of a fish you are dealing with. The sure method of determing the age of a walleye in to exam a scale under a microscope or magnifying glass and count the annual rings found on that scale. Fish have annual rings, just like trees, and like trees add one ring of growth per year. The maxmium life expectancy for walleye found in Canadian Shield type lakes and other northern lakes is around fifteen (15) years. Hope this helps answer your question and good luck fishing.Remember to keep your eyes open and your feet dry.S.v.m"
512290,Guest,2001-05-14 04:33:00,0,"Having worked with a Fall Walleye Index netting here on Lac Seul; I can safely say that the Minn/Wis data is not applicable to this area of Ontario. 18"" walleye in this general area are usually 6-8 yrs of age with walleye in the 25 to 26"" area as old as 20-25 yrs. We sampled a 23"" female that was 27 yrs old and a very large male if I remember correctly that was 27"" and 26 yrs. The size age relationship is really dependent on open water time and the length of season that enough food is available for growth. The cold summers up here can really limit plankton grow that is a key to the entire food chain."
512291,Guest,2001-05-14 09:40:00,0,"Mr. Greentree,With all due respect, I really have to question some of your data. Now it is true, that the colder the water the slower wallelyes will grow and the longer they will live. Lac Seul is approximately 270 miles north from where I live in Northern Minnesota, and granted there will be many variables involved with the growth of walleyes - seasonal water temperatures, forage available in a given lake, and genetics, but to a great degree these areas would be more similar than different since the the lakes are Canadian Shield and the climates are very similar. Although the chart for ages and size were based on Minn./Wisc. studies that does not mean that they are without merit when it comes to Canadian walleyes. Remember that these charts ARE A ESTIMATE of age and weight. Notice, also that I only went up to nine years of age. The maxmium age was stated to be about 15 years, that is not to say that these fish cannot live longer, especially in lakes found in the very northern tier of the state, such as Lake of the Woods and Saganaga. You have given some statistics that seem to be very inconsistent, such as saying that a sampled 23 inch female was 27 years old, a very large male was 27 inches long and 26 years old. I suppose anything is possible, but this seems highly unlikely, since at that age the female should be much larger than that of a male. Female and male walleyes will grow at approximately the same rate until about their fifth year, when the male growth rate is drastically reduced while the female growth rate continues at a much more rapid rate. Even as the female ages, her growth rate will slow, although it will continue throughout her lifetime. How did you make these determinations? Were these exceptions to the rule (which seems to be the case)? Did you actually count the annual rings on these fish to determine their age? In closing, I realize (as I mentioned in my original post) that ther will be differences in the information I presented from what you may actually find in different areas of Canada, since there is an exception to every rule, but to say that this informatin is not applicable to your area of Ontario is irresponsible on your part. Ontario's (Lac Seul's) walleyes may live in a differenct region, but they do not live in a different world.S.v.m"
512292,Guest,2001-05-14 18:37:00,0,"Soulds like your ego is getting in way of fact and bio. Yes the walleyes here are MUCH older for length. A fact that the average for 18"" is the 6-8 years I spoke of. The average age for 21"" walleye( our upper slot size) is a well documented 11-12 years. The only way to properly age a walleye past 6-9 years, which is the limit for accurate aging using scales collected just behind the pec fin; is to age using the ottilith collected from the inner ear. This is the method used by the MNR to confern all the aging in the thousands of samples fromm scores of lakes across Canada as well as the states. Don't think that the center of the walleye world is Minnesota. We here up north do our homework and ""got the facts""."
512293,Guest,2001-05-15 05:19:00,0,"Mr. Greentree,In response to your critical and somewhat unprofessional post, my ego has nothing to do with the analysis of your statements. As for my questioned qualifications, I would be more than happy to compare my credentials with yours, since you seem to be on the light side of the ""facts"" when it comes to the science of ichthyology. I would suggest that you reread my previous posts, as it seems that you missed the main points that I was trying to stress. I am , however, questioning some of the validity of your statements, which you still have not addressed to my satisfaction.No one has tried to suggest that the ""center of the walley world is Minnesota"". My post was intially intended to pass on some information that was asked by Old Fisherman. I gave the information with the understanding that these were AVERAGES and were subject to variation according to regional locations and other factors involved in the growth and respective age of the walleye. I have the utmost respect for Ontario's MNR and the work that they have done to try and preserve Ontario's natural resources. I'm sure , as you quoted, ""We here up north do our homework and ""got the facts"", no one is trying to suggest otherwise.If you had interpreted my post correctly, you would see that we are basically saying the same thing. Your insistence on disagreement doesn't seem to be based upon the ""facts"" as presented, but rather on the attitude known as U.S. Envy Syndrome. Try to have a good day.S.v.m"

512295,Guest,2001-05-17 04:50:00,0,"I've been following these posts with some interest. One question I do have is, how did the question over the age of walleyes in Lake of the Woods turn into a debate over walleyes found in Lac Seul? IMHO, it seems to me, that both gentlemen, within the context of their discussion, are correct. Jig'N John"
