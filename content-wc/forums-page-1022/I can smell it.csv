Culled a few for the next 15mins and where on our way back to camp before I had even finished my morning coffee.Why did I agree to work today??? I wanna leave now."

Example ""Your dropping your jig and suddenly feel a tick while the jig is still dropping, the line moves to the side..........."" then continue with the next email. When you get to the part about fighting a beast for 30 minutes and finally getting a glimce of a white tail mark watch out because he might be coming through the door with a gaff hook in his hand."
