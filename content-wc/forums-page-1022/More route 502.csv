I'm going toEagle lake, just west of Dryden on the 18th for a week. Don't want to travel an extra 75 miles but if under construction waits could run into the ""hours"" on this opening weekend."

512545,jimbo,2001-05-15 17:00:00,223,how many miles is 502? I'm going up on June 8th. Staying in Hudson.Thanks jimbo
512546,Guest,2001-05-15 17:24:00,0,"Jimbo,Highway 502 from the turnoff on highway 11 going north to the turn off just before you go into Dryden is approximately 120 kilometers (75 miles) long. A reasonable amount of time to cover 502 would be about two hours. Good luck on your trip and good luck fishing.Remember to keep your eyes open and your feet dry."
