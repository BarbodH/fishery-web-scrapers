1408590,wallydave,2012-03-18 18:35:00,2151,"We had a below average snow fall in Cen. Il. this winter, we didn't even get below zero this winter. Last winter we were way over the average, but maybe that why they call them ""averages""??!! Low water levels will call for caution and adapting to the condidtions, but that what fishing is about."
1409103,Skywagon,2012-03-20 05:31:00,1106,"You gotta give him a break Tackleman, the only ice they see in TN is what is in the bottom of a glass of Scotch. Most of the water that mysteriously disappeared, is now below the ice, our snow is about gone in the bush already and I don't think the lake levels will change as much as we would like. Connie, you might as well head up a couple of weeks early, there will be open water."
1409122,Golden Eagle,2012-03-20 06:38:00,2642,"I typed a long response, but deleted it. No way for me to win this one.I'll be on Little Vermilion May 12 for a 14 day stay."
1409190,Skywagon,2012-03-20 09:11:00,1106,"You are too easy today Connie. With the summer-like temps, I may do the round trip and beat you back up here for opener this year (I hope)."
1409510,TroyMansfield,2012-03-20 21:01:00,92,"unless it rains alot, we are going to experience real low waters this spring in Sioux Lookout area, I was at the boat launch on Sturgeon river today checking out the flow and the water level and I have never seen the water this low I think in my life. hope it starts raining soon"
1410190,rpieske,2012-03-22 14:28:00,1276,"Here is a link to the Lake of the Woods Water Control Board website. It lists water levels for many lakes in the region, including LOTW. Not only can you get current information, but also historical graphs going back many, many years. The water level is currently less than a foot below last year at this time. No one knows what rains will come this spring......never forget 2002! Here is the link:http://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html"
1408250,Cash,2012-03-17 15:55:00,73,I was at Pickerel Arm Camp in Sept. and the water was as low as I had ever seen. Did you get enough snow up there to get the lakes back to near normal levels?
1408252,BenBeattie,2012-03-17 16:23:00,232,no. water will be very low after ice out and I'd be surprised if they reach 'normal' level all season. it will come up but how much depends on how much rain the region gets.
1408296,Outfitter17,2012-03-17 20:05:00,127,"Our lake has a spillway, but we were about 2' below the overflow last fall when we left camp in Nov. I am guessing with the limited snow we got this past winter we are going to be in some real trouble with our water levels. With the frost already leaving the ground a lot of the rain we get will just be absorbed into the ground and not run off into the lake. It really will only be the real heavy rainfalls that will make good run off this spring."
1408326,Gunner_Fletch,2012-03-17 21:36:00,74,LOTW water level is the lowest I've seen it in a LONG time. Won't be going up anytime soon either.
1408331,ManitouBass,2012-03-17 21:53:00,201,"Rainy has been low for 8 months, and no sign of rising. We need rain, and lots of it."
1408332,Golden Eagle,2012-03-17 21:58:00,2642,Where is the missing water?
1408411,Cash,2012-03-18 08:02:00,73,What effect do these low water levels have on the fishing on lakes like Minnetaki and Lac Suel? What changes should be made for walleyes and northerns. One of my favorite methods of fishing for northerns is simply casting to weed beds. When I was up there in Sept '11 there were no weed beds. Will that be the case June 16-23?
1408467,ManitouBass,2012-03-18 10:56:00,201,"lol, this is what happens when we have a lack of snow/rain. The main waterways don't get much runoff, and the lakes connected to the run off don't get the water they normally would. So far the fishing doesn't seem too affected. I'm still findin shallow male walleye, and the odd female already. I'd still like to see the water go up a couple feet though"
1408546,tackleman,2012-03-18 16:24:00,444,"where's the missing water?good question Connie,.we had a lot of water on the ice here 2 days ago, now it's gone too.any ideas Connie as to where it went?"
1408557,Golden Eagle,2012-03-18 17:02:00,2642,"Yep, it evaporated, went to the sky and then on to Quebec. Or wherever the wind took it."
