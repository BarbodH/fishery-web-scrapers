1409759,JayM5209,2012-03-21 14:55:00,1050,"Honestly, I don't know what the fish catching percentages are for the two types of blades. In the early years when I started tying these rigs I only used Indiana blades. I think it just morphed into a personal preference. I know some folks prefer one kind over the other depending on the speed they're moving or the kind of cover they're fishing. Your question may just be the cause of some experimenting and record keeping this summer!Thanks very much for this link! They have exactly the blades I'm looking for. I tried all my catalogs and online sources and could not find them. Thanks again."
1409953,Illinois AG,2012-03-22 06:30:00,6,"KB and I were talking - glad I posted this thread! I am also glad the conversation shifted a bit to color and style. Choosing color is like walking a minefield! Still, there is a reason most of us have multiple tackle boxes full of every color known to man. I have this discussion with KB all the time and tell him to look away from the shiney objects!I agree with JM here. I like the metalic blades - specifically hammered bronze, copper and silver. I am surprised no one mentioned Daredevil Red/white. truth: The last two years up there, it was crazy. we would catch like crazy - slower the better - on the hammered copper, then it would slow down to a trickle. we would switch to daredevil and BAM - it would pick back up.Finally a comment for my bottom bouncing freind: We experimented with a simple jighead versus spinners. structure and wind direction were crucial here. Pulling down a ridge into wind, jighead and minnow wins. opposite direction with the wind - spinners hands down."
1409313,Guest,2012-03-20 14:22:00,0,"I began making my own spinners when fishing Lake Erie and now do the same with Minnesota and Canada. I try to keep things simple. For me, the blade size has nothing to do with the size of the fish but rather how slow I need to move while still keeping the blade off the bottom. The bigger blade the slower I can go. Smaller blade the faster I can go. I feel I can never go wrong with hammered gold but of course use quick clevises that allow for quick change. I simply buy regular blades and then buy various neon adhesive sticker material 3"" x 5"" instead of all the prepainted holographic stuff. My colors / stickers will be gold, yellow, orange, chartreuse etc.... Fish are just not that smart to overcomplicate things."
1409420,adempsey,2012-03-20 18:44:00,963,"For inland lakes, I'd say size 4 Colorado blades with size 4 or 2 hooks is fairly common. What is your current harness setup? Double willow blades?"
1409437,ILScott,2012-03-20 19:08:00,139,I make my spinner rigs with #4 spinner at about 3 or 4 foot long. I use firewire and a #1 Aberdeen hook. I fish the weed lines and rip my line through the weeds. If I get hung up the hook will bend first plus with the longer hook it is easier to hook the minnows. I use mainly hammered gold and silver spinners.Scott
1409493,Baitslinger,2012-03-20 20:28:00,93,"I've also had good luck with the Canadian Klass brand spinners, and I normally buy them from our lodge when we visit. They have heavy 30# line, but seem to work great and are very durable with the heavy line and hooks.I like to tie my own however, but have not been able to find the hook they use. Its a standard bronze, offset, long shank with a turned down eye, size 1. The Klass website says they use Eagle Claw hooks, but I can't find the right hook, even checking on the eagle claw website.Any ideas what hook model it might be, or some good websites for lure supplies? I've looked at Netcraft and others I could find on the web.Thanks-- time to get tying up a batch of spinners------"
1409497,Steve of Madison,2012-03-20 20:36:00,230,"I have been tying my own for about 10 years now. 12-14# mono or floro, 5mm various colored beads, interchangeable clevis, and for minnow rigs I have found that the heavy wire #2 red Tru turn hooks work really well. Believe it or not they hook in the corner of the mouth every time, and you know its been a good day when the red has worn off. For leech or worm rigs I use an octopus #2.BTW, the bend in the tru turn works just like the ""new"" slow death hooks. I guess the tru turn people just don't know how to market thier product to catch the fishermen."
1409503,Guest,2012-03-20 20:47:00,0,"Our group goes to Lac Suel every June and we fish crawler harnesses in Sawmill Bay. Last year I revealed some ""secret lures"" I purchased from Big Eye Custom Lures. When I received them in the mail I had little hope because I thought the size of the blade was way too big. I put one on a couple days into the trip and I could hear snickers in the background. What happened next is the stuff of legend.....well maybe not. Tony the Tiger lasted about 15 seconds until I got snagged and lost it. I then put Pink Flamingo on and stuck the big fish of the trip to that point...a plump 26 incher. These spinners were the most effective of any on the trip last year and there are lots of cool colors. Check them out. The other must have lure was a #7 Rapala shallow diver in the hot steel color. This was unbelievably productive and hit the big fish of the trip......a 28 incher. Good luck to all."
1409635,KevinSB,2012-03-21 10:41:00,73,"Thanks ManitouBass and others for the very helpful replies. We'll tie up a bunch, experimenting a little with size and other variables, and post if we notice any observable trends. Thanks again WC friends."
1409662,ManitouBass,2012-03-21 11:36:00,201,"No problem, my pleasure. If anything else comes up, feel free to ask."
1409665,JayM5209,2012-03-21 11:39:00,1050,"Kevin, you've gotten lots of good advice in response to your query. I've been tying spinner rigs for my group's Canada trips for 30 years. Here's my experience -All are tied with Trilene 12# XT, 30""-36"" in length.I add five red beads, occasionally mixing in one white, silver, or brass one just to keep from getting bored.I always use a #2 hook. Don't have the model number, but it's usually an Eagle Claw bait holder. I use crawlers 95% of the time and prefer the bait holder hook, but it works fine with minnows, too.Over the years five different blades have consistently caught most of the fish, so now that's all I tie and carry with me. They are all #4 Indiana (75%) or #4 Colorado (25%) blades in these patterns: silver (smooth and hammered), gold/brass (smooth and hammered), and something chartreuse with red or orange. For the latter one my preference is a chartreuse blade with red or orange 5 of diamonds, but in the past two years I have not been able to find this specific blade anywhere. 90% of the time we fish them with a plastic tail. Color of the plastic varies from day to day and lake to lake so I always have a dozen or more colors of 3"" grubs along.Just a personal opinion . . . all the fancy custom paint jobs, holographic images, etc., on blades hook fishermen but contribute little to nothing in catching fish. Save your money. And, I just can't bring myself to toss away the cost of pre-tied spinner rigs when it's fun to do my own at about 1/4 or 1/3 the cost. As stated . . . . just my opinion.Have fun tying and catching!!"
1409691,adempsey,2012-03-21 12:36:00,963,"Does that mean 75% of your fish are from Indiana blades? I rarely use Indiana blades, so was wondering if I should tie some up. Quote: Originally Posted by JayM5209For the latter one my preference is a chartreuse blade with red or orange 5 of diamonds, but in the past two years I have not been able to find this specific blade anywhere.The online store I order components from, Luremaking.com, has these blades in their catalogue. It's a Canadian store though, so not sure if it's worth your trouble or not."
1409266,Illinois AG,2012-03-20 12:15:00,6,"A group of us have been going to Lake Wabaskang for a few years and one of our ""fish-nerdy"" efforts has been to tie up spinners on the 16 hour drive. Spinners up there have worked fantastic every year. Problem is, the spinners we have been tying definately do not emulate the ones we buy while up their in Canada. The ones we get there fave significantly larger spinners, hooks and lines. I am looking for an example of the appropriate size. So - here is the question - anyone know the right size? or the name of a store (don't say Cabella's or Bass Pro yet cause I don't know which size yet) up there in Canada that I could call to see if they wil mail me one?"
1409270,wallydave,2012-03-20 12:24:00,2151,"I was watching a North American fishing show over the weekend. They were fishing spinner rigs, according to them, early season you fish smaller blades for smaller fish, later in the season, you move to a bigger blade for bigger fish. Small bait, small fish, big bait, big fish!In the past we have been able to fish jigs in areas, where rivers flow into the lake for walleye. This year we are going up a few weeks later in the season. Along with what seems to be a early ice out and later in the year, we have been gearing up with spinners and worm harnesses for eyes in deeper water."
1409286,Larry S,2012-03-20 13:08:00,665,"We have fished spinners for 40 yrs. Get the clevis that you can exchange blades. We try different sizes until we determine what size works. Many times the larger blades will catch the bigger fish,although the smaller blades typically catch more of all sizes. We also experiment with colors,speed,depths.We also tie the spinners with different color beads and hook sizes. At times we troll until we fine large concentrations of walleyes,then we stop and jig.We experiment until we find what works"
1409287,Illinois AG,2012-03-20 13:08:00,6,Thanks Dave. So I guess my question is what size line hook and spinner are your bigger spinners made of?
1409288,worthsr,2012-03-20 13:08:00,52,"The place I buy my spinners from has a website and lists the different sizes they use. Check out Klass Tackle dot com. The spinners they make with the steel line work great for our shallow trolling in Lac Seul. Best regards, Scott"
1409289,ManitouBass,2012-03-20 13:13:00,201,"#2 hooks, #2-#3 colorado blades, and 14-20 lb fluoro is the standard around NW Ontario. Beads are usually 4-6mmand yes, get some quick change clevises for quick blade changes. Saves alot of time when your tinkering with spinner presentations"
1409291,Illinois AG,2012-03-20 13:19:00,6,PERFECT! thanks
1409296,KevinSB,2012-03-20 13:26:00,73,"I'm the guy who ties up spinners on the drive with Illinois AG and also appreciate the help. As reference, I usually use #3-4 Colorado blades, 5mm beads (usually glass faceted) and 14# mono (XT). Don't remember hook size offhand. Our spinners usually look smaller than others we see - maybe we just have spinner envy. So I'll ask another question: what style hooks do you like? Thanks!"
1409303,ManitouBass,2012-03-20 13:44:00,201,"I like Matzuo Red/nickle sickle hooks, and Mustad #2 octopus hooks. And the line your using will work great (just don't get the abrasion resistance of fluoro)"
1409305,wallydave,2012-03-20 13:50:00,2151,"I bought some Northlands spinners and wormharnesses during their recent sale, different sizes and colors. We fished stained waters, so gold was my choice. We will see what works in June!"
