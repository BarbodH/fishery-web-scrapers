1410428,osuangler,2012-03-23 06:36:00,10,I am taking my kids to Dog Lake for a week of fishing and am looking for tips on fish locations and tactics. We will be checking in on May 27 at the Northen Walleye Lodge (AKA Camp Missanabie). We are coming from Ohio and I promise to provide a full debrief afterwards......Many thanks

I mention this because I have been to Dog Lake in June and fished it this way.Drifting crawler harness in 6 to 15 foot of water. Also, used Lindy rigs when I marked fish without too much bite. Concentrate on the wind blown points that extend into deep water. Also bays that hold a large area of 10-15 ft depths. If you have a bit of a breeze, start in 15 foot of water and let the wind push into the shallows as you bounce a harness or jig. When you get some bites at a certain depth, anchor there and jig. I have caught walleyes standing on the shore with a slip bobber in 3 foot of water. Most of the bite seems to be very early morn or very late in the day. Chase the pike and smallies during the day.Lenray's comment about the fish sticks scared me a bit back when I was first went to Dog. Lenray is not to fond of the lake as he has mentioned this in earlier posts. I would say Dog performs well for the price. Eaters are abundant at the early and late bites. Hope this helps. PM me if you want more specifics."

Lenray stinks as a fisherman and can only catch them where they are in GREAT abundance--like shooting fish in a tub. Have a great trip.

Ice out was late last year and the May fly hatch was on, and the weather changed frequently. Emily and Core Shack Bays and Rabbit Island were the most popular areas, but there is lots of good structure, everywhere. Bottom bouncers with spinner blades and worms seemed to be the most productive. I would go there again, but due to circumstances it won't be this year.Hope you have a great trip."

Fishing was great for walleye and a little slow on the SM and Pike surpisingly, not a ton of weedbeds in this lake (that we found anyway). Does anyone know where the weeds and pike can be found? we found one decend bed just past Coreshack. TY told you how to catch them, my other tip would be not to run all over the lake looking for fish, it's a huge lake. The fish are right in front of you, no need to waste your day running around. We are headed back in Sept this year. Can't wait."
