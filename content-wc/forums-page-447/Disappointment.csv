1381863,wallydave,2012-01-12 08:07:00,2151,"Hooks, I'm like you, my wife doesn't think I'm very funny either, oh well! Be on the lookout, another Eddie North thread has been started, we will see how this one goes!!"
1397033,Walleye Wanderer,2012-02-20 19:23:00,101,"Hey Dave, I am digging up a map and will mark it up and mail to you. As you head out from the cabin, go to the right and look for the narrows, anchor in the narrows and your arms will get tired of pulling out walleye. Don't forget to throw the Eagle the odd fish while your there. Around the point back towards the cabin is a weeded full of big Pike, this is a nice lake well protected from wind. I hear Remi has fixed up the camp and it is quite nice now. Cheers Rob ps. sorry to disappoint all those bored fishermen looking to have me fire up an Eddie thread"
1397038,HeHooksHimself,2012-02-20 19:35:00,725,But i like your pics

1397399,MSUICEMAN,2012-02-21 17:12:00,458,"a while ago, like 16 years ago, I went to hebner with my father. It was just a tent cabin and very rustic then. Had an unbelievable time. My father is now passed and I would like to get back there sometime. I marked up the crappy map that I had from back then and sent it to Dave a while ago, but that stuff may be outdated. Beautiful area... maybe someday I'll get back."

1359210,phishfearme,2011-10-19 15:04:00,1242,"dave - sounds like your request (s) are going unanswered - have you tried the OFN board? or, ask the outfitter for names of people who've been there around the same time of year as you plan to go. phish"
1359668,wallydave,2011-10-21 10:32:00,2151,"I tried the search funtion, not to much going on here about Hebner. Good luck and let us know how your trip went!"
1362164,Hayduke,2011-11-01 20:06:00,11,I fished Hebner two years ago when it opened. It was a great lake and I plan to go back in a couple years when my son is ready for a fly-in. Ill send you an email.
1380490,Walleye Wanderer,2012-01-08 17:49:00,101,"Are you finally going to Hebner Dave? I didn't hear anything about your 2011 trip, did you go back to Melchett? I went to Beteau with Eddie North but had a nice chat with Remi on the dock at the base before we left, I think we will return to Hebner in 2013. If you need info about Hebner let me know and I search for my map, pics and the trip report from when we went. Cheers Rob"
1381211,HeHooksHimself,2012-01-10 14:08:00,725,Someone who went with Eddie North and is going elsewhere next year? Really?
1381221,wallydave,2012-01-10 14:21:00,2151,"Come on man, don't start this up again!"
1381447,HeHooksHimself,2012-01-11 07:20:00,725,You can tell the guys who keep up with WC regularly! Once again my attempt at humor falls short!
1381465,wallydave,2012-01-11 07:46:00,2151,"Hooks, I guess you want to see if anyone is ""out here"" during the slow season! The natives are getting restless! It can be slightly humorus when threads take off in a wild direction, we can hang on and see where the ride takes us! At the end of the day I hope we can share some fun, as well as fishing tips!"
1381762,HeHooksHimself,2012-01-11 19:34:00,725,I just watched my DVR of The Next Bite and bouncing around WC while I count down the next 127 days until I leave for fishing. I don't mind stirring up a little humor (my wife would tell you I am not funny) to give me a reason to go to WC. Remember the fun we had with Mushmouth?
