I was just at the Milwaukee show, and someone informed me that at least two of the resorts have recently sold. I don't want to say names, incase they're rumors. But, was interested in seeing if they were actually true. (This doesn't count Todd at Tamarak)"

After some searching, I found some confirmation on one of the rumors I'd heard. Someone at the show told me Black Island had indeed sold. http://www.borderlandrealty.com/list...ail.php?id=133"
