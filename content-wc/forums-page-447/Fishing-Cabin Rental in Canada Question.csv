No group, just my grandson and I. I'm looking for a cabin, drive to or fly/boat in. I'll take my own boat if it's a drive to location. Trophy fish is not the goal, just good numbers of walleye, perch, pike, or smallmouth bass. I live in Michigan so a location within 250km or so from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario or would be great. If anyone has any places they could recomend it would be much appreciated. Thanks."

1409737,gapwedge,2012-03-21 14:00:00,19,"Nanuk, can you or anyone else please expand upon the fishing at Ellen Island Camp ... or any of the other spots mentioned in this thread. I've been reading the posts on this site for about a year now and very little information is posted about places east of Lake Superior. I've checked out the websites that you folks have been nice enough to link, but a lodge's website certainly does not tell the whole story.Thanks as always."

We have gone there several times. You can pick the number of days you want, not the standard saturday to saturday. It is more expensive, around $1,000 per person just for the camp, for 4 days. I would get a guide. They do everything. I spend the summers in Canada fishing over in the NW part of Ontario and I still go on the trip to ""Kaby"" with a group. Would be glad to tell you more, if you want to contact me. I really believe this is one of the best ways to introduce your grandson to canada fishing."
