They tell me that I would probably really like Kag, as their new camp is located on the west side of Kag near Humble Bay, which offers privacy away from the Lodge on the east side of Kag. We have fished Abamasagi, Jessiman, Melchett and Kapitawanga Lakes in the past and have been very happy with the fishing. Can anyone offer any advice about Kag?"
1380596,TIGHTLINER,2012-01-09 03:25:00,223,I have fished kag 4 times over the past 15 years. It is a large body of water and get very rough in a matter of minutes. Fishing is good there. From where you are staying to the right is a place where we call it three rivers very good for np with some being trophy size. Glad to see twin lakes take it over not sure if they bought it or just running it for corky. I think i still have a marked map of kag if you pm me we can talk further and i can send you a copy of it.

1381028,Guest,2012-01-10 06:36:00,0,"Thanks all for the replies. Tightliner, I believe Chad was telling me about that area, is it to the west of camp? He has been talking to some of the old guests and getting a bit of information. I understand there are some nice weed beds up in Humble Bay with some good drop offs. It sounds like no matter how windy, you can always fish Humble Bay.We are planning the second week of August and will be looking for some big northerns. We still want to eat walleye every night though. Corvette 1, I believe you will be very happy at Abamasagi. Bill Ferring(previous owner), once told us there are so many fish in Abamasagi, that you have to hide behind a tree to bait your hook. I must say though, it has a fantastic fishery. It is not unusual for one boat to pull up a hundred walleye in one day. There are some great sunken weed beds for trophy pike as well. Every year we went back, we would find new spots for big pike. It is a big lake, but there is always an area to get out of the wind. The walleye are simply everywhere in that lake. Any more info on Kag, we are really looking forward to our trip this year."

1410309,dog2,2012-03-22 19:39:00,198,"great lake you chose.fished it for 20 years.from the opening week of the season thru the third week in July. You have lake trout to the north walleye every where else. This is a clear lake visual depth at places 20 feet. If it happens the may flys are hatching find the mud flats and long line troll rapalas in flo gold ,gold and black,with an inline sinker1/4 to 1/2 oz. when the wind kicks up hit the shore line or front edge of the many weed beds.The walleyes avged 3--4# the northerns here are a great resource handle with care .My personal best was 49 1/2in several 38 to 46 one of our guys hit a 50 in between him and his brother they had 4 over 40 in .in one afternoon. the wind comes mainly from the west,so if you go south of the cabin you should get some relief from it, we where blown off of it a couple times for an afternoon.or two. jigs orange,chart. motor oil twistertails .goodluck enjoy the sunsets they are awesome!"
