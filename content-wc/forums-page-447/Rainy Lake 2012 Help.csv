I was thinking about June or July. Would love feedback on when the best time to go up is? I will be on the Canadian side of the lake. We plan to fish for everything Walleye's, Crappie's, Bass, Northern's. Any lure/bait suggestions or presentations would also be very welcome. When on home waters we currently fish with jigs 90% of the time with live bait. But we have used plastic and crankbaits. So if there is a suggestion on a type of plastic(Size/Color) or crankbaits you wouldnt be without please share"

We mainly targeted walleye but frequently got into some great smallmouth also. We were using mainly jigs, any color and half a crawler. Had some good spinner/bottom bouncer action too. Good quality bass and walleye."
