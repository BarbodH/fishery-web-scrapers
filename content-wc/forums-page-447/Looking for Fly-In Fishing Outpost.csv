1409873,[email protected],2012-03-21 20:27:00,21,"Not sure what time of year you want, but I would suggest end of July or early August. If you want a great fishing trip and keep the cost down I would look at Park's Fly-in Fishing. I have used a number of outfitters on fly in camps over the years, and a expensive lodge a couple of times. If you want a really nice cabin and good walleye fishing go to Abbey Lake, good for party of two or four people. The other one would be Ribes Lake. Great walleye and northern pike, but cabin is poor and best for two people. Four can do it but crowded. My favorite for fish. Martin and Jennifer Wearn run these camps. They use Hawk Air Flight Service out of Hawk Lake, Ontario. Another one I really like, but more expensive is Canadian Air Ventures which does his own flying out of Chapleau, Ontario. Lynx Outpost (River fishing, not lake) very good walleye and small pike. Hope this helps. Tom[email protected]"
1409876,[email protected],2012-03-21 20:34:00,21,"Not sure when you are going. I prefer end of July or early August. Check out Park's Fly-in Fishing. Very nice four person cabin and good walleye fishing on Abbey Lake. Small poor cabin on Ribes Lake but excellent walleye and northern pike fishing, best for two unless extra two are kids. Martin & Jennifer Wearn (owners) use Hawk Air Float Plane Service out of Hawk Junction, Ontario. Park's has very good rates and excellent Mercury 4 stroke 8 hp motors. Also, Canadian Air Ventures. Excellent Cabin on Lynx River (no lake fishing here) for four people, with good walleye and some small northern pike, more expensive than Park's Fly-in Fishing. Dennis does his own flying. I have done all three of these multiple times. Hope this helps. Tom[email protected]"

Where have you been? and how did you like it?[/quote] I have fished Ontario since 1951 Lots of different places....Best by far is Bull Moose Camp...Super facilities and the owner & wife are on site. Youcan fish Upper Goose Lake---Mamakwash lake with a beautiful 4 1/2 mileriver between them....I am scheduled for three trips 2012. Have taken grandchildren---sons---daughters---wife and they all loved the place. Took a brother in law two years ago and he hadn't fished for years he caught (3) 30+"" walleyes....Of course we caught lots of smaller fish but a rookie took those three huge trophies in one wk...WOW Costs are reasonable about a 40 min flight from Red Lake. itsme"
1411027,pike50plus,2012-03-24 16:10:00,584,www.bushlandadventures.com great pike and very good walleye fising
1411033,pike50plus,2012-03-24 16:23:00,584,"Solo and I have both fished Anjigamin, great trips."
1411484,itsme,2012-03-25 17:19:00,31,Best housekeeping north of Red Lake..Been there done that
1407946,Larry S,2012-03-16 15:13:00,665,"klgladhill,First how far are you willing to travel? I see that you are from Maryland. Do you want a do it yourself camp?(You are on your own and do your own cooking),or an American Plan where everything is done for you .How much are you willing to pay? What other kinds of fish do you want to fish for,I take it you want to fish walleye being that this is walleye central Tell us this info and you will get a very informed answer to help you make a deceision from all the great fishermen on this site"
1408135,octanehi5,2012-03-17 07:16:00,1104,"I have been fishing with Air Tamarac for 6 yrs now, there main walleye factory is at lake Hebert,and also have camps on the Gouin.Lake Hebert is one of the best or the best lake for walleye that I have ever fished. I have fished with many outfitters at differant lakes over the past 30 yrs. This is a fly to only lake, you bring and cook your own food,great boats 16' lunds with 20 hp motors,camps are very nice always up grading.If I am not catching 150-200 walleyes in a day in aboat with two guys in it. we are having a bad day!! Check them out"
1408665,klgladhill,2012-03-18 21:37:00,12,"Larry, I'm not sure yet. I have been doing an American Plan for the last 5 years so a change would be nice. Money is not a deciding factor. Walleye is the primary target and traveling anywhere in Ontario or Quebec.Thanks for everyones input. I'll be busy for the next few months researching all of this information."
1409071,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-03-19 22:05:00,235,"Do you have a group to go with? If so, how large? You will need to know that when selecting an outpost cabin. I love the do it yourself outpost experience. Pure solitude. If that's what you're going for, then I would recommend: -Find an outpost that is the only cabin on the lake. Avoid outposts where there are nearby cabins and/or a maintenance guy who lives out there for the season. Look on Google maps to see how close you are to roads. -If it's a multi species lake, do lots of research to verify the fish you seek is prominent. Call references and ask questions about specific lakes on this site and others. -Ontario had serious forest fires last year. Find out if the lake you're interested in sustained heavy damage. The fishing won't be affected most likely, but the wooded shoreline you envision may be dust."
1409149,Pinetree,2012-03-20 07:54:00,5,Try Uchi Lake Lodge in Sioux Lookout. Their packages are very flexible and service unbelievable. The fishing is out of this world - fished it five years now and will never go elsewhere. Good luck.
1409282,Mohleye,2012-03-20 13:04:00,368,"Pinetree, I'm a little confused. Your original post on the Uchi Lake thread makes it sound like you are the owner. Now you sound like a satisfied customer. Could you clarify?"
1409471,Walleye Wanderer,2012-03-20 19:56:00,101,"Geeez Mike, with all the trips you've taken can't you suggest an alternative to Eddie's lol BTW I may have a empty seat on the June 2nd flight?, just waiting for one guy to confirm. Rob"
1409474,Walleye Wanderer,2012-03-20 20:02:00,101,"There are several good outfitters in the Nakina area, Eddie North, Arctic Watershed Outposts, Leuenbergers to name a few. I don't have enough experience in Quebec to comment but there are reported to be some good outfitters in the Gouin Reservoir area."
1409528,Mike Borger,2012-03-20 21:55:00,1554,"I'm flying into the Dusey Lake outpost June 2-9 with 7 Lakes in Nakina this year Rob, just booked it last week.Will you guys be staying at John and Karen's Fri night? If so I'll see you there."
1409729,fshfktry,2012-03-21 13:47:00,6,Check with Canada Outfitters. They are out of Kenorahttp://www.canadaoutfitters.com

1407595,NARDA 1,2012-03-15 18:41:00,636,Check out Wilderness Air at www.great-fishing.com . While I have never stayed at one of there outposts I have done several daily flyouts with them. Bob and his daughter Kelsey run a great operation.
1407602,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-03-15 18:58:00,235,"Www.Kabeelo.com Located near Ear Falls, ON. Fished there 9 of last 12 years. Have fished Bertha, Wakeman, Jeannette and Okanse. Jeannette is probably my favorite, though Okanse was fantastic this year for us. Harald and Ann will take good care of you. Lakes are all walleye and northern primarily. His outpost plan includes food, but you can bring your own grub too. All outposts have showers, hot and cold water, solar powered lights, a fridge."
1407606,HeHooksHimself,2012-03-15 19:19:00,725,"Never been, but I am quite sure Eddie's North is the cream of the crop. It is on my bucket list."
1407649,SinOrSwim,2012-03-15 20:33:00,1528,"Slate Falls Outposts or Red Pine Lodge. Both out of Sioux Lookout. Was all the same until a couple years ago when Slate Falls sold half of the cabins. We had been going to Gull Lake through them for years and years. Cabins are nice, boats with swivel seats, propane appliances, indoor toilet and shower and the boats are in slips vs pulled onto shore. All the equip was always in great condition.Also, they never gave us weight limits. As long as we were willing for some stuff to be flown in later. Beer, pop, water etc. We fish for walleye and our largest fish the last several years was always anywhere from 27, 28"" up to one year with a 30"". Many many fish from the 23 to 26 inch range as well!!!!"
1407708,GOBIG,2012-03-16 04:47:00,126,"I would highly recommend you call Eddie at www.eddienorth.com. His camp on the river system is the best I have ever fished. Not only will you catch a lot of walleye, you should catch some big ones. We caught 3 over 32 inches last year. As for the pike, 4 guys caught and landed 12 over 40 inches, with many more hook ups. We also caught a lot of 35 inch pike. All the boats ran without any issues. Everything worked well in camp. The cabins I hear have some new features coming, with 24 hr power to the whole camp. You can even call home if you want to. I will be happy to give more details by phone, send me a PM. We are already booked for this year and next. Eddie is also in camp with you, give him a try. He is the best I have come across."
1407733,TIGHTLINER,2012-03-16 06:27:00,223,I WOULD TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT WWW.EDDIENORTH.COM FOR A FLY IN. I SPENT A WEEK WITH EDDIE LAST YEAR ON THE RIVER SYSTEM AND CAUGHT MY PB WALLEYE AND PIKE WITH HIM. VERY WELL RUN CAMP EDDIE HIMSELF IS IN CAMP. BOATS MOTORS CABINS ALL GOOD. THE FISHING IS SOME OF THE BEST YOU ARE GOING TO FIND IN ONTARIO. LOTS OF POSTS ON EDDIES ON WC SO DO A SEARCH. LOOK FOR THE POSTS FROM SOLOPADDLER AND WALLEYEWANDERS SOME OF THE BEST I HAVE READ ON WC. VERY WELL RUN CAMP AND EDDIE HIMSELF IS JUST GREAT. I WAS BOOKED FOR 2012 HOWEVER HAD TO CANCEL BECAUSE OF FAMILY ISSUES HOWEVER I AM ALREADY BOOKED FOR 2013. GIVE HIM A CALL YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.
1407773,deputy dog,2012-03-16 08:27:00,305,"Eddie x2, definately lives up to the hype!"
1407875,Mike Borger,2012-03-16 12:13:00,1554,"Eddie is great for sure, problem is getting a booking!I spoke to him recently and he had one week wide open in mid July of this year.I would have taken it myself but it didn't jive with my shedule."
1407882,Pikeslayer8,2012-03-16 12:31:00,1460,Check with Northern Wilderness Outfitters. Many lakes to chose from to fit your needs. Moose Point Lodge on Shikag is amazing. http://www.northernwilderness.net/
