1409382,Obabikon,2012-03-20 17:22:00,2370,"Lake of the Woods... April 1st. It'll be by far the earliest on record, unless the weather turns cold in a hurry."
1409464,Moondog,2012-03-20 19:47:00,362,"Obabikon, What do you think will be the ramifications of early ice out on LOTW??? I guess I could answer my own question if the warm weather stays. Just curious as to what you think."
1409494,Obabikon,2012-03-20 20:29:00,2370,"Early spawns for the Pike, walleye, and crappie. (muskie's spawn is more related to daylight hours than water temp) Could be looking at mid summer patterns by June 1st. For the most part, I don't think the ice coming off the lake is what will make the big difference. More warm weather will mean warmer water temps in mid summer. So, I'll just say that the ice coming off has much less to do with fishing than the rest of the weather will have. (May, June, July) We need rain, we need stable weather (no major cold fronts), and it wouldn't hurt if the thunder storms left us alone."
