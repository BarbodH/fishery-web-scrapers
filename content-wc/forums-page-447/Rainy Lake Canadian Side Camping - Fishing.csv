Would be during the last week of June. I have my own boat.Anyone have recommendations for campgrounds, either MNR or privately operated? Could either tent camp or buy a topper for the truck and sleep in it. Am looking for something on the west shore of the Canadian side so I don't have to drive all the way around to the east shore. Any information about camping possibilities or the fishing would be greatly appreciated. Will be alone for that leg of the trip so if anyone wants to gang up or is going to be in the area, that would be nice to know too.BTW, as it does with LOTW because it carries over from the US, I'm assuming my Navionics map chip will also pick up all of Rainy Lake too, yes? TIA guys.Oh yeah......... GO PACK GO !!! Bring #4 (trophy, not the soap opera character) back home to Curly and Vince."
