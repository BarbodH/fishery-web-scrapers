1405299,Guest,2012-03-10 17:17:00,0,Looking for a good 1 day fly in for walleye and trophy northern. Up to six guys want to leave from the morson ont. area. Will be up there in june for a week and want to try a fly in.
1407240,Guest,2012-03-14 23:45:00,0,"You could fly into Arrow Lake. Great walleye, Smallmouth and pike fishing. Not sure about trophy Pike though. We also offer day trips to hike in lake. it is about a 45 minute hike and the fishing is awesome. Maybe 3 groups go in a year over the past 10 years."
1407621,Guest,2012-03-15 19:42:00,0,thanks for the reply. what is the cost for 3 and for 6 people? You can pm if you like.
1408672,Tamarack,2012-03-18 23:06:00,16,"The cost is around $225.00 per person to fly in/out of Arrow. There is no additional charge to hike into the backwater Lake, if you stay with us."
