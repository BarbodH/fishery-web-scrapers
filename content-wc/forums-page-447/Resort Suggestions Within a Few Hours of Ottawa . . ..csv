We would need a cabin/cottage and would prefer a location that is fairly quiet and out of the way. We'll have our own boat and the main purpose will be just to get away and do some fishing and relaxing. We're not on a quest for trophy fish or anything like that for this trip, but it would be nice to get into some consistent action. I don't even really care what species as just getting away to a quiet spot is the big thing. I have no problem heading over to Quebec or even down into the States as well if you have ideas in those areas. We're new to the entire area and I'm just not sure where to start so any suggestions you may have would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

I grew up in that area and now live in Alberta, we are renting a cottage on Bennet lake for three months this summer. Good walleye fishing there, pike lake, sand lake in Plevna is pretty good too. Mississippi lake has god fishing there but can get busy at times. Good luck in your search and maybe we will see you on the water"

I've been going there for 35 years now and wouldn't miss a season. Nice folks, quiet atmosphere, activities for the family, beach, boat docks, etec. Do a Google search and check them out."

There are lots of cottages but not that many folks there during the week. I can recommend a very nice cottage if you are interested. Another thing i used to do was stay in suburban Ottawa and drive to Constance lake Lodge, lots of small northerns + an occasional large one. i would guess there should be good fishing on the Ottawa River, don't know firsthand."

Yes RSH8, if you could PM about the cottage that would be great. I do plan on fishing the Ottawa River quite a bit this year but that will mostly be day trips I imagine. From everything I've read it is a very good fishery for all sorts of species. I had a good time chasing Muskies there last year."
