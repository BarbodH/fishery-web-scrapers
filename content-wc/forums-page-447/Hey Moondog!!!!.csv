So I will probably have the big boys out of there before you arrive, the snow is almost totally gone and the temperatures are in the mid 70s in your temp scale.just thought i'd start you to get anxious for the season."
1408987,Moondog,2012-03-19 18:47:00,362,"Anxious??? Are you kidding me? Only 55 days until we leave. Yeah, I was thinking about early ice out and no big northerns lurking off the docks. You better send pictures. I am concerned about the water levels etc. With all the snow gone what do you think? The fishing is different every year and I am sure we will be able to adapt to whatever."

Headed up in June but we may be fishing ""mid summer"" eyes Oh well guess its a good time either way and will probably learn alot more areas!!!"
1409521,tackleman,2012-03-20 21:26:00,444,"mid summer eyes are good to eat anytime of the year.I'll probably see you on the dock in June when i get my minnows.have a good trip up, i'll keep a few fish in the lake for you."
1409555,jkwildhunting,2012-03-21 05:14:00,361,"Early ice our or not....I am pumped to get on the water up there even if the fishing is ""slow"". Just being up there is all the fun!Sounds like we better hope you guys have a pretty wet april or even may otherwise you guys will be in the same situation as last year with alot of fires. BRING ON THE RAIN!"
