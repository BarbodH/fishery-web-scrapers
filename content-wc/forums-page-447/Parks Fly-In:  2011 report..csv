This was my son's first trip to the great outdoors, and it was an experience for both of us to say the least. We drove into Wawa the day before, picked up Crawlers, beverages, and fishing licenses and called it a day. We left for Hawks Landing at 0900 after a quick breakfast, and were soon loading the Plane with all of our gear. Once we landed the pilot went through the basic layout of the cabin, boats, water, generator, and the propane system and we were left to put away our things and try our first evening on the water. We were on Anjigaming Lake and we ended up catching enough fish for our meal while we drove around the lake, getting the lay of the land.I've never had much success fishing with jigs in the 6 or7 trips I've taken to Canada .but we did manage to land some small Eyes using jigs, trolling hard baits, but we had our greatest success using 2 hook crawler harnesses in bright colors. Our trip in 2011 was the second week in July, we managed to catch 20-30 fish per session .(morning/evening). I'm heading back there again this year with a couple of the guys I work with in Iraq/Afghanistan and if any of you have any tips you think we should try (especially with Jigs) please PM me and give me your thoughts."

I personally had a great trip there too!Surprised at your lack of success jigging though, we caught a large number of ours jigging.Generally I'll prospect for fish trolling with worm harnesses and bouncers, and once the fish are found I'll sit on them with jigs.I just find it's more fun catching them on lighter tackle and casting as oposed to trolling.As fas as Anjigaming goes the water is quite stained so 3"" twister tails in a variety of brighter citrus colors (chartreuse, hot orange, lime green, etc..) were very effective.1/4-3/8oz jig heads depending on the depth, and most importantly tip your jig with half a crawler! If you don't have a piece of ""northern sirloin"" on your jig, you won't catch near as many LOL!If the fish are really concentrated anchoring is productive. Most of the time I drift with the wind though. I always bring a small drift sock along to slow the boat down if it's too windy. At times it's worth its weight in gold and weighs practically nothing. Like on most fly ins though the walleye on Anjigaming are easy to catch and you can fish for them with success any way you like.If anyone else is considering Park's feel free to pm me for info,Cheers"
