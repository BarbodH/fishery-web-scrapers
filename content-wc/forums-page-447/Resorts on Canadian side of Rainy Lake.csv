526856,Guest,2003-01-27 16:57:00,0,"Hey River_eye,Nice of you to question my motives on this website. Actually I'm not affiliated with this camp at all. I experienced the trip of a lifetime there and I know that if other people go there they will have a blast. There are many camps in the area and none compare to that of campfire island. If you want to discuss any other issues you can email me at [email protected], instead of discussing it on a webpage."
526859,Guest,2003-01-28 06:10:00,0,Correction: the name of the waterfalls at the north end of the north arm of Rainy Lake is Devil's Cascade.
526861,Guest,2003-01-28 10:23:00,0,the phone # above on cascade is a fly in outfitterwhats the deal? they dont even fish rainy or have a camp on it
526862,Guest,2003-01-28 10:55:00,0,"In my earlier post I used the phone number listed on the web site for Cascade Camps. Jo Becker may have retired-she was about that age. When I fished the camp 3 years ago, it was either a boat-in ($90 each way, up to 5 people) or fly-in. We boated in. The phone numbers and addresses listed on the brochure at that time were:Winter Oct. 31-May 1)Jo Becker525 So. Sixth StreetStillwater, MN 55082(651)439-5430Summer May 1- Oct. 31)Cascade Camps LtdBox 657Fort Frances, OntarioCanada P9A 3M9(807) 274-9030"
526863,Guest,2003-01-28 11:50:00,0,Our group heads for Cascade Camp the end of May every year. Didn't look to me as if Jo was planning to retire anytime soon as she had some new camp boats last year.
526864,fishinnut,2003-01-28 17:36:00,642,"How far, by water is Cascade Camp from Fort Frances? Where do you leave your vehicles/trailers?"
526865,Stealth,2003-01-28 18:17:00,93,I've never fished Rainy. Is it mostly a walleye amd smallmouth fishery?? How are the muskies and northerns?
526867,Guest,2003-01-28 18:20:00,0,"We put in at the Five Mile Dock and either leave our vehicles/trailers there or at a parking area Jo uses. I don't have a GPS, but I'm guessing it's about 20 miles to camp."

526866,Guest,2003-01-29 06:26:00,0,"Regarding Rainy Lake and Cascade Camps:I don't know about muskies. I don't think Rainy has Lake Trout but there are rumors to the contrary. There is a nice population of good sized crappies. We didn't target crappies while we were there but the group in the neighboring cabin caught some arround dusk in the wild rice near camp. The man who boated us in said the Walleyes were more predominant in the southern part of Rainy while the smallmouth were more predominant in the northern part. We caught a couple Walleye that were in the protected slot range and a few nice northern, a couple that were in the protected slot range-estimated 9 to 10 pounds, and a few about 4+ pounds.Smallmouth Bass were our primary target when we were there. We fish for the most active species.As in many Canadian Lakes there are many rocks to be aware of. Take it easy. I understand a few lower units were ripped off during the Bass Championship that year. Ou boat ride from the Government Docks to the resort and return was pleasant because the weather was nice and the boat operator knew the lake. I don't think I would enjoy a boat ride in high winds in a lake I was unfamiliar with.The Information Centre in Fort Frances will give you directions to the government docks and to a good bait store. Three years ago Cascade Camp had minnows but did not have nightcrawlers orleeches.As I recall we set a time in advance with the camp owner for the boat operator to pick us up. We called the camp again after we crossed into Fort Frances to finalize. You bring your own food and gear and beer to Cascade Camps."
526848,Guest,2003-01-23 20:22:00,0,"Does anyone out there know of a website that lists the resorts on the Canadian side of Rainy Lake. Iv'e been searching the net trying everything I can think of for a search and only come up with a few resorts. There must be a lot more than I'm finding. Have tried the website for Fort Francis Chamber of Commerce, Sunset Country and several others without much luck. Iv'e had no problem finding lots of resorts on the U.S. side but would rather fish from the Canadian side. Can anyone help?"
526849,David/MN,2003-01-23 21:10:00,249,"I know of most of the places on Rainy, both sides. Send me some mail and I will try to help you out....[email protected]dw"
526850,Guest,2003-01-24 05:56:00,0,"A few years ago I obtained a ""1999 Fishing & Vacation Guide Map"". It shows parts of Lake of the Woods, Rainy Lake & Quetico Park, known as the ""Rendezvous Trail Area"" Call 1-800-663-2599"
526851,Walli,2003-01-26 13:08:00,63,I have a private 3 bedroom cottage that I rent out weekly on an island if you are interested [email protected] for info and pics the Rendevous is also a nice place-thanks Walli
526852,Guest,2003-01-26 14:43:00,0,"i'm a full time guide in summer, i can set you up anywhere you need and can save you some money at the sametime. i know the area very well and must tell you about the other lake that are in the area like lake of the woods, crow lake, lower and upper manitou, rainy river, great places. stay a week and have an awesome vacation."
526854,Guest,2003-01-26 19:02:00,0,"I saw your message and thought of a great place for you to go on the canadian side of rainy lake. It's called Campfire Island Lodge. I've been there a few times myself and have always enjoyed the trip. Its a great place and the guides bring you some amazing fishing. Im talking smallmouth heaven!!! Dean and the rest of the guides make sure you catch fish after fish. I've caught many of 4 pound smallies and a few 5's there....the fishing is awesome. YOu should check out there web site www.campfireisland.com, and if you talk to them tell them cooncain send you. Anyway have a great trip fishing rainy lake ...i always do."
526855,River_eye,2003-01-26 19:08:00,1486,"Bassmanjc seems like he is either the owner of the lodge, affiliated with them, or a long time customer looking for the owner to give him a free trip if he rounds up enough customers.You have cut and pasted the exact same reply to a few other people looking for lodges.If the lodge you represent wants advertising he should be paying Walleye central."
526857,Guest,2003-01-27 10:56:00,0,"Taylors Cove 807-481-2526The Fisheries 807-481-2534Coppens Resort ??????????All three of these resorts are nice, well maintained and have good owners. They are on Bear Pass and you will have easy access to Baseline, Red Gut, Swell and Seine Bays. My pick is Tayor's. The downside of the Fisheries is that they are located on a railroad track and the trains will blast you out of bed at night. TGG"
526858,Guest,2003-01-27 13:26:00,0,"http://www.kenoraontario.net/fortfrances.htmAt north end of north arm of Rainy Lake there is a fishing camp known as Cascade Camp. If you look at a map of Rainy Lake you will find Cascade Falls, the camp is within site and the current from the falls. Call 1-807-274-3234 I fished at this older no frills camp 3 years ago just after the Canadian National Bass Tournament. The camp has a clean fish house and maintains the lawn nicely. The cabins are old, have a variety of furniture and appliances. If all you want is functional and a roof over your head, hot and cold running water, flush toilets, propane grill, boat and operable 15 hp outboard at very reasonable daily rate this place may be for you.By the way, it was the best smallmouth fishing I have ever experienced or expect to experience. The best fishing was off our dock. I caught 6 fish on 7 casts. My brothers trading off with each other caught 13 straight. Either small pieces of nightcrawler or a leech on a jig cast into the current is the way to go. Don't get me wrong they didn't bite 24/7 but they were biting more often and not."
526860,Guest,2003-01-27 15:15:00,0,I have stayed at Coppens a couple of times and the fishing was great. No complaints about the cabins or anything. Last year we drove up to The Fisheries to buy some beer and got to look around. Looked like a real nice place. It seemed alot bigger than Coppens but it looked like you would have more choices in cabin sizes. I am going back to coppens this year because of the location more than anything.
