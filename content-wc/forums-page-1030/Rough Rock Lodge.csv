510746,Guest,2001-02-01 09:44:00,0,"On my first trip to Minaki, in September 3 years ago, my buddy hooked a sturgeon on 8 lb test with a 1/4 ounce lead head and minnow. Until it breached like a whale, our guide and we had no idea what it was. It dragged us across the channel in Little Sand, approx 200 or so yards. My buddy fought it for about 2 hrs. It breached twice and appeared to be about 5-6 ft long and weigh perhaps near 100 lbs crudely estimating, with a back width of over a foot it appeared. The guide is Dave, who is a native guide, for those who know him. Eventually, my buddy tightened the drag down, since it was apparent that the sturgeon had not fatigued at all to us, and that it was past time for shore lunch, and so the line was broken. Right before we started fishing the little bay on the west side of Little Sand for walleye, the guide told us that a fisherman had hooked a fish there a year or two previously that broke his rod. It was the first cast into the bay that hooked the sturgeon for my buddy. I can guess what the fish was that broke that fellow's rod the year before. Don"
510747,Guest,2001-02-01 11:34:00,0,"Heard a similar sturgeon story where the brother of the camp owner where we stay on Black Sturgeon Lake hooked one at the mouth of the outlet where Black Sturgeon dumps into the Winnipeg. He marked several large fish on his electronics, dropped his line, hooked something and was drug around for some time before he broke the line. Sounds like they are relatively prevalent in the Winnipeg system!"

510755,Guest,2001-02-06 11:01:00,0,"TCbassmaster- What do you mean by old sawtooth??? I imagine you mean muskie (or northern pike), But I've also heard the name sawtooth in reference to gar?? I think 1 reason you are not getting replies is because there are so many bays, quiet backwaters and rocky ambush areas that muskies prowl on the right days. Even though I personally don't go casting very often (we focus on walleyes), I do see them surface/boil almost every trip especially if we accidently catch a few perch that swim away sickly. I'd checkout some of the many obvious bays and backwaters along with some other popular places like the rocky shallows around bud's bouy and/or the quiet areas around the fast currents at the Minaki RR bridge or the entrance to Rough Rock.

510757,Guest,2001-03-26 17:01:00,0,"Rob, when and why did the Minaki Lodge close. I havent been up there for 3 years. Is it permanently closed or will some other big Corp. buy it and reopen.???thanks."
510758,Guest,2001-03-26 18:03:00,0,"Well if you been there in the last 3 years, you know the part about the hotel chain selling it to the ""locals"". They ran it into the ground in less than a year. Some big amounts of cash are missing as well as some of their ""management"" team. What happened after that was the lodge was sold to a guy from Dallas. He was, to put this as politically correct I can, a immigrant to North America. Years ago our wonderful political system decided to offer to people from certain countries, $60,000.oo a year to come here.This pgm was a 3 year deal. So after he gets our 180,000 he runs off to the USA where he purchases run down businesses, run down hotels etc. Then pretties them up & sells them for a profit. WELL, the lodge was put up for sale by the trustee and this guy jumps at it. First thing he does is ride into town & procede to piss everyone off. He TELLS the guides he only pays $100 a day, they use their own boats & fuel etc. So no guides @ the lodge. He closes the golf course, knocks down a few buildings, hires a staff of 6 & attemps to run the lodge. he applied for a liquor license but was rejected due to objection from other area companies. He then tried to get stuff always on credit from local companies, and no one would touch him. He always claimed ""I can get it cheaper in Dallas"", so he was basically told to go back to Dallas. He closed the main building about 2 months after opening the lodge. The lodge has been for sale ever since. He is demanding around the $2.5mil mark. I do know someone that has been trying to get the lodge & property, in fact they almost had a deal done. He balked at the last second. SO, where it stands today ? I have no real idea....BUT if this party does get it, there will be some good changes.First, them ""condo"" rooms will be knocked down & replaced by 7 luxury log cabins. The golf course will be made into a 18 hole course. The pool inside is to be repaired. The restaurant will be made into a more complete ""restaurant"". (better menu) The lodge will cater to people who fish, not just people who want to lay around a hotel. The dockside area will be expanded to include bait,tackle,boat rentals, fish cleaning etc. A bar will also open dockside. They are also looking at really making it affordable to most anglers, not just the guys who like throwing their money away ! Basically they have a good plan, they have good business ethics & they do have the resources to do this. All we can do is sit & wait to see if it (the deal) ever happens.BUT until then, the lodge is closed & the greens are about 4 ft high ! Good FishenRob"

I have caught 1 sturgeon in my career, at Nutimik Lake @ Sturgeon Falls (go figure) Anyways she was just a baby, around the 20lb mark. Have never seen one caught on Big Sand or even heard of one caught on the lakes.Good FishenRob"
510752,Guest,2001-02-04 09:35:00,0,Where are the best places to catch old sawtooth in this system?
510753,jvfisherman,2001-02-04 15:41:00,15,There's only one Ole Sawtooth and he was caught at Smirch Lake last June (See the In-Fisherman Big Fish Gallery for evidence).
510733,Guest,2001-01-29 17:03:00,0,"The guy you see netting is a local oldtimer. He nets all over the lake so from year to year his nets move. Now, having said that I will also say that he DOESN'T net walleye. He is fishing for white fish (yup, there is white fish out there) The nets he uses are rather large and easily allow any ""sport"" fish to pass thru. I know this to be a fact because I have been in his boat when he pulls up his nets & I also know where he stores his nets.He keeps his nets at a local place that is owned by a good friend of mine...(thats how I got to ride in his boat)I originally was horrified years ago when one winter I was riding across the bottom of Little Sand and stumbled apon nets that were strung under the ice. I thought ""OH MY GOD"" their netting walleye in the river ! Then after that I looked for nets in the summer and found the odd one....after inquiring about this I found out the real story....whew !NOW, here is the sad part:I wish I could say this doesn't happen, but I know for a fact & have seen it with my own eyes PLUS others from Winnipeg have seen this at one time or another....In years past, the walleye season was open later in the year than here in Manitoba. The season was open until April 15 where in Mb it closes April 1. SO, what was created was effectivly a CDN version of Rainy River. Most of the fishing always took place @ The Dalles. BIG FISH, big fun, big lies,great times had by all & almost 99.9% catch & release. I personally seen a 17lb walleye pulled out of the river. Then the ministry decided to change the laws & give the fish a break. Great Idea ! ! ! HOWEVER they cannot change what some of the ""local"" peoples do (I won't name any one particular group, BUT ? ? ? )Anyways these local peoples can & still do fish, WITH NETS and haul out some big quantities of fish. Big & small, they keep them all. Onetime I seen 2 guys hauling out nets from the river that had so many fish / weight to it, that they were in danger of sinking their boat. Honest truth. These local peoples have the right to fish, but sometimes I wonder why common sense isn't used ?I can also state that I also have HEARD that other local people types have exercised their options / rights and have races up and down the river. To even the odds in the races, the ONLY rule is that you must drag a steel cable with a downrigger ball attached to the cable. I nave no information on the results of the races but I have HEARD that they are a success and will be held yearly. No idea if a trophy is presented but I'm sure all involved are winners.....Good FishenRob"

510736,Guest,2001-01-29 21:21:00,0,"Rob,I've been going to Black Sturgeon Camp since I was about 12 years old, that makes for about 38 years. We come out of Black Sturgeon Lake, go over the rollers (where Black Sturgeon dumps into the Winnipeg) and come into the Winnipeg near The Dalles. Have fished the Winnipeg near The Dalles, Silver Point, Cache Point, and up to Minaki. On a few occasions we've snagged nets in this area. Never have run all the way up to Big Sand, need to do that sometime, maybe this year (we'll be there first two weeks of July)! Usually have pretty good luck in the Winnipeg. By the way, do you know Larry Snow? Carl his brother is our great host every year at Black Sturgeon Camp. I believe Larry does some guiding out of Minaki and up on the English River. Good to hear from a Minaki resident. Looking forward to getting back up to your area this summer!"
510737,Guest,2001-01-29 22:10:00,0,"Wow, that sounds like fun. I have seen the rollers but have never gone into Black Sturgeon. I have fished for pike up in that area in the spring and I can tell you that there are some BIG pike up in that area. No, can't say I know Larry Snow (at least not by name) but likley do by seeing him.Keep in touch, kinda neat hooking up with y'all Minaki types.Good FishenRob"
510742,Guest,2001-01-29 22:35:00,0,"Just a quick comparison,http://www.roughrocklodge.com/rrlrates.htmhttp://www.paradisecoveminaki.com/accommodations.htmhttp://www.paradisecoveminaki.com/rentals.htmhttp://www.minaki-bayviewlodge.com/B...ion-page8.htmlhttp://www.birchislandresort.com/rates.htmWow, what a difference in costs.Just fyi, Bayview is located across from the Minaki Lodge. The Lodge is closed. The camp is located just around ""the corner"" from the train bridge that crosses the river. It is about a 3 min boat ride to Paradise Cove 1 or 2 , from Bayview and it is also located right next door to ""Sunset"" lodge. I'll have to track down some info on them, I completely forgot about them.Birch Island is located on Gunn Lake, about a 5 min boat ride from Minaki or about 8 mins from Bayview. Paradise Cove has multiple locations both right in town (love that 4am train)and right in the subs of Minaki (hehehehehe, little joke)To go from Minaki to Rough Rock is about a 20min or so boat ride, depending on size boat etc. With a 40 on a boat, I'd say 30 mins approx. The trip is easy if you know the water OR if you can read a map & follow markers....Well, hope that helpedGood FishenRob"
510738,Guest,2001-01-30 21:56:00,0,"Thanks Rob for the reply. One question about Big Sand. Is it relatively easy to ""navigate"" or are there allot of shallow areas or rocks that you need to watch out for? Was just curious as to how much care to take if I head that way this summer. Any topo maps of Big Sand?"
510739,Guest,2001-01-30 23:04:00,0,"Well, it is easy to navigate if you make the trip up the lake with someone who knows the area. Once you see it & where the markers are chances are you would never forget them. HOWEVER there are some spots that are not marked, and these spots can & do claim the odd prop or lower unit.....of course when the water levels go up & down these things change. Yes, a topo map is available here in Winnipeg. There is one for Big Sand / Little Sand, the river right from Kenora all the way up to the Whitedog dam. We keep our maps on the wall in the cabin & always use them for reference. I can't remember, but I think that we also have one for rough rock (or parts of it)I could contact the maps branch here & get a list of what they do have. Also, if you stop @ Paradise Cove 1 or 2 in Minaki, Duane had a map made of the lakes a couple of years ago. Besides all the local ""fishing spots"" marked, I think he also has it marked as close as possible for navigation. Not 100% sure on this. I have looked at his map and it is very well done. Think he charges around 20 bucks CDN for this map. Maybe one of the other guys who post here or read the posts, who stay @ PC might have one of these maps & could help out with more info. The govt maps run around the 20 - 25 dollar mark. I know, you're thinking ""Why would they sell Ontario maps on Manitoba ? ""Our maps dept here is really good, and we consider NorthWest Ontario really part of Manitoba. (few years ago NWONT talked of seperation from the rest of Ont) I don't know if these maps are available in Kenora (you'd think they should be) but Kenora is a funny town sometimes.....Anyways, I'll check to see what exactly they have here & will let you know.Good FishenRob"

510728,jvfisherman,2001-01-27 19:27:00,15,Thanks for the tip. I've just read on a couple different posts that there are a lot of people in that area...
510729,Guest,2001-01-28 00:35:00,0,"Well, after reading the many posts slamming the area of Minaki & it's surrounding lakes (which do include Rough Rock) I would like to address the issue of ""crowded / too many boats etc""First off, I have been in that area since early 80's, built a cabin up on Big Sand Lake & have been fishing / guiding for a few thousand days. To be honest, I'm really pissed off that this slamming has been taking place BUT hey we are all entitled to our opinions & I have no problem with that. I would like to clarify & state that in MY opinion, the lakes in the area are not crowded. Yes, you can & will see other boats fishing on one of the 5 lakes or miles of river system but the area is by no means a super highway. If you wanted to go to a remote lake & never see another boat this is not the place for you, I would suggest to you then PAY the outrageous fees camp owners want and go to the fly-ins. The amount of fishing boats in the area is not alot, the # 1 problem is that the people who are operating the boats don't know the lakes or river system. So, what takes place is that everybody follows everyone else.Now,I'm sure you all think I'm nuts but I have seen it many,many times. IF I had 5 cents for every time I was followed, I would be retired. The other problem is that most boats are running marine radios & monitor them.....they hear of ""so & so"" just caught ???, with in a few minutes boats start arriving. To test & prove this theory we have transmitted ""false"" catches & sure enough we will get company. Also Big Sand has a reputation of a crank bait bite / long lining which can (and is) be fantastic. I have seen sometimes 20 - 30 boats out yanking cranks but the area is big and not really a problem. During this time I see boats from far away as Kenora, Rough Rock, & even boats from Tetu camp area. You guys who know Minaki & do fish the cranks know exactly what I am talking about. But I will ask, is 30 boats, heck even 50 boats a big amount of boats for all of the lakes & river ? I think not.We should not base our opinions on the fact that when ""we"" go out cranking & there is a lot of other boats that the area is crowded. I know for a fact then when I go out, I can & do go many times without seeing other boats. I also have fished next to a few boats & I have no problem doing that nor do I find it to be ""crowded"". Do I venture to all the other lakes/river ? Absolutly. Do I find them busy ? No. (I did find out why they call it Rough Rock though...)Now, maybe some peoples opinions on the ""crowded"" aspect of Minaki is based on the fact that the resorts in town (like Paradise Cove)have people wandering around & therefore make the place ""crowded"". This I would agree to. The town can be ""busy"" at times, the bar packed, but this after all is a town. IF you don't want to be close to the ""action"", then a place like Rough Rock is the place to go. Minaki offers road access where as Rough Rock doesn't. Just remember though, when @ R.R you can still fish 4 other lakes & the river. The cost difference & difference in ""plans"" is also varied. In Minaki, say like Paradise Cove, you do it yourself.Own food / cooking / cleaning etc.At a place like Bayview, I think you can get either self service & full service ( I Hear that the food is great) Birch Island is full service & costly (but nice I hear) Big North is similar to Bayview. Birch & Bayview don't have road access, but PC & BN do. All depends on the Ole'budget. Well, I hope I didn't start a firestorm but hopefully I stopped this rumour of Minaki being ""crowded""Good FishenRob"

Sometimes I wonder if people post negative things about a place just trying to keep other newcomers away? Personally I book my cabin at Minaki for the next year about the same time I check in for the current year. I have a question for you Minaki residents??? In past years I saw a guy(s) netting around the mouth of Big Sand, but they have been fewer and last year I did not see any netters. What are the regulations there on netting???? Just curious because each year the fish seem a little more plentiful and a bigger average size. I wondered if this was a reflection of the 18 inch sport fishing slot regulation or if a change of commercial fishing practices is contributing some too????IaCraig"
