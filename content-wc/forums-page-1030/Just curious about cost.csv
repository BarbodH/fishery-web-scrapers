511673,Guest,2001-03-24 20:15:00,0,"Last year when a friend, my son and I went to Canada we divided everything by three. Likewise on previous trips, total cost divide by total number of people. We have not include any indirect cost such as wear and tear on boat or vehicle. It probably is unfair to the owner of the these items, but that is life. I have been the guy with the boat and truck and one just along for the ride. The worst thing about being ther guy with the boat is that when you are getting ready to go, you have to get the boat ready and then clean it up when you get home. The worst thing about being the guy along for the ride is how far do you dig into your pockets to cover the trailer wheel bearings that went out? My biggest fear if I was in your situation is that my wife won't be happy and I cut back on fishing time and then my buddy would not be happy. Plus the following year neither would want to go with me. :)Good luck"
511674,Pops,2001-03-25 04:09:00,61,"As Fritz says we divide the costs by the number of people. That includes any repairs of any kind. This includes wheel bearings, blown tires etc......If it is a dumb move repair, like hitting a rock, that is known then it is the operators cost. By that I mean even if it is not his boat he is in control and should have taken the the proper precautions.We have one guy who's boat, motor, camper and 2 tow vehicles are used every year. Every other year he has only his share of the gas and food to pay, nothing else. We feel it is only fair sense he is already contributing an enormous amount.This works for us.Keep your rod bent !!Pops"
511675,BD,2001-03-25 13:47:00,739,"We split all costs by the number of people going then give a bonus of $50 from each rider to the driver / owner for wear and tear. If the trip costs $400 each divided equally, with three in each vehicle, the owner of the vehicle would pay $300 and the riders $450. The vehicle owner is then expected to have his vehicle, trailer and boat checked out so there are no ""extra"" costs which could have been prevented."
511676,Guest,2001-03-26 01:34:00,0,we split everything evenly. we do not take a boat but since we drive 20+ hours the vehicle owner does not pay for gas. works for us.lobo
511677,Guest,2001-03-26 10:31:00,0,"Bill, I have been to Canada many times (250+ last count I am 71.) and each time is different. Seems some guys make their own plans and stick to it; one guy charges at the end of the trip X$$ to each rider, no explanation. I usually drive and furnish all the boat stuff,too then divide the gas and oil for boat and car equally. and then tack on $10-15 for wash job, etc... Thats still not enough as theres preparation costs, new prop and sonar,gps equipment. And so forth.Now, you are taking your wife; if you split the costs equally this friend will wind up paying less; costs divided by 3. Not fair, although she is another person. Better talk it over now than let it fester. If hes fair he'll be more than willing to come to a different pay arrangement. Speeding tickets are paid by the guy behind the wheel."
511678,hgf,2001-03-26 18:12:00,199,"After some 20 odd Canadian trips, with 3 or more guys going, our system is the car/van owner does not pay for any gas, road food like pop or snacks, tolls and gets a few meals thrown in free. Big meal, with booze, is his own expense, as are speeding tickets. Ditto on car repairs, which we have had once or twice. We found taking a small bag, and everyone dropping in 50 or 60 bucks into it at the beginning of the trip works well. We do the same for the food we buy going into camp. Its a ""gas"" and ""food"" kitty. Saves arguments. Anything left over gets divided back. Booze is your expense, same for camp costs, Licenses, tackle, and so on. Usually one guy ends up handling the money and paying these bills. We think it is cheap having someone else furnish the car/van(Wife wasn't so sure when I came back with a big rock chip in the windshield of our brand new, just delivered Club Wagon one year.)"
511679,Guest,2001-03-27 09:59:00,0,Have made many trips and the best system regardless of the number of participants is for an equal dividing of all costs. Wear and tear and clean up are the responsibility of the owner just the price to pay for the event and this is from a boat and truck owner. We plan out all meals prior to leaving and then one person buys everything then charges all others. Everyone gets more than enough to eat but booze is on your own.
511680,Guest,2001-03-27 11:08:00,0,"My opinion is that you split the cost three ways just as you would if you were to add another unrelated person. However, if it were me going with you and your wife I would insist on paying for 50% of the vehicle and boat gas. But, this should be voluntary. This is a little off the subject, but I usually provide the boat and vehicle for most of my fishing trips. I buy the equipment because I enjoy fishing and spending time with my friends. Over the years I've been on at least a 100 week-ong trips with all kinds of differnt guys and even some women. Although I always expect to pay my share, it sure is nice when my pals volunteer to fill up the boat and truck at the conclusion of the trip, and stay around for an hour or so to help clean up the boat. TGG"
