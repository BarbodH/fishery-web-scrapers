511729,Fisher,2001-03-28 04:53:00,35,"Spent a week there last year, you hear great stories about the number of fish in this lake but a word of advice for you, FOLLOW THE LOCALS! or at least someone who has been there and knows the lake well. If you are looking to get onto some walleye or bass you need to know where to find them. As for the PIKE, they are a different story, throw a spoon or a crankbait around pretty much anywhere that is wet and you'll catch them. Naturally I have a great fishing tale about the one that got away (HUGE) but as for the many we landed, nothing huge but a blast to catch.Good Luck!"

The weather plays a great factor in the walleye fishing on the lake and it didn't cooperate last year but we managed to limit on eye's and were catch and releasing a few!Nothing big though,just 12 to 20 inchers 16 being most common.Where are you staying or are you camping? There are only four lodges there and some cabins.Beautiful lake but can turn ugly when the wind kicks up!"

511733,Guest,2001-03-30 05:02:00,0,went three time. first two the fishing was good. maybe not excellent but good with a couple of excellent days. last year it was terrible. is it slipping? got hints from the lodge about new regs. may want to check that. but it is fairly remote...the lodges were good. red pine esp. but someone posted a note about knowing where to fish...that is a key. enjoy it..it's one of the better ones.
