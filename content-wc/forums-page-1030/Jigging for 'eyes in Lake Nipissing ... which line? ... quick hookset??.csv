Our jigs will be tipped with minnows.1. What line do you recommend?2. Should I set the hook immediately, or let the 'eyes run for a bit???"

You'll also catch alot of pike so you may want to go with the 8lb. Don't let the eyes run, wait to feel the tap twice and then set the hook. I also use stinger hooks up there and one of every five are taken on them. Good luck. Where are you staying?"
