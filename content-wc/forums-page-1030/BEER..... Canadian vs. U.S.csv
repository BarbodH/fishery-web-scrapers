511375,Guest,2001-03-26 21:39:00,0,"I'm surprised nobody mentioned Brador; it seems to be the most popular brand in our group (who is used to the ""watered down American beer"").I'm a pale ale lover myself, and I usually get Alexander Keith's when in Canada. While I agree that the Canadians have us beat in quality of beer overall, I haven't yet found a Canadian pale ale that beats our Sierra Nevada. Any recommendations?"
511376,Guest,2001-03-27 05:28:00,0,You have to watch that Brador. Close to 7%. It's actually a malt liquor. It is the best tasting of the head banger stuff.

511362,Frank from TBay,2001-03-13 05:56:00,312,The fine is around $125.00. They also confiscate your beer. If it is the Provincial Police or RCMP and they feel you are impaired (over .08) you will be charged with impaired driving and lose your driving rights for your automobile if found guilty. The police here have no tollerance for drinking and boating. Over 75% of boating fatalities involve alcohol. The game wardens can also lay a charge for beer in the boat. I think if they feel you are impaired they would bring in the provincial police. I'm very surprised that the officer did not say anything about the beer. In my area (Thunder Bay) you would have had yourself a very bad day.
511363,Guest,2001-03-14 09:50:00,0,LaBatts Blue hands down! My first fishing trip to Canada 5 years ago me and my husband bought a few cases of Blue (figured we should drink Canadian to get the full experience) at the border and boated 40 miles into Northern Lights lake for 4 hot days.... ice melted by the 2nd day and the beer was warm.... but we drank it anyway and to our surprise it was just as good warm!!! ya can't say that about Bud! All we drink now is Canadian!!!
511364,Guest,2001-03-14 11:08:00,0,"I will agree that Labatts is good but is you like a beer with a little more taste Pilsner is good bet. If you want lots of taste and can find it Big Rock, makes several kinds of beer ranging from a ""Traditional"" (Darker beer) right to the lighter ""grasshopper"". They are unpasturized and very tasty. Give them a try if you can find them out east."
511365,Guest,2001-03-14 13:15:00,0,"Amen to that Dave - being a transplanted Saskatchewanian here in Alberta, Pilsner is my first choice (see my earlier post) but Big Rock makes a fine fine brew - although I have friends who say that the unpastuerized beer causes a few more unscheduled ""pit stops"" than the pastuerized stuff. When you are out on a lake, this might not be the best of side effects! <GRIN>Alley Kat Brewery also makes some great brews out in this neck of the woods..."
511366,Guest,2001-03-16 20:18:00,0,"Hello southern neigbors. I live in Saskatchewan here in Canada and I have to agree with all the guys who have wrote saying that they have tried, and liked the Big Rock beers. The traditional and the grasshopper are very fine. I am also surprised that noone has mentioned Molsen Canadian. It's pretty good to. As for the the guys asking about beers in the boat I have found that if you're drinking in the boat, and the Fish Cops stops you, they can be resonable. If your not throwing empty bottles in the lake, being loud or driving like a jerk it is tolerable. That's what I've found. With that said be safe out there and good luck everyone!!"
511367,Eyecon,2001-03-22 18:36:00,368,You guys missed the best Canadian beer-Labatts Genuine Draft!!!!
511358,Guest,2001-03-24 11:14:00,0,i think you are right i'll take miller anytime!!!!!
511368,Guest,2001-03-24 19:11:00,0,I agree 100%..best beer I have ever tried...but can't seem to find it in my area. Besides fishing in Saskatchewan this is the next best thing to look forward to on our annual fishing trip.
511370,Guest,2001-03-25 03:22:00,0,"Thersh no debout about it...Labatsh ish the besht beer in Canada...good fro breakfasht, lurch and diner, unlesh therz nuthin esle......wheeee!!!!!"

511351,Walley Guide,2001-03-08 07:54:00,67,"Been fishing in Canada for over 20 years....Ole Blue is my pick for beer! Keep it off the water, those folks don't go for that.Last year you could take across (1) case, 24 pack duty free. Then you were allowed up to (4) additional cases which you would need to pay duty on. I haven't read any changes to that process yet this year, but I wouldn't be suprised if the regs change some.....they seem to every year.Enjoy!Walley"
511353,River_eye,2001-03-08 08:31:00,1486,"Most customers at the lodge I work at choose to buy their beer in Canada. My favourite choices would be Labbatt Blue, Moosehead, and possibly Kokanee.The ones that are most popular with the americans are Molson Canadian, and Budweiser (Canadian formula).River eye"
511352,Guest,2001-03-08 12:58:00,0,"The beer you are probably talking about is called ""Creemore Springs"" and is without a doubt the best beer I have ever tasted."
511354,Hans,2001-03-09 10:27:00,1124,Moosehead. LaBatt and Molson are horse pee.Hans
511355,Guest,2001-03-09 16:55:00,0,"Hans, I havn't had all that many canadian beers, and we don't have time to experiment while we are loading up at the beer store and/or duty free. What would be your choice ? we usually load up on Bud but have experimented with awful concoctions in the past, such as molson dry (had to throw that away). We found one last year that was pretty good I think it was labatt crystal; another one that was acceptable was molson export ale. What do you buy when on the other side ?Steve"
511356,Guest,2001-03-10 11:04:00,0,Is there a Labatts Ice? I think that's my favorite!
511357,Guest,2001-03-12 07:29:00,0,My group has been drinking Labatt's Crystal for several years and enjoy it. Last year we gave Kokanee a try and liked that too.
511359,Guest,2001-03-12 14:19:00,0,The 4 beers of choice my group of guys like are as follows1. Labatts blue2. Labatt's Crystal3. Kokenee4. OV
511360,Guest,2001-03-12 19:27:00,0,"Attention all beer drinkers: Whether it be Canadian or American beer, just remember when all you gentlemen ( and I use that term loosely ) feel guilty about imbibing one too many on your fishing trips, just keep in mind the words of that old song : ""In heaven there is no beer, that's why we drink it here"".Using that type of rationale will help ease the conscience. Remember to always keep your eyes open and your feet dry."
511361,TangledAngler,2001-03-13 04:56:00,65,"Just curious, what is the penalty if you are caught with beer out on the boat in Ontario? I've been stopped by conservation officers up on Lake Nipissing and had an open can of beer within plain view of the officer and he said nothing. Just curious as to what would happen if an officer made a big deal about it."
511341,Guest,2001-03-06 18:35:00,0,"If I were to buy all my beer for my trip in Canada instead of the US, what should I buy???"
511342,Guest,2001-03-06 18:48:00,0,Labatt's blue is my choice..
511343,Guest,2001-03-06 19:25:00,0,"Mmmm, Beeer. I tried labatt's for the first time last weekend, not bad for run of the mill commercial brew. I'd assume I'd base my choice on two things, 1) How much can a guy take across the border? 2)Where would the purchase price be cheaper, US or Canada?I'd kill everyone in this room for just one drop of sweet, sweet beer. (Homer Simpson)"
511344,Guest,2001-03-06 20:35:00,0,"It depends where you are going - in Western Canada - you can't beat Pilsner (it's not only a type of beer, but a Brand Name!!!) - if Ontario - Labatt blue or Moslon Dry is always a good choice..."
511345,Jesse-WI,2001-03-06 21:20:00,534,The XXX is pretty. The largest beer stores usually have a nice select of Stouts if you like Guiness type brews.
511346,Guest,2001-03-07 05:42:00,0,"As far as I'm concerned, there is only one beer available in Canada...and that's Labatt Blue. Very smooth, and you can pound a 8-10 beers (stay off the lake) without the morning residue left by X or the Dry beers. Sometimes those poker games last several hours when it's cold and rainy, and beer after beer just happens. So, whether you're having ten or two, all you need is Blue."
511347,Mookie,2001-03-07 06:38:00,5,"Was wondering the same thing last year and sought the answers from the fine sages that post to this board. One of their suggestions was Kokanee. Give Kokanee in a bottle a try, you won't be disappointed. I split a case with a friend last year, we'll be buying a case each(if not more) this year. Purchased ours in Dryden so I know its around. Enjoy!!!"
511348,Guest,2001-03-07 18:10:00,0,You guys are killing me!!!!!!! I gave up beer for lent! Please stop this cruel talk! Easter is now my favorite holiday!
511349,HLLGuide,2001-03-07 19:14:00,10,"I agree with Mookie, Kokanee is a great beer. So is Labatt Blue. These would be my 2 choices!"
511350,Guest,2001-03-08 05:39:00,0,"I've never met a Canadian beer I didn't like. My personal choice when at home is Molson Ice. While vacationing in the Tobermory area a while back we discovered a black and tan that was from a local microbrewrey whose name I can't recall, but it was wonderful. My hat is off to our Canadian neighbors. Their beer is so much better than our watered down American stuff. No comparison."
