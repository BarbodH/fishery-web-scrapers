From what I gather, there are some fishing camps on this lake. I would appreciate it if anyone would care to put the mailing addresses, e-mail, or webpage addresses out there so that I could contact these people and see if they still have any dates available for this season. Also, if anyone would like to give me any of your personal experiences with fishing and types of fishing it would be appreciated."

The web address is www.oldpost.com.I think the fishing has improved every year. The lake is very protected, i.e. single barbless hook rule, 4 fish limit, no walleye over 18"", but we have always had plenty of action. We have found that getting out quite a ways from camp does provide better fishing. Maybe it's just because there are more options that way. The pike fishing is also excellent. The lake has an excellent population of big pike that are loads of fun. I would recommend hiring a guide for a couple of days if for no other reason than there are lots of rocks that are easy to hit. Nothing can ruin a trip faster. The guides will also put you on the fish fast. In the past I have used a hand held gps just to get a safe track to follow for the rest of the week.Check out their web page and give John a call. I think you'd really like it up there. Good Luck!Fred"
