510920,Guest,2001-02-03 05:07:00,0,I am considering this place for pike next year so if any on has info. please let us know. Is the pike fishing for trophies as good as they say it is? Thanks.
510921,Guest,2001-02-05 18:13:00,0,"I have been to South Woldia twice and SnowBird once. The fishing is good but I dont know if it is as good as they (CLARK)say it is.North and South Woldia are the same lake one camp on the north end one on the south. I think about 30 miles apart. This lake is primarity a pike lake. it has countless shallow bays with rocky mouths. The biggest pike was 46"" about 25# a lot of 39-42"" fish but not every cast by know means. I did some fishing up north not to far from the north camp and could help with some good areas. The trout fishing can be good. we caught alot of 3-8# trout with the biggest being 15#. If your are after trout I would go to Snowbird hands down. The numbers and size were twice as good. The two biggest were weighed at 41# and 37# same guy one after the other twenty minuts apart. On these lakes timing is every thing.When I go agin I will only go if I can go the first trip or the second trip in. This is very important if you want to get pike in the bays and trout sallow. The season is very short and things change fast. Hope this helps........ Percher"

510922,Guest,2001-03-23 12:53:00,0,I am headed to Ingalls Lake at North of Sixty in July. Have you had any experience there? Any helpful hints both for the Pike and Lake Trout?
510923,whitey,2001-03-26 06:07:00,36,You might try Kasba Lake lodge. It's real close to north of sixty and the accomadations are first class. So is the fishing. It's not cheap! what does north of sixty cost???? You might also consider the lodges at the north end of reindeer. Lawrence Bay I thing.. It use to be Ganglers. Great Fishing. Big Pike and Trout
