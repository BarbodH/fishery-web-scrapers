511402,Guest,2001-03-11 14:42:00,0,"Eric, I ran camps on Mojikit/Ogoki Reservoir for the past three years. I would be very careful who you book with if you are going up there. I would look at Wilderness North or Mattice Lake Outfitters for the best quality of camps and equipment on the Reservoir and anybody out of Qrmstrong on Mojikit Lake. The Twin Lakes camps are pretty scary.As far as the fishing goes, it is a seriously big body of water with lots and lots of fish. Both Northern and Walleye are plentiful. It can be a pretty technical lake to fish due to the fact that it is literally full of flooded timber. Make sure you take lots of lures with you. I would use as much weedles stuff as possible. Buy lots of cheap jigs and 3-5 inch plastic bodies. A fish finder is also a necessity. If you can get through the wood there are lots of big fish to be had. It is really a great lake, probably the most underrated fishery in Ontario.Good Luck,Marty"

My father-in-law (Bud) used them for years before becoming ill, however his fishing buddies still use them. They have always been very successful with walleyes and large northern. If you get any info, especially on topo maps of the lake(s), I would be greatful for any help. If youhave any questions that I can ask Bud, I will."
