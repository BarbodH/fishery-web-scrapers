In the instances where they refer to certain areas not open during the time period from April 15 to June 15 does this typically exclude the entire lake or just part of the lake? If not the entire lake, how do you know when you are on the lake where the excluded areas are?"
511686,Guest,2001-03-27 18:07:00,0,In cases where it is NOT the entire lake (look up Minnitaki Lake in the 2001 regs) the MNR places huge green billboard signs that only the blind could miss.

An example of the lakes in our area that has a lot of restriction for different areas for different times is Shebandowan. It directs you to four other areas in the exceptions section that partially close the lake. I fish the lake at seasons end and you almost need a lawyer and a surveyor to be shure you are legal. There are no signs posted in most of the areas.If you are in the least bit unshure check with the CO.
511688,GregK,2001-03-28 05:51:00,113,The rules you are pointing to are intended to keep people out of Musky spawning areas. The lakes that we fish in Canada have these areas clearly marked with a brown sign. You will find examples of it in the regulations. A check with the resort owner can usually pinpoint all of these areas. You would do well to get familiar before you go out. My regards to you for asking before going. Good sportsman realize it is their responsibility to understand the regulations no matter how complicated.
