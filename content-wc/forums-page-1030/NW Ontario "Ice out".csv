511653,Guest,2001-03-23 08:20:00,0,Anyone up that way care to make a prediction on when theice will be out this year?
511654,darcyfish,2001-03-23 08:31:00,15,"By the way this winter is going I will guess third week in April maybe even the beginning of May, still a couple of feet of ice."
511655,Frank from TBay,2001-03-23 09:28:00,312,Going to be a late one this year. I guess the first week of May. We are going down to -16C tonite with a high of -3C tomorrow. Post spawn Walleyes are going to get pounded.
511656,Guest,2001-03-23 15:00:00,0,Ice at Whitemouth Lake (Close to Ontario Border) a week ago was to the bottom of my auger with still a lot of snow cover. I say first week in May. I was consulting my log book and last year I was out Spring Laker fishing near Minaki on April 13th and the lake (Sword Lake) was still half frozen.
511657,Guest,2001-03-25 09:08:00,0,"Nipigon/Geraldton area should be around April 23-28th.Still 30"" ice but only 14"" good blue.Warming trends will make it sooner.Put the boat in April 10 last year."
511658,Guest,2001-03-26 09:44:00,0,"Ice Out on Pipestone Lake will mid April. Only about 14 inches of ice in the thickest spots. The small warm water walleye lakes flowing into pipestone will really push up the ice out date. I can't wait for some hot ""Ice Out"" Lake trout fishing."
511659,Guest,2001-03-26 10:14:00,0,"Matt, read your comment on waiting for lake trout bite. In your area doesn't the season reopen in mid-May sometime the earliest? I'm looking forward to it,too. Perhaps they will still be up then with this later ice-out season. Thanks for your comeback. Irv Johnson[email protected]"
511660,Guest,2001-03-26 14:44:00,0,In my area the season opens on Jan 1. I'll be trout fishing as soon as I can get my boat in.
