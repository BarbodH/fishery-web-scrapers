511642,Guest,2001-03-23 04:01:00,0,Myself two brothers and Dad are hoping to get in a Canadian fishing trip this summer. Can you help me out with some good places to go. Nothing fancy just good quality.
511643,Guest,2001-03-23 05:08:00,0,"A few good lakes I have experienced in my travels have been Lake Nosbonsing, just east of Callander, Ontario near North Bay. Also Lake Wabitongushi, just NE of Wawa, Ontario near a town called Missinnabie. North of Sault Ste. Marie. At Lake Nosbonsing, try Big Moose camp. Nothing fancy, very cost-efficient, and good boats. Or Birch Hill, a good camp with nice people that'll do anything for you. They even gave me one of their personal boats because a big group came in that needed more boats than expected. It was great!!! If you want to see what this lake (Nosbonsing) is about, try Cozy Camp Cottages web site. They are an above average outfitter for this lake, but always booked solid a year in advance. This lake is above average for walleye, great for pike and smallmouth bass. At Lake Wabitongushi, try Loch Island Lodge or Camp Lochalsh. Both of these camps have web sites, so you can check them out. This is a great lake with plenty of walleye, pike, and huge whitefish. A little tough to get into; logging road to Loch Island and train to Camp Lochalsh. Kind of an adventure though.Stay away from anything within 2 hours or Toronto. Fished out. Good Luck !!!"

511645,Guest,2001-03-23 17:24:00,0,"I have been to Canada at least 15 times. I have been on several Fly-ins out of Red Lake, Fished Lac Seul, Northern Saskatchewon, Lake of the Woods, And a little place called Cygnet Lake, outside of Minaki, Ontario. I started going to this lake over ten years ago with my dad when he was still alive. My brothers and I still go there because we catch fish. Its a small lake 3300 acres and there are usually only 5 or 6 boats on the lake. It is run Bill and Sandi Demkier. They are great people and the cabins are clean and they treat you super. His business is mostly repeat and I understand why. You won't catch many hogs but we boat lots of 18"" to 22"" walleyes. We have caught several northerns 15lbs plus over the years. Last year we got into the smallies! several 18"" to 19"" fish. Rates are very reasonable and it won't take you 2 days like a big lake to find the fish. E- Mail me if you want more info."
