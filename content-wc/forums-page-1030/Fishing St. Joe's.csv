511614,Fred_G,2001-03-26 19:49:00,908,I've never done a fly in trip so I couldn't give you any comparison. I guess I like the comforts of a drive to. And the meals at The Old Post are much better than I could do on my own. Fred
511609,Guest,2001-03-22 03:57:00,0,We are thinking of a trip to Lake St. Joe's and see alot of advertising for Old Post Lodge. Is this the best on the lake or are ther other resorts we should look at?
511610,Fred_G,2001-03-22 05:53:00,908,This year will be our fifth year at the Old Post. Great place to stay. John & Wendy Grace are tremendous hosts. The service is second to none. And the fishing seems to get better every year. I understand that they will be using 30 & 40 hp 4 stroke Yamaha motors this year on all of the camp boats.There is one other camp on the lake. I believe it's called Camp Lake St. Joseph. Can't tell you much about the camp other than it's a big lake for 15 hp motors. If you're taking your own boat it should be a fine place to stay. Good Luck! Fred
511615,KnottyBuoy,2001-03-22 07:17:00,110,We stayed at Camp Lake St. Joseph over the 4th of July last year.....they have very nice accomodations and are good hosts. There is no electricity at their camp but they have gas lights and refrigeration.....they do carry some live bait and supply you with ice and so forth every day.......they do a camp fish fry on Thursday night which is spectacular.......We will be up there again this year......last week in July.......fishing is fantastic.......we heard it is a hazardous lake for underwater rocks but if you stay in the main channels and take your time you can navigate safely..........
511616,Kaz,2001-03-22 10:07:00,643,"I fished St Joe for several years. Broadrib is the place to go if John doesn't call it ""off limits"", ""Blondy"" is gone so thats good. It's a long ride (25mi) through bolder city #*#&*. Lots of rocks, not marked!!! Take extra props and shear pins. Even a GPS track is not good enough to follow after you threaded your way the first time. But the fishing is worth it. Watch the fish length. Ray Bull (warden) nailed me $750 for three fish only a quarter to half inch over the slot. They bend the tail to a point, then measure. He then took all five of my fish. Bad day!!! Clyde Cameron at Lake St. Joe Resort I think is a better host, but thats just my oppinon. John has a nice bar for happy hour. Have fun and good luck fishing....Kaz"
511611,Guest,2001-03-22 17:59:00,0,"Hey Fred, were you on the meal plan? Was it worth it? Is it necessary to get a guide? I'm mostly interested in walleye, is the lake better for quality or quantity? Thanks for any info-Netty B"
511612,Fred_G,2001-03-23 07:07:00,908,"We always go with the meal plan. Wendy is a wonderful cook. I swear I gain 10 lbs in a week up there. Besides, it gives you more time to fish.If you've never been on the lake, I would sugest hiring a guide for a couple of days. It's a big lake with lots of hazards. The guides will put you on fish right away. They also fix great shore lunches. We usually go out about 20 miles from camp, and wouldn't have known how to get to these spots without being guided there first. We've also found some great spots on our own in the general areas that the guides have taken us to. I would highly recommend Phillip Grace or Roy Hoffman as guides. They know the lake very well and are great guys to fish with. Fred"
511617,Guest,2001-03-23 19:41:00,0,"After flying out of Pickle Lake for several years I have heard guys speak of the fishing on St Joseph. I don't have an opinion on either of the main camps there but have heard good about both. I have noticed that there is a fly-in at the west end of the same lake, in Root Bay. The outfitter that goes there is out of Sioux Lookout and is called Patricia Fly-In Camps LTD. (807) 737-3781 or (807) 737-3843.Anybody heard of this fly-in or have any reports ? It sure looks good to me and is on the ""go to"" list.....lobo"
511618,Guest,2001-03-24 16:42:00,0,"lobo....fished out of Root Bay with Patricia Fly-In's about 10 or 12 years ago. Didn't do very good. First time on the lake and it rained everyday except one. I was there the last week in May. About the only place we caught fish was down below the dam on the Root River system a way's south of camp. The lake on the west end is big and very deep. I marked some areas over 80' deep.Our experience for that week was not good, the worst I have ever had in Canada, but conditions, etc. contributed to that. Some of the water east of Root Bay sure looked good and probably were if weather had cooperated.Good Luck....eyesnatcher"
511619,Guest,2001-03-24 18:30:00,0,"Eyesnatcher,Thanks for the response !! In a big body of water like that the fish can abandon ship in a hurry and with all those rocks....... not like you can crank off 25 miles quickly. Glad to hear from you. I have heard so much about Lk St Joe from the guys going there when we were waiting for flights at Pickle Lk. Our group has to run about 22 HRS to get to that neck of the woods and if there is any problem putting fish in the boat for ANY reason - we're out. Cold fronts, snow, rain, blizzards (in June) etc etc etc we always have caught lots of fish.We're always looking for upcoming years...........any other places that you really like ?? (email if u prefer)thankssteve"
511613,Guest,2001-03-26 18:52:00,0,Fred:I'm wondering if you have ever done a fly-in? How have they compared to St. Joe's?Lines Tight-Whitcomb
