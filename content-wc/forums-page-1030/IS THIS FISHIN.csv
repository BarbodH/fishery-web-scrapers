511734,lenray,2001-03-27 17:39:00,467,To each his own--so many posts on both forums-people looking for good lodges-deluxe flyins-lakes where you can back down a ramp and unload a big boat and fish on water where others are fishing.Two guys carrying a small canoe and an inflatible in a backpack-carry the canoe 3 miles down an old overgrown logging road portage thru a lake river system for half a day then go overland thru the bush with the inflatable to unnamed lakes. As I said to each his own but for me to fish like most are doing--I might as well be bowling .

We all realize unless we are just like you we should all be wearing bowling shirts with the names Lenny (no pun intended) or squigy on it. We should just throw all fishing tackle in the dumpster. I guess if you look up fishin in websters your definition and your picture would be there. I also assume that if I take my kid fishin at the drive to pond for blue gills I should remember my bowling shoes. Lighten up please."

511737,lenray,2001-03-29 09:47:00,467,I do have my very own bowling shoes-I see your point I was out in left field with my post--I have a new grandson and when he is old enough I will be to old to pack in.We go up into Ontario as many as 8 times some years-5 trips planned for this year--We have NEVER seen another person on any of the lakes that we fish.lenray
