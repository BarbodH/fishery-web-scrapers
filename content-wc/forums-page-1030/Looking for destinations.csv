My fishing partner and his wife just had a new baby and don't want to drive that far from the Detroit area. We are looking to keep the total travel time down in the 12 hour area from Detroit. We are looking for a good walleye lake, but also like to have fun with some Pike and mabey some smallies. Need something to keep the women busy too.Thanks,Walleyehawger"
