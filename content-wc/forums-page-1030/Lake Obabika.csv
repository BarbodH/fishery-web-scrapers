Cruising the web yesterday, I cruised through the sit for Lake Obabika Lodge and it looked like a nice place. According to their site, it looked a little light on the walleye scene, but how is it for sm. bass and pike. Also, how is it for kids?I can trade off walleyes for some good sm. bass fishing. I would be looking to go either end of July or August. Thanks."
