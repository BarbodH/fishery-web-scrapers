573710,Guest,2008-05-08 16:32:00,0,I go up to Sturgeon for the opener also. If I hear anything I will post but it doesn't look good.
573725,Guest,2008-05-09 07:56:00,0,"From what I have heard and people I've talked to, it WILL be open. Have a great time and good luck"

573761,Guest,2008-05-10 10:18:00,0,"That the ice would be out. Open 30"" from shoreline and very black. All that is needed is a good strong wind with a little rain and ice is GOOD-BYE!!!!"
573805,Guest,2008-05-11 15:54:00,0,People who run our camp say ice will not be off lake for opener. White sand area possibly but not main lake.

From pictures in Souix Lookout I think we'll have enough open water to fish the bay at Trappers Point but may not get into the big lake for a few day's. Just as well, later ice out should have more fish still in the bay's.."
