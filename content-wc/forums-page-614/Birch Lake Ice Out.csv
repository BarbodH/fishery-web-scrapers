573860,Guest,2008-05-13 11:53:00,0,We will be going to a lake just north of Birch Lake in 12 days. Does or can any one know what the ice conditions (or lack of) on Birch Lake. The Lake is Carillion - just off the NE corner of Birch approx. 10 miles. I've been reading a lot about Lac Seul and Red Ice out but nothing as far north as Birch. Can someone help? Thanks

Little areas here and there that have open water but majority of the lake is still iced up. We did have rain earilier today in that area and afterwards the wind started to pick up. Should get some movement here soon. I would think your trip will be safe as things are starting to really go fast now. Hope your trip goes well, let us know how you do when you get back."
