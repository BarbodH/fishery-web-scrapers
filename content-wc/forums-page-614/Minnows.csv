We have a large group on our trip and usually purchase 12-15 dozen per person Doesn't seem like something that is practical for DNR to enforce. Anyone know of the consequences for being caught with more than 10 dozen per person (fine, deportation, castration)?"

573864,Guest,2008-05-13 12:49:00,0,"Yes, we bring that many. We rent a houseboat and keep them submerged in a large minnow new/basket that hangs off the back of the boat. I think we purchased it at Cabelas. Works amazingly. The minnows stay alive the entire trip."
573865,Guest,2008-05-13 12:57:00,0,never heard that but we always stayed in a cabin each night. for a houseboat i would think the limit if there is one would not apply. besides counting them would be more trouble than its worth. I think they have a rule against catching them yourself out of the lake. I guess they dont want you using baby walleyes for bait.
573867,Crede,2008-05-13 14:34:00,134,"According to the Ontario Ministry of Naural Resourses Fishing Regulations Summary 2008-2009 (released December 3, 2007), page # 10, an angler with a valid fishing licence may possess 120 baitfish (includes caught and or purchased). Only resident anglers may capture baitfish. On the same page it also states that an angler may possess 120 leeches (caught and or purchased). Link :www.mnr.gov.on.ca/198219.pdf Crede"
