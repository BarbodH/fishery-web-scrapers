574050,phishfearme,2008-05-19 16:38:00,1242,"johnt - welcome to the best canadian walleye fishing site that there is!! first, you'll probably note that the vast majority of the posts on this site deal with NW ontario (north of MN). i live in western PA and have been doing the long arduous journey to NW ontario for the last 15 years or so after spending the previous 15 years in NE ontario (sudbury/north bay to cochrane). NE ontario just got too crowded for our tastes (we used ray's camps out of biscotasing for about 8 years and stopped going there after numerous illegal roads were driven in. we actually saw water skiers.) we feel the extra travel time is worth what you get in NW ontario - large lakes with usually a large portage lake or two and only one cabin. in any event, we've used cochrane air service a number of years ago to their lower detour lake outpost (and we also went to partridge/kesagami with another outfitter out of cochrane - do a search on ""gardiner"" to see the sad details). these lakes are commonly referred to as james bay lowlands lakes and are typically flat bottomed, shallow and very, very little rock structure like you would find in the canadian schieds lakes north of sudbury and in NW ontario and also can become extreemly muddy after wind storms - we just don't like them but some people prefer them - personal choice. we also found the walleye average a very small 13-15 inches with a 19 inchers a top dog. sorry but we've never been to nettogami. it's been many years since we used cochrane A.S. but i do recall that they ran a first rate operation and they've certainly been in business numerous years so they're doing something right. please post a trip report when you get back. best of luck, phish"
