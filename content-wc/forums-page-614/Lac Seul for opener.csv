573831,Guest,2008-05-12 08:27:00,0,Thanks Gary. You are right about the big girls. Quick release and get those Moms back in the water.
573834,Guest,2008-05-12 10:46:00,0,"So would it be safe to say The eyes will still be shallow that first week in June, or will they be moving out to the main pts outside the bays? How long do the fish hang out after the spawn?"
573838,JDP,2008-05-12 14:48:00,1457,"I spoke with Mahkwa Lodge this afternoon... It looks like my group will be able to launch our boats and travel to Mahkwa Lodge on Saturday. No auger in play! On Sunday, we probably will be able to navigate to a few close bays and fish. There may be an element fo risk ---floating ice may cause some problems. We will go expecting difficult,changing, and for sure slow navigational conditions at least the first couple of days. I will be speaking with Mahkwa again on Thursday. JDP"
573851,Guest,2008-05-13 05:07:00,0,We had our final fisahing meeting last night and our group is still planning on heading for Evergreen Lodge on Saturday. We will fish where ever we can and enjoy every minute of it.
573854,Hump,2008-05-13 08:54:00,578,"Let us know all of the details of your trip. Always interested in where you fish, presentation, changes at Evergreen etc."
573781,bpetersen,2008-05-10 21:58:00,251,Thanks for the information Rob. See you in June. Pete
573784,Guest,2008-05-11 04:51:00,0,JDP I have a phone number for Roger Bull if you have trouble getting Mahkwa Lodge to respond. If you need the number please provide me an email address to send it to. NE Piker
573785,JDP,2008-05-11 05:59:00,1457,Thanks NE Piker:[email protected] JDP
573787,Guest,2008-05-11 06:35:00,0,"There is little change in the south central basin of Lac Seul. The ice pulses between white (AM) and grey (PM), but is still tight to the shore. From my office window the only open water to be seen is the 50 ft. section at the dock fed by a creek. The rest of the lake is ice covered. Things can change quickly, but I do not expect to be ice free by the 17th. In fact if we don't get some better thawing weather (wind, sun, rain), then there is a chance that I may also have to cancel groups scheduled for the 21st. For guests booked at lodges on the west or east side of Lac Seul, you should know that the south central part of the lake is usually the last to open up. Last year it went May 6 and in 2002, May 23 was our latest ice out in the last 10 years. Mike Willems Silver Water Wheel Lodge"
573799,Guest,2008-05-11 12:48:00,0,Mike I assume that Mahkwa Lodge would be very similar to your location meaning the south central part of the Lake and might be towards the end of ice out? We are scheduled for arriving on the 24th. NE Piker
573801,JDP,2008-05-11 14:34:00,1457,"Please send Roger Bull's phone number to:[email protected] Thanks, JDP :cheers:"
573818,Guest,2008-05-11 21:24:00,0,"We talk about the main lake basin north and west of Mahkwa the same way that we talk about the large deep water basins near Silver Water Wheel. Based upon previous seasons, those basins generally go ice free last and at about the same time. It is a big guessing game. I don't think that we are going to be ice free by the 17th. Mahkwa is located by several narrows and there is a good chance that they have more current and open water than we do. If the question is getting around the ice, you will have some options down there, but ice free main lake feels more like May 20 - May 22. I hope I am wrong and we get big wind, rain, and sun before then, but it feels very much like the 2002 season. I am generally accused of being overly optimistic, but we still have a little snow in the yard, massive 3 ft. thick blocks of ice suspended beneath the dock cribbing, and in the evening the entire sheet of ice on the lake still goes white. We'll keep staring at it and hope for the best. Mike Willems SWWL"
573823,JDP,2008-05-12 06:03:00,1457,Thanks for the post Mike. There's nothing wrong with being optimistic because in the end we usually get what we need or can live with even if it is not what we want! My hope is that my group can get to Mahkwa via boat on Saturday May 17 then find a couple of spots Sunday to fish with the lake opening up the balance of the May 18-24 time frame. Once I do speak with Mahkwa Lodge I'll post their report/thoughts. Thanks Again! JDP :cheers:
573826,Guest,2008-05-12 07:25:00,0,Pat let me know if you have any news on the ice conditions.
573830,Guest,2008-05-12 07:59:00,0,"Ice continues to melt as the weather warms at night, light rain forecasted for the next couple days, that will really help. We got all our docks in and boats ready yesterday, current on this end of lake is a help, enough openwater for a good opener. Got into minnow lakes yesterday and got bait traps out, small bush lakes are opening fast also, very noticeable change just in the couple hours we were setting traps. Lets all remain positive and enjoy early season fishing, take care of the big girls as they will be in shallow and in the spawn or close to it."
573647,Guest,2008-05-07 19:35:00,0,"First will the ice be off? Secondly we will be fishing near Ear Falls, any idea where one should go for walleye?"
573716,Guest,2008-05-08 18:40:00,0,">First will the ice be off? Secondly we will be fishing near >Ear Falls, any idea where one should go for walleye? Ice is OFF to steamboat narrows as of last week. Your camp owner will probably give you great advice as to where to fish, along with a good map of the lake."
573719,Guest,2008-05-08 19:42:00,0,"I disagree with the previous post. My bay is still tight to the shore although it is turning black. From our place we can see right over to Sawmill Bay and there is no sight of open water between here and there. I took a drive about an hour ago, the bay at Fishermans Cove is still full of ice although there is about forty feet of water at the public landing across from their dock. Further south at Wabauskang there is some water along the shoreline in front of Tall Pines the rest is full of black ice. Still freezing at night and possibility of snow this Sunday and Monday.If the snow turns to rain I may have water at my dock for the opener. One can always hope!"
573722,Guest,2008-05-09 04:43:00,0,"I was in the boat yesterday and I can only tell you what I experienced. All fishermen will have to call there resort owners on the status of ice, fishing spots, etc."
573751,Guest,2008-05-09 18:41:00,0,"I called Mahkwa Lodge today. They told me the ice is breaking up around the shoreline, but otherwise the lake is covered. They said a heavy wind is needed to begin moving the ice off the lake. We are slated to be there 2 weeks from tomorrow, so I am getting a little nervous. Does anyone else have an up to date report? NE Piker"
573753,JDP,2008-05-09 21:04:00,1457,"NE Piker, I have a group scheduled for Mahkwa next Saturday (May 17th)... SO I am more than a little nervous!! I think I'll start working on a back-up plan. :boohoo:"
573758,walleyeduran,2008-05-10 08:18:00,286,"JDP, your group should be fine that is if you bring your ice augers!!!!!"
573769,Guest,2008-05-10 14:57:00,0,"pat sez the ice is off to steamboat(presumably meaning from the dam area where she lives to steamboat narrows). rob, who lives a little over half way to steamboat, and right off the shipping channel, sez ice is tight to the shore. pat sez ice went off last week, 5/3 or before. over by mahwka, it's starting to break up by the shoreline. pat sez she was out in her boat 5/8. very interesting. hmmmmmmmm????"
573772,JDP,2008-05-10 17:36:00,1457,I have a call into Mahkwa Lodge. If I hear ANYTHING from them I'll post what I find out. JDP
573776,Guest,2008-05-10 19:05:00,0,"Pat is quite likely correct that there is a channel open from steamboat to Goldpines. My point was that there is still a lot of ice west of the narrows. At one point today it looked like open water east of Goose Island.It is decieving to look at this time of year because the ice changes from dark to white several times before it finally goes for good. I can say that the ice is getting rotten around my dock. I fell through this afternoon. I can also say that the water temp under that ice is 32' or colder.There are spots of water along the shore on both sides of our place. In case anyone is interested in my records of ice out in our bay over the last decade here they are. 1995-May7, 1996-May18, 1997-May15, 1998-April23, 1999May3, 2000April26, 2001May2, 2002May15, 2003May6, 2004May7, 2005April22, 2006April23, 2007May1, 2008yet to be determined"
