573870,bpetersen,2008-05-13 22:10:00,251,Who has a crystal ball out there. With the late ice out on Lac Seul. Any ideas on when the spawn will start. I know temps from 40-50 degrees F. roughly but any ideas when? Water temps must still be in the low 30 degrees F.? Fish Hawk/Powered By Yamaha
573873,Guest,2008-05-14 06:07:00,0,"I was wondering the same thing. And also, how long do they stay shallow after the spawn?"
573874,JDP,2008-05-14 06:43:00,1457,"Disclainer: I'm not a biologist, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last week! Perhaps Mike Willems,Gary Beardsley or the NWO Fishing Bum will provide an educated answer! So this is strictly my opinion based upon my experience on Lac Seul and other northern lakes. Lac Seul walleyes spawn in various locations: - creeks,rivers - shallow bays - main lake shoals Many of the creeks and rivers will warm sufficiently for spawning despite the existance of ice on the main lake. But no doubt the cold spring would have an impact on numbers of walleyes spawning. Bays on the north side of the lake will become ice free before the main lake and warm; again the cold spring will impact the number of walleyes spawning. Walleyes that spawn on main lake shoals and shorelines will be affected in a major way. The spawn in these locations could significantly reduced with the extended cold water period. Female walleyes, I understand may absorb their eggs and not spawn. The cold spring will probably mean a reduced 2008 year class of walleyes in the future population. My $.02. JDP"

573879,Guest,2008-05-14 09:28:00,0,">Yeah you can bet NWO fishing bum is an expert on that issue >also. I don't know about expert! But at least MUCH more informed than you or I. The bum has spent more time on that water than most of us put together, I trust his well informed opinion."

573886,Guest,2008-05-14 11:02:00,0,"Lakes in northwest ontario stratify by temperature and mix twice a year. In the summer the warmest water is on top and in the winter the warmest water is at the bottom. Water is most dense at 4 degrees celsius. This is what prevents a body of water from ""filling up with ice."" The ice floats and then insulates the remainder of the lake. As soon as the ice breaks in spring, a dramatic mixing of the entire water column occurs. You can occasionally see surface temps in the 30s, but in a big body of water like Lac Seul, you will find that the surface temps (and temps throughout the water column) are around 40-42 degrees F immediately. The surface temps. below 40 usually occur after a very cold night with little wind. Again the water beneath is warmer. Water temp is only one component that affects the timing of the spawn. Photoperiod (length of the day) also is responsible for the timing of the hormonal changes that are precursors to the movements towards spawning areas. The answer to the question of timing is further complicated by the fact that many populations of walleyes within the same system can spawn at different times and in different places. River run fish typically go before main lake shoal spawners. Both are present on Lac Seul. MNR biologists in the area have back calculated the strengths of differential year classes and have found that low water and/or a later spawn don't necessarily have a negative affect. What they have found is that cool to cold springs can result in a poor year class and can result in lower growth rates for other year classes. If it warms up quickly, this year's recruitment may be just fine. If it remains a cold slow spring, they may not do as well. Last year we observed a large number of female pike that showed signs of missing the spawn and resorbing their eggs. I would be surprised if last year's pike recruitment was strong. Like everything associated with fisheries biology, there are rarely simple cut and dried answers. There are many factors involved in any question at hand and there is definitely not enough money and manpower available to answer most questions with absolute certainty. I can only relay my opinions and observations and the conclusions of the area biologists that have studied some of the numbers. Mike Willems Silver Water Wheel Lodge"

A better question would be, if you were guiding in a few weeks, would you take your crew into shallower bays, or main lake pts, or....? I realize its an inexact science to say the least, but what's your best guess?"
573888,Guest,2008-05-14 11:46:00,0,"To keep it simple, find the warmest water you can and that means shallow bays usually away from the main lake. Areas of the lake that are isolated by narrows or shallow water zones from the main lake basins often warm up much more quickly than the main lake. If you find water that is in the mid to upper 50s at the same time the main lake is in the 40s, you are on the right track. Find the low 60s and you will find aggressive fish. Easiest answer- talk to your lodge owner. He/she wants you to catch fish and knows the areas that have produced in the past with the conditions you face. Have fun. Mike Willems SWWL"
