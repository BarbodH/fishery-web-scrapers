How and the world is that down? 2. Is just hitting them in the head easier? 3. Do most of you use coolers or line your livewell with foam for insulation so the ice doesn't melt so fast?

We fill the fish bag with ice & after killing the fish, put the fish in the bag & cover with ice. The nice thing about the soft sided cooler bags is they will fit down in your livewell & not take up any room in the boat. We have no problem with the ice melting when storing them in the livewell. Keeps the boat cleared from your coolers."

After afew minutes it goes into a kitchen waste bag and into the cooler. Our camp furnishs free ice so no cost for that. If you don't want to use the live well, snap the fish on a stringer and then cut it and throw it overboard for a few minutes."

A big whack with the pliers a couple times is not immediate death, causing the fish to tense and come time to fillet and cook them, you'll find the meat is harder (and there is the humanity aspect as well). Breaking the neck is instant death, and the meat stays more tender. Breaking the neck on a 17"" walleye is actually quite easy. First of all, bellying small walleye is the best way (and in my opinion the only intelligent way) to handle them. I see so many guys screwing around trying to pinch down the spiny dorsal fin, or grabbing them up behing the top of the head like you would a pike, which is going to get them nothing more than cuts from the gill plates....bellying a small walleye, unless you squeeze the crap out of it, isn't doing the fish any significant harm, and is by far the best way to not get poked or cut. So bellying the fish with one hand, simply take the head in your other hand, and quickly and continuously snap the neck back (i.e., moving the top of the head toward the dorsal). After doing it a couple times, it will seem easy, and like I said, is actually more humane than most methods. NWO Fishing Bum"
