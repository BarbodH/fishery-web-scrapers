574084,stevensinks,2008-05-20 14:00:00,330,We will going to Red lake in 2 weeks. Becouse we are comming from Kansas we will cross at Emerson MB. Anyone know how that is?
574090,prov1900,2008-05-20 15:59:00,544,"Northbound is easy, but we usually cross at just before sunrise. Southbound, at around noon or so may take a half hour at the most. This is really the fastest way to go, as far as times at the border."
574044,prov1900,2008-05-19 13:35:00,544,"Awesome. Thank you. We wanted to change up the route this year for some different scenery. The Dryden short cut would be great, although that is where we usually pick up our ""Suds and spuds"". We also don't go all the way to Sioux Lookout, as Minnitaki is short of there about 20-25 minutes. 4 days and a wake-up and I am there. Man, am I jacked right now."
574045,Guest,2008-05-19 14:12:00,0,"Road is fine as long as you keep your speed down.. In the spring last year there was still about a 20-25 mile portion of that road that had not been re-surfaced that was getting pretty rough. Again, no big deal if you are not trailering your boat. If you are, still no big issue as long as you keep your speed down."
574047,Guest,2008-05-19 15:18:00,0,"Hey Chef.......what's the route for the shortcut to get around Dryden? Can always use an additional 30 minutes somewhere else, instead of on the road. Thanks, Wallace"
574049,Guest,2008-05-19 15:31:00,0,Left on 594 just before you get to Dryden and then take a right on a dirt road (Adams Road) It runs into Hwy 17 at Oxdrift. Adams road is 3 to 4 miles on your right after you turn onto 594 you can see it on mapquest if you zoom in.
574051,sanmatt,2008-05-19 19:09:00,11,Another qiuck bypass of Dryden is to turn left on Gordon Rd off 594 just before you get into Dryden. This goes around the back side of the paper mill and comes out on 17 by the Ford dealership. It bypasses all of downtown Dryden and keeps you off a dirt road. It shows on Mapquest.
574065,Guest,2008-05-20 07:56:00,0,Thanks for the info!!! Good Fishin' Wallace
574072,Guest,2008-05-20 11:43:00,0,Can someone sum up when are the worst times cross into Canada and then come back to US?
574073,Guest,2008-05-20 11:54:00,0,Going north: Friday Noon to Sunday Noon. Friday afternoon Int'l Falls becomes a parking lot. Going south: From 8 am Saturday to 6 pm Sunday. I've had 2 hr. waits at midnight on Saturday southbound.
574079,ebuhr,2008-05-20 12:53:00,20,"FYI, we made a trip end of April through International Falls. Border guards made us pull over and come inside to fill out paperwork because we did not have a passport or proof of citizenship. They stated that this was a new policy. Passports or proof of citizenship are NOT REQUIRED but, not having them will require you to stop and fill out a form and answer some questions. Took about 20 minutes."
574080,Mohleye,2008-05-20 13:07:00,368,"Are you talking about crossing into Canada, or into the states?"
574001,Guest,2008-05-17 16:26:00,0,Does anyone have any tips on crossing back into the US at the International Falls crossing? We have been going to Canada for several years and hit the border around noon on Friday - there is not much choice as to when we get there. Last year the line of cars and boats had us waiting almost three hours. ugghh
574003,sanmatt,2008-05-17 18:23:00,11,"We have run into the same thing on Saturdays crossing at the Falls. We have gone to Baudette a couple times on the way back with no more than a 4 or 5 car wait, but it adds about 70 miles to our trip home. With the gas prices the way they are I figure I've got more time than money, so I'll put up with the wait."
574008,Guest,2008-05-18 05:09:00,0,WE LEAVE SOUIX LOOKOUT AREA ABOUT 3:30 AM.GET TO THE BORDER ABOUT 6 OR SO.NO LINES WHATSOEVER. RATHER SACRIFICE GETTING UP EARLY THAN WAITING FOR HOURS.
574010,Guest,2008-05-18 06:27:00,0,"On 2 different ocassions we have left camp very early (3:00 AM) and made it to Fort Francis to go the duty free shop which opens at 7:00 AM. If we get there much before 7, we go over to the Safeway store and either make a pit stop or just get some bakery for breakfast. Then, after the duty free shop, we cross over. Two years ago, the end of the line was at the north end of the railroad bridge. Last year, I expected a line and we pulled right up to the stop sign and waited for the booth to clear. No boat x-ray either."
574027,Guest,2008-05-19 08:53:00,0,"Early bird gets the worm when crossing, if getting some ZZZZZ's in the morning is worth more than waiting in line later in the morning......make your own choices."
574030,Guest,2008-05-19 11:00:00,0,We leave camp from Ear Falls before 4am to get to the falls early.. Anytime after about 9am and you will start to see some significant back ups. Get there by 7-8am and you should be thru in less than 30 minutes..
574033,Guest,2008-05-19 11:37:00,0,"Yeah but how's the moose situation early AM? We've considered waking early and departing 3:00 AM or so, but have always been concerned about smuckin' a moose!"
574037,Guest,2008-05-19 12:44:00,0,"You are going to see some moose that early.. NO getting around it. Since we usually take the Dryden road anyway, it is not that big of a deal. Most of those roads are in pretty rough shape and you cannot take them at tremendous speed anyway if you are trailering a boat.."
574039,prov1900,2008-05-19 12:56:00,544,">You are going to see some moose that early.. NO getting >around it. >Since we usually take the Dryden road anyway, it is not that >big of a deal.

We are considering taking it on the way up. I see from I-Falls to Sioux Lookout, it is 4 hours, give or take. Is that time based on a good road?"
574043,Guest,2008-05-19 13:22:00,0,The road is fine...We took it in the fall. It is not a four lane highway but it is what I would consider a nice Canadian road. There is a short cut around Dryden too that can save you close to 1/2 hour
