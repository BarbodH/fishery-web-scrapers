573969,Guest,2008-05-16 08:08:00,0,"Sunshine, wind, and showers resulted in big movement with ice on our end of the lake yesterday. Large sections broke away from shore and our rattling around with the wind shifts. We will have ice in sight for a day or two, but I think there is a good chance that the big lake will be ice free by the 19th or 20th. We haven't been out in boats yet, so the only question is how thick the ice was in the central basins. Mike Willems SWWL"
573971,Jigger1,2008-05-16 08:58:00,234,Great news Mike - hope you and the team have an outstanding season. See you five weeks from Sunday! Counting down the days. Jigger1
573990,Guest,2008-05-16 19:31:00,0,"AVS I think everyone is for sale if the price is right. The only commercial property that is advertized for sale that I know of is the old Lac Suel Airways Base. It has a motel,office/residence,house and a airplane hanger. Lac Suel Airways/Amik lodge operates out of Red Lake now. There is also a private cabin and property just to the north of the Lac Seul property. May 16 2008 will go down in my record book as the ice out day here. I got my floating docks in today. One of my neighbours got his houseboats in the water today and the other is flying his Otter in and out from his dock. The only ice visible is that piled on the shoreline."

573528,Guest,2008-05-05 16:55:00,0,"The south central basin is still white and tight to the shore. An optimist might be able to see a bit of gray, but that is probably just wishful thinking from a long winter. The forecast is improving, but we still have some 2 ft. snow drifts in the yard. It can go fast and it can go slow, but I would guess that it is going to be 50/50 for a full ice out by walleye opener on the south shore. We'll know more by next week at this time.

573529,JDP,2008-05-05 17:20:00,1457,Thanks Mike... Please keep us posted to significant changes. I like the look of your new website! JDP :cheers:
573840,Guest,2008-05-12 16:47:00,0,Any progress. How much ice is there currently
573857,Guest,2008-05-13 11:08:00,0,I just found out that the ice in Sioux lookout went out today but is snowing hard!
573884,Guest,2008-05-14 10:33:00,0,>I just found out that the ice in Sioux lookout went out today >but is snowing hard! Any word on Hudson or how far north on Lac Seul the ice is out??
573916,Guest,2008-05-14 19:09:00,0,Finally! It looks like the ice will leave our bay soon. Although there is only about a hundred feet or so around the shoreline there are large cracks showing in the ice. I can see sections of water out in the channel. It is raining now and there has been thunder in the last hour. It is calm but if we can get a little wind with the rain during the night and tomorrow it should be gone by Friday sometime.
573921,Guest,2008-05-14 19:42:00,0,Rob Where are you on the Lake? Do you any idea what it is like in the Mahkwa Lodge area? NE Piker
573957,Guest,2008-05-15 18:03:00,0,"Sorry I am a long ways from Mahkwa. I am west of Shanty and Steamboat narrows in what is known as Goose Bay. Same bay as White Wing, Little Beaver and Goose Bay camps. The ice is moving around nicely this evening. I would guess the bay is about half free of ice. There may still be ice around for a few days but we should be on the water for Saturday morning. Still no airplanes or houseboats in the water at my neighbours docks."
573968,Guest,2008-05-16 07:11:00,0,"thanks Rob... since you are on Goose bay, do you know of the camp that is for sale on Goose bay... would you be able to give me the name of the resort Thanks AVS"
573067,Northpoint,2008-04-23 11:57:00,38,Does anyone has updated information on whether the ice is out?
573069,Guest,2008-04-23 13:02:00,0,"Are you kidding? LS is normally still ice covered on April 23. This year everything was appearing at least a bit behind, if not really late, but good weather and above-normal temperatures the past two weeks have helped things dramatically. Large-footprint satellite imagery shows much of the snow in the bush throughout NWO has now melted. The same imagery showed complete snow-cover for all but a small area around Thunder Bay and Lake Superior just less than a week ago. That said, all inland lakes still have plenty of ice...like 2' worth! Only rivers and areas adjacent to running water are currently open, but spring has no doubt sprung. It's now just a matter of time, and specifically how much this region is exposed to warm temperatures, warm rain, and wind (which combined dictate ice break-up). The smelts are now starting to run in the Lake Superior tributaries (we got about 100 after midnight last night in just over an hour), as well as a few steelhead; signs that fish are into early-spring transition thinking. The last really late ice out on Lac Seul was 2002, when ice remained on the main lake until May 22, and opener (fishing the areas that were actually navigable) was really bad, with many walleyes completely missing the spawn. Thankfully, it now looks like things won't be backed up that far this year (crossing my fingers), but will still be a normal to later-than-normal ice-out. NWO Fishing Bum"
573076,Guest,2008-04-24 07:35:00,0,"Gary and I have a bet on ice out. After 50 years fishing lacseul Gary says May 5, I say May 1. In our 18 years at Lac seul Evergreen ice out is generally before mothers day week end. Dosen't look like ther will be a mad rush to get things going and water conditions continue to be great."
573079,Guest,2008-04-24 09:37:00,0,"Nwo, What is the satellite web site that shows up to date pictures? Thanks"
573480,Northpoint,2008-05-04 21:39:00,38,I would appreciate some information on the Lac Seul ice conditions. Thanks
573484,Whopper,2008-05-05 06:28:00,340,Lac Seul is still locked up as of yesterday
573489,Guest,2008-05-05 07:26:00,0,West end is open from camp to Steamboat narrows and ice flows continue to come down the river. This is an actual observation from a boat by Scotty at Golden Eagle. Good thawing weather forcasted for the whole week.
573491,JDP,2008-05-05 08:17:00,1457,"Thanks for the update Gary.... John Peterson Woodbury, Minnesota"
