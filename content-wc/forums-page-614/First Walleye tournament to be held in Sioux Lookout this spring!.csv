We have been informed that there are no Walleyes in Vermillion but a lot of Smallmouth, Northerns and Muskies which is fine. However we would like to be able to get a few meals of fresh Walleyes and again, have been informed to go to either Lac Suel or Minnataki. We are staying at the east end of Botham Bay, can you give us few ideas on where to go for the Smallmouth or it is basically around points, bars and reefs. As far as for the Walleyes, do you suggest Lac Suel or Minnataki and can you give us some ideas on where to go for the walleyes. Appreciate your assistance. Ron Wagner[email protected]"

The bite was a bit tough but we caught some quality walleyes. The biggest awas about 27"" with a fat-lined belly. There are some trustworthy sources of fishing information available to anglers and visitors. Please, I encourage networking and I encourage the sharing of information. It is the nature of my business and my business is FISHING. I hope to see and hear from a lot of out of town anglers this year."

For sure, I think that having a contest where the cash incentive (70% payout) dictates killing the biggest fish possible ...not sure if it is one per boat per day or two.....never the less the potential to kill 200 ""trophy potential"" walleyes is a step backwards in fisheries stewardship. Factor in the individuals who will cull out the smaller dead trophy fish to replace with a larger one caught later......don't believe it will happen with money on the line?....you are delutional. Who will be the first to question the ethics of the winner? Did he cheat to win? You will never know. What is the point? If it is all about doing something for the community then why not just award a trophy to the winner and put 100% of the cash generated back into the community? At least then your motives would be ethical."

572330,Guest,2008-03-20 22:25:00,0,"So with everything said in this section, the tournament is on June 13 and 14, so all those wanting some great walleye fishing come to Sioux Lookout and enjoy why we don't leave here... ah sometimes my life is so good... especially when I am fishing, then eating those walleye I just caught for a shore lunch with Lac Seul Fish Fry and Shore Lunch Spud, some beans and a nice cold wobbly pop... Its my right, so don't tell me it is not.... to fish that is... or run a tournament, whether it is catch and keep or release. With camps running thousands of guests up the lake everyday and feeding them walleye everyday, and catching tens of thousdands of walleye everyday, and making sure they take get their limit to take home at the end of the week, I like the fact that residents and guest will head out and partake in two days of walleye heaven... peace and lubb to all and to all a good day fishing..."
572331,Mohleye,2008-03-21 07:06:00,368,"One more stir of the pot, eh?"
572332,Northern Eye,2008-03-21 08:55:00,22,"It seems like it. I don't think it was ever stated that there should not be tournament or it wasn't right to keep fish. So not sure if this is a ploy for free advertising or to keep this at the top if the list but sure are some odd comments from a tournament committee. I guess I bit on this one, couldn't resist. I'll leave it at that."
574006,Lips,2008-05-17 21:05:00,8,"Just curious, were there any results posted for this tourney? I was wondering how the event went and what size fish were caught."

572044,lacseulfishfry,2008-03-10 17:59:00,5,"I am part of the tournament committee and I think that the format for this year's tournament is satisfactory. After some round table discussions with the local MNR we were able to conclude the following: Licence holders have the right to harvest fish. Tourist operators cater to non residents and expect exclusive rights and say about how the fishery runs in this area. Tourist operators and non-residents put the most pressure on our fishery... more than 85% of anglers are non resident. The MNR will and must remain neutral regarding the tournament. Most other tourneys are watching our format since they are constantly scrutinized for transporting fish all over the lakes all day long; resulting in a higher mortality rate. This format makes sense for this year and trust me, our community is trying to do something that creates social, recreational and economical value for those of us that live here year round. I catch hundreds of trophy fish every season, so believe me, I would prefer to release all females and trophies, but the MNR is not willing to look any further into exceptions to our catch and keep rule. Any further comments?"
572049,Guest,2008-03-10 20:13:00,0,"Please note, many years ago the MNR implemented a slot size regulation on Lac Seul and MAPB lakes. This slot size is suppose to protect the prime spawners, hence we are allowed to keep 3 under and 1 over slot. The limit at the implementation of the slot size was also lowered from 6 to 4 fish. We are working within the paradigm that is provided for these lakes, when it comes to angling and tournament fishing. There is no use of live wells and stringers, any fish caught and kept must be killed... those are the rules, if you break them you will be fined... sorry this just in...you can use live wells and stringers only if the fish is dead, this can be done be snapping its neck. Yours in fishing Cory."
572053,lacseulwalleyeguide,2008-03-10 21:48:00,32,">Sorry,not interested in killing healthy spawners for >competitions sake.What you do is certainly your choice. It was stated already 18-21"" fish are the healthiest reproducers, a proven slot, and that is why these lakes have the millions they do. One tournament, and a community fish fry, will certainly not even come close to the thousands of shore lunches eaten, each season. This certainly is my choice to compete, and I am #### proud of it, and welcome anyone who is interested."
572057,AllenW,2008-03-11 06:40:00,11482,"Campchef after thinking about it you do make a good point though. While I'd rather see a C&R tourney, the one limit per boat does a nice job of compromise, and I'm assuming caught fish will be eaten. I had a email from the Canadian DNR in response to my question on ""How is the existing 4 fish limit working to restock the fish population?"". Their response was that it wasn't to restock, fish numbers are fine, it was to keep it that way. Interesting email as it showed a very proactive attitude, I wish Minn had it that together. I did unfortunately discover with the new email format at work, is that after 30 days your emails get deleted or I'd post it. So it sounds the the people who are putting this on are doing the best they can with what they have to work with, and I doubt the MNR would let them put this on if they thought they'd have problems. Al"
572064,Guest,2008-03-11 10:59:00,0,"I fish a few C&R tournaments a year and really enjoy it. I'm a little concerned about the format. I fish Lac Seul quite a bit and one of the kill rule comments I have heard is that some fishermen may catch 4 - 15 "" fish earlier in the day then catch some nice 17"" fish a couple hours later. The 15"" dead fish then end up back in the lake. I have never practiced this (I do not allow people in my boat to keep anything over 18"") or seen this personally but have heard it happens. So with tournament money on the line do you think all teams will follow the rules that once they catch a fish and kill it that is it? I think it is a good idea for Sioux Lookout to have a tournament but wonder about this factor. Someone has a dead 22"" fish in their well then they catch a 28"" fish,mmm 4.5 lb fish or 7-8 lb fish. Tournament fishermen target big fish to win, so this is a bit different than a limit of 15-16"" fish..."
572068,HighTech,2008-03-11 16:32:00,75,"Congratulation to the Sioux Committee, I know you have worked with the MNR to come up with the best practice for this years event. I'm entered because I know that this will be a fun well run event with considerations for the fishery thought out. I grew up in this area and I fished this system in the 50's. I caught fish then and I still catch them now because of the regulations in place. This tournament respects those regs and in fact goes beyond them. One thing I find as I get older is that people want a ""perception"" of the truth as apposed to the actual truth. Catch and release sounds so reassuring, like non polluting gas from corn, etc etc.. Watch closely to the weigh ins at major tourneys and some of those big fish in the water basket on the scale are upside down! As far as participants cheating at tournaments, thats a topic that could fill this forum. I participated in a local tournament where an individual was caught and convicted of cheating. He cant work, play or show his face in the area without that coming up. Is your reputation worth a few thousand dollars? The opportunity to cheat is endless in life, I feel sorry for those that do. This is an excellent opportunity for Sioux Lookout and will in the long run enhance the area and the fishery."
572069,Northern Eye,2008-03-11 17:17:00,22,"I do not disagree with the comments made but who is going to enforce the only one fish over 18"" rule? If teams are checked by MNR they are not breaking the law for having two fish over 18"" so not sure how you can get fined. I guess it just leaves some loop holes. I know that fishing people are good folks but when there is money on the line. I know that your reputation may be on the line but I think the case that is mentioned was a bit more serious than breaking one rule.."
572074,Guest,2008-03-11 20:46:00,0,"It is a long held and strong belief, of the people of Sioux Lookout and surrounding areas, that our natural resources are here to be shared with those that choose to partake in its splendor. We hope that you respect the fact that this tournament is well thought out and not hastily slapped together. Those running this event belong to many of our communities non profit organizations, and is built on a model of sharing in and benefiting from a place that we call home 365 days a year. This is not just a promotion of walleye fishing, but a showcase for a wonderful town that we all love and want to share with you. So I ask, is keeping a couple of fish, donating them to a non profit organization to provide a fish fry in order to raise a few dollars really such a bad thing. Is holding a tournament so awful, when its host non profit organization, by its mandate, has to return its share back into some form of conservation initiatives within the community. Should we argue, when lines of communications are open between many organizations either directly involved or on the periphery. Do you care that we are trying to provide a new source of income to help keep our Royal Canadian Legion afloat for another year or two or many many more. These are but a few small things we are trying to do, in order to provide our whole community with another positive and fun event, where many organization, residents and guests can come together and enjoy our small town, its people and the beautiful scenery and fishing."
