573893,joeman79,2008-05-14 12:51:00,417,Going to Red Lake first week in June where is the cheapest place on the way to get a flat of crawlers? Anyone know what the going rate is this spring on a flat? Thanks Joe
573894,Guest,2008-05-14 13:01:00,0,Which way are you going up? If you go through Nestor Falls the Sport shop has them for 72 per flat.807-484-2525. If you call in advance they also will have your licenses filled out before you get there.
573895,phishfearme,2008-05-14 13:23:00,1242,if you go thru ignace - vern's minnows - they were $50 last year. phish
573896,Guest,2008-05-14 13:29:00,0,Last 2 years no one had them openning weekend around Ignace. You could buy them by the couple dozen but no flats. Not even Vern's.
573898,phishfearme,2008-05-14 13:37:00,1242,the opener is like rush hour - had no problem later in the season - call first and reserve them.
573899,stevensinks,2008-05-14 14:00:00,330,"I have always bought them from Vrens, good worms and about the same price as here at home. This year we will be comming from the west so we wont be going through Ignace. On the 6th we will spend the night in Kenora then go north to Red Lake. Is there any place along that way to get them in the $50 range or should we just take them with us. Thanks"
