573880,REG,2008-05-14 09:41:00,445,Steve W My group will be on Pakwash on the 31st - so not too concerned about the ice out. We stay at Snake Falls and do pretty well in front of our camp or at some of the other places you mention on the north end or at the Park beach. And we've gone as far as the Trout where it comes into Bruce. But I'm not familiar with the pumphouse that you mention. ?? Where is that? Good luck to all - leave us a few. Rich
573908,Guest,2008-05-14 15:53:00,0,"Reg. Pumphouse is that series of cat tail bays directly to the south of the entrance to East Lake.. Should be hot there opening week.. By the time you guys get there, I would have a very difficult time not spending significant time in Lost Lake. The walleyes will be regrouped and solid in Lost Lake at that time. Also, try the beach by then as well.. Depending upon the weather the fishing there can be stellar as well... Best of luck to you.."
573948,REG,2008-05-15 12:04:00,445,"Thanks Steve We've seen boats in that area as we passed through but we haven't tried it before. And wasn't aware that was what it was called. We've had a little bit of luck in East, but have had better luck in front of either river - Trout or Chukuni. And you're right - if the wind is consistent for a couple of days, the beach can be fantastic. Lost is a ways to drive, but we may have to try it again. Was in there one year without great luck but have heard that it can be good. Might have to pack a lunch. Good luck to all. Rich"
573780,LunkerG,2008-05-10 21:54:00,12,"Does anyone have any information on ice out conditions on Pakwash lake? We are heading up there for the Walleye Opener and are wondering what, if any , open water is available at this point and the latest predictions on when the lake might break free of ice? Thanks."
573790,Guest,2008-05-11 07:58:00,0,Bring and auger and some dead bait. Good luck on getting in. Hope there is a big river near your cabin. Although is suppose to get near 55 this week up there. GOOD LUCK
573806,LunkerG,2008-05-11 16:52:00,12,We are actually staying on the Trout River on the north end at Brownlees. Is it open and is any of the north end of the lake and/or the Chukuni River area in the NW portion of the lakd open that you are aware of or have heard? Thanks for the information.
573839,Guest,2008-05-12 15:18:00,0,Hello. Mr Bring an auger are you from up north or have inside info. Sounds like alot of the lakes north and south of Pakawash opened up in the last few days. We are leaving for the opener later this week and would also appriciate any info from up north. Thanks
573841,Guest,2008-05-12 17:44:00,0,LunkerG one of the guys from our group told me the ice was off on pakawash. Just found that out today. My dad is going to call up there to confirm that tonight or tomarrow will inform you when I find out. Will be up there at the same time stay up the chunki river. If you see a black 1775 lund with 2 adults and 2 kids say hello. I am sure we will be jigging in the mouth of the trout. Later Walleye Fred
573842,Guest,2008-05-12 18:11:00,0,"The ice is not off Pakwash yet. I would be very surprised if it was off for the opener. My earlier prediction for the 12th/13th will be missed. Was just talking to someone who lives on the lake and said the bay at the park is only just starting to melt from shore on the south end. I live in Ear Falls and went to Dryden today. Some of the smaller lakes on hwy 105 are ice free and others like Perreult still have lots of ice on them. The way things are going (slow) I would not be surprised to see ice on Pakwash 'till the end of opening week. Hard to believe in ""global warming"" this year. Lac Seul is still mostly ice as well."
573846,Guest,2008-05-12 20:34:00,0,Thanks for the update we must have got some bad info. we will be staying at the north end do you think with rain and wind we will beable to fish the mouth of the chunki river i know that is spelled wrong. and maybe able to get to the trout with out much problem. Thanks again. Later Walleye Fred
573852,LunkerG,2008-05-13 06:23:00,12,"I had heard the Trout River was open but have not heard anything about the Chukuni river and the NW section of Pakwash, or Highline Bay, for that matter. I would like any information about those spots right now and also status on East Lake as well. I've got the goo really bad!! With this late ice out, the northerns will be going wild!!"
573868,Guest,2008-05-13 16:45:00,0,Hello Ice out you sound like you have alot of knowledge on Pakawash with the weather the way it is do you believe that we will beable to get from the chunki river to trout river by sat morning or afternoon. we checked with a lodge on the trout and it sounds like Bruce lake should go tonight or wed. What is your prediction. Your info is much appriciated. thanks much walleye fred.
573871,Guest,2008-05-13 22:12:00,0,"Hey Lunker G, You have got to be a buddy of Jon Boyds based upon your description of your level of excitement. Is Jon heading up this year?? I am betting with the late Ice out that those bays around pumphouse are going to be loaded with quality walleye and pike. In fact Bruce Lake might be the place to be on opening week!! Hopefully the ice will be off enough so that Highline and Trout River bays are open and you guys might be jigging some monster walleyes in the mouth of the river as those fish come back into Pakwash. Walleye, our camp owner tells me that the ice was still holding on strong in the bay with the camping beach; but that temps are scheduled to be above freezing both day and night now for the next several days with rain... I would think that this combination would do it.. Other than complete ice off or someone heading out in a boat, I cannot think that there is any way to tell about getting from snake falls over to Highline.. Iceout lived on this lake for a few years so he would know better than anyone else, unless someone ventures out to see what progress they could make.. I am a week away this Friday and looking forward to seeing some nice fish in the near future!!"
