Here is my bid to get Uncle Lar to go. The ""old fart of a brother is 48 and this could be my first year of going to Canada without him. We are planning a trip to Caribou in 2010 but that is not going to be good enough."

Weather was tough, snowed one day. Found something interesting about Minnicou Creek. Went there on Thurs and had a great day, especially all the way up by the rapids. A number of other boats were there as well. Came back on Friday and caught just two fish! In just one day, the fish were aparently gone!

573992,Guest,2008-05-16 21:25:00,0,"Scar, we are leaving Thursday night and should be to camp Friday around 5:00. We will likely go for a boat cruise to get settled in. If you guys are going to be in camp we will take a trip on over. I hope the recovery is going well. I have booked a cabin at the Betty Ford clinic for the week when I return to recover. Should be a great week. We have a guy that with a few jokes that can give ya a gut ache. I plan on a great time and looking forward to meeting the crew on the island. (6) day and counting!"
573996,scar,2008-05-17 06:21:00,196,"1/2 our guys will get to the cabin on wednesday and the other 1/2 on thursday. unfortunately, i'm a thursday arrival. have a great trip! scar"
573010,Guest,2008-04-21 08:16:00,0,We are staying at Timber Edge Camp located on Butterfly Lake. This is my first time at Timber Edge Camp. This is my (9th) Canada trip and 6th time to Minnitaki. I have stayed at Donnelleys the (5) other times. Donnelley's Camp is a great place. Darrell and Allen take great care of their guests. We stayed at the Cline Cabin which is on the southeast corner of their resort.
573011,Guest,2008-04-21 08:17:00,0,"Scar, how well do you know Lac Seul?"
573017,prov1900,2008-04-21 10:18:00,544,"Well, if you are near us, we will be in a red 19 ft IFS, hence the name. We will be on channel 88."
573025,Guest,2008-04-21 13:57:00,0,We will be an 18 foot Princraft--cream and burgandy--we plan to go to Donnelleys to say hello to Darrell and Allen. We will look you up.
573026,Guest,2008-04-21 13:58:00,0,"Prov, how many years have you been going to Minnitaki?"
573033,scar,2008-04-21 19:37:00,196,">Scar, how well do you know Lac Seul? started fishing it about 4 years ago. when we put in at the deception landing we head up towards bear narrows. best time to fish that area is in may. it is awsome. just look for the guides boats from andersons or big wind blown points when you get past bear narrows. fishing is fast and most eyes over 20."" about a 50 minute boat ride with my lund explorer and 115 optimax to get there but well worth it. in late june/july senn bay is good, about 45 minutes away in a more northeast direction. if we put in at hudson landing only a 10 minute ride to some spots on lost lake. if conditions are good though we will always head for bear narrows or senn bay. i bought the navonics canada chip and updated it last year. not quite a no brainer because of changing water depths and rocks that come out of no where but we have had no problems finding our way round around. everything you've heard about lac seul is true. even the unbelievable if it looks like it should hold fish it probably does especially if the wind is blowing into it. we fish exclusively by backtrolling with crawlers and spinners with in line weights or bottom bouncers. if the bite is strong we turn the kickers off, quit back trolling and jig. may is mostly jig only. stop in at the cabin for more info as we will be there working in may. coffee is always hot and beer always cold. can't miss our place on neepawa as we now have 2 large cabins on the property with tan siding and green tin roofs. there will be lots of boats by our two docks -one in the sandy bay by the new cabin and one off the rocks by the older cabin. my lund explorer is red with 2 black mercs on it. scar"
573034,prov1900,2008-04-21 19:52:00,544,"This will be my second year (in a row). Was going to Lac Seul regularly and someone in our group promised that this lake would be as good. He was right. I got a 43"" pike last year, my biggest, plus all the big walleyes we wanted plus one 10 lb laker. Oh yeah, the smallmouths weren't bad either. I was sold to say the least, but I would also go to Lac Seul anytime. I guess I like Minnitaki because the runs aren't nearly as far and navigation seems a little easier for what its worth. The pike, laker, smallies and all of the bigger walleyes were released. Like Lac Seul, it is one heck of a fishery."

573046,Guest,2008-04-22 07:46:00,0,"Scar, we will definitely be by. We arrive Saturday around noon. By the time we get on the water it will be around 2:00 or so. Just a good day to get on the water and wet a few lines. I plan to head to the Rice River area on Saturday so will try to stop by. Let me know if you have a hand held radio. We will have one with us. If you have one please let us know what channel you will be on."

572959,WalleyeWagon3701,2008-04-19 04:40:00,7,"I am looking for information on the direction of the water flow on Minnitaki Lake around Neepawa Island and Phantom Island. I have been to Minnitaki Lake 5 times but have focused on Red Pine, Trout Fish and the Arm. Additionally, does anyone have any experience fishing around Neepawa Island, Strawberry Island and/or Twin Pine Island. Will be going the last week of May. The Rice River is a protected area until June 16 but looking to stay just to the north of the mouth of Rice Riverto hopefully get onto female Walleyes post-spawn. Fish-On Uncle Lar!"
572973,scar,2008-04-19 21:18:00,196,"have a cabin on neepawa and have fished the lake several times during the period you are asking about. this is a tough time in that area as the walleyes are still in the sanctuaries so thick you could almost walk across them. the fish that are out are very scattered in may-a few here and a few there but no real awsome bite anywhere yet. the minnicau creek area is usually real good and all the other ""normal"" advice holds true. wind blown points and islands will hold some fish. we used to think fishing the bays and areas as close to the sancturary as possible would be productive but those spots never really paid off. even though red pine is actually open for catch and release only we would still go and have a blast in there and then try to find enough around neepawa for a fish fry. scar"
572974,WalleyeWagon3701,2008-04-20 05:55:00,7,"Scar, thanks for the note. Can you comment on the direction of the water-flow in the lake? Additionally, what about the islands just south of Abraham's Chute?"
572977,scar,2008-04-20 07:11:00,196,"not sure what you mean by water flow. the only places there is any type of current really on the lake is where minnitaki pours into abram at the chute and around the english river. i did forget to mention the chutes as one of the best spots on the lake for that time of the year. there will be a lot of boats there though and you will need a very good anchor. lots of presentations will work at the chute -jigs,bottom bouncers or cranks. all other parts of the lake are mostly jigs at that time but backtrolling with spinners/crawlers to find fish can be real successful scar"
572982,Guest,2008-04-20 08:02:00,0,"All of the water in the English river system flows north, rice into Minnitaki, into abram, pelican, then Seul. Eventually this water empties into the Hudson's Bay....long canoe ride though..lol"
572996,WalleyeWagon3701,2008-04-20 18:58:00,7,"Scar, thanks for the info. What date do you anticipate ICE-OUT and post-spawn? Scar, when do you plan to br in the Sioux area ?"
573000,scar,2008-04-20 20:10:00,196,will be at the cabin for a work week may 22 - 26. lots of work as we built a new cabin on the property and are finishing the inside. will find some time to fish though. stop in if that is when you are up. have 2 more summer trips planned-june 14 -21 and july 21 - 25. will spend a lot of time on lac seul towards the end of the june trip and a couple of days during the july trip. minnitaki is good but lac seul gets in your blood after a few 100 eyes days. hard for me to predict ice out as i live in wisconsin but from what iv'e heard and read i would say(guess) somewhere around may 5-8. scar
573002,scar,2008-04-20 20:18:00,196,"ww, just went back to your original post and saw that you fish in trout fish bay. we have a lot of time on minnitaki and no one from our cabin has ever even ventured into trout fish bay. is it a decent fishery and worthwhile? scar"
573008,WalleyeWagon3701,2008-04-21 06:10:00,7,"Scar, read your last (2) posts. We will be on the lake the same time as you will be in late May. We will look for you throughout the week. As far as Troutfish Bay, the north shoreline has a rock island that protrudes southward from the shoreline a good 30-40 yards. Depending on the water depth is may be visible. This was a very good area for walleyes as is the island that is to the southeast of this point. If you continue to the northeast corner of the bay you can pick up pike. We spent a great deal of time in Troutfish just working the islands."
573009,prov1900,2008-04-21 08:03:00,544,"WalleyeWagon, Where are you staying at that week? We will be up there the same time at Donneley's."
