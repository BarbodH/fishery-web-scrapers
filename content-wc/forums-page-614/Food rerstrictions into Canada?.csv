573987,Rather Be Lucky,2008-05-16 16:33:00,256,"Heading to a new destination in Canada next Sat. Normally would buy most supplies when there, but will be traveling thru when most places will be closed. Won't be going to town till mid week. Wondering if there are any restrictions on potatoes and meat or other food groups. I know one is allowed a reasonable amt of food and know the rules on alcohol and bait but don't want any trouble with any food groups because of my stupidity. Any Help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. Swede"
