573966,Guest,2008-05-16 02:46:00,0,I haven't been up in that area for 10 years but back then it definitly required a portage. With water levels down the last few years I'm sure it is no better now.

I did not even get close, once you leave flat rock it does not take long for that area to become very trecherous with large rocks just below the surface everywhere. On the map it did not look far. I agree there would be some draggin involved. Have taken a canoe into dollar lake from flatrock, that is just a little over a 1/10 mile hike alot of bog and northerns, fun little adventure. Will be back up to flatrock the 2nd week of June. I have fished this lake on and off for over 20years among others. We usually target the lake trout as they can run large here. good luck GF"
