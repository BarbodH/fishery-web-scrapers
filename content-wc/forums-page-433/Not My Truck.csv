His is the only truck we trust to pull a trailer full of gear for 8 guys. Is there an issue with driving a truck across the border that is registered to someone else? I know this is a potential problem going into Mexico but have never done this going into Canada."
1443156,Pooch,2012-05-31 11:55:00,4619,I think you better have some notarized paper work with you. Maybe even more so getting back into the States. This has come up before so search around this forum.Your buddy must really trust you guys! What about insurance? You normally need a different insurance card from your insurance carrier for going out of the country.Pooch

I ride with the first group and the second group has taken my truck several times with no issues. As long as it is not reported stolen by your buddy, you will be fine."
1443212,swany_jd,2012-05-31 13:31:00,9,"I know we get asked every time through Int'l Falls/Fort Frances which person the vehicle belongs to. But the owner has always been in the vehicle so we've had no issue. Might be worth a call up to the border agency to get advice on your specific situation. If Pooch is right about having notarized documentation, definitely worth knowing ahead of time. Insurance wouldn't be an issue I don't think as the driver's insurance would become the primary policy."
1443258,@Lunker,2012-05-31 15:30:00,835,X2 what Pooch said about the notarized document. Prolly also have some kind of insurance verification that you're covered. Nice friend though......
