1443149,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-05-31 11:43:00,84,Can anybody give me a LOW water level update? I checked the control board and see where it is slowly coming up. Can someone give me a visual check on that? Those numbers from the control board doesn't help a guy like me too much. I see Lac Seul is going up big time so be careful if you are going there. 7 days 3 hours 20 minutes. Slowest week of the year followed by the fastest. Thanks
