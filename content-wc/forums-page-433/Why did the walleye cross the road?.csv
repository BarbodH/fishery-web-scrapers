1443488,81Saluki,2012-06-01 08:29:00,97,"I knew I could count on y'all to come up with good answers. Awesome!! All were better than what I came up with. For what it's worth, my favorites were:""He was heading to the catch & release lake on the other side."" and ""Maybe the walleye heard about shore lunch?""Keep 'em coming!"
1443682,HeHooksHimself,2012-06-01 17:52:00,725,He wanted to go hunting.

1442245,hommer23,2012-05-29 16:05:00,523,The water is clearer on the other side.
1442255,JayM5209,2012-05-29 16:28:00,1050,'cause he heard the Old Grandad was in the cabin over there!
1442266,tooski,2012-05-29 16:38:00,393,I vote for Terwalleye... Sorry Phish.
1442284,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-29 17:01:00,298,I agree. Loved it.
1442357,Terwalleye,2012-05-29 19:37:00,166,"Membership is a state of mind. Our group has always talked about how fishermen ""Get it."" And by that we mean MOST are patient, helpful, realize that it's not always about catching. That spotting a moose or eagle is just as good as catching another fish. And that a quality time with good freinds on the water is as good as it gets."
1442414,P. Norts,2012-05-29 21:26:00,396,"It's not very funny but, ""Because he could""."

1441906,81Saluki,2012-05-29 07:26:00,97,"Just saw this pic from the Thunder Bay area over the weekend. I'm not very witty and would love to hear what some of you come up with to the question: ""Why did the walleye cross the road?"""
1441908,wallydave,2012-05-29 07:28:00,2151,Maybe the walleye heard about shore lunch?
1441924,Rivratz,2012-05-29 07:53:00,105,"It will be hard to top your punch line! Of course said best, heard about the ""FREE"" shore lunch!"
1441928,Freytown,2012-05-29 07:58:00,770,"""Why did the walleye cross the road?""Cuz, the chicken told him."
1441970,phishfearme,2012-05-29 09:01:00,1242,"and going into the back stretch, it's phishbiscuit by 10 lengths over hoof hearted."

1442061,tv4fish,2012-05-29 11:37:00,2694,"So he could get to the other ""size""."
