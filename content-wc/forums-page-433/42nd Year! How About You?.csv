The next year Mike and his dad joined a hunting and fishing club and wanted me to join and I did..this group of 16 went to Rainy Lake for the walleye opener..the place was called Mudges Camp..we stayed in a huge cabin that slept all 16 of us..I was paired up with a guy called Kaz who was Mikes best friend as Mike was going to fish with his new brother in law..me and Kaz have been fishing partners ever since.. After about 4 yrs of going there me and Kaz wanted a change..in a nightstand drawer I found the brochure for Cedar Lake Lodge from 1981..called up there and booked..we've been going there ever since..we've gone up with as few as 4 guys and with as many as 16...the present owners are the 3rd ones since Ive been going..I did miss one year in the early 90's..cant even remember why ...but it was the year they got 11"" of rain for the week, never got out of their rainsuits..part of 105 had washed out but was repaired when they left ..they said when they went thru Nestor Falls, cars in the lot of the flyout service were under water. We know the lake and where to fish but still, every year, we develop a new spot or two...cant wait..we leave in 13 days and 7 hours.."
1443260,big popi,2012-05-31 15:36:00,635,"My grandfather started going up I believe in 1967, to the floodwaters of the diverted Siene river near Atikokan. It was diverted for the Iron Ore mine back in the 40s. Nothing but a red graveled washboard road from town and then down a 6 mile ""road"" to the camp. Gramps would take his big Diplomat motorhome down this road, sometimes one of the rear duallys would hang off the edge of the road. He got to spend his last 15 summers when he retired fihing the spots. I first went up in 1972 when I was 10 with my brothers, sisiter, parents, grandfather and some cousins. At that time we could still camp out without staying at a resort. It was truly a kids paradise, hiking around throwing rocks and all the kid's stuff. the older I got the more I would fish, learned how to run a boat, great memories. Learned how to fillet fish, first debonning then filleting with my cousin for the whole camp. As I got older, missed some years while in the Navy & living out east. Starting going regular back in 1990, took my wife & her son up just before we got married, pretty much our honeymoon. Now my son (didn't make him, but he's mine) is taking up my grandaughter who is 2-1/2 for her 1st trip this year, hopefully for many more to come. Grandpa died some years back, mom put his ashes in one his old tackle boxes so she could cross the border. She spread him out on his favorite spot. Each time we fish it, I throw him out a snack. Maybe I can make another 20 years, one can only hope."

1435938,Guest,2012-05-15 19:38:00,0,"My first trip was to Onaway lodge in 1977 in think. I was only 10 and accompanied my grandfather, parents and brother to the Lac Seul for one **** of an adventure at just an early age. Little did I know at the time, my grandfather made the trip in an attempt to buy the camp but it did not work out so he bought one down the road just a few miles towards Perrault Falls. Made a trip the next summer to Pa's camp and fell in love with the place. He sent me out on the lake by myself with a 3 HP evinrude and told me to keep the life jacket on. (I still cringe thinking about sending my son out on the lake at this age....) My parents had the privilege of acquiring the camp after grandpa died and I spent every summer there until I left for the Navy. It's been 26 years since I left the area and it still feels like home to me. My brother and I will be making our third trip to Canada with our boys in just a few short weeks and they get just as excited as we do now. You could say we are hardcore in regards for the north! My grandfather would have been proud of us. He told us stories many times about traveling up 105 North when it was only a gravel road and a two hour trip to Vermillion bay. What I would give to fish with him just one more time!"

1436017,unclejoe,2012-05-15 21:51:00,22,"I have a lot of history going north although I can't remember the exact number of times its probably at least 10 trips with some big gaps. My grandpa, Scotty Cook used to own an island in Lake Abrams across from Frog Rapids. Dad was too young not that interested in keeping in family so Grandpa sold in the early 80s. Perhaps fishing skips a generation? My first trip to Sioux Lookout was 1974 when my mom was expecting! I am 37 now. Growing up we would vacation and hang with grand parents and do day trips on Lac Seul. My grandfather fished Lac Seul from early 60s when he bought the island on Abrams. After he sold, my grandparents still spent every summer in Sioux Lookout. His last trip to Lac Seul was 1995 I believe. He passed in 2001. I can't exactly recall how many times we went to canada when I was young but, I know that we stopped going around 1990.Knowing that my dad was not too excited about going north again, I finally took it upon myself in 2006 to start going back north. I initiated a fly-in trip with friends that year and every year since we have been going. Last year we did a house boat trip on Lac Seul and will be going again the first week in August.Although my dad did not catch the canadian bug, he did hang on to all of Grandpa's old maps. Last year Dad sent me a box of maps that he had. In the box I found just about every main lake you read about on this board, EXCEPT one. I called Dad and told him that the Lac Seul map was not in the box. Dad said that it must have been lost or Grandpa never gave it to us. Dad called two weeks later and said he remembered where the Lac Seul map was, THE TACKLE BOX! He overnighted the map to me and we used it on my first trip back to Lac Seul last year (since I was there in late 80s).Anyway, I have this map in my possession now and it's an unbelievable treasure of spots on Lac Seul spanning my grandpa's walleye fishing career from the 1960s. Being back on the water hard to believe he covered so much of that lake. p.s. he did not have a gps 30 years ago so the X makes you work just hard enough"
1436384,Rich B,2012-05-16 15:06:00,1081,"Uncle Joe - I enjoyed reading about your family's history north of the border and your Grandfather's fishing maps. I, too, had a grandfather that had a passion for fishing, though his son (my Dad) never got the bug....my twin brother and I both love to fish (especially up nort, so maybe the fishing ""bug"" can skip a generation....though both my son and my brother's son also love to fish, so go figure ?). Those maps are a true family treasure.....no doubt you'll pass them along to your children one day. Thanks for sharing.....by the way, I started fishing Canada back in 1986 when my boss and friend talked me into a trip up to Lady Lake Evelyn (north of North Bay). I had a great time (didn't catch anything more than shore lunch that trip) but I was hooked, and have taken my family up north when the kids were growing up, and now my wife and I go up (as well as a separate trip with my buddies). All in all, much to be thankful for....I leave in the morning to drive up to Perrault Falls. Rich B"
1442512,Kevin R,2012-05-30 07:19:00,305,"I still think its funny looking back at that first trip in 1965 I was 7 at the time, Dad & Grandpa had been up a few years back but complained about the awful roads. Well the friend of the family told us it was four lanes all the way, talk about a tall tale. It had been a few years going west bypassing Eau Claire Wi. So when we went thru Eau Claire we kept thinking anytime it would turn into four lanes but never did. For those that remmber 53 north of Eau Claire was two lanes & went thru all those small towns heading to Duluth. We left at 5AM from Chicago & we made it to Virgina by dusk. The next day we would cross the border at 9AM. When we crossed the border into Canada it was miles of one lane dirt roads stopping for dynamite blasting all the time. It took a long time getting to Eagle Lake about 3pm we would arrive."
1442637,sptrix,2012-05-30 09:40:00,175,"My first trip was to Ten Mile Lake in 1984 after begging my dad, for what seemed like years, to take me there. Dad isn't much of a fisherman, but he loves spending time with his kids, so I think he really enjoyed the trip, despite us not catching many fish and getting mauled by bugs. I was able to go back to Canada with him again in '90 and then he didn't go back again until 2008. However, in between I caught the bug. Beginning in college I was able to get groups of friends together to try various experiences: * 1990 - Quetico * 1993 - Quebec (Sasseginaga) * 1994 - 1997 (Whitefish Lake area, Ontario) * 1998 - Reindeer Lake, SK * 1999 - Whitefish Lake area * 2000 - 2004 - Lake Athapapuskow, MB * 2005 - Nungesser Lake, Ont * 2006 - 2011 - Lynn Lake area of Manitoba We've, like all of you, caught thousands of fish, many trophies and had our fair share of issues, obstacles and challenges. But . . . there isn't one experience that I'd trade for anything, and I cannot wait until my son (who's 7) is old enough to tackle a trip with me. We'll probably start with something easy and work our way toward the big stuff as he gets older. In the meantime, I'll continue to work on my fishing knowledge so that he can catch fish when he's ready to join me. I leave in 21 days and cannot wait to get there again. Ice went off the lake Saturday! SPTRIX"

1429470,wallydave,2012-05-01 20:07:00,2151,"Been making the trip North off and on since 98. When we are fishing, we try to find the ""pattern"" where the fish are and what are they biting on. My pattern has been two our three years in a row, then take a break. Sometimes it has been a matter of the group not able to set a week, sometimes it has been work and formation priorities. Yet despite these ""off"" years, a smaller group has been getting together to make memories along the shores of Lac Seul! At times I have just wanted to see if the ""fire was still in the belly"" Yup still there! Nice to figure this pattern out!! Next figure out where the walleyes will be the week of June 16-23!!"

Enjoyed the ""roughing it"" of paddling/portaging for 10 years or so and the fishing was fantastic most years. Had a bad back in 2003 and tried a drive in camp on Wabaskang Lake. Didn't catch many fish (due to ignorance) and didn't try boats again until 2010. Went back to Wabaskang, caught fish, and actually bought a boat last year. Don't plan on missing a year until I rest in my grave. Last two years have been with my son (13) and this year my daughter (11) will be going. Still want to introduce the son to the Quetico experience but not sure I can pull him away from Wabaskang. It's the highlight of our year and we are really starting to learn the lake. Will be at Jim and Julie's on Wabaskang June 23-30 this year. 13 of us!"

1430157,Mike Kansas,2012-05-03 09:26:00,1463,First trip was in 1955 at the age of 10 with my Father and a couple of his employees. Have missed a couple years since than and many years have gone 2 or 3 times. I think I have to been Canada fishing a total of 84 weeks during the last 57 years which is 2.8% of that time. Wish it was more but every trip has been great. There is nothing like spending time on a Canadian lake with a buddy or a family member. While the fish catching and the scenery is great the relationship building in such a relaxed atmosphere is the best part. Thanks to all the Outfitters who have provided such great service and let me enjoy their hospitality. Mike Kansas

So have fished 59 years and still looking for the 30"" walleye.Took my brother-in-law two years ago and he caught and we released three over 30"". He had never fished for walleye and was using the lures I make. I guess I should just start a guide service."
1434589,Kevin R,2012-05-12 20:55:00,305,"I have heard the story many times growing up how we started going. In the 1950's our group went for many years to Lake Pokegama in WI, in 1960 my Dad built a boat 18ft x 8ft beam he put 60hp Atwater Scott outboard for power. At the time this was consider a big boat after all the boats they used on Pokegama were 12-14 ft oars for power. In 1960 the fishing declined in Pokegama & they found dead fish floating all over the lake the result off over development poisoning the weeds to make for better beach areas for swimmers. Well after seeing all the dead fish they decided to go further north packing up the boat & gear off to LOTW by Souix Narrows. The first group was four & they camped on an Island the entire stay. They told of how clean the water was & the fishing was great but the roads were not. So the next couple years were in MN on the Whitewater Chain of lakes, great boating lakes but just average fishing. 1965 is the first year I went to Canada all because a friend said how improved the roads were 6 of us went to Eagle Lake our group averged about 10 most years peaked at 17 but now it's just 2. The first year I went we had a wooden camp boat (we didn't bring our boat) the next year the camp changed to all aluminum boats, we started bringing our own boat in 1973 the year the group was 17 people. The year we went to Red Lake 1969 & Wabaskang 1970 we had fishing like I never have experienced again it really seams so sure real compared with the fishing of today in those years anybody could catch fish even from the piers both numbers & size these were in the days of meat hunters & when the word got out they flocked to get the fish."
1434658,rpieske,2012-05-13 06:42:00,1276,"Wow!! I expected to be the winner on this one, but Bill Krejca beat me by a mile. This will be my 60th year fishing muskies on LOTW. Always out of Nestor Falls, but sometimes on fly-in trips from there. You are right about the passion. And the older you get the more it is about the beauty, peace and fellowship than the fishing. Good thing because I just can't fish 16 hours a day....every day of the week. But then, I get to spend 3-4 months per year on LOTW, so that makes up for it."

Taking my youngest son on his first trip this year and my oldest boy has been on 3 previous trips. Next year, planning 2 weeks, I'm not getting any younger.

I started the thread only to exclaim my extreme passion for fishing Canadian Shield waters! If you only made the trip once, at least it has fulfilled a Bucket List item in the grand scheme of your life! I have introduced Canada fishing to many friends over the years, very few had the desire to return. Gone up many years by myself, even when I had offered free transportation! Their loss, zero passion! I had a choice this summer, a vacation with the wife and kids in Maui, or, fishing in Canada by myself for a month. Aloha family!"

I camp most of my trips for the major wilderness experience. It also is much less expensive. You would be surprised what you hear camped in the bush, than a cabin in some camp. Also, you would love what you don't hear. Racket from the other cabins, doors slamming, loud talking, radios, car noise, etc... etc... Again, Aloha Family"
1429280,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-01 13:04:00,1460,"That's as cool of a story as it gets! Thanks for sharing. My Dad still has my family record for walleye @ 29 3/4"". May he rest in peace. I have often wondered how I would feel if I broke that record. I kinda think Dad would want me to. It has been 41 years for me making the joyous trek to Ontario. Of those 41 years, I have never had a bad trip. Some are better than others but there has always been something rewarding to bring home. Like so many others have eloquently said, It is not so much about the fishing anymore as it is who we are. It is my heritage."

Usually the month before the trip, the local weather will taunt you with cooler days and sunny blue skies that we find up North! The best advise I can give is to check out your camps website, check-in here, check your packing list, tackle box and other gear. Get your passport, license and outdoors card ready. No it might not help with the wait, but all of these things are a distraction that can soothe some of the symptoms of the dreaded ""walleye fever"" Take pics of your trip from day one, make a few notes in a journal, have a great trip!!"
1429065,HeHooksHimself,2012-05-01 06:03:00,725,Here is the paradox re: the rate the days pass leading up to your trip. The week you are there is the fastest week of the year!

1429090,nd89sc88,2012-05-01 06:32:00,92,"First, let me say how jealous I am of those on this board who've been able to go to Canada so many years in a row. I'm 45 years old, and I vividly remember the first time my dad took me to the Canadian side of Rainy Lake when I was 17 or 18 (not sure if it was before or after my birthday that summer). We knew not a darn thing, and went there only because a lot of my dad's friends had been going for years, and promised to show us the ropes. It was a revelation . . . not that the fishing was that great (this was before slot limits, and it sucked) . . . but it was our first visit to a Canadian shield lake. Neither one of us had ever seen anything like it. The raw power and beauty of the place was breathtaking. We've been going back, on and off, for past 27-28 years. I wish I could say we made it every year, but we haven't. Life, school, work, and kids have all gotten in the way at times. There were stretches where we went every year for 5 years, and stretches where we went 5 years without going. Recently we've had the chance to get both of my daughters there to pass on the magic of the great Canadian wilderness to them. Unfortunately, I think last year was the final year for my dad. He's not that old, 72, but each year seems more unsure of his ability to handle it, and told me he doesn't think he can do it again. I'm crushed. I've told him that he doesn't have to ""do"" anything, but sit in the boat and reel in the fish. I'll be his guide, dock boy, cook, and maid, but he still says no. I'm still working on him to do an August trip with me (when the weather should be warm and nice). In the meantime, I'm starting a new tradition and will be heading to Lost Island Lodge with a buddy the week of the 4th (I'm hoping this is the new place to begin taking my daughters in the future). I can't wait, but I also know it won't be the same without my fishing partner. Miss you already, Dad. Bill"
1429096,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-01 06:39:00,298,"Grew up in MN fishing NW Ontario with my folks. Took many canoe trips into the Quetico with my buddies while in high school and college. Moved away for 30 years and really missed it. Landed in South Dakota in 1995, got remarried in 1997 and spent our honeymoon fishing Lac Seul. Been back every year since.

At risk of being declared a heretic and exiled from this site, my experiences have taught me that fishing and catching fish, while important, is not the most valuable thing in these annual trips. New sights, time with old friends, a trip with a son or daughter, sitting around the cabin table for another cup of morning coffee as the rain pounds down, . . . . . and, yeah, catching some walleyes for dinner.JayM"

1429193,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-01 10:14:00,298,"Just a little side story. My folks started fishing in NW Ontario long before I was born. Not sure exactly when but I believe it was in the early '30s. In 1940 my Mother caught a 28# pound Lake Trout in Lake Mameigwess and had it mounted. No one in our family has ever beat that record while fresh water fishing. She passed away in 2005 at age 94. Up to, and including, the day she died, she never let me forget that she held the family record. I now have that fish hanging on the wall in my home."

I now live Colorado, in the Rocky Mtn. foothills, at 7,500 ft. elevation, with over 300 plus days of sunshine, on the edge of the Arapahoe Natl. forest, where herds of elk roam all over, deer, fox, bear, and the occasional mountain lion, 4 traffic lights in town, hundreds of miles of hiking trails out my back door, etc, etc... All because my dad turned me on to Canada! Used to live in Chi town burbs. Can't wait to spend a month in Minaki this summer! Rivratz ~ The Lone Wolf"
1428894,Jigger1,2012-04-30 19:06:00,234,"If I'm counting correctly this is year 20 for me. As a kid we went regularly until my parents built a home on a lake in northern WI when I was around 16 and this became our playground for years. Once my Dad passed away we sold the place because it was too much for my Mom and we were over a 1,000 miles away. Have now been on a 13 year tear and don't see an end in sight. Over the next 20 years I hope to log close to a year of time in Canada!"
1428908,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-04-30 19:21:00,84,"23rd year for me. 37th for my dad. Four other guys in our group. 37, 22, 20 and 17. We are a bunch of lifers. 36 days until we are headed back to Lake of the Woods. Can't wait."

1428953,JayM5209,2012-04-30 20:39:00,1050,"This'll be year 34 for me. My son and I are doing our 1st fly-in mid-June. His 1st year was a 16th birthday present from me, 30 years ago. Each year gets better . . . . and more important."

1428974,rnnonmt,2012-04-30 21:08:00,992,"First went fishing with Dad in 1982 until 1992. A young pup at 10 years of age. Went to college, moved across country, finished college and started a family. Finally made it back and started taking my son at age 9 three years ago. Haven't been up there consecutively since 1982 but sure wish I had been. This year will mark 15 times. I started going back in 2008. I wish I could find executive jet maintenance work up there within a bicycle ride of Lac Seul."
1428988,Golden Eagle,2012-04-30 21:23:00,2642,"53. First trip was not as a youngster. Had finished school, spent a year at Ft. Knox, spent a year in Korea and taught/coached 2 years before fishing the North Channel, near Desbarats."

1429011,BennieS,2012-04-30 22:27:00,108,"Well, i'm still waiting to go for the first time. 31 days. I'm beginning to think that the guys on this site are holding out on me, so everyone please stop the charade. There's some kind of inverse principle regarding time that sets in about 40 days before you leave right????? Every day from 40, as you inch closer to leaving, the days take longer right? To get from 40 to 31 seems like it's taken around 6 months. Someone help me please and tell me it doesn't get worse. At the rate the days are passing I'm gonna be like a hundred before I ever get there. Geez at the rate the days are passing by i hope there is still an Ontario and a Canada by the time I get there. It's maddening and i now think I know why noone talks about it."
