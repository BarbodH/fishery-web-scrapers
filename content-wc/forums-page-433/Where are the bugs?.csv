We usually go in early June to Sioux Lookout. What am i doing wrong? I do remember getting out of the boat to look for a old cabin on a fly-in lake years ago. Fifty feet into the woods i started to fear for my life. I wasn't sure if i would die from the lose of blood or just suffocate from the numbers. But out in the boat nothing. Seams like August is the worst time. I hate the ankle biters.

1443050,wallydave,2012-05-31 08:09:00,2151,After trips to Ontario in late May early to mid June and early July I have been bitten just once by a mosquito. Our July trip and noseeums well those pesky critters were busy! Many a small island has looked like there was a camp fire due to the cloud of bugs and we have killed a few insects in the cabin over the years. Dusk is when they seem to get active. My favorite plan for prevention is a twofold approach Deep Woods Off and Cuban cigars!!!

Normally, at night, the wind is nonexistent, and I feel that is why the buggers start bothering, as they then can fly with a minimum of effort. Portage carries can be especially uncomfortable, as the mosquitoes(and others) like to hang out under the canoe (out of the wind), and one's face is especially vulnerable, as both hands are in use carrying the canoe. Brings back a lot of memories just thinking bout it. A particular evening I will never forget was many many years ago when Dad and I sat anchored on LOW, just out from a swampy creek in late June. The walleyes and crappies were biting, as well as the mosquitoes, however it was still bearable. As the darkness progressed, and the wind completely stopped, a strange buzz-like sound began emerging from the woods. The sound became louder. It was the sound of quadrillion gazillion mosquitoes, and they all were heading our way. Suddenly, there were so many bugs in front of us that they clouded our ability to see clearly. It was at that time that we pulled anchor and headed back to camp. There are some memories, no matter how ""mature"" we may become, that we just never forget! As to ankle bitters, I wear high top leather work shoes when up north, keeps the buggers from attacking my ankles during the day and evening. Bill Krejca"
1443117,packpro,2012-05-31 10:30:00,695,"Mosquitos mostly on the portages. Sometimes the noise from a swarm is surprising loud. Always seems worse when your hands are full carrying gear. We never get the ankle biters until the first fish flops onto the bottom of the boat. We usually see them on dead calm days. If there is even the slightest breeze we do not see them. Recently we have had a few more tick and no see um issues, especially on wet trail portages. If it is bad enough we fight over the anti-itch pen like crack monkeys."
1443146,Bigstorm,2012-05-31 11:38:00,799,"what is a no seeum?Regarding the skeeters, we never have problems with them as long as we are at least 100ft offshore. They were bad enough that we started filleting the fish in the boat out in the middle of the lake.Sometimes the flies like to hang out in the boat and bite ankles, but a little (or a lot) of bug spray fixes that."
1443158,Guest,2012-05-31 11:57:00,0,we do tent camping and portaging and all of our fishing from canoes. the misquitoes are real bad on portages if you arent prepared. i wear long pants and a long sleeve shirt(tucked in) all day every day. the real light nylon stuff that dries quick and prevents bugs from biting. i wear neoprene socks on portages to avoid the bugs and light duty work gloves. i also have a misquito head net for portages/cooking/filleting fish. we go mid june on our trips and the bugs are not bad during the day(except horse flies) but at night the woods buzzes with bugs. seems around 9pm(sunset) that it gets really bad. all of our night fishing is trolling where i wear gloves and the headnet.
1443170,wallydave,2012-05-31 12:18:00,2151,Noseeums are tiny little black bugs. We get them in the summer in Cen. Il. There bite is ten times there size!! If you haven t been bit you are not missing anything!!
