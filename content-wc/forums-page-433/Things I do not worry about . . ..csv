1443358,Rivratz,2012-05-31 20:05:00,105,"I don't have to worry about... All of the things mentioned that you all don't worry about because I totally ""PREPARED"" for the trip before I left! So, no worries! Thanks to all the great advice from fellow Canadian fisher people on this site. Just so I have enough credit on my C card for fuel to get home."
1443395,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-31 21:42:00,235,"I don't worry about getting skunked on a fly-in lake. I don't worry about getting bad service from our outfitter, Kabeelo Lodge/Airways. It's been excellent for multiple decades."
1442341,hommer23,2012-05-29 18:57:00,523,"1.) the scratch in the boat from beaching for lunch.2.) blood in the boat it cleans out later.3.) the cost of anything, that goes for any vacation.4.) whats for dinner as long as I have a cup of coffee in the amWhat I DO WORRY about, nothing."
1442347,NARDA 1,2012-05-29 19:08:00,636,"The things I do worry about. (this list is shorter)1. Will the lodge run out of ""RYE"". (Won't happen, they kmow better.)"
1442353,JayM5209,2012-05-29 19:27:00,1050,"Yep, that's Dakota. Seven years old last week. Rescued from the local humane society when he was 1 1/2 years. Wherever I go, he goes . . . except he's never been to Canada. He keeps me grounded and relatively sane. Best companion dog I've ever known."
1442507,Bigstorm,2012-05-30 07:13:00,799,"Once I'm up there, I dont worry about anything. Before I get there, I only look forward to getting there"
1442577,tv4fish,2012-05-30 08:24:00,2694,The time that we spend up there goes by WAAAY too quickly.........
1442745,wallydave,2012-05-30 12:53:00,2151,.The only time I think about work is on the way home. And Ilike what I do but everybody needs to get away have fun and relax!!!!
1442751,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-05-30 13:13:00,138,Someday soon I hope to leave it at home. In the mean time I've got 2 conference calls and will spend an hour or two on email next week on Eagle lake. It is what it takes for me to pay for my vacation.
1442756,REG,2012-05-30 13:20:00,445,"How many fish I've caught. (Caught is not the same as kept*) No offense to all who like to keep running and daily totals (and their 100 fish days). Maybe it's because I've had my kids in the boat for so many years and I refuse to get into the whole ""who caught more"" thing. Life revolves around competition, numbers, goals, budgets, and other endless counting exercises the other 51 weeks of the year. But not for one short week in Canada - so no counting on my boat - or at least keep it to yourself. I have good catching days and great catching days, but in the end, they're all great days that go by too quickly. (*I do, however, keep very close track of how many are in the livewell, fridge, and freezer. NO going over the limit.)"
1442759,Mike Kansas,2012-05-30 13:33:00,1463,I only worry about one thing. 1. Is my Landing Net to small? Mike Kansas
1442792,IA Nate,2012-05-30 15:15:00,12,1.) What colors work best. (We have them all and it always goes back to chartreuse.) 2.) How much the fine is for beer in the boat. 3.) The 502. 4.) Customs officers on either side. 5.) Duties on either side. 6.) How well the wifi works at camp. 7.) Where or how to cook shorelunch. 8.) Calories and/or carbs. 9.) Blue vs. Kokanee vs. Molson 10.) Cell service north of Ft. Francis.
1442026,JayM5209,2012-05-29 10:24:00,1050,"When planning for and then enjoying my annual trip or two to NW Ontario the things I do not fret about include:1) The currency exchange rate2) The price of gas in Ontario3) How many walleyes I'll catch each day4) Whether or not I'll bring any fish home5) Duty charged on excess alcohol6) Meeting an OPP or MNR officer on the water7) The possibility that high winds or lightning may keep me off the water for a day8) The date of manufacture of my trailer tires9)10)Getting old, I guess, . . . but don't fret about that one either. Anyone want to add to the list?"
1442030,camp chef,2012-05-29 10:38:00,915,1 I don't care if there is construction or detours2 I don't care if I have buy my potatoes in Canada3 I don't care if the bugs are bad4 I don't care if the moon is not in the right phase.5 I too am getting older and I don't care about that either
1442033,Terwalleye,2012-05-29 10:43:00,166,"Just a short list to add1) By far #1 is wether or not my cell phone works2) Whether my partner or I catches the monster, I just wanna see the darn thing."
1442041,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-29 10:50:00,298,1) All of the above2) The amount I spend on live bait

1442090,JJJMN,2012-05-29 12:09:00,153,What I don't worry about. 1. Wife asking me to take a couple more trips to Canada each year with my brothers. (won't happen) 2. Walking around with too much money in my wallet. (married) 3. Camp owner refusing to take our money. 4. Wasting bug spray 5. Too strong of Sun Screen 6. Live well not large enough (4ft) 7. Over charged trolling motor batteries 8. Rocks I can see
1442094,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-05-29 12:20:00,84,"1. The Blue being cold. 2. That accidental 40 something muskie you catch while trolling for walleye. 3. How many times a night the baby will wake up.( got a 7 week old, wife is hating me at the moment. Still going though in 8 days."
