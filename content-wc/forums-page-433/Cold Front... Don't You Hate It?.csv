1441557,Manitou,2012-05-28 10:47:00,125,"I finally made it out to my camp on LOTW, and man it has been miserable this past weekend. It was like October, cold wet rainy and blowing. Felt like I should have been closing up the camp rather than opening it."
1441583,Skywagon,2012-05-28 11:35:00,1106,"I know. I have been wanting to get out and fish, but just can't get in the mood with this weather. Feel sorry for those that only have a few days here, they have no choice but to put their rain jackets on and tolerate it."
1441767,RickOnt,2012-05-28 18:22:00,217,I hear Ya Thats why I have a boat with a top and they make Rain GearRick
1442029,Hammdog,2012-05-29 10:36:00,11,"The cold front really hurt the fishing and the ability to stay on the lake from time to time. To top it off we caught the walleye in their post spawn lock jaw mode for the second year in a row. Oh well, only 354 days until next years trip."
1443665,Manitou,2012-06-01 17:06:00,125,I saw a couple of small muskies up spawning around the dock.Things are still slow.
1441011,Rivratz,2012-05-26 15:16:00,105,"When you plan your trip, your week in Canada finally arrives, and a low pressure cold front moves in for 4 or 5 days. Then, the day before you leave, the sun comes out and fishing picks up. Or, when people say, ""you should have been here last week""! Then you have to wait until next year. Seems to look like a low pressure cold front has been over Ontario. I wonder how the fishing has been the past few days? Probably real slow! That's why I won't go until mid June. The weather seems to be a lot more stable."
1441015,wallydave,2012-05-26 15:34:00,2151,Last year first week of June we had fronts moving through allow week. The fishing some of the toughest we ever had. We still ate walleye a couple times a day and we came home with our limit. We will at Goose Bay in three weeks!! Like you we hope for better waether but you never know what the waether will be! No matter what we are still there instead of at work!
1441033,RickOnt,2012-05-26 17:03:00,217,Hey WDWe will be there June 9 Ya can never plan for the weather!!Rick
1441060,wallydave,2012-05-26 19:04:00,2151,"The only way to plan for the weather is to bring everything you own, cold, hot, dry and rain gear!!!Even then, there will be something else you will need!!"
1441064,RickOnt,2012-05-26 19:29:00,217,"WDI hear ya on bring a little of everything!I have been swimming in June and under 4""of Snow!!Fishing has always been good!!!Rick"
1441065,Rivratz,2012-05-26 19:33:00,105,"When the fronts pass through and you are slammed by 4 foot waves on Big McKenzie! You want to alway's plan on good weather!!! But you must ""PREPARE"" for bad weather!"
1441098,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-26 22:32:00,235,Go in July or August.
1441110,Ogoki,2012-05-27 05:17:00,291,"When I started flying in I went with my farmer cousin. We would go the last week of July or the first week of August ,since that was the best time for him to get away. When I started going with him and the group I put together I wanted time between the two trips,so my group went in June . I found the last two weeks of June to be the best of the whole summer. More stable weather than the first two weeks of June , as a rule . The unstable weather makes having eight days on the lake better . You have time for the lake to settle back down and the fish to bite good again . I also have seen the last week of August to be real good some years . All depends on the year .Bottom line is you are in Canada fishing and not working . I always try to learn and adapt to the conditions ."
1441168,81Saluki,2012-05-27 08:07:00,97,"I agree with everything said. Been there. But how do you *really* know it's the weather and not something else (e.g. bait, presentation, location, etc.)? Answer: I bought an underwater video camera and have learned A LOT!! It also won me a couple of bets when we'd be at one of our honey holes and a buddy swore the fish had lockjaw. Upon lowering the cam in the water, they simply weren't around. Now-a-days, if we haven't gotten a bite within 10 - 15 minutes at a hole then I'll put the camera down. If no fish are around, we move to a new spot with different structure. If we see fish, we start changing things (size, color, technique, etc.) until we find something that works or we give up."
1441247,3M TA3,2012-05-27 11:44:00,2846,I've always liked fishing situations under low pressure conditions. In fact some of the best fishing has been had under those extended 4 or 5 day lows. I personally think that it's the actual pressure transition that turns the fish off. 'the sudden change so to speak.
