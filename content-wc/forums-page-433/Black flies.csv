1444105,TIGHTLINER,2012-06-03 05:33:00,223,Just returned from a trip to the nakina area last week. Weather snow rain sleet and wind for the first 5 days of the trip and then the sun broke which brought the flies out the last day they seemed very eager to consume all the blood they could from the us citizens. The may fly hatch was also starting to heat up. Leaving for a trip to the ramsey lake area this coming weekend so i am sure both will still be on. Any reports from the that area?
