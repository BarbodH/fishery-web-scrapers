1443079,Rivratz,2012-05-31 09:09:00,105,"I just received an e-mail from Duane at Paradise Cove. Duane stated that the cold, wet weather is finally exiting NW Ontario. Excellent weather is due to arrive with 60 to 70 degree temps, with some warming sunshine.That's great news for those planning to leave this weekend! I know there are those skeptics out there that don't believe what the longer term forecasts predict. I like to believe that satellite imagery, Doppler radar systems, and advanced meteorological technology, forecasters are better prepared nowadays. Weather is like women, totally unpredictable. Why do you think we call it ""Mother Nature""? A man made saying! Duane had stated that a lot of eaters, and some nice sizers were being caught despite the poor weather. Fishing should really start to pick up with stable weather returning. Duane had also sent me some pictures of some beauty fish being caught. Duane also sent a few pictures of Gary Roach ""Mr. Walleye"" with some huge smallies that they had nailed. Gary has is summer cabin in Minaki. Gary Roach also has a walleye tournament in Minaki every August. Anyone can enter their boat with a team. You don't have to be a pro to enter. Some pretty decent cash prizes! T minus 16 days til launch, staying at least 30, I might stay 44, and topple my 43 days in a row record set in the mid 80's!"
