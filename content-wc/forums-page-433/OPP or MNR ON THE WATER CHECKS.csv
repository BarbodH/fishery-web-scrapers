Thus, it is my understanding that you don't need signal flares with a boat longer then 16' in Canada if you are there less than 45 consecative days. Duran"
1441578,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-05-28 11:29:00,138,If you are registered in Indiana you will need a life vest for everyone. Boats 16' or greater will need one throw-able one (Type IV). You will also need a signaling device (whistle or horn). Basiclly life jackets and a whistle for fishing boats from Indiana fishing for less than 45 days in Canada.

1441879,bcmss396,2012-05-29 06:35:00,296,"Technically the requirement to only comply with your state of residence requirements is accurate. For ease of doing business in Canada, we opt to comply with their rules and requirements.We are from Wisconsin and in the past we've been checked for pretty well all of the items mentioned (Flares, throwable, fire extinguisher, etc...). IMO, it's just easier to live by Canadian rules than have a debate on their waters with either OPP or a Canadian Game Official.They understand and know their laws, not ours.Blair"

1442593,Sportfisher,2012-05-30 08:39:00,47,"Last year, (first trip to Ontario fishing for me) 3 boats in our group, fishing a semi secluded bay on Minnitaki. I netted a nice walleye for my wife, and looked up and the entrance to the bay was blocked by a white boat that appeared to be anchored. We then looked over at one of the other boats in our group that was fishing closer to the entrance to the bay and saw the CO board the boat. We waited for our turn and the CO checked for all safety equipment and looked in the live wells. We passed no problem. We heard later than a boat not in our group was checked and there was beer on board. The fine was $100.00 per beer. Been duck hunting in Sask for over 20 years, and only checked once."
1443256,Dogbreath,2012-05-31 15:25:00,494,"Boaters in Canada have to follow the provincial regs where they live. Visitors to Canada who bring a boat have 45 days during which their boat must comply with the regs in the country where the boat is registered. After 45 days, the boat will have to comply with provincial regs. Re the fire extinguisher, it is required in Ontario if you have a built in fuel tank and/or onboard cooking facilities. If you visit from the US, and your boat has a built in fuel tank, a fire extinguisher is not required (but it is still a good idea).The official link below goes into more detail.Happy boating.....http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety...tors_to_canada"

1440452,cast_and_blast,2012-05-25 07:26:00,1098,"Folks...read the regs for Ontario. Unless you and your boat are in Ontario for 45 continuous days you DO NOT have to comply to their regs (flares, etc.) - you do need to comply with the regs from which your boat is registered. Example - my rig is registered in MN so I comply with the MN regs even when I'm in Ontario for a week. Snippet from the website: How the Regulations Apply to Non-Residents The Regulations apply to non-residents:  If they operate their pleasure craft in Canadian waters for more than 45 consecutive days or,  If they operate a pleasure craft that is licensed or registered in Canada (including rented or chartered boats).  The Regulations do not apply to non-residents who operate their pleasure craft in Canadian waters for less than 45 consecutive days. Please note that a proof of residence will be required on board at all times. And here is the whole website: http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety...sitor-1610.htm Don't make this harder than it needs to be - read the regs. Scott"
1440458,tv4fish,2012-05-25 07:38:00,2694,"Safety Equipment Requirements Foreign pleasure craft (pleasure craft that are licensed or registered in a country other than Canada) need to comply with equipment requirements of the country in which the vessel is usually kept. If you are not a resident of Canada and are using a pleasure craft licensed or registered in Canada, all of the required safety equipment must meet Canadian safety requirements. However, you may opt to bring your own PFD for your own personal use."

Two things not mentioned in prior posts: 1) you must have on board a bailing device (or manual pump), and 2) you must have 50' of floating line for a throw line. Note, if you have polypropylene line it will float, but it's not heavy enough to throw to someone in the water. Get creative in thinking of something to tie on the end so you can heave it (like a dog training dummy!).Most outfitters provide the required equipment, but if it's the 1st trip to a camp or with a new outfitter, check before you go. I don't think the law requires them to provide it even though most do.Oh, one more . . . . I think Ontario changed the rules last year so that a floating cushion does NOT count as one of the required PFDs - must be wearable.And . . . .did anyone mention the required waterproof flashlight?_____________________________optimax, I was typing when you posted. You beat me to it!"
1440564,v-bay gord,2012-05-25 10:35:00,3168,"The camp owner is responsible for having all the necessary safety gear on rental boats. There is also a ""rental boat safety checklist"" that must be gone over and signed by the customer and owner. If you are bringing your own boat from the U.S. then you must have all the proper safety gear required by the state you live in (not the requirements of Ontario, although they are probably similar anyways)"
1440626,Rivratz,2012-05-25 12:43:00,105,"Great information being exchanged! I started the thread hoping to inform, and get people thinking about what you will need while out in the boat. I knew I would forget something. Thanks to the guys adding to the checklist! Camp owners are responsible for the rentals, boat items, except for ID's, licenses, and fish possession limits. Just because you're on some remote fly-in outpost, you could be checked. If an unscheduled float plane lands at your outpost camp, be prepared! They're not there to refill your beer and ice. It will be a camp check! Hopefully your possession limits aren't over, and all fish are within the legal size requirements. OPP hires outfitters aircraft to do spot checks on outpost camps. The owner of River Air, out of Minaki, told me this."
1440712,Campcountry,2012-05-25 15:27:00,164,"I get checked once or twice a year. The last time was two weeks ago, All I am ever asked is for my fishing license, have I caught any fish, is there any fish back in camp, and they want to look in the livewell. I have never been asked whether I have all of the required safety equipment and I don't think they have asked whether I have booze on board either. I don't think the COs are thinking that is there job. Checking for safety equipment would be done by the OPP but The COs don't seem to be interested in doing so. I have never been checked by the OPP on the water but they do go out especially on long weekends."

I was not checked for more than 25 years or more until I took my landlord to lac Seul during a Memorial Day weekend in 2000. We were checked three times in one day Once just after we left the dock as he was hiding in the weeds and twice on Minnitaki within 30 minutes of each other. Never again ubtil last year on Lac Seul. Very nice folks for the most part. Don't seem to be on a power trip. Read your regs booklet that are usually available at all resorts and bait shops. No need for breaking rules and certainly no excuse for not knowing. One more little diddy youroutdoors card must accompany your license. See ya on the water!! Jim"

I also like when I'm asked to show my ID when using my credit card . . . Better than having someone using my stolen card and racking up the charges because no one ever asks. But, what do you need if it's a rental boat you are in? Do the lodge owners often provide all the required equipment with your boat, or are there things you should bring with you, just in case? I do bring my own PFD because I have one I like, and I'm comfortable wearing it anytime we are at speed (but not while fishing). Thanks, Bill"

1440394,F250,2012-05-25 05:23:00,75,"Thank you, Rivratz, for beginning this informative thread. I believe a bailing device and a heaving line are also required in Canada. Most tackle shops and Canadian Tire stores carry those orange, 1/2 gallon sized, containers that have most of the required safety equipment in them. Regarding a situation where you may be trolling when the enforcement vessel approaches you - I would suggest maintaining your course, and wait for instructions from the Officers. They may require you to pull up and stop, or they may be able to complete the compliance check while you are moving."
1440399,CI_Guy,2012-05-25 05:45:00,2118,"In MN when you renew your registration the stickers are in 3 sections. 2 have the year the registration is good thru on them that you stick on the side of the boat by the reg numbers. The 3rd section looks like your fishing license, it has name & address of the owner, make & model of boat, VIN # and registration #. That's the registration card. Minnesota also requires it to be in the boat at all times."
1440415,81Saluki,2012-05-25 06:21:00,97,"Bill -- We bring our own boat. But if I understand things correctly, the camp/lodge/outfitter you are renting a boat from is required to provide ALL necessary safety equipment in their rental boats. Furthermore, they are required to review all equipment/rules with you and you have to sign a document/check-list stating that you received such instructions.Maybe some lodge owners on here will weigh in whether this is correct or not.81Saluki"
1440416,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-25 06:22:00,298,How about a fire extinguisher? I thought they were required.
