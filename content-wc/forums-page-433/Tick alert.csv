Issue is that it's not for direct skin contact, but works well on clothing and an application can last for up to 6 weeks. Hang you clothes on a hangar and liberally spray them all over. Let dry, then wear."
1443486,BrianinVA,2012-06-01 08:23:00,160,"Permethrin is extremely toxic to fish and other aquatic life. DEET is toxic to fish as well, but not nearly as bad as permethrin. Both are affective on ticks. In any case, use caution with any bug spray to make sure it doesn't end up in the water.Also note that 100% DEET is not more effective at preventing bites than lessor percentage DEET sprays, the higher concentration just protects you for a longer period of time. I rarely need to apply bug spray on the water, normally only do so while in camp or when portaging, and find the window of time when it is needed is actually quite small. While I have 100% DEET in my supplies, I normally opt for the lower concentration because it's cheaper and marginally better for my health and the watershed. REI has a great write-up about choosing a bug spray."

It kills ticks or other insects when it comes in contact with them.""http://www.amazon.com/Sawyer-Permeth..._bxgy_lg_img_b Also, when looking for 100% Deet products to my knowledge you wont find it in Spray version. You need to look for the Pump Spray variety. Ben's; Off; Repel all make a variety."

We stopped on the 105 on the way up to relieve ourselves and everyone one of us had ticks crawling up our legs looking for a warm hairy place to hook into us (no one wants that, right?). On the way up when we stopped we went several steps into the brush and one guy had 7 ticks he removed. One guy has an iron bladder and he got none. I had three.On the way back, we stopped on a pull of and two guys took one step into ankle high grass and both had ticks on them.Careful out there folks!"
1443300,Lazy Fisherman,2012-05-31 17:19:00,276,Thanks for the heads up tick alert.
1443328,Rivratz,2012-05-31 18:42:00,105,"Ticks are a deadly foe, because of Lyme disease. Wet spring weather is the time of year that ticks are abundant in numbers. Try to avoid grassy and brush areas if you can. If you have to portage through those areas, apply a potent Deet spray on yourself. Even if you are wearing boots and long pants. Deep Woods OFF spray does not have a great Deet percentage in its formula. The name is stronger than it's effectiveness. Find repellents with the greatest Deet percentage in it. You don't want to find a tick, or ticks, in your personal grassy and brush areas."
1443338,wallydave,2012-05-31 19:25:00,2151,We can always count on Hooks and so many others here on WC. One year some veteran members of our group had the same problem. It is always something to remember that we are in a different environment up North. No one wants to have a trip ruined by things like ticks or other things that we will find in the great outdoors. Stay safe and fish hard!!
1443356,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-31 20:03:00,298,The strongest I've found is Repel Max with 40% deet. Anyone know of anything that is stronger?
1443369,Rivratz,2012-05-31 20:34:00,105,"I have a Deet repellant called ""Maxi Deet"". Manufacturer is Sawyer Products. It is 95% Deet and 5% isomers. The label reads 100% Deet. I believe I found it at Dick's Sporting Goods? If you can't find it, or something similar, their address is; Sawyer Products, P.O. Box 188, Safety Harbor, FlL. 34695 Maybe you can google search the company to get their tel. #, or website address."

1443400,RapShad,2012-05-31 22:09:00,76,Gotta second that on Ben's. The little orange bottle does wonders! Your lips will be numb for hours too! That's when you know you have the good stuff
1443465,dog2,2012-06-01 07:35:00,198,"Visit your local army navy surplus store and buy the GI issue lotion.

We portaged through very thick bush to get there and the ticks we literally falling onto us in numbers I have never seen before. This is by far the worst tick season we have experienced. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
