Year 1 - caught a 29, 2-28's, 2-27's, 2-26's & 2-25's for a total of 9 over 25. Last year I caught 15 over 25, but my top end was 27.5 with 4 over 27. A fantastic year, but I've yet to crack my first year at SWWL and I have no plans to give up trying!!!"
1424859,ILBassman,2012-04-22 20:16:00,16,"Coping response from thread Mahkwa :I am making my first trip into Canada the first week of June, staying at SWWL. What is the one thing you wished you had brought with you on that first trip? what is the one thing you brought the first couple of years and say ""why did i bring it I never need it""? Response from:Jigger1""Well if you ever saw the Cabela's Super Magnum tackle box you'll understand what I regret bringing on my first trip to SWWL. Fully loaded I might as well have had a dolly to haul that thing around. Since I was driving at the time, I came fully loaded with every conceivable walleye setup you could imagine. Plugs, bottom bouncers, slip bobbers, jigs of every possible type, hooks, sinkers, spoons. Seriously I could have almost set up shop and started a retail outlet on the dock. I think that entire trip all I used were jig heads, that's it. I am now refined down to a very specific set of jigs (mainly focused 1/8-3/8oz in size), bottom bouncers with crawler and minnow harnesses and some plastics. I still bring a few crank baits and spoons just in case the pike or bass bite is on, but because I fly now, it all fits in my backpack. Plus if I'm missing something, or something is hot, Mike has a selection of productive lures right there in the lodge. The second thing was equipment. On my first trip I was lucky enough to catch a 29 fat walleye but quickly realized (thanks Cory) that my equipment wasn't geared for this kind of quality fishing. At any time on this body of water you have the chance at catching the fish of a lifetime, more than once my equipment has been the cause of failure so I chose to minimize this risk and invested in a Loomis Walleye series jigging rod, I now own three Loomis rods, one for jigging, one for bouncing and another for casting. They are used in that order as well, with casting being used very infrequently. They fit in my rod case so I bring them all for flexibility. Lastly I had crappy rain gear my first year, I now own Guidewear and love it. When LacSeul picks up, sometimes the boat ride can be as wet as a downpour. Keep an eye on Mike's reports as he'll let you know what's going on through his fishing report. We should probably start a new thread under SWWL if you want more info, I'm sure many guests, IA Walleye being another would jump right in. ""Jigger1, thank you for your detailed response, I am re-visting the tackle I have packed, since I am driving up, I think I was falling into the trap of taking too much. This also would be only my 2nd time walleye fishing. As I usually fish for smallmouth. While I plan doing a fair amount of smallmouth fishing there I will be trying my hand out at walleye and maybe a little northerns."

1425017,Guest,2012-04-23 07:51:00,0,"ILBassman This will be my 12th year in a row at SWWL. We are the second week in June, so we will miss you, but you will have a great time. For walleye - for the most part 1/4 oz pink jigs and bring plenty becasue the rocks will eat them. Often times you will fish with no twister tail, just meat, but if the fish are biting often you can add a white 3"" twister tail and do just as well and not have to waste time rebaiting. Bring some stick baits to cast on windy shorts (husky jerk), and at times you will be surprised at how shallow those fish are Bass - The usually assortment but it will depend on weather, are the fish on the beds or pre-spawn. You will use tubes, top-water and stick baits. Northerns - Again stick baits and the standard spoons like 5-of-diamonds, anything shinny. I too bring a tackle box with way too much stuff, but heck, a part of the fun of fishing is the anticipation hightened by going to the tackle store and buying more stuff. Enjoy your trip, Mike and his team will treat you like a king and you will catch fish!....IA Walleye"
1425352,Jigger1,2012-04-23 17:38:00,234,"I’m 64 days out and my tackle box and equipment has already been prepped and ready for a month. I could be packed and ready for the trip in about 5 minutes if push came to shove. My family looks at me like I’m nuts when my Cabela’s order comes in during March and I start packing. This is year #13 and trips 16 & 17 for me. I started twice a year a couple years and each trip is eagerly anticipated. I seriously can’t think of something I would change for this trip, my anticipation starts building almost from the moment I leave to come home. From the owners, staff, equipment, meals, shore lunch, accommodations, it’s all top notch. Then throw in some world class fishing, unbelievable scenery and seriously what more could a walleye fisherman ask for. Mother nature can and will mess things up on occasion and I’d be remiss to say I’ve not had a bad year because I have. I’ll never forget 2009 because it was that bad, however I still had an outstanding and memorable time. I’ve fished Eagle Lake and LOTW too, so no, this isn’t my only Canadian experience, it’s simply has been and continues year after year to the best! My current top end is a 29.25” walleye caught in 2003 and a 40” pike caught in 2010 while jigging in 35 feet of water. I fully anticipate beating both someday and hope this will be the year. Good luck to all, for those of you that have found your SWWL good for you and for those still searching, I hope you all find the place you want to go back to year after year. ILBassman - hope you have an outstanding trip!"
1425426,djarz929,2012-04-23 19:07:00,40,"I agree with Jigger1 as far as raingear. Have seen way too many guys bring up cheap gear, split the crotch out day one, and have ""damp-***"" the entire week."
1425639,Guest,2012-04-24 08:37:00,0,"You are going to a great spot. The advise already given is spot on. Rain gear is big, especially early in the year. You could get by with a large selection of jigs mainly 1/8 and 1/4. Color is not important. Bring one or two #14 Husky Jerk s and make sure one is Tennesee Shad color. The other thing guides have told me is there are a lot of people that come up with poor rods. Invest is a quality jigging rod, it will be worth it. Only a few more weeks and I will be there. Enjoy your trip."
1425656,ILBassman,2012-04-24 09:03:00,16,"thank you all for the replys. I cant tell you the number of times I have gone thru my tackle box, putting this in taking that out. We are only 38 days away ..."
1432900,Jigger1,2012-05-09 06:56:00,234,Seven weeks - 49 days - from right now we'll be leaving the dock for the 1st day!
1443232,Perch56,2012-05-31 14:20:00,17,"My wife amd I spent several days at SWW and had great fishings, fantastic food and hated to come home.For the trip we got a 29,28 and a half dozen 27's 26's and 25's along with plenty of smaller walleyes. All of these were very fat and healthy and reminded me of fall fish. The best day was nearly 90 over 18"" that were recorded and lots more smaller. All were released to get bigger except for a few for shore lunch.We got 40, 38 and several 36 and 37 inch notherns. Most of these came before the walleye season opened. My wife had a huge northern grap a smaller one at the boat and then let go.We even got a few nice bonus perch and several SMB by accident.We fished generally within a few miles of the resort. Char and pink jigs in 1/4 and 3/8 and a lindy rig produced all the walleye.You can't go wrong with SWW. It might cost a bit more.....but when I drive that far I don't want to waste time on my own guessing where to fish.Bret did a wonderful job guiding for us. Thanks!!"
1443284,Skywagon,2012-05-31 17:01:00,1106,"You have been to one of the best fisheries around, with a lodge staff that has a reputation locally, for producing nice fish. Now how are you going to top that?"
