I get the conservation license allowing only 2, which is a mere one time only treat. My question is, do you crave that quality tasting walleye meal more than once after you get home? It's like Thanksgiving, why is it most of us eat turkey once or twice a year? Same with walleye. Once or twice is not enough! Border Bob's has been my savior. They carry 11 lb boxes of frozen fresh caught Canadian walleye filets. I have been able to celebrate Canadian Thanksgiving throughout the year. I also like to bring back a case of Canadian beer home to wash it down with!"

1443669,Rivratz,2012-06-01 17:21:00,105,"Not quite sure exactly? As I recall about $11.00lb. The walleye come in 10 or 11 lb boxes in a couple of different sized fish. Smaller and larger filets. I'm sure they should have a website if you Google, Bing search them."
