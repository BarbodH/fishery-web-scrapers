1442698,RapShad,2012-05-30 11:33:00,76,"When I was 12 years old my dad took me on my first real fishing expedition to Sioux Lookout. I had dreamed of going to Canada with my dad since I was very young and the days had finally come. I had read all of the In-Fisherman Magazines I could get my hands on, watched all of the fishing shows on TV even the ones that only fished for largemouth. Asked my dad every question possible about Northern Pike, Musky, and Walleye and what it was like up there. Little did I know I had the ""bug"" before I had even stepped foot on Canadian soil. Fast forward to the second to last day of the trip, my dad and I were anchored in the English River casting spinners for walleyes and having an absolute blast! When all of a sudden my dad hooked into a fish and handed it off to me (he must have known what was on the other end of the line) I fought this monster for what felt like an hour but in reality was probably about 10-15 minutes (still a long fight). We finally landed the 36"" Northern on light walleye tackle in a very strong current, and I remember just being overjoyed with the experience and wished every person could feel the same way I did.Two years later my sister made her fish trip up there, we had absolutely phenomenal weather (only had to get the rain suits out for half of one day) and fishing to go along with it, I believe we had 2 or 3 100 fish days. She ended up catching a 38"" Northern in Lac Seul and a 27"" Walleye in Pelican Lake. Being the competitors that we are, she would not let me forget that her all time biggest Northern was larger than mine, which drove me crazy! And worst of all she knew it.I share these experiences because I was wondering if others had experienced this type of rookie luck."
1442764,Ranger319,2012-05-30 13:45:00,166,"15 years ago I made my first trip up. I was 16. I still remember the exact location I caught my first walleye, which way the wind was blowing, which way we were trolling, rod, reel, line, lure... Everything. Caught it about 2 hours into our trip. Caught a few more that afternoon (saturday), a few on sunday, hardly any on monday and tuesday. Needless to say I was beyond ready to head home come tuesday afternoon. It was freezing cold, raining, and no one in our group of 9 was catching fish. FORGET THIS PLACE! I practiced in my head over and over how I was going to try to convince dad to head home Wednesday. I had enough. Throw in the towel. My dad could see I was miserable. I have been using a baitcaster since I was old enough to walk so my dad says lets go cast over there out of the wind. All I could think was ""great...not only will we not catch fish but now I will be tired from casting these big heavy lures""About 10 minutes into casting I hooked into a 40"" 20lb fat bellied hog of a pike. I have caught larger pike but nothing even close to the girth of this pig. I was hooked. It was that experience that made me not want to leave to go home...when only hours before I would have given my left arm to leave. Over the next few days, the fish started to turn on a little and my dad in all his brilliance made one comment. ""work your jig just like you are crappie fishing"" I all the sudden started to boat walleye after walleye. I became obsessed with catching every fish in the lake and doing it on a jig. I am a pretty decent crappie fisherman and use that as the backbone to my walleye fishing. Whenever I start to get down in the dumps while jigging I always come back to ""work your jig just like you are crappie fishing"" and within a few casts I always seem to have a bite.I have fished all over and in every type of weather but there is something about a fast bite on Lac Seul that allows a mortal of a man be able to fish in jeans and a long sleeve shirt in 40* windy/ rainy weather and never even notice its cold the elements"
1442772,Mike Kansas,2012-05-30 14:24:00,1463,ROOKIE LUCK PREVAILS...About 12 years ago we had a guy join our group to Lac Seul that had NEVER fished before. He borrowed some rods and reels from one of his employees and they looked like deep sea rods and he had 30lb line on them. I let him borrow a rod and reel more suitable and he caught the biggest walleye we caught all week. Since than we have got him into better equipment and he still kicks our cans. We give a Trophy for the biggest Walleye every year and he has won it 5 of the last 12 years. I think he might be the luckiest xxx alive. Mike Kansas Sirmanski
1442775,tv4fish,2012-05-30 14:31:00,2694,"Ranger: Great story and you are correct -- if a person can't get excited when you get doubles/triples on Lac Seul, you're not human !"
1442786,micropterus,2012-05-30 15:09:00,450,This is as it should be. Another fisherperson is born.
1442797,HeHooksHimself,2012-05-30 15:24:00,725,"I have two similar stories, the first one was my son Tim. Of my two boys, he has only been to Canada once while his brother has been about six times. Tim was with me on the first day and spent the first hour dealing with the bird's nest his line became. We were in my favorite lake trolling to our walleye spot when once again he got backlashed. He spent about five minutes getting it straight and when his lure started moving he had a 37"" pike on the end of it. His first fish was this big mama. After we went in I gave him some braided line and he had a much better time the rest of the week, catching plenty of walleyes and another 36"" northern. In spite of that, he doesnt have the bug like his brother does. Story 2- Just last week we had two rookies with us (this story is also on my thread- Wine Lake Camp Report) and one of them was in my boat the first day. We first fished a walleye hump with no luck so I suggested we troll the adjacent bay where I had once caught a 42"" northern. Shortly after we began the troll I snagged some weeds and pulled my lure in to untangle it. I am not sure if David was reeling in or not, but I heard a ""whoosh"" behind me. I asked him if that was a fish and he said the thought so. I see this thing and it is a monster. Three runs and a leap out of the water and I finally net it and get it into the boat. I am commenting over and over about how big this thing is and he says he is surprised it didnt fight more (really? 3 runs and a leap?) Finally we get her back in the water and with a little care she swims away. Then I realized he had nothing to judge it when he asked what a normal pike was like. Later, after, we caught a few 22-24s he said ""Oh, I get it!"" I caught the second biggest pike of the week at 36"" so he is now known as the PIKE MASTER!"
1442848,drlee,2012-05-30 17:01:00,409,"A few years ago, my son and I were on our muti year spring trip to the white river in northern arkansas for some trout fishing. We had always done well there and my son wanted to bring a friend of his along, a friend who had never really done any fishing, let alone casting panther martins on a fast moving river from a jon boat. During the next three days, he hung about $100 worth of panther martins in the trees along the white river and lost another $50 worth on rocks and other snags. He caught very few fish. Just thought I would give you the other side of the rookie coin!"
1442873,bigwalleye1,2012-05-30 18:15:00,2632,"While Dad got me fishing as a kid, and used to go to Canada years and years ago with the guys, I never had the walleye bug until I caught it on my own. Dad started going to Canada about 5 years ago with me, and became my rookie, and we can't wait to go again. I've run the boat and put him into some pretty awesome fishing. Couple years ago, a long string of fish over the slot, a Master Angler for Ontario walleye, and a lot of great memories, and we just keep on makin 'em. Going again in July, and can't wait!!"
1442972,rnnonmt,2012-05-30 22:41:00,992,Rookie luck goes to my son Caleb. In the 3 trips to Lac Seul he has made master angler each year. First year was 21 inch smallmouth. Second year a 37 inch northern pike and last year a 30 inch walleye. He has the largest walleye that our group has caught in the 30 years we have been going.
1443082,Guest,2012-05-31 09:12:00,0,"First year my 9-year old son goes to Canada. We are on Lac Suel, early June, fishing in the central part of the lake. After a slow couple of hours, the walleyes are hammering a jig dropped over the side of the boat and by hammering it is one of those 100 fish day's where you could get wore out by the fish. I am in heaven and I look over at my son who is reviewing the contents of a ""his"" tackle box. I ask him what he is doing and he indicates he wants to cast a lure. He pulls out big deep diving bass bait. I quickly inform him (since I am such a walleye pro), that the lure he has selected will not catch a fish where we areand that given the walleyes are hammering the jigs, he should continue to fish them. My son asks the guide his thoughts, and like all good guides when confronted by something dumb done by his sports, he says, ""yeh, give it a shot."" First cast, my son catches a 30 and 1/4 inch walleye, a fish with shoulders. After the release he promptly retires the lure and announces that he will never use it again, it has served him well and it will be retired. Eleven years later, the fish remains his largest walleye and the lure remains ""retired."" Cheers..IA Walleye"

1442877,maddogg,2012-05-30 18:34:00,178,"After a few trips with the guys I couldn't get a group together so I opted to take the wife. We were anchored where a small creek entered the bay. There was a deep channel that ran into the bay, I was casting a 1/8 oz jig with a small twister tail through the channel and clobbering the walleyes. She was doing the same towards shore and was getting a few nice perch. Of coarse she gets hung up. I said ''break it off' I'm not moving the boat''. So she drops her rod and reel on the floor of the boat and starts pulling in line.She doesn't look to happy at this point of time. After a few yards of line are laying on top of her rod she says ''the line is moving'' of coarse I grab the rod (just to make sure it doesn't get pulled in to the lake) she says ''give it here'' which I did pretty fast. I've been trying to catch a 42'' northern since 1976 she catches one her first year. I did get on last year so I don't feel quite so bad. To tell the truth it felt better watching her catch her's."
