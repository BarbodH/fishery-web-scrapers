1442962,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-30 21:38:00,235,I don't pay much attention to it.
1442966,BennieS,2012-05-30 21:51:00,108,"I was taught to fish by my Uncle back in the late 50's and early 60's. This man fished every day before work and after work and all day on weekends. He kept a notebook constantly and had boxes of them in his basement. He also always had a solunar table laying on his end table. I asked him about the solunar tables one day and he took the time to explain them at great length to a young boy. I asked him if they really were true. His simple answer was, ""no, the weather is what's important, BUT"", and he pulled many of his notebooks that he kept in a special box and showed me where by far the biggest fish he caught were right around the full moon give or take a few days. Chicken scratching with a number 9 lead on old faded notebooks and double underlines on the pages with the the size of his prized fish, with a full moon drawn next to the date on the pages corresponding to that event. Amazing that those record days for him were always within a turn of a page or two of his shaded full moons. The guy spent so much time on the water he had gills."
1442968,JayM5209,2012-05-30 22:12:00,1050,"BennieS, I think Monday, the 4th, is a full moon. You're going to slay the walleyes on your 1st trip to God's country!!"
1442992,Pooch,2012-05-31 05:37:00,4619,"My best fish and fishing have come a day or so either side of the full or dark of the moon. Several of us have also started to notice that when fishing during the day, if you can see the moon we are usually having pretty decent fishing.I don't believe in all this hokus pokus stuff, but it sure seems like the moon has an influence on fish and people.This seems similar to the barometric pressure change that turns fish on (to a much larger extent than moon phase or position) ahead a storm. How can fish actually feel a change in atmospheric pressure? Somehow they have to sense it either through a change in light or the lateral line.Interesting conversation.Pooch"
1443021,octanehi5,2012-05-31 06:48:00,1104,"My week starts on the 1st of july and goes to the 8th In my experiance weather has alot to do with it. Fishing late at night with a full moon is good fishing. the full moon is the third of july. I hope for 64 * water and a nice walleye chop killer fishing, sunset is about 10:00pm"
1443032,Pooch,2012-05-31 07:21:00,4619,"octanehi5, We will be on the water at that same time on Lake Savant. Fantastic to be on mirror flat water when it's almost like daylight and no one is out but your boat. Hard to tell where the sky ends and the water begins. Usually when the wind lays down and it gets flat like this the bite is over for the night and the mosquitoes start hammering us.Have a good trip.Pooch"
1443047,Mohleye,2012-05-31 08:07:00,368,"I really have no doubt there's something to it....however, it is trumped by the fact that it's hard enough to find a week that works for everyone in our group, and is also trumped by the weather....as it relates to our Canadian trip anyway. I do know that watching a full moon rise from the porch of our cabin with a LaBatts in hand is one of my favorite memories of my Canadian trips, for that reason alone if there were no other factors to consider I'd schedule my trip for a week with a full moon."
1443292,BennieS,2012-05-31 17:10:00,108,"Thanks for the well wishes Jay. If we do slay any kind of fish, much of the credit will lay at your feet and not the full moon. The time and gracious advice you've allowed me over the last few months leaves us well prepared and a good idea of what to expect. Have a safe and succsessful fly in with your son."
1441513,rnnonmt,2012-05-28 08:59:00,992,"Anyone have much faith in solunar fishing calendars? Reason behind my question is because the week I am going to Lac Seul (last week of June)this year the solunar calendar is saying that this week is going to be average to poor. Can you really have an average to poor week on Lac Seul? In the 15 Lac Seul trips I have been on there has been ""a tough day"" but we have always found fish. This has caused me to go back in time on the solunar calendar to see what my previous weeks were rated. Our 2010 and 2011 trips had good to excellent rated days and the actual fishing was on par with the solunar calendar. If anyone has a solunar calendar I would appreciate if you could post the rating for each day based on Sioux Lookout geo region. I am curious if there is any difference between your solunar calendar and mine. The solunar calendar I have is an iphone/ipad app by iSolunar called fishing times. This is what mine is showing for Sunday June 24th to Saturday June 30th. On a rating of 4 being the best/excellent.Sun 3/4 Mon 2/4 Tues 1/4 Wed 1/4 Thurs 1/4 Fri 2/4 Sat 3/4I just remembered I have another one on my hand held garmin colorado gps. Here is what is says:Sun 2/4 Mon 2/4 tues 2/4 Wed 2/4 Thurs 2/4 Fri 2/4 Sat 2/4Thanks! Brian"
1441543,phishfearme,2012-05-28 10:08:00,1242,you may as well consult your astrologer. the best time to go fishing is when you can. phish
1441553,rnnonmt,2012-05-28 10:35:00,992,lol!
1442383,Campcountry,2012-05-29 20:17:00,164,"Over the last few years I have come to be a believer. More often than not walleye fishing is better on the days and times when the solunar says it should be. Weather can change that however. I also discovered that the best Fishing/Hunting times that my hand-held GPS provides are wrong. They are not calculated correctly. The best fishing times from my iphone app - ""Fishing Calendar"" and my Android app - ""Time2Fish"" are both the same and both correct. The best days are generally two days before and two days after a full and new moon and the days of the quarter moon are good as well. The times depend on your exact location so having GPS on your smart phone is necessary. Joe Bucher said on one of his TV shows that he kept meticulous records of his Musky fishing for decades and the two days right before a full and new moon were the best by far."
1442458,bigdaddyguns,2012-05-30 05:51:00,608,Fishing has two seasons spawning season and feeding season. During the feeding season fish have to eat regardless of the moon and sun positions. Solar and lunar cycles have effects on tidal flows which in turn affects baitfish movements especially in oceans/seas. For freshwater I don't see solunar cycles having much influence as it does not affect the water movement as it does in larger bodies of water. It boils down to the predator-prey cycle. Therefore the solunar cycles have no influence over local freshwater lakes.
1442489,Golden Eagle,2012-05-30 06:56:00,2642,Factual. Weather conditions trump moon phases.
1442595,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-05-30 08:40:00,138,All that may or may not be true. But wearing my favorite fishing hat! Now that makes a difference. Fish won't bite without it.
1442603,Bob_Loblaw,2012-05-30 09:00:00,109,"It may be A factor, but solunar positioning certainly isn't THE factor - for walleyes or for any type of fish. I've had fantastic fishing on days that the solunar tables on this site predicted would be crappy, and I've had a terrible time catching fish on 4-star days. Location, season, weather, availability of forage, barometric pressure, fishing pressure, blood pressure...there are a brazillion other factors that likely outweigh (or at least influence) the solunar thingy."
1442606,Glenman12,2012-05-30 09:07:00,762,several years ago me and my partner bought one of those Anglers Edges..it not only takes into account the moon phase but also the barometric pressure..the thing was pretty darn accurate..
