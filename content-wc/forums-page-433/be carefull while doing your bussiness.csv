1439229,hoosiercanadian,2012-05-22 20:45:00,104,"Whoa, sure don't want my daughters to read this story, they will never want to use the outhouse at the cabin!"
1439248,Hawkfan,2012-05-22 21:25:00,237,"Well, if he wasn't quite finished yet, I bet he got the job done when that door opened."
1439250,TroyMansfield,2012-05-22 21:30:00,92,"this happend down stanzikimi road, about 40 minutes out of Sioux Lookout, its a logging road. I was told by a friend of the gentleman that the bear grabbed him by neck and started walking off with him like a rag doll, his friend shot the bear in the head while literally being in the bears jaws. scary stuff right there, and this goes to show how crazy our bear population has grown since they cancelled the spring beear hunt in Ontario."
1439882,rnnonmt,2012-05-24 07:33:00,992,Interesting info. Maybe that explains the amount of black bears we saw last year compared to years passed. I think we saw 10 total. One in our camp and 2 of them on someones houseboat front porch drinking the deep fryer oil. I put the video on youtube a while back.
1439952,BWLCwalleyeguy,2012-05-24 09:01:00,26,"Wow, that's crazy, found another link from the Thunder Bay paper that describes it as well, for sure need to be on your toes at all times. Troy, we've never had any bears come around the cabin(were on south shore drive, I'm BJ's son Blake) and we keep our garbage sealed in a can outside. Have you seen that many more bears around this year? This is going to freak my mom out, might have to cut down on the walks down the road. Can we buy bear spray in Sioux Lookout somewhere? Were heading up tonight for a week, we should get together for a beer sometime."
1440316,lassh,2012-05-24 20:33:00,553,I don't think you are allowed to bring pepper spray over the border into Canada. Is that right? Are US visitors allowed to carry pepper spray in Canada and if so where can you buy it?
1440793,TroyMansfield,2012-05-25 21:07:00,92,"Id check with Als sports for bear spray, there are lots of bears around, usually if you keep it clean you wont have a problem, we have had way to many bears for years, now they are just getting to close to people. You def cannot bring pepper spray across the border, but you can carey bear spray......... come on by the island, we we will figure out the beer situation. If you cant find pepper spray, a 12 gauge works well. BTW today in the dump there was 52 bears there at one time"
1440805,Pooch,2012-05-25 21:44:00,4619,Wasp and hornet spray.
1443219,BWLCwalleyeguy,2012-05-31 13:50:00,26,"Guy at Al's said bear spray with holster is $35. Never saw any while we were up there, maybe they were like us and didnt like the rain, NE wind, and 40 degree temps! Sorry we never stopped by Troy, as you can remember the weather was less than desirable, especially the snow flurry Tuesday morning as we were packing up."
