1443272,Dogbreath,2012-05-31 16:17:00,494,There must be an echo in here.... I guess when was reading this post I must have missed a page and reposted all the same regs about US boats in Canada - Sorry bout dat.....
1442735,tv4fish,2012-05-30 12:34:00,2694,Yes
1442739,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-05-30 12:44:00,138,Thanks!
1442742,octanehi5,2012-05-30 12:50:00,1104,If someone on here thinks that their walleye tast bad if they are not bled out I will give you my address that you can send me the frozen ones that you need a second oppinion on. I will be more than happy to tell you how they were
1442747,Juls,2012-05-30 12:57:00,13414,"Don't wait on the UPS guy to pull up...........I don't know of anyone that said the Walleye taste bad if you don't bleed them. The fishy taste in any fish is not from the blood, but the redish/brown stuff that's between the flesh and the skin, along with the ""bloodline"" that is usually taken out by ""zippering"" the fillets. Sorry, you'll have to catch your own fish to eat. Juls"
1442755,Mark R,2012-05-30 13:17:00,1538,"""zippering""???????? what's that ?"
1442758,Juls,2012-05-30 13:23:00,13414,"Take a skinned fillet and cut two slits in the middle of the tail end of the meat, on each side of the ""bloodline"" that runs down the middle of the fillet. Then, simply pull the ""tab"" of flesh you just cut (either side, it doesn't matter) and the flesh on that side of the fillet will peel off easily. Then, pull the bloodline off the rest of the fillet by pulling the other ""tab"" you made with the second cut. It's called ""zippering"", because it feels like a zipper when you pull the bloodline away from the flesh. Juls"
1442763,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-30 13:44:00,298,Many years ago a camp owner/guide on Lac Seul taught me to zipper and I've done it ever since. It takes a little longer but is worth it.
1443096,2746,2012-05-31 09:46:00,3206,"V-Gord, there's no reason you would remember me but my wife and I stayed at your place a couple times several years ago. You gave me a quick lesson on cleaning pike and I've been cleaning them that way ever since. With that in mind, a video on cleaning fish would be great! Even a bunch of seasoned anglers like we have on WC would appreciate it. (for the rest of the audience, V-Gord really is pretty good at it)"
1443160,Dogbreath,2012-05-31 11:59:00,494,"Re the fishing regs ""exceptions"" Following the number for each species and their size limts, there is always a page of exceptions.I strongly recommend everyone read that page because they concern specific bodies of water that you may be fishing on.This link leads to the ""Zones page"" for the Ontario fishing regs. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_163615.htmlThis will open an approximatly 20 page .pdf and as you scroll down, you will notice ""Exceptions to zone # regulations"". It is VERY IMPORTANT to read these because fish cops are not known for the number of warnings they give."
1443220,v-bay gord,2012-05-31 13:50:00,3168,"Thank you Larry.....I'll see if I can create a ""how to"" video to post on WC. A few posts ago I made this brash statement : ""It ""works""........what's that mean? No blood in the meat? I've cleaned thousands of walleyes....none of them had ""blood in the meat"", regardless of what technique you use. Someone help me out here, what am I missing????? Have I been eating ""bloody"" walleye fillets for the past 30 years .........???? They have been good, by the way.......blood and all..... Well, after scrutinizing my filletting the past few days I guess a case could be made that they are not totally blood free.....but I guess after 30 years of cleaning them I just don't notice it anymore."
1442650,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-05-30 10:06:00,138,"This is from the Ontario Fishing Regs from the sticky link on the board. Is this new? We usually fish Lac Seul and Minnitaki which have exception that require no live fish. We are fishing Eagle lake this year which doesn't have this rule?http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodcons...ent/198219.pdf-----------------------------------------------------------------------Generally, daily catch limits include all fish that are retained for any period of time and not immediately released.Anglers fishing from a boat may now catch, hold, and selectively live release more walleye, northern pike, largemouth or smallmouth bass than the daily limit, provided:(a) the fish are held in a livewell with a mechanical aerator operating at all times (see Anglers Guide, page 8, for livewell requirements),(b) the fish comply with any applicable size limits,(c) the Sport or Conservation Fishing Licence daily catch and retain limits for walleye or northern pike are not exceeded at any one time,(d) no more than six largemouth or smallmouth bass (or any combination) caught under a Sport Fishing Licence are retained at any one time, and(e) the Conservation Fishing Licence catch and retain limits for largemouth and smallmouth bass (or any combination) are not exceeded at any one time.Anglers are reminded to closely monitor the condition of fish held in a livewell. Only fish that are in such a condition that they will survive may be released (see Tips on Live Release of Fish, page 10). Releasing a fish that will not survive and allowing the flesh of that fish to be wasted is an offense. Any fish not live-released are part of your daily catch and retain limit."
1442655,3M TA3,2012-05-30 10:12:00,2846,That's right Juls however someone suggested that the fish had to be dead if you were going to keep them. Clubbing it or some such thing. I've never fished in locals like that but wondered how you manage to keep your fish fresh if you killed it or bleed it right away. How's that? huh?.
1442658,tv4fish,2012-05-30 10:15:00,2694,"Right after you catch them - Now I'm making the assumption that you are on a lake that you can NOT have a live fish on board (no culling). If, however, you are on a body of water that allows you to use your live well, then throw the keepers in the live well to keep them alive (assuming the water temp. is not too hot) until you're ready to quit fishing, then bleed them out."
1442669,tv4fish,2012-05-30 10:27:00,2694,"I would STRONGLY suggest that everyone read the regulations for the lake that they are fishing, i.e. - on Lac Seul, you can NOT possess any live fish on Board (except your bait)."
1442675,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-30 10:38:00,298,Right. It varies by lake.
1442676,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-05-30 10:40:00,138,"Yeah, you're right. I don't want to get anyone in trouble. There are a lot of lakes with exceptions. I always thought it was a province wide rule about no live fish. My question is: Can we have live fish on Eagle lake? I see no such exceptions."
1442710,Juls,2012-05-30 11:53:00,13414,"Ahhhh, I see what you meant now. I don't fish up there, so having a law that requires you to kill your fish that you want to keep is a new one to me. No ice would really suck. It would force you to either shorten your day or practice catch and release. I would practice catch and release until the last hour or two of the day, then keep a few for the dinner table. Again, dead fish get nasty fast. Juls"
1442714,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-30 11:59:00,298,Our camp on Lac Seul provides us with a cooler and ice every morning. That has always kept our fish cold throughout the day.
1442719,Juls,2012-05-30 12:08:00,13414,"Yes, I'm sure it does. That's nice of them to provide that for you... You must have missed the previous post by 3M TA3 that I was responding to: He said: So I'm in the bush (no ice) and am out fishing for the day. Say 8 hours. I catch a keeper eater during the first hour and a few more the rest of the day. At what point in time should I slit the gills?"
1442728,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-30 12:21:00,298,"Yah, I missed that. I see what you mean."
1442417,v-bay gord,2012-05-29 21:35:00,3168,"I acknowledge that it is one way to kill them. I just don't see it as an advantage. A dead walleye in the frying pan is tasty whether you bleed it, dance circles around it, or just throw it in a cooler with ice. The garter belt and high heels was just an afterthought...probably more musky attire anyways."
1442444,TroyMansfield,2012-05-30 05:26:00,92,"honestly before the rules went into effect in our area regarding dead fish on board, I just used to throw them on ice alive, but when you get game wardens giving you and customers a hard time over how dead a fish is, or how hard you attempted to kill the fish, so this was one of my solutions to stop any badgering from the wardens and to stop any misunderstanding of the law."
1442505,Mark R,2012-05-30 07:11:00,1538,I would like to see a photo of the high heels and garter straps in the boat.
1442538,v-bay gord,2012-05-30 07:38:00,3168,"Juls is going to tell you (me) that's ""off topic"", unless there is a connection between bleeding walleyes and wearing high heels in the boat. Juls, what type of footwear do you sport while bleeding your fish?"
1442547,tv4fish,2012-05-30 07:48:00,2694,Gord: I think you're going to have to take some pictures of your fillets right after you've cleaned them (w/o bleeding them out) to show us that you don't have any blood in them.
1442553,Gale Johnson,2012-05-30 07:56:00,577,"I do it the same way Juls does, turn on the livewell pump, grab the fish and take a outdoor edge game shears and cut the gills on both sides, any nice sharp scissors would work I clip em at the end of the trip and by the time i get the boat loaded and to the fish cleaning station the fish are dead, not flopping around, you don't have to whack them in the head, you will have nice clean white fillets, takes less time than washing the blood off if they where not bled I haven't put mine on ice, but for a day long trip with several people on board, that would be a good. I would think that it would be a great idea in Canada if your fish have to be dead, try it once, you might like it."
1442632,v-bay gord,2012-05-30 09:36:00,3168,"Fair enough, I'll see what I can do.......maybe a video on cleaning walleye and pike"
1442639,3M TA3,2012-05-30 09:45:00,2846,So I'm in the bush (no ice) and am out fishing for the day. Say 8 hours. I catch a keeper eater during the first hour and a few more the rest of the day. At what point in time should I slit the gills?
1442647,doubleheader,2012-05-30 10:01:00,2652,"Well, I was with my son-in law over the weekend on his boat. We had a good day, and before we left our spot for the ramp he bled the fish. I've never tried it myself. Anyhow, once I got home I filleted out my 4 which were on ice for about an hour. I have to say the fillets were noticeably more white than any I've ever filleted before."
1442649,Juls,2012-05-30 10:05:00,13414,What does your common sense tell you you should do? Hint: warm dead fish get nasty pretty fast. Juls
1442010,tooski,2012-05-29 09:56:00,393,Agree with Juls and V. Here on Lake Erie it is very common practice to bleed them out. I think the walleye being so much larger on average is the reason. We usually bleed them on Erie and never have up north.
1442015,clarkend,2012-05-29 10:09:00,140,I bleed minie out too when I remember. Never seen a whiter looking fillet and the mess at the cleaning shack is very minimal as well...that is why I do it. Never noticed a diff in taste I guess. Clarkie
1442032,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-29 10:39:00,1460,I do the same recipe for salmon. Only difference is I add some fresh dill. Great tip I'm tellin you what!
1442070,Juls,2012-05-29 11:45:00,13414,That would depend on how the question is asked. Thanks for the cooking tip. Ever try it on Walleye? I don't like Trout or Salmon. Juls
1442102,v-bay gord,2012-05-29 12:29:00,3168,"Try it on a wild Pacific sockeye salmon fillet.....and then tell me if you still don't like salmon Don't think that would work with walleye, sorry. A question can be interpreted in many ways... If more than one person believes the answer, then it must be true"
1442391,TroyMansfield,2012-05-29 20:31:00,92,"I bleed my walleyes and yes it works, the heart is still pumping while there bleeding out, same idea as bleeding cows and pigs, no blood in the meat. Then there is no question with the game wardens if you killed your fish."
1442397,v-bay gord,2012-05-29 20:53:00,3168,"It ""works""........what's that mean? No blood in the meat?

1442403,TroyMansfield,2012-05-29 21:05:00,92,"try it, you will see the difference, I wouldnt mislead you."
1442406,v-bay gord,2012-05-29 21:12:00,3168,"Sorry Troy, you'ld have to club me over the head to start ""bleeding out"" walleyes. What next, high heels and garter straps in the boat? That being said, I will acknowledge that everyone has a right to be different. I guess the bottom line is I must prefer my walleye ""bloody""....at least it gives it some flavor..........almost as good as a pike, trout or whitefish!"
1442410,TroyMansfield,2012-05-29 21:21:00,92,"I prefer bleeding them out versus breaking there necks or clubbing them, its more effective and serves a dual purpose I believe, I dont know about garter straps and high heels, dont know where your going with that, and yes everyone is different, that is for sure"
1441943,Mark R,2012-05-29 08:19:00,1538,I have seen posts where guys bleed out their walleye instead og breaking their neck. We have always thumped them on the head with a billy club. How do you bleed out a walleye?
1441945,Juls,2012-05-29 08:27:00,13414,"Clip the gills and bleed them out. We use a big scissors and snip the throat where the gills meet, making sure to get the gills snipped too. If you don't cut the gills, they don't bleed. In a Ranger we have a pump out system in the livewell, so the bloody water can be flushed out and replaced with clean water. The bled fish are then put on ice in a cooler. Another friend of mine, who doesn't have that type of livewell, clips the gills and puts them head first into a 5 gallon bucket filled half way with water for 10 mintues and then puts them on ice in a cooler. The fillets are cleaner and it makes the job of cleaning the fish less messy too. Juls"
1441954,v-bay gord,2012-05-29 08:35:00,3168,"Sorry Juls, but a dead walleye on ice will not bleed when you clean it regardless whether or not you bleed it out before hand. The whole ""bleeding out a walleye"" concept is bizarre, but if it makes people feel the fish tastes better, then go for it."
1441969,Blue Lk,2012-05-29 09:01:00,269,"I'm with Gord on this 1,I never have bled a walleye,never will.In fact,if you asked the locals,most wouldn't have any idea what you are referring to."
1441976,camp chef,2012-05-29 09:10:00,915,.....x3
1441981,RapShad,2012-05-29 09:19:00,76,"Just snap the neck or give them a head ache put a crawler on the hook and go catch another one, instead of going through that whole process."
1441982,Juls,2012-05-29 09:20:00,13414,"No need to apologize ""v""..... I know what I know from experience. The guy asked how we do it, I explained how we do it. Makes no difference to me whether or not you like to bleed them or not. It's not ""bizarre"".... Just because you don't do it doesn't make it wrong. This wasn't brought up for a discussion on whether or not he should or shouldn't do it. He wanted to know how to do it. Got any helpful tips? Juls"
1441995,v-bay gord,2012-05-29 09:38:00,3168,"It seems to be a regional thing, I guess. ""Bizarre"" in reference to NW. Ontario norms. If you post a topic I do think it is open to discussion though. Helpful tips? Yes, for your next trout or salmon, marinate the fillet in 1/3 cup soya sauce, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup water, 1/4 cup olive oil, pepper, garlic powder....for an hour and then grill. Surprisingly good. Hope that was helpful. (p.s. no need to bleed out your trout or salmon, unless you fish where Juls does )"
1441998,tv4fish,2012-05-29 09:42:00,2694,Gord: I'm with Juls on this one (and so are a lot of other fishermen)
1442009,retire55,2012-05-29 09:54:00,1029,"While I bleed walleye because the fillets look cleaner (IMHO), I have not discerned any taste difference. There's also a lot less blood when filleting. I use an electric filleting knife to fillet my walleye. With that filleting method, there's blood involved when filleting non bled walleye kept on ice until filleted."
