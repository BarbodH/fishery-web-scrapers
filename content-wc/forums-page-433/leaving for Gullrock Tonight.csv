1442668,tackleman,2012-05-30 10:25:00,444,"the wife and i went to the boot on saturday for 3 hours , must have caught 15 walleye in the 14 to 17 inch range, kept 4 for dinner and had a great fresh fish dinner. i just came up from my dock, after bailing the boat out of the 3 days of rain, i tossed a minnow in on a bobber and it wasn''t out more than 5 minutes and i had a 15 inch walleye .Ian's (5 lakes lodge) little guy went fishing with his grandpa Ron yesterday in the bay just up along the shore line from their camp and caught a 23 3/4 inch walleye last night ."
1442687,oly67,2012-05-30 11:03:00,241,"Had some 100 fish days(3 guys) and a few northern over 40"". Not bad, Gullrock can be better I know."
1442720,Blue Fin,2012-05-30 12:08:00,47,"Yes it can. We had our toughest year last year. We seemed to find some little fish but the bigger ones were just not active. There is a big difference between 100 fish day in the 14 to 17 inch range and 100 from 18 and 24. So when guys say they are killing them, what does that mean? I wonder if they will be a little more scattered with the early spring?"
1442876,jkwildhunting,2012-05-30 18:27:00,361,"He is gunna be one fishing machine when he grows up! Talked to Drew (5 lakes lodge) this morning she said everyone so far in camp has been catching alot of fish and having plenty of a fish each day for fish frys. Tackleman, We will be up there week of June 23 if you are not working will have to shoot the breeze at the dock again!"
1442883,tackleman,2012-05-30 18:49:00,444,i'll keep an eye out for you at the dock.
1443227,Blue Fin,2012-05-31 14:11:00,47,Hoping to hear some more positive news this week. I would appreciate any reports as we leave on the 8th. Thanks.
1439793,Tonyo,2012-05-24 04:34:00,212,Not a problem. We will make sure to have lunch ready and an ice cold one waiting. See you tonight.
1440001,tight_line,2012-05-24 10:24:00,6,Appreciate the feedback! We will no doubt have a great time... Next Saturday can't come soon enough!
1441512,WallerChief,2012-05-28 08:57:00,83,J Arendt - how was the trip? Leaving in 5 days and would love to hear how things went for you. Post some pics too!tight_line - the baby backs are thawing right now and will be joining the bacon explosion on the smoker this afternoon!
1442131,J Arendt,2012-05-29 13:15:00,45,"Returned from Gullrock last friday. The bite was very slow all week. We worked hard for every fish we caught. The spots: The channel between Keg and Gullrock very slow , Fishermans point- not good all week Heel of the boot--mostly small 13-16 inches Toe of boot--not good all week-- Burnt Island-- no fish caught by group-- Stevens point-- good in the early afternoon all week. Two Islands lake best fishing all week best bite mid to late afternoon. My worst opener in 17 years. But this is just my group others my have done better."
1442160,Blue Fin,2012-05-29 14:03:00,47,"EESCH! Not really the report I was hoping for. Most people are under the assumption that everything is going to be ahead of schedule with the weather this spring. I am sure that you tried a little bit of everything, and I have been in this situation before. Even when you mark fish, they aren't active, and that can be tough. Did you happen to get some decent size or was it tough all the way around?"
1442272,tight_line,2012-05-29 16:47:00,6,Hmmmm... well at least it sounds like you guys got into a few fish but dang. Definitely not the report I was hoping to hear 4 days before heading north.
1442305,jkwildhunting,2012-05-29 17:33:00,361,"Sorry to hear bout a not so good trip but it beats all of us poor people stuck in the states WAITING for our trip to come Like last year we just kept saying you have to have your bad trips with your good trips. 5 Lakes has a dozen pics of up some quality walleyes mid 20's several pike that are 40"" some smaller. Good thing is fishing can change day by day."
1442594,oly67,2012-05-30 08:40:00,241,I have a friend that was up there last week. He said he had real good luck. He goes there 2-3 times a year so he knows the lake real well though.
1442635,Blue Fin,2012-05-30 09:39:00,47,"Any idea of what he means by ""good luck""? That seems to vary quite a bit from fisherman to fisherman. It sounded like a cold front moved in on guys last week and that might have made things tough on most. Hate it when that happens."
1442644,J Arendt,2012-05-30 09:52:00,45,"We never had the same weather for 16 hours always changing. Two days of strong east winds. Timing is everything, we just had a bad week."
1435627,J Arendt,2012-05-15 08:45:00,45,Headin out tonight for Gullrock. I will post results of pike and walleye outings.
1435636,Pezman38,2012-05-15 08:54:00,3196,Good luck man!
1435656,Fishin Fun,2012-05-15 09:40:00,218,Good luck and have a safe trip. We need fishing details when you return.
1438390,tight_line,2012-05-21 12:40:00,6,Heading to Gullrock for the first time in about 10 years next Saturday. Would love to hear what is working for the walleye. Can't wait!
1438416,Pezman38,2012-05-21 13:34:00,3196,"Welcome to walleyecentral! Bring some 1/4-3/8 jigs with you in chartruese, blue, white, and firetiger and put a minnow on it. Also bring some minnow harnesses with a single hook, some 3-4mm beads and 3-4 size colorado and indiana blades. You will catch fish with just gold and silver, but can get crazy from there. Try to find fish on the bottom with your graph, pull the harness through to see if they are active. If they are, switch to your jig rod and have fun!"
1438615,tight_line,2012-05-21 20:10:00,6,"Thanks Pez! Jig and minnow has been all we've used in the past but it's been a long time since our last gullrock trip. We have also only been there in the heat of summer so any tips on location/depth/etc would be so much appreciated. I need to look at a map but our last trip we spent about 3 days along a sheer rock wall in about 25'ish feet of water and got tired from catching so many 22""-27"" Walleye... Great memories I'd love to re-create! Thanks again!"
1439055,Blue Fin,2012-05-22 14:40:00,47,Going up there the week of June 9th and any feedback would be great. Can't wait.
1439107,jkwildhunting,2012-05-22 16:50:00,361,"Pez pretty much nailed it right on.I personally like using only the 2 hook harnesses made for crawlers just because my lodge owner usually orders special bait for me and I am sometimes using 4-8"" bait.Gold,Blue,White,Orange, Chartruse, Purple, what ever color you like you will catch fish.We always take a flat of crawlers up with us. Some years we dont use many some years will go thru em. I am a gulp/trigger x type of guy. I can catch more fish with out re-baiting all the time. Just have to find out what mood the fish are in. When I am using gulp/trigger x I use it all from minnows to crawlers to leeches. One year the leeches outfished the other 2 did we still catch fish on minnows yes but its always nice for a ""change"" since the jig n minnow is a tride n true bait/lure in Canada.Last year we hit the Mayfly hatch which we ended up having to anchor up and vertical jig em still caught alot of fish but spinners did not produce like years past, then our fall trip we had it all from 85 degree to 30 n snow all in one week.Lodge owner will be able to show you on a map where ""to go"" or where the hot spots were at the week before. Some of the known spots are the Clay Banks, Burnt Island, The Boot, Tree in Lake point, Fishermans Point, 3 sisters, Iowa point, ""Gull Rock"".....and the list will continue!Good Luck and Have fun We will be up there end of June"
1439277,Tonyo,2012-05-23 04:43:00,212,"We leave tomorrow afternoon and will be in camp on Saturday. We have been going to Five Lakes for the past 10 or 12 years and Gullrock has been getting better and better. Jigs, harnesses, crawlers and minnows. That's what we use. Nothing fancy but it works for us. Have a great time. TonyO"
1439384,johnboat,2012-05-23 07:49:00,2014,"See you at camp. If you get the chance, send the boy down to the dock and catch me lunch. It would be nice to have a sandwich right as I get out of the truck. If not a beer will do. JohnB.O.A.T."
