1525434,JohnG,2013-01-18 10:22:00,74,"The Navionics North Chip contains all of the Winnipeg River System, from below Gunn Lake all the way up to and including Big Sand. I asked the same question last year before my trip to Minaki. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the chip I currently had in my unit had what I was looking for. I don't think Navionics advertises that the North chip has it, but it's definately there."
1525443,swank,2013-01-18 10:36:00,44,Thanks that will save me $100. Thanks for sharing.
1524083,swank,2013-01-15 11:15:00,44,Can anyone tell me what chip covers Minaki area? Will be going this summer for the first time to this area and looking for a chip that covers the area for my Lowrance.
1524087,Gregking,2013-01-15 11:23:00,2658,"scribe, i fish right below kenora so it should be the same chip i was going to ask about."
1524109,Gregking,2013-01-15 11:52:00,2658,looks like map C covers Canada
1524123,Gregking,2013-01-15 12:09:00,2658,I did some quick search and it looks like the insight HD and Pro from lowrance don't cover canada. Seems kinda strange
1524161,swank,2013-01-15 13:06:00,44,I cant find anything that says it covers that area. I emailed navionics but havent heard anything back from them yet.
1524164,Seanik,2013-01-15 13:13:00,218,"A few years back Lowrance got into a dis-agreement with who ever controls mapping Canada. Navronics picked up some of the mapping of Canada. I have a lowrance Elite-4 and and can't get depth and contour maps for the Lakes I fish near Savant Lake, Ontario. There is a Company in Ottawa ""TRAK MAPS"" that has a micro sd card the is compatable with most Lowrance units. The chip is a topo map of either Ontario or Quebec and costs 149.99 each. US shipping is 20.00. A bit pricey but thats about all there is for the areas I fish with my Lowrance unit. Humminbird and Garmin units have the best selection of Canada chips. I was about to sell my Elite-4 and buy a Garmin fishfinder/gps until I found TRAK MAPS Hope this helps frustrated Lowrance owners looking for Canada chips Seanik"
1524174,swank,2013-01-15 13:24:00,44,Thanks Seanik I will check them out.
1524178,timvigen,2013-01-15 13:34:00,42,I don't have it but was told the Winnepeg river System is in the Navionics Great Lakes Region card
1524367,DeBo,2013-01-15 20:42:00,211,I have the LOTW +2K chip. No idea if it is still around but I am very pleased with it every year fishing minaki. The data pretty much follows the Gov't paper maps.I have also heard the Great Lakes Chip has the info as well. Can't confirm with my own experience though.
1524510,swank,2013-01-16 09:35:00,44,Just got a reply from navionics here it is Thank you for contacting Navionics.
