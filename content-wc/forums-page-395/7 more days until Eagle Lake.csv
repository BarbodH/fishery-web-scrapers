1524373,emma17,2013-01-15 21:07:00,436,"We attended the All Canada show and really were attracted to Eagle Lake (could be that we fish Eagle River, WI quite a bit). I'm thinking American Plan and the resorts that seem best for us are Birchdale, Cedar Point and AML. I'm a Walleye guy but my sons are really looking for musky.First, is Eagle Lake a good lake for us? We fished Lac Seul and Minnitaki a couple years back and had good Walleye success but no Musky. I'd appreciate any feedback folks are willing to give on resorts (as they all seem nice) as well as fishing. Thanks much"
1524391,2746,2013-01-15 22:04:00,3206,Excellent lake for Musky. Maybe V-Gord will chime in. His lodge is on Eagle at V. Bay and he's in a good Musky area of the lake. In addition to the Musky I think it's one of the most beautiful lakes I've been on. Good walley as well when you're arm gets tired of casting Musky lures.
1524443,v-bay gord,2013-01-16 07:13:00,3168,"Emma.....any of those lodges that you list would do a fine job for you. We don't offer an American plan. Getting a guide for a day or two would probably be worthwhile, especially for the musky side of things. Some of the lodges have their own guides. Here's a link for one that I could recommend http://www.eagleeyeguiding.com/ If you have any questions feel free to pm me."
1524571,emma17,2013-01-16 11:48:00,436,"Thanks VBay. I've read about your lodge and it looks great- and I've read some of your posts and respect the way you conduct yourself. As I'm the only adult in my group, the American Plan is pretty appealing- otherwise I'd love to stay at your lodge. I need to hook up w a group that has made an Annual Canada trip an integral piece of their lives. I'm trying to start it for my sons."
1476066,Bobbajig,2012-08-17 18:29:00,24,"Oh boy. Seven more days until my wife and I leave for Eagle Lake. We will be staying at Cedar Point Lodge in Waldhof Bay section of the lake. Any tips, hints or words of wisdom will be greatly appreciated. Thanks to everybody that have answered the many questions I have already asked. This website is such a wealth of good information."
1476068,NWwalleye,2012-08-17 18:32:00,223,Grab a guide for the week .. It will make the world of difference.Or .......... At least take one fo a day or two to help you out ..
1476589,WowMarie,2012-08-19 15:19:00,19,"We are headed to a Women's Fishing trip on Eagle in a week also. Staying at South Shore Lodge again for the third year.. Hire a guide for a day or 2. Should be good fishing on the flats areas for Walleye, nightcrawler on a harness with a 3/4 oz wt or bottom bouncer. Trolling for large Eyes and Pike is great this time of year, grab a few Rapala divers 10-29 ft and hang on to your rod...it's a riot. Have fun and good luck."
1476598,oxdrift2,2012-08-19 15:52:00,37,"Have a great time!!!!!!! Tell Wayne at Cedar Point, the Narda Guys ( Terry , Scott , Al , and Chuck ) said hello. Save some fish for us. I hope the tips Terry and I gave you helped."
1476608,v-bay gord,2012-08-19 16:11:00,3168,WowMarie is right on about the technique....
1477056,Bobbajig,2012-08-20 15:16:00,24,"Thanks for all the tips, We will definetly try trolling in the evenings. BTW does anyone know if any of the stores in Dryden or Vermillion Bay have smoked whitefish? I think it is one of the true delicacies of the north country!!"
1481654,WowMarie,2012-08-31 14:03:00,19,"Just got back from another GREAT trip To Eagle Lake...fishing was a little tough this year, but we worked at it and got some great fish in the boat. Had a LOT of fun at South Shore Lodge with Gord and his crew. They even took care of our rookies and now have them hooked on fishing...that is probably the best part. Until next year we just dream again...."
1481689,Bobbajig,2012-08-31 16:26:00,24,Wowmarie you must have been up there almost exactly when we were. The fishing was tough but boy it was still fun . Our first day we hired a guide and fished down in your area of the lake. We had a great shore lunch near Net Island. It was reallly windy on Sunday when we were down there. Glad you had a great time. Eagle is a great lake to fish
1481770,WowMarie,2012-08-31 21:02:00,19,"Yes we were there at the same time. Sunday was a tough day on the lake 25-30 mph wind...We shore lunched on Net Island on Tues. The weather was actually perfect on Tues...80 and sunny, light breeze and we hit a spot on the flats that was great. Hate having to wait another year to get back to Eagle Lake, but always worth the trip. We will be staying an extra day or two next year..."
1481803,oxdrift2,2012-09-01 05:04:00,37,Glad you guys had a good time. We leave Wednesday . Even though we go every year I'm still as anxious as a little kid.
