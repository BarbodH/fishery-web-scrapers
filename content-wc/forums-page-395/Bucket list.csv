1522644,eyemike,2013-01-12 08:36:00,233,Booked with Booi's for week of July 6. The wife and I are going. Man I am excited! I have been wanting to go here for a long time. I still can't believe that I talked her into going! Anyone have information or pointers on fishing Trout Lake?

1522743,wallydave,2013-01-12 13:10:00,2151,My wife took pity on me! My group isn't heading North this year. My wife told me she would go as long as she doesn't have to fish! Shes a keeper in my book!
1522920,eyemike,2013-01-12 21:10:00,233,My wife likes to fish as long as she is catching. If she isn't catching then it is time to do something else. She is not happy about flying in. After 33 years married to her she still amazes me.

1522956,zeebee,2013-01-12 21:52:00,1144,"Ive fished outta Boois the last two years and will be going back again this year however I like the mid August fish so my experience will differ somewhat from the early July fish. What I can speak to with some authority is accomodation, hospitality and fish potential. The latter first.......lots of walleye off almost any point including those close to camp although early July should find em in the numerous bays. Crawler harnesses were very effective for us but many do very well with a simple jig and minnow (Gulp good too). Fifty -100 walleye per fisherperson/day is the norm. Make no mistake...Trout is a very large lake and I suspect you will not cover more than 10% of what it offers. NP can be very large...caught a 46.5"" last year not 5 min from camp trolling a Husky Jerk 12. Perch and silver/ blue were very effective. Lots of lakers as you enter the 1st set of islands north of camp in the main basin. We took in a portable downrigger but jigging works well. Our largest was 33 lbs. Take in a portable depth finder.Accomodations are 1st class...great indoor plumbing/showers, spacious and clean chalet style cabins and get this....dishwashers. Jim and Traci are great hosts....get Jim to filet a walleye with his booi knife....quite the visual. PM me if I can provide further info but I assure you that you made a great choice and that you will be on a truly great fishery."
