1372592,Guest,2011-12-12 13:45:00,0,"It's hard enough to come across a 50"" inch Musky. A 50""inch pike is a rare fish indeed. I've seen a 43 inch caught near Red Lake, Ontario. Largest I've ever caught in the states is a 36"", but I know there's bigger."

1372730,LeeMB,2011-12-12 19:29:00,83,"I have guided in Northern Manitoba for 30 years and have only seen 4 legimate 50"" Pike in my boat. I have guided guys to hundreds between 45""and 48"" . A true 50"" Pike is very rare indeed."
1372739,djarz929,2011-12-12 19:52:00,40,"44 inch pike and 29 inch walleye.....both in Northern Manitoba, both in Siers / Einarson Lake (an outpost of Kississing Lake Lodge) obviously not the ones in this picture"
1372943,Steve Ediger,2011-12-13 12:20:00,97,"After 10 - 12 trips to Lac Seul I was fortunate to catch a 29"" walleye and a 43"" pike -(both of which are my largest to date) just 3 days apart fishing out of Lac Seul Lodge. Still looking for the 30 & 50."
1373008,jigngrub,2011-12-13 16:42:00,304,"Yeah... but they're real long and skinny!I think they're called Spaghetti Pike?I find it interesting that people claim to have seen a 50"" Pike, but no one has a picture of one.... kinda like Bigfoot eh!???"
1372434,Mike Kansas,2011-12-12 07:19:00,1463,"The question of a 30"" Walleye or a 50"" Pike being more rare was brought up. How many of you have caught a 50"" Pike??? My biggest Pike ever was 46"" and I caught him while jigging for Walleye. Mike Kansas"
1372439,Larry Mac,2011-12-12 07:39:00,530,"Hi Mike, mine was a 43"" caught jigging for walleye this past spring. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"

1372486,NARDA 1,2011-12-12 09:26:00,636,"I caught a 48"" pike about 15 years ago on Eagle Lake. Haven't seen any over about 42"" since."
1372512,HeHooksHimself,2011-12-12 10:33:00,725,"11 straight years to Canada, 16 trips. My biggest and the biggest I have seen is 42 My biggest walleye is only 27 but my son caught a 29 1/2 two years ago"
1372524,Pikeslayer8,2011-12-12 10:54:00,1460,"My big pike story goes like this:We started out the day at my favorite place to fish, planning on having shore lunch. There have some days where you just plain suck. This was my day. All morning I'm getting outfished by everybody, secretly paying close attention what colors everyone is using. Finally, time to straggle in for shore lunch, park the boat, grab my northern loomis rod and announce to everyone, ""that after the morning I've had, gonna make a cast over here."" Sure enough, soon as my crank plops exactly where I wanted it, gets crushed by my new pb 44 1/2"". Such a cool fight! It was extra cool to have my whole party drop what they were doing and watch me land this fish. Redemption was sweet. Pikeslayer was born. Been going to this lake for a long time with a lot of fellows. 44 1/2"" pike and 29 1/2"" walleye are the biggest for us on this lake. The 29 1/2"" walleye was caught by my dad, rip."
1372529,wallydave,2011-12-12 11:05:00,2151,"My best pike was 34 in several years ago near Ear Falls section of LS. I was casting a red-eyed-wabler, sure made for a good fight. Last years biggest pike was 33 in while jigging for walleye with an ultra-light rig, that was fun too!"
1372541,walleyerichard,2011-12-12 11:37:00,23,"50"" pike are pretty common here in Missouri."
1372542,bergsh,2011-12-12 11:38:00,183,"Red Lake Ontario while jigging for walleye. 43 1/2"" pike hit a 18 inch walleye my brother was reeling in. Grabbed the net and got them both in the net. Big pike are a nightmare when they don't get played out. Beat the crap out of us.But fun times."
