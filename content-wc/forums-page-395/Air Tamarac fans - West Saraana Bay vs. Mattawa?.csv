1521565,pawalleye32,2013-01-09 14:26:00,18,In the midst of planning a trip to the Gouin for myself and my 8 year old. Any suggestions / input between West Saraana Bay vs. Mattawa Bay. Anyone flown from the Baskatong before? Thanks.

1521647,pawalleye32,2013-01-09 18:35:00,18,I have been to Hebert many times - you won't regret it. Fanastic fishing. Hebert is in the mix for our trip this summer. I'm trying to get info on their cabins on the Gouin. Looking to head up the last week of July.

1521842,mr-fish,2013-01-10 08:48:00,58,My choice with a 8 year old would be Mattawa Bay. More places to fish without crossing any big bodies of water. The bay at Sarana West cabins protects you from the wind. If you go out in the big bay and the wind kicks up it can be a real bear to cross. Good Luck. I hope your Son catches 1 more fish than you and the biggest fish of the week.

With two in your group they'll probably send the Cessna (smaller than the Beaver). Could get a little bouncy if its windy. Either way, enjoy the trip. A great experience for you and your son."
