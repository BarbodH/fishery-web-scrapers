I'ld be extra cautious heading to any trout lake. ...update: was talking to some who have been on the east end of Eagle and into Green Lake.....slush was terrible and not much ice on Green (which is a trout lake).
1523692,fishguide1800,2013-01-14 15:12:00,84,"Have been fishing cliff lake,there is maybe a foot of snow there and cedar,8""-12"" of ice,last week it was almost bare ice and 4"" of water on top of that,definetly the last few years just not getting much snow Johnsoutdooradventures"
1519789,1jigfish2,2013-01-04 16:27:00,110,"Does anyone have any idea about how much snow they have around the area around Cedar Lake, near Perrault Falls, Vermillion Bay, Ontario? Last year water levels were down, good snow would be great for the lakes. Temps look like they have been cold, so there must be plenty of ice."
1519834,stillangling,2013-01-04 18:35:00,149,http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/data/...is/352_100.gif Looks like about 30 cm on the ground. That is approx 12 inches
1519848,1jigfish2,2013-01-04 19:35:00,110,"Thanks for the info, I will keep that page handy."
1519849,v-bay gord,2013-01-04 19:42:00,3168,"Good ice..not much snow...maybe 10 inches in VBay, but it varies quite a bit in surrounding areas. Water levels are very low."
1519872,1jigfish2,2013-01-04 20:53:00,110,"V-Bay, thanks, they need a lot more snow."
1523203,Glenman12,2013-01-13 15:28:00,762,At the All Canada show yesterday there was talk that a blizzard went thru the area on Saturday..any truth to that??
1523215,v-bay gord,2013-01-13 16:04:00,3168,"Yes, we had a pretty good dump along with some winds.....hwy 17 west to Kenora was closed for 19 hours. The day before was rain. I think in the VBay area we had maybe 10 inches.....further east in Thunder Bay never had any..just rain. I was hoping for more snow but I'm glad we got what we got... Here's a link to our weather forcast for this week (converted to Farenheit for you heathens south of the metric line) http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/forec...l?on-72&unit=i"
1523334,tackleman,2013-01-13 20:37:00,444,"we had a lot up here too, the snow banks in town are 3 feet high. I had to dig through snow drifts up to my knees to get out of the house and then drive through them to get out to the highway to go to work."
1523383,Skywagon,2013-01-14 05:53:00,1106,"After the warm weather earlier in the week, mixed rain, then finally a heavy snow, the slush is awful. The three lakes I was on yesterday went from bad to worse, you needed to be very careful where you stopped the sled. We need some really cold weather to freeze it up. Is Eagle bad too Gord? Had thought of traveling it to fish on west, if it is fit."
1523385,bigdaddyguns,2013-01-14 06:04:00,608,Heard a report that Perrault Falls area received around a foot of snow
