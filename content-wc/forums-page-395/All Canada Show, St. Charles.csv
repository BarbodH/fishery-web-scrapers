1522650,pikeman14,2013-01-12 08:42:00,144,I agree the shows aren't what they used to be. But the few minutes I spend talking face to face with the lodge owners is worth a whole lot more than the websites. I hope that the show tours can stay strong.
1522716,Jatar,2013-01-12 11:50:00,169,"I noticed that the show is getting smaller as well, If I wanted to see metal roofing and windows, I would go to a Home Improvement show. With that being said, My son and I enjoy the show, I bailed on the Rosemont show because of parking fees being higher than the admission fee. We will choose our Canadian destination via the internet, with W.C. forums having a large part to sway our choice. Another thing I noticed is that some of the booth operators sit there like a stone and seem to be bothered by any type of conversation/questions."
1523059,pikeman14,2013-01-13 08:28:00,144,"The show did seem smaller than usual. But for us, it was well worth the drive. I did find a topo map for our remote lake after countless hours of internet searching. Most booths did not try to lure us into conversation. It did seem as if the lodges were only there for guys who have already booked a trip. If we were not booked, or were not looking to book a trip, I might have been a bit bored honestly. All in all, many of our questions were answered and it was a good way to get the group excited for June."

Gotta see what the tax man bringeth. I would appreciate meeting anyone from WC who might be there, in case they or I would need to hook up with others for a trip in the future.PM me if you will be therre same time."
1521971,misanthrope,2013-01-10 13:12:00,43,Going on Saturday with my boy. Looks like the rest of the crew may have backed out again this year.

1522077,eyeman_1,2013-01-10 17:35:00,690,I wasl planning on going but I can't make it.... gotta thing to do with the grandkids... otherwise I'd be hanging around the Totem/Wiley booth.
1522095,pikeman14,2013-01-10 18:31:00,144,Our group is looking forward to talking with the lodge owners face to face. It will be the first realization that our trip is more than a bunch of talk. Can't wait!
1522148,Glenman12,2013-01-10 21:38:00,762,"Just got home from working the booth for the lodge we go to...first thing me and my partner noticed is that exhibitpors look to be down about 33%..for those familiar with the usual set up, the speakers and films that used to be done up the ramp are now being done in the main area..also a Lund boat dealer has 3 boats on display area..it was never like that before..also, walking the aisles waiting for the show to start we noticed at least 3-4 booths occupied by companies that have nothing to do with fishing, let alone Canadain fishing.. Having said that attendance seemed to be about normal for the first day so thats a good sign for the rest of the show.."
1522173,teddi,2013-01-11 04:34:00,349,All canada shows are going down the tube. We have stopped doing them this year after doing all of them years before.
1522510,Glenman12,2013-01-11 18:47:00,762,Its starting to look that way..are you doing any other shows in the Chicago market?
1522522,wallydave,2013-01-11 19:16:00,2151,With the Internet and websites along with the tough economy its no wonder that the shows are drawing fewer visits!
1522643,phishfearme,2013-01-12 08:36:00,1242,"my observation also - these shows are really enjoyable for us fishermen but costly and time consuming for the outfitters. one outfitter told me he had to get at least 5 bookings from the show to justify it's costs (show fee, motels, travel, etc.) and he was now doing all his advertising and bookings thru the internet - so why do the show? the times they are a changing phish"
