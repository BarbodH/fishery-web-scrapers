1522325,troutwater,2013-01-11 11:23:00,299,"I'm looking to do a short 4 to 5 day trip this coming summer, but I would have to do it alone. I was hoping I could get some suggestions on places to go that are accommodating for someone going by themself. I would have to rent a boat and looking to go sometime in early August. I fish mainly for muskie but wouldn't object to a walleye, pike, or bass only trip if the place is right."
1522341,Mr. Sauger,2013-01-11 11:49:00,285,Best place to go by yourself - the outhouse.
1522342,camp chef,2013-01-11 11:50:00,915,www.bignorthlodge.com. Have been there many times. I highly recommend for what you are looking for.
1522355,wallydave,2013-01-11 12:06:00,2151,"http://www.lacseul.com/August might be a month that would have open cabins. Andrea charges by the day, not the week. Not much of a musky area, but pike and walleye fishing is pretty good!"
1522359,JayM5209,2013-01-11 12:15:00,1050,"Last fall, after 34 years of trips to NW Ontario, I did my 1st solo trip on Cliff Lake just north of Vermilion Bay. Muskies, lake trout, lots of small mouth, more limited number of walleyes (but they are beautiful 'eyes). Check out Lost Bay Resort at http://www.lostbayresort.com/. The current owners are totally rebuilding the entire camp and the facilities, new boats and new Yammie 4 strokes, and the service are 1st rate . . . . as is the cost! It turned out to be an excellent location for my 1st solo trip.Also, given your interest in musky fishing - along with the availability of northerns, walleyes, smallmouth, and lake trout - you should talk with V-bay Gord, an active participant in this forum. See http://www.vermilionbaylodge.com/. I haven't done a solo trip there, but based on the week my son and I spent there two years ago, I'd rank VBL right up there among the very best camps/lodges/resorts in NW Ontario.Incidentally, both Lost Bay and Vermilion Bay Lodge are housekeeping camps. That's always my preference . . . . I've just never been able to get my head around the idea of planning a fishing trip around someone else's dining room schedule. But, to each his/her own. I'm sure folks here can provide plenty of American plan resorts for your consideration."

1522481,Golden Eagle,2013-01-11 17:32:00,2642,"I've made over a dozen solo trips, beginning around 1992. Never talked about it or thought about it very much. Just did it. For the first one I made a phone call around noon Wednesday, left at 4 a.m. Thursday and was on a Beaver float plane late Friday. I was the only one in camp most days and nights. It worked so well that I kept it up, except when somebody invites themselves to join me. My favorite month for solo trips is October. Usually no other fishermen on the lake or in camp.It makes for a rewarding outing."
1523984,fishguide1800,2013-01-15 07:50:00,84,"Totally agree with jay,cliff lake is a gem,due to the lack of walleye fishing the camp gets overlooked,but the other species in the lake are in abundance,smallmouth everywhere,lakers are easy to catch pike are on the prowl,muskies are plentifull,they do have a few boats laying on the portage lakes,were walleyes can be caught,but in july the walleye populationarr easier to catch as the start hanging out on the reefs in the lake,should be a great trip no matter were u end up,good luck"
1524046,troutwater,2013-01-15 10:10:00,299,Thanks for all the suggestions. Would Canyon be a good option? I've never been but hear it's a great numbers muskie lake with fairly good walleye fishing.
1524131,Nimstug,2013-01-15 12:28:00,2605,"I think if you find a lodge / camp that you like, give them a call and see what they might have available in the off season such as September or October. Lot of places have empty cabins and they don't mind someone a 'party' of one while they are getting ready to close. I'm not knocking a group or even just two, but sometimes it just good to get away by yourself. NimstugMany men go fishing all thier lives and without knowing it is not fish they are after. -H.D.
