Looking at Sab-bay area, or Kenora area. Like fishing for walleye, musky, pike. I've never been to the Kenora area, but I've fished several times in the Sab-bay area. Any input would be greatly appreciated"

1522454,Guest,2013-01-11 15:59:00,0,"pjm thanks, We would bring all of our own food and our own boat. Nice cabin and nice dock and good fishing. Just was trying to get some different opinons on the 2 different sides of the lake. Not familiar with the north end, but I do have gps with lake map on it. I would be comfortable navigating on the lake."

1523113,fishanytime,2013-01-13 10:27:00,63,The Sioux Narrows area puts you in the heart of good musky fishing in Whitefish Bay area and great walleye fishing in the Yellowgirl area but also larger walleyes in the entire area close to Sioux Narrows.
