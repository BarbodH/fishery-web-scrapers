Only one time did we see anybody but ourselves fishing on Ogani and they came up from Bluffy Lake. The lake is pretty remote. Ogani is about 38 miles on a gravel road from Ear Falls and it is a small lake so it gets little fishing pressure. As for the fishing, I have caught northern pike up to 38"" and numerous other pike over 30"", most of them right off the dock. As for walleyes, they are small but numerous. I only caught one walleye over 20"". A little information about the lake. I estimate its' size to be a little over 600 acres and its' max depth when I was there was around 15' (the lake depth varies in depth because of the flow of river changes), although I found a few deep holes in both rivers that were over 30' deep."

The only thing better than the weather that week was the fishing. Personally I got tired of catching walleyes by the second day. I'm sure our group caught well over 1,000 fish with probably half being caught right off the dock. A quarter ounce jig with a white twister tail was all you needed. Dave had give each of us five dozen minnows, but we soon dicovered we didin't need to waste tiem putting them on as the fishing was just as good without them. We only had one boat come up from Bluffy. We shared our fishing spots and a few beers with them. They caught a 46 inch Northern right in front of the cabin. Our biggest Northern was 42 inches and it was caught on the face of the only island in Ogani Lake. We also hooked several large fish below the falls leading out to Bluffy. I have a group going back to twin falls the third week in September and was wondering if anyone who has been to Ogani has portaged into the lake that is up the river above twin falls? We took the boats up as far as the small falls coming out and fished but did not pull the boats through into the lake. Also took the river up that comes directly into Ogani as far as we could go. Hit a some what larger falls there and caught a number of nice size walleyes, but again did not attempt to portage into the next lake."
