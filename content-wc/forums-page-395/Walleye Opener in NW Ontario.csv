1521116,Golden Eagle,2013-01-08 13:38:00,2642,"Cabin #2 on Little Vermilion Lake, a short flight north of Red Lake is booked in my name for the walleye opener. I emailed 6 guys and got a yes from 4 in under 51 minutes. Should be hearing from the two stragglers before the end of the day.It's nice dealing with friends who eliminate the guess work. This will be my 29th consecutive walleye opener on Little Vermilion. Should be getting the hang of it one of these days."
1521134,wallydave,2013-01-08 14:04:00,2151,for the New Year! Have a great trip! You can start your countdown!

1521265,Knoxabilly,2013-01-08 20:50:00,225,"Getting responses that fast is equivalent of catching a 30"" Walleye, it's rare."
1521298,Golden Eagle,2013-01-09 04:23:00,2642,Only one vacant seat as of last night.
1521300,Mike Borger,2013-01-09 04:43:00,1554,29 in a row Connie? You're an inspiration.
1521303,tackleman,2013-01-09 05:12:00,444,"sorry about not getting back to you sooner Connie, I think you must have my old email address but in any case i think i have to work that weekend, but if i am off i will probably be chasing my boat shadow around on the dead sea called Eagle Lake."
1521342,Golden Eagle,2013-01-09 07:30:00,2642,"Bill, don't you have your own streak going on Eagle? Thought you had already turned your work boots into fishing boots."
1521400,v-bay gord,2013-01-09 09:51:00,3168,Maybe Bill should book a cabin at VBL so I can teach him how to catch a walleye on Eagle Lake.......
1521410,Golden Eagle,2013-01-09 10:04:00,2642,The final candidate for our party is a first timer and the young son of one of our regulars. We seasoned fishermen need an infusion of young talent in our cabin. Must have a sharp filet knife and fresh legs.
