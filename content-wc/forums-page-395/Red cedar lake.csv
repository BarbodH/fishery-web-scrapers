(Back then, we measured them in pounds, remember?) We had a flasher depth finder and back trolled the old river bed, about 8 fow. Everyone else in camp would anchor on some random spot and drop minnows, not really knowing where they were. At the end of the day, people would come by and ask us how we caught the fish. The place reminded me of a Twilight Zone episode.I don't need the maps, but thanks for the offer, and thanks for bringing back another memory.Frank"
