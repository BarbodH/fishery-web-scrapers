1048298,Guest,2008-08-09 14:40:00,0,"Just got back . We had a great trip. The new lodge is very nice. Fishing was pretty good. We had some amazing mornings and amazing afternoons, but never put one full day of great fishing together. We did real well in Gibb Lake and Tourist Bay. Our biggest walleye was 27"" and biggest northern was 35"". We also caught quite a few smallmouth. We had perfect weather and the bugs weren't too bad. Water was a little higher than last year. Overall I would rate it an 8 out of 10 in terms of trips we have had up there. We booked our trip again for next year. If you have any questions, feel free to ask."

1048923,kansasity,2008-08-13 06:14:00,80,Good post neiowa! I was wondering if you had any places near caribou? We aren't doing any portages. We will be fishing Umfreville the whole time. How was the weather? What bait did you use the most? And did you have any problems with the indians on the reservation trying to charge you a toll?
1305342,Guest,2011-05-10 20:23:00,0,Heading for the first time to Halleys Caribou Falls. We will be fishing for Walleye and Northern. Always wanted to fish the English River. Usually go to Lac Seul. Frothing at the mouth now. May 21st for 3 days.

1524205,Ia Walihntr,2013-01-15 14:24:00,320,No personal experience but here is a link for some info on the camp.www.halleyscamps.com/one-man-lake-lodge.html
1044997,Guest,2008-07-24 21:15:00,0,Heading up for another trip next week. Anyone been in this area lately? Any info would be appreciated.
1045076,IaDave,2008-07-25 08:33:00,476,"Got back July 3rd from my first ever trip there. I thought the fishing was great,mainly fished for pike and bass. The smallmouth were spawning and caught a bunch of them with the biggest around 18"". Caught at Routine Falls. Caught 2 pike around 40"" and both of those were in deeper water while trolling deep diver X-Raps. Caught many Pike 24-34"" casting in the bays. Weedbeds were just starting to show above water. Caught walleyes while trolling biggest was 21"". The other boat was jigging for walleyes and they caught alot in 8-12' with the biggest being 24"". There is so much water there we only saw probably 10% of it, farthest we traveled was Routine Falls. For my first time there and my 15th trip to Canada I was impressed with the size of the fish. The boat I was in doesn't like to fish for walleye but I have a feeling if you did there are alot to be caught. I forgot - the hot lure of the week was a pink spinnerbait-go figure."
1045285,Guest,2008-07-26 06:33:00,0,Dave Thanks for the info. THis is our 7th trip up there. Was the water level high?
1045566,Guest,2008-07-28 06:39:00,0,"How was your trip? We are heading up Labor Day. Any tips would be great. We will mainly be fishing for walleye, and casting for some pike."
1045620,IaDave,2008-07-28 10:40:00,476,They told me the lake levels were pretty normal but below the dam was high.
1045664,SSH,2008-07-28 14:44:00,526,"The Umfreville lake levels vary very little probably about a foot or so. Been going there for the last 17 years, if the lake level would vary 3-4 feet several of the places I fish would be in-accessible. Fishing in early September, the fish can be in different locations depending on the weather. I would suggest trying wind-blown points, points with current and wind-blown points with current. If these don't produce, then, the fish may still be on mid-lake humps. Some years, wind-blown points and mid-lake humps will produce, so just try until you find a pattern that works."
