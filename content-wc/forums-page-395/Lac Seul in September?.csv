I'm thinking of heading up from Texas with some friends, and mid-to-late September is the only time we can make it work. I've never fished up there but continue to read great things about it on this site...Also, lodge recommendations would be appreciated (Silver Water Wheel is on my personal bucket list, but a little too pricey for the whole crew). We'll be looking for American Plan with guides.Thanks!"
1522623,new hips,2013-01-12 07:09:00,498,"We have been up to Williams lake Lodge, always in September. Usually early September, weather was always great as was the fishing. One year we went mid September, I believe 3rd week, that year it was quite cold and windy, it can get a little dicey that time of year. High winds makes fishing on Lac Seul pretty tough. The fishing was still great, just made it more difficult. The lodge has dropped the american plan with new ownership, I believe. That area of the lake receives less pressure........once in awhile we would spot Silver Wheel guides. We mostly fished Kleiners Point which was about a 35 minute run from camp. If it looks interesting, PM me and I can give you more detailed information."
1522769,Pooch,2013-01-12 14:19:00,4619,"Search Lac Seul. You will get a dozen or more camps. I doubt there is a bad one in the bunch. The bad ones fall by the wayside in fairly short order. The Ear Falls area has a bunch of camps and most all are accessible by car or pick up truck. There are fewer camps on LS in the Sioux Lookout area, but numerous lodges on Minitaki and other good lakes in that area. I think some offer side trips to LS.LS over labor day has been fairly decent fishing for our annual fall trip. We fish several good camps on other lakes and they each fish different. I would rate LS as above average on numbers of small eaters (15 - 18"") and average on size (over 26""). In the fall weather can be a little more fickle. It seems to be either shorts and T shirt or many layers of sweatshirts.Pooch"
1522825,BenBeattie,2013-01-12 16:59:00,232,"Both these guys touched on it, but that time of year - especially late september, is a gamble with the weather. It can be cold, including snow, and the wind can blow for days. If you're willing to accept that you may face tough weather conditions you can still have great fishing and considerably less boats on the lake at that time of year. Look at Moosehorn Lodge in Sioux Lookout www.canadafish.com american plan, big boats with tops, guides and fishing on Lac Seul and/or Minnitaki lake, which is a walleye factory as well. I believe Moosehorn offers discounts for trips in September as well - to account for the unpredictable weather. Let me know if you've got any other questions about the area."
1523677,fishguide1800,2013-01-14 14:49:00,84,"I do a lot of guiding on the west section of lac suel,not a lot of camps there offer the american plan,the only one i can think of in earfalls is timberlane lodge,but huge water getting tto the good spots and far,,might want to check out fishermans cove or onaway lodge,close to great fishing,thats where we launch out of,weather is bad lots of places to hide and fish,if weather is good the main lake is within 5 miles,just start learning to cook and spend your extra money on good guides,lollet me know if you need more info, John jakobs Johnsoutdooradventures"
1523688,SinOrSwim,2013-01-14 15:02:00,1528,"Fishguide1800, just sent you a PM. We have been going to LS for the last 2 years in September after about 16 or 17 doing fly-ins. Weather is an unknown but I can tell you the last 5 to 6 years, I have packed for cold and rarely gotten it. Many days it has been way too hot imo.The great thing about that time of year is, even if does get hot during the day, the cabins cool off at night and there are no bugs. This will be our 3rd year with Onaway Lodge. The facility is top notch. Boats and cabins. Website is very accurate. We haven't done the greatest fishing the last two years but certainly not bad. Just sporadic. It's a big body of water and when they say watch out for hidden rocks......WATCH OUT FOR HIDDEN ROCKS! lol I was back trolling (thank goodness) over a sunken island where I thought it would get to 5 or 10 feet. Next thing ya know. BOINK! Stopped cold. ROCK!!!!!!! Thankfully, like I said I going slow. We had been through that area earlier and could have really causes some damage had we hit hard."
1525106,Jigger1,2013-01-17 13:31:00,234,"Bassnblast Â– Silver Water Wheel Lodge absolutely rocks as I've said many times before so make sure you knock it off the list at some time because it's worth it. I now make two annual trips. One in late June/early July and the other in late August/early September and while the weather in NW Ontario is almost always a guess, it seems that it can really blow as you move later into September. Our last day on the water in 2012 was the 6th, this year it will be the 4th. Each of my three fall trips we've run into some pretty heavy sustained winds that's made fishing a challenge at times. I'd be tempted to try later but virtually all the guides and staff says it's a real risk weather wise. The upside as you move later into September is that it's great walleye fishing and you get the added bonus of big pike coming back into the shallows. You should give Mike Willems a call and just touch base with him to see if anything is open and at what price. Probably worth the phone call."
