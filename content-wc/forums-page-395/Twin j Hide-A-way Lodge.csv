1524490,stjoeguy,2013-01-16 08:49:00,979,"I've never been there, but this is part of a post I found on another fishing site I visit occasionally.The post is 2 years old, but doesn't sound real promising. Hopefully, someone on Walleye Central has more recent information:Posted 13 June 2011 - 10:47 AMWell we came back from twin j hideaway , great place to stay if you are thinking about going to gogama area.... The fishing wasnt to bad but should of been better i think , a lot of pike were caught by our group and walleye everyday , one or two and the odd five in the boat ,the tournament up there they said it was good and you can do a search for first nations reserve mattagami lake .. well my buddy didnt catch anything all week and i didnt catch until wednesday evening when we found a hole and they were biting big time ,got a 19 and 16 ,they were biting so soft ,so i put a stinger on and even then that is all i could get for the week.. the last day i got a small pike on a dollar store lure (white and pink) .We had a great time and the bugs were bad and really affected my fishing partner and i will stand near him all the time now,,, .Alot of people at lodge were catching but not like usual they said and was hard this year for some reason also,,, .. Well looking for another spot next year already and maybe up hwy 11 next year."
1524728,Guest,2013-01-16 17:36:00,0,I live in the area and fish Mattagami lake lot's during the summer. It is a great fishery and last year was the best year I ever had on the lake. Lot's of fish between 17-20 inches and you have a very good chance to get a 8lb plus walleye.
1524733,Guest,2013-01-16 17:41:00,0,"I forgot to mention depending what time of year you go, the fish could be shallow or deep, if you are planing to fish Mattagami after June then most of the fish will be in 20-30 feet of water on the shoals and points, and every rock pile you can find there are walleye on it. I guide on that lake so I spend a lot of time there so if you want anymore info you can e mail me at [email protected] and Ill help you out as much as I can."
1524919,bigdog8837,2013-01-17 07:37:00,30,How the fishing for Pike and Smallmouth Bass?
1525010,Guest,2013-01-17 10:09:00,0,"I have never really just concentrated on pike or smallmouth, but there is good numbers in the lake. 2 years ago while pre fishing for a walleye tournament in June, we hit tons of nice 3-5lb smallies up in the shallows and have caught them with bottom bouncers in the fall on rocks. Also for pike we catch them fishing walleye but if you cast spoons or spinnerbaits around weeds and back bay areas you will do just fine. Mostly everyone here in northern Ontario just fishes walleye so you would have a lot of water to yourself if you plan on fishing pike"
