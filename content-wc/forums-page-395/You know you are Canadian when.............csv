I heard that my favorite distiller set a river on fire last summer. Austin Nicol's seems to have had a storage facility catch on fire and the nectar somehow spilled into a local river setting it on fire also. Anyway my complaint is that the price of a 26 oz bottle went up last week by a buck a bottle. That is after a 0.75 increase earlier this year.I have a place at Pointe-au-Baril on Georgain Bay near Parry Sound. I meet many people from MI, Ohio, Penn, New York, Vir. One of the regulars( 1st came with his father in the early 70S) Now comes with his wife and 4 kids. Says that it is cheaper than a theme park for one day in the states. After 1/2 bottle tonight Wild Turkey barrel proof (It is my birthday) I read this thread.....I was really laughing out loud at some of the posts.....Great stuff.Dave"

At a bar you ask for a rye and coke and you get a funny look.3. A dollar bill feels funny in your hands.4. Can't tell the money denominations apart, end up tipping the waitress $50 U.S.5. 60 mph seems slow compared to 100 kliks an hour.6. You've got the accent.7. If someone finds out you're a Canadian and they have relatives up there, they'll ask if you know them, while they live in Tuktoyaktuk and you're from Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.8. And you're always asked ""Why do you say ""eh"" at the end of everything?"""
518730,CanEye,2002-04-02 05:50:00,11,"Good ones Gary.....I'll add one Americans always seem to know you're from ""Canada"", don't know why but they do. The other interesting one is they usually never ask the province....just a generalization of ""Canada"". I was asking for directions in Minnesota to cross the border near Warroad and asked directions to ""Manitoba"". The girl at the gas bar looked at me with great interest and then got the manager. No idea. A customer came in he was asked and he said ""Thats Canada"". Oh Canada they said and gave me directions. For those of you that do not know Warroad is a town on the border pretty much with Mnaitoba."

Radio conversation released by the Chief of Naval Operations 10 - 10 - 95.Americans: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the North to avoid a collision.Canadians: Recommend you divert YOUR course 15 degrees to the south to avoid a collision. Americans: This is the Captain of a US Navy ship. I say again, divert YOUR course.Canadians: No. I say again you divert YOUR course.Americans: THIS IS THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS LINCOLN, THE SECOND LARGEST SHIP IN THE UNITED STATES` ATLANTIC FLEET. WE ARE ACCOMPANIED BY THREE DESTROYERS, THREE CRUISERS AND NUMEROUS SUPPORT VESSELS. I DEMAND THAT YOU CHANGE YOUR COURSE 15 DEGREES NORTH. THAT`S ONE - FIVE DEGREES NORTH.

We do not all speak french, Canada is probably the only country in the world where speaking french is not cool...4. Provinces, not states.....and three territories....5. We didn't invent hockey, we just made it better......6. If an American team wins the Stanley Cup, we know it doesn't matter because all the players are Canadian. However, if a Canadian team wins the world series, we ignore the fact that they are all American....7. If Don Cherry ran for Prime Minister, he would win...8. Our second national anthem is the theme to Hockey Night in Canada9. We have two TV Channels, Channel One is the CBC and it shows hockey games when the home team is in Canada, Channel Two is the CTV and it shows hockey games when the home team is in America, When there's no hockey, they broadcast cougar, bear and polar bear location reports -- so we know when it's safe to go outside.10. Our clocks are metric, So are the calendars. Our money gonna go metric next year. The reason why Canada is bigger than the US is that we use kilometers instead of miles. See, there are 2.5 kilometers for every mile, so that automatically makes Canada two-and-a-half times bigger, eh! Take is easy......~~q:"

The mosquitoes have landing lights. You have more miles on your snow blower than your car. You have 10 favourite recipes for moose meat. Canadian Tire on any Saturday is busier than the toy stores at Christmas. You live in a house that has no front step, yet the door is one meter above the ground. You've taken your kids trick-or-treating in a blizzard. Driving is better in the winter because the potholes are filled in with snow. You think sexy lingerie is tube-socks and a flannel nightie with only 8 buttons. You owe more money on your snowmobile than your car. The local paper covers national and international headlines on 2 pages, but requires 6 pages for hockey. At least twice a year, the kitchen doubles as a meat processing plant. The most effective mosquito repellent is a shotgun. Your snowblower gets stuck on the roof. You think the start of deer season is a national holiday. You head south to go to your cottage. You frequently clean grease off your barbecue so the bears won't prowl on your deck. You know which leaves make good toilet paper. The major parish fund-raiser isn't bingo it's sausage making. You find -40C a little chilly. The trunk of your car doubles as a deep freeze. You attend a formal event in your best clothes, your finest jewellery and your Sorrels.
