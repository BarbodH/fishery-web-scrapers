While there met some other great people--Kyle and Terri at Brace Lake Camps and Chad Haakenson ot Twin Lakes Wilderness Camps. The people owning the camps determine the success of your trips. Talk to them and then make your decision. Hurry year 2013 is quickly filling up.

However, what I do know is that the Novi show is a key one and I told myself ""make sure to book next years trip before the Novi show"".Unfortunately I thought the show ran in February, lol.Oh well, hopefully my first choice has openings."

1523537,Jaskonie,2013-01-14 11:11:00,80,It was really nice to see the owners of the camp we go to Andy and Amy Wilson. They do a great job with Camp Lochalsh and Loch Island. Two main camps and quit a few outpost cabins. Wabatongushi has a great Walleye and Pike Population we smoked um there in 2012. We are bringing in 30 guys in mid July 2013.The seminars and the tackle area at the Novi show are pretty decent. Drove all the way up from Aurora Ohio and wasn't disapointed. We are headed to the Cleveland show this weekend which will be a big letdown but its a good break from cabin fever.
