1897594,rommel,2013-06-25 17:56:00,369,"heading up to onaway lodge on lac seul 7/26-2/2 and was wondering if i could get some tips on color, size,and quantity of jigs for jigging with minnows. on my last trip to savant i just took unpainted jig heads. any help would be appreciated."
1897618,KC Walleye,2013-06-25 18:16:00,274,I will be fishing out of Onaway from 7/5-7/12. I can let you know what worked for our group.
1897650,115 optimax,2013-06-25 18:39:00,650,"If it is calm out you can get away with an 1/8 ounce jig with 8 lb test in 30ft of water,if its windy go to a 1/4 ounce jig.My favourite Lac Suel colour is chartreuse with a blaze orange top.(KILLER COLOUR)...Good Luck!!"
1897658,rommel,2013-06-25 18:39:00,369,That would be great. good luck up there.
1897698,rommel,2013-06-25 18:48:00,369,115 opti Do you ever have a need for bigger than 1/4 oz ?
1897706,bigwalleye1,2013-06-25 18:56:00,2632,"I tend to go heavier, like 3/8 oz. I can hold bottom easilyand can move faster looking for active fish, then step down in size once I find them."
1898162,115 optimax,2013-06-25 21:48:00,650,"No,the only time I use 1/4 ounce is when it's really windy and I don't even like using them then.If you can get a light jig to the bottom of deep water and still feel what's going on that's the way to go.Blaze orange with a black top is another good colour on Lac Suel."
1898194,rather-be-fishin,2013-06-25 22:08:00,429,"I have been fishing out of Fisherman's Cove Resort on Lac Seul right next to Onaway for 10 years now and go the same week you are going. We use 1/4 oz and 3/8 oz jigs with minnows with great success. Also use spinners with minnows/leeches. Color's that work well for us are: Chartreuse, pink, white, orange, purple, parrot. Klass holographic spinners in pink, orange, chartreuse, purple (you can buy these in Canada made in Winnipeg) work well too as well as Tommy Harris Spider Spinners. I Sent you a private message for more information. 4 1/2 weeks to go back to Lac Seul and can't wait! RBF"
1898234,roscoe33,2013-06-25 23:25:00,653,"weight of jig really depends on depth or water, wind/current speed, and line being used, mono, power pro, fire line, etc, all have different wind and water resistance. Also, how aggressively are the fish biting?"
