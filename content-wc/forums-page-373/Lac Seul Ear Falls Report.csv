1854954,Guest,2013-06-10 21:14:00,0,"Fished the Ear Falls area of Lac Seul from June 1 - June 7. - Three of us stayed at Gold Pines Camp. - Fished only in Sawmill Bay. - Weather was almost too nice. Mostly sunny and 60s & 70s all week. Not one drop of rain. - Water temps were mid 50s at start of week and mid 60s by the end of the week. - Water levels seemed a little higher than the last couple of years. - kept track of numbers and walleyes over 18 inches. - About 20% of our catch were walleyes over 18 inches. - Sat. Afternoon = 12 fish, biggest Walleye of the trip was 26 inches and caught trolling a Rapala shallow diver in 6 feet of water. - Sunday = 30 fish, another tough day. My brother caught a 42 inch northern on a jig and minnow. - Monday = 68 fish, fishing starting to improve. - Tuesday = 79 fish, getting better. - Wedneday = 117 fish, hit the mother load. - Thursday = 112 fish, still going strong. - Friday = 115 fish, nice end to the trip. We caught fish using all methods, but seemed to catch bigger fish casting crank baits, primarily #7 Rapala Shallow Diver in Hot Steel or Perch. Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday we fished one shoreline and bay that the wind was hitting in Sawmill. These fish were in less than 6 feet of water. Lots of people fishing the river mouth, but couldn't stomach fishing with 20 other boats. Caught several northerns between 30 - 37 inches, 7 smallmouths, and a rock bass that I thought was unusual. Trip was way better than last year and already looking forward to next year. Good luck to all!"
