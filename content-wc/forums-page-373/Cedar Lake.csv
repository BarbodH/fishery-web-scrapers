1888065,Kevin R,2013-06-22 07:45:00,305,I think it's near impossible to see any fish in cedar by August vis is zero. I fought a large fish 10 minutes the hook came out with about 3 feet of line out never saw the fish.
1888561,go dart,2013-06-22 10:57:00,77,If you took this to mean Perrault Muskie fishes as well as Cedar then your mistaken. Just mentioning there is good Musky fishing in that area of Perrault. I've paid my dues on both lakes. The dockhand out of RockyShore Lodge is an excellent big Pike/Muskie hunter. His name is Charlie. He shares his imfo and its spot on.
1891825,Terwalleye,2013-06-23 19:45:00,166,"Hey GentsJust got back late last night from 10 glorious days at Cedar. 10 days of fishing and 2 hours of rain. Air temps were a high in the low 70's. What a treat to ask for the sunscreen vs. putting on the rain gear. Walleye fishing was awesome. Fish were found on wind blown points in about 10-12 feet of water. Sunken reefs were or extended points were hot too. Wind was the key for the hot bite. Spots with fish produced regardless of wind; but the hot bite was definitely when the wind was pushing into them. Leeches were our bate of choice. Average fish was 17-18. Our boat landed 25 over 22 inches in last 7 days. Several over 25.Northerns and perch were swimming together anywhere there was shallow water with pencil reads or cattails emerging. Lots of dink perch; but casting white spinner baits into the same areas was a real hoot. Biggest northern was 35.Musky were still shallow. Found them in muddy bottom areas with warmer surface water. Caught my personal best, a 45 1/2 inch tiger. Beautiful fish and swimming again for y'all to hunt down. Caught a couple more myself and had numerous follows and short strikes. What a rush!Kudos again to the folks at Clarks and also a nod to Al at Cedar Lake lodge which is where we stayed the first few nights. Both awesome camps with helpful knowledgeable folks.51 weeks and counting until 2014."
1891993,Glenman12,2013-06-23 20:44:00,762,"I also got back last night and had pretty much the same experience as you guys..Biggest walleye for the week was 26 1/2"", biggest Northern was 36"", biggest Smallie was 18"" and the biggest Musky was 50"".. Two observations, at least from our experience..we caught more walleyes in the 20-22"" range than ever before..probably 30-35...and while not targeting northerns we caught a huge amount in the slot...maybe one or two snakes, at least in our boat.. never had the rainsuit on except for Sat morning and that was only the jacket to cut the wind..the most consistent hot spot for us was the short narrows just north of Al's island...me and my partner caught 6 walleyes 17-21"" on 6 passes on Sat afternoon til some clown saw our success and decided to drop anchor and jig the spot blocking our path.. All in all one of the best trips in recent memory all things considered.."
1897546,Gipper,2013-06-25 17:42:00,76,Way to go on the musky Terwalleye. Sounds like an awesome trip. Fishing the Manitowish Chain now but I'll be back by the weekend.
1897690,Terwalleye,2013-06-25 18:47:00,166,Don't worry; us working stiffs will keep the social security flowing. You just keep on fishing.
1861257,Glenman12,2013-06-12 20:06:00,762,You may have had your heart tested many times but theres a reason that Cedar is a Class A musky lake and Perrault isn't......more muskies on Cedar...Ive never seen a thread where Perrault has been recommended for muskies but Ive seen numerous ones where Cedar Lake has been..
1862321,team walleye,2013-06-13 07:06:00,336,"I think Cedar would be the better Musky lake I dont know if too many people will argue that with you, but you can catch them in Perrault."
1862633,BornToFish,2013-06-13 07:53:00,1224,"I'm curious as to why Cedar Lake is a ""Class A"" musky lake whereas Perrault Lake is not designated as such. I conducted a brief internet search and could not locate any information about Ontario having a classification system for musky lakes. Cedar and Perrault Lakes have the same size limit (54 inches) and bag limit for muskies. Cedar Lake is a tremendous fishery for many species of fish, including muskies. Another reason why I bias my musky fishing towards Perrault Lake (a replica) will be displayed in our family room next month."
1863465,Glenman12,2013-06-13 11:41:00,762,"you are correct about 54"" on Perrault and I did not know that..as for the Class A classification, this past winter I saw an episode of Jim Saric's Musky Hunter Show..they were fishing Cedar Lake out of Cedar Lake Camp..they were talking to the camp owner and he said the Class A was given to Cedar Lake by the MNR due to its habitat and forage base, this giving Cedar the ability to sustain a large population of muskys...Im paraphrasing as I don't remember word for word what he said but that was the gist of it..but for all I know Perrault could be Class A now..."
1865553,BornToFish,2013-06-14 05:09:00,1224,"GlenMan,I saw the episode of Musky Hunter this past winter that was filmed on Cedar Lake. I thought it was one of their better episodes ever. They surely caught some nice fish.I mostly fish Perrault Lake and have a fair amount of experience on this lake. I have ventured over to Cedar a handful of times and will give it more attention in view of the Musky Hunter tv show.I have an observation to share. I truly believe Cedar and Perrault are both nice lakes with great fisheries, but they are different from one another. I felt that fishing Cedar for muskies was more like fishing some of my home waters in Wisconsin. I just felt more comfortable on Cedar right away, such that it was as if I already knew what to do and how to go about it. Perrault Lake was more challenging to me. I had to work hard at it to learn how to fish this lake for muskies. Honestly, Perrault Lake made me become a more complete musky fisherman. At the end of the day, muskies are still muskies and they do what they want to do whenever they want to do it.I have chatted with several guides that fish both lakes. They have told me that Cedar Lake likely has more muskies per acre of water than Perrault Lake. This wouldn't surprise me a bit having seen both bodies of water.The muskies that I have seen and caught in both lakes are certainly worth my respect and attention.Good fishing this season!!"
1866697,wiegert51,2013-06-14 13:13:00,3,"Awesome thread! Glad I found it, we are heading north to Cedar Point Resort next weekend from Kansas for a week long stay and there is some invaluable advice/info in this thread! I've been there once two years ago but that was in late July and didn't have much luck on fish. Hopefully we're in for a much better trip this time around. Thanks for the posts and links!"
1871385,Gipper,2013-06-16 19:41:00,76,You should do well next week. We go mid July and the eyes are a little deeper and the musky are on the move. Good luck.
1871553,revitup,2013-06-16 20:38:00,140,"We just got back from a week of fishing at Cedar Lake. Great numbers and great size. I had a best of 23 1/2"" walleye and there were at least ten better than mine in our group. Best of group was 32"", followed closely by one at 31 1/2"". We've never seen it better at Cedar. 1/8 oz. jigs, tipped with minnows was the ticket. I also have to put in a thumbs up for Dave and Leanne Frostiak of Keystone Lodge. They were wonderful and took great care of us. Pictures are posted on their facebook page."
1884345,wiegert51,2013-06-20 15:40:00,3,Heading north tomorrow! Can't wait to get up there and start flippin wallys into the boat! My buddy is a bigtime smallie and crappie fisherman so we're gonna look for those too. I know where to find the smallies but anybody have any good advice on where to find the crappie?
1884393,revitup,2013-06-20 15:49:00,140,"When we were there June 8-15 crappie were found in Nelson, Richmond and down by the falls in the east end. water temps were right at 65, perfect for spawning."
1838721,Guest,2013-06-05 06:46:00,0,"I fish on Perrault Lake several times each season. My partner and I are contemplating taking a one day trip down Cedar River to fish on Cedar Lake - mostly to experience something new. Can anyone provide a map of Cedar Lake that shows navigational hazards? Do the lodges on Cedar Lake put out marker buoys to identify known ""famous"" hazards? Many thanks...."
1839249,Terwalleye,2013-06-05 08:57:00,166,"BtF, Yes, all the known hazards are fairly well marked. As a rule; if you stay in the middle you're safe. But here is one of the lodges' maps and it has them marked up well.http://www.keystone-lodge.com/map.html"

1842889,go dart,2013-06-06 09:58:00,77,I'll just throw this out there. You can fish the bays and points where Cedar and Perrault join ( just past the narrows on Perrault side) and the Muskie fishing is as good as Cedar. Have had my heart tested many times in that area.
1854338,nitroman,2013-06-10 18:37:00,368,Well our week was a tough one for sure! Had to work for the walleye we caught and the Nords and smallies were not very active. We brought home our limits and ate fish a couple times but they were defiantly scattered about. We were catching eye's in 21 to 27 ft one day and 6 to 12 the next. We caught more crappie this year than we ever have in areas that we never caught them before and most came from 20 feet to 30 feet down just east of gull island. Drifting slip bobbers with the wind across reefs and points seemed to be our best method along with jigging them at times. Evening crank trolling caught us some along with pitching jigs to the shores. Hope u all have a better week than we did cheers and keep your lines tight.
1856041,Glenman12,2013-06-11 09:01:00,762,Hey Nitroman..sorry to hear about your tough trip..sounds like you hit the post spawn period..we head up this Friday morning and Im hoping for better results than you got..
1857609,team walleye,2013-06-11 16:42:00,336,I have been hearing from people and lodges up that way that the fishing on Perrault right now is going hot and heavy.. did you try Perrault?
1858361,jimmie,2013-06-11 22:38:00,123,"Heading up for my first time on Cedar at Keystone lodge. Look forward to some good days there and learning the lake a bit. Love to small mouth fish and for all fish for that matter. Hope it turns out well and hope to return in late summer for musky as well as 'eyes, and smallies. I will try to get my sea/fishing legs on Eagal and a couple smaller lakes in Vermilion Bay area before Cedar and then heading to Sioux Lookout area after that. Hope this summer the weather is stable and so so darn hot as last year. Should be beter fishing in NW Ontario this summer. Good luck to all and be safe and have a great time on the water."
1858393,jimmie,2013-06-11 22:58:00,123,Don't be afraid to use a figure 8 by the boat. No need to over do it but if sunny have good sun glasses so when you see 'em you can coax them into biting your figure eight tatic. Regardless or the action or follows you may get have a great time and be safe. All those hooks can be dangerous LOL
1823793,revitup,2013-05-31 03:42:00,140,"X 2 on what Terwalleye said. Have a great trip, be safe and look forward to your report. Thanks for the conversations. Our group is following you up there a week from today!"
1826529,Gipper,2013-05-31 21:27:00,76,"Terwalleye, say again your departure. We are leaving Pleasant Prairie on the 12th of July. You go before musky opener, right?"
1826713,Terwalleye,2013-06-01 01:25:00,166,"GipperThe opening day is the 3 Saturday in June, so the 15th. We arrive the 12th, so ""yes."" But we will be there for a full week of Musky season."
1827297,Muskie Bob,2013-06-01 10:22:00,45,"MRG2180,I will be on Cedar the 3rd of July too, and fishing mainly for muskies. However, we do take some time out to catch a few walleyes. Most resort owners know good walleye areas. Several maps are marked with walleye locations,,,,weeds, points, etc. Actually, I have found out I enjoy catching perch, which I really like eating. I believe I like them better than walleye."
1831025,team walleye,2013-06-03 07:40:00,336,I'm heading up to Perrault in 2 weeks... I will be fishing on Cedar some as well. Any tips for a total novice on musky?
1833113,Gipper,2013-06-03 17:14:00,76,"Team Walleye:!. Know where the fish are. Find them yourself or have your resort guy mark a map. Cabbage, rocks, points.2. Go with the basics first....topwater and bucktails.3. Musky is a third each skill, knowledge and luck. 4. Believe you'll catch one on every cast or you will be defeated as a newbie. You can have a great time there by concentrating on walleye as you do but have a few musky spots to throw at, for a few minutes each day, on your way to walleye, and on the way back. Do some sundown stuff.That's what we do to please everyone and it works out."
1833337,Gipper,2013-06-03 18:44:00,76,That's the week we fished the first time at Cedar. It's great with muskies trying to nail the walleye you have on. Can you say Silver Wally Diver boys and girls?You don't have to leave Hatfield that week. We should get together for a recap after I get back.
1833609,Terwalleye,2013-06-03 19:32:00,166,"Gipper,Absolutely look forwarding to comparing notes again. I'd be happy to meet between trips if that becomes possible.As for your advice to Team Walleye; the one thing I would add; is we have always ""stumbled"" upon musky fishing for 'eyes. So my advice is fish where you know where the walleyes are. Pete mania always says ""if you find the refridgerator, you'll find the boogie man."" I know the ""boogie man"" has given me ""musky drawers"" more than once at the side of the boat. WHoooooa Nelllly! Usually followed shortly there after by chants of ""Again, again!!!"" It's a adrenaline rush, there is no doubt about that."

Although I expect them to be in post spawn by that time, instead of pre-spawn. Hope they're not in that slow time that occurs around the spawn for us. Thanks for the report."
1809818,Kevin R,2013-05-26 20:33:00,305,"I have only fished in June one time in Canada & I found the fish super aggressive easy to catch. Early July fishing is still exellent but by August it is much harder to catch fish. Locations can be a variety, fishing 15ft or less the bite will be aggressive but the fish don't stay up very long you have to get them when they come up to feed. I have caught walleye from 2ft to 45ft but the best depth is 12-15ft most of the time."
1809930,1jigfish2,2013-05-26 21:22:00,110,"We ONLY fish jig and minnow. Minnow size did not matter at all with numbers or size of walleye caught. Size of jig was VERY minor difference. The key to jig fishing is to keep the jig on the bottom. We used 3/8's a lot, because of wind. We changed jigging styles all week. Sometimes we dragged on the bottom, others with small twitches, others with jigging, others withjerking hard. Best colors were chartruese, green, and white.Be versatile, and I believe this is the deadliest way to get numbers. Try an area for about a half hour, move on if no fish.Any de ent lodge can give you hints on where to fish. We found new areas again, and we go every year.This year we caught a nimber of nice perch, found them in 8'. That was a bonus."

Tons of great tidbitshttps://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...rchid=10371226Heading back for our groups forth year. We have traditionally focused on walleyes. And historically saw and caught some Musky. My guess is you know the spots and just don't realize the walleyes are there and that is why the musky are.We love fishing the weed edges. The closer this weed edge is to deep water the better. Summer time, try pitching a slip bobber with a leech right on the edge of the weeds and just off the bottom. They are there. And the perch and the small mouth, etc etc."

Did we think it was worth while? We went up opening week a few weeks back, and are heading back up again in September. I do not believe you will be disappointed.

I posted in the other forum and everyone recommended I posted here about Cedar. I am looking for as much walleye information as possible. Our family fishes Cedar every year. Honestly, I mainly muskie fish but my grandparents love to walleye fish. Well the last few years they have not caught many at all so I am looking for any advise including any recommendations on guides in the area if they exist in order to try and put them on more fish. Any advise is beyond appreciated. We will be there the 3rd week in July. I would really like to learn about deeper water spots especially since we will be there in the middle of he summer. The lake is very shallow but in the other thread people mentioned walleyes in up to 25' of water. I would love to know where and what type of structure are they fishing. There isn't much 25' deep water I have fished. Any information is greatly appreciated."
