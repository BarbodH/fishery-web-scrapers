1889993,crawler catcher,2013-06-23 06:53:00,72,Elderly (almost 80) friend lost his passport while moving to a different house. Have they clamped down tighter in the last couple of years ? Do they have it on their computers that he has crossed at least ten times in the past five years with his passport ? He has his drivers license and birth certificate. Will that be enough to get back into the states ?Thank you

Marked me down as ""non compliant"" or something like that, and said don't do it again. Not sure I would admit to having lost it though. I'd say I forgot it, then once home again report it missing."

1891017,Guest,2013-06-23 14:29:00,0,I had a similar problem with my wife's passport last fall. We got into Canada and back in the States without a problem. She had her birth certificate and DL. I had called the border station in IFalls a week prior and they told me she cannot be denied entry back into the US if she is a US citizen. They suggested we bring her birth certificate and state issued DL. Got through the border going in and coming back in just a few minutes. The passport issue driving into the states is not as big a deal as published. Don't let it stop your trip!!
