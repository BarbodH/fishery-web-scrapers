Haven't fished that section of the lake before, looking to target musky, bass, and walleye. I have the chart for that section of the lake. Just wondering how the fishing is within a few miles of town, or if we should be looking to run out past split rock narrows into bigger water. Any info is appreciated and I will update with a trip report when we return. Thanks!"
