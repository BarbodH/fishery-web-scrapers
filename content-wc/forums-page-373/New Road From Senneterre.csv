1884385,Freytown,2013-06-20 15:49:00,770,Sounds like a great trip. What area of the Gouin did you fish? Thxs.
1884401,East coast,2013-06-20 15:53:00,32,"We were in the central portion, stayed at the Oasis du Gouin. Francois has treated us exceptionally well over the few years we have been going."
1884433,Freytown,2013-06-20 15:55:00,770,"Thxs, I love the Gouin & have only fished the western side."
1886169,eight4,2013-06-21 09:29:00,11,I am heading up to Oasis du Gouin on July 5. How was the fishing? I have been wanting to get to Oasis for a few years but my fishing partners always wanted to go to Baie Nord or Nemio.
1887193,East coast,2013-06-21 18:20:00,32,"We always go early in the season to target mainly pike but never have any trouble with the eyes. The camp is well located, target shores hit by winds, the area around the Oasis allows you to do this without being on large open bodies. Francois is knowledgeable and runs a great operation. Water was extremely high this year and it was a late spring. My guess is that you will be in for some great fishing. Wish I was going back in July too."
1887873,eight4,2013-06-22 06:11:00,11,"This will be trip number 6 to the Gouin for me. The more I go the more I can't wait to go back. I have been to 4 different out fitters and found every one to be perfect hosts,I just like the challenge of different areas. Like you I live in Nova Scotia and have to drive 17 to19 hours straight but it is worth every min. of it."
1888569,East coast,2013-06-22 10:57:00,32,"What part of NS are you from? We break up the drive, we go 12 hours to LaTuque, overnight and then 5 hours of good dirt roads to the pick up point. On the way back we stay in Edmunston and finish the last 6 hours the next day. We travel from Halifax, say hi to Francois for us, our reservation for next year is in and the countdown has already started!"
1889825,eight4,2013-06-23 05:28:00,11,"I am from Truro but I work in Halifax.We usually stay in La Tuque to but last year were late getting away and stayed about a hour from La Tuque. Got up in the morning got some bread,milk,beer and away we went for a week of fun and relaxation. Do the camp boats have seats? I have a couple of portable fold down seats I can through in if needed."
1890657,East coast,2013-06-23 11:14:00,32,"The boats are new (within the last 3 years) 16 foot aluminum boats with 4 stroke 20hp outboards. They put plywood on the floors to give you a nice level surface but no boat seats. We always bring our own portable boat seats and clamps, not to mention our own trolling motor and fish finder that I have rigged up for portable use. Let me know if you have any other questions before you go."
1771985,Guest,2013-05-13 19:20:00,0,Has anyone traveled the new road (2013) from Senneterre to the Gouin?
1772201,kegisfly,2013-05-13 20:47:00,22,Does such an animal really exist? Is it paved? Need info! Please don't tease us!
1772249,Freytown,2013-05-13 21:15:00,770,https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=215705Read the above thread.
1772521,kyle870,2013-05-14 04:33:00,26,Afriend talked to Adrian amonth ago and was told its there and will be marked. We think we can see it on satillite pictures 84 miles as the crow flys comes out just south of martins. We are going to call Adrian soon as we figure he is at Hibou.Iwill post what i hear.
1773897,Andre (wallyandre),2013-05-14 11:30:00,2274,If you fish the western part of the Gouin the new road will be the one to use; it's a very nice road.From Senneterre to l'Appel du Hibou it's a 1.5hr. driving.The Adolphe-Poisson bay is free of ice since 3 days
1774617,kyle870,2013-05-14 16:24:00,26,"WallyAndre thanks for the info. it will make a big difference for how we plan our trip. On the satillite map the west end looks like I-90, wonder how long it will be before we see the first jetski HA HA."
1795442,kegisfly,2013-05-21 18:34:00,22,"Looks like this road is still not an efficient way to go to Clova (Air Tamarac). Guess our group will stick with the old standard. It's not that bad, just annoying and long. Also appears to be a late ice out. Guess that should keep the fish in the shallows longer, depending on upcoming weather. Now, if we could only get some info. on Gouin water levels...Kirk"
1820753,tshea,2013-05-30 07:31:00,36,We stumbled across the new road while hunting last november. It terminates at Martins. We assumed that it went down to Clova. From what I have been reading it appears that it heads west to senneterre ?? Could someone confirm please. Thanks Todd.
1869201,kyle870,2013-06-16 05:07:00,26,"Just got back from the Gouin took the new and greatly improved rd. What used to take us up to 5hr. we made the trip in loaded with beverage and gas just over 2hrs. on the way out we made it in 2hrs. Oh the water levels are 3ft above full pool and still rising, the mosquitos were like somthing out of a cheap horror film but the walleyes and pike are FAT and snapping. Would leave right now to go back! Man i love that place."
1884289,East coast,2013-06-20 15:28:00,32,We have been going to the Gouin each year for the past 4 years. We tend to target mainly pike and this year was phenomenal. 7 pike landed that were 41 inches or greater with the largest coming in at 47 inches. What's the definition of fun......seeing a 40 inch+ gator take a 6 inch topwater rat in 2 feet of water. Reserved our dates for next year...let the countdown begin!
