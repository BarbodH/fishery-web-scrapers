We fish different then every one else as we only cast stick baits and when we fished the windy shore we did good. Flicker shads on steeper rock shores and shad raps as the shore got shallower and F13 floaters or shallow shad raps in water four foot or less and hot steel was a good color. For the northern the same, fish the windy shore, spoons or bucktails in shallow weeds and stick baits on the rock. Big walleye was 28"" and northern was 42"" with a couple dozen over 35"" but we did a lot of casting for northern. We were very surprised coming back across the border with only a ten minute wait compared to the usual two and a half hours when we got to the border at about ten."
1889593,WalleyeLundGuy,2013-06-22 21:06:00,2,i should be fishing Gull Rock a few days that week too! Let me know how you do.
1767209,jkwildhunting,2013-05-11 22:05:00,361,As Mondo posted in another post the ice is starting to break away! The owners at 5 Lakes said there should be open water to the island SOON.Hey tackleman you ready to be a fishing!?!?!?!?
1772425,tate05,2013-05-13 22:39:00,99,"Leaving on Friday, to see Lee, for opening week. I'll be looking to say hello to Tackleman!"
1851249,jkwildhunting,2013-06-09 18:55:00,361,"Headed up week from Friday. Hey Mondo, are you ready? Plenty of space in Camp!How has the fishin been for the people that have been up so far?Tackleman Hope to see ya on the lake prolla catch ya at Fisherman Point again or better at the 5 Lakes Dock!Good Luck to everyone, and be safe!!!"
1868105,jkwildhunting,2013-06-15 09:03:00,361,Hey tackleman! How has the fishin been? We leave a week from yesterday. Sounds like bug hatch has just ended. Hope to see ya at the camp or on water
1869025,tackleman,2013-06-15 21:42:00,444,"HI Joe.well everybody tells me the fishing is great. I have been out only a couple times and for an hour to an hour and a half each time. (**** work seems to get in the way)I spent some time on the flats off the gullrock and got enough for dinner in about 22 feet of water but everyone seems to think they are in the shallows at the north end . I was told that 2 island is hot right now. don't worry, I think they will leave you a few fish to catch.Have a safe trip up and i'll see you sometime over the week."
1870441,Moondog,2013-06-16 12:56:00,362,The Kon Tiki was over at 2 Island yesterday and didn't even get a bite. We were in the sanctuary yesterday for the opener and it was not impressive. So the question is where are the big mommas?
1870585,2746,2013-06-16 14:17:00,3206,Not there and don't know conditions but have they moved from the sanctuary as far as fisherman's point yet. Can find water there from shallow to deep. Post spawn fish will also move from the river into keg (if they are not still there) on down to the boot toe and heel.
1871809,tackleman,2013-06-16 22:13:00,444,"I spent an hour and a half at the boot fished both ends , not a bite the other day, today I went with my neighbour to the area around the sanctuary signs and in 5 feet of water it was fish after fish but they were all eaters nothing really big, but we did have some bigger northerns hit our eaters as we were pulling them in."
1872018,Guest,2013-06-17 06:29:00,0,Get this all worked out and posted so I know where to go week after next.
1874994,2746,2013-06-17 17:49:00,3206,Sounds like fun though and I bet you both had walleye for dinner.
1549584,jkwildhunting,2013-03-10 17:47:00,361,"Ok.....I think I started a post last spring on who was all going to Gull Rock for the 2012 season.So...lets start a 2013 post!We are headed up the last week in June to 5 lakes lodge and then again in September or so.Worked the Iowa Deer Classic last weekend and sat with the owners at 5 Lakes for all 3 days. Hearing all the stories bout the ice fishing up there has me VERY excited to get up there.By sounds they had 4ft of snow and 2+feet of ice up there and said the lakes should be normal or high this spring. Hope that is true last year the water was in good shape and fishing was great by the end of fall some of the falls we pass were starting to get ""dry""I have a few new spots to try this year and also a few more techniques I am gunna try to throw at the fish this year!?Tackleman you out there? Hope you are doing well and look forward to meeting you on the lake again this year!LaterJoe"
1549635,tackleman,2013-03-10 19:14:00,444,"i've been wondering where you have been, told the wife just last week i hadn't seen any posts by you for a while. hope you keep getting excited about coming up, i've been having fishing dreams for a few weeks now, so i know i'm excited.take care drivingup and we will meet you on the dock"
1549919,Guest,2013-03-11 12:05:00,0,"Hey Tackleman..... We're planning on coming up to Gullrock on opening day, May 18. What are the odds (gulp) that Gullrock will still have ice?"
1549979,tackleman,2013-03-11 13:42:00,444,there won't be ice . it should be gone by the end of April. (i'm hoping)
1550162,Tonyo,2013-03-11 19:05:00,212,JK our group will be up and visiting with Ian and Drew the first full week of June. Must be getting closer. I have been spending a lot more time on Walleye Central in the past couple of weeks. TonyO
1595690,jkwildhunting,2013-03-25 08:22:00,361,87 Days till we head...that is 87 to many days
1595722,Strickers cut,2013-03-25 08:34:00,33,"Atlease you get to go in June, I have to wait till mid-September. Plus I had to skip a year last year cause my wife was due to farrow in less than three weeks from the trip. Of coarse, last year was the best year in the many many years Ive been going too. Dads boat caught almost 600 walleyes for the week!"
1595842,jkwildhunting,2013-03-25 08:51:00,361,"Last year was indeed a great year. Our group found a spot and the last day we just hammered the fish. It was a riot with 6 other boats in the spot and one guy would catch a 24....few min later somone had another 22....then came along a 26. I was in the back of the boat and we had almost every size up to 26"" covered besides a 23"". Short while later wouldnt you know a 23"" swam thru.Fall trip was rough for us. It started good but by end of the week it was miserable slow. I think we had alot of factors playin against us but the week before we came was unreal.... alot mid 20s fish with a couple in the 28-29"" range."
1596562,Mondo,2013-03-25 11:27:00,61,"JK, We opted to schedule our trip 5 weeks after your party. Figured that would be enough time for the walleyes to get hungry again after your group is finished with em. Between your group and Tackleman, the fish run scared from mid-June till September. Mondo P.S. I'm just happy to catch a rock bass after following in your footsteps."
1596882,jkwildhunting,2013-03-25 12:20:00,361,Hey Now...one thing is do not fish my GPS cords because those are def the spots where there are NO fish
