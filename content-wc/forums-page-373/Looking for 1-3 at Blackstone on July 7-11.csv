He has gone to Canada since 1969 so if he says he really does not want to go I know it is really bothering him.We have 3 others scheduled to go. One of those has a daughter that is having pregnancy complications so he may be out as well. We are going in with Hidden Bay Lodge. I have made many trips with them in past and keep going back. This will be 3rd year at Blackstone. Size of walleyes has been outstanding. Our numbers have been good but not outstanding but feel we are still learning lake.If anyone is interested in this trip send me a private message. We can take 1,2 or 3 people. We sleep in base camp on Saturday night. Fly in Sunday (July 7) morning. Fly out Friday (July 12) morning."
