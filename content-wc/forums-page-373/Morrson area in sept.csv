1890129,ftfarms,2013-06-23 07:28:00,444,Thinking of booking a trip in the morrson area on lake of the woods we can go either the 14-21or 21-28 what week would you go? We mainly fish walleye and smallies but would love to get in on the crappie bit also. Thanks for any advice.

(of course if I lived there this wouldn't be a question) For my experience, the closer to ice over the better the bite but in general the worse the weather. Best time to hit a crappie and walleye bite is usually about the 2nd or third week of September but every year is different depending on weather changes. I have hit it just right at times in the middle of September. Other times that time frame was to early or to late. You just have to pick a time and hope for the best. Last year we were there the first week of October and had high wind, pouring rain, and 9 inches of snow in an area from Baudette to Grand Rapids. Have been there on the third week of September and had great weather and fishing. You really just have to book the time and take your chances. Even if the weather limits you to just a few days of good fishing it is still better than not going. Even a few days of good fishing gives me my money's worth. I know this isn't much help but it really can be a crap shoot late in the year, but when you can get on the water, the rewards can be fantastic. Bill, you beat me to the post again!"
