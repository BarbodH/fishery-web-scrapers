1893201,octanehi5,2013-06-24 10:11:00,1104,"we enjoy the same amount of day light., the first week in July ,day break is 4 am and dark around 1030, It all depends on how far north you are."
1893377,wallydave,2013-06-24 11:57:00,2151,"I have always been a early June Ontario trip guy. I mainly jig for walleyes, so the early pattern for walleyes works best working a jig and minnow or leech. Last several trips have been mid-June, while jigs still work, the pattern is changing, so I need to improve/change my methods! Good luck, no matter when you go!"

1882881,Obabikon,2013-06-20 08:09:00,2370,"My favorite is the first week in September. The fish are starting to school, no bugs, end of summer weather... it's just a great time. I have guests that only come up in June and other guests that only come up in July, August, September, or even May. Everyone has ""their"" time. I think it's probably the same reason that many people stop at the same gas stations, eat at the same restaurants, sleep in the same hotels, and buy the same beer... You try to capture the previous trips, and in a way, you do. It's ""your"" trip, and no one else does it the way you do!!!! Good luck out there everyone, and make a bunch of memories!"
1886673,Jaskonie,2013-06-21 12:23:00,80,"When our group first starting going we went along with what we thought was the best and had always heard the sooner the better. I think we all thought that because everyone we knew went after school was out the first week of June. That being said the weather was differant each of our first three trips up to Canada, on the third trip up the weather was cold North and east winds, the fish had locked jaws, during this trip and sensing our frustration our outfitter at the the time asked why we came up so early. ""We told him this is the best fishing time right?"" He then told us why not wait untill the weather stabilizes and the Walleye and Pike get in thier summer patterns. We know wait till July every year. No black flies, stable weather and the fish are on thier summer patterns. It has worked out great for us."
1886689,adempsey,2013-06-21 12:38:00,963,"I LOVE early fall fishing. It's my favorite time of year to be outdoors. However, my ""big"" annual trip with my brother and father has always been at the end of June/beginning of July at bass opener. When we were kids my father would take us bass fishing every year. That was 30 years ago, but we have never changed the week. Always seemed like a good time to go."
1890961,tsquared,2013-06-23 14:03:00,57,"Just got back from first June trip. Usually go in August. Walleye certainly more active, biting on everything from cranks to jigs, etc. Black flies were rough at times, but certainly nothing that would factor in my decision about trip time."
1891001,octanehi5,2013-06-23 14:21:00,1104,"Usually June fishing is better than anytime of yr. But giving the cold long spring we had , July will become the jewel this yr. Most yrs June is it , my favorite is third week in June. we leave for the great north in 6 days"
1891073,keek,2013-06-23 14:46:00,1003,You guys scored this year in the week you reserved! Hope you and the group have another amazing week on that special Lac. I'll be thinking about you guys and wishing I was there! As always - have fun.
1891889,octanehi5,2013-06-23 20:11:00,1104,"Thanks Keek,As many times as I have been to this lake,It still makes me feel like a kid in a candy store. I will report when we get back"
1892849,Aaron-IN,2013-06-24 08:05:00,500,I just returned from my second trip in three weeks to NW Ontario and never had to get the bug spray out of my bag.....fishing was outstanding both weeks.
1893129,Terwalleye,2013-06-24 09:43:00,166,One reason in favor of June not mentioned yet. It is light out until 10 PM. We fish stained water and the walleye bite can be hot all day. No reason to get up at 5 AM on vacation. We just fish our 12 hours from 10 to 10.
1880185,hoppy63,2013-06-19 10:19:00,367,"Question for all you veterans who have made many trips to Canada fishing. It seems from the few people I know first hand and from reading on different forums, that June is when many people want to go. My question is why? After hearing horror stories of the various bugs, needing to tape up, wear bug suits, hearing people say they could hardly breath with all the bugs, and one even.saying ""good luck when you have to unzip to relieve yourself"". What am I missing? I have only been fortunate enough to make one trip so far....( I'm hoping on at least several more), but it was late Aug., beautiful weather, stand out at night admiring beautiful sky, maybe enjoying a cold one, and might get bit a few times but not even using any sort of spray, and catching eyes all day long. Interested in replies.....thanks"

1880281,Ogoki,2013-06-19 11:20:00,291,I have been on 37 fly in trips plus much fishing on numerous bear hunts. Just got back last night from 9 days in the bush. From my experience I have done much better for numbers of walleye and trophy pike in June than in any other time of the year. My next favorite time is late August or early September . This past trip my my wife alone had 5 trophy pike. 39 to 44 1/2 inchers and all released I might add. I had one walleye go 28 inches and numerous 22 to 24 inchers . If my wife did not teach school we would also go around Labor Day. This past trip I got bit 5 times and only used bug spray twice . The bugs were getting worse by the end of our 9 days . Just my thoughts.
1880297,Larbo,2013-06-19 11:26:00,231,June is the first trip of the year and is always thought about during the cold winter months when starring at the calendar. I have liked the end of June because spring is in the air and fishing can be great for all species. My favorite month is middle of September because all fish are putting on the feed bag. I seems that for me spring is for walleyes and the fall is for muskies with smallmouth sprinkled in both trips.Weather is always a factor any time of the year be it cold or hot. I just ask the wind to lay down a little and not blow me off my spots.
1880313,jimmie,2013-06-19 11:30:00,123,"June can be the prime time especially after a looooong winter like this year. Families tend to take thier vacations in June as well. The biting flies can be a problem but just wear long pants and socks help a great deal. A good bug spray helps just as much. later in the year (August) the bugs are down and the first cool nights (Aug) seems to tame them quite a bit. Bugs come out in June anyway and more prevelent in the eveings. The skeeters love water so they can seem more that they really are as a nusiance. Folks seem to think too that fishing is better poat span and it often is. However, I have fished the Vermilion Bay area and the Sioux lookout areas more recently and have found fishing to be good to great after June and alot of fols are not around then."
1880361,Mike Borger,2013-06-19 11:50:00,1554,"If I had to pick one favorite month it'd be August for sure. Warm stable weather, no bugs, the walleye are on their summer spots and predictably easy to catch."
1880441,LOW1,2013-06-19 12:33:00,2828,"Any time between May 20 and October 10 is a good time.We don't have the bug problems that I have heard about. Keeping the grass cut around the cabin and being open to a breeze helps a great deal. I wouldn't make decisions based upon bug concerns, but do bring bug spray and long pants and shirts.I like the end of September because of the color of the maples, the cold nights, and the yet-still-warm water. Fishing is never going to be bad. It frequently was better the previous week but that can't be helped."
1880449,dog2,2013-06-19 12:34:00,198,"I have fished May,June July August,September and Oct. In May the weather can make wild swings and so does the fishin,June fair amount of rain equals flies and mosquitoes The weather and fishing are both picking up.July is a favorite month because black flies are down still have mosquitoes good pattern fishing same with august, now comes Sept., and Oct weather cools down bugs are going also, The fish are putting on the feed bag ,find a good area and rack the numbers up.The days are shorter so that is a problem in late Sept. and Oct.We cannot fish as long Im partial to mid late july long days on the lake but [the big but ]you have to work around the may flies. So it's basicly when we want to go or when everyone can set their vacation up to match."
1880721,epiepenburg,2013-06-19 14:21:00,365,"Just got back from 8 days in northern Ontario, didn't use bug spray once. Yes there was Mosquitos, but with any sort of wind they tended to stay in the woods and off the water."
1881137,hoppy63,2013-06-19 16:49:00,367,"Great answers guys! My two best guesses were confirmed early......one being the ""can't wait"" factor the other being maybe slightly better/ bigger fish, depending on what you are after. Glad to see that august-september is favorite time with many. Can't say I'll never do early trip, but with weather I experienced, lack of bugs, and great fishing we had in late august, would be tough move!"
