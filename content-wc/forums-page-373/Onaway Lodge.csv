Said walleye were starting to move to reefs. Average walleye they caught was 24"" long! You should be getting some more updated reports soon, since most people come home on Saturday. I know how the excitement is and getting updated reports always help! Good Luck! Only 5 weeks to go and counting down the days to our trip to Fisherman's Cove on Lac Seul RBF"
