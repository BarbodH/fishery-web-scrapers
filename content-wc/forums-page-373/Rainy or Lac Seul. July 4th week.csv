1879041,OldRook,2013-06-18 20:30:00,16,"Providing I can find an opening at a camp on either lake at this short notice What say you?? Rainy or Lac Seul?? Wife, son, dog and I. Fairly experienced fisher folk. Fished both lakes a number of times. Have not taken a vacation this year yet and I am ready. Any ideas?"
1879177,Nimstug,2013-06-18 21:03:00,2605,Never been to Suel but have fished the far ends of Rainy at Kettle Falls and Camp Narrows. From what I understand Fourth of July the camps are usually looking for larger than a party of three to fill the cabins. You never know if they get a late cancellation and would be happy to have a group of any size show up. You got nothing to lose by calling either of the above places or one of the places you read about here about Suel and see what they say. Have fun!

1881617,rather-be-fishin,2013-06-19 19:47:00,429,I have fished both Rainy & Lac Seul. Lived on Rainy Lake for a summer too. Have fished Lac Seul for 10 years. If your wanting to fish Walleyes numbers & size... Lac Seul is the lake to go to! 6 weeks to go & counting down to our trip to Lac Seul!!! Rather-Be-Fishin ..... Lac Seul!
1881673,OldRook,2013-06-19 20:01:00,16,Thanks all! Camp narrows has a slot. Think we are taking it
1890905,Guest,2013-06-23 13:22:00,0,"I would have to say without a doubt that Rainy Lake has bigger walleye then Lac, I haven't heard much about 12pounders being caught up there like Rainy Lake. I can also help with setting you up somewhere, me being local I can save you some money on your trip and help you with spots. email me [email protected]"
1890945,OldRook,2013-06-23 13:30:00,16,Thanks all We booked with camp narrows. They had an open cabin and we will get into town next Saturday evening. Appreciate all the responses!!!
1896682,Guest,2013-06-25 12:39:00,0,"Your right in the prime location, you can fish NWB or go north to the Manitou Sound/Alexandria and fish the humps. Both leeches and minnows are working right now with jigs, I'm sure other tactics will work too. And if you like catching smallies, Stanjikoming Bay is hot right now with bass being caught up to 23inches. Hope you have a great time up here, get ready for some monsters!!!"
