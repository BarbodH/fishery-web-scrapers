Rods are packed - check, Reels re-spooled - check, tackle box full - check, leather boots re-coated - check, Guidewear ready - check, camera charged - check, rest of the gear packed - check. Sounds like it's time for me to be catching a jet airplane and head north! Will post a report when I get back. Good luck everyone!"
