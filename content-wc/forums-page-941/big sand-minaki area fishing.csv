522185,Guest,2002-07-06 16:48:00,0,WE WERE UP THERE LAST FULL WEEK IN JUNE THE FISHING ON BIG SAND WAS GREAT FOR WALLEYES WE CAUGHT LOTS OF TWENTY PLUS INCH FISH IN EIGHT FEET OF WATER. MOST BY TROLLING LEECHES OR WORMS. NORTHERN FISHING WAS KIND OF SLOW MAYBE THE HIGH WATER HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT. GOOD LUCK AND POST WHEN YOU GET BACK BILL
