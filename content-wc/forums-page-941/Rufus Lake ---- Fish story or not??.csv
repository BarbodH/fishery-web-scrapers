522086,Guest,2002-07-01 17:06:00,0,I was at a party yesterday and a guy there had a brochure from Rufus Lake Outfitters in his hand telling about the great trip he and 3 others just came back from. I asked him about it and he said that the 4 of them caught over 400 walleyes from this lake and other lakes connecting to it in 5 days. I have heard that that chain of lakes has been pressured a lot over the years and that many walleyes sounds like a fish story or not-- anybody fished this area recently?If they did catch that many-Great!thats alot of wallies in 5 days.

But Many trips that would be the count for 2 people if not 1 on several trips. I beleave it. Last trip with my wife we had 30 double before lunch (on several days) now thats the place I'd like to go to agin!"
