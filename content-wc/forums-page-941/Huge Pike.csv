Big bonus came on last Thursday caught a 48"" Pike on 6lb line with a jig and minnow. I dont like to fish for Pike so I dont but this was one great battle on my 6' Walleye Rod. When we netted him he went through the net but we got him in the boat measured and Kodaked him and released him. Caught him about 1/4 mile west of the entrance to Williams Bay."
