522046,Guest,2002-06-30 18:10:00,0,"The Bureau of Vital Statisics tells me it may take as long as 3 weeks to get me a copy. What are the chances they would accept a Military DD214 - Drivers License (with pic)- Work ID (with pic) if the certificate is not here by Friday? Or do the odds really suck and I will be turned away at the border. The problems lies in that my birth place is in another state.Yeah yeah I know planning stinks, the wife and I thought for sure we had one."
522047,Tracy,2002-06-30 18:51:00,376,"They did not even ask for one when we crossed at the SOO 2 weeks ago. I had it along, but the other 3 in our group did not. You should be ok with all of your other supporting documents.Tracy"
522048,Guest,2002-06-30 19:47:00,0,Thanks for the feedback Tracy. I guess I will just toss the dice and see what rolls up and pray that it's not snake eyes and I have to turn around.Kevin
522049,Guest,2002-07-01 06:12:00,0,I've been across several times this year. They haven't asked. If you have a drivers license you're o.k.
522050,retire55,2002-07-01 06:38:00,1029,"Hello KevinE:I don't believe the question of whether you will be allowed entry into Canada needs to be a ""crapshoot"" as you suggest.The Citizenship and Immigration Canada web site: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/index.html provides the following advice:""Contact a Canadian embassy, high commission or consulate for information on what you will need before coming to Canada"" and they provide a hyperlink to an information page for those services which is http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/offices/missions.htmlUnder Western Hemisphere, you will see United States. There, contact information is provided for Buffalo, Detroit, New York, Seattle, Los Angeles and Washington D.C.It would appear that a simple telephone call could eradicate any questions. Jay"
522051,Guest,2002-07-01 08:46:00,0,"Well according to the Canadian Embassy, A US Driver's License, Voter Registration Card, US Amateur Radio License, Military Discharge Form DD-214 are not acceptable forms of Identification. Only 2 types of ID are acceptable, Birth Certificate (Odd since it has no picture on it to compare) and a Passport. I guess I could fly to Winnipeg to meet my party since the airline rules seem to be less of a Puzzle Palace type operation. Or I may just fly to Mexico and fish there while the others fish Canada. Geez, I am about as white bread as they come."
522052,retire55,2002-07-01 10:43:00,1029,"Hello again KevinE:I listened to the automatic telephone messages at Canada Customs this afternoon about entering Canada. Apparently, Canadian customs agents are presently increasing vigilence about entry into Canada - no doubt because of increased concern for attacks on the USA this week. The message goes on to say that all persons trying to enter Canada should be prepared to show photo identification AND proof of citizenship.Today is a holiday in Canada and consequently, it's impossible to talk to a customs agent via telephone. Numbers on their web site for calling from outside Canada are:(204) 983-3500 and (506) 636-5064 (long distance charges will apply)Regret that I can't be of more help. Jay"
522053,Guest,2002-07-01 13:25:00,0,"I may have a solution. I called the county where I was born in Iowa and talked to the county recorder about getting a copy of my birth certificate sent to me by Friday, instead of waiting the 20 to 35 from the state. Well After buying 2 Overnight FedEx Mailers (one for request and one for the return) for $25.00 each I hopefully will have it in my hot little hands by Friday. /* cross fingers and toes"
522054,Guest,2002-07-02 20:53:00,0,"Kevin, I am not sure where you're crossing on Friday, but let me share with you my experience last week. It was my first trip to Canada. I had my dad and Uncle with me from NYC and I told them to get a copy of their b.c before they flew to the Twin cites to head up to Canada. We crossed over in different areas in Canada and we weren't asked for anything. Bedding that the worms were in and that was it. We crossed at the crossing 50 miles South of Thunder Bay, ON and last Wednesday we crossed at Fort Francis/ Intl Falls and it was the same thing there. It was a 10 second stop for both trucks that crossed at two totally different locations. Have a good trip. I know it changed me. I will go to Canada once a year now."
522055,Guest,2002-07-03 07:59:00,0,Got my birth certificate this morning by FedEx. Look out fish you are in a heap of trouble now.. At least I hope so anyway.
