Her just being around the boat will help her to get used to it. I wouldn't try force it, as it might make her more afraid of it."

They really like the catching part, and soon you will have them hooked on fishing. I have four daughters, and they all like to fish, although the oldest who is 19 now seems to have other more important things to do. Keep trying , keep thinking, keep fishing."
