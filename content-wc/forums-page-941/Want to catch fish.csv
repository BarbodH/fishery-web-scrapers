522142,Guest,2002-07-04 05:30:00,0,Me and two of my girlfriends are looking for a resort that we can stay in a cabin at and catch some nice Walleye. We would like to stay within 200 miles of Int Falls and keep the weeks cost below $500 per person. All three of us girls have fished before but we have never caught Walleyes....please help...Thanks a Bunch
