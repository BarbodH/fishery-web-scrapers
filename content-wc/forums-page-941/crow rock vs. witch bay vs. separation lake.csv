The camp is run as a fish camp -- nice cabins (but community bathrooms), good food, and very nice equipment. Last year, the walleye fishing was outstanding. We caught lots of 20""+ walleye doing everything from tossing jigs (1/4 oz. w/power bait 3"" grubs) to casting and trolling crankbaits (shad raps primarily) to bottom bouncing. The northern fishing was good, but not lots of ""big"" fish. I think we boated 8 fish in the 32"" to 35"" range, but lots of smaller fish. Everybody at camp is talking about seeing the effect of the slot limit on the northern fishery. Since I have no track record, I can't comment on that, but the camp at least thinks the northern fishing is getting better each year. The musky action was slow last year when we were there (high water caused a late spring type of effect -- that's why we are going a couple weeks later this year). We boated one fish (32"") and saw a number of nice fish (high 40s, maybe one in the 50"" range). Likewise, the smallmouth fishing was decent, but slow for the bigger fish. Last year, we would catch a lot of smaller males (13""-15""), but only a few in the 17"" range. We used jigs, spinner baits, and shad raps. Had only 1 or 2 hits on the surface with floating raps. According to the pros in camp, the bass had just completed the spawn a week or so before we got there, and were not back on the bite full force. As evidenced by my return, I liked the camp and the fishing."

Separation Lake on the other hand, I had a very different experience. First of all I have no doubts that the fishing is spectacular on Separation/English River. As for the resort on Separation, I'm sure it's guite nice from what I saw, but I did not stay there. I did however camp at the campgrounds. Many people on this board rave about the campgrounds as far as it being clean. While it would be unfair to say that it's dirty, it ain't great. The gal Barb was pleasant enough. My opinion is somewhat slanted because I showed up and the river was the highest and fastest that it had been in ten years according to Barb. My Pro-V with consel steering is fine for the rollers that I normally fish in, but I have to tell you that I really think you need a tiller set up to fish this river system affectively.I was coxed into making this trip because of the chance of catching a big walleye was a real possibility. I'm sure that chance exists. After going up and down those big rapids half a dozen times, I realized I can catch just as big of walleyes on my home lake. I pulled the plug and headed east to my home lake. The next morning I hooked two 30"" walleyes and several in the mid-twenties. Home is where the heart is and mine isn't on the English River."
