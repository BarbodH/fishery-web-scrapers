521886,Guest,2002-06-26 07:25:00,0,We fished Indian lake outside of Ignace for seven years. Haven't been up there for four years now. Was wondering if anyone still fishes Indian and how are the numbers of walleyes. Is the resort on the north side of the lake still open and does the same clown(Harold) run it that ran it six years ago? Any information would be great.
