The group will mainly be targeting smallies and pike, but I want to really hit on the walleye action. I live in Kentucky and I don't have a lot of walleye experience. I've read a lot and understand the patterns. We'll be fishing out of 14' lunds with small outboards, so that may limit our type of walleye fishing. I would appreciate any info and specifics on this area and how to fish for walleyes or other species at that time of year. I would consider hiring a guide for a day there, but any other info would help. Thanks a lot."

Done the best with silver blades. Bait with minnow. Troll around shorelines, reefs, saddles, points...any likely looking spot. Early morning and Dusk offer the best payoff.

522118,Guest,2002-07-04 06:02:00,0,Mercutio and Marmion are two of the better walleye lakes. I beleive Nym also has walters. A guide is not a bad idea.
522119,Guest,2002-07-05 20:18:00,0,"I have fished a few of those lakes in that area, mostly Nym lake. Nym is agood smallmouth lake, from what I understand it was once a walleye lake, but now smallmouth is the dominate species. I have not fished Eva, but I doubt that it has very good walleye fishing, being along a major highway with a good boatramp usually means they get hit pretty hard, there are exceptions, but to get to the best walleye your going to have to go back in the bush. Perhaps the lodge owner can steer you to an outpost lake in the area , where you could carry a 14' boat to. Or you could canoe into Quetico, and experience the worlds best smallmouth, and farther in, great walleye. But im thinking along that highway it could be a little less than youre dreaming about. To go that far one should not be dissapointed, they are in the area but not as abundant as northwest Ontario."
522120,Guest,2002-07-06 08:04:00,0,"I've spent a few weeks at the cabin on Mercutio over the years. We flew in but they also drive to it from Camp Quiteco, a long bumpy road in from what I hear. Big lake, maybe 20 miles long, some good fishing but for a day or two trip I'd recommend a guide. There are some good spots but there is also a lot of less-than-productive water. Walleye were generally around the shoreline down about 10-15 feet. Some big pike at the far northwest end. Trolling with gold/black shallow diver Rapalas, jigs w/bait, spoons for the pike. Often the walleye were in 3-4' of water at noon on sunny days...go figure. Erie dearies with crawlers were my choice and I usually caught as many as anyone else. If I were going back there, I could get by for the week with about a half dozen each of Rapalas, Daredevles, and about a dozen Erie Dearies. I don't remember catching any smallies on this lake."
