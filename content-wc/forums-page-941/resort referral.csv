Its about 3 hours north of International Falls on Lac Seul/ American Plan resort with superb boats (Lund 18's with 80 hp 4-stroke Yamaha's). Guides are terrific with kids, they work hard for you, the camp manager is superb with kids (on nights my son did not want to fish, the camp manager would take him for a drive to see wildlife (bears, moose, etc., and the food is terrific (especially this year with a new chief). Its in the middle of Lac Seul so you don't see as many boats as you do at the two ends which have more resorts. Most people come for the walleye fishing which is outstanding. They have good northern fishing and the bass is underutilzied as they are not super common in the area yet. The bass are there in spots, but the real star of the show are the walleyes. We were up in early June and despite being there when the bad weather went through, we still caught lots of fish and some very nice sized fish. My son does not live to fish (not like his old man), but every year he wants to go back because of the great friendly staff, the solid fishing, and the good eats. They have a web site that you can check out that not only gives you the story on the resort, but the owner keeps terrific records of the fish that are caught and he posts those. And, the guide are honest, if the guide says the fish measures 29 inches, you can bet a day's pay that is actually 29 inches and not streched or fudged. Great resort and a super place to get a son started in fishing. The only downside, he might think all places are this nice and have such great fishing. Thats a downside I can live with. :)"

Great accomodations, service, and fishing. Pricing is similar to Silver Water Wheel which I have heard equally great things about. However when we called Silver Water Wheel, they were pretty well booked-up and could not accomodate out requested dates. If you want further info, post a response w/ a e-mail address and i'll get in touch. Good Luck."

I met them at the Sioux Falls out door show earlier this spring. I booked the trip for 6 guys including myself. You can fish 6 lakes from the main Lodge. Lake Trout is what the main lodge cabin is known for. But, we fished all walleye and northern lakes the week we were there. Cliff and Denise Long were awesome. The fishing was top notch and the boats did the trick for us. I highly recommend staying at Cobblestone lodge. They might be booked for the summer, but who knows for the fall. Let us know what you decide to do. It is always good to hear if you go with a resort that people on this board have been to in the past. Here is the website: www.heartland.on.ca/cobblestoneTell Cliff and Denise hello for me. Again, I was there last week.Kevin Lowerre"
