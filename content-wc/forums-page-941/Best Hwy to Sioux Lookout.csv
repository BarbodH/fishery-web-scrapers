522063,Dean,2002-07-01 14:15:00,60,We're traveling to Sioux Lookout via Int'l Falls on Wednesday. Is hwy 502 still the best way? What of hwy 622 to the east as an alternative? I've used it in the past to avoid the slower campers and such. Just wondering since the past rainstorms hit the area.Thoughts?Dean
522064,Guest,2002-07-01 16:43:00,0,I traveled 599 to Siver Dollar from Ignace and drove 642 from Silver Dollar to sioux Lookout. I think I only saw 2 or three cars the whole time. I saw more moose and deer than cars or people. Decent road and good scenery. Make sure you have plenty of gas before gettng out too far from a town.

Started going up along Lake Superior and thru Pigeon river. Takes longer, but seemed safer. 622 might be a good altervative if a person can make time on it."
522066,Dean,2002-07-02 06:52:00,60,The last time I traveled 622 was a couple of years ago going from Int'l Falls to Ignace. The road was very good and I see that the distance to Sioux Lookout is about the same using either 622 or 502. I was just wondering about the condition of the road after the recent rains. I am inclined to use 622 unless anyone can advise me otherwise.Dean
