521974,Guest,2002-07-02 04:23:00,0,"JohnThanks for all your advice, I called the camp owner last night and he also said that the fishing pattern was different this year and the guests up to this point had to adapt. He also told me by the time I go there which is 7/13 the fish will probably have moved. We for the last four years have fished the third week of July now we are going one week earlier. My most successfull techniques were a jig/minnow on mid lake structure and points in 15-25 feet. It will be interesting to see if that will hold true this year.In your experience how would you rate this year with others?ThanksJeff"
521975,Guest,2002-07-02 06:22:00,0,"I would say slower than normal. Alot of smaller walleyes. Excellent crop for the coming years. We rarely fish northerns, but normally land several walleye fishing. the ones that we caught were small, only two keepers. The perch had good size to them."
521968,Guest,2002-06-28 14:46:00,0,"HelloI am heading to the Gullrock two weeks from today, was wondering if there is any reports out there from this last week?ThanksJeff"
521969,Guest,2002-06-29 05:51:00,0,"Just returned. The lake is extremely high. Stuff floating all around. The fish are not in their regular locations, the late spring and all of the rain has changed their pattern. We caught alot of walleye, but not in their normal location. Biggest was 28 or 29"" and real fat. Probably 9 pound. Two days we caught all too big or too small.The eyes were in 7 feet of water. Keg Lake was dead. Alot of action on Fishermans point, three sisters and in that area. Also the clay banks.With the temps going from the 70's to the 90's in one day and the forecast is 90's for several days, I imagine they will go deep.Good luck."
521976,SWeed,2002-06-30 15:27:00,66,"which camp are you staying at?? just curious... I was up there for the opener and really enjoyed the lake, fishing was slow, due to late ice....You should have great fishing.."
521977,Guest,2002-07-01 06:17:00,0,"Where do you stay, SWeed?"
521970,Guest,2002-07-01 09:02:00,0,"Thanks for the report, to answer Sweed we stay at five lakes lodge on the southern end.I do have a few questions1. Where is fisherman's point I am not familiar?2. Did you fish any traditional spots, sunken island, boot island, burnt island, or the boot?3. Did you go into Ranger Lake?4. How did you find the fish considering they were not acting normal?Thanks for any advice.Jeff"

521971,Guest,2002-07-01 10:57:00,0,"Fisherman's point is up near the entrance to ranger. There are a bunch of ice houses on the bank. Three sisters is up there also. We fished burnt and it was dead, boot island was fished by many, but we didn't fish there. The Clay Banks were hot. Also the channel to Keg. Keg was not very good."
521979,SWeed,2002-07-01 12:29:00,66,We stayed at McEwens North Shore. It is located on Two Island lake. Really nice cabins and close to the water. I'll be going back there next year.
521972,Guest,2002-07-01 14:04:00,0,"JohnThanks for the information, how did you figure out the patterns? What was the best bait?I was reading an old posting you talked about a point off the high backs, do you mind sharing where that is?Have any luck with northerns or perch?ThanksJeff"
521973,Guest,2002-07-01 20:12:00,0,"Jeff- I normally will slow troll around an area until I mark fish and then fish from there. I'm not a jig fisherman, but that is where I would anchor.When we find fish,my son or whomever is with me will use a spinner and i will use a lindy rig, or just a hook and 1 bead. One will use a crawler and one a minnow. this year was funny, they would hit like crazy on minnows for awhile and then stop and hit the crawlers.I fish the point off the high bank towards Burnt island. Also had luck on the opposite side of the high banks."
