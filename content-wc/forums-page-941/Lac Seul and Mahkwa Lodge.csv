521691,guide7,2002-07-01 20:21:00,70,"Archie's is selling the gas at the landing along with his store. Didn't go into the store but do know that they do not want a bunch of gas cans at the camp. Their insurance company has advised them to limit the gas amount customers store at camp. If your renting their boats make sure to check the tank in the morning. they have always been good about service but failed us a couple mornings. Andy was off and a couple rookies were on dock. We ran out north of the Trading post mid morning. The pup can got us back. Full tank lasts all day with lotsa runnin in the 40hp 4 strokes.Lotsa fish, mostly on rocky island points, in windward areas.good luck 7 out"
521681,zugbug,2002-06-22 21:04:00,67,"Mike, went out on Erie on Wednesday and had a great trip. Planer boards and dipsey's trolling scorpions(Not Deep Purple)30"" was the biggest, but lots of eaters 4-5 lbs'ers and only about 1000 freshwater drum (BAAA) Got a big bag of cheeks!! :) Blew out my fuel pump on thursday ouch! Large chunk of change. I may have to start charging for all the instruction I give the guys up at lac. Was going to pick up a load of new cranks for the trip but may have to use last years. You know how hard it is to walk up and down those lure racks 10-12 hours a day and not buy some. As for the fuel pump better here than 502.My pipes got a good work out pullin in fish on wednesday so I'll be ready for trip.Work tomorrow and load the truck, Tuesday at 2 is time to point it west and put the hammer to it. Mexican village on Thursday Night?Out!Fish God, (zugbug)Say Hey to the Nickster!"
521682,Guest,2002-06-23 10:06:00,0,"Zugbug, Nickster has a 5:45 soccer on Thursday in St. Cloud, we could hit the Mexican Village after the game, you're certainly welcome to come to the game, I know Nickster would enjoy that, then we could do a Lac Suel seminar and sign autographs at Mexican Village after that.Mike"

521685,zugbug,2002-06-24 15:59:00,67,"Whitetip1, I rarely turn down contributions to the zugbug fuelpump fund! I am realizing just how much I need this Vacation. See you at the camp!Take it easy and drive safe!Zugbug"
521686,whitetip1,2002-06-26 07:14:00,53,"Spike,Can you tell me what to expect when we get to the landing? Do you have to pay any fees and do they have someone watching unattended vehicles? Is there a store at the landing? If so, can you get gas and bait if needed? I've heard some rumors and thought I would ask you.Thanks,Dave"
521687,Guest,2002-06-26 16:28:00,0,"Dave, I'm Spike's fishing buddy Mike, he's away from his computer and probably won't be logging onto WC until after we get back. The landing is owned by the Lac Seul First Nation Ojibway and since we our guests at their resort and they want you to have positive experience, your vehicle couldn't be safer. Gas hasn't been available at the landing before, but last year when we were there they were grading for the new pumps and according to Eyedude (see above post) gas is now available for $2.04/gal. Mahkwa might have bait available, but I'm not sure, we always bring plenty of night crawlers (a flat or more) and leeches (a pound or more) depending how many people are along. I'm not sure about the store, if they have one, it's new since last year (Eyedude would know). There is no landing fee, but we usually tip the caretaker when we're leaving to ensure that we don't encounter any problems in the future either. See You Sunday!Mike"
521688,whitetip1,2002-06-27 06:11:00,53,"Mike,Thanks for the info.Seeya Sunday.Dave"
521689,Guest,2002-06-27 10:55:00,0,Archie is his name guarding vehicles is his game. Never had a problem been going for many years.
521690,Guest,2002-06-28 12:44:00,0,"Yes, they have a small store there called Archie's Landing. We have also been going there for many years with no problems. James, how long have you been going there?"
521671,zugbug,2002-06-20 20:37:00,67,Does anyone have any recent reports on either the roads or fishing? Leaving on the 29th and getting antsy.
521672,guide7,2002-06-21 04:27:00,70,"Talk about ants. :P We're leaving the 26th and it's been real bad for a couple weeks already. I'll be calling Pierre at Mahkwa, hopefully later today, and I'll post what he tells me about roads and fish, of course.7 out"
521673,Noel,2002-06-21 06:19:00,115,"Guide, How do you get to Mahkwa? I have a Canadian map that shows where Mahkwa is located on the lake but there is not any road showing that goes there. Is there a road as I thought it was a drive-to fishing camp??thanks."
521675,Guest,2002-06-21 10:52:00,0,"Fished May 30th - June 6th. Road was about the same.there is gravel over the top of the black-top starting just outside of Hudson.Alot of wash boards.Hope for rain just prior to getting there,seems to help the road (little softer). Water is high. Getting to be more people every year(going for 12) fishing was the same good,just have to share spots with more people.Have a great time. James."
521674,guide7,2002-06-21 16:10:00,70,"Noel: There is a road after you go(twist) thru Hudson. About 2-3 miles then take a right. Make sure not to turn into the McKenzie Logging camp(the first right at the ""Y""). Mahkwa turn is the next right. Go 2-3 miles to the left turn onto gravel.I think there is a ""Mahkwa"" sign on that corner. It's about 20 miles on the ""nice"" gravel road. The road was constructed for logging so they rule when you meet their trucks hauling. If you catch the right day they do grade the road often, however, the trucks beat it up a lot between grading jobs.I tried calling the lodge today and their phones are out. Their message says they are checking hourly for call messages (I left one) but they haven't called me back yet.ants in the pants are really gettin out of control.:P 7 out"
521676,Guest,2002-06-21 16:26:00,0,"Fished 06/08 - 06/14. No problems at border either way. Had bad weather five of seven days fishing (rain, wind, chilly 50's) with the worst being 60mph winds and flood conditions in the area. Wind blew right in Mahkwa bay and broke one of the docks in half and a lot of boats blown from the dock but no serious damage. 502 had minor delays for road crews coming up, still needs a lot of work. On the way back it was a lot worse from the floods over the road and many more road crews. Be sure to wave to the blond flaggirl, cute, great smile. We had three rookies in our group of eight, they said it was the best fishing in their lives. For the veterans fishing was about half as good as it usually was. Fifty - seventy five fish a day with a mix of big ones. We covered Vaughn, main lake, and Bray. Our usual hot spots weren't to hot this trip. Bray had the bigger fish, but action was slow, lots of small northern with big ones mixed in also caught most of our bass there all were nice size. Most consistent fishing was around the island. Vaughn was inconsistent, caught probably 75 one day then 25 the next only two days I fished there. Other two boats in our group had better luck there. Most consistent fishing was in main lake. Spent a lot of time on the point off Eagle Island, that was our lunch bar with most fish being eater size, the larger fish coming closer to shore by the drop-off. Largest walleyes: 2-29"", 12-28"" maybe another 20 fish over the slot for our group. Largest nothern: only fished for them once and got a 17.4 pounder, 2 other fish over the slot and maybe ten more in the slot, with a lot of unders. Smallmouth we got, probably ten, came when 'eye fishing but went from 2# - 5#! Used mostly live bait, leeches and crawlers no minnows, spinner rigs work as well as lindy rigs. We caught fish from 2ft to 40ft depending on the weather. It should pick-up by the time you get there, no doubt. Also, buy your gas for your personnel boats at the landing $2.04 a gallon, and can be charged to your cabin. One week conservation license is free at the resort, all others buy elsewhere. I think I covered everything, good luck."
521679,guide7,2002-06-21 17:21:00,70,"Just talked to Pierre at Mahkwa and all is clear to get to the landing. The gravel road is as expected. Hit the right day and it will be graded, hit the wrong day and it will be wash-boarded.They are raising the docks again with the water a little higher than last June. He said fishing the past few days has been ""reel"" good.cabin 7 will be very busy with our crew the 26th-30th.good luck 7 out"
521680,Guest,2002-06-21 20:38:00,0,"Zugbug, the Nickster & I are going on a Middle Spunk outing tomorrow just to scratch the itch (and to try out the new St. Croix's). Tuesday the trailer gets a new set of Goodyear Marathon's (no sense taking chances with marginal tires). After our less than stellar performance at Erie, I'm more poised then ever for some REAL fishing! It sounds like we should buy some bait at Rainy Lakes Sports in Fort Francis.Over & OutMike"
521677,Guest,2002-06-21 20:48:00,0,"Dude!, when you refer to 50-75 fish per day I'm assuming you mean per person per day, correct?MAK"
