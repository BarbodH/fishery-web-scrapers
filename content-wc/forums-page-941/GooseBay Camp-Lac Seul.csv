522059,stumcfar,2002-07-01 10:40:00,451,I am heading up to Goosebay Camp on the 5th for a few days of fishing.This is my first trip to Lac Seul. Can some of you let me know what to expect and give any fishing locations or secrets. Any advice would be aprreciated. Thanks in advance.
522060,Guest,2002-07-02 15:47:00,0,"Just got back from Goosebay Camp. Spent 8 days fishing and 4 of us caught 900 fish, give or take. The biggest walleye was 6.5 lbs and northern was 12.5. It was a great time. Weather was not to bad. We really like the camp. We have been going there for 3 years now and talked to some folks that have been there for 13. We did most of our fishing close to camp. My folks went along and can not deal with the long boat rides. We fished up the river. The fish may have moved out of there by the time you get there. Your best bet is to get a map from Aundrea and ask her where the hot spots are. If you have never been on the lake before be careful. There are big rocks that pop out of nowhere and can tear your boat apart. Good luck. I wish I was heading back up already."

AND CAME AWAY WITH A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE.I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU STOP ENROUTE TO GET A GOOD MAP OF THAT PART OF LAC SEUL,THEY DID NOT HAVE A GOOD ONE WHEN I WAS THERE.THE SPORT SHOP IN EAR FALLS HAS WHAT YOU NEED. BETTER YET, THE CANADIAN TOPOGRAPHIC SERIES 1:50000 scale IS THE MOST DETAILED AND ACCURATE MAP AVAILABLE. THE DRAWBACK WITH THIS MAP IS THAT IT IS QUITE LARGE AND HAS TO BE FOLDED SEVERAL TIMES.EVEN IN LATE AUGUST I DID NOT HAVE TO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES TO CATCH FISH. YOU CAN GET EATERS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ISLAND THAT SITS IN FRONT OF THE CAMP.TROLLING WITH SPINNERS AND CRAWLERS WORKS FINE.THE 10-15 FT. DEPTHS AROUND ISLANDS ,EVEN VERY SMALL ISLANDS, HAVE EYES AND PIKE .I GOT AN 28 INCH EYE OFF A SMALL ISLAND ONLY 10 MINUTES FROM CAMP.GOLD COLORED CRANK BAITS LIKE REEF RUNNERS CAN BE OUTSTANDING.KEEP MOVING AND TRYING SPOTS,YOU WILL FIND THAT THE BEST FISHING SPOTS ON THIS GREAT LAKE ARE THE ONES YOU FIND YOURSELF."
