I came up from Okla. in '99 and caught some, but could have been better. What are some general tactics used this time of year. I lived in MN as a young kid, but moved to Tulsa 20+ years ago, the memory does not stay too sharp. My group is all from OK or TX, so any tips would be great! Thank you very much."
