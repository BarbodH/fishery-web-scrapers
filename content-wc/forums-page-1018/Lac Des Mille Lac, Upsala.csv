512898,Wenty,2001-05-31 09:42:00,15,"Don,LDML's been pretty decent thus far. I fished it on the Opener and last weekend. I'll be heading up for a week this Sunday, and then back up on the 13th. It hasn't been difficult to find fish, and when you do the bites been pretty decent. Lot's of fish in the 16"" to 18"" area. Haven't caught a lot of big walleyes as of yet. I suspect that they have been recovering from the spawn as the ice went out fairly late this year. Should get better and your trip should go well. Have caught a few walleyes in the 22""-25"" area. Pretty typical stuff, 4'to 17' of water. Wind conditions have been kind of screwey with it blowing out of all directions on one given day. But even with last week's low pressure system, people caught fish at a regular pace. A 1/16 ounce jig and minnow have worked well. Crawlers on a Lindy rig were producing as well. Water temp has been running around 56 degrees F, although I think it cooled off from Opening weekend.Nicest walleyes were taken around Owl Island on the north end.Hope this helps."
