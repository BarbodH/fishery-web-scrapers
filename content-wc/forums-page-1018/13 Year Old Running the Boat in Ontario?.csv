512816,Guest,2001-05-30 10:53:00,0,"The rules are as followsThank you for being here today.As the Minister responsible for the Canadian Coast Guard, I want to thank the organizers of theToronto International Boat Show for allowing us the use of this venue.This is particularly timely given the presentation last night of the first Canadian Safe Boating Awards(CASBAs), created to promote safe and responsible recreational boating.Before providing you with an overview of the new boating safety regulations, I want to thank thethousands of Canadians and the many recreational boating associations who took part in the broadconsultative process that preceded their development.These individuals are the real architects of these reasonable and balanced measures which are to bepublished in the Canada Gazette on February 3, 1999.A Call to ActionWe all know that Canadians love the water. Some 8 million Canadians are boaters, and Canadiansown an estimated 2.6 million recreational boats.But as the popularity of boating as a recreational activity has grown, so too has concern aboutboating safety. It appears that Canadians' right to safe waters and to the pleasures of recreationalboating are increasingly at risk. According to a recently commissioned survey, more than nine out of ten boaters have majorconcerns about the careless and reckless use of recreational boats.There are a number of factors contributing to this growing concern.One factor is that our waterways are increasingly busy. Another is the proliferation of personalwatercraft, a sport that appears to have as many detractors as it does enthusiasts. The statistics are grim: on an annual basis over the past few years, we have averaged some 6,000boating incidents involving 200 fatalities. As coroner report after coroner report makes clear, thesetragedies are largely preventable.The essence of the challenge is this: at present, anyone of any age can operate any type of boatwithout any training or previous experience. Moreover, almost two-thirds of Canadian power boat users have not had any formal training inboating safety or operation.With more and more boaters, and new and more powerful boats sharing our waterways, this is arecipe for disaster.The enhanced regulatory framework I am announcing today will affect three broad areas: operatorcompetency, age and horsepower restrictions and minimum safety equipment and precautions. Letme give you an overview of what they will mean.Recreational Boat Operator CompetencyWe believe, and an overwhelming majority of Canadians agree, that people who operate powerboats should have the training they need to operate them safely! That is precisely what we hope to achieve. In time, all operators of motorized pleasure boats usedfor recreational purposes - with some notable exceptions - will be required to have an operator'scard from an accredited course provider.This is commonly becoming known as a PCO card - Pleasure craft operators' card.Proof of competency can be obtained in one of three ways. The first is by successfully completing awritten test administered by an accredited course provider. Experienced boaters are unlikely torequire formal courses to pass this test. This one-time only requirement is good for life. The secondis by providing proof of having successfully completed a boating safety course prior to April 1,1999. The third, for those who do not have an operator's card but who wish to rent a boat, involvescompletion of a dockside boating safety check-list.Coast Guard has made it a point to ensure the regulations allow course providers to deliver coursesby correspondence or other reasonable distance-learning methods.To ensure these new requirements do not pose an undue burden, they will be gradually phased inover 10 years. By September 15, 1999, operators under 16 years of age (as of this coming April 1)will require ""proof of operator competency."" By September 15, 2002, this requirement will beextended to operators of power boats less than 4 metres in length, as well as all personal watercraftsuch as jet skis, sea-doos and waverunners. By September 15, 2009, proof of competency will berequired for all power boat operators.There are a number of limits to the application of the requirement for proof of operator competency.For example, these regulations apply only to powered pleasure craft used for recreational purposes.They are not intended to apply to individuals for whom the use of a boat is a requirement of theirdaily lives. This includes subsistence fishermen and residents of remote coastal communities who useboats as their primary mode of transportation.Coast Guard has deferred applying these regulations in the Northwest Territories until the respectivegovernments of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut have established their post-Divisionresponsibilities. To minimize potential impacts on tourism, visitors who bring their own boats into Canada will onlybe obliged to meet the operator competency requirement after 45 consecutive days. As all 16 states that border Canada, or that can be accessed via Canadian waters have in place orare planning mandatory boating safety education or licensing programs, these measures will notcompromise safety.As noted, individuals who do not possess proof of operator competency, but who wish to rentboats for short periods, will be required to complete a dockside safety check-list with the rentalagent. This suggestion, proposed by boat rental operators and outfitters during consultations, makeseminent good sense. It is clearly in their own interests to ensure that those who rent their vesselsknow how to operate them safely. I also want to note that a planned exemption from the operator competency requirements forpersons aged 55 at the time of entry into force of the regulations has been dropped.This exemption was deemed incompatible with the ""safety first"" principle on which these measuresare premised.A final word concerns the difficulties which residents of remote or rural areas may experience inobtaining training and testing.First, the gradual phase-in of the requirements should facilitate this process considerably. Next,Coast Guard has made it a point to ensure the regulations allow accredited course providers todeliver courses via correspondence or through any other reasonable distance-learning methods.Finally, the regulations also allow accredited course providers to nominate proctors to administertests in remote areas. Still, Coast Guard will carefully monitor the issue of access to training andcertification in remote areas.Will operator competency make a difference? Will it save lives and reduce accidents? If the U.S.experience with operator competence provides any guidance, the answer would have to be anemphatic, YES!In Connecticut, for example, registered boaters are required to obtain a Safe Boating Certificate,reports show that boaters who lack boating safety training have 5 times more accidents than theirtrained counterparts. Reports also show that while only 10% of personal watercraft operators inConnecticut had not had training in boating safety, they accounted for more than half of all personalwatercraft accidents.Is it any wonder, then, why mandatory boating safety education or licensing programs are becomingthe norm south of the border?Some people might argue that these requirements are onerous, that training and compliance shouldbe voluntary, and that the Coast Guard should focus on public education.My response is that public education has been, and remains, the centerpiece of our efforts. Theestablishment of 6 regional Offices of Boating Safety over the past 3 years, the creation of our1-800 Boating Safety Info-Line, the distribution of over a quarter-million copies of the Safe BoatingGuide last year alone, are evidence of this.But the reality is that over the past five years, Canada has witnessed close to 1,000 boating fatalities,and almost 30,000 boating accidents. The many thousands of people whose lives have beenaffected by boating tragedies will tell you that it is time to move beyond voluntary compliance.Age & Horsepower RestrictionsThe second part of the regulations concern Age & Horsepower Restrictions.There is also good reason to believe that the regulations affecting age and horsepower restrictions asthey apply to recreational boating will be well received. As with operator competency requirements,their application in the NWT and Nunavut has been deferred for now.Keeping in mind that as of September 15, 1999, operators under 16 years of age (as of April 1,1999) will require ""proof of operator competency"" regardless of the type of motorized boats theyare operating, let's look at some of these safety measures.As of April 1, 1999, children under 12 years of age will not be permitted to operate boats above 10hp unless accompanied by a person 16 years of age or older. Next, as of April 1, 1999, youth at least 12 years of age, but under 16 years of age, will not bepermitted to operate boats above 40 hp unless accompanied by an individual 16 years of age orolder.Finally, as of April 1, 1999, the start of the new boating season, only persons 16 and older will bepermitted to operate personal watercraft such as sea-doos, jet skis and waverunners. Our research shows that these measures enjoy strong support in all regions of the country. Ifanything, there is an appetite for even tougher measures!Minimum Safety Requirements - Small Vessel Regulations The final area of regulation involves bringing the 20 year-old Small Vessel Regulations into line withtoday's boating environment. New minimum safety equipment requirements are being introduced.These requirements are flexible and will allow boaters to select equipment that better correspondswith their boat type and boating activity.For example, small power driven vessels will have the option to carry a watertight flashlight or flares.Small boat operators will be able to choose between equipping themselves with an anchor, or a setof oars, in the event their vessels become disabled. For competitive events, where boaters are in thepresence of a safety boat carrying the requisite equipment, their on-board equipment requirementswill be reduced. One of the most important provisions of the new regulations is that there be a sufficient number ofpersonal flotation devices (PFDs) that fit for each person on board a boat. In addition, flotationcushions will no longer count as personal flotation devices. New safety precautions for fueling andtowing situations will also be introduced.Finally, the regulations contain new tools that will make it easier for enforcement officials to do theirjobs. For example, a new ""careless operation"" offence is defined and designated as a ticketableoffence. This will provide enforcement officials with a new means of dealing with irresponsibleboaters. The regulations also provide peace officers with other improved provisions for issuing finesto boaters violating safety and other boating regulations. These should be especially well-received bythe enforcement community.ConclusionI believe these measures will make a difference and improve boater safety. It is a reasonable andbalanced package, whose easy to live-by regulations will be phased-in gradually to allow thoseaffected by them to adjust to their requirements.They result from consultations with the boating community and target the priority areas which theyidentified.They also respond to the requests of enforcement authorities for modern tools with which to enforcesafe boating rules, and to the long-standing demands of coroners for action in this area.These measures are an important and positive step forward, but we have some distance yet to travelbefore we reach our final destination: to make sure that everyone who goes out on a boat comesback safe.Thank you. - 30 -"
512817,RIVERRUNNER,2001-05-31 23:03:00,100,"MR.Minister d'ont justify your money grabbing B.S. boating saftey,give you guys enough time and we'll have a licence plate riveted to our boats, which of course will be invalid without a yearly sticker.MONEY, MONEY ,MONEY AND MORE MONEY. All I know is my father and my friend'S fathers never had a problem teaching smart ,safe,courteous boating.How many of the 200 fatalities were ALCOHOL RELATED.All the saftey training ,flares ,fire extinguiser's etc. won't do a bit of good if your drunk.Insurance companies and government's in bed AGAIN, the only one getting screwed is the common sense boaters."
512818,Guest,2001-06-01 07:54:00,0,My thoughts exactly. Natives do not need the course either. I am also sick and tired of the organizations selling the lessons and licenses at the mall and boat shows. No one pays if you fail. You keep trying untill you pass...then you pay the fee and you are now a safe boater. What a joke. The common sense in this whole thing is missing. Safe boating for most of us is just that.........common sense.
