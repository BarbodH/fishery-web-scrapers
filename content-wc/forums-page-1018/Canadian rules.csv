512846,Guest,2001-05-29 17:08:00,0,Commercial Bedding is the way to go. Dirt is against the law.
512847,Guest,2001-05-29 17:38:00,0,"EYEFSH,Don't use dirt. Also, not all comercial beddings are legal either. I use Buss Bedding. I tell the border officers that they are in BUSS Bedding and I have not had any problems yet.Enjoy the trip.Fritz"

512849,Pooch,2001-05-30 01:59:00,4619,"Use ""Buss"" bedding only. Don't use ""Magic"" bedding, soil or anything organic. Make sure the Buss bedding is fresh otherwise it starts to look like soil. Worms keep better in Buss bedding anyway. I have two year old nightcrawlers in my basement fridge to prove it. The best food for them is the ""Magic"" worm food.Pooch in central Illinois"
512850,Guest,2001-05-30 03:40:00,0,Do not take them in dirt. They will make you go back to the states and dump the dirt. Put them in worm bedding. As of last year that was still OK.
