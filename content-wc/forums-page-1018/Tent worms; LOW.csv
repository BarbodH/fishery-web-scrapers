512868,Guest,2001-05-30 08:22:00,0,We are planning a trip to Lake of the Woods mid-June and inquiring on the current or expected status of black flies and tent worms. Northern WI is currently buried in worms and wondering about LOW area. Any suggestions to keep out of camp?
512869,wiggle,2001-05-30 09:47:00,400,Just returned from LOTW on monday evening. The flies were bad and the tent catepillars were starting to get bad again.
