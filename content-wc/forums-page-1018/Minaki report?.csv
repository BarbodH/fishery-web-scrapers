512854,darcyfish,2001-05-29 19:16:00,15,Well the weather has been up and down as of late get about 2-3 days of sun and warm weather then a couple of cool days with rain. Hopefully this will not be the trend for the whole summer.

A whole new set of rock problems as last years islands are this years skeg hazards. Weather was generally misearble with rain all days except one, that day it snowed. Despite the weather, fishing was quite good with lots of 16-19"" eyes and a couple of 36"" northerns. Had a huge perch bite gong while drifting for eyes all week. I went to a lighter jig in deep water and got 40 bonus 12"" perch besides the eyes. The perch fillets are only slightly smaller than the 17"" walleye fillets I brought home. Good luck!"

Wild edge, whisky, eagles nest? Minnows, leaches? Sorry for the million questions. Getting anxious. Little more than two weeks and I cant wait!!! God I miss it up there."
