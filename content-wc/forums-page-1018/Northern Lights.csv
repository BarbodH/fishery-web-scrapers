512807,Hammerhead Herb,2001-05-28 17:32:00,259,I recollect that the best year ever for Northern Lights was in '91; we were on the 51st parallel. I also understand that the intensity of the Aurora is on a 10 to 11 year cycle. How have the northern lights been this year up north?

512809,BD,2001-05-29 12:27:00,739,91 was great! We were at LOW in June. The lights covered the sky from horizon to horizon. This year should be a banner year. A couple of months ago the lights were seen as far south as Salt Lake City when a coronal mass ejection hit the earth almost dead center. That blast killed one comm. sat.
