Fishing has been fairly good, although a bit spotty.The water is incredibly high, making little echo lake into a wicked walleye lake. a guy in my boat caught a 28 1/2"" just the other day.River eye"
512835,chrism,2001-05-29 14:03:00,429,"Yes, I was there opening weekend and the long weekend for 4 days each. Fishing was spotty but good, we were targetting big pike...41"" and 40"" were the winners! It was really slow during the ""winter"" like storm last week!Had bear problems on trip #2...pepper spray works real good!May be back the last week of June.e-mail me.Later cm"

512837,River_eye,2001-05-30 12:42:00,1486,"hmmm well, for walleyes, I've been most successfull in depths less than 12'. I've done the best, constantly moving, throwing light jigs into the shallows, as well as vertical jigging. Now is the season to be versatile. If what you are doing isn't working, don't keep doing it, try somthing different. Try really slow trolling with bottom bouncers and spinner rigs. Another technique that has been fairly successful lately is trolling/casting both shallow and deep diving crank baits, depending on the depth and time of day. Good luck and maybe I'll see you around.River eye"
