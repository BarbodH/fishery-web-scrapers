512819,Guest,2001-05-29 04:27:00,0,Finalizing plans for a trip for next summer. Looks like these are the two finalists. Anyone been to either of them? Any info would be appreciated.KCR is on the Winnipeg River NW of Kenora and South Shore Lodge is on Eagle Lake.
512820,Moose_MI,2001-05-29 05:03:00,31,"Hi, I took a group of 15 to KCR Camp 3 yrs ago the week of July 4th. We all did the American Plan and got guides 3-4 days of our 6 day stay. The food was good. The guides were usually hung over. The cabin was comfortable. The boats were in good working order. There really is nothing to do except fish....no TV, pool table, horseshoes...etc. This wasn't a big deal..but about that 5th day of not catchin Walleye I was ready for a break from fishin. The fishing...was ok. We were there for 6 days...it was 90+ degrees every day, no rain all week, and the May flies had hatched the week before we got there. Even with the guides we couldn't buy Walleye...it was terrible...we fished for them 6 hours a day...nothin. However, we could always go out and catch Northern any time we wanted. And we caught some smallmouth also. For the week we caught 3 40"" northern. In summary...I know there are Walleye there they just wernt biting the week we were there...s#it happens. I would probably not advise you get a guide....Like I say ... they were in rough shape and frankly couldn't cook very good for lunch. There is a absolute ton of water to fish (it goes forever). You can get lost in a heart beat...but they give good maps and ask RODNEY at the camp for fishin advice. We never returned to KCR...just to pissed about the Walleye fishin. This year were going to Manotak Lodge...http://www.duenorth.net/manotak/Anyway...thats my report....be glad to talk some more bout it if you like.... [email protected] ...Good Luck!"
512821,River_eye,2001-05-29 10:59:00,1486,"Where exacly are you coming from? I work at a lodge called Eagle Nest Lodge. It's on the Winnipeg river downstream from KCR camp in Manitoba. I would strongly suggest coming here instead of KCR. As a guide myself, I realize how difficult it can be to find good help up here, but the last couple of years, things have been really good for guiding staff here. Our camp will be much nicer than KCR, with much nicer equipment.We have a pool table, fitness/weight room, home theatre with surround sound, as well as satelite tv's in every cabin. We use 18' Alumarine fishing boats with carpet and livewells and 40 hp four stroke mercs with electric start.www.eaglenest.mb.caRiver eye"
512822,Guest,2001-05-30 12:10:00,0,"Ron,I just got back from KCR Camp on the 25th of May. There are in fact 2 KCR Camps, one is on the main land (Roger Castle) and the other is 7 miles downstream on an island (Richard & Gloria Castle) I have been to the island camp 3 times and the main land twice. I quite going to the main land camp. Lodging was poor, boats and motors are the other camps retreads.But I love the island camp. Fishing area is absolutely unlimited! Weather was poor last week but we hammered the eyes anyway, also got into schools of jumbo perch. Also got a couple of 36"" northerns, some smallies, but a little early for crappies.We did the plan (which ever it is) where we have their meals with their boats, but w/o the guides. The guides followed us around all week as our group out fished every one else in camp including the guides. Guides are native and most do not speak English, so if you are looking for conversation in your fishing guide, this isn't the place.I have never never been to the other resort mentioned on this thread, and I really don't need to. I am up there for a week to fish (gained 6 pounds in 5 days from shoree lunches)not work out or shoot pool. I know Tetu Lake Lodge is on the same body of water and we fish next to each other at times. But their plan is about $1,700.00 for the week, where I did KCR for about $500.00.The difference to me was pork chops for the evening meal versus ribeye steaks. For the same waters, the price descrepency was a no brainer, I go to KCR.If you are looking at KCR for the summer of 2002, better call today because Richard told me they are pretty much filled up for next summer barring cancellations. Tons of repeat business for KCR, get on the list in advance if you want to go.I would be happy to mark up a map for you as far as eyes and northerns are concerned. Good luck and enjoy!"
512823,River_eye,2001-05-30 12:33:00,1486,"I guess it depends on the amount of money you want to spend. The fishing is just as good no matter whether you pay $500 or $1500. What makes the difference is the service.The higher the guides are paid, the better they are usually. We make good money, and in turn, all of our guides are very personable and offer top notch service. A lot of our guides will even take you out after supper if the fishing wasn't very good during the day, even though they aren't paid to do so. One of our guides also works as a cook in the winter, so he is always whipping up new stuff, cajun fish, beer batter, fish chowder, all delicious stuff.River eye"
512824,Guest,2001-05-31 04:32:00,0,"Thanks everyone for the replys. I appreciate you taking the time to help me out. I hope to make a decision soon.Moose--I will be emailing you again hopefully this weekend. I assume you are getting the gear together for your trip.river_eye--I am coming from Wisconsin. I understand what you are saying about the guides. My dad and I are looking for a little lower cost trip and won't be using guides. If we were, a quality place with quality guides would be very important. As it is, we plan to draw upon some of our own fishing experience, hopefully get more info from the helpful people here on the net, and select a lodge where the owner's are willing to at least point you off in the right direction. I'll keep your lodge in mind for future years as I've always liked/respected many of the posts I have seen from you in the time I've been coming here.Slugchucker--I know a guy who is up to KCR this week and a group that is going up next week. I didn't realize there were two camps. I'll have to find out which they go to. They all have been going for a few years and is how I first heard about KCR. I do remember the wife of one of the guys talking about boating in so I assume it must be the island camp. I know they got into the crappies last year and my dad does like crappie fishing. I just got back from our annual trip to northern WI crappie fishing. I would like to spend a day or two trying to get a big pike or muskie. I know KCR isn't a muskie area, but if the other fishing is good enough I could do without going after the big ones."
512825,Guest,2001-05-31 06:21:00,0,"Ron O.,I too am a musky hunter, and have thought about going elsewhere in Canada searching for them. They do exist on the Winnipeg River system from KCR Camp but they are rare and I don't even know how one would begin to find one out there. It is a shame because on the other side (Lake of the Woods side) of the White Dog Falls Dam, muskies are plentiful. The dam keeps them there apparently.There are quite a few big northerns around KCR, this year a pair of 36's but last time a 42 1/2. Very few of our big ones are caught casting for them, I did get a good one on a top water jackpot a few years back but they usaully come fishing for eyes with a jig and minnow combo. You can cast the weedy bays and catch 26-28's til your arms fall off, but it seems the big ones come from deeper water.As I was saying before, I wouldn't rate KCR Camp great as far as hospitality and the other amenities mentioned, but our group sticks to ourselves and are up there to fish. If that is the way you want to go, I haven't found anything cheaper with that quality of fishing anywhere. Enjoy."
512826,Moose_MI,2001-05-31 07:54:00,31,"Hi Ron, For the record I completely agree with Slugchuckers sentiments. The ""Base Camp"" is a parking lot that happens to have some run-down cabins around it. If KCR is your choice, I strongly suggest island living. Although, several of the smaller cabins on the island looked pretty well weathered also. With our large group we stayed in the newer larger cabins and they were nice. However, even in the newer cabins w/ bathrooms we were kindly asked to make use of the Outhouse for any non-fluid bodily discharge...if ya get my drift. The island is a big rock...which makes for digging septic systems a bit impossible, so we were happy to oblidge. As for the perch...we were told they were ""wormy"" in July. The native guides refused to fish for them and would not clean one that was accidently caught...but I already gave you my gude review, so no need to say more. Again, I agree entirely with Slugchucker. We simply had a bad week for Walleye and guides that left a bit to be desired. Our budget sounds a whole lot like yours, and therefore we again considered KCR. We just happened to find Manotak on the Internet, it appears to be a bit more polished than KCR, it has a few more ammenities, and the money is the same.... After all, the important thing is that none of this will effect the price of beer. And outside of gettin away from my lovely bride and 2 small children...this is what I enjoy the most about goin to Ontario. :) Moose"
512827,Guest,2001-06-01 06:28:00,0,Give Fin and Feather a Call if you want to stay on Eagle Lake. I have fished Eagle Lake for ten years and stayed at Fin and Feather and its great. The quides are the best and you can arrange one day fly in's to Vaughn Lake which is a walleye magnet. Ron and Dee Clark run the place and they do great. Check them out on the web at finandfeather.com
