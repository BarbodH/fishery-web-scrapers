512840,Hunter,2001-05-29 18:29:00,346,"Hey Riverrunner, what species you plan on going after? I fish this lake at least once a year. Its not as good as it was 20 years ago but still plenty of fish, especially gills, and some very good sized ones. I was there last year and got a 39 inch muskie that won big fish for the lodge for the week. The guys that saw it before I released it, said there was no question they would mount this fish. I just laughed and told them no taxidermist would touch this fish where I come from, legal size is 42. They all thought I was crazy. We live in the best fishing area anywhere, so dont expect anything as good as what you have here. For all your fishing on Rice it wouldnt be a bad idea to stay around the Otanabee river or the underwater tracks, this is the most consistant area."

I believe rice is pretty much privately owned so dont plan on camping just anywhere. The bass is pretty good, but the size is smaller than the average St. clair smallie. But then again I took my best ever from thar lake 6#11ounce large mouth. I have never been able to get on eyes there, just incidentals casting for bass. From what I understand it is a weedline fishery for eyes, I just dont use the right lures for eyes, I generally am fishing bass and muskie there. Crappie can be hard to locate, but when you do you can generally stay on them for a couple days. If you just want a good feed, its hard to beat those gills, they are everywhere! And they arent the dinks you find here. Best methods for these is to find an island in deep water, anchor and cast slip bobbers with 6-8' underneath the bobber, up against shore. Just let them drift, its usually not too far. When you plan on heading up there? Summer months it is crazy there, I mean worse than here! Alot of people from the states and toronto. Ill remember a few more things and will get back to you."
