Plan to head up there Friday the 18th. Is all of the ice gone? I would certainly think so.... Looks like a wet spring so far. How are the water levels? What are the slot limits this year on walleye? We are looking to do some C&R Pike fishing as well. Any recommendations on lakes? Oh, and lastly, how are those dreaded black flies this year? Hopefully we will be ahead of them. Thanks in advance."

Plan on fishing fishing for everything - eyes, pike, brookies, lakers, whatever. Chadster let me know how you did. My e-mail is [email protected]Thanks!!"
