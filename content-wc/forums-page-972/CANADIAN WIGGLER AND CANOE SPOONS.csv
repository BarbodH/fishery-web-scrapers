Their shop is about 5 miles from my house. I don't believe they sell direct but it wouldn't hurt in asking. They could at least give you the name of some one in your area who could.Tim""Osprey"""
518691,Hank,2002-03-30 21:54:00,9,"Cabelas sells canadian wigglers...Few years back,on a trip to northern Quebec, seems like all the fish wanted to hit were those canadian wigglers either single bodied or jointed, but they had to be silver...Within a couple days we lost all we had and no store around to replace them..Lesson learned and now we never go fishing without taking a lure retriever...Just getting a couple lures back pays for the device and it really feels good to get a lure back that is working that week and you only have one..."
