518339,Walli,2002-03-25 19:15:00,63,"You should check your imformation before you make a comment Bud,Walli"
518341,Big Tim,2002-03-26 07:11:00,63,"I second Lac Seul Lodge. Great place, safe if you stay in the bays on rough days Access to Fantastic walleye & Northern fishing. My 9 year old is going as soon as I can get him to sit still for more than 20 min.!"
518342,Guest,2002-03-26 23:29:00,0,"Hey Bud, do you know what your talking about? I stayed at Turple cabin 2 years ago for the Canadian Bass Tournament and it was the best vacation I've had in years. I would prefer the privacy and not have to pay an arm and a leg to enjoy the lake and go fishing. The prices at some of these fishing lodges are out to lunch. The manager there (Gord) was a really cool guy who took us out there, got us all fixed up and came to check on us to see if we needed anything. I would recommend this lodging to anyone and will certainly be back."
518343,Guest,2002-03-27 06:43:00,0,"I guess the question is, is Walli a licensed tourist camp? I apologize for ignorance on the fishing reg. I just looked at 02 fishing regs. and I see non residents are allowed to keep 1 fish a day.PS Rainy is a good bass lake but"
518344,Guest,2002-03-29 10:30:00,0,BUD: What are you talking about. I live in Fort Frances and fish Rainy Lake and Pipestone. Their limit is 2 walleye a day and 4 if you are there longer then 1 day.For americans. 4 and day for canadians. You do not need a reciept to prove that you stayed in canada anymore. He is in his total right to rent his cabin out.
518345,Walli,2002-03-29 19:08:00,63,"Not catching any fish in your lake Bud?Border waters is division22&32 and includes Quetico and lake of the woods-2 walleye or saugers per day with a possesion limit of 4.-4 northerns,1 musky, 4 bass.As far as renting my cabin ,maybe if I expand on the property I will have to look at more licenses but for now don't need the bureaucracy.Can we get back to the original question now?Walli"

518331,bphunger,2002-03-19 07:28:00,28,It might be a boat-in camp but it is a very short boat ride. Look at www.whitefishbaycamp.com
518333,Guest,2002-03-19 07:40:00,0,Have you ever considered the western end of Lac Seul? There are several drive-in resorts that offer American and light housekeeping options. You can take your own rig or rent one.
518335,Walli,2002-03-19 09:34:00,63,"Hi Steve-I have a 3 bedroom cottage on Rainy Lake that I rent out on Rainy Lake-it is on an island but only about 5 min from launch- [email protected] for pics and info-it also has power,appliances,dock,shower and 5 acres for kids to explore"
518334,lobo1,2002-03-19 13:06:00,734,Thanks guys
518336,Guest,2002-03-20 06:35:00,0,I might stay away from Rainy lake there used be a law that you had to stay at a licensed resort on the lake if you didn't you could not keep any fish. Also I hear the Canadian Gov. is going to crack down on BOOTLEG camp like Walli is trying to rent.
518337,Guest,2002-03-20 08:05:00,0,Try Lac Seul Lodge....You can drive in and the fishing in the bay is good for kids. Launch your boat and go a few miles and be in walleye heaven.
518338,Guest,2002-03-25 08:23:00,0,Bob - Don't you think the age of the kids depends on how much fun they will have? How old were the kids you brought there or are you speculating?
