518564,Guest,2002-03-25 07:24:00,0,"All the discussion about deep water walleyes has me thinking about the other extreme...shallow water walleyes. Typically, I find the active walleyes where we fish in mid-June to be in the 16-20, even 24 foot range. I have heard of and seen many tips regarding shallow water 'eyes in 4-8 feet of water, but I rarely find them there myself. Truth is I rarely look for them there...maybe I should.First question is this...how much time do walleyes spend in water less than 10-12 feet deep? And second, what particular technique(s) work best when the fish are ""shallow"" like this? And what about the negative influence of sun / partial sunlight in the shallow water? If the sun is out, are the walleyes ever shallow during the day?Any insights you can provide are appreciated. Thanks."
518565,Guest,2002-03-25 11:36:00,0,"The best advice I can give is this: pretend you're bass fishing. Drag a tube jig, slow-roll a spinnerbait, swim a grub, toss a 4"" sluggo....they all work. I've caught more shallow walleye on spinnerbaits than I can believe, and most of them were hogs. Oh yes, all this while casting & retrieving...no trolling is necessary or desired.So, put the spinner-rigs and bottom bouncers away!Tom"
518566,Guest,2002-03-26 18:29:00,0,"When i go to Canada in August i usually start fishing in water 12-20 feet deep. When there is a good wind making rougher waters then the walleyes will be in the shallows. The other times the weeds are a good place to look, especially on hot days. They use the shadows to keep cool and then you just plop a jig between the weeds and they usually hit. Otherwise catching walleyes in the shallows is fairly difficult. That's just my opinion, I could be wrong.K-man"
518567,Piscatorian,2002-03-26 22:04:00,12,"Shallow water walleye fishing is my favorite. As for techniques, it depends on things like how weedy it is, but one thing you can count one is that they are almost always aggressive when they are shallow. Depending on where you are in Canada, and assuming you're not in clear water, walleyes will hold shallow for a few weeks during June. I've seen three major locations where this occurs: 1) Weedy bays. Sometimes they are just scattered over a large cabbage flat in which case trolling is the only way to go. Try rapalas or slow trolling Little Joes with very little weight, or even trolling jigs and grubs. Sometimes, within a bay, they will just concentrate in a particular area, usually toward the back of a bay or right at the entrance of a bay if it has a narrow entrance. In this case, I like to cast Red Eyes or cast a crankbait like the Rattlin Thin Fin. I have alayed walleyes in 4 -6 feet of water using this technique. 2) Mudlines where the wind has been blowing and there is a very noticable mudline. The fish may be in 2 - 8 feet of water. Try casting Rattle Traps right along the mudline, parallel if you can. 3) Shallow rock reefs in about 4 - 8 feet of water. Again, my favorite technique is using Rattle Traps. These are great ways to catch walleye. Lots more fun that jig, jig, jig, and a lot more action when you can find the right situations. In particular, if there is a frontal condition, try to find one of these patterns. The action can be fast and furious."
518568,PJM,2002-03-26 22:46:00,3516,T-Bone One technique that I have used for years for shallow water Walleyes is rip jigging. I use it a lot in the early part of the fishing season for a couple of reasons. At certian times of the year spot tail shiners will spawn and the walleyes are up in the shallows chasing them After the females spawn the males move into the shallows also. The ticket to rip jigging the shallows is having a good chop on the water so the boat doesn't spook them. I fish a lake in Minnesota called Winnibigoshish and in the spring you fish the shallows with a Fireball jig 1/8 and tip it with a minnow. If it is rough you can catch nice walleyes from 5 to 10 feet. You throw it out sometime long or sometimes short depending on what the fish want and you jig it. Believe me it works. Last month there was a article in Walleye Insider about the The Griz a guide in Minnesota that kinda perfected rip jigging and it was written by Dave Csanda. If you can find that article read it it will give you a better idea about what I am talking about
518569,Walleye Wacker,2002-03-27 07:08:00,6,"Love to fish shallow Walleye. I like to tie on the smaller jig 1/8 or 1/4 and dress it with Minnows or leechs ( I always hook leechs with mouth up). Prefer to shut motor off and use paddle or drift. Windy conditions are the best because you can use the motor and light refraction is better. Look for small shallow ares that are adjacent to deeper water and hopefully a area that has uneven bottom 3 to 7 ft deep. Fish slow and work every crevice and work area from as many directions as possible. Like to work from deeper water into shallow and if wind is right drift up the ledges to shallow. Have had many times that I know a bite will occur by watching the depth finder and seeing that subtle change from 3 to 6 ft depth. Good luck ,remember fish slow and if you hook up early fish it all over and over."
518570,stewart,2002-03-27 14:22:00,100,"As was said sometimes in the early part of the season the walleyes can be shallow, such as shallow flat or bay near a walleye spawning area. They trickle down and hang around a while before dispersing to the main lake. A lot of good presentations sugested so far. You could add a lindy rig with a phelps floater. You can just drift."
518572,Guest,2002-03-28 07:13:00,0,"I was on LOTW last year in late June and we started fishing in the 20'+ depth range, and were catching a few fish here and there. When we switched over and fished for smallmouth in the afternoon on the 2nd day we nailed the walleyes in 3' to 10' of water using jigs. We found them in classic smallmouth type structure -- rocks (bushel basket sized boulders) with weeds. On one west facing bay with a sandy bottom, we caught about 30+ fish (17"" to 22"") in about an hour to hour and a half. Nothing real big, but great fun. The boat was in 7 feet, and we were casting up next to reeds. We were able to do the same thing in 3 other areas that week, with not quite so many fish in a short period of time, but good numbers, and fish up to 24"". The camp we went to was also suggesting using large shad raps (SR-9 models) and casting up shallow onto rock reefs which reach the surface in and around deep water. We did not do that, but they claim it is a great big fish tactic. Apparently, you won't catch lots of fish, but when you do hit one, its a dandy."
518573,tracker,2002-03-28 08:26:00,91,"My favorite for shallow water walleye is the floating rapala. When the lake gets a good chop, fish the wind blown shore, find 5 ft or less water and power troll. Run about 100 ft of line about 3-4 mph, this always works. I've trolled so close to shore sometimes my rod tip would be bouncing off the alders."
518571,Guest,2002-03-28 15:57:00,0,"I agree with PJM, rip jigging is good way to handle shallow situations. Ideally, with about 10 to 12 feet of water and a medium to large sized profile minnow and stinger on a fireball can work extremely well - the slack drops the jig and allows the walleye time to hit, and the rip instantly sets the hook - just be careful with no stretch, there's no need to reset the hook, just apply pressure. THis method works especially well on mid lake flats or humps. The Griz article is good, and I'm pretty sure they featured the technique a couple of years ago in The Walleye Insider.Without a doubt though for numbers 14 to 18, on rivers, and Canadian Shield lakes, a #2 to #3 colorado blade with live bait trolled at 100 yards 50 to 75 feet back with split shot in 6 to 8 feet produces year round on wind swept shores, through eddies, over structure, and along weedbeds.Now that I think about it, in over 20 years of fishing I don't think I've caught a walleye in depths over 12 feet, and although I've had a skunk here and there, I consider myself to be up to the task on size and numbers. Go figure."
518575,Guest,2002-03-30 13:34:00,0,"I mostly only fish for walleye in the summer on Lake Winnipeg in 3 to 5 ft. of water.On my lake the walleye are in real shallow feeding on the shiners.I especially find the crowded beachs the best.The waders are pushing the bait out and the walleyes are just waiting.I find the action stops for me when I get out past 5 ft.I don't get my lunkers but i've banged hundreds of 16 to 20 inchers in a day.I not lying about this and I don't even know why I'm telling one of my secrets.I find #5 shad raps the best but small mepps will work well also.Colors,speed,short line or long line depends on the day.If you can try to run between 2 sand bars, but it will take lots of passes to figure that one out."
518574,Guest,2002-03-28 14:43:00,0,"Hey T-Bone,I do a LOT of Walleye fishing in North Eastern Manitoba and LOW and almost always fish in 12 feet or less regardless of the time of day or season (NOT!!! Winter - Ha!). I don't know much about other parts of the continent but the areas where I fish are on the Canadian Shield which produces a lot of rock outcrops and under-water points that produce tons of Walleye. Just as an example, last year a buddy and I were fishing an under-water point in Quesnel Lake in about 3.5 to 4 ft and about 15 feet from the shore between 10:30 a.m. to around 2:00 p.m. and it was just non-stop fun. Continuous action some fairly large 25""-26"" and lot's of 16"" to 19"". We caught them on everything from cranks to spinners on a very light weight tipped with a Berkeley Carolina Crawler (basically a long plastic worm). This is the norm in terms of fishing shallow - not to say you never get skunked but I've always preferred shallow - there's just more action. The advantage of going shallow is that most Walleye fishing types fish deep so you usually have a point to yourself. As the guys above point out, weeds are really great as well and again this holds throughout the season. Even right in the hot afternoon August sun.If you have a depth finder look for a point on the shore and see if it continues out into the lake. If it does you will probably find a school of Walleye near by. It's like living next to Safeway or Loblaws."
