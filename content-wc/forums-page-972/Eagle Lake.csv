518629,Guest,2002-03-26 13:50:00,0,I'm going to Eagle Lake and staying on Eagle Lake Island Lodge mid-June. Can anyone give me any good information on the lake. Is this going to be a good time to go? Any particular bays or places to fish? Hope to get into some good walleye fishing. I hope we made a wise choice on places to go. Any input is appreciated. Thanks!

You can catch lots of them in the 16-22 inch range and have fun at it. If you are fishing springtime, try around Spring Bay, Mukluk Bay, Boulder bay and around the entrance to Froghead bay. Chartreuse spinner rigs and jig/twister combos always worked well for us."
