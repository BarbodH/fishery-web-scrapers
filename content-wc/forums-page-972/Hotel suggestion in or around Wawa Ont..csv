518213,outdoor fanatic,2002-03-16 16:28:00,90,"I usually just drive straight through the night to Hawk Junction to meet the plane for my fly in trip, but I'm taking my father with me and I don't think he'd make it on Friday if we drove all Thursday night. Does anybody know any good hotels in Wawa and perhaps the phone number? Thanks in advance for any help."
518214,Guest,2002-03-16 19:42:00,0,Every year we stop at Wawa on our trips and stay at Wawa Motor Inn 1-800-561-2278. It is the first motel on the left as you go into Wawa. You can walk over to Young's General Store from there for your ice cream cone before going to bed. It is very clean and reasonably priced. I don't feel as if I have been on a Canadian fly-in trip unless I stop over at Wawa. Have Fun!!!

518217,outdoor fanatic,2002-03-17 16:01:00,90,Will do. Thanks Kyle
518218,Guest,2002-03-18 11:08:00,0,"Never tried the Wawa motor inn, but we've found the Sportsmans Lodge to be reasonable, quiet, and clean. It's about 2 miles / 3 kilometers off of Highway 17 on 101. Phone # 705-856-2272. I think they also have info and an email address on a Wawa Chamber of commerce website. By all means, avoid Kinnawabe Pines motel. We were there .... once."
518219,lenray,2002-03-18 16:48:00,467,WE have stayed at the BRISTOL it is on the left hand side going into town--stayerd there while snomobiling--the hot water and the water pressure in the showers was the best ever and the owners were nice and helpful sharing info. about trails and restaurants etc.len
518220,chuck c c,2002-03-18 19:52:00,34,"You might try the Mystic Isle Motel. We've stayed there the last 3 years and it clean and comfortable. It's about 3 miles south of Wawa on 17. A plus is a good little restaurant down the hill called the Cedar Hof. They always seem to have fresh fish on the menu along with some German specialties and other stuff. If the guys you go with cook as bad as my group, this might be your last good meal of the trip. If you're mad at someone, book them in the Kinnawabi Pines."
518221,whitey,2002-03-25 07:30:00,36,I agree with the Wawa Motor Inn. We stay in one of the cabins around the back. Great accomadations and visitinf Youngs is a must. Get some of their summer sausage....it's the best!
518222,Melonbob_ON,2002-03-25 19:41:00,61,Glad you love our little neck of the woods.....(: Head for the bristol or the Wawa Motor Inn. The log chalets are very rustic.....(:
