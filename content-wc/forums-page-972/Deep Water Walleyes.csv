In my opinion fishing is probably better in most places than it has ever been because of size limits and the efforts of anglers releasing these larger fish in good health.I enjoy the great fishing opportunities we have now and will do all I can to ensure the healthy release of fish even if it means when the walleyes go deep I have to change species. Just my opinion, for what it's worth."
518452,docIN,2002-03-28 04:56:00,120,Thanks again for all the posts and information.I think it's best to stay in the 20-30ft range and not have to worry too much about their stomachs blowing out. I just know (have that feeling) that there are bigger fish waiting for me and my jig in those deep holes during those sunny summer days.Thanks again.
518453,Guest,2002-03-31 15:35:00,0,"One of the great walleye myths is that you have to go deep in the hot months for large walleye - it's simply not true. You rarely have to go deeper than 12-15 feet for great walleye fishing at anytime in the season on any water. I don't have much patience for people who pull fish out of 40 feet of water - it doesn't matter how slowly you pull them up they're going to die - even if they appear to swim away on their own their bodies can't adjust to the pressure differential. If you are fishing 40 feet of water be prepared to keep every fish you catch other wise you're wasting the resource.Anyway enough of that rant - ha! Seriously, I never go deeper than 15 feet and do exceptioally well. You just have to fish by trial and error until you clue into some shallow water tactics. Once you start to figure it out I guarantee you'll never go back. It's less work and you catch more fish in a shorter time-frame (I've fished deep and there is no comparison)."
518454,stewart,2002-03-31 19:33:00,100,"I've found them sporadically in the shallows in August, but what is your key to finding them consistently?"
518441,stewart,2002-03-22 14:41:00,100,"With no tube to belch air, like lakers have, walleye have to eliminate it through their bloodstream. You'd have to bring that fish up reeal slow, like a day or two, to really help it any...28ft is two atmosphere's worth of pressure if I remember corectly."
518436,Guest,2002-03-23 07:32:00,0,"Hey river shark. What do you consider deep water walleye?? 40 feet sounds pretty deep to me. Hard to get a good hook set if it is too much deeper. You sarcastically responded ""that's deep???"". Share what you know or don't respond. Thanks. Link"

518444,Guest,2002-03-23 23:05:00,0,deep is not 20 or 30 feet walleyes caught from the bottom in 72 ftt of water at aikens lake in sept and near the bottom at gods lake in 85 feet if water these were all 5 pound and better fish
518445,docIN,2002-03-24 01:04:00,120,Wow... that's deep!What the heck do you use to get that deep and be able to set the hook???
518446,iamwalleye1,2002-03-24 07:10:00,1589,We use spinners with a 3OZ. bottom bouncer!
518447,docIN,2002-03-25 02:51:00,120,I just wanted to say thanks for all the replies.I have one more question...Do you look for structure in these deep holes or where it goes from structure to deep (if you know what I mean)?Thanks again.
518448,Reels,2002-03-25 05:52:00,2876,"In my experience, they have been small to medium flats, with deeper water adjacent to them.<{{}}><"
518449,Wawajake,2002-03-25 06:10:00,413,"THis deep water fishing is the area that Ontario's MNR has not fully appreciated when they have now imposed slot sizes for many prts of Northern Ontario , so what happens when a fish from the deep is pulled in and does not meet slot size criteria , we will have to hope it survives and put it back . It will be a shame to see fish left to float or be eaten by scavengers. I think I will try to avoid fishing more than 28 ft deep where I have other options. jake"
518450,docIN,2002-03-26 05:43:00,120,"I could not agree more. I caught a pike a few years ago and the spoon was out of sight. I was able to get the spoon out without hurting the fish but, I had the fish out of the water for along time and of course it was outside the slot. I did everything possible to revive the fish for about 40min and it went belly up. It's a shame to see a good fish go that way. Always go barbless!!!"
518431,docIN,2002-03-21 12:33:00,120,"When fishing deep water (20-30ft) for walleyes in Canada, what method do you find most productive?Thanks for the input."
518432,Guest,2002-03-21 12:49:00,0,"Jig-ga, jig-ga!Can't beat a jig. I use a 3/8oz. glow/white whistler jig and 4"" glow twister tail sweetened with a leach. Of course, your favorite jig will probably do just fine.tom"
518433,Rat,2002-03-21 15:37:00,102,"Vertical jig. Color, bait, plastic, etc. depends on the lake clearity and time of day. You can do 'em all day long with this. Also, the jigging spoons like the swedish pimple can be terrific as well."
518434,Guest,2002-03-21 16:45:00,0,YOU CALL THAT DEEP !!!!
518437,bigfish1965,2002-03-21 19:37:00,3210,"First, you have to switch to a no-stretch line like fireline. Then I suggest a somewhat longer rod than most use, like an 8 or 9 ft. Use a carolina rigged minnow and I bet ya catch more than your buddies. Remember to bring the walleye up slowly from greater than 20 ft, and handle them carefully. After your first fish blows out its stomach, you'll know what I mean."

518440,Reels,2002-03-21 22:55:00,2876,"We sometimes go down to 60' in Minaki and use either a big 1/2 oz jig, or the heaviest bottom bouncer we can find. You gotta fiz them, even bringing up slow. Even then, I worry about the mortality rate.<{{}}><"

518442,Thumper,2002-03-22 07:23:00,133,"Pulling cranks has been very effective for us in some of the lakes that have a cisco or herring population. Many of the larger fish key in on these fish later in the summer. It is aso a means to explore the areas you are fishing and if you pass over a likely area and spot fish on the sounder we will mark them and go at them with jigs, live bait ect. These mid lake areas are also home to some huge Pike. We have caught them over 40in inthese mid lake areas. It also allows you to travel a little faster and cover area for the aggressive fish. Some of our best ""spots"" were found by just doing this on hot sunny days. Good luck."
