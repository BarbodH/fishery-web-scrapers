I'm out to Kabinakigami May 24th and was wondering what you thought we could expect. I realize that you may not be a weatherman but maybe you've got an inkling as to what we can expect. Thanks alot."

Early morning is ussually mist coming off the lake and perhaps a few degrees above freezing ,(sometimes mist so thick you can't go out on water till 10 am, but by lunch its 55 or 60 degrees farenheit and mist burned off. By the evening the mosquitos are out a bit . So stay out on the open water and fish instead !! You can expect rain and high water from snow melt but hopefully short weather patterns. have funjake"

However, when we had our lodge, we found out that what we find nice, may ppl from the U.S. find downright bitter. Temps can and will drop below freezing during the evenings in May up here, add a bit of rain to that and it can get nasty. Bring something to keep you dry. and pack in layers, It's always easier to remove something if you're too hot.....(:"
