518633,Guest,2002-03-27 06:40:00,0,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone could help me answer a question. I want to know how much beer I could bring accross the border, there will be four of us going for a week and we planned two cases a piece but I heard you are only allowed one. Is this true and if so what happens if you bring more than this (can you pay a fee and take the two cases)? Any input is appreciated, thanks!!!"
518634,Eric,2002-03-27 06:59:00,114,Declare what you have and pay a fee if you have more than 1 case per adult or stop and buy some good canadian brew. have a great time. Eric
518635,bphunger,2002-03-27 07:20:00,28,"Yes, be sure to declare all you bring. Don't try to hide it. You may pay more than you want to if you try to hide. Also, if you are in more than one vehicle be sure to divide it up between vehicles. If you have it all in one vehicle the folks in that vehicle are the responsible parties. Have a great trip and enjoy the fishing.BH"
518636,Illini Bob,2002-03-27 08:46:00,16,"Tim, We've done the same in the past. You'll pay between $8 - $9 US per case in duty for the last 4 cases. If you want to just take 4 cases with you, you can buy the rest in Canada for about $23 US per case. So, depending on what you pay in the states, it's probably a push for the cases with duty charges. Besides, the Canadian beer in bottles taste great when you get off the lake after a great day of fishing."

518637,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-03-27 09:54:00,618,"It has been a while since I crossed the border with ""extra"" beer. I recall paying a duty of about $2.00 Canadian. Does anybody know what the current duty would be or have a link to where exact duty can be found?"
518638,Guest,2002-03-27 10:20:00,0,"The last time we paid it was about $8-9 Canadian per case duty. I asked the customs agent at the time how they figured duty amount and was told it was based on the cost of the beer in the US. The higher the cost in the US, the lower the duty. They just asked up what we paid per case and figured the duty on that. This was about 3 years ago.Our reason for taking vs. buying up there was the time of day. Beer stores in Canada were closed when we crossed and our fly-in was at 7:00 AM. No time to buy up there. They also said that we were allowed up to 4 extra cases per person and could pay the duty on those. No more than 4 extras were allowed even with paying duty.Don't try to smuggle. Not worth the effort or stress. Just pay. One guy had a 1/2 gal. of whiskey he forgot to mention (not a beer drinker). They confiscated the whiskey and he paid about a $40 Canadian fine. Plus he went dry for the week."
518639,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-03-27 22:32:00,618,"Wow, that sounds fishy. I'm not doubting you but figuring the duty by how much the case cost doesn't seem right. I would think that there is a set duty per case. How about it, does anybody know the right answer as to how duty is figured on a case of beer. Is it a set price or is a complicated formula used, or is it up to a whim of the customs guy??? I'm not trying to start an argument, but it might be benificial to know. Well, anybody out there with knowledge???"
518640,Thumper,2002-03-28 03:57:00,133,"MK is correct in the way it is charged. The 8 dollars or so sounds right as well.""Goods valued in excess of your exemption are subject to customs duty and GST. Rates of duty differ for various commodities and depending on the country of origin of the goods. Customs duty is a percentage of the price of the goods and GST is charged on the total of the purchase price plus the Customs duty. Contact Customs for rates of customs duty on particular commodities and preferential rates of duty on goods in excess of your exemption limits.""The whole idea of the duty is to increase the price so the local product is the same price as the imported one. You may save a few dollars but why not just buy the local product? To myself anyways filling out forms and waiting in line and running the risk of a full customs search if the guy does not like your demeanor is not worth the potential savings. There would have to be other reasons for me to do this."
