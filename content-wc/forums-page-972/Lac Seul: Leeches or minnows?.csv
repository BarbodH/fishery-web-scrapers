517261,Guest,2002-03-17 12:57:00,0,"Guide #7, We stay at Black Bay Outpost and we usalley fish our way to Vaughn. But a straight run would probably be 10 to 15 minutes (30HP 16 ft). We have always had good luck in Vaughn and have hooked up on some nice fish 6-8 lbs. We only fish Vaughn post spawn ..early June. Dont even try it when we go in July or August to many good fish out on lake structure. Vaughn June ladys seem to like Leechs on Char-Orange-Pink jigs and we do use some Marabou. Have good luck to on structure close to mouth of Vaughn if we fish windy points and flats the Hogs can rest on.....Good Luck"
517262,Guest,2002-03-20 14:41:00,0,"I have fished vaughn lake in June, July, August, and September. My parties have spent any where from one day to one week fishing vaughn. Last year we where there during second week of July, between 5 people we caught well over 400 walleye. Most were over 18"" all the way to 26"". My experience on Vaughn is more walleye in spring, less walleye in fall but much bigger. There seems to plenty of food to substain ample numbers of big walleye in vaughn throughout the year. I was so impressed with the lake, myself and some others went in and bought the only flyin camp on Vaughn. I have never needed to boat onto the main part of Lac Suel, but have seen plenty boaters come down to vaughn. The local fish and game people told me its a spawing area druning the spring and in the fall the valleyes come there to chase the spawing batfish."

517265,MNStarfish,2002-03-26 10:36:00,32,"I am going to Lac Seul for the first time in the End of June, do you guys think I should bring my own boat(17 foot Starcraft w/90hp merc) or get the rental?"
517266,reddog,2002-03-26 19:26:00,2158,"If you plan on covering alot of water, and are comfortable with navigation techniques on big water with lots of islands, I would say bring your own boat. If you are going to stay within 10 miles of camp, I would opt for the rental. Bring along an extra prop, just in case."
517251,Guest,2002-02-23 07:46:00,0,"oh, and one more fun tip.Try the shallows in the evening with the shad rap family.many doubles and triples in our 3 man boat last. close the barbs so release is easier. they'll be there, just keep going shallower, like 3-4 feet deep on sandy shorelines. Especially if the wind was blowing in to your favorite shoreline all day.Good Luck! guide#7 out"
517253,Guest,2002-02-25 12:17:00,0,"Nate,Last year I tried 3 dozen leaches along with usual arsenol of minnows and crawlers (July 7-14). I can't say that the leaches caught any more fish. Except for the previously stated durability, they offer no advantage IMHO.I agree with eyewitness regarding his tip on dropping or tossing a jig once the spinner rigs have found the Walleyes (wind permitting). Lots more fun & more productive."
517254,Guest,2002-02-27 21:38:00,0,"Read the posts and most have some good info. Here are my thoughts1. Price - some years ago we just got tired of paying the big bucks for minnows. Also, if the lodge is out, and this happens a lot, you have to take time to go het them.2. Worms and leeches - we use them exclusively. Depending on how many people we have we take a flat of worms with us and buy leeches by the pound at Ft. Francis.3. W&L last all week. We generally fish last week of July and first week in Aug. Hot weather just does the minnows in. They just do not last and the M&L last all week.4. Finally, we found no down side in numbers or size when fishing W&L.Quite frankly this is a no brainer for us anymore. We catch a lot of walleyes and one man could go through 3 dozen or more minnows in one day. That comes to about 20 dz per person per week At $3.50 per doz thats $70 per person. $70 will buy a glat of worms and 2 lbs of leeches. This takes care of 3-4 men the entire week.Jim"
517255,Guest,2002-03-12 15:05:00,0,Have fished Lac Seul for many years. I personally think that Leechs are the choice bait. We fish the Southeast part of the lake and it contains numerous shallow drops and post spawn transistion areas that contain Walleye that are eager to sample a slow moving leech on a jig. I think the key with Leechs is ..slow...slow...slow. This type of fishing is condusive with Lac Seuls changing bottom structure and is especially effective on its many drop offs.....Good Luck
517256,Guest,2002-03-12 15:13:00,0,"Mike,What area southeast do you fish.Were do you stay, what time of year?I'm going to be on Pelican Lake June 2, plan to fish pelican fall and lac Seul."
517258,Jesse-WI,2002-03-12 22:14:00,534,On most days it simply does not matter. There are those rare occasions where it matters alot. So I would suggest you spend a little extra and get both plus some crawlers.
517257,Guest,2002-03-13 07:15:00,0,"We fish out of Lac Seul Lodges ""BlackBay Outpost"". This location gives us easy access to Vaughn Lake and Williams Bay. Vaughn is a great spawning area for Walleye and we fish second week of June which allows us to find Walleyes still active in Vaughn and staged outside of spawnining water on windy structure. Williams is more of a Pike area but has yielded many nice Walleye. About half of our trips have been in July and the most consistent pattern for us then is fishing structure contigious with the main channel. This pattern gives us many islands and flats that are close enough to deep water which allow the fish to have a variety of water depth. Majority of fish are caught on the windy side of islands and points...but look for flats with second stage structure in the wind. We like to drag Perch and Firetiger Rapalas in 8-12 ft of water on the flats. This techinique helps us locate fish for the Jig/Leech bite......Buy your Leechs as soon as you cross the border. We have six fisherman in our party and we get two pounds of leechs per week. We also order perserved minnows from ""Uncle Josh Bait"". Uncle Josh has a website and we order twelve bottles of their largest shinners. The shinners are very effective and the price is right. Good Luck...you can reach me at [email protected]"
517252,Guest,2002-03-13 12:52:00,0,"Sat in on Sam Anderson's seminar at the Nebraska Walleye Expo. He said he had basically the same problem on a trip to Cananda...small leeches. What he did was use a 2-hook spinner rig and hook a small leech on each hook, then the 2 small leeches look like 1 ""monster leech"". Sam said he caught numerous pigs after switching to the ""monsterleech"" method, that and longer snells."
517259,Guest,2002-03-14 06:49:00,0,"I worked in Sioux Lookout for 16 years and am caught drifting off in my thoughts everytime I read a post mentioning the mighty Lac Seul, sure miss the walleye fishing and remoteness of it up there now that I hang my fishing pole in S. Ont. Anywayz,from what I have read you already have lots of advice so will just drop you one more tip. If you are fishing the northeast end of the lake (Bear Narrows-Chamberlain Narrows) Ojibway Baits (out of Sioux Lookout) makes daily trips up to Chamberlain Narrows with supplies and will bring up minnows (for a price) if you order ahead of time the day you want them. Buddies and myself spent long weekend in August up there last year and the minnows boat outfished the leech-crawlers boat 10 to 1 but money fish came on leeches. I fish exclusively with either glow in dark jig tipped with minnow or spinner with minnow and am rarely out fished, quantity-wise. Have a good trip."
517260,Guest,2002-03-15 22:18:00,0,"Hey Mike S. when you fish Vaughn, how long does it tak you to get there? We stay at Mahkwa Lodge and can get there in about 20 minutes with the rentals (17' lund alaskans w/ 40 hp 4 stroke). Nice spot to go if the rest of the lake is turned off, but always seems to turn out smaller fish. We have found a few nice spots in there where we pull in 15""-20"" walleye regularly though. Last year I went mostly artificial and left the live bait for my boat partners. The white power tails on a jighead make for some exciting catches. We have never used minnows on Lac seul mainly because of the cost and maintenance.guide#7 out"
517241,NateW,2002-02-16 12:00:00,96,"We'll be on Lac Seul July 6 - 13. The last trip up we fished minnows and plastics almost exclusively for walleyes. Before going up there all I had heard about was minnows. After we got back I heard several people talking about the success they had with leeches.I'd like to hear from the folks who've used both and read your thoughts and opinions. By the way, we had pretty good success with minnows on spinners, but we kept running out of minnows. I know leeches will last longer, but if they don't catch as much fish...? Thanks in advance, this board has never let me down!"
517242,Guest,2002-02-16 19:05:00,0,Hey NateThe answer to your problem is to take MORE minnows!Bet you wish you'd thought of that!Keep using minnow till ya can't get it to hold on the hook anymore.Just a thought!Thought I'd get a wise crack in!LOL!!!Happy trails....
517243,NateW,2002-02-17 19:17:00,96,"Geez!!! I should have specified that I already knew what'd you'd say! Have you paid for that boat yet? (No, I'm not talking cash either!:7 :7 :7"
517245,Big Tim,2002-02-18 04:35:00,63,"I heard the same, minnows,minnows, minnows. We caught lots on minnows, but were going thru them so fast (our minnow bill was $68,AFTER 6 doz. free), Mid week we got rained off the lake & took a ride up to Four Seasons bait shop in Ear Falls & they talked us into trying leeches. Caught the same #'s of fish, maybe even larger ones on leeches. Biggest difference I saw was one leech would hang on for 3-4, even 5 fish boated, no minnow I ever saw could match that. All this was at the end of May, could be different in july. I've heard, here, that crawlers are THE bait of choice in July & August. if you are planning on leeches it's a good idea to call ahead to your bait shop of choice & order them a few weeks in advance they tend to get scarce. I can't put my hand on the # for 4 seasons,Email me or search this forum for it. Good luck in Aug. Lac Seul is one heck of a WALLEYE fishery."

517247,eyewitness,2002-02-18 09:13:00,680,"If you're running spinner rigs try crawlers and use a LARGE Colorado blade vs a small one. Hammered Gold and actually silver/chartruse colors. The larger blade will give plenty of attraction to your rig and will catch you much bigger average size walleye. Crawlers are much cheaper to use, especially if you buy them by the flat, and they work just as well if not better than minnows. I only use minnows or leeches up there when either live bait rigging or jigging. As far as what works better, it's a toss up. In fact, I've had tremendous success vertical jigging with Swedish pimples and flashy Hogger spoons. When you're on fish and they're snappin' it's a must as you don't have to rebait every time you pull a fish in. Bring lots though as the toothy critters will steal em' every so often. I even vertically jigged big spoons with good success, although line twist gets pretty bad with that method. Use crawler/spinners to locate the fish, then park on top of them and jig. Your success rate will double if you take this approach vs. just pulling spinners. Hope I'm not preaching to the choir here. It's just that every time I start thinking about Lac Seul I get dizzy and excited. It's just too much fun."
517244,Guest,2002-02-18 18:20:00,0,LoL....Still waitin for her to keep her end of the bargin!Always ready to practice!Really stinks > no boat yet...and it's paid in fullGo figure
517248,Guest,2002-02-18 18:34:00,0,"I started about 3 years ago using a 2/O light wire aberdeen hooks on my spinner rigs. This way I could thread the minnow onto the bigger hook and not loose 1/2 of my bait from short bitters. At the time was out of stinger hooks so, had to improvise. Took minnow, ran point into mouth > out gill and burried the point into tail section behind dorsal fin. The 2/O hook allowed the minnow to lay flat against the shank of the hook and there was enough gap between minnow and hook to hook the eyes. Can go out with 2-3 dozen minnows and fish the entire day using this method. Yes-1 minnow will catch multiple eyes > dead or alive doesn't matter on spinner rigs!Just another option.."
517249,GregK,2002-02-22 15:42:00,113,"My thinking is if you are up there for that precious once a year trip, bring it all. The general rule of thumb is leechs in the warmer water (summer) and minnows in the cooler water. Last year we went in September for two weeks and the wife and I had a $150 minnow bill. I have never been so happy about a bill! :)"
517250,Guest,2002-02-23 07:42:00,0,"we fish the east end of the pond and have never used a minnow yet.plenty of many, many dozen walleye days have been had on leeches.when the bite is good the jigheads with a twister tail do just as good all alone. this, of course is part of the fun, trying to figure out and learn which colors and types perform the best on a given day.The biggest thorn in our side has been the new restrictions by the ministry, forcing us to buy the small leeches in Canada. We used to bring in some nice, big juicy leeches that any sane walleye would be nuts to pass on.the crawlers and spinners are fine if you don't mind increasing your northern count in the boat.June 26th we'll be rippin's lips on Lac Seul.""Sunsets on Lac Seul make me Drool"" Good Luckguide#7 out"
