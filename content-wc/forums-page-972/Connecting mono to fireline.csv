518598,Guest,2002-03-25 20:05:00,0,"A couple of questions: How much mono backing should I use on my spinning reel before attaching fireline? Also, what type of know do you use for the connection.Thanks for the help."
518599,Fred_G,2002-03-26 05:17:00,908,"Bob,You only need enough mono to cover the bottom of the spool. I always connect the Fireline to the mono with back to back uni knots. Good Luck!Fred"
518600,Guest,2002-03-26 07:14:00,0,Don't bother with the mono. Put 2 wraps of black tape around the spool first.
518601,Peanut,2002-03-26 08:01:00,929,"You can go with little or none, as has been suggested. I think of the mono as more than just backing, however. The mono cuts down the amount of Fireline you need to put on. With 10/4 Fireline, a 2000 series reel can hold more than 150 yards of the stuff. That can get expensive. So, I use enough mono so that 50-70 yards of Fireline comfortably sits on the spool.derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
518602,Wawajake,2002-03-26 08:41:00,413,Is that black electrician tape ?(its glossy ?) or do you mean black friction tape like used for hockey sticks ????thanksjake
518603,Northern Manitoban,2002-03-26 11:20:00,195,You can use black tape.But what i do is i will wrap the fireline by hand a few times around the spool really tight.Then you won't have any slipping problems.FISH ON.
518605,Guest,2002-03-26 13:08:00,0,"I agree with Peanut in post #3 especially for jigging, Lindy Rigging, and bottom bouncing applications. For trolling reels I use 100-125 yds of fireline and after 2-3 seasons I reverse the line by spooling the fireline onto a different reel. I keep track with a small sticker on reel seat. This way I have fresh line closest to baits and save extra $$$ for more fishing toys. :D"

518606,Guest,2002-03-26 14:16:00,0,Use a blood knot.
518607,Red Ruffandsore,2002-03-26 16:41:00,81,Use elastic bands instead of tape that leaves sticky reisdue. All you are doing is covering some/most of the spool so the line won't spin. I hand wind mine tight in the beginning like stated above by N.Manitoba and don't have the problem. I do have two reels with elastic bands and never had the problem with them either.Stay off the pipe...and don't forget to wipe.Red
