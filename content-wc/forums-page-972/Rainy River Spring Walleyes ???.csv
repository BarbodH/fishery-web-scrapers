I have been hearing about the spring walleye fishing on the Rainy River and want to explore this further, then pull out the boat.I want to drive down from Winnipeg for a couple of days fishing and due in large part to the state of the cdn $$$, stay and fish the Cdn (Ontario) side.Please advise on opening dates, Cdn resorts/accomodations, boat launches, bait, resturants. I would really appreciate insight/suggestions from folks who have actually fished there in spring. Nothing like seeing and experiencing this area first-hand and then sharing the +,-, with fellow anglers.Thanks in advance !"

Some years we've had 100 fish days with fish in the 6lb range making up 20% of the catch. Other years we should have played golf. Once or twice we were a day late. So it's a hit or miss type of fishing. Right now (Friday 3-29) the ice still has a hold of the river, but that could change in a day or so. Most of the time we drift jigs and minnows downstream and troll them very slowly back up. Be sure to stay on the Canadian side of the river because the MN DNR and the Ontario MNR patrol this water like a demilitarized zone. Also, be prepared for rain, snow, sun, freezing temps, high water, low water, logs, ice flows and hugh crowds on weekends. If you hit it hot it is worth anything you have to endure. I'm not sure of the access spots on the Canadian side. I'm sure the Ontario, MNR website has them listed. Check the city of Rainy River and Emo for accomodations. TGG"
