I understand that this river gives up some really nice sized fish in the fall of the year in the 10# plus class. You can email me [email protected]."

I've stayed in Selkirk at the Daerwood Inn (about the only 'decent' place in town) and it wasn't clean. However, this was nearly 6 years ago and they may have changed since...And, since you are going to be less than an hour away from Pine Falls, you can always check out the bite on the Winnipeg River if you aren't having luck on the Red."
