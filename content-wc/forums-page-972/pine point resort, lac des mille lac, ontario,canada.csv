The cabins are clean they have a nice dock system and the and the people are friendly. The only thing I will tell you is when you come off the main road you go down a dirt road for 17 miles. What I did is buy one of those blue tarp when before I started down the road I wrapped it around my trailer and front end and put my cover back on so the rocks didn't hammer the boat and trailer. Fishing is good you just have to know where to go. They have a guide that is from I believe Texas, but lives up there all summer and he know the lake very well. He likes to fish with lindy rigs in Bolton bay. Bring up night crawlers they work nice. There is a map of the lake in the claening house that has rocks marked on it."
518658,Guest,2002-03-29 19:35:00,0,why can't these places have a decent access road!! witch bay camp up near kenora is the same way. i guess you pay to bring up your own equipment. i guess i didn't ask enough questions prior to booking. sure hope the fishing makes up for it.
518659,PJM,2002-03-29 19:46:00,3516,"craigtThe drive is not that bad because they maintain the road very well. Pine Point is located in th middle of the lake, so the drive is worth it. I keep going back and even know I don't like that road just wrap the tarp around the boat, it takes 10 minutes. The place is worth it and you won't be disappointed..........."
518660,Thumper,2002-03-29 20:39:00,133,Pine Point is a great place. Most of Northern Ontario is gravel where the good fishing is. If you want you can book at Camp Sawmill Bay or Savanne River Landing. They are right beside the highway. However IMHO Pine Point is the best place to go.
518661,Guest,2002-03-30 04:15:00,0,thanks for the info. can't wait to get up there and give it a shot.
