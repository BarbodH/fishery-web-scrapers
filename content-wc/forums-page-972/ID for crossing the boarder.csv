Also, I have been told, I would need a Canada Card from my car Insurer, for proof of insurance, when I drive in canada. Finally, How long will it take to cross at Inter Falls at about seven in the morning. Thankyou."

They said it was not a neccisty but a recommendation...better safe then sorry. Crossing the border at 7am is not good on Saturday,but the wait is never to long. After all Canada is worth it."
518592,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-03-25 19:14:00,618,The Canada card for insurance is manditory. It is not hard to get. Call your insurance company and ask for it. It has never cost me anything extra
518593,bigfish1965,2002-03-25 20:57:00,3210,The Canada Insurance card is not mandatory in Onatario as long as you have proper coverage. Tons of tourists come here without them. But it is easier if something goes wrong or if you get stopped by police.
518597,Mal,2002-03-25 21:05:00,55,"I cross the border at Windsor and had somewhat of a wait last year when I crossed at the end of September. That was to be expected. I still remember that they asked me for TWO items of identification. That means your drivers lecense and in my case, a birth certificate. I also had one other piece of information on me at the time. In order to get my substitute teaching certificate, I had to be fingerprinted and had the result from the BCI on their official letterhead. Once they say that, they stopped their search of my vehicle and waved me through. I do have one question - is it easier when crossing the border with a visa? What are the pro's and con's of going that route (still will have the other two items for identification."
518596,Guest,2002-03-25 21:06:00,0,"Mike, I live in Michigan and cross the border 15 to 20 times a year. ID is not a problem getting into Canada, it's getting back into the US that can be an issue. I always have my passport when crossing the border. Birth cert is the best alternative. Don't know about the insurance card, but go idea."

518595,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-03-26 23:00:00,618,I stand corrected. Still I wouldn't be without one. Never a hassel getting it. I was told it was manditory many years ago by my insurance agent and had no reason to doubt him. Never checked up on it because it didnot cost any extra. Might have been the insurance companies rule.
