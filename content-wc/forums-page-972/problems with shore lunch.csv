516438,Guest,2002-03-18 16:36:00,0,What? You go on a fly-in fishing trip once a year and dont take one hour out of one day and enjoy a shore lunch. I look forward to that almost as much as landing a trophy. Enjoying a ice cold blue and feasting on some cajun shore lunch (with fresh walleye) is as great as hitting the lottery because if i hit the lottery thats what i would be doing anyways.
516439,Guest,2002-03-19 05:18:00,0,"We started carrying a propane cooker with us and a 2lb propane bottle, cuts down on waiting for the oil to heat up. We don't have to look for fire wood or worry about the fire being put out when we pull away from the shore. Of course carrying propane in the boat presents other safety concerns. We also have out potatoes cut the night before, just put them in a zip lock w/water. Using a electric/DC fillet knife to clean your catch will save some time."
516440,DLH,2002-03-26 20:42:00,1,"NOT MUCH HELP ON THE FIRST DAY, BUT WE KEEP SOME OF THE FILLETS FROM THE DAY BEFORE AND HAVE THEM READY TO PUT IN THE PAN WHEN THE OIL IS HOT. NO CLEANING AND MUCH LESS MESS!"
516441,undertaker,2002-03-30 05:26:00,1,"I TAKE A PORTABLE BB-Q WITH ME ON THE BOAT.I USED TO USE A SMALL CHARCOAL ONE BUT THAT CAN BE A LITTLE DANGEROUS SO I GOT ME A LITTLE PROPANE ONE.I BUILT A LITTLE STAND FOR THE BB-Q SO IT WILL NOT MELT ANY THING AND STAY VERY STABLE ON THE BOAT(16X23X1"" PLYWOOD,TIN ON TOP,SLIP GAURD ON THE BOTTOM AND 4 CLIPS TO HOLD THE BB-Q.)I MADE A FILET BOARD OUT OF A PEICE OF 2X12X20 D-FIR,I DISHED THIS OUT WITH MY ROUTER 3/16 SO IT KEEPS THE MESS UNDER CONTROL.SO ITS START BARBIE,CATCH WALEYE, REBAIT, CAST SET IN ROD HOLDER ,CLEAN FISH PREP FOR COOKING(FOIL,BUTTER,ONION,WHATEVER).THINGS CAN GET VERY INTRESTING IF YOU CATCH MORE WELL YOUR COOKING,IF YOUR ALONE SOME TIMES TO INTRESTING,BUT THATS COOL,WHATS FISHING WITHOUT A LITTLE ADVENTURE.BURNT FINGERS ARE IGNORED WELL HOOK SETS ARE MADE,AND ARE TOTALLY FORGOTEN ABOOT WHEN ENJOYING THE FRESHEST FISH THIS SIDE OF RAW.OH YA THIS IS A BAD IDEA IF ITS ROUGH SEAS BILLY!"
516424,Reels,2002-02-07 19:13:00,2876,Do you boil your taters whole or cut them up?<{{}}><
516430,Guest,2002-02-07 20:53:00,0,"All great ideas that have been posted. Last year we had a guide for a day...he was really efficient. One burlap bag with firewood, one with the food including cooked canned potatoes (were actually very good) and one bag with the cleaning utensils. As the fire started (15 min) he cut up the onion, cleaned the fish, put the beans and corn on. We cooked, ate and rinsed plates and pans in 45 minutes. The pots and dishes were then washed back at camp (as suggested above). Sandwiches.....maybe a couple of days but a fishing trip would not be complete without shore lunches.C YA!"
516431,Guest,2002-02-08 06:32:00,0,"We used to do shore lunch but found it to be too much work and not enough room for the gear. Besides most of our group could'nt be relied upon to bring in fish! Just kidding. We fished Nestor Falls and there were not many places esp. for a glass boat to land!! Now were up at Sioux Narrows, there are several places and we all have new larger boats so we may get into it again. If we get out at day break and fish hard all day a 2 hour lunch would be refreshing. Besides one of the guys that we take fishes more when he's on shore than out in the boat!! Still nice to come back to our cabin and have our shore lunch in the evening."
516425,NateW,2002-02-08 11:52:00,96,"Well partially bake them the night before. You can also boil them, but baking just seems to work for us. Get them about 3/4 done, then cut them up with some onions and put them into a one or two gallon zip-loc and store in the fridge during the night. When you leave the next morning just grab the zip-loc on your way out the door. We put the taters in a small cooler that also keeps our soft drinks. We usually throw some pudding snackpacks in the cooler too. They're a good desert to cut the greasey taste from you mouth."
516432,Guest,2002-02-11 08:27:00,0,so whats with an extra hour? if you catch as many fish as we do .....the extra hour is a break from the exertsion. pre-prep helps like a lot of folks say here. but find a good fishing hole and you wont care about losing the fishing time!
516433,Guest,2002-03-18 13:09:00,0,"I can't understand what I'm hearing. I am new to this forum but too much time for shore lunch? C'mon, if your in a tournament I can understand the time wasted but fresh walleye, fried potatoes and a beer. What it better than that guys? Do you want the swedish bathing suit team to drop down from the skies too? (well ok, that would be alright) A great shore lunch does require a little prep but get it done the night before and it's easy and one of the things I enjoy as much as the fishing. We usually have several boats in our party and meet up at shorelunch and swap stories of the mornings fishing and enjoy an Ice cold beer together. Relax your on vacation, take a break and soak all that wilderness in. A nice long shore lunch with your best friends and family is better than the best steak at the best restaurant. Happy Fishing everyone."
516434,Guest,2002-03-18 13:30:00,0,what! you have a beer with your shore lunch? have you no respect for the law of the land? how can you enjoy yourselves when you are so blatantly breaking the law? stop this dangerous behavior before you kill someone with your negligent antics!!!
516435,Guest,2002-03-18 14:05:00,0,Hey ddr- give it up its getting old!
516436,Guest,2002-03-18 14:18:00,0,A shore lunch should not take more than an hour and fifteen minutes. If you rush it it can take as little as 45 minutes. It is very possible that the guides are taking a little R and R.
516437,Guest,2002-03-18 15:26:00,0,"To speed up a shore lunch use canned veggies and potatoes. Use a coleman stove. Everyone has to be involved with preperation and clean up. Personally, I'm on the clock 250 days a year. When I'm on a fishing trip and plan a shore lunch I'm going to take all the time I want. Even a good nap afterwards. Like the old song says ""You got to stop and smell the pine needles.""TGG"
516418,sdyer,2002-01-17 05:44:00,34,"How long do your shore lunches take? I love shore lunch but it allways seems to take us two hours to clean the fish, cook them, and then clean up the site. We lose too much fishing time. Does anyone have the same problems? Can anyone offer solutions? Please help. Thanks.Duffy"
516419,Matches,2002-01-17 07:10:00,236,Sdyer: Go to the thread below yours and read Gene's reply. He does it all within one hour.
516420,Guest,2002-01-20 19:16:00,0,"Here's a few tips, not sure if you use them....If you're using wood, make sure it is dry and use alot of kindling at first, this burns fast and will give you a good bed quickly.Anything other than your fish should be prepped the night before, especially potatoes, boil them the night before, and they only take a few minutes to fry.As soon as your done cooking, remove all food from your cookware, fill with water and throw back on the fire while you're eating. This will loosen up all the baked on crud...lol"
516421,fishinnut,2002-01-20 19:53:00,642,Save time and do without the open fire; Get a Coleman stove.
516422,Guest,2002-01-20 20:25:00,0,"Fishinnut,What do you do with the oil you cook them in? I use a coleman stove, but I end up making a fire to burn the oil, paper plates and paper towels.Fritz"
516423,Guest,2002-01-21 11:34:00,0,"I've used a Coleman stove up until this year. I don't use paper plates, I have plastic ones, they wash off with lake water good enough until we get to the cabin and wash them properly. If I have oil left over I just re-use it, poured it back into the bottle thru a funnel with a piece of cheese cloth. We always cary a couple trash bags with us to carry any trash we create during lunch. Usually we end up picking up a bunch of somebody else's trash too. When we beach the boat everything starts off like clockwork. I start the stove and get the potatoes frying (They were 3/4 baked the night before, diced up with onion and put into 1 Gal zip-loc bags.) and get the oil in the other fry pan hot. By the time the fish are cleaned, the potatoes are almost done, the fish pan is smoking. (I cut the fish into smaller piece and we eat them with our hands.) Sometimes I will have made a cold pasta salad the night before and we just keep it int the cooler with the potatoes and soft drinks. It helps if everyone knows what to do when. We have one guy clean all the fish and a couple guys that handle all the clean-up. I do the cooking. All said, total time on the beach is about one hour, and that's taking time to sit and scratch a while too!"
516426,Guest,2002-01-22 21:40:00,0,"When we do shore lunch, everyone has a job to do. My partner and I usually get to the site about 15 minutes before the rest of the crew and get the fire started. Things like cans of beans and water can be placed over the fire immediately. Then we start filleting the fish. About this time everyone else notices the smoke and starts coming in for lunch. My brother tends the fire and starts heating the oil for the potatoes. He, or his partner, slice the taters and get the shore lunch mix ready. Then its about time to start the taters and put the oil for the fish on the fire. It's done this way because the fish cooks a lot faster than the potatoes. About this time (15-20 minutes after the whole process started) the fish is ready to be cooked and the beans are ready to be eaten. In less than half an hour total the food is all cooked and people are eating. The oil, plates, and other burnables are tossed on the fire as soon as possible so that they burn completely before we put the fire out. The grill top is thrown in the fire to burn itself clean and dipped in the lake to release the residue and cool it off. Kill the fire and get to fishing. Teamwork, and lots of years of practice, make the difference."
516427,rainy,2002-01-28 22:08:00,21,"shore lunch is no problem bring a sandwich and save the fish for supper, you get more time on the lake less crap in the boat and more time to relax and lie about your day of fishing"
516428,Guest,2002-01-29 08:54:00,0,prepare everything ahead of time...cept for the fish. byo you own wood so you dont spend time searching. clean the pans when you get back to camp. but the real key is to bring hot oil...that way you save time heating it up!
516429,Guest,2002-02-05 21:37:00,0,"I guide and I did over 75 shorelunches last year and I didn't have one over 1 hr long! Tips:1. Get your fire burning first. 2. Heat oil while you cut your potatoes (raw)3. While potatoes are cooking, clean and bread your fish.4. When potatoes are done remove the excess oil and place the pan on a hot rock, this will keep your taters warm while you cook the fish.Just a few tips on how to speed thigs up a bit.Guide"
