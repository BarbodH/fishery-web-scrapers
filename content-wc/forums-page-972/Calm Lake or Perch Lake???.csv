518280,Guest,2002-03-18 06:48:00,0,"I've fished Perch...nice lake. Haven't explored it too much though. Fishing was decent but not spectacular...but that doesn't mean much. I've SEEN Marr's Perch Lake Lodge and it looks great but I can't comment on the amenities. Nice lake, nice area...can't loose.I haven't been to Calm yet...its on the radar though.Tom"
518281,tracker,2002-03-18 07:13:00,91,Also visited Marrs Perch lake lodge but stayed in the RV. Fishing was average but the owners were very freindly and the people staying there all had good things to say.
518282,Guest,2002-03-18 07:47:00,0,Stayed at Calm a few years ago at Indiaonta resort. Nice place with friendly people. Fishing was OK and the Bass I saw at the resort would make anyones head turn. All round a real nice place.

Relatives still go there and probably do better now (on pike and walleye) than they did in the past (due to bag limit changes). Used to be incredibly huge smallies in Calm, but it seemed that as the number of fish increased, the size decreased. 22 3/4"" was the biggest smallie we caught. It was caught by my brother who later in the same day lost one he felt was 2-3""s bigger!!"
