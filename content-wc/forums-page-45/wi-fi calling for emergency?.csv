6658246,Bstar,2022-05-22 06:21:00,564,"I agree, we purchased a Garmin InReach a few years back. It's good peace of mind knowing you can push one button and the nearest search and rescue has your coordinates. It also allows you to text by satellite. The app for your phone allows you to pair it via bluetooth which makes texting a lot easier. Well worth the investment."
6658604,Scottyd,2022-05-23 18:01:00,3,I'm not 100% but I think wifi phone also has to be answered by wifi. Have a great trip Paul.
6658664,RMBin303,2022-05-23 21:16:00,927,Not accurate. Here is the ultimate solution. If there is coverage.https://www.starlink.com/rv
6657596,stjoeguy,2022-05-20 06:33:00,979,"We've always had a satellite phone in the past for our trips to Canada. Thankfully, we've never had to use it. The isolated cabin we're going to does not have any cell phone reception, but it does have internet. What do you think of using wi-fi calling for an emergency instead of a satellite phone?"
6657604,Yellowfin123,2022-05-20 06:58:00,2182,"i'm sure no techy, but all my kids, their friends, girlfriends, etc seem to talk more over the internet then they do their cell phones so it seems pretty common looks like to me but i would not have a clue how to do it , juls is a techy maybe she'll give ya some pointers"
6657616,lmoore,2022-05-20 07:23:00,40,"Could be a good option. I think Wi-Fi calling is disabled by default, so I would make sure to have it enabled prior to the trip so you aren't trying to turn in on while dealing with an emergency. On an Iphone its Settings>Cellular>WiFi Calling>There is a slider to turn ""WiFi Calling on This Phone"" to On. I'm not sure the path on an android phone."
6657628,GBS,2022-05-20 07:43:00,2271,"Also consider - of course it doesn't work if you are out of range of the WiFi, so you may only be able to call if you are near/in the cabin.Location services are bad to very bad with WiFi calling, so if someone isn't able to give the responders a location, it can be much harder for the responders to find them.So somebody would have to make it back to the cabin. Not much use if you are stranded even a short ways away....And, check into your carrier, as you can't assume your phone will work even then, if international calling is not covered by your plan, whether WiFi or not. My super cheap other wise plan, for example, just doesn't allow it."
6657640,Yellowfin123,2022-05-20 07:49:00,2182,"yea thats right, i remember on LOTW there was no cell coverage but the kids were making calls on the wifi and that would only be good around the cabin"
6657668,prov1800,2022-05-20 08:29:00,5010,Since some of my fishing/hunting trips take me off the grid at times I rely on my Garmin Expedition.It has texting and email and a emergency button.Has great mapping as well and works great with the Bluetooth to my cell phone for easy use.
6657864,Hunts1,2022-05-20 18:54:00,123,"I have Verizon and I can rent a Sat phone for under $100 for a week. Not certain what carrier you have but check with them. Way cheaper than buying a permanent unit, assuming only occasional needs long term.https://www.vzwsatellite.com/product...al/iridium9575 Emergency communications probably won't be addressed with WiFi. If you are close enough for that you can paddle or swim home. If you are concerned about the ability to communicate from a remote area get a Sat Phone. There are no other good options other than making sure that the rest of your group knows where to look for you."
6657930,Fisherman1792,2022-05-21 04:17:00,927,"I use wi-fi calling all the time while i'm at work. We have no cell coverage, I can use my regular cell# through my service provider as long as the wi-fi symbol on my phone is on or use facebook messanger to call and I also have a free app on my phone that I can call with. I have a Samsung. It may not be super clear at times but you can have a conversation with the other party. Fisherman 1792"
6657986,lassh,2022-05-21 07:25:00,553,I would be cautious about relying on wifi calling. Oftentimes the remote wifi strength is very weak and calls won't go out. You might consider renting a sat phone this year and experimenting with the wifi calling at your location. Too many unknowns to risk if you really want that safety communication feature IMHO.
6657998,stjoeguy,2022-05-21 07:59:00,979,I like the idea of getting the satellite phone this year and trying out the wi-fi calling. Thanks for all the replies.
