In June of last year my son and I embarked on a 2 month canoe trip in NW Ontario, something that was incredibly important to me for a number of reasons. I did many long expeditions like this as a younger man, and really wanted to experience that with my son before I got too old. I'd also been struggling with the death of my dad and other personal issues, and I looked at the trip as almost a way to fix myself. At first the trip was great. Despite enduring some hardships my son and I had an incredible time. We slept when we were tired, ate when we were hungry, fished every day, and travelled a great many miles through a wilderness I'd experienced intimately as a younger man years previously. It was the trip of a lifetime. Six weeks into the trip my sister messaged me on my inReach device that our mother was failing and didn't have much time left. I did my best, I truly did and so did my son. We paddled close to 100 kilometres in 3 days to get to our extraction point early so I could make it home to see her, but it was too late. On the morning we arrived at the pick up spot my sister messaged me that mom had passed. It was an incredibly tough thing to deal with and it still is, but I've been trying hard to move forward. To that end I took the very large step of selling my house in southern Ontario and buying a riverfront property on the Goulais River right at Lake Superior about 35 minutes north of Sault Ste. Marie. The new property closes on March 4, so there's a very big change in my life about to happen and I'm excited about it! On the fly in fishing front I did manage to do one trip in mid September last year to Blackbirch Lake with Gray Wood outfitters in Nakina. (Formerly Eddie North). It was honestly amazing. No giant walleyes but as many 1-3 pound fish as you wanted all day long non stop. I think the number of pike 40"" or greater was 19 or 20? Can't remember exactly, but it was a decent number. Biggest was 44 I think, so almost all of them were low 40's clones. TONS of pike in the high 30's as well. Cabin was just refurbished last year along with new motors for the boats so on that end it was great. It's definitely NOT a 5 star camp, but it's neat and clean and everything works. No extensive write up on the trip, but I do have an hour long overview video of the trip on youtube if you want to check it out:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLdCF8WG_Lk Hope everyone here is doing well, cheers!"
6629610,MN_Moose,2022-01-31 10:38:00,964,Sorry for the loss of your parents. You do a great job telling a story and painting a picture.
6629736,vteye3,2022-02-01 06:21:00,496,I truly have enjoyed your trips with your son as a reader. As previously noted you are a wonderful writer and hope your trips continue for decades.
6629808,LoDo,2022-02-01 09:12:00,721,Sorry to hear of your losses Mike. Hang in there! Love that you were able to knock out a canoe trip of a lifetime with your son. Love watching your youtube videos and check out your website often.
6629854,griff,2022-02-01 11:23:00,40,"Mike, My sincerest condolences on the loss of both of your parents. Losing someone close is always very difficult. Best of luck to you in your new home."
6629930,Wawajake,2022-02-01 18:43:00,413,"Mike......my condolences , and also a welcome to the Sault area and a fresh start."
6629938,SweetD,2022-02-01 19:53:00,243,"Mike, sorry for your loss. My guess is your Mom was cheering you and your son on and if asked she would tell you to make that trip with your son 100/100 times. I didnâ€™t know your mom but would certainly suspect she is like most mothers in that she always wanted the best for you!!!! No regrets Mike!!!"
6629978,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-02-02 07:19:00,240,"Mike--thanks for the great trip report. I look forward to seeing these excellent videos and trip reports. And I, too, am sorry for your loss--few things in life are harder than losing a parent. Good luck on your move--closer to those Michigan steelhead.... On another note, I have bought a few of Kevin Callan's books on Ontario canoe routes. Really enjoy reading these books, even though it is unlikely I would ever take one of those canoe trips. I think there might be a market for a similarly written book on outpost Ontario trips? You have a treasure trove of writings and photos, and I would love to see them in a book form. Thanks again, and happy new year!"
6630240,Mike Borger,2022-02-02 17:56:00,1554,"Thank you everyone for the very kind words. I'm no different than anyone else, we all have to bear this cross at some point and it's never easy. Cheers to everyone here. We're on this site because we share a common passion - we're kindred spirits. Here's to better times ahead for EVERYONE!"

On the same note, I wanted to say that I admire your spirit for having the guts to relocate, considering that you have a son. I was thinking about moving to the Bahamas a few months ago. The move was on the rocks from the beginning becausthe Bahamas have a high murder rate, but later, my fiancee said she didn't feel ready for such a big step. How did your move go? Did your wife understand you? How'd your son react to the move?"
