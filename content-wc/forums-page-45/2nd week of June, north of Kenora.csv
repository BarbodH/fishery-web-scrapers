A couple weeks ago our outfitter emailed me and said their cabin on Chase had flooded out and that they wouldn't be able to get us in there. They moved us to a cabin they operate on Nance Lake. I had done a fair amount of research on Chase, but nothing on Nance. Anyone been there in the past ? Tips and advice would be great, if you have anything to offer. Thanks."
