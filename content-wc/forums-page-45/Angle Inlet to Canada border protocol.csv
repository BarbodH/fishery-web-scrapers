6658136,lassh,2022-05-21 17:31:00,553,I'm sending you a PM.
6650508,lassh,2022-04-24 12:46:00,553,"What does the process entail for: 1) Getting to Angle Inlet from US 2) Crossing into Canada and staying in Canada for a week 3) Once you've crossed into Canada, what is process for temporarily entering back into US and then back into Canada? 4) What is process for return to US from Angle Inlet? 5) What are the options for leaving your vehicle/trailers at Angle Inlet? What are roads like between Baudette and Angle Inlet? We will probably depart by boat from Morson, but I want to understand the option of departing from Angle Inlet since it is shorter boat ride and others in my party will want to fully understand the options. Thanks for sharing your experiences as always. I'm sure I'll be posting more questions as this trip materializes."
6650526,Old Timer,2022-04-24 15:00:00,255,"Lassh: Maybe I can help with one or two of your questions. If you're headed to Spruce there isn't much difference boating in from The Angle or Morson. I've gone both ways, but prefer the the Morson route. I recall driving to the Angle requires you to use a nasty stretch of gravel on the east/west stretch between Canada and The Angle. On the other hand, the roads to Morson from IF or Baudette are full paved and pretty good traveling. Also, for me, the drive to Morson is substantially shorter than driving around the south side of LOTW, and then north and back east into The Angle. I haven't taken The Angle route since Canada closed its handy customs station on Cyclone Island. That's quite a few years ago. I know there's now a call-in station on the the east/west gravel road going into The Angle. Then another call-in station on Oak Island for the back and forth travel by boat. Others can be more helpful on the call-in procedure, especially with the Covid protocol. The resorts on Flag and Oak should know how those call-in stations work. Another issue to keep in mind is the bait restrictions that prohibit you from taking any bait into Canada by land or water."
6650540,Thalweg,2022-04-24 15:42:00,243,Here are answers to a few of your questions - https://lakeofthewoodsmn.com/driving...fc32627c19c850
6651018,lassh,2022-04-26 06:56:00,553,Thanks for the link. This s a handy reference for crossing protocol.
6651058,IowaWalleye1978,2022-04-26 08:31:00,96,Went thru the inlet last September. We left our vehicles at Youngs Bay. If you are staying in the NW angle then I would go thru the inlet but if you are staying at Spruce I would go thru Morson because of the extra wheel time to get to the inlet and the gravel.
6651130,lassh,2022-04-26 11:14:00,553,"Thanks for taking the time to share your knowledge. I'm actually going to Bell Island, but I figured more people know where Spruce Island is and it is on the same route to get to Spruce. I've not been in Morson area before but from Navionics I see two routes to get to the area. The shortest and probably somewhat more protected is through Sunset Channel then channel north of Splitrock, North and Firebag Islands. The other route goes between Basil and Painted Rock Island then north between Painted Rock and Big Island then west of Splitrock, south of North and Firebag Islands to Sabaskosing Bay."
6651134,lassh,2022-04-26 11:19:00,553,"Thanks. Yes, Less gravel and less time in truck should make up for the longer boat ride."
6651148,Old Timer,2022-04-26 12:24:00,255,"Lash: I can't put my finger on Bell Island, but have traveled each of the three routes you are reviewing. Without the map I'm unfamiliar where Bell Island is located. But I assume up towards Sabaskosing Bay. You're probably unloading at either the public landing or the Morson Marina. Both are in Hanson Bay and that's shallow. When reaching the main lake you can either go north and sneak between Raspberry Islands or go directly west to the bigger water. Most travelers going up that way head northwest towards the Sunset Channel and take that going west until you turn northwest and go past Stairway Point. From there keep on the track up through the Nash narrows and then on the main track past Rubber and Firebag Islands that are to your left. After you pass Firebag you'll hit bigger water before you you reach the south entrance to Sabaskosing Bay. Or you can keep going until you reach the wider entrance to the north. I'm also familiar with the other two routes you proposed, but they're used less frequently when heading up towards Sabaskosing Bay. I only go through Painted Rock or further south through Fish Narrows when intending to fish the Basil Channel or south of North Island. Of course, if you nurse your way through Painted Rock you can view the pictographs along the south shoreline. I hope this info is helpful to you. As has been stated above, government map # 6202 will be invaluable to you for the big picture. I don't use the Hot Spot map series. Just saying"
6651182,lassh,2022-04-26 14:27:00,553,Yeah. Hotspots map doesn't have the detail that the other map does.
