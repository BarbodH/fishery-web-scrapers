6657794,gmattbruin,2022-05-20 13:39:00,174,No worries. Its $160Can for 1000.How does that compare to you guys south of the border??
6657800,Eckohlt,2022-05-20 13:55:00,3685,Pretty much the same I would say for 2 flats here in mn.
6657806,walleyecheek,2022-05-20 14:13:00,2231,approx. $120 US thats not bad at all !
6658144,reddemon2,2022-05-21 18:04:00,255,I hope you mean your buying in Canada
6658326,maddogg,2022-05-22 10:31:00,178,Yes by saying up I meant Canada.
6658340,glncanada99,2022-05-22 10:57:00,13,Good luck finding out a size of the flat. I have asked the people at Rainey Lake Sports several times. All they will tell me is that the nightcrawler flats are cardboard and fit in a standard cooler.
6658382,Eckohlt,2022-05-22 14:36:00,3685,"The people at Rainey lakes are right they put flats of crawlers in very small containers,so yup they fit in coolers,I always bring up a Omaha steak cooler half full of worm bedding in it and just dump them in that,with ice jugs works great."
6658646,pan-man,2022-05-23 19:52:00,299,I just bought a flat from Rainy Lake Sports this weekend and there was 500 and cost was about $65 US.
6658720,Clairebear,2022-05-24 05:27:00,937,Here in Ontario my buddy buys a case containing 50 dozen in 50 containers and we split it. Cost this year was $90 Canadian
6658730,lassh,2022-05-24 05:54:00,553,Where does he buy them?
6657372,maddogg,2022-05-19 08:27:00,178,"I'm planing on picking up a 1/2 a flat on my way up.I would like to know how these are packaged, because I need to know how much cooler space I need."
6657388,Eckohlt,2022-05-19 09:02:00,3685,Dog call the place your getting them n ask how much cooler space you need.
6657406,gmattbruin,2022-05-19 10:05:00,174,"Hey Maddog, heres a suggestion on what we do with our flats of worms. 1st, our drive is all within Ontario, buts its a 14hr drive with an overnight at base camp before fly in. A full flat here for us is 1000s worms in a styrofoam box in soil and bedding. Instead of keeping them in a cooler. we freeze thin ice packs in the coolers and lay them inside the box on top of newspaper. Newspaper is 1 of the best insulators going to keep stuff cool and even frozen. We will swap out the ice paks periodically. We are fortunate at our camp to have an outside icehouse to keep the box on all week. If its warm, we will still keep swapping out the ice paks all week. NOTHING worse than a box of worms that goes bad!! I think the bears can smell that from 2mil away....LOL"
6657408,Eckohlt,2022-05-19 10:15:00,3685,I probably take of the crawlers better than I do my wife lol
6657410,Carnhzkr,2022-05-19 10:37:00,964,I'll be the first to correct your worm count. A flat is closer to 500 crawlers (about 40 doz).
6657412,walleyecheek,2022-05-19 10:47:00,2231,I think he meant 2 flats &#x1f923;
6657414,Carnhzkr,2022-05-19 10:48:00,964,"As mentioned earlier, you really need to call the bait shop where you're buying the half flat, because different bait stores package half flats differently. Crawlers are delivered to the shops in flat coolers (hence the term ""flat"") that are open on top. Upon request, some shops, but not all, will manually divide a full flat into half flats. I've gotten halves in a plastic bag and in a box. Just depends."
6657464,maddogg,2022-05-19 14:52:00,178,Thanks guys I'm emailing right now.
6657788,gmattbruin,2022-05-20 13:31:00,174,"Well, not really sure what to say here to be honest. We buy our worms in 1 Flat which consists of 1000s worms. Weve bought half flats before which are obviously 500.Id say its safe to chalk up the difference to our locations. Either way, worms come in styrofaom flats. Btw, when we get ours they come with lids as well.So different areas, regions, different ways to sell worms.I was just offering up how we manage them over the course of our week and it has worked out for us for 20yrs or moreCheers!!"
6657790,walleyecheek,2022-05-20 13:34:00,2231,If you dont mind me asking ! What do you pay for a flat (1000) in Canadian of course !
