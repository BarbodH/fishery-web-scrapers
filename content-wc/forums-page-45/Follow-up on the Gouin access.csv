For the chemin de Senneterre, the road is flooded in several places! For the secondary roads it is not much better! In short, do not try to come here soon! As for the water level, it rises every day but still it is about one meter from the maximum level. There is no normal level on the Gouin, because what is normal is that it varies this is the very nature of multi-annual reservoirs!! But it is already higher than in 2021!"
