Unfortunately, when you book a trip months in advance you have to roll with the punches. I can’t remember having a perfect trip and this one won’t be either. I’m sure we will find fish somewhere. Dodging debris will likely be a challenge.Thank you!"
6658464,That Minnesota guy,2022-05-22 19:27:00,8293,The key with debris is to ALWAYS have that life jacket on when under power. You might not see it but it's there.
6658512,tv4fish,2022-05-23 06:52:00,2694,"Having experienced high water levels up on Lac Seul on more than one trip over the years - it is especially treacherous when you are boating in heavy wind and wave action - I would strongly suggest that you have one person up in the bow watching out for any floating logs that you may hit. And, as has been said - if you can, SLOW down and be safe."
6658582,lassh,2022-05-23 16:04:00,553,How long should it probably take for the floating debris to settle out in Lake of the Woods and Lac Seul?
6658586,That Minnesota guy,2022-05-23 16:09:00,8293,Thats hard to say as all the water hasn't entered the systems yet. It will be well into July and maybe August before water gets back towards normal. Plus if it rains............
6658608,lassh,2022-05-23 18:05:00,553,Yikes!
6658726,KPKyllo,2022-05-24 05:35:00,3010,"My wife and I were up at LOTW on 5/22 fishing along the Canadian border on the US side. Yes, the water is higher than normal but the water clarity was good where we were at and although surface temp was only in the mid to upper 40's by the end of the day, fish were hitting cranks on snap weights trolled at about 2 mph or so. We were trolling in 25 feet of water or so (where we marked fish) and got several walleyes with some slots mixed in, a few saugers and 6 northerns or so in about 5 hours of fishing. They all just inhaled our cranks. We used a variety of colors and models of cranks and we marked alot of fish. We tried bottom bouncers and spinners too for a while but couldn't get anything to go on them and went back to cranks. We saw a number of anglers jigging but didn't see any fish caught. The fish we cleaned appeared to all be post spawn. For our first time out on the lake this season, I thought fishing was pretty good and typical for this time of year."
6658738,Bill Krejca,2022-05-24 06:26:00,6107,"High water reminds me of the huge amount of rain which came down in, I believe it was 1951. As a lad, family was staying at the camp at Turtle Portage, LOW, the water just poured through the usually small creek-like flowage between Sabaskong and Whitefish Bay,(this was before the channel was dug up the lake a bit) boats just powered right through it, fishing was terrific right from shore. It seemed like it rained every day. The evening before we left for home, there was a loud noise in the evening, the noise coming from the north. The next day, boating back to Vic and Dot's where the car was parked, we discovered that the beaver dam at the creek called Turtle River (called by some) had broken from the amount of water it had held back. Days earlier, we had visited the gigantic dam, boating directly up to it, it being a monumental construction job, to this day the highest I have ever seen. Anyway, the entire south end of Whitefish for perhaps several miles, was covered by thousands of pieces of floating sticks. It took some maneuvering trying to get though the mass of sticks and small logs. So much stuff happens when the amount of water increases too quickly. Bill"
6658036,Hook_settr,2022-05-21 10:59:00,127,"I’m headed to LOTW out of Morson the first week of June and I have never experienced the high lake levels like they will be fighting for the foreseeable future. This has left me with several questions like how will this effect the fishing for walleye, pike, smallmouth and perch/crappie? Is the high water level good for the spawn of any species? I’m inclined to think it would give the fry more places to hide? I assume floating debris will be a hazard like Pooch mentioned in a previous post? Anything else I should be aware of? I’m aware of the importance of “no wake” around developed shore lines. Thanks!Hook_settr"
6658040,That Minnesota guy,2022-05-21 11:07:00,8293,Slow will be the word. Not only will you have a bunch of floating debris but rocks that use to be visible will now be under water. The amount of water pouring into that watershed right now is amazing. It's been raining again here this morning in International Falls....guess where that water flows to?
6658044,Yellowfin123,2022-05-21 12:03:00,2182,"yea i agree things will be slower.. on the lakes down here for example that i would imagine flood more than the lakes up north, the fishing is thrown off.. 1 lake is at the top of flood pool today and rose 7 ft, and that will scatter the fish everywhere but walleye are still on traditional main lake points today.. with all the water i'm reading about up north when you get to sabaskong bay i would think the fish will be scatterd all over the place and the normal spots where you would hunt for most species will be the opposite of normal... it takes a full month down here to get things back to normal.. when you leave mylies bay or the next one south where government dock is and happen to hang a right?, beware there are some shoals sticking outa the water about 3 feet in oct, today they might be 6inches underwater who knows and alot of debris.. the obabikon area is good area for all species and if your lookin for a musky"
6658204,Hook_settr,2022-05-22 04:54:00,127,"Ya, it's going to take a long time for all that water to pass through the dam at Kenora. Thanks for the response."
6658212,Hook_settr,2022-05-22 05:05:00,127,"Ya, when the lakes here in IA fill up like that they are usually giant bowls of chocolate milk and fishing is extremely tough unless fishing for catfish and carp. I am familiar with the shoals you speak of but we usually head W/NW out of Mylie's bay. Either way, being alert is going to be key when making a run. The narrows at Obabikon should be easier to navigate with all the water. I know Obabikon is good for pike, crappie and musky but I have never fished walleye in there. Is that worth an anglers time or just stick to LOTW for walleye? Seems like it's been a cool spring up there and the high water will make it tough. I'm taking my nephew on his first Canada fishing trip so I was hoping for good fishing so that he would be hooked. Might have to switch the focus to the experience and appreciating where you are, which is what the focus should be anyway. Thanks for you thoughts. Hook_settr"

Regardless, I have been up there a handful of times so I have a general idea of what's going on (most certainly not an expert) but I will talk to Justin when I get to Mylie's and get the latest info.

6658236,LOWrider,2022-05-22 06:11:00,40,"I've been just south of Morson for a week getting ready for the season and doing what I can to manage the high water. Here is what I can tell you about our area. Water levels are just reaching the 2014 levels and will surpass that this week according to LWCB. The big front that came through Thursday-Friday brought NW wind that blew in waves enough to splash over shorelines and loaded them up with debris. There is debris everywhere in the water. Everything from small branches to garbage to logs. Going to need some luck to get through the summer with out some dents and dings in the boat. Take it slow. Water temps were 52 on Wednesday and dropped to 48 yesterday after the front. Fished an hour and a half yesterday in shallow water and saw 0 Walleyes and one 3 lb Smallmouth. I think the Smallmouth are pretty active, there are a couple feeding on the schools of minnows that seem to be seeking out the warmest water under the dock. Heard second hand from someone fishing the Minnesota side they were catching Walleyes that still hadn't spawned out, so going to try deeper water today and see if that changes things. Hope that helps."
6658264,Bill Krejca,2022-05-22 07:05:00,6107,"Thinking back over the years re"" LOW high waters - I recall not having as good of walleye fishing during high water times, although did experience some great spring time shallow crappie fishing in places which normally were dry. There are so many factors which play a part during high water. The narrows into Obabikon should be easier to go through, there are some great walleye spots in there, again they may be difficult to find, look for the deeper holes. Bill"
6658318,Old Timer,2022-05-22 10:27:00,255,"I remember fishing LOTW in June 2014. For us the fishing was tough. There was a lot of debris in the lake which was worrisome for travel. And the walleye pattern was unpredictable. Sure, the fish were somewhere, but not enough time in a trip to stay on top of them. My guess was the bait and, especially the minnows, were scattered in flooded timber and brush with the walleyes somewhere behind. I have friends who know LOTW well and will be fishing there in mid-June. I'll rely on their intel before deciding if and when to fish that lake. From what I read it may take a couple months for many Canadian lakes to return to their normal high-water marks. A fall trip may be the better bet. And maybe the docks will be dry too."
