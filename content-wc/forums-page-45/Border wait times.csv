6657598,Carnhzkr,2022-05-20 06:48:00,964,"For the past 10 or so trips, I make the 9.5 hour drive to IF on Friday and cross at around 5 - 6 PM. We stay at either the Super 8 or Copper River Inn at FF. Our crossing at that time has never been much of an issue, and even if it is, I've got plenty of time to spare. I could keep going another 2.5 hours to Dryden, but there's no need since I don't need to get to our camp near Ear Falls until 2ish on Sat, so time isn't an issue. Saturday is an easy breakfast at the hotel, Subway at Dryden, then on to camp. The trip home is another story. On the road at 4 or 5 AM and don't stop until I hit the driveway. As mentioned, I'd do anything to avoid both 502 and 105 after dusk or at dawn."
6657796,That Minnesota guy,2022-05-20 13:41:00,8293,At 2 o'clock today there were approx. 75 vehicles lined up from the toll bridge pay booth out to Hwy 11 east. Of those I would guess less than 40% had a boat or trailer. Lots of cars and pick-ups. I would guess many are checking properties they may own in Canada. As I warned in a previous post go slow through International Falls. There were some real shoddy road repairs from when they did the repaving last year. You will hit places that if you hit it at 30 mph your trailer will leave the ground. I don't care how big & heavy the boat is. The South bound lane is much better. Enjoy you trip to Canada.

6657820,walleyecheek,2022-05-20 15:29:00,2231,"Yeah Megadeth isn't bad, but i prefer Slayer &#x1f923;&#x1f923;&#x1f923; and if you believe that I've got a bridge for sale that crosses from INTERNATIONAL falls to Fort Francis Ontario &#x1f914;"
6658156,SterlingArcher,2022-05-21 19:06:00,92,"We always go to Dryden (or sometimes Sioux Lookout) on the first day of the trip, then set out early for Savant Lake. It's really nice to have that night in a comfortable bed and break up the long drive. Plus, this way if the border crossing goes slowly it doesn't really affect anything."
6658372,Mojo-NC,2022-05-22 13:49:00,1929,"We always fly up on Friday and usually arrive INL around 12:30 PM. We pick up our rental vehicle, get our groceries for the week, stop at the duty-free store, and cross over the border around mid-afternoon We've never really had to wait very long, at least not going from the US into Canada on any of our trips. We usually go either late May / early June or September. We return the following Friday and we have run into delays of 1+ hour or more crossing from Canada to US around mid-day. Last fall we flew into Minneapolis and we decided to drive to Baudette and cross over into Canada there due to horror stories I had heard of 8+ hour delays at INL that I read about on this forum. We didn't wait behind a single vehicle at The Baudette crossing. We came back through INL and there was not a wait at all going from Canada into US."
6657442,fergiefish,2022-05-19 13:29:00,197,We will be going to Canada through International Falls at the end of June. Debating whether to go on a Friday and stay in Dryden and take a leisurely drive to camp in Ear Falls on Saturday. My other choice is to get up early on that Saturday and go straight through to Ear Falls. I would appreciate any feedback on crews going through International Falls on both Friday and Saturday to gage which day would be better to get through the border. Thanks in advance.

6657454,walleyecheek,2022-05-19 14:30:00,2231,45 min. IFalls ? Seems a a little excessive for a Thursday afternoon. They must have their fine tooth comb out &#x1f914;
6657466,Ricky Spanish,2022-05-19 15:15:00,1298,"I've usually crossed at o'dark thirty on Sat morning, but this year we'll be crossing on Mon late afternoon/evening 6/20 due to Father's Day. Anyone know what it's like heading across at Fort Frances on a weeknight?"
6657470,walleyecheek,2022-05-19 15:19:00,2231,It's not bad at Midnight !
6657472,Ricky Spanish,2022-05-19 15:42:00,1298,I better be dreaming of walleye by midnight. Hoping to make it through 502 before twilight when the big brown horny ones come out to play.

6657476,walleyecheek,2022-05-19 16:08:00,2231,If you do ! Make sure your playing that Carrie Underwood song &#x1f602;
6657478,That Minnesota guy,2022-05-19 16:43:00,8293,On a Monday it will be normal traveling. Just workers and trucks going back & forth. Most of the tourist travel is Friday & Saturday.
6657552,rather-be-fishin,2022-05-19 23:34:00,429,"If you get to Int'l Falls around 9:00 AM on a Friday or Saturday, there is normally minimal wait time to cross into Canada. If you get there from 11:00am & after on a Saturday, the line could be long. RBF"
