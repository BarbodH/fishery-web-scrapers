6658740,eyecatcher1,2022-05-24 06:31:00,323,"There's no place to stop on 502, so relieve yourself in Fort Francis."
6658748,bus33,2022-05-24 07:47:00,289,I like the 502....very scenic but makes sure you are fueled up....no place to gas up.
6658758,NM_Trout,2022-05-24 08:28:00,1094,"It is a beautiful drive. We've seen all sorts of wildlife, saw wolves 2x, moose, even helped a 30lb snapping turtle off the road :-) Much like all the other roads up there, use extra caution for animals, especially at night."
6658796,Terwalleye,2022-05-24 10:43:00,166,"We've been heading north of Vermilion Bay for almost 15 years, We've 502 and 71 each about 50% of the time. We think the 20 minutes you save on 502 aren't worth it. No Shoulders. The brush isn't clear cut back hardly at all; if at all. 71 has shoulders and is cleared back a good 50 feet from the shoulder. Better visibility for those furry criteers popping out. Plus with it being cleared more and it snaking through LOTW; I think you see much more water and scenery. AND you can get gas or pee if needed."
6658870,Eckohlt,2022-05-24 15:12:00,3685,"Your right,if you want to look at trees on both sides of the road then 502 is the one,I take the 502 but I find it very boring after doing it a few hundred times."
6658884,NARDA 1,2022-05-24 16:03:00,636,"We took the 502 for about 25 years or so, then started taking the 71. The 71 is a nicer route because you can stop at several places for a bathroom or just to stretch your legs. It's worth the extra 20 min."
6659052,bigwalleye1,2022-05-25 08:34:00,2632,I have bought that's what all the pulp check pullovers were for ..
6658214,Ranger319,2022-05-22 05:16:00,166,"For those of you up there already, any reports on the condition of 502? Will be heading up to Sioux Lookout in a few weeks and curious what route to take."
6658230,Eckohlt,2022-05-22 06:06:00,3685,502 should be in great shape just keep it under 100 mph.
6658322,btyreprich,2022-05-22 10:28:00,1067,You'll get run over on that highway if you go under - say 90 mph!
6658386,Eckohlt,2022-05-22 14:38:00,3685,Right on!
6658424,SterlingArcher,2022-05-22 16:59:00,92,"Seriously? I always drive the actual speed limit or maybe just a hair above because I love the wilderness, and I rarely get passed by anyone."
6658566,kim n indiana,2022-05-23 11:45:00,62,is 502 gravel or paved ?
6658568,Eckohlt,2022-05-23 11:53:00,3685,Paved
6658590,Bill Krejca,2022-05-23 16:14:00,6107,"Be aware that in many places the shoulder is non existent, not my favorite road to travel, I prefer to go around, altho can maybe save 20 miles by taking 502. Bill"
6658596,kim n indiana,2022-05-23 17:31:00,62,"never been up that way. this yr will be my first time. So just trying to glean info so I can make an intelligent decision when July rolls around. On map it shows as a lighter shade than what 71 does, so i'm surmising that its quality was not as good."
6658598,Eckohlt,2022-05-23 17:41:00,3685,502 is a good road go for it.watch out for road warriors on the 502.
