Is there any chance of the Wabigoon River dropping enough to open 105 between now and then? I'm sure my outfitter would pick us up in his plane at Kenora, but I'm sure that'll cost me."
6658534,NM_Trout,2022-05-23 08:59:00,1094,"My outfitter posted this :""HI All We have had some high water problems on highway 105 to Red Lake. The contractors have been very good about fixing the washouts. Unfortunately the highway between Vermillion Bay and Red Lake Road is still flooded so you cannot go north on Highway 105 from Vermillion Bay. It is therefore necessary to take a small detour. Only 11 miles in total length When you get to Vermillion Bay do not take Highway 105. Go west to Highway 647 heading to the Blue Lake provincial park. Take highway 647 north until you reach the Vermillion Bay airport. On the right side of the road you will see a small dirt road Quibell Road. Take this road, go slow it is just a narrow gravel road. When you reach Highway 609 turn right. Take your time you will actually cross a single lane Bailey bridge. Keep going until you reach highway 105 turn left and you are on your way to Red Lake"""
