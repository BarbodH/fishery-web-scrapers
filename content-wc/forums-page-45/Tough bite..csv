Not the most productive afternoon's fishing I've experienced, but better than being at work lol. No eggs or milt in any, done spawning it on this lake it would seem.VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/p4Icb_FOjKA"

6658652,Eyes_R_Us,2022-05-23 20:18:00,66,That was a great video. Thanks for sharing.
6658690,Limeyangler,2022-05-24 03:02:00,563,"The lake we were on is pretty deep, large sections in the 60' foot deep range, we were exploring lots then decided to hit the shallow creek area where we figured they'd be from the start, with near instant results. It's a lake I fish often on the ice but not often in the boat, always worth scouting the lake terrain' for new ice fishing spots when I get the opportunity."
6658692,Limeyangler,2022-05-24 03:04:00,563,"Lol the power of editing, we were in there for 4 hours, lots of exploring and running around, great afternoon, fishing was slow though."
6658694,Limeyangler,2022-05-24 03:06:00,563,"Thanks bud! Gonna get back to making and posting vids/ reports, used to post loads."
6658760,SweetD,2022-05-24 08:39:00,243,"Limey, everyone would enjoy more video posts. It really help carry us over to our trips…..its ALMOST as good as being there!!!!
