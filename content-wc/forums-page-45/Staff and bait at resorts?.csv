My owner provides live bait but has not answered about whether they will be available. In two states where I've lived lately, small business are having a very hard time filling positions. Is this going to be a problem with seasonable businesses? The owner is cooking, cleaning cabins, laundry and taking care of boats? I leave in a few days in the face of daily rain and temps in high 50s and low 60s. Normally, we call that walleye weather....but still sounds nasty. Mike"
