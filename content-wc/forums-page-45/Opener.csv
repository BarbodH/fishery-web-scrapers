Lots of travellers coming past my house on #105 So detour holding out.Crews working none stop to keep it in good shape.Few rough spots but guys getting through them with big boats.Dryer weather this week is greatly going to help the detour with end of week guys going home and new guys coming.That will be real busy.
6657670,prov1800,2022-05-20 08:31:00,5010,Hope all you guys coming to Canada this week have a great time.Weather is looking pretty good in our area so should be a enjoyable week.
6657678,That Minnesota guy,2022-05-20 08:41:00,8293,Pretty good stream of boats heading North yesterday already. Hopefully the flooding up there isn't as bad as whats happening on Rainy Lake right now.
6657698,prov1800,2022-05-20 09:11:00,5010,Saw some early travellers yesterday coming past my house on 105.Today detours are in rough shape again.couple bad spots again.Today will bring more travellers and detour will get worse.Our flooding on all lakes is bad.Docks are in roufh shape and hard to get to.
6657710,bus33,2022-05-20 09:28:00,289,Buddy made it to Ear Falls yesterday. He said the 105 detour is a little dicey. He said the border crossing at I.F. was easy with no issues.
6657716,walleyecheek,2022-05-20 09:38:00,2231,Buddy will probably be fishing in snow tomorrow morning &#x1f923;
6657730,bus33,2022-05-20 10:11:00,289,He sent me a pic of the snow this morning.
6657732,prov1800,2022-05-20 10:15:00,5010,Just wet here in VB but snow up in Earfalls right now
6657750,Skywagon,2022-05-20 11:07:00,1106,Picture I saw this morning north of Ear Falls.
6657756,nitroman,2022-05-20 11:13:00,368,Cedar lake today. Snowing and 36 degrees. Water at or over the docks. We will be heading up in 2 weeks so if you could clear the overflow and get the lake down a foot or 2 John that would be great!!
6657762,MikeAnkeny,2022-05-20 11:19:00,67,So too early to breakout the water skis?
