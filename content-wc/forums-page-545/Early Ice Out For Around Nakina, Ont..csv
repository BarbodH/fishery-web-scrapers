This would mean possibly some lakes may be ice-free by April 21. Nakina is about due east from the north part of Lake Nipigon. It seems like every year has a really different weather pattern, I wonder what the summer will bring. Bill Krejca"
1187471,TIGHTLINER,2010-04-08 18:18:00,223,Bill is this the drive in or the fly in around the nakina area?? How many years have you been going there and what is the fishing like in the spring? I know there are two that sound almost alike.. Thanks
1187642,Bill Krejca,2010-04-09 08:26:00,6107,"Tight, Referenced lodge is a drive-to. I guess this year will be my fifth year. I haven't fished the area in spring, we have been going in July. The fishing has always been good, but as I previously stated, the weather has been different each trip, odd combinations of warm, cool, rain, and dry, seems like much of Ontario (yeah, and Iowa, too) has been the same. This year appears to be starting out as a low water year in the north woods, less than normal amounts of snow to bring up the water levels. Hopefully some early spring rains will normalize the levels. Bill Krejca"
1187703,TIGHTLINER,2010-04-09 10:53:00,223,Thanks bill.. We have been going to nakina fishing out of timberidge 4 times in the last 10 years. The camp at keg lake is getting run down things do not work like they use to so we stopped going 2 years ago. If some money was spent to fix things up and make them like they were 10 years ago we would go back. We have always had good fishing at keg that is why we kept going back we ran into another group fishing van poole and they said nothing worked in the camp ran out of propane the first day the cooler did not work just to mention several. It is to bad one of the other outfitters in the area does not buy them and fix them up. The present owner is getting to the point he can not handle doing everything and just let everything go down hill. I had heard of this place where you go and everything i had heard was pretty good. Do you catch large / 40 in pike / and walleyes along with lake trout there? What price range does this come into for a weeks stay and are there any hidden costs?? Also do they have a web site?? Thanks
1187734,Mr Ranger,2010-04-09 12:10:00,272,"Hey Tightliner, dido to Bill's comments on OS. This will be my sixth trip up and cannot say enough about the camp owner and the fishing. Bob lives here in WI and is headed North in a few weeks. I know he ended up with openings the first week of the season due to early ice and is offering a darn good deal if you wanted to go this May. He has held his prices and camp is in great shape. As far as the fishing I have noticed that since Bill and his gang have been coming up the walley population has really gone down as those Iowa boys know how to catch walleye Just kidding about the population going down. Every year the fishing has gotten better. I cannot say we have gotten any real large Northern but we never fish for them. To busy with Walleye and Lake Trout. We go up the last full week of June every year."
