1185659,PIKEMAN330,2010-04-04 12:17:00,101,"When an outfitter charges for overweight, but is still under the legal weight ,it is not for safty but for more profit. This type of thing make drive- to camps look better and there are some where the fishing is just as good. Good fishing,Pikeman."
1185674,Golden Eagle,2010-04-04 13:14:00,2642,Flying service is probably charging the outfitter for extra weight and that cost is probably being passed on the the guests. Extra weight means extra fuel consumption.
1185920,cspierings,2010-04-05 08:38:00,230,"Being a pilot there a couple weight related points I may be able to add to this discussion. All aircraft have a max take off weight, exceed that and you are violating aviation regulation in any country I have been to. Does that mean you will crash, maybe, maybe not. Depends on a lot of factors clearly there is some room in that gross take off weight number but do you want to be the guy who figures out exactly where that room is exceeded? Each aircraft has a published weight and balance range. At a given gross weight with a specific amount of fuel in the tanks the aircraft has to stay within that center of gravity range or risk becoming less stable in pitch. Is there some room in those numbers, sure but again do you want to be the guy who gets to play test pilot and finds the point where the plane becomes unstable to the point of being uncontrollable? As you can guess there are usually aviation regs. which govern flying the plane outside its published weight and balance parameters. Having written the above you can see where knowing the weights of everything going into the plane is important. Have you also noticed that typical plane operators put the heavier gear and guys forward in the plane? That is to keep the planes center of gravity forward and make it easier to control in pitch. I am sure there is some additional fuel cost in carrying the extra load but in the distances typically flown for a fly in, at least the ones I have been on, I would think it would be difficult to quantify the additional fuel usage unless careful book keeping was done for a considerable amount of time. Have you noticed how at times they fly higher or lower going out or coming back? Next time look at the wind direction when you go on a fly out. They may fly lower into a head wind and a bit higher with a tailwind. THis may result in a fuel savings. I believe most of the figures and weighing are done to satisfy regulatory demands to ensure compliance which more than likely resulted from someone's demise. If that paperwork isn't done and available for inspection I imagine the penalties are quite steep and I shudder to think the penalties if an accident or incident occurred. Knowing the information above you can evaluate the over weight charges yourself. As to the comments about being able to stick anything you can get in the door in an Otter or Beaver or any other airplane or fill it with cinder blocks, those are simply testaments to the utility and reliability to the airplane in question. They have great track records but to ignore those published limits on an airplane's performance makes you a test pilot or test passenger if you like."
1185992,CobhamRiverLodge,2010-04-05 11:30:00,3,"I assure you the vast majority of lodge owners dont charge extra weight charges to make extra money. The reason lodges have this in their brochures is simply protection from the guests who will bring 200 lbs/person and expect it all to get to the dock at the outpost. As an example out of our outpost Hidden Lake we would have to charter an additional Cessna 185 at the cost of around $2,400 one way. You can see quickly how this can be pricy for the operator. In addition the guests would be angry that their gear didnt all arrive at once. After 35 years in this business we have found its much easier to use our ""back hauls"" to provide the frieght carrying capability for our guest beer and pop orders. This way it is waiting for you at the cabin and you dont have to worry about the 18lb case of Labbat in your gear. If you are worried about being over weight I suggest you look for an operator with this policy.In 35 years and 6 outposts later I can only remember one time that we had a huge overweight problem. The guests were all chefs and had everything you can imagine for their 7 day trip. However they knew going in they were going to be overweight so I chartered an otter instead of a beaver for the 4 of them, rather than charge XX/lb I just charged them the differnce in the charters. I feel this is the fair way to do it.Hope this helps."
1186137,phishfearme,2010-04-05 17:59:00,1242,hey cobhamriver and cspierings - good posts! henderson NV eh - do you know larry s from there also? can't be that many canada fishers from there. phish
1186240,CobhamRiverLodge,2010-04-05 21:52:00,3,"PhishNope I dont know Larry S. Just moved here from Iowa, sick of winter.After I posted I was thinking of some other funny things that have happend over the years at the Outposts. To date, the record is 52 cases of beer for 8 guys in a 7 day period. But to keep the thread on track, that would have been 118 lbs/person in beer. Ever since that group, every group that has been to the Lodge or outpost since who thought they were gonna be ""big drinkers"" tend to think twice when I tell them they need to have a pace of 23 beers/day/person to beat the current record.Happy Fishing"
1184687,SSA,2010-04-01 10:46:00,19,"The weights limits are for 2 reasons 1) safety reasons 2) to avoid a big fine from Transport Canada if they would happen to do a ramp check. Each airplane is configured differntly hence making it weigh differnt than the next for its empty weight, flight distance and fuel for the flight are also factors, if you want to talk legal. Most airservices can use a published weight by TC for each adult male at 187 pounds each. Which in Phish's cases, works to his best interest using the 187 avg weight. 170 + 270=440 divide by 2, 220. Other airservices will actually weigh the person (s) to find the true weight."
1185179,fishforlife,2010-04-02 21:25:00,77,"The Last 2 air services we used both weighed all passengers and all gear loaded on the plane, so they knew an exact flying weight of that plane (Otter). Having said this, I know they didn't weigh us on the way out, and when they were loading our gear we had a 2-gal. jug of cooking oil and 1-case of water $12.00 charged by the outfitter, and were refused to put on the plane because he said the plane was too full. They left it on the dock. BS !!!! I'm all for safety, but this was a blatant scam. Like Phish says, I told him about it and was the last he will see our business over $12,000 each year. Not the $ but principal."
1185303,SoulFulCry,2010-04-03 10:48:00,158,well the weights are on the otter n all the gear that was flown in of coarse when u are flyin out ur alot alot lighter casue of all the food n beer n other things that u took care of the week u was there etc there are 2 different type of otters actually 3 with different engine types that are flyin around 1 is the 600 hp straight the other is a 1000 style polish engine with a big 4 blade prop n the other is a turbine otter each plane has different gross weights that they can carry n that is by the fcc they get caught over there limits by transport canada n they are shut down n fineed so i applaud the pilot for makein his judgement call its his lively hood n his licence that is on the line not ur precious what ever ya have left over goodies
1185418,Golden Eagle,2010-04-03 17:46:00,2642,"SoulFulCry, I've been on flights with Kirsten when she flew light and left cargo behind. Floats were high in the water when she left the dock. She was putting it to the customers & camp owners, even before she REALLY put it to her competition and camp owners. Told my outfitter I'd never fly with her again when she flew light and left our only case of beer and only case of water at the dock. No excuse other than wanting to be a ....."
1185461,SinOrSwim,2010-04-03 19:53:00,1528,"Our outfitter weighs us all and then loads the remaining weight allowed in gear. Everything that goes on is weighed.We don't get charged extra but the rest of the gear/beer comes in on a later flight and sometimes the rest of the beer comes in a day or two later on a check flight. We just make sure our fishing gear goes out with us and the rest comes in later. Just make sure to pack everything you will need for fishing the first day in one area. Or, as my brother found out it might rain later in the day before the rest of our gear comes in and his rain gear was in a different bag/tote. LOL He looked really cold in the front of the boat!"
1185512,fishforlife,2010-04-03 23:37:00,77,"Soulful: Not looking for applause, my point is that it was the same ""Turbo Otter"" we flew in on minus the food we took in and pontoons were on top of water and nothing we brought out was weighed, so how is it justified? Like I said before, I'm all for safety, but this was so obvious to us I'll stick to my original post and tell you that he won't see our group again. Principal means something to us. ""OIL & WATER DON""T MIX"" LOL"
1185530,teddi,2010-04-04 04:54:00,349,maybe it was all the fish fillets you had coming out with you.
1185629,SoulFulCry,2010-04-04 09:24:00,158,well i apologize to u if that otter was a turbo otter casue they can carry some wheres around 300 to 3300 lbs and i didnt know about the other flyer either and if she left that to u to get back at some one for something is totally uinprofessional ill see to it that her name gets to allot of my freinds that fly out sry bout all ur luck with unprofessional pilots
1185636,SSA,2010-04-04 09:52:00,19,"Kirstens airplane was repo'd and sold, Golden Eagle, I dont think you'll have to worry about her flying your group in that situation again. Unless it was before she owned her own airplane?, that was a beech 18 you would have flown in."
1185651,Golden Eagle,2010-04-04 11:28:00,2642,"The Beach 18 was sitting high and dry when I left from the Chukuni by the bridge last October. I guess Sugar Daddy's $$$$ dried up. Too bad for him. Seemed like a pretty good guy.Never did see the box of beer or the water. Brett, and his pilot at the time, knew what to do with the beer."
1183413,LoDo,2010-03-29 11:01:00,721,Does anyone know the weight limit for the Otter sea / float plane?
1183447,38bill,2010-03-29 12:24:00,331,"Technically every plane is different because of their different configurations. Model of Otter, type of floats, seats or not, engine mods, etc all add or subtract from the payload. Best to ask your flight service about their Otter."
1183448,JAY221,2010-03-29 12:29:00,877,"According to the web about 8,000 lbs max takeoff weight. Empty the plane weighs about 4450. Later, Jay"
1183509,LeeMB,2010-03-29 14:57:00,83,Talk to your flight service or outfitter. The weight you can take will depend on the airplane and distance to your camp (how much fuel pilot has on)
1184185,cranelake,2010-03-31 06:45:00,54,"Typically for an otter it is 75lbs per person from what I've experienced. So you really have to pack accordingly. A case of pop/beer is 18lbs f.y.i. The otter is one of the best planes to fly into a camp with IMO they do a great job carrying a big load,and flown nose down which is pretty cool."
1184256,Kruger,2010-03-31 09:14:00,259,Where we go it's 100lbs each. One time we had 8 fat guys and all our gear. I asked the pilot what he thought. He told me you could stuff an Otter with cinder blocks and it wouldn't be a problem.
1184273,Golden Eagle,2010-03-31 10:06:00,2642,"Fill a Beaver, fill an Otter and they'll fly. Norseman will haul a ton unless the temp is too hot. Norseman doesn't like sparse air."
1184285,Larry Mac,2010-03-31 10:33:00,530,"LoDo, I apologize, this is not an answer to your question but just a comment. We find it a challenge and exciting, planning to be as light as possible whether we are flying, portaging or driving to camp. It is truly amazing how little one needs for a week in the bush given your boat, motor, fuel and cabin are provided for. It took me several trips to realize this. We are able to pack our personal gear in one med duffel bag, one day pack (Ruck sack) and one very small tackle box (per person). Many times the tackle just goes into the Ruck sack or we share a box. We share a rod tube for our rods. We plan our menu very carefully and want for nothing. There are so many great resources out there with tips and tactics to pack light. We are constantly refining our lists. It is amazing how much needless duplication is done in a group (i.e. you do not need 6 first aid kits or 6 large flashlights). I have been a several canoe trips that require you to portage all your gear several times a day. You learn very fast what is important and what is not. The canoe guys who travel the bush have got it figured out. You have received many good answers from very experienced members and I wish you and yours well for the 2010 season.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1184599,phishfearme,2010-04-01 06:05:00,1242,"krug and cranelake - these weight limits are imposed by the outfitter to hopefully keep people from bringing in electric fillet knives with a car battery attached (ie: keep the weight down) or as a money making scheme. we've been charged $1US per pound over (for every ounce over!) with the outfitter saying it's a safety concern - that's just pure BS. if i weigh 170lbs and my partner weights 270lbs yet we're each permitted 100lbs - does the plane magically distinguish between body weight and gear weight?? the first time an outfitter charges us for ""overweight"" even though our total group's weight is well within the safe (legal) cargo weight limit of the plane - he gets told about it then that's the last he'll see of us. if you do a search on this site there's tons of discussions about this. our current outfitter states a 100 pound limit but that's just to keep the electric fillet knife/car battery people in line. the legal limit is what matters. phish"
1184652,Kruger,2010-04-01 08:35:00,259,We never have a problem because we do the American plan lodges. Just fishing gear and clothes. It does allow us to bring way too much tackle though. We always joke that we couldn't do houskeeping because a case of beer weighs 18 pound or so.
