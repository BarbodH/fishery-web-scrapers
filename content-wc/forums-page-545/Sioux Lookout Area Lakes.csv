1181144,IaDave,2010-03-23 15:10:00,476,I don't think you will need a guide at the time of year you are going- If the walleye fishing is like last year your grandkids will have a blast. If the lake is not low take a trip thru Abrams Chutes- The first time thru it is like a new amusement ride

By the way, our 2nd week to the cabin on Minnitake got cancelled. We should be there on June 26th this year. Got a 4th fisherman this year (2 cabins) See you in June.John"
1178286,wtw_fisherman,2010-03-15 13:46:00,13,"Hello all. I'm new to the Sioux Lookout area and am looking for a little help on what's available in the area. I go up in eary June. We have been fishing Lac Suel for the past 4 years, and am spoiled by it. We have fished Big Vermillion, and got spoiled on that lake too( great bass fishing). Is there boat access to Minnitaki and Abram? Any other lakes a guy should check out in the area? Taking grandchildern this year for first time in Canada. Thanks"
1178390,Jimmy Jig,2010-03-15 19:14:00,1905,"Do you want to rent a boat and motor??? Or, unload your boat??"
1178688,wtw_fisherman,2010-03-16 14:28:00,13,"Hello Jimmy Jig.I bring my own boat. 19' Lund. twin axle. I have seen some signs on the highway just west of Seoux Lookout. The gas station just west of town has helped me quit a bit with things, and some of the young fisherman I have run into art the station have helped too. My son and I stay at the Provincal campgrounds west of town. This year my grandson (10 years old) is coming).Thanks for any help"
1178716,IaDave,2010-03-16 15:55:00,476,There are a couple of public accesses on Abram and you just have to go thru Abrams chutes to get into Minnitaki. There are a number of camps on the east side of the road right near the park you stay at and I imagine they would let you put in there for a little bit of cash.
1179038,wtw_fisherman,2010-03-17 12:56:00,13,Hello IaDaveThanks for the info. Is there any special things to see on Minnitaki? I see there is a falls were the English river comes into the lake. It looks rather large. Is it worth the run to it for a sight seeing trip? Thanks
1179061,Jimmy Jig,2010-03-17 13:46:00,1905,There is a good boat ramp alittle west of the town of Sioux Lookout. The public ramp on Abrams is not a good one for a large boat. English River Falls is a walleye hot spot but it is closed to fishing until June 15th. Twin Bay is also a good walleye spot and it too is closed until June 15th. Both of these places will be hot from June 15th til around June 25th. English River Falls goes longer.......do you stay stay at Aarons Park???
1179369,wtw_fisherman,2010-03-18 12:19:00,13,"Hello Jimmy JigWe are coming up to Ojibway Park on June 11 and staying until June 19. We have a site reserved by the lake. I am bringing my daughter, and two grand children along this year with my son. There is a lot of things for my daughter and grandaughter to do at the park. My son, grandson and myself will do most of the fishing. Grandkids have never been to cabada(10 and 12 years old). My son has somewhat grown up in canada(about 20 trips). We have fished Lac Suel and Big Vermillion so far on three trips to the area and did very well. The adventure is part of the fishing expirience I like now days. Is the Falls a senic spot worth the run? I may not be able to get my grandson to leave canada once he goes fishing up there. Thanks"
1179622,Jimmy Jig,2010-03-19 07:58:00,1905,"wtw, its a large falls, its kind of a neat stop. If you go right up to the falls on the left side you can stand on the rocks and cast into the fast water. Sometimes you can get a fish on every cast....done stream can be good also, we anchored and fished that way...I used to fish Little Vermillion for trout, it has some very big ones in it, but the DNR closed the season on them and never opened it up again??? Loved that lake..I was there in 1954 with my Dad......camped on the rock at the mouth of Ament Bay Good Luck........We will be at Frog Rapids Camp on June 21st. JJ."
1180244,Guest,2010-03-21 08:52:00,0,"wtw Donnelly's Minnitaki Lodge - or most other camps - may let you launch your boat directly into Minnitaki (for a small fee), they are just south of the Park entrance, otherwise there are a couple of public launches in Sioux Lookout you can use (launch passes/fees apply there too). Strong word of caution though, Minnitaki/Abram Lakes are similar to Lac Seul in that there are countless rocks/reefs to watch for and can ruin your trip in a hurry. Minnitaki especially is a pretty big lake with awesome fishing for just about anything you want. I would also recommend a guide for a day or two if you are going out for the first time. A guide will give you a good tour of the lake and likely put you and your family on to some great fishing. There are a couple of 'falls' on Minnitaki to check out, how impressive will depend on how much water we get between now and then. The lakes are pretty low right now, but usually come up some with Spring runoff. Hope this helps."
1180664,wtw_fisherman,2010-03-22 12:49:00,13,"Hello JimmyJig and SL resThanks for the info you guys. I do think we will go to the falls for fun run(both grandkids,son and daughter). I have a map of the lake from Canadian Maps and I have a chip with the Lakes in it also. I take it very slow untill I have a safe route. I can save a route once I have it. I know all the rock piles are not on the maps. The water was very low last year on Lac Seul when we were up there. I saw rocks out of the water that I new we had run over the year before. The guide would be the best, but I have alot of money invested in the boat I have, and just don't want to leave it on shore. I will try to look up Donnelly's about the launch, most places down here charge to launch, so I'm OK with that. Again, thaks very much. maybe we will see each other up there."
