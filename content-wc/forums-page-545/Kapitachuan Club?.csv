My group and I are looking at options for '09 possibly and this outfitter came up. We currently have been going with Berthelot Lake Lodge and have had nothing but great times but the wanderlust is getting to some in the group. Does anyone have any information about this outfitter, conditions and fishing in late July, or the outpost on Lac Mesplet? If anyone has any questions about Berthelot I would be happy to answer them."

576041,bassface44,2008-07-14 21:11:00,96,"Andre, Did the article focus on the Kekak River area or the outpost on Lac Melchet? I would be interested to see the article regardless if it is French or English. Mon francais n'est pas mal. Or maybe it is. If anyone else has any experience in this area feel free to drop a line. If not for me, for anyone else looking for trips in Quebec. I'm leaving in less than a week to go to Lac aux Loutres (Otter Lake) with Berthelot Lake Lodge. I'll post a trip report on my return. Tight lines to all."
1043522,retire55,2008-07-18 11:01:00,1029,"I believe the article on Club Kapitachuan was written by Martin Ménard in Volume 15 Number 1 of the Spring 2007 issue of Aventure Chasse & Pêche (web site is http://www.aventure-chasse-peche.com/). Dan Robitaille was also on the trip. Although I have that issue of Aventure Chasse & Pêche, I don't have a scanner. You could either contact the magazine or the author of the article at [email protected] to obtain a copy of the article. The article reported on fishing the Mégiscane and Pascagama rivers as well as Lac Mesplet. The article reported on good quantity and quality of walleye. Apparently the half day trip from camp to Lac Mesplet is worth the trip by itself. Berthelot is associated with a new lodge near Lac Mesplet called St-Cyr Royal - see http://www.stcyrroyal.com/"
1047161,bartidge,2008-08-04 12:11:00,12,"I have fished there a number of times.Only in May, however.I haven't been back since Berthelot built their fly-in only lodge at the St. Cyr and put that area under exclusive lease... used to be that area was all open territory and it definitely has some great fishing too... Kapitachuan still has a massive area of exclusive territory of their own (Megiscaine/Pascagama/KekKek River drainages and lakes) but when St. Cyr was open for fishing to, the fishable area was massive... And everything was accessible by boat (though you better have a GPS and be on the lookout for unmarked rocks.)I believe their was protracted legal fight over the exclusivity of the St. Cyr territory and a number of the outfitters out of Senneterre weren't all that pleased with Berthelot's dealings...Fishing is solid at Kapitchuan - at least in the spring. Lot's of walleye and decent numbers of pike... including some big ones... When I first went there almost 20 years ago, a guy in our group got a 28lb. pike and numerous fish have been caught since in the 17-22lb. range in the group. I have also heard that the Pike fishing isn't what it once was... My father still goes there every year and they still get plenty of pike but any fish over 15 lbs. is becoming more and more of a rarity...There is some white water to traverse in the territory... I'm not sure how you will fair in late summer with low water... The outfitter does put 25HP motors on his boats for better control in the fast water and as a bonus to get around faster in the massive fishable territory... You will not be able to get up the Kekek that time of year... You can only do that in spring with high water... but Kekek upriver is a spawning bed primarily - unlikely you would find any fish up there that time of year."

1185776,Guest,2010-04-04 19:52:00,0,Kapitachuan Club still exists. Fishing is still very good. You can go on Facebook and search for their page: Kapitachuan Club page. There is all the information to contact them and photos from fishermen.
