1184537,kgeary,2010-03-31 20:59:00,88,"Yes it sure is. weather it is fishing, hockey, figure skating, swimming, even chess. (they both qualified for the national chess finals) But fishing is something that we really share together and something that I can teach and share with them for a long time."

1186617,slough boy,2010-04-06 19:11:00,1,"congrat Hayden and dad - rule #1 take the kids and clients where the fish are. that is exactly what you did with my two groups last year. Angler Kingdom & its proprieter rocks. If you want to have the opportunity to catch a fish of a life time,. AK and Kevin Geary are the ticket on Nungesser Lake."
1187294,kgeary,2010-04-08 10:50:00,88,"Well Slough boy great to hear from you. And such kind words, making me blush. Seriously though I do appreciate it. We do our best, it doesn't always run perfectly but we keep improving. one thing is certain , I definitely want all of my guests to catch the fish they come for. It shows, with most of our guests catching the largest Pike or Walleye of their lives. I enjoy watching guest catch big fish and especially kids. It really can be a defining moment in their lives starting them on a path that can bring a lifetime of happiness. (Hope I'm not getting too heavy here) but you know what I mean. I've been guiding and teaching people to fish literally since I was 9 years old and I've enjoyed every minute of it. Now I'm enjoying watching Hyaden and Seanna and waiting to see what paths they choose. If they follow mine I just hope they don't plan on getting rich because this isn't the path to riches but definitely to a good life. hey I haulded 1000 gals of gas to camp yesterday. everyone in town thinks I'm crazy but it needed to get done and I've been doing that stuff for more than a few years. I took some photos and video will get it posted asap I'm still saying april 25 for ice out."
