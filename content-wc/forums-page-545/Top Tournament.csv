1186219,Topwater,2010-04-05 20:43:00,484,I think the best bang for your buck would Be the Anglers Cup on Lesser Slave and the Vanity Cup would be the Top or must win tourney as your calling them. Vanity has a waiting list but you should'nt have a problem getting into the Anglers cup. Do your research and you'll see that there is some big differences in Payouts in the Sask and Alberta tournies. In Alberta we have tournies that will payout up to 110 percent cash and some that might payout 70 percent with ****ty prizes instead of cash. Don't discount the ones with lower payouts though because they've got some big fish and can be a blast to fish.
