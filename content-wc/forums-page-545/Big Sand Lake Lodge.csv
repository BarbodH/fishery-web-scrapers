This has always paid off for me no matter where I have gone, good luck!!"

1160293,sptrix,2010-01-14 18:55:00,175,"I haven't fished this lake, but I've fished in the area several times. I took a look at the Manitoba Master Angler list and it looks like you should expect good pike fishing for fish into the mid-40 inch class.Walleyes that far north typically don't get much bigger than 29"". There are a few listed at 28""+ from this lake. However, the untold story will likely be the hundreds of 22""-27"" fish you catch if it's anything like the lakes I've fished up that way.Most of our success has come using simple tactics for the walleyes. Tons of fish are caught on 1/4 oz jigs with 4"" twisters, shads, etc. The larger profile plastics seem to be more effective. We've also killed them on Rapala F9s and similar crankbaits.I'd expect a lot of rock and sand, and somewhat limited vegetation, but I cannot say that with absolute confidence. Most of the big pike we've found have been in areas where we find smaller walleyes.Let us know how the trip goes. Would love to hear a report when you return.SPTRIX"
