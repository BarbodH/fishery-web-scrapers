We are looking at Camp Narrows on Rainy Lake - if anyone knows anything about this camp and the fishing in the area, we would appreciate any information. If you don't want to post on here, you can email me at [email protected] -- Thanks, JackSalmon"

I know that they are in a very good part of Rainy for smallmouth and walleye fishing. I think you will do fine if you pick Camp Narrows for your 2011 destination."

Plenty of great locations to fish that are close by, close by my definition.You boat in about 7 miles. We've only traveled as far east as Woodchuck Island, also about 7 miles. This year I plan on exploring the Ash Bay / Alexandria Bay areas a little more. Maybe about 10 miles from camp. Plenty of bays and islands to get out of the wind if needed. Go and enjoy.NimstugNever put ketchup on a hot dog."
