1187361,nitroman,2010-04-08 13:26:00,368,Does anyone have it and have you used it. Thinking about upgrading my PDV2 to the Ipilot but want to make sure it's really worth the $400 bones. I have auto pilot now and relly enjoy it and i like the idea of the advanced AP with cruise control and the spot lock thing really looks cool too! Not so sure about not having a foot pedal anymore but i imagine you would become accustomed to it.

Go ahead and get one to fully take advantage of technology you already have paid for!Oh yeah,I'm pretty sure that the Foot pedal will continue to work with this unit!!I'll check the manual and report if I am wrong about this."
