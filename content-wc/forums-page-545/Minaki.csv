Usually we go the 3rd week of July but I have been there Early June as well. Where to go and what to use depends on water temp and levels which vary every year. Last year was strange but still excellant! Usually, the Big Sand troll is later in the year when the cisco's rise to the surface in the evening and the gamefish follow. We never really had much luck after dark. I find the last 2 hours of daylight to be the best however there was one year that had a full moon and a Northern Lights display like I have never seen and that night we came back out and fished from midnight to dawn and were never able to sit down because there was always a fish on one of the boards. pm me if you like."
