1187189,Northtwin,2010-04-08 07:08:00,175,Has anyone fished the Dude Island area of Rainy lk. It is near the Bears Pass bridge. I have the opportunity to stay in that area and am wondering what the fishing is like. Is it walleyes and smallies? Any lakers in the area? Any info would be appreciated

1187363,Northtwin,2010-04-08 13:30:00,175,I will be there mid July. I would guess the walleyes are out on humps or points
1187612,cast_and_blast,2010-04-09 07:16:00,1098,"Yep - deeper water and hit the reefs. Plenty of them in the area that you'll bee, shouldn't need to put on 10 miles to get to the fish. Scott"
1187639,Northtwin,2010-04-09 08:25:00,175,Are there lakers in that area? How long of a boat ride from the landing?
1187661,cast_and_blast,2010-04-09 08:51:00,1098,"Not sure of lakers - I would guess that they would be super deep (like 90' +) at that time of year. YOu should need to go more than 5-10 minutes from the landing to have a great selection of reefs to hit. There is a LOT of area to hit, so you could sure explore further than that too. Scott"
1187942,Rayburn36,2010-04-09 21:03:00,17,No lakers in the lake. Mid july hit the reefs from 14 to 30 ft pending on temp. last year they were still up in the 8 ft range in july. If you find some reefs with weeds on them try move up to around the 5 to 10 ft .
