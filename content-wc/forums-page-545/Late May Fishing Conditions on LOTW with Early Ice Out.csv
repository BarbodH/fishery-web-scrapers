1186431,alanb,2010-04-06 11:28:00,56,"Since the concern is discussion on this board is slow, let me ask a question that hopefully should get some activity and help out a fairly new Canada fisherman. This will be my fifth year going to Lake of the Woods in May with my father-in-law's group, primarily for walleye. The last four have started on opening weekend, but this year we will be on the lake from 5/21 until 5/25 (one week later) due to family commitments. We fish exclusively north of Miles Bay due to our cabin location (typical range area between Smokehouse Island to the south, Horseshoe Island to the west and Thompson Creek to the north). My experiences thus far have been: 2006 - didn't know jacks**t what I was doing, sat in a boat trolling the whole time and didn't catch much 2007 - decided to educate myself (thanks to this message board), went with crawlers, had spinner rigs, jigs and bottom bouncers. Ice out was a few days later than average but weather and water were warm and fish were very active and found in 10 - 14' of water. Great success with crawlers and minnows and all presentations. It helped a lot that my wife's cousin and his friend that live in the Twin Cities were on the trip this year to add to my education. 2008 - Ice out was only a few days before the opener and very cold water. Crawlers ineffective. Minnows worked with very slow presentation on jigs. 2009 - Ice out was a week before the opener and very cold and windy. Similar to worse fishing as 2008. Each year I've tried to find new spots in this range, and now have a good map from the Canadamapsales.com website to use for this area. From what I've found from message boards and watching the ice out conditions in Minnesota, I would agree that the ice out for Lake of the Woods could be as early as next week (April 14). Assuming the warmer than average weather keeps occurring this month and into May; my question is should I expect fishing conditions to be similar as in 2007 (which I suspect are typical of early June in an ""average"" year), or will patterns be similar to mid-June conditions for an ""average"" year? If patterns are similar to mid-June conditions, what changes from early June, what should I expect and what presentations work best? Am I missing out on potential good spots to try fishing that are just outside of my normal range? Any/all thoughts, suggestions and input is greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance. Alanb"
1186512,Obabikon,2010-04-06 14:25:00,2370,"Alan... The North side of Miles Bay and Horse Shoe island are fantastic areas to fish from opener to November every year. There's some great spots near by. While I would anticipate the fish still being on beaches... that might not be true. They could already have moved towards humps and then you're looking at verticle jigging with a minnow. When I pick you up, I'll let you know the walleye pattern to that point."
1186791,alanb,2010-04-07 08:40:00,56,"Jared - Thanks for the help when we get there. I'm just thinking ahead that if this early ice out continues, what exactly can be expected? It could be outside my knowledge and experience base that I have and don't want to be unprepared. I am just trying to gather some knowledge from the experts on this board. We have two new people to our group this year. Both have experience fishing - but never in Canada. I want to be able to show them some good fishing. But to be honest, I think they will become regulars each year. We had great success with vertical jigging and a minnow on the south edge of Smokehouse, all around Horseshoe and around the mouth of Bottle Bay back in 2007 when the weather was very warm. I am going into this trip expecting this to be true again. Maybe I need to find a few new humps to try this year. When you heading up north? I'll send you a separate message about our trip. But plan on having minnows on hand for us! See you soon. Alan"
1186810,Aaron-IN,2010-04-07 09:25:00,500,I wouldn't be as concerned about an early vs. late ice out as I would about the weather conditions that ensue after ice out. Just sayin.
1186828,Obabikon,2010-04-07 10:15:00,2370,"I agree with Aaron. While you can bank on the walleyes being at a different stage than last year... the current weather patterns will have more to do with how active. Either way... I would be on verticle jigging being the best bet. Different humps and depths. But, I'm not as wise as the walleyes. They suprise me all the time with what they're doing."
1186924,alanb,2010-04-07 14:45:00,56,"I agree on the current weather being important on activity at that particular moment. But if the ice is out on 4/14, then even if the temperatures stay cool until the end of May (around 50 F during the day and above freezing at night), the water will be warming to a point that the spawn will occur before the opener. Jared clarified what I should have been asking - what might be the expected stage for the walleye with an early ice out? For most of my trips listed below, I would classify the stage as post-spawn into pre-spring. Except for last year which was pre-spawn. Then I should consider 2007 as a spring stage of patterns/activity. Maybe I answered my own question with your guys help. Thanks, Alan BTW, I just looked at the MODIS satellite shot (aqua view) and there is a HUGE crack across the ice on Big Traverse Bay that wasn't there yesterday!"

1187335,scotttheguide,2010-04-08 12:38:00,73,"The walleye fishing on LOTW is going to be outstanding this year. There was hardly any pressure last fall on the Walleyes. By the middle of September allot of the resort had minimal guests if any in camp. There was no pressure on the big fish. We were catching walleyes off the dock in the evening after dinner on slip bobbers and a minnows and enjoying a couple of cold beverages with no worries.If you have not fished LOTW lately, then you have no idea of what you are missing. If you ever wanted to fish it this it would be the year. There are allot of cabins open and great deals to be had from Morson to Kenora.The early ice out and light snow melt will change the water level so the fish will move to different locations. My advice would be 2 things:A.) Start on some deep humps and if you get allot of small fish, the big ones have moved shallower around sandy areas that have some boulders and maybe a some early or old vegitation. B.) Hire a guide. Why wait all winter long for your trip to come and then spend a day or 2 trying to find good fish. There are allot of good guides on LOTW. Even professional anglers use guides on new or large bodies of water to learn structure elements and fish patterns. Its not a pride thing that you had to hire a guide, its a tool available to you to help maximize your fishing vacation this year and in the years to come. If you really want to see what LOTW is capable of producing you should hire a guide for atleast half your trip. You will gain so much more knowledge and be on the fish. You will still catch allot of fish without a guide but the quality of fish will be different.PM me for additional information on some LOTW fishing questions or if you are looking for a guide on LOTW in Sioux Narrows, Kenora area. I imagine Obabikon can ""hook"" you up with some guides in the Nestor Falls, Morsonarea.Good luck to everyone this season from fishermen to Lodge owners.Come fish Canada this year, there are great deals to be had all season long."
