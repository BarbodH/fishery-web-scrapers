1155352,Guest,2009-12-20 19:16:00,0,"Very interesting about the ""boat rental checklist"". We've been signing off on that for a couple trips..... Thanks."
1155381,Obabikon,2009-12-21 05:35:00,2370,"Gord is correct on this one. If our guests had to take a boater safty course to come up, there would've been **** to pay. There attempt is to target people who come up for extended stays, not the average 4-5 day tourist."
1186603,Bluff,2010-04-06 18:38:00,152,"For what it is worth I took the courses for both Wisconsin and Minnesota - it took a heck of a lot longer than I ever thought it would. Hours! For just renting a 14-foot Lund with a 9.9 you have to study and get tested on jet skis, channel markers, lights, first aid, PFD's, boat types and a lot more for boats 65-foot and less in length. I guess it is a good all around overview of boating regs - just a lot more than I anticipated. Glad I did it and got it done - it will probably be mandatory for everyone sooner than later."
1186606,JayM5209,2010-04-06 18:51:00,1050,"Bluff, I agree with your sentiments. Last week I did the Wisconsin course and test - the on-line version. Yes, it was more than I need since I'll never be running a PWC or boating in the Intracostal Waterway. But, all in all, it was an informative and worthwhile effort. The advantage of the on-line course is doing it on your own schedule and at your own pace and without leaving home. I'm assuming other states, when they require a boating safety course, will operate like Ontario and recognize a card from one's home state."
1186642,chevtow,2010-04-06 20:02:00,691,"My wife and I took the course-- boring, I only went to 1 class then showed up for the test, got 2 wrong! Our insurance company gives us a discount for passing the course."
1186724,Kevin R,2010-04-07 06:24:00,305,That is way more involved than just a safety course & they will not honor a Coast Guard License are you sure about that ?
1186748,Obabikon,2010-04-07 07:14:00,2370,From what I've heard... they will honor just about any type of boater safty course. That said... in no way shape or form do you need to have a boater safty card if you are spending less than a month straight on the water. This is not directed towards people's fishing trips. It's directed towards Canadians and tourists who spend large amounts of consecutive days on the water.
1153225,LIKEWALLEYE,2009-12-09 17:10:00,70,"I was reading a mn, paper and i seen as of sept 15th 2009 all boat operators need a boat saftey certificate to operate in canada . Also stated no grandfathering will be honered. I also read that the canadian coast guard will reconize minnesota boat saftey certificates as legal in canada. All i did was sent the dnr a email requesting the handbook and test packet. Responded right away. [email protected]"
1153246,Nimstug,2009-12-09 18:58:00,2605,"If your boat is in Canada for a certain number of consecutive days, which is either 45 or 60, you will need to meet the Canadian requirements. I'm only there for a week so I don't pay strict attention. If you are not there that many consecutive days, meeting the requirements of your state will be acceptable.

1153315,Guest,2009-12-10 07:30:00,0,"If you rent a boat, you will need to take the test for sure. Go to www.safeboaters.com. Also, I have a US Coast Guard 6 pack license; Canada will not honor that in leiu of the test."
1153321,v-bay gord,2009-12-10 08:05:00,3168,"No, you are wrong. There is no ""test"" required to rent a boat. You will need to read and sign a boater's safety checklist which the lodge will be able to issue. There is no cost, there is no test."
1153469,fisherman 1,2009-12-10 17:47:00,39,Gord is correct!
1153775,Bluff,2009-12-12 10:24:00,152,"Our group has been told by our outfitter that we have to take the test and become certified. This seemed to be a gray area as to whether or not a boat at an outpost is ""rented"". The outfitter, Rusty Meyers, is not offering a boaters ""check list"" - we asked. It seems if an outfitter wanted to they could use a safety checklist - it mat be a liability issue(?)."
1153809,biggamefisher,2009-12-12 16:38:00,540,"If so, he is doing this on his own accord, can't see why as there is no liability issue. According to the legislation, renters are only required to take part in the boater checklist with the lodge, sign it, and be off."
1153827,fishncamp,2009-12-12 18:18:00,49,As Gord said....the lodge owners that I know have a checklist that you understand and sign. No test and no costs.
1153855,Guest,2009-12-12 20:29:00,0,"I don't want to disagree....but this is what I saw, talked to our lodge about, and called about..... Looks to me like if you rent, you need to do this.....but utimately your call... Operator Competency Requirements The Competency of Operators of Pleasure Craft Regulations require that all operators of pleasure craft fitted with a motor have proof of competency and proof of age on board at all times. The Regulations are being phased in as follows: All operators born after April 1, 1983 are required to have proof of competency since 1999. As of September 15, 2002, all operators of craft of less than 4 m (13'1"") in length, including personal watercraft, will be required to have proof of competency. As of September 15, 2009, all operators will be required to have proof of competency. How the Regulations Apply to Non-Residents The Regulations apply to non-residents: If they operate their pleasure craft in Canadian waters for more than 45 consecutive days or, If they operate a pleasure craft that is licensed or registered in Canada (including rented or chartered boats). The Regulations do not apply to non-residents who operate their pleasure craft in Canadian waters for less than 45 consecutive days. Please note that a proof of residence will be required on board at all times."
1153885,v-bay gord,2009-12-13 06:56:00,3168,"From the Transport Canada website: ""What is ""Proof of operator competency?"" Proof of operator competency can take one of three forms: 1). A Pleasure Craft Operator Card 2). Proof of having sucessfully completed a boating safety course in Canada prior to April 1, 1990 OR 3). A completed rental boat safety checklist. The boater checklist is not a new thing. The regulation has applied to younger people for 4 or 5 years now. We have been issueing these checklists for those years already. These checklists are available to all resort owners through NOTO (our tourism association). If your lodge owner is unfamiliar with this, you can mention this to them. As I said before, the boaters checklist is all that is required to rent a boat. There is no cost. Your lodge owner should have them. If not, ask why not........"
