1185097,trapper_john,2010-04-02 15:15:00,83,I haven't tried it yet but intend to when we get to Wabbie. I was told to find a nice perchy spot and drop your anchor into the mud and weeds. Then back your motor and drag the anchor. This will stir up the mud and insects that the perch feed on. It' seems logical to me. I'm going to give it a try.
