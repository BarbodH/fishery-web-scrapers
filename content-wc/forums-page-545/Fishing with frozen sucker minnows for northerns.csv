574326,fourize,2008-05-27 06:55:00,287,"Does anyone know of a place that you can purchase frozen sucker minnows on-line, and have them shipped to your front door?"
574336,Guest,2008-05-27 11:54:00,0,where are you going joe. i leave this thursday for a trip to red lake and will be flying out on the 31 to birch lake for a week. and we are picking up siscos at red lake marina. kind of expensive but they work real well.
1186424,Guest,2010-04-06 11:15:00,0,"how big where the suckers,i have a couple in freezer, ones 10"" one is 13"" are they to big ive caught 4o""pike in the oakta creek never used frozen bait."
1186786,the bob,2010-04-07 08:27:00,2,We fish dead bait and I found circle hooks very effective as soon as they run you can set the hook and always hooks on jaw I think I miised 1 set out 20 strikes much better than tribble hooks the Bob
1187535,kgeary,2010-04-08 21:11:00,88,"In early spring Pike are keyed in on the spawning male walleye and soon after the suckers spawn. So YES suckers work very well. Pike are very attuned to eating dead fish especially in spring. In fact anytime of year Dead suckers will outfish live suckers for Pike ( but now walleye) whether suckers work better than artificials depends largely on the weather if its warm and sunny the big girls will warm up in the shallows and become much more active and aggressive. If you run into the dreaded cold front with a foot of snow like last may 14 you will want to switch to the dead suckers. Some people stick with the dead bait even when the weather is good. I prefer to chang it up one key is fish s l o w very slow Suicks, bobbie baits, shallow invaders all can be worked slowly overy and around the old dead reeds from last year. as for location thats a whole other subject. short answer YES dead suckers 8-12 inches should make up part of your big pike arsenal from ice out right thru June and even the entire summer. I have a bunch of articles on pike fishing on my website if you need something to pass the time until you head north. by the way the ice will be out in a few weeks so you can always come up early"

574194,Bill Krejca,2008-05-22 15:41:00,6107,"Big, frozen ciscoes, suckers, etc, fished dead bait under a bobber work so well for early pike that a resort owner in Sask. where I went had to urge fishermen(not me)to stop bringing in the huge pike they were consistently getting. This was a few years ago, before more sensible length limits were imposed. Yeah, they work very well!"
574208,AllenW,2008-05-22 16:19:00,11482,"One of the reasons I use a quick strike rig, seems to do less damage to the fish and a better chance of them surviving. Al"

574215,sanmatt,2008-05-22 18:33:00,11,"Smelt are only legal in Lake Superior tributaries. The reason smelt are banned in most of Ontario is that smelt are asexual...meaning that they are both male and female. A smelt can fertilize its own eggs, and the eggs remain viable(able to hatch) even after being frozen. Strange but true!!!!!!! We use frozen ciscos for big northern. Caught a 44 in, 25 lb last year. We also had a couple of 42's, a 40, a 39, and half a dozen over 30. Great fun to get the big ones on."

574273,joeman79,2008-05-24 10:55:00,417,Anybody know if they have any frozen bait at Red Lake Marina? The watching a bobber while having shore lunch sounds fun. 14 days and we will be in Red Lake getting picked up for a week of much needed REHAB!!!!
574276,Guest,2008-05-24 22:07:00,0,"We use frozen suckers all time when we go to Canada, we will buy them by the gallon here and freeze them before we go. No problem bringing them accross the border since there dead,"
574277,Guest,2008-05-25 05:55:00,0,"At our camp, one of the guides was from one of the Maritime Provinces and he'd bring frozen mackeral. The pike loved them. Another suggestion is to use a circle hook. If the fish devours the bait, the resulting hookset will be in the lip rather than the throat or gullet."
574155,Northpoint,2008-05-21 20:27:00,38,I was reading in one of the threads below about fishing with big frozen sucker minnows. I would very much appreciuate some thoughts on how well this works compared to throwing plugs and bucktails. In northern Minnesota I used to see some massive northerns taken on large live suckers under a big slips bobber.....but I never dreamed of fishing with dead frozen ones. thanks for the help!
574162,AllenW,2008-05-22 06:36:00,11482,"Dead for us has worked fine, in fact we used to use frozen smelt for walleyes a lot. I'd use a bobber and some sort of quick strike rig, we had good luck finding a bay with a weed line and deep water just off the weed line. If there's more than one of you try different depths and if you have a trolling motor use it to slowly move around, maybe drift if there's a little wind or just sit there, either will work. Always exciting to watch a bobber the size of a apple disappear under the water. :) With a quick strike rig you can usually set the hook right away, makes removing the hooks easier than if they get it half swallowed from running with it imho Al"
574163,Obabikon,2008-05-22 06:39:00,2370,"It also makes for a great show at shore lunch... throw one or two bobbers from the shore line... when one goes under, everyone's yelling and scrambling for the rod! Lots of fun."
574169,joeman79,2008-05-22 08:26:00,417,DO most of the bait shops up there carry frozen suckers and smelt?
574170,Guest,2008-05-22 08:50:00,0,"Some bait stores do, others don't. Phone ahead to find out. You can certainly get frozen smelt in Thunder Bay, but they're taking advantage of all the Superior tribs having big smelt runs. Many stores further northwest don't carry them. They do usually carry sucker minnows (living) almost everywhere, but they're often not available year-round. NWO Fishing Bum"
574171,phishfearme,2008-05-22 09:11:00,1242,aren't smelt illegal to use - frozen or live - in some parts of ontario? phish
574172,Guest,2008-05-22 09:17:00,0,Thanks for the idea.
574174,Mohleye,2008-05-22 09:28:00,368,"I think that's right, and I think what they sell is ciscoe rather than smelt, and I'm pretty sure you can't bring either of them across the border, frozen or not. You need to buy them in Canada."
574182,stumcfar,2008-05-22 13:51:00,451,"You can bring frozen ciscos, but not smelt."
574186,AllenW,2008-05-22 14:20:00,11482,">You can bring frozen ciscos, but not smelt. That's why I said we used to use smelt..:) If your going to use these in Canada, I'd contact the bait store your going to and ask them if they can round up a half dozen or so 12"" or larger suckers (depends on how many in your party) and see if they'll freeze them for you till you get there. You may have to send them a deposit, but at least you know you'll have them, and won't have to deal with bringing them over the border. I've seen many 30"" northerns hit 8-10"" baits, so we use 12"" or larger, less fish but usually bigger. Al"
