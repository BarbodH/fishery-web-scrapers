534917,Guest,2003-09-11 15:28:00,0,"Was up at Seperation on Sept. 4-8. The lake was dead, that is real dead. Fished walley pass,100 hole and caught zero walleye. All reports from the lake were the same. The river was a differnt story. Fished just below Kettle falls and pounded a hundred walleyes. We also fished the Logs and Lower Kettle with similar results. Fishing under the bridge was also excellent. Two of the guys in the campground never went past the bridge. The biggest walleye was 25 inches with 70% being over 20 inches. We had some big northern as well. Water levels are 4 feet low."

534977,Guest,2003-09-15 00:17:00,0,">GOOD LUCK STRANGER REPORT WHEN YOU GET BACK.ONLY BEEN ON THE >RIVER IN MAY/JUNE SORRY NO HELP ON THE FALL BITE. Just got back from Seperation on the 6th. Spent the majority of the time on the river and did very well at the first rapids, my spot, and kettle falls. We left a couple of anchors at my spot and Kettle falls. We went out on the lake and caught a few walleye, didn't hit the lake very hard. Had my mother up there for the first time, and just wanted to take her back to Fjord bay for a shore lunch. We also made some drifts under the bridge, both in the morning and evening, and did very well. We saw the same boat there every morning and evening, they didn't fish anywhere but there! I thought it was a shame to see that. So many beautiful area's, and they didn't get to enjoy it. I guess they wanted to eat dust from the logging trucks going overhead. Saw a lot of Halley's guide boats at the bridge also. Have a great trip! 6WALL"
535018,DaveIN,2003-09-16 15:31:00,191,I am probably the boat that you saw under the bridge all the time. We were catching a good number of large walleye and my wife was not feeling very well and did not feel up to going down river. John thought I was nuts for staying there.
535028,Guest,2003-09-17 09:09:00,0,"Hi Dave, I was with the guys in the red Lund from Duluth, MN. It is nice to to put a face on the those who post here. I hope your wife is feeling better. I'll be heading to KY in the first week in October for a business trip and then 3 days of bass fishing on Kentucky and Barkley Lakes. Keep those contractors honest. TGG"
535029,Guest,2003-09-17 09:37:00,0,"Hello DaveIN, It wasn't you I was referring to, it was a boat with 4 gentleman. I didn't notice them until the day or the day after you left. They were under the bridge every morning and evening, we didn't see them anywhere else. I even asked my father if we should offer to lead them to some other area's, but he figured with all the boats leaving down river, if they realy wanted to go, they would follow. They seemed to be catching fish all the time, so they must have been content with that. I prefer to get a couple in the live well, and then start exploring. Try to find some hot holes for the next day, but more to see the beautiful scenery, and to find a nice spot for shore lunch. I hope your wife is feeling better, and you had a safe trip back home. 6WALL PS I was the guy who offered to help you hook your boat trailer to your camper, then you showed me how to do it the smart way."
535035,DaveIN,2003-09-17 11:52:00,191,"Thanks for the replies, I remember both of you, it is nice to know some of the people that post on the board. SHOULD WE BE TALKING ABOUT SEPARATION ON THE BOARD, I WOULD HATE FOR IT TO GET CROWDED UP THERE. I think the group of four you are talking about was camped next to us the last day and half we were there. They did not catch any walleye the first day and I told them how to catch them under the bridge and that is probably why they stayed there. They had gone to Walleye Pass the first day and never got a bite. Wife got to feeling better shortly after we left Separation and we spent the first night in Duluth doing laundry. Went over to UP of Michigan and took 5 days getting home doing the tourist thing. We had never been across the bridge before. Would you believe that with all the water we saw that I kept my promise to my wife and never took the cover off the boat on the entire trip home. Since I was such a good boy, I get to go to Separation twice next year. Once with my son and 12 yearold grandson and again with my wife."
535048,Guest,2003-09-18 15:47:00,0,"Hi, Good to hear responses from Seperation Lake. I have not been up there in 20 YEARS ! We use to really nail them back in Fjord Bay, I imagine you are still dodging the boulders on the way from the launch. I'm sure Seperation Lodge is still there, anybody got a report on it, might drive up the old logging road next year. One question, where is Kettle Falls from the campground launch? Thanks, JJ"
