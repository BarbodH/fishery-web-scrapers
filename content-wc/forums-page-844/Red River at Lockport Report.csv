Absolutely fantastic Cat fishing! 4 guys, 2 days,200 cats, 3,200 pounds of junk yard cats. Can it get any better then that? biggest fish was 26 1/2 pounds. As Usual accomadations at Stu's on Cats on the Red make this trip the best! Shallow water=Floats, imagine catching 200 muskies on topwater baits? get the picture? thats what tieing into these cats in shallow water is like. a good way to end my cat fishing for the year, now I have to wait till next June for Lockport action."

They got all the footage they needed in 2 hours. Their action appeared to be heavier than the surronding boats, to the point where even I may try it next year. Have tried other stuff, but natural bait always works better for me. Congratulations on what sounds like a great trip. Just waiting to see if the greenbacks make it up."
