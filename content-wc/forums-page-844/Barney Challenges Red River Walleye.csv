534688,Guest,2003-08-28 13:28:00,0,"Oly, Chicklet is a regular. Barney turned Chicklet over to me since she has one more tooth than my girlfriend. The only thing I dont like about Chicklet is she cant whistle."
534690,Olyolson,2003-08-28 14:09:00,400,She's good at humming though.
534701,Guest,2003-08-29 08:34:00,0,"Oly, Its music to my ears when Chicklet starts Humming during the slow fishing times. The girl can Humm with the best of them. Barney ""The Master"" always focuses on fishing , as far as Barney is concerned Chicklet cant Humm a tune on the river."
534704,Olyolson,2003-08-29 09:40:00,400,That's apparently why the MASTER catches all those hum dingers. You know the old sayings... whistle while you work and hum while you fish.
534708,Guest,2003-08-29 14:25:00,0,Barney has just announced that he has room in his boat for one more WANNABELIKEBARNEY fisherman on the Red River in October. Barney is offering a special 50% discount for these days. His normal Guide fee is $1000 per day and you are guaranteed one Ten Pound+ Hog Walleye for each day fished. So for only $500 you can fish with the Master....thats $500 US Currency. You will also recieve a picture of you and the Master which of course Barney will be pleased to autograph for you. All interested parties include your email address with your response.
534757,Guest,2003-09-02 06:55:00,0,Would love to fish with the Master. Not sure that I could live up to his expectations but I will be happy to pay the $500 if he will take a check HEH HEH. How big a dip net does the Master use?
534763,Guest,2003-09-02 12:48:00,0,"Fished the Red for Walleye over labor day weekend (3 days). Caught lots of small Sauger and Bullheads and about 20 Walleye. Most walleye good eaters with the biggest being 7lbs. Had probably 10 around 20 to 22"". Should only get batter."
534834,Guest,2003-09-05 07:36:00,0,"Barney has stocked up on jigs, crankbaits and super power fiber line. He even bought a kingsize dipnet a heavy duty scale and a large enough anchor so the Hog Walleye cant drag his boat around.....Look out Red River Walleye Barney is coming."
535032,Guest,2003-09-17 10:04:00,0,Where is barney? When is he going fishing? Is he really 8 feet tall?
534670,timeout,2003-08-27 20:56:00,28,"topcat, if you were reading this board last year, you might remember the same sort of thing going on. Its just some people having fun getting ready for a probably much anticipated excursion. I replied strictly in jest, let them have their fun, and why not? An excursion to fish the Red for greenback or cats is a big deal to some people who don't have the same sort of resource in their back yard as we do. If you get too bent out of shape about it, try going down to 825 Manitoba ave. Have fun, I am sure Barney and BJ and baby bop will enjoy themselves even without you. (That is if the greenbacks cooperate)lol"
534672,Guest,2003-08-27 21:14:00,0,"Timeout, You are right. We love to fish Canada and the Red is always good to us even if the bite is off. But with Barney the bite is always good....after all he is the MASTER."
534677,Olyolson,2003-08-28 09:11:00,400,Is this the same Barney that considers his 6 Zebco 202's to be his arsenal?
534678,Guest,2003-08-28 09:31:00,0,"Olyolson, Barney thrives on Zebco 202 rod and reel sets. That is what makes him the Master. He doesent use high tech equipment when he catchs Hog Walleye. Give him an old 202 and a handfull of dead minnows and watch him make the water explode with the powerful battles of the elusive Hog Walleye. Barney is the ultimate sportsman, more should follow his example...for he is the MASTER."
534679,Olyolson,2003-08-28 10:00:00,400,Right on Warden. We need to get him out west on the Mighty Columbia and let him work his magic. I like the idea of the purple boat too. All he needs is a Minnesota Vikings decal on it to make it complete. How's the 'Master' at blade baiting? These big( I mean really BIG ) river walleyes like 'em.
534680,Guest,2003-08-28 10:19:00,0,"Oly, Barney the Master can do it all. In his last seminar he discussed Blade Baiting and said it was too easy to catch Hog Walleye Blade Baitng. You realize when you use a Zebco 202 you have to rely on a very deft touch when evaluating a bite and once the hook is set on a really big Hog Walleye it takes exceptional skill to land the fish without exhausting the fish and endangering its survival . The Master always practices catch and release....another reason Barney is the MASTER. By the way Oly the Master is putting together a ""Hog Walleye Catching"" video. If you are interested in a copy let me have your address and you will recieve an autographed copy from the MASTER."
534681,Olyolson,2003-08-28 11:06:00,400,We call Hog walleyes - Battlestar Hogacticas or Goodyears out here.
534683,Guest,2003-08-28 12:21:00,0,"Hey Warden, isn't Barney the same guy who refuses to use artificials of any kind? Hence his actual title of ""The Master Baiter""."
534684,Guest,2003-08-28 12:48:00,0,"roachrig, As you might imagine while Barney travels the world giving seminars on Walleye Fishing he has amassed a very large following of groupies. Most of these groupies are of the female persuasion and they put a tremendous amount of pressure on the Master to meet their every bidding. Therfore Barney is knee deep in beautiful women...so the Master doesent have to mess with artifical lures...if you get my drift. Long live the MASTER."
534686,Olyolson,2003-08-28 13:09:00,400,Is one of those groupies that gal they call chicklet... you know the gal with only one tooth?
534613,Guest,2003-08-25 10:15:00,0,World famous Walleye King Barney is going to the Red River at Selkirk in October to have his way with the Walleye. The reason that we are announcing this is we want to make sure all you fisherman have your room reservations made. There will be a lot of reporters from ESPN and other sports networks that will take over the Hotels and Motels in order to view and interview Barney so get your rooms early. Barney recently stated that he was going to focus on a new Manitoba Walleye record this year. He further stated that a 40 incher would fall.
534630,Guest,2003-08-25 21:17:00,0,"Does this Barney guy even exist or is he just a legend? Has anybody ever seen him catch a fish,let alone a Walleye? Could he even lift a 40"" Walleye let alone catch one? Does his elavator go all the way to the top?"
534631,timeout,2003-08-25 23:23:00,28,I am on holidays in oct. and am curious as to what kind of boat to look for. I'll be the one with the spotting scope out as I surely do wish to learn from the master.
534634,Guest,2003-08-26 05:22:00,0,You'll be able to catch hilites of Barney and his buds adventures on november airings of that show queer like folk.
534641,Mahumba,2003-08-26 08:26:00,345,You can recognize Barney as B.J. and Baby Bob will be in the boat with him. If you can't see him right away just listen for the song......I love youuuuuu Ha Ha Ha! Roger Mayer.
534647,Guest,2003-08-26 13:34:00,0,"Barney will be in the new ""LUND MASTER"" model. It is a custom boat built for Barney. It is to commemorate Barneys reign as ""Walleye Master 2002"". The boat is Purple and has a large Walleye and the title of Master written on each side. Just a note to you novice fisherman. Barney will stop fishing for one hour at 10:00AM and 3:00 PM every day while he is there and hand out auotgraphed pictures to all you WANNABELIKEBARNEY fisherman. Watch for the Purple Master Boat and get Barneys picture and some tips from the Master."
534662,Guest,2003-08-27 14:18:00,0,"Just wanted you to know, I'll be the guy in the Fisher laughing his #### off at some blowhard trying to tell us how to fish our own river! This is probably as close to happening as an ""Expert American"" showing us how to catch channel catfish. I live in East Selkirk & have fished the Red for about 30 yrs., my biggest greenback being 32.5 inches. If the ""Great Purple One"" pulls a 40"" out of his livewell (without bringing one with him), I'll eat my Fisher!!!"
534663,Guest,2003-08-27 14:29:00,0,"TOPCAT 3820.....Barney got a 33"" Walleye last year on the Red and he is poised for a BIG GIRL this year. Watch for the Purple Boat and get the Masters autographed picture....relax a little."
534668,Guest,2003-08-27 18:18:00,0,"Of course he did!!! And if I said my biggest was 34"", his would've been 35"". Whatever! Where can a commoner such as myself and the other peons read of the great one's list of fishing accomplishments, tournament wins, etc., or is he ""The Artist Previously Known as Prince""??? How does one get to be voted "" The Master"", and by whom? Let me know , I'm certainly in need of a good chuckle."
534669,Guest,2003-08-27 18:55:00,0,"Topcat 3820, You are a good chuckle!!! Barney caught a bigger fish than you and you puff up. Take a pill."
