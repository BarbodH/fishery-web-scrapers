534974,Guest,2003-09-14 18:17:00,0,I was out for the last 3 days for walleye and crappie on a houseboat. We caught our limits in good size walleyes in deep water off of points. Crappies were suspended in Miles out of 22 feet of water. Fished the crappies for 3 hours and caught 50. If you are looking for a place to stay in Morson ... try a houseboat with www.wildernesshouseboats.com. We had a great time and the houseboat helped us stay close to our fishing spot.
