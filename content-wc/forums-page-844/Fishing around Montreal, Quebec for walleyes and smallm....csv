So I went on St-Lawrence river, 10 min. from home right in the heart of Montreal. The fishs were very active. We caught around 20 walleyes and 7 smallies; all C&R. While fishing I was looking at the buildings in Montreal and was thinking how I was spoiled, being able to practice my favorite activity in my back-yard. Try those links if you want to see some fishs taken today.http://groups.msn.com/i654igeptevaij...oto&PhotoID=15http://groups.msn.com/i654igeptevaij...oto&PhotoID=14"
