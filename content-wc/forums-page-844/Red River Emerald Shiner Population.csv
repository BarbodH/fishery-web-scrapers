534986,Eye Catcher,2003-09-15 12:02:00,85,A few weeks back Stu McKay was talking about the emeral shiner population being way up. Is this still the case or have they disappeared. I am heading to Selkirk 10/10 and obviously hopeful of a good year for greenbacks. If not there is always the waterfowl. Good Luck to all!
