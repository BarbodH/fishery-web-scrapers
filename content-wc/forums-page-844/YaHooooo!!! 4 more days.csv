It is a very exciting time for me right now and I just had to let you all know about it! I can honestly say that I look forward to this trip more than anything else during the year. Going fishing with my Dad in beautifl Ontario, Canada. My Dad will be 73 in 4 weeks and this is our 7th year going up to Gowganda. We have made many memories and GREAT friends and plan on making many more. This is the only 2 weeks of the year that we get to fish for walleye. I don't post much on this site but I have gathered a boat load of info from you folks on how to catch this wonderful fish. It has been a GREAT help. We THANK YOU very much for that. I will definately post how we made out when we return Oct. 5th. THANK YOU and good fishing! Dave"
534992,Ivy,2003-09-15 15:29:00,556,I went with my Dad (74) about a month ago. It will be our last fishing trip together. Enjoy the trip! You never know when it will be your last fishing trip with your father. Ivy
535019,fourize,2003-09-16 16:47:00,287,"Thanks Ivy. We will enjoy every minute of our trip. You're right. You never know when it will be the last one. I see my Dad starting to age. He is starting to have problems with his hips. We have a 750 mile trip ahead of us this Friday and it looks like I will be doing all the driving. I don't care, that doesn't bother me. As long as my Dad is able to get around, I will take him every time. He just loves it up there. It's great to see a big smile on his face when he boats a big walleye or northern. It's priceless."

535024,Ivy,2003-09-17 07:39:00,556,"About 5 years ago I had been working and traveling a lot. I was away from home 2 days a week and getting a ton of wind-shield time. The kids were 2 and 4. I was working 70+ hours a week. I didn't mind it because it was exciting and I like my work. I didn't think about fishing or taking time for my family. I was wrapped up in the moment. One day my Dad called me and asked if he could ride along with me and go on the road with me. I asked him why in the heck would he want to do that? It's a boring ride and once I got to other plant office I would'nt have time for him. He said; "" Well we could at least talk in the car"". The next day I called an Outfitter and we took a Fly-out 2 weeks later. On the way up to Canada I didn't turn on the radio once. We just talked. We flew into a remote lake and we had a great time. We were the only people on the lake in late September. This year we found out that Dad has Stage 4 Lung Cancer. We didn't think we would be able to take this last trip to Canada but we managed to pull it off. Looking back I am so glad we have taken those trips. Enjoy the moment. You never know when the good time will end. Ivy"
