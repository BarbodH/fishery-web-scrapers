534988,jimbo,2003-09-15 12:13:00,223,Can anyone tell me where to get bait in Sask.? I am going up the 25th of Sept. Going from Minot ND to Yorkton to Nipawin. Thanks

535008,jimbo,2003-09-16 07:59:00,223,Yes I know the Vanity cup is the same time. I was looking for leeches and Ciscoes. Thanks for the help. Jimbo
