The boat launch behind the mill is good and operational, boat launch at the pump house should be avoided unless you have a tow rope and want to make a quick 10 bucks, thats $7.10 US. Water temp has been dropping about 4-5 degrees per week. It is raining here right now and we are supposed to get a good dump for the next day or so. The forcast as far as temp goes is 8 celcius at night rising to about 10 12 during the day till the weekend. This is cooler than it has been up till now it has actually been quite warm during the day Fish are being caught in the mill pond and just below the dam. You will have to work for them although a good percentage of them are green. I was out on monday we caught a dozen or so biggest 2-3 pound range, we got on the water about noon and were off by 3. Talked to a local today who spent a good part of tuesday at the dam and did not bad 20 fish largest 22"" with lots in the 15 - 18"" range. As far as the lake goes strippers and drum are plentiful my graph was loaded, was hopping some were walleye but did not catch one so couldn't say. (that was 2 weeks ago) Did not make it to the lake this week, going out sunday weather permitting. Hopefully water temp drops in the next few days, mid 50's would be nice. If not... I know where I can have some fun in town anyway."

535043,Guest,2003-09-18 06:38:00,0,"Slickster.... looking for some information, hopefully you can provide. Where is the section you refer to as the ""mill pond""? I have never fished from the mill launch toward the dam. Are the rapids navigable? or is there a boat decent launch closer to the dam if someone chose to fish at the dam? Thanks for the info....."
535044,Guest,2003-09-18 07:28:00,0,"The mill pond is acutally called manitou rapids. It is directly behind the mill. This is also known as the ""Burmuda Triangle"" Take your time trim up and watch your locator. Use the mill launch this year, the water is to low to use the others."
