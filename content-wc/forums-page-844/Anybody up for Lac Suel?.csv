Because it was a last minute decision to go none of my friends can go, normally I fish Lake Erie the last of October until the first part of December but this year the love of my life (my wife) is having surgery in early November so I probably will not be able to make it. The next best thing for me is Lac Suel! So for the second time this year of asking on Walleye Central ""if anybody wants to go to Lac Suel please send them my way"" Anybody? Mike Cerett"
