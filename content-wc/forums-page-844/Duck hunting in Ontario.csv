I have never hunted in Canada and am wondering what is needed for firearm registration options. I have heard of the PAL program, but I believe the courses are over. I would need to either declare a firearm at the border, or can you register in advance online? Is it a big hassle at the border? I could also borrow my father in laws gun already in Canada. Do you need any paperwork for that? Thanks!"

It is a .pdf file which has a description of the regulations and a form to fill out. You can send the form in, in advance, which may speed your border crossing. DS"
