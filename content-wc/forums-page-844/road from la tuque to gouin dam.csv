535026,McQ,2003-09-17 08:29:00,615,"The road from La Toque to the dam is fine for any type of vehicle. I'm a bit confused about the Lac du Male reference - it's at least 50 navigable miles to the west from the dam. There are excellent maps for the Gouin available at this website www.trak.qc.ca - laminated hydra charts and in two sections - Clova & Parent. Here's a heads up on the more popular spots geographically - starting from the western end. ( Clova ) Baie Adolphe opens into Lac du Male, south is Sarana bay and Mattawa and a few other smaller bays.. The reservoir pinches down west of Opitchiwan ( native village ) then opens to Marmette on the east, Baie du Nord on the south and Baie du Sud further down. From Marmette to the south is Chapman Baie and further east opens into Magnan with Galette on the southern extreme and Lac Brochu to the east. ( Parent ) Brochu will eventually open into Baie Kikendatch which leads to the dam. These are only a few of many hundreds of bays and lakes that make up the Gouin but are the main bodies that run from the west to east with the southern references being the legs of the Gouin. This reservoir is comprised of a series of bays and flooded over lake beds. If you can visualize a mushroom with many stems, the crown being the top ( north ) - then by following along the bottom edge the areas open to the south and all the bays. Adding interest to this body of water are the many islands that break up any straight run. The outfitter location is just not quite in the middle of the reservoir on the northern shore of Lac Broche and about 30-35 miles from the dam."

535037,McQ,2003-09-17 16:09:00,615,Glad I could help - this ones going to be like waiting for the birth - 9 months before you give us your report - You're in for the time of your life and it's nice for the outfitter to take the time for you - sounds like a real nice guy. You'll be about 15 or so miles from L'Oasis with a few islands in the way.
