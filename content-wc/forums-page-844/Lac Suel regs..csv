I looked in the Ontario Regulations booklet and could not find anything to support the ticket. Is this a regulation that is writing or just one of those unwriten rules. thanks jeffster"

535003,jeffster,2003-09-15 21:56:00,163,Thanks Kyle for your help on this. The picture sure makes it easyer then just someone telling you the reg's. thanks again jeffster
535006,eyewitness,2003-09-15 22:58:00,680,"It is in the regs. The regs are very clear, but they are broke out into different segments for Ontario, each having specific differences. It's kind of confusing to find stuff at first, but once you get used to how they lay out their booklet it gets easier to use. I almost made the same mistake the first time I went up there many years ago. A guy at the dock just about had a tizzie when I started pulling all these live walleyes out of my well and throwing them into a cooler. Didn't press mother luck again though as they don't give warnings..."

I took some of that stiff blue insulation board, and double-faced taped it to the inside walls of the livewell. I left chanels for the water to drain out. Now I fill it with ice in the morning and it keeps my soft drinks and fish cold and fresh and the ice lasts all day. Kill, cut out the throat and place head-down into the ice."
535017,Guest,2003-09-16 15:11:00,0,"Jeffster, This is definately a written rule. It is in the regulations! I believe this is an excellent rule, and you are going to see the same thing on many other waterbodies in Ontario soon, according to the MNR. Lac seul has many particular regulations, as it constitutes it's own district (with regard to fishing)."
