534910,Todd_NE,2003-09-11 12:34:00,1330,"One month from tomorrow us crazy ""you alls"" will leave for Manitoba. Camoflauge included Carlson! This will be my 8th year in a row going in October. I thought it was funny to see this in the paper though, Selkirk has $30,000 to spend on waterfront camera's but can't get their ramps in order. Makes perfect sense to me! The Mill in Pine Falls collects zero fees and keeps the ramp up for the public.http://www.bowesnet.com/selkirkjournal/Z03_Story_3.html This could be an interesting ""swing year"" for a lot of anglers going to the Red and Winnipeg for the fall Greenback run. Unless some things improve, I know many folks are considering taking a fall trip elsewhere, us included. I'd probably still come, but I lost guys for the trip this year because of a few years ""bad"" fishing. Perspective... I know some/few locals would like to see less US folks coming but if it happens the already hurting economies will take another hit up there which would be too bad. Issues: Perception of Netting hurting the fishery Low Water Poor Water/Ramp Access Difficulty getting Lodging Perception of being unwanted by some locals (I don't feel that way) Recent poor greenback runs in the prime times Higher Dollar More difficult border crossings Todd Yup, got her... oh yeah... feel that head shake!"
534911,Guest,2003-09-11 12:53:00,0,"Todd, I agree this could be a swing year. We have lost fisherman every year for the same reasons your group has. The only ones left in our group are the guys that would rather Walleye fish than anything else that October has to offer. If both our groups keep shrinking maybe we should combine forces next year. I will be back even if there is only one chance to catch Momma Walleye. Hope your group does great this year and we catch one more Walleye than you guys."
534912,Todd_NE,2003-09-11 13:53:00,1330,"Mike, Where you from, my bro and a few guys come up from Garden City and even Oklahoma/Colorado. I grew up in Smith Center. When is your trip again, maybe we can share info. You can catch all the numbers you want, I only want one fish every fall. This year I hope it has a ""5"" in it. :) Todd Yup, got her... oh yeah... feel that head shake!"
534930,Guest,2003-09-11 21:39:00,0,"Todd_NE, I live in Olathe Kansas (southeast part of KC). There are three of us coming the 5th of October for a week. We are staying at the End of Main. I think your group had the luck with the Flasher Jigs from Reel Bait last year. It made us buy some for this year so we alredy have shared info. When is your group going to be there and where are you staying? Thanks, Mike"
534945,Todd_NE,2003-09-12 07:55:00,1330,"My brother put on a dang clinic with those Walleye Flashers last year. He had a couple of 12's, some 11's, etc. Everyone did better on them but he was hottttt. I like trolling, but that wasn't as good later in our trip as it was the first few days. We were up a little later in the year, I think we were the last group at the Manitou for the greenback run, we fished through a lot of snow. Seemed like just hovering the Walleye Flashers was best, the fish, even the sows, bit really lite and didn't swim off at all. They'd just inhale and hold. He had some high quality 5' UL crappie rods in his boat and I'm bringing some this year, he could feel them but they couldn't feel him sorta thing. It made his fights a little more exciting! Plus that short rod didn't move the jig much when he did twitch it. We'll be at the Manitou in Pine Falls the 10-16th. I'm not sure if we'll fish the Red at all, especially with the ramp situation. All of us have pretty big boats and we all worry anyway about ramps. The Mill ramp at Pine is always tough but supposed to have been fixed now. Good luck, we have the grey Lund 2025 from KS, an Iowa Red/Black Fisher FX, a white Nebraska 19.5 YarCraft, and a black Neb Tundra. Email me if you want, maybe I can get a report from you before we come up or get together. I just hope it's a great year for everyone, it's my favorite place and favorite week of the year. Yup, got her... oh yeah... feel that head shake!"
534946,Cornhusker,2003-09-12 08:47:00,104,"Hey Todd, This is your Wc pal from Council Bluffs. We will also be up there oct 6-13th. I will have 19ft alumacraft tp in blue and beige. We also staying at the hotel that just got the addition built on. We also bought a bunch of flashers, so your sponsors should be proud of the job your doing. I actually think the ""dead sticking"" was more important last year than the jig type, but I like to try new things, so I loaded up on those flashers. Last year, on the calm days out there, we would just let our rods sit still in the rod holders, put on 2 minnows (seemed to be better) and then wait for a ""perch"" kind of bite. Everyone scored a 10 pounder that day, but not one was over 11. Hey, Mike from Kansas, it would be nice to meet you too. If all of our groups are shrinking, we might have to consider combining all together. You, me and todd are kind of all in a south to north row. Its been a pleasure reading your posts. Are you guys aware of the ""other"" message board that is specifically about Manitoba fishing? They usually have quite a bit more detail on the red\wnpg than walleye central. Todd, I really hope we can meet up this year, I looked for you at different boat shows that your dealerships were at, but no luck. I cant picture you in a tundra, after reading about your fisher's, I would love to see the boat. ""Winners never quit, quitters never win, and those who never win and never quit are idiots"""
534947,Guest,2003-09-12 09:01:00,0,"Todd_NE/Cornhusker, Looks like you guys will be there the week after us. Im sure there will be plenty of WC Posts after we all get home. Looking forward to seeing how you guys do. Thanks for the guidance on the ""Flashers"". If we dont catch any fish on them we will of course blame you guys. Its so hard to get anyone to take responsibility for there own decisions. Todd, maybe your brother would come up and fish with us the week before you go. He could show us his ""Flasher"" technique. Sounds like he is a great fisherman...probably runs in the family. Good Luck with the Big Girls, Mike"

534978,Backwater Eddy,2003-09-15 04:42:00,3871,"I would think all them dollars and loonies we all spend to access the ramps should be for the repair, at least in part, wouldn't you? I didn't see anything at the Selkirk Park gait that said ""Pay here, but be sure too bring a cement mixer and a load of rock if you wish to actually USE the ramps.""......did you? We will launch and or go elsewhere if need be, that is a certainty. Most of use whom repeatedly return to the lower Red stay where access is usable, well maintained, and handy. So that is not my personal fear really. If I were a local I would be even more rilled up about the ramps, because it is the local angler whom uses the park ramps the most, all year long. Are there any ""Sportsman's Clubs"" up there that ever get involved with such concerns, or do they all remain shrouded in anonymity like yourself, hoping others will chip in and fix it for them? If not, maybe there should be. Sportsman's Clubs often adopt an area here on the upper Red River and other regional Rivers, and jointly the Club will see it remains well maintained, for the benefit of all. That may be the answer your looking for? Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""Piggy's are my business, and business is good"" ><,sUMo,>"
534979,Guest,2003-09-15 07:01:00,0,"The bottom line is this, all the onus should be on the City of Selkirk to repair and maintain their ramps. If they charge a fee (in which they do) for using the facility, then they are obligated to maintain it! In this weeks Selkirk Journal, Selkirk's director of public works stated that the onus should be on the local guides and private business sector to foot the bill for repairs. Where's the rational behind this train of thought! I for one find it hard to believe that the Selkirk Chamber of Commerce isn't going ballistic on the city for allowing this facility to deteriorate in such a monor. But then again, ""that's Selkirk"" my home town and I guess it's plain to see that in all these years it's still a little one horse town after all! I'd like to know how much revenue's been generated by this facility over the past twenty years! It would be a safe bet that the total sum would far exceed the cost of ""ANY"" maintence requirements........ What about all the other economic spin-off's created from those using this facility. Bars & restaurants, motels, gas-bars etc. the list of revenue earners goes on and on. You would think that the business community would be taking this issue to city concil! Unfortunately to date they've been silent on this matter.....man talk about sitting on your brains.............! Fish ""HARD"" Forever! (If you can find a place to launch)"
534980,Todd_NE,2003-09-15 07:27:00,1330,"Manitboa Angler, Can we use your van and mixer? Bring some Kokanee and you probably would have 50 guys pitch in and do it. Stu, aren't you a local??? Ed, aren't you a local??? Heck, I thought I was, oh well. Todd_NE (I'm the non-local that can't catch fish but catches them all taking them away from ""locals"" - get it.) Yup, got her... oh yeah... feel that head shake!"
534982,Guest,2003-09-15 08:02:00,0,"Hey Todd, yes I most certainly am a local resident to this region. Selkirk is my hometown, although I haven't lived in it for more than thirty years now! This whole issue of the cities ""ONLY"" boat launching facilty is not a huge concern of mine. It doesn't directly effect me for I'm not reliant on it for accessing the Red. Indirectly I consider it an issue that I have to address, simply because any issue that pretains to this ""World Class"" fishery I make it my business! If the truth be told, it is up to those that used the facility and those businesses that depend on the facility to address this issue with the city. If the guy that owns the Darewood Motel in Selkirk is concerned about it, we haven't heard from him thus far. Maybe he doesn't realize the implications, I can't speak on his behalf. The same can be said for the tackle store proprietor in Selkirk. I know that if it were me, I'd be going ballistic! Once again, I cannot speak for them either. The bottom line is someone better pick up the slack and lobby the city to resolve this problem, soon! Fish ""HARD"" Forever!"
534983,Todd_NE,2003-09-15 08:56:00,1330,"Stu, I was sticking up for you I hope you thought.... ??? I actually did contact the Selkirk Journal and talked to Mark this past week, I encouraged him to give you a call. We had a wide-ranging discussion and he seemed generally interested. Like you and Ed say, the area is a ""Jewel"" and I hope people realize that. It's truly the best walleye fishery I've ever seen, sumo cats too. With proper fishing etiquette and release, sportsman shouldn't do damage to the fishery. I'm proud of all the years and big fish we've gotten up there, but prouder that only one sumo has ever been kept. It was the guys first walleye of his life (believe it or not) and was 14.5#. Can you say lucky? In Nebraska ""locals"" get mad if ""their"" pheasants are shot. In SD local get mad about people fishing the Missouri River System. In Montana people don't like having their elk or muleys shot... It's the same everywhere. However, most towns and chambers welcome the visiting sportsman because they realize how economically important it is to do so. I travel all over to fish and hunt and welcome people here. Isn't that also what outdoor pursuits are about, meeting new and great people? Bottomline, the only people that will be hurt if fisherman don't come to Selkirk are the locals who have businesses, provide jobs, and are a source for those $$$ to turn over 5-7 times as economic models have proven. I hope it's a great season! Todd Yup, got her... oh yeah... feel that head shake!"
534985,Guest,2003-09-15 10:39:00,0,"Todd, please no offense taken! I hope that I didn't come off as taking shots at you, this is certainly not the case. My only point is trying to convince or to motivate the locals into some sort of positive action. Action that will hold the ""powers that be"" responsible for their lack of action on repairing and maintaining the cities ramps. I fully agree on your comments about the value of our resources. Generally speaking all forms of natural resources are of great economic value. Fish, pheasants, deer, elk, moose whatever, they're all of great value and they're all worth the effort of proper management. In a nutshell, ""Selkirk's attitude is a joke""! It's a community that's always neglected to take advantage and promote this ""World Class"" venue! Some thing's never do change! Fish ""HARD"" Forever!"
534994,Guest,2003-09-15 16:01:00,0,"In my opinion the docks and ramps are fine...the water is just low. It Pi$$ me Off when I hear peeps talking about money spent like 30,000 on cameras and why aren't dooks fixed. According to the town they have spent monies two years ago on dock repairs. They have also been adding rock to fix the ramps so that with the current water situation it may solve the problem. The cameras were for the Waterfront which indeed deems the Cameras. I'm a local and apoligize for my first comments."
535040,Guest,2003-09-17 21:02:00,0,"Mike, I live in Leawood and have fished the Red & Pine Falls for the past 10-12 years. I've been in here in KS for the past 4 years. This year my group took a pass ( we just got back from a ND trip ) because of many of the reasons stated above. I 've seen the KS plates in the parking lot and wondered who else from down south was as crazy about walleye fishing as I was. Anyway, I would like to get your contact info for future reference. Send me an e-mail at [email protected]. Good luck this year, It'll be the first time I've worked the second week of October in over a decade. Jeff"
535045,Guest,2003-09-18 08:15:00,0,"Jeff, I tried sending you a email at [email protected] and got a reply that address did not exist. Let me know if I did something wrong ....email me at [email protected]"
534995,gms,2003-09-15 17:31:00,91,"Regardless - Low Water or Bad Docks..... if something is not done soon there will be a significant lost revenue opportunity not only for the Park but also the town of Selkirk. Even though I'm only from Winnipeg, I do make a point on the way home to make a pitstop at the local ""food stops"" not too mention the best bakery in Manitoba (ie. Upper Crust). Someone needs to wake up or everyone will soon be lined up at the Pine Falls Mill launch.....boy will that be a zoo! Anyways to my American friends.....see ya in a couple of weeks!"
534999,Guest,2003-09-15 21:00:00,0,Im one of those USA souls who love every inch of Canada that I have been lucky enough to climb off and on to a dock and into a boat for the last 49 years. I also have met many of the wonderful Canadian hosts who pride themselves in supplying fisherman with a venue that builds awesome memories about the beauty of the Canadian wilderness and its fishing abundance. I started going to the Selkirk area a few years ago and have never understood why this area isnt promoted more to the outdoorsman. Is there not a tourist bureau or an economic development group that is funded by the community in order to promote the world class fishing and hunting that this area holds? Communitys through out the world thrive by marketing themselves and their attractions to the masses of people looking for that unforgettable vacation. It is sad when those who could benifit the most do the least to build community pride and develop thier strenghts for the future of their children. I apologize if anyone thinks I have spoken out of turn but the Selkirk area is a diamond in the rough that needs to be polished.
534952,Todd_NE,2003-09-12 13:07:00,1330,"Curt/Mike, Sounds like we'll overlap a little, that'll be good. The 2nd big tourney is that weekend, it will be busy on the water for sure. I like the fishing manitoba site too, good info. Bummer on not finding me, we were at about every show, I think I worked 11 days last year. It never fails, the minute you walk off to a presentation or something that's the time someone was looking for you. On the Flashers, I'm glad you guys have some - I appreciate that you trusted me - but I wasn't trying to overtly promote Reelbait/Walleye Flasher, they are a great company and that jig was hot but I was asked directly what the hot lure was and I answered saying that jig and that they were a sponsor. We also caught some on their regular jigs and other brands, but resultz iz resultz. Someone accused me of promoting them then on that thread which wasn't fair, I stated that up front in my answer. I also mentioned ripstik's were a good lure last year (shallow) and I have no relationship to them. Mike, I agree with children of the corn, it was important to ""deadstick"" jigs, I think it was because the water temp was dropping so fast and the fronts were constant. To be honest, I caught a lot of fish just plain jigging and then having long pauses, but I wasn't hot for hogs last year. As to my brother, he is used to catching crappie in 35' of water in kansas on tiny jigs and I think he had a touch that was hard for anyone else to replicate. Those fish bit about like a 6"" crappie with 35' of mono out - it was tough. I honestly think what he was doing was letting the jig right on the bottom a lot and when that flasher came up that blade just spun a little and whammo! If you see me, I'll be trolling unless it's a total bust. My ""Canada"" lures don't get used anywhere else, even tourneys. They are that valuable and experienced :) I spoke with the Selkirk Journal this week about the low water, recently tough fishing, ramp situations, etc. I hope they do a nice job if they print something. I'm interested to see how the Selkirk city mgr can explain 30k in surveillance video's on the river but no $$ to keep the boat ramps working. Todd Yup, got her... oh yeah... feel that head shake!"
534960,Backwater Eddy,2003-09-13 04:24:00,3871,"Todd I agree, it is a bit crazy to spend $30,000 on a bunch of surveillance cameras when other more key elements of the local tourism are being neglected. If they don't get the park ramps up to shape they will soon get tired of watching gulls and pelicans on them new cameras, and very few boats. ;) Ah..and on product recommendations that you and others make....keep them coming...I for one appreciate the tips and feedback. Now...if we just can get you to fess-up to some of them notorious home brewed Las Vegas Show Girl color combo's you use on your cranks.......we would be all set to roll. :D Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""Piggy's are my business, and business is good"" ><,sUMo,>"
534964,Guest,2003-09-13 12:40:00,0,"Todd_NE, I think somebody misunderstood your intentions when discussing Flasher Jigs. It has always been exciting and rewarding for me to find product information on WC. The majority of posts on WC are fisherman trying to find new lakes and new ways to improve their fishing skills. The sharing of information makes us all better fisherman and is part of the comradity of fishing. Those who protest this sharing are probably selling something competitive and most certainly dont have any fishing buddys send them ""secret lures"" for Christmas. Todd, you keep up the good posts and keep helping us less fortunate fiherman...and those flashers better work!!!! Thanks, Mike GO HUSKERS"
