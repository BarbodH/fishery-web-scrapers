Cabins, fishing, facilities, staff, etc. Has anyone fished Trout Lake and how did you like it. Considering an early June trip. hopefully the larger pike will still be shallow. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you"

Several new cabins that are huge and well furnished. The staff will do anything and everything to make sure your trip is an enjoyable one. The fishing was tremendous earlier this year. If you want any pics of the cabins, boats, fish ect. let me know. You couldn't make a better choice. I highly reccomend Booi's Trout Lake Lodge. It won't get much better no matter how much you spend."
