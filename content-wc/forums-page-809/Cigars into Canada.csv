There are four of us who trip it up to Canada and we all bring our own hand rolled sticks. Sometimes they're bundled, sometimes they're in humidors but we always bring about a hundred, each. Last year our goods were x-rayed and the customs agent never said a peep about our smokes (or our liquor). If they had, how much duty would we have been responsible for?"
