540615,Atlanta Dave,2004-06-11 19:10:00,323,Alecs I will try to keep it below 1 1/2 rods per man . Just kidding we will only be using one legal rod. Thanks again for the info . Atlanta Dave
540578,Alces,2004-06-10 20:32:00,35,"Both outfitters have maps of the western side of the Gouin, I just mailed 40 to Tamarac this week. Depending where you will be staying the fishing might be different, if you are in the Saraanna Bay camps, walleye is the main attraction with some nice northern if you look for them, if you are in Mattawa Bay, Northern and walleye are about the same challenge, if you are at Baie Plamondon camp, northern and walleye are the two favorites in this order. Fishing just picked up this week when the walleye left the spawning immediate area and are starting to feed. Should be very good when you get there, in both outfitters places."
540544,Guest,2004-06-10 22:20:00,0,"McQ and Alces, Thank you both for your response's. We will be flying out of Clova, next week Sunday. Not sure what outpost camp that we have been assigned, the organizer of the trip did not state this. He did say that Tamarac did have maps of the area we will be fishing and they will be very helpful in leading us in the right direction of fish locations. He has used their services several times before for Fall hunting excursions and seems to be satisfied with the service. Justed wanted to see if there was something on the Internet that I could view before we arrive to get a feel for the territory. Thanks again, Tom"

540546,Atlanta Dave,2004-06-11 06:31:00,323,Alces What are the best pike and walleye as far as size you have heard of this spring? I may have asked you before can you fish more than one rod at a time. Atlanta Dave

To my knowledge, only the Gouin maps from Trak show the depth contours. Thanks in advance."

Atlanta Dave....hummmm!! as far as I know we saw a lot of 6# 7# 10# in the walleye category, a lot of 2# 3# 4# are caught daily for shore lunches. Saw a few 30"" 37"" northern so far but it is still early for northern as the are mostly still near the spawning are, northern pike spawn at 12 degree Celsius 50 Farh and the water is almost at that temperature as we speak at the Gouin. Should pick up as the water warms up."

539803,McQ,2004-05-21 14:36:00,615,"Will be heading out shortly for the Gouin Reservoir. Spending the opening 5 days at Nemio River Outfitters, should be a blast, the ice is just out and the ""Big"" Pike are waiting to test my new spinner baits. Won't forget to jig up a few Walleye too. Pics and story when I get back."

540503,Guest,2004-06-10 04:20:00,0,"McQ, Might you have any current reports from the Gouin? Going up next Saturday and flying in with Tamarac outfitters on Sunday morning for four days. Look forward to catching a few walleyes and some toothy critters. Also, I noticed on your MSN group site that you have listings for maps of lakes in Quebec. Would you possibly have one of the western area of the Gouin that Tamarac outfitters services? Look forward to your response. Thanks again, Tom"
540504,McQ,2004-06-10 05:03:00,615,"Hey Tom, maps for the Gouin are available from Trak Maps right here on the WC Directory - https://www.walleyecentral.com/phpyel...ne&textToFind= They are laminated and in great detail covering all the Gouin in two sections - west - Clova, East - Parent. You need the map for the Clova sector. Unfortunately the Gouin Reservoir is not in the package on my group site, your outfitter may have the maps available too or you can pick them up at most bait / tackle shops on the way up. Where are you flying in from?"
540513,Seanik,2004-06-10 08:02:00,218,"McQ We will be at La Pointe Aux Dores(Walleye Point)in August. What Gouin Reservior map do we need for this area, East or West? Thank you for your informative posts."
