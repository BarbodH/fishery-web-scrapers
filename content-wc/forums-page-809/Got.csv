540571,Guest,2004-06-11 18:23:00,0,"Just wanna let everybody know to ""read the rules"" ! Was fishing on Lake Minnitaki earlier this week and got pinched by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources for having LIVE fish in possession (3 walleyes and a northern). No problems with possession or size, just the fact that they were alive. It's an obscure rule which I think applies to Lac Seul along with a few other bodies of water. Once you decide to keep a fish ----- KILL IT. You will receive no warning, at least we didn't. $50 fine for the infraction and an extra $50 for EVERY fish !! My understanding is that the only live fish you can have is baitfish. And to think that I went out of my way to do a ""good deed"" and pick up an old propane tank laying on shore. Kharma must be dead. By the way, they let us keep the fish which I don't understand either. Most expensive meal I've ever eaten. Anybody know a good wine to go with fresh walleye? 5 Stroke"
