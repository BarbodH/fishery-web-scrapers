540477,Ivy,2004-06-09 11:33:00,556,I believe it's your Duty to drink Beer!!!! What was the question again? Ivy
540478,Guest,2004-06-09 11:40:00,0,I can drink watered down american beer any time. Labatts Blue has 5% alcohol content and is a much better tasting beer than a domestic. We have 14 guys that go every year and basically used to bring a Suburban full of beer. Now most of stop right after Baudette at the Liquor store and pay a little more for Labatts but we enjoy it more.
540483,retire55,2004-06-09 13:39:00,1029,"Based on information received from Automated Customs Information Service (ACIS) 24 bottles Bud Light bot in Canada at The Beer store or the LCBO ( $35 Cdn) If someone bot 35 cases Bud Light in Canada with Cdn $ the cost would be ($1,188 Cdn) Converting price for 35 cases Bud Light to USD @1.35 exchange rate ($880 USD) Its been posted that 24 bottles Bud Light bot in the USA costs ($14 USD) Then 35 cases Bud Light bot in the US with USD would cost ($490 USD) Border agents will convert the cost of the beer in USD to Cdn dollars ($662 Cdn) The duty on imported beer is approximately 100% (actually a little more) Therefore, the duty payable is ($662 Cdn) Converting the duty payable to USD ($490 USD) Consequently, total cost of 35 cases Bud light (purchased in US and imported into Canada) $980 USD Therefore, if a group of guys wanted to have 35 extra cases of beer over their duty free limit of one case per guy, it would be $100 USD cheaper to buy the 35 cases of Bud Light in Canada I personally have no axe to grind on this issue. Whether American fishermen buy their beer at home or buy it in Canada is of little import to me. However, if you're going to make the decision based on cost, then, at least, you should use numbers that are close to being accurate. This information can be verified by telephoning ACIS (204) 983-3500 or (506) 636-5064."
540501,Matches,2004-06-09 23:05:00,236,"WC, stop at the duty free store before going into Canada and buy your Labatts there. You'll save a ton!"
540616,Guest,2004-06-11 19:33:00,0,"I do not know where these figures come from. ""Border agents will convert the cost of the beer in USD to Cdn dollars ($662 Cdn) The duty on imported beer is approximately 100% (actually a little more) Therefore, the duty payable is ($662 Cdn) Converting the duty payable to USD ($490 USD)"" Duty on beer is about $6 US for a case. I have done this for years and it varies based on exchange rate, but it is around $6 per case. It is not 100 percent duty. I will also say that if you lined up 100 guys who claim to be beer drinkers, most would not be able to tell a Labatts blue from Canada, versus a Labatts blue from the US. Try a taste teste with your friends and see if they can tell. The most important thing is that a group of friends are in Canada celebrating a days fishing with a beer in hand telling lies. No matter where the beer came from, it does not get any better than that."
540629,Guest,2004-06-12 10:17:00,0,"American Beer is not watered down. Alcohol content in the US for beer is done by % by weight. In Canada and for most of the world, the content is % by volume. Alcolhol is lighter than water (Specific Gravity of 0.8). Therefore, if you convert most American beer alcohol content to % by volume, the American and Canadian beers come out about equal. In fact, many American beers are stronger than Canadian beers. A great web site has a page or two on this important international issue! www.Realbeer.com"
540633,Guest,2004-06-12 13:40:00,0,"Bought two cases at the duty free, was asked at the border how much alcohol I had I told them 2 cases. The agent then proceded to ask my plate number. I had no idea what it was. She then went and wrote it down and told me to go pay the duty on one case of beer(9 dollars canadian). After paying they told me to hand the receipt to the agent in the yard. They then proceded to search my whole vehicle(45 minutes). I kind of got a kick out of them wasting their time (two babes). I've been going to Canada twice a year for the past 20 years, usually with someone else and have never been searched. I've even crossed and informed them that I had 4 cases of beer and had no problems. Next time I'll do what I did when I was younger. Just tell them I have no alcohol."
540639,retire55,2004-06-12 17:48:00,1029,"Alces and interested others: The following was copied from http://www.realbeer.com/library/beer...ak20001005.php ""It gets confusing for U.S. beer drinkers because the alcoholic strength of wine the world over and beer almost everywhere outside of the United States is measured by volume. The U.S. legal standard (many states regulate the strength of beer) is by weight. For instance, a beer that is 3.2% by weight is about 4% by volume. If you know the alcohol by volume (abv), multiply that by .8 and you'll be pretty close to the alcohol by weight (abw). Inversely, multiply the abw by 1.25 to find the approximate abv."""
540319,Guest,2004-06-05 06:50:00,0,"Last year,as always, we brought extra beer with us. They will ask you at the border how much you paid for your extra beer. We told them it was $10.99 a case for Bud, and showed a receipt. (you do not have to have a receipt, but the more cooperative you are, the more cooperative they are!!!) We then had to pay duty of about $5.50 - $6.00 American for each case. Total Cost under $17 per case. We ran out of beer (This seems to happen every year), and had to replenish in Ear Falls and paid $34 Canadian, which ends up being about $24.50 per case American. It is definately cheaper to buy beer in the states and bring it over the border and pay the duty. The duty for a bottle of Hard Liquor is much higher that beer. If you are like me and bring a bottle of Captain Morgan's or Vodka, then you should claim the hard liquor as you duty free item, and pay the duty on the beer."

540353,Guest,2004-06-05 14:31:00,0,The extra cost is worth it....nothing like an ice cold Crystal or Kokanee on the front deck after being on the water all day. It's all part of the Canadian experience.
540359,Matches,2004-06-05 21:58:00,236,You can buy the Canadian beer at the border before going in at the duty free store. It is amazing how much cheaper it is. Crystal? How about that XXX? Too bad they don't sell that at the duty free.
540364,Guest,2004-06-06 07:08:00,0,"I like drinking what I am used to drinking. I like Bud better than about any other beer. If I like it, and it is cheaper, then thats what I drink. In a good week trip, our guys average over four cases per guy. With 8 guys going this year, we will bring 35 cases of beer. If we spent that all in Canada it would be $857.50. Buying it in the US and paying duty it is $595. Case closed."
540365,Guest,2004-06-06 07:55:00,0,Buy from the locals ..they appreciate it. There are many here who rely on the business. Ontario is looking at changing their restaurant rules where you can bring your own beer and wine with you to the restaurant. Some of the posters would sure want to do that if they ever eat out. You'll save a dollar maybe two and that's significant if you tally right to the penny.
540368,Guest,2004-06-06 08:31:00,0,Just imagine the beer the fishermen would consume and the money that could be driven into the Canadian economy if it weren't illegal to drink a beer at a shore lunch on the lake and then transfer the empty back to camp. You get cauhgt with emties in your boat and you'll get a fine. No drinking in the boat or at a shore luch outside your cabin.
540458,Alces,2004-06-09 05:14:00,35,"This is not the case in every provinces, in Qu√©bec, you can drink almost everywhere, anytime as long as the person operating the boat is not drinking. It is illegal to drink in a vehicule while it is in motion, but it is not illegal to drink in a boat while it is in motion, except for the operator. Beer: the proof (alcool %) in american beer is almost half the alcool volume in canadian beer. If youd american BUD says 5% proof and the canadian BUD says 5%Alcool volume, you have twice the alcool in the canadian beer than the american, which mean, instead of bringing 14 cases of american BUD, you buy 7 cases of canadian BUD and get drunk faster and it is also cheaper in the process...."

Do you have a better chance of getting searched if you bring more beer than allowed? Or do you simply tell them how much you have, pay the duty, and go on your way most the time??"

540311,Guest,2004-06-04 16:41:00,0,I did a little research on it. It appears that it is slightly less expensive to bring extra beer and pay the duty on it. Obviously there is a time savings because you do not have to hang out at the beer store. The Canadian beer is good though and often times has a little more alcohol.
