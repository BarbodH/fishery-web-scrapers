A case of any beverage weighs about 20 pounds. Any beverages bought from him do not count against the weight limit so I was wandering what a reasonable price was for beer , soft drinks, or water? I believe he is charging $40 American funds for a case of beer. Let me know what you think"

540528,Guest,2004-06-10 13:28:00,0,"i seriously doubt this outfitter is getting rich on beer delivery, if you want a case just pop for the $40 and count it as part of the package. on the other hand, i suppose if you can't afford the price of delivered beer you might have to consider going without...."

540536,Ivy,2004-06-10 17:21:00,556,Our Out-fitter last year ( Kay-Air out of Ear Falls ) flew all our beer ( 14 cases ) in ahead of us and it was iced down whe we got there. Really didn't have to worry about the weight limit. Some people know how to live. Some people know how to live well. I prefer the latter. Ivy

540541,lobo1,2004-06-10 20:52:00,734,Everybody does it differantly but after having been a number of places I would say that 40$ is on the high end but not unacceptable by any means. Last year I think we were going to pay 33$ but our trip was cancelled due to ice. Just think how they are going to look in your cooler with some of that stained water and a few chucks of sawdust from the ice house ......yummmmmmmmmm!! lobo1
