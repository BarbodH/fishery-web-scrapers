540381,Guest,2004-06-06 21:29:00,0,"I returned from Birch Island Resort Thursday the 3rd. It was different this year. Only caught 20 some smallmouth, so I didn't get my smallmouth fix. The water was on the cold side. Started to warm up in to lower 50s the last 2 days in the afternoons. Walleye were easy to come by. One of the group caught 300 he said below the Dalles one day. I do know he caught alot. Was there some myself using sauger jigs (1-1/4 ounce jigs) with Berkley Power grubs. I caught 3 muskie fishing walleye and smallmouth. The largest would be around 35 pounds on 8 pound test, though my buddy Tim, who jumped in to my boat with the muskie net from his boat to net the fish, succeeded in knocking my TN sauger jig out of the muskie's mouth, so I guess it wasn't really caught. Just as well as it would have been hard on the big boy (girl) to land that muskie in to the boat. Next time I will measure it and take a picture of it in the water and release it at boat side. No crappie this year. Pike were not as prevalent, though we don't fish for them much at all. The water came up about 1 foot while we were there. It should be great smallmouth fishing now with the warmer weather. Reels can give us a report hopefully when he gets back. Don PS: I hope to get my smallmouth fix when I go to the Lower French River June 30th. Haven't been there since 1989."
540456,Guest,2004-06-08 21:55:00,0,Six of us will be up there on June 19th would like to have fishing report the week before to know what is hot and not and which lures are working well for walleye and northern also would like to know where they are hitting the best at
540467,Guest,2004-06-09 07:31:00,0,"The bite right now is tough---according to some guys up there now---one here and there/and decent size when you find them, but tough going. Most fish being caught in Little Sand or current---but SMALLER in current areas.....water is 52 degrees. Water coming up 4 inches per day....and is high enough to buzz through the rock fence area."
540485,Guest,2004-06-09 13:56:00,0,What's the deal up there......? Things should be heating up with the warmer weather and high water always seems to be better for the walleye bite. Any smallies being had?
540510,Guest,2004-06-10 07:44:00,0,"Hi Aaron, when are you heading up this year? We're going to be there 6/26 to 7/2. IPS"

540016,Guest,2004-05-27 09:45:00,0,Heading up to Cygnet lake Saturday. Wondering how the fishing has been and what areas seem to be producing the eyes?
540145,Guest,2004-05-31 11:27:00,0,leaving in a couple days any recent reports?
540146,Guest,2004-05-31 11:37:00,0,I am headed up there soon also. Looking for some help on locating early season muskys also. If you do not want to give spots please just a pattern and what type of lure seems to work the best. I have been going there for years fishing walleyes but never northerns or muskys. We are going to spend some time looking for them. I would greatly appreciate it.
540164,Reels,2004-06-01 07:54:00,2876,I just talked to Don this morning who is up there fishing. Water levels are about 2 feet higher than normal and rising. Water temp is in high 40's to low 50's. Walleyes are hitting good in current areas. Smallmouth have not turned on yet. They have caught a few nice muskies while fishing for bass. Crappies are slow. I'm heading up Thursday night and will be back in about ten days. I will post a report when I get back. <{{}}><
540166,Guest,2004-06-01 10:04:00,0,Thanks Reels. I appreciate you responding to all the Minaki questions. I will be up there on Saturday in a black Pro V 1775. If you see me make sure to say Hi. I am staying at Paradise Cove.
540168,Reels,2004-06-01 11:26:00,2876,"Will do, I am in a Green lund 1900 with a 200 Yamaha V-max. Likewise, stop by and say hi if your driving by. We are at Barbers resort, just around the corner from you going towards Gun Lake. <{{}}><"
540203,Guest,2004-06-02 08:09:00,0,"JUST GOT BACK LAST NIGHT. FISHING WAS OK, MANY SMALL ONES. FOUND ENOUGH GOOD SIZE FISH TO EAT AND BRING HOME. THE FISH WE WERE ON WERE IN OR NEAR THE MAIN CURRENT.
