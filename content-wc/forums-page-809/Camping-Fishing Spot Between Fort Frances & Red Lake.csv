I used to fly-in every year before I got kids. Now I can't afford that. Would like to find a spot that has electricity, showers and boat rentals. Remote as possible with lots of fish action for the kids. Size not important. I figure we'll have to go up as far as Dryden and no farther than Red Lake. Any tips? Thanks."

The web site is www.winelakecamp.com . The owners have to kids that love to play and the are a 9 year old girl and a 5 year old boy. It is located just past Vermillion Bay.
