5474090,The tank,2017-04-14 18:08:00,340,K thanks. Times going by so fast it feels like we was just at the all Canada show a couple weeks ago.
5474186,Obabikon,2017-04-14 19:02:00,2370,"Oh, and spring crappies can be a little tricky up in Obabikon. You have to try to find them in the weeds, but it is always fun up there."
5502313,fldoc1,2017-04-26 16:15:00,69,My original post asked about Algae. I was fascinated with the discussion regarding getting into Obabikon lake. I will be on LOW the 2nd week of June with my wife and wonder about finding crappies in Obabikon. Randy from Duluth
5502609,Obabikon,2017-04-26 18:29:00,2370,"Crappies in June up there are not easy to find. They will most likely be in the back of weedbeds. When we do find them, it is usually on accident. Someone will be pike fishing, and see a bunch of swirls in the back of bays. Many years, we don't catch them anywhere but off of our floating docks that time of year."
5468586,fldoc1,2017-04-12 08:32:00,69,"We are looking at going up to Miles Bay, and the northern, Canadian side of Little Traverse Bay in August and, more likely, the first week of September to fish. I have read that there are some serious algae blooms on the lake in the later part of summer. I am wondering when they are at their worst, how does the algae affect the bite if you decide to fish a bad bloom, and can one motor to a nearby area of the lake to get out of the bloom. (nearby maybe a 5/10 mile ride) Or does the entire area of the lake bloom at the same time. Randy from Duluth"
5468626,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-12 08:44:00,447,"There are several factors of course but generally speaking different areas will bloom at slightly different times and some portions of LOTW don't bloom at all. Even during a heavy bloom one can generally find clear areas by fishing areas where the bloom has blown clear. Speaking with musky fishermen who fish out of Tamarack Island camp, their catch rate is the same during the bloom as it is before bloom. Many hate to fish it because your boat gets messy and slimy. Of course, a good cleaning post-trip will deal with that. I prefer to avoid the bloom. Perhaps Obabikon will chime in since he's located in the general area of Miles Bay."
5468866,The tank,2017-04-12 10:31:00,340,We go usually first or second week in august and seems to be pretty heavy then. The only thing I dont like about it is you can't see under it. For me I think walleye fishing; it doesn't make any difference except on real sunny calm days it's your friend the thicker the better. Far as my boat usually by the time we get back to morson to load up and head home the boats not bad. Gotta spend some time on the motor to clean it up. It's not usually all over the wind moves it around.
5469026,Shorelunch,2017-04-12 11:34:00,554,Most years it runs its course around mid-August. It's not widespread and generally goes from bay to bay depending on wind. I certainly wouldn't let it sway me from planning a trip and dates. Sometimes the walleyes steer clear of the algae and sometimes they don't.
5469058,Obabikon,2017-04-12 12:16:00,2370,"Mostly temperature related. So... warm summer = earlier bloom. Cool summer = later bloom.General time is August 10 - August 24.... then usually lasting 2 weeks from the start.From what I've found, the only thing it affects is seeing musky follows. You can always find clean water though. Even the smallest breeze will push the algea against one shore line. So... fish the opposite or open water stuff.The bloom very rarely affects Obabikon Lake... so, if you are in our area and tired of the bloom, you can always try running through the narrows."
5470538,The tank,2017-04-13 08:08:00,340,Hey Jared is there a specific way you need to go through the narrows to get in Obabikon lake? We're going to be at miles bay opening week. We're going to run over and check your cabin out up that way and run up in Obabikon and see if there's any crappie roaming around and of course some walleyes.
5470850,Bill Krejca,2017-04-13 11:02:00,6107,"The trick is to stay far left at the narrows going in, opposite coming out. You have to almost kiss the rock shore on the left at the narrowest spot. Rocks are in the middle, stay away from middle and right side. I normally tilt motor up several notches, and go slow. The current goes either way, depending on wind direction, and them reverses itself as wind subsides. If you don't almost touch the left side, you will drag on some really hard rocks. It is not difficult, but doable.Once past the narrowest spot, water gets deeper for a ways, I then gun it to get over some again shallower water ahead. It is a fun lake to fish, one of my favorites. Bill"
5471122,Shorelunch,2017-04-13 12:39:00,554,"I've seen guide boats and even 18/19 foot Lund Tyee type boats go through the Obabikon Narrows on plane. That's some intestinal fortitude! Me, I plop my bowmount trolling motor down just below the waterline and have a person in the back with a paddle to keep the stern from going against the west (left side) rock shore. Not really a big deal - and a fun place to visit."
5473850,The tank,2017-04-14 16:09:00,340,K thanks. I'll just put the trolling motor down the first trip.
5473906,Obabikon,2017-04-14 16:47:00,2370,Water level makes a big difference. I'll try to post an update in mid-May. Shouldn't be a problem getting in... just stay to the west side.
