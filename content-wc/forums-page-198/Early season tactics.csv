The walleyes are often barely post-spawn during the opening week. I know where the walleyes often spawn on the lakes that I fish. As the season progresses, the walleyes disperse from these spawning areas in response to warming water temperature. This is where the dependency on weather and water temperature comes into play. The walleyes may linger near their spawning areas if the weather is cool. They may move well away from their spawning areas if the weather warms and stays warm.I start the first week of my fishing season by looking for stretches of shore line, near spawning areas that have warmer water temperatures than nearby areas. Things like exposure to sunlight and waves can bump the water temperature by 1/2 of a degree. It doesn't sound like much, but it can make a big difference to a walleye. Once I find the water that I like, I start looking for packs of walleyes that roam up and down this stretch of shoreline. I might anchor and cast a jig + minnow, or backtroll a Lindy Rig. These packs of walleyes might be ""here"" right now and ""gone"" thirty minutes later. As several have mentioned, SLOW presentations are a key to my success when fishing opening week(s) of the season.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

5509018,pale ryder,2017-04-29 11:27:00,1937,"I agree that slow if often best in early season.However, a few years ago, opening day in Wi., ~50 deg early post spawn, I was fishing a shallow lake and doing very well trolling crank baits in 5-7' at 2.8-3.5 mph. After catching 2 nice walleyes on 2 passes through the same area. I stopped and anchored. For over an hour I had a minnow out under a bobber and a leech out also under a bobber and I fan casted the area. after ~20 minutes I moved 100' or so and tried again, and again. And I got nothing not even a nobble. So I went back to trolling and got the next walleye before I could get all three lines out.The point is fish don't always follow the rules.That said, prov1800 is right. start out near spawning areas and fish slow."
5503682,Riverkeg,2017-04-27 07:13:00,134,"Hello fellow WC members. I'd like some ideas on other tactics to use during opening week. We'll be on Cedar lake again this year. We fish 3 out of a ProV 1660 tiller and have primarily stuck with jigs, either vertical or pitching to shore if the walleye are shallow. When we used to go up in July to Clay lake, we would often pull harnesses but we've never tried that method early. What do you guys think? What else to you do during the opener?"
5503802,Mojo-NC,2017-04-27 07:43:00,1929,"We've only been up to Canada once during opening week, and that year most of our big females were caught on spinner harnesses with leeches, sometimes with minnows. They were pre-spawn and the females were very concentrated in a fairly small area of the lake, coming in out of the deep water and moving up to where the river feeds into the lake. All of the boats anchored up on the flat and we casted down current and slowly reeled up the break. We caught some really big fish that year in the 26-30"" range, but we hated being bunched up with all of the other boats in such a small area like that. The smaller males were up in the river and we caught them mainly on jigs. We had to wear rain pants even when it was sunny because the males spewed all over us when we took them off the hook. Good luck!"
5503826,Ricky Spanish,2017-04-27 07:49:00,1298,"We did well on Eagle Lake last year pulling harnesses with minnows in shallow bays. It was the 2nd week of the walleye season. When that got slow, we'd move to the nearest deeper rock structure with jig and minnow. Good luck on your trip."
5504242,Riverkeg,2017-04-27 09:29:00,134,"Thanks guys. We'll look for some opportunities to pull some harnesses around. If anything, it's another way of breaking up the day."
5504466,prov1800,2017-04-27 10:40:00,5010,Its a weather thing.seems each opener is diff.theres diff groups of fish that behave diff.if the spawn is late they will hang around in the sanctuaries till they recuperate and then slowly move out.these fish might not be available in the first couple of weeks.but there are other groups of fish that spawn on shore in certain places and are usually the fish i target each year as they are more accessible. I see lors of boats trolling what ever but mist going way to fast.this time of year and if water is cold you will need to fish in snail mode.tough predicting a opener.right now we have had a foot of snow and cold temps that have formed ice again.last week of the walleye season i was fishing in a t shirt from shore catching smaller males on almist evey cast.but by the last day came it had turned cooler and although we still caught some it wasnt as hot a bite as before.iam sure this weather has turned of the spawn and will need some warmer stable weather to get them going again.ill be out there on the opener unless its raining.
5504970,Wedge,2017-04-27 14:18:00,270,From what I have gathered early in the season if you can find a sandy area and work slow and shallow with a jig and minnow. 6-12 ftSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
5505042,Riverkeg,2017-04-27 14:50:00,134,"It's settled then, I'm just going to follow you around the lake LOL! Don't go to fast, as my fishing partners are bigger guys and I can't get over 30 mph. See you there!"
5505058,Riverkeg,2017-04-27 14:52:00,134,Last year we were getting them as shallow as 1-2 ft. We would just pitch jigs/minnows to the shore and basically drag it back slow. It worked.
5505402,bthomas3333,2017-04-27 17:51:00,465,Slow - Typically keep the trolling motor moving under .5. If still too fast try slip bobbers and live bait under 10ft. Be flexible.
5506234,prov1800,2017-04-28 05:51:00,5010,They were definatly shallow last year.lots of fun with some huge smallmouths mixed in.
