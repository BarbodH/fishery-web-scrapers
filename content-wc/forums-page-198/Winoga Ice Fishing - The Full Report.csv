Fairly sure I saw more fish hooked in 3 days of ice fishing than the previous 10 years combined.Really broke up the winter for me, and was WAY more enjoyable than lying on a beach for this guy. My apologies once again to Gord about the fire on the ice thing. http://www.canadafishingguide.net/wi...ing-at-winoga/"
