5480090,Wedge,2017-04-17 13:57:00,270,"So I have fished the boundary waters, LOTW a few times, the small Lakes around Perrault Falls, and Pakwash a few times. Almost all of my trips have been July 1st to first week of Sept. This year, we are headed to Red Lake and possibly going to fish Gullrock as well and we are going June 9-17th. I am actually doing a trip for the first time without a lodge. Just staying at Super 8 and trailering around. From what I can gather, walleye may be in transition from shallow sandy areas in 6-12 ft of water. Any other tips on what to expect that time of year? Weather? Best tactics? Spots to fish? I did just have Red Lake Marina send me a map of the lake so I have somewhere to start. Any tips would be most welcomed!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"

My normal week was either Walleye opening or first full week in June. Here is what I used to tell the new guys.1. Slow Slower Slowest. The fish 90% of the time wanted a very slow presentation. Not every year but most years they wanted you barely moving the jig/rig. In fact you could slip bobber them if you wanted.2. Live bail increased the catch by 3-4x. Usually used live minnows.3. Shallow mid lake reefs / narrow downs / rock shelves.4. We fished 6-14ft. When we worked deeper the catch rate went down.5. If you find a good spot don't be afraid to spot lock and circle cast the boat. (slowest)6. Best colors for us were orange head /orange tail jigs. Chart / Pink Pink/White worked. Keep the tails smaller 3"". When we upped the bait profile we moved into Pike.7. Size 1/8oz to 1/4 smaller was usually better but with wind etc 1/4 came into play.8. I strongly prefer the XF tips. I prefer Med action but if ML with XF you would be good too.Just normal fishing ideas. Match the color to the water (dark stained) and bait fish (prob peach when hitting orange). Match the size and speed of presentation to the bait fish size (early). Fish the locations (post spawn - Reef / neckdowns / rocks. Not much they wanted more than live minnows when feeding post spawn.In general a lot of guys would move too fast with too big of jig/rig and that would knock the catch rate way down. Good luck!B-"

5483378,frozen fish,2017-04-18 13:46:00,92,"In Red Lake in early June, East Bay and the area where the Chukuni River enter Red Lake usually contain fish. Again, there is an area closed to fishing at that time of the year. Check you map and Ontario regulations."
5485730,Guest,2017-04-19 10:03:00,0,I have been going to Gullrock for that week for the past 15 years now and we fish different then most. We only cast or troll cranks along the shoreline or bays and there have been years where we do better then the guys jigging and others were we don't. The nice thing is we are away from the crowd and never have any competition for a spot. For us we look for a bay that the wind is blowing into and have found good fishing which lasts for maybe a few hours then we move on.
