5481514,fishpoop,2017-04-17 22:12:00,630,Interesting concept. I have to assume that every fall he then powers his boat/trailer back to the mainland. Which leads me to wonder about the trailer bearings and electrical system? Wouldn't that wash the grease off the bearings and short out the lights? Even with Bearing Buddies I'd think water would get in but I could be wrong.
5477746,Lazy Fisherman,2017-04-16 11:38:00,276,I think this product is an interesting way of anchoring if you do not want your hull touching rocks. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yo55lYSr2I
5478090,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-16 16:16:00,447,That's the kind of thing I was looking for. Thanks
5478146,castnblast,2017-04-16 17:00:00,111,"I live in NWO and beach and island camp from may till october. If you camp on beaches for any length of time, one thing is for sure, wind will blow up. it is after all - a beach. You need a sand anchor. it's a bar with a half twist of auger blade, top loop and a leverage bar. What you do is: - wade out up to your nipples and secure the sand anchor 1.5 feet into the bottom. - tie a float off the now submerged end of the top of the sand anchor - when you come in for the night, clip the bow to the float line, then back the boat stern first toward the shoreline - secure the bow line when the back of the boat is in about 2 feet of water. - jump out of the boat, get wet feet, and if you feel like it tie the back of the boat off to a tree (with a bit of slack. - storm comes through at night and the only thing you need to worry about is a big ole poplar or spruce coming down in the middle of the night and crushing you in the tent. lol Serious, the boat is going no where. It will bob around all night long in 3-4 foot waves - bow out to sea, and will not fill with water. (as it is sure to if you nose into the beach and leave it on shore) On calm nights, beach the boat, tie it off to a tree and forget about it. Worst part about the sand anchor is setting it and taking it out at the end the trip. Other than that cant beat it.."
5478258,Beer King,2017-04-16 18:14:00,146,"I should have included that we use aluminum boats and and can tolerate getting a scuff mark or two. That being said, if you can run boat nose onto the tire(s) with enough boat weight it may rock a bit but does not really slide around. That assumes you really get nose rope cinched tight to a tree or rock so there is no slop. Cant speak to how hard or easy a scuff mark will clean up on a glass boat. You could probably wrap something around the tire to help with that? Dan"
5480106,srk-low,2017-04-17 13:59:00,78,"Not that I suggest it, but every year I see a guy who lives on an island six miles out of Sioux Narrows. He does not have a dock. He slowly powers his 19 foot Lund with the trailer still strapped on. He has a hitch post and ball concreted to the shore that he secures the trailer to for the season that serves as his dock."
5480210,Wedge,2017-04-17 14:21:00,270,"That is actually kinda brilliantWhat about a simple anchor ball offshore a bit and get a small inflatable boat from amazon for 30 bucks to get back to shore and then back to the boat. If you have a camp established, you could leave the boat inflated on shore. Cheap & easy. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"

5480466,Bill Krejca,2017-04-17 16:10:00,6107,"Wow, I must be smarter than i look, because several times I have gotten a start on that very same scenario, that is, not unstrapping the boat from the trailer! That is an interesting idea, though, never heard or thought of that! Bill"
5480538,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-17 16:42:00,447,My wife has an uncle who built a homemade pontoon boat with built in trailer. Never saw it but I understand it was tricky to reconnect.
5480650,Beer King,2017-04-17 17:28:00,146,Very creative for sure - I know of some guys that did that many years ago with much smaller boat - in order to use trailer to pull boat boat and camping gear across a portage. Beat multiple trips carrying everything. But they had to go several miles across big open water with that trailer strapped on- is was not without risk :-)
5476922,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-16 07:35:00,447,Exploring a boat-in camping trip on a big water lake and am curious what others who camp do to protect their boat at the campsite. Obviously I'll look for well-protected water and a sandy beach but does anyone take extra steps to protect their boat? My boat is fiberglass with a Hamby's keel guard but even gentle rocking at night could cause some hull scratching. Any input is appreciated. Thanks
5477034,Wedge,2017-04-16 08:10:00,270,"I haven't done this, but I found some info that recommended tying the bow to shore and one anchor off of each aft corner.(preferably 2 off each corner)This was off of a Lake Powell camping sitehttp://www.wayneswords.com/index.php...d=87&Itemid=56"
5477082,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-16 08:22:00,447,"Yea, I've done that when cooking shorelunch but don't know if I trust it overnight. Plus someone has to get wet. Might be my best option though."
5477098,Wedge,2017-04-16 08:23:00,270,"I think they mean to nose onto the beach, then drop anchors off of each corner, straight down. Still nosed on shore. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"
5477146,Beer King,2017-04-16 08:34:00,146,"Old car tires work well if you can place them such that any wind action won't drift/move them out of place. Put a couple rocks in to keep them from floating out of place and pull or run boat onto them (or against them depending on shoreline) and tie off tight. Need to have tires tied off to shore so you don't lose em. Thats what we use on our annual tent camping trip. As you said, the real need is to find a spot that will be sheltered from any big wind - Nothing worse than a big blow coming up at night and your boat being in a questionable spot. Dan"
5477194,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-16 08:56:00,447,"Thought about something like carpet covered 2 x4s similar to trailer bunks but tires might be better. Do they leave scuff marks on the fiberglass hull and, if so, do they buff out easily?"
5477226,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-16 09:03:00,447,"What I used to do was drop anchors offshore a bit, getting them out wider than the boat about 10 feet, then pulling boat close into shore if a rocky shoreline or all the way into the sand if sandy. That way the anchors could dig in rather than be straight down where they could pull loose easily. Tied off to a tree or rock with the bowline and the security was pretty good. Never tested it in a big blow though. I think a combination of your idea and Beer King's tire idea would be a pretty good system."
5477498,andersaki,2017-04-16 09:49:00,1426,"Tie long ropes off at the back corners of your boat. Slip the rope through the eyes of two anchors, do not tie knots. Drop anchors at 45 degrees to each side of the boat and about 50 feet or so from shore, use your judgement here to get the ropes at a proper angle. Tie a third rope to the bow eye. Pull up to shore, unload and get out, adjust all three ropes so the boat is in a good spot away from shore and tie off to trees or rocks. If your anchors have good grip, your boat should be safely moored from three points. andersaki"

5477626,Shellback,2017-04-16 10:39:00,8083,I would NEVER anchor the stern facing offshore! Good way to find your boat sunk in the morning if a storm comes up.
