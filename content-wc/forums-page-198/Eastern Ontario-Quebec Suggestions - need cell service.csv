5344249,smallcal,2017-02-20 10:16:00,119,"Okay, this is contrary to why I go to Canada fishing, but our group needs to make a change to our normal trip to the Gouin this year.We need to do a long (4-6 day) weekend trip in July that has the kind of walleye fishing we all go to Canada for and has access to cell service and/or e-mail while we are on the lake. We generally enjoy the relaxed backtrolling with worm harnesses and the occasional crank bait. Two guys in a 14' boat is the way we like to fish.Any suggestions? We generally pass through Watertown, NY on our way north so within a few hours of there would be ideal.Anything you would suggest is appreciated."
5344305,67ZL1,2017-02-20 10:57:00,277,"Wolfe Lake near Westport or Big Gull Lake north of Hwy 7. Wolfe would be my first choice. Not too sure how the cell reception is at Gull Lake, my guess is not very good."

Our group of seniors routinely rents a satellite phone for each of two trips each year. Rental cost of $100 and $2 per minute amongst 4 guys is not cost prohibitive."
5344385,smallcal,2017-02-20 11:46:00,119,"Unfortunately, the number of calls and e-mails will be cost prohibitive. We take a rental sat phone to the Gouin for general calls which isn't bad but this year a couple of jobs have changed that require constant access to a smart phone.Thanks for the suggestion, everything is appreciated."
5344873,fsz,2017-02-20 15:53:00,144,"How about Kipawa, Nippissing, French River? Maybe Beauchene (but mostly a bass lake, walleye reported as so-so from what I hear)."

They take a little more patience than Iridiums, but they do work. Iridiums rent for $99 a week and includes 30 minutes of airtime. Additional airtime in $1.50 a minute. - Jon - SPS"
