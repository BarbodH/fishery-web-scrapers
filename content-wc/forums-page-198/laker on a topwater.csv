Easily one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen in all my years of fishing.Bear in mind now, Miniss is a HUGE lake teeming with walleye. One afternoon I chucked a full pepperette into the water as an offering to the fish gods as a joke. Three full days later the other 2 guys in my group, kept 4 walleye for dinner. Catching and releasing easily over a hundred, randomly keeping those 4. Cleaning them back at camp my full undigested pepperette was in the stomach of one of those four fish.Almost as amazing to me, he caught that fish miles away from where I threw it in the water. Was very surprised to have clear proof just how far those fish travel.The odds of that happening have got to be insanely high."
5469770,dented boat guy,2017-04-12 18:53:00,24,Anybody tried for lakers on a topwater or caught a laker on a topwater? Thinking of giving it try next September.
5469802,v-bay gord,2017-04-12 18:59:00,3168,"Never tried.....but I know in June when the flying black ants come out I've cleaned plenty of lake trout full of them. I can't see lakers going to the surface in September........maybe very late or October, but there isn't any real insect hatch at that time........."
5469842,Mike Borger,2017-04-12 19:14:00,1554,No. But I DID catch a laker casting a pepperette rigged on a swimbait jighead last fall.
5470402,jambi,2017-04-13 07:25:00,504,"When running to our pike spot on Pine Needle Lake in late May a few years ago, very calm morning, I thought I saw a fish surface ahead of us in the narrows/neck down area. I cut the motor to an idle and watched - sure enough another surfacing fish. We didn't have top water but casted small shallow running crank baits. Non stop for two hours 3 to 7# lake trout. They were chasing around small fry very shallow. Wish I had a small top water with me but the cranks were a blast. Repeated same the next morning."
5470410,prov1800,2017-04-13 07:25:00,5010,top water baits just aren't a go to bait for lakers but on occasions have caught them at ice out fishing for pike in the shallows.normally conditions for fall lakers in sept the conditions usually are not perfect although 4-5 years ago they were as they were spawning early and we would catch trout literally on evry cast on the shallow rocks on tubes.basically they would take it the second it hit the water.all males cleaning the rocks of anything that would eat there eggs.very aggressive bite that would normally happen later in October when the season still used to be open.the last few falls have not been anywhere near that day and they still stay fairly deep but move up slowly.
5470562,Bill Krejca,2017-04-13 08:25:00,6107,"Nope, but I once caught a bullhead in LOW on a dry fly, while fishing crappies in the evening. Rather unusual, from my experience. Bill"
5470730,mjayn,2017-04-13 10:15:00,1188,"Caught a few in the top 1-2 feet of water in late fall(November) at a dam. Caught them on homemade mepps style spinners that had some lift and were always in the top few feet of water. Hadn't thought of trying topwater, might have gotten one that day."
5476354,Baseline,2017-04-15 20:49:00,3207,I've caught a few lakers running spin baits a foot or two under the surface fishing for May pike around the Islands on the Manitou.
5478266,123chadder,2017-04-16 18:19:00,429,"last year at dayohessarah on our last day it was foggy,we knew the plane wasnt coming anytime soon so we went fishing. the lake was glass,there were these flies on the surface that were being picked off from below...i caught 6 flies and put them on a single hook,i could only cast 5-8 feet,but every cast landed a trout,it was a blast!"
5482250,dented boat guy,2017-04-18 08:00:00,24,Thanks for the reply's and ideas. I know a topwater is not a super effective presentation for lakers but it would be exciting if I could make it work. I will be on Dryberry the last day of September and will give it a shot for an hour or two. I will not be using a pepperette however.
