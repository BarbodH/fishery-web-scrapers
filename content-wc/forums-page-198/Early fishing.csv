Friend of mine went to Canada in early June with another fella, I'll call him Monkey Boy because that's what we call him, and Monkey's son. Monkey loved to toss out a jig and minnow and drag it on the bottom and he taught his little boy to do the same. They caught fish just like you would expect and they lost jigs like you would expect. There's where the trouble came in. You see, Monkey Boy is notoriously cheap. Considered excessively cheap in a group that includes me which is saying something. By Tuesday he and his boy were running low on jigs, he brought three dozen for the two of them, and bumming Brad's at an alarming rate. By midday Wednesday Brad was getting low too and things became uncomfortable. Moral of the story is it's ok to be cheap but if you are take your lumps when you run out of jigs. A better idea is to put all your change in a jar for a couple months and buy plenty of jigs."

Sometimes you run into snake holes and get bit off like, 27 times in one day for me. I'm guessing I bring close to 300 jigs per trip. The rocks eat paint to."
