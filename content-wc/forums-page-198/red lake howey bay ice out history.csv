5494618,campchick,2017-04-23 15:53:00,96,In spite of colder weather Howey Bay is quite black and the ice should go out tomorrow if we get some sun and a little wind. Already 4 floatplanes docked at the Chukuni River. We are expecting snow tomorrow and cooler temps for the rest of the week.

5431178,Mike Borger,2017-03-28 10:55:00,1554,Having just returned from NW Ontario I can tell you there's a shockingly small amount of snow on the ground. I think it will be an early ice out and for sure there will be low water in that region this year.
5435106,martinbns,2017-03-29 17:22:00,1520,"Talked to my employee today, Red Lake has a bit of open ice where the water is moving, other than that very thick still and not started to honeycomb yet. She told me somewhere on highway 105 yesterday a fully loaded tractor trailer went off the road out onto a lake and didn't go through the ice. That was closer to Vermillion Bay than Red Lake."
5436138,Rock Lobstar1,2017-03-30 06:55:00,134,There was decent rain in red lake last night and still this morning so that's gonna speed things up quite a bit. Also stayed above freezing overnight which helps.
5491954,martinbns,2017-04-21 19:46:00,1520,"I was up there yesterday, a bit of open water but the ice is just about black. Low water levels in all the creeks and lakes on the way up."
5492034,LoDo,2017-04-21 20:38:00,721,In 2014 we had to take off from the river using Chimo Air to Woodland Caribou Prov Park. We landed on Howie when we returned.
5494106,Golden Eagle,2017-04-23 08:57:00,2642,"I've flown from Red Lake for every walleye opener, beginning 3rd Saturday of May 1984. Haven't missed any. Have gone in early several times. 32 consecutive years of experiencing ice out and all the talk leading up to the opener.I've been missing pictures of Hugh Carlson taking off on ice from Howey Bay and landing on open water at the Chukuni Bridge. Floats are not a one trick piece of equipment. Take off from ice and land on soft water."
