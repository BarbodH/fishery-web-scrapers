5519298,fishmanric,2017-05-03 08:27:00,219,"Rainy is huge but navigation under normal conditions isn't a problem. Many spots are close to the camp I mentioned. Also, this part of Rainy offers every type of fishing known to man. I don't think you can go wrong in any part of Canada."
5464066,Dog,2017-04-10 13:40:00,210,I'm looking for a little advice from anyone that has fished the Ontario side of Rainy Lake or Cedar Lake near Perrault Falls. I am going to be taking my grandson up before he heads off to college. Mostly looking for walleyes and smallies and we won't be able to get up there until august. I have never fished these lakes before and wondering which one of these you would fish in August. Thanks for any suggestions. Fred
5464442,camp chef,2017-04-10 15:23:00,915,"This will be our 5th year on Rainy.We wouldn't be going back if we didn't like it. We have been fishing in Canada for roughly 30 years and really like Rainy...although I have never had a bad trip to Indian, Pipestone,Nungesser or the Winnipeg river either. If the drive makes no difference (Rainy is the closest) I would try to settle on a camp or lodge the best meets your needs."
5464450,The tank,2017-04-10 15:26:00,340,I would fish them both. That's a tuff one. Walleye and smallmouth both lakes are great. I would probly go with rainy because of the drive. 2 hours closer. I like the west arm of rainy that time of year. I do like cedar point resort on cedar also. Ray is a good guy and it's right in the middle of the lake. For me personally I think you can get into bigger walleyes on rainy.
5465026,pale ryder,2017-04-10 18:04:00,1937,"I've fished Cedar 8 times in the last 10 years, 7 of those in August. Always stay at Clark's, and have never been disappointed. They offer exactly what I want in a resort. Nice clean well maintained cabins at a very reasonable rate. http://clarksresorts.com/pages/view/...-lights-resortCedar has really good walleye, smb and crappie fishing plus BIG musky.The things I like about Cedar, beside the great fishing, is it is big enough and varied enough to never get bored yet small enough that wind isn't a problem and you don't have much chance of getting lost and you don't need a big boat. I haven't yet fished Rainy, so I can't compare the 2."
5465274,Baseline,2017-04-10 19:05:00,3207,"I've never been to Cedar so I can't comment on that. I have been fishing on Rainy for the last 35 years. I've fished mostly in Red Gut, Swell and Seine Bays. If you want the best SMB fishing week 2 &3 of June is prime time. Smallmouth fishing is very good on the shoulders of those two weeks as well. We catch lots of walleyes while throwing baits for the smallmouth. Taylors Cove, Coppens and the Fisheries are resorts that are all nice and in the dead-center of this area. If I had to pick one I'd stay at Taylors Cove.In August I would go to the US side of Rainy and fish the big reef complexes for some awesome walleye fishing."
5465562,Capt Morgan,2017-04-10 20:00:00,77,"I have to agree with pale Ryder, I have fished cedar lake 10 more times than you and have never had a blow day due to wind. The Walleye Fishing is great and is very variable patterns are going in any given week. I also recommend Clarks for a place to stay as they supply free ice and minnows."
5465730,prov1800,2017-04-10 21:55:00,5010,you and pale ryder have good taste.
5518530,Terwalleye,2017-05-02 19:43:00,166,"Our group is going back for year 8 at Clarks on Cedar. Very fishable lake. Did not take our group long to get on some fish and be very productive our first year there. Now, several years later we keep exploring and finding new spots to add to the arsenal. As someone else mentioned it's plenty big at 6,000 acres and 18 miles long. But it's not very wide in any one spot. All hazards are marked as well. VERY easy to navigate the lake and the bonus chance for a musky is hard to pass up. First year up; didn't really try for them. After seeing some; we now try for them and have decent success considering we're not really musky guys."
5519122,fishmanric,2017-05-03 07:21:00,219,"Fished Rainy out of Stokes Bay four straight years in August. Can't beat the drive as we launched off the Ash River from the Frontier lodge. Only a eight and a half hour drive from the Milwaukee area. Another 26 mile ride by boat to the camp with a portage at Kettle Falls. In August the fish are on the reefs and wind blown shorelines. Did awesome on both Walleyes and Smallmouths. We even got in on some good slab Crappie fishing. At $50 a night with your own boat, Stokes Bay is a great value and an incredible trip. The only negative I can think of is the wind when it gets up from the west or northwest. Plan on going back for a reunion of sorts next year."
5519130,walleye22,2017-05-03 07:31:00,59,just my opinion...rainy is a great lake but it is very big...maybe hard to get around and navigate? I prefer a smaller lake...not that cedar is really small but much more manageable to get around and fish maybe. you will catch fish at both spots. Also cedar might be more secluded and family friendly. Just my thoughts.
