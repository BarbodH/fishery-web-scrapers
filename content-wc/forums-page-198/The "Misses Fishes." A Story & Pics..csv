It's a true blessing in life that the two of you met each other and fell in love together.I have a somewhat similar story in that my wife enjoys fishing with me in NW Ontario. We enjoy the solitude and time together. Catching a lot of fish doesn't hurt either.On the lighter side, my wife's standard response when I tell her that I am contemplating the purchase of a piece of fishing equipment is that I should buy two - one for her and one for me.Okay, I have one more question to ask on behalf of the single guys out there on this forum that want to know but are afraid to ask: Does your wife have a twin sister?Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5484850,pjshorthorn,2017-04-19 06:08:00,5654,"Okay, don't quote me on this one,but the rumor in the Super Secret Squirrel Circles that I run around in is that Juls may just be that twin sister. Again, don't quote me on it. You know how rumors can get started in those squirrel circles......but it could be true PjShorthorn"
5490354,Moosebunk,2017-04-21 07:16:00,211,"No twin sisters. Sorry. Has 4 sisters though, none anyone can fish with. Sounds like ya got it alright man! Bren's not too bad either about new gear but she never says buy two. Hoping for a decent tax return this spring cause that'll help smooth over a new sonar, Tekota 600, and some kinda rod. PJ... careful in the squirrel circle... and it can get kinda nuts. lol"
5492378,martinbns,2017-04-22 05:58:00,1520,"You're a lucky guy and I'm jealous of where you two get to fish. My wife love to fish as well, we spend just about every sunday on the water all summer, but she's not as talented as your wife. Congrats on a great marriage, just makes life better all the way round."
5492410,ogilville,2017-04-22 06:30:00,262,What a great story! Congratulations on finding your true Love and fishing partner. My wife loves to go fishing with me too. She loves being on the boat and has more patience than many guys that claim to like fishing. It is a thrill to see her hook and catch a nice fish. I wish both of you many years of happy fishing.
5492746,pjshorthorn,2017-04-22 09:39:00,5654,Very sage advice. I was always wondering why my wife keeps telling me that I'm nuts Really nice article and pictures. Keep living that dream with your wife !!!! Hats off to the both of you. PjShorthorn
5493306,lenray,2017-04-22 18:20:00,467,Moosebunk--the best writer story teller on this forum. Been reading his stuff for years. Like being there in his words and pics. His lady is pretty and special also.....
5479938,Moosebunk,2017-04-17 12:59:00,211,"A different kind of story, a short one but long overdue in the making. Recently sifting through some old reports and pictures, in the past week when my wife Brenda booked two future fishing trips for us, I became a little more inspired to get this done. A lucky man to have found someone in life who not only supports (or puts up with) the crazy passion that is fishing, but also joins me whenever possible. And what's also incredible is her genuine enjoyment of the outdoors, catching the BIG fish and always staying positive through any hooks in the head and snow on her bed. Found a great partner for life and looking back it amazes me the fine fishing she has done. This story is all the Misses Fishes. Read on if you like...http://bunksoutdoorangle.com/misses-fishes/ Bunk."
5480282,kzoofisher,2017-04-17 14:42:00,5144,Good read and congratulations on your happy marriage.
5480714,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-17 17:48:00,447,Nice tribute.
5481466,fishpoop,2017-04-17 21:53:00,630,"You are a very blessed man, as I'm sure you're aware. I wish you and Brenda many years of fishing happiness together. This blog about Brenda is a wonderful tribute to her and to your love for her. I'm at a loss here for what to say or how to say it. You see, our stories have similarities. My wife, Mary, was my fishing partner too. I taught her to fish as she'd never held a fishing rod in her life before meeting me. Mary was in her 30's by then, rather later in life to start. Like your Brenda, she became an avid fisherwoman. Though we didn't get to the remote wilderness that you have, nor fish as many species that you two have, we went all over Minnesota and N.W. Ontario on fishing trips. She was a firm believer in conservation and had her own membership in Muskie's Inc rather than a family membership because she wanted to do her part to support conservation. She even beat me by catching the biggest fish. Mary, like Brenda, had some Native American blood in her background but not enough to qualify for tribal recognition. I lost Mary to brain cancer June 23, 2004. I've gone fishing without her but it's a struggle. The happiest times of my life were spent in a boat with her. Now every time I'm on the water something seems missing because there is. So, Mr. Moosebunk, I say to you; enjoy every precious moment on the water with your Brenda. The two of you are truly blessed."
5482722,labsrus,2017-04-18 10:07:00,557,Very nice article and great pictures I too have been blessed with a wife who likes to fish Enjoy it
5482818,Larbo,2017-04-18 10:37:00,231,Lucky Man. Nice catch!
5483386,HeHooksHimself,2017-04-18 13:47:00,725,"Well done, Moose. She is a beautiful lady in many ways and you are a very lucky man. As your 10th anniversary is in your rear view mirror, here is hoping for a full life and many more. We go to Canada in 30 days and I will hoist one in the honor of you and Brenda! Fish On! Hooks"
5483498,Juls,2017-04-18 14:27:00,13414,"A ""Charmed Life""...indeed! Great story and beautiful pictures! To be truthfully honest, I envy her fishing experiences .... You both are very blessed."
5484514,Moosebunk,2017-04-18 22:25:00,211,"Thanks for taking the time to read this latest story guys. You have no idea the brownie points I've scored with the missus for this too. Cool man! Good luck too Hooks!Quote: Originally Posted by fishpoopYou are a very blessed man, as I'm sure you're aware. I wish you and Brenda many years of fishing happiness together.

You've kinda left me at a loss for words, I can only say sorry for the loss of your loved one and also the loss of something loved in your life and fishing. It would be quite hard to imagine this. She sounded like the perfect partner. So many men, husbands, anglers don't share the same at all with their spouses so it makes those of us who do or have, that much more fortunate."
5484538,fishpoop,2017-04-18 23:35:00,630,"Mr. Moosebunk: Thank you for your kind words and sympathy. They're appreciated. However, I and my story isn't what is important here in this thread, Brenda and you are. My reason for sharing my story is to remind you and Brenda not to take your fishing adventures for granted. Treat each adventure as special because... one can never be sure when they'll end. That's a hard thing to say and to read, I'm sure. But from what I can see, from your blog about Brenda, you already realize this. I wish the two of you many many years of fantastic fishing adventures. This season is about to start, now go buy her a new rod and reel as a gift. She deserves it."
