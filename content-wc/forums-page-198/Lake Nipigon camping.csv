5483370,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-18 13:43:00,447,Planning a primitive camping trip on Nipigon for 2018. Anyone have GPS coordinates for a good camp site in McIntyre? Public responses are great but feel free to PM me if you prefer. Thanks

Pretty sure that was the lake he was talking about, but could be wrong. May ask him."
