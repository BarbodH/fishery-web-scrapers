5500897,Golden Eagle,2017-04-26 07:58:00,2642,I've seen lots of chickens along the road from Fort Frances to Dryden. A combination fishing/hunting trip should be easy to find. Find a camp with lots of hunting acreage available and grouse will be there. Here's one:http://timberwolflodge.org/

As it turned out he spent far more time hunting, it was that good.He's a really avid hunter and has traveled all over Canada, and the time he spent there he said was the best grouse hunting he's ever experienced. Huge numbers of uneducated birds. Not just ruffed grouse and spruce grouse, but surprisingly large numbers of sharptails too.There's an endless number of bush trails that you can walk around that camp. I realize it's further than you mentioned in your post but thought it might be worth mentioning.https://lowertwinlakes.com/"
