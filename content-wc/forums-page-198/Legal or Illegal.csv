Spinshot / Jig acting as the Drop shot weight at the bottom? 2 Spinshots / Jig acting as the Drop shot weight at the bottom? Rapala with 3 treble hooks? Jig with a stinger treble? I am guessing all are legal, but the spin shots are the real question to me? Thanks! b-"
5502129,Ricky Spanish,2017-04-26 15:07:00,1298,"In my opinion, all are legal. As far as I can tell, no more than four hooks per line, or lure, is the law. A treble hook (multipoint hook in the regs) counts as one hook. See page 8: https://dr6j45jk9xcmk.cloudfront.net...-english-1.pdfJust tell the conservation officer I said you're good, if you want to try the spinshot with a jig as your dropper. I almost always never lie."

5503306,bthomas3333,2017-04-27 05:55:00,465,I take it this has been discussed before. Before I posted I did a search on Spinshot and didn't see anything. Reading between the lines I take it that it is viewed as illegal by the MNR but some folks here disagree.B-
