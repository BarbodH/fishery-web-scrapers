5516450,nsideirish,2017-05-02 08:32:00,4,"Thanks for all the information provided so far. We are flying out of Rusty Meyer's place. We were told it was a busy flying out date and they did not have a lot of openings so 7 AM was suggested. I will perhaps see if they have something more towards noon so we can spend the night somewhere around Duluth. However, I think we are given second-class treatment because we are not actually staying at a Rusty Meyers camp. Rather, we are headed somewhere that just uses Rusty Meyers service as a third party service to its camp."

It happened at 9pm 50 miles outside Duluth. I try not to drive at night anymore. In 2008 we got in late ,7 pm from a fly-in and had to drive all night to get back to Duluth for a flight .We left Armstrong and on the trip from Armstrong to Thunder Bay saw numerous Deer ,Bear and a couple of Moose.made it back in time for our flights, but I try not to drive at night anymore This year I will be flying into Thunder Bay from Las Vegas, getting in around noon, picking up a rental car driving to Ignace staying ,overnite meeting friends in the morning and then leaving for Pickle lake around noon In my opinion its definitely better to drive on the 17 instead of the 502. Its also a lot easier crossing the border at Pidgeon River ."
5516962,Pooch,2017-05-02 10:06:00,4618,"Rusty Meyers flies into a bunch of other camps, so I doubt the second class thing. I'd rather be first in the morning flying out than later in the day. I know they fly into Seseganaga resort, sometimes Wildewood, Cliff and Roma's and Cat Track. I'm sure there are others, too.Consider staying in Ignace the night before. With a 7 Am time, I'd look at the Northwoods Inn in Ignace. Hour and a half (or so) to Rusty Meyers place.Who's camp you folks headed for?Pooch"
5517490,nsideirish,2017-05-02 12:22:00,4,We are headed to Barrington Lake Lodge a bit east of Savant Lake. It is a new camp. Owner purchased it a year ago from a previous private American owner. No roads to the lake so you can either train or fly in. We went with the fly-in service for the experience and that's how we got set up with Rusty Myers.
5514490,nsideirish,2017-05-01 14:15:00,4,"We have a trip planned for July flying out of Savant Lake at 7AM on Saturday, July 15. Our current plan is to depart Chicago at 3PM, get to the border crossing at around 1AM which should put us in Savant Lake at around 7AM. A couple of questions: -How is the drive along US61 at night? We've made the (beautiful) drive a few times during the day but are there any hazards to be aware of while dark out? -How will the drive be along 17 to 599 be at night? I know the general consensus is that 502 is **** to drive at night with the curves, moose, hills, etc. but are there similar concerns for 17 to 599? I think by the time we get to Igace and make the turn north on 599, the sun will be out. So maybe the better question is how is 17 from Thunder Bay to Igace? There are four of us driving and we will be switching up drivers every few hours but we are a bit concerned about the potential wildlife along 17/599. How does the route compare to the infamous 502?"
5514546,Bill Krejca,2017-05-01 14:38:00,6107,"We used to drive all Friday night to get to Nakina in mid-day. After dark, the road from Duluth up until north of Thunder Bay was full of deer. We finally started leaving Friday morning and spending the night, rather than drive so much in the dark. Heading west, I'd imagine similar sights. Bill"
5514626,Low4fish,2017-05-01 15:19:00,37,For sure the best road is 17 to Ignace. It's the Trans Canada highway. Much easier drive. Mostly flat stretches and wide shoulders. Going 502 from pigeon river seems to be some back tracking compared to 17 Shabaqua to Ignace and north to savant. There is not much open on the highway so make sure you fuel up before leaving tbay. The tower in Ignace may be open. Good luck.Sent from my SGH-I317M using Tapatalk
5514674,Low4fish,2017-05-01 15:33:00,37,Since you say you are flying assuming you are not pulling a boat. 2.5 hours from Tbay to Ignace. I have not seen a moose on that road for a few years. But they can be anywhere. Pay close attention around Upsala and English river. More of an issue heading north to Savant. Gets light before 6 00 am at that time of year. There will be deer south of Tbay to the border so watch out for those. Sent from my SGH-I317M using Tapatalk
5514690,bthomas3333,2017-05-01 15:50:00,465,"I really REALLY don't like the idea of driving long stretches at night in remote areas. The wildlife rules the night and I would rather not ""interact"" with animals at 100 kph. We had a very scary near miss about 10 years ago that shut that all down. We now drive / stay over / get up early and finish the drive in the light.Brett"
5514954,Fishoil,2017-05-01 17:29:00,1277,"I gave up the night driving a long time ago after hitting a deer. In all fairness I hit one in the daytime once too. You will see plenty of deer along the northshore from Duluth to Thunder Bay and we usually see moose on 17 between T-Bay and Ignace during the day, 599 has even more. If you have a choice I'd drive during daylight and spend a night along the way. If not, I hope you're lucky and stay safe."
5516130,Skywagon,2017-05-02 07:25:00,1106,"The moose population is so low now, I would rather take my chances possibly see a moose, or two driving 502 at night (few deer up that stretch), than taking the road along Superior where there will be scores of deer (or at least used to be). We came back home from the States on 502 last night, drove the last 1/2 hour in the dark, saw 2 moose and felt blessed to see those rare animals. There is a reason many of the road trucks in this part of the world have cow catchers in front of their grills......"
5516218,Pooch,2017-05-02 07:39:00,4618,"Avoid 502 like the plague at night. Much easier trip from Illinois to Ignace going through Pigeon River, take the back road bypass around TB to 17 then to Ignace.Trans-Canadian between TB and Ignace is good road, but we see Moose along there every year and we drive it in the daytime. Three years ago wife and I were nearly in an accident when a Moose stepped out in front of a semi headed west on 17 just east of Ignace on the down hill into town. We had just pulled onto 17 from 599 and headed east towards TB and home. Moose casually stepped over the steel barrier in front of a cab over headed into Ignace. Driver locked up the brakes and we started for the ditch to avoid the truck and give him somewhere to go. Moose was about eye level with the driver as I got a good look at both up close. So friggin close! Wow. Moose didn't seem rattled at all. Truck driver?Hitting a deer is one thing hitting a moose will be a totally different outcome.If you have to drive at night. Everyone in the car has to be awake and have their radar on. Watch the tree line and ditches like a hawk. Moose do not show up in the dark at all.Where are you heading? There is a town of Savant Lake and there is a lake called Lake Savant. About the only flying service in that area anymore is Rusty Meyer's place just before the town and just as you get to the road maintenance shed. I think they are actually on the north end of Sturgeon?Be safe and have a great trip.Pooch"
5516226,Pooch,2017-05-02 07:44:00,4618,"You guys don't road hunt at night? I'll shine, you shoot sort of thingy.Then again your poor wife would be up all night gutting and cleaning. And that would probably slow down or delay her wood gathering and splitting chores.Any fresh crappies?Pooch"
5516394,Lake Wisconsin,2017-05-02 08:22:00,1960,"I took 502 up in the fall 2 years ago for a hunt/fish combo trip. With the light ending early in the day, and due to our schedule, I did not really have a choice but to travel during the dark. To help, I added a pretty good sized light bar in my grill for added light with the moose. It lit up the ditches so I could actually see the animal, not just the eyes. We had to slow down a few times, but never had even a close encounter. This will not fix the situation that something pops out from the woods, but I found 85% of the animals are eating in the ditch line. I feel this has greatly reduced my likelihood of a collision. Just need to remember to turn them off when approaching vehicles are coming. They are blinding."
