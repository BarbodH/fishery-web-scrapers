Always looking for the next adventure I'm thinking about doing a fall fishing and hunting trip this year up there. If you have any ideas or experience please share Usually I take a week off for bowhunting in Wisconsin or rifle hunting in northern Minnesota, but the thought of having a lake in the middle of nowhere to catch fish and hunt bears has always been a dream of mine. Any thoughts or ideas of where to start looking? -Thanks Guys! -Brandon Meyer"

In some ways this is a solo trip, there will some mornings and any rainy days that will be solo outtings. One thing for sure, this year I will win the first and biggest fish pools!! Probably not a big pot though!"

Also a week might be a little short if you are going to set out your own baits and get them coming in. Hope you come and get one, we have too many, not a positive for the moose population."
