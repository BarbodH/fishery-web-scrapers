1849425,Papa eye,2013-06-08 21:31:00,124,We used to sell them from our gas bar. In saskatchewan we made $1 per licence. It was a strictly a service to those buying gas. Not sure how Ontario works.
1853778,fshfktry,2013-06-10 14:30:00,6,WalleyeDaveThe licenser only make $1.00 per license or less that I recall. They are relying on people purchasing more and offer them as a convenience to fishermen/hunters. With the new licensing system they have to purchase the equipment which is expensive.
1855745,wallydave,2013-06-11 07:47:00,2151,"Thanks for the info, I hoped the ""hit"" would not be a big loss to their bottom line. We still stop at Dutchies for beer, a t-shirt or two and Cuban cigars. We just don't wait in line to get the licenses!"
1823785,revitup,2013-05-31 03:30:00,140,"We are fortunate to be having my nephew join our group for our trip June 8-15. He would need to get both license/outdoor card. Everyone else in the group has already gotten theirs. Is it best for him to buy both online and carry proof of outdoor card,since he won't get his card by the time he leaves? Or is it best to stop somewhere on the way? If stopping, where would be best? We will have breakfast in Ft Frances on Saturday,June 8. We will be driving through Ft. Frances, Dryden, and Vermilion Bay. Thanks everyone."
1823809,wallydave,2013-05-31 04:09:00,2151,"Rev, when you go on-line to buy both the card and license, you can print out a paper version for both! The card would be the only thing that would come in the mail. Keep both paper printouts for with them as proof. Congrats on the new member and showing one more person how breathtaking a trip North can be!http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...ish/index.htmlHeres the link! Have a great trip!Dave"
1823953,Pooch,2013-05-31 06:00:00,4619,This late you might be as well off stopping at nearly any bait shop and getting license and outdoor card. Would save time to try to get it online before and print them out. Make a couple copies.I carry both in a small ziplock in the bottom of my tackle box so they don't get lost.Pooch
1826177,epiepenburg,2013-05-31 19:01:00,365,"You can print a temp copy of the outdoor card, this is what I did last year, no issues with that at all."
1826721,Terwalleye,2013-06-01 01:29:00,166,Safe to say that if you stop at a bait shop they aren't giving you a permanent Outdoor card anyhow. I am sure they jus print off the same thing.
1826793,wallydave,2013-06-01 05:14:00,2151,"Ever since I started buying the card and license online, I have wondered if the bait shops are losing income? Does anyone know what if any of the cards or license fees goes to the business that sells them?"
1826929,guidedfishing,2013-06-01 07:05:00,531,"really what ever is convenient, its all the same. good luck"
1826977,wallydave,2013-06-01 07:48:00,2151,"Since the numbers are down in most cases in Ontario, any lost income for bait shops could have an impact on their bottom line. They count on our business, I just wondered if online sales hurt their business."

1827473,revitup,2013-06-01 12:14:00,140,"Thanks guys. He's going to get it online. He has his passport and got his flight from Portland Oregon to Minneapolis.
