We are on a perfect spawning bay with many catches over the years of some big fish. Weather has been great for the last week. No rain, sunny. Thoughts on where to start? The big northerns are still in the bay I guess, meaning the water is still pretty cold. We are hoping they start to move in, out, or at least bite."

Guests have had to fish slow to catch the walleyes. Also we've noticed May flies starting a bit so then the fish will be in the shallow mud bays and will hit about a foot off the bottom and not right on bottom like you would normally catch your walleye."
