1858537,Tonyo,2013-06-12 05:07:00,212,"Just a quick note from last week. The fishing was great from Saturday to Wednesday and good on Thursday and Friday. The weather was great, too good to be honest. Low 80's all week, no wind and no clouds. Here are a couple of pictures from the week.The walleye was a 25 12"", Norther #1 was 34 1/2"" with a 16"" walleye in his mouth and we netted them both, Northern #2 my 13 year old caught was 35 1/2"".Hope everyone else has a great trip north this year.TonyO"

1857369,REG,2013-06-11 15:17:00,445,"The weather and fishing were both incredible last week. We were at Snake Falls Camp on Pakwash. Here are a couple just to give you an idea... And not sure if anyone else who was up north last week happened to look up after 11pm on Thursday night, but the Northern Lights put on a show like we've never seen before. (unfortunately no pictures of those) They lit up the entire sky! First time we've seen them in June and have never seen them fill the sky and move so fast!"
1857401,Pikeslayer8,2013-06-11 15:26:00,1460,"Yea, it seem that the lights were right above us. We didn't really have the striking colors like I've seen before. Way too cool!"
1858457,RoughWaters,2013-06-12 00:47:00,98,Some nice looking fish guys!
