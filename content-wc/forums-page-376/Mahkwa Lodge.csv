1543179,Guest,2013-02-25 16:23:00,0,"Been going to Mahkwa for 8 years straight. The guys I go with have been going for 15. We rent one of the cabins and bring our own food, etc. plus we bring 2 of our own boats and rent 2 from them. Be sure to check your boat out top to bottom including the prop. They like to find things wrong and charge you for them. Sometimes they don't run very well either. There are life jackets, an oar, and that's about it. Be sure and get a spare gas can (1 gallon) from them. May need it. Vaughn opens on the 15th. We used to go early June until they closed Vaughn. We schuffled back to around the 15th so we could fish Vaughn."
1543233,Pooch,2013-02-25 17:45:00,4619,"This fall will be my sixth trip to Mahkwa with another group from the cities. Always have stayed in the larger cabins. This fall we might split the group and us a smaller cabin, too. Anyone have any housekeeping side photos of the cabins and the interiors of the smaller four man cabins? Somebody said they were pretty tough shape.The new road was great last fall. Hope it holds up.Thoughts? Photos?Pooch"

1853274,jheimsch,2013-06-10 11:41:00,38,"We are going for third year. We take our own boat. Take anything you need for the boat!!! Anchor, net. trolling motor, cooler, charger. Bring night crawlers!!! Boats have nothing extra. American plan is great--fishing great--dock good. John"

As I've posted many of times, this will be my 13th year fishing LacSeul, all of them at SWWL and I can't see myself ever venturing elsewhere. 77 days until I'm on the water."

1422429,ILBassman,2012-04-17 17:01:00,16,"I am making my first trip into Canada the first week of June, staying at SWWL. What is the one thing you wished you had brought with you on that first trip? what is the one thing you brought the first couple of years and say ""why did i bring it I never need it""?"
1423534,Jigger1,2012-04-19 18:06:00,234,"Well if you ever saw the Cabela’s Super Magnum tackle box you’ll understand what I regret bringing on my first trip to SWWL. Fully loaded I might as well have had a dolly to haul that thing around. Since I was driving at the time, I came fully loaded with every conceivable walleye setup you could imagine. Plugs, bottom bouncers, slip bobbers, jigs of every possible type, hooks, sinkers, spoons. Seriously I could have almost set up shop and started a retail outlet on the dock. I think that entire trip all I used were jig heads, that's it. I am now refined down to a very specific set of jigs (mainly focused 1/8-3/8oz in size), bottom bouncers with crawler and minnow harnesses and some plastics. I still bring a few crank baits and spoons just in case the pike or bass bite is on, but because I fly now, it all fits in my backpack. Plus if I’m missing something, or something is hot, Mike has a selection of productive lures right there in the lodge. The second thing was equipment. On my first trip I was lucky enough to catch a 29” fat walleye but quickly realized (thanks Cory) that my equipment wasn’t geared for this kind of quality fishing. At any time on this body of water you have the chance at catching the fish of a lifetime, more than once my equipment has been the cause of failure so I chose to minimize this risk and invested in a Loomis Walleye series jigging rod, I now own three Loomis rods, one for jigging, one for bouncing and another for casting. They are used in that order as well, with casting being used very infrequently. They fit in my rod case so I bring them all for flexibility. Lastly I had crappy rain gear my first year, I now own Guidewear and love it. When LacSeul picks up, sometimes the boat ride can be as wet as a downpour. Keep an eye on Mike’s reports as he’ll let you know what’s going on through his fishing report. We should probably start a new thread under SWWL if you want more info, I’m sure many guests, IA Walleye being another would jump right in."

1425653,tv4fish,2012-04-24 08:53:00,2694,"Jigger1: That IS about all one really needs, kinda depends on how strong the wind is --- put a crawler or leech or minnow on and you WILL catch'em."
1425851,Jigger1,2012-04-24 14:31:00,234,"tv4fish  I would tend to agree with you, my jigging rod is bar none my go to, however last year we went on a streak with plastics that was just phenomenal. Between two boats, fishing 2 to a boat with a guide we landed over 80 walleyes over 24 in two days, this included 8 over 27 fishing exclusively with plastics. During that streak we put 170 in the boat over the slot. I was on my bottom bouncing rig pulling a 6 gulp worm and the rest of the guys were ripping 3/8 to 1/2oz jigs fast with either 4 white ripple mullets or 4 chartreuse jerk shads. It was a blast, but conditions can and will determine what's working on any given day."
1426266,tv4fish,2012-04-25 09:52:00,2694,"Jigger: If they are hitting fast and furious (we fish 3 to my boat and have had many ""triples"")- and you just can't bait up fast enough - I will put on a gulp minnow or gulp leech because they will ""stay on"" longer/better. Nothing but ""fun and excitement"" when that happens ."
573087,Guest,2008-04-24 14:29:00,0,"Going to Mahkwa lodge for Father's day weekend (June 12th thru 15th). I have been to other lodges on Lac Seul, Lost Island Lodge and Evergreen, and wondering if anyone has any insight on Mahkwa. We will be renting boats, and besides depth finders and life jackets do we need to bring any other boating equip? Looks like they kinda skimp on the boating accessories. Any other info or insights on this place would be very much appreciated. Can't wait to get on Lac Seul again, excited to be actually on actual main portion of the lake. Does Vaughan lake open the 14th or the 15th, regs says closed Jan 1st - June 14th. Guessing opens on the 15th. Thanks"
573106,mwal,2008-04-25 12:25:00,151,"This will be my 6th season at Mahkwa. I use my own boat. I would bring a net, anchor,minnow bucket, fish locator, cooler for fish and an electric motor and battery if you like to slow troll. Remember Lac Suel dosn't allow stringers all fish must be killed if you are keeping it. We have had good luck in that area of the lake but we go up for 4th of July. Mwal"
573108,schick,2008-04-25 15:51:00,35,"We are entering our 4th year at Mahkwa Lodge. We take our own boat, but they do appear to have good rental boats. We very much enjoy staying at Mahkwa. The food is usually outstanding if you are purchasing the American Plan of Modified American Plan (which I strongly recommend). The cabins on the American/Modified Plan side of the bay are excellent and clean. The staff is pretty laid back, but easy to talk to. There is plenty of great fishing around the Lodge. As you probably know you only boat a half mile or so from the landing to the cabins. I will warn you that the boat landing is pretty rough, but Mahkwa has a nice set of docks and power to charge your batteries. You will not be disappointed staying at Mahkwa. I stayed at Chamberlain Narrows for 3 trips, but I did not like the 35 mile boat trip nor the rude service. We go early (the last week of May). NEPiker"
573118,Guest,2008-04-25 20:33:00,0,"Cannot comment on Mahkwa, as I have never stayed there, but its just east of the lodge we stay at by about 10 - 12 miles (SWWL). We will be there this year from June 14 - 21. You will enjoy the fishing in the area. From what I understand, Vaughn will open June 15 (but check the regs to be sure). I have not fished that in a number of years because its just too long of a ride from SWWL and you pass by water that holds fish on the way there. I would recommend you check out the SWWL website and read their fishing reports (they have several years worth posted). By checking out a couple of years of reports for the time frame you are going you can figure out what you need to do from a fishing perspective. I could give you my insights, but I am no pro. I will say that at that time of the year, I would work the wind blown points/shorelines starting in 7 feet of water and working deeper until you hit fish. Everything will depend on the weather and this year it might be a slightly later spring than normal. Also the water level matters and I think this year is suppose to be normal to slightly above normal. Jigs and spinners are what 99% of people use on LS at that time of the year, but don't overlook tossing a crank which allows you to pick up more northerns and bass for a variety of excitment. Cheers... IA Walleye"

1207653,J.Iverson,2010-06-06 20:50:00,64,"Last summer they opened a road right to Mahkwa so you no longer have to bother with Archies Landing. They also put in their own boat landing at the resort too. We have been staying there since the early 90's and have always rented a cabin. I would like to try staying in their resort and trying their American plan since some of the members in our party last year decided some of the cabins are in need of some TLC and the gals didn't like hearing the mice in the walls at night. Great fishing location, you'll love it."
1207714,JDP,2010-06-07 06:47:00,1457,"Since '05 I have stayed at Mahkwa Lodge in a housekeeping cabin for a week in May (either opening week or the 2nd week of Walleye season, this year it was May 22-29).The boat ramp at the Lodge has been improved from rock to concrete. As the lake water level rises through the season launching and retrieving boats will become very easy.The Lodge is working to improve the smaller housekeeping cabins. This year there is a newly rebuilt (I believe a 2 bedroom cabin, cabin number 5). There are 3-3 bedroom cabins (numbers 11, 12 and 14) that are in excellent condition. My group is 8 or 9 people each year. We like the 3 bedroom cabins as there are 2 bathrooms each with a shower."
1207983,walleyeduran,2010-06-07 21:33:00,286,Does anybody know if they have a web site. A few years back I call them a couple of times to check out renting a cabin and talked with the person at the desk. She took my name and number and said that the person in charge would get back to me but they never did. Looking for info. for a Summer trip. Duran
