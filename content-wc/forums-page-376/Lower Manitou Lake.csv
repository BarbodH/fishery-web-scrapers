1822593,GNO,2013-05-30 16:25:00,153,"Manitou has some big muskie. Camp Manitou is located in good muskie water and you can avoid the big lake if windy. Lots of good muskie water from the landing all the way up the stretch. They also have an excellent portage lake loaded with 35-40"" muskie. The entire system is remote."
1822729,J. Merics,2013-05-30 17:32:00,32,"thank's GNO. Are there quality pike in the watershed? by quality I mean in the 15-20lb. class or are they uncommon?How is the pressure around Camp Manitou and Esox Lake with the access point being there? ( I would plan my trip early September) and is the entrance into Dogfly navigable?I see that the Manitou's are on my Navionics Canada chip. Do you know if it is fairly reliable?Thanks for the feedback, I appreciate it."
1823457,Outfitter17,2013-05-30 20:44:00,127,"Hi Jay,We have the occasional 15lb-20lb in the system, you are talking a 37""-41"" fish. They are not common on the main lake, we do however have a few portage lakes that you can boat a few in that range on the right day, especially in September. There isn't much pressure down in Esox or the stretch especially in the fall, most people think they need to run up to the big lake. Esox has some great muskie water that people tend to drive right past. We fish both the main lake and esox, so it's nice to be right in the middle.Dogfly is a portage lake that we have a boat on, you can't navigate into it.The navionics chip is dead on, from what i can tell. I have been running it for 5 years and it has all the rocks marked that I have found."

1849329,Guest,2013-06-08 20:43:00,0,"Lower Manitou gets very little fishing pressure due to the lack of walleye in my opinion. In Seprember there will be very few boats on a huge system of lakes and bays. . It is a clear water lake with good size musky. Multiple 50's from our camp in the Manitou. (beaverhead). they are difficult to boat but typically have 5-7 follows per day. My best week is 9 fish but many weeks of zero also. pike in the 15-20 pound range are uncommon although we did boat a 41 inch pike 2 weeks ago.(released). I did stay at the weather station for a week last year when our camp was in use and found it to be first rate. Beautiful cabins, modern with all the facilities. Kris and keri lynn were gracious hosts willing to share information and although we were housekeeping we did one dinner with them and one shore lunch and it was good. Bass fishing is excellent, I like glass bay for Bass. It is known for its lake trout but I don't usually target them. Navionics map has every rock marked that I know of as the above outfitter stated. I have not been to camp Manitou nor fished much up in that area but I am sure it would be productive too. All in all the Manitou is beautiful, remote and has pretty good fishing. PS a few walleye up around the Moser bay area but very few."
