1840313,JayM5209,2013-06-05 14:24:00,1050,"wolf, your experience last week was not unique for the area. I was just down the road 8 or 10 miles south of Perrault Falls for the week and the walleye fishing was the slowest we've experienced for more than twenty years. Six guys fished five different lakes and didn't catch more than 20 eaters for the week, plus several dozen smaller 'eyes. The most reliable walleye lake we've fished over the past 35 years produced six eater 'eyes. Pictures from our camp's fish house the week before showed it to be one of the most productive walleye weeks in recent years. I think the 'eyes spawned while the cabin was being cleaned for our arrival!! Just the luck of the draw - next trip will be entirely different.On the other hand, lake trout fishing was the best we've had in many, many years, both numbers and size. Didn't matter what lure you used so long as it was blue. We found the trout in the top 10' both very shallow and holding high over deep water. All three trucks in our convoy were waved past the fish check just before Ft. Francis and the no wait crossing southbound at 10:30 am Saturday consisted of ""Where ya coming from? Bringing anything beside fish? Have a good day."" Maybe 45 seconds, tops.Except for the non-stop rain Thursday am thru Saturday, another great week in NWO! Can't wait to get back in September."
1840937,vteye,2013-06-05 17:46:00,812,I posted under the Nakina fly in thread as Onetimedave went into Melchett and we went into Kayedon. Conditions were difficult andfirst four days if we had not fished close to 50 hours would not havehad supper. Supper was 50/50 pike and walleyes and then the weather broke.
1841209,Guest,2013-06-05 19:27:00,0,wallhanger I don't feel so bad now because after 35-40 trips I think our group knows how to fish walleyes;a group of 5 from indiana the prior week told me they caught over 300 walleyes for the week and even left me a marked map of areas to fish which we did faithfully;hopefully things will be better in september at woman river lodge thanks for comments and please keep posting great job on the lake trout jim wolf chicago boys
1841281,wallydave,2013-06-05 19:53:00,2151,Hey James is your group going to Black Bear in August? Let me know if things work out! Dave
1842049,Guest,2013-06-06 05:21:00,0,dave we actually have a group of 6 going to woman river camp mid september (fished there last year same time) but this time going to stay at outpost cabin rather than main camp;we found out the hard way last year that the best fishing in the main river chain and portage lakes are approximately 22 miles north of main camp;and the outpost camp is only 5 miles from the good fishing areas will report on september trip and plan on black bear camp next year with the meals and price it has great value jim wolf chicago boys
1842193,HeHooksHimself,2013-06-06 06:28:00,725,"Being a big fan of Wine Lake, I feel compelled to respond to Wof's posting. I feel a little responsible because it was my suggestion that they would have a successful trip and enjoy the experience. It was my group that was there the previous week and we absolutely slayed the walleye. In fact, we chose to troll for trout late in the week just for some variety. Being a fan of opening week I have experienced the post-spawn lull. It is not unique to WLC as any veteran will attest, but it is usually only a few days.Wine Lake Camp is a unique experience. In order to find a remote location, at times you have to surrender other things. In my opinion it is like ""rustic plush."" Yes there is a showerhouse and outhouses that are sometimes quite a hike from your cabin, but the cabins are in great repair and solar lighting is almost complete in all the cabins. The shower house is clean and the water is almost always hot, but if more than one is showering the flow can be slow. Herb takes great care with his boats and the 16' lunds with 25 hp Yamahas perform well with little trouble. Jim mentioned he thought the rates were a little high but if you consider that Herb must bring in gas by pumping it over the portage, you understand why they might need to charge more.Regarding ""unhelpful"" owners, I would have to disagree. Essentially, fish are everywhere. Of course they move and you might have to hunt them down. Unfortunately for Herb, he doesn't have much time to fish and doesn't bleed the fishermen for information. Our expereince is that everyone finds their ""honey hole"" and tends to frequent the same areas. I think their outlook might be that you will be successful, but the hunt is part of the experience. We have fished other places, including Woman River Camp. Paul at WRC is great and very helpful. We also are fond of Deb and him, but the fishing is much tougher there from our experience.So, bottom line. WLC is not for everyone and I don't think the cabin that Wolf was in was the most suitable, but we (mostly in our 60's) will be there for next year's opener.side note: We have been going to WLC for 13 years and have become friends with the owners, but in no way have any stake in this operation."
1842289,Mohleye,2013-06-06 06:55:00,368,"I've talked to other people who were in NWO that week and had very tough fishing, even on lakes they were familiar with. I can imagine on new water it would have been a tough week. Wolf, just so you're aware, the facilities at the WRC outpost cabin will be similar to what you describe at Wine Lake.....outhouse, shower house,etc."
1844913,Guest,2013-06-06 21:27:00,0,"Jim Fished the same week up the road at Lac Suel. Sun - Tuesday. Stayed @ Goose Bay and fished in Sawmill bay. We caught all the fish in 2-6' of water. Water temps low 60's in the bays and Main lake mid 50's. water level average for this time of the year. Had 3 in the boat and had our limit of 16-17"" fish by noon every day. Most of the fish were caught on jigs but did use crank baits to catch a few when jig fishing slowed down. Gas @ vermillion bay was 1.44 ltr. Fish a lake till you learn the patterns then enjoy the fishing! Fish on... Mike"
