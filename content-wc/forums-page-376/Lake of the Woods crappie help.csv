I know how to catch them in Indiana but not up north. Where would they be this time of year? Depth, structure or any kind help would be much appreciated. Down to 91 hours. Everyone be safe and have greats trips"
1852026,Obabikon,2013-06-10 04:45:00,2370,"I would suggest hiring a guide. The crappies right now would be in spawning locations (which are for the most part annual). If a guide isn't an option, you can try trees that have fallen by the bank but stick out 15+ feet into the water."
1852442,steve.a,2013-06-10 07:43:00,274,Do they spawn in the shallow reeds?
1852642,Guest,2013-06-10 08:40:00,0,"Smallmouth Hunter coming thur eagle pass form big stone bay into moore bay, turn left go appox 500 yard and look for a small point creating a litte bay area (not to large) maybe 1 acre in size. Been catching them in that lillte pocket for years. You probably dont know pipe lake location but that end of moore bay holds lots of crappie. good luck on this years trip, Route Bay resident."
1852762,Obabikon,2013-06-10 09:04:00,2370,"Sometimes... they spawn in shallow, but will still remain relatively close to trees and food sources. We're catching a TON of them off our crappie dock right now. You can hardly flip a jig in the water without getting a strike."

Have read about decent Crappie fishing in White Partridge Bay East of Clearwater but haven't ventured that far to explore that area in years past."
1853450,Smallmouth Hunter,2013-06-10 12:37:00,84,Pikepicker. Thanks. I have been to Pipe Lake twice. I will give your spot a try. I fish Route Bay also. Lots of nice smallmouth. Obabikon. Thanks for the tip and all of your posts. Dog. I guess I will see you there.
