1858641,joeman79,2013-06-12 05:53:00,417,Going to Sioux Narrows and renting a houseboat the first week of august. A few guys in the group want to mainly target Muskies and the rest walleyes. I would just like to ask the advice of you LOTW veterans on a few areas that you might target as possible anchorages within 6-8 hrs by Houseboat of Sioux Narrows. Our group does have some experience in the Flag Island area but that's along ways from where we will be. Thanks and any other Houseboat tips would be great also as it is our first time.
