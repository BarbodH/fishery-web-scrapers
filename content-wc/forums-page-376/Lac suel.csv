1851121,stjoeguy,2013-06-09 18:31:00,979,Check this site for water level: http://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html Click on Lac Seul under Water Levels & Flows. It appears to be on the high side of normal.

I've been trying pulling cranks around main lake islands and reefs with success but get same size fish as jigging just less numbers
1851209,stjoeguy,2013-06-09 18:45:00,979,"Sorry, I just fish Lake St. Joseph. There are a lot of Lac Seul guys on the site, however. I'm sure someone will help with some good info."

1851761,Pooch,2013-06-09 21:14:00,4619,"Would love to get a fishing report when you get back. We fish out of Mahkwa in the fall and stay on the housekeeping side in the larger cabins. If you stay on the house keeping side and use one of the smaller cabins could you post or email me some pictures on the interior? I'd like to take my wife, but not sure the small cabins would pass her muster!Have a great trip.Pooch"
1851817,Bkgilla,2013-06-09 21:34:00,6,I've actually stay mahkoons. Owned by roger the two cabins on left side of the bay before Mahkwa. Stayed at Mahkwa the first two or three years. But when roger built his first log cabin Mahkwa over booked and sent us to his cabin got a 28in eye off the dock and haved stayed there ever since. That is a small cabin with four beds and a hideabed we bring a air mattress and sleep 6 comfortly. As for the cabin it's a beautiful log cabin made by roger and his sons big windows over looking the lake for sunsets. Shower is pretty tiny. You get your own dock and fish cleaning house too. When the lakes to rough you can usually catch plenty off the dock. How's the fall fishing i have always wanted to try it?
1852042,Pooch,2013-06-10 04:50:00,4619,"Bk,Look at my photos. Lots of Smallmouth accidentally. Good numbers of slot fish and respectable numbers over the slot. Lots under the slot for eaters. Occasional Pike.Gotta go to work. Email me as I'd like to visit with you about Roger's cabin and the fishing in general.Pooch"
