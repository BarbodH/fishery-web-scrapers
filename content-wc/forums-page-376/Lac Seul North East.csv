1818097,LoDo,2013-05-29 13:06:00,721,"Strickly hearsay, but I have heard you'll catch muskie in Chamberlain Narrows too. Might as well practice the figure eight and see if you can land the ""fish of 10k casts""!"
1822905,rnnonmt,2013-05-30 18:25:00,992,"How far ""north"" are you planning?"
1824233,tsquared,2013-05-31 08:00:00,57,"staying in the narrows, not sure how far north we will go from there. We enjoy moving around a bit, so I imagine we will try quite a few spots in all directions. If you have any areas you recoomend up north, let me know. Feel free to PM too. Thanks"
1825305,milfish,2013-05-31 13:40:00,249,"Sounds like you're staying at lac Seul Outposts, unless you're houseboating. Kenny and Brenda and the staff will be very helpful. I've been going there for many years, but in the late fall. I imagine the basic spots like Pither Point, Birch Narrows and Scaler Lake should produce at any time of year. You're going to catch a bunch!"
1826993,djk50164,2013-06-01 08:08:00,370,Great area and lots of fish the rules we be the same as the other area's you have fished. PM me if you would like more info
1827809,jkoebel,2013-06-01 16:13:00,10,"We just got back yesterday from a week of fishing in Chamberlain Narrows. We houseboat it and had another great year. We noticed with the late ice out the fish were shallow. Our hot spots last year didn't hit on day one so we started to move to the shallow hot spots. It was a lot of fun casting in the shallows for walleye. Our total numbers were down a little from last year but we caught a lot more walleye this year over 25"". The weather was great... Sunny until we drove the boat back on Thursday which was misty and rainy."
1828265,Iowa Hawkeye,2013-06-01 21:05:00,90,"You will be a little too far north for smallies, the Taylor island area is good for small mouths. We fish the Chamberlin area and usually get 2 or 3 in a week, but aren't fishing for them. You will get a ton of wallies. Good Luck"
1856937,Bitinlight,2013-06-11 12:44:00,95,Fished Bear Narrows to Birch Narrows June 3-6. Numbers and size of walleyes outstanding. Found fish in 12-14 FOW.
