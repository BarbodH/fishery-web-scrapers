Most of the reports I have been reading lately are on threads dealing with certain lakes. Most of the reports on here are for NW Ontario. You just got look for 'em. You may even stumble across some good tidbits for bait, tackle etc in the process.Happy Reading"
1837553,LoDo,2013-06-04 18:53:00,721,"agree. I've been reading several. Im reading alot of Quebec and NE Ontario, NE Lac Seul, Sioux Lookout, etc... I'm looking for NW Lac Seul, Kenora, Minaki, Vermillon, Caribou Woodland Park, etc... I'll keep digging. Thanks!"
1837961,Limeyangler,2013-06-04 20:45:00,563,"well i aint saying which lake....but the water is still cold and multi species lakes are fishing well on large minnows straight jigged on 3/8oz jigs in 14' FOW. I have not been up to Lac Seul so far this year, but am planning to hit Wabigoon in search of crappie this week...will report as soon as i'm done trying to find 'em. Here is my video from Sunday, , best walleye was 30.5"", best pike 40"" and a few 25"" lakers and a couple small smallmouth all in the same spot or pretty close by. JIGS AND MINNOWS ARE YOUR FRIENDhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dykxhMMRBuc"

1846745,roscoe33,2013-06-07 14:07:00,653,"Upsala area lakes, Wawang area was iced over for the opener, opened up a few days after, huge trophy pike and eyes for 6 days, then they shut down, still slow and small this week. lac des Mille, west and central areas, ice was off 3 days before the opener, fishing was hot till the 24th, then really slowed to a crawl. Had to work for them, but managed to eat well. The fish should be settled into their ""normal"" spring locations in a week or two, as the water warms a bit, and the spawn is completed."
1846921,Duflebag,2013-06-07 15:37:00,218,"LoDo, Northwinds Outfitters posts Vermillion Bay area fishing reports on their facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/northwindsoutfitters They post for Eagle, Clay, Lac Seul and other lakes in the area. They have guides from other camps posting reports also."
