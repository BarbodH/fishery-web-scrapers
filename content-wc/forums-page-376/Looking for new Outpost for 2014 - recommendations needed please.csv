I wouldn't know what to do staying at such a nice place in the bush - the wife and I are use to no running water and outhouses. I showed my wife some of those ""cabins"" and she now has much higher expectations Although the prices aren't that high. Thanks everyone for the suggestions - looking into all of them"

Maybe my wife and I aren't very good anglers but I remember 10 plus years ago catching a lot more fish than recently. Looking for fly in outpost with more quantity than quality fishing, taking our two sons this time so want to catch more fish to keep them engaged. However, I do like to catch bigger pike - walleye aren't that important to me. Want to be the only cabin on lake, but a bush cabin is fine. I appreciate any recommendations - thank you."

Its a great walleye fishery, my dad flew in there a few times in the late 80's and mid 90's and it was outstanding back then. They have been total C+R for the past 5 years, except what you want to eat at the cabin. I would imagine with the C+R that the fishing is even better now then it was 20 years ago. From the stories and pictures, it was pretty darn good back then. The cabin looks nice and the boat look good."

1844185,Mike Borger,2013-06-06 17:23:00,1554,"Last week I fished a brand new outpost on the Attawapiskat river owned by Hearst Air not open to the general public yet. It's about 40km downstream from their existing camp on Pym Island. It was TRULY spectacular. Just sick numbers of huge pike over 40"" and giant walleye as well. We never targetted walleyes at all and still caught 4 over 30"" casting bucktails and numerous in the high 20's. It's without a doubt the experience of a lifetime. Hopefully in the next few days I'll put together a detailed report on the trip."
1844297,new hips,2013-06-06 18:16:00,498,"Check out Big Hook Camps, 100 walleye a day is easy."
1845521,gatorchaser1,2013-06-07 07:10:00,4,"Solo, can`t wait to hear all about the new outpost camp on the Attawapiskat ! We were at Pym last year and had a great trip and am looking to go back next year, so a new camp sounds really exciting, looking forward to the report."

1846225,Shawn Hurt,2013-06-07 10:31:00,4,"We fished Favourable Lake out of Big Hook Camps the end of June last year and caught A LOT of fish. The cabin sits b/t Favourable and Lemonade Lake. You can fish both. In about 2 hours of fishing Lemonade 4 of us caught close to 300 eyes. Nothing big, 15-20"". You could easily catch a 1000 fish over the weeks time if you just fished it. On Favourable we caught a total 20 pike 37"" or bigger with a 40""."
1847201,acplumber,2013-06-07 17:36:00,80,"We went for our first fly in with Leuenbergers . The fishing was amazing, cabin was good with hot shower(which were very nice on the rainy days). And the boats and motors were top notch. Prices were very good as well ."
