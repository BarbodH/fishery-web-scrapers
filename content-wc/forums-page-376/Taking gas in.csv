1845881,10point,2013-06-07 09:02:00,102,What experiences have you guys had at the border with gas? I've been told I can only can bring so much and once I had to pay a tariff. Last time they told me I too much and that I should have to pay a tariff but they didn't make me. I plan to take in 25 gallons when I cross next week.

1846769,Catman59,2013-06-07 14:13:00,345,I bring gas in the summer for the Lund and in the winter for the snowmobiles when we head up fishing. Never had a problem.
1847297,Fish_Heads,2013-06-07 18:28:00,154,"Been going up the past 12 years & only once had to pay them a buck a gallon duty for my (5) 6 gallon cans. I made the mistake of answering yes to the do you have any ""extra gas"" question.Now I just tell them the boat is full. (It really is.......boat turns into a utility trailer on the way up) & is ""Full"" of everything that won't fit in the truck !It's not like I'm carrying extra gas for sale or profit, I burn what I take up plus double that (purchased locally in Canada) every trip up.It's always about the $$.........."

1847977,keek,2013-06-08 05:36:00,1003,Like Fish Head said - I carried about 50 gallons of fuel in 6 gallon cans in the boat with a tarp on it. When asked what was under the tarp I list items including fuel for the boat. No issues (crossing in Quebec).Just be sure your trailer is up to hauling all that extra weight.
