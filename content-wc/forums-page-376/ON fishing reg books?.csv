1849937,Freytown,2013-06-09 08:21:00,770,With the cost of a non-resident permit and I can't get a reg book??? LOL give me a break.
1854194,camp chef,2013-06-10 17:44:00,915,I think the non-resident licenses are really quite reasonable.No complaints here. You can buy an 8 day conservation license for less than a case of beer.
1854282,Nimstug,2013-06-10 18:26:00,2605,"Most of us U.S. fisher types go to one general area / body of water. If you are lucky, maybe a second trip or third trip to a different area / body of water. The books had all of Ontario and I haven't looked for one since my first trip. The local bait shops your lodge owner, outfitter etc. will know what's up. If you really have to have the whole 100+ page book try:http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/...fd#/d1eb8afd/1 And for what's new for 2013:http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodcons...rod_101636.pdf"
1822169,Shellback,2013-05-30 14:39:00,8083,"Buy my licenses online and usually pick up a book at the town visitor center. This year I was told they received very few books due to reduction in expenditures. Checked with a bait shop too. Same story very few books. I know the books have advertisements in them which are paid for by the businesses. If I was an advertiser, I'd be ticked. You would expect your message to reach all fishermen, but then the govt doesn't produce enough books to distribute. Each place offered to make a copy of the regs for the zone I was in, so my hats off to them. A big thumbs down to DNR for not getting the books out to the stores when they take advertisers dollars."
1847585,betweentolakes,2013-06-07 20:39:00,5,yes this is a serious problem for us up here our mnr is so badly cut back theres even limits on how far our co's are allowed to drive there trucks best thing to do is look up reg's on the ministry of natural resources websitewe have customers coming to us asking for books we make copies of the regs for them in our own areas its the best we can do with what were given
1847681,115 optimax,2013-06-07 21:08:00,650,Most of the time they hop in the O.P.P boats for a free ride.
1848121,Moosebunk,2013-06-08 06:53:00,211,If fishing a certain area you could always go online and check out the regs there.....?
1848161,betweentolakes,2013-06-08 07:16:00,5,ya if you know the area your in do that because getting a book is next to impossible
1848217,adempsey,2013-06-08 07:57:00,963,"I always wondered why they did this considering they do in fact have product advertisements in them now. Guess it wasn't enough to keep it going. Just too many budget cuts to all public sectors here in Ontario now.It's all available online as .PDF's at least, so you can always print your own."
1848441,Freytown,2013-06-08 09:50:00,770,"I just return from Quebec and the outfitter didn't receive any rule books either. I did go online before my trip and print the regs for the zone I was fishing.I think if someone violated a law because they didn't receive a rule book, IMO, they would have a good argument before any judge. What do you folks from Canada think about this????"
1848489,betweentolakes,2013-06-08 10:12:00,5,"i would fight it,imo when a person comes to fish/hunt whatever from a different country spends money as tourist buys liceneses they should be given whatever rules/regs that come with what they are doing. yes i'm sure someone out there is thinking it s up it the person to know the laws but come on when people by a license give them a book!!"
1848633,GNO,2013-06-08 12:18:00,153,"You could fight it, but I would bet you would loose. It is up to you to know and if they are published online, they would be considered readily available IMO. I could be wrong, but I would not want to try my luck in court with the defense of no regulation book was available. I believe Ontario is actually making the shift to no reg books soon, just an online version."
1848665,J. Merics,2013-06-08 12:41:00,32,"that's right, it's you're responsibility whether you have a regs booklit or not.plenty of other ways to get the info. Lodge owners, tackle shops, internet or call the nearest MNR office."
