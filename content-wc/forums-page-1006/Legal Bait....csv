I read an earlier entry about a guy using left over walleye skin, can you do that considering it is a game fish? I was always taught that you couldn't, but maybe things have changed. Any info is appreciated. Keep your rod tip up.Thanks!Go_Fish"
513885,Guest,2001-07-13 05:38:00,0,One place I was at in Canada we were aloud to use perch as bait as long as they were dead and I know alot of guy's that use cut strips of sucker's for bait. What I would do is call the outfitter that you are going to be staying with and they will know or they should find out for you. GOOD FISHING!!!

513891,Guest,2001-07-16 03:15:00,0,"In Ontario it is illegal to use gamefish or any part there of as bait. Gamefish includes pearch as well as walleye, northern etc. Baitfish species are clearly defined in the regs. and include suckers,cisco and the minnow species on the list. Smelt cannot be used as bait in any form nor can they be brought into Ontario in any form to be used as bait. In those lakes that unfortionatly have had smelt introduced, they cannot be harvested for any reason to prevent there reuse as bait."
