Being a baasic tightwad, I haven't done it in the past. This year, I thought I got some extra service from day one. I had a couple of large containers of whole cashews along. I gave both of them a container of cashews. One guy was real happy, but I thought the guy thought I was cheap.What does everybosdy else do?"
514013,Guest,2001-07-19 17:41:00,0,"Better than a jab in the eye with a sharp stick. He should be thankful for anything, Check out the price for cashews!"
514014,Reels,2001-07-19 18:33:00,2876,"Depends on how he is. One year we had a kid that tied up the boat everytime as soon as you pulled up and would even take the fish out of the live well. Gas tank was allways full. I think I tipped him $30 US and some change at the end of the trip, the guy was truley amazing. Others guys who were average, maybe $5-10."
514015,duffy,2001-07-20 03:51:00,49,I always tip the dock guys. If they give great service I will give $30 for the week. If the service is okay I give $20. The place i go to the one guy drives you on argos to portage lakes and really works extremely hard so I give him a case of blue and $20.00. He loves me.Duffy

I guess the difference in some of the tips these guys are giving and with the camps I go to is I have a guide every day who is tipped well at the end of the week .He unloads the float plane when we arrive and depart not the pilot. Also he takes care of the boat, such things such as fuel and whatever we need or ask for. So maybe some of the tips you guys spend is due to the difference in the camps we go to.
