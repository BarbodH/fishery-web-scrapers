513928,Guest,2001-07-17 07:17:00,0,I was up there the first week of July. We drove back on July 8th and it was fine except for about 2-3 miles of gravel with water downed mud that completely covered the bottom half of your car. We stoped at an Amoco station with a car wash to wash it off. No big deal. Where are you going to fish?
