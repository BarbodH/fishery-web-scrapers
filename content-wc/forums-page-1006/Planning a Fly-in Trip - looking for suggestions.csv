513974,Guest,2001-07-18 09:47:00,0,"By outpost do you mean, main lodge or an Outpost which is usually off the main lake and you're usually responsible for food and usually doesn't come with a guide but you can get one if you choose.How much to you want to spend?If money is no concern. Try Ganglers, Plummers,Neultin or Knee lake. If it is Aikens is an awesome fisherie for a very reasonable price. These are all located in Manitoba,It's what I'm familiar withI personally prefer outposts, they don't see the pressure of the main lake and are usally way better #'s. But you don't have to worry to much about this in the high-end camps.Hope this helps!"

513975,Guest,2001-07-18 11:15:00,0,"Thanks Wallymars,Yes we want to go to an Outpost, not a main lodge. We were looking to spend about $1000/person. We're really don't want to catch hundreds of small to med. fish, we are willing to sacrafice numbers to catch bigger fish. Especially Walleye and Northern, and maybe Lake Trout. Have you been to these Camps?Which lakes have you fished?How was the fishing, and did you need a guide, or can you get by without?Thanks again for the info!"
513977,Guest,2001-07-18 11:21:00,0,"Cory,what type of fly-in are you looking for? Outposts or lodge? What type of fish are most sought after? Eyes, northern, lake trout etc.... Are you looking for numbers or trophies or both? Please give more info. and we can help you better. Good luck."
513978,Guest,2001-07-18 11:23:00,0,Disregard last post. I did not see the responses when I posted. Sorry.
513979,Steve,2001-07-18 12:22:00,259,"I just got back from a great fly in fishing trip to Larus Lake in NW Ontario. Service is provided by Nestor Falls Fly IN Service out of Nestor Falls, Ontario. You can contact them at NESTORFALLS.COM. Walleyes ran to 8lbs and we caught northerns in the 30 to 39 inch size by the dozens every day. I have also fished Clear Lake with these same folks. This lake has tons of walleyes, northern and 2 portage lakes where lake trout can be fished. A 4 or 5 day trip will run about $7-800. Talk with Michelle or David-I am sure they can help you. Hope this helps. E-mail if you have questions.Steve Buss"
