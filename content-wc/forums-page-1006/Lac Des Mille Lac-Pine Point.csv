Also what bait to use, minnows, nitrcrawlers, leaches,etc. Are the northens found everywhere or do you have to work certain areas of the lake for them? Will they be shallow in the weeds or cruising deeper waters? Anyone with aroad constrution report for north of Duluth to pinepoint? Any advice would be great. Thanks"

The problem with the lake is they don't make a good contour map of the lake so they are a lot rock piles that are not charted. If you drive your boat down the middle of Bolton Bay your will run into a very small island. Before you get to that island there is a huge reef of mud and rock with depths any where from 6ft on top to 45ft on the side. Alot of guys fish before the island about 75 yards and to the left. You will see the guide from Pine Point there. As far as bait I would use night crawlers on a lindy rig with a 6 to 7ft snell or jigs. Don't use a long snell it will get caught in the rocks. Most of the fish we caught were in 17ft of water but if you get down there early in the morning there move into the 10ft range to feed and as the sun comes up they move deeper. There are Northern Pike in that bay also and for a couple of hours we pulled crank baits an pick up some nice pike and some nice walleyes also. It was hard to pull crank baits in that bay because there is much structure, so all of a sudden your bait was banging off the bottom. Hook Island is popular also and as far as road construction there was very little."
