513538,charlie,2001-06-26 05:23:00,25,I have been going to Crotch Lake for appx. 10-11 yrs. now. I go at least 2 times ea. summer for a total of 3 wks. I fish exclusively for walleye. Email me for more info.
513539,Guest,2001-06-26 12:06:00,0,"Went to Crotch a few years ago, but will never go back. Four fish all week, and two of them were perch. One smallmouth, one pike. NO WALLEYE. I've heard other people say its either up or down, well I definitely hit the DOWN of this lake. It was awful. I wanted to leave on Tuesday evening after another ""skunk"" outing on the lake. And just to prove it's the lake and NOT the fisherman, this year over 150 walleye. Last year, over 150 walleye...and this was when the lodge owner admitted the fishing was dead-dog-slow.Nice area, but awful lake."

The best times of day are in the evening from before sunset to about 11 P.M. and from about 5 A.M. to daylight.If you have a fairly good sonar, you can see the ""hooks"" rising up from the bottom in the evening and you will see bait ""balls"" like you wouldn't believe ! They are emerald smelt.Any good crankbait ( Rapala, etc, in a blue-silver pattern ) seems to work. Didn't try trolling worm harnesses. Jigging on the many humps during the day didn't do much - the fish seem to go belly to bottom.The lake is generally very clear and quite deep ( 40 -60 feet on average, I suppose ) on both the South and North Lake.Also a lot of smallmouth bass - you can see them busting smelt on top in the evening, if it's calm enough.Tumblehome Lodge is a good base and you need never get out of sight of the Lodge to catch walleye.I should say that fishing is a bit like ""feast or famine"". There's always lots of walleye but sometimes hard to catch.Hope this helps. Tight lines!Ed"
