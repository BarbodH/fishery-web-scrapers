Thanking you in >advance. >>Bronco Bronco, We were up the week of June 8th thru 15th. First time I'd been back to the area since '93. Water was down about a foot but it is by no means the lowest we've seen it in the past. I can honestly say it was the best overall fishing trip we've ever had up there for numbers of fish. Some of the guys have been going for almost 30 years if that's saying anything. The walleyes were by far the best we've ever encountered for that time of year. Two of us caught well over 100 one day when the conditions were right. Just about anything was working. Did real well trolling crawler harness' off a 1 oz bouncer in 6-10 ft of water. Cranks produced many of the bigger fish. No hogs this year though, many in the 1-3lb range. As for the toothy critters, lots of quality fish caught in the 10-15lb range. Biggest was a 19lb 8oz beauty caught while drifting over some deep cabbage. Were will you be staying? Lots of boat traffic this year. We've camped in the same spot for as long as I can remember and I can never recall seeing that many boats. All of our fish were caught within 3 miles of camp. Lots of guys making the 13 mile trip from Hobbs to fish the general area we were camping in. Feel free to drop me an e-mail if you'd like. -cranker' [email protected]"

Trees are 15-18ft deep, and the fish seem to like the up or downside of the submerged bush. The hogs are there, we caught 4 Master anglers over my stay. As for numbers, expect 40-80+ per boat per day if you are a decent fisherperson.If it is windy, beware !Good luck!"

I'm going there Aug 2 and was curious about the water levels/weather patterns. I live in southern minnesota. Has manitoba had a warm summer in general?????? We always drive by cross lake, but have never fished it. Sounds like it might be worth it some time. Thanks for any info/advice. Steve"
