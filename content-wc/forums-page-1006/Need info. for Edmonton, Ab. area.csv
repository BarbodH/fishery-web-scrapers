I'm open to any suggestions for either a local lake I can drive to and rent a boat for the day (I will bring my own electronics) or maybe even a guided trip. Would prefer to fish walleye, but big pike would be another option. Am accomplished at both and am willing to even drive an hour or so out of Edmonton to somewhere good. I will only have one day, so I'd prefer to be on some water that is usually a productive fishery. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

513995,JD,2001-07-20 04:57:00,22,RMBe-mail me. I would be more than happy to take you out that weekend but am in a tourny that week. I should be able to help you out with some good info.jd

Don't let all the cottages on Pigeon fool you. The walleye fishery here has been carefully managed back fom the dead and the results are awesome."
513997,RMB,2001-07-20 08:40:00,251,"Where is Pigeon in relation to Edmonton proper? Can you rent boats there? If so, where is the place to go for a boat, bait, and tackle? What ever you can fill me in with would be greatly appreciated."
