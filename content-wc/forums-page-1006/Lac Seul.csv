I have read most of the archives for fishing this system, but did not see much for the South East/West part of the Lake. Would appreciate any information on what bait, colors, and locations for Walleye this time of the year. I have fished in early June with great results, but I am nervous that the fishing may not be that great in August. I do not have a problem running a lot of water, as long as the journey is not dangerous to my boat. (Fiberglass)Wade"
513913,KnottyBuoy,2001-07-17 11:48:00,110,I had fished Lac Suel for several years in early June with good success in 8 to 12 feet of water.........going out of Deception Bay. We were up in that area fishing some other lakes in August mostly for lake trout. We decided to buzz over to Lac Suel to try for some walleyes. We tried our usual spring spots with no luck. We motored up to an area known as the Zig Zag and found fish in 25 feet of water. The moral of my story is .....fish the deeper water adjacent to the good spring areas and I think you will catch lots of fish.

However, we will all be fishing the same areas. We have great success with walleyes this time of year which is why we continue to go back. I can put you on some exact areas were I am sure you will catch fish sometime during the week. The last few years we have had 2-3 day in the week were the 3 or us have boated over 100 fish each day. Wish every day could be like that but its fun anyway. Send me an email at my address at [email protected] and we can get more specific"
