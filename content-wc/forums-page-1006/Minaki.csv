514011,Guest,2001-07-21 06:42:00,0,"Snag,Was on the Winnipeg a couple of days a week and a half ago and was using jigs and minnows and crawlers, didn't do any trolling (unfortunately!). Seemed the crawlwers were some better than minnows for us. We worked areas between Minaki and The Dalles that I'm familiar with. Underwater humps, long tapering points, etc. Since the water level is really high the current is strong in allot of places. Found the better 'eyes in the 22' to 30' depths. Long line trolling sounds to be the best bet in the 25' to 30' depths. Have a good trip!"
