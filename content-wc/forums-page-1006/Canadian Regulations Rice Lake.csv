513952,Guest,2001-07-17 11:09:00,0,I'm going to Rice Lake Ontario in two weeks. When I clean fish I skin them. Due to regulations I do not skin walleye. I freeze all fish flat so that they are identifiable and countable. My question is can I skin bluegills? If I still freeze them flat I would think a conservation officer could identify them as gills and not walleye based on there body shape. What do you think?ThanksFujiHow has the fishing been on Rice Lake this year?
513953,Shawn,2001-07-17 12:33:00,33,"I assume you are speeking of Rice lake in Ontario?! If that is the case I beleive Ontario regulations say that a 1"" by 1"" piece of skin must remain on the flesh for identification. I wouldn't trust the shape of the fish to get you off the hook. Gills are similar in shape to small Bass as well as Rock Bass and Crappies, I think the MNR are just as concerned all species as they are with Walleye.Shawnwww.fishingxcanada.com"
513954,b8y,2001-07-17 12:34:00,7,In manitoba 1 square inch of skin must be left on for identification purposes. Best to follow the regs exactly here as I have seen the cos here enter a cabin to count fillets.
513955,bigfish1965,2001-07-17 15:28:00,3210,"You must leave a 1""X1"" piece of skin , so why not leave all the skin on. It makes it easier for anyone needing to ID the fillets. Also, make sure you freeze the fish seperately for easy counting."
513956,Atlanta Dave,2001-07-17 16:00:00,323,"I think the government is crazy witu the idea of leaving the skin on the fillets.I have fished Qubec and I have heard of gov checking at the boarder. I have had them meet us on the lake at Kipawa and then run to our cabin as if we are criminals .I think the Canadian govrnment had gone overboard on regulations. Most of us are honest on the fish we keep and the rest shouldn't be fishing. Canada give us a break on the police tactics. We come. we fish, we spend a lot of money. thank you for the areas to fish. Atlanta Dave <:)))><"
513957,Reels,2001-07-17 17:07:00,2876,"Were were stopped in June. They were polite, came in the cabin, and checked everything and wrote it down. Even asked were the other members in our group were fishing after they wrote down the count they had in the freezer. It can be a little intimidating. This guy had no sense of humor at all.But he did bust some bone heads who had way over their limit at another camp. Gotta have them to keep the bone heads in check. So, even though I dont like to get checked, I do respect them, because they have an unpleasant job sometimes. I sure wouldnt want to deal with some of the people they have to deal with."
513958,Guest,2001-07-18 03:02:00,0,"Hey Atlanta DaveWe Have these regulation because people abuse by nature.I'm not suggesting that you do, but some do we all have seen it, some Joe Shmo keeping a hog or two, that's life.Thank God we have regulations and strict ones in Manitoba, we were pionners when it came to conservation and look at the fisherie we have.I've never had a problem with a CO because I don't break the rules. Yeah I guess there are a few ahol CO's but That's life.Rip some Lip!!"

Because it is clean and has plenty of FISH! If we leave these resources unchecked, and allow people to self-police, there will be nothing left to fish for. Remember, you are in a foreign country while here...this is the way we do things, and we like it this way. I have worked with the MNR, and they are dedicated people trying to do a difficult job. While sometimes they are a bit 'dry' they always have told me where the fish are biting. So you can leave the skin on the fish or they can haul it all away to be tested, its up to you. Our Conservation Officers have more jurisdiction and latitude for search and seizure (i.e. they do NOT need a warrant for searches), so be extra nice to them.P.S. You made me agree with Wallymarss....damm you..lol."
513960,Guest,2001-07-20 17:17:00,0,I've had one run in with the Park Wardens in Quebec. They came on the run just to try to catch us doing something illegal. The guys weren't that bad. Evidently a lot of people try netting the river for eyes and that's mainly who they were trying to catch. More power to them!!!
