6622334,Cgillespie,2022-01-05 04:39:00,120,That looks like a real nice place. May have to check it out one of these days.
6622530,NM_Trout,2022-01-05 15:06:00,1094,Check with Bearskin airlines. They service a good part of Ontario : https://www.bearskinairlines.com/
6626036,LoDo,2022-01-18 20:21:00,721,"Ive had success with Amik Airways out of Winnipeg. They have a shuttle that'll pick you up from Winnipeg airport, 20 min commute to hanger/airstrip and fly to camp/dock. Best of luck"
6620458,Eckohlt,2021-12-28 17:58:00,3685,Ya I'd rather know people in high places rather than people who are just plain high.
6620474,Golden Eagle,2021-12-28 19:05:00,2642,"You might try Eric Brown at Totem Lodge. Several years ago i had 46 men fly to International Falls and Eric provided vans and a bus to haul us. It went well. I don't know what he might have for a small party. It's been 10 years or so since I've talked with him. Lodge owners will probably be the best source for knowledge about getting to their camps. Not just Eric, but others as well. They might even recommend uber drivers."
6620566,Cgillespie,2021-12-29 07:59:00,120,"We fly into Winnipeg and I've done the math a bunch of different ways. Renting a vehicle always ends up being the most economical choice for us. It sucks to leave it parked for a week, but it is what it is."
6620680,elway12,2021-12-29 15:28:00,335,"I totally agree with Cgillespie. I have tried to figure out a ""better"" way to get to the camps/lodges as well but renting a car is always the cheapest option. The two main reasons being that most all resorts are way out away from the population centers and anytime you try to fly into the camps direct it costs way more than renting a car."
6620892,phishfearme,2021-12-30 11:07:00,1242,Contact your outfitter and have him ask around his lodge/base if someone would be willing to pick you up at the airport or wherever. I did this years ago flying into TB when i used an outfitter in Pickle Lake. people in these remote villages frequently travel long distances for shopping and would love to have someone pay them for the shopping trip. just takes some coordination and timing. phish
6620904,That Minnesota guy,2021-12-30 11:14:00,8293,"If you stay in the United States and fly into International Falls contact me. I'd be willing to take you and you stuff to any resort on Rainy, LOTW, Kab & Namakin. United States side only. At the end of your trip I can pick you up and return you to the International Falls airport."
6620910,prov1800,2021-12-30 11:21:00,5010,That's a vreat offer.Another way to travel would be the bus trips that North Shore Lodge offers and Temple Bay Lodge.Ride in comfort.Both lodges do America plan and don't need a guide if you don't want.Eagle lake is a great fishery. Depends on where you live but the buses have pick up cities.Have guided at both camps and most passengers say they love it.
6621456,kayakmatt,2022-01-01 17:05:00,105,"Yeah, I used to see those bus trips to Temple on their website a few years ago. Don't see it offered anymore. Probably a Covid issue.Going to look into Moose Point Lodge on Shikag Lake since they fly out of Ft Frances. I presume I could find a ride over the river from INL to their float plane base."
6621460,prov1800,2022-01-01 17:30:00,5010,Being that close I can't see why not.
6622212,Mike Borger,2022-01-04 14:02:00,1554,"Out of Winnipeg Sassa-ginni-gak lodge is exactly what you're looking for. They also have 2 pretty great outpost camps. They fly out of St. Andrews airport just north of Winnipeg. Have dealt with them before they'll usually arrange to pick you up and drop you off at Winnipeg airport. Worst case scenario you cab it from Winnipeg airport to St Andrews, still way cheaper than renting a vehicle. https://www.saslodge.com/"
6620310,kayakmatt,2021-12-28 09:10:00,105,"Wife and I normally fly to INL, or Winnipeg, rent a car, and go to LOW, American Plan resort. Rental cars are very expensive now. I dislike renting a car for over $600 to park it for a week. Shuttle services are always very expensive. Been looking for a reasonably priced American Plan fly in resort that is accessible (via float plane) from Winnipeg or Thunder Bay airports, thereby eliminating the need to rent a car.I did come across Miminiska Lodge with Wilderness North out of Thunder Bay. Wife likes to smallie fish, but not an end all.Any other suggestions?"
6620318,prov1800,2021-12-28 10:16:00,5010,Try checking out Guardian Eagle Lodge.New owners but they did pick up guests in US and would land on a run way by lodge north of Sioux lookout.
6620366,RichA$1970,2021-12-28 13:41:00,1159,Define affordability / price target as I still get sticker shocked at what some places charge
6620376,prov1800,2021-12-28 15:04:00,5010,Getting sticker shocked with everything a person needs these days.
6620400,RichA$1970,2021-12-28 16:07:00,1159,"Crazy & I wonder what the fuel surcharges will be as although $ are dropping a little the lack of other supplies continues to suck. Iâ€™m living in the past on prices & have to realize the beauty, peace & good fishing is well worth it"
6620428,prov1800,2021-12-28 16:51:00,5010,Agreed.Glad I live here.Even though things are more expensive and getting worse.Dont notice a supply shortage here yet.Fuel went sky high here but has dropped a bit but not enough.The metric system in canada was designed to screw you.
6620446,kayakmatt,2021-12-28 17:31:00,105,"Guardian Eagle Lodge is too pricey. Looks like it is fully guided each day, which I have no interest in, and adds to the cost.Reasonable is less than $3k pp for a 5 day, 6 night. I understand a long float plane ride is expensive."
6620450,Eckohlt,2021-12-28 17:44:00,3685,"You ain't never gonna starve with all that's swimming under the water there,free bait keeps extra money in your wallet also,you got the good life mister."
6620454,prov1800,2021-12-28 17:47:00,5010,Didn't know what kinda money you wanted to spend so i threw it out there.Check out Clarks resorts and outposts.no American plan but the best fishing you'll ever have.And very affordable.www.clarksresorts.
6620456,prov1800,2021-12-28 17:53:00,5010,Good to know people in high places.lol.
