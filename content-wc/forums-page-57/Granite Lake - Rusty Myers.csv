There's not many historical threads on this lake, but I would appreciate anyone's experiences on this lake. We chose it over Siess mainly because of available dates. Looks like it is shallower, rockier, and has more current, but perhaps smaller pike than Siess. Has anyone fished Granite?"
6341158,Guest,2019-07-15 19:03:00,0,"Boiler, I just got back Sun. from Granite. It is a far shallower, narrower body of water than what we are accustomed to at Wabakimi. It has plenty of moving water to fish. It was a great lake to try, AND most likely return to. As I have said before we alternate between Wabi and other lakes yearly. Next year we will return to Wabi, and in 2021 most likely will hit another lake. Granite will move into that rotation quickly I suspect! You are correct RM is the only outfit on the lake, there had been another outfitter but they have left the lake and shut up the place......literally. The dock was completely across the other side from the cabin. We did not have anyone in the RM cabin for 2 weeks prior, but a group did come in after us. Not a lot of pressure we felt. The inflow from Brennan was good, but the outflow into Wabi was AWESOME! The lake was down about a foot so who knows next year what it will look like. It is rocky....watch your depth finders. A lot of times it went from 25-30 feet right up to 3 ft. We were catching fish at 2 feet down into 22-4 feet. No real rhyme or reason. The cabin was great: new stove, furniture, boats/motors (I believe last year). Perfect location. The outhouse was breezy, and fairly bug free. Sandy beach. I am more than happy to share anything you might want to know! I lost my map to the rain, but I can tell you what spots to mark. So feel free to ask."

6341216,Boiler,2019-07-16 04:50:00,6,Thanks for the info NWBearcatgrad! Is there a way to private message you?

6486842,goblue,2020-09-25 08:04:00,9,Thanks for the information on Granite Lake. We have booked it for late May of 2021. Any assistance you could provide would be greatly appreciated.Steve Sink[email protected]
6487212,NWBearcatgrad,2020-09-26 23:14:00,36,"Go Blue, I can share a few things from 2019. My crew was there in late July. Let me gather some info and I will send ya a message. It is a lake I hope we go back to in the near future. We are a Wabikimi group, but the younger guys (2 of us) have convinced the older fellas to hit a new lake every other year. So 2019 was Granite, and 2021 might have been back to Brennan. IF things go well, we will be back at Wabi in the summer! Fingers crossed."
6624920,goblue,2022-01-14 09:02:00,9,We have been to Wabikimi many times. This will be our first time to Granite. We have late summer trip scheduled to Kapikik. We cannot find much information on Kapikik--only that is is very difficult to get a time slot. So-the fishing must be good?
6625744,jambi,2022-01-17 15:08:00,504,I'll send you an email
6625808,Mike Borger,2022-01-18 05:31:00,1554,"I was in the midst of a 6 week canoe trip with my son in Wabakimi last summer, and with permission from the outfitter we stayed at Rusty Myer's cabin on Granite while passing through for a couple of nights. The cabin is amazing! At some point over the winter I'm going to publish a short video tour of the camp that I filmed when we were there. Fishing wise it's a lot more difficult from a canoe, but one afternoon we pounded on solid 2-3lb walleye off a point not far from camp. If I was looking for a new outpost trip, this camp would be near the top of my list."
