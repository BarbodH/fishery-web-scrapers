6621006,prov1800,2021-12-30 15:46:00,5010,Worth a try.some of the hot fly in lakes absolutly suck in the winter time.You need to know actually where they were before freeze up.If not you might have toufh time it fun trying.
6621418,Fishquest,2022-01-01 13:42:00,89,Agreed but i'm confident the structure I have marked would catch the lakers and would probably hold fish during hardwater season and as with the walleye lakes. If not the worse things that could happen is I could explore a bit more.
6621422,prov1800,2022-01-01 13:50:00,5010,Thought you were talking walleye.Yeah Lakers pretty easy to catch.Find structure for them and they will bite
6622638,prov1800,2022-01-05 21:00:00,5010,Did get out couple of days ago.Pulled up 4 fish in like 4 minutes so hot bite for about a hour then slowed right down.Played around with some other lures and got some bites and had some fun.We had Wayne's underwater camera in the shack and it showed fish all the time as did my sonar but they just wouldn't bite fast anymore.Had a really good meal.We baked the walleye in the oven on high heat and turned out great.
6622688,Eckohlt,2022-01-06 06:48:00,3685,Those edwards fish wise up in a hurry when your around.Did you see any big fish on Wayne's camera?
6622704,prov1800,2022-01-06 07:08:00,5010,I wasn't watching it much.as I was on other end of shack.I looked a bit and didn't see anything myself.All seemed to be in that eater size.Couple of 30 pike and they got caught.We got there on tail end of bite I think as we had had a great first hr then dropped off its all about picking right time.I havnt been tgere yet in the morning but will try it soon.

6620192,Fishquest,2021-12-27 16:29:00,89,They help me get through the in between season while we wait for ice here in Central Ontario.
6620212,prov1800,2021-12-27 19:08:00,5010,"Here's some more for ya.After a few days in Winnipeg I needed to have some excitement.My wife told me to go fishing so i was gone as soon as my truck warmed up.Having a good snowstorm here again and was near whiteout out when i got to Clarks.5-6 "" of fresh snow all the way there except for by shacks where Wayne was plowing when i got there.Drilled 3 holes and turned on heat.Wayne gave me a bunch of minnows and it was like groundhogs day there.One fish after the next.Even had good action on a vibrato and a lindy darter.Amazing fishing there.Always seems that first ice is the best and the 2-4 is real hot for now.Cane home cleaned fish and had a great dinner.Baked walleye tonight.Pretty good that way."
6620290,rosh1,2021-12-28 07:22:00,275,nice report keep pictures coming.

6620308,fishin779,2021-12-28 09:05:00,63,I'm jealous !!!
6620406,Fishquest,2021-12-28 16:20:00,89,Thanks and that's one busy sonar screen with fish.
6620416,prov1800,2021-12-28 16:37:00,5010,The whole time iam there bottom is loaded like that.I keep bait above them as the aggressive ones come up fast and take it.
6621004,Fishquest,2021-12-30 15:39:00,89,"Being from Central Ontario I've only ever had action like that with perch, thinking about heading up north this winter for a week of ice fishing for a change of pace. Would love to get to some back lakes I fish during moose season or explore some new waters."
6619460,prov1800,2021-12-23 18:27:00,5010,My wife and I decided to head to the ice shack today and picked 2 o'clock or so to get there.Last time there at the same time couldn't of been and today was no different.I drilled 2 hoĺes for us and turned heater on and my wife had one on right away and that didn't stop till 3:30 when it started slowing down.I used my Vibrato lure and pretty much kept up with her but she still had faster action.Had our 8 eaters in like 8 minnows.Got to love action like that.We sure do.Got to drive truck right to the shacks today.So easy.lol.
6619466,7 Mag,2021-12-23 19:17:00,1887,Wow that’s some nice fish John!
6619468,prov1800,2021-12-23 19:25:00,5010,Crazy place.Got some good fish today and great eaters.
6619470,7 Mag,2021-12-23 19:43:00,1887,"That’s a nice walleye! Do you fish Edward lake much during the open water season, seems like it’s not talked about very often here?"
6619474,prov1800,2021-12-23 19:50:00,5010,I end up guiding there a few times throughout the summer.Fishing is very good and has all species in it.Its part of the Indian Lake Chain system that has 7 lakes you can access.Great muskie fishing as well.
6619528,Bill Krejca,2021-12-24 06:50:00,6107,"Nice mess! Glad to see you are getting out, ice must be building pretty good re: driving on it! Have a great Christmas!!! Bill"
6619530,prov1800,2021-12-24 07:01:00,5010,"Nice getting out.Always a pleasure fishing that ice shack.Ice is 12"" or better so pretty safe to drive out but not to far yet.Never have liked driving on ice.Heading to Winnipeg a few days and then back here.Give the shack a rest.Have a great holiday season Bill."
6619580,Eckohlt,2021-12-24 10:09:00,3685,"More like give the fish a rest,.give them a break from the fry pan."
6619582,Fishquest,2021-12-24 10:19:00,89,"Great report and fish, Congrats and Thanks for posting it."
6619608,prov1800,2021-12-24 13:16:00,5010,They'll get a 2 maybe 3 day break.Going to be a tough couple of days in the city for me
