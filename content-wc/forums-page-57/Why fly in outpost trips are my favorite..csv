6623078,Eckohlt,2022-01-07 17:16:00,3685,Does it work if you have a 30$ flip phone?
6623082,Mojo-NC,2022-01-07 17:26:00,1929,"If the lake is mapped and you have good electronics, you can figure out most of the lake before you ever leave your home. If you can speak with someone who has fished it before, that's a bonus. If the lake is not mapped, it will be up to you to figure it out, which would be a lot more work."
6623086,prov1800,2022-01-07 17:29:00,5010,Well I got away from the flip long time ago and phone I have is a few steps up and it doesn't work.
6623088,Eckohlt,2022-01-07 17:33:00,3685,"But it's a fun kind of work,and will sharpen your skills as a fisherman."
6623116,bthomas3333,2022-01-07 19:42:00,465,"When ""I said figure it out."" I meant figure out how to get on the lake. Availability / cost / best time of year. The fishing is often the easiest part. lol"
6623140,@Lunker,2022-01-07 21:37:00,835,"Quite simply, in my mind, there is just nothing like knowing your group are the only people on the entire lake / your universe as it were, the only signs of outside life being the occasional float plane flying by."
6623170,Mike Borger,2022-01-08 07:06:00,1554,Exactly
6623568,NM_Trout,2022-01-09 10:45:00,1094,"Yup. This ^^^^I got beat up in a previous post I started when I mentioned that when I get dropped off and the plane leaves, I feel like I own a slice of paradise for an entire week. Big lake, single cabin, no competing parties from another cabin. Just me, family, and a crapload of walleye and pike. I'll never be wealthy enough to own 10 square miles of private fishing paradise. But for one week every three years or so I get to ""own"" it for 168 hours. I started bringing my kids with me when they were 12, and having them along just made the trip better. Nothing more wonderfully memorable than watching your kid develop a passion for a hobby that you love. Worst part of the trip is the clean up of the camp and packing to go home on the last day. That's a bummer, but by that time we are ready for a real mattress and some creature comforts. The cabin has a radio, and I bring a sat phone and a SPOT transmitter. My wife does not fish so that is part of the deal I make to disappear into the woods for a week :-)"
6622834,gordy28,2022-01-06 17:15:00,437,"I have been asked a bunch of times about my favourite trip so far. All have been memorable and awesome in their own way but if hard pressed I would say it was the first fly in my group did to Pickle Lake w White River Air, our maiden fly in. There's a bunch of different reasons for me, a big one being that feeling when the plane leaves you on your lake for the week. I am sure some agree, some disagree but for me the fly in to a single cabin outpost is the bomb. Hoping there are many more to come https://www.northernjacks.com/post/why-fly-in-outpost-trips-are-the-best Andrew"
6622932,prov1800,2022-01-07 07:52:00,5010,Have to admit a fly out is exciting.Something about putting your gear on the cart and loading it on the plane.Then hearing that engine fire up.The veiw in the air is incredible.I get to fly quite a bit and never gets old.I enjoy going to different outposts as fishing is fantastic on all of the ones Clarks take me and my wife to.Fun fishing new waters where you have never been to and try to find a few good spots.The solitude is amazing
6622934,Mojo-NC,2022-01-07 07:56:00,1929,"I too love the outpost lake experience for all of the reasons you mentioned. The flight in, the solitude of being the only ones on the entire lake for the week, the pure quietness of being isolated out in the wilderness, the absence of light pollution, etc. It is a unique experience going down to the dock at night to gaze up at the stars with a cigar and a beer or bourbon. I love it! On our first fly-in trip, the lodge owner gave us a satellite phone to use in case of emergency. We did not need it but it was good to know we had it just in case. On our last trip, we had nothing. It was a little disconcerting once we realized it - we were stuck there, especially in the middle of the COVID pandemic. We are all between the ages of 50-65 and with no health problems, but you never know what can happen. One day, I got distracted while we were prepping the boat for the day and forgot to fill the gas tank. Yup, we ran out of gas. Luckily after a while we were able to flag down the other camp boat by waving a bright yellow sweatshirt on the boat oar. We could have been stuck there for hours or had to paddle miles back to camp. That was just an inconvenience. What if something serious had happened? Anyway, from now on we will rent a satellite phone to bring along with us on future trips, just in case."
6622936,bthomas3333,2022-01-07 08:01:00,465,"I have to admit the more I do hosted fly-ins the more I miss true outpost trips. Maybe it is just a phase I am in right now, but I am getting really close to being done with hosted / guided trips. 2/3 trips in 2022 are planned as outposts. Im guess 3/3 in 2023 will be outposts. At this point I look for the best water I can find and then try to figure out a way to fish it without guides and hosts.Brett"
6622938,prov1800,2022-01-07 08:07:00,5010,Yes it's good to have something along just in case.Think most outfitters give a sat phone or a garmin inreach along.I have my own inreach along as sometimes my guiding takes me to far from any towers.The security of that unit makes you feel better when i boat 30+miles sometimes on big lakes like Lac Suel.Good to know you can reach someone.
6623016,stumcfar,2022-01-07 12:48:00,451,"Our group talked about doing a fly in for years. A number of years back we finally did it. Because they were heading our way anyway, they brought us in, in two planes. For all of us, standing on the dock, it was quite a feeling when the second plane left and disappeared beyond the trees. It is an exciting feeling knowing you have a lake all to yourselves, your cell phones are not going to ring and you are not going to be checking the internet. I have only done 2 and our 3rd has been cancelled the past two years. Fingers are crossed that we get to our destination in early June of this year. As great as many of these lakes are, you would think they would be even better now with virtually no fishing going on for two seasons. I recommend it for anyone!"
6623032,RichA$1970,2022-01-07 13:49:00,1159,"Fly Ins are great when you are on your own. Not having to deal with anyone for a week is great and just exploring a lake in your own is so peaceful. Don’t think a guided fly in sounds much fun unless you really haven’t fished much. The only downfall which is out of everyone’s control is delays. 2019 we got an extra 2 days due to the fires / smoke north of Red Lake which was good for me, but the crew coming in lost 2 days plus had to pay for the motels and food which had to suck. I’m open to any fishing trip up in Canada and sometimes at a base camp you can meet some good people or get a laugh at the village idiot."
6623058,gordy28,2022-01-07 16:18:00,437,"Some great responses! In regards to the sat phone. We always either rent one or get one from the outfitter just in case and when flying commercial it helps if we need to contact the airlines due to a delay or anything We are looking at going in as a group for one of the various satellite text tools (garmin inreach, zoleo, spot etc) which would be great for camping trips as well Cheers Andrew"
6623062,prov1800,2022-01-07 16:30:00,5010,I have the expedition which has real good mapping on it and it will blue tooth to my phone so i get a bigger picture to look at and if i need to text or email you can do it right from your cell phone.
6623064,Eckohlt,2022-01-07 16:39:00,3685,"Or scream really loud,sound travels along ways when it's really silent.HELPPPPPP"
