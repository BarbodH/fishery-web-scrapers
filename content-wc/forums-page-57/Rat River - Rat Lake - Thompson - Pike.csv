Launch at Notigi beyond Nelson House, travel way up up and fish/camp into the Rat Lake area. Wondering if anyone has been up that way recently and how the fishing has been. We caught so many large pike up there...released them all and it was some of the best memories/experience that Ive had. My father took us up there when I was in my teens (am now 45). Wondering if anyone could give a description of area and if it is still as good as it used to be 20 years or so ago. Thanks for any insight that could be offered. Wish you all well. Ryan"
