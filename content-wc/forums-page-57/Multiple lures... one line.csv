6626202,NM_Trout,2022-01-19 14:10:00,1094,"I thought about trying this too, instead of tying a 3 way swivel on. More of a traditional rigging for drop shotting. I wasn't sure if the mono would hold up on the upper lure if two fish did decide to bite. Seems like this would be a good way to keep the line tight on the upper fly / bait."
6626206,Mojo-NC,2022-01-19 14:31:00,1929,"I've done it - I called it the Mojo Rig. I do think it might work pretty well with artificial bait, but plan to lose a lot of bait if you are using minnows. I still caught most of my fish on the jig, but I did catch a few on the upper hook. My minnow would always be gone on the upper hook when I would either swing and miss or catch a fish on the jig. I got bored with it and stopped. It does sound good in theory though, and I have caught walleyes on the true drop shot rig."

6626224,Eckohlt,2022-01-19 15:29:00,3685,Is somebody fishing for catfish up there?
6626242,prov1800,2022-01-19 16:26:00,5010,No cats here Rod.
6626266,Yellowfin123,2022-01-19 17:41:00,2182,hook this sucker up and hang on
6626270,Eckohlt,2022-01-19 17:44:00,3685,Looks like a crappie rig down in Florida.
6626274,Yellowfin123,2022-01-19 17:49:00,2182,its supposed to be for striped bass but every fish in the lake hits it
6626286,NM_Trout,2022-01-19 18:35:00,1094,LoL.. Only 5 hooks over the legal limit for Ontario :-) But who's counting?
6626410,Laketripper,2022-01-20 09:02:00,103,Looks like it would be more useful hanging way above an infant's crib...barbless of course.
6626152,NM_Trout,2022-01-19 10:12:00,1094,"I thought I would try a different technique as an experiment this year on Ontario. I like to drop shot for bass. I thought I would try a variation of this for walleye. My plan is to use my typical 3/8oz jig with a plastic that I hop along the bottom. About 18"" up I'm going to tie a tri-turn swivel, and run a bucktail walleye fly on 8 to 10"" of line. Unweighted fly or perhaps a plastic leech on a light hook. Drifting along, I'll bounce the jig on the bottom and the fly should drift along above it. I checked the Ontario fishing regulations, and I believe that this is legal. From what I can tell, you can have 4 hooks in the water at once, but only one line. They do allow an Alabama / umbrella, as long as there are only 4 hooks on it. I think I'll do a little more checking to be sure before I attempt this, but it appears legal. Should be an effective way to prospect. Plus, it would be a hoot to catch two at once :-)"
6626164,Laketripper,2022-01-19 11:11:00,103,"As long as it falls into the legal category...""to each their own"" I guess. One barbless hook is the only way I roll."
6626170,Eckohlt,2022-01-19 11:50:00,3685,"Better to try n catch one big fish,the more hooks on the line the more trouble."
6626172,Timmer92,2022-01-19 11:58:00,451,I've never fished anywhere you could run more than one hook or lure. It sounds like something fun to try.
6626178,bthomas3333,2022-01-19 12:31:00,465,"Hello, I tried this technique as I also believed it was legal as long as I stay under the maximum number of shanks and hooks. More importantly I had terrible time getting hook ups on the primary hook (suspended one). The line was tight to the heavy (dropper) jig, but the suspended one I keep missing bites and losing bait. My top hook of choice was a floating jig with a minnow or leach. Make sure you are within the rules wherever you try this as I'm sure the price for breaking the rules would be stiff. B-"
6626182,RichA$1970,2022-01-19 13:04:00,1159,This makes me think of my Drill Sergeant screaming at us KISS (keep it simple stupid). From snags to netting I’d pass but if I had to I’d used a floating jig similar to a crawler harness on top.
6626184,prov1800,2022-01-19 13:07:00,5010,"Do this òften as i drop shot a lot.bottom weight is my regular 1/8 oz jig and I tie a straight hook 12-18"" above.I have 2 minnows on.Works great.Perch love the top hook.as do crappies.when they are near the bottom catches double walleyes. Vmc hooks makes special swivel hooks to tie into your line or can ride a regular hook in"
6626186,Yellowfin123,2022-01-19 13:32:00,2182,"those umbrella rigs or ""alabama"" with the clover leaf spinners can be deadly , on a typical five lure setup just run 4 hookless teasers and the trailer has the hook, i would think that would be legal but not sure"
6626188,NM_Trout,2022-01-19 13:32:00,1094,"Got an official response from Ontario NRISC (NDMNRF) Here was their response : ""Hello: Thank you for your inquiry.What you have described would be legal. You can have 1 main line and you could have up to 4 separate line branching from the main line with a hook attached to each line and be legal as long as you don’t have more than 4 hooks in total attached to the main line."""
