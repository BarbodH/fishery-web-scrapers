6626008,prov1800,2022-01-18 17:56:00,5010,No thx Rod.ive done enoufh cooking fish on daily basis for 30 years.These last couple of years have not done any and that doesn't bother me at all.Lol.
6626012,Eckohlt,2022-01-18 18:22:00,3685,"Your the owner you don't need to cook,I'll do it.I can go fishing every morn to get fresh fish and be back by noon to cook it up for the people,you be the bus boy n clean tables,I'll do double duty,cook n run the till."
6626048,PRO-V16,2022-01-18 21:11:00,454,"Three of us were lake trout fishing east of Crow Saturday and Sunday. We caught 22. Biggest were a couple 29"" beauties. They were definitely a bit finicky. I caught 8 on 5 different lures. Alternated between vibration baits such as Sabille Vibrato, jig and rubber, and rattle baits. Caught 3 on a Real Image rattle bait just jiggled and no more than an 8"" lift and drop. Any fish that saw that slammed it. I had at least 8 more shake off and numerous bumps. Crossed quite a bunch of slush fields."
6626070,prov1800,2022-01-19 04:33:00,5010,Sounds like a great time.Doesnt sound like they were to finicky catching 22 of them.
6626084,Bill Krejca,2022-01-19 06:01:00,6107,"Re: Snow. I see the highway is again closed due to the snow. Since the roads are few between in the area, I can imagine it puts a crimp on moving around. Here in Iowa, we do get I-35, a north/south road, closed at times due to blowing snow, but not, apparently, as often as up north. Stay warm! Bill"
6626122,prov1800,2022-01-19 07:53:00,5010,Been very scary driving our roads this year.Closures daily.
6626402,maddogg,2022-01-20 08:41:00,178,Are there a lot of good lakes it Australia?

6626524,Eckohlt,2022-01-20 15:23:00,3685,There's a big arse reef in Aussie land.
6626526,PRO-V16,2022-01-20 15:25:00,454,Hahaha! I hear the ice fishing isn't that good though.
6625584,prov1800,2022-01-17 05:22:00,5010,Headed out on Cliff Lake yesterday for the first trip for lake trout.There is a ton of snow on the lake.Brought a couple of tents along but really didn't need them yesterday as the weather was pretty mild at -6.We had a lot of action but lakers wouldn't take the bait and just chased most of day.Tried a lot of different lures but nothing seemed to work.Had a couple on but got off.Finally I ended up with one and got it up on the ice.Enjoyable day.
6625722,Bill Krejca,2022-01-17 14:19:00,6107,"Didja try one of those 3/4 oz jigs I gave you? I never tried then for trout in the winter, but they are good trout producers in soft water. Bill"
6625732,prov1800,2022-01-17 14:51:00,5010,"I sure did Bill.I put it down bare and they chased it then I broufht it up and put a minnow on and just chased it.I don't have many lures just the ones that have worked in the past and now I have one of yours with them.Trout would take off like a rocket from the bottom and come up to 20 ft from 57 ft in like 2 seconds.Stop right on bait and leave it alone or they would bump it.i rip it up couple of ft and they would be on it again.lol.Drive you nuts.lol.My tubes with and without bait ,spoons and then I put my small smelt colored vibrato on and BOOM got one.That was only fish I got.My buddy had a good one on and lost and his gf was getting same action as us.I had like a dozen fish do that.Normalky they bite but not yesterday.oh well next time."
6625746,prov1800,2022-01-17 15:11:00,5010,Don't laugh at my tackle box.Its all I need this time of the year and basically in summer except for my 5 muskie lures in use.On walleye side I have 3 of your hair jigs which will get used again for crappie and walleye and other side I have your bigger jig there with the trout lures.It will get ate a few times this winter
6625966,Bill Krejca,2022-01-18 15:28:00,6107,Try sticking a piece of gullet on the jig. Bill
6625968,Eckohlt,2022-01-18 15:54:00,3685,"Gotta catch a fish first to get the gullet,not sure if john can do that."
6625976,prov1800,2022-01-18 16:28:00,5010,"Have thrown a lot of gullets out since ice fishing started.lol.what happened was one of those days.Have had them before and will have some more.The other day crappie fishing I was lucky and found a few stickle back minnows in the minnow pail.that seemed to be the preferred food.that day.I have cleaned many lake trout and quite often they are packed with stickle back.might be why I do so well on trout when i use my darker silver vibrato.Who knows.If they had been on the feed bag I would of caught at least a dozen.Was glad with one.Was a great meal fried in a bit of olive and dipped in instant potatoe flakes.7-8 "" of snow today and its not done yet.plowed once already today so wouldn't be as much to push tomorrow.total white out this morning and many accidents again and road closures."
6625992,7 Mag,2022-01-18 16:54:00,1887,Did you catch any walleyes John?
6625994,prov1800,2022-01-18 16:56:00,5010,Absolutely.
6626004,Eckohlt,2022-01-18 17:49:00,3685,"John's country restaurant,fresh fish everyday is what the sign outside will say,has a nice ring to it."
