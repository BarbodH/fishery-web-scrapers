I have not paid much attention to good island sites and am wondering if anyone here could give me some possible locations between Morson and the Northwest angle. Obviously a somewhat sheltered spot would be preferred if there is any major wind to deal with would be nice... I know being a non-resident, I'd be looking at roughly $10 and change per night... Anyone have info they would be willing to share on decent places to island camp? Thanks!"
