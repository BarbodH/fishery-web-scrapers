I have found that the leader can tend to eventually get hung up on the weight, as the bait may spiral on the way down/while jigging; the pointed weight tends to usually cause the leader to slide off of it. Nothing is 100%, tho, why they call it fishin' rather than catchin', eh? Bill"
6624518,prov1800,2022-01-12 20:47:00,5010,"Had planned a fishing day today.I decided to try from noon on.After opening up 2 holes in the shack and getting slush out of the shack and putting my sonar in I saw I was going to be in for a good couple of hrs.Walleyes were steady cruising through the area.Started off with a black 1/8 oz jig and a 4"" minnow.Watched it going down and had a fish already coming up from 20 ft and and take the minnow at 10 ft.Did this 3 more times and had my 4 nice eaters in no time.I Ã§hanged to a hair jig that Bill Krejca had left for me at Cedar Point Resort in Sept.It was maybe 1/16 oz and took a long time to go down but around the 10 ft level there were a couple of fish coming from the bottom and caufht around a dozen on that hair jig and a piece of minnow for smell (Thx Bill)After that I put on a few vibratos and had action on them to.Incredible bite.5 th trip to shack and 4 of them have been fantastic and even the slower day still caught 25-30 fish which is still good.Packed up around 3 as tgere were hardly any fish showing up anymore.One day I'll have to get my butt out of bed and try a early morning.Anyone ice fish on this site.Border is open and shacks can be rented."
6624546,Bill Krejca,2022-01-13 06:12:00,6107,"OK, now that I have you convinced to use the Killer, put a 1/2 oz bullet sinker with ball bearing swivel ahead of it about 2 feet. And hang on. Bill"
6624556,prov1800,2022-01-13 06:56:00,5010,Was thinking that Bill but didn't have any weights with me.Next time.
6624560,Eckohlt,2022-01-13 07:32:00,3685,Hang on coz of the extra weight?or fish? Lol
6624614,prov1800,2022-01-13 10:44:00,5010,So I did find a 1/8 split shot in amongst my jigs.Next time.Maybe tomorrow as iam invited to a crappie day on Dinorwic Lake with a walleye central member who I just met and didn't know he was so close.
6624648,Bill Krejca,2022-01-13 12:14:00,6107,"Yeah, bullet sinker works best. Could get by with a smaller sinker, since the ice isn't moving. Hopefully. There are 40+ years of story behind this outfit. Bill"
6624652,prov1800,2022-01-13 12:25:00,5010,Will have a weight on tomorrow
6624686,Timmer92,2022-01-13 15:25:00,451,Things look pretty good up there in Canada! I need to move north a few hundred miles.
6624694,Wallychowder,2022-01-13 15:38:00,1567,Can i ask why a bullet sinker and not a regular egg sinker ?
6624766,prov1800,2022-01-13 18:39:00,5010,Not sure myself.Might have something to do with the shape.In either case I don't have any and will clip on a split shot.Its all vertical tomorrow so no big deal.
