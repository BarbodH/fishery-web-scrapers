6622424,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-01-05 09:21:00,240,"Hi all--I have just gone through the St. Croix website, and have looked at Fenwick rods, too, but cannot find a good quality, 2-piece, 7' Medium Weight, Fast action spinning rod. Since January is a 'slow news' month, I was hoping somebody could give me a push in the right direction. Like I said, I would like to purchase a St. Croix rod, but I scanned their entire site and there was nothing to be had. It is the 2-piece factor that is the fly in the ointment. (for outpost fishing) Thanks for any advice you can give--I would appreciate it very much!!"
6622460,Crede,2022-01-05 11:07:00,134,"Not sure what you mean by good quality. For my fly-ins my rods usually include 2 6'6"" Avids AVS66MF2 and they do the job well for me. Looking at the St. Croix website for 7', 2 piece, M power, F action spinning rods I see: Triumph TSR70MF2 $115 (in stock) Premier PS70MF2 $185 (in stock) Avid AVS70MF2 $235 (in stock) Legend Elite ES70MF2 $460 (currently not in stock). Hope this helps."

6622488,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-01-05 12:46:00,240,"I did find the Legend Elite model at fishusa.com, too. A little pricey, though. Those Avid rods look great. I am not that far from Park Falls so am going to go and check them out. Thanks again for your help."
6622522,Bfgilly,2022-01-05 14:46:00,18,Fenwick elite tech runs around $150. I like it. I have been flying into Canada for over 30 years & use an adjustable rod tube. I take 6’6” to 7’ one piece rods with no problems.
6622590,prov1800,2022-01-05 17:54:00,5010,Check out the second also.Have a couple of those 2 pieces.Great rods also
6622592,Da' Walleye Assassun,2022-01-05 17:58:00,358,All my fly-in rods are 6ft 6in or 7 ft. I have never had a problem stowing them in the plane. I am not a fan of two piece rods.
6622594,prov1800,2022-01-05 18:07:00,5010,Me neither but have used them and see no difference in tgem.when I get in a plane my rods go in a case.To expensive to take chances.
