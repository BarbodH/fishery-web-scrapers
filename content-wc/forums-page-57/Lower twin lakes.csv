6623748,RichA$1970,2022-01-09 19:26:00,1159,Is it the Old O’Sulivan Lake Outfitters they bought from Howard?If so I tried their new website but it does not work so if you have it send it to me…thanks
6623750,Eckohlt,2022-01-09 19:31:00,3685,Check your pm's
6623754,Eckohlt,2022-01-09 19:36:00,3685,"The old website comes up but on the front page it says come meet the new owners just click on it,it's a long name it starts with A.Just type in O'Sullivan lake outfitters"
6623790,"6'3""",2022-01-10 02:45:00,47,We have stayed at both 7 Lakes and Lower Twin camps. If the water is low the docks are shallow at Lower Twin but manageable. Better docking and more protected at 7 Lakes. More a numbers spot than size but have caught up to 28 inchers
6623842,Bill Krejca,2022-01-10 07:52:00,6107,"Only know about the twin lakes as a starting point for fly-ins, have never heard about how good it is until the above posts. I am, however, very familiar with O'Sullivan Lake. Stayed a number of times at O'Sullivan's Rainbow( the other camp, this one is actually right on the lake, rather than being up the river a bit, which flows in to O'S). Fishing around that camp and further to the right, out of camp can be very good for walleyes, not so much the other way - which has been my last experience, others may have had other results. Owners of O'Sullivan's Rainbow are great folks who try very hard to be helpful. Fish the wind! Bill"
6623846,Eckohlt,2022-01-10 08:25:00,3685,Has anyone here on WC fished O'Sullivan lake nakina late sept?
6623852,maddogg,2022-01-10 09:13:00,178,"You have a lot to learn they,they all say that."
6624028,bester,2022-01-10 19:32:00,18,"Yes they purchased the camp from Howard, new name is called Andomoozwe outfitters & lodge. In Ojibwa it means He/she who hunts moose."
6624082,Eckohlt,2022-01-11 04:41:00,3685,Wonder what he/she who fish is in Ojibway?
6623588,Eckohlt,2022-01-09 11:41:00,3685,Anyone fished lower n upper twin lakes in late fall for walleyes?
6623622,prov1800,2022-01-09 15:16:00,5010,Where is this place
6623632,Eckohlt,2022-01-09 15:42:00,3685,"Russia lol,just kidding it's near nakina far from where your at,just doing my research for a late fall trip,also looking at O'Sullivan lake"
6623644,maddogg,2022-01-09 15:59:00,178,There aren't any fish in either one of these lakes.STAY AWAY.Just kidding.
6623652,Eckohlt,2022-01-09 16:38:00,3685,"The lodge owner said there is one fish in the two lake,I was going to try n catch it this fall."
6623676,RichA$1970,2022-01-09 17:31:00,1159,Around 5 miles from Nakina. I’ve heard good things as Pete’s Bay is a walleye sanctuary until late June there.
6623710,"6'3""",2022-01-09 18:30:00,47,Doesn't quite qualify as late fall but we did really well there the last week of August this past year. Lots of walleyes
