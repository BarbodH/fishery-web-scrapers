6621838,prov1800,2022-01-03 07:11:00,5010,Mild this morning.Feels good.Should be able to go anywhere on tracks.Snow has kinda packed down.Always nice to have better weather.Few days cold coming again but next week the forecast looks good.Hoping to fish this afternoon for a couple of hrs.
6621178,prov1800,2021-12-31 08:03:00,5010,In a cold front.Temps been hovering around -30 last few da√Ωs.Definatly making some ice now. Trout season opens tomorrow b√πt iam not going to be out there in those temps even with my insulated shack.Ill wait for better weather.I have the ice shack to go to on Edward Lake.But here's a pic from my kitchen window after some bird food was put out.Everyone is hungry.
6621224,7 Mag,2021-12-31 12:16:00,1887,Wow that's cold! How's the drought situation is it getting better?
6621226,prov1800,2021-12-31 12:40:00,5010,"Snow turns to water so that's good.Had lots of snow already.Rough guess if i added the snowfalls up woukd be around 35"" iam guessing.will help come spring when it melts.Lots gets evaporated though but the rivers feeding lakes definatly will bring some much needed water and our ground needs a good soaking."
