6622128,ryguy,2022-01-04 10:16:00,11,^this is true.. happened to family going to down to Florida.. one who flew had to get a test 24hr before flight which was a huge pain.. the other lives near border so drove to Detroit and flew from there.. zero hassles just have a great time and smiles.
6621438,LAvet,2022-01-01 15:56:00,94,"As I read the regulations, it would appear that after fishing a week or two in Canada that to return to the US, the US citizen needs a negative covid test to enter back into the US. Am I reading this correctly and your thoughts on how to make this happen when fishing NW Ontario? Our crew made it fishing in Canada last year and it was an awesome time but we did not have to get tested to enter back into the USA."
6621444,Hot Runr Guy,2022-01-01 16:16:00,16061,Flying or driving over the border? HRG
6621448,LAvet,2022-01-01 16:31:00,94,Driving there and back
6621450,Hot Runr Guy,2022-01-01 16:35:00,16061,"From what I see, the negative test requirement is ONLY if you are flying into the US. Maybe post a screen shot of what you see differently? HRG"
6621528,eyecatcher1,2022-01-02 07:36:00,323,I drove into NW Ontario in August and October 2021 and didn't need a test when returning to the USA. Did that change now?
6621534,Wallychowder,2022-01-02 08:26:00,1567,It very well could ! 6 months is a long way off !
6621538,Obabikon,2022-01-02 08:56:00,2370,It has not changed. When driving from Canada to the US... you do not require a negative test. I seriously doubt the US will implement that rule for driving.
6621546,LAvet,2022-01-02 09:41:00,94,"Thanks. After looking for where I read that, I can't find it. The regs discuss flying which I will not be doing but nothing about driving. If it hasn't changed, nothing to worry about. Easy to fall down a rabbit hole on while googling something like that and reading multiple articles."
6621548,10lbeye,2022-01-02 09:44:00,61,"ever since the border opened, you do not need a negative test to re-enter U.S. Been to Canada twice (august--fishing trip, Toronto in December), no such test required."
6621820,Larry S,2022-01-03 06:42:00,665,You Need a Negative test to Re- Enter the USA if FLYING. If Driving No Test is Needed!!
