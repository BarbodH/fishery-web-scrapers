6618872,prov1800,2021-12-20 21:56:00,5010,Drop off from the beach.All sand and a trench from tug boats from old days.fìsh magnate.
6618928,walleyecheek,2021-12-21 07:29:00,2231,How do you cook your walleye ? Looks great !
6618384,prov1800,2021-12-18 18:53:00,5010,"And so it starts.Ice shacks are out at Clarks KC landing on Edward Lake.Went over around 2:30.Left truck near shore and just walked to shack.Wayne drilled a couple of holes for us and turned heat on.Not real cold at -15c but bit of heat is nice.Got some minnows which there is no shortage off.LOL.I set up my sonar and bottom was loaded with walleyes.wayne fished with for about a 1/2 and we probably caught around 30 or so walleyes and then he left and I fished till 4:30.Hard to know many I caught after cause it was about every time I put my jig down.Alk kinds of sized fished.Pretty awesome first time on the ice and am ready for a walleye meal.Looked like at least 10-11"" of ice so feel much better walking out for now.Even though we got a ton of snow few weeks ago there's not much on the ice. Great place to fish for anybody wanting some easy fishing."
