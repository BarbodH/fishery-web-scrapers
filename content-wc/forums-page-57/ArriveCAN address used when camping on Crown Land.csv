When the border guard reviewed our ArriveCan information he only said that we needed to put a number in front of the address. So he put a 1 in front of Chapleau Crown Game Preserve. That was it. He didn't appear to care that this was not actually an address. Of course I don't think we were camping within 10 miles of any place that has an actual street address they would be able to look up."
