I have normally stayed at lac seul lodge but we had to cancel the trip a few weeks ago and when we could reschedule Dan was booked. I'm heading up there August 7-14 this summer. Any of you guys going to be there at that time? How is the fishing in this area? Any other thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks, Joe"

537208,Guest,2004-02-07 15:49:00,0,"I spent a week at Scout lake camp in 2002.Found the camp to be the basic housekeeping setup.Cabins were clean ,plenty of hot water for showers, good fridge to keep the beer cold.Fishing was very good for walleye, as you will probably expect anywhere on LS.The owner Roland was not at all helpful as to pointing out fishing spots but you can do ok without him.I know that the camp was up for sale but don't if it has changed hands as of this date. As for Dan at Lac Seul lodge ,I thouhgt he had a love life over at Goose Bay Camp!"
537507,NateW,2004-02-17 11:55:00,96,I've stayed at SLR three times in the last four years (missed a year when my daughter was born) and it much like was said above. The camp is comfortable and adequate. The cabins are semi-rustic but they keep the mosquitos out. We've never had any trouble with the appliances in the cabin or any of the equipment. This board gave me much of my initial Lac Seul knowledge--at least enough to get me started. We learn something new every year. But if you can't catch fish on Lac Seul you should probably spend more time playing golf.
537683,Guest,2004-02-24 12:54:00,0,I have been going to Scout Lake for the last 7 years and have never had a bad time. Rollie the owner has always been helpful. They have good equipment and nice cabins. I will be there again in August for year 8
