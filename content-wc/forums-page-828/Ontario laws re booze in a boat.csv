537681,Guest,2004-02-24 11:12:00,0,"I think you guy's are missing the point here, ITS AGAINST THE LAW TO DRINK IN THE BOAT OR HAVE BOOZE IN THE BOAT.. The MNR is just doing there job. If you have something to hide and just turn up the motor they will catch you and they don't need a warrant. You dont think the justice system works together weither there right or not. Come on now, better to follow the law i think, when it comes to drinking and boating..."
537608,retire55,2004-02-20 16:58:00,1029,"FYI: There have been numerous posts over time requesting information about the liquor laws in Ontario, particularly as they apply to alcohol in a boat (e.g. while fishing). I contacted the appropriate Ontario authorities (the Ontario Provincial Police) for internet references to the pertinent laws. Anyone interested can look up the applicable laws at http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/S...sh/90l19_e.htm The applicable sections are 30, 31 and 32. Bottomline, it is legal to consume alcohol on a boat that has permanent sleeping accommodations, permanent cooking facilities and permanent sanitory facilities while it is at anchor or moored to a dock. It is not legal for anyone to consume alcohol while such a boat is underway unless that boat has a licenced premise (ship, cruise ship, ferry). The total fine for operating boat underway with open container of liquor  pursuant to section 32(3) LLA is $215.00. That includes a a court imposed fine of $180.00 plus a victim fine surcharge of $35.00 which brings the total to $215.00."
537613,Matches,2004-02-20 20:15:00,236,"Retire55, thanks for the info., time and effort you did to find this. Finally some facts instead of everyone guessing!! (Of course the guessing makes some pretty good posts)."
537624,Guest,2004-02-21 07:43:00,0,"================= Exception (4) Subsection (3) does not apply if the liquor in the boat, (a) is in a container that is unopened and the seal unbroken; or (b) is stored in a closed compartment. ================== Does that mean you can keep them cold, in a 'closed compartment' Coleman Cooler?"
537628,Guest,2004-02-21 11:22:00,0,FOR WHATS IT WORTH. I have been on lac saul and LOTW and have witnessed first hand and used binoculars just to make sure of what I was seeing. It could be either a DNR or police boat going from fishing boat to anchored fishing boat and watch the boaters emtying into the lake can or bottle after bottle of what I can only assume to be beer into the lake. I dont know if all the beer went into the lake or just what was not in a closed locked container. In the old days we never saw any police on the lake. now its the rule rather than the exception. I did read an interesting item in the paper up there once. Of all the drowned fisherman recoverd that were not wearing life jackets it was observed that half of them had their zippers down. So I guess the assumption is they slipped on the side of the boat while taking a wiz and drowned. The same article said about 50 US fisherman drown each year up there. this was a while ago maybe things have changed.

While no one can control what individual fishermen opt to do in such a case, I would prefer that fishermen pay the fine, if required, rather than polute the lakes with such refuse. I posted in order that those interested could opt to know the law. I don't personally believe the existing law is a good law - but it is the law. If our boat gets caught with a few beers, we'll pay the fine, if required. I say ""if required"" because two fishing colleagues were stopped last summer with probably a dozen empty beer cans (over 6 hours) in the bottom of the boat. The conservation officers asked to see their licences and their fish, and then wished them a good day as they left."
537646,Guest,2004-02-22 00:18:00,0,"I guess it depends on how lucky you feel about who stops you and checks for the beer. Its all at the descretion of the officer. I dont know why they started this law. All I know is that the lodge owner made sure that we were aware that beer in the boat is the same as beer in the car and for the canadians it is against their law. I have to respect their law for we are guest in their country. All I can figure is they dont want a reputation for allowing generally US folks to come up, get drunk in the boat and drown themselves while peeing over the side of the boat. i can live with rule because its already expensive enough to go up for a week."
537653,Guest,2004-02-22 22:49:00,0,"I live in Ontario and I know that the lakes arn't as busy as the streets but drinking on a boat puts too many people at risk, even people that arn't in that boat. Sure I wouldn't mind a bruskie while fishing but there are too many ignorant people who just can't have 1 or 2."
537654,Pooch,2004-02-23 06:12:00,4619,They do spot check from time to time. Even on the more remote Canadian lakes as witnessed by one of my photos in the members section. The yellow turbo Beaver pulling away had just landed and spot checked us and our other boat. Wanted to know what was in the cooler. (It was crawlers and leeches.) Very polite and professional. We like our beer but don't carry any in the boat. Pooch
537665,Guest,2004-02-23 16:09:00,0,Are there similar laws that cover the Province of Quebec?
537672,retire55,2004-02-24 07:20:00,1029,"Phern: I'm not familiar with the Quebec liquor laws but the Ontario laws, to which I provided an internet reference at the beginning of this thread, are very specific with regard to being able to search a boat for liquor without warrant: Section 32 (5) Search of vehicle or boat A police officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that liquor is being unlawfully kept in a vehicle or boat may at any time, without a warrant, enter and search the vehicle or boat and search any person found in it. If you are aware of internet references that clearly refute section 32 (5), please provide them for the edification of those interested."
