537599,Guest,2004-02-20 10:27:00,0,"Do you mean the one in Minnesota? Or, is there another?"
537610,Fishing Junky,2004-02-20 18:24:00,182,"Yes Minn, the one that is border waters to Minnesota and Ontario. Ya been there?"
537612,Matches,2004-02-20 20:10:00,236,"Does Sganaga Lake have size of motor restrictions like Basswood? I've fished Basswood and its awesome!!!! Only problem because its in the BWCA, they have a 25HP Limit, and you have to portage. But its worth it. The USA and Canada Border goes right through the middle of the lake, So on Basswood, you have one side 25hp limit and I believe on the Canadian side its no HP limit."
537620,Fishing Junky,2004-02-21 03:41:00,182,"Hey Match. Yes the American side has a 25hp limit also. There is a narrow passage on the east side of the lake called the corridor, where you can motor up to Canada from the American side. You can't use anything bigger than a 25 though to motor up. Must stay in the corridor and not stop to fish or anything. Once in Canada, you can drop the big boy down and go. Junky........."

And up until 12:01AM Saturday of Memorial Day Weekend you have to fish north of some buoys north of where the Seagull River flows into Sag. After that time you can stop & fish. Sag can be tough, but it has some nice fish. If you've not fished it before, call Seagull Creek Fishing Camp and hire a guide for the day, 218-388-9929. I recommend Mike Berg or Steve Foster.

537631,Fishing Junky,2004-02-21 12:43:00,182,"Hey Bell. The narrows are from the landings to the mainlake. Seagull river runs into the narrows. The corridor starts out into the big lake. You just stay to the right as your going out of the ""narrows"" and it will take ya into Canada. Another good man to have from Seagull Creek Fishing Camp is Roger Campbell. Awesome guide. Junky."
537641,Matches,2004-02-21 21:39:00,236,"I assume you need to purchase day passes to be able to go in, is that correct?"
537647,Fishing Junky,2004-02-22 06:25:00,182,"Yes Match, you need a day motor permit on the Minnesota side to travel the lake. I think last year they were twelve bucks. I get overnight motor permits and camp on the island campsites. Also if you fish the Canadien side, you need to buy your leeches in Canada and your crawlers need to be in store bought bedding. A Canadien fishing lisence and a an RBC permit. I just fish the Minnesota side. I heard there are better waters on the Canadien side, but never fished it. Real cool lake though."
