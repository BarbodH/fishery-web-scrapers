528404,Guest,2003-03-09 19:20:00,0,we use the red dog inn. Clean and reasonable. I don't have the phone # handy. I called the cC of C and they sent me the info.
528401,Guest,2003-03-10 10:40:00,0,SM Rainy;Thanks for the information. I've been trying to find out info on accomodations in Ft. Francis but not too many have websites. My son and I are driving up from Wisconsin on 8/1. A friend recommended that we cross on Friday because Saturdays can be a nightmare. Do you agree with this?ThanksBruceb

528407,Guest,2003-03-12 12:02:00,0,the Rainbow is very clean and inexpensive. Nice people. they do have a couple of rooms that are actually two rooms. nice for a couple of guys.
528408,Guest,2003-03-12 19:51:00,0,"We got the last spot at the Super 8 on 6/6-nothing left but an excutive suite with a hide-a-bed and 1 bed. The Super 8 is great if you can get a room....secure and decently lighted lot, continental breakfast."

528393,Guest,2003-03-07 13:35:00,0,We are heading up to the Ear Falls area in June and are planning on crossing the border late Friday night and planning on staying in Fort Francis. Anyone know of a cheap clean place to stay for less than one full night?
528394,Guest,2003-03-07 13:44:00,0,"You need to realize that you are in the heart of the season in June and that the area is bombarded with fisherman. There are going to be no cheap bargains, just fair prices. I would doubt but don't know if anyone would be interested in a partial nights rental when they can basically get full price. Hey, save a few extra bucks now, and give them what they are worth. I usually stayed on the American side, more motels, and then cross very early in the morning. For what's it worth."
528395,Ron,2003-03-07 13:49:00,387,"I usually stay at Reid's Voyager Inn Motel right in Fort Francis. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT stay at the Mid Town Motel if you can help it. Really, really bad. Makabi Inn Motel would be my second choice.Nothing like the clean fresh air of Fort Francis.Voyager Inn phone number: 807-274-9805Makabi Inn phone number: 807-274-9874Ron"
528396,Karl,2003-03-07 17:44:00,63,"Try calling La Place Rendez-Vous (1-800-544-9435). It's reasonably priced (C$92.00 a night, two double beds), safe, and quite. I've been staying there six years and highly recommend it. DO NOT stay at the places in town (i.e. Red Dog Inn) itself if you're towing a boat and keep anything valuable in the boat overnight."
528397,alan ex pup,2003-03-07 23:36:00,126,I will second the la place redevoux. very nice and good food for a canadian restaurant.
528398,Guest,2003-03-08 06:38:00,0,"I'm from Fort and would say rendevoux is good but expensive for nothing same with the food, and why would anyone stay on the american side when there dollar is worth so much here (think eh). Theres all kinds of savings here if you take time to research and look for the deals. I have deals with some hotels that i bring my guest to, like if you stay for 4 days get the 5th nite free."
528399,Guest,2003-03-08 11:14:00,0,"Here is a list of most of the motels/hotels:Going West:Rainbow Motel... Cheap, clean, very nice for a motel. 807-274-3268Super 8 Motel ..

Have a great time fishing in Ontario.SM Rainy"
528402,Rocky,2003-03-09 09:29:00,5,I made my first trip to Canada last summer. Crossed into Fort Francis on a Friday evening and all the hotels were packed. I was forced to stay at the famous mid town motel--Do not stay there it is cheap but a real CRAP HOLE. I learned my lesson it pays to plan ahead and make reservations. If I go again I would stay at the Super 8 it looked like the best thing in town.
528403,Guest,2003-03-09 10:16:00,0,"Thanks for all of the responses. As to the first response, I am not necessarily looking for a reduced rate or a deal, just a reccomendation as to a good place where the boats will be safe and where the rooms are clean. Thanks again."
528400,fishmaster,2003-03-09 12:07:00,209,Cross over and stay on the Canadian side this way you won't have to fight traffice in the AM.We stay at the La Place Rendez-vous very nice place the prices are not bad even when you are splitting with one of the other guy's in the group and you can sit down and relax at the bar and enjoy the scenery.Good luck and rememeber you don't want to skimp on things that is when you get what you pay for and o'yea the Red Dog is a pain stayed there a couple of times and they are not as nice of place to stay.
