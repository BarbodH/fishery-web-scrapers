537685,Guest,2004-02-24 14:34:00,0,"Bode: You are braver than I exploring all those lakes. Anishinabi made me nervous of getting lost! I've been to Fleming off Wine and Ryan off Keynote and some unnamed off Wabaskang. All of these were pretty small lakes and none were noteworthy. A fellow last year talked about Dennis Lake (behind Perrault) for eyes & perch. Another guy told me last year that a logging road went all the way back to Anishinabi. Probably boats cached everywhere. Hey, if I was a logger I'd plow an extra path to get to a good fishing hole - it would make the lunchbreak better! I think trailerguy fishes some out lakes for Muskie. BTW - on the way to Wine this year there were signs posted prohibiting camping."
537688,Guest,2004-02-24 16:23:00,0,"Hey AB Thanks for the reply and info. Back when we camped you had to get a permit to camp on the Crown land. I don't suppose it it is allowed at all nowadays. But at 54 I definitely wouldn't need a sign telling me not to sleep on the ground on a leaky air mattress. I know the guy that runs (or used to run) Anisinabi Lodge would drive his pick up back the logging roads to the place he kept his 4 wheelers for traveling to other lakes right at the west end of Anish. Not sure of the distance from the highway, but I imagine it would be pretty rough on vehicles. One of the better lakes we used to fish was called Trappershack, on the map it's the lake that is C shaped and is north of Burden and east of Oak. Of course that was way before the walleye explosion on Lac Seul and apparently Wabaskang. Looks like now may be the good ole days."
537414,cough6609,2004-02-13 17:31:00,48,"Stayed at Lundy's and fished the north part of the lake in 2001-2002. We fished the first week of July so a different pattern from the early part of June. As a earlier post stated...the 'eyes in Wabby love the weedlines. Early morning we usually would ""speed troll"" the weedlines with crankbaits. Tended to hit bigger 'eyes and the bonus pike. That or we would cast the islands for smallies. From mid-morning to mid-afternoon we'd switch to live bait rigs (minnows early, leeches and crawlers when water temps were above 60). Usually lindy's. In the evening, we had a blast anchoring at the ""hotel"", the narrows leading to the northwest. We'd anchor in 6-8 ft. of water right next to the reeds and throw slip-bobbers out in 10-12ft. We would easily catch 25 'eyes (14-24"")in a couple of hours. For an extra bonus on calm evenings, throw floating minnows and spinners into the reeds for smallies up to 19"". Jerry and Sally are good people and will treat you well. Have fun, Cough"
537498,Guest,2004-02-17 03:51:00,0,I ventured into Anishinabi a few years ago from the portage from Wine Lake. As hard as it was to get into by boat I was amazed to see some boats and cabins. I guess the outfitters fly in to this lake? I'm not a trout fisherman so I didn't stay long but it was beautiful exploring. You think you're the only one around to see a place like that and then get fooled by human activity. Where do you fish now? I fish Wabaskang and Wine. BTW if you didn't know Wine lake camp has all new cabins now.
537528,Guest,2004-02-17 20:17:00,0,"We used to rent the cabin on the point entering Anish from Tommy Williams many years ago, and before that we took all our camping gear and tented on the island at the opposite end where you enter Anish and would carry boats and motors over the portages to the small walleye lakes. At 54 I couldn't do that anymore, but we did have some great fishing a long time ago. Now we go to Armstrong and fish Caribou Lake, excellent fishing and super cheap rates. I think though I may have to return to the Perrault Falls area and try Wabaskang and maybe try to visit some of the old haunts. Dad passed away 8 years ago. but I can see him and an old fishing buddy of his trolling for lakers in my mind on Anish now just as plain as the day they did the trolling. Used to catch 8-15 pound lakers frequently, with a few approaching 20. Not sure how the fishing is for lakers there anymore."
537540,Guest,2004-02-18 12:28:00,0,"Great to swap old stories with you Bode: Here's one for you. I took my dad to wine last summer ( after a 15 year hiatus ) after he retired at age 60. He landed a 40# Northern in the same hole my grandfather did in 1979. He looked up into the sky and said ""this ones for you Frank"". We got to thinking that this was my grandfathers birthday - July 31st. Coincidence? Aren't the memories great?!!"
537557,Guest,2004-02-19 09:33:00,0,"We are booked into Lundy's Camp for June 26th thru July 3rd 2004 so I'm getting prepaired and excited to fish this area. This will be my 9th trip to Canada but a first time for my grown son and another friend of mine that I've known for 45years, so it's time to relax, enjoy the out of doors and make some memories. Are any of you going to be their at this same time? If so it might be fun to swap some info and get aquainted. Regards, Rich"
537567,Guest,2004-02-19 12:47:00,0,"AB, was that a 40 pound northern or 40 inch northern? If your talking about 40 pound northern being caught down in Wine...I'm going back down there this year for sure! I haven't made the trip down there since I was 9 years old, we just stay on the many areas of Wabaskang and haven't really felt the need to go down there, BUT, 40 pound norhern could change my plans drastically! (Now if I could just get my Crestliner 1850 over that big rock it would really make the trip faster and more comfortable)"

537615,Guest,2004-02-20 22:12:00,0,"Sorry Big Mike, I should have wrote 40 inches. A walleye fisherman like myself wouldn't know what to do with a 40 pound northern - in a camp boat! Heck, I'd be afraid to go over the big rock with a 40 pounder in the boat! Ha! But reading your posts I know you're a pike fisherman - take a day and go to wine some year - even if you've got to leave the cresliner at Jim's camp maybe he'd give you a brother deal on one of his nicest camp boats! - That lead core line might work on Anishinabi too. Now, that is a big rock to go over!"
537621,Guest,2004-02-21 06:40:00,0,"AB, just wondering if you, or Big Mike, or anyone else reading these posts have gone to any of the smaller lakes to fish. We used to fish ""duck"" lake (I think it may be called Howard on the map) which is a portage off of Halvorsen. Also when we used to camp at the west end of Anish, we would portage to 3 small lakes at the west end. I know Anishinabi Lodge has boats cached on at least the first 2 there now, but before that these lakes were dynamite. We even portaged all the way to Zizania one day (back when I was a lot younger) and those big rocks didn't seem so big (that portage and the one to Wine were dandies for camping gear, boats,and motors). We did stay at Anishinabi Lodge one year after we quit camping and fished some small lakes around Burden that Dunc had boats cached on and had ATV's available to get to them off of logging roads and trails. Pretty good fishing but not like the ""old days""."
537656,Guest,2004-02-23 07:34:00,0,"AB...thanks for the clarification, you had me pretty excited though. A brother deal on a boat from Jim? yeah right! He'd probably let his buddy ""Billy Blue Pants"" take my boat out all day if I left it tied up to his dock and out fishing with one of his boats. I'd come back and Billy would use all my bait, lose all my lures, run my gas tank down to empty, and beach it somewhere in the low water! What a deal I'd be getting in return...Seriously, Billy's a great guy up there and looking forward to fishing with him in June and drinking a few brewskies at night in his trailer...his ""home away from home."" As far as Wine Lake goes, my wife and I might try that this summer as she is actually the most diehard Pike fisherman I have ever met, she loves to fight big Pike, and Wine definately has them swimming around."
535759,Guest,2003-11-26 18:36:00,0,"I've read several posts about Wabaskang and am truly amazed at the apparent change in this lake since the mid 1970's. We used to put in at Wabaskang and portage back to Anishinabi Lake to camp and fish some outlying lakes. At that time, we would see a few people fishing Wabaskang with very little luck. Normally we would see them bring in a few small perch and hammer handle pike with an occasional walleye. This was a long time ago (back when Tommy Williams still owned Wine Lake Camp), but I still find it hard to believe the fishing has improved that much. Just wondering if anyone such as trailerguy could shed some light on how Wabaskang became such an improved fishery, or was it always that good even 30 years ago but we just didn't happen to see anyone doing any good. We used to go the end of May or the first week in June."
535763,Trailerguy,2003-11-27 07:29:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I'm not sure, but somewhere in the early 80's, I believe commercial fishing stopped on Wabaskang. Not to say that was necasarily the whole problem. I have no problem with netting Whitefish, it can be done in a manner that has little affect on other species. Also the MNR has changed the limits and sizes on Walleyes over the years, and catch and release has become popular. The MNR has been doing creel surveys on the lake in recent years, when that data becomes known, I expect further tweeking on the limits. Tommy has another spot on the lake now, Sleepy Dog Cabins."
535921,Guest,2003-12-09 21:58:00,0,"Been fishing Wabaskang for 30+ years and fishing quality amazes me too. All I can figure is catch and release, size and creel limits, have helped out. Wabby must have awesome hatchery habitat because the pressure is greater than ever with more camps and private cottages than before. In the 70's you might have seen a few boats out fishing and now you'll see lots. Camp boats are the minority and big cruisers the majority."
535933,Guest,2003-12-11 08:31:00,0,"I think AB is right. Catch and release has really caught on over the last 5 to 10 years. Add that to the slot/size regulations that are in effect and you have the ability to make a great fishery. One of the biggest keys in my opinion though has been the high water levels over the last 5 years (not counting this year...just ask my prop and skag) with those high water years I think the lake had excellent spawns and growth rates for the fry. Also, and most importantly, there are alot of weeds in Wabaskang. The entire north end of big wabby is nothing but weeds, acres and acres of weedy, 5 to 10 foot depths teaming with baitfish for young walleyes, perch, and northerns to live off of. During most of June, July and into August many people complain about having trouble catching walleyes, but if they fished in the weeds they would limit within minutes. End of Aug, and all of Sept finally forces those walleyes out of all of those weedbeds and flats and onto more areas anglers are used to catching walleyes...reefs, weededges, and rocky points close to deeper water. Wabaskang has got alot of walleyes in the 16-19"" range, and catching them is usually pretty easy, but there are places like Gull Rock and other lakes in the area where the walleyes are easier to catch because they are on reefs and not buried in weed beds. Thats what makes Wabaskang challenging but able to withstand alot of pressure, I have friends that prefer Gull Rock and they catch hunreds of walleyes per day there without the hassles of weeds. I think most of the lakes in the area boast great walleye fishing, its just a matter of learning the lake and using the right bait/lure during the right time of year."
536047,Guest,2003-12-18 21:30:00,0,"Hey Mike, Walt Hughes here, say hello to Jim, Julie and Annie, hands down Wabaskang over Gull Rock, fished Gully for five years and got sick of fishing in two feet of water in early June. In normal water level years (not last), The Big Lake of Wabaskang can not be beat. Each year seems to get better, our group wishes we could make more than one trip per year. Each trip we learn the system patterns better and always seem to find them eyes. Each year we swear to fish Northerns, but just can't seem to catch and release enough of those Golden Eyes. P.S. -From Wisconsin -Green Lund 17' Fisherman- fish all weather-the wetter the better. Praying for normal water levels, let it snow!How's the old timer- John doing?"
536056,Guest,2003-12-19 10:57:00,0,"Hey Walt, I'll tell them all Hi for you, will be together at Christmas. I was at Cabela's last night and bought Quantum Iron baitcaster for leadcore trolling. I'm going to try a new strategy this year out off of Devil's and Doe in that deep water and try to hook up with some bigger walleyes by pulling some shad raps and wally divers in front of them out in that 35 to 40 foot water. Also think leadcore could be deadly for big northerns by trolling big rapalas out in 18 to 25' water just off weedline on the Big Lake. If it doesn't work at least I've got it for the Mississippi River. I haven't spoke to John at all this fall, I seen him couple times this summer and he looks great as usual, as well as Diosa. Later, Mike"
536080,Guest,2003-12-20 08:41:00,0,wabaskang over gullrock now there a good comparison bufwing if you were fishing in 2ft. of water in june you were probably fishing in Ranger lake not gullrock unless you were in ranger bay with the rest of the floatila who think thats the only place you can catch fish.Big Mike was right we do catch 100+ a day on gullrock and the other 4 lakes that connectto the chain avg. size 13--26in. just think if we learn to fish the weedbeds that nobody fishes.
537390,Guest,2004-02-12 19:44:00,0,"We are planning a trip there the end of June 2004 and will be staying at Lundy's Camp. What can you tell us for fishing advice and what about this particular camp. I live in Wisconsin also. You can e-mail me at [email protected] Thanks in advance, Rich"
537393,Guest,2004-02-12 22:37:00,0,How was the fishing on Anishinabi?
537398,Guest,2004-02-13 07:38:00,0,"When we fished back in the late 70's and through the late 80's the fishing on Anish was good. It is a very deep clear glacial lake and there are no walleye. It does or did have a very good lake trout population and you would occasionally pick up a big northern while lake trout fishing. There were several lakes surrouding Anishinabi that we would portage to for walleye. At that time we were about the only ones to fish them, but since then various outfitters have cached boats on them, decreasing the excellent fishing we once had."
