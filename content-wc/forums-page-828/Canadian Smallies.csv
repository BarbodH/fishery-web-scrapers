537721,Guest,2004-02-26 06:32:00,0,"I don't know about tracking schools of them. However, back about 10 years ago, I did have an interesting experience on Rainy. A buddy and I were trolling crankbaits for walleye along the windy sides of islands in or very near deep water. We ran into a huge school of bait fish which practically blacked-out or depth finder screen. We stopped trolling and pulled out our jig rods, and by the time we had done so, we had drifted very close into a small island, but we were still seeing the large band of bait fish on the depth finder. As we dropped our jigs into the water, we went from about 20-25 feet up to 8' very sharply and then went back down to 15-20'. I happened to drop my jig down on the back side of that 8' hump and before the jig hit the bottom, I had a big smallie on. Within 5 minutes, I caught and released 4 smallies with the smallest being 19"" and the largest being 22.5"", and my buddy caught 1 that was 21"" and a ""small"" one that was about 17 to 18"", but we didn't even measure it because it looked small in comparison. I believe what we found was a huge school of bait fish that were being attacked by the smallies when the school made contact with the first structure -- the island, and the little hump we just happened onto provided the attack point for the smallies. We have since tried to replicate those 5 minutes and have fished that hump many times, but have not caught a thing off it other than that one time. Were those open water fish? I don't know, but I think you could make a good case for it. I guess the lesson might be to find the big schools of bait fish, and fish in and around them, particularly if the big school makes contact with any hard structure. Good luck."
537722,Guest,2004-02-26 06:58:00,0,Try this old Crappie trick. My Grampa used to catch a Crappie and put a hook in him with about 15 feet of line on him with a bobber on the end. He would watch the bobber and when the fish joined up with the school we had Crappie fillets galore. He did this 25 years ago and I have never tried it since but it worked then...no matter how unortodox it may seem.

Only thing is instead of a bobber, we blow up a balloon about the size of a baseball/softball, 30' of line and you can stay with a school of fish all day long. Stay off to the side and cast foreword of the balloon 20-30 ft. because the balloon fish will have a harder time staying with the school if they are really on the move. It's legal here, but in other states and out of the country you'd have to check first. Hawker"
