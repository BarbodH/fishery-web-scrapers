Last year was my first time there (awesome, by the way), and my crew is just wondering if we can expect higher levels. Stay warm."
537450,Guest,2004-02-15 13:29:00,0,"Talked to a camp owner near Ear Falls the other day and his comment was the water level was very low and snow was about 30-36"" deep (and it was also -30). Don't think I want to go up there anytime soon. Hope for LOTS of spring rain."

I was uout in the area last week and there is plenty of snow. Reports are the levels should come up at least 3 or 4 feet this year."

537582,Rich J,2004-02-19 16:04:00,65,Damm! I may have to put the skid plates back on the boat.
537583,Guest,2004-02-19 16:13:00,0,Just so I get more than 1.8' of water through the rags!!!!!!!!!!!!
537584,Guest,2004-02-19 17:28:00,0,Fishing the Seul two separate weeks last year June when the water was down 9 ft. and then in late August.(within a few feet) Believe it or not the water was back to normal level in late August. Just talked with the lodge I stay at a few days ago to book this year and was told it hasn't been as bad but we'll see.
537597,Guest,2004-02-20 09:07:00,0,Will be interesting to see the early reports this year.

They said the work on the dam at Ear Falls that was supposed to happen last year is now going to be done this year. Going to keep lake level low in order to do this work. Hope it's not true, but that's what we were told."
537618,Guest,2004-02-20 23:22:00,0,It's true about keeping the water levels low so they can work on the dam. Hopefully only only one more year of low water.
