What are your thoughts? What's your choice of line for canadian walleye? (as you may be able to tell, I'm looking for something to pass the time) Thanks,"
537359,McQ,2004-02-12 08:04:00,615,Let me help you with your cabin fever. Line is the last thing to spook a hungry walleye - forget the marketing hype and fish with what you have confidence in. The last time I checked with the walleye school they weren't differenciating between north/south spawned habitat.
537365,Trailerguy,2004-02-12 09:22:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Personally I like the original Spiderwire, and Powerpro. I know a lot of people like mono, but I always hold the line between my fingers while trolling. If I wanted the line to strech, I'd use a bungee cord. I catch as many as anyone, and do even better when they are biting light. Within reason, if they are biting you're best bet is whatever line you like. :)"
537369,jigman 2003,2004-02-12 09:55:00,981,"Call me crazy, but I noticed a real difference last year in catch ratios between the yellow fireline, and clear mono. while on my fly-in. The previous years' fly-ins I was on stained bodies of water and the line did not seem to make a difference. Last year's lake was pretty clear, and I sure felt the bright line dropped my catch numbers. I'll stick with a clear mono. from now on (at least for clear water situations)."
537383,Guest,2004-02-12 14:06:00,0,I'm stritly a jig fisherman and fill that 6pd. mono the best for that type of fishing. Trolling I prefer 8-10 pd. mono.
537388,Guest,2004-02-12 16:49:00,0,"When fishing those no-brainer lakes of your's, you can use clothes line rope. Now if you go with me again for some serious fishing, stick with the Power Pro. (1 bass, 3 gills today----goin again tomorrow)"
537396,Guest,2004-02-13 05:26:00,0,Fishing most Canadian lakes you certainly can use any of the super-braids. If I find finicky walleyes all you have to do is tie on an inline swivel and tie on a leader of flourocarbon. This works very well but normally like the above post said you can get away with just about anything up there.
537434,Jigger1,2004-02-14 20:15:00,234,"I prefer mono, but I agree when fishing Canadian walleyes and they're on the prowl ... forget it ... they'll hit a Mack truck if it's in their way. One thing I've learned over the last couple years is feeding/aggressive walleyes, regardless of the where or when will hit a lead weight. I no longer fear 1/2oz jigs and will use heavier if needed in order to stay in contact with the bottom. Seems like the slamming of a heavy jig on the bottom can even turn on a walleye. I'm not saying their isn't a place and time for finesse, it's just that I've spent years not understanding the benefits of control. Heavier jigs fished accurately can tip the scales. Same goes for line, I prefer the flex of mono, but if you have the feel for braided power lines, go for it!"
537435,WillieB,2004-02-14 20:36:00,292,"If you normally use Fireline or PowerPro...use it!! I've had no problems using Fireline on fly-ins, have caught more than a few walleye on a 30lb. steel leader with 20lb. Fireline when they banged my pike offering. I use 2 set-ups, 8 lb. Fireline no leader for walleye, 20 lb. Fireline with 12"" or 18"" 30lb. steel leader for northerns. Use what you're comfortable with and enjoy."
537650,WillieB,2004-02-22 07:49:00,292,With the steel leader I don't have to be cutting and retying after a couple of hook-ups because of line fraying....just my personal preference. I'd rather have my line in the water more and be retying less.
