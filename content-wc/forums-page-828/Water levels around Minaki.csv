Has anybody seen any forecasts that would indicate that we can expect high water this spring? In my experience, the higher the water level, the better the fishing."

I agree, that water has to be moving for better fishing. <{{}}><"

But this only accounts for a small portion of normal spring runoff for the LOTW Basin. We will need rain to accompany the thaw to raise the level of LOTW and then the WPG River will have more flow. The last week has been thawing during the day and freezing at night, this has been dropping the snow fast and lots of evaporation. Lets hope for a wet spring.. Tbay Fisher."
