A few of my better pics have the dorsal upright, which looks much better. I remember seeing a fishing show with a tip on how to make a walleye's dorsal stick-up for pictures, but can't remember how. Any ideas? (Viagra is NOT an option)! Hey, I'm bored, but this should make an interesting discussion ..."
537632,McQ,2004-02-21 13:14:00,615,I have discovered that if you support the walleye under its belly and gently rock it towards the camera they will raise their dorsal fin. By supporting them properly (don't squeeze) they don't flop around and in fact are quite easy to handle. We have been using this technique on the TV show and in fact about two or three years ago I demonstrated it for the viewers. Its a real quick method of gaining a photo op and getting the fish back in the water ASAP. A walleye raises its dorsal fin for balance as I understand it. Maybe a biologist can explain it more clearly.

Take a short piece of mono, tie a loop at one end and hook the loop over the first spine on the dorsal fin. Wrap the other end around your hand, hold the fish by the gill plate or the stomach and pull the line taught, it will raise the spine and make the fish look bigger. It works especially well when holding the fish vertically, when the fins would normally lie back flat. I hope this makes sense it is very easy."
