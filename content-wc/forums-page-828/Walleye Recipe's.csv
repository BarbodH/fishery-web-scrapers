537635,Hammerhead Herb,2004-02-21 15:00:00,259,"Try this for a healthy way of grilling your fish. I modified this recipe from a newsletter out of International Falls, MN. We have been doing the fish this way at least once a week when we are up at the Caribou Provencial Park. The nice thing about this recipe is that the fillets can be made up and ready to grill hours before you want to throw them on the grill; this makes it nice for the guys who come in late from the far portage lake. Walleye and Vegetables on the Grill Serving Size : 8 Amount / Measure / Ingredient -- Preparation Method -------- ------------ -------------------------------- 8 medium walleye pike fillets 4 tablespoons butter -- melted salt and pepper VEGETABLE MIXTURE 4 cups shredded carrots 4 cups broccoli -- chopped 1 cup onion -- finely diced 2/3 cup Parmesan cheese -- grated 1/2 cup water 4 tablespoons butter -- melted Brush both sides of the fillet with butter and place in the center of the foil. Sprinkle the fillets with salt and pepper. Combine the vegetable mixture. Place approximately 1/2 cup of the vegetable mixture on each side of the fillet (1 cup total per fillet). Bring the two sides of foil together over the fish, fold leaving ample room for steam circulation. Fold and crimp ends. Cook in covered grill over medium hot coals for about 15 minutes or until the fish flakes easily at the thickest part. NOTES : For each fillet use a sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil approximately 14"" x 14""."
537519,Guest,2004-02-17 15:46:00,0,Fry up some onions with a little bit of butter . Season with salt and pepper then lay fillets on the onions and cover them with diced tomatoes . Sprinkle with basil and oregano . Then reduce the heat and cover for 5-6 minutes . Serve over seasoned rice and crack a beer then enjoy. Lower calorie option then frying :)
537525,Guest,2004-02-17 18:36:00,0,"dreye mentioned the walleye fins or as the canadians call them, walleye wings. Our group saves all the cheeks and walleye wings for the last evening and our chef/shanty B_tch sautes them in garlic butter. Nothing goes with cheeks and wings better than BLUE."
537535,Guest,2004-02-18 07:36:00,0,Better than sex???? I started taking four women with me to Canada instead of men three years ago. It has cut into my fishing time but now instead of gaining 10 lbs that week I lose weight. Need one guy to join us this year to take some pressure off of me and allow me to fish a little. If interested let me hear from you.
537536,Guest,2004-02-18 07:44:00,0,I am interested. I would love to do the dishes and cook.

537609,Guest,2004-02-20 17:58:00,0,"Alright, I guess I live a sheltered life. Exactly what are potato buds?"
537616,Guest,2004-02-20 22:16:00,0,"they are just instant mashed potato buds, you need to make sure they are the buds and not to flakes though, the flakes aren't crispy."

537480,Guest,2004-02-16 14:30:00,0,Need some simple ideas. Help?
537481,Guest,2004-02-16 14:39:00,0,Get Olive Oil so hot that it wants to jump out of the pot. Soak your fillets in egg and milk mixture powder them with bread crumbs. Throw them in the oil and when they start to float remove them and eat like a king. Coat your fillets with Ranch Dressing salt and pepper to taste. Place them on oiled cookie sheet in oven at 350. Cook until flakey and eat like a King..
537482,Guest,2004-02-16 14:51:00,0,Now we're talking!!!! Thanks...Keep em' coming.
537483,Guest,2004-02-16 14:58:00,0,"Chop up your Walleye Fillets into small pieces. Mix them in bowl with chopped onions, whipped egg, salt , pepper, and garlic powder. Smash saltine crackers and mix them with fish until thick enough to make patties. Fry in butter coated pan and fry until golden brown....Oh son , this is some good stuff."
537501,Guest,2004-02-17 07:49:00,0,Walleye Burgers...OH MY! Can anybody top that?
537505,Guest,2004-02-17 09:35:00,0,"Oh man, you guys are making me hungry. I like to grill walleye filets, cutting them into 2 inch pieces, dotting with butter, lemon juice, diced onion, favorite seasonings and a 1/4 can of beer or so for additional moisture until butter melts. Guarr-on-teed to make your mouth water. And don't forget those cheeks and fins, even on a 17 3/4 walleye, makes for some tasty morsels. The fins are the ventral or pelvic fins on underside nearest the gill. Cut out fins including skin, press knife between fins to break through cartlidge, being careful not to cut through skin. Take thumb and peel fin away from skin. I call these little babies a bonus shrimp that many anglers ignore. Cheak meat is easy to remove as well. Enjoy"
537512,Guest,2004-02-17 13:03:00,0,"I like them crispy, finally found something that works. Roll in seasoned flour, (fish mix) Dip in egg and beer mix roll in potato buds Fry in an inch of oil mmmmm crispy walleye mmmmmm I going to have some for dinner tonight."

537516,Guest,2004-02-17 15:04:00,0,"Can anybody smell them right now?Cold Blue and the sound of fish sizzling in the pan. Eat em"" while they're still smoking in your mouth and take a swig of the Blue to cool them down in your mouth. Oh my, almost better than sex."
537518,Guest,2004-02-17 15:28:00,0,"Boil up two cans of tomatoes ,large can tomatoe juice, two large onions copped, 1/2 bottle Louisiana Hot Sauce.
