537639,oldlogin,2004-02-21 18:44:00,22,"Proposal to shelf lead jigs, sinkers By Peter James Miner and News Staff( Kenora) If the federal government has their way, anglers will no longer be able to fill their tackle boxes with lead jigs and sinkers. Environment Minister David Anderson announced Tuesday he intends to draft regulations that will ban the import, manufacture and sale of the tackle because they're killing Canadian loons. ""I think laws like that are ridiculous,"" said Greg Zdep, owner of Zdep's Pro Sports. Zdep said all the alternatives to lead, such as bismuth, tin and steel are more expensive and of less quality than lead. ""There's a reason we chose lead,"" he said, noting its density and malleability of the metal make it ideal for lures. Local angler Gord Pyzer said tungsten is a worthy substitute. He said it's actually denser than lead, so the weights can be smaller. However like other alternatives it's at least 30 per cent more expensive. Zdep believes the environmental case is overstated. ""More loons are hit by cars than are killed by lead,"" he said. Pyzer said the government needs to do a good job of convincing anglers there is an environmental risk. Since loons dive to the bottom of the lake and ingest pebbles to aid in their digestion there is a risk they could consume lead products, but Pyzer said some products are at higher risk than others. He said products like bottom bouncers contain lead, but would never be ingested by a bird. A loon that consumes a jig, made of any metal, would also be eating a rather sharp hook. Tony Scheuhammer, research scientist with the Canadian Wildlife Service, said lead poisoning is the leading cause of death for loons. He studies the dead fowl sent in by concerned citizens and finds many of the birds have recently ingested sinkers or jigs. ""They're killed within a day (of ingesting the toxin),"" Scheuhammer said. Loons pick up pebbles to aid in their digestion and sometimes inadvertently eat metal tackle. They also may eat bait fish which had been cut off an angler's line. ""From the loons point of view it's probably easy pray,"" Scheuhammer said. One of the criticisms of the new policy is that is will cost anglers more money to change all their tackle. Pyzer said most local anglers will have anywhere between $100 and $1,000 worth of lead products in their tackle box. He said if the government does go ahead they should phase in the ban over a period of time. Emily Tacknyk-Roulston, an employee at Sunset Baits, said her store carried lead-free jigs at one point, but they didn't sell. All Zdep's jigs contain lead, but he is asked for lead-free products every so often when people are planning to fish in Quetico Provincial Park where a ban is already in place. ""That's the only reason they're looking for it,"" he said. Scheuhammer said his studies show the average angler spends only $3 a year on sinkers. He estimates buying the new products would only set them back a few more dollars. ""It's not going to break anybody,"" he said. Scheuhammer wasn't able to say how much more anglers would have to spend on jigs. In 1997 the federal government banned lead shot for hunting for similar reasons. Zdep said banning lead lures will have more of an impact because there are more anglers compared to hunters in Canada. Canada is not the first jurisdiction to consider banning lead in lures. Last year legislators in Minnesota tried to impose a ban, but were unable to get it passed."
