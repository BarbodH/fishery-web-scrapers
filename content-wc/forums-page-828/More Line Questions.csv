I fish almost exclusively with Mono but think I need to make the switch. I have fished the Whitefish Bay area on LOTW for six years and always caught fish on mono but am wondering if a change could increase my production even more. I am afraid that the super clear water in Whitefish would make the fireline and Power Pro a bad choice but I do have some really good areas that I like to troll in Snake Bay and Sunset Channel for Walleye and the water is much murkier in those areas. I usually bring up about 14 rods 7 spinning 7 baitcast. Should I spool some of them up with the various lines and see what works best or just stick with what I always use. I have used Fluorocarbon before in Missouri and found it to be very stiff and hard to fish with. What does everyone think?"

The mono would have to be replace every year but the spider line people said i would not have replace theirs every year so I have not. The fluorocarbon I only use as a leader, maybe 2 or 3 feet on the end. i dont know anyone that loads the whole real up with it. Spence petros said to just use it as leader because its invisible in the water."

537457,rebelrn2001,2004-02-15 20:06:00,1563,"I like to cast for Pike with the Fireline (20 or 30#). I also use it for Walleye casting but if there are lots of snags (I mean rocks that don't budge) I will always use mono (8#). That Fireline is TOO strong to break and will wreck you rod if your not careful, it will also cause some nasty cuts on your fingers if you try to break it the wrong way."
537458,bronzeback77,2004-02-15 22:04:00,97,"Thanks Guys, Is there a particular knot that I need to learn in order to connect the Fluorocarbon leader to the fireline?"

537460,Guest,2004-02-15 23:23:00,0,"the knot you want is called a blood knot. Its a little tricky but once you try it a couple of times its ""knot"" that hard. Here is a good web site that has all the knots you will ever need and they are in motion to exactly how it goes. I thought it was pretty good. www.marinews.com/fishing/fk_main.htm"
537466,Guest,2004-02-16 07:38:00,0,"I use Fireline all the time and have found the Albright knot to be the best as Fireline is so slick and much smaller in diameter than your leader, the blood knot will sometimes come apart. I have used both, just my 2cents. Also if you are putting it on a spinning or casting reel use must use mono as a backing, otherwise it will slip on reel."
537658,Toolman,2004-02-23 08:19:00,2570,"Bronzeback, I'll add a couple of thoughts on lines for you. I use mostly Flame Fireline on spinning reels for vert/pitching jigs. I almost always tie on a length (3'-6') of mono or floro leader (with a back-to-back uni-knot). To me this is the best of both worlds-sensitivity and invisability. I usually double the Fireline when tying the knot to prevent it cutting through my leader material. Lube the knot well with spit when you cinch it up. I have no problems with my connection, even trolling Erie for large 'eyes. I hate regular (smoke) Fireline for jigging as I can't see it. It's good for casting, etc. I like mono for some apps on both spinning and trolling gear. Mostly for rigging and trolling shorter leads and almost exclusively for slip-bobbering. I never use mono for vertical jigging but some times pitch jigs with it. I wouldn't put straight florocarbon on a spinning reel even if I was paid to. It does make good leader material, though, although I'm not sold on it's invisability value over mono, but it is stiffer and more abraision resistent which is some times good-sometimes bad-use the one that fits the application best. I would recommend that you try both on similar apps and see for yourself what works best for you. Tim"
