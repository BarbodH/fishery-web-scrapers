537592,Guest,2004-02-19 23:24:00,0,that was the 1st lake in canada we fished when the kids were very young. My first experience with rocks too. The first evening out i didnt understand why the motor kept jumping up out of the water! we were not going fast and after the 3rd time it hit me ROCKS. We had been fishing other lakes in the states and never hit any rocks. anyway we found a lot of fish and ate them for lunch and dinner and took limits home for everyone. We stayed at the Ojibway paradise resort. it was nice enough cant complain and the kids had fun. We went there for the next 3 years and then started going to lac saul.I just remember that eagle lake means rocks. although we did not hit any more after that first day.

Fished it for the last 20 some years and is a large body of water with tons of structure. Fishing is only allowed from 1/2 hr before sunrise to 1/2 hr after sunset (night fishing killed the lake in the 1980's) Fishing has been great since the early 1990's with a slot limit inplace and night ban (slot- no fish between 18-23 inches and only one over 23). We have caught fish over 13 pounds and a ton of fish 7-11 pounds. You will catch numerous fish in the 4-6 pound range and should find plenty of smaller ones to eat. Can be tough for a newcomer to find the fish, but once you figure it out, the walleye fishing is fantastic. We mainly fish live bait rigs with leeches and crawlers. But don't rule out crankbaits and crawler harnesses. Good luck!"

Like it was said Eagle is know for rocks as are some of the other Canadian lakes. The fishing can be great but if you are a new comer get info from the camp owner on where to go for what you are fishing for. I am sure we all have a suggestion on a place to stay, we stay at Vermilion Bay Lodge,great place and well run and great family owned camp. Good luck and if you need more info just ask I am sure many of us can help you out."
537619,Steve1,2004-02-20 23:36:00,37,"Thanks for the information guys. We are looking at the second week of July. I am bringing the family, wife and two girls, age 4 and 7. We are looking at camping at Birchdale lodge. The walleye fishing sounds great. I am also interested in smallmouth and pike, and I have still yet to catch a musky. This resort sounds the best to me so far and is right in line with priceing. I am looking into this area because it seems to be near decent sized towns. What is there to do in these towns for the family. Is there gift shops etc.? That is good to know about the rocks. I am glad I am not taking my new Lund with me. I am sure I would hit something. Thanks again. If I book into this area I will pick your brains some more. Steve"

We catch a lot of fish, have great photos to bring back and fillets, lots of memories and always leave wishing we could stay another few days. Ruth and Richard are very nice. The cabins are large, clean and pretty new. The boats work well and have plenty of storage and room for your gear. The camp fish fry as very good and the fisherman always seem to be pretty friendly. The web addy is: www.deertrail.on.ca Good luck and let me know if I can help."
537626,Gary_IA,2004-02-21 10:01:00,144,"As I recall the community of Vermilion Bay is at the north end of the lake. Years ago my brother and I took two of our nieces, ages 9 and 11, to Ballantynes on Indian Lake. Very nice accomodations a swimming pool too) and decent for Walleyes-you had to look for them. Anyway when we got tired of fishing, we would drive into town for ice cream cones. It seems the beautiful people days are not the good fishing days, so it was a nice break. We let our nieces decide how much they wanted to fish. If they wanted to stay at the cabin and play, it was allright by us. One day we took the boat to the far end of the chain of lakes and had a shore lunch (all food taken with us-didn't rely on fishing skills-would have gone hungry). My brother and the girls hiked up to another lake at the end of the trip. It was a glorious people day but not a good fishing day."

537668,Guest,2004-02-23 21:53:00,0,"Steve, Dryden is just down the road (maybe 15 miles) from Eagle. Dryden is the largest town within a hundred miles of Eagle (about 8000 people) and has most everything you and the kids require, such as Wallmart, DQ, McDonalds, Pizza Hut and a couple of gift shops. I would suggest Kuppers restaurant for breakfast or lunch, Riverview lodge for a nice dinner and you have to go to Tim Hortons for a donuts. Good luck with the fishing, it is a nice area."
537669,Guest,2004-02-23 23:04:00,0,Checkout www.andymyerslodge.com Go to fishing reports and read some. I go every summer with the kid's and it's great.
