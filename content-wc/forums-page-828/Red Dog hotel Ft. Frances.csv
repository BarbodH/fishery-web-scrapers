536199,Guest,2003-12-29 09:32:00,0,The Red Dog did close and is in the process of undergoing a major renovation. The new owner is in the tourism business (we are too) and talked to him a while back. It is going to be a good place to stay and appears it will be well run. I think the new name is Adventure Inn. Bob H.
536214,fishmaster,2003-12-29 17:27:00,209,Will they be open for the spring open season of the May 14th? If not things could get crowded this year. I don't stay there but the place I do stay at will be filled in no time then.
536253,Guest,2003-12-31 09:58:00,0,I think they will be. We went up to Ft. Frances two weeks ago for a tourism meeting and they were open for rooms but not all services yet. We did not stay overnight so did not stop in but the sign out front was advertising rooms available. Hope this helps. Bob
