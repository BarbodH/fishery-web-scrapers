Sometimes timing is everything though. Last summer the patterns were different than normal and fish were much shallower the we are used to. Plenty of great spots to fish and not a ton of summer pressure.Northerns, smallies and Walleyes only.Blair"

I still have friends that fish it, and they do pretty good, it can be hot and cold. I've spent over a year of my life on Lac Des Mille Lac so I know it quite well. Stopped going a couple of years ago when I built a cabin in the bush on Red lake, Ontario."
