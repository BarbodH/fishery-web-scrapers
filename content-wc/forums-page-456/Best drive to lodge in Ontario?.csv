1374693,wishow,2011-12-19 16:03:00,19,"Quite, flat floor front to back with pedistal seats. No climbing over bench seats. or having to stand on the hull ribs all day like the common row boats offered by some. More room and compfort, simple."
1374737,whiteyswhaler,2011-12-19 18:49:00,7,"Mike Kansas....What is the best time to go to Eagle for walleye, pike or bass?"
1374831,NARDA 1,2011-12-20 06:46:00,636,"I have fished Eagle Lake for the past 23 yrs. In June, late August and for the past several years the second week of September. Have had great success at all these times. I would say that I have caught larger fish in September and more numbers in June. In my opinion you can't go to Eagle at a bad time. As has been mentioned before, if you haven't fished Eagle before, get a guide on your first day and pay close attention to what the guide is doing, and mark your map or gps."
1374849,Mike Kansas,2011-12-20 07:49:00,1463,"Only fished there one week and we had a great week on Walleye and Smallies. That was the second week of June. We don't fish for Pike but did catch some 35"" plus Pike while jigging Walleye. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1376701,rdsanford,2011-12-27 16:18:00,37,Any ideas on a drive to going through the Soo ? Within a couple hours of the bridge.
1380073,icethief66,2012-01-07 08:54:00,1,"I would try Whitefish Bay Camp. We have been fishing there for a number of years and do well. Pull it up on the internet, pretty sure you like it. My folks are in there 70's and have gone there for I believe 17 years in a row. Good luck."

1381362,WOLF123,2012-01-10 19:42:00,30,dear sir why don't you try goose bay camp on lac suel out of ear falls we have a group going the last week of may from chicago the owner andrea is a great lady and many guys posting to the board have been going for over 10 years in a row that should say something they say just listen to her for fishing spots and should do well large body of water be careful jim wolf chicago we have been going to canada for over 35 years
1381799,Rayburn36,2012-01-11 22:58:00,17,If your not wanting to drive up to Lac Seul. Labelle's Birch Point Camp on rainy lake is 25 min from International falls Dale the owner took me out last june and we caught 80-100 walleye not 2 miles from the camp. Smallmouth is goin good up there so is the Pike.
1373935,Mich_Fisherman,2011-12-16 17:51:00,292,"I second Lake O'Sullivan. Great walleye, pike, perch, lake trout....scenery, fishing spots..... Never stayed at Rainbow... always stayed at http://www.osullivanlakeoutfitters.com/ One of the best drive-in or fly-in we've been to. Don't think you can go wrong on O'Sullivan, very reasonable and awesome fishing."
1374043,Cash,2011-12-17 08:55:00,73,"Check out Pickerel Arm Camp near Sioux Lookout on Minnitaki Lake. There are several other resorts on ""the arm"" on Minnitaki. I like this lake because if the wind is really blowing you have the option staying off the big water and still finding fish."
1374052,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2011-12-17 09:28:00,5533,That might be the simplest question on this site. Pasha Lake Cabins. No question. http://www.pashalake.com/ Chad will make sure you have one of the best trips of your life. Here is a link to my story about my first time at Pasha. http://www.forum.minnesotawaterfowle...ighlight=pasha

1374138,jiggster,2011-12-17 16:23:00,183,"You did not mention your fathers age or condition. My fathers last trip to Canada I had to consider level ground for walking, distance to fish if my dad had to get back to camp. How easy of a ride to where you fish. Think of everything he needs and you will enjoy the trip any where you go. You will always remember the memories."
1374204,Boots,2011-12-17 20:18:00,19,Check out Cherob Resort on Lac Seul just south of Ear Falls. Been going there for last 8 years. The resort is only a couple blocks off the highway. Very clean cabins and reasonable rates. Cabins are about 75 yards from the dock. We were there in Aug.2011 and in April I had broke my heel. Although the dock was only 75 yards from the dock I had difficulty walking to the dock. The owner Rob would see me hobbeling to the dock and he would come with his golf cart and give me a ride to the dock. When we got back from fishing he would give me a ride back to the cabin. Even though it would be only a 75 yard walk it would have been painfull. Rob and Cheryl take good care of thier guests. We are going back in Aug. 2012. Thanks for your concern Rob and Cheryl.
1374205,PRD1,2011-12-17 20:20:00,458,"Consider Halley's Camps at Caribou Falls on the English River, it is NW of Minaki. Fishing will be great in June with a good chance at pike over 40"", smallies in the 18-20"" range and Walleyes in the upper 20s. It's four hours from I Falls. Nice folks and nice cabins, housekeeping or American Plan. We have been going there since 2000 and are back this coming May. http://www.halleyscamps.com/"
1374326,wishow,2011-12-18 10:13:00,19,"I've decided on Eagle lake and Bear Trail Lodge, looks clean, affordable ( 200) less than Andy meyer's, and they have good carpeted boats."
1374559,Mike Kansas,2011-12-19 08:31:00,1463,You made a great choice. Eagle Lake is as good as it gets. Have a fun trip and be safe. Mike Kansas
1374564,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2011-12-19 08:42:00,5533,I've got to ask. What's the big whoop with the carpeted boats?
1373502,wishow,2011-12-15 09:04:00,19,"Looking to take my father to Ontario this year. We would be coming through International Falls.I need some input for a good drive to resort for walleye, northern and smallmouths. would prefer to rent a boat vs. towing mine all that way. Also what time of year, I'm thinking 2nd or 3rd week in June. Thanks in advance for your input."
1373508,Mike Kansas,2011-12-15 09:15:00,1463,Take a look at Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul. June is a great time and at that time of year you can catch a bunch of fish close to camp. They have great boats and top notch service. Been going there for the last six years and my wife and I love it. Any questions let me know. Mike Kansas
1373516,LOW1,2011-12-15 09:32:00,2828,"June is a great time. And there are many great lakes and great resorts. I suggest determining and prioritizing what you want to do. Some resorts emphasize fishing, some are more geared to ""creature comfort,"" some provide great meals, others you do your own cooking, etc. And you should determine your budget, as that may affect your choice as wellThere probably will be a sports/vacation show somewhere near you this winter to provide a chance to meet the owners in person, pick up literature etc. Most but not all resorts also have websitesConsider Lake of the Woods in your search -its a great place. Consider Tomahawk resort or others in the Sioux Narrows area, a great smallmouth area. Most of these resorts would be one and a half or two hours from IFalls.There's lots of people here who will have suggestions. Narrow down your idea and let us know-you will get a lot of help.."
1373564,Steve Ediger,2011-12-15 10:58:00,97,My family and friends really enjoy Lac Seul Lodge. We have been going for 14 years 2 -3 times a year. It is just South of Ear Falls with good roads all the way.
1373567,wallydave,2011-12-15 11:03:00,2151,"You might want to make your plans ASAP! The time of year you are looking at might be hard to find open cabins. I have fished our of Goose Bay Camp, near Ear Falls, for over 10 years, but Andrea might be full that week, we made our reservations in August. Try the search function here and Google Lac Seul. It is a great lake to fish!"
1373676,go dart,2011-12-15 17:28:00,77,True that Walley. Our bunch just booked our cabin on Perrault for early June. If we had waited any longer it we would of had to switch Lodges/Lake or both. To the OP consider Rocky Shore Lodge or Mauntak on Perrault. Good lodges and smaller than Lac Suel. Also you fish Cedar Lake as well.
1373794,NARDA 1,2011-12-16 08:15:00,636,"Take a look at www.bichdalelodge.com on Eagle Lake or contact the owners Cheryl and Marcel at 807-227-5262. They have what you are looking for. Great lake, great fishing (walleye, pike, smallmouth, musky, lake trout) good selection of boats, and a restaurant at the lodge. You order whatever you want to eat with the American plan instead of everyone eating the same thing."
1373826,Danbear,2011-12-16 10:35:00,72,"I am with NARDA1 Birch Dale Lodge is a great place I have been there the last 4 years and plan to continue for a long time. You can't miss on Cheryl and Marcels hospitality, hope to have my reservation in by the end of the year as soon as my gang can figure out our vacation schedules. Love Eagle Lake here is a pic of a small one I caught this year in September."
1373850,Bill Krejca,2011-12-16 12:11:00,6107,"O'Sullivans Rainbow, near Nakina, has excellent walleye fishing within sight of the lodge, also has pike and lake trout, no bass. Prices are reasonable, and it is in pristine wilderness. www.osullivansrainbow.com Bill"
1373901,Steve of Madison,2011-12-16 15:40:00,230,"Which ever camp you decide on it would be best to do it quickly, the dates you have mentioned are PRIME TIME, and many camps will be booked, the best camps booked already.Most camps give the customers from the year before first chance to book for the next year, (I have my reservation at Onaway already for 2012). My suggestion is not to wait until ""show season"" if you are set on particular weeks."
