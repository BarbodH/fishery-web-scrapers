1373752,Mike Borger,2011-12-16 04:10:00,1554,Such drama. Can't believe this is even being discussed.
1373753,GOBIG,2011-12-16 04:18:00,126,"This post has given me a lot of good examples. I posted it, because i knew other people have had issues like this. I sent you a pm"
1374866,northernbite,2011-12-20 08:29:00,1186,"Juls hit it on head, your trying to make him happy and all he does is make all of you unhappy. I bet he never goes again anyhow. I have a group that goes every year and we tent camp. Me being a little over bearing at times just tells the ones that have problems and what we expect. Not helping in camp is a big problem to me. I could go on but you can't pick your relation but you can pick your fishing buddies. Merry ChirstmasPaul"
1376497,nitrox,2011-12-26 21:37:00,21,"Personally, if this is your Dads brother, I would wait for him to bring it up that he really wants to be included in 2013. I would have a meeting with all that are for sure going and get there input. If the majority do not want to deal with his attitude, I would suggest your Dad be the one that talks to your Uncle. He is either your Dads brother or his brother in-law, similar age, that way your not disrespecting your Uncle, let Dad do it."
1376996,5thsuit,2011-12-28 19:08:00,54,"In 2004 I uninvited a 16 year guy who over time had become a pain! When the other 4 guys in our group said they would not go if he did, it made the decision easy. A 20 year friendship ended and I have never talked to him since. I knew the group was right and even I found it stressful to fish with him! It is not easy being the one to deliver the news! The trip is now much better without him."
1378478,rockrunner,2012-01-02 16:47:00,205,Tell your uncle to read this thread you started...That would pretty much solve your problem.
1379001,prov1900,2012-01-03 21:28:00,544,"We all have gone through this before...if you haven't you are either going alone on your trips, or are very lucky. It doesn't matter if it is family or not, it is still tough. I don't envy you. In my own experience, those people have weeded themselves out...albeit eventually. Time heals all. Just don't let it take too much time that should be spent enjoying the week of the trip and the remainder of the year prepping for it and the next trip."
1379245,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-01-04 16:33:00,235,"Honesty and being direct are your best chances for resolving the situation. It's hard though, and there may be fallout, but you have to confront it head on. He has to know that his behavior makes the trip hard to enjoy."
1365095,LOW1,2011-11-14 09:35:00,2828,Perhaps put some specific expectations/rules/duties in writing which everyone agrees to in advance and which are posted at the camp. If that still doesn't work you need to exclude him.
1365101,Golden Eagle,2011-11-14 09:57:00,2642,"Whan one person in your party keeps you guessing, dump him. Playing his game soon becomes making the trip about him, rather than the trip itself."
1365146,wallydave,2011-11-14 12:24:00,2151,"LOW has an idea here! Have a planning meeting, who is bring what, ect. Say something like, ""we want to try rotating the cooking, cleaning shores, so here is a schedule..."" Discuss the plans with the group, intoduce the new person and maybe uncle will get the hint. A big part of the what makes a trip memorable is how the group works together to make shared memories that all can enjoy!"
1373265,Shotgun,2011-12-14 12:14:00,759,"I'd suggest this approach: ""Uncle Mr Unhappy, for several years you've did nothing but complain on every trip you've taken and it has appeared you have not been happy or satisfied on the groups decisions and members. So we took that attitude and your decision not to go on the 2012 trip as meaning no desire to go again. Sorry if it was miss understood but we have already asked another person for 2013. If your still interested for 2014, then we need to discuss."" This tells him your tired of his complaining and still does not banish from thinking he is not wanted. Lots of things can change in a couple years and make this issue a non-factor. Good luck as these types of scenrios are always difficult and challenging."
1373308,doubleheader,2011-12-14 14:05:00,2652,"I agree with much of what has been posted above. What's the old saying, ""Pick your friends cause you can't pick your relatives?"" A couple things I wonder about in your post. Is your Uncle older and if so, is he getting a good night's sleep? You say his issues seem to progress as the days go by, it just makes me wonder if he's getting worn down. Also, is there someone in the group he really takes to and respects? I would think this is the person that should sit him down one on one, and just tell him what the issues are. Someone who could say "" Hey, you're family, we love you but if you want to go back to Canada next year you need to hear some things, some things that may be tough for you to hear, and we need to know you'll make a sincere effort resolve these issues, now, do you want to hear those things or not?. If so, let's crack a cold beer and have a heart to heart."" There could be lots of reasons for his behavior, maybe it's money, maybe family concerns, or something medical. He deserves a chance to fix things. If he doesn't , well, he's out. BTW, is your Uncle a chronic complainer when he's home? If so you probably don't have much of a chance to solve this other than replacing him"
1373309,Mohleye,2011-12-14 14:06:00,368,"Once you see how much more enjoyable your trip is without him, dis-inviting him won't seem nearly as difficult...."
1373376,Spider01,2011-12-14 18:50:00,3,"Why not add another person in 2013? If it is a boat issue, then have the new guy bring a boat partner."
1373397,johnboat,2011-12-14 20:27:00,2014,"Agreed, Mohleye. I think after year one I would have solved the problem. Ever been bit by the same dog more than once?...............................Me either. Time to put on the big boy pants and TCB...........Tactfully , of course."
1373435,Hawker,2011-12-15 05:35:00,3967,"Your all adults,,, right?? Sorry if I come off rude or blunt but it sounds as if y'all need to man-up and be point blank with the Uncle if in the future he decides ""he"" wants to join the group again! Sounds as if y'all are relieved he isn't going in 2012 for a variety of reasons but yer already borrowing ""trouble"" for 2013! If the trip goes well and everyone is happy on the upcoming trip for 2012 ya just let the Uncle know point blank there is no opening for future trips unless something changes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, mainly his attitude and willingness to be a ""part"" of the group!! Life's too short to cater to folks (family or not) that drag ya down and make things miserable!!"
1373729,Moosebunk,2011-12-15 21:09:00,211,"You can't go wrong with the truth.Uncle or not, you have examples of his past behaviours and how they effect you all negatively... it's as simple as saying... ""Uncle dood, you are family so I have to love ya in a way, but, you're a total buzz-kill for me and the group on our trips, and we have decided that our having a good time will be more easily achieved, if your continual making for a bad time is left at home... forever."" There... copy and paste that in an email, but send along a nice parting gift like a bottle of scotch... to him... and then me as well. Thanks."
1365022,GOBIG,2011-11-14 05:55:00,126,"Looking for some advice on a family type issue. I have been going to Canada for almost 10 years with my Dad, Uncle, and a few great friends. My Uncle has decided not to go 2012, so we got a guy whom has fished with us before. My group is never going to be more than 6 for several reasons. My Uncle is one whom ever year complains of money, and tells us he is not going next year, does several small things to only benefit himself, has issues with the food menu but never says anything until in camp, has issues with a new guy for no reason at all, but he is a great fisherman. We have all not said anything to him at the time of his little acts, for betterment of the trip. What do I tell him for 2013 if his replacement works out just fine, which I really think he will. Do I confront him via email, or phone in regards to his issues. This is not just me complaining, I have talked to all of the party and we all agree that we are going to have a problem. Any advice would be great."
1365029,NARDA 1,2011-11-14 06:14:00,636,Have a meeting prior to the trip and discuss the issues as a group.
1365031,GOBIG,2011-11-14 06:24:00,126,"We kinda do that. However, he never calls or answers emails. We have to call him. We have all talked to him before the trip, he agrees with everything, then when we get there as the week goes on, he starts his little acts. One more thing, he does nothing to help get ready for trip."
1365033,jiggster,2011-11-14 06:27:00,183,"I agree with Narda 1. This is for the whole group to discuss with him, not just you. Did he say to hold his spot for 2013?"
1365036,rebs,2011-11-14 06:28:00,7587,"As already stated, have a meeting of everyone involved and I would include your uncle.Be polite, calm and have one spokesman for the group. Not everyone jumping on his back. You don't want to gang up on him, but express the views of everyone involved with everyone present. Also give him an opportunity to address hie views as well.Enetr this meeting with an open mind and try to resolve the issues so as you are all still friends and speaking to each other when the meeting is over."
1365040,Juls,2011-11-14 06:46:00,13414,"Go ahead with the ""group meeting"". No matter how or what you say to him, he will see it as a ""gang up"" and cop an attitude and never talk to any of you again. Problem of who's going to Canada in 2013 will be solved. But, now you have a pissed off Uncle.Some people are just ""that way"". There's nothing you can do to change them.Life's too short to have grouchy people on your vacations.....family or not.If he's never happy there, then there's no need for him to go with you. He can find something else to do with his vacations that will make him happy....if that's possible.Some people are just happier complaining through life while others try to enjoy it. It's like trying to mix oil and water.I like to call those kinds of people ""Psychic Vampires""...they suck your positive/optimistic attitudes out of you until you are just as miserable as them. Then, and only then, are they happy.Group thing or one on one...it will have the same results...he will get mad and not speak to you for a while. But, you will get to enjoy your vacations for a change. Either way, I would not feel guilty if I were you. Good luck!Just my two cents....Juls"
1365043,Hot Runr Guy,2011-11-14 06:52:00,16061,"Leave open the possibility that maybe HE'S been looking for a way out of the yearly trip. Once he knows that you've found a replacement, and he doesn't have to go anymore, all might be good. HRG"
1365090,3M TA3,2011-11-14 09:18:00,2846,"Give your Unlce one last shot to go. Let him know, as well as everyone else in the group, that if you give up your spot one year but want to come back again, you have to wait until there is a vacancy, Same rule for everyone. Do this at a meeting with all participants and then your Uncle won't feel ganged up on and he will understand the rule just like everyone else."
1365091,Larry Mac,2011-11-14 09:22:00,530,"Hi Gobig, I agree with Juls as we have been in these situations (but not involving family) before. It is tough when you have a sour grape in the group. This has cost us relationships in the past. We try to be careful on who we bring but like other situations, sometimes people change when they get into camp. Good luck and have a great trip.Sincerely,Larry Mac"
1365093,Juls,2011-11-14 09:25:00,13414,That's a very good idea.
