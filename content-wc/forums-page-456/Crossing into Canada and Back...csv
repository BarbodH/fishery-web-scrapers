I have searched hi and low for info on this and cannot find anything concrete as to its validity...Anyone on here heard of such a thing? It's supposed to be @ $45 instead od @$100 for a normal passport.P.S. Links from the owners own brochures took me to some Canadian Govt. websites that said all you needed to ctoss was a picture ID and Birth Certificate."

It is essentially a passport, but doesn't work for air/ship travel...i.e. you couldn't use it to go to Jamaica, etc. The US still requires one of those two for for re-entry. Canada doesn't require a passport, they just recommend it and prefer it, I think just doing US citizens a favor by making sure they have it to get back home...."
