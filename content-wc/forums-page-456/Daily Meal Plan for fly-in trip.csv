We got 4 guys going in for 7 days and am hoping to see some meal plans/grocery lists to help us figure out how much and what to get. I've trolled through the boards here, but havent really seen anything to detailed."

1379837,Golden Eagle,2012-01-06 12:54:00,2642,"Breakfast and one other meal, or maybe just breakfast. No shore lunch-that's when huge pike eat. If I plan a dinner meal in camp, I tell the guys I'll understand if they're into fish and don't want to break away for a meal. Weather and the bite dictate meal times. Leftover fish, sliced bread and a sweet onion are usually in my boat. Pretzels and ginger snaps go into my storage tub the first day of the trip. We've never had a fisherman starve.A good friend of mine, who is on this board, allowed his fishing time to be set by a cook (June). Caused him to miss a lot of good fishing time. Hopefully he's grown hair where he needs it. This should get him out in the open unless he's busy moving snow."
1379869,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-06 14:23:00,1460,"Disagree. We start early with fruit and yogert light breakfast and on the water early. We have lunch around 1:00 and back fishing by 3:00. Usually call it a day around 8:30. Lunch is always fish. If is a warm frount day we eat it fryed. If cold frount day, we make chowder or blue cheese linguine. Dinner is usually centered around a pasta, black and blue burgers with fetticini, con pollo, steaks and chops, the works! Being the cook in my outfit, I will have a lot to say about when we are on the water. There is a lot of camp chores to take care of as well which dictates when to come in as well. I would have a big problem if someone on my crew grew this wild hair of insolence. To the op, a fly-in fishing trip is more than numbers of fish caught or time spent on the water. Be prepared, enjoy yourself, enjoy the people you fish with."
1379875,new hips,2012-01-06 14:41:00,498,"Last year, I made fish everyday..........make it different every other day. We love the beer battered the best. Check in General discussion under Walleye recipes, there are some really good ones. We ate walleye as hor d'ourves or main meal everyday, it was always eaten. I have a list of all supplies from last year, it's just not on my computer yet. If you need help PM me, I have to get around typing it into a Word file."
1379879,jambi,2012-01-06 14:47:00,504,"I enjoy reading these posts about the big groups that go up and the sometimes choas about meals, cooking, chores, travel, etc. I've always only been with my Dad or my good buddy. Two man groups are so easy to accomodate each other on this stuff = = more time on the water!Bacon wrapped grilled walleye was our new experiment this year; man that would taste great right now!"
1379900,Lovetofish,2012-01-06 15:49:00,458,"A light breakfast of cereal/muffins/peanut butter toast/juice then a big fish fry every night back in camp. For lunch we bring sandwiches/chips,fruit/cookies/beef sticks and a couple days we roast brats/hot dogs on a beach fire. The brats I boil the night before and they re-heat very quick. Use small tortillia's for bread. We brought a small propane grill last year because of the fire ban which you may not be able to bring on a fly-in. Every trip we always get rained out one morning or the family wants to sleep in so then we have a big breakfast. The last night we grill a steak or chop."
1379909,5richards,2012-01-06 16:17:00,131,"Your meal plan for a fly-in really depends on your group. Since you only have four it should be relatively easy. Neither Golden Eagle or Pikeslayer is right or wrong -- it depends on how you want to fish. If your group wants to get up early and ""get at it"" as quickly as possible, then you need to do a simple breakfast --- list to follow --- The next question is does you group want to come back to the camp for lunch [regardless of time] or do they want to do a shore lunch or a boat lunch??? You can continue to fish with the latter --- again -- personal preference, which can change during the week with scheduling.[list to follow]. Dinner is again a group decision --- do you come back and eat [and at what time?] and go out for the evening bite --- or do you eat a late dinner. Remember -- it's a vacation and just because you are "" Flying in"" doesn't mean you are going to rough it -- Four of us ate quick b-fast meals of juice - ham/egg and cheese sandwiches and milk -- cereal -- and egg beaters. Also -- I'm partial to left overs for b-fast. The night before we packed sandwiches-- drinks-- and snacks for the next days lunch -- they consisted of various cold cuts and cheese and tuna in the pouch etc----- ---- We did several shore lunches with the proverbial potatoes/beans and fish and enjoyed it --- but the itch to get back out and fish is tremendous --- sometimes you just have to say settle down and enjoy!!! Dinner for us mostly was after fishing and was usually simple --- one or two pasta nights with frozen meatballs etc -- Walleye at least three nights fried/baked etc --- a burger night and a chicken night. Possible provisions for you---- Fully cooked ham --- egg beaters -- Bread ---- cereal/oatmeal --- powdered juices/lemonade/tea ---oil for cooking -- breading mix packages --condiments---dried potatoes-- frozen veges -- they don't weigh much and help to keep things cold --pasta -- sauce -- frozen burgers/chicken/steak etc --- see what your group wants!!! good luck"
1380049,orchard frank,2012-01-07 07:45:00,1900,"We always played it easy, shore lunch everyday, no strict planning, but your question reminded me of one of my all-time favorite movie lines (from Grumpy Old Men) ""I eat bacon for breakfast, bacon for lunch, and I drink supper"""
1380056,a3dad,2012-01-07 08:03:00,115,"It really depends of the amount of effort you want to go through in camp and how important eating is to you. On our trips (2 people) we like to keep it as simple as possible. Eggs for breakfast, cold-cut sandwiches for lunch. We pre-make dinners at home and freeze them and just reheat at camp. One or two nights we'll make a steak but that's about it. No mess, easy cleanup, and we can use the rest of the time to fish or just chill with a beverage in hand. Oh, we mainly pike fish so we don't bother with cooking walleye except for one night."
