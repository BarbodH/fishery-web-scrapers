1247471,eyeman_1,2010-11-07 16:45:00,690,"Been investigating this camp on LOTW as an alternative to Wiley Point. Does anyone have any advise - good, bad, or ugly stories? Looking at taking my 69yr old dad up in July or August. Boats sound like they are pretty decent for camp boats so I would not need to bring up mine. From corresponding with the camp it seems like a pretty good spot. Anyone know how the fishing for eyes, smallies or ski's is in that area. Is this camp located in a very busy section of the lake? Any info or advise would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
1247477,wingmann,2010-11-07 17:31:00,42,"This is an excellent camp. I have been going every other year for about 10 years now. We usually have a group of about 10 of us. Gail and Steve do everything they can to make the trip one to remember. This is in a remote area where there isn't another camp for quite a ways. The walleye fishing is great, northerns and smallmouth pretty good and muskies are very good. Perch fishing has been very good the last few years. They have fishing pros on staff that will get you up to speed on the current fishing trends, depths and lures to use. You are welcome to go out with them at any time. The staff works very hard to keep the guest happy. If you do the American plan, the food is really good and it's all you can eat. The boats are typically lunds with 40 hp Yamahas with electric start, electric trolling motors, live wells or you can get the upgrade boat to the Crestliners which are wider. If your father has a tough time getting around, they have a golf cart for those who could use it. We bring a friend who is in his eightes and they have one for him every time we come up. The whole staff can't seem to do enough for him.If you choose this resort, you will have a great time.Good luck with your decision.Wingmann"
1247521,Hunter4,2010-11-07 20:33:00,65,"Eyeman,Without a doubt this is one of the nicest camps I've ever had the pleasure to stay at. There are a million reasons to stay with the folks at Witch bay Camp. The people, the boats, the food and the service are all top-notch. You will not be disappointed."
1247532,2Labs,2010-11-07 22:07:00,685,"Wingmann and Hunter 4 hit it correctly.I just made my 30th trip there in August. Started going to Witch Bay Camp in 1993 and after I retired I started going twice a year. Haven't been to any other camp since I found WBC.Fishing for walleyes is great. Smallies good. Northerns very good. Muskies excellent (although that is not my cup of tea). Don't forget about Perch either, if you like eating them.The camp boats are an excellent choice if you don't want to trailer yours up. I have thought about using them, but my wife and I really like our boat and so I trailer it up on the first trip of the year, leave it there, and trailer it back after the second trip of the year. Several of their customers do that, by the way.Food is great. Service is great. Dock space is assigned (you can put your own ropes out if you wish or use theirs, bumpers out if you wish or use theirs) so you always get the same spot every day. The dock boys meet you when you come in and help you dock the boat, clean and freeze your fish for you, and do everything they can to make sure you get a first class time on the water. The cabin girls bring coffee to your cabin door at 6 A.M. if you wish, clean your cabin while you are out fishing, make sure anything that you want changed in the cabin gets done, and even walk your dog if you bring one along (I have 2Labs ... and the girls spoil those Labs something fierce ... lol).If you have a problem with your own boat, the dock boys will fix it if they can (one of them use to be a GM Mr. Goodwrench and knows a heck of a lot about boats and mechanical issues!), and if they can't Steve will get you first in line at a marine dealership and even take your boat into town for you while you use a camp boat. One year I got a chip in my windshield on the drive up and Steve took my truck into town to get that repaired while my wife and I went fishing. They don't want you to miss a day on the water!Most of their clientele is repeat business. My wife and I have made MANY friends with the other customers there ... and we all try to schedule our trips so that we have a ""reunion"" with those friends every year. We exchange e-mails and even go out as groups of boats because we enjoy each other's company and because the fishing is good enough to handle a couple of boats on a pod of fish (and when we burn out one pod we just go find another).I wouldn't be spending my time and money there if this was not a first class organization.If you make reservations, be sure to tell Gail if your dad has problems getting around and she will make sure one of the golf carts is available for you for your entire trip there."
1247541,bellbuoy,2010-11-08 04:00:00,490,"I first went to Witch Bay in '98 and have made several return trips there. In fact I just made a reservation to take my 14 yr old there in May of next year for our first father & son Canadian trip. Gail & Steve put a lot of money back into the camp each year to improve the camp. Whether it be bathrooms in some of the cabins, docks w/ electricity (I think they have expnded the docks two or three times), air conditioning in some cabins, upgraded boats to rent, guided fishing, new cabins, they just don't ""milk"" the camp. Plus they are really nice people. My first year there I arrived and discovered that I left my Lowrance at home, they didn't rent me one they loaned me one for the length of the trip. You will not be disappointed."
1247586,@Lunker,2010-11-08 07:59:00,835,"I too have been a long-time visitor to WB - probably 35 trips over the past 16 years. Previous responses seem to answer most of your questions, and honestly so IMHO. To candidly add my .02 re the time of year you're looking at, from my experiences.... Northerns will be a bit tougher because they tend to go deeper and scatter as the water warms. Yet we like to say the muskies really start to turn on as the water temp reaches 70 degrees in early to mid-July. Smallies are ever-present with changes in presentation, again, as the season wears on. Walleyes? What can I say? I don't think there's a bad time to fish them on LOTW. And that fishery has just been getting better and better as time goes on. Excellent recruitment and, because the forage base is so plentiful, they are truly fat piggies. I heard many people say ""the best year yet"" the past 3 years re the walleye fishing.Highlights of my 3 trips this past summer include 100 fish (walleye) days before lunch; 60 fish (smallmouth) days; and 44 1/2"", 36"", and 48 1/2"" muskies in a week....and I was fishing for northerns! In addition, during our late August / early Sept trip, my son caught his first muskie and his largest walleye to date.I've fished with and around at least two of the four previous responders and if they knew me by my handle, they'd tell you I don't B.S. about my fishing success (or lack thereof, even though I am a ""fisherman""). One additional tidbit requested would be that WB is a remote drive-in camp and the nearest camp is 10 miles away by water. So there is very little competition from them, and I use the word ""competition"" loosely.The water is so big, with so many places to fish, that you never need worry about getting crowded out. That having been said, don't let the size of the water scare you. First, the camp staff will do everything necessary to familiarize you with it, even to a quick guided tour on your first day in camp if that's all your arrival time permits. Secondly, as you should do with every new body of water you fish, break it down into small sections and learn them (with camp's help as previously mentioned).Good luck in making your decision and hopefully you'll have fun wherever you decide to go."
1248900,brian1785,2010-11-13 21:23:00,1534,"I've been going up there for the last 10 years, twice a year, with my 72 year old dad. I haul my 19 ft glass Yarcraft up there from the Chicago suburbs. I would not go anywhere else. Steve and Gail treat you like their own family. Everything everyone has said is true. It is a great place to go and you will catch fish. We go in early June and then again the first week of August. Started going when my daughter was 9 years old and now she just went off to college this year. If you need more details just send me an email and I'll talk more. Highly recommend it! Brian[email protected]"
1251841,Blackwatercats,2010-11-26 10:28:00,23,"Funny that you ask about those 2 specific camps. I worked at both of them around 10-12 years ago in back to back years. My first year was at witchbay the year steve took over from his dad. The next year was at wiley point the last year Ron was manager. I think back to those years as the happiest of my life. Sometimes I want to just drop everything leave my life and stress here in winnipeg and go back for good spending my days living the simple life as a fishing guide in Gods country. anyway both lodges are awesome can't say a bad thing about either. At witch bay I remember doing my minnow run and some regulars from Chicago were up. One older gent would come on my minnow runs with me. I think his name was teddy bob or that might be a bar he owned in Chicago. His sons were bear hunters. I wonder if they are still coming up?Saw the first 2 muskies of my life in the hayfields before I even knew what they were. Two massive follows on back to back days.....didn't even know what a figure 8 was...lol...If your on LOTW you can't go wrong, it's just about the accomodations and you won't be dissapointed. I have not been back to witchbay since I left so long ago mostly because there are so many access points to LOTW way closer to winnipeg but I am determined to get back to visit steve and gail and do some musky fishing in the hayfields. Maybe this yeargood fishing Donovan pearasewww.blackwatercats.com"
1382525,ManitowishWaters,2012-01-13 17:21:00,39,"Booked a trip here with my wife for the first week of Sept. Have been fishing Canada for the past 16 years the first week of Aug. Wondering what to expect....I know the guide staff will help when I am there, just have no idea what to expect. Hopefully can keep the wife interested, sounds like the camp is great."
1382606,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2012-01-13 22:00:00,629,"Eyeman_1:On page 8 of the ""Canada"" forum, there is a thread that I wrote on my stay @ Witch Bay Camp this past September/2011. The thread is: ""A stay @ ""Witch Bay Camp/LOTW"". I believe there are 10 to 12 posts associated with the thread. I didn't report on the camp boats of the resort, because I trailered mine into the camp. Along with alot of good things to be said about Witch Bay, the camp boats are some of the best I've seen on LOTW. Plus one can upgrade to a wheel boat if they so choose. #1. Camp Boat as I remember: 17' Crestliner/40 or 50 Yamaha tiller/Bow Mount electric & 2 depth finders. #2. Upgrade: 17' Crestliner single console/50 or 60 hp Yamaha's/2 depth finders (frt. & rear) + electric bow mount. My only negative opinion revolved around the 7 mile road leading into the camp pulling a boat. Not the best! Took me 45 minutes to an hour to traverse the 7 miles. Not alot of places to have 2 vehicles pulling boats to pass. Witch Bay sounds as if it would fit your situation quite well. Plus, it is at the end of a very long bay & one could fish with a lot of protection from the wind. Set the Hook, CRJohn"
1382626,2Labs,2012-01-14 02:46:00,685,"Be sure you let Gail know that you want to go out with the camp guides. They will actually take you out in their boat if you wish and teach you the water and help you find the species of fish you are looking for. You have chosen a resort that is run by people and which has workers who will bend over backward to make your stay a good one. Like the prior posts all say (including mine from November, 2010) ... this is a place where you are family the first day you set foot in camp. First rate place with a first rate staff and guides.@Lunker (2 posts earlier on this thread) is a friend of mine whom I met in camp there. And, as he says, he tells it like it is."
1247760,eyeman_1,2010-11-08 17:57:00,690,"All, Thanks for the replies. Sounds like we are making the right choice. We've been staying at Wiley Point one of the Totem Resorts and were looking for a different palce and new waters. I am going back and fourth about towing my 20' ProV up. It's a long haul from around the Chicago area. Thanks again all."
1247840,@Lunker,2010-11-09 07:06:00,835,"Hauling your boat will be a matter of personal choice. It's generally accepted that, no matter how good the camp boats are, you're always more comfortable fishing out of your own boat. Since you depart for Wiley from the Totem landing, you know how long a drive it is for you. There is one couple that tows their 20' Cressi from San Antonio, TX. 'Course, they stay for 3 weeks! And there was one group that towed a boat from OK for 3 days of fishing. Now THAT'S desire to fish in your own boat. Now that you're at least close to making your decision, the anticipation begins.Be sure to post a report after your trip detailing your likes (or dislikes) about WB."
1247921,Beagle_Nut,2010-11-09 13:57:00,52,"My wife and I are looking for a new place next year and this one sounds really nice. We only fish for northerns, and we always go during the last part of September into the first part of October. Does anyone have any experience fishing for northerns this time of the year in this part of LOTW? Thanks."
1247949,@Lunker,2010-11-09 15:33:00,835,"Witch Bay is an American Plan resort. Typically they close up ""toward"" the end of September, depending on the weather.However, they do have a couple of cabins that are rented out on the housekeeping plan late in the season.Not too many guests at Witch Bay target northerns at that time of year. But I can tell you that people fishing muskies at that time also tie into some very nice northerns - high 30's to low 40-inch. The slot limit on LOTW is becoming very successful in developing a trophy class northern fishery."
