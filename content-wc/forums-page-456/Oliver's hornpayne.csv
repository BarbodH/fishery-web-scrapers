1380759,TIGHTLINER,2012-01-09 13:02:00,223,Thanks that is the same as i got just thought i would get someone on here that went to oliver's to see what kind of fishing and the name of his lakes. If these lakes have sat for 10 years they should be teaming with fish. Maybe other outfitters picked up oliver's lakes.

You may find some more info if you do a search for ""Oliviers"".Two of Oliviers handful of outposts have another outfitter operating on the lake...they're not single cabin lakes.Johnston's out of Hornepayne also have a camp on Bayfield lake.http://flyinfishingcamps.com/index.htmlWhite River Air also has a large popular camp on Gourlay.http://www.northtoadventure.com/lake_detail.php?lid=12The other Olivier lakes, Buffalo Island, Linbarr, White Owl and Little Kaby I know nothing about.For what it's worth Johnston's in Hornepayne is a little known outfitter with some small but very good lakes."
