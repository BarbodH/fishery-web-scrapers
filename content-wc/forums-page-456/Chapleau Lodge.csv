I've thought many times about fishing the Borden but can't seem to pull myself away from the Chapleau. Anyway, I too am interested in some experience reports, not so much for the Lodge but for the body of water."

As is the case, it took us 2 days to find fish, but once we did, we caught alot. We went down the river pretty far....a couple of miles....to a few bays off the main river. We caught fish on jigs with worms, jigs with plastic, and crawler harnesses. One little bay in particular we hit the northerns with swimbaits. We were there the week of Fathers' Day.I'd go back, but there are so many places to go"
