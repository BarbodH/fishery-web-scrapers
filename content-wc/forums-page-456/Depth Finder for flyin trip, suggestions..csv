1379309,Curryale,2012-01-04 20:02:00,50,I use my Lowrance X67 Ice Machine with a regular transducer on it. It gets 3 or 4 days from one of the batteries that it comes with. With two batteries you can get by the whole week if the backlight is turned down. I have used it on three trips without complaints.
1380052,SSH,2012-01-07 07:53:00,526,"Last summer, on a fly-in my brother-in-law brought a Humminbird 140C or some other depth-finder on a stick. It worked OK when just slow-trolling, but at any speed over 5 mph it was worthless. If you don't care to see the depth when cruising, it will suffice. I am glad on our last fly-in, one of the guys brought an extra Fishmark 320. It used a regular high-speed transducer on a bracket . Using the Fishmark 320, we could see when the the depth when cruising so we could avoid hitting any more rock piles just under the surface. Luckily, the outfitter had rock shields on the lower units of all the motors. Also, the guy brought extra 12v 8 ah batteries and a solar charger. The solar charger worked great. Re-charged the batteries in 1/2 day."
1380070,Guest,2012-01-07 08:39:00,0,"As the owner of a fly-in fishing resort I personally use a Lowrance Mark X DSI portable. With 8 good D cell batteries, you should get 5 full days of use. I rent out the regular Mark X and the batteries last a bit longer. Both are awsome units. DSI has water temp and a little better graphics. Very simple to use.....I. spent 22 days in the bush fishing last summer and were trouble free. Hope this helps."

1375403,FrankLeigh,2011-12-21 17:31:00,80,"Avoid the Eagle 350 FishEasy portable. This is a colour unit and has a lot of features and a beautiful display, but it eats batteries like candy, 8 AA batteries last only 6 to 8 hours, and that is with many features turned down or off. Rechargeable AA's do not work, as they do not provide enough voltage. Stick to a basic model and check the current draw in the manual. My old Hummingbird Piranha lasted almost 2 weeks on a set of batteries.Also, don't rely on the suction cup for the transducer. It is sometimes difficult to make them stick and they keep falling off. I bolt my transducer to the bottom of a 24"" piece of 1"" x 2"" aluminum angle and use a C-clamp to hold it to the transom. You can pack it in your rod case. A few plastic cable ties come in handy as well.Have a great trip!"
1375593,Pooch,2011-12-22 10:01:00,4619,"You can stop losing your suction cup transducer by cleaning the moss and slim off the transom before you mount the suction cup. Take a green scrubbing pad (hardware stores) with you on the trip and really scrub the transom where you want to mount the transducer of the rental boats. They set in the water all summer and get a really good growth of algae on them. Avoid rivets or any surface irregularities.I've used them with great success for nearly fifty trips. Rarely ever have one come loose. Be sure to tie a string from the boat to the cup mount that is short enough to avoid the prop if the cup does come off. Before mounting the suction cup feel under the boat for the stringers and avoid mounting behind them. Split the difference between two of them if possible.If you spend a little time mounting the transducer and tinker with how deep it runs you can hold bottom contact at about any speed. Watch the angle front to rear also. When the boat is at speed the transducer angle changes from when you mounted it setting still at the dock.When you're done fishing, store the suction cup flat and not bent over or creased.Good luck.Pooch"
1375605,IaDave,2011-12-22 11:05:00,476,I have had good luck just putting the transducer in the boat and shooting thru the hull. Just have it rest in a little water and sitting in the right position. This is with a Eagle portable.
1375618,FrankLeigh,2011-12-22 11:41:00,80,"I understand what you are saying, Pooch, but we have not always been fortunate enough to get an alum boat with a nice flat area where i need it. Over many years,we have had steel boats with some rough welding repairs and spatter, and cedar strips with fibreglas patches and others with a plywood transom, that you just can't clean, and alum boats that just don't have the flat area that you need.I haven't found a boat yet that the alum angle and c-clamp couldn't handle. The alum angle and alum clamp only add a few ounces to my gear, and it eliminates one potential problem. By the way, when I used my Eagle for the first time, I tried the suction cup. Brand new, out of the box, it had a tiny split in it. It would not hold for more than 5 minutes.Just saying."
1375687,Catman59,2011-12-22 16:25:00,345,I have used an old Bottomline Fishin Buddy 1200 for 10 years. Its got side scan and works very well for what it is. Mine still runs on 3 C Cell batteries. It will run for a LONG time on 3 batteries. I picked up a second one on Ebay for $65. The only bad thing is that you cant run very fast with them in the water as they will walk out of the holder.
1375780,Guest,2011-12-23 06:18:00,0,"No experience on Bow Lake but have fished many lakes in that general area. As soon as you are dealing with a lake trout/walleye combination in the Turtle River system you can expect clearer water. That normally translates into a tough walleye bite. That being said, you should expect a reasonable flurry as the sun starts to set. Concentrate on the bass and lake trout in the middle of the day and go out for walleye after supper. On another note, you do not need to drive all the way to Armstrong (Mattice Outfitters) and then fly out to get awesome walleye. Some of the best walleye fisheries in the province can be found 1 hr north of Atikokan in the Ignace area. Better yet you can drive to almost all of them. If I wanted to save money on a fishing trip, that would be my first option. Far cheaper than a fly-out from Atikokan and better fishing. The lakes in the Ignace area are the headwaters of the English River and are generally far more productive than the lakes in the Turtle River system."
1376963,shortmag,2011-12-28 17:12:00,70,Cabelas offers a Lowrance model 5X with a case and base and battery which I have been very pleased with during use as you mention. You will have to mess with it just a bit to get all the components installed but it's easy and well worth the price and effort.
1377106,jambi,2011-12-29 08:52:00,504,"I bought the Humminbird PirahnaMax 230 this year. Worked perfect, one set of AA batteries lasted all week. Good clarity on marking fish, suction cup stayed on just fine (but I did tie off like the others described). $200 well spent for sure!"
1378076,adempsey,2012-01-01 16:38:00,963,"Most important is to find out if your fly-in has electrical power to re-charge your 12V batteries or not. Although, I believe some people have used those folding solar cells for recharging but I have no experience with that. If it were me, I would get the smallest and cheapest unit that draws the least amount of power that I could find. All you need it for is to the find the water depth and possibly changes in bottom structure. I wouldn't expect to have to work that hard to find fish if I was on a fly-in.If you do go with a 12V battery, one tip I read is to just keep it (or them) in your pocket when you fly so it doesn't count toward your gear weight. I'd also pick up a 9+ Amp Hour battery to replace the 7 Amp Hour battery that would come with the unit.The suction cups SUCK! Do yourself a favor and just attach it to a piece of wood and bring a C-clamp to clamp it to the boat. Also, don't buy one of those portable metal transducer holders either (I have one), they are horrible and are NOT better than a simple piece of wood and C-clamp. If you don't want to do that, bring some petroleum jelly as that helps keep the suction cup attached.Also, if you can really get a unit that lasts all week on one set of batteries, I'd go with that. My portable (Humminbird 535) lasts about 8-10 hours on a single charge (12V 7Ah battery) - although, it should last much longer but I have yet to figure this out (the unit has a 200mA current draw)."
1374880,fishin4ever,2011-12-20 09:43:00,2,Looking for a depth finder to take along on a flyin trip to NW Ontario. Any one have suggestion?
1374893,Pooch,2011-12-20 10:09:00,4619,"Big important question, Do the boats at the fly-in camp have electric start with a decent sized battery? If so you can take about anything you want and get power from the boat battery.. If not and the motors are pull start then you are somewhat more limited as you'll need to supply your own battery power. Then a smaller flasher or LCD is in order. There are several battery pack units available from all the big outdoor sport stores. Most need a 110v recharge at night. If the fly-in has no electricity then you're gonna need batteries. GOOD new batteries, not used or Dollar store junk. Think Duracell Coppertops for starters.Search this site as this comes up every year and there are many good posts from past years that will be a big help.Have a great trip.Pooch"
1374902,CI_Guy,2011-12-20 10:24:00,2118,"I use an HDS5 mounted on a Genz Blue Box. If it is a lake that is mapped by Navionics or Lakemaster the the gps is a huge help in locating spots, also finding camp after a day of fishing. I bring a second Vex type battery along. You can get 1 day of fishing out of the battery but it takes more than 24 hours to totally recharge so you need to swap out batteries every night."
1374905,Larry Mac,2011-12-20 10:31:00,530,"Hi Fishin4ever, I agree with Pooch, you will find many, many opinions on this subject based upon the parameters at your camp. I use Humminbird 100SX and now the 345C. I am extremely happy with both and I utilize them on very remote fly ins.IMHO for sure ""Do not leave home without them"" LOL.Have a great Trip. Where are you going?Thank you,Larry Mac"
1374942,pike50plus,2011-12-20 12:29:00,584,"They weight maybe less than a 12 volt and work all week if new, can be used for a lantern at night too."
1374951,fishin4ever,2011-12-20 12:42:00,2,"We are going to a remote flyin, it is BYOB (bring your own batteries). The trip is with Canoe Canada-Bow Lake, a widening of the Turtle River. We had dreamed about going further north with Mattice Outfitters but some of the group needed to keep the costs down. Maybe in the future. Anyone have experience with Bow Lake and Canoe Canada?"
1374979,GOBIG,2011-12-20 13:31:00,126,"I use a hummingbird 140c. We have 2 of them in our group, works great, light weight, runs 4 long days on 6 aa batteries, and is never in the way."
1374987,Pikeslayer8,2011-12-20 13:51:00,1460,I used to use Eagle Fishmark 320 and thought it was good. Bought a Lowrance X-4 portable and used it twice this year. Don't really like it very much.Is there such a thing as portable (BYOB) unit with side scan?
1375034,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-12-20 16:14:00,235,"I used an Eagle Cuda 128 portable for many years on my fly-in trip and it worked fine. I accidentally broke it, and had to buy a new one for this past summer's trip. I bought a Humminbird 150 portable, and it works fine, but I don't like that it requires a 12v battery. I liked the AA's for the Eagle better, easier to stock up on them for a fly in where you can't charge the battery. With that said, I didn't have to charge my 12v once on this past 4 day trip, but I was meticulous about making sure that it was always turned off when not needed. Unless you require some type of mapping capability, I don't think you need to have the fanciest electronics on a fly-in lake in Canada. Just need to find the drop offs and the depth change areas and to have a general sense of the depth beneath you. Now, we mainly jig for walleyes, so maybe our needs are simpler."
1375036,TIGHTLINER,2011-12-20 16:19:00,223,Look at the hummingbird fishing buddy c140. Runs on 6 aa coppertop batteries for 4 days if you remember to turn it off when done. No wires in the boat everything is outside the boat. The unit itself will float but you need to tie the holding bracket on to the boat. Worked great twice last year in canada. Weight is under 8 lbs for a fly in it worked great. I stored in my duffle bag to protect it. Great unit i would recommend it to anyone looking for a fish finder.
