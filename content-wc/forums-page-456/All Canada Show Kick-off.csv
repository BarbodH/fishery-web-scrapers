1380048,Beagle_Nut,2012-01-07 07:42:00,52,"Went to the first night of the ""2012 tour"" of the All Canada show last night here in St. Charles MO, great fun visiting with old friends as usual. Booked our second trip with Bob & Peg to Whitefish Bay Camp at the end of September, what a beauiful area we can't wait to get back. Hi-light of the show for us was seeing a full body mount of the musk ox Norm McCreight took up next to the North Pole. Worth the $5 price of admission all by itself. (That's the half-price cost if you buy your tickets online before you go.)"
1380120,Glenman12,2012-01-07 11:21:00,762,what were the crowds like?
1380326,Beagle_Nut,2012-01-08 07:28:00,52,I've probably gone to the show for 5 years or so and the crowd was as big as any year I've seen. Might have something to do with people going on Friday night to avoid missing football on Saturday or Sunday. Or maybe we're all just sick of this springtime weather in January and wanted a chance to at least think about colder temps up north.
1380339,Larry Mac,2012-01-08 08:36:00,530,"Good Day Everyone, We have been going to The All Canada Show for many years. The All Canada Show is a annual event for us and a big adventure kickoff for our groups going North every year. We all really look forward to it. We even have a few out of towners travel up for the weekend as we all look forward in spending time with our outfitters as well as meeting and talking with new potential outfitters. The show is very unique as it is for ""Canadian Adventures"" only. It is unlike any other outdoor show as it is not a swap meet or boat show. If you are looking for a potential ""Canadian Adventure"" destination this show is a must. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
