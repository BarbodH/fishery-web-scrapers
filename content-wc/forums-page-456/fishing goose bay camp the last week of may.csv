Lac Seul is big, but there is plenty of islands to break up the wind. My suggestion would be to bring a handheld GPS capable of taking Navionics chips, if you don't have a standalone unit. My experience with Navionics and Lac Seul showed the chip to be pretty accurate."
1379123,WOLF123,2012-01-04 11:08:00,30,thank you for your help we do have gps and will mark cooridinates suggested bj andrea jim wolf and by others from this site jim wolf
1378250,BenBeattie,2012-01-02 08:04:00,232,"A lot of spots at that time of year we're getting fish in less then 10' of water. Every year is different though depending on conditions. If it's been warm(er) and you have a nice sunny afternoon, pitching jigs tight to shore in 1-5 FOW can be awesome."
1378346,wallydave,2012-01-02 10:56:00,2151,"I know there are some big pike in LS, but I my biggest pike is around 34in while jigging with an ultralight! My biggest walleyes near Ear Falls have been 30in and a pair of back-to-back 29.5in! Last June my big pike was 33, with a different ultralight, plus a chunking 24 in walleye. Some have posted that most of the big pike have been fished out on LS, but I like to think a few big ones will be swimming around thanks to the slot sizes."
1378509,WOLF123,2012-01-02 17:56:00,30,dave I hear so much about this place mckenzie bay as a great area but with a camp boat and motor is it just to dangerous if windy and rough water;are group wants to catch fish but safety comes first;could the trip be made in about and hour on a calm day with camp boats and motors;is the fishing that exceptional that it is worth going at least once on calm day or are spots you mentioned around camp just as good and a lot less work;my buddy and I are almost 70 both of us in good health but still not like we are 21 your thoughts and comments are appreciated jim wolf chicago boys
1378514,WOLF123,2012-01-02 18:07:00,30,"ben thanks for all your help we appreciate it would you attempt to go to mckenzie bay with camp boats and motors on a calm day I have heard so much about this place ( is it that much better than the places mentioned around camp) do you think its worth at least one day in a week on a calm day so we stay out of trouble close to 70 (good health) but safety first comments and thoughts appreciated jim wolf chicago boys I know lac seul is a large body of water and conditions can change quickly fished lake of woods a few times and had a few ""dicey"" situations have no interest in puttting myself in that position again thoughts and comments appreciated"
1378530,wallydave,2012-01-02 18:47:00,2151,"Ever since Andrea added the Lund outfitter boat for an upgrade option we have gone this route. These are real fishing boats, pedastal seats,flat bottoms, casting deck, plus they are 17ft, as opposed to the 16ft deepvee boats. Like I have mentioned I have never tried to trip to McKenzie, just too far to go, the Lac can be calm in the am, but when the day warms up and the winds pick up, it can get plenty rough in the afternoons. Fishing the NW section of LS can keep you plenty busy, trying the ""local spots"" that are not to far from camp. Having a good trip means you can ""live to tell the tail"" Fishing the North waters is plenty of adventure for me, when I was younger, the adventures brought some risks, now I just like to get away from civilization, relax and enjoy some time on the water with my fishing group and the natural beauty of Ontario!"
1378544,wallydave,2012-01-02 19:01:00,2151,Wolf check your PMs Eh!
1378558,Guest,2012-01-02 19:18:00,0,"Iron, Bannatyne, Celt, Cramp and Brownbear creeks are all in the NW sector and are close to Goose Bay. Any of the creeks are good locations to find spawn fish. Further down the lake Turkey and Altimeter creeks are as ""Hot"" as the Winnesaga river and are not closed to fishing. Depending when the spawn occurs will determine where the fish will be found could be primary or secondary points. Don't be afraid to head down the lake if the fishing isn't producing in the NW section. My BEST advice is to pay attention to the fishing reports from the opener and TALK to Andrea. If that won't do hire a guide for a day. $100-150 per day isn't to outrageous. Ask for Stan. Great gentleman and he will produce and show you how and where to fish. Might see you with a boat load of fish!"
1378623,Lonefisherman,2012-01-03 00:19:00,13,"If you upgrade to larger boat I would recommend going to McKenzie bay because it is well worth the trip. If you stay in your area do try Sawmill bay. You can try the area near Wenasaga river but the river itself is closed that time of year. I have never fished Lac Suel the end of May, but have been there in mid June many times. The spawn up there will usually determine where the fish are at that time of year, If this is your first trip to Lac Suel you are in for a treat. Good luck wherever you fish."
1378631,WOLF123,2012-01-03 04:52:00,30,lonefisherman thank you for all your help jim wolf

1377871,JDP,2012-01-01 07:50:00,1457,I did not know that Goose Bay Camp rented houseboats. Can you confirm that you are fishing out of the Ear Falls (west) side of Lac Seul. Thanks!
1377905,WOLF123,2012-01-01 09:06:00,30,we are not renting house boats using the boat and motor from camp have you fished it and can you answer any of the questions asked in the original post jim wolf chicago
1377977,wallydave,2012-01-01 11:26:00,2151,"I have been fishng out of GBC since the late 90's, Andrea will put you on the fish! She will sit down with you and map out the hot spots for that time of year. Mouth of the river, Lunker, SawMill will be productive that time of year.Each year you can see the improvements to the camp, docks and cabins. Customer service has also improved over the years! I recommend the boat upgrades, pink jigs for walleye, silver spoons and firetiger patterns for pike.Have a good trip, let us know how your trip goes."
1377985,WOLF123,2012-01-01 11:47:00,30,"walleye dave thank you for all the information will report back upon return and email you pictures if you want of the ""big ones"" jim wolf chicago boys"
1377988,WOLF123,2012-01-01 11:53:00,30,walleye dave approximately how much time to get to these spots using camp boats and normally what depth range for walleyes jim wolf chicago boys
1378030,wallydave,2012-01-01 14:26:00,2151,"Travel time has a few factors. The boat upgrade, will help with your time, bigger motors and nicer to fish out of. Wind and waves can slow you down too! Saw Mill is about a 15-20 min ride, the mouth of the river, and Lunker are 10-15 min. Some folks go to McKenzie Bay, that is about 45 min, never tried going that far, the fishing has been pretty good with the local spots. Depth can vary, that time of year, the shallow waters will warm up first, we like fishing the mouth of the river that time of year, so your bouncing jigs of the bottom, 12-15 FOW. Windy points where the water is cloudy, jigging the edge of the ""clouds"" can be productive too!"
1378117,WOLF123,2012-01-01 18:27:00,30,dave thanks for all the help we will try all the spots you recommend we would rather fish closer to lodge so this sounds perfect;we have had luck also fishing in cloudly water caused by wind blowing into a bay stirring up the sand causing the cloudiness are you planning on going this year and what week jim wolf the chicago boys looking to catch my biggest northern over 30 years my best is only 9 1/2# on the english river thanks again for all your help and keep in touch
1378134,bpetersen,2012-01-01 19:04:00,251,"Dave helped me my first time on Lac Seul. Just one more thing about the mouth of the river. You can only fish the mouth that time of the year. It is a fish sanctuary. Just jut look for signs on the banks and don't go up river any farther. I know minnows are used a great deal that time of the year but I have had very good success using a Lindy rig and crawlers. You need to move very sloooooooooow and go vertical as much as possible. If your going to jig, minnow is the way to go.Dave mentioned McKenzie Bay, great fishing, but a long old boat ride.Also, get a good map of the northwest section.I stay at the resort just south of Goose Bay."
1378233,wallydave,2012-01-02 07:11:00,2151,"Back in the good old days, we would always try to hit Goose Bay the end of May first week of June. One reason was back then June 1st was the ""opening"" day of going up river to the Rapids! And it was my boat/cabin buddies B-Day! As mentioned the mouth of the river will be as far as you can go up the Wenasaga River till mid June. By then most of the fish are out of the Sanctuary and out in the Lac. Late May will still be a good time of year, the weather can be ever changing, but its is like that through June."
