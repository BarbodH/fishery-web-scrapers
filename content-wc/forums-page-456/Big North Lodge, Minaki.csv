I am a musky fisherman, but this site always has the best info, plus we do a little bit of walleye fishing each year in Canada. If I could get some info on the lodge, the pressure on the lakes in this area, and the overall fishing, I would be grateful. thanks!"

On the lodge, the cabins and facilities are very nice but we received virtually no fishing advice from the owners and since it was our first trip to the area that was disappointing. We did get a guide for a day and that helped. I was surprised at how many boats we saw on the system considering the time of year, there were quite a few and not just near town. On fishing we only target Northerns and while my wife and I each boated a few individual nice fish during the trip (biggest were a 43"" and 2 40 inchers) overall the numbers were terrible. It was our first trip to the area and it's obviously very popluar with al lot of people out here, but for us it was a rough trip. If we went back we'd stay more at the northern end of the system, Big and Little Sand lakes were where we had the best luck. To get there from Big North that's about a 10 mile boat ride right through town, under the railroad bridge, past about a half dozen lodges and tons of houses."

But there was a group from Wisc. fishing Muskies and they had caught 14 that week and there was 4 of them. They said it was awesome Muskie Fishing. We did a Flyin with BNL also and had a great time there.
1382314,camp chef,2012-01-13 08:53:00,915,We have been to Big North 5 times and are going back this year in June. Great facilities and a very nice setting. There is more traffic on the water than I would prefer but the fishing can be great. We have never been north of the railroad bridge.It is a beautiful body of water.
1382468,briand,2012-01-13 15:12:00,48,"I can't help you with any lodge info, and I not even much of a musky fisherman.But we do have family that comes down for 1 or 2 weeks a year and fish them morning till dark.They prefer the northern part of the system say around rough rock narrows, rough rock and north getting close to the dam. My experience come's from walleye fishing and having them go after fish on the hook. I've seen it more times in big sand then fishing anywhere else in the system, and I don't fish big sand much.As for fishing pressure I don't think it's heavy.Given the number of lodges and cottage owners, it's very easy to find places to fish in spots all to yourself, and only see the odd passing boat.And if you don't want to travel far to Big Sand to fish, I believe your better off. That's where everybody else has headed off too As for walleye the fishing keeps getting better and better with the slot size in place. Many walleyes now in the 24"" - 27""Good luck with yourpick next summer"
