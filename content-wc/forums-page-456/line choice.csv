Would I be better off with mono, fluoro, braid, or braid with a leader of some type? I don't know what the water color is in that area, so I also need advice on line color and test weight. I hear that we will be trolling night crawlers with a Little Joe spinner. Any advice about line or other bait/lure choices would be appreciated."

1380191,new hips,2012-01-07 16:35:00,498,"In Canada, I use 4 or 6 lb Fireline for Walleye, it has much less water resistance. I assume you will using bottom bouncers with your spinners, to maintain proper angle (for less hangups) you can use 1oz to 1 1/2oz in 20-30 foot of water. A lot of times I use 4lb and a 1oz walking sinker lindy rig with 36in snell of fluorocarbon and just a plain walleye hook. Same setup with a floating jig head and crawler......start with a 6ft snell and keep shortening it until you start getting bites. For jigging walleye, I use a high viz crystal fireline with a 18in fluorocarbon leader tyed to the jig. High viz is to detect the light bites. Northern= 15 to 20lb Power Pro with a good Titanium leader or a fluorocarbon leader. Don't worry...my biggest Northern 39in I caught on 6lb Fireline while walleye fishing, so it's plenty strong."

Flouro makes great leader material, but in the end, I use straight mono on some set ups, straight braid on others. Go with what you like, but just be aware that braid can be a hassle, flouro can be a hassle, and mono (as much as it can be a hassle), is at least for me, the best there is. Braid can knot up and be a mess to fix. Flouro doesn't cast all that well (at least in my experience). Mono has stood the test of time and will be coming with me to Canada for most of my fishing applications once again. These are my experiences. I know lots of people that fish braid full time and never have an issue. If flouro was a castable as mono, I would probably load everything with that stuff."
