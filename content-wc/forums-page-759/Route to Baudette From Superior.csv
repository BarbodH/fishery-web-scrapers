We will be traveling up 53 to Superior and I just wondered about the best route. We are attempting this route for the first time, and are looking for any tips. We usually cross in International Falls. Thank you and good luck to everyone!"

Check out mapquest at mapquest.com. It gives a detailed set of directions for the above. Steve"
