548142,Guest,2005-05-19 20:52:00,0,Less than a month now we are heading into NW Ontario. We usually order leeches ahead of time and pick them up on the way in Ontario. Does anyone know what the going Canadian price per pound is this year?
548156,Guest,2005-05-20 09:37:00,0,$39 US from D&E in Ear Falls
548199,Guest,2005-05-21 14:19:00,0,Thanks for the price index - that sounds like much more than we have ever paid in the past. I wonder if we should reduce the lbs. of leeches we are fishing with and look at crawlers and maybe even minnows. At least the price of gas is also expensive - ouch! What about the price of minnows?
548200,Trailerguy,2005-05-21 15:38:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]D & E Minnows is 807-222-2496 they have it all.
548201,Hump,2005-05-21 17:22:00,578,Where is D&E in Ear Falls. is it better than smitty's and four Seasons? We will be at Evergreen on Lac Seul the last week of June. We are bringing crawlers and will use minnows. do we need leeches?
548209,2 DOGS,2005-05-21 21:04:00,361,You'll be about 75 yards from D & E but I think you'll find Evergreen can accomodate ALL your bait requirements. Something new is in the offing. You might give Gary or Patty a call and they can fill you in.
548210,Pooch,2005-05-21 21:05:00,4619,Why so high this year? Pooch
548215,Hammerhead Herb,2005-05-21 22:30:00,259,"Much Better. There folks live right next door to the 4 seasons and their place is about 2 - 3 miles down that road. We were told by our outfitter that we were to fly out about 3 hours earlier than we planned. We called up D7E and they delevired the minnows to us at the Trillium motel parking lot. Even charged us a price that was lower than the price they quoted over the phone. They run a good honest operation. Since they go and fly out for their own minnows, they will often have product whent he other stores won't."
548238,Guest,2005-05-22 20:18:00,0,"My guess is they expect the rule to go into effect prohibiting dealers from importing leeches. Same demand, less supply?"
