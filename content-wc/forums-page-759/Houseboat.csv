547476,Guest,2005-05-01 17:57:00,0,Looking to do a houseboat in 2006 for Lac Suel. Normally put in at Deception Bay and drive 45-60 minutes to our spots. Anyone ever rent a houseboat around this area. I thought I heard Hudson had a few options but I would like to hear some forst hand experience from this well respected board. Thanks

We are never far from the fish its great to not have to travel a long ways in the fishing boats once you are on the island with the houseboat. its ALMOST like roughing it if there is such a thing anymore.

It's a nice family-run business and they have always been great to our group. There is also another business next door that I am not familiar with, however the boats do not look as nice as Sioux Lookout's. I highly recommend Sioux Lookout. See their web-site. If you call, talk to Steve. He is the owners son. His father's name escapes me, but he's a nice guy also."
