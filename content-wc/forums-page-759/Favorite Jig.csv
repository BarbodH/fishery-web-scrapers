547349,PigBoy,2005-04-27 07:25:00,120,Al Paterson's Reel Bait flasher jigs are my favorites. Get 'em at reelbait.com. Al also has some of the best spinners on the market. He gets most of my business.

In my experience orange, black and white work the best for the Wally's. At one time I did use pink and chartreuse, but I found that small pike were attracted to those colors, so I stopped using them as it gets tiresome unhooking and releasing those all #### day. Good Luck"
