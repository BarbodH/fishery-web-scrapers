I would definitely recommend Lac Suel Lodge. Dan is easy to work with and takes good care of his customers. All the equipment is in great shape..(though I have brought it back in need of a prop or skag a time or ten) I stay at black bay outpost. Outposts aren't for everyone but he also has 8 or 10 cabins at the lodge. I have a friend that stayed there several years and really liked it. Good Luck"
548125,Guest,2005-05-19 14:01:00,0,"Does his Black Bay outpost have indoor toilets? Or is it outhouse time? I have seen their outpost in Sunlight Lake, and it is looks great, but only holds four."
548137,Guest,2005-05-19 17:46:00,0,"Thanks for the replies everyone, to clarify a couple of things, I would like to keep the costs under $500.00 per person, and I have a 16ft Alumacraft Lunker with a 40hp Suzuki. I've looked at Witch Bay on Lake of the Woods and even though it's HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, $800.00+ per person is too steep for a couple in our group. Our their better times of the season to fish? Or is the fishing good(depending on the weather)all summer long? Again, thanks for the help and good luck to all!!"
548178,IA  DAN,2005-05-20 18:28:00,53,"Bor, to answer your question Black Bay sleeps upto 9 and the bathroom is outside.It does have a shower,2 refrigerators,stove and a freezer.Dan keeps the place up real nice the only problem is theres a waiting list for this cabin. PAPA,we go to Lac Seul 1st week of August and the fishing is great.Its a stained lake so it can be sunny and hot out and you can still catch walleyes.Its a big lake with alot of Islands,fish the windy side of them and you wont be dissapointed.We stay at BlackBay Outpost ran by Lac Seul Lodge. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
548214,DIRTBALL2,2005-05-21 22:10:00,39,I would second the motion for Lost Island Lodge. Shane and Chris Hayes are two of the finest people in the resort business that I have had the good fortune to meet. :cheers: DIRTBALL2
548282,NateW,2005-05-24 12:11:00,96,"IA Dan, we'll be there the week before you get there--which is pretty late for us. Mind if I pick your brain a little? E-mail me if you get a chance. Thanks! --Nate"
548002,Guest,2005-05-16 19:38:00,0,"I'm interested in some of the better resorts that are reasonably priced for someone on a fixed income. The resort doesn't have to be the Taj Mahal, and we can cook for ourselves, just want to enjoy what sounds like good fishing, on a top notch lake (Lac Seul) in a clean, well run resort. Thanks to all for the help!!"
548006,Guest,2005-05-16 20:11:00,0,"From what I've seen, all the resorts on Lac Seul get a premium for the world class fishing Lac Seul provides. I've been there once and it costed about 50% more than the place we go to usually (I forget the cost for the lodge--Fisherman's Cove). I will be going there to fish for a day as my cousin will be there the same week. I will be putting in at the public landing near them."
548024,Guest,2005-05-17 10:06:00,0,I can't speak for all the resorts on LS but I will mention something about the ones I know something about. Fishermans Cove and Evergreen lodge are both very nice and comfortable places. Both are focused on customer service and enjoyment of the customer. The problem is that both are probably booked full for this year. It is still worth a call. Good luck and enjoy. grumpy
548025,Guest,2005-05-17 10:14:00,0,Evergreen give a discounted rate if you bring your on boat. Fishermans Cove doe not. I have been to Evergreen numerous times and have always enjoyed Gary and Pat. Real nice folks. Most of the cabins are new. I think they are getting new boats and motors this year.
548035,skrut,2005-05-17 12:56:00,52,"I can't disagree with any of the previous posts, but you might want to give Gold Pines consideration. The problem with Lac Seul is that all of these camps and lodges have a high guest return ratio and many times it is difficult to get a week in unless they have a cancellation."
548037,Guest,2005-05-17 13:42:00,0,"Fisherman's Cove does have a discount for ""Own Boat"". IMHO: Fisherman's Cove, Lac Seul Lodge and Evergreen with Onaway as honorable mention provide the best value."
548050,IA  DAN,2005-05-17 18:46:00,53,"Not sure what you consider resonably priced? Theres alot of nice places to stay on Lac Seul that are between $500.00 -$600.00 it just depends on your needs,do you need to rent a boat thats extra.I've only stayed at Lac Seul Lodge but listening to alot of the other guys there seems to be quite afew nice places to stay.What I think is funny is if they don't catch alot of fish they think its the Lodges fault. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
548051,Guest,2005-05-17 19:55:00,0,I would reccommend Lost Island Lodge. You can do housekeeping or American plan. You can bring your own boat or rent and they also have guides available and are out of Hudson. That part of Lac Seul seems to be the best location to fish out of. There website is www.lostislandlodge.com I don't think you'll be disapointed.
548068,Guest,2005-05-18 07:22:00,0,My error when I called them several years ago to ask about accomodations and a discount for bring your own boat they advise me not to come there if I wanted a discount for bringing my own boat. They must have change d their pricing. I was not impressed with themn when I talked to them on the phone. They seemed like they could care less if we booked with them or not. I guess they are so busy they don't care.
548070,Guest,2005-05-18 08:03:00,0,I hope you are right Super 17 as we are going to Lost Island Lodge in 10 days. Really looking forward to it.
