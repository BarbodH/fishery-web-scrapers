547231,Guest,2005-04-24 11:31:00,0,What type of line do you guys use for jigging? I am thinking of switching to Fireline or Power Pro for throwing 1/8-1/4oz jigs for walleyes

You simply can't break them off and end up cutting the line, leaving 5-30' or more line in the water for someone else to snag or cause problems with boat props and possibly even the habitat. When in doubt, use mono. Last year in Canada I pulled up (luckily) a couple globs of Fireline someone else left for me."
547253,Guest,2005-04-25 08:31:00,0,Started tying on Power Pro three years ago and I love it for jig fishing. I use 10 lb test. Also works great for bottom bouncing and dragging cranks.
547265,Guest,2005-04-25 11:57:00,0,You can use Fire Line or Power pro (I prefer PP) and tie at least a six ft. piece of mono or Floro carbon leader to the braid. I use a double uni knot. That way you can pull it loose if need be. Make sure to keep drag looser than with mono as braids do not strech. Good Fishing....Kevin
547272,Jig A Lowe,2005-04-25 13:46:00,87,"I only fish for walleye and I jig probably 90-95% of the time. I tried the braided line many yrs. ago mainly to increase casting distance when using lighter jigs and for better sensitivity on lighter bites. I gave up on the braided line after one season. First, I did have a lot of break offs and unlike mono, the line rarely broke at the knot so I lost a lot line. More importanly, the braided line was too susceptible to wind. Even with a relatively light breeze, I would have such a bow in my line that it was nearly impossible to detect bites. And, if there was any respectable wind at all, it was just impossible to jig. Just my experience."

I LOVE FIRE LINE IT IS SO SENSITIVE & STRONG. THE BEST PLACE TO BUY IT IS IN THE OUTLET STORE AT SPENCER,IOWA ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE BERKLY FACTORY."

547323,Guest,2005-04-26 14:13:00,0,"I personally prefer fireline for jigging. Much better feel, never have line twist, a quick set of the hook with only your wrists will usually suffice. Just an all around great product. Agate"
547325,Guest,2005-04-26 15:26:00,0,"You should try rip-cord its a braided line and stronger than fire line ever thought about being, got snagged with a diver and and it broke of both the hooks. It is a real good line and Ive not had to replace it after two years of fishing and everthing else I have always used you have to replace after the season. Just my 2 cents"
