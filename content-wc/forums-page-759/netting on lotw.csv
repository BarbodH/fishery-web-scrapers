Native peoples will no longer tolerate and stand back while Americans and some Canadians attack the Indian people, desecrate Indian property and sacred sites, burn native boats, destroy fishing nets, traps and threaten more violence. Remember, the native people's right to fish is supported by the 1760 treaty, the Supreme Court of Canada and the Constitution of Canada. You cannot condone violent mobs to deter people from exercising their legal rights."
547808,Guest,2005-05-11 19:01:00,0,"Who is threatening violence? All we ask is that you practice sustainable harvest. Why is it that you think your rights gives you the justification to destroy a fishery? Read the Liberal appointed Supreme Court's decision you like to quote, conservation supercedes your so called rights. Time you started to realize that this is the 21st century, and stop thinking it is still 1760."
547809,Guest,2005-05-11 19:12:00,0,"Indian, I guess Canadians should just sit back quietly and let this happen to LOTW? This press release comes within days of the discovery of abandoned gill nets in the lake: The Lake Nipissing Stewardship Council (LNSC) was swift to react to this week's announcement of the discovery of two gill nets, each over 900 feet in length, by the Ministry of Natural Resources. The nets have been in the lake since last fall  their grisly catch over 1,100 lbs. Included in the rotting remains was a sturgeon weighing over 100 lbs. (estimated to be in excess of 80 years old) and three muskies, each weighing over 40 lbs. Gary Preston, LNSC's Chair said the Stewardship Council is outraged by the blatant disregard for basic conservation principles. There is no excuse for unmarked nets, or nets being set so late in the season that there is a risk that they cannot be retrieved. Abandoned nets will keep fishing for years. They don't discriminate between species, size or time of year. said Preston. New nets recently retrieved from walleye spawning areas also indicate a disregard to sustaining this important resource. Nipissing First Nation asked to be heard at the Stewardship Council Annual Meeting just three weeks ago on April 13, 2005 and made a commitment to a gill net moratorium during the walleye spawn and stated they would ensure compliance and enforcement. This has obviously not happened. Preston blames both the Ministry of Natural Resources and Nipissing First Nation. Since 1999, when the Stewardship Council was initially formed, our partners and stakeholders have complained about excessive gill netting with an apparent wanton disregard for this precious resource and several discoveries of fish left to spoil. Abuse of First Nation rights to fish on Lake Nipissing was the number one issue raised during public consultation for the new Lake Nipissing Fisheries Management Plan last year. We've been patient. We've listened to both sides and have been gracious. We've taken abuse from our member groups because of our lack of action. We've kept our noses out of discussions between Nipissing First Nation and the MNR  for years and years. Enough is enough. These two parties will just continue to talk and promise and threaten until there are no fish left in Lake Nipissing. The Stewardship Council wants action now. We want a commitment from the MNR and Nipissing First Nation that this travesty will be dealt with quickly and effectively. We want the MNR to do its job  protect Ontario's resources. The MNR has the tools. They just need the will. Are charges going to be laid for allowing the waste of such a large number of fish? The Stewardship Council wants Nipissing First Nation to follow through with promises and talk of how committed they are to ensuring the fishery is sustainable. Nipissing First Nation has made commitments to the Stewardship Council that have not been followed through on. Nipissing First Nation has two seats on the multi-stakeholder group. The LNSC's credibility is now compromised by our trust to see these proposed positive initiatives come to fruition. In order to effectively manage this fishery, we must have regular, timely and complete reporting of native catches  this is no threat to First Nation rights. If Nipissing First Nation cannot get 100% compliance from their community, maybe banning gill nets on Lake Nipissing is the answer. While we can appreciate the positive step of hiring a First Nations Conservation Officer, a two-year internship is not the answer. This needs to be a permanent, full-time position, funded by the MNR for there to be any chance of continuity of enforcement and compliance measures for the fishery to survive given the current ongoing situation. In closing, the LNSC believes this isn't just an issue for people that fish. Every community, native and non-native that lives around Lake Nipissing owes its economic viability to the lake. It generates over $100 million to the area annually. Destruction of the fishery threatens this. Sure, there's a beautiful sunset, but how long will people continue to holiday at a lake with no fish in it?"
547832,Guest,2005-05-12 07:45:00,0,Who cares I don't fish LOTW so go ahead and net all you want. Kill all the fish don't worry someone in the govenrment will come bail you out when the fish are gone
547838,Guest,2005-05-12 09:14:00,0,"Concerned, Thanks for the post. I fished Nipissing thru-out the 80s and 90s and it was a great walleye lake until the netting got out of hand. It's good to see a local group take the initiative against overnetting and wastefulness. Hopefully, the community around LOTW will follow their lead."
547841,Guest,2005-05-12 11:44:00,0,And this guy needs help to figure out why????http://www.baytoday.ca/content/news/details.asp?c=7893
548263,Guest,2005-05-23 22:30:00,0,"That was probably said about the Grand Banks too. Now look. Hey. Put it this way. As a former guide on this body of water, I know that overfishing ONE area can harm it. Take for instance Shoal Lake. Once an excellent Walleye area. It was commercially fished. It has also be closed to walleye fishing for over 15 years. according to the MNR it is slowly coming back. Like 15years ago.?? it takes longer than one thinks to get a lake back to normal, and NO TME at all to screw it up. A few years of netting on any lake no matter where it is will do damage to it sooner or later. If this contiues, it is only a matter of time. Best to take care of the situation NOW, before it is too late. However it is up to those in the tourism business and those that use the lake to take the action to do whatever they can. I am retired. I seldom fish, so personally I careless anymore. IF I still guided, I would be on the front page of the local paper on this matter. But as I see it. let the lake go to pot Don't cry when it happens either. Ron Kenora"
548264,Guest,2005-05-23 22:34:00,0,"YOUR FISH.. Geesh. 1/2 you folks are on Government assistance. 1/2 will not or won't work. I say, buy you off completely. Settle the Treaty 3 at any cost. One million per person. Shut down the reservations which are money gobblers anyway, and the only ones getting rich on them are your own chief's. ####, giving you each one million would make one mad spending spree and when you blow it all, go to work like everyone else. Oh forgot. After that you have to pay taxes, just like everyone else, and NO more handouts. I get a kick out of it when I hear about Native self government. You could not run a one car funeral."
548265,fishstalker,2005-05-23 23:06:00,54,"Indian, your ancestors would cry if they could hear you talk. Native peoples are supposed to be the guardians and caretakers of the earth. You, however, are condoning the wanton destruction of the gifts of the earth mother just to spite the white man. This is a shame, and for this, your ancestors will turn their backs on you and your kind."
547653,bromes,2005-05-06 15:35:00,3,"Indian, just curious, but would like to know why you say that the fish and the land are yours....Im sort of confused by your comments. Could you explain your point of view so that I and possibly others on this forum maybe get a better understanding of your point of view or rational for thinking this way....."
547662,Guest,2005-05-06 20:32:00,0,"I would have to think that he blames the white man for all their troubles. I have to wonder if maybe there wernt people here before this specific group of indians took over and maybe just maybe someone has a claim on these things before the present group of made theirs? but those poor natives were probably completely wiped out, sort of poetic justice."
547665,PJM,2005-05-06 23:19:00,3516,"Indian I don't know if this post was put on here to get our attention or if you are really Native American, but nobody can change the past. When they netted all the fish out of Red lake, even some of the tribal members said they made a big mistake. I understand it is you right to do it, what I don't understand is at one time the state of Minnesota offered to pay more money not to net then the fish were worth. The question is that if in Canada they offered more money not to net, would you do it or is it tradition. The next question is, when the fish are gone, then what will you do? I was on Lake of the Woods last year and there were some Native American fishing for crappies with rod & reels and selling them. Using rod & reel makes it a ""level playing field"" and these guys were guides at some of the resorts on the lake and I was impressed."
547669,Mahumba,2005-05-07 07:08:00,345,"I usually don't get into these posts but here goes: Indian, You stated the land and fish was yours. Well here's a little sumpin' for ya. When the prospect came up to the first nations of the white man ""owning a piece of land"" and willing to trade goods for it the natives laughed. How can you own land? The land is for everyone. You cannot own it. The natives accepted the ""trade"" Whiteman enforced the ownership. So stating the Land belongs to a singular entity, either you or I, is not correct. Also if we get into the circle of life....naw......Cain't do it. Roger Mayer"
547701,Guest,2005-05-09 10:35:00,0,"I've been fishing LOW much longer than most of you have been around. I hope you'll be fishing it a long time after i'm gone, I really mean that!! I live on the lake, to me it is home. I concider the Indian population my friends and know alot of the People well. Just like in the States, people break laws, it is very tough to enforce most of the netting laws. Indians have a right to net, indeed, i think they should. However, Indian netters do not have the right to break Canadian law. It is a Canadian problem that effects alot of US vacationers. None the less, we must stay out of it. They have dealt with these types of problems before, they will now too. BTW....For those of you who only get to LOW for a 1 or 2 week vacation. The lake cycles, last yr fish were running on the small side, we still caught big fish, just not as many as say, the yr before. 2-3 yrs from now we'll be catching large fish again (and releasing them). My advice. Relax, enjoy the lake, enjoy the people your with, ........... the lake will be here for yrs to come."

547715,cbprov,2005-05-09 13:29:00,1010,"just before ice out at Devils Gap lake of the woods one native in front of his house was cathing huge walleye, 15lb pike and a muskie a 42 incher all were thown on the ice exept the walleye what a site and waste within a day all were gone or picked clean by the birds and eagles ,is there not a limit on the size of mesh they use ?"
547716,Guest,2005-05-09 14:18:00,0,What me worry?
547725,Guest,2005-05-09 18:51:00,0,"Are you nuts?!? The Indians are netting right now all over the lake during the spawn! Oh ya, it'll all be fine, don't worry. Get your head out of the sand!"
547734,Guest,2005-05-10 07:29:00,0,What should we do?
547614,esgrams,2005-05-05 19:26:00,92,"Just curious to see how the meeting went on the netting in the LOTW, I was under the impression there was going to be one between the elders of the nation and the powers that be..I was following the previous thread that was very informative to say the least..My family has been fishing the Nestor Falls area since 69' and have heard many opinions, both good and bad concerning the issue..It always depended upon who was talking to whom, be it tourist, resort owner, guide, or long time resident of which I am considered a tourist. So in my eyes I have a little less of a vote concerning the outcome, even though it's my dollars that drive the local economy. Anyway 30 short days before I am again relaxing in beautiful Sabaskong Bay and I'm going to be enjoying every minute of your wonderful resource.."
547618,Guest,2005-05-06 04:45:00,0,"Not sure how the meeting went, but Wednesday, nets were spotted out in a spawning area, so I would say nothing was accomplished. I'm guessing the fact that they are netting during the spawn, the goal is to do as much damage as they can, as quickly as possible, or it's just plain stupidity."
547631,snaggletooth,2005-05-06 08:47:00,135,"I too am like esgrams, just a tourist who loves to visit LOTW every year. I have been thinking about this issue in the weeks since Mr. Pyzer first ""blew the whistle"" on this situation. There are lots of people up there with float planes. People in the sport fishing business. If this netting situation is REALLY as bad as certain people want us to believe it is, I think some of the folks with planes could fly over the lake and photograph the netting. If they are really taking enough fish to damage the lake in one season, I believe it would be quite obvious to someone flying around the lake. The photographs could be used as proof to convince the people in power that a problem really is occurring there."
547635,Guest,2005-05-06 10:17:00,0,I agree I doubt commercial netting will have any effect on LOTW or any other lake. I would ignore it.
547636,Guest,2005-05-06 10:23:00,0,Yep...just ignore it and it will go away...along with the fishery.
547644,Guest,2005-05-06 12:13:00,0,"Uh, not an effect??? Does anyone need a reminder of how bad the fishing was on LOTW in the 70's prompting the buyout of commercial licences to restore it? Does anyone need to be reminded that the Shoal Lake portion of Lake of the Woods is still closed after 25 years, due to the destruction caused by commercial fishing?"
547645,Guest,2005-05-06 12:14:00,0,"You people think you have rights to OUR fish and try convince the Indian that he should be patient, that these things take time. Enough of the lies, this is our land and our fish! WE WILL net as much as we want and if you white man don't like it you can stay home!"
547646,Guest,2005-05-06 12:19:00,0,"You gave up your rights to the fish and land when the Canadian government came in and rolled right over you....LOL, sorry, no hook line and sinker here."
547647,Guest,2005-05-06 12:22:00,0,"I was born here, so they're MY fish too. Maybe if you got over the fact that they are YOUR's we'd get somewhere. They are OUR's and need to be managed as such."
547651,esgrams,2005-05-06 14:29:00,92,"Here's a question to ponder,,If netting is supposed to be a subsistence type of sport per the treaty that was signed whenever and by whoever let it be that,,So when you lay out your nets what would be so hard to actually tag your net with a metal plate that has embossed upon it your name, address and phone number and before you place it let the tribal elders know where it is placed, when and where and when you plan to remove it..For that matter it can all be stamped on the tag therefore eliminating all nets that are left to rot, because that individual will no longer be allowed to net..All it takes in my view point is alittle self regulation..Just my two cents"
