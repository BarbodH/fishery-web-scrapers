548298,Guest,2005-05-24 16:10:00,0,don't waste your time with the largemouth. Spend more time fishing for the great Lac Seul catfish and bluegills. Give us an update when you get back
548307,Guest,2005-05-24 20:51:00,0,Personally suggest Uncle Larry's garlic carp stink bait. Those stumps suckers up there absolutly go bonkers over the stuff. 150-200 per day is VERY common. Use a catfish treble with a 1oz pencil weight rigged on a 3way troll @ max boat speed. HANG ON cuz they really fight hard!! Good luck...
