Every airplane can stall no matter how much horsepower it has. Most all crashes are due to pilot error and this is another. It is a tragic deal, but there are always accidents that can happen and do."
548252,Guest,2005-05-23 13:02:00,0,Hi. normally it takes a year before anything official comes out on plane crashes so I have to assume this is just guessing. Yea sure always blame the pilot.
548256,Guest,2005-05-23 15:00:00,0,No...there has been an official conclusion to the investigation.
547633,clemento,2005-05-06 09:10:00,48,Did they ever determine a cause of last springs accident? Just Curious.
547634,IaDave,2005-05-06 10:08:00,476,Which one?
547639,clemento,2005-05-06 10:40:00,48,I only heard about one. I read about it on this forum. I know it was very early in the season.
547648,Guest,2005-05-06 12:31:00,0,"If your referring to the Fawcett Lake crash by the float plane that was flying out of Sioux Lookout, the cause of the crash was Pilot error. They believe that the pilot allowed the plane's speed to decrease too much upon approach and it stalled, because of the altitude restart and recovery wasn't possible. The plane was found in tact under water with all passengers aboard. Sad."
547659,Wisconeye,2005-05-06 19:53:00,79,"I had heard that the pilot stalled it on approach as well. I'm not sure what the stall speed would be on the ever popular DeHavillands (Beaver and Otter) but the pilots I've flown with never get close. In fact, I always think we've got a LOT of airspeed on approach, but they finish it up nicely with a quick flare. Doesn't seem like something an experienced pilot would let happen. BTW- stalling an airplane doesn't mean the engine stops. But the plane essentially quits flying, not enough airspeed reduces lift and the plane falls. Fixing it requires power and pointing the nose down to pick up speed and resume flying. A low altitude stall is often uncorrectable. Temperature, plane loading (both how and how much) also make a big difference. A bunch mechanical stuff can cause this too, but it seems like the pilot almost always get the blame. I have to say, after being on many fly-in's I always admire the skill of the pilots in Canada. It takes a lot of knowledge and experience in an environment that isn't always friendly. I've piloted a lot of hours, never in a float plane though, and I always learn something when I fly with those guys- many seem too young to be that good."
547672,2746,2005-05-07 07:28:00,3206,"I too have been impressed with the quality of pilots I've been with in Canada over the years. I don't know the number of take offs and landings that occur every season in Ontario alone but it muast be in the tens of thousands and yet the number of mishaps are very small. Really pretty amazing, considering the conditions they fly in......and your right, they all look like kids!"
547710,Guest,2005-05-09 12:38:00,0,"Hi, Beaver pilots don't get close to stall speed because of what happens when a Beaver stalls. First thing they do is flip over on their backs. Good pilots will take a new plane up and stall it to see what happens - part of getting to know the airplane. Recovering from a stall usually means trading altitude for airspeed to get enough air moving under the wings to provide lift. If you don't have the altitude to trade... In some cases, you can actually stall out at low speeds just from local conditions. A gust of swirling wind can spill the air out from under your wings, and you stall. Easy to do with low speed 2-seater planes like PA-12s that fly at 35mph... Some planes, like Helio Couriers (wonderful planes but not very common - only 400 or so were built, and a lot of them went to Vietnam and never came back), are zero-stall aircraft - they have slats on the wings that drop out at low speeds so the plane really never stalls out because the slats increase the wing surface and get lift at lower speeds. Others, like Beavers, react pretty drastically when they stall. Pilots I know that have stalled Beavers say it's a pretty hair-raising experience..."
548165,Guest,2005-05-20 12:49:00,0,"This stall was due to the fact the pilot came in with full flaps (not required), his altitude drop to that of a normal approach path and when the stall occured there was not enough air left to correct."
548182,Skylane,2005-05-20 20:06:00,101,Was it a glassy surface and he had a problem guageing how high he was?
548218,Wisconeye,2005-05-22 08:31:00,79,"I guess this is what surprises me, as I said earlier all of the pilots I've flown with in Canada don't demonstrate these types of mistakes. Even with full flaps, the 475 horsepower available should allow airspeed to be maintained. The weather precluded it being a density altitude problem. The only item that has ever caused me to raise my eyebrows with the Beaver and pilots is the weight. It seems to me, given the gross weight charts I've seen for the Beaver that we are often over gross. While that in itself is not a problem with good loading it certainly changes the stall characteristics. Full flaps should have lowered his stall speed giving him even more room, but granted if he got there, recovery would be impossible on approach. I practice stalls in different configurations all the time, just to stay mentally prepared, but I do it above 1500 (as required by law of course). I don't know if the Beaver is considered inherently stable or not, but they sure are an excellent craft. In any event, it is tragic, but the study and discussion of this accident will allow all pilots to improve and think about our responsibilities."
