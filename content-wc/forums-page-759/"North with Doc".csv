548223,Pooch,2005-05-22 14:00:00,4619,Does anyone else read and enjoy this column every month as much as I do? Makes me sometimes wish I had kept a journal over the years. Then again maybe not... Pooch
548226,pnnylfr,2005-05-22 16:11:00,114,Look forward to those articles every month. Just started our journal last year and will dedicate room for reflections of past trips. Thankfully I always took pictures.

One journal for funny work occurances, and one journal for things that happen after hours, and on vacations. I did not take his advise and did not start a journal. When the guys get together we always bring up funny stories from years ago things that I had long forgotten. How I wish I had started that journal."
