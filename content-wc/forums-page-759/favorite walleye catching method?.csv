546833,BigThunder,2005-04-06 12:06:00,17,What is everyones favorite way to catch eyes?
546839,Guest,2005-04-06 13:25:00,0,"Day 1 of the trip, when I am rested and feeling great, I like to work jig and minnow. Day 6 of the trip, when I am tired and hung over, I like to throw out a slip bobber or two, sit back and relax."
546842,Guest,2005-04-06 14:37:00,0,With a fork!

547281,Guest,2005-04-25 19:43:00,0,crankbaits do it for me:) .

547352,Guest,2005-04-27 07:36:00,0,"My favorite way is whatever is most effective at a given time. I know that doesn't really answer your question, so here it goes. First, would be casting crankbaits, but that isn't always the most productive. Second would be casting and working jigs. Third would be the traditional type of jigging. Fourth would be a tie between bottom bouncing and trolling crankbaits. Next time you are bottom bouncing with a worm harness and are getting pestered by perch, try putting on a small floating rap instead of the worm harness. Cuts down on the mess with the worms, eliminates a lot of the perch problems, and seems to catch just as many eyes."
