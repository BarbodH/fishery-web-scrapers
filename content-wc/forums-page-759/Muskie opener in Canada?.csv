548232,rebelrn2001,2005-05-22 18:55:00,1563,Thanks Trailerguy. I will leave my 'big' rod home. Every year I bring it and throw a couple bigger lures for big pike BUT a MNR might misinterpret what I am fishing for. There are large muskie where we fish. I'll just use my MH pike rod w/30# test Fireline that I typically use for pike along w/the 'eye rods. That rod has a baitcaster reel and I don't particularly like heaving that thing anyway.
