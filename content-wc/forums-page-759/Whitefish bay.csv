548271,boomersooner,2005-05-24 07:33:00,3,I am heading to Witefish bay the week of June 5-11. My brother is coming from Oklahoma. He is mainly a Bass fisherman. I would like to get him into some Walleye and Northern. If anyone has any good tips or spots to fish on this lake it would be greatly apperciated. Thanks. P.S. I will post the results when we return.
