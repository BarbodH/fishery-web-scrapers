526676,Guest,2003-01-20 11:41:00,0,"We had some luck last year on small crankbaits (minnow / shad color) and topwater (shad color chug bugs). Didn't fish for the smallies much as we primarily focused on wallies. Best of luck, we'll be there the first week of June."
526677,Guest,2003-01-20 12:09:00,0,It is best to spend your time fishing for Walleye and Northern. The Snmallmouth bite is just not as good as the former 2. On a more positive slant this is the best Walleye and Northern Drive-In Lake I have ever fished and I have been fishing for almost 50 years.Have a great time!!!
526678,Guest,2003-01-21 10:14:00,0,"In my experience on Lac Seul, the early-middle part of June has often been the best smallmouth fishing of the entire summer. By the start of July, the smallmouth have started to spwawn and then go deep. At that point, you should definately be spending your time walleye or pike fishing. Smallmouth in June are usually found in 5-15 feet of water, off rock drop-offs. Look for small rock piles just above the surface or reefs just below, with large gravel, cobble, or rocky bottom. Start with small cranks (e.g. small shad rap). If they are not aggressive, then go to small spinners (#2 or #3 blade; green or yellow skirt usually work well), and try pitching jigs (1/4 oz. pink head with a white tail has always worked well for me, but others have worked as well). Pitch to the shallow and work the jig back through the deeper water. At that time of year the smallmouth are often schooled, so if you get one, throw behind it and you'll probably find a second one. I have pulled up to eight smallmouth off of one spot-on-spot. Jay"
