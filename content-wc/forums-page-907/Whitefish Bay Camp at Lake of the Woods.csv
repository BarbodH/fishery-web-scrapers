Accomodations are old cottages. Like $95/ day/ person and we supplied our own boat and motor. Had an indian guide the 1st day to find us walleyes. Went 15 miles by boat. Got our limit of 12-15"" and I ate 3 for lunch--so small.In the process we had to portage the boat over a lift to another arm of the lake and the trasducer was ripped off and speed indicator damaged. Nothing around the resort. When we brought in a few nice trout from up-lake about 7 miles by ourselves the owners(same ones there now) asked to borrow the fish and away they went in their boat. Came back later after they used our fish to photograph ""their catching!""at their camp."

526762,Guest,2003-01-23 08:01:00,0,"Whitefish bay camp is an older resort, the cabins are rustic. IF your going with a bunch of guys to just fish it is a good location. White Fish Bay has a little bit of every thing to offer. It can be a difficult body of water to fish for walleyes depending on what itme of the year you will be there. My experiance has been the latter in the summer you go the better the walleye fishing is. Most people run to yellow girl bay to cath walleyes, that would be about a 20 mile boat ride from White fish bay camp. Most of the walleyes that come out of white fish are over 19"" long. In my opinion White fish bay is the most senic part of Lake of the Woods its a place that takes more than 1 trip to learn and appriciate. I have fished many places in Canada but most of my trip the last few years have been to White Fish Bay. We stay at the Rod and Reel Resort in Souix Narrows. It offers more than adequate accommedations for the price. Good Luck"

The spring walleye fishing is excellent and the accommodations are very reasonable. We have a group of 14 fisherman that are Making the trip from northern Michigan to Minnesota for our yearly outing."
526764,Guest,2003-01-23 12:00:00,0,Zippel Bay and Whitefish Bay are not comparable. Zippel is big water and Whitefish is sheltered island water. Different techniques and experiences.
