526709,Mike KS,2003-01-20 12:22:00,18,Would love to hear what the experts on WC think is the best line for jigging for Walleye and why !!
526710,Jigger1,2003-01-20 14:51:00,234,"I second this request. After upgrading my jigging rod, I found Fireline to be something like sensory overload. Upon switching back to mono, my hook rate went back up."
526711,Guest,2003-01-20 19:39:00,0,"My guess is that you will get as many different answers as there are fishermen.I personally prefer Stren 6lb. for normal fishing or 8lb. if it's known big fish water. With a good rod I know exactly whats on the bottom and when I get a ""pick up"". I tried Fireline but found it too unforgiving, as in the fish would shake free. I know you need to get a softer tip for the Fireline etc. etc. Give me some fresh spooled mono and I can feel it all."
526712,Guest,2003-01-20 19:41:00,0,"Mike,I live a little South of KC. A recent transplant from the north. What part of KS do you fish."
526713,BD,2003-01-21 01:45:00,739,My favorite is Maxima Chameleon mono in 6lb. test. You can find it in Cabela's Spring and Tackle catalogs.
526714,Guest,2003-01-21 20:27:00,0,"I like to use 6# Fireline when jigging. I use a medium-light rod with the drag set fairly loose. Strikes are jarring, to say the least (even from little perch). And I rarely lose a fish. I still use mono for trolling or bobber fishing, but for casting a jig or just vertical jigging, give me Fireline every time."
526715,Mike KS,2003-01-22 09:08:00,18,"I love Fireline...But you need to use the Polymer Knot....at least I do with my old eyes and fingers. Hook sets are great and they are solid. I use a lift or sweep set and a medium drag on a reel with a fighting drag. The fighting drag allows me to make quick and accurate drag adjustments.Good Luck, Mike"
526716,Guest,2003-01-22 13:21:00,0,fireline works great for me under most conditions 6/2 for jigging just don't set the hook to hard. improved trilene knot has worked fine for me never use any glue. got to use flame green to see the strike.
526717,515,2003-01-24 09:12:00,254,I've switched to power pro last year and have had great luck with it. Found it easy to work with and knots seem to hold well.Smokey
