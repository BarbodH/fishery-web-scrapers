Jim Booi, 41, and Tracy Booi, 39, both of Red Lake have also been personally fined $1,000 each.Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) Red Lake District Conservation Officers and a Fort Frances District flying officer were conducting an enforcement blitz on Trout Lake, northeast of the town of Red Lake on June 21, 2001. The officers located a large number of fish fillets in a camp freezer at Booi's Wilderness Lodge. After unfreezing the fish, the officers counted 67 walleye.Officers had cautioned the lodge owners on other occasions that all fish must be accounted for at the camp. In addition, the lodge owners had been told they could not stockpile fish that had been donated by the guests for the advertised weekly chowder night. None of the guests or lodge staff claimed any of the fish found in the freezer on that day.In addition to the fines, the court issued several orders to the lodge owners. The court ordered that no fish caught by the guests could be kept in the lodge kitchen and that only commercially caught fish could be used for making chowder. As well, the lodge in conjunction with MNR must develop a harvest monitoring system by May 2003 to record the harvest of fish caught by guests. Justice of the Peace Marg Pasloski passed sentence at the Ontario Court of Justice in Red Lake on November 1, 2002. She stated that in arriving at the sentence, she took into account the amount of walleye, the commercial connection of the offence, and the need for deterrence.The public is encouraged to help protect its natural resources by reporting violations to the local Ministry of Natural Resources or to Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477)."
526081,Guest,2003-01-13 12:09:00,0,"I know the perfect place for you!!!! (And its only a five minute boat ride from fort frances, thats just across the border from international falls.) You need to go to campfire island lodge. It is located on Rainy Lake, the best smallmouth fishery in north america according to Al Linder. You automatically get guides that know the water very well, and get to cruise the lakes in 20ft Lund ProGuide Boats with 75 hp Honda's. Its a great place and you will catch a lot of huge smallmouth. I've been there many of times, Dean and the rest of the guides will do everything to make you happy. Enjoy your trip. Call (807)-274-9500 or go to there email address and www.campfireisland.comTell them CoonCain sent you.The Smallmouth Fishing is unbelievable!!!!"

526061,Guest,2003-01-08 20:25:00,0,"Click on www.sunsetcountry.net and recieve a free map of northwestern Ontario with hundreds of lodges and outfitters listed, complete with their web sites, a person could spend days just checking out these sites. You can also get another free map from www.heartlandon.ca , of course when you order these via the internet, you will also recieve several emails from various camp owners, plus they will also send you brocheres in the mail. But if you are hunting for a new place to fish this info is what you want. Then when you think you've found something ask about it on this site. The main thing to remember is , the more difficult it is to get into a lake, the better the fishing will be. If it has a nice concrete boat launch, beware, it's probably been hit hard for years, like Dog and Tunnel, the farther into the bush the better."

526049,Guest,2002-12-23 12:39:00,0,"I'm looking for a good lake/lodge in Ontario for June of next summer. We've been going to Dog Lake near Wawa but could not get reservations for early to mid-June. Any ideas/suggestions? Have a good boat so a bigger lake is not a problem. We're not exactly professionals so we'd like a place where the fishing is not too tough (we take our dad and another older guy, too). We'd be willing to drive a few hours into Ontario--we normally go through the Soo. Any suggestions would be appreciated.Thanks."

526052,Guest,2002-12-24 10:21:00,0,When you get to Wawa gas up and drive another 8-9 hours ! Lac SeulOnly lake I personally know in the Wawa area where there are tons of fish (but not much size and mostly pike) is the Magpie. Here is a link to drive in lodges/camps in the Wawa area but my suggestion is to gas up and keep going at least until you get to the Thunder Bay area.http://www.wawa.cc/visitors/road_access_fishing.htmlGood lucklobo
526056,Rich B,2002-12-25 23:03:00,1081,"Would recommend a fairly new camp just two hours out of the Soo,which is Camp Kuha. The camp is on Tunnel Lake, which is surroundedby about 98% crown land. There is a decent size river that feeds thislake which has good walleye, smallmouth and Pike. The camp is only 4-5 years old with new log cabins (housekeeping)and run by a retired doctor and his wife. Very nice people thatlove to fish, and keep the log cabins very clean.The website is www.campkuha.com Reasonable rates ($700 US for a cabin for the week). They have aramp at the camp, and nice docks. I've been up the last 3 years,and would be taking my son & buddies up again, except we're headingfor a family fishing trip in northern Minn this summer.For what it's worth, I'm not related to anyone at this camp. It's a family run camp that is very clean, has good fishing, and great owners.....and close to the Soo, so it may be what you're looking for ?It books up early every year, so you may want to see what they still have available (there are only 4 cabins available at any one time). Good luck with your search."
