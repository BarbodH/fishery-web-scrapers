524810,scar,2003-01-08 13:00:00,196,"scar go to www.boois.comthey have a camp just east of red lake. it is a short 15 - 20 minute flight that gets you on trout lake. you will have access to 100,000 acres of water and the fishing for walleye, lake trout and northern is unbelieveable.walleyes average 4 pounds with many caught 6 - 8.every year we catch northers over 40'' by accident and the lake trout fishing is a no brainer in may and june.accomadations are world class and a week will cost you under a grand per person. did i mention 4 stroke motors on all boats?tell them don from minocqua sent you!"
524811,Tracker99,2003-01-11 13:58:00,5,"I have been on many Canadian fishing trips, and Luenbergers out of Nakina ,Ont have by far hands down the best selection of lakes and services. I've been there in May,June,July,and August and August was the best time no bugs and moderate temps. June,July temps are great but bugs can be a problem. May is great if you like ice fishing. Hope I could help and good luck!"

Jim Booi, 41, and Tracy Booi, 39, both of Red Lake have also been personally fined $1,000 each.Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) Red Lake District Conservation Officers and a Fort Frances District flying officer were conducting an enforcement blitz on Trout Lake, northeast of the town of Red Lake on June 21, 2001. The officers located a large number of fish fillets in a camp freezer at Booi's Wilderness Lodge. After unfreezing the fish, the officers counted 67 walleye.Officers had cautioned the lodge owners on other occasions that all fish must be accounted for at the camp. In addition, the lodge owners had been told they could not stockpile fish that had been donated by the guests for the advertised weekly chowder night. None of the guests or lodge staff claimed any of the fish found in the freezer on that day.In addition to the fines, the court issued several orders to the lodge owners. The court ordered that no fish caught by the guests could be kept in the lodge kitchen and that only commercially caught fish could be used for making chowder. As well, the lodge in conjunction with MNR must develop a harvest monitoring system by May 2003 to record the harvest of fish caught by guests. Justice of the Peace Marg Pasloski passed sentence at the Ontario Court of Justice in Red Lake on November 1, 2002. She stated that in arriving at the sentence, she took into account the amount of walleye, the commercial connection of the offence, and the need for deterrence.The public is encouraged to help protect its natural resources by reporting violations to the local Ministry of Natural Resources or to Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477)."

You need to go to campfire island lodge. It is located on Rainy Lake, the best smallmouth fishery in north america according to Al Linder. You automatically get guides that know the water very well, and get to cruise the lakes in 20ft Lund ProGuide Boats with 75 hp Honda's. Its a great place and you will catch a lot of huge smallmouth. I've been there many of times, Dean and the rest of the guides will do everything to make you happy. Enjoy your trip. Call (807)-274-9500 or go to there email address and www.campfireisland.comTell them CoonCain sent you.The Smallmouth Fishing is unbelievable!!!!"

524799,jwarren177A,2002-10-07 14:46:00,2,I and my wife would like to take a fishing trip to Canada in 2003.I need some advice as to what time of year. June thru September?The lakes that provide services as well as good fishing.I have been told of a Lake Gowganda and have fished in the Souix Lookout area back quite a few years.Any info would be appreciated. Thanks Jess
524800,Guest,2002-10-07 16:11:00,0,"Hey Jess.Canada is a pretty big country so I was wondering if you might be more specific...east, west, north, far north, farther north...."
524801,jwarren177A,2002-10-08 07:59:00,2,"Looking for a lodge/cabins for good service and fishing.My first post I neglected to state a specific general area.I was thinking about Ontario and approximately 100 to 300 miles north of U.S. border. Thanks again, Jess."
524802,Guest,2002-10-08 08:33:00,0,"What border crossing, what budget, fly-in or boat-in or drive-in, what kind of accomodations-American Plan, Housekeeping or other? The nice thing about Ontario is there there are so many choices? My Uncle likes Uchi Lake Lodge, an American Plan fly-in (I believe in the Sioux Lookout area about $1000 per person). My brothers and I boated in on boat arranged by Cascade Camp on Rainy Lake a couple of years ago. About a 25 miles boat ride for $90 total boat ride in and $90 total for boat ride out. An older Housekeeping, bare bones fishing camp. Daily rate and a very inexpensive trip. Outstanding Smallmouth Bass fishing. Fishing is the entertainment, no running to town for pizza and a movie. There are boat-in American Plans with nice accomodations and meals. Check out Lake of the Woods, Rainy Lake, Eagle Lake and Lac Suel resorts on the Internet.There are many nice drivin resorts. My brother, Jay, went to Camp Wenasaga, a drive-in housekeeping lodge,north of Ear Falls with his wife and daughters. Good Walleye Lake.Good luck, good times and good fishing to you and your wife.Gary"

524805,johnno,2003-01-04 15:55:00,4,"We have been fishing near Sioux Lookout for 5 years now and stay at Anderson resort and rate the service as top notch as well as the cabins. If you are after actual bath tubs, ceiling fans, heated cabins , and decent sized walleyes, I think this is the place for you. I would recommend a guide at least for the first couple of days because you can access many lakes from there.No, I am not a resort owner pitching a sale, but just like the accomadations. Hope this helps."
