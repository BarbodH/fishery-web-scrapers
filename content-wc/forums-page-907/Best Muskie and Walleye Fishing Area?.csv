526787,Guest,2003-01-22 15:48:00,0,Have heard from numerous people who have visited Big Narrows Resort that it is situated on the most abundant muskie and walleye fishing area on Lake of the Woods...Is this True? There website and prices seem very reasonable...has anyone heard anything about Big Narrows Island? or the resort?

526790,Guest,2003-01-23 12:54:00,0,"Julie see my post to the Witch Bay topic below. I can only comment on my one experience, but I really liked it. I caught lots of fish, in every conceivable way, jigs, bottom bouncers, and the shallow water Shad Rap method (again, see my other post). However, my dad didn't like the lake as much as I did. He had trouble adjusting to the slightly different methods (you know, you can't teach an old dog new tricks!!).I only fished a little for muskies, because my dad didn't want to do anything but fish for walleyes. However, I think its an untapped muskie resource. Hardly anyone fishes for muskies there, because they are mostly just chasing walleyes. I spent two hours one evening with Marv Kiley (he used to be a resident pro there), and he showed 7-8 good spots, all within 20 minutes of the camp. I even had my first strike-actually three strikes from the same fish in two consecutive casts, but failed to get hooks. If you need any other info, feel free to e-mail me at:[email protected]Bill"

Lake St. Clair, The Niagara River, The Kawartha Lakes, The Moon River Basin, The French River all offer fine Muskie and Walleye fishing. Go a tad further east and you have The Ottawa River, The St. Lawrence River, The Bay of Quinte, and Rice Lake to tangle with. All fine fisheries indeed, and they aren't named Lake of the Woods, Lac Seul and Rainy Lake for a change...Go east men!! There is nothing wrong with Northwestern Ontario but remember,the Province of Ontario is huge and has so much more to offer to the fisherman...as the provincial slogan goes...Yours To Discover."
