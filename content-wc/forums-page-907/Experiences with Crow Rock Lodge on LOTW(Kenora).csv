If your group is experienced in fishing, you can use a guide the first day or two, then go it on your own the rest of the week. On the other hand, if your entire group is new to fishing, you might want a guide every day to help you consistently catch fish, navigate the lake, avoid hitting rocks, etc. Also, some guys don't want to work that hard on their trips even though they know what they're doing, so they use a guide every day. In my experience, you generally get your moneys worth when using a guide and you will catch fish, but it can get pricey. If it's your first trip and you're going it without a guide, be sure the camp owner is willing to give you advice about places to fish as well as tell you which rocks in the area to look out for. That won't guarantee anything, but if you pay attention and use common sense, you'll be ok. Good luck."
