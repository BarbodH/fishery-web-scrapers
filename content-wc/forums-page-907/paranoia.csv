But, over the past few months, paranoiahas begun to take over a lot of posts.I can't tell if a post is an ad - they all sound good to me.Still, the belief that lodge owners are pretending to be unbiasedanglers and are praising their own camps is going to ruin everyone's trust in the info given.Is there a solution? No guest users? Would that even help?If anyone has a solution, please share it."

If a post sounds good to you, add to the discussion, ask questions, or better yet contact them by e-mail. I have guided at a lodge for numerous years, and have a very high opinion of the place and if sombody is looking for somthing along it's lines I will promote it, otherwise I usually won't. I also always welcome e-mails from people wanting to know more, as should anybody that promotes a lodge on WC.I know there is a guy called Bassmanjc that posts the exact same advertisement for some lodge in every discussion, this sounds a bit fishy to me."

Both groups have a tendency to expand the truth...thats why they call us fisherman. Its like the real world..dont listen to just one opinion ...gather lots of data and seperate the poppy seed from the mouse droppings.....the truth will be substantiated.When we look at a new lodge we get references from the Owner. We dont want his reference list we want a list of all the Guests who stayed with him last year the week before and the week after we are planning on. We always fish outposts so the list is not to extensive. We contact those people and have never been disapointed with the results.Good Luck, Mike"
