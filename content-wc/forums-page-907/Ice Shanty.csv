As everybody knows it gets pretty fricken cold out when you are out side for hours at a time. I was wondering if anybody had any good designs for an ice shanty that would be easy to make, somewhat light, big enough for up to 3 people. Any help would be more then appreciated. ThanksKodiak"

They will more than likely give you one. ( And be happy you took it off their hands. ) The vinyl from a billboard is made from a heavy guage vinyl and is very tough. I work for a billboard company and we are looking to give these old vinyl away as tarps, etcIvy"
