526492,Andyeye,2003-01-15 09:38:00,179,We are going up in August to fish and bear hunt at English River east of Ignace. I have never been to this part of Ontario before and would like to know which place to cross the border at? It looks like it would be shorter to cross below Thunder Bay rather than Fort Francis. Can anyone give me some advice? Thanks!

526495,Guest,2003-01-15 14:26:00,0,"The route from Duluth to the Pigeon River border crossing along the lakeshore is very scenic, you will however get behind traffic that is difficult to pass, as the road has lots of curves and hills. It is still the best route to take if you're heading up through Duluth. Always enjoyed looking out across Lake Superior."

526496,Guest,2003-01-16 10:04:00,0,The shortest way is 35 N to 53 N to fort frances! The scenic route is the 35 N to Duluth then 61 to Grand Portage!
