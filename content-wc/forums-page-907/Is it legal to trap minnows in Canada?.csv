526793,McQ,2003-01-22 16:44:00,615,Where in Canada? Every province has it's own set of rules. If you are seeking a detailed answer try narrowing down your reference.
526794,David/MN,2003-01-22 17:44:00,249,It also depends on if you are a resident or not.......dw

526797,Trailerguy,2003-01-22 18:39:00,1407,"The answer is no, you cannot legally trap minnows. That changed several years ago when the dealers convinced the MNR to charge them more for their licenses and they got territories and exclusive rights. I beleive a resident can have 1 minnow trap and a specific number of minnows on hand. The fine is around $150 cnd for this offence."
