508129,Guest,2000-06-07 07:36:00,0,"Fishing is awesome on diefenbaker right now. I live in Kyle, Saskatchewan which is only 10 miles from the lake and I fish it almost daily! Lots and lots of walleyes are being caught with some big ones, big Pike are plentiful and 3-8 pound rainbows are a daily occurence. If you are interested in hetting some advive on techniques or locations feel free to email me at [email protected]. I caught 16 walleyes this morning off of shore but only a couple were over 3 pounds!!Saskman"
