507656,Guest,2000-05-20 21:07:00,0,"Hubers lodge is great. Great hospitality and awesome food. THere are no time contraints on eating your meals if you go with the American Plan, which is great. The fishing was better than Eagle Lake. We caught alot of Walleye and Pike. We will be there on the 9th of June. Have fun."
