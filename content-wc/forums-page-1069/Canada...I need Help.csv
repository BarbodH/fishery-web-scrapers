If anyone can help with any of these questions, I would appreciate any info.Thank You.1) How is the border crossing at Sault Ste. Marie (best time to cross, duty free shop, etc.)?2) With the gas prices the way they are now, is it best to convert $s? And for hotel stay as well?3) Once across the border, is there a good place to purchase fishing licenses?4) I will be traveling 17 N/NW towards Ignace, how long will it take me to get to Wawa/White River/Marathon/Terrace Bay?

The Duty-Free store in the Soo is open from 7:00 A.M. until midnight, I don't think there is any time better than another to cross, there is a visitor's center you can see from the exit of the immigration parking lot, a good place to exchange money, which I feel is a must, ok to charge motels and gas, etc. but you have to have cash and you really need local currency, visitor's center doesn't have fishing licenses this year, got mine at the Trading Post, on east side of 17 at northern outskirts of Sault. Time and distance from Sault Ste. Marie to Wawa is 135 miles and 2 hours and 15 minutes, from Wawa to White River is 57 miles so almost another hour, I leave 17 at White River but I think it's about another 50-60 miles from W-R to Marathon"
