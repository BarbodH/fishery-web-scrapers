508159,Guest,2000-06-05 15:40:00,0,"You can expect a friendly Canadian greeting of ""Welcome to Canada "". However if you bring guns or other illegal bad things to this country we will escort you back to where you came from.Do yourself a favour and look at the Canada Customs website and check your fishing regs available online before you go. ""If you fail to plan you plan to fail""."
