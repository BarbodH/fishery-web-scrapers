508095,acp,2000-06-03 05:57:00,156,I think you'll find that all live bait EXCEPT night crawlers are banned. And night crawlers must not be packed in dirt but some sort of bedding.Later....Al

508098,Guest,2000-06-04 14:32:00,0,"I am looking at a message I got from <[email protected]> on June 02,2000 10:09 AM.Hello GordonYou are allowed to bring worms across the border into Ontario. Because you are not allowed to bring soil across an international border you need to use some other bedding material such as peat moss or synthetic bedding.NRIC web reader - drNatural Resources Information Centre300 Water St.Peterborough, ONK9J8M5phone(416)314-2000 or 1-800-667-1940fax (705)755-1677"
