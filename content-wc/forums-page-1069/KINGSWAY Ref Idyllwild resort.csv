The cost is also very reasonable. The best thing you can do is to call them at 1-807-926-2413 or e-mail [email protected]Tell them I said ""Hi"" and I will see them on the 16th. If you have other questions please let me know if I can be of help. I hope you like your stay and catch lots of fish. Where are you from? When will you be going there? Good Luck,Richard"

508111,Guest,2000-06-05 15:59:00,0,I've been at the resort and I think they have one of the nicest spots on Kashabowie Lake. It doesn't get any better.
508112,kingsway,2000-06-05 17:10:00,27,"For those of you interested in the full information I posted awhile back here it is. Anyone wanting a great fishing experience at a very reasonable cost. Try ""The Idyllwild Resort"" on Kashabowie Lake, Ontario. Located just 65 mi W/NW of Thunder Bay, Ontario (off Hy.11). The lake is 14 mi. long has many islands, bay, and channels. The fishing there is great for Walleye, Lake Trout, Small mouth Bass, and Northern Pike. Rates for a (fully modern) 3-bedroom cabin for up to 6 persons are $450.00 per week Canadian dollars (which translates to about $320.00 American dollars total). Not per person as many places charge and then they charge American Dollars beside. For a rustic, 1 bedroom cabin that sleeps 4, the weekly rate is only $250.00 (about $180.00 American Dollars). You can bring your own boat or rent theirs. Call and talk to Sue at 1-807-926-2413 or e-mail Sue at [email protected] . I have done fly-in fishing, fished Red Lake, Ear Falls, Parroult falls, Vermillion Bay, and I would say that this place provides more bang for the American Dollar than any of the others I have tried so far. I do not have any financial interest in this lodge or any other benefit from telling about this place. I just wanted to share an excellent Canadian fishing trip that the average American can afford, with fellow fishermen Hope you enjoy your stay as well as me and my wife will June 17-23."
