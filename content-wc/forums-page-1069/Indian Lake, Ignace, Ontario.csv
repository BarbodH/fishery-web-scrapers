Specifically, water levels, temps, and if the fish are still shallow. Has anyone followed this area's 2000 spring weather patterns? Any info would be helpful. I've fished the area for 22 years and would be happy to share my knowledge. Will post results of upcoming trip. Thanks in advance."

Shallower darker lakes (typical walleye lake) were in the low 60's for temps. Although we caught walleyes shallow up on the weeds in the evening casting, most fish were already in deeper water (18'-30'). Pike have moved into the deep weed beds already and off of points or midlake reefs. Cabbage weeds were already 2-4' high. We fished lake trout on Sturgeon and did well. Fish were up suspended near shorelines at 10'-0"" deep and spoons or plugs worked well. Water temp. was about 53 deg. and had climbed from 49 deg. to 53 in three days. Fish will be down deeper now. Maybe 30' ??? Pike"
