The lake is huge and although I'm getting to learn it and have done pretty well with other species, I have yet to figure out where the trophy sized walleyes can be caught at this time of year. Though the lake is known more for number than size, I know there are a few out there. If anyone who has had success at Eagle can give me a few spots, fishing patterns or seasonal movements I'd really appreciate it.ThanksDB"
