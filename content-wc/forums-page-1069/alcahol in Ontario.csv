I'm not sure about the rest of Canada but Ontario has a zero tolerance for alcahol on the water. Last year on Lac De Mille Lacs we had a party of six in two boats. The two soaks that were with us each brought along two beers for the day. They had each consumed one in the morning and one with their shore lunch. While tidying up the OPP showed up and checked us out. They found two empties in our shore lunch garbage bag, yes they dug them out, then checked our boats where the found the two empties from the morning and two full cans in the cooler. The two banditos were ticketed and the boat owner informed he also could have been ticketed for alowing an open container. I guess it was good of them for that but I fail to see the danger here especially since neither one of those two soaks were operating the boat. Zero means Zero at least on that lake. Just keep that in mind. Good luck... Skeeter Boy"
508149,Randy,2000-06-05 15:19:00,53,Does the no alcohol in the boat apply to every lake in Ontario. I was at a fly-in lodge last year and haven't heard of this rule. I'm heading to a remote drive-in on Wednesday and would like to know the law prior to buying beer.

508151,Guest,2000-06-05 15:52:00,0,You cannot have any alcohol away from your residence in the province of Ontario. Beer or drinking in the boat is a definite no. Seems the OPP or RCMP every time theres a drowning or a crash greater than 50% of the time drinking is involved. Snowmobiling is the same thing. Drinking doesn't mix.I'm surprised it is allowed in the USA.
508152,Guest,2000-06-05 16:45:00,0,"Though I've said it before, another fine example of managing to the lowest denominator or worst case scenario. As with the lodging/limit rules, importation of bait, closure of remote border crossings, killing any fish to be kept on slot lakes etc. the rule changes get made because of the unfortunate few and the ones who typically get hurt are the local economies and resort owners. I can't think of anywhere I'd rather spend a few days, so I'll continue to go. It sure would be nice if the majority didn't always take it up the a$$ because of the few."

This is according to the new boating laws coming into affect here in Canada."
508154,Guest,2000-06-06 17:13:00,0,"Eyesore: I'm proud to be a Canadian, even if I can't drink in my boat. The carnage of drinking and driving a motorized vehicle is well documented. A beer with a shore lunch is a beautiful thing and there is nothing wrong with it. The OPP have a zero tollerance to beer in the boat because it was ruined by a few.I love Eyesholes post, it tells the whole story. Good fishing: Frank"
508157,Guest,2000-06-06 21:37:00,0,"No one mentioned that cops don't make the laws, they get paid to enforce them.This goes for the OPP.The RCMP.The state troopers and yes even the guy called Walker Texas Ranger!!! PS. No I am not a cop!!"
