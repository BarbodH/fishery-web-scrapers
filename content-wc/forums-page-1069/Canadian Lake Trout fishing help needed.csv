508046,kingsway,2000-06-05 17:32:00,27,"Thanks for all the great tips. I will post here on Walleyes and Lake Trout fishing on Lake Kashabowie after I return from the trip on June 23. If anyone is interested in an excellent fishing trip below is a copy of the post for the lodge I made some time back. ""Anyone wanting a great fishing experience at a very reasonable cost. Try ""The Idyllwild Resort"" on Kashabowie Lake, Ontario. Located just 65 mi W/NW of Thunder Bay, Ontario (off Hy.11). The lake is 14 mi. long has many islands, bay, and channels. The fishing there is great for Walleye, Lake Trout, Small mouth Bass, and Northern Pike. Rates for a (fully modern) 3-bedroom cabin for up to 6 persons are $450.00 per week Canadian dollars (which translates to about $320.00 American dollars total). Not per person as many places charge and then they charge American Dollars beside. For a rustic, 1 bedroom cabin that sleeps 4, the weekly rate is only $250.00 (about $180.00 American Dollars). You can bring your own boat or rent theirs. Call and talk to Sue at 1-807-926-2413 or e-mail Sue at [email protected] . I have done fly-in fishing, fished Red Lake, Ear Falls, Parroult falls, Vermillion Bay, and I would say that this place provides more bang for the American Dollar than any of the others I have tried so far. I do not have any financial interest in this lodge or any other benefit from telling about this place. I just wanted to share an excellent Canadian fishing trip that the average American can afford, with fellow fishermen Hope you enjoy your stay as well as me and my wife will June 17-23."""
508036,kingsway,2000-05-24 13:08:00,27,"I will be fishing Walleyes during mid-June in Canada and I am told there are lots of Lake Trout in the same body of water. I have never fished Lake Trout before. I would like some tips on the type of rigging, (trolling technique, equipment needed, speeds etc.), various bait types & colors, depths and what to use to get down there. The more info the better. What has worked for you? Keep in mind a limited budget. Thanks in advance.Rich"
508037,Guest,2000-05-24 17:56:00,0,Use big spoons with a swivel(no leader). daredevil huskies and husky jrs. are good. The lakers shouldn't be too deep(20 to 30 ft) and you may locate them by slow trolling. Sometimes you can get them by casting.
508038,Chevy,2000-05-24 18:57:00,5,"Extra large minnows rigged with a single through the lips and a small stinger treble attached to the underside just in front of the tail is the cheapest way to go. Use a swivel a couple feet in front of the minnow. A slow troll and your set. Real, real cheap and it works. A small portable downrigger is handy but would cost a few dollars.Good luck!"
508039,whitey,2000-05-25 08:46:00,36,"ive fished northern sask. and southern NWT during late June and early july. the trout have been shallow (15 ft. we troll spoons,(daredevil, redeyes) also try a johnson silver minnow with a rubber trailer. chartruse works good. also have caught alot on rattle traps and a mepps spinner bait that has a rubber minnow on the end. (you buy it this way, $5)We troll slow but not at deep depths. depends on how warm the water is and has been as to how deep the trout will be. good luck!try a few different things and see what works."
508040,Sunshine,2000-05-25 09:13:00,3174,"You can jig for these fish if you're capable of staying over them with fish locator. My favorite is a white tube jig. Use just enough weight to get it down to fish zone. If they're deep try trolling. I like using spoons like north port nailers. You can use a ""poor man's downrigger"" by using snap on weights. Slow is usually best then slow down some more. You want a seductive wobble."

508043,Randy,2000-05-31 08:07:00,53,Large Rapala Shad Raps trolled in 25-35 ft of water with 10lb line. With this light of line the Shad Rap will go down 20 ft deep or so. They will come up and get it. Bright colors are the best.
508044,Brownie,2000-05-31 10:35:00,12,"The last couple of trips I have taken, we have done some lake trout fishing. All of the previous suggestions are good, and I will reiterate some of those. Most important, in my mind, is to have a depth finder. Look for the fish before you start trolling. You can tell when you are over a school of bait fish and trout when your located goes crazy -- it looks like a false echo. We've had the most success trolling thin spoons (north point nailer, etc.), and the best colors for us have been silver or copper. We were first turned on to trolling for lake trout using a 3-way swivel with a dropper line to a lead weight. The problem with a 3-way rig is the weight is within 6 or so feet of the spoon. As one of the previous responders said, we refined the method by using the Off-Shore snap-on weight system (available through Cabela's and Bass Pro Shops mail order). With that system, you can put the weight as far away from the spoon (or floating rapala (silver w/blue back) as you want. We have found that the larger spoons seem to catch larger trout. I have jigged for trout, and have had some success. Large white bucktail jigs seem to work well, particularly when the trout are in deep holes in schools. When they are shallower, they seem to be more spread out, and trolling is more efficient. As someone else said, go as slow as possible, and make lots of ""S"" turns to keep the spoons changing directions. Good luck!"
508045,Guest,2000-05-31 18:52:00,0,"Hey there,Lakers are genneraly found deep in summertime, try fishing with a three way swivel, tie one end to your main line, a 6 foot peice of mono with a leader and spoon on the other attachment, and on the third attachment, tie 3 feet of line and as big a bell sinker as you need to het down there.You can use the same rig in the spring, just move in a little shallower, silver spoons are always a good bet!Pikeman (the real one)"
