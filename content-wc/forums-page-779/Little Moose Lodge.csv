544887,Guest,2005-01-01 15:12:00,0,Could anyone give me any info on Little Moose Lodge.We are thinking of going this year after 10 years of going to the same place. I would like to how the Clearwater/Pipestone lakes are (fishing pressure etc.).Any info would be great. Thanks in advance and I hope you will have a great and walleye filled New Year.

The owner told me that pipestone is great for smallmouth, and muskie, but for walleye Yoke is his gem. They have very nice lodge and cabins, with new boats. I pass little moose on clearwater where we park are cars. It seems to me that clearwater has 10 or 11 resorts and every piece of shoreline has a cabin on it, which in turn means alot of pressure. I can get tons of fishing pressure at home, this is why I go to canada, solitude, good fishing, nice people, and good food. I know Happy landing is only 28 miles from little moose, but it seems like 2800 miles. After many years fishing at different lodge is canada we found HL at the chicago sport show 4 yrs ago, we've been happy ever since. Where ever you go this summer good luck."

544895,Guest,2005-01-01 20:44:00,0,We were at Little Moose 2 years ago and did not catch many fish on Clearwater Lake. There were a lot of boaters there. We did have good days on Pipestone for smallmouth but only caught 1 5 inch walleye the whole 4 days there in late August. Its supposed to be a great spring bite for walleye but obviously we missed the boat. Little Moose's cabins were not as nice as the fly-in we stayed at this year and left a lot to be desired. We did however enjoy the owner Mark and he was a very nice stand-up guy who makes a #### of a bonfire!
