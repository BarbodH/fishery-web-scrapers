Been looking at buying a camp, the realty sites are vague as to what swims in the lakes that they list properties on....I want to save some time, and just look at places that have Walleye fishing. Thanks!"
544868,Guest,2004-12-30 13:30:00,0,I suggest calling the MNR office for the particular lake you are looking at. They are very forthcoming with fish information. Plus they have no vested interest in telling you if it is good or bad. They will just tell you what they know. I have not found a web site that will give you what you are looking for. Calling and talking to the Fish Biologist might be your best move. Good luck.
544896,Guest,2005-01-01 20:58:00,0,The book you need to consider looking at is: The Guide to Eating Sport Fish In Northwest Ontario. Remember that some of the lakes in Ontario are polluted with heavy metal. You will want to read this when looking at a particular lake.
