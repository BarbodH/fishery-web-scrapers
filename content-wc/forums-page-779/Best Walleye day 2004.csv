544933,Guest,2005-01-05 10:55:00,0,"We fished on Ogabonatcha lake in Manitoba the last week in July. The best day we had (two of us) was 317 walleye with the biggest being 33"". We had alot of fish over 24"". It was like fishing in an aquarium."
544934,Guest,2005-01-05 11:42:00,0,"smasher, where is that lake? google and yahoo never heard of it. spelling?"
544935,Guest,2005-01-05 11:42:00,0,It sounds like some of you are exaggerating your catches. Over 300 walleyes in one day. Are you guys using a counter or just guessing. Maybe you have had to much to drink during the week and you are seeing double. As much as I like to catch walleye and we have had some 50 count days but no where close to 100 count days I like to change and catch lake trout or pike. It seems like all some of you do is go after walleye only. Doesn't catching all these fish damage and shorten the life of the fish.
544936,Guest,2005-01-05 12:05:00,0,"Whit, Lake Ogabonatcha is a Private Corporate fly in located just off of the Berens River Chain in northren Manitoba. It has been controlled by one of our Corporate customers for about 15 years and I have been lucky enough to fish it with them three times. The fishing is awesome and I think it is because they only fish it 8 weeks a year. They have Indian Guides and all the food is Amercian Plan with first class accomadations. We also catch some nice Pike but I perfer to fish for Walleye.....200 plus fish days are very common as long as the wind and rain dont kick up."
544937,Guest,2005-01-05 12:13:00,0,"shoe 89, I know that 300 Walleye days are possible because we have had them with just 2 guys in the boat. Manitoba is barbless hooks and I really believe that it reduces fish damage. When fishing barbless it is easy to release fish at the side of the boat without ever touching them. If you dont touch them or draw blood their survival rate goes way up."
544938,Guest,2005-01-05 12:40:00,0,I know its hurts a few of them when they hit the oil in the bottom of the frying pan.
544982,eyesNsox,2005-01-10 15:06:00,67,Hey Dave B. We have comunicated in the past regarding our visits to Witch Bay Camp. I know the presentation that you are refering to as it has also worked well for me on LOW. Are you guys going up again this year? Are you planning to go to the Chicagoland Outdoor Show in Rosemont this week? Ed eyes&sox
544905,Guest,2005-01-03 12:37:00,0,"Lets hear about your best Walleye fishing day during 2004. Three of us fished on Lac Seul on July 7. We caught 379 Walleye with 12 fish over 27"" and the biggest being 29 1/2"". There were six of us there for the week and we totaled 1629 Walleye for the week. It was our groups seventh trip to LS and the best we had ever done before that was 1217 fish for a week. Our worst week ever is 847 fish. No pike in count."
544911,Guest,2005-01-03 20:33:00,0,What area of Lac Seul? We are going the third week in June to Evergreen by Ear Falls. Can anyone fill me in on that area. Any response to this area of Lac Seul is appreciated. Go Hawks!
544914,Guest,2005-01-04 06:56:00,0,We stay at Black Bay Outpost out of Lac Seul lodge. Black Bay is located in the South Central area of the lake. It is a long ways from Ear Falls and Evergreen.
544915,2 DOGS,2005-01-04 08:57:00,361,"Approx. 45 miles from Evergreen. You will have run over thousands of walleye to get there! Great fishing, but there's great fishing throughout Lac Seul most of the time. People at Evergreen will give you a map with good locations alot closer to camp."
544916,Mike Kansas,2005-01-04 09:32:00,1463,"Hump 1, We have fished at both Black Bay and Evergreen and Black Bay is way to far to travel if you are staying at Evergreen. My wife and I stayed at Evergreen last year in June and did very well catching Walleye. My wife caught a 31 1/2"" Walleye out of Evergreen. The camp owners will bend over backwards to help you catch fish and the overall service and quality is second to none at Evergreen. Good Luck, Mike"
544917,Guest,2005-01-04 13:01:00,0,"Is it hard to navigate around camp. I have heard that there is alot of rocks etc. For some reason, I also visualize a huge body of water that gets very rough. However from photos it doesn't appear that way."
544918,Mike Kansas,2005-01-04 13:23:00,1463,"Hump 1, Everthing is marked very well and Evergreen will give you a map that shows the travel routes and the places to fish. We had good luck in the river west of camp and fishing the markers as you travel south. We also did well fishing east towards the sanctuary. The farthest we went south was the Narrows and it held some nice fish."
544919,2 DOGS,2005-01-04 13:31:00,361,"Remember this is a reservoir! You'll get tired of me reminding you about the ""MAP"", but pay attention to it and you won't have alot of trouble. It is not a place you can just rip off any direction you feel like, unless you know where the reefs are! Yes, there are some areas with ""big"" water and yes, it can get rough, but there are many bays that you can find to duck in out of the wind. Don't go up there with the expectation of everybody catching 100 fish a day, every day. Lac Seul is great BUT the fish up there still react to weather changes like anywhere else. I have fished the Black Bay area also and had wonderful fishing. I've also fished it when it was tough to catch enough for shore lunch. You will have a great time and can catch lots of fish within a few miles of camp."
544920,Guest,2005-01-04 13:40:00,0,"My best day in 2004 was not a numbers day, but we found some real nice fish. We were fishing Lake of the Woods spending most of our time fishing for muskies. But, early in or week trip, through the camp's fishing instructors, we found that big walleye were up shallow on the rock reefs in the middle of the lake. On Wednesday July 21st my fishing buddy I took off for the reefs first thing in the morning, and at the first spot we pulled up at and before I even had the bow mounted trolling motor in the water, my buddy had a fish on. We netted and measured the fish at 28.5"". We proceeded to fish that spot and 2 others as the wind steadily picked up, and by 10 a.m. (after about 2 1/2 hours of fishing) the wind and waves were too much and we had to leave the open reefs, but by that time we had put 21 fish in the boat, with 15 of them 24"" or better, and the longest being 29. We started out casting shad raps (SR-9s) up into the rocks, but with the wind blowing, we switched to the Super Shad Raps with our muskie rods and reels, and the fish seemed to like those just as much. In fact, after we switched to those, we didn't catch any of the smaller fish. Short period of fishing but it sure was hot. We still managed to catch a few more nice fish in the middle of the day, including a 28"" fish that followed up a super shad rap and hit it right at boatside off a windblown rocky point, but not the numbers like we did earlier."
