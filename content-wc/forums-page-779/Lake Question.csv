544909,Guest,2005-01-03 16:40:00,0,This will be my fourth year coming to Canada for a fly-in. The lake is Kabanakagami. I was just wondering why I never see any posts about this lake. The lodges are great ( Pine Portage & Kaby ) and the people are wonderful. The fishing is non-stop for walleye and northern. It does seem that most posts here are about fishing in northwest Ontario. I was just curious. Any replys would be appreciated. Thanks
