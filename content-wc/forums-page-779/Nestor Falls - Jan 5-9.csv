Will there be enough ice to drive to trout somewhere you guys think or only snowmobiles? Crappie or eyes going? I went last year for part of a day there last Feb and had a great time catching crappies Thanks!

Ask the motel owners about Otterskin Lake, it's past Crow, but lots of trout. I've caught 25-30 a day there before. Let me know how you do."

544488,Todd_NE,2004-12-10 12:30:00,1330,"Any suggestions for where to stay and fish at this time. I think... were going to have good ice by then! I've been there once for a day and have a buddy from northern minnesota going to. Just wondered what you guys might suggest. Open to crappie, eyes, trout - I like perch but my buddy doesn't! Isn't that right Black Dog. Todd Not the victory but the action; Not the goal but the game; In the deed, the glory - Memorial Stadium"
