544701,Guest,2004-12-20 19:47:00,0,"It seems I am getting a bit ripped off, but it is for 7 days. We are getting old and trying to get through those large waves took it out of us. Do you guys know of a good fly-in for Wallies and Muskies?"
544737,Mr Ranger,2004-12-22 18:28:00,272,"The money is important but there is a lot that goes into value. Our group has gone on a drive up the past two years and I have done one fly in. The drive up which we are now doing costs about $700.00 each for a party of four. We pull a trailer, take one vehicle, split food & gas evenly for the 1,400 mile round trip. This is a total cost for ALL expenses including food, bait, license, gas, etc. which we think is very fair. One problem however is the exchange rate. Two years ago it was about 40%, last year 30% and this year so far is down to maybe 15%. That raises the price. Back to value: given the value of 12 months of planning with my best friends, the value of getting me through winter in Wisconsin (I refuse to ice fish) and the value of absolutely loving the experience of spending a solid week just fishing makes this priceless in my mind. We are lucky that we go to a camp where we are learning more and more about the fishery. I have a number of friends that have been burned going up without knowing the people they are working with. Word of mouth and hitting the shows is a great way to learn where to go. One suggestion, single out and question some of the attendees vs. the exhibitors. Good luck on your choices and drive safely. God bless America, the Packers and the right to fish!"
544752,Atlanta Dave,2004-12-23 18:29:00,323,We fish northern Alberta and our cost for the fly in is about 3000 for a week but we almost always get a pike over 20 lbs and a trout over 30 lbs each week we are there . That is per man i have a day ;with 8 pike over 20 so we feel it is worth the cost plus great comradiere. Atlanta Dave

544892,Guest,2005-01-01 17:38:00,0,"We (6-8) travel from Iowa to the Red Lake area...2 vehicles - $50.00 each to the drivers for gas/wear...go in July/August and get the father/son/daughter packages - $700-$800.00...we look for resorts that include gas, conservation license and bait in their packages... take up a Cabelas ""Canadian pack"" of crawlers, $5.00 each. Food and soft beverages - $40.00 each (we plan on 4 meals of fresh walleye fillets)...Overnight stay in Ft. Francis $25.00 each (like to cross the border in the evening). The basics I've listed takes us up and back at $500.00 a person at a quality drive-in resort. Add another $100.00 for adult beverages, stop at the Casino and a ""thank-you"" gift for my better-half. Cough ps...add a additional $50-$100 for new line, gadgets, tackle I'll never use and to fix 1-2 rods that I've broken the tips off of LOL!"
544897,Guest,2005-01-02 06:03:00,0,"We go from the Buffalo area to Air Ivanhoe for a fly-in trip with 8 guys. The trip costs around $900 US for each guy. Includes food, license, booze, stay at the the lodge the night before, gas. The trip is well worth the money, nice4 lakes and cabins. This past September was our second trip with Air Ivanhoe and we are planning on going back."

544560,Guest,2004-12-15 22:06:00,0,"I do not consider the cost of food as a expense for my trip to Lac Seul as I would eat if I stayed home but take enough for food anyway, about $75.00. We usually go with 2 trucks and 3 people per vehicle. Gas round trip from central Wisconsin about 1200 miles at $180.00. Or $60.00 each. However I would have went someplace with my truck even if I stayed home. So I will subtract $20.00 from the $60.00 and say the trip cost me $40.00. Fishing license $40.00. We dont stay in a motel as our camp allows us to come in at 7 AM. $200.00 each for cottage rental and boat dockage. $25.00 each for outboard gas. It all depends on how you look at it but I expect to spend about $400.00 on the trip but would have spent $75.00 of the cost on food if I would have stayed home and at least $20.00 on gas if I stayed home so I would say the Canada trip cost me about $305.00"

544562,Guest,2004-12-15 23:44:00,0,just the lodge is 800 with our boat. 100 a day up for 1 day and 2 days back at a 100 a day that makes 1100 for the week more or less. Its a vacation so we dont scrimp and stay at dumps or eat at mcdonalds. my 2 cents.

That includes everything plus three nights in hotels on the road. Gone ten days so a little over $100 a day for a lot of good times with good friends is not that bad. Wife and I will be in Kauai for seven days this winter, staying at a low end hotel and you can bet it is going to cost a lot more than $100 each per day! Pooch"

544637,Guest,2004-12-16 17:43:00,0,"I agree. You usually get what you pay for. I own a camp and have fishing trips from $400.00 - $1500.00/week/person, depending on what your needs are. We have a 90% return. The service is the same. Some people love to be on their own more, while others like to be catered to. It is the individuals fisherman's choice. Some people have their own boats, while others need to rent one. Cheaper is not always better. Not to say that you can't find some nice places with lower prices."
