Once that is taken care of, I think a written notarized note indicating permission, how long in force and the scope of the permission. You also might want to think about potential damage to boat and motor while on the lake. Should short term insurance for boat operation in Canada be aquired? In other words, imagine the worst and protect against it as best you can."

All I do is write up a permission letter, including the dates I will be using it...etc., and we both sign it. I have never had to use the slip to show anyone I had permission, but I planned for it..."

544883,Gary_IA,2004-12-31 10:27:00,144,"You bring up a good point. If it is a business vehicle and you own the business, then you are probably OK. If on the other hand, the vehicle is your personal car or pickup and the buddy has no association with a business run by you then I think written permission is desireable."
544885,Guest,2005-01-01 10:52:00,0,"Hi. This reminds me of our border crossing into canada once. We are from chicago and our car needed a a new engine while we were up their fishing so we left it for repairs and came back a couple of months later to get it. The rental car we were in had california plates on it and we were from chicago, boy did that confuse the canadian asking questions. he was trying to figure out why if we were from chicago did we have a car with california plates on it. did we just drive from california? we had the rental papers with us so that solved that. You never know what the person asking the questions is thinking."
544886,fishmaster,2005-01-01 11:51:00,209,Make sure you have the insurance card from yours and his insurance company with the permission of the boat and truck owner and you should be good to go. Hope he has a clean driving record also.
