I have been going to Canada for more than 20 years and I can honestly say that Whitewing has the nicest accomodations I have ever stayed at. The cabins are first class!! If you decide to get a meal at the Lodge, you won't be disappointed there either. Bobbie is an outstanding cook. We are going back in 2005 but have booked one of their houseboats for a week. Can't wait!!!"

544921,Guest,2005-01-04 13:58:00,0,"I shouldn't even mention this place because it's probably the best kept secret in the Ear Falls, Lac Suel area. But, Onaway Lodge is simply outstanding since Blair and Kathy Campbell have bought the place and are rebuilding and remodeling ""everything"" in site. I hope nobody reads this and makes it difficult for me to get available dates up there. I've been going there 12 years straight, two to three time a season and it just keeps getting better and better each year. Ron"
544922,Guest,2005-01-04 14:30:00,0,"the nicest lodge on lac seul is the one with the nicest boats. since guys spend most of their waking hours on the boat, this should be the deciding factor. as long as the cabin keeps rain and skeeters out, beer cold and water hot, that's great. the key to a good trip is a good boat. the rest is superfluous."
