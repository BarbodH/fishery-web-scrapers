544913,Guest,2005-01-04 06:00:00,0,I would like to share with anyone planning a trip to Ontario this year to take a close look at Holinshead Lake Resort. They will be represented at the All Canada Show. I personally have been returning there now for 14 years in a row. The walleye fishing is tremendous no matter what time of the summer you plan. I personally go the 1st week of Aug. when the weather stabalizes. I would be happy to share and help anyone out who would like to find out more about this great place. Their website is www.holinshead.ca. My e-mail address is [email protected]. I'd be more than happy to help out.
