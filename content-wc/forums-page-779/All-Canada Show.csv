544807,Guest,2004-12-29 05:26:00,0,Al-You can indeed pick up brochures and review them but I would definately get plenty of referrals from fishermen that have been to that particular lodge and the time of the year you would like to go. I would like to highly recommend Holinshead Lake Resort located 2 hrs. north of Thunder Bay. Feel free to e-mail me at [email protected]. I'd be happy to help you out.

Lac Suel or LOTW are prime areas with many, many outfitters, and they are straight North instead of East 200 miles and then North."
