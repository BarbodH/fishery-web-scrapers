It was larger than any of the Bald Eagles on the lake and was also by itself. It did not appear to be any type of Vulture. My Dad and I got to withing 50' or so multiple times while trolling the shoreline. It kept plodding ahead of us until we spooked it again. My Dad is a bird watcher and didn't even think of the possibility of a Golden in this region. Could it have been a Golden?"
544873,Larry L,2004-12-30 21:38:00,335,I don't know where you are located. My bird book shows the range for golden eagles covering almost all of North America at one time of the year or another. I live in Wyoming and they are quite common here. The only birds of that size that I can think of would be the eagles and vultures. Vultures will have white on the underside of thier wings. A mature golden eagle will be all dark. They may even apear black depending on the light. Mostly they will look dark brown (a little lighter than the bald eagle). If the light is right you will see golden neck feathers if you are close enough. Was it feeding on sheep? :-) THAT IS A JOKE Larry
544878,Guest,2004-12-31 08:13:00,0,"I'm more convinced than ever that it was a Golden Eagle. We were kind of buffaloed by the size and location. The lake that we were on is Kawaweogama and it is just east of Savant Lake in Northwest Ontario. It's just one of the many sheild lakes and is on the tip of the Wabakimi Provincial Park. I'll let me Dad know and look for it again this June. Only 148 days and counting. We spent Christmas in Indiana making spinner rigs...they look killer, but so did last years. Thanks, Stehle"
544880,Guest,2004-12-31 09:03:00,0,"Both species are common here where I live (Montana) and in all honesty a Golden Eagle and an immature Bald Eagle are litterally indistiguishable in the field, without close up investigation... like.. by an ornithologist. Bald Eagles don't get their white head until they are more than a year old and have been full grown for a while. But, yes it could have been a Golden, as they are wide spread, in their range."
544882,Guest,2004-12-31 10:14:00,0,"We thought about the immature Bald Eagle as well, but this thing was larger than a full grown Bald Eagle. It was a solid 6-8"" larger. It really did look out of place, but what a neat sight. That is one of the biggest thrills of going up north...the wildlife. We had bears in the camp (not real cool), and we spotted Moose, Loons, Bald Eagles, Fox, Caribou, Merganser and other Waterfowl. In West Virginia, we have a nice collection and variety of wildlife, but the animals and environment of NW Ontario is really the cherry on top of our fishing trips. If it were all about catching large Walleye, I would go to Erie."
