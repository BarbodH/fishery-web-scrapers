I am takeing my own equipment, I just feel more comfortable about using my stuff than the lodges. What sort of jigs and spoons should I bring up with me. color/size Also, do these lodges really keep you on the fish? This is the first time I have ever hired a guide, and let the fate of my trip rest in somebody's hand.. (We are staying at the Sportmens lodge). Any other info on this sort of trip will be great also.. thanx Jbird"
544912,Guest,2005-01-04 05:59:00,0,We stayed at Ballards last year and they moved us around and kept us on fish. We are going back again this year in 4 weeks. We take our own tackle as well but check with the lodge a few days before leaving to see what color jigs have been working the best. We always take a good selection of colored jigs along. Jigs are all we used last year and did ok in late February.
