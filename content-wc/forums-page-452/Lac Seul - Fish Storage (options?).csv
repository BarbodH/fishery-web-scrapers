1389919,jkonop,2012-02-04 20:10:00,544,"I just learned so new information from JDP today and should have grilled him some more...So you can't keep fish (live fish) in your livewell. Do most of you keep a cooler, or Can you just knock the fish silly on its head, toss it in the livewell and keep pushing cold water through the live well to keep the fish cool/cold? What do you do for all day fish storage, or what is legal ""in the live well""?"
1389927,SinOrSwim,2012-02-04 20:29:00,1528,We fished Lac Seul for the first time last September. Our lodge had coolers for each boat specifically for fish storage. Just filled them with ice before we left and all was well. I don't believe you are supposed to have live fish on any lakes in Ontario. Stringers etc.
1389937,KTroller,2012-02-04 20:48:00,237,"On LS we kill the fish either by snapping their spine or by slitting their throat and then throw in the deadwell and run it occasionally. I have also frozen a 5qt ice cream bucket of water and put that in there if we will be out for a longer time. Helps keep them from spoiling. If you use your livewell instead of putting them on ice in a cooler make sure they are dead, they are very hearty and if you get checked they don't like to see any Lazarus fish.KT"
1389939,Pooch,2012-02-04 21:26:00,4619,"I've heard some stories about fish on Lac Seul being ""not quite"" dead when checked by the Ministry. Snap the neck and line your live well with insulation. Throw in a couple jugs of ice or just use a cooler. Works fine. Not all lakes in Ontario are kill lakes. Lac Seul is the only lake we fish that requires this. Just don't cull. They say that culled fish usually die after release. You will like fishing Lac Seul. Pooch"
1389957,rdbalmer,2012-02-05 00:06:00,279,I always slit their throat and put them in the livewell to bleed out and then put them in a plastic bag on ice in a cooler. It reduces the mess in your cooler and the fish is just as fresh as if it just came out of the water. Personally I wouldn't leave dead fish in 50-70 degree water very long and expect them to be very good table fare. It has worked great for me every since they changed the livewell laws. Rob
1390106,wallydave,2012-02-05 11:13:00,2151,"I have fished LS for many years, our outfitter has a cooler and ice for each boat, that is refreshed each day. Some folks use their live wells for bait. I agree with breaking the spine or using the club that is provided with the cooler and ice. By following the rules we have never had any issues with checks by MNR. They are just doing their jobs to protect the future of the fishing we enjoy!Treat them with respect and they will, most of the time, will treat you with respect too!"
1390162,Thumpr50,2012-02-05 13:54:00,139,"This regulation is specific to Lac Seul to prevent sorting of fish. I bought a reasonably priced small/medium sized chest type cooler and designated it as my fish cooler for Lac Seul. Take a couple of water bottles, quart milk jugs or the like fill them with water & freeze. Put these in the cooler along with some ice when you leave camp in the morning. The fish you catch & kill-break the necks, its the quickest & most certain-will stay nice and fresh. When you kill make sure they are DEAD-wardens have zero tolerance on this; if get checked and any fish you have so much as flops once, you will be fined."
1390968,cuamb,2012-02-07 10:41:00,203,I had a Northern flop in front of the warden one year and he warned me to remember that dead means dead. Did not get a fine. That is probably because he had already fined one in our group for having a fish 1/8 inch inside the slot. Just follow the rules and you will have no issues.
1391191,bigtimeelectric,2012-02-07 19:53:00,174,"I have a Lund Pro v, I fill my front livewell with ice, partly because ice is free when you stay at Gawleys Little Beaver Lodge. Anyway the ice stays all day and we always slit the throat and throw the eyes in the icy livewell. Make sure to put plug in bottom. The fillets are nice and firm and white when you clean em, enjoy"
1391324,Guest,2012-02-08 11:11:00,0,"I think keeping any walleye (dead, stunned or alive) in a livewell full of water is asking for a ticket. Dead or alive it looks like you were trying to keep it alive (thus the term livewell). As another poster pointed out, 70+ degree water is not a good way to keep your quarry. Outfitters gave the same advice. I konk the fish on head and put it in a plastic bag. It then goes into the livewell (bag keep everything clean). A half gallon jug of frozen water is dropped in the livewell each morning. That keeps the fish and nightcrawlers nice and cool. Sometimes I'll also drop in a few frozen bottles of water - good to pullout and drink on a hot afternoon. My livewell has a divider in it, so the cold stuff goes on the small side, and the other side is used for storage."
