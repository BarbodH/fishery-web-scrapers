The first trip my wife caught a 19.5 lb 45"" Pike and I caught a 31.5"" 11 1/2 lb Walleye on the same day. The second trip we caught a 23 1/2 lb 47"" Pike and a 8lb Walleye on the same day. We usually bottom bounce for the Walleye and troll LARGE hooks for the Pike. Here's the pics...and I thought I'd throw in an extra shot of another "" slightly above average Pike"" we caught on the second trip. You've gotta love Tobin Lake!!"

I have been lucky to be able to do that. I have spent 30 years and a lot of windshield time doing that. (Tobin, Columbia River, Last Mountain, Dieffenbaker, Ft Peck, Canyon Ferry, MT) I was lucky to get in on several of these when they were pretty unknown.

We had 3 or 4 days where we caught 5 or 6 fish that size. Interesting, because last year we fished the same 3-dozen-or-so spots and were having trouble finding big fish.

Caught it on a chart. jig with a chart/white twister tail tipped with a minnow.

I was pretty happy when I netted that fish last night and had to say something to guys that would appreciate a fish of that size. I will post a picture of it shortly. Ironically we are known as a trophy smallmouth fishery but I dare say we have some of the biggest walleye in the world. We have now started to see the more serious walleye trophy hunters come up more and more. As we are on a private lake system and have been catch and release for decades the fish, especially the walleye are huge. A 25 inch walleye is not even picture worthy when you can catch 30s with 35 inches and up roaming around. Tight lines. Fisherman Ted"
