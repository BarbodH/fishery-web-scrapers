1282095,BigFunkyE,2011-03-14 06:26:00,1,"Is there a better choice than Nipissing for walleye,pike,and/or bass the week of June 25-July 3 ? We are coming from western PA and would like to keep the drive to apx. 9 hrs.Have been to Rice Lake a few times but usually get skunked on the walleye. Any help deciding would be very much appreciated. Thank you."
1282144,northernbite,2011-03-14 09:02:00,1186,"I think you need to go farther north. You may want to check out Harwood Lake Lodge up towards Timmons or just go to Nip. I've never fished but it is a big lake. Send me a pm with your phone our email and we can talk. There are other places up there you can go. I live in Erie county, Pa.Paul"
1282158,ohiojmj,2011-03-14 09:20:00,1262,"I think I've read some good reports on Horwood on ohiogamefishing.com. Further up route 11, you might look up Temigami (huge lake system, but many camps) and Lady Evelyn. I've been to Red Cedar Lake, about 45 minutes north of North Bay and had some success, but thought I needed a lake with less fishing pressure. In the last two years, I've been going the Georgian Bay and have had some outstanding walleye fishing, when we were targeting them. We've been after pike. Stayed at Key Harbour Lodge. Lotsa water to explore. GB is more about quality than quantity of fish."
1282189,doubleheader,2011-03-14 10:47:00,2652,"BF, I've fished the west arm of Nipissing for nearly 50 years. The bite can be difficult at times, but at times it can be very good. It is definitely not a body of water for those that don't enjoy the hunt, but it can be very rewarding once you figure out a pattern. I've caught as few as 20 walleyes in a week and as many as 100. The lake also holds a nice population of both largemouth and smallmouth, and while most pike are runts 30""+ fish are not that uncommon. The west arm is known for musky, big musky if that's your cup of tea. We now stay at Memquisit Lodge, but spent many vacations at Lakair Lodge. Both lodges have decent websites. Are there better waters?- for sure, but good fishing isn't always measured just by the numbers. BTW, here's a suggestion, Taggart Bay Lodge. I've not stayed there but plan to drive over to see their place during our stay at Memquisit this year. I spoke with these folks at the Harrisburg Outdoor show and I was impressed by the lodge and the lake. They are essentially the only lodge on the lake and each year catch numerous walleyes over 10 lbs. Check out their website. Also, theyhave a cement ramp if you bring your own boat."
1282821,captaincanada56,2011-03-15 19:07:00,17,"BF, if your going to head to Nip, it may be worth your while to check out Lake Nosbonsing. its 20 minutes southeast of north bay. its signifigantly smaller in size than nip, so weather wont be to much of a concern, as nip can be a sometimes dangerous body of water during windy periods. Nosbonsing has a nice variety of species, and not a whole lot of fishing pressure, was there last year in mid july, and and am heading back again in august, PM me if you want more details about cabins, good locations etc."
1282873,Walleyetracker07,2011-03-15 22:05:00,8,"BF,If you are willing to come up to Nipissing, I suggest you try Onaping Lake 45 mins. north of Sudbury. It is a huge lake for an inland lake but very sheltered in most areas. Full of islands, narrows bays and inlets and all kinds of rocky and sandy structures. Lots of Walleye in the 16 to 22 inch range. Well known for big Wallys as well. It is also polluted with Smallmouth, good population of Lakers and decent pike. There are a couple of lodges on the lake (don't know their name) or stay at Halfway Provincial park if you want to rough it or have a trailer to park. Hope this helps you out."
1283285,stillangling,2011-03-17 05:33:00,149,"City of North Bay (100,000 plus people) on the shore, combined with intensive sport and commercial fishery and guess what you come up with? Quick google search will tell the story. The drive may be ugly but the fishing just keeps getting better as you go west. The area west of Thunder Bay to the Manitoba border is in a completely different league. At the very least, get yourself as far west as the Geraldton/Nakina area."
1321494,Legend115,2011-06-22 17:52:00,39,"pop is under 55k. and by ""commercial fishery"", do you mean the natives netting the lake out? alright, i'll buy that. to the original op...on a serious note, i agree with harwood lake lodge - great walleye fishing. however, it it was me and i was travelling the distance you are, i would book a lodge on Lady Evelyn. leaps and bounds above Nipissing any day of the week. there are some real hogs to be caught on that lake..and not overly difficult either. i do see that your trip is in 3 days so if you have booked Nipissing, depending on where you're staying, head straight for wasi falls for the eve fish. get in just out front the small dock in 8fow and let the current push you to 12fow (repeat) use a MINNOW and jig (orange, red or chartreuse)...forget the worms in this spot. they are feeding heavily on minnows in the slow current. two nights ago i out fished three guys in a boat beside me - caught 12 only 2 were keepers. the rest were 3-6lbs. Nosbonsing - great musky action around the sunken island, railway bay (careful of rocks) or in the weed flats by the narrows. walleye are good on the north shore east of Sunnyside Camp (do not stay here - pm for details)good luck."
