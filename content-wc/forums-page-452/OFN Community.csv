1392048,Guest,2012-02-09 17:47:00,0,I tried to register a couple of weeks ago and got no where. No response to my message either....I guess Walleye central it is.....
1392197,Mike Borger,2012-02-10 05:26:00,1554,"The problem as I was told, they're been inundated over the last few months with upwards of 200 bogus accounts a day.Most come from overseas but some use a proxy to appear as though they're in the States, so sometimes a genuine ""new member"" gets deleted, they're on a policy of ""if it looks suspicious, delete.""If they keep trying to register an account that also flags it as potential ""spam bot,"" so it's hard to know who to let in these days. Not sure how kosher it is to post this on another site, but any WC members can pm me with whatever username they want register with on OFN and I'll pass it along.Cheers"

1392221,Pikehunters,2012-02-10 06:42:00,100,It took me over a week to be able to reply or post. It's another good source of info. Just want the bang for my buck
