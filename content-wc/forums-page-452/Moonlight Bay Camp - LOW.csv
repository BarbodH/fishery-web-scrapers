1389586,bafr,2012-02-03 21:31:00,2,Looking for a smaller resort on LOW. Has anyone used Moonlight Bay Camp?
1389666,champ8,2012-02-04 08:56:00,40,Stayed there a couple of years ago. Mike offers a great package deal with the american plan plus guide for a reasonable price. The resort and cabins are very clean and the shore lunches were fantastic. We're doing housekeeping plan now at mylies. Can't go wrong at either place.
