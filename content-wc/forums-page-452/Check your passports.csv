1388017,J-Man,2012-01-31 08:29:00,191,"Great advice for all, Pikeslayer. I had to renew my own last month; just waiting for it to arrive in the mail now. We only get 5 years out of ours up here for $87.While they are checking passports, it wouldnt hurt to make sure the outdoors card for ontario is in the same place so you dont get stuck paying for another when you arrive at your Ontario destination. They can be replaced for free if you find them missing ahead of time and allow for one to be sent via mail."

Taking care of the legal items are best done well ahead of time! Passport, outdoors cards, reservations, deposits, and even licenses, can be addressed well ahead of time. Like Santa, make a list and check it twice!Passport and outdoors card, check, deposits and reservations check, next on the list, fishing license, drool over last years pictures, keep checking WC until the countdown is hours, not days and weeks!"

1388237,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-31 17:36:00,1460,"Justin,Yeah, since my boys were minors when they got their first passports, we could not renew online so I had to set an appointment and just got them passport cards but it was still a bit pricy, at least they are good for 10 years. I've made the mistake of leaving my sportsman cards home before, so I now keep them in my passport, in my safe. Good call. Quote: Originally Posted by wallydaveThanks Pikeslayer!

1388310,lakerbreaker,2012-01-31 20:48:00,253,We had a situation where we were headed to Ontario ice fishing a few weeks ago and a buddy realized his passport had just expired in December. After LOTS of digging it was discovered that all he needed was an expired passport and a birth certificate to be legal..We handed the border guy all of our passports including the expired one and he didn't say a thing....Needless to say he was sweating bullets the whole time thinking about it though....
1393187,lakerbreaker,2012-02-12 08:17:00,253,"I guess my wording wasn't quite right-I know the passport ""requirement"" is for getting back into the US on land-Canada doesn't require one-The US officers HAVE to let you back into the US if you are a US citizen-proving it is obviously the point and the documents I listed are ""accepted"" forms of ID-There is obviously a lot of confusion about this subject out there-"
