1390258,Crede,2012-02-05 17:54:00,134,"We have done that drive many times. Our usual routine is to fill up in Sault Ste. Marie, MI (I-75 Business Loop - 2nd to last exit). Several 24 hour stations with diesel. Fill up again in White River, ON. 200 miles from SSM. Good time for a quick leg stretch + Albert and Son's Husky (807) 822-2441 open 24 hours and has diesel. White River thru Hornepayne thru Geraldton to Nakina approx. 260 miles. We don't usually take the shortcut out of Longlac to Nakina. Can get gas in Nakina in Pennock's during the day if you want. Stations in Longlac and Dan's General Store (807) 854-0600 south of Nakina open 6A-10P."
1390317,Opti-Mist,2012-02-05 19:33:00,1402,"Most stations in Soo, Mich are open 24/7."
1390907,sault eyes,2012-02-07 08:42:00,268,The Husky in White River is open 24 hours and the Esso is not. Wawa has a pay at the pump that I believe is open 24 hours. I don't usually go there because it eliminates employees. You can make it from here (Sault) to White river on a full tank. I have done it alot even when towing with a camper and a fuel hungry truck.Jason Doyon
1392455,tight line,2012-02-10 13:41:00,37,Thanks for the help fellows.I did call the Husky in White River they are open 24 hrs.
1392979,lenray,2012-02-11 18:38:00,467,In many trips---WHITE RIVER has always been open.
1389970,tight line,2012-02-05 05:37:00,37,"We are heading to Nakina in june.We plan on crossing the boarder and fueling up at Sault Ste Marie around 12 midnight to 1 am.On rt.17 and 631 will filling stations be open in Wawa,White River, or Hornepayne early in the morning?"
1389976,TIGHTLINER,2012-02-05 05:58:00,223,Yes we went thru there early and wawa was open don't remember about white river because we had fuel topped off in geralton on the way to nakina. Maybe i was asleep when we went thru white river.
1389977,"6'3""",2012-02-05 05:59:00,47,We asked last summer while in White River and they said they were open 24 hrs.
1389978,Mike Borger,2012-02-05 06:01:00,1554,"Pretty sure there's one in White River open 24 hours. Wawa is doubtful. Hornepayne is definitely not open 24 hours but may be open by the time you drive through...or not LOL!Back in the day when I'd drive through the night to reach Quetico park west of Thunder Bay we had to bring jerry cans of gas as nothing was open.Ran out at 2am just west of Terrace Bay the first time, never again.Regardless of what anyone says you'd best track down the appropriate phone numbers call and find out for sure."
1389990,515,2012-02-05 06:44:00,254,"We never count on anything being open anymore, we always carry 5 gals of gas just in case. We stopped driving at night for the most part because of it."
1389992,onetimedave,2012-02-05 06:47:00,502,You should be OK in White River and then fill up in Long Lac. What lake are you going to?
1390040,oleJoe,2012-02-05 08:43:00,114,"Fill up at the last exit before entering canada and then top off in Long Lac. When coming back , Top off in Long Lac and you should make it back to the states. One thing to consider coming back is how long you will wait to get back into the states. Most times 10 min. but have had to sit there an hour also."
1390116,dog2,2012-02-05 11:45:00,198,"One of the first things to consider what is the fuel range of your vehicle? Then figure on mileage between fuel stops,here are some mileages from my logs from Sault Ste. Marie,Mich. to Wawa 145 miles 3hrs.;to White River 203 miles 4hr:35min:, Hornepayne 265miles 6 hrs.;Longlac458 miles ;Nakina 515miles 12:30 min . ther are truck stops at Wawa ,White River open 24 hrs. station @Hornpayne daylight hours only Longlac was 24 hrs in 2011. All have diesel. There was an open outfitter at Klotz lake that was selling gas only. Don,t know hours of service stations at ST.marie,Mich but there were 4 or 5 there."
1390167,tight line,2012-02-05 14:15:00,37,We are going to Beteau lake on the Attawapiskat river.
