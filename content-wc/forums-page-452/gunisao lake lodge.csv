Any help on this would be appreciated."
1229234,Bigfishhunter,2010-08-20 06:51:00,803,"I have worked in the lodge industry for a long time now, and can tell you that Budds in one of the premier Walleye destinations. They are pretty hard to beat. They also have great service and accomodations. I think you would really enjoy yourself there. I have clients that go to a variety of lodges cycling through their favorite 5 or so and make two trips a year. I get the skinny from them on what places are like and they tell me what other places are doing that we could do better. Shop around and ask around. Always ask to see references and contact them. Places like Walleye central are great for info."
1229348,2746,2010-08-20 14:05:00,3206,"You will love it and yes I'd go back. Only problem is it's kind of a ""once in a lifetime trip"" for me so probably won't be there again. If there is a better walleye lake than the one you live on it might be this one. Living on Gullrock I can see why you not have been to a lodge.....no need to. Anything less than Gunisao would be a disappointment. Enjoy!"

1229662,Golden Eagle,2010-08-22 11:02:00,2642,"Tackleman, I'd rather spend a week with you on one of your best lakes than go a week with Babe on Gunisao. I think you have it pretty good in your back yard."
