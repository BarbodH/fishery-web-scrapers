1389904,stillangling,2012-02-04 19:39:00,149,No native brook trout in that drainage system. There is a small creek at the very south end of the lake that has brook trout but a 6 incher is about all you could expect. Tag alder lined creek that is no more than 2' wide. It is an introduced population. There are some very good stocked brook trout lakes just south of Sturgeon off of highway 599. If you want river fishing with big fish you need to go further north into the Albany drainage and that is a fair way north of Sturgeon Lake.
