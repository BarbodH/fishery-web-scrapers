1323556,Seanik,2011-06-28 08:45:00,218,"This will be our 2nd year at Expeditions North, we will be in cabin 5 July 8-15. It's about a 16 hr drive from Erie, pa but well worth it. We didn't want to stay at White River the night before the flight because of the 1 hr drive. We booked at Uncles cabins on hwy 631 near Hornepayne, they also have a restuarant that opens early according to the person I talked to on the phone. We would appreciate any feedback on Uncles cabins. Seanik"
1323936,buckeyedan,2011-06-29 07:52:00,44,"I know that we had a couple options for lodging, (but we decided to try the ""drive through the night"" plan this year. We have always talked about doing it...and this gave us the reason. I get to be home a little longer with the family before I leave, and we get to save a little money on hotel, food and drinks the night before we fly in. I am concerned about wildlife, and am also a little concerned about crossing into Canada on ""Canada Day night"" and the traffic through lower Michigan since this is the weekend of the 4th...hope the delays aren't bad. I guess we will see...T-minus 69 hours, 12 minutes from right now..."
1328084,buckeyedan,2011-07-10 16:41:00,44,"Got back last night from a week at Walton's Kay-Vee Lodge on Nagagami Lake. Fishing was a little tough starting out until we found them...turns out they had a really cold spring and everything seemed to be pushed back a couple weeks. The fish weren't in their usual spots for this week, but after a little scouting on the first day we were able to dial in on some really nice walleyes. Biggest of the week was 28"", with many others in the 22-28"" range. The numbers were a little below what we had 2 years ago on my last trip, but that was made up for the incredible size of the fish. This was the biggest overall size that I have ever seen in my 11 times at Nagagami. The weather was warm/hot and sunny for most of the week, which made the fishing that much more challenging, but once we found the fish we were able to eat fish at pretty much every meal if we wanted. The accommodations were great as usual at Kay-Vee Lodge. I know a lot of people on this site consider Expeditions North to be the best camp on the lake, and I'm sure they run a fine camp...but Rob and Donna Walton run a first rate operation as well. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great, affordable, well-run fly-in camp."
1328121,Redear,2011-07-10 18:48:00,40,"Back from are trip last week weather was real hot all week till thursday.had trouble finding fish in the same places as last year.water temp was still behind mabey 2 weeks.When we found them the wind would blow in white caps from a different direction and shut down the bite.Had a bad mayfly hatch on are end of the lake that didn't help are fishing any either.Found fishing in the 3to 6 fow hitting worms and some minnows .some on the points in 15 to 20 fow also.we ate fish every day and had a great time with the grand kids .25.5 was are bigest walleye this yr.I asked some of the Kv guys fishing in deep bay about you Buckeyedan but never got to talk to you.We got checked frist hill out side of Hornpayne by the mnn an cpp my boy got a $250 ticket for no seat belt,he had just laid down in the back of our van to seep to White River.No warning from them boys,no seat belts on 250 each.I guess the 7000 we spent up there didn't help there economy enough.Fred"
1329771,buckeyedan,2011-07-14 09:39:00,44,"Guess I didn't make the connection that we were going to be up there at the same time, RedEar...would have liked to introduce myself in person. Our stories sound largely the same...the wind never fails to amaze me up there. You can head out on the lake with the wind blowing from the SE, and by the time you get to your spot it might be out of the NW or even N. We caught most of our fish just outside of Deep Bay...there is a cove between the rocks at the entrance to Deep Bay and Chuck's point. We cought a LOT of fish in there. Our usual ""go to"" spot is in the Meadows/Flats, but we had very little luck there until the second half of the week. If I'm not mistaken, you flew out on Friday morning if you were at Ex. North. We didn't have any trouble at all with the MNR or the OPP, thankfully....although we did run into a serious accident on 17 south of Wawa that we easily could have been involved in. I am planning on going up again next year same week. If you are there we will have to try to meet up and introduce ourselves..."

1330665,tooski,2011-07-17 08:57:00,393,"Redear, Hear what you are saying re: money spent but if fining results in more people wearing belts then I am all in.. Take it from someone who spent three days in Geraldton hospital after a moose encounter and no seat belt. I was also napping in the rear of the van."
1331004,Seanik,2011-07-18 08:51:00,218,"Just returned from our 2nd year at Expeditions North Lodge. As stated previously, best accommodations and service at a fishing lodge we ever had in over 30 years of Canada trips. There was a tremendious Mayfly hatch while we were there and needless to say the numbers of walleyes caught was down from last year. Most of the fish caught had stomachs full of Mayflies. The hatch was slowing down on our last day and the numbers caught improved. We definitely will return in 2012 Seanik"

1313989,mroyle,2011-06-02 14:59:00,74,Looking for a 3-4 day trip within 12 hours of Cleveland. Any input on Nagagami fishing in July? Would greatly appreciate any input.
1314040,Redear,2011-06-02 18:13:00,40,"Do a serach on this form and you will see my posts an others wih lots of good information.We went last yr and going in July again this yr.Expeditions North Lodge is were we stayed and couldn't have been more satisfied every thing boats ,motors .cabin ,fishing all 100%www.expeditions-north.com they have 4 day trips but for what it cost to fly in stay all 7 days. i live in Canton oh and its 14hr to Hornepayne ontaatio.Tell Dave Fred sent you."
1314202,Stehle1,2011-06-03 07:46:00,22,"We switched camps last year to Expeditions North after going with a camp in Northwest Ontario for 20 years (24 hour drive compared to 12 from Ft. Wayne, Indiana). It more than exceeded our expectations. Big fish and lots of them. The biggest problem was finding fish under 18"". The camp at Expeditions North is awesome. The owner, David, really keeps the place looking great and all of the equipment is top notch. I fealt spoiled with the amenities compared to our previous camp."
1322945,buckeyedan,2011-06-26 19:20:00,44,"I can't say enough good things about this Lake. I have been going there for 20+ years and it just seems to get better every year. Two of the lodges on the Lake went defunct a few years ago and are still trying to recover. The lack of fishing pressure along with the slot limit in Ontario has resulted in an explosion of beautiful 18-26 inch walleye. Was there two years ago and I have never seen anything like it. The size and number of fish was flat out amazing. We stay at Walton's Kay-Vee lodge and they are a first rate operation. Used to stay at Nagagami Lodge before the original owner sold it and it went downhill. I have heard good things about the new ownership, but the Waltons have been good to us, so I don't really want to leave their place. I am actually headed up there next week and can't wait...been counting the days since the beginning of June. This lake is a hidden gem...highly recommended."
1322974,Mich_Fisherman,2011-06-26 20:51:00,292,"Spent a week starting Friday June 10th at Expeditions North on Nagagami. As we got off of the plane the outgoing fishermen said that they had a tough week. We indeed also had a tough week. The weather was cold when we got there...by midweek it was in the mid to high 80's and very little wind. When I say a bad week, that is in comparison to previous years. The four of us caught around 400 eyes...with smaller fish than usual. Everything seemed behind a couple of weeks. The biggest fish this year was 28"" with some 27""and 26 inchers thrown in. It was still great to be there and we had fish every night. All and all, the week was great. David Zuhl and Expeditions North were better than ever. Chopped and stacked wood for those cold days. The sauna stoked up every day. A fish fry mid week with the entire camp on Tuesday. Accommodations were top notch, again. David also has some new 17hp four stroke engines on the Lunds and Nadens that push you along quite nicely and some color Eagle fishfinders (AWESOME!!). Cant wait until next year....or maybe one more time this year. Nagagami is a hidden gem."
1323021,buckeyedan,2011-06-27 06:07:00,44,"It might not have been the best for you, but I am excited to hear that things seem to be a couple weeks behind at Nagagami. 2009 was also a cold spring and we had the best fishing I can remember. We are usually there the first week of July, which sometimes is a little late. The prime weeks seem to be the last two weeks of June most years. 400 fish is still nothing to sneeze at. This lake has a tendency to spoil a person, though. We have had days where one person can catch 75-100 walleye by himself. The only change to this year's trip for us was not being able to stay in Hornepayne due to the closing of the Centre Inn...so we decided to drive through the night. Not sure how that will work out...hopefully the Centre Inn can re-open, or another hotel can take it's place in the future."

I have been going there since I was a young boy...been a family tradition. (Didn't go last year due to having a child and moving.) Let me know if you are interested...I would be happy to share...
1323503,mroyle,2011-06-28 06:26:00,74,Many thanks---will definitely take you up on your offer as next summer approaches. We usually make our trips in July so will contact you before then.
