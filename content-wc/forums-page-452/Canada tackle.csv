1391119,Angwalleye,2012-02-07 18:00:00,27,Wanting to know what rods reels line and lures you guys would take to Canada. Will be fishing for walleye pike and lake trout. Any help or advice would be appreciated.
1391137,Obabikon,2012-02-07 18:31:00,2370,"For walleyes and lakers, I'd be looking at a 6' medium heavy rod with 20lb braided line. If you don't like braided, 6-8LB mono is very close. Then a 6'6"" bait casting rod with 60LB braided for the pikes. 1/4oz and 3/8oz jigs of all colors inline spinners like giant killers and then some single hook tandums. All shapes and sizes. Not really sure what you like for Lakers, but some type of heavy spoon."

Checkout a few web-sites of outfitters, many times they will have lists of what to pack, and what kind of tackle to use. The time of year will have some impact on what lures to use. Lakers are shallow in spring, but they move into deeper cooler waters later in the summer.Checking here will also help with what gear to pack. Which lake and what time of year will help in getting info from WC!"

1391360,wallydave,2012-02-08 12:17:00,2151,"I have fished Ontario, so I have no info for Sas. I would guess that time of year the lakers might still be shallow, but it also depends on the ice-out. Check with the outfitter, adn keep posting here. Did you check the search finction at the top of the page? You might find some info there. I am guessing that most of the posters here fish Ontario, so good luck on your trip! Let us know how it went!"

1391528,Pikehunters,2012-02-08 17:32:00,100,"Make sure spinner baits are titanium bodys. The pike up there will destroy regular .99 cent chepo's lots of replacement skirts, trailor hooks, blades & steel leaders. Double check your swivels after every fish, boy does it piss me off to cast & watch my lure keep on going & going & going. Keep an eye on your line for fraying above the leader if it feels like sand paper strip 3 or 4yds off & tie new leader on. Just a few little things that will help get the big ones in the boat & MOST IMPORTANT HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!"
