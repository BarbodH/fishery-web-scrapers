1392210,wallydave,2012-02-10 06:23:00,2151,"I like to wear camo while fishing, I like to say I am sneaking up on the fish, but mostly I wear camo, because if and when you get blood and slime on you, the camo ""hides"" the stains! I usually hit the end of the season clearance sales, and keep my jeans free from slime and blood!Under the camo I will wear a brightly colored t-shirt, in case I need to try to get attention if a safety situation comes up!"
1392216,Pikehunters,2012-02-10 06:39:00,100,Some good info there. Those big pike can be quite the slimy creatures!!
1390973,Pikehunters,2012-02-07 10:47:00,100,http://www.fishouflageapparel.com/ Has anyone seen this web site or purchased from them before. 2 of the guys in our group where full camo every day & yes underware & socks to boot. Might get some of this just to compete. The walleyeflage looks neat!!

1391268,baraboobob,2012-02-08 08:53:00,4,It is in some sporting good stores Lakeland and plano make tackle boxes I think truck wraps will be avialable soon maybe boat wraps my nephew worked fishing trade shows and a lot of people wore hunting camo so he came up with fishouflage

1391826,Bill Krejca,2012-02-09 11:13:00,6107,"Wearing ""woodsy"" camo or non-bright clothes to fish in always made a lot of sense to me. I used to bow and arrow hunt carp, and noticed brighter colored clothes tended to scare any shallow residing fish. I was able to get closer wearing non-bright neutral colored clothing. Another school of thought is to wear colors that match the sky, i.e., blue and white, rather than normal camo, etc., however I subscribe to the woodsy camo approach for most all kinds of fishing. For deep water fishing, maybe it is not as important, except when trying to net a fish. I have experimented with moving fast with bright clothing on during the netting process, and feel the fish will adversely react (struggle more) to the movement, more than with a neutral colored jacket, etc. For the above reasons, I never wear bright clothes while fishing. I realize this opinion is not shared by a number of TV hosts, as camo seemingly tends to wash out on the screen while bright oranges and yellows tend to accentuate the camera's subject. At least this has long been my opinion. Bill"

1391917,Pikehunters,2012-02-09 13:18:00,100,"I always wear blue, grey or dark green depending on the day & agree 100% with ya Bill. I guess my ? really is has anyone orderd from them & what is the quality of the clothing. Bought alot of shiiatty clothing that a 6 year old could wear after 1 or 2 washes The print looks cool, i like the walleye pattern the best."
1391970,Babamel2,2012-02-09 14:36:00,414,"Ever since I started wearing it the number and size of the walleyes I catch has increase significantly. But the real kicker was the day I caught one dressed in chamo. complete with face makeup,"
1392136,djarz929,2012-02-09 20:57:00,40,Bought a long sleeve T - 2 washes and the seams started splitting and the pocket started coming off
