1390643,Pikehunters,2012-02-06 16:18:00,100,WallyDave i seen you mention picking up dry ice in another post. We allways talk about trying it but never have. Chop up block ice to use in coolers & save the fridge for cold evening lybations after the long day of haulin the catch. Any info???
1390837,wallydave,2012-02-07 05:38:00,2151,"We usually use dry ice to keep our take home fish good and cold for the 16 hr drive home. Our camp , Goose Bay, provides ice and coolers to keep the daily catch cold until we get back to the fish house. Dry ice might be overkill for keeping your beverages cold! Does your outfitter have ice available, would be the next question?"

Definitely don't want it near your beverages, will freeze them quickly. Two years ago had one of our guys (a marine, no offense Pieske) put it over the crawlers. Quite the mess....."
1390876,Pikehunters,2012-02-07 07:28:00,100,"We use block ice instead of cubed. Last alot longer, just use a hatchet & chop as needed. We buy our dinners from a local butcher who deep freezes the steaks, ribs, chops, chicken that we cook on a open fire. ( oh my back on the itch thread ) Any way we keep all of that in a 5 day cooler to save on fridge space.Thought was to save on weight with dry ice compared to block ice ?"

1391109,jiggster,2012-02-07 17:17:00,183,When fishing Manitoba I used a method I learned many years ago. Make a layer of ice on wood slates. Then put food or fillets with a layer of rock salt on top( type use in making ice cream). Keep repeating. This becomes a freezer. I put the fish fillets in mine and a few days later when I got home in Minnesota everything was frozen solid.
