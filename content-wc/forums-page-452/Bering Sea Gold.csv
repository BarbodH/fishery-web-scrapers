Nome Alaska is one of the last wild frontiers. Deckhands getting stabbed in barfights and roughnecks playing break a strap with their pickups, hilarious! These dredges are cobbled together with gum and duct tape and the big floating wash plant had no propulsion. They had to use the excavator to row themselves to and fro. Looks like they made enough last week to fix their thrusters.At least they are finding gold......some of them."

1392665,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-10 21:49:00,1460,"As tough as Nome is, bet they were a bit grouchy with no gas for much of this winter."

Maybe if you're on a vessel that even Tom Sawyer wouldn't set foot on. It looked like the average walleye chop to me - there wasn't even a whitecap in sight!I'm just waiting to see one of those Rube Goldberg barges go to the bottom. (As long as no one gets hurt, of course.)"
