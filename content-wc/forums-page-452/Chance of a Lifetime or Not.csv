1391429,Bill Krejca,2012-02-08 14:28:00,6107,"If the lake has been free of fishermen and commercial fishing for that long, the fishing should be just short of outstanding. Some of these ""comeback"" lakes regenerate themselves, both in quantity and quality. Bill"
1391438,wallydave,2012-02-08 14:46:00,2151,"To follow up with Bill, the only way to know for sure is to try it out! A dry line, has never caught a fish!"
1391521,Pikehunters,2012-02-08 17:18:00,100,My line will be dry till Aug 4th. Talked to the outfiter today about updates as the cabin is built. Hope they follow thru & will post pics of cabin as it is built. Should be interesting.
1391695,wallydave,2012-02-09 07:22:00,2151,"Thats a looong wait! They will have some good weather for working on the cabin! Plenty of time to prepare for your trip! Countdown check list, outdoors cards, passports, licesences, ect, ect..."
1391929,Pikehunters,2012-02-09 13:35:00,100,Don't forget the weekly group fish meetings . I hope beer prices don't go up like fuel cost!!!
1391959,wallydave,2012-02-09 14:21:00,2151,"People just don't know how much ""work"" goes into planning a fishing trip!!"
1389593,NARDA 1,2012-02-03 22:57:00,636,Go for it. I doubt that the outfitter/owner would make the investment in time and money of putting a cabin on the lake without knowing that the lake would produce. Have a great time!!!
1389615,Pikehunters,2012-02-04 05:54:00,100,I looked at the moon phase but conflicting dates within the group wont let us leave until the 3rd. I've fished 1st of July Aug & Sept never Opener. Get a good winter ( I Plow Snow ) ( No Snow ) in Erie again might plan two trips in a year & try the opener & closer!!

1389684,Pikehunters,2012-02-04 09:33:00,100,"Love that avg for erie recorded at the airport which is 1/2 mile from the lake. Go 5 miles south, (1-90) & the average is 220"" The snow belt is a belt not to be reconned with, when it snows which IT""S NOT. Going to put the plow away & get the motorcycle out for a put."

1389759,Larry Mac,2012-02-04 12:49:00,530,"Hi Pikehunters, I believe you have before you an opportunity of a lifetime. I am excited just reading about your opportunity LOL. Have a great tripThank you,Larry Mac"
1389794,tooski,2012-02-04 14:17:00,393,"Hey Bluff, I think the Google results were for 50,000 and over population. Not that I would argue with an Orlando resident about snowfall though."
1389859,SinOrSwim,2012-02-04 17:36:00,1528,Why would they not fly in and fish the lake to see if it has good fishing prior to building a cabin? Just curious.
1389979,Pikehunters,2012-02-05 06:06:00,100,"The lake is on a chain connected by streams & rivers, however not navigatable, from other lakes. This should feed a lake with bait fish & game fish. Outfitter has tested the waters & sent past pics of eye's & pike. The lake has had no pressure of weeks on end getting pounded with anglers. I'm sure the crew building the cabin will also be spending some time on the water & be able to give some insight upon arrival, all work no play thing! but still clasify as virgin waters. Like Narda1 posted I doubt he will invest the $$ & get negative feed back, we all know how that can spread thru forums."
1390193,Bluff,2012-02-05 15:16:00,152,Didn't catch the 50K population minimum. Just moved down here a few months ago from Wisconsin - used to snowmobile a lot in northern WI and the UP. That's why it came to mind. Really not much snow this year though.
1389164,Pikehunters,2012-02-03 06:39:00,100,"Outfitter is offering our group first in on a lake that has not been fished for 20 years. Building a cabin this year. Lake is N of Fraserdale. Google shows its a lake that is on a chain of lakes that has reports of quality walleye's 25"" + & abundant 40"" pike. No info on depth or structure of lake. has streams & river to fish along with lake. 50 ~ 50 shot im my book could be chalked full or dried up. Anyone adventured or GAMBLED like this before??"
1389171,Mike Borger,2012-02-03 07:09:00,1554,"I say go for it. Highly unlikely it's dried up, much more likely the fishing is amazing. Last year Eddienorth out of Nakina built a cabin on a brand new lake and opened it up for the first time. Even he didn't know what the fishing would be like LOL! No surprise it turned out to be a walleye factory."
1389200,wallydave,2012-02-03 07:58:00,2151,"This sounds like a dream come true! From my surfing of outpost website, just my way of dealing with the ""itch"" it is common for outfitters to let a lake ""rest"" for a season or two, but 20 years! Wow, just the chance to be one of the first to try some rested waters sounds like a trip not to miss! If you decide to go, share some pics and a report when you get back!"
1389201,HeHooksHimself,2012-02-03 07:59:00,725,"I would go for it. Like a fishing song we listen to on the way up says..""The important thing about fishing ain't the fish but the fishing............if the fish don't bite you still have the trees and the rocks and the sky."" How bad could it be?"
1389228,Golden Eagle,2012-02-03 08:48:00,2642,"I suggest going in a week early to fish pike before your second week of both pike and walleye fishing. No fishing pressure for 20 years and all that moving water. What a great combination. Get off the computer and call the outfitter. Maybe book 2013 before you head home from May 2012 trip.February 1984 an outfitter got my young daughter on the phone with a message for me that he had something I'd like. A cabin was available for the walleye opener. May 19, 2012 will make 28 straight walleye openers for me on the same lake. I usually go in a week early for pike and have stayed as long as 3 weeks in May. It's a time of change and I don't want it to happen without me."
1389335,Pikehunters,2012-02-03 12:09:00,100,"Long way to go. Outfitter needs to build a cabin, it won't be ready until Aug 1st. Hope to be there Aug 4th.However 3 weeks in the bush would be a dream come true"
1389345,Guest,2012-02-03 12:27:00,0,"Go for it. Our best fly in (out of 15+ trips) was like that. It was the first year a cabin has been on the lake. Wow - the pike were huge and numerous. Walleye were suicidal. We returned a couple of more times  fishing was still great but not like the virgin year. We also had to deal with a couple of bears that were not used to people being around. They added to the adventure. I'm assuming your outfitter knows what he is doing. He probably has had his eye on that lake for a while and has confirmed it supports good wally & pike populations by dropping in and fishing it a few times. Assuming it it's a good fishery, the lack of recent pressure is a plus. While any Canadian fly-in lake will have limited fishing pressure  this is even better especially for the big girls."
1389361,LOW1,2012-02-03 12:58:00,2828,Your choices are to either do it or spend the rest of your life wishing you had.
1389518,Pikehunters,2012-02-03 18:01:00,100,"The adventure alone is the big drive, no imput on fishing there is no rock pile or ledge to the North of camp. Go find it & get'r done, you think you have an itch. Going to be a long long summer & will give report for sure. Thanks all for your imput it's what makes this site great!!"
1389550,Golden Eagle,2012-02-03 20:13:00,2642,"Going in Saturday, July 28 gives you a full moon Wednesday. Maybe by Thursday your guys will let you know they want to return for the May 2013 opener. Would be a good time to lock in the date."
