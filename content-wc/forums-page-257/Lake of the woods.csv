The first couple of days were a little slow but the next few days were pretty dang good. We caught several walleye over 20"" in little traverse Caught a few crappie most around the 12"" range. Me and my nephew caught over 400 walleye with over 50 that were over 20"". We didn't fish very many hours a day cause he couldn't handle the hot sun cause he already had a sunburn. We had 7 guys in our group this year and everyone said it was the funnest trip we've had in Canada."
4153593,birddogger,2015-08-23 19:40:00,43,Good report ftfarms. Sounds like a great trip despite the hot weather. I'll be up in that area in late September and I hope they're still biting as well as they did for you.
