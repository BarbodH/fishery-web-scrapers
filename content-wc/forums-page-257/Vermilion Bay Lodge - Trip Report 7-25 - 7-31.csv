4113945,pjshorthorn,2015-08-09 12:55:00,5654,"Well, with much cogitation and contemplation about our adventure at Vermilion Bay Lodge it is time to get the trip report out for everyone to enjoy. The adventure started with a leisurely trip northward where my father, son and I met up at the Minneapolis airport and headed towards Breezy Point's home in the Northern Minnesota woods. Breezy Point and Mrs. Breezy Point graciously opened their home to us for a very nice visit prior to invading Vermilion Bay Lodge on Saturday the 25th. We were treated as if we had been friends for many many years......what a special start to a great week that lay ahead of us. While in Breezy Point on Friday we made last minute preparations with buying perishables, packing the gear and squeezing a trip in to a local reproduction taxidermist in Brainerd.........Fiber Tech Productions. Mike at Fiber Tech took well over an hour to show us around his entire operation and offered great suggestions on a mount that would accurately reflect the 44"" northern I caught last year on Red lake in Ontario. I'm going to pull the trigger on that mount so stayed tuned for more info when I get the details worked out with Mike. His service attitude and realistic mounts sold me compared to others I had researched. Saturday morning we pulled out of Breezy Point and made tracks for International Falls through the backwoods of Minnesota. What a beautiful drive with nary a car in front of us all the way to the border. Then it happened...............what the heck is going on ?????? We get in line that is about 1.5 to 2 miles long to cross the border into the promised land of fishing heaven. As I'm pulling up to the end of the line, there was an officer keeping things in order and I rolled down the window....."" How long a wait?"". ""Well, sir we estimate it to be 90 minutes "". I'm thinking it would be more like 2+ hours . By this time Breezy Point ( BP) is out of his truck hugging a gal in the middle of the street and I'm thinking, WTF is going on.... .....this isn't a block party here. For the betterment of our group's short term temperament we decided to head to Baudette to cross the border. So did the gal BP was hugging on.......turns out they knew each other from many years of fishing out of Red Wing Lodge in Morson.... Off we go to Baudette which was about 100 miles out of our way, but we crossed with not one car in front of us....Nice!!!. Rolled into Vermilion Bay Lodge around 5 pm with Gord waiting on us with an entourage of greeters. His first comment was, "" you don't look anything like I expected"". Who would have expected a 6'-6 1/2"" sasquatch looking dude pile out of a Smart car wearing yoga shorts with rod cases sticking out of both windows? Breezy Point was pulling his boat so he at least looked like a fisherman. And the adventure began....... The weather over the course of the week was fairly variable with temps in the low 90s with high bluebird skies the first two days then dropping into the low to mid 70s with good blows up to 20-30 miles per hour at times during the remainder of the week. We had quite a bit of rain from Monday through Friday. Water temps ranged from 78 at the beginning of the week down to 74 degrees by week's end. It took us a little while to get acclimated to the lake the first two days as it was our first trip on Eagle Lake. We did manage some nice fish with my Dad ( 75 years young) catching his first ever muskie....34 1/2"" on our first full day of fishing. It was a fish that made his trip and mine as well as we were in the boat together. Thankfully BP is an accomplished muskie fisherman and was able to help us with reviving the fish and many other tips that us rookies needed. It was ironic as BP and my son were actually muskie fishing and Dad and I were just trolling cranks for walleye or northerns. Later that evening BP and I threw his secret homemade buzzbaits in a back bay as dusk fell. We had 7 northerns in the boat ( nothing big) within 15-20 minutes......crazy fast fishing and then the bite shut down just as quick. The next day we got some good intel from Gord on a place to catch jumbo perch. We took about an 8 mile run from camp to get to a creek that led into a remote lake. By our surprise, we were presented with a beaver dam and floating bog blocking the creek channel so we made a command decision to jump the bog and beaver dam.....that didn't go so well but we pushed and grunted our way through. Fishing was pretty spartan in the lake but we did manage some nice size perch and a few eater walleye. Right as we get to the lake we had a good blow with rain and found the bite to be in 5 fow off a rock and weed structure. I wouldn't trade that adventure for anything......I'm thinking BP might not Tuesday through Friday we targeted walleye with some time dedicated to muskie hunting. Eventually we found some good walleye grounds with suggestions from Gord and other camp members. We had no trouble catching eaters for a couple of dinners and our best walleyes were 26 1/2"" and 27 1/2"". Most all of the walleye were caught in the 15- 18 fow range when there was a good blow with fish also staged on mid-lake humps in 20 -25 fow. We had a lot of rain during this part of the week and it definitely was an early morning bite ( 6 am - 8am/9am ish) and then again in the evening. Crawlers were the bait of choice pulled on homemade spinner rigs I tied up for the trip. I personally did not catch a fish on a crank or jig the entire week. Spinners were working well enough that I never changed much throughout the week. We never intended to catch 100s a fish a day on this trip so we explored, slept in if we wanted to, enjoyed a mid day break with a good meal, goofed on Gord when we could because he deserves it; and had a great time talking to the rest of the groups in camp to see how their days panned out. Vermilion Bay Lodge is a smaller camp with 8 very nice cabins that are very well maintained. Our cabin had a brand new tin roof installed on it this year with a knotty pine ceiling and insulation which was much appreciated during the warmer days. We had all of the amenities in the cabin a person needed to cook great meals, full bathroom with shower, single beds with pillows / linens and a Hudson Bay wool blanket that came in handy on the cooler nights during the week. The cabins were spotless and towels were changed out a couple of times during the week with garbage cans policed each day. The lodge itself is a very nice gathering place decorated with vintage motors, cook stoves, fish mounts and quite a number of paintings from past and present guests who are quite good artists. The lodge hosts quite an extensive fish fry on Sunday nights and it was by far the best one I've ever attended in terms of the amount of food choices available for each guest. Wifi is available in the lodge and I was able to send an email to all of the girls back home to give them an idea of how the trip was going. I made some beer bottle cap fishing lures for Gord as a gag gift and he turned it into a fishing tournament for the camp...each cabin allotted one lure and the person with the largest northern , walleye or muskie would get a "" fabulous"" gift from the lodge. The grounds around camp are well kept and I had to chuckle a little bit when I saw Gord in his tye dyed T-shirt and pink slippers on the John Deere mowing one morning. To each their own, eh ? The camp boat equipment....top notch. 16 ft Alumarine boats with padded swivel seats, 25 HP Yamaha motors with depth finders. I opted to reserve one of the upgrade boats so we could enjoy more room with my Dad on the trip and I'm so very thankful we did. The 18' Alumarine was outfitted with a new 40 hp Yamaha with electric start, depth finder and trolling motor. The trolling motor just happened to be a MinnKota Terrova with IPilot........SWEET!!!!! The boat launch and dock was 50 yards from our cabin door. There is a nice cove where there is enough room to harbor 15 or so boats at anytime where everything is well protected. This upgrade boat handled so well in the choppy water ( at times 2 + ft ) I'll never rent anything else on trips there. The upgrade cost was so affordable I'd be silly not to . The fish cleaning house is immaculate and Gord personally cleans the day's catch immediately upon your return at any time throughout the day. I'd guess that it takes him about 45 seconds to clean a walleye.. The legend of ""Two Swipes "" was born.....one swipe down each side of the fish....done. Everything packaged for home or dinner in camp.... as you see fit, each day. SWEET !!!! Service.....without a doubt the best I have ever had at any location I've fished....... which includes many a saltwater charter locales outside of the US. We were personally met at the dock every time we were ready to leave and met every time upon return. Sometimes so prompt that we were not actually ready to leave.....what a problem to have on a trip. You may not be greeted at the dock if you sneak out at o'dark early ( 5:45 am ish ) like my son and I did three mornings while our seasoned veterans on the trip slept in a ""little bit"" more. As mentioned, fish cleaning complimentary and so well done, cabins spotless, daily discussions about fishing spots with our maps marked up with places to try and hazards to look out for, fish boards in the cleaning house where everyone has their big fish posted , from the beginning of the season, for everyone to view and dream about beating during their stay; the Fish Fry on Sunday - the best ever, tore the transducer mounting board off the rental boat during beaver dam jumping ( Gord's response - I have more screws ) fixed before we went out in the evening , BP had probably 5 lbs of mud inside the stern of his boat from our beaver dam jumping excursion....note to self BP... motor may have been trimmed up a touch too much.... Gord pulled the boat out of the water and washed it out so the carpet wouldn't get stained - he wouldn't listen to BP that it wasn't necessary, on calm nights a campfire was lit for everyone to enjoy after coming in for the evening...I could go on with more and more examples..... a comfortable place to stay close to Vermilion Bay. If you want a remote, remote camp....this may not be your type of lodge. If you want a great fishery with the chance at a big fish, service beyond your expectations while being able to run to a store minutes away for emergency supplies.......this is your kind of place. Now, I need a little help on voting for which event during our trip qualifies as the official "" Weenie Award "". Once we have a decent number of votes cast, we shall announce the person's identity of the ""Weenie Award"" for our trip at VBL... - A fella showing up in a Smart car with yoga pants on - A fella catching the motor more than once and having to respool line - A fella so inept at making coffee ( doesn't understand the concept of closing the basket that holds the grounds) he has been fired forever from that duty...once maybe, but twice within an hour of said incidents...C'mon Man - A fella casting spoons to shore with no trees at all, except for the one on a lone rock and catches it good. - A fella that suggested jumping the beaver dam is a "" good idea"" - A fella that concurred beaver dam jumping is "" is a good idea"" - A fella that snags a marker buoy put out by a guest from another lodge and drags it from 20 fow to 35 fow thinking he has a big fish on. - A fella that runs over a marker buoy put about by another VBL guest not once, but multiple times. - A fella that explains to his fishing partner to be wary of their backcast when casting and then himself snags the partner's line causing such a backlash on his own reel they are forever know as ""Big Bird"". - A fella that puts a non-alcoholic beer in the freezer to chill and forgets it overnight only for the rest of the group to find out in the morning that it exploded and covered everything in the freezer. - A fella that flicked his cigarette ashes and hit his fishing partners line causing an immediate loss of lure and bait - A fella that doesn't recognize the cap on the Clorox pee bottle is missing and dumps the whole load of pee in the boat without recognizing why the pee bottle is not getting heavy at all. Overall, a wonderful and relaxing trip with family and friends at a great lodge. Another one for the memory book and I'm sure more to come at VBL. Attached are a few pictures of the fun and scenery. I'll be sure to post more on an album and/or additional posts. Tight Lines, PjShorthorn"
4147113,pjshorthorn,2015-08-20 23:48:00,5654,"Yes sir. That is a floating jighead in the example I attached to the post. I use egg sinkers on both spinner rigs or floating jigs. They tend to be less susceptible to hanging up in rocks or timber as they will slide up the line and give you time to jig them loose from the structure before losing the whole rig. Other than that,it is just a weight to get the bait in the strike zone. PjShorthorn"

( ) Howdy WC: Well, apparently it is time to announce the winner of the 2015 ""Weenie Award"" from our trip to Vermilion Bay Lodge this summer. I was going to officially announce the results on September 1st, but due to a few ""nosey folks"" asking when the results would be posted......I'm making a concession which would not normally take place in the spirit of fishing trip ""etiquette"". It is kinda like someone horning in on your fishing spot. I would like to thank all of the voters for their submissions. Without your ""valuable"" input, this award could not be elevated to the prestigious status it is now going to receive on an annual basis. The number of votes were overwhelming and I used up two full rolls of adding machine tape tabulating the results. ( I'm not really all that good on 10 key adding machines). Without further adieu..... In 3rd Place receiving 1 vote : PjShorthorn - For wearing yoga pants WHILE driving a Smart car upon arrival in camp. Yes.....at least the effort was recognized !!!!!! In 2nd Place receiving 1 vote : Gramps - For failure to recognize( twice in one hour) that you MUST close the coffee maker basket in order to prevent a river of coffee from running down the countertop onto the floor. In 1st Place receiving an overwhelming amount of the votes: Breezy Point - for failing to recognize that he was using a defective pee container ( missing the ""safety"" containment cap) and proceeded to essentially pee into his own boat. Although not part of the ""Weenie Award "" contest, a meritorious award was also presented to the youngest member of the group......aka Stickman/ Loonie for not clogging up the cabin's coin operated washroom Bidet. With older members on the trip, that tend to eat a lot of fiber, this could have been a serious problem during the course of a week's time. The 2015 "" Weenie Award"" trophy is in the final design stages. Due to delays on receiving some the "" highly engineered"" components needed to complete the project, it may be another month or so before the final trophy is unveiled to the entire WC community. Please stay tuned..... Thank you to all of the voters and responders regarding this ceremonious event.

Well donel My vote goes to: ""A fella so inept at making coffee ( doesn't understand the concept of closing the basket that holds the grounds) he has been fired forever from that duty...once maybe, but twice within an hour of said incidents...C'mon Man"" As coffee overseer in my group, you'd not only be fired but put on dish detail... Jimi's boat has well certain rules........ There is no bottle, Jimi has this floatation device he slids over ya with a cord attached, he pushes ya in and continues his trolling run. If he catches a fish, he'll pull ya back in, if not, well, lets not go there"
4122321,BreezyPoint,2015-08-12 11:04:00,1581,"As the senior member of the trip, Pat's dad exempted himself from all chores by fiat. So we couldn't put him on dish detail (Pat - sorry to reveal the culprit). Overriding his executive orders required a unanimous vote which we couldn't muster. He didn't veto the firing from making coffee though.Frank"

Just far enough back that I don't hear any SCREAMING....."
4122561,BreezyPoint,2015-08-12 12:45:00,1581,"But happens if you need to use the equivalent of a bottle? Do you put yourself out too, or do you have another secret method?Frank"
4115945,BreezyPoint,2015-08-10 09:47:00,1581,"I think you hit the nail on the head...yes I have caught more fish on other trips, but we caught plenty at your place, more than enough to keep us interested and some nice ones too. I have always said if all you want are fish, go to the market. To me it's the total experience, magnificent Canadian scenery, even bugs, a few campfires,and a good friendly place to stay. This was one of the best trips I have taken. PJ and his family were great partners as well.Frank"
4117785,rnnonmt,2015-08-10 19:38:00,992,"Vbay - please keep us in the loop on the winners of the fishing contest using Pat's beer cap lures. Although I have never been a patron of your establishment, based on your comments, Pats comments and other WC-ers comments that I have read on political or otherwise ""touchy"" subjects I have concluded that you, your staff, and facilities are one to be benchmarked. Kudo's to you and your team."
4117953,Mike Kansas,2015-08-10 20:40:00,1463,Great salute to what fishing is about GOOD FRIENDS & GOOD TIMES Mike Kansas
4118009,wallydave,2015-08-10 21:05:00,2151,"I couldnt agree more! A good trip is the total package! Fish, eagles, loons, sunrises, sunsets, crazy stories, lies told around the campfire.... well you know, if we have to explain, you will never understand! After fishing with Mike, Frank and Pat, I can tell you, a great trip will be had if you can share a trip with these guys!"
4118329,pjshorthorn,2015-08-11 04:11:00,5654,"Triple H I'll be in "" The South Bend"" at the end of September for an ND game. I'll take you up on that French Press. I'll make sure to respect your 3 feet of personal space and I'll only wear ND colors...... It would be great to meet you if you have the time. We will be in town 9/25-9/27 PjShorthorn."
4118353,pjshorthorn,2015-08-11 04:47:00,5654,"Oh don't worry, there was enough Anti-American attitude with the coin operated toilet in the cabin........I mean I had to go to the CO-OP and crack a fifty for the week just to take care of important business when the time arose. I checked the cabin those fellas from Manitoba stayed in and there was no "" pay for poo "" meter on their bathroom. I do have to apologize about the burned out grass in front of our cabin.......we just put a 5 gallon bucket on the deck for pee breaks during the middle of the night and dumped it over the railing each morning. I would have gone broke if the older fellas kept dropping a Loonie in the meter every time they had to take a pee break during the middle of the night. Let Suzanne know that we really didn't train the pups to pee in the same spot that week. Since I'm sure your Anti-American attitude will not change anytime soon towards the ""pay for poo"" meter.......I'll be ordering a toilet seat for our five gallon bucket. I'm not going to idly sit by and be taken advantage of on bodily function needs. Oh yeah, we will need a nice privacy screen installed on the deck too. PjShorthorn."
4118497,pjshorthorn,2015-08-11 06:06:00,5654,"Since we are talking about the whole experience and the "" fish, relax, unwind"" motto at VBL.....check this dude out. He fished an hour on the first day and then unwound like a main spring on a garage door. We had to plug Gramps in a few times a day so he was ready for the next adventure. He fished each day and hit the Muskie Grand Slam....... he caught a Motor Muskie , caught a Marker Buoy Muskie and caught a Muskie. He relaxed quite a bit and unwound better than any of us. I guess that is why he is the sage advisor on most anything except making coffee, making sure no one blows up non-alcoholic beer in the freezer and using 20 year old rain bibs that left a trail of yellow flakes no matter where he walked. I can't make this stuff up.......he is my Dad. The old saying "" like father like son"" is kinda making me nervous. We would have not completed the ""whole trip experience"" without awarding our youngest group member with the Golden Plunger Award for not cratering the entire camp septic system during our stay. It was a little worrisome at first as the kid didn't come out of the bathroom for quite some time. When we finally heard pleas for a Loonie, we figured out that you had to pay bathroom tolls both ways. Glad that we figured that part out early on........otherwise another fella may have been stuck in the woods trying to figure out if those leaves are really poison ivy or not. There is no telling what else about this trip may come out in the future. I'm sure there are a few things that I have buried deep in the back of my mind trying to ""un-know"" them........ PjShorthorn"
4118505,v-bay gord,2015-08-11 06:09:00,3168,"Surely you can't be complaining about ""pulling your own weight"", ""lifting yourself up by your boot strap"" kind of pay as you go attitude. That is the American way! Do I have to remind you of Obama Care? Those who ""Can"" ...""Do"". In this case, if you have a loonie, you can do your do-do in the flusher. Circumventing the system by using a bucket is like accepting food stamps while driving a Mercedes. My plans for the future include a coin operated fish house, and electric trolling motors that accept U.S. five dollar bills.........."
4118577,Bill Krejca,2015-08-11 06:38:00,6107,"Guys, I've gotten a huge amount of entertainment value out of this thread, the Canadian adventure (and this web site) isn't all about fishing, as most of us know. In fact, I'd venture to say this thread stands up well, competing favorably with the ""Fishing With Doc"" series in the In-Fisherman. Only needs a skilled artist to appear out of the bush. Still laughing, Bill"
4118617,pjshorthorn,2015-08-11 06:49:00,5654,"How many trolling motor minutes does a fella get for $5 bucks? I'm just trying to figure out how many ""fives"" I need to jump the beaver dam again......I say the heck with the transducer this time around!!!! Don't even go down the road about Obama Care.....he just plagarized the entire Canadian socialized medical healthcare program........ Oh.....don't bring up the great exchange rate I got, cracking a US $50 bill at the CO-OP, just so I had enough Loonie ""poo"" cash. PjShorthorn"
4114793,dutchboy,2015-08-09 19:01:00,5717,Nice report. Always good to hear of a resort owner who is on top of his game! Sounds like Gord knows what it takes to run a respectable operation.
4114849,Rich B,2015-08-09 19:55:00,1081,"""A fella that doesn't recognize the cap on the Clorox pee bottle is missing and dumps the whole load of pee in the boat without recognizing why the pee bottle is not getting heavy at all"". Yea, no doubt this is the award winner....."
4115065,rnnonmt,2015-08-09 22:11:00,992,"""Weenie award"" and pee bottle go hand in hand. There is no other choice!!! Great report Pat. Based on your report it is evident that your trip was filled with memorable events (especially knowing your dad and son were with you on this one), an excellent fishery, and a great host and lodge owner. I thoroughly enjoyed the full narrative!!! I can't wait to receive the ""fishing porn"" in the mail. Brian"
4115193,pjshorthorn,2015-08-10 05:00:00,5654,The VBL drones that Gord sent out to find where we were catching the big ones did not go unnoticed. PjShorthorn
4115257,pjshorthorn,2015-08-10 05:27:00,5654,"I guess Gord got serious when he was searching to see where we were fishing.....I mean, I would have just marked the map for ya Gord. PjShorthorn"
4115337,pjshorthorn,2015-08-10 05:45:00,5654,"Here is the luxury version of our upgrade boat at VBL. The wooden boat was hooked up to my Dad's car and taken home with us . I should have asked for a ride to see if she leaked before ""borrowing"" it.....Oh Well......I have Silly Putty at home if she has a leak. What a beaut...... PjShorthorn"
4115409,pjshorthorn,2015-08-10 06:01:00,5654,"If you had a question on where the camp was when heading in at the end of the evening....just look for the Red Roof Inn. Gord, the tree going through the eave of our cabin was a nice architectural feature. Please keep her safe. PjShorthorn"
4115625,HeHooksHimself,2015-08-10 07:30:00,725,"Thanks for bringing a smile to my face fellas. As for the vote, I was leaning toward the pee bottle, but since I have done that myself I decided to go with the yoga pants and smart car. While I did not see this in person, my own mind's eye of that picture is something I have not been able to shake and will probably haunt me forever. If I run across you at the Middle of Nowhere coffee shop I will buy you a french press but please don't touch me! Hooks"
4115785,Mike Kansas,2015-08-10 08:28:00,1463,PEE BOTTLE.....WINNER. Sounds like you guys had a great time and really loved the camp. It's always good to hear that a lodge has an atmosphere that not only allows you to catch fish but gives you the bonus of laughter and fun. Mike Kansas
4115905,v-bay gord,2015-08-10 09:35:00,3168,"I don't want to get serious, and thank you for the positive responses by the way, but the fact is it is easy to have a good atmosphere when your guests are as laid back as PJ and Breezy. Our motto is ""fish, relax, unwind""....and I think in equal proportions. You need to have the attitude that you're going to have fun no matter what. I know that both PJ and Breezy have had better fishing on other trips, but the combination of trying new things and involving friends and family is more important than ""200 fish days"". If that is your focus then finding a camp that caters to that is the key. O.K.....that's the end of my modesty. I didn't realize that both PJ and Breezy were ""Americans"". Had I known that I would definitely have treated them with a dose of my ""Anti-American attitude""....."
4114001,stjoeguy,2015-08-09 13:16:00,979,"Great report. And the Chlorox bottle guy has to win the ""Weenie Award"" for several reasons."
4114025,wallydave,2015-08-09 13:21:00,2151,"Nice report ! I hope you think seriously about including the yoga pants pictures! Now pictures of Gords moving attire, those should be shared for the greater good of humanity! I am reminded that fishing trips are so much more than just the number of fish caught!"
4114065,v-bay gord,2015-08-09 13:37:00,3168,"PJ........your report is rife with embellishments. For example, my slippers are a tartan plaid, not pink. By the way, my nomination for the weenie award is Breezy Point and his annoying habit of taking pictures of my nose with his camera two inches from my face. Does he have a collection of nose shots in his closet?"
4114137,pjshorthorn,2015-08-09 13:49:00,5654,"Well sir, As I mentioned, we had so much rain that my camera was in the dry bag for most of the trip. I wish I had been able to catch a picture of Gord in his mowing attire, but I definitiy have one of his fish cleaning "" biking outfit"" that he wore each day. Since this is a ""family"" forum it probably wouldn't be appropriate to post that picture which may scare away younger folks or cause disruptions to older folk's pace makers. As some folks on here have said previously....... "" I wish I could unsee that picture"" Your are absolutely correct. A trip is about the whole experience and not just fish. We had the whole experience. BTW, you didn't vote for the ""Weenie"" Award. PjShorthorn"
4114329,wallydave,2015-08-09 15:01:00,2151,"Not seeing Gords attire, I dont have to ""unsee"" that mental image! As for the Weenie Award, it would have to be the bleach bottle caper! Thanks to my healthcare environment, I have official urinal availability! They come in handy when chumming for walleye!"
4114345,BreezyPoint,2015-08-09 15:07:00,1581,"Here is our wonderful host, for those who wonder what he looks like:https://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/08...d874362c64.jpgAnd here is Gramps with a nice walleye, just to prove the old geezers actually fished for a few minutes:https://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/08...22f14f428c.jpgFrank"
4114433,pjshorthorn,2015-08-09 15:43:00,5654,"Well sir, embellishments are not part of my fishing reports......ever..... My sincerest apologies for confusing the apparent hue on your slippers as being pink.......now that you mention it, it does make sense that your slippers could look to be tartan plaid since you were wearing a kilt while mowing. Guess my polarized sunglasses were quite wet that morning and distorted the view.I can't accept your vote for the weenie award as pictures of you were not on the list of choices. Please vote again.PjShorthorn."
4114593,Danbear,2015-08-09 16:55:00,72,Great report PJ We are heading up to Eagle on Friday would love to catch some big perch if you care to share the spot. PM me if you do. I won't share your secret. We will be at Birch Dale and if Gord can make his way over would love to buy him a couple. Dan Bear
4114673,BreezyPoint,2015-08-09 18:02:00,1581,"Danbear, why don't you take a few moments and go visit Gord at his place. My guess is he rarely leaves since he monitors his operation really closely. It also probably wouldn't look very good with Gord tipping a few with customers at their place.Frank"
