4174065,Scot,2015-09-01 17:03:00,8,I am going up to vermilion bay the same week. I think the walleyes should still be in 20 to 35 fow. I hope to hear from some fisherman that can confirm my thoughts.

I would say this is a common pattern this time of year......so don't overlook the rock structures abutting some of these walleye holes.....steep drops etc. That said we've had a number of musky caught this week in weeds, on rock, in the wind.....and everything in between. Seems double blade bucktails or spinner baits have been a good go to bait. Walleyes........can't beat a crawler harness and bottom bouncer this time of year.....also jig and minnows or Lindy rigs all work too. Shallower bites early and later in the day (and you'll be in a darker section of the lake which should have a better shallow bite as well)......weather will be cooling off next week so we'll see what that does to the fishing."
