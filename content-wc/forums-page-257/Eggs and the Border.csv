4151873,buckeyedan,2015-08-23 06:34:00,44,"Did a family vacation a couple weeks ago. Went into Canada at Port Huron, MI and the Canadian border agent didn't say a word about eggs or poultry. Came back through Sault Ste. Marie and the US border agent asked if we had poultry products and said ""nothing in, nothing out"". So like a lot of border crossing rules, it just depends on where you cross and who your agent is."
4156857,ftfarms,2015-08-25 09:03:00,444,We paid around $3 US but that was for the largest eggs thay had. I wasn't asked about poultry or eggs going either way.
4160297,milfish,2015-08-26 15:35:00,249,"So, can a guy take a frozen turkey across the border???"
4160369,SinOrSwim,2015-08-26 15:44:00,1528,I don't think so. Raw is raw. Be prepared to throw it away.
4160985,Beagle_Nut,2015-08-26 21:51:00,52,"Ok, what do you think about the little milk carton type things with 'pasteurized' egg whites? My wife just bought 4 containers with 2 marked for our trip to Whitefish Bay in September."
4161001,ftfarms,2015-08-26 22:04:00,444,To my understanding not cooked not aloud. So I would say no. If your going though Baudette mn thay may not even ask Thay didn't us. But the other two vehicles were three hours behind us and thay asked them. Differant person at the window??
4161185,btyreprich,2015-08-27 05:14:00,1067,We went through Int Falls in early August. The booth where you pay to cross the bridge had a sign stating no eggs & poultry can be brought into Canada. The Canadain border guard asked if we had any raw poultry and eggs. He also said only commercially cooked poultry could be brought into the country at this time. That means my home cooked fried chicken would not be allowed. Hope this bird flu crisis is resolved soon.
4146033,CycloneWalleyeHunter,2015-08-20 15:13:00,18,Heading to Lac Seul in about 3 weeks. I was just wondering the status of the egg ban and crossing the border? Thanks for the input.
4146161,SinOrSwim,2015-08-20 15:47:00,1528,Eggs will be denied. Where are you headed? I assume Iowa State fan by that username? It is interesting. I went up in June and headed back in about 3 weeks. I was asked in June even though we were only going for a couple days. About the same time we had friends of our who took an RV trip to Niagra Falls. They crossed the border with an RV FULL of food and 3 kids. Didn't get asked about eggs at all and had both eggs and chicken in their refrigerator. They had no idea about the eggs or chicken thing until I asked them after they got back.
4146225,Stringbean,2015-08-20 16:02:00,279,The restriction is still in place as of August 14th. That's the date of the last edition of the document in this link: http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/.../1421341727507
4146249,btyreprich,2015-08-20 16:05:00,1067,We were asked about eggs and raw chicken both ways - going into Canada and then cioming home. This was a few weeks ago. Ended up buying our eggs at a Walmart in Kenora which was not too far out of the way for us. We knew about the ban on poultry times thanks to this web site. Sure hope the ban is lifted next year. I had a minor case of sticker shock when it came time to pay for the eggs!
4146473,CI_Guy,2015-08-20 17:45:00,2118,"My wife asked a Canadian border agent when we crossed about a month ago if they asked everyone about poultry & eggs, because her sister had not been asked about it when she crossed. The customs agent told us that if the vehicle has a license plate from a state that is not on the banned list they might not be asked about poultry & eggs."
4146753,CycloneWalleyeHunter,2015-08-20 19:37:00,18,"Thanks all for the update. Very much an Iowa State fan, much to the chagrin of my campmates. LOL. Going with a bunch of Hawkeye fans. We are headed to Mahkwa on September 17. So looking forward to the trip!"
4147217,Catman59,2015-08-21 04:11:00,345,I was never asked either direction. Crossed at Pigeon River going up and returned through Ft Francis ....... and I am an Iowa guy !!!!
4147417,SinOrSwim,2015-08-21 06:46:00,1528,"Yeah, they are from Iowa. So, definitely a state on the list. Also interesting, you would think an RV with a whole family would definitely have food in it. Then again, they crossed in New York where maybe it's not as big of an issue and not something the border agents are looking for compared to the midwest. He also said he was joking around with the officer. Made a comment about moving there with the RV. Said the guy laughed and it was easy as could be. LOL Completely different experience."
4147793,Slab Seeker,2015-08-21 09:23:00,14,Hopefully it will be an enjoyable ride for you and a long ride for them as you talk non-stop about the Clones victory over the Hawks the week before!!!!
4150561,milfish,2015-08-22 12:01:00,249,"So, any idea on how much we should expect to spend for a dozen eggs, say in Dryden??"
