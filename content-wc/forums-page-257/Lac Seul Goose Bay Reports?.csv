4172513,fishingMN4eyes,2015-09-01 09:42:00,108,"Got back last night from Lac Seul. Fished Wednesday thru Sunday. I'd say fishing was good, not great. We dealt with mostly low wind and sunny conditions. Wednesday we fished Steamboat and caught lots of small fish. We stayed close to camp because three of us had arrived just that morning after driving through the night, had to get the boat in the water, and drive into Ear Falls to get licenses. Called it a kinda early day to get in for fish dinner.Thursday we ran down to McKenzie. Fishing was steady there and we got into some bigger fish. Had shore lunch as well which was great as always.Friday we ran back to McKenzie again and had similar results as the day before. Found a couple spots where we caught almost exclusively 18""-22"" walleye.Saturday was another run to McKenzie. We had a slow morning but things really picked up in the afternoon. We got stopped by the MNR and a police officer. The two guys could not have been more friendly and courteous with us. We didn't have anything to hide, but you hear some horror stories about the COs up there and this was not one of them. Asked for our licenses, ask how many fish we had in the boat/back at camp, measured our fish, and asked if we had any alcohol before moving on. Sunday we stayed close to camp fishing in Steamboat and a couple rock piles closer to camp. Again we seemed to be catching only smaller in fish in those areas. We caught fish as shallow as about 12' and picked a few up as deep as 25-26' depending on the spot. Crawlers and minnows fished pretty even in our boat. There didn't seem to be a specific jig style or color that worked better than any others. Big in our boat was 25.5"" and the other boat in our group had a 27""."
4172705,stjoeguy,2015-09-01 10:31:00,979,Thanks for the report. We're heading up to that area (Onaway Lodge) on Friday. It sounds like McKenzie will be on our list of spots to try. This will be our first trip to NW Lac Seul and we're looking forward to it!

4173665,bushy,2015-09-01 15:15:00,17,"I was up last week at Gold Pines with my 88 year old dad and nephew. Boy did we struggle. I have been going to Lac Seul for ~10 years and this was by far the worst year. The weather didn't help at all. When we arrived on Saturday afternoon we started to have a thunderstorm that basically last 10 hours. It dumped 4 inches of rain. Sunday was rainy and windy so didn't get out much then either. Monday was the worst conditions I ever had up there in August. It was in the 40's with rain and more wind. Didn't get to fish much that day either. Tuesday was typical post cold front conditions with clear skies and wind from the north. Wednesday we finally made it down to McKenzie and had a decent day with many walleyes up to 18"". No bigger fish. Thought Thursday they would turn on but didn't for us. Went back down to same area and fish were not there. Lake was pretty much dead calm Wednesday and Thursday. Friday fished Bay of Islands and got into a few bigger fish but not that many. We mainly backtrolled with spinners. Didn't jig much because my dad pretty much can't do that very well so that may have been one problem. Now the northern fishing was very good. Me and my nephew would go out for just a little while at the end of the day and cast with spoons in the bays. We caught a lot under 30"" and got a 30, 31, 33, 34, 40.5 and a real hog of a 42.5"" that put up one of the best fights I had from a fish. If we were just northern fishing it might have been a great trip. This was about my 12th year in a row going up with my Dad. Last few years kept saying this would be his last. Well this year will be his last. It was very tough on him to get around and in and out of boat. Basically lifted him in and out of boat. But he was a trooper fishing 7 - 8 hours a day. Too bad the fishing was so tough. I have a feeling it was tough for a lot of people because of the lack of reports. Everybody in our camp struggled. Wish you luck and report when you get back.
