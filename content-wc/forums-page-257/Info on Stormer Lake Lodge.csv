4024634,BornToFish,2015-07-06 07:31:00,1224,"My wife and I just returned from a week's stay at Stormer Lake Lodge. We had a fantastic time. Dave and Linda Becker are gracious hosts. Their staff (Lorraine, Kenny and Dawn) are committed to customer service. The boats and motors were top-notch in every respect. The camp is outstanding in terms of layout, cleanliness and overall charm. The American Plan (food) was outstanding. The shore lunches on the lake were excellent. The fishing was simply outstanding, even in spite of the mayfly hatch that was going on in earnest. We focused on walleyes the entire trip. It seemed as though everything worked - primarily jigs and spinner rigs. The average walleye for the week was about 18 inches long. Our biggest walleyes were 23-24 inches long, and we caught dozens of these fish. Number of fish was not a problem (100+ each day). Dave's comment at the start of the week pretty much summarized the trip. He said to not overthink the walleye fishing. He basically said to just put something in front of the fish and yank. The quality of walleye fishing on Stormer and Kirkness Lakes from Stormer Lake Lodge (a drive-to lodge) clearly rivaled that for many of my fly-in fishing trips. My wife and I are very much looking forward to our next visit at Stormer Lake Lodge in August."
4025058,Bstar,2015-07-06 09:51:00,564,How is the ride on Nungesser Lake Rd?
4025802,stormerlake,2015-07-06 15:27:00,6,The gravel road section of Nungesser Rd is very good except for the portions on both sides of the new bridge across river. For about 200 yards on both sides of the bridge it is wash boarded. Other than that it is good travels to Stormer Lake Lodge.
4026178,BornToFish,2015-07-06 17:28:00,1224,"I agree with the previous post. We traveled at 40-45 mph on the gravel road with no problems. As mentioned, the section before and after the bridge was bumpy, so we slowed down on this section of road."
4162265,BornToFish,2015-08-27 13:51:00,1224,"My wife and I recently returned from an incredible week long stay at Stormer Lake Lodge. As we drove home, we could not think of anything that we wished would have been better. The lodge and cabins are beautiful in appearance, furnishings and cleanliness. The food (American plan only) was outstanding in every respect. The every other day shore lunches were a definite plus. The owners (Dave and Linda Becker) and their staff (Lorraine, Kenny and Dawn) were friendly and helpful in so many ways. The Lodge has twelve boats (all 18 footers: nine Lund Outfitters and three G3s) with either 40 hp or 50 hp tiller motors. Six of the boats and motors are new this year. The boats are outfitted with bow mount trolling motors, anchors, sonar units, nets, etc. Our boat was immaculately clean when we stepped into it. The docking system was easy to use, even in rough water. The gas tank was topped off each evening. The boat seats were dried off for us each morning. We focused on walleye fishing the entire week. Frankly, the walleye fishing rivaled many of the fly-in trips we have taken and even surpassed several of the fly-ins in terms of numbers and size of fish. Not bad for a drive-to lodge! We mostly vertical jigged live bait on structure and casted weed edges for our walleyes. The majority of walleyes came from 24-30 fow near structure. We fished the early morning bite the first few days, until we realized we didn't need to do that in order to catch fish. As soon as we learned this, we slept in, enjoyed breakfast and then hit the lake around 7:45 a.m. each day. On the last day of fishing, my wife and I boated 78 walleyes by lunchtime (c.a. 12:30 p.m.), with maybe ten to fifteen fish under eighteen inches long. The longest walleye was around twenty five inches. I rate that day as being representative of each day for the week's fishing. We made the short trek to Kirkness Lake each morning and spent the entire day there. After dinner, we fished on Stormer Lake such that we were within a short boat ride of the Lodge. We fished each evening until it was dark. We fished for northern pike one afternoon. Catching eater/take-home size pike was straightforward. We just casted small Mepps in-line spinner baits and one ounce Daredevles over weed beds. We caught several larger pike while vertical jigging for walleyes. It was a definite ""plus"" to not have to compete with boats from other lodges, as there are no other lodges on the lakes. Heck, we seldom saw boats from our own lodge! My wife and I were treated to an amazing sight the first evening of our trip. A young bull caribou stepped out of the bush about twenty yards from us when we were fishing a point very near the Lodge. The animal just looked at us for about a minute and then ambled back into the bush. My wife and I were completely satisfied in every respect with our fishing trip to Stormer lake Lodge. We will definitely be back next year!"

(used to be Stormer Wilderness Lodge). We would like to post on our website or Facebook. Looking forward to hearing from you."
3713394,BornToFish,2015-03-31 07:27:00,1224,"My wife and I are looking forward to fishing on Stormer and Kirkness lakes this season. We don't have any experience to date on these lakes. Are there anglers following this forum that can share their experiences fishing these lakes? Are there any proven patterns or presentations for walleyes, smallmouth bass or northern pike on these lakes? Are there any ""must have"" lures that should be in our tackle box? What time of the season did you fish on Stormer and Kirkness lakes? Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3730514,BornToFish,2015-04-05 07:00:00,1224,"I'm just refreshing this thread. Does anyone out in Walleye Central have experience fishing Stormer and Kirkness Lakes? If so, I would like to hear your thoughts, and suggestions for fishing these lakes."
3756161,BornToFish,2015-04-11 18:37:00,1224,Just refreshing this thread to see if anyone in Walleye Central has fished Kirkness and/or Stormer Lakes.
3756273,dutchboy,2015-04-11 19:29:00,5717,"I have not, however I would not venture onto any lake without........... 5 of Diamonds spoon. Mepps spinner. 1/2 oz. Rattle Trap. For Walleyes bring jigs."
3987697,AlumaAngler,2015-06-22 05:39:00,3,"Posted June 22, 2015 I just returned from a week at Stormer Lodge fishing Stormer and Kirkness Lakes. Fishing was fantastic to say the least. Caught Northern Pike and Walleyes plus a couple small perch. Did not catch a bass. Used frozen minnows as the live bait. Soft baits included Kahlin 5"" jerk bait and munchie tail grubs. I'm sure other soft baits would be effective. Caught over 100 walleyes per day. Did not keep track - just a guesstimate on the low end. Used 1/16th and 1/8th jigheads in a variety of colors. Color does not matter. Fish caught ranged in size from 9"" to 25"". Biggest fish in our group was a 27"". A fly-in lake fishing experience at a drive to lodge. All in all a fantastic week."
3988794,BornToFish,2015-06-22 12:36:00,1224,"Greetings AlumaAngler, My wife and I are headed to Stormer Lake Lodge on Friday (first time) for a somewhat hastily arranged trip. We return to the Lodge again in August. What patterns were the fish using when you were fishing last week on Stormer and Kirkness lakes? Did you bias your fishing to one lake or the other? What was the depth of water where you were catching your fish? Are the weeds very far along? Many thanks for the report!"
3993202,AlumaAngler,2015-06-23 17:10:00,3,"A lot of the fish we caught were relating to the green weeds - but I wouldn't say that was the pattern. Some of the fish were caught along shorelines and rocks too. Dave and Ken at the lodge will give you plenty of ideas on where to fish. I fished Stormer in the early morning, came back for breakfast, and then headed to Kirkness for the day. Fished Stormer in the evening. Caught fish at depths of 5ft to 21ft. Main depth was 8-12 FOW. Weeds are coming up but not very far along the week I fished. Hope that helps"
3993666,BornToFish,2015-06-23 19:35:00,1224,"Thank you for the reply. We are very excited to fish on Stormer and Kirkness Lakes for the first time! Would you describe the weeds as ""cabbage weed""? By this I mean weeds that might come up 6-8 feet tall, with broad leaves. Alternatively, might the weeds be ""grass"" type weeds that come up less than one or two feet and have narrow leaves? I've seen lakes over the years that tend to have one type of weed rather than the other type. I'm just curious as to what type of weeds to look for. Many thanks again. I appreciate your suggestions."
3994210,AlumaAngler,2015-06-24 03:48:00,3,Grass type weeds.
