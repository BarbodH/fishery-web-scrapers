4157769,Andre (wallyandre),2015-08-25 14:50:00,2274,For years that was a request fom the owner of a lodge to get a map of one of the most popular lake.It is now available with a Navionics card or on the Boatingapp for Apple and Android.To take a look visit the Navionics website on the webapp; zoom on the lake until you reach 1.5km on the scale bottom right of the page and don't forget to activate the blue icon on the bottom left corner of the page (sonarcharts HtD) More you zoom in the more it become incrediblehttp://webapp.navionics.com/?lang=en#@11&key=otekHleqjM

4158193,NY Walleye,2015-08-25 18:07:00,78,I just went on my phone app and it shows as well. The only issue without reception up there you would need to print off and bring with you. With a fish finder you should have not problem finding the drop off's and humps. Love it!
4158257,Andre (wallyandre),2015-08-25 18:45:00,2274,You don't need any signal from cell tower to use you're app. I use my IPad quite often in the remote area; for a Ipad it need to be cellular capable because they got a chip for the gps
4158817,octanehi5,2015-08-26 04:57:00,1104,"Does this mean I can catch more walleye, We have been waiting for this to be done,jean has been talking about it for a few yrs."
4159033,Andre (wallyandre),2015-08-26 06:46:00,2274,Just studying the map and I found a lot of interestings potentials for holding big fish!
4159985,octanehi5,2015-08-26 13:23:00,1104,"This recording of Hebert was done by a privet person not by Navionics, just got off the phone with them, I do have it on my galaxzy5s shows up very well.It looks fairly accurate"
4160529,MikeG1,2015-08-26 17:40:00,434,How is it possible to obtain a copy? Are copies for sale?
4160553,Andre (wallyandre),2015-08-26 17:47:00,2274,"That map is available on the Navionics card, BoatingApp and if you're actual card is eligible for Freshest data it's going to be download on you're card. Available for the Lowrance, HB, Raymarine and some of the Garmin and many more."
