4173793,v-bay gord,2015-09-01 16:06:00,3168,Very true. Last week there were several boats drifting out in Vermilion Bay fishing the 40 to 50 foot depths. Totally irresponsible in my opinion.
4173913,Campcountry,2015-09-01 16:18:00,164,A bit of an exaggeration . Walleye caught at 30 feet have an 8% chance of perishing and that doubles for every 10 feet of depth. http://www.rainylakeconservancy.org/...0Mortality.pdf
4174001,prov1800,2015-09-01 16:40:00,5010,Exaggeration or not (i seen a lot of fish floating) lately.and thats no exaggeration. Just trying to put a serious point accross to fisherman who are concerened with conservation.not interested in %.most % are a bunch of bull anyways.i go with my gut and what i see.one spot i fished had 6 dead wslleyes and not sure how many the eagles got before i got there.pretty sad.
4174105,phishfearme,2015-09-01 17:42:00,1242,see recent thread on this with lots of opinions:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=470634
4174993,Baseline,2015-09-02 05:10:00,3207,"25 to 30 feet is as deep as I go, but I know walleyes like deep water. Last fall we were on a lake fishing for lake trout and caught a few walleyes at 100 feet. Before the established keeper of morality jump on me for being a irresponsible killer of walleyes we added them to our legal limit for the day. Caught a couple of lakers too"
