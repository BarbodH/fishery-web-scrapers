4170657,Tx Jig tyr,2015-08-31 12:03:00,140,"I guess this is a ""near miss"" packed the car, got up early on Sat. and headed up north. Turned on the radio, everything was about Robert Kennedy being shot and killed in L.A. not a good time in the U.S. guess that proves I've been going a long time. Extra: watched the white Bronco chase in Ohare airport waiting for a flight to Minneapolis. Guess I am getting old."

I have missed some stuff, but when I asked the same question a while back I got some interesting responses. Here is my thread.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=315290 Regards"

4170185,Slab Seeker,2015-08-31 09:17:00,14,"Not national news but about 8 yrs ago when coming back from a fly-in to Birch Lake with Kay Air, I turned on my phone just after we crossed the border at Pembina and it started blowing up. Daugther had gotten stung by a bee and had a pretty nasty reaction. Needless to say the wife had made ""several"" calls to let me know what she had dealt with while I was gone. In the chaos at the ER the daughter's favorite stuffed dog which she had since she was a baby had gotten lost--- I was told to not even think about coming home until I had found an identical replacement. Have just done drive-ins since then and the Canada plan for the cell phone is always purchased for the month we go and any future fly-ins will include a sat phone"
4170553,Frankm,2015-08-31 11:19:00,154,This goes back awhile when I was around 12 years old. I was there in 1980 when Mt Saint Helens erupted. We woke up one morning and had ashes on our car. We had no idea why no forest fires etc. We found on on the way home that it had erupted. Ashes must have gotten carried in the jet stream or something. We were staying at Dale Stoffers Holiday Lodge which was later Ciancis and now Brownlees.
4163657,SinOrSwim,2015-08-28 06:41:00,1528,"Went across the border, all was fine. Came back from a fly in and we were greeted with something like $3.50/gallon gas. Katrina had happened. We were also on a fly in when 911 happened. What world events have you missed when across the border?"
4163841,Hawkfan,2015-08-28 07:33:00,237,"We flew into Sioux Lookout and saw the price per liter which always sounds high, but seemed higher than normal. Then it was over $4 right at the border and dropped a bit as we drove south. And with no real communication in those first hundred or two miles, it wasn't until we got back into the states that we found out the extent of what happened."
4163889,Mohleye,2015-08-28 07:59:00,368,The Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman murders. Still having trouble sleeping knowing the real killer is still out there!
4163913,SinOrSwim,2015-08-28 08:07:00,1528,lol We were in Canada with Princess Di too but I didn't want to mention that one.

4164089,troutaholic,2015-08-28 08:58:00,827,"We didn't miss these, but we were heading the next morning to Canada on both occasions: 1) OJ Simpson: We were packing the boat while watching the ""White Bronco"" chase 2) 9/11: Headed to the Cities several hours after the first tower fell. Entered Canada on 9/12 to the most serious group of armed mounties ever!!! The air traffic over Rainy Lake was nil!!! It was almost eerie. We had no idea if there was a war going on or what was happening until we went into Kettle Falls for the Football Games.............."
4164289,BornToFish,2015-08-28 09:42:00,1224,Does that mean you were dating Princess Diane?
4164393,SinOrSwim,2015-08-28 10:07:00,1528,We were up there when it happened and didn't know it happened. Flew out a day or two after and it was surreal. The pilot told us what was going on but we didn't really comprehend. Plane came in empty. Got us and our gear and nothing else. They have a rule up there they can't leave anyone in the bush. Not sure the technicalities of it but the pilot made a comment about how it felt to be one of the only non military planes in the sky over all of North America. My wife was at home (girlfriend at the time) and when the stuff started happening turned a tv to NBC and one on CNN and put in video tapes and hit record. I was able to watch a lot of the early footage. Stunned to say the least.
4164401,SinOrSwim,2015-08-28 10:08:00,1528,I wish. LOL
4164441,Bill Krejca,2015-08-28 10:21:00,6107,"Camped on a LOW island in 1980 when Mt St. Helens erupted. We thought the red sun and beautiful sunsets and ash were a result of the many forest fires in the area. Earlier still ,during another stay in the LOW wilds, 2 popes were elected (one died after a few days). Bill"
