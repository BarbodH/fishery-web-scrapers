Those two otters were the ones in question. Was told a quick storm came up and it got dark like it was dusk. Dons leased otter was back at his dock , when I stopped in. . Don now has Huron Airs base on McKenzie Lake too."

Hoping I might find someone who has fished here in the last few years. I am especially interested in the portage lakes and river proper. But I am hungry for any info at all on this spot. Really appreciate any help, thank you & good fishing to all! Beer Slayer"
4093377,Ogoki,2015-08-01 01:25:00,291,"After being check by the C.O. while we were on Attwood Lake one year, I asked him about the different lakes in the area . He stated the river coming into Guerin was awesome for fast action walleye. I have never fished Guerin but in that area, I have fished Attwood twice, Hurst, Bellsmith and. Auger,and many lakes just south of there. If it was me , that time of the year I would take some live bait with me , just to help you geto on to fish and then switch to artifical. I plan to be fishing and bear hunting for ten days about 30 miles east of Armstrong while you are at Guerin and then come home for a few days repack and head to Quetico ( just west of Thunder Bay) with some freinds for 9 days of canoe fishing .Good luck on your trip. Yesterday I booked 8 days at Ogoki Reservoir for the first week of June 2016. Hope I am not being superstitious as that will be trip number 13 for me to the Ogoki Res. Can't beat MLO !"
4093545,phishfearme,2015-08-01 06:08:00,1242,O - not sure if you heard but MLO's otter was heavily damaged during a recent storm while we were in Kearns lake. they had to send in two beavers rather than one otter to bring in the group following us and to bring us out. as a matter of fact there were two otter (turbos) damaged when they were moved to McKenzie lake for protection. they think it was a strong microburst. a sad for flyin operators - these are NOT cheap to fix. phish
4093833,Ogoki,2015-08-01 08:23:00,291,"Phish , Was it Don's otter that was damaged or the one he had leased ? When I was there three three weeks ago, C-FYLZ was sitting on the beach waiting for the rebuilt engine to come in . He had an otter leased from Adventure Air in Manitoba?"
4093873,Larry S,2015-08-01 09:09:00,665,"Ogoki, I was on the trip with phish and believe the leased otter was also damaged. Mattice has NO Otters as of 7-24 for use to fly .The 8 fisherman that were coming into Kearns Lake to relieve us were brought I with 2 Beavers Larry S"
4094129,fish007,2015-08-01 11:11:00,120,Were both turbo otters from MLO ? Thunderhook also flies an otter out of Mattice lake.
4096737,phishfearme,2015-08-02 18:11:00,1242,"sorry guys but I didn't get that level of detail. like LarryS mentioned, MLO does not have any otters to fly for quite some time. the pilot told us that two otters were damaged on Mackenzie lake one of which was MLO - not sure who owned the other. phish"
4111698,BrianE,2015-08-08 09:40:00,98,"Sorry to hear that, Don just recently rebuilt that Otter after hitting a rock on i believe Whiteclay a couple of years ago."
4143401,ablack86,2015-08-19 20:14:00,17,"Let us know how it goes. I am actually looking at Guerin for next year, so would love a recent report!"
4169473,Msf5801,2015-08-31 04:43:00,2,When did the plane get damaged? We just spent a week with them fishing Vick Lake.Thanks
