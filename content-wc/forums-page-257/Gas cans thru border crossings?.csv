4163009,WalleyeMatt,2015-08-27 18:50:00,93,I was charged duty a few years ago for cans I had in the back of the truck. The border agent told me if they had been in the boat I would have been OK with no duty as they are then considered on board tanks. Don't know if that has changed but I always have spare cans in the boat from then on and never have been questioned. Matt
4163137,v-bay gord,2015-08-27 19:58:00,3168,"When you can't afford to supply gas to your guests, well, the end is near.....hope they can turn that around."
4164609,roscoe33,2015-08-28 11:24:00,653,"I go to 2 small remote resorts, no - fish camps. They get one delivery of gas per year and need to make it last for their boats. They don't like selling gas and charge accordingly, $2.50 per liter. And I don't like buying boat gas that has been sitting for 6-10 months. We take a extra 6 tanks, just to make sure we don't run out, and have spare gas for the trucks. Never a question at the border. Gas cans will be inspected at the border for drugs occasionally."
4164689,btyreprich,2015-08-28 11:48:00,1067,"Lodges we have stayed at in the Ear Falls area are quite clear on not bringing gas into their camps. One lodge owner told us it has to due with insurance regulations - having gas close to a cabin and not in a government approved storage container. This owner used to let us place our gas jugs next to his large tank and would have us use our jugs after the first day - so as to empty them out quickly. He finally asked that we not bring gas into camp as it was not worth any fine he might get. Of course we respected his wishes. Now we still bring a gas jug or two along because there is NO gas stations on Highway 502! Just before we pull into camp, we will pour the gas into our truck's gas tank. Normally this provides us with enough gas for the drive to International Falls."
4172225,fishingMN4eyes,2015-09-01 08:12:00,108,For the last 6-7 years we have been transporting gas cans in the boat and have never been questioned on it.
4172537,kzoofisher,2015-09-01 09:46:00,5144,"Took 30 gallons across a week ago at the Soo, plainly visible. No one said a word."
4172609,tv4fish,2015-09-01 10:04:00,2694,"I agree - it has been MANY years since ""extra"" gas has been mentioned while crossing into Canada. Now - that said - maybe we better get off this subject -- so we don't give the Canadian officials any ideas - as I can potentially see a new ""import duty"" on gas just as they now have on alcohol..........."
4174521,Nipigon,2015-09-01 19:50:00,16,"I cross at the Pigeon River station several times annually with 50 gallons of fuel on the deck in three containers that are labeled correctly and easily seen by the inspectors. When asked if I have any extra the fuel the answer is always no ""I need every drop I have. Its like asking someone if they have any extra money. Never an issue when stated like that."
4175217,tv4fish,2015-09-02 06:45:00,2694,I like that response.
4161729,oly67,2015-08-27 08:53:00,241,Our new Ontario camp encourages us to bring our own gas. What are the rules on that?
4161769,bigwalleye1,2015-08-27 09:13:00,2632,"I beleve they can charge you duty on any fuel beyond the normal carrying capacity of the vehicle and the boat. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. Traveling on the road a good distance with cans full of gas has it's own inherent risks. As I am not your mother, I won't give you advice on that."
4161793,ftfarms,2015-08-27 09:25:00,444,Thay haven't asked about gas since the early 90s. We used to tent camp and brought in a 100 Gallon tank in the back of the truck. Shouldn't be a problem at all.
4161897,SinOrSwim,2015-08-27 10:41:00,1528,I saw someone pulled over at the border in June as I went in to pay our duty. They had about 5 agents with gloves on taking the cap off each can these guys were hauling. Sticking fingers in and smelling them to make sure they were gas. Also some electronic thing that looked like a scanner of some sort? I wanted to take a picture of it but figured they wouldn't like that.
4161921,oly67,2015-08-27 11:00:00,241,"I would think they were looking for booze. I know some guys from our area that went up there for years and did that, got caught one year. I am suspicious they used to bring some ""special"" tobacco also, not sure where they hid that..............?? Not too bright."
4161929,Bigstorm,2015-08-27 11:03:00,799,We bring (7) 5gal cans across for the past few years and have never been questioned
4162073,JDP,2015-08-27 12:07:00,1457,"There was a guy a year or so ago that got caught bringing minnows into Canada in gas cans. $1,500 fine.Here is a link to the story:http://www.ckdr.net/news/94829634/fi...h-fort-frances"
4162105,SinOrSwim,2015-08-27 12:11:00,1528,"lol I don't understand people. Risk vs Reward. Like when you see some chump on the news for armed robbery of a gas station. The culprit got away with $120 cash. So, 120 is worth risking 10 years in prison? A few dollars for minnows is worth risking a huge fine? Or booze? just pay the tax or buy the minnows up there. Plus, help the Canadian economy."
4162625,pjshorthorn,2015-08-27 15:42:00,5654,I've got to ask why a camp is encouraging you to bring your own gas? Doesn't seem to make a whola lot of sense. PjShorthorn.
4162665,oly67,2015-08-27 15:55:00,241,"Gas pump went out with the high water last year, did not fix. Have been sending some guests to a nearby competing camp to get gas if they don't bring more of their own like us. Probably aren't wild about using their competition in that way, I am guessing?"
