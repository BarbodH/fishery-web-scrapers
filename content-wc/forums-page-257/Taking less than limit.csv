4166481,Bassmandpe,2015-08-29 07:25:00,42,"Most of the year I fish Bass Tournaments in Florida which is all weigh in and live release. Twice a year I make a trip to two locations in Canada. have been doing this for over 50 years. Our group lives to have a Walleye & Pike dinners. Either fried, baked or broiled. I do most of the cooking. We set a bag limit before each trip on how many we are going to keep for our dinners. We set a size limit also. The first few days we usually keep enough fish to get us covered and back off the next days. Always a question from the guys "" Do we need fish?"" One of our guys likes to bring some fish home to his wife. So he brings four Walleye. My point is you should do what makes you happy while fishing in Canada. If you want to take fish home do it. Always play by the rules and expect others to do the same thing. Enjoy yourself and enjoy the resourse. See you in the northwoods!"
4167641,Sportdog,2015-08-30 06:51:00,6735,You guys advocating not keeping a limit of fish to protect the resource better also be advocating eliminating or seriously changing DNR staff as they are the people who study the fishery and set those limits..... If people are abiding by the set regulations there should be no problem unless the DNR is incompetent. Here in Michigan there are lakes and streams are so tightly controlled we sometimes have different regs for the same stream on one side of a bridge and the other!
4168073,Guest,2015-08-30 10:19:00,0,"I (in my previous post) was in no way advocating for others to keep less than what is legal to keep as far as limits go. I only responded to a question and stated what I keep as far as limits go (I also said that I will keep a limit if I think it's needed). The only time I would have a problem, is if anyone keeps more than the legal limit, other than that I say go ahead and enjoy your catch (besides, on many lakes, a limit is hard to catch on a regular basis anyway). There are many outings that I never keep any fish, it all depends on my mood & if I want to go and clean fish when I get home or not, other times I'm fishing purely for sport, every outing is different for me. (Some people sure get defensive, I think they need to relax and re-read others responses, I didn't see any chastising going on!)"
4174809,Kartman35,2015-09-01 22:32:00,245,"My understanding of my Quebec fishing license is not the same as above. The possession limit is also a daily limit. So if you catch 8 walleyes in the morning and eat them for lunch, you can't go walleye fishing until the next day. I'm not sure how they'd be able to bust you for it, but the MRNF website seems to indicate that the limits are daily/possession. If you're catching a hundred walleyes in a day I hope you're releasing at least 92 of them..."
4174985,Baseline,2015-09-02 05:02:00,3207,I believe the limits are set to secure sustainability of the fishery. I always comply with the limits set for the lake I'm fishing. We camp frequently on crown land in NE Ontario and are relegated to 1/2 of the full limit of 4. When fishing the Canadian side of Rainy US residents have a 1 walleye per day limit- possession of 4. With restricted limits of 4 - 2 and 1 I really doubt that the hook and line fisherman is going to seriously impact the fish populations on the lakes I have fished. I usually have a fish meal or two while on my trip and brig a limit home.
4175041,octanehi5,2015-09-02 05:28:00,1104,"8 is the limit to have at any time,one of the reasones we only keep about 2 fish per person for a fry.Only build to 8 in my possession on the last day. 100's of fish go back in the lake every day.When we are having a fry, the guys bring back their fish. Even if you ate 8 fish in a day after you ate them how would you check? you can not count fish you can not see. When freezing fish you also keep a patch of skin on the fish to be identifed.The lake has its own slot limit of 14""to 20"" fish everything larger or smaller goes back"
4175857,Kartman35,2015-09-02 10:21:00,245,"How many fish am I allowed to catch? There are three types of fishing limits. The daily catch limit is the maximum number of fish of a species that may be caught and kept in one day in one of the 29 fishing zones in the province. Fish consumed on the same day are considered in the daily limit. For example, if the catch limit is 15 fish and you decide to eat five of them, you may not catch another five fish of this species the same day. However, you may continue to fish another specifies in respect of which you have not yet reached the limit. Daily catch limits are not cumulative. Furthermore, when an individual fishes under another person's licence, the individual is not entitled to his own catch limit. The fish that the individual catches must be included in the licence holder's limit. The possession limit is the number of fish of any species that you may have in your possession at all times and anywhere, whether at the fishing site, on the road or at home. The possession limit usually corresponds to the daily catch limit. If, for example, the catch limit for a species in a zone is 15 fish, the possession limit for the species at that site will also be 15 fish. When you fish in more than one zone, the authorized possession limit for the species concerned is the higher of the authorized limits. No licence is required to possess fish. You may share your fish with someone who does not possess a fishing licence. However, you must abide by the daily catch limit and the person who receives the fish must comply with the authorized possession limit."
4165425,fishman10,2015-08-28 16:50:00,226,"Lower limits and size restrictions were imposed on Canadian lakes years ago. This has increased the populations, and a properly managed fishery allows for people to take their limit. The price I pay for fuel , taxes, bait tackle etc, is a fair trade for myself taking 4 fish home for my family to enjoy, I hardly feel guilty when I see a truck load drive past me with a native laughing at me!"
4165465,octanehi5,2015-08-28 16:59:00,1104,"When our crew of 6 or 10 guys do a fish fry we plan on a fish and a half each person way below the daily limit, 9 -17 to 20 "" walleyes will feed 6 guys, 15 will feed 10, 10 guys could legaly take 80 walleyes. you do the math. its not needed to take your limit every day. Quebec also has a lics for 7 or 8 days that you can eat fish but not bring any home"
4165705,retire55,2015-08-28 19:20:00,1029,"Frankly, I don't understand the almost constant arguing over how many fish folks keep. Simply put, there's no universal solution. Live and let live. For those who prefer to eat only a few fish, fill your boots. For those who adhere to fishing regulations and take home legal limits, that's your right and your choice. There's just no point in chastising each other for opposing views. Life is just too short."
4165873,Guest,2015-08-28 20:27:00,0,Good thing they don't do that here on WC. I reread the posts here and didn't see anywhere that someone was being chastised or any arguments taking place on the matter. Does this happen frequently???
4165889,Bobby Winds,2015-08-28 20:30:00,10817,Lake Nipissing in Ontario once referred to as a walleye factory has the same problem with Indians gill netting the crap out of the walleyes in the Big Nip that it has destroyed the walleye fishing there also. They too are in the talking mode on how to repair the Big Nip and I believe they have stopped gill netting until after the 2016 walleye spawn. Can't see how a lake can come back in less then a year.....
4165905,Bobby Winds,2015-08-28 20:33:00,10817,What lake has a daily limit of 8 walleyes per angler ?
4165937,Guest,2015-08-28 20:52:00,0,"Yes I kill a limit if I get the chance. Every single time I set out, one of my intentions is to take a limit back with me. Period. If my boy is with - we will kill his limit as well if we can - same is true if my wife is present. I sure as heck will not apologize for that. In fact, on occasion, I will clobber a nice eye (over 24"") for the grill and I have never heard someone say they didn't enjoy it come dinner time. Tomorrow we are fishing MN waters and if all goes even remotely well. 18 nice eyes will be on the trip home with me in the early afternoon. On the next Canadian trip I make, I intend to cross the border with my limit of walleyes (and I will have eaten a shore lunch there as well....... Walleyes fry up well. SL"
4166057,Guest,2015-08-29 04:09:00,0,Musky are better!
4166073,Bobby Winds,2015-08-29 04:48:00,10817,"Oh Boy, here we go...... Actually I prefer steelhead on the smoker."
4166089,octanehi5,2015-08-29 05:07:00,1104,"Its not a daily limit.In quebec its 8 in your possesion at any time.We catch 100's of walleye per day.The limits are there for a reason. I fish in Canada maybe twice a yr. I bring my limit home every time. I have found that most guys that take my trip bring home fish,not the limit all the time. Its their right to do so. As Jay said Live and let live"
4164233,zeebee,2015-08-28 09:27:00,1144,"Over the last few years Ive stopped taking limits, release all except a meal or two. Fish with barbless hooks too. It seems this makes sense regardless of what Im allowed per regulations.Fishing is a glorious pastime and we need to do whatever we can no matter how minuscule individual efforts may seem.Ive read where blaming DNR/MNR for fishery mismanagement is in vogue...tell you what, look at a given lake and tell me exactly how many fishare in it, how the ecosystem works on that specific lake, what yield it can sustain, then throw in a hundred other dynamic variables. Its a at best a semi informed estimate.Time to do our part."
4164273,Lovetofish,2015-08-28 09:36:00,458,If Canada had a conservation license for a reduced fee where you could eat two fish per day and take none home I'd buy it.
4164281,zeebee,2015-08-28 09:39:00,1144,They do for resident fishing...I buy the full license trusting some portion of the $ flows back into fisheries.
4164353,tv4fish,2015-08-28 10:00:00,2694,"They (Ontario, anyway) DO have an 8 day Conservation license (non-resident) which is about 1/2 the cost of a regular license, ($30.53 vs $53.54) which allows you to take 2 fish........"
4164513,Guest,2015-08-28 10:38:00,0,"I agree with zeebee, as I usually clean & prepare my catch as soon as I can, to have the freshest fish possible- no need to keep a limit, if I want another meal, I will go out again & catch a couple more. Now if I were with a group & we needed ""my"" limit to help treat the group to a nice meal, that might be the exception. But, for the most part I only take what I need for a meal. Also, you can always catch some sunnies, crappies & northerns etc... in addition to the walleyes for a great mixed bag. Good Luck!"
4164561,Guest,2015-08-28 10:59:00,0,"Well they have an annual too, for non residents. Keeping a ""limit"" makes no sense to me unless you can eat them all right away. Besides, a sport license allows for (in most cases) double the conservation, and that includes, IN POSSESION. If you're feeding a group perhaps a sport license makes sense however I am getting pretty sick of eating walleye so C&R and barbless hooks works for me."
4164617,HeHooksHimself,2015-08-28 11:28:00,725,"I, for one, appreciate your sentiments and values but I hope it is not a post that somehow might look down upon a fisherman who purchases the sportsman license and then abides by the rules governing that license. My wife looks forward to enjoying some fresh walleyes from my Canadian trips and so do my grand kids. I am committed to following the rules and agree that good conservation has made Canadian fishing steadily better through the years. I am doing nothing wrong by paying for the proper license and then observing the regulations associated with it. There is certainly a lot more to my Canadian fishing than the fishing, but I am expected to bring some home. Hooks."
4164665,zeebee,2015-08-28 11:35:00,1144,Stop on the way home...buy a Chateaubriand and a good bottle of wine. Whisper into her ear and she will soon forget about the walleye.You will be a responsible fisherman and a **** of a husband at the same time.
4164993,law57,2015-08-28 13:50:00,1147,I pinch the barbs on my hooks too. I lose a few fish but I lose a few with barbs in place too.If someone wants to buy the 'full' license and take fish home - that's great. Especially for family that didn't make the trip. That's what the extra dollars pay for when you buy a license. I sometimes wonder about limits though. For years I thought they should have lowered the limit on Mille Lacs. IIRC it used to be 6. With modern equipment - boats and electronics - 6 fish per can put a lot of pressure on the fishery. In the end I guess it didn't matter - the tribal limit was more than 6...
4165385,Freytown,2015-08-28 16:25:00,770,"When the First Nations stop gill netting spawning grounds, increased conservation will be gladly accepted....until then, forget about it."
