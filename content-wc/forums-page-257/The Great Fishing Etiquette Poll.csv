4166193,jWN,2015-08-29 06:10:00,62,"Correct, blind and stupid were not the best words to use on a public forum. Kinda sounds like something Trump may say. I understand everyone is entitled to their own beliefs on these matters."
4166353,Freytown,2015-08-29 06:57:00,770,"Anyone who say's that they would not fish this location later when it's empty is either lying or a fool. On new water, I always make note where others are fishing."
4163049,law57,2015-08-27 19:20:00,1147,"I have hunted public land. I also own 80 acres of prime oak forest next to thousands of acres of public land. Would you hunt a good deer stand if the person who found it wasn't there? ""Rather than keep searching?"" Interesting statement. That brings me back to my original post - on a related thread. We fish for different reasons. There a fisherman and there a 'catchers'. One is no better than the other. But one is so much more fun and takes a lot more ability. It also returns much more satisfaction. Example - I used to take kids to Canada. They could load the boat with walleye. There was very little skill involved. What they didn't realize was that someone put them on those fish. Anyone can 'catch' fish. Fewer are good at finding them."
4163185,Guest,2015-08-27 20:23:00,0,WOW. Not bad. 1 out of 3.
4163281,Guest,2015-08-27 21:15:00,0,"Should people only fish where they either know a spot of their own, or where they never saw somebody catch fish? Seeing somebody catch fish in a spot should not mean that you are not allowed to ever try that spot!?!?!?"
4163385,ftfarms,2015-08-28 02:13:00,444,Get it right smart guy. It was 1 out of 4.
4163449,LLewellin,2015-08-28 04:54:00,1790,"I wonder if ..... when the boats leave this spot and a new guy that saw them fishing and having success went over and fished that spot and then..........he learned why the fish were there and now he searches other spots that might be similar. Sounds like maybe a good learning opportunityAlso for the purists out there that think this practice is wrong. Enjoyment of the sport is to each his own. Just because you would not even look towards the boats having the success and absolutely would not fish the spot but would always read the water and find your own spot, not everyone is wired the same, not everyone has the same experience level, not everyone has the same drive or motive. Who taught you to fish?"
4163673,ftfarms,2015-08-28 06:45:00,444,"I read books,magazines and watched movies. I didn't want to drive 16 hours and not know what to do. This was inspired by a lodge owner in minasota that we stayed at. We got their and asked where the fish are and he pointed to the lake and said out their. I asked really?? He said he don't fish. We didn't do very well and I decided this will not happen again."
4163721,HeHooksHimself,2015-08-28 07:02:00,725,ft you are driving that spelling cop crazy with what you did right they're.
4164377,Guest,2015-08-28 10:05:00,0,"My question for those that think you shouldn't fish the spot is this; I have a secret honeyhole that upon arrival, I notice someone fishing there, do I have the right to tell them that this is ""my spot"", and they should not be able to fish there? The obvious answer is NO! First of all, how do you know if they found that spot on their own? Maybe they saw someone fishing the spot before them & decided to fish it after the first group left the area. Or, even worse, maybe they saw the first group catching fish & moved right in on them, you just don't know. Really, the proper etiquette (in my opinion) is to NOT move in on them while they are there fishing, but, once they leave if you want to try it, go ahead. You still have to be able to catch the fish yourself, and finding the exact spot they were on is not always so simple, unless you pulled right up and marked it on your gps, which would be wrong simply because no one should ever pull up that close to anyone fishing any area. I like to respect others out fishing with the same respect I would want them to give me, its really that simple! In the end, any spot on public waters are fair game for everyone, it all comes down to using a little brain power & respecting everyone else. Also if I were so worried about a spot I was fishing & didn't want anyone else fishing it, I would move out of the area for a bit until they pass by or whatever, but, in the end it really wouldn't be a big deal, there are plenty of fish in the sea! Good Luck!"
4164417,fish007,2015-08-28 10:18:00,120,the head guide where we go took a map and showed us where he fishes the first time we were there .He is very helpful and makes sure everyone is on fish even if you aren't hiring him . Before we go out each morning I ask him where they are taking clients that day so we aren't fishing the same area and we aren't stepping on their toes. There are plenty of good spots to fish without horning in on anyone.
4165681,jWN,2015-08-28 19:15:00,62,"Well like I said this post is kinda funny. With this I will say I have been to many spots for all aspects from small game hunting, deer, pheasant ect and the same with fish. Have to be blind and stupid not to learn from others, I do not care who or what you say you learned skills by watching and investigating. Weather these are structure spots of methods. I again will say I will never crowd but when you are done I am in. With that it would be a much better world than a lot of the jealousy I have seen hunting where someone just messes up the person that has figured them out only to make the member that figured them out to have to hold the spot longer due to crowding and stupidity."
4162297,LOW1,2015-08-27 14:04:00,2828,"Here's the scenario: One day on the lake you observe two people fishing at a location where you have never fished nor have ever seen anyone else fish. You observe them having considerable success. The location they are fishing is one that you would never consider fishing if you had not seen them. After they leave, you fish the spot. Pick the answer which best describes what you have just done:"
4162401,bigwalleye1,2015-08-27 14:21:00,2632,"Part of fishing is observation and reaction to various conditions/observations. I observe, gather lots of different types of information, and take action. Does it matter if I see them there, remember the spot and come back when it's not occupied or hear about it at the landing and go look at it later? Like the man said in the movie...""It's about the INFORMATION""."
4162433,tv4fish,2015-08-27 14:36:00,2694,THAT is the key statement in your scenario..............
4162465,ftfarms,2015-08-27 14:43:00,444,It's only acceptable by the fisherman that don't want to put fourth the effort of doing their own work on learning how to read water for the fish they're looking for. I know most are there for only a week; so they want to be on fish right away but thats part of it i don't even want to watch others while they're fishing don't want the temptation of knowing. I will wave and move on.
4162473,Obabikon,2015-08-27 14:45:00,2370,I agree... that isn't what we were discussing.
4162545,tv4fish,2015-08-27 15:23:00,2694,"LOW - IF you truly want to take a poll on what has been discussed - just take out ""After they leave, you fish the spot"" and insert ""You motor over close to them and start fishing."" THEN - see what you get for results........."
4162601,ziggyzag,2015-08-27 15:37:00,125,So what it appears to me that some on here feel like you should never fish a spot that you have seen someone else fishing in the past!!!!!!!!!!! COME ON MAN!! Lets say this one day you are motoring to your secret spot and low and behold there are two boats sitting there fishing are you saying that you should never return to this spot? I dont think so. I am not saying that you should pull up and start fishing I am just saying there are very few lakes if any that have secret spots left regardless what you super guides think.
4162609,Bill Krejca,2015-08-27 15:37:00,6107,"Here's my opinion: If the folks left, I cannot understand what would be wrong with trying the spot where they were. This has been an acceptable practice, in my mind, as long as I can remember. This is not horning in, or crowding out, which is not acceptable. Here's the way it works in my local area: folks are lining the river bank, and several people are getting most of the fish. As happens, especially in areas with current, the fish are not just everywhere, and in fact, are only in a small, small, small portion of the water, could be a 10 ft strip of river bank. As soon as the lucky fishermen leave, a scramble for the chosen ground begins. This is considered natural here in Ioway. It would be really odd if all the folks that were left decide that they should not ""trespass"" on the now empty sacred river bank where the stringers were filled. Another way to look at it: I would not feel upset if I left an area and another person/boat popped in. I might even feel flattered, and smile a little. Maybe a lot.... Bill"
4162633,LOW1,2015-08-27 15:45:00,2828,"Most responses agreed that crowding was always inappropriate, mine included. Therefore I removed that variable. To me crowding is wrong in a public or in a ""secret"" spot."
4162793,jWN,2015-08-27 17:16:00,62,Why would you not fish the spot?? Rather keep searching? This poll is kinda funny. Anyone here ever duck hunt on public or for that matter any public fishing or hunting. No one owns anything first come first serve. Now if it was would I fish next to them than the answer would be no.
