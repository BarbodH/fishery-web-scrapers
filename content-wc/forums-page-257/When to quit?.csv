4167793,KM1,2015-08-30 07:56:00,374,"is a GREAT thread. I just turned 58 and plan on going, at least, once every year...would like to go twice starting next year. Geez...I am hoping to get in a good 30+ more years....but you never know. Anyway...that is the plan. Been fishing LOTW since I was 7...not every year until recently...but ALWAYS loved it considering Canada fishing the very best vacation I could ever take. Do that over Europe, Hawaii, Cruse, heck...even going to the moon...LOL!!! Would love to buy a place some day up near Kenora...just love it up there."

One of the fly in's I do every year ,has brass plaques all over the bottom of the lake.These were the favorite fishing spots of the people they name. Also in the cabin,there is a growing collection of wooden plaques on the wall.One even has a small bottle of crown royal attached to it.That 2 oz of whiskey is getting older by the year.I often wonder if someone is going to drink it one day.That would be low.Drinking a dead man's last shot of rye. Bottom line is,we all have to go sometime.Fish your brains out if you can.Enjoy every breath of air.Don't sweat the small stuff.Enjoy your life."
4175049,Baseline,2015-09-02 05:33:00,3207,"Last weekend my fishing buddy and I took a 3 day trip with 4 other guys that we don't normally fish with. One of the guys brought his 85 year old dad with him who has had a very serious stroke. This guy's dad need almost constant care and assistance. He had trouble eating, moving from chair to chair and with his daily restroom requirements. It was almost impossible for him to get in an out of the boat without three or four of us assisting. After awhile it seemed that this guy was miserable and wasn't having a good time. While we all pitched in to help him out it seemed that the whole trip was focused on this guy's trip and taking care of him. While I believe that we should help people when we can there are limits. No way should this guy have gone on a remote tent camping trip to an island. A day trip to a local lake would have been much better. I really think this trip was more about his son's desires than his dad's. We are all going to get there one day and we need to know when to take ourselves out of the game and be smart enough to make the call for our friends and relatives."
4159721,Bill Krejca,2015-08-26 11:39:00,6107,"Everyone hates to think our last trip is ""our last trip"". We all know that eventually we just won't go any more, for a variety of reasons. Health problems can certainly complicate partaking. Issues connected to just driving up and carrying stuff can be overcome by beginning to take younger folks along, and well before they are needed to drive. This amounts to a pay it forward approach, and teaching them the in's and out's of the fishing game is as much fun as the doing for many of us. That's kinda what life is all about, whether it is fishing or anything else, when you think about it. It's never too late to begin. Bill"
4160089,Baseline,2015-08-26 14:33:00,3207,"My fishing buddy and I are in our early 60's. We both feel we will going until something happens that prevents it. We routinely travel way back into the bush where there is no cell service and its a 35 mile drive down a very slow gravel road to the pavement. After that it's 50 miles to the nearest medical facility. We've had some discussions about health emergencies when we are in the woods. I hope nothing happens, but both of us feel that if it does it's just the way the rod tip bounces. I hope it happens on the last day instead of the first day of the trip."
4160473,Bstar,2015-08-26 16:53:00,564,This was the first year our group took out medical travel insurance. 8 guys 45-71 years old. I'm sure we all think about something happening while we are up there but we never had a conversation about it.I'll try to go as long as my body let's me.

4161217,northernbite,2015-08-27 05:45:00,1186,"The best thing I have going to help me is my grandson. He is 16. I do things with him I didn't do with my own son. But having him along sure makes it easier unloading and carrying stuff, plus he is a pleasure to have along. He and I have had the talk of how long I go and what he expects to do going forward. The boat and the ""stuff"" will probably be his some day, so we will see. Paul"
4162233,itsme,2015-08-27 13:38:00,31,"I am back from my 41st trip to Bull Moose Camp. Next year is already planned with my two sons and a friend from N. Dakota. Without their help I could not do it. I hope all who read Walleye Central continue to find ways and help to keep fishing Canada. I have two knees, a hip replaced, gone thru open heart and prostate cancer, along with eye troubles. I talked to my Grandson about 2017 two days ago . We are a go!!! Don't let old age stop you.:"
4163273,Fish_Heads,2015-08-27 21:12:00,154,Amen to that...........Every year you don't go to Canada is a year you'll miss going !Planning on going till my son won't put up with me !If I encounter a medical problem up there & pass away I can't think of a better way to go...........enjoying one of my favorite things in life.Tie the anchor rope around my neck & toss me over.............mark the fishfinder/gps with the coordinates & jig for walleye with me the next year !Much better than having a heart attack while writing out a check to the IRS in tax season !
4163569,ogilville,2015-08-28 05:54:00,262,The least they could do would be to tie a rod and reel to your hands while you mark the spot for them!
4163769,HeHooksHimself,2015-08-28 07:10:00,725,"My BIL and I are great fishing buddies. We go with a bigger group in the spring (6 for next year at this point) and we go in the fall (13 days from now!) just the two of us. We have a verbal agreement that we will go to Canada for as many years as we can, no matter what. Well, we had a ""no matter what"" episode this past spring and he could not leave his ill and ailing wife. We went without him. Barring anything like that, we intend to go as long as we are physically able and when it gets to be a chore, we intend to take advantage of the Temple Bay Lodge bus. They can push us on our wheelchairs to the boat and we will take it from there. That's our plan, we will see how the Lord provides! Canada trips hold a high mark on the priority list."
4167369,Aspencreek,2015-08-29 20:33:00,2911,"In 1999, my father decided to take my brother, brother-in -law and I up to Canada to start a new tradition. During the trip he and I started making plans and reservations for the following year. Dad didn't make it the next year, 2 surgeries for cancer wiped out those plans for the trip in june but he insisted we go and tell him all about it. His eyes lit up when we showed him the video's and told him we had made reservations for the next year too. He passed away in Oct of 2000 never making it back up, but the tradition of toasting ""POP'S"" with a shot of Weiser's on the dock the first night at camp will never die."
4157585,northerneyes,2015-08-25 13:46:00,72,Several in our Canadian hunting and fishing party are getting up in age and each with various ailments. I was trying to put together a fishing trip for the second week of August but couldn't convince one of the members to go no matter how hard I tried. He recently had a bad stroke that would have coincided with our potential trip. Got me to wondering if we all may be getting to the point of just living on past memories. Sad to think so but at the same time I don't know how I would feel if I had talked my friend into going. I'm sure the stroke would have been fatal under those circumstances.
4157713,Bakefish,2015-08-25 14:24:00,1077,I'll quit when I feel it's gotten to be too much. There are only two of us left from the original group and we've discussed this. I feel that the long drive will be the deciding factor. Until then we are trying to make two trips a year. We are on our third year in a row doing this. I will say that the drive is definitely getting more difficult.
4157761,wallydave,2015-08-25 14:46:00,2151,"As much as we cherish our trips North, challenges do happen. For some it maybe health, time, money, the drive and simply getting a group together! Knowing your friend might have died if he had his stroke up North is a sobering reality! Each of us has to decide when to say when. Maybe scaling back on the distance and number of trips is the answer. Drive-in over fly-in? Luckily for me my last couple of trips and my next trip (9 days) have come through WC, Share a Seat, this next trip from Hidden Bay Lodge was also related to WC! I hope things work out for you!"
4158705,Stein67,2015-08-25 21:56:00,19,Our solid group of eight for the past 20 years dropped to six last year and for the first time to four this coming September. It happens. We are trying to recruit new blood or will continue with the new smaller group.
4158777,PRO-V1,2015-08-26 04:06:00,142,"Now with your groups being tight knit, fishing together for years, and knowing the medical history of one another does your groups dedicate a couple of guys for first aid, and cpr courses.? Mike"
4158993,DanM57,2015-08-26 06:29:00,135,Our group is getting older too. I am the youngster at 59 and the eldest is 78. One member of our group died from cancer last year. When he got sick we started renting a satellite phone for the trip and will continue. The only thing that might be worse that having something happen would be having something happen and not being able to get help.
4159041,northerneyes,2015-08-26 06:55:00,72,"We sometimes have a younger guys join us but our core group is made up of guys in late 60s or early 70s. We have abandoned fly in and now do drive ins. Each member of the group would be willing to continue even if it meant it could possibly end in the death of one of us while away from home. But we all realize that would be hard on our families. We also have about a 20-22 hour drive, usually straight through. The last couple of years we have gone with stopping for the night, but still a long trip. Most of us do not fish much except while in Canada. For the total experience, nothing matches up to Canada."
4159161,northernbite,2015-08-26 07:38:00,1186,"Well I make 2 trips a year up there. The spring trip is with my cousin, we live in NW Pennsylvania and travel up into the Pickle Lake area, 1800 miles. It takes us longer now and we don't fish as long of a day, but we still go. This past year it took 16 days round trip. planning for next year already. In fact my cousin just put a new motor on the StarCraft we take up there. BTW we travel in a 10 foot truck camper.Second trip in July is a camp on an island trip for 10 days. this is only 600 miles, 3 boats 6 to 8 guys. People keep changing but the 2 other people on my boat stay the same. One is my grandson and a close friend. We now drive up get a room and go into the island the next day works great.Bottom line for me, personally, is I'll go as long as I can. Don't want to see what it would be like not going. Those trips keep me going through the winter planning. When to quit, never quit!!!!!Good fishing,Paul"
4159481,strength22,2015-08-26 09:06:00,49,"Very good thread and question. I am 43 now. Been going up since I was 7. My gramps last year was when he was 92. Alzeihmers kicking in. Doubt he even remembers the trip but he went. Was tough on me. My dad passed away at 59. So I took care of gramps the whole trip. had to help him shower. Maybe it was a mistake..maybe not but was glad he got to go that last time. I also remember when I was young, 8-9, the older guys in the group brought a guy that was last stages of cancer. He never fished, They would help down to the dock and put him a lawn chair over looking the lake and would talk to groups going in and out and loved it. what he wanted to do. Think he might of fished 1 day but was just up to be a part of the group and enjoy the camp and Canada and the nature. He passed like 2 weeks later."
