We typically always go for the muskie opener so we know the area well. I believe this will be our 15th consecutive year heading up to Seul. However, we've never made it up this late in the year and are excited about the adventure. We know weather's going to be incredibly sketchy at times. Wondering if anyone's had experience this time of year with walleyes? and what particular way works best to target them? Thanks for any advice you're willing to give. John"

Awesome walleye fishing this time of year and big fish. We always hope for the surface temp to be below 50 degrees because the bigger fish seem to have their feed bags on. 5 to 7 inch minnows with 3/8 to 5/8 oz jigs depending on depth and current. usually between 16 and 30'. There have been many 100 fish per/guy days, with more than half the fish in or over the slot. Weather can be 60 or 25 degrees you never know."
