4157449,csuram,2015-08-25 13:12:00,18,"We know exactly what we like and are currently looking for another camp. Great guides are very important to us along with very nice boats. We like to fish for Muskie, Walleye, Lake Trout, Smallies, and Northern in that order. Price is not much of a factor. We like to bring our own food prime steaks etc... and would like a drive to camp, a small flight would be okay but mostly that knocks out the good guides...PLEASE HELP...."

4164945,tackleman,2015-08-28 13:36:00,444,"eagle lk has all those species, that would be my target lake. lots of lodges to choose from but vbay gord runs a good operation at vermilion bay lodge. there are several price ranges to choose from and you will want to google those camps to make an informed decision, I have fished eagle for over 20 years and seen some really big fish come out of there. this is a little one I got while fishing for walleye. just never know what is happening with your bait."

I've never caught a Musky over 47"" here, but I don't target them, so if you do you may have better luck.www.pleasantcove.comMy buddies and I have been going to this fish resort since the early 90's. It's about 3 hours north west of Toronto on Highway 400 (turns into Highway 69). If your worried about gravel, this resort is a relief. It's about 1.5 miles off the main highway, paved road all the way. Best fishing for us is always first week of May, great Pike and Smallmouth.Owner Bruce Bishop will take you out for an hour tour and show you many good spots that are easy to get to without endangering your hull. Spend $220 on a Lake Huron chip for your Chart, and you'll feel even safer.Good resort for taking family as well, has a pool, sport court, small beach, etc.Take Rapala X-Raps and Williams Wablers...Forgot to mention, you can do one day fly ins from his place as well."
