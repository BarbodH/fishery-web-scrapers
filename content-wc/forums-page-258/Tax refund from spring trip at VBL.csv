I think this is only the second time that I got a refund because I was generally given the papers to complete and didn't. Gord handled all of this and now I have money to restock the Rapalas I lost. I've never fully understood this tax and partial refund, but it does feel like free money at this point. Mike"

Not so this time! In fact, for some reason they disallowed about $25.00 of my request. I really don't mean to complain, I was just surprised. I'm heading up again on Friday so the rebate goes into our pool of money for the trip."
