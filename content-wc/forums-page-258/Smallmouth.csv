I know nothing is a guarantee, but would like recommendations for someplace where the odds are we would have pretty good action. Ideas within a couple of hours from Sioux Narrows would be ideal. Thanks for any info you could provide."

I have never personally fished there, but it has received great reviews and I have friends who have gone there in the past. There was a similar post about smallmouth fishing just last month:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=477274"

4155809,LOW1,2015-08-24 19:16:00,2828,Why not stay at Sioux Narrows? I am not sure that you would find a better spot. Hit the islands to the west of the bridge for close-in spots. Lots of lodging options. Tomahawk Resort is good and there are others in various price ranges . You could also camp at the provincial park or stay at the local motel. What kind of a place are you interested in?

It's a fly-in -- probably a 15 minute hop from Sioux Narrows. I know Young's has an outpost there, and a couple of the air services as well...From what I've read and heard, it's about as close to a sure thing as you can get for smallmouth -- with lots of muskie as a bonus. I'm hoping to get up there in the next couple of years."
