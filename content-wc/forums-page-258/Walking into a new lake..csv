So the day before yesterday we got a chance to spend some time together on my day off. We walked a portage into a lake I have been wanting to check out but had never got around to before. Jack was very excited about the ""secret lake"", and he has been chattering about our adventure for the past 2 days, needless to say fun was had! Lots of baby bass in there, we caught a pike and rumour has it there are walleye. Will have to return with more of a fishing agenda and see what I can discover.VIDEO LINKhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5MIKIOdCGo"

LOL.....I read your report...you are braver than me...we were only in the weed.Quote: Originally Posted by rnnonmtGreat video Simon. Jack cracks me up. He's such a character! Goat bones and stinky swamp dog! LOL Isn't that hilarious? I find myself just smiling away at his ramblings. He chats away to himself the whole time in a stream of consciousness kind of way, some of the stuff he comes out with is priceless. My wife has recently got one of those watches that track your steps and heart rate. The display shows a little heart symbol and them the number below that, Jack pipes up that that is ""sooooo cool, it shows how much love you have too!"""

4153025,jazzman,2015-08-23 15:28:00,13,Thanks for posting. Very enjoyable. I have many great memories of similar adventures with my boys on Canada trips. It was not always about catching fish! Now the boys are all grown up and don't seem to have the time to go with dad to Canada any more. Enjoy! These times are precious.
