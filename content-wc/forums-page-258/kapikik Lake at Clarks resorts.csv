Eagle 1 gave an excellent report on his trip there. Has anyone else fished at Kapikik Lake? Below Kaskeego falls looks amazing. Heard there were big northern in Jackpine Lake? I will certainly post a trip report for all to read but just wondering if someone had some information to share? We like fishing current and this place seems to have plenty of it for walleye... Let me know your thoughts!!! Only 1 month away, Jgar1865"
3953521,Eagle1,2015-06-10 10:11:00,28,"jgar1865, We will be there on Sunday 6/14 for a week, so I can give you an update on when I get back. We've been making trips there for quite a few years, except for the 3 year break after the fire, and we typically go there during the 2nd or 3rd week of June. Fishing might be a bit different in July than June, but I can give you some tips if you want to PM me. You'll absolutely love this lake, and the Clark's do everything top-notch! Steve"

Spent night before fly out at their Northern Lights lodge. Cool place, they run a bait catching operation so cool to look at. Buckets in the fish house had fish... Flew in next day to Kapikik. Cool lake. Never saw a single soul whilst there. No worrying somebody was fishing in your spot...16' 15hps. Went everywhere on the lake. (Even tried some unsuccessful portages...). Took us a while to figure out just how shallow these fish were. Caught majority in 4'-10'. Had to adjust our tactics. Usually fish much deeper like 12'-18'. Areas with swift current absolutely best producers. Points, islands, humps just weren't consistent. Tossing a slip bobber upstream from anchored boat and watching it flow by you...and then go under...this presentation worked well. So did just dropping a lead head straight down under the boat in the current. Did our share of drifting too. Trolling bottom bouncers not best. Mom caught biggest walleye (again...) 26"". Two of them actually. Caught many 18""-21"" Walleyes. Brother caught largest Pike 35 1/2"". Fish really came alive in the evenings. Maelstrom. Caught 1/2 doz Pike over 30"". Sneaky *******s. We had a stringer of 4 floating in the water, heard lots of commotion on the side, looked over, and now we had 3 on the stringer..."
