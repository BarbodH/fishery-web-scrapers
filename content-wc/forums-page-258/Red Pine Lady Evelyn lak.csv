You can find them on Facebook again. I just booked a week to surprise the girlfriend for her birthday... Will be good to get back there and enjoy the scenery and maybe catch some walleyes.

Used to be a couple spots you could catch some decent specks along with lots of walleye. Fishing may have changed a lot since those days long ago tho. Used to be a sign on the lake marking a spot called the ""pohole"" lol. Good walleye there. Good luck and would love to see a report with some pics."

We had some great walleye days on the lake and I was fortunate to get a big walleye or two each trip in. I hope to get back again some time. I never fished out of Red Pine but heard good things about the lodge. There were some good spots for walleye close to RP and we fished them along with the RP locals. Lady Evelyn is such a large lake and has so many different good spots to try, it should be on everyone's bucket list."

We actually got the best cabin at the resort,, right now we are the only guests for that week.. I'm bringing my boat this time and plan on spending most of my time down by garden island,, I love that area of the lake.. It's a bit of a run, but the size and numbers were always a lot better down that area of the lake.. I'll hire the guide the first afternoon we are there and have him get me into fish right away. And have him show me some different spots too fish down there besides what I already know."

4034361,micropterus,2015-07-09 14:47:00,450,"Great to see this lodge up and running again. Saved me from myself as I really thought about buying, but I'm a little too old and cranky to deal with all the s***. Will miss seeing Jim by one day. Ryan, hope you're having a good season."
4034641,alberta bum,2015-07-09 16:46:00,312,"Oh we're going to have to talk when your coming out and I'm going in. I'll be launching the black Lund.. I hope to be there when you guys are getting dropped off, although I may be a little late! Put some marks on your map and hand it over. Lol"
