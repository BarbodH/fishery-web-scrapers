Paid at the counter no problem. I have had some waits when calling the customer service but nothing near 90 minutes. Now trying to get my phone to work north of the border that's another story."

4150401,Mrnovice,2015-08-22 10:23:00,75,"Never had any issues the last 12 years. I've called every year and maybe a 3 minute conversation. Even if it took longer, oh well. I appreciate the fraud monitoring"
4150457,Jerryv,2015-08-22 10:45:00,1222,"Its been several years since I have had to call their customer service, but I don't remember waiting at all. Always carry at least two cards when traveling. You never know when a scammer could hit your card and then it is turned off for several days until they can get you a new one. Some emergency cash is good to have also. Jerry"
4150481,dragonsm,2015-08-22 10:49:00,143,"I think this could probably go for any card. I do have a cabela's card as a personal also and just this past year have made two trips to Australia. Both times I contacted them ahead of time let them know where my layovers would be and limits on purchases....Maybe 5 minutes tops from start to finish on the phone...always very nice individual helping me from the midwest. Last trip my business card was compromised in LAX, and about a month later I ""purchased"" 3 grand of electronics from Target in Omaha and then had doughnuts in New York that afternoon. Man, I wish I could travel that quick! All covered by the card. To me, a little extra ""time"" or security of potential card being locked down is a non-issue....glad they are looking out for me. About 5 years ago, my cabela's card # was compromised and they locked down a purchase of syringes (large quantity box) in CA....seeing that my purchases from earlier in the day/week were in the midwest and I have never purchased diabetic supplies in the past...the transaction was flagged....they called for confirmation of the purchase on my cell...which I denied...and they closed the account and sent a new card my way which I had in days.

I do use my credit card in MN, however I carry cash for Canada, don't know why, but that is the way I go. Old fashion. We also have a kitty for gas and other group expenses. My wife did not tell me till last year, that MasterCard called every year to ask if I was in Minnesota. I appreciated that they checked up on the card."
4154513,LOW1,2015-08-24 09:02:00,2828,"Does Cabelas even have anything to do with a Cabelas credit card other than to license its name to whatever bank issued the card? In my experience credit cards change security practices, service companies, etc with some frequency. Always call ahead if you will be leaving your country or even if you are leaving your state or doing something else other than your regular routine. I don't think its people making the decision to accept or refuse ""unusual"" charges, just part of the automated process."

I do not even remember if it was $15, $ 20 or $25.This is not the first time this has happened...but I think it will be the last time.I have had the Cabela's Visa since the inception of the card. I may be changing to another Visa Card."
4148273,Kansas Bound,2015-08-21 13:42:00,152,"Just a heads up for anyone leaving the country with a Cabelas Credit card. Make sure you have at least another form of payment. 5 days before I leave for our annual Canada fishing trip I make a call to the customer service center to inform them I am leaving the country so please do not shut off the card. I was on hold for 20 minutes till I got through and then had about 10 minutes worth of questions about where I was going and what I was buying. Maybe I am impatience in my old age but it bugged me I had to take 30 minutes of my day to inform them I was leaving the country. We head north on our trip. I buy gas in SD and then again at the ND boarder. We cross the boarder and keep heading north and need gas again in Canada. DECLINED. I thought maybe my CC was messed up. I am now in Canada with limited funds since I use a check to pay the lodge and my Cabelas CC to pay for fuel. I have a little bit of loonies but the hit on the exchange rate fees at the border limit my cash funds. I call the fraud department from my Verizon cell phone and am on hold for 30 minutes before they inform me the wait is too long and to try again later, CLICK. I am just fuming mad at this point because we just want to go fishing. I call customer service and luckily they are not closed for the night yet but I am placed on hold for over 60 minutes before a lady answers. She informs me that I never called to tell them I was leaving. I informed her that was not the case and then she says oh it just popped up in my notes! She turns my card back on for me and says sorry. Lesson learned from me. Carry cash or two cards and make sure one of them is not a Cabelas Card. I have not received my Verizon bill to see I get charged 80 cents a minute (times 90 minutes) for calling Cabelas?? I just want other people to avoid my frustration."
4148521,Shellback,2015-08-21 15:17:00,8083,"I always use my Cabelas card in Canada, and call them ahead of time to let them know. Never had a problem as you did. I'm heading up again on the 2nd. I think I'll call them now, and check with them before I leave to make sure it's authorized."
4148593,Shellback,2015-08-21 15:46:00,8083,"From on hold, to completing the call with C/S, it was 14 minutes and 32 seconds. I'll check again next week to be sure they have me listed as being in Canada. Never used to take that long."

No foreign transaction fee and 10,000 mile bonus each year when I hit a certain spend level (I have all of my monthly bills tagged to the card and pay it off each month, so it's easy to hit the spend level). United flies to Winnipeg and Saskatoon, so I fly 'free' on miles (25-35k) each year from DFW for my annual trip. Customer service and fraud prevention is great. Plus two passes a year to the United Club in case of delays or long layovers. Never any problems with it in Canada..."
