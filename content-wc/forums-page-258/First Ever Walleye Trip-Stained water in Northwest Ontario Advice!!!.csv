4143889,LLewellin,2015-08-20 05:40:00,1790,"I was at Women Lake Lodge July11-18. We had very good fishing. The owner is a great guy and will help you get on the current bite but I would think it would be similar to ours. The first couple of days we pounded them with gold jigs tipped with a minnow or tipped with a 3""power bait grub pumpkin seed color. The next few days we hammered them with a slip sinker/swivel and then attached a bright colored orange spinner. Once again ask Greg the owner and he will show you what is working. If you are looking for pike our best color plastic was by far white. Seemed no matter where i threw that white color i would catch pike especially in Mosser 1 Lake. Do you have a portable sonar/GPS combo unit? If you do it does help. Have a great trip!"
4147385,bigdaddyguns,2015-08-21 06:28:00,608,"I suggest taking up a marker buoy or two. Walleye can be schooled pretty tight to particular structure this time of year so a marker is a good tool to keep you in the fish zone, even with GPS."
4142417,GBPB,2015-08-19 15:26:00,19,"First Ever Walleye trip..Stained water in Northern Ontario advice!!! We are headed to the Woman River System the first of September. Mainly Big Woman Lake. I think we are pretty well set although Lindy Rigs and Crawler harnesses are a little intimidating for a guy that normally bass fishes. I do know the water will be stained. You guys got any last minute advice for a newbie. Someone said Glow in the Dark Jig heads but I've never seen them before....or even where to get them.Thanks in advance. I had posted this in the ""Strictly Fishing"" section as well and got some great feedback. One of the guys thought I should try in the Canada section as well."
4142585,dan cardinal,2015-08-19 16:03:00,64,"Being a bass fisherman you problem know how to fish a jig. I would highly recommend going on line to Cabelas or Kruger Farms... check out VMC Moon Eye Jigs in 1/8, 1/4, and 3/8 ounce. They come in a variety awesome colors. Glow works... but it doesn't require glow. Good colors are Chartreuse, Chartreuse Glow, White, Glow white, Orange... and combinations of all three colors. I use pink too. You can tip these with a minnow or crawler. You can also enjoy success with 4 and 5"" jerk shads on a jig. I love the Zman Jerk ShadZ... I order those through Tackle Warehouse. But there are a number of plastics that will work. 3"" Kalin twister tails work well. At Cabelas you will find a plastic made by BFISHN Tackle... it's called a Moxi...in 3"" and 4"". It's a great plastic as well. Plastic colors... white, chartreuse, green, yellow, orange...they all work. My favorite color... pearl. You can tip these with a crawler or minnow as well... especially when the bite slows down. I am a bass fisherman too. My bass fishing gear is strictly casting gear. But I jig for walleye with a ML spinning outfit...6# and 8# test. you will love jigging them! Enjoy your first trip. My guess is... it won't be your last."
4142961,GBPB,2015-08-19 18:14:00,19,"Thanks Dan! Very helpful. So are you casting when you jig and letting it go to bottom or just letting line out to bottom and drifting. I would almost think you would use the 4-5"" plastic like a plastic worm?ThanksGary"
4142993,law57,2015-08-19 18:21:00,1147,"The lake I live on is very heavily stained. I don't make any attempt to use 'special' jigs. A friend and I were out last Monday - I was using unpainted jigs with a red hook. Why? Because the unpainted ones don't have a glob of paint in the eye that has to be removed. I'm sure I out-fished him. You don't have to spend a fortune on new jigs - ""dance with the girl that brung you"". I think size is more important than color in stained water or any other water. Bring some 1/16 and 1/8 oz - smaller is better in rocks. Rigging with a small/medium spinner is good advice in stained water. It's good advice in gin clear water too.Work on finding fish - they are the same regardless of water color. They will respond to the windy side of rock humps and points. They will follow a spinner by the sound... etc.Keep it simple - you don't need hundreds of dollars of tackle. You need to find feeding fish - they will eat what ever you offer them.Relax, have fun"
4143001,Aspencreek,2015-08-19 18:27:00,2911,"That time of year the walleye are putting on the feed bag, don't fish to deep, in heavy stained water the sun won't drive them deep. 14' up to 2' along weed edges and depth breaks. Points with a sharp drop off to one or both sides are prime and if you can find the mid-lake humps you are on the money."

4143505,dan cardinal,2015-08-19 20:48:00,64,"[QUOTE=GBPB;4142961]Thanks Dan! Very helpful. So are you casting when you jig and letting it go to bottom or just letting line out to bottom and drifting. I would almost think you would use the 4-5"" plastic like a plastic worm? Thanks I never cast. Depends on the depth I am fishing. Deeper water 15+ , I normally mark fish first then drop down to them. I will place the motor in reverse and hold position. Somtime fishing a large structure holding lots of walleye I will go with a slow back troll, drop my jig attempting to keep my line as vertical as possible. When I have covered the zone, I take the motor out gear and drift through the same zone. Sometimes they are finicky.... they want it on the drift. If very active I catch them on the backtroll and the drift. Sometime you can hold the boat in position and continue to hammer them. Shallow weeds or shallow water humps usually call for slow backtroll... again dropping jig down with as vertical presentation I can achieve, then just cover water. You can utilize a pitching technique too if you want to cover very shallow targets. Keep in mind light jigs in the shallow zones. I typically use a 1/4 ounce for 10 to 20 depths. 3/8 for 30 foot or deeper. 1/8 works for shallow rocks and weeds. But can also work calm days for deeper not so active fish.... more a finesse presentation. The VMC jig is more than color. It hss a great hook, and the wire keeper is the best for holding plastics. That time of year you should discover an aggressive bite much of the time. You will have a blast."

4143857,Bill Krejca,2015-08-20 05:26:00,6107,"Pick up some Superglue to hold the plastic on. Sometimes a fish will hit, not get hooked, and partially pull off the bait - it usually results in significantly subdued action, and they may not hit again. Also, I believe gluing makes the bait just last longer, resulting in more fish/bait. Have fun! Bill"
