I've seen other posts refer to government web sites with scientific readings on water levels and such but I'm afraid they were beyond me. Rain in & around St. Louis has been really heavy since spring, the lakes and rivers have been way up all year. Thanks"
4102273,DeBo,2015-08-04 14:44:00,211,I am heading there at the end of August. Water levels are pretty normal on LOTW or slightly below normal. Certainly far different from last year! I was at Sabaskong out of Morson 3 weeks ago and it was a different lake from my 1st trip in July 2014. Have not heard any first hand reports from Whitefish Bay but PM me in early September if you want an update. I will be there with my Fiance and we will be fishing for Muskies out of Whitefish Bay Camp.
4156729,Bluenorth,2015-08-25 08:02:00,1,New to the board here and also searching for some suggestions for the Sioux Narrows area. I am going up with my wife and 2 Catholic Nuns that are just excited about the adventure and yet I know would love to hook something. (I know it sounds like a joke coming . I am hoping to put them on anything that might be biting and not requiring great casting skills. Since there are 4 of us it may be tough to all be together in a guide boat. Thoughts appreciated.
