I was all set to join my twin brother and several other friends this year for the Opener when a serious family health situation arose, so I stayed in Ohio with family while my twin brother, and two of my Ohio Buckeye friends went to CPR for the Opener.....they did have a great time.... Here's the video......we fish whether the sun is out or it's snowing.....eh ?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K18KTMW15VQ Rich B"
4138257,SinOrSwim,2015-08-18 10:33:00,1528,That is awesome! Some nice fish. One big one must have gotten away at about the 8:20 mark eh?
4138321,Bakefish,2015-08-18 10:43:00,1077,"Great video. Snow in the boat. Man, makes me cold just watching it."
4148161,rockape,2015-08-21 12:21:00,215,Great video. I've fished out of CPR the last two years the 3rd week of June. Interesting to see it a month earlier. Nice Musky!

But just a helpful hint... that will save you some cash if the CO's are ever out when you are fishing opening weekend again on Cedar ..Musky season is closed then and even though you are accidentally catching them and that is not a issue .. The law states that you cannot take them out of the water ..For any reason .. unsure of the fines, but the infractions are very clear on your video and possible pictures that they may have taken.Just a heads up ..Love the video though and Ord creek can be totally amazing that time of the year ;-)"
4152649,Rich B,2015-08-23 11:44:00,1081,"Appreciate your comments.....I'll pass them along to my group....you are correct that we have never targeted Musky, though have caught a few over the years during the Opener....we will be sure to leave the Musky in the water and release them boat-side (or often is the case, a distance from the boat - ha). Glad you enjoyed the video.....kind of hard to explain to the family and friends why we pack the insulated Guide-wear along side the golf shirts and shorts for Opener week....you just never know what weather will blow in on any given day.
