The wildlife on this trip trumped our previous years with two black bears, one wolf, two caribou, several moose and loads of bald eagles. The fishing was outstanding with numbers in the 100s per person each day. We probably could've hit even hire fish numbers had we sat in a few marked areas we found, however we feel hunting for new spots and depths is part of the day to day. Largest walleye was 26"", multiple 23-25"" and 100s of 18 - 22""s. Largest northern was 38"". This was the only spot of very little disappointment. Usually a 40""+ is caught on these waters. All large walleye were caught in 30' of water. Yellow, green and white 1/4 jigs where the hot bait. Match those colors with a twister tail was high productive too. On our way home 8.20.15 between Ear Falls and Vermilion there was a big problem with a northbound truck that lost its boat/trailer and missed our vehicle by feet. Its the first time I've even seen a truck lose its trailer. The boat/trailer unhitched doing 60mph into the westside of the ditch. There were several other vehicles that witnessed this accident and i've love to hear the outcome. Im hopeful no one was hurt. I asked a question months ago which season they prefer to fish between spring and late summer/fall. Its honestly a toss up for me. The weather was very similar with highs in the upper 60s and lows in the low 50s. We experienced a few rain storms but nothing that prevented us from fishing. The largest difference is the depth in which we catch fish. The #s caught were essentially the same. If you like catching fish in 5-15' then spring is your season. If you would prefer a longer fight then the late summer and fall when catching fish in 30' is your season. July is the month i probably wouldn't plan a trip simply because I prefer cooler temps than warmer temps. Lodo"
