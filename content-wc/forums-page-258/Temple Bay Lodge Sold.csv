4157825,Bakefish,2015-08-25 15:22:00,1077,I gotta believe that lodge made some good money over the years. The bus service was a brilliant idea that opened up the Canadian fishing experience to many people who wouldn't have otherwise had the chance. Not sure how the locals or other lodges felt about it. That would be an interesting discussion.
4157865,NWwalleye,2015-08-25 15:44:00,223,Lodge has been up and running smoothly with the new owners for the past 2 year .Nothing has changed as to the way the business operates ..I think the bus and other amenities are exactly the same..I haven't seen any difference ..
