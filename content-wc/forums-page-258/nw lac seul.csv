4149601,bigwillies,2015-08-21 22:56:00,515,haven't been up for a few weeks but fishing should be good. make sure your boat is covered good. the contruction on the 105 is messy with no pavement. let us know how fishin was and the construction
4151441,tlars,2015-08-22 20:31:00,137,Traveled 105 yesterday. The construction coated ny Crestliner and white pickup with road crud that was difficult to get off. Power washed tonight. Some kind of hand cleaning is on the docket for tomorrow. They're spraying the road with something to keep the dust down. Rumor is that it was water. Not so sure about that. The bottom line-the Lac Suel fishing was worth a dirty boat and truck. Thanks to the folks at Fisherman's Cove.
4155025,tm2,2015-08-24 13:37:00,5,How far south on 105 was the construction? How was the fising?
4156665,tlars,2015-08-25 07:22:00,137,"South of Dutchies. Probably 15 miles long - give or take. Lac Seul fishing is always better that we deserve. We found a deep rock bite, a sand bite and a weed bite all in the same week due to variable weather. No piggies. Lots of overs up to 27. Jig and minnow."

Appeared to be ground up tar based old road surface material watered down on the road. Watering made it like a paste. I stopped at a semi trailer wash which did remove the majority."
