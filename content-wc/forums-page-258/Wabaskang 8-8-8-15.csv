This trip could be summed up as a great walleye trip for us. I caught walleye literally every place that we tried to on the ""big lake"" with spots such as Devil's, Doe, No Name, Birch, and Cedar Islands all loaded with numbers. The size was kind of small in my opinion with a ton of 14 and 15 inch fish available. We caught most of these eaters in 22 to 26 feet of water with jig/minnow or lindy rig. When we finally decided to fish areas in the middle lake, Jim's, and McCloud, the size increased dramatically. We ended up with a 29.5, 29, 28, and a few 25s. My buddy and his dad used a rental boat and had a 29, 28, 27, and a few others in the 25 inch range. All of these fish were caught using lindys and minnows or lindys with crawlers on drop offs in the 25 to 26 foot range. We had a blast and am glad that we didn't just settle for catching numbers and did some exploring for bigger fish. The lesson I learned was that these big fish are not hanging with small ones. If you are catching 14s and 15s, leave, find another rock reef until you find the bigger ones. We got lucky to stumble on the right ones for once! I anticipate the fishing in big lake to improve drastically with the weather change that's happening and some bigger fish will be more readily available and willing to bite. Northern bite was pretty slow due to high water temps but again I think that will improve next week. I will have a good report hopefully after next weeks trip. Good luck out there! Mike"

We were new to the lake also but thanks to a lot of you readers e-mailing me with info we were able to eliminate a lot of unproductive water. Fishing was slow due to weather being warm up there. Last day the water temp finally dipped below 70 and the bite improved. Had plenty of fish to eat and brought limits home, marked fish basically everywhere we went and did some plain old lake exploration. Best lures were minnow and jig or spinner and crawler with the crawler being preferred. Sleepy dog was fantastic, the cabins are incredible in design, size and creative lay out. The boats are super to fish out of 17.5 outfitters with 40 hp Yamahas and livewells. You can be on any spot in the lake in 30 -45 minutes. Definitely will be back!"
