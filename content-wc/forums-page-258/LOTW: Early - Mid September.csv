I've been to the lake dozens of times, but always been in May, June, July....this would be something totally new to me. I've searched through the archives and have found mostly positive reviews of this time period (i.e. less pressure, less bugs, beautiful colors, schooling walleye, potential for good musky fishing). Needless to say i'm excited, the weather seems like it has the potential to turn nasty quickly and much greater chance for high winds is the only negative i'm seeing at this point. I guess I just wanted to see if anyone had any other opinions or advice for that section of the lake from Labor Day through September this year? We will be targeting primarily Walleye and plan to do some Musky/Big Northern fishing. I'm figuring we will encounter quite a few smallies while jigging for walleyes on reefs as well. Crappie/Perch or Lake Trout could be other options as well, even though i haven't put in much time with those species in the past. Thanks for any thoughts guys. it looks like the water is starting to cool already and things are definitely starting to look more fall like."

Bigger lures seem to go hand in hand with big walleye come Sept. I have observed several instances of the largest walleye in camp being caught incidentally by the Musky fisherman this time of year.If the current cooler weather persists you may see them venture along weedlines during low light but I wouldnt start my hunt there. As for musky, look off rock reefs and points..... points strewn with large boulders are your friends. Throw your cowbells, cranks and jerk baits. Little early to troll in earnest but I plan on an hour or two daily pulling some 10""-12"" cranks.Dunno about it being fall yet, but this cool weather sure starting to smell like big fish. I enjoy this period and have another trip booked mid Oct.....thats fall Musky weather."
4141865,tjandy,2015-08-19 12:06:00,107,I'm headed up to the Nestor Falls area on Friday. Thanks for the info.
4142873,lassh,2015-08-19 17:39:00,553,Zeebee- it sounds like you have been infected with the musky bug... Back to the original poster- My experiences are the same as Zeebee's. Walleyes will be moving deeper and muskies in rocks or deeper water adjacent to rocks. Smallies are found in similar areas as the eyes usually a few feet shallower.
