In a nutshell, the facilities were REALLY nice, my family loved the place!The boat I fished out of was also pretty incredible - a brand new 16' Lund Fury with full floor, pedestal seats, livewell and a brand new 25hp 4 stroke Merc. Esnagi is almost 30 kilometers long so having a comfy fast boat was huge!Fishing wise we dealt with intense heat and little wind for the first half of the trip and still caught fish consistently although not crazy numbers. It was however shockingly good for average size. We caught a lot of thick girthy walleyes in the 24-28"" range with my 8 year old son Brendan catching the largest, a 30.5 inch 10.5 pound behemoth. If you're interested in reading the full write up you can see it here. Suffice it to say it was a great trip and we'd all love to go back again one day!http://www.canadafishingguide.net/th...-eighty-eight/"

Fly in or drive in. That is awesome! Oh, and you lost the bet. LOL I heard you say if you were a betting man you though it was a 26 or 27"" walleye. Man, what a nice fish."
4147785,Mike Borger,2015-08-21 09:18:00,1554,Thanks! And you're right I lost the bet LOL!

Looked like Zoey had a good trip as well, even met new friends in Cassie and Bitsy. Lol So many key elements to your trip... Bacon Wrapped Walleye, the incredible dock fishing at Lodge 88, portage trip, and Brandon and the girls catching skads of quality walleye. Well done! The shore lunch was completely off the charts. You could tell on the video that you were feeling a bit stressed on feeding that many people when you were trying to catch eater walleyes that morning. Feeding your crew and the staff of 88 was awesome and the walleye looked great. I'm sure that you were honored to do it I've got to say that I'm completely impressed with the staff, boats and facilities of Lodge 88. They took great care of your party and were smart enough to take to embrace what you bring to the table. That Black Fury and the rest of their boats looked awesome and their facilities were impressive. Susan and Maureen seem like lotsa fun and the food looked great. This is the camp I would check out if I lived on the eastern side of the continent."
