4145985,law57,2015-08-20 15:00:00,1147,"Some years ago my elderly father forgot some type of heart med. I called his pharmacist and he said it was important that dad have the med. He called the Walmart pharmacy in Dryden and they would not fill it. I was afraid I was going to have to run back to I-Falls to get it filled. First I went to the Dryden clinic - I think it was on the advice of the pharmacy . I got in to see a doctor who understood the situation and prescribed the med - then Walmart filled it. The clinic would not take any payment for this - they had no facilitate to accept payment. From this experience I'd say, unless things have changed, you won't get your script filled in Canada. Maybe it depends on the med - this was some type of blood thinner. The rest of the story... This whole episode took most of the day. When I got back to camp everyone was fishing - except dad. He was on his bed with his glasses on, mouth open, spread-eagle. I thought he was dead. Turns out he and another guy openned a bottle of VO and started playing cribbage. Dad was out cold - I'm running around to get his meds and he's drinking and playing cards... His response? ""Don't tell your mother about this"". He was a good old man and I miss him every single day."
4146017,CycloneWalleyeHunter,2015-08-20 15:05:00,18,I need to take Percocet and Prednisone on my trips to Canada. I just make sure they are in the original bottles and I get a copy of the prescription from the pharmacy just in case.
4146113,Bill Krejca,2015-08-20 15:34:00,6107,"Most of us ""more mature"" types take some kind of medication. A border search on about any car going through would likely find some kind of legal medication. My take on this is that it is expected. What person who needed prescriptions would leave them at home? Bill"
4146185,SinOrSwim,2015-08-20 15:50:00,1528,Meet me in the back alley of the pharmacy. Knock and say.......the crow flies at midnight.........wait for instruction.
4145409,IaDave,2015-08-20 11:11:00,476,Is it legal to bring them across the border if in original container. I had a hip replaced in June and would like to bring them when I head up in 2 weeks just in case I dislocate it. I doubt I will need them but if that happens all the beer in Canada won't handle that pain.
4145425,bigwalleye1,2015-08-20 11:21:00,2632,"So long as they're in the bottle from the pharmacy wit the contents identified and your name on the bottle, can't see how it would be a problem. I'd take a week's supply, though,not the whole bottle. Worst case, get a letter from your doc in advance identifying the med, the dosage, and the reason."
4145537,Hawkfan,2015-08-20 12:10:00,237,"I don't remember ever being asked if we had any prescriptions with us, but if you have it in the labeled prescription vial you should be OK. Just like at the airport. I took some once when I had a bulging disc and the thought of sitting in a boat for hours each day and didn't think twice about it."
4145609,SinOrSwim,2015-08-20 12:35:00,1528,"You should be fine. I take a couple prescriptions and have taken old pain killers and antibiotics with me just in case and I just throw them all in the same bottles. Never ever been asked about prescription drugs. ** I was going to make a crack about MorganMan taking his Viagra with him but we usually share a room. LOL Nevermind, that joke wasn't funny!!!!!! Also, this is not professional advice. lol A pharmacist telling you to throw them all in the same bottle."
4145617,larry0418,2015-08-20 12:43:00,16,We got pulled in once and I had a few Vicodin with me. They never asked if we had any RXs but when they found them they only verified whose they were and they were in the original bottle. Was not a problem.
4145657,LOW1,2015-08-20 12:56:00,2828,It would be interesting to find out if you could avoid the issue and save a few bucks by just taking the prescription and having it filled in Canada. RXs in original bottles should not be an issue.
4145713,SinOrSwim,2015-08-20 13:26:00,1528,"If you take two vehicles, put them in teh other vehicle. You will be FINE! And, easy LOW1. Buy American drugs (sorry Gord). From locally owned small town pharmacies!!! LOL (this was just a joke btw)"
4145841,btmbncr,2015-08-20 14:09:00,492,I took mine meds along for my bad discs.No problem at the border.Bill
4145937,IaDave,2015-08-20 14:49:00,476,Hey Sin what does a 5 mg Percocet go for now? I still have about 60 left and I thought about heading down south and selling- of course I'm only joking.
4145969,Golden Eagle,2015-08-20 14:57:00,2642,I won't be telling anybody what I might have in my medicine bag. Lots of addicts out there might go to practically all costs to take them from the owner.
