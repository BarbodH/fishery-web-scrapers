4150705,SinOrSwim,2015-08-22 13:20:00,1528,"I'm assuming most people are using go pros? Do you use the go pro software, a different video editor? If you use go pro software, is there a tutorial somewhere where I can learn how to add descriptions to each clip within the movie and music? The actual video part is easy but the other stuff seems more complicated. Granted, I haven't done much with it yet. And, I use windows. I'm assuming some will say......get a MAC. lol"
4150729,adempsey,2015-08-22 13:34:00,963,I use Corel Video Studio sometimes. There are plenty of free editors you can use. Windows comes with Windows Movie Maker which is fine.A lot of people use Sony Vegas Pro because it's easy to get illegal copies of it.
4150761,pjshorthorn,2015-08-22 15:01:00,5654,"The video I just posted of our trip to Vermilion Bay Lodge was done using Windows Movie Maker. It allows you to do everything that you've mentioned. If you haven't seen my video, take a look. ( use the search function and try PjShorthorn or Vermilion Bay Lodge as a way to find the post ) and if it captures what you want to do I would be happy to walk you through what I did. PjShorthorn."

4151721,Limeyangler,2015-08-23 05:26:00,563,"LOL....GET A MAC! But failing that, windows movie maker and the Gopro Studio software are both good programs for beginners on a PC. Just enter Gopro Studio or Windows Movie Maker into the Youtube search bar and hundreds of video tuorials covering what you want and more come up for both those programs."
4151825,birddogger,2015-08-23 06:16:00,43,"I have used windows live moviemaker and it worked out well, I even dubbed some music background. On the other hand I found Go Pro studio very,very difficult to use. That was a couple of years ago so now it may have changed."
4152129,rnnonmt,2015-08-23 08:23:00,992,I just started taking video and creating movies. I have the goPro hero 3 silver and I'm using the free Gopro studio. I had a little bit of struggles with it at first but now it is fairly easy for me.
4152577,bigdaddyguns,2015-08-23 11:19:00,608,I have used Sony Vegas / Movie Studio for the last 7 years after many years experimenting with many video editors. SVMS provides about 95% of functionality I need. Allows very detailed editing and input/output file format capabilities like support for full 1920x1080-60p material. I have been using version 12 for several years now as I found version 13 taking a turn for the worse. Probably migrate to Vegas Pro 14 at a later date.
