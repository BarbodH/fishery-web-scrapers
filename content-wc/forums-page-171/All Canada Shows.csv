5947706,jiggy08,2018-01-15 08:21:00,6,"Thats good. The shows have really seemed to slow down over the years. I remember when they had a few floors in the convention centers. 100,000 people going instead of 8-10k. Im surprised they don't do an All Canada show in MSP like they once did. Do you think the All Canada shows are the best ones out there or the only ones out there?"
5947754,That Minnesota guy,2018-01-15 08:36:00,8293,"The problem is the big venues like the convention center charge to much for booth rentals. Thats how you end up with guys selling mops and wallets. The convention center can't fill with resorts, lodges, boats or whatever so they bring the other slop in to fill in. Thats how you end up with shows at smaller venues like Blaine and the Muskie show in a college. The smaller venues will be more pure but there are less booths also. BTW, parking was $12 in the church lot and the ticket was $14 to get into the boat show."
5947890,Obabikon,2018-01-15 09:00:00,2370,"It's nice that All Canada shows parking is free... at least it is in Green Bay and Chicago. In my opinion, that helps the attendance, and the entire attitude of the show. Shows are changing, that's for sure. But, I honestly don't care if there's 30,000 or 2,000. It all has to do with how many people out of the attendance are actually looking to book trips. All Canada shows do not have the attendance that some of the big shows have, but they have a much higher percentage of ""booking"" guests. Which is the real goal. I have a lot of people who are booked or seriously thinking about booking with us... come up to the show to discuss their trip. It is just another service. If you're a new guest, it is nice to have a face to face. If you're a return guest, it is still easier to do everything in person. There certainly is still value in attending shows. Even if that value isn't all in new sales."
5947922,That Minnesota guy,2018-01-15 09:09:00,8293,"I'd say there is bigger RISK in not attending (as a resort) and falling off the radar so to speak. It's a catch 22 thing. Are you booked up because of shows, or will you fill up anyway? I know a guy who was full so he quit going to shows. Now he isn't filling up anymore. I gotta think as old customers quit coming he has no way of getting new guys. I will say this....I won't book a trip without first meeting the resort (and hopefully the owner) at a show. I dunno."
5947954,pjshorthorn,2018-01-15 09:26:00,5654,"The other option is to take some time and do a ""boat in or drive in"" interview with a prospective lodge owner at their own place vs. a show. On three occasions I have stopped in to visit a lodge while fishing the same body of water or driving by a lodge on the way to my destination that year. I have booked many trips with two out of the three lodges I visited in that manner. The only reason I haven't booked a trip at the third lodge is that I haven't had a chance to go back and fish on that lake since my boat in visit. In all three cases, I had a chance to look at the facilities, boats and talk with folks at the lodge including guests staying there. I don't know if you can get more of a reality check than that, but that is just my perspective. PjShorthorn"
5947994,That Minnesota guy,2018-01-15 09:34:00,8293,"Good point PJ. My camper is only 30 miles from the Canadian border. I wanted to book a trip to a lodge I had heard about on a different web site. So one rainy day I decided to drive over and take a look at the resort. At the border I was asked 3 times why I was REALLY going into Canada. The concept of going to look at a lodge was completely lost on the border guard. It wasn't until I told him I was only 30 miles away and not the 250 miles my address would indicate did he kinda get it. Anyway, I visited the resort and wanted a bit more then they had to offer. So I drove down the road and found another one. That was what I had in mind and I booked right on the spot. But the point is, f you don't want to end up disappointed you need to do a bit of homework and not just rely on some stranger on a fishing web site."
5948138,jiggy08,2018-01-15 10:05:00,6,"Nothing better than option of driving to the resort and looking around or getting to talk to guests that are on their trip! Unfortunately, hard to do for a Flyin Lodge. Since the MSP all Canada show ended, that was the end of shows for me. Our group looked on the internet and found a place that has been in operation for 30 plus years with the same family running it. Not that new operations are bad. We felt it was a safer bet to go somewhere that hasn't gone out of business in 3 decades. We called and had a nice conversation with the owner and they were always quick to respond to emails. These are things I look for in anyone I do business with. If you can't answer an email or phone message in a day, how responsive will you be while Im at your outpost!! I agree that it is a risk for these lodge owners not going to shows. I see the benefit of having the right kind of people walking around vs warm bodies in the building. I think a lodge that takes time/money to build a great website like has been discussed in other threads on here, can be a great operations as well vs an outdated 5 page site. Anyways, little thread drift here, but Im glad the show was a good time. Hope you had a few Blue's!!!"
5948458,NARDA 1,2018-01-15 11:36:00,636,"I agree with Obabikon, while the numbers of attendees appeared to be down at the Pheasant Run Chicago Show the number of ""booking"" guests was up. We also had a number of guests tell us they would not book without a face to face. We also discussed the show dates, and while they have been having the Pheasant Run Show for over 20 years that I know of, on the 2nd weekend in January, we wonder if it would be beneficial to move the show into February to avoid the conflict with Football Playoff games. The attendance died way down while the games were on, even without local teams in contention."
5927362,Aspencreek,2018-01-03 15:21:00,2911,"Ob, do you go to stay in touch with regulars, to possibly fill in open spots, go just because you might be more conspicuous by your absense, or any other reason? We talked about 10 yrs ago at the Madison show, the cost of doing these shows has got to be getting high vs the good it may do for your business. Just wondering......."
5927522,Obabikon,2018-01-03 16:12:00,2370,"It's a little of everything you mentioned. First, I expect to book a minimum of 3-4 new groups at every show. If I book one new group of 3, it pays for the show itself. Plus, we have an incredibly high return rate, so if that ""new group"" makes more than one trip, we profit. Every resort is going to be different, and will have their best marketing techniques. I was a business admin major in college, and my dad raised me in the business. I enjoy the personal touch of face to face selling. I also enjoy the personal touch of running a family type resort. I take guests out to dinner regularly at the shows, and it is great to just spend some time with good friends. For us, it has gotten to the point where it is more about all the friendships we've made over the years, and less about selling. Seems like sales come on their own."
5928242,Aspencreek,2018-01-03 19:55:00,2911,"Makes sense, thanks. I used to have to run shows and displays for a former job and I know how much these things cost and what you have to budget for, not counting the time and effort it takes to put on a good show. Good luck and have fun, wear some good comfortable shoes."
5928706,Lake Wisconsin,2018-01-04 07:25:00,1960,"What a concept, eh? I think if more places ran businesses like this, we would all be better off."
5928786,Obabikon,2018-01-04 08:04:00,2370,"Thank you. Every business and every resort is going to be different though. A lot will depend on where they are with their ""plans"". If they're just starting out, they might need to focus on sales pitches/wheeling and dealing. If they're at a comfortable level of guests... they can focus more on improvements or atmosphere. I guess what I'm saying is don't be too tough on someone who runs things differently. Operating a fantastic resort can be done in many different ways."
5938546,muskyman73,2018-01-10 01:24:00,401,Jared makes running his island look easy. See ya in 5 months and 21 days dude. I can hardly wait !
5939450,Obabikon,2018-01-10 11:52:00,2370,"See you then! You're going to be on the island with my crazy family. There's an ""Amason Reunion"" that week... so you guys won't even be the worst behaved guests on the island! HAHAHAHA"
5942554,Duflebag,2018-01-12 07:34:00,218,"Funny, i am in the booth next to Obabikon. Nice seeing Walleye Central members at the show yesterday that i have not met before. They were going to visit with Obabikon. Looking forward to meeting other members I have not met. It is nice to put a face to a name. I know NARDA1 is at the Birchdale Lodge booth also."
5947506,jiggy08,2018-01-15 07:05:00,6,How was the turn out?
5947610,Obabikon,2018-01-15 07:47:00,2370,"I think it was down a little bit as to total traffic, probably more weather related than anything. However, there were a ton of people traveling this summer... which is a good sign."
5914554,BornToFish,2017-12-27 09:55:00,1224,"Greetings,I checked the website for the All Canada Show series and realized that the show in Green Bay, WI is just over three weeks away. I'm not sure, but believe the show in the Chicago area is the previous week. I like to attend these shows to visit with my friends, reminisce about past trips and dream of future trips. Will you be taking in any of these All Canada Shows? If so, what might you be looking to achieve at the show?Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5914586,Ricky Spanish,2017-12-27 10:17:00,1298,"We'll be at the Green Bay show on Sat, 1/20. My main reason for going is to visit with our friends from the lodge we go to each June. Last year, we booked a room for the night, and we all had dinner and drinks after the show closed. We sat in on a couple seminars, picked up a few tips from Pete Maina, and my wife learned some baitcasting tips from Jim Crowley. We had a great time."
5914746,NARDA 1,2017-12-27 11:51:00,636,I'll be at the Peasant Run show all weekend in the Birch Dale Lodge booth. Stop by and say hi.
5915874,Obabikon,2017-12-28 10:56:00,2370,I'm doing Chicago and Green Bay both...
5915898,Bstar,2017-12-28 11:24:00,564,I'll be at the Chicago/Pheasant Run show on Sunday 1/14. Great way to break up the winter blues and check out some camps.
5915922,btyreprich,2017-12-28 11:37:00,1067,"Last time I went was like 10 years ago. My buddy and I went to look for a lodge in the NWT to go to so as to celebrate our 50th birthdays. Tuned out to be an interesting trip, but now wish we would have stayed in say Ontario and went to a 4star lodge with an emphasis on guest services.When these All Canada Shows started, we’d go every year just to walk around and visit with the owners of the lodge we were going to at the time. I had a feeling that this show was going to steal lots of lodges and customers away from the Chicago Sports Show held in Rosemont.Guess I was right, fisherman want to talk to lodge owners and hear seminars - not be bothered by junk merchant which have nothing to do with fishing or the outdoors.I think there are fewer All Canada Shows now than in the past, but will say these are well run and a great way to spend a few hours."
5916002,BornToFish,2017-12-28 13:07:00,1224,"Greetings,The previous post resonated with me!I've been attending the Green Bay and Milwaukee shows for about twenty years. I thought the Green Bay All Canada Show was slowly dying over the course of many years, and then it finally died. The new owners of the All Canada Shows revived the shows in a very positive manner. They immediately changed venues and instilled a massive amount of energy, enthusiasm and vibrancy to this show. It is again a place that people want to be.The Milwaukee Sentinel Sports Show seemed to be going the same direction as the old All Canada Show - at least in my perspective. There were more booths every year that had virtually nothing to do with the outdoors. I stopped going to that show several years ago and haven't missed it.Kindest regards...."
5916106,spurs101,2017-12-28 15:43:00,635,"I most certainly agree that the Milwaukee Sentinel Sport Show has really gone downhill. It's more of a flee market and and just junk. Went last year and spent 2 hours and walked out. Waste of time and money. The Madison Fishing Expo was pretty good. Good vendors, well represented, decent prices. I'd go to a All Canada show if it were more local. I go to Quebec and that area is not well represented. Fine by me as I'm not going to change camps."
5916266,jackpotjohnny48,2017-12-28 17:33:00,153,"I would definitely go if they still had the All Canada Show here in Madison / Middleton, WI.But since I already have my 2018 trip to Canada booked, I probably will skip it, as it's probably not worth traveling 2 + hours to Green Bay or Chicago.Instead, I will go to the Madison Fishing Expo in late February as well as ""Canoecopia"" show in Madison in early March, for tips and advice on how to fish more effectively from a canoe.I might go to the Milwaukee Musky Expo, and might go to the Capitol City Muskies Inc Musky School in Waunakee in March of 2018."
5917178,Duflebag,2017-12-29 09:01:00,218,I will be at the Chicago show all weekend at the Northwinds booth. Look forward to seeing old friends at the show and get a little excited about the coming fishing season.
