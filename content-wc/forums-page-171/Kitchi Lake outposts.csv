We were chunk and wind fishing and didn't have bait nor much for vertical jigging so probably our own fault that we didn't do better. We rode back in the plane with a group that had biggest northern @ 32"", which to us was small if targeted pike. They seemed to be o.k. with their trip to Kitchi Island, though. Good luck."

The accommodations were not the best (crappy mattresses and cabin just OK) but we did not care as it was our first fly in trip. With that said the lake was very cool with many areas of moving water and one very close to camp. We caught our biggest Walleye to date (30""'ish 10lbs). It was a great fish. We also landed some very nice pike in the 40+"" range. I'm convinced if we went back today the fishing would be significantly better as we have all become better fishermen. It has been probably 20 years ago. The outfitter has since changed at least once...........we flew in from Mackinaw Island on Lake Winnipeg as I recall. The owner was a guy named William. We have honestly not been back because our groups size and also due to the accommodations...........we have been spoiled by some of the other places we have been to in terms of both fishing and accommodations. If they have updated the equipment, cabins etc. I think if we had a group of 6 or less we might consider a trip back again. Hope that helps. Feel free to PM me if you have any additional questions about our trip to Kitchi Island Outpost. Good luck!"
