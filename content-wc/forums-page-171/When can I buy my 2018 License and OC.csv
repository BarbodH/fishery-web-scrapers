I'm glad to see that the local stores have modernized but there's still nothing more convenient than doing this at home and printing everything out - no need to stop anywhere. on line shopping has had major impacts on all forms of retail - especially brick and mortar stores. phish"
5905946,BornToFish,2017-12-20 14:29:00,1224,"Greetings,I heard from good friends that they recently went on-line to renew their Outdoor Cards and also purchased their fishing licenses for 2018. I went on-line this afternoon and renewed my Outdoor Card. I also purchased my three year non-resident fishing license (valid today -12/31/2020). It will take about three weeks to receive the Outdoor Card in the mail.I understand that the exchange rate is presently $1.28CND = $1.00 US.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5907722,onetimedave,2017-12-21 12:22:00,502,The ministry told me you have to wait till January 2018. I am just waiting and then will see.
5933818,BornToFish,2018-01-07 10:52:00,1224,"Greetings,I received my new Ontario Outdoor Card + 3-year fishing license. It took fourteen days for me to receive the card in the mail. I noticed that my new Outdoor Card is again stamped with the type of fishing license and expiration date.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5934978,onetimedave,2018-01-08 05:14:00,502,Purchased my 2018 license on line today. No problems
5937026,onetimedave,2018-01-09 06:06:00,502,"Purchased my ontario license and outdoors card on line yesterday. No problem, went right through"
5850578,3M TA3,2017-11-08 21:23:00,2846,Tried doing it on line tonight bu no option but to upgrade this years license to a sport license. I currently have a Conservation. I want to buy 3 year since Outdoor Card expires too.
5851042,BornToFish,2017-11-09 08:07:00,1224,"Greetings,I've been going with three year nonresident Sports License + Outdoor Card the last few times around. I happen to make the purchase in mid-January, so that the Outdoor Card arrives in time for our first trip of the season in mid-March. I waited a few weeks into January to make the purchase to increase the likelihood that the ""bugs"" are worked out of their system before I give it a try.The last two purchases worked out well for me since I was able to lock in and take advantage of a favorable exchange rate. Another incentive is that the Outdoor Card is ""synched up"" with the fishing license. My license type and expiration date is also printed on the back of the Outdoor Card.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5851066,3M TA3,2017-11-09 08:29:00,2846,"Thanks for the reply. I did the 3 year license and the Outdoor card the last go around also and can't believe 3 years has gone by so quickly. Anyway, planning an ice fishing trip for first week of January and was thinking I could get this taken care of before then."
5851370,BornToFish,2017-11-09 13:29:00,1224,"Greetings,As I can best recall, I think it took 3-4 weeks for Ontario MNR to mail the Outdoor Card to me. Since it was during the ""off season"", I think it got to me quicker than had I bought it during ""prime time"" (e.g. six + weeks).You might want to check with the website during middle to late December, as they might anticipate others will want to do the same thing that you are doing. They might just roll it out before end of year. If they do, you might be the ""beta"" tester that works out the bugs before I buy my license in mid January!When you do purchase your license, I suggest that you print out a receipt showing payment. A MNR officer might accept this receipt as proof of having a license. Hopefully the officer will understand your situation of not having the actual license in your possession.Anyway, Good Fishing and Tight Lines!!"
5851722,onetimedave,2017-11-09 17:06:00,502,OC and license can only be purchased after your current OC expires. I tried sever times before got smart enough to call no charge number and got to talk with a huminoid rater than a computer. The answer I got was that the OC card must to have expired to purchase a new OC and fishing license.
5851898,Golden Eagle,2017-11-09 19:08:00,2642,"Maybe renew outdoor card and purchase 3 year license January 1or 2, 2018. Print temporary copies of both. Should work with no problem."
5852034,3M TA3,2017-11-09 22:41:00,2846,"Yep. Looks like that's what I'll be doing. Just thought there was a way to take care of it now and have a nice OC and license on one single card, like my current one, before the season began."
5854346,martinbns,2017-11-11 10:17:00,1520,Why not just do it when you get here? Let a local merchant make his $1.50 or whatever the fee he gets to keep.
5856786,phishfearme,2017-11-13 11:09:00,1242,a nice thought but many merchants do no carry all types of licenses and who knows when they'll be open. I've experienced both issues and just don't want to risk it.
5857386,martinbns,2017-11-14 05:26:00,1520,"The licensing system is all electronic, so every merchant has to have all types of licenses. Where do you travel to that a merchant wouldn't be open during fishing season?"
