We have been staying at lodges at what I would call the mid section of Eagle Lake, Vermillion Bay and Waldhof Bay. With our long boat rides, we normally don't go past Nash Bay. We need an option for Private Boat, my uncle has some disability and my boat is setup to allow him to be comfortable still fishing 8 hours per day. We would rather not have meals, we prefer to buy food in Canada and cook our own stuff. He has special diet. So, I think that rules out Temple Bay. Also, didn't see a private boat option for North Shore Lodge. I can't find seem to find any other lodges in this part of Eagle Lake. I'm going to the All Canada Show in few weeks, but thought to check what others knew about. Thanks, Remi"

I have also stayed at Eagle Lake Island Lodge once, and we brought our own food and boat. I fish too many hours per day to bother cooking and cleaning up, so we went back to TBL."
