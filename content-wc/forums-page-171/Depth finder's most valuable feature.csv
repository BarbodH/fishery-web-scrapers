I have been fishing some productive spots for years but this year I found some really good spots within a few hundred yards that I didn't even know were there. About hazards, this doesn't work on fast boats nearly as well as it does on rentals but I turn on the depthfinder's warning alarm to 10' and turn the volume up to high. I know it can still happen but it's pretty rare that you'll get a huge surprise when you are running at deeper than 10' in those slow under 20mph rental boats."
5927506,prov1800,2018-01-03 16:07:00,5010,Apparently you have not fished eagle or lac suel and a number of other lakes.depth finders are a great tool for finding bottom and fish but that's about it.still need to learn all the nooks and crannies the old fashioned way.i would say you would be a better fisherman..nobody should totally depend on a unit with there functions.if you were to loose a function such as the GPS part some guys might have a hard time finding there way.should always have a map of your lake with you like obakokin said earlier.i hope the guy that has his eyes glued to his unit running across the lake is watching for other boats.dont get me wrong I have a unit.not the fanciest one but good enough for me.it has over a 1000 waypoints on it on a number of lakes and I really don't need the unit to find them.i basically use it for finding bottom and fish.
5927562,yoopertrout,2018-01-03 16:28:00,1172,"I agree. Of course, I only own a hand held, and finding the bottom is all that it does."
5928210,WallyWarrior,2018-01-03 19:46:00,2488,IÔ∏è would have to say depth would be the most important feature to me. Probably the most basic as well. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
5928234,MikeG1,2018-01-03 19:53:00,433,"I fish Erie and find that marks are most important. Can't catch fish if you can't find them. There is very little structure in Erie, so marks first, depth, tracks, etc. are secondary."
5928290,Aspencreek,2018-01-03 20:04:00,2911,"Depends on the lake I'm on. If no structure and a big bowl all I want to know is how deep, if I'm on places like lac seul I need my safe travel routes, depth and water temps. I can get home without my GPS on LS but I really like to know that I'm on the ""line"". Those lower unit killers can sneak up from nowhere, and there seems to be a shallow shoal that appears out of nowhere every year."
5928730,Pooch,2018-01-04 07:47:00,4618,"I think somebody goes around LS and moves rocks during the winter months. With that lake in constant flux as far as water levels go, there is always something new to learn. In low water years I've come across rocks in what I used as a safe passage path. I can't believe that I missed them all these years. Just a rock sticking up in deep water that five foot either side of and you would never know it was there. Surely makes one slow down a bunch.Most important function of a depth finder is depth. I don't know why engine manufactures do not put a built in forward (maybe 45 degree angle) pointing sonar on lower units that would drop the engine to idle if it detected a hazard. Make it adjustable for depth, distance (sensitivity) I'd gladly pay a couple hundred extra for a feature like that on my next engine. Or, a retro fit kit.Here's your chance to get rich kids.Pooch"
5930154,Aspencreek,2018-01-04 18:33:00,2911,"I know of at least 4-5 spots that have ""developed"" rock piles, low water level years can be a real eye opener!! There is a spot heading toward South Islet that in high water you can go between these 2 islands without a problem, normal lake levels and the rocks are maybe 24-30"" below the surface, in low water you can walk between the 2 without getting wet. Was there in 2002 when the water was down about 8', I marked as many spots on my hand held as I could get. Those spots now are my go to spots...."
5931034,MrSimon,2018-01-05 09:24:00,922,"The combination of side imaging and go-to/spotlock. I can see a 300' swath of structure all at once .... drop a waypoint on the screen anywhere along those 300' .... and then hit one button and the graph/TM will take me to that exact spot and hold me there. This is a true game changer if you fish structure. Literally life changing. It allows me to find and fish ultra-specific structure effectively with fully automated hands-free boat control. I can find a single boulder off the edge of a shoal, position right on top of it, and STAY there in heavy wind .... BY CLICKING TWO BUTTONS."
5925962,Babamel2,2018-01-03 05:11:00,414,"Of all the features on depth (fish) finders today, what feature/s do you find most helpful? GPS, waypoints, depth, fish symbols, side imaging, temp, ...?"

5926162,Hwy 101,2018-01-03 07:09:00,33,"GPS/waypoints, tracks and side imaging in that order."
5926170,BornToFish,2018-01-03 07:10:00,1224,"Greetings,The previous post by Hot Runr gave me a good chuckle as I use the same skull/crossbone icon in the same way! If I've been there once, I surely don't need to go there twice.My first thought for the original post was using a color monitor. Color monitors, in comparison to the older style black/white monitors, allowed me to discern composition of the lake bottom in a more accurate and direct manner. For example, I was able to better locate transitions in bottom content.If you had asked this question a year ago, I would have also answered being able to fish my waypoints. My older waypoints are typically associated with a random place on a piece of structure - where I happened to stop when I first got my gps/sonar unit. Now, I find myself relying far more on the depth contour maps that I created with the AutoChart Live function on my Humminbird gps/sonar unit, rather than my older waypoints.These depth contour maps allowed me to understand why my ""good spots"" were ""good"". I had a few older waypoints that happened to be a ""spot on the spot"". My depth contour maps allowed me to understand why these waypoints were ""good"". This understanding then allowed me to find similar spots on the spot.I find that I am now driving up to a piece of structure (e.g. a rock hump) and immediately going to the ""spot on the spot"" (e.g. a saddle, inside turn, outside turn) rather than wandering around in search of fish on that piece of structure. My newest waypoints are pretty much all ""spots on the spot"". In other words, I am getting on the fish faster.I believe that I have only uncovered the tip of the iceberg when it comes to use of side imaging.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5926194,Baseline,2018-01-03 07:19:00,3207,"I think the basic depth graph and fish echo is the most important feature. GPS, tracking and some of the other features are great to have, but I the real reason I have a graph is I want to see the bottom and fish echos."
5926274,Obabikon,2018-01-03 08:02:00,2370,Depth... I can read a map. I can't see the bottom.
5926370,last chance,2018-01-03 08:51:00,3262,gps speed depth fish marks in that order for me on erie
5926418,fishron,2018-01-03 08:59:00,317,"It's hard to imagine that back in the day I fished by observing the surface, concentrating around weedbeds and points and coves. Now we have fish TV. Gps and lake contour undoubtedly have saved a prop or a lower unit on occasion, but for most of my fishing depth and fish symbols provide me with what I need most."
5926530,stjoeguy,2018-01-03 09:35:00,979,"Got to agree with with HRG: tracks to travel a safe route, skull & crossbones to avoid known rocks and depth when going over new water in Canada. My eyes are glued to the screen when crossing St. Joe."
