From an April 2016 post on BBC Bob Phillips - Barney Spoons Bob Phillips, the maker of Barney Spoons died this week at age 89. Bob continued to make the baits after his good friend Barney Strayer died in 2008 at age 95. For more than 50 years the two made the Barney Spoon in Kent. The end of an era, they made a ""garage bait"" that caught the heck out of them from Canada to Florida. You will be missed old friend."
5528466,5 of Diamonds,2017-05-07 18:21:00,151,Correct. I bought mine off what I believe to be his Daughter. It was a female I spoke w/ and ordered from last year. Helluva lure!
5933394,RYANLANEY,2018-01-06 21:38:00,3,"Correct - The Barney Spoon is still available on LANDBIGFISH.COM . They had a wide variety of colors and sizes . I ordered approximately $150.00 of these gems and they shipped from Kentucky to me just in time for my fishing trip to Boulter Ontario Canada in June 2017. I have heard from different sources that the old lure business in Kent Ohio on Gougler is history now. Not sure if someone else took over the business or if they are just selling out what was left in stock. Either way I have my tackle box stacked up with Barney Lures enough to last for years and years . They are still my go to top water bait for Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and huge Northern Pike.

5937394,RYANLANEY,2018-01-09 09:40:00,3,That sounds like you got some of the defective Barney Spoons ? I had a few that the weed guards broke off but not very many at all. It's very simple to put them back on with a solder gun . A even bought some stiff wire to replace the ones that did break off.
513455,Guest,2001-06-21 17:29:00,0,I am going to Quebec this July and would like to know if anyone happens to have any information on Barney Spoons. Where can you find these buggers? Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Any information >would be greatly appreciated. >Thanks. Try going to the PBS web site. I hear they sell them very cheap. The most popular color is purple. Instead of vibrating in the water they sing ""I love you, you love me, please eat me fiiiiiiishy with a great big hug and a kiss from me to you won't you'll say you love me to"". It's a proven fish attracting jingle. I am just kidding you!!!!!!! I couln't resist. Seriuosly I have not heard of these before. Good luck in your search.Take care,Duffy"

5254986,Guest,2017-01-05 10:28:00,0,you can find them at land big fish on line! tom
5255010,Mike Borger,2017-01-05 10:34:00,1554,"I was introduced to Barney spoons by Jim Saari when fishing at Lac Evans last August.Neat little weedless spoon, but the very flimsy weed guard broke on every single one, sometimes after only one or two casts.Unless you can confirm that this problem has been fixed I would not bother with them.Johnson Silver Minnows and weedless Doctor spoons work well and are bulletproof compared to the Barney spoons.(edit: just realized I responded to a 16 year old post LOL!)"
5255034,pjshorthorn,2017-01-05 10:41:00,5654,Now that is funny right there PjShorthorn
5255050,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-05 10:43:00,447,"So if someone gives me grief for restarting a 7 or 8 year old thread I can say ""Well, at least I'm not as bad as some people."" Thanks"
5259290,lassh,2017-01-08 06:43:00,553,Sometimes resurfacing an old post brings valuable information to light or to the attention of newer WC followers. If that bothers some people then they should skip those threads. The true fundamentals of fishing don't change that much.

5526866,5 of Diamonds,2017-05-06 19:01:00,151,"Hhmmm...I've been using Barney Spoons for years w/ success. I can't ever recall any breakage and did just purchase more Barney's last Summer w/ out any breakage issue.The Barney Spoon is unique. It has a completely different action than that of Johnson Silver Minnows or Doctor Spoons. It can be worked much slower w/ a wider action/vibration than the Johnson or Doctor for more time and area covered in the strike zone. Barney is manufactured in Ohio and is an American handmade lure and not one manufactured in China or mass produced.The largest Barney Spoon I've used are 3/4 ounce (prefer white or black). If you're targeting Northern Pike in Canadian waters, I would suggest you pursue this lure and give it a try. In fact, I can recall on several trips that every member of our group had them tied on all @ the same time!"
