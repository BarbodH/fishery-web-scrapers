We went with some friends from Virginia, Mn. to a lake in Ontario that I can't recall. We would drive about 10 miles out on the lake, build a huge fire next to an island and drill holes in a semi-circle with tip-ups. Then spend the day walking the holes to skim ice, pulling up trout and drinking around the fire. Air temp one morning was -43F. We set coffee cans full of water on rocks next to the fire to put our beer in, or it would freeze in seconds. A bottle of schnapps left on the tailgate started to freeze. Trout pulled out of the holes would curl their tails one direction and freeze solid before they could straighten out. I remember watching a guy's nose start to freeze when we were picking up and his scarf fell down. A white spot on the tip of his nose just grew as I watched it. Kinda scary but we were young and bulletproof. Trucks were plugged in overnight but batteries had to be brought into the cabins at night. Wouldn't do it now!"

At dusk we went in had a bite to eat and checked the temp on the lodge porch 6pm. It was -33 and had been out in it all day. Next morning it was officially -47 missing the all time low in VT by 3 degrees. Dad while cleaning our clocks at poker at 7pm said I dare you. Yeah, 4 of us knuckleheads went streaking. Stub..."

Drove up thru Crane Lake MN to Sandpoint to Lac Lacroix on a road that was plowed to a reservation on the Canadian side of Lacroix in order for them to get winter supplies. Parked our trucks at the border line on the lake and skied into some lakes to camp and fish. First few trips we slept under the stars, then moved onto building a snow cave then to small tents. Wake up many mornings in -30+ and had to Pee. Painful but fun. Nothing like sleeping under the stars at -30 and watching the stars. Caught alot of fish and had alot of fun. Now that road is no longer plowed as the reservation has a road comming in from the north all in Canada so the travel is all by snowmobile so alot harder. We even skied all the way into Ladyboot Bay on Lacroix once to fish. To fat and old to do it now."

I have taken some ice fishing trips up on the Gunflint Trail in Minnesota, fishing lakes like Saganaga and Gunflint, and I can relate to ice cold weather. One year, the four of us (on Saganaga) broke through a large area of slush on our snowshoes, and thankfully we all had extra clothes and gloves in our Duluth packs. Sag is one of those boundary waters lakes where you can snowmobile to the Canadian border, and then snowshoe into your fishing spots. We were in Cache Bay that year. Good memories."
