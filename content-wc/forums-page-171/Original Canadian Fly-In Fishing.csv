5931186,Bearing Man,2018-01-05 10:32:00,30,"I have gone to CFF out of Red Lake 3 of the last 4 years with a small group. One of the guys has been going with CFF for many years exclusively. Good walleyes on the lakes that I've been to and bonus Northern's, perch. Good cabins and service too. However, it's changed hands now and we're a little nervous that the new owner can handle it. Stan was the ultimate handyman and kept everything in top shape. Anyone else that flies in with CFF? If so, what are your thoughts on '18? We're going to St. Charles next weekend to talk to other camps."
5931474,Golden Eagle,2018-01-05 12:36:00,2642,For what reasons are you nervous about the new owner?
5931738,btyreprich,2018-01-05 14:49:00,1067,It's certainly your right to look at other lodges but I might suggest giving the new owner an opportunity to show you guys whether or not he can match the same level of service you have experienced in the past. Our group would only change resorts to save a considerable amount of money on the same lake or to try a new lake.
5935226,Bearing Man,2018-01-08 07:47:00,30,I guess our trepidation is because the new owner will have to hire someone to do the camp checks and upkeep since he appears to be a one man operation vs. Stan and Diane. We were surprised last year when we showed up and it had been sold and was in transition. Although our only complaint was that the sat phone was kept at the other cabin which is a 10 minute boat ride if we had an emergency. We did have a good trip.
5935250,pjshorthorn,2018-01-08 07:52:00,5654,"Would the new owner be open to having a Sat phone at your cabin that you could rent for the week? Is it possible for you to rent one on your own and bring it with you ? If all things work out as in year's past, that may be an easy solution......I wouldn't want to take a 10 mile boat ride to find a phone either.PjShorthorn"
5935298,That Minnesota guy,2018-01-08 08:12:00,8293,Maybe it turns out the new owner is better then the old owner? Give the new guy a chance. He has more to lose on this venture then you do.
5935690,Baseline,2018-01-08 10:25:00,3207,"Over the years a couple of the resorts I've used on a regular basis have changed hands. In my experience the new owners immediately clean up all the loose ends the previous owner let go, made improvements and handle the service very well. I've had more problems with existing owners and that's the reason they didn't get a second visit."
5935954,bthomas3333,2018-01-08 12:30:00,465,X2 The new owners almost always seem ready to make a significant investment to improve the product/service.
5936058,patrick,2018-01-08 13:08:00,277,Times three on the new owners I was in the same dilemma couple of years ago at a lodge that we used to go to turned out the new owners couldn't of been nicer worked out for the best we are happier now with the new owners in the existing camp hope this helps good luck
