Our group drives about 24 hours one way from Ohio/PA to get to Cedar, so you know we have had good fishing success there over the years. We started off at Al's Cedar lake Lodge, and Al runs a nice camp, with clean cabins, good docks and decent camp boats (we always towed our rigs into camp). While we now fish out of a different camp a little more centrally located on the lake chain; I would not hesitate to go back to Al's camp. Even in our first few years on Cedar we did decent to very good on the walleye, pike and the occasional Musky as we were learning the water. As prov1800 said, it is an easy lake to navigate and fish. I would also note that if you get a Spring storm or just a really windy day, you can always find a bay or protected areas to fish. What I have always enjoyed about fishing Cedar is you never know what is going to bite your bait; from a nice walleye to SM Bass, pike, crappie, perch or a trophy Musky. Good luck with your decision.
