5915514,Shellback,2017-12-28 07:08:00,8083,"Maybe I should define my position more. Looking at lodge photos, many going back years, and I see photos of stringers of fish. That doesn't give me the feeling a lodge encourages conservation. It's more like, "" look how many fish you can slay here"". If you want to be the grandpa encouraging your grandson to take stringers of fish for a bragging rights photo, more power to you. I'd rather have a picture of him with a trophy fish releasing back to the water."
5915522,fishsammich,2017-12-28 07:12:00,169,"Salmon Fishing trips, I want to see limits.. 10 salmon for me to bring home doesn't seem excessive, once a year.........fishing everyday spots on the Mississippi River near my home, I only keep what I'm going to eat, with the exception that I will keep 4 or 5 meals worth of filets frozen for consumption over winter , since I don't ice fish. There are two of us that eat fish so I'm not freezing much. What I can't stand are the guys who get on the fish and take limits after limits when they are on em, until the spot is fished out. So that's hundreds of fish because they're allowed 25 panfish per license here. I usually make a meal for two, out of 10 panfish, 20 small panfish filets is plenty for two. Nobody needs 100 sunfish in their freezer unless they are doing a big fish fry. Just my 2 cents worth."
5915594,Bill Krejca,2017-12-28 08:15:00,6107,"Along a similar line - My perception, upon seeing camp photos with a stringer of bass, along with perhaps a small walleye or two, is that the fishing for eyes was poor enough that the folks kept bass to eat. I realize this may not always be the case, but, this is my interpretation of the picture. Bill"
5916434,yoopertrout,2017-12-28 18:46:00,1172,Thanks! Good luck with your new venture!
5916954,MrSimon,2017-12-29 07:43:00,922,"Pictures don't tell the whole story ... but they certainly do tell some of it. I'm with Shellback, I don't like to see pages and pages of dead fish pictures. It just turns me off. Tell me about your strict conservation policy, and show me pages of C&R fish .... and I'll book!"
5917290,fishmanric,2017-12-29 10:30:00,219,Catch and release photos are great and encouraged at our camp. All big fish are to be released. Our district regulations are changing once again this year as you will only be allowed two fish in possession at any time on the water. Still can keep four after two days.
5922722,PA troutguy,2018-01-01 12:08:00,58,"I throw them all back, sorry gents. I was fishing the Sioux Lookout area and was stopped by the conservation officer. He asked me the slot sizes and limits for the lake and I said I have no clue, I throw them all back. He chuckled checked the boat for adult beverages, none, we had a nice chat and he even told me about some hot spots. I only go to lodges that support catch and release spent way too much time whipping the water into a froth other places."
5914730,yoopertrout,2017-12-27 11:38:00,1172,"I think it depends on the species and location, but I'm generally turned off by them. My wife and I twice went to a fairly inexpensive lodge in Ontario that advertised big brook trout. I know two other groups that went. No one got any big brook trout, and not many small ones. I've noticed that 10+ years after the lodge opened, they still display the same brook trout pictures from the early years. I'm not sure if there even are any inexpensive lodges that have big brook trout, but if I look for one, I won't pick one with dead fish pictures. On the other hand, we went to a fly in walleye lake. The place has been around for years, has reasonable rules on keeping fish, and some stringer pictures, and the fishing was great."
5914762,Namegosikaa,2017-12-27 12:00:00,61,"I agree yoopertrout, brook trout fisheries are very sensitive that's why I have a catch and release single barbless policy. Even then if water temps are to high trout don't always survive a clean release.... released fish don't always live that's a reality of the sport."
5914874,papadave,2017-12-27 13:31:00,151,"I agree with Shellback that certain things will turn me off about a lodge. I hate to see a bunch of beer guts holding up giant stringers with so many small eaters. I know it happens at most lodges but I don't want a lodge's website to wave it in front of my face while I'm trying to promote catch and release programs that will benefit them. Most experienced walleye fishermen like the ones on this board realize that old pictures of those big stringers were from a different time when lodge owners thought it was a good way to attract inexperienced tourists ... which it did!! Unfortunately those same tourists also helped clean out their lakes without remorse. The introduction of strict limits and thoughtful slots has brought many lakes back from the dead Lodge owners should realize that those same guys that cleaned out their lakes were quick to abandon them when traveling became so expensive. Lodges need to start appealing to an entirely different clientele by favoring catch and release. They need to put an emphasis on big fish, clean modern accommodations, local wildlife and nature, quality boats and motors, congenial employees and good rate packages on an attractive website that will show us they are a first class operation."
5915090,ziggyzag,2017-12-27 15:50:00,125,"Well I see nothing wrong with a group of fishermen holding a stringer of fish they caught and taking a picture for memory sake. Now with that said if the stringer has (8) big walleye ""20"" plus"" on it I see that as a negative and if every group is doing it yes then that lake is headed for problems down the line. But as we all know over the last 10 + years a very high percentage of fishermen now understand and respect the science behind the slot limits and such and I feel as a group we are doing a much better job at understanding and complying with this. But as for some who have claimed that they are out of the running of going to an outfitter who's web page or flyer shows a stringer of fish is crazy in my opinion. You are probably the same people who just love summer time walleye fishing pulling them up from 30 ft. BUT OK YOU RELEASED THEM! now it does not matter what size you released there dead. Those are the fisheries that are truly headed for trouble. IMHO!"
5915170,yoopertrout,2017-12-27 16:55:00,1172,"No. We aren't. But, it you want to start an argument with us, you'd do better to write in full sentences, and learn the difference between ""who's"" and ""whose"", and ""their"", ""there"" and ""they're."" Your point would be clearer."
5915178,yoopertrout,2017-12-27 16:57:00,1172,"Are you a camp owner? If so, could you post or send me a link to your website?"
5915234,Namegosikaa,2017-12-27 17:39:00,61,Yes I just purchased camps in the nakina area. namegosikaaoutfitters.com
5915282,andreindy,2017-12-27 18:00:00,308,"I do agree with you Ziggyzag, particularly that today's angler has a much deeper understanding of resource management. I know I do now, but when I was young I confess that I did not. I would also agree that almost all sites I visited online communicate that simply ""being there"" is some of the magic of the whole experience and do not have a passenger pigeon vibe of an endless harvest. Simple stringer pics I get and they do not rule out a location for me. One of my favorite pictures I have is of my father, son and brother laughing over a stringer of eater walleyes. Your point of stringers of big walleyes being different is well taken and I agree."
5915314,Baseline,2017-12-27 18:55:00,3207,"I really don't care what sort of pictures a resort owner puts on their website. I'm more interested in the condition of the resort, services offered and the lake. Most of the fish pics are of a happy group showing their limits for the day or trip. There are also lots of live shots from the boats of released fish. The MNR regulates the lakes and the resort owners I've encountered seem to monitor their guests. The people I encounter usually keep a limit of walleyes to take home and maybe eat a couple of meals during the week. I've been to resorts all over northwestern Ontario and an evening visit to the fish cleaning house will tell the story of what kind of day people are having. Go to Lac Suel in early June and the drums will be full of cleaned fish. It's not hard to figure out why most people head to Canada for a fishing trip."
5915498,johnboat,2017-12-28 06:55:00,2014,"Me too. How dare Grandpa gets a picture with his son and grandson with a stringer of ANY fish!!Jeeze, lighten up. Fish populations aren't on the decline. And the future looks good."
5914010,Shellback,2017-12-27 05:33:00,8083,"What's everyone's thought's? I'm thinking how long can a lake survive as a good fishing destination if stringers like that are taken. So if I'm searching for a new camp, ones with the stringer photos tend to turn me right off. What are guest and camp owners opinions?"
5914058,Namegosikaa,2017-12-27 05:57:00,61,"I have a pic of a stringer full of eyes on my site and fb page. Your right I was warned some folk may be turned off by that, having said that I do promote catch and release and good conservation practises. At days end I'm not telling my guests that catch and consume isn't allowed I just hope they release all larger fish."
5914162,Bill Krejca,2017-12-27 06:54:00,6107,"What turns me off more than a stringer of eatin' size fish are pictures of lunkers which are taken on the dock, or on shore at camp, signifying the fish was kept. Also, massive stringers of fish or lunkers on a resort web site which has fly-in options. My first thought is that the fish were taken from a fly-in location. Or maybe ""borrowed"" from somewhere/someone. I guess I've just been around too long, and have sort of evolved into a suspicious ol' geezer. Bill"
5914194,BornToFish,2017-12-27 07:16:00,1224,"Greetings,I too am turned off by pictures of stringers of fish. The thought that comes to mind when I see a picture of an angler holding a nice fish, that is taken in the home or parking lot, is: ""another nice fish released to the grease"". The picture that I find most offensive involves a board with pegs to hang dead fish. The name of the lodge on the board seals the deal for me!Many websites for fishing lodges have photo galleries for guests to post pictures. I understand that guests like to have a photo of themselves holding a nice fish. I like to assume that fish are released to the lake when I see a picture taken in the boat with water or a shoreline in the background.Pictures of fish taken in the boat and stringers of dead fish both convey a message of a body of water with potential for good fishing. However, pictures of dead fish signal to me a lake that is in decline. A picture of a fish being released to the water conveys a lake with a fishery that is improving. It doesn't take me long to decide if I want to invest my time/money in the fishery.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5914274,dutchbuoy,2017-12-27 07:33:00,6,I tend to disagree with some of the above comments. We have tried several different fishing camps over the years and one of the things I look for when browsing new camps is photos of fish. We have been disappointed a couple times on trips where we really struggled to find fish and upon further review of their websites there were very few photos of stringers of fish. Granted I am not a pro fisherman but not a newbie either. Lots of fish photos shows me that that lake or river is a good producer of fish. As long as people follow the rules and limits of their FMZ there is nothing wrong with keeping a limit of fish.
5914298,v-bay gord,2017-12-27 07:48:00,3168,"I think there can be a mixture but I would lean heavily on having a lot of photos of live fish. Nothing wrong with showing some ""eaters"" but I would avoid dead trophy sized fish. Most camps don't even want the latter brought into camp, never mind showing off photos of them on their websites."
5914314,andreindy,2017-12-27 08:15:00,308,"As a very new traveler to Canada, and one who has had to wade through the sea of websites and propaganda, I would say that pictures of fish absolutely did not influence me in the sense of ""Wow, look at all those fish...this place must be way better than the place that only posted HALF as many pictures!"" That being said, the kind and nature of pictures on your website communicate your philosophy and values. If I was advertising my company I would be absolutely certain that there is no mistaking what we are about and what we value. A barrage of full stringer pics and ""trophy on shore pics"", even with or without other context, communicates a message to me and it simply does not align with my values. I move on."
5914346,Thompmd,2017-12-27 08:28:00,320,"I have always just followed whatever the regulations are/were but I have also never sent pictures to any of the camps so the pictures really don't make any difference.Generally speaking IMO fishing is as good now as it has ever been and one of those reasons is because of the limits(both size and numbers).One of the reasons we go is to bring fish back, we love to eat them and we typically do in a family setting with the people who went on the trip(s) with us. It reminds us of the times we shared and also brings us back.It's always funny to me too that when we talk to a camp owner about booking with them we never talk about the fishing(when is the best time or what kind/size or this secret etc). I actually prefer to find my own."
5914418,Obabikon,2017-12-27 08:51:00,2370,"Stringers don't bother me one bit. Don't break the law while doing it. If you have a group of 8, and want to take a picture of your 16 walleye and some crappie... by all means. I honestly think stringer pictures typically show more of what you can expect, versus pictures of trophy fish. There are lakes out there that you can get skunked fishing for walleye for an entire week. BUT... they've got a dozen pictures of big ones on their website.... As a resort... I like to show off that groups of 10 always catch enough to eat every day, plus if you want you can take some fish home. Those are big selling points. I encourage catch and release of big fish. You can only be put on our ""wall of claim"" if you release the fish. That said... in my 36 years on Lake of the Woods, fishing has never been better, and conservation efforts have never been higher (MNR, the resort, and the guests all included in those efforts)."
