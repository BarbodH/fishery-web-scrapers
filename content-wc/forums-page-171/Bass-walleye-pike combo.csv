5930362,x4flatfish,2018-01-04 22:15:00,319,"You mentioned Little Vermilion. Might I suggest Big Vermilion. According to mapquest about 19 hours for you. We stay at River Edge Outfitters. Bass, pike, musky, and trout in the lake. About 3 miles down the road you can put your boat in Lac Suel and catch all the above, plus all the walleye you want. River Edge has new cabins and very reasonable pricing. Also camping available near by. No live bait on Big Vermilion and Catch and release only on Little Vermilion. A little far for you I know, but you would not be disappointed."
5932594,fsz,2018-01-06 07:21:00,144,I'll look into Big V too. Thanks
5938402,PA troutguy,2018-01-09 19:10:00,58,"I have fished Big and Little V and Lac Suel. If you fish Big V watch out for the reefs that seemingly come out of no where, little V only has a couple spots like that. I use a map and my on hummingbird GPS to mark the reefs. Good bass fishing in all three, have caught 18 inch smallmouth in all of them. I usually go there for 14 days of fishing."
5942682,fsz,2018-01-12 08:33:00,144,"Thanks for the input. Indeed, if I go to one of the vermillions I would also book a charter on Seul for a day of walleye fishing. Never been there, not going to chance long boat runs, rocks, and unfamiliar big water. From what I understand Seul's bass fishing can't compare to the vermilions in terms of quantity."
5921026,fsz,2017-12-31 15:16:00,144,"I'm looking for a lake that has a combination of bass-walleye-and pike. Trying to keep location within 16 hours of the west side of cleveland. Quality of bass and pike fishing probably more important than walleye but would be nice to have decent numbers of walleye for variety. Drive- in to a campground, cabin, or DIY bush-lake (with or without my own boat-16.5 ft 30 hp) are all options as is a reasonable price fly-in. Taking two older teenagers and possibly my Dad. I went to Pasha Lake cabins in 2016 and had good fishing but no bass options plus my kids would not like driving to a different lake everyday (although I found the exploration aspect fun!). Happy Day Lodge outpost on Windermere was booked all summer and not particularly interested in the other cabins/campground as the run to good fishing is long from what I hear. Murray lake, or nearby Shikwamkwa lake, seem like options but information on these lakes is way more limited, although they are not that far from Windermere. Tried reviving an old thread but it didn't wake up. Air Ivanhoe has a lake called Schewabik that might fit the bill but again information is limited. They also had another lake called McConnell I believe with a portage to Hardiman neither of these lakes have walleye but both have bass and pike I think. I looked at an outfitter with lake that had bass and pike only, but not having walleye and 6hp outboard motors on the boats for a medium (definitely not small) size lake were concerns. I've read things about little vermillion (the one near big vermillion) supposed to be a great bass and pike lake with a chance at musky (my kids would love to catch one even if not a ""trophy""). That said its a far drive, outside my 16 hour goal, but on the plus side there is a provincal campground on the lake which would help me keep costs down. If the bass and pike fishing are good enough I could forget about the walleye or go to another area lake that has them and get a charter/hire a guide. Any thoughts appreciated, PM if you prefer."
5921298,Namegosikaa,2017-12-31 16:43:00,61,"Cordinley lake in Nakina has all the above you mentioned. There are 4 lakes in a chain where bass were introduced back in the 80's. The bass fishing is good enough to support a derby, the walleye fishing is good to great in spots and the pike fishing is very good with 30""+ fish common with a real chance for a trophy. There are a few different places to stay lake side plus a municipal campground with power and shower house. The only down side is the sea plane base so you don't need a alarm clock. That also would be in your 16hr window"
5922210,fsz,2018-01-01 08:28:00,144,"Thanks for the response. Interesting you brought that up. Cordingly is probably too ""busy"" for us but I considered other lakes in the chain. Just not sure about the walleye on those lakes, and of course no outposts on them but we could camp."
5922234,Namegosikaa,2018-01-01 08:36:00,61,"Squaw is by far the best and it has beautiful spots to camp. Walleye fishing is very good especially at the river inflow. The only down side is getting your boat in there would be a task. There Is an access point on the storm road before the bridge but it's just a trail maybe 100 yards down to a boat cache. John Bill has a landing on a very rough old logging trail, it wouldn't be easy to get a large boat down there either but a nice campsite at the landing."
5922298,Obabikon,2018-01-01 09:03:00,2370,Cleveland to International Falls is right at 16 hours. You could do LOTW's or Rainy.
5922442,Mike Borger,2018-01-01 10:08:00,1554,"Best smallmouth bass fishing on the planet is in Quetico Park imo. Along with world class walleye, pike and lake trout.If canoe camping isn't out of the question then it's certainly something to consider. Even easy access lakes like Pickerel Lake on the northern perimeter have incredible fishing with very little effort required to get in. It's a big lake, almost 26 km's long from end to end and up to 6km's wide. Endless islands, back bays, inflowing creeks and 5 star campsites. With one short portage you could base camp there and have incredible fishing for all 4 species. If you're willing to paddle and portage even a little bit more the opportunities are almost endless.If you don't have the equipment there are tons of outfitters in the Atikokan area who can rent you everything you need.I'm a bit biased as far as Quetico goes. I've spent a lot of time paddling her waters in years gone by although not recently. I'm returning myself this year for the first time in a very long time with my young son. I have a 32 night trip planned out encompassing some of the best waters in the park. Quite honestly it's been a while since I've looked forward to something this much."

5922818,fsz,2018-01-01 13:16:00,144,"Thanks guys. I was going to scope out the lakes in the cordingly chain last fall but some things came up. I have other boats available besides my 16.5 alaskan (14 foot v's, a grumman sport boat, etc.) so I can match the boat to the situation (ramp, hand carry portage, etc.). Based on some other research (among that some previous posts by Mike B on this an other forums) I am also looking at Quetico (specifically pickeral). Lake of the woods/Rainey at International Falls would be a good hike plus and is slightly larger water than what I'm looking for right now but now that you mention it probably a good idea to look into that can't hurt to."
5923698,Thompmd,2018-01-02 05:54:00,320,"I'm also a fan of LOTW, I've fished near Nestor Falls around to Kenora and IMO the quality/quantity I can't tell the difference..Do not let the size of the lake intimidate you, the key to me is that it has 15,000 islands so there are always places to get out of the wind.I am a smallmouth guy and they are underfished IMO, then a pike guy and lastly a walleye guy. LOTW is also arguably the best Muskie lake on the planet. We usually catch 1-2 at a minimum and we don't fish for them. There are any type of accommodations you want in regards to budget. Let me know if you want more specific info or PM me, I'm happy to share."
5927570,yoopertrout,2018-01-03 16:31:00,1172,"I took a pretty long (but not 32 nights!) trip to Quetico many years ago. I wasn't much of a fisherman at the time, although we did catch some fish. It was an incredibly beautiful place, and I don't think you could go wrong there."
