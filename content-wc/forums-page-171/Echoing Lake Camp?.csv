5597777,TritonEbbs,2017-06-08 14:51:00,16,Walleye Central First post long time viewer! Wondering if anyone on the board is heading up to Echoing Lake Camp this year? While my trip is later in the summer I have had a hard time getting into contact with Shaun and wondered if anyone has had any contact or trip planned... Thanks for any assistance you guys may have Regards Triton Ebbs

You are in for a real treat this summer, that I can say for sure!As far as Shaun goes he's a fantastic young man, instantly likeable and a really great down to earth host. BUT communication is not his strong suit. (Shaun are you listening? ). Be persistent, don't stress over it, he will respond eventually."

I also see that they are not listed at the St. Charles show next weekend, which is where I spoke with them last year. I love big Northern's and remember being intrigued by this camp, although it seemed to be a bit pricey and a long flight - which does go hand in hand. If anyone knows about the current status, I would appreciate a reply. Thanks."

I sure wish they would change their policy of one group in camp at a time.Oh well...Hope they aren't gone.I'm 99.9% sure the camp is still going strong. I chatted a couple of times with Shaun this past season. Also a good friend visited the camp twice last year with two different groups and as far as I know is going back again in 2018.The website expiring is troubling, but knowing Shaun he probably just forgot to renew it. (I realize how that sounds).For now try reaching out to Shaun on facebook, either by messaging Echoing Lake directly here: https://www.facebook.com/EchoingLakeCamp/Or by messaging Shaun Szachury directly here: https://www.facebook.com/szachuryIf anyone has any success reaching him let us all know what the scoop is!I can tell anyone flat out, if you have to jump through an extra hoop or two to book this camp it's definitely worth it!"
