That usually doesn't happen until closer to spring. Then the recurring dream is I get to the lake and forgot reels or rods or something else essential plus the trip is nearly over and I haven't gotten on the water yet. Used to be I was in public naked. Now I'm missing out on my fishing trip for one reason or another. As sure as the sun rises, I must be getting old!Good video. Drones are a novelty now, but are useful for a different perspective that is fascinating.Pooch"
