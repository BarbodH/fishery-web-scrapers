533991,Guest,2003-07-30 22:53:00,0,I am heading back up to Minaki August 15th and would like to know what the Musky fishing will be like. We have caught a few in late June and early July but never have tried August. We also like to fish for large Northern Pike and any info on either would greatly be appreciated.
