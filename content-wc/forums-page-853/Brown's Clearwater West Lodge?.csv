533616,VANT,2003-07-19 12:39:00,68,Anybody been to Brown's this year? Any reports on the fishing? Especially the walleye fishing on Turtle Lake? Heard it was just re-opened for walleye fishing. Wondering how it has been. Thanks Vant

We have had (our boat) several 75-100 fish days of White Otter size walleyes. The trout fishing on Clearwater & White Otter has been some of the best I have seen in over twenty years that we have been going up there. Let me know if you have any questions, I will try to answer them."

How is their smallmouth fishing on Clearwater and the surrounding lakes. When planning trips to CA, Browns has always been in my mind, but have alot of questions when I read their material. Thanks for any input."

Chuck, Cathy, Dallas and Cody were exceptional hosts and bent over backwards to help us since we had never fished the chain before. Though this was the first time we were there, we have already booked for next year. You can buy portage passes from the lodge, and I think they were $11.00 or $12.00. There is also a store, including beer that is a short walk from the cabins. If you have any questions, let me know and you can e-mail me directly."
