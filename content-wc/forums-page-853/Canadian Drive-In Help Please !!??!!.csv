533857,Guest,2003-07-27 16:47:00,0,"I have received the greenlight from the wife to go to Canada the last week of August but do not know where to start. Have never been before and need some input. Here is what we would ideally want to do. Drivimg from Chicago want to be within 10-12 hours of travel and are thinking in the general direction of International Falls or Thunder Bay route. We would ideally like a low fishing pressure lake where we can catch smallmouth, walleyes, and northerns. I do not want to trailer my boat so we will need a place with quality boats and accomadations. Looking at drive in but if cheap enough might try a fly in. Please give us any suggestion you may have because I must start calling those places hoping for an opening. Thanx for all of your help~!! Jason"
533867,Guest,2003-07-28 04:54:00,0,Jason-Give George and Sherri a call at Holinshead Lake (2hours north of Thunder Bay). I guarntee you'll keep going back. 807-768-1924.
533870,Gary_IA,2003-07-28 05:48:00,144,"There are so many great places to fish in Canada and so many sources of information. One source is the Northern Ontario Tourism Outfitters Association (Noto). You can find this through your search engine or by searching the Canada Message Board for Noto. Be sure to click archives before you search. Another message board is http://www.justfishontario.com This board has a feature that allows you to input your criteria and the outfitters will contact you. Alternatives to drive in or fly in are rail in or boat in. I've done all of the above. Boat in will allow you to get away from the crowds and pressure near a drive in resort but at a lesser cost than a fly in. While I enjoyed my boat in, it was to a basic fishing camp, not American Plan. I hasten to add there are several boat in camps that meet your criteria on Lake of the Woods, Rainy Lake and Eagle Lake. I'm sure there are such places on Lac Seul (the apparent favorite fishing lake on this board). The town of Morson on Lake of the Woods is the address of a number of good drive in resorts and island resorts. Fort Frances on Rainy Lake and Vermilion Bay on Eagle Lake. If you are interested in a rail in trip. Check out the Algoma Central Railway north of Sault Ste. Marie. There a number of resorts along this line. I enjoyed my trip to Oba Lake-oh so many years ago."
533875,Guest,2003-07-28 09:23:00,0,"Jason Returned to Chicago area last Sunday from another Lac Seul drive-in trip. First-rate lodge and fishing: caught walleye and northern, plus a few smallies. Especially for a first-timer, one month is a short time to get everything organized. I see to the trip planning for our group, and have recent travel/lodge/budget info & take-along lists that may be useful. If you're interested in NW Lac Seul area, send me an email: [email protected]"
533878,Guest,2003-07-28 10:17:00,0,"Fishpfinder please e-mail me back with a number to contact you I could not get through to your e-mail address for some reason. I am in Bartlett(il) and would like to pick your mind a little about the Lac Seul area. How long is the drive, and how good was the fishing? Worth the drive?? Thanx in advance , Jason 630-709-7434"
533884,bronzeback77,2003-07-28 11:43:00,97,"I have a great spot for you on Lake of the Woods called White Pine Lodge, which is only a 12 hour drive from Chicago. I know that the site administrators does not like you to post website address so if you are interested you can email me at [email protected]. I can give you all the info you need. I have been going up for 6 years in a row but many of the other guests have been coming for 10, 20 even 40 years in a row. It is located near Whitefish Bay just south of Sioux Narrows. My wife and I caught 400 + Smallmouth while we were there in May. Plus a lot of Walleye, Pike and Lake Trout. They are located in a very secluded spot on Lake of the Woods and there are many days when my wife and I don't see anyone else out on the water. The end of August is probably the best time of the year for Smallmouth. The Kenora Bass Invitational takes place around this time and draws some big name pros, so you know the fishing is good if they pick this same time every year. You said you wanted to rent a boat, well all of the boats White Pine has are three years old or newer. So you will get great equipment. I am not sure if they have any openings but give me an email and I will give you more details. Dave STL"

533954,Guest,2003-07-30 09:02:00,0,I agree I have been to witch bay it is great. You can drive there and it still is secluded
533976,Guest,2003-07-30 17:30:00,0,"Jason, I will second (or third or 4th) that Witch Bay recommendation. My wife and I have been going there every year since 1993 and we love the place. They treat their guests extremely well, the fishing is very good, and the camp boats are Crestliner 1750 FishHawks with TWO X-65's on them. Some of my friends have sold their boats and just rent camp boats up there now because they are so nice."
