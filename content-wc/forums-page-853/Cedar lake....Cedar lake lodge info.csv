533836,Trailerguy,2003-07-26 07:17:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Cedar Lake is far from ""netted out"", It is a well known musky lake, and has nice eye's as well. The commercial fishing is done in the fall for whitefish, when they are schooled up. Vertually no other species are harvested. No lake should be judged by one expereince."
533903,Guest,2003-07-28 20:54:00,0,anything else?
533928,Guest,2003-07-29 20:11:00,0,"We were at Cedar Lake Lodge last year. Be aware that the cabins don't have flush toilets. Also, you will be warming up to a wood stove. We spent considerable time chopping our own wood. There are places on the lake that have oil or electric heat that might better suit your needs in mid September."

533949,Trailerguy,2003-07-30 06:47:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Key West, No,I'm not a lodge owner, I live in Iowa, I've fished the area for 25 yrs. And I own a cottage on Wabaskang Lake. As far as Cedar Lake Lodge goes, I've never stayed there.There are many great places to fish in that area, and Cedar Lake is still one of them. If you like fishing Lac Seul then more power to you. As far as outfishing anybody, why would a great fisherman like you have to be in a ""factory"" to catch them? There are other things that make an great trip, besides shooting ducks in a barrel,LOL. If you want to test your skills and have some great fillets try whitefish this September! :) :)"
533985,Guest,2003-07-30 20:01:00,0,"My wife and I went to CLL in Sept a few years ago. Sounded nice talking to owner at Green Bay ALL CANADA SHOW. When we got there we were VERY disappointed. I know he was planning on fixing up the place so it may have changed some by now. We stayed 2 days and left. My wife had a mouse run across her feet and that was the final straw. The floor was at an angle. You could see the ground through the holes in the floor. The holes in the log cabin were filled with aluminum foil stuffed into them. Cabins were very small. I just had started to find a couple places to catch some fish (as it is with all ""new water""). We paid for the whole week too. We called Terry at Merkels on Wabigoon and he said come on down so we went there. This year I went to Lac Seul. Drove right by CLL and was not unhappy to do so."

In all fairness, I did see 3 good walleyes brought into camp. Did get into some fish in Perrault, but like keywest said, kind of dinky. We had better action for size and numbers driving up the road to Ear Falls and fishing down from the dam. The plus side is that it is an easy lake to navigate w/o many hazards and doesn't get that choppy."
