I believe there are a total of 4 lodges on the lake, one is within site of Boois, but we never saw any activity over there. One other lodge I know had only 2 guests for the week and the forth I never saw nor saw any of their boats. Here is a link to some of the pics I took while there, will have more up after I get them all sized.http://www.photobucket.com/albums/0603/ackermannsacre/ Here is a link to a report I made last week when we returned.https://www.walleyecentral.com/dc/dcb...d=27101&page=3 If you have any particular questions you can email me anytime at [email protected]"
