Here's the schedule: MWC East May 22-23, Henderson Harbor, NY, Lake Ontario July 17-18, Jamestown, NY, Lake Chautauqua August 7-8, Linwood, MI, Saginaw Bay MWC Central March 27-28, Spring Valley, IL, Illinois River June 26-27, Osh Kosh, WI, Winnebago September 18-19, Walker, MN, Leech The Entry Fee For All MWC Tournaments Is $600 Per Tournament Per Team Just wanting our Canadian anglers to know that the East division could be seen as rather convenient -- so keep it in mind when looking at next year's plans. If you have any questions you can contact us at MWC headquarters via email: [email protected] Or, I will be the chat-site guest on Wednesday evening August 13th. Feel free to log on and ask questions then. Thanks! Kristine Houtman Director, MWC"
