533502,Guest,2003-07-15 11:05:00,0,"I guess that all depends on if the ""potato police"" will still be on patrol. I hear they're throwing people in jail for smuggling taters into Canada...hope you weren't thinking of smuggling in any US potatos..."

533773,Guest,2003-07-24 08:09:00,0,This site has up-to-date info:http://www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca/customs/g...es/menu-e.html We had zero wait when crossing July 5 at about 1:30 P.M. at International Falls. It was unreal. The Canadian government has done a lot to improve the checkpoint.

533899,Guest,2003-07-28 18:39:00,0,"Have been across twice both ways this year. No waits on the way in or out. Standard questions, Very professional both sides. Be nice and be honest and no troubles. By the way no tater questions at all. Eric MacDonald"
533901,Guest,2003-07-28 20:30:00,0,"we went across at 8am on the 19th and had a two minute wait. standard potato question (we didn't take any in) standard nightcrawler question....we said we had 500 in bedding...they never checked. we paid a 33 duty on excess booze. we took over 4 1.75's....and you're only allowed 4 liter bottles. there was a 7 block long wait to cross back into the us on the 26th. standard questions on the way out...very nice canucks. i question about bringing back cuban cigars...that's a no no and they said they would have to confiscate. fortunately, i didn't buy any in ontario."
533939,Guest,2003-07-29 23:41:00,0,the canadians are pretty good at keeping the line moving its coming back on friday or saturday around that is the killer. the canadians have 3or 4 lanes going north and the americans have 2 going south I think. Comeon guys lets that line moving!
