533953,Guest,2003-07-30 08:25:00,0,There is a big tackle and bait store in Fort Francis. I forget the name of it but it is right next to Harborview restaraunt right on the main road going out of town on the lake. They sell in volume and always have fresh bait. We get our leeches there every year. Bring a cooler to put the bait in of course. Good luck
533647,itry,2003-07-20 19:11:00,78,Going to Cedar Lake first week of August and would like to pick up some nightcrawlers on the way. Can anyone recommend a good bait shop in one of these towns? Thanks in advance.
533653,MattPoke13,2003-07-21 07:49:00,4,"There is a pretty nice bait shop directly on the left corner as you turn North in Vermillion Bay. I can't remember the name but it is big. (gas station, conv. store, restaraunt etc.) you can't miss it. Good luck, we had good success in Cedar last year for Musky."
533654,Guest,2003-07-21 08:12:00,0,"Bobby's Corner is the best good selection of bait and very nice people. Its at the corner of highway 17 and Blue Lake Road, about a mile west of 105."

WE STOP THERE EVERY YEAR FOR OUR LICENSE, EXTRA GAS AND A FEW OTHER ITEMS. THEY HAVE A WEB SIT AT [email protected]. THERE IS A RESTAURANT ON THE SOUTHEAST CORNER THAT HAS A GOOD PIZZA AND BREAKFAST."

That is just his nature but the guy is not all bad."
533722,itry,2003-07-22 21:05:00,78,thanks for the info. any tips for muskies? have never fished for them but want to try while I'm there.
533757,fishmaster,2003-07-23 17:16:00,209,Surface bait like cisco kid toppers always worked good for me in Canada. Anything that makes lot of noise would be a good choice.
533766,Guest,2003-07-24 07:27:00,0,"It's called Bobbies baits. It may be the best tackle store in 100 miles or more. Talk to Allen, the owner. He's a kick."
533871,Guest,2003-07-28 05:57:00,0,Jigger's Tackle Co. in Vermillion Bay is the best. We live in Dryden and will do the 20 minute drive out there for our tackle and bait. She fishes alot and knows what works in different lake for all species. Good Luck.
