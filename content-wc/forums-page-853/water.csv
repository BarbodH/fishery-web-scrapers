533945,GrandPops,2003-07-30 05:04:00,31,Got back from LOTW Monday night. Water level is still down about 2 feet. Was told that the control board is not going to raise the level any more this year. Did not here a reason. Keep Your Rod Bent!!! GrandPops
533950,MTJ,2003-07-30 07:03:00,106,The lake level is still low and I assume it will rise a little by Sept. but not enough to make a difference. Rainy Lake is below the recomended operating level which has prompted the control board to cut down the outflow into Rainy River. The dam in Kenora has also been shut down to minimum outflows. Unless there is substantial rainfall I wouldn't expect to see any drastic increases in lake levels. The watershed has seen the dryest year since 1912. Good luck and watch your charts.
