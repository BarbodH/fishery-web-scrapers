533970,Guest,2003-07-30 15:25:00,0,"Every crankbait that we troll determines our trolling speed. I always try to go a speed that will give me maximum action on the crankbait and if we are trolling shallow (10/15ft) I want to keep the bait in contact with the bottom as much as I can. This gives an erratic action and makes it run where the fish live. I like Shad Raps deep divers in Greens,Blue, Orange and chrome. Any combination of these colors work well also."
