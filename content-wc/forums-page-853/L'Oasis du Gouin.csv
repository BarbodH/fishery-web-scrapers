533916,McQ,2003-07-29 10:57:00,615,"Got back home late Friday evening, let me try to explain where we were and some of the elements of the reservoir. L'Oasis du Gouin is a lodge situated in the approximate middle of the Gouin Reservoir which is located about 300 miles due north of Ottawa or Montreal - the lodge is on an island surrounded by bays that extend to the horizon in all directions. For you pilots out there it has its own airstrip and many visitors arrive in their own aircraft from locations as far away as Florida and Colorado to enjoy the boundless fishery. The cabins are of log construction (harvested on the site), roomy, clean and the facilities are indoors. The main lodge is also of log construction - has a complete kitchen and is well suited to accomodate 25 - 30 guests on the American Plan. The hosts Jackie and Bernard LeBlanc are two of the finest people that I've had the pleasure to meet in all my years visiting the north. Quick to repond to our needs and absolutely intent on making sure we had a great time. Sixteen foot fiberglass guide boats powered by 15 hsp. Mercury motors got us safely around the surrounding waters and were a great fishing platform. Our targets were walleye and northerb pike - we caught fish virtually everywhere we travelled and had a couple of beyond pheneominal days. Fifty walleye in a 5 hour session was the norm, mix in pike up to 15 lbs. and I think you can get a feeling for just what the fishing was like. Once I get caught up on the work around here I'll get into some of the detail that made every day a new excursion. Meanwhile if you want to check out the site - try - http://www.fishing-quebec.com/index.html The best thing is, I get to do it all over again on the 9th of Aug. when I host Talking Outdoors - Mike Jackson and Streamsides - Don Meissner."

533922,McQ,2003-07-29 15:06:00,615,"I had a great chance to try out the new Berkley GULP crawlers too, the local rep gave me a few bags of the pumpkinseed and I used them on two hook crawler harnesses - Orange blade and yellow beads. The other guy in the boat continued to fish with nightcrawlers on his harness. Over a two day period I boated eighteen walleye and was outfished by a margin of 3 -2 (he caught 24 fish) but the larger fish came on the Gulp crawler (about 4#'s). We were fishing rocky edges in 32 feet of water using a 2 ounce bottom bouncer. We fished these two days from 9:30 in the morning until 2:00 in the afternoon - it was overcast and raining lightly both days. On a couple of occasions we had double headers and attracted 6 pike too - the largest about 10 pounds. The toothy critters didn't chew up the Gulp, just released them and kept on fishing. I used two Gulp crawlers and my partner went through a 40 count box of crawlers. From the financial side the Gulp was a clear winner. I also had the pleasure to meet a fellow WC'er at the lodge, Hill, I trust you got out the gravel road without any problems."
533942,Guest,2003-07-30 00:04:00,0,Interesting details of your fishing trip McQ. I did manage to make the long drive back home along the lengthy gravel road. More details I have forwarded to your email address.
533946,nemio,2003-07-30 05:07:00,96,Sound that Quebec and specialy Gouin Reservoir provide you with an excellent fishing trip. Those Gulp from Berkley looks quite good also.
533959,Guest,2003-07-30 10:15:00,0,"Now wait a minute-One post says 50 fish per 5 hrs. another talks about 18 walleye in a 2 day period, something don't add up!!!!"
533960,McQ,2003-07-30 10:59:00,615,"We fished 6 days - 2 sessions over 2 days were devoted to fishing the GULP product in a semi-controlled test using harnesses. The other 4 days were a mix of harness, jig and crankbait use. The norm was 50+ fish a boat. Our success during late afternoon and evening sessions was about the same. We did the GULP test to provide some info to the members here on the products viabiiity as promised in an earlier post. Sorry if I confused anybody. I now realize that all members don't read all the posts so I'll try to be more detailed in the future. This particular body of water is truly a fish factory and if you are lucky enough to hit a pattern right 100 fish days are well within the realm of possibilty. As a point of interest we used the new Hot n Tots, Thin Fins and Wally Divers long lining and Bagley Top Guns on a 4' lead behind a bouncer - this combo produced the best - fish were holding tight to an edge. You could maintain the same pattern on almost all the areas fished if you could locate similar break lines. Wind was fairly consistent from the North West and only the speed would vary from about 5 - 8 MPH to dead calm at times. Drifted one small bay in particular for two hours with floating jigs and leeches with fair success - got a 15# northern that morning and 5 decent walleyes. The wind speed and direction were perfect during that time."
533965,nemio,2003-07-30 14:14:00,96,"You're right McQ, 100+ on the Gouin is fairly common when the fish are active and you got a good pattern. Habitually the biting is at his best when the wind is from the N-W specially from the mid June to the end of July; in August the numbers diminish but the size increase."
