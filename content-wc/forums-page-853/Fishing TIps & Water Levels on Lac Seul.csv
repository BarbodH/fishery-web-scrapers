Does anybody have any fishing tips about WAlleyes and NOrtherns for this rookie and what are the water levels like I hear the lake is way down this year? Thanks in Advance, The Rookies"

533987,Guest,2003-07-30 20:49:00,0,"Rookies, With the low water you need to keep an eye on your depthfinder and be careful. I saw several bent props and one smashed lower unit at the resort I was staying at. Start out on any windswept shoreline and cover some ground with a crawler on a spinner (two or three hook harness) or a spinner and minnow. We used fairly heavy bottom bouncers for weight so we could stay vertical and still cover ground. I would cover a variety of depths until you locate fish. One last tip, if you get to McKenzie Bay make sure you have plenty of bait! Good luck."

Personally, the walleye bite is so good, I couldn't be bothered specifically targeting pike. You have a better shot at catching big pike walleye fishing than you do pike fishing. This is always the case this time of year on Lac Seul. If you have your heart set on small pike, go and find large weedbeds, preferably close to deep water."

We did catch our biggest fish in MacKensie bay, but we caught fish everywhere we went. Leeches and Minnows on spinners, caught quite a few bonus Northerns. Keep a eye on the depth finder, I went from 14 feet to 0 feet a little to quick! Thank goodness for insurance! Joel"
