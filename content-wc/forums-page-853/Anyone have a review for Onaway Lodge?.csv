The one we really liked was Onaway Lodge. I know how things ""look"" and how things really ""are"" can sometimes be diffrent, so I'm hoping somebody with experience staying at this lodge will give me a thumbs-up or thumbs-down. We spoke with the owner and walked around his place for a while and feel pretty positive. But I'd like to hear some references from some guys (or gals) who have been there. With all due respect I'd rather just hear from those who have been to Onaway before. This is not an open invitation for everybody to send me a link to their current outfitter. Thanks in advance, this board has never let me down!"

Our group consisted of my Dad, Brother, Brother-in-law and myself. My dad has been fishing Canada for 30+ years, from fly-ins to drive-ins, and he said this is one of the nicest all-around places he has ever been to. From my standpoint, I thought it was a great place. The owners (Blair and Kathy) are very friendly and fair people. Their equipment is great (17ft Lunds with 50hp Hondas, swivel chair with flat floors). Small things make it a great place though. They have an ice maker for general use, so no more making your own. The fish cleaning house is awesome, as it has a grid-like floor, so clean-up falls into the lake (minus fishhead and bones of course). They have a phone you can use in the fishhouse, with a calling card. Cabin has plates, cups, nice shower, screened in porch (ours anyway), etc.. Actual fishing aside (which was great by the way), Onaway treated us great. My group (Mike Olson group, if you want them to know) has decided to go hear from now on. I HIGHLY recommend them, as I believe people who treat others well, as they did for us, deserve to be written about. Hope this helps! Mike Olson"

We'll be staying there as long as we live, probably. We're always there the second week of June, but I've also taken my wife there last year on a second trip. She also loved it. Fishing was just incredible again this year even though we couldn't get into Broad and Sunlight. I'll be back up there the second week of September this year with a different group of eight. I hope the water has come up some since June. I would highly recommend Onaway Lodge, without a doubt. Ron"
