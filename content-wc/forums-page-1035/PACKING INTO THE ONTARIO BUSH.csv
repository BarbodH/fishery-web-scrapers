511334,lenray,2001-03-05 12:13:00,467,We travel 600-800 miles north from where we live in Mi. -drive on 80 miles of gravel and maybe 20 more miles of hardly a road. We load a canoe on to the quad and go as far as that will take us. Next we take the canoe and an inflatible with a 1.2 hp. and portage from lake to lake and then travel a mile or two with backpacks overland into lakes that have great fishing. For you fellas who have went into the bush with all of the rocks streams and blowdowns you know that going a mile or two is very difficult work.We enjoy going to water that not many have been to in recent times. We carry very little in eat a few fish while there and bring none out.We study maps in the winter to determine which lake we will go to for the next year.I go up many times during the year and go to easier lakes on other trips but they are all lakes that we are the only ones on them. Just dreaming of open water-first trip up last year was May 5th and there was still some ice on part of the lake--trout-pike.On these sites many are talking about fly-ins-lodges drive to lakes etc. was wondering about others who like a little more adventure.Thanks len
511335,Frank from TBay,2001-03-05 13:15:00,312,Congrats lenray you are definitely hardcore. We will go as far as leaving the quad and doing a portage down to the lake. We head up lake to get our fishing. I do these four or five times a year. I like the sauna going and a barbecue at the cottage more these days even though the walleye are a little smaller............ definitely easier on the body and equipment. With more and more people going into the bush these days I do not like to leave equipment alone. I had an attempted theft on my quad last year.....they could not get it going. When they could not get it going they vandalized it. I used to be against capital punishment for theft (just kidding) but when I found my quad I could have pulled the lever. There are a whole group of criminals who cruise these areas looking for this type of thing. Be carefull out there. Good fishing: Frank

Would canoe and portage from lake to lake to river to lake. Would sometimes not see another person for 4 or 5 days. Caught some mighty nice speckled trout and grays. Now-a-days, with a bad back,(maybe too many portages) I just go to lakes I can drive to and launch my boat. Still have fun but miss the bush-whacking days. I have been ice fishing in Canada 3 times this winter but like you I can't wait for the thaw. Good luck this summer and be safe."
