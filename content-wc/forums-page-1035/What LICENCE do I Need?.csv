511267,Guest,2001-03-04 16:17:00,0,"The conservation lic. allows you two Walleyes, 2 northerns, 2 smallmouth, and 1 trout. The regular lic. allows you 4 walleyes, 4 northerns, 4 smallmouth, 2 trout. You must follow all specific lake limits. On LOW, if you are a US citizen who is staying at a resort, a regular lic allows you take 2 walleye a day with a bag of four fish. Just make sure you don't have 4 fish until you have been there for at least 2 days. Be sure to check the regs. Canada is more complicated than Windows NT."
