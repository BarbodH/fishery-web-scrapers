There are several private cabins and I think 2 or three resorts. Canyon Lake has decent Muskies, no Northerns, pretty good small mouth fishing but the Walleye fishing was very slow. Could only catch a few small ones at dusk. email me if you have any questions. [email protected]"

Fished muskies most of the time. You will see alot of fish, many in the mid 30"" range. Largest we caught was 44"". The water is fairly clear with limited areas of weeds. Caught enough walleye for a couple of meals. There are quite a few private cabins along the shoreline, and weekends will have more lake users, didn't see any jet skiers and only a couple of water skiers. Overall I enjoyed my times there, trying to decide about heading back this year, except now I""ve got a new baby to bring along.If you go e-mail me for some spots.Eric OlsonOregon, WI"
