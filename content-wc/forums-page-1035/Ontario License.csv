511324,Big Fish,2001-03-04 21:07:00,138,Is there any way to get an Ontario license by mail?
511325,Fred_G,2001-03-05 04:45:00,908,"The phone number is 519-354-7340 and their fax number is 519-354-0313. Call them and they will fax or mail you an application. Filling it out is a matter of listing your credit card number, your name and address and choosing what type of license you want. License fees are in Canadian funds and you will automatically get the current exchange rate using your credit card. Our group uses this service every year and it works great. Fred"
