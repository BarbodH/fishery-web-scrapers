511049,Guest,2001-02-11 09:54:00,0,I will be headed to Upsala to fish the savanne river and surrounding area. Any information on the how's and where's to fish would be appreciated.
511050,PJM,2001-02-22 18:54:00,3516,Lac Des Millac Lake is a great lake to fish. I need to know when you are going.
511052,Frank from TBay,2001-02-22 19:59:00,312,Lac Des Mille Lacs is a great place to fish. I spend a good part of the winter there. There are some good resorts on the lake that can help you out. Pine Point is good and Savanne River Landing is right on the river. Both have web sites. Good Luck: Frank
511053,PJM,2001-02-22 21:20:00,3516,FrankHave you ever been fishing Bolton Bay on Lac Des Mille Lac in late June or July. As you enter the bay and go straight down the middle there is a small lsland and before you get there if you start looking at your depth finder there is all kinds of rock reefs with some mud that north and south and east and west. Using night crawlers were the most effective on spinner or lindy rig for Walleyes. This area is not marked well on a map but there is no danger of hitting and rocks out there. Birch Narrows area is very hot for large pike also.
511054,Frank from TBay,2001-02-23 07:47:00,312,Lac is a great place to spend the summer. The lake is huge. You could spend your whole life fishing it and only scratch the surface. Our fish club is orientated to this lake. In the next years in conjunction with OMNR we are working at mapping the lake and identifying spawning areas. OMNR is also radio tracking Walleye there in the next years. They are looking at seasonal travelling of the fish. I would like to get involved with that project as the knowledge picked up would be great. Also the guys and girls out of the TBay office are great. Good fishing: Frank
511057,Guest,2001-02-23 19:17:00,0,"I usually go up there in late May, fishing is a riot. Loads of Walleye and Northern. No huge ones yet, but still have a good time. Bolton Bay is where I have done the best. A reef runs East West just South of the center from the double island to the mouth. If the wind is right drift the edge of it. Although I have not any navigation problems there, I do know of one on the east side of Hook Island. Stay near the island, dont go near the middle. You WILL put your boat on the rocks, been there done that, thankfully no damage. I was able to acquire maps last year, they are not the best but better than nothing. I stay at Maki Bay Resort, it isnt as dolled up as Pine Point but suits me just fine.Wylie"
511055,Guest,2001-02-23 19:24:00,0,"Frank,I have read your posts on Mahumbas and this page, you seem to know a lot about LDML. Do you guide at all? And if so ............. contact me, please. I would like to learn more about this lake. Like you said you could spend a lifetime on it and just scratch the surface, I get to spend a week a year. I'll be there the last week in May.Wylie[email protected]"
511056,Frank from TBay,2001-02-25 18:37:00,312,Hello Wylie......The resorts on the lake can provide you with guiding services. I spend most of the winter on the lake but little time in the summer. I like the winter because very few people are on the lake. Our fishing club 150 members) which I am treasurer fish this lake in the winter almost exclusively. LDML is a great lake for a variety of reasons including it is very easy to get to and the fishing is second to none for a drive in type lake. Good fishing: Frank
511051,Guest,2001-03-04 08:30:00,0,"Thanks for the replies, I will there the first week of july. Will the walleyes be deep in the lake or running the river?"
511058,Frank from TBay,2001-03-04 19:24:00,312,Ken Hagbert from Maki Bay is a good guy. He is very informed on the lake and spots to go. He will guide you if you are so inclined. We ice fish all winter only a few kilometres from his resort. He visits us on a regular basis. Good fishing: Frank
