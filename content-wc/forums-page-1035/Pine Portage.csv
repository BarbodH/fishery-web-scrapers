511229,Ketchenanny,2001-02-26 16:51:00,38,"I have not been to Pine Portage but I go to Kaby Lodge every year in early June. Both places are owned by the same family on the same lake. They run a A-1 business. Good food, cabins, boats and motors. Walleye and Pike fishing is great. Early June you can jig for walleye in 3 to 10 feet of water and have fun all day long. I bring a fly rod for pike and work the weed beds. This year will be flying in on June 1st, CAN'T WAIT."

My best advice is to get a guide the first day. It's a jig and minnow bite for the most part at the north end of the lake. Me and 3 others have had 120-150 fish days. Feel free to e-mail me at [email protected] with questions."
