We have excellent fishing up here for a variety of fish, monster muskies and smallies, and walleye fishing in the spring is out of this world, along with big pike and trout, it is a fishing extravagenza. We run 17' lund outfitters w/ 50hp yamahas rigged with 7520 pinpoint graphs and motors. You can choose from 12 different lakes to fish from, just depends on what type of fish you are looking for? Another thing, this year we are giving out master angler awards, with the biggest fish from each category wins a free trip the following year!!! Food and service is first class also! If you want a brochure please give us a call @ (218)283-0990. Good luck and good fishin!"

Last year, myself along with 7 others went there, we had the time of our lives! We caught 9 muskies over 46"", with the largest being 54 1/2"" in four days of fishing! If you love to catch big smallmouth, you're in luck. There equipment and accomidations are first class! I look forward to our trip this year and recommend this resort to everyone! I just talked to the new owner and he will be at the Minneapolis 10 day sport show coming up.Jared"
