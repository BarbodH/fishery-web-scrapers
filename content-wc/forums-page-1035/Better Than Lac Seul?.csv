511026,spongecake,2001-02-11 20:29:00,22,"Thanks, JMKC! Lindy rigs and bottom bouncers? I can do that. In fact, that sounds like more fun to me than just vertical jigging. And maybe that half-flat of crawlers I took on my last trip to Canada, but didn't use, won't go to waste. Might even try some cranks. Thanks again!"
511027,Fred_G,2001-02-12 13:30:00,908,"Lake St. Joseph is truly an excellent walleye lake. It is #4 on the In Fisherman list of the best walleye lakes. Lots of fish in the 18"" - 24"" range, and possibilty of much bigger. Last year we were catching big walleye while fishing for pike with 5 of diamonds spoons.I highly recommend The Old Post. John Grace and his staff are fantastic. Check out their website at www.oldpost.com. Good Luck! Fred"

511029,Guest,2001-02-12 20:29:00,0,"I HAVE FISHED LAC SEUL FOR 15 YEARS. I THINK ITS GREAT! HOWEVER FOR A FIRST TRIP WITH THE WIFE I BELIEVE THAT A MUCH SMALLER LAKE WOULD BE YOUR BEST BET. THIS LAKE HAS MANY BAD FEATURES, LARGE WAVES, HIDDEN REEFS,AND A MILLION ROCKS. NOT A PLACE FOR A INEXPERIENCED BOATER OR FISHERMEN."
511030,Guest,2001-02-14 08:35:00,0,"Lac Seul in my opinon is one of the best drive ins in Ont.Rough water is not a problem, with so many islands,bays, and river ways to hide in. And these are great fishing areas.I fish it a lot in the summer and big fish and a lot of fish."
511031,Glenn,2001-02-16 13:25:00,17,I fished Lac Seul for a number of years---- Great Walleyes---I was always there in early June or one year was August and still had good luck!!!I always stay at Dave's Fisherman Cove....really nice but not real cheap.
511032,Bert,2001-03-04 07:41:00,104,"I have to agree with Tank, Lac Seul is a pretty safe bet for good fishing without having to fly-in. Fished the NW side near Ear Falls in Sept., stayed at Evergreen Lodge (nice place, good management). Caught walleyes 2 to 7 pounds and northerns up to 39 inches. Can't wait to go back. Bring warm clothes and raingear just in case."
511016,spongecake,2001-02-09 16:50:00,22,"Help! I need someone to tell me that Lac Seul is really the place to go for Wallys and also some advice on a good resort -- I'm taking my wife with me for a week (housekeeping/own boat)in early September. I've been told repeatedly that Lac Seul is the best walleye lake I can drive to. Is this really true? I need to put a lot of fish in the boat -- trophy potential is a bonus -- to show my wife that the nice boat and all of the equipment I've got is really worth it. I mean, I don't want to go somewhere and scratch a few -- I need her rod bending a lot! I've fished Lake of the Woods at Nestor Falls, Lake Abrams & Minnitaki, and Lost Lake, just south of Lac Seul. Lost Lake is the only one that would meet my criteria for this trip -- lots of fish, but on the small side. But I want to try something new, hopefully even better.I've reviewed past postings and seen several other lake names: Scout Lake, Wabigoon, Pipestone, Press, Confederation.... Are any of these others going to be a better bet than Lac Seul in Sept? Anybody?"
511017,Guest,2001-02-09 20:20:00,0,"I spend the summer on Lac Seul, think it is a fantastic fishery, chances for a wallhanger are as good as anywhere. Has been a ""slot"" lake for quite a few years. Check out WWW.Lacseulwalleye.com , nice cabins , nice owners. Grouse hunting starts the 15th of Sept. The camp runs a hunting & fishing combination special. Check it out!"

I understand that this is not an objective opinion but coming from where I have heard this from it at least deserves checking into. I have checked into it, as much as I can, and ""IF"" I had a boat I must say it would be either near or at the top of the list. If I remember correctly the two main camps there are on the net under oldpost.com and something like camp lake st joseph.comgood luck....with the convincing......SteveFred_G posts here often and I do believe he likes it there..............Fred tell the man."
511019,spongecake,2001-02-10 06:53:00,22,"Thanks, Lobo. I took your advice and checked out the Oldpost website. St. Joe seems to be something special. I would definitely like to try it sometime -- however, the Oldpost seems to have a restrictive fishing calendar and are a bit pricey. I will give a call to the other contact for St. Joe, Gerry Cariou, and see what that's all about. One thing I did see on their website was reference to an old issue of Walleye-Insider that lists the top ten walleye waters in Ontario (Mar 2000). Being a longtime subscriber, I found that edition and see that in addition to Lac Seul and Red Lake, the English River and its lakes northwest of Lac Seul are also mentioned (Oak, Maynard, Seperation, Umfreville). Those might be another alternative for me if I decide that the big water (Lac Seul) will be just that -- too big/rough. ...still thinking. Thanks!"

511021,Guest,2001-02-10 11:19:00,0,"Spongecake, Try Seperation Lake Lodge 40 miles north of Kenora. I have fished this area since the late 70's. Lots of nice walleyes. Lodge is owned & operated by Jim & Cherlyn Jordan of Carthage, Ill. Winter phone # 217-357-3069- Summer phone # 807-224-4537. Can't find an e-mail address. This is a BOAT-IN lodge."
511022,spongecake,2001-02-10 18:50:00,22,"Boating-in works for me. Thanks, I'll give them a call and get their info. :O)"
511023,Guest,2001-02-11 10:58:00,0,"Spongecake, check out www.npfishcamp.com, we have been there several times and really like it, it is a outpost camp, park your car and they pick you up at the landing, its 4 to 5 miles down the English River to camp, its a very friendly camp, and has good food too. Lots of walleyes, northerns, smallmouth and musky's too. It is Southwest of Ear Falls, Ontario.check them outgood luck fishingSharon[email protected]"
511024,spongecake,2001-02-11 16:56:00,22,"Thanks, All, for the good suggestions. I've now spent several hours reviewing postings, brochures, and websites, and I'm leaning toward Separation Lake on the English River. Frankly, it's closer to home (8 hours rather than 10), and at least the folks at In-Fisherman feel it's one of the best choices.JMKC, you said you've been going there for years?? What can you (or anyone else who's fished the lake) tell me about the fishing and tactics? Does the water level fluctuate? Are there lots of lower unit eating reefs? Does it fish like a river or more like a regular lake? In other words, is current/current breaks a factor? What do you use for tackle/tactics? I will greatly appreciate any info provided."
511025,Guest,2001-02-11 19:48:00,0,"Spongecake, Seperation Lake fishes like a lake. You're right about rocky reefs-a talk with the lodge personnel should help you steer clear. We always just drag lindy rigs and bottom bouncers--leeches, crawlers, minnows inthat order. The only month I've fished up there is June. Fjord bay part of lake was always hot."
