511182,Bucks Rogers,2001-02-25 17:29:00,43,"I fish Dog Lake 2 0r 3 times a summer. There are walleyes, small mouth, perch and lake trout. There are four or five lodges on lake but I take PU camper. Try Ernies Cabins ,Northern Wilderness or Camp Missanabie. Don't have there phone numbers handy but if I remember right I posted the numbers previously. Search the archives. If you can't find them: email me and I will look around the house for them.Bucks"
511183,Guest,2001-02-27 22:32:00,0,"The other post is pretty much on the money. I have a personal camp on Dog, and lived in Missanabie for almost 20 years. If you plan on taking an RV, you can choose to stay at Ernies Campground or Island View Camp. If you wish to rent HK, you can go with Island View, Pioneer Lodge, Camp Missanabie, Ernies Campground or Northern Wilderness. Ernies and Island View are accessable by road, the rest pick you up and drop you off. The Gamefish in Dog are Walleye, Lake Trout, Northern Pike, Smallmouth, Yellow Perch and whitefish. Walleye average 1.5lbs, with 10lb+ possible. Lake trout over 30lbs. have been caught, and Northerns over 20lbs. The lake is stained, with flourescents working well for Eyes. Stillfishing for Lakers is common, but I prefer to use Downriggers. If there are any questions you need to know, feel free to E-mail me at [email protected]. In the meantime, here are some numbers for you.....Ernies Campground: (705) 234-2861 or (705)234-2812Island View Camp (705)234-2869Camp Missanabie (705)2342440Northern Wilderness (705)234-2582"
511184,lenray,2001-02-28 09:53:00,467,Dog lake is to big for this small time fisherman-I like Meath and the west end of Loch Lomond also fish MeKewen and for trout Blackfish south of town- we buy the conservation lic. and do not bring any home but eat a few pike and trout while there.The folks in Missanabie are very friendly and for a fun winter trip we snomobile up to Ernies for the burger from Wawa also stop at Clements but heard he passed away- he was a very interesting fella.Can you local fellas put me on a good catch release lake for pike- I have the quads and an inflatible that we backpack into the bush-looking for small lakes that haven't been opened up for logging-not interested in eyes. I am 200 miles south of the Soo and come up as many as 8 times per year.Most of my fishing is west of Manitouwadge but when we have a short time we like to come up your way.len
511185,Guest,2001-02-28 10:01:00,0,"Give Campbell lake a try. Get a map and find out how to get to Renabie. from there its maybe a two mile drive. I can't really explain how to get there, but if have a good local map, you should spot it easy enough. You may even be able to get there by truck, but I'd take the quads....loaded with pike...used to catch them by the dozens right from the pumphouse dock back when the mine was open. I can almost guarantee it has seen little, if any pressure in about 10 years..."
511186,lenray,2001-02-28 10:58:00,467,thanks MelonbobI found the lake on my map-a fella i met at ernies campground fishes Stephenson which would be North and West of this lake.Did they pump water out of this lake to the mines? It is the size I like to fish-I have wondered if any chemicals had leached into those waters near the mine due to the mining operations.I really don't have any info. in what occurs during the mining process.I have been on that property many times- very interesting things to see.Again thanks for you time.What are your snow conditions- I know Ernies boy is in the snomobile club up there.len
511187,Guest,2001-03-01 04:57:00,0,"Lenray, Water was pumped out of Campbell, but it was for the minesite drinking water only, and was not treated, so there is no danger of water contamination. There is another lake we called Smith right at the minesite itself. Actually it's more of a swamp. You probably wouldn't want to touch that one with a ten foot pole, but there are no fish in it anyways, minnows only. As for Campbell, the water is safe. At least I hope so, it came out of my tap for 12 years!!! LOLTake it Easy, Bob"
