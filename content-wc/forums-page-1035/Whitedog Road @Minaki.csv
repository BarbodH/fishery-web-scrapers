511224,Guest,2001-02-26 10:46:00,0,Someone told me that they were paving the rock road out of Minaki towards Whitedog Ontario. Does anyone know if that washboard has been paved? We use that road every year and it is a rough one. We were there last July and I did not see any work being done on the stretch I was on. Thanks!
511225,Guest,2001-02-27 09:05:00,0,I have not heard anything....but would be quite excited if this were true as my boat has a little too many stone chips for my likings as a result of this road. I will keep watching for a positive response to this question.I'm heading to the cottage this weekend which is about 20minutes south of this road. I will shop around for answers.
