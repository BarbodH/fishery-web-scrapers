Almost every walleye we caught was over 20 inches. Since then we have caught some big ones but not like that. Dog Lake is a great place to go and I plan to continue to go there, I would just like to know how to put the big ones in the boat every year. Any advice?"

511170,Guest,2001-02-23 10:08:00,0,"Part of the problem for many places near the Soo is that too many big ones were ""put in the boat"" in the last 40 years. Many of these lakes should be closed to fishing for ten years to catch up. For some reason catch and release, single hooks, and barbless hooks havnt caught on over here.just my opinion,lobo"
511171,Guest,2001-02-27 22:45:00,0,"I have to say I take a bit of offence to lobo's post. To make a statement that catch and release has not caught on took me by surprise. We have conservation licences you can buy for half the price which gives you a two fish limit. There is talk of reducing the posession limit from 6 to 4. Although there is differing views on slot sizes, many lakes have them in effect. I fish Dog lake all summer, and own a personal camp there. I don't believe there is any danger to the fishery. It is common to catch 40+ fish, and I'd say about 25-30% of these are over our slot size of 18"". With the exception of early spring(when I'm hungry) I use barbless hooks. I do admit, our fishery took a beating in the past, but who's hasn't? It's also easy to say close a lake for ten years when you don't live on it....Some advice for alaska....If your going in June, big walleye shouldn't be a problem on 1/8 oz jigs with a minnow. That's it. If your trying for size, increase your bait size. Use flourescents. If you're going a little later in the year, move out to some flats and try spinners or cranks..."

You are right, ""closed to fishing"" was way too strong of a statement AND out of line - my apologies.Sounds like you are doing your best up there. Good lucklobo"
511173,Guest,2001-02-28 06:22:00,0,"Thanks for your reply Lobo, I was hoping I wasn't going to get flamed for that one. I'm very passionate about where I live and work hard to preserve the fishing up here. I believe Northern Ontario has close to, if not the best fishing in the world, and I'd like to keep it that way. Unfortunately, there are a few bad apples, I'll be the fisrt to admit, who abuse our resources, and if it continues, things won't keep up forever. I also believe that our government has to let go of some outdated regulations. In a perfect world, we'd see all these slot limits eliminated, and a lower catch limit integrated. Also, I believe part of our problem is limited manpower on the part of our conservation officers. You can put all the regs you want into place, but it isn't going to do a lick of good if there aren't enough people out there to enforce them!!Tight Lines!!!"
