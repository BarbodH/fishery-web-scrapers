510585,MH,2001-02-27 21:51:00,30,"Funks boathouse is a place for people that don't know how to fish, that need to catch fish. Me on the other hand, i go where the fish are big and where no one knows. Maybe you should stop fishing at Funks."
510581,Guest,2001-02-28 04:54:00,0,"Our group has been fishing Minaki the first week of August for several years now. We have had good luck using deep running cranks (Reef Runners, Thundersticks, and #9 Shad Raps) without dipsey's, downriggers, or leadcore. The fish are suspended in 100+ depths but seem to come up after the baitfish. The down-rigger or dipseys might help, but certainly aren't necessary. I can say that I don't see a lot of people using them.We also do a lot of bottom bouncing in 20'-40' depths on the many reefs in Big Sand. We usually bottom bounce in the morning and afternoon, then troll cranks in the evening. We've got reservations for the first week in August, so we might run into you toward the end of your stay.Good luck!"
510586,Guest,2001-02-28 11:37:00,0,"Ok, you're the best. Question, if you're so good why don't you fish tournaments or even fish the pro-am as a PRO ? Just wondering."
510587,MH,2001-02-28 14:01:00,30,"I fished twice in the pro-am. The second time i came in 9th place. After that the pro-am doesn't interest me much anymore. Anyway I wouldn't want to take the first prize away from someone every year because that just wouldn't be fair to everyone. Just like you said I'm the best. The best there is, the best there ever will be."
510588,Guest,2001-02-28 14:10:00,0,"9th place on the ""AMATUER"" side, nice. Why not do the ""PROFESSIONAL"" side where the real Anglers fish ? My personal best, second on the ""PROFESSIONAL"" side. Why not fish pro if you're that good ? Or would you rather just be another Minaki guide? You sure that your name isn't Dino ?"
510589,MH,2001-02-28 14:36:00,30,Why don't you just tell me who you are and i can say a thing or two about you too. Oh your to scared to tell me who you are because you are just a Jabroni.
510582,IaCraig,2001-03-01 11:06:00,434,"C.M. Effective trolling depths can vary each day, but we have always had decent luck without needing down-riggers or snap weights. Last August we hit a couple evenings where if you had on a deep crank bait 15'+ you were under the fish, I actually was trolling with floating Rapalas and knocking them dead. The previous August deep diving reefrunners were the ticket and outfished everything else 3 to 1. Since we have been going to Minaki in Late July or Early August, the fishing has been consistently good. My method of choice is bottom bouncing or jigging with leaches by day and trolling in the evenings, but it seems Duane has been doing more trolling each year and catching bigger walleyes than ever. (I'd bet Duane is one of the best fishermen in the area) We get to know the lake a little better each year, which adds to our success. But I think the area is getting better too for fish in the 18 - 21 class sizes. IaCraig"
510583,Guest,2001-03-02 04:04:00,0,"Thanks for the help IaCraig and IaTag. We will be there from the 28th of July to the 4th of August. I have a blue and white 1891 Warrior, so say hello if you see us there. Thanks again."
510584,Guest,2001-03-03 09:35:00,0,"C.M.,August 4th will be our first day in camp, so it looks like there won't be much opportunity to talk. Our's will be a father and son outing, two 40 yr. olds with their 70+ old fathers. We'll be fishing out of my friend's maroon Crestliner.We've been staying at Paradise Cove almost every year for over 10 years now. We usually book the week before the walleye Pro-Am.I'm definately not an expert on either walleye fishing or on the Minaki area, but if you would like some additional information about what you can expect, drop me an e-mail and I'll try to help out.Hope you enjoy the area as much as we do!"

510571,Guest,2001-02-23 19:12:00,0,"Who are you? ""The guy who knows"". We must know eachother if you are talking that kind of SMACK."
510576,ggg,2001-02-23 19:36:00,115,"I fished Minaki 16 times in 11 years. Every year as we learnedthe system better, we did better fishing. Many walleyes over 10 lbs. and a few northerns over 20. That system changescompletly from week to week and a lot depends on the volume ofwater comming down the river. If your looking for monstermuskies, thats the place to go. I have seen some monsters caughtand I once saw a guy catch a 33 lb. northern. We either stayedat Bayview with Brian or Paradise with Duane. Both are good places. This system can intimidate a beginner because it'svery big and deep. Good luck."

510577,BobEaton1,2001-02-24 22:17:00,106,"Great place to fish. I have been going there for 15 years and every year it gets better. I stay at Paradise Cove and already have reservations for September 2001. Duane and his people are great and the place is second to none. Very nice set up. You have gas, bait, and everything you need for a wonderful fishing trip. In the last 2 years I have caught 12 Walleyes over 9lbs biggest 11.6lbs. Northern fishing is also great many over 15lbs every day and the Muskies are huge and lots of them. If you like Small Mouth Bass it's also a great place with lots of nice ones and I have a 6.8lber on my wall. Last year there were 15 of us and this year all 15 are going back. Hope to see some of you guys up there some time.BobOmaha,NE"

510578,MH,2001-02-27 13:59:00,30,"Spring time fishing has to be the best time of the year to go fishing, especially for big walleyes. The best place to go I think is about 15 minutes away from paradise, but I can't tell you where it is because It would give away my hot spot."
510579,Guest,2001-02-27 14:03:00,0,"You still sitting up by Funks Boathouse ? You know, there are tons more spots to fish. But then again, you're just a Puppy"
510580,Guest,2001-02-27 21:47:00,0,"My wife and I are going to Paradise Cove in the end of July through the beginning of August. I have never been to this resort or the lake and was wondering what to expect as far as fishing this time of the year. I spoke with Duane on the phone and he said there was a pretty consistant crank bait bite through the summer. Can anyone tell me approximately how deep I will need to be running the baits. Will I need downriggers, or will leadcore or dipseys work. Thanks in advance for everyone's help."
510561,Guest,2001-01-15 22:02:00,0,Considering go to Minaki. What do you all think ?Dave
510562,Guest,2001-01-16 05:31:00,0,Lots of fish and Lots of people!
510563,Guest,2001-01-16 12:04:00,0,"I have fished west and north of Minaki for 10 years. I have never fished right in Minaki itself. We have had good fishing where we go for walleyes, some big northerns, and an occasional smallmouth. I would rather catch a cold than a northern but some of my brothers and friend like to fish for them. Minaki area itself did look crowded but I hear some good things about the fishing there. E-mail me @ [email protected] for more info if you want it."
510564,Guest,2001-01-17 16:56:00,0,"Good choice, lots of fish all summer long I have a cabin thereand last summer I found fishing to be very good! I can't remember a day last summer that fishing was bad, three hour limits were the norm for us. Early season was jigging in the river which produced lots of walleyes, the rest of the summer we mostly used bottom bouncers with a leech and shad raps on a down rigger in Big Sand lake. You should not have a hard time finding fish good luck. I'm going there to ice fish this weekend..."
510565,Guest,2001-01-17 17:15:00,0,"HEY, where is your cabin ? Is there a chance we know each other ?Good FishenRob"
510567,IaCraig,2001-01-19 22:40:00,434,How do you go about getting a cabin on Bog Sand lake? 100 year lease? Win the lottery? Build your own? Snap a picure of the prime minister in a naughty act? Die and go to heaven?1 envious IaCraig
510568,Guest,2001-01-20 10:51:00,0,"Fished Minaki and Big Sand for 14 years straight in Mid June and it seemed every year got worse. Quit going there cause there was too many people and the fishing was slow. We knew the area well and the reefs very well and had many spots to chose from. Yet, there were days where we came back to camp fishless. It seemed that sometimes Big Sand would just go completely dead. Been going to other places in Ontario that have more action. But, i got to admit that when the fish are biting Minaki has some giant eyes."
510575,Guest,2001-01-24 20:40:00,0,thanks all
510566,Guest,2001-02-22 22:29:00,0,I've been fishing in minaki for about eight years now and I found the fishing at the time I started going there better than it is now. I have to admit there are still big fish in that lake and you do have lots of days of good fishing
510569,Guest,2001-02-22 22:34:00,0,I have to agree. I'm a guide at Paradise cove and there were some days where you would return back to the camp with no fish. There are just some days where it's like that. It always seems that Duane always catches fish when he goes out. He must have a good supply of TNT.
