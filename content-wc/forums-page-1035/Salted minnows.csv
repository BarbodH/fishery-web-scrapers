We put a couple dozen shiners in a baggy, throw in 2-3 tablespoons of salt, enough that they are thoroughly covered, then throw them in the freezer, they will keep fresh in your ice cooler until you use them. If they lay out in the sun for a few hours they get kind of leathery and sunken, but fish don't seem to mind. Recently we started using borax instead of salt, it doesn't dehydrate them so much. You can get borax at your pharmacy, grocery stores don't usually carry it."
511260,Guest,2001-03-01 17:42:00,0,Hi Keith:We usually salt the minnows ourselves from leftovers we have from fishing trips. We lay them out on newspaper to dry them off and salt them with table salt or course salt put them in a freezer bag and toss them in the freezer. They work pretty well and seem tough enough when we need them a couple months later.

511263,Guest,2001-03-05 12:27:00,0,Get your minnows free or at little cost at most bait shops--ask for their recent died minnows-get the best golden shiners or any short-lived minnows you want.Use a MIXTURE of borax 25% and salt. Salt alone make them brittle and sucks all the moisture out of them. Borax will keep their color and keep them pliable. Your wife probably has it on her clothes washing shelf--its used as a clothes washing additive. Buy it at any supermarket detergent dept.Small box will last your lifetime. Put them in baggies after cured and freeze until a day before you use them. They will keep without refrigeration pretty well.
