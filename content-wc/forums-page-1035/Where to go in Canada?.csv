Evergreen is a nice place and well run. The owners will give you plenty of info on where to fish. Golden Fawn is also a good place to stay. If you have never been to Lac Suel before it is big water and it can be very rough. The fishing areas are gennerally isolated and the big challenge is getting to them when crossing open water. If you are there in May or June, plan on at least one or at least a partial day of being docked because of the weather. Make sure you have a good rain suit and bring your winter gear. The weather can be brutal. July and August is good time to go to Lac Suel. It's when I go. The weather is much better although the winds usually kick up in the afternoon, and that can make for a bumpy ride back to the dock. The W's are located on most main channel points and islands. McKenzie and Steamboat Bays are very productive and the fish are easy to find. We gennerally use jigs and minnows on cloudy days and drag spinners and naked hook lindys with minnows on sunny days. LacSuel is a good choice, once you fish it you will be back over and over again. TGG"
