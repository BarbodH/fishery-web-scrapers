6673270,Mojo-NC,2022-07-17 10:29:00,1929,"We just returned on Friday (7/15) from my first houseboat trip on Lac Seul that was captained by none other than WC's own PJ Shorthorn. He was a great captain! The water was high but manageable with minimal floating debris. We followed a published navigational route from a paper map that was supplemented by my fish finder GPS loaded with the Navionics Canada chip. The route was spot on. We beached the boat in the Brechin Bay area between Kekabeka Narrows and Chamberlain Narrows. There wasn't a lot of beach available because of the high water, but enough to safely beach the boat for the week. It took about 6 hours to get there from base camp. Mosquitoes were horrible after dusk, but almost nonexistent during the day, especially if there was a breeze. We primarily fished for walleye and pike using the traditional methods of spinner rigging and jigging. Crawlers worked much better than minnows, but I still fished almost exclusively using artificial baits. Spinner rigs with crawlers caught about twice as many fish, but for the most part the artificial baits caught larger fish. The fish were pretty spread out throughout the week. We finally found a point that had a concentration of walleyes and caught 40 nice fish in about 1.5 hours or so. That was the only concentration of fish that we found throughout the week, but half of us had never fished Lac Seul previously and we spent a lot of time trying to figure it out. Trolling crankbaits was a successful method of catching both walleyes and pike along with a few smallmouth bass. Overall we caught a lot of walleye and pike, but the largest pike was 37.5"" and the largest walleye was 23.5"". It's been a long time since I didn't catch at least 1 walleye over 26"" and someone in our group almost always catches a 40"" pike. I think I would attribute that to our unfamiliarity with the waters and not knowing where to focus our attention. All in all we had a great time fishing and hanging out with great company. Many thanks to Captain PJ, without whom we could not have done the trip. We saw several bears, many eagles, beaver, and otters, all of which was very cool. We also had to compete with very few other boats, which was somewhat unexpected considering we were fishing on Lac Seul. We caught lots of fish and have some new memories that will last forever! Oh yeah, crossing the border both directions at INL/Ft Francis was a piece of cake with very short waits. We weren't even asked about vaccination status, most likely because we had already entered the information on the ArriveCAN app. The roads were in great shape and the weather was as nice as I've ever experienced in Canada. We even got to fish in shorts for my first time ever!"

6673354,Yellowfin123,2022-07-17 19:17:00,2182,how many boats did you drag up behind the houseboat?? rentals or did somebody pull their own boat up there?
6673360,Mojo-NC,2022-07-17 19:24:00,1929,"We pulled two boats - a camp boat that comes with the houseboat plus one upgrade boat. None of us brought our own boats, but we did bring quality portable fish finders with GPS and Navionics."
6673384,PRO-V16,2022-07-17 20:04:00,454,This time of year we get out of that channel area after mid-June. You can still have good fishing but the bite is usually much better on the bigger water fishing reefs vertically.
