6673264,bigeee99,2022-07-17 09:50:00,8,We were with Air Mont-Laurier and had to pay $9 for a 4 L jug of water and $17 a gallon for gas. Just wondered if those charges were normal or a bit high?
6673348,Pooch,2022-07-17 19:01:00,4618,"On the high side I wold say. Paid $10 plus 13% HST in camp last week. Depending where the camp is located probably dictates the cost of everything. Especially if it has to be flown in or remote location for delivery. $9 for just over a gallon of water? Again the above applies, but dang!Pooch"

With regards to $9.00 for a gallon of water, you just have to look into a water filtration system. I have seen these in the quart to half gallon size. Won't take too many gallons for the system to pay for itself."
