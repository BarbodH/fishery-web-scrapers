I'll be driving north of Sioux Narrows on Friday the 22nd, and I'm hoping to find a way to skirt around the construction. I don't know how far north the construction goes, but Google Maps shows that you can turn north at Devlin then wind your way west and hit 71 about 5 or 6 miles north of the intersection. It's not visible on this screen capture, but when I blow up the map a bit more, I see there's another road which I assume is a dirt or gravel road that continues even farther north. I drew the red line to show where this road is.Does anyone know if either of these roads will bypass the construction and is this a smart way to go if you're pulling a boat?"
