Garmin lists the current draw @ 12v for the Striker Plus 4 as .023A (same as the Striker 4 which doesn't have Quickdraw capability), but would have others seen that that current draw is significantly higher if recording using Quickdraw? I'm considering using the feature during a 5 day fly in, but am concerned using Quickdraw could quickly eat up the power in my two 7aH batteries I will have. Thanks for any insights."

The way they list the current draw specs on their units seemed odd too me as they were always much higher compared to Humminbird and Lowrance. At least the last time I checked. I would assume running Quickdraw won't draw too much more power given it is just recording the depths that are already being captured over time. Screen size, screen res, screen color and backlight seem to eat up more juice than anything. I assume there is no way to charge your batteries at camp? Might be worth checking into a way to do this if not. There are plenty of options these days. Although, none are perfect. You might consider investing in some Lithium batteries as well. Well worth it."

It makes sense that running more complex software and more CPU computations will draw more power.I'm am amazed at how long my unit runs on one charge. I wonder if the 0.023 A rating is the max draw. Perhaps they both have the same max, but the Quickdraw spends more time closer to the max?"
