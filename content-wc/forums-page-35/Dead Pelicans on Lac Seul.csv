Wild birds are apparently the major reservior for influenza diversity, with at least 130 strains identified in wild birds, and new combinations popping up all the time. Tracking, monitoring, and strain identification are useful, not so much from the perspective of wild birds, but for human and domestic animal health planning."
6673640,shortmag,2022-07-18 16:03:00,70,"White pelicans have been expanding their range for at least 15 years. They were never seen in Idaho, Montana, and Ontario prior to the expansion. It is likely part of the ebb and flow of some populations. They can eat a lot of fish and sometimes target spawning areas. Their predation has been impacting fish populations in recent decades and is well documented. A reduction in their population may be just what some fisheries need."
6673650,PRO-V16,2022-07-18 16:42:00,454,I saw pelicans in Ontario almost 40 years ago so not new there.
6673674,NWwalleye,2022-07-18 19:46:00,223,I saw dead several pelicans on Clay and Lac Seul as well.. Can believe the number of these birds in this area now. Hundreds of them on most lakes in the area ..
6673140,Pooch,2022-07-16 16:34:00,4618,"Ran across a bunch of dead Pelicans on Lac Seul last week. These photos were taken on the east side of Manitoba Point. Many of you know where this location is. I contacted MNR and they referred me to another agency, but that agencies website does not work for reporting such matters. The below is the email response that I did get. We did not count, but there were several dozen in the immediate area. There were also eggs that had holes in them and the contents sucked out. There were otters in the immediate area that were probably responsible for the egg preditation. PoochOur ministry is aware of High Path Avian Influenza (HPAI) in White Pelicans in the Northwest portion of the province which has lead to some die-offs in Ontario. This may be the cause for the die off in Manitoba as well. We recommend that your colleague or any other member of the public report cases of sick or dead birds to the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative at 1-866-673-4781. All my best, ""Woeller, Kathy (NDMNRF)"" <[email protected]> Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources"
6673166,prov1800,2022-07-16 19:05:00,5010,Interesting.Theres so many of them.
6673194,N_of_Quibell,2022-07-16 21:38:00,151,"Thanks for the interesting report. You are to be commended for reporting it to the appropriate authorities, although in my opinion the MNR dropped the ball. At least in the US, when a citizen reports such a mortality event in a species covered by international migratory treaties to a state DNR, the DNR usually contact the appropriate federal authority, and don't turf it back to the citizen (I know this because I retired from the USGS National Wildlife Health Lab). Maybe pelicans are like cormorants in Ontario, and don't get any respect - I noticed Ontario opened a hunting season on cormorants last year (at least they don't require you to eat the darned things!)"
6673210,stjoeguy,2022-07-17 05:49:00,979,"We saw a dead pelican floating in Lake St. Joseph this year. It was just one, but it's the first time I've every seen that. It seemed like there were more pelicans than normal this year. Good for you reporting it. I wondered what the cause was, but it never occurred to me to report it."
6673220,Thunder Bay Walleye,2022-07-17 06:10:00,56,Have seen a couple of dead ones floating down the Kaministiquia River in Thunder Bay as well. Food for the eagles and gulls. Big birds. Huge flocks. Together with the Cormorants they eat alot of fish every day.
6673390,PRO-V16,2022-07-17 20:08:00,454,I saw a dead pelican float past us opener week on LotW in Morris Gap. First dead one I've ever seen.
6673408,Lmbkiller,2022-07-17 21:46:00,639,"It is well known avian influenza has run rampant this yr basically everywhere. Means nothing, who cares, there's nothing to stop it and there's no saving birds that get it. There were 1000s and 1000s of light geese that died this spring in the plains and no one really cared. So what if a bunch of pelicans died from it. Many bald eagles died from it in wi. Point is, it happens, life will go on. Dnr, mnr, etc are aware and are monitoring. Nothing can be done. The world will be fine with less pelicans, bald eagles, and light geese"
6673416,Pooch,2022-07-18 03:02:00,4618,I somewhat agree with you. Though the spread of the Avian flu' has really damaged the poultry industry here in the states. Not tracking and understanding where it is spreading would be foolish as it can effect domestic species.Snow Geese? Pretty tough on fall seeded crops every spring. Unbelievable flocks of them along the river every year. They are a problem in some areas.Might want to add Cormorants to your list. Eagles don't seem to be a problem.Pooch
6673430,Skywagon,2022-07-18 05:03:00,1106,"We can spare a few less eagles, they kill the young loon, pick them right off the water. The eagle population has more than rebounded, the loon population has declined."
6673436,pjshorthorn,2022-07-18 05:14:00,5654,"Out of curiosity, are Eagles a protected species in Canada like they have been in the US ? PjShorthorn"
