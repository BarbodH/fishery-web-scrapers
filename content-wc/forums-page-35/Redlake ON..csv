6671426,BankerFish,2022-07-08 16:02:00,27,"well, not sure if this will calm you down or not... we were there 6/27 - 7/1 and the fish were on fire! we didn't make it any further west than Howie and MacNeely, spent a lot of time in east. all the 15-16"" eaters you want, jigs/minnow in 10-12 fow, occasional sow in the 24"" - 28"" range. 3 in a camp boat, 60-90 fish per day...typical morning/evening bite but there was never the typical ""slow"" period during mid day. they'll hit ned rigs when you run out of minnows. find a windblown island with rocky bottom and 62-65 surface temp and pull jigs at 1.5mph around it. then go find another island and do the same thing. it's worth the walk up hill to the essex gas station for minnows, much better quality/size consistency at same price as the other vendors...the brand new Clark's bait shop at Cochenoer (sp??) was still closed since august of 2021... had 1 crappy weather day during the middle of the week, other than that daytime temps were in the 60-70 degree range with tolerable bugs. surface level was about 18"" up and they didn't have all of the prop busters jugged/marked yet. lower chikuni between Red and Keg had more bouys in the wrong vs. correct spot, so boater beware. have fun!"

We caught numbers on the gull rock but not many big ones. Dead calm one day and it was a dead sea other wise it was a great time fishing. Hiway 105 has a few places with gravel where the road was washed out, kind of rough those spots. Saw 2 moose on 105 on way home, that was cool."
6671798,stevensinks,2022-07-11 08:45:00,330,Thanks for the reports. Please keep them coming. I still have 11 days to go.
6672382,LoDo,2022-07-13 10:37:00,721,Leave Aug 8 for West end of Red Lake. Please keep the reports coming. Would love to hear from our Bow Narrows friends. I understand Black Bear is closed this year.
6672574,stevensinks,2022-07-14 07:33:00,330,LoDo Ill post a report when we get back. Do you stay at Bow Narrows ? It looks like Black bear is closed. I miss the reports from them but I guess there will be fewer boats on the west end this year. Just one more week and we will be on our way.
6673064,LoDo,2022-07-16 10:45:00,721,We have a group that owns a cabin on the West End. Please send a report when you have a chance. Have a great trip!!
6671064,stevensinks,2022-07-06 20:40:00,330,Anyone have any reports from Redlake ? My wife and I will be heading up there in a couple weeks so just looking for any info. Thanks
6671074,Walleye2242,2022-07-07 03:58:00,263,Where you headed? I am at gullrock in mid august. Not many red lake and gullrock fishing reports lately.
6671130,stevensinks,2022-07-07 08:43:00,330,We will be at Bow Narrows on the very west end the last week of July. There sure aren't many reports. I wish there were it would help to calm me down.
6671138,bthomas3333,2022-07-07 08:55:00,465,Hey - I fished there opening week a few years ago. There was still so much ice on the lake we had to fly in verses drive in. It is a beautiful part of the lake. They have pretty nice cabins and a few extra amenities like the food. The fishing was tough because the water was like 41/42 degrees. We did find some massive pike on dead bait. Overall the water looks really good and you won't have to deal with the messed up water temp. Definitely make the run over to where the river dumps into Douglas. I've heard there are usually some walleyes there and a beautiful part of the lake.Brett
6671140,Golden Eagle,2022-07-07 09:19:00,2642,"Red Lake locals enjoy some of the best walleye fishing on our planet. Every year. Don't expect them to jump onto this thread to share where, when and how."
6671164,Eckohlt,2022-07-07 10:44:00,3685,"Don't wry get some sleep,you'll pound the fish."
6671180,Walleye2242,2022-07-07 12:15:00,263,Agree....its worth the extra driving. The fishing is always top notch.
6671230,stevensinks,2022-07-07 18:25:00,330,bthomas333 I remember the year you had to fly in. As I recall the ice went out fast after you got there. The first year I was there I was with a group of guys. We went the first the first week of June the water was still cold and we got Lake Trout up buy shore. After that my wife and went up 12 years in a row then we had to miss the past 2.So We are really looking forward to getting back up there . I tell everyone at home that we fish up there to have an excuse to be there. Its a great -place
6671310,Cgillespie,2022-07-08 06:55:00,120,"Made our first trip up there in mid-June, it was absolutely awesome. We flew out to Cat Island Lodge on Trout Lake and had a great time. We'll be back for sure."
6671392,LoDo,2022-07-08 12:50:00,721,"We were on the west end of Red Lake June 8 to 18. We caught big walleyes and big northern, but our group felt the numbers were down. The water level was really high, bait fish EVERYWHERE, mayfly hatch, etc... The lake was full of food. We felt water temps were cool too for that time of year. Late ice out. Bow Narrows guests we spoke with felt the numbers were down a hair too. On the flip side to repeat, the fish caught were HUGE. We caught dozens of 35""+ northerns. 43"", 42"", two 41"" and a ton of 35 to 40"". The walleyes were in the 22 to 27"" range. We kept hearing the best time to fish the west end of Red Lake was Aug. Headed back up 8 to 18."
