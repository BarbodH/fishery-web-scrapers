6634648,nitroman,2022-02-18 10:04:00,368,we need something other than covid to talk about. No one started a countdown thread yet so.... 108 for us! My wife and I are headed up a week before the group trip this year so she and I can have a week to fish together. We are going to try Crooked pine lake staying at the Arrowhead in Nestor falls. After that we meet the group in Vermilllion bay Friday night for an over night then headed to Cedar Point for our normal week. Pretty excited for this trip as we have fished Rainey Lake the last 2 years and are excited for Canada again. Where ya'll headed this year?
