6673262,bigeee99,2022-07-17 09:47:00,8,We just got back from 6 days fishing at Lac Du Male on the Gouin.. Water is 7 feet up from normal levels and fishing was really tough especially jigging. A good day was 10 and we had a few days with less than 5 per man which is different from the normal 40 or 50. The guys trolling were doing a bit better but everyone there said the fishing was the toughest they ever remembered. We worked all the depths from 8 feet to 45 and our finder rarely read more than one fish at a time though we did see numerous large schools of bait fish. Still had a good time but we really had to work for fish. Largest was 25Â” and only one other exceeded the slot.

Did a front move in while you were there? Any idea how the fishing was prior to your week? Did you target pike at all or just walleye? Pete"
