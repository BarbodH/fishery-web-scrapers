I'm mainly wondering how tough navigating Pelican Rapids is? Does the high water this year make it safer or more dangerous? Can you motor through slow the first time to get a safe path plotted? Traditionally, when staying in Sioux Lookout I trailer up to Deception, but in looking at the map, it seems boating would save me 15-20 minutes a day and I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of loading on a trailer every time. Burn a little more gas obviously, but boat time is always better than truck time. Thanks"
6672948,prov1800,2022-07-15 17:43:00,5010,Been through there a few times.Water would be high enough but still need to know the right route. Don't just blast through.it will be moving pretty fast and will need speed to go down and need power to go back up.
6673036,IaDave14,2022-07-16 07:22:00,99,I talked to a guy that is up there now and he has been staying in Sioux Lookout and trailering to Deception Bay since 2015 along with fishing Minnitaki. He said right now Minnitaki is better than Lac Suel and is the best he has seen for size and numbers. I am heading up in Sept so I hope that is the case I would rather spend time on the water than driving. If you do try Minnitaki please post a report I am curious if what he said is true.
6673040,prov1800,2022-07-16 07:40:00,5010,I fish a lot of lakes as my guiding takes me to them.There all on fire in there own way and Minnitaki is always good but nothing compares to Lac Suel.Ive spent a couple if weeks now on Lac Suel and its nothinÄ£ short of fantastic.Numbers are normal but size wise is amazing.Who ever said LS is slow doesnt know the lake very well.
6673044,IaDave14,2022-07-16 07:46:00,99,Wow I just posted what he told me since I'm not there I have no way of knowing. I don't doubt your knowledge since you are there full-time but don't you get paid to guide on Lac Suel?
6673048,prov1800,2022-07-16 07:53:00,5010,I get paid to guide on a bunch of lakes.Got nothing to do whether I get paid.Just stating a fact.You can beleive me or not.
6673052,x4flatfish,2022-07-16 08:14:00,319,"To the original poster....I have run Pelican Rapids for about 50 years. If you have never done it before, you need someone to take you through both directions to learn the path. It can be intimidating your first few times but should be ok this year with the water level still up. You can also trailer to Hudson and launch into Lost Lake and avoid the rapids. Deception Light is the same on the water distance from there or Deception landing..."
6673102,IaDave14,2022-07-16 13:59:00,99,I don't doubt you at all you know the area but when is the last time you were on Minnitaki? All I did was try to help out from what I heard currently to maybe let the original poster know he might want to try Minnitaki before he travels all the way to Lac Suel. BTW I was with a group that hired you out of Onaway in 2015 and since it was our first time there you helped us greatly. Sorry the thread got hijacked it wasn't my intention.
6673112,prov1800,2022-07-16 14:58:00,5010,I have never guided on Minnitaki.My wife worked in Sioux and lived on Abram.So brought my boat there many times over the 11 years she was there.Had a lot of time to learn the lake and have friends there from my railroad days who showed me around.Ispent a lot of time on Abram by myself and will say that's a great fishery to and doesn't get fished much.When I went with friends on Lac Suel they all tended to travell 20 mi before fishing.On my own I found deception and the zig zag area just as good. Was told not to waste my time there.lol.Amazing what you find when you just put around shorelines and take your time.Cutring across the lake sometimes you get lucky and find interesting structure.Glad I could help you out at Onaway.Fishing has been fantastic on that side.
6673184,capec001,2022-07-16 20:22:00,2,I was on Lac Seul about 3 weeks ago. Water still at historic highs. The lake is full of floating driftwood. Fishing was great but watch out for the logs
