6672246,reddemon2,2022-07-12 17:03:00,255,This was just posted on Facebook Ok guys a few updates from Wine Lake. The last few weeks weather has been pretty good. We have been having light winds and temps from mid 60's to 80 degrees. We have had some rain but not a bunch. The fishing has been really good as well We have officially caught and documented the first crappie caught in Wine Lake. He was caught by the falls on a jig. We have also been doing very well in big pike week in and week out. We are getting at least 2 to 5 over 40 every week with lots in the mid 30's. The walleye have really turned in and most guests are getting many in the 20-25 range daily. There have been plenty of waters as well. Smallmouth have been abundant and are just coming off their beds. This has happened very late as it has taken a long time for water to warm up this year. The last two weeks we have pulled in lots in the 20 range. The lake trout have finally went deep and we are now catching in the 45 feet of water area. The last couple weeks have been a bit slower they try to figure out where they went. Believe it or not they stayed in 30 feet of water all the way to the end of June. They have finally started to settle into summer areas. We have begun to bring in all the materials to build the new dock as high water wiped it out. Hoping to have completed In next two to three weeks. The portage is back to where we can use our docks again finally and the floor of the boat house is drying out. Hopefully we should be back on track soon. The vaccine mandate has been extended through September. We will see what happens then. Make sure you are spreading the word about Wine lake so we can continue to grow and make sure we flourish during these rough times. Also make sure you are booking for next year as it is starting to fill up. We are already filling up in July and august. See you at the Lake Soon!
