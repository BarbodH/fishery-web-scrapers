6672832,Pooch,2022-07-15 11:06:00,4618,"Just wanted to thank you for the secret to bullhead fishing in Ontario information you sent. Limited out the first day. Dang good eating, too. Deep fried with batter of BBQ sauce and a dash of Tarter Sauce really went over with the group. Two rolls of TP later and the cabin seems to be getting back to normal. Pooch"
6672842,Eckohlt,2022-07-15 11:22:00,3685,What is the limits on bullies? Do they have to be 18 n under?
6672916,Pooch,2022-07-15 16:07:00,4618,"The slot is 4 to 6 inches. Three ""unders"" and one ""over'. Must be dead in live well and your fish lunch counts against your limit that day. Pooch"
6672926,walleyecheek,2022-07-15 16:27:00,2231,Takes alot of willow cats to feed a bunch of hungry men !
6672930,Eckohlt,2022-07-15 16:43:00,3685,"There just appetizers,bull head fingers."
6672934,Eckohlt,2022-07-15 16:46:00,3685,"Willow cats don't come cheap,from what I hear a buck apiece!must be good eating!"

6671098,Skywagon,2022-07-07 06:01:00,1106,Check your emails.
6671142,Golden Eagle,2022-07-07 09:22:00,2642,I'll bet there's some interesting conversation going on between Pooch & Skywagon.
6671162,Eckohlt,2022-07-07 10:42:00,3685,Maybe pooch wants to borrow his float plane!!
6671168,Golden Eagle,2022-07-07 10:47:00,2642,Which plane? There are 2.
6671172,Eckohlt,2022-07-07 11:10:00,3685,Maybe both.
6671216,reddemon2,2022-07-07 16:15:00,255,Dave wants to try flying the plane
6671224,Eckohlt,2022-07-07 16:53:00,3685,"Sounds like dave doesn't need a plane to get high,he's got his own recipe."
6671242,Skywagon,2022-07-07 19:48:00,1106,"You guys are putting too much thought in this, Pooch was just wanting advice on the best bullhead bait to use on Lac Seul this time of year."
