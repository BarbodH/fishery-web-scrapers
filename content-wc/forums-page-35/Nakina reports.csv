6673266,"6'3""",2022-07-17 10:24:00,47,I do have a report from the Nakina area. Our group of 12 got back from Stone lake 2 weeks ago. Wow is the best word to describe the fishing. I never would have imagined how hot the action could be. Our 1st ever fly-in trip. Mainly troll and if you didnt have a fish on in a few minutes you had better check your lure for a weed or whatever. Very windy all week so didnt fish as hard as usual but we caught at least 2600 walleye and around 30 pike over 30 inches. Longest was 39 inches. If i had to come up with a negative its that our biggest walleyes were around 22 inches. Saw moose 3 different days
