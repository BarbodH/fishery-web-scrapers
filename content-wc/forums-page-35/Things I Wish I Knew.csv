6672480,gordy28,2022-07-13 17:33:00,437,I am less than one month out from this years fly in trip to Miniss Lake w SFOPlanning is in full swing but other than our major airport being a nightmare right now I am much less stressed than I was for my first tripWith that I put together a list of things I wish I knew before my first trip. Maybe it helps some new folks and I am sure others on this forum with more experience than I can add some new ones https://www.northernjacks.com/post/t...st-fly-in-tripCheersAndrew
6672504,That Minnesota guy,2022-07-13 18:52:00,8293,I have more gear then some bait shops. Everything a person would need to catch fish for a week in Canada can fit in a Plano 3700 tackle box. Use the tackle weight saved on clothes to stay warm & dry and on stuff to combat the bugs & flies.
6672614,Peterpikes,2022-07-14 10:01:00,33,"Good write up. I got a chuckle out of looking for a bear behind every tree on your first trip. It reminded me of my first fly-in 20 years ago. That’s the exact way I felt. My family has been doing fly-ins since the late 80’s and we still continue to find ways to enhance the trip every year. The more you go the more you learn what’s necessity and what is just nice to have, but you can do without. Finding the proper balance is what makes a trip successful. Here would be a few of my suggestions for a first fly-in. *Rain Gear. Having a quality set is 100% necessity. A poncho isn’t going to cut it. Even if it’s not raining you will be thankful on cold mornings or windy days. Stay warm, stay dry and stay fishing. *2 lures that have worked in every Canadian lake I’ve fished is a jig head tipped with a minnow, worm, leech, or plastic for walleye and spoons for pike. Eppinger 5 of diamonds, Williams wobbler, Lucky Strike Half Wave, and Johnson Silver Minnow will all catch pike anywhere. *You're not staying at a 5-Star resort. You’re spending a week off the grid at a fish camp in the bush. Things aren’t always going to be perfect. A water line may spring a leak, a toilet flapper may not be seating properly, a window screen may have holes in it from critters and letting in bugs, a boat might have popped a rivet and has a slow leak, a boat motor may not be running perfect. Expect these things because they happen. Bring a small tool bag. screw drivers, small adjustable, pliers, duct tape, zip ties, a few hose clamps, aluminum epoxy stick, extra boat plug, etc…Hopefully you can go the week without opening that bag, but it may just get you out of a jam. *Don’t blame the outfitter if you don’t catch a 40” pike or a 30” walleye. Your expectations shouldn’t be a fish on every cast. It’s still fishing and many of mother natures factors will determine the fish activity. How late was ice out, are the fish off spawn, cold fronts, heat waves..etc. I’ve fished the same cabin multiple years in a row with very different outcomes. Every year is different. Keep your expectations in check, not everyone catches the same fish you see on the outfitters website or in their flyer. Pete"
6672750,gordy28,2022-07-15 05:09:00,437,Some great adds. Definitely need good rain gear. First trip I had an old yellow slicker set up. Kept me dry but between the sweats and no zippers to relieve one’s self it needed an upgrade!Andrew
