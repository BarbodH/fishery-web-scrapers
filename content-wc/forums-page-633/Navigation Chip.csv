568944,Northpoint,2007-09-13 09:11:00,38,What is the most detailed navigation chip available for Lac Seul? I have a Lowrance LCX 27 and would like to learn some more about the lake during the winter months. Thanks
568947,Guest,2007-09-13 09:45:00,0,The only one I saw on Lac Seul was the Navionics. I purchased it and tried it this year. Its pretty good but in spots the depths are off a good 10 feet and the area where the wennesaga river comes in isn't on the chip at all. I was the Ear Falls end of the lake so I can't comment on the accruacy beyond Steamboat. >What is the most detailed navigation chip available for Lac >Seul? > >I have a Lowrance LCX 27 and would like to learn some more >about the lake during the winter months. > > >Thanks >

It is definitely the best out there and will only get better as more are purchased as Navionics does upgrade the info. Especially if they receive info from users who let them know about errors or omissions. Good Fishin'

(the west end near Ear Falls) It was excellent for identifying Islands and routes to get there. As Chris said, the depths are off in some areas. My skeg tangled with a rock because I was depending too much on the chip but If I had been watching more closely I should have caught it. Lesson learned.....use your head and eyes along with the GPS!"
