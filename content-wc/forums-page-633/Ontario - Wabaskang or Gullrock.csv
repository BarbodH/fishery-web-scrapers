I have read alot on this board about Wabaskang and Gullrock. My group (me, my dad and son) prefer walleye fishing but also like to mix in some northern and/or lake trout as well. We have caught (and released) alot of walleyes on Lac Seul and wonder which of the 2 lakes listed above can provide somewhat similar consistent fishing. Also, can anyone recommend a resort on the lake as well. We have our own boat so we are looking for nice/comfortable accomdations. Would like to hear any feedback on the 2 lakes. Thanks for your input, Steve"
568789,ajbuff,2007-09-06 14:18:00,11,"Steve, Been to both lakes, however it has been quite some time since I've ventured to Gull Rock. Both lakes are excellent walleye fisheries. I got back last weekend from a week on Wabaskang. The walleye fishing was ""down"" but we never had any trouble putting together a limit. Even brought home a 30"" for the wall. Just had to change a few things in our presentation, etc. Wabby has quite a few areas that are excellent for Northerns and we hit a few of those as well. My group brought quite a few small ones to the boat with a few in the 30-35"" range slot fish. I have heard that Lakers are there, don't know anyone who has fished for them. The lake has deep areas (60-80') in spots and I know that people target them. So I guess you have a tough job ahead of you. Lac Seul is a quality fishery, but both Wabby and Gull are as well. The only difference may be that Gull is about and hour further north. Good Luck, and tight lines! Andy"

We also had our own boat. We got free launch, docking, electric for the on board charger and six gal. of fuel per day. Even though the walleys were not huge (we did catch many above the slot) the pike were on the small side, the bass were great and some perch were worth while. This was a great time. I'd go back."

568817,verlund,2007-09-07 14:44:00,32,"Can you recommend a resort on Gullrock? Not looking for anything nothing fancy just comfortable, modern cabins and nice ammenities. Thanks, Steve"
568821,Guest,2007-09-07 18:50:00,0,"All the camps are good on gullrock. they all have good boats and facilities. if you google sunset country you should be able to get inormation on the camps on gullrock. they are Golden Hook Camp, Procyks Anglers Paradise, South Bay on Gullrock, 5 Lakes Lodge, Poplar Point Camp, Wrights Wilderness Camp."
568822,Guest,2007-09-07 19:23:00,0,"We fish Gullrock and love it. This year had wind and and a lot of wind changes which kept switching wind from east or south. Never had much for north or west winds. The inconsistency seemed to slow things down a bit, but still always did good during at least one part of each day. Had one morning after the wind had blown from the same direction for a couple days where we were able to get on them. With three in the boat, we fished out our minnows and caught over 100 walleye in the morning. My dad's best fish for the week was a 28"", our other buddy had a 27"" and I brought up the rear with my best being a 26"". I've never fished for the northern, but you hook into them occasionally. Caught a bunch of little ones the first afternoon/evening. Couldn't keep them off the line. Had a few good ones on during the week, but they all broke off. Some years you seem to get lucky and be able to land the good ones. Just depends where the hook is and if they can cut the line. As stated before, I think all the lodges are good, you just need to check their sites see what you are looking for in a camp. We stay at Five Lakes Lodge and love it. We always get the upgrade boats. The livewell, minnow-well, depthfinder, 40hp motor, pedestal seats and underfloor storage are all well worth the price, especially on years when we fish 3 in the boat."
568828,Guest,2007-09-07 21:38:00,0,"I've fished Gullrock and think is a quality fishery. Large Walleye and Northern are abundant. The fish have a fairly predictive migration pattern you wont have much trouble finding them. I stay at Procyck's they have good facilities. Cabins are in good shape, clean and comfortable. Some things to consider; bunkbeds(old guys on bottom) and nonpotable water. The owners are great people. I can answer specifics if you need more info."
568845,Guest,2007-09-09 08:20:00,0,"Having fished both lakes alot, Gullrock is may choice. You mentioned fishing for Laketrout also, then my choice would be Red Lake Excellent fishing for walleyes northern and the lake trout are big. There are nice camps and private cabins for rent on Red Lake. The best thing about Red Lake is it size you can fish and not have 20 boats around you."
568998,Guest,2007-09-14 21:19:00,0,I can see on a map where some of the resorts are at. Where on Gullrock is Wright's camp? Is it on the south side by Golden Hook?
