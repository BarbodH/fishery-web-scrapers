There are some guides but if you know anything about Walleye jiggin you'll do fine, the place is an absolute zoo so just fish in one of the huge packs that form on the well known Walleye spots. Or pay a guide to park you in one of the packs! Some peoples will troll cranks and get nice fish too. Motel in Selkirk is clean and affordable."
568949,Guest,2007-09-13 10:17:00,0,"There are many, many locations to enjoy incredible success catching trophy 'eyes on the Red. Fishing in any number of concentraded boat packs ( or cluster ###ks) is something I cannot bring myself to do these days, perhaps I'm developing claustrophobia...lol! I try to concentrate on specific depths rather than specific locations. When working lead heads, the average depths I prefer and have the most success over the past thirty year plus years is between 12 to 16 feet. When pulling cranks I focus on depths of 10 to 13 feet. As for guides? For the past twenty years I have run a resort and guide service on the Red. It is my opinion that hiring a guide for walleye is just not necessary...period. As it was earlier mentioned, most ""part-time"" river guides will only end up anchoring you down in the middle of a giant cluster and play bumper boats with everyone and his dog. ""All"" my guests that stay with us at the resort only have to follow a little free and simple advice to enjoy great success while fishing this ""WORLD CLASS"" venue! Best of Luck! Stu McKay"
568956,Guest,2007-09-13 14:22:00,0,Stu Do they catch walleye from your place all the way to the mouth of the lake? I have been to your place for catfish but never for the greenback run.

Absolutely, walleye can be and are had over the entire portion of the Lower Red. By no means was I trying to be sarcastic or anything of that nature, I simply hate fishing in packs, always did, always will. Besides there are truly so many placs to locate fish and enjoy great results. Everyone who has ever fished the fall-run on the Red knows that the ""The Cables, Miricle Mile, Dr. Reids & Sugar Is."" are the most sought after locations. I like many others have enoyed loads of success in these locals over the years. These days I'm always on the hunt for alternatives, I get more enjoyment by doing so. With these cold days and nights that we're currently experiencing the action should continue to heat up!"
568962,Guest,2007-09-13 15:34:00,0,I never picked up on any sarcasm.Always been a straight shooter in my book. I was just wanting to get a better understanding of the greenback run an your info is much appreciated.Thanks Stu!
568965,Guest,2007-09-13 17:12:00,0,"No problem Sean, I'll pass along whatever constructive information I'm capable of sharing and I'm happy to do so. Stu."
568970,Guest,2007-09-13 19:04:00,0,Just a dumb Yank who was headed to Tobin. Does any one have any gps coord. for where you guys are fishing? I can't find Selkirk on the map.
568971,Sean,2007-09-13 19:21:00,160,here is a map.Selkirk is Northeast Of Winnipeg.http://www.winnipegkiosk.ca/maps/index.php
568981,Guest,2007-09-14 10:34:00,0,"Thanks!!!! What size of fish are you guys catching, and is there slot limits up there?"
568985,Guest,2007-09-14 11:12:00,0,"Both the Red and Winnipeg River's are very exceptional places to visit. They both produce large quantities of very large walleye. Most will acknowledge that the Red produces far greater numbers of really huge 'eyes. While the Winnipeg produces its share of trophies it is more recognized for larger number's of 'eyes in the 3 to 6 pound range. Many seasoned veterans of the Red don't get excited about catching fish under 12 pounds, most are seeking that magical ""15"" plus. Either way you can't go wrong by visiting either of these very special places. Stu McKaywww.catsonthered.net"
568855,Guest,2007-09-09 15:57:00,0,"Any early signs or Red River projections? Shiners? Good Flow? Fish in the system? Thanks, JSO"
568858,freespoolin,2007-09-09 18:55:00,472,"Flow is good, shiners plentiful, saugers starting to run. It should be a good year. But it will be difficult to beat last Fall on the Red, the best in decades."
568875,Guest,2007-09-10 21:08:00,0,When did they run last year? We were there the 2nd week in Oct. and general feel was a slow run. Two years ago was magic for us. Did we miss time it or did you just have a honey hole.

568877,freespoolin,2007-09-11 08:43:00,472,We did well from Sept 28 to Oct. 31. 18 masters in a half mile stretch of the river.

568878,Guest,2007-09-11 09:16:00,0,What stretch the miracle mile?
568910,Guest,2007-09-11 09:16:00,0,What stretch the miracle mile?
568940,Guest,2007-09-13 08:20:00,0,"The Red's in tremendous shape, current is perfect, color is perfect and the sauger action has been steady over the past several weeks. There has also been a few greenbacks showing up, one being 33 inches caught the over the weekend. Things should only continue to improve as the water temps continue to cool down. My feeling is that we'll see a good crank bite before September runs its coarse and the jig bite in October should be hot."
568943,Northpoint,2007-09-13 08:58:00,38,I would appreciate some addional very basic information on the Red River. Is the fishing for huge walleyes better in the spring or the fall? Are there some local guides? Where do people stay? Thanks
