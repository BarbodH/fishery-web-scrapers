569073,Guest,2007-09-18 21:46:00,0,"In June (2005) an unfortunate fellow from Chicago lost his newly earned wedding band on the dock at Onaway. Bounced once and in the water it went. The poor fellow along with several other hearty souls in his party decided it would be a good idea to try and recover the lost jewelry by sifting the lake bottom. Bringing up as much as they could with a garbage can cover, shovel and anything else the could find. After diving into the depths time and time again, and sifting through the sand and muck for almost an hour, the poor fellow decided to give up the search and beg forgiveness. Never found it, never saw him again. Don't know whether it was the cold shoulder at home or the hypothermia from the water.....I get the chills just thinking about it. Moral of the story.....if you can get your jewelry off, DO, and leave it at home, nobody in Ontario is impressed by your gold take. That lake claimed a nice watch several years back when it got hooked on my life preserver and decided to take a swim. If you are ever down in South Inlet around the small island halfway down and hear a faint alarm at 9am, it's just my watch, never could figure out how to reset that thing."
