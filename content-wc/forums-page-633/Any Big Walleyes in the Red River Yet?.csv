569111,Guest,2007-09-21 10:43:00,0,"Just another quick update... The action continues to show signs of increased productivity as far as ""Greenbacks"" is concerned. I just spoke with two guys who were pulling cranks on Wednesday, they caught an 8# & 10#, plus s few smaller fish to boot. The average size for sauger is also quite higher than years past. Besides the typical small fish the Red is so notorious for, there has been lots in the 16 & 17 inch range. The weekend weather forecast is calling for ideal conditions, this will encourage many anglers to venture out which in tern should produce plenty of reports ""good or bad""..."

569097,Guest,2007-09-20 07:57:00,0,"The ""fall run"" is becoming more and more interesting as the days slip by. I spoke with an old river rat when he was loading his boat yesterday morning and as it turns out this old gentleman has been doing quite well of late. He had four keeper 'eyes in his possession in the two to three pound range. He also claimed to have caught and released a thirty inch fish on Monday. Over all, things are looking great, the action should continue increase over the days and weeks to come."
