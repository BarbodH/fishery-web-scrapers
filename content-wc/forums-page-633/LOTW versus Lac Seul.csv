Anyhow, it was closed all year this year, but will reopen next year with new owners. (I would guess anyways)"
569055,Guest,2007-09-18 05:48:00,0,"You honestly can't judge LOTW's by one trip to Sioux Narrows. The Narrows is a beautiful, highly developed, high traffic, hard fished area. That's like saying you don't like Florida, because of one trip to Disney World. The Morson area is extremely secluded, and provides excellent fishing and scenery... (depending on the areas you fish) The northern fishing on LOTW is better (bigger and more). The Walleyes dominate in LS. The smallmouth fishing is amazing on LOTW. The Muskies are better on LOTW. The crappies are better on LOTW. This is a walleye board, and if you're strictly a walleye fisherman, I won't pretend to say LOTW can compete. It can't. But, if you like great fishing for a variety of fish... LOTW vs. LS isn't a comparison. Also, let's not compare developed areas to the areas that most fisherman go to on LOTW. Here's a map...http://www.lakeofthewoods.com/Touris...es/low-map.jpg If you go straight North of Morson... that penninsula is called the Aulneau (pronounced AL New). Anyhow, the south side of the Aulneau is where we are... right at the entrance to Obabikon Lake. A totally different world than Sioux Narrows. Your wife wouldn't like it... no malls, no hottubs."
569058,Guest,2007-09-18 07:51:00,0,"Lac Seul is a big body of water and I think that most of the posts talk about the western part of Lac Seul. There are less pike, musky and smallies on that side of the lake. My co-worker has gone to the east side for three years in a row in a houseboat and I am amazed at the musky and pike he pulls out. I will not fish with him for personal reasons so i have not yet gone to that east side. He used to fish LOTW. He went back this year to LOTW just because he won a raffle. Otherwise he likes Lac Seul."
569074,Guest,2007-09-18 22:13:00,0,"i guess if you actually spent more time on LOW and got around the lake , you would actually go more than 5 miles away from sioux narrows,, i have been working at a camp on LOW for a while now,, and would say if you saw too many cabins and such , it was your own fault,,, i know i can go for a very long trip on lake of the woods, and see about 4 or 5 cabins at the most,,, if you did not see this , than you didn't see where the really good fishing is anyways,, so stop complaining and griping , and do your homework,,, get to where the good fishing is,, if you satyed where the cabins are ,, that was too bad for you,,,,,,,,,,, lake of the woods is huge,, and after 16 years , i have not seen that much of it,, but enuff to keep my guests in my guide boat very happy,,,"
569076,Guest,2007-09-19 06:34:00,0,I am not griping or complaining. I do not see others griping or complaining....just telling of their experiences. Dale you are a good ambassador for LOTW....keep up the good work.
569085,Guest,2007-09-19 19:09:00,0,Hi. If they did not allow netting by the tens of tons of fish you would not have to go past yellow girl to catch fish. they are not getting my money anymore.
569117,Guest,2007-09-19 19:24:00,0,"That's true, they do allow netting. However, it has a much smaller affect on fishing than people make it out to have. The true problem is you're fishing in the worst waters on the lake for fishing. Seriously, go to the NW Angle, the open waters downrigging, sabaskong, whitefish, obabikon lake, miles bay... etc... When you go to an area that is geared towards highrises and hottubs, what else would you honestly expect? There's too much traffic to do any real fishing."

568997,Guest,2007-09-14 20:41:00,0,"I have been going to Minaki, about 30 miles north of Kenora, since 1970. The area is pristine but, has some cottages on the lakes, and a couple of smaller drive-to camps on the system. Minaki is located on the Winnipeg River on the northern edge of LOTW. The pike and muskie fishing is better than Lac Seul. Lac Seul definitely blows Minaki away with walleye fishing, but Minaki does have its share of good sizers and numbers. Bass fishing is also better in Minaki.Three years ago I started to spend my 2 week vacation in both places. I'll spend a week in each place, one in Minaki and one week in Lac Seul. Lac Seul is a good 3 hour drive east of Minaki-Kenora. Now my Canadian fishing experience is greatly fulfilled with the mixed bag of fish, and the change of scenery. Even though the scenery is pretty much the same, which is beautiful! Unless your going to fly into some remote area, you're going to find cottages and small drive- to camps anywhere you go. Best wishes on your choice for next year! Also, this doesn't relate to the initial question, and not meant to be mean or insulting, my fourth grader can spell better and uses better grammar than some of the replies I read on this site! RR"
569000,Matches,2007-09-14 21:58:00,236,"RR, I believe your one sentence that reads: Bass fishing is also better in Minaki, is incorrect. Now it is true the fish are in the lake, but your paragraph is about a destination. I believe proper grammer would be: Bass fishing is also better at Minaki. AIN'T DAT WRITE GUYS?"
569003,Guest,2007-09-15 04:41:00,0,">Well i gyess destroyer has a dingy for a boat becuz if u >drive 5 miles u can be in the middle of nowwhere fro kenora.I >think he live sin his car lol.Lotw is the best there is ask >all the americans with big cottages wanted them not lac seul >lol. There is a reason Lacseul is free of large homes. NOT because people don't want them. Only the land that is deeded can be built on and there is very little deeded land. Whats there is there and no more. It will always be pristine and not turned into a lake of the woods. Nothing wrong with lake of the woods if that is what a person wants, lacseul will always be a differant experience. Great fishing on both lakes."
569012,T Mac,2007-09-15 14:51:00,10084,heh heh heh. Nice friendly thread going here. :smokin: LOL!
569015,Guest,2007-09-15 18:02:00,0,"Well, I'll be the first to say my grammer can get pretty poor. However, if someone's going to be critical of grammer, then they'd better have a perfect post. Otherwise, they're going to catch a little flack! LOL That said... LOTW and Lac Seul both have great positive qualities. If a Lac Seul fisherman is going to try a different area, I suggest the Morson/Sabaskong/Obabikon area."
569032,Guest,2007-09-17 08:58:00,0,Is Hidden Island Hide Away camp still in business? Did it change owners?
569038,Guest,2007-09-17 13:11:00,0,"But I am very good at math.Also that means a lot when your buying a new boat or cottage.Lol Didnt know we were in school,are u still in school at the moment lol. Too funny"
569039,rockpt,2007-09-17 13:56:00,589,"LOTW has over 14,000 islands and more shoreline than California. It's roughly 70 miles long and 40 miles wide. There's some development around some of the towns (Kenora, Sioux Narrows, Morson, Baudette, Warroad and NW Angle), but most of LOTW is undeveloped wilderness."
569040,Guest,2007-09-17 14:29:00,0,"Well said rock,u have been on lake of the w lol"
569041,Guest,2007-09-17 15:13:00,0,"I have gone to LS for the last ten years in early to mid-June. One of those years, as a second trip, we did four days on LOTW. The resort on LOTW was one of the huge ones that does a ton of marketing. The only reason we did that trip was because the trip was free (a perk to my wife). The resort was near the town of Sioux Narrows. Based on this one trip, I would not put LOTW in that area even in the same breadth as LS. On LS, we fish a resort that is in the cental part of the lake and we get great pike fishing, huge walleyes with great numbers as well, and very good bass fishing in early-mid June. Based on what I saw on that one trip, I am sure LOTW bass fishing is better than LS and holds that fishing for longer in the year. However, LS has the better walleye fishing and the pike is a toss up. Again this is my opinion based on one trip to LOTW and 10 to LS. We fished all the years with a guide. Of course it did not help that the LOTW guide appeared to be more interested in driving the boat that fishing. Keep in mind the LOTW resort we were at seemed to be designed to more ""weekend fisherman"" more interested in hot tubs, a good bar, etc than putting in hours on the water. The area of Sioux Narrows was very populated with resorts and cabins and it felt like we were in northern Wisconsin rather than an isolated lake in Canada. LS for the reasons mentioned earlier will never be that. Like mentioned earlier, to each their own. My wife found the LOTW experience fine, but I know she would not endure a week at LS because there is no shopping, no hot tub, etc. I am sure there are resorts on LOTW that are far from the crowds and have better fishing. Cheers...IA Walleye"
568964,Guest,2007-09-13 15:53:00,0,"Hey Guys, I know I am in Walleye territory but we have been fishing Lac Seul the last couple of years and as much as we enjoy Walleye fishing we are interested in pursuing Larger Pike and Musky along with Walleye. I was told by a guide on Lac Seul that if you want big Walleye Lac Seul is the place and big Pike/Musky LOTW is the place. Last year the biggest Pike on Lac Seul caught from three boats of hard fishing was 39 inches/ mid lake resort and this year a 40 incher was caught and a few mid 30 fish from a West end resort after a full week of hard fishing. We are thinking about trying LOTW. Can we expect LOTW to be as beautiful as Lac Seul? Not a lot of cabins/houses/resorts etc. Any and all your comments, and resort reccomendations would greatly be appreciated. Thanks"
568973,Guest,2007-09-13 19:57:00,0,"I'll jump in on this... I love Lake of the Woods. The Musky fishing is some of the best in the world. Big Northerns, lots of walleyes, and smallmouth/crappie fishing is great too. Anyhow, I would suggest my resort... Obabikon. If you decide against that, definately go out of the Morson area. Out of Morson, you can fish Obabikon Lake, White Fish Bay (even though you have to go through the pully system), Sabaskong Bay, and Miles Bay... these areas provide great fishing and GREAT SHELTER! The beauty of this part of the lake, is diversity, and shelter from the wind. Check out these resorts too... Pine Island Black Island Miles Bay Camp Grassy Narrows But... Obabikon's the best :)"
568976,Guest,2007-09-14 09:42:00,0,"Hey Pike Fisherman, What Obabikon failed to mention is that LOTW is lined with cabins/resorts. The lake does have great natural beauty but most of it has been tainted by the site of enormous resorts and personal cottages. There is very little solitutde, its busy as ####, and a pile of puke compared to the serenity of Lac Seul. Its too bad because it used to be nice. The resorts all have big screen tv's and hot tubs and other cushy crap that citiot yuppy fisherman like. Not the kind of stuff real fisherman come to Canada for. D"
568977,Guest,2007-09-14 09:49:00,0,whatever I would think a soak in a hottub while watching the twins on a big screen would feel pretty good after fishing in 3 footers all day. good luck boys can't wait for hard water!!!!!!!
568978,Guest,2007-09-14 09:52:00,0,"Have fished them both and I would rather fish Lac Seul. I believe that the fishing is better on lac Seul and for sure there are less fisherman and great scenery. We don't fish pike very often but still manage some nice Pike every year while chasing Walleye and Smallies. Last year we did get 3 Pike over 39"" and 6 of us caught over 1300 Walleye in 5 days with 40% being over 22"" and the big girl was 29""."
568979,Guest,2007-09-14 09:59:00,0,"Yes, you are correct... LOTW has WAY too many cabins and resorts. However, if you launch out of Morson, and head to Obabikon LAKE/Caribou Lake, then there aren't. You HAVE to get away from the mainland to really find any seclusion."
568984,Guest,2007-09-14 11:02:00,0,Well i gyess destroyer has a dingy for a boat becuz if u drive 5 miles u can be in the middle of nowwhere fro kenora.I think he live sin his car lol.Lotw is the best there is ask all the americans with big cottages wanted them not lac seul lol.
568986,Guest,2007-09-14 12:20:00,0,Hi. we up to both lakes for 30 years. I checked out the cabin possibilities too. the realestate agent said the government does not want lac saul to go the lake of the woods went with cabins dotting the shore all the way around. even out by yellow girl the land is for sale for homes. I did not think the fishng on lake of the woods was that good. we always stayed around sioux narrows. lac saul had the best fishing we thought. try it and you will see. make up your own mind.
568987,Guest,2007-09-14 12:34:00,0,The fishing in LOTW's is very different as you move to different areas of the lake. I suggest you try an area away from Souix Narrows.
568989,PJM,2007-09-14 15:37:00,3516,"Destroyer You have to do better then that, the guy was looking for an opinion on both lakes and not a personal attack on the people that fish Lake of the Woods. The Morson area that Obabikon is talking about has some resorts and some cabins, but its not how you described it. The Obabikon lake where his resort is located near is as remote as you can get it, with a entrance about 15 feet wide at best and bout 2 to 3 feet deep to get into lake depending on the water level. There are also a lot of island which can knock the wind down on the lake making it easier to move around and find calmer water to fish. I have fished both and both are beautiful lakes and have had great fishing. Pike Fisherman, the Obabikon lake was some of the best pike fishing on Lake of the Woods and it worth taking a look at........"
