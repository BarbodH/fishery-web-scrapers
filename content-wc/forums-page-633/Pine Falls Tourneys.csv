568831,Guest,2007-09-08 07:47:00,0,"Did fishing ever get heated up late last year? I fished there early in the first weekend of October and we did pretty well..then if I remember right, weather was not great with lots of wind and cold. I usually make the weekend of the 20th ish but did not make it last year. How about Selkirk? See ya all in a couple weeks! Hawgeye"
568835,mrwalleye5,2007-09-08 12:41:00,1922,I was there on Novemeber 13/06. We caught about 10 walleye in the 2-3 lb range but no mamas. Was too windy that day to go out in the bay but I don't think it would have been any better. Indications are that it will be a much better year this year. The plan is to head out on September 15 and try it out. Probably too early but it's a good way to find out. W5
