Bill and Helen, Peter and Christa will bend over backward to ensure that your stay is a pleasant one. He is in the process of remodeling cabins on a rotating basis. He can't do it all at once or the banker will be after him. The boats from the resort are excellent. He has a new dock with power out to the boats for charging batteries. Send them an e-mail at goldpines.com. Don't be surprised if you wind up on a waiting list. The week for the 4 of us was $1370"
568972,Guest,2007-09-13 19:43:00,0,"Just something to keep in mind......guests from the year prior get first dibs on returning. The choice weeks get picked over quickly, that will leave you picking from what remains. If you wait too long you get nothing except very early/late or not the nicest cabins. Contact the places you would like, and get the open weeks and make your move SOONER rather than later. My personal choice is Onaway Lodge, Blair and Kathy are great, the docking facilities are easily the best around, the camp boats are Lund Outfitters w/ 50hp Honda 4 strokes with tilt, trim and electronics. Onaway, Fisherman's Cove, and Scout Bay are all near one another and relatively close to very good spots. But you make the calls and find out what is left at this point, pickin's might be slimmer than you think."

568932,JDP,2007-09-12 18:30:00,1457,"Charlie Blue, I have found that smallmouth are more prevalent as you go eastward on Lac Seul. Walleyes are evrywhere! There are many resorts from the central to the eastern side of the lake. Perhaps it would be best to hear from you regarding what you are lookin for: - what type of accomodations (rustic, modern,etc) - level of service - drive-in or boat-in - private boat or resort boat - American Plan or Housekeeping Plan - rate per person that you find acceptable I believe you will get great opinions once you give us some imformation. Otherwise you can use thesearch feature to gather random facts and opinions about Lac Seul resorts. JDP :cheers:"

Drive in or boat in would both work. We have one boat but would need one resort boat. Housekeeping is our choice and would like to be around the $1000 per man per week range. Would consider a outpost site if avaliable. We just love the fishing and spending the time together. Walleye are our target but love to find some place that Smallies can be caught and an occasional toothy critter is always welcome. Thanks for the info."
568936,JDP,2007-09-13 07:46:00,1457,"Base upon your parameters I would highly recommend Fishermans Cove. A drive to resort, just a mile or so off the main highway to Ear Falls. The OWNERS tend to your dock and bait/tackle needs every morning. Cabins are very nice and clean. They have superb camp boats and motors. Guides are available. Ice is available at the dock for cabin and daily boat use. Their well lit fish cleaning house has 2 large freezers with at least 40 feet of stainless steel counter tops. They have a deck party every Wednesday night during the summer for guests. The location on the lake has excellant proximity to walleye, northern with smallmouth available as well. This resort books up very early for the next year based upon guests returning year after year. Contact them now to check next year for availability.http://fishermanscoveontario.com/ Feel free to send me a PM for further information."
568937,Jigger1,2007-09-13 08:05:00,234,"Charlie - 2008 will be the ninth year my group goes to the same place so I'm highly biased. If LacSeul is your target (which I think is a great one) I would suggest doing what I did 10 years ago when deciding where to stay on LacSeul. Look up the resorts on the lake and send them all the same email or give them a call. Based on the response you get or don't get, make up your mind on all accounts and hopefully the resort of your choice will have a vacancy. I did this and received three responses out of six. The decision was a no brainer and I've not looked back once. Jigger1"
568938,Guest,2007-09-13 08:06:00,0,"JDP, Thanks for the info. I have looked at the website and it looks like an awesome resort. Our group goes on a fishing trip to Oklahoma in two weeks and I plan on having some choices for them at that time. I will try to make reservations shortly after that trip. Do you have any other suggestions? Thanks again for your help so far. Charlie Blue"
568939,JDP,2007-09-13 08:19:00,1457,"Charlie, #1 is Fishermans Covehttp://fishermanscoveontario.com/ #2 would be Onaway Lodge, close prooximity to FC. http://www.onawaylodge.com/ #3 Lac Seul Lodgehttp://www.duenorth.net/lacseullodge/ #4 White Wing Resorthttp://www.whitewingresort.com/index2.html #5 Evergreen Lodge (#5 ONLY because of the location is near Ear Falls. The owners are absolutely awesome!! I like to be closer to the Central Part of Lac Seul).http://www.lacseulwalleye.com/ Again I would contact reorts NOW for next year availability. JDP"
568941,2746,2007-09-13 08:35:00,3206,"We usually fish Gullrock but this fall decided to try Lac Seul. We just got back from Lac Seul Lodge and found it to be very good. I did a lot of research before we booked and found nearly all of the Lodges serving this west side have excellent reputations and lots of repeat business. You've been given a good list! Walleye fishing was excellent this fall with most in the 20-24"" range. We didn't fish for Smallies but I caught two the last day that were both over 17"". a real thrill! You won't regret making the trip. By the way, it's a big lake and having a GPS with a Lac Seul chip was valuable."
568942,Guest,2007-09-13 08:54:00,0,"Jigger,JDP and larrym, Thanks for all the help. I'm going to get busy contacting Resorts this weekend. I now have a list of 12. Should be able to find something at one of them. Thanks Again, Charlie"
