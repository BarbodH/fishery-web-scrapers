But I can troll the entire perimeter of a lake and cross all the reefs with only a hammer handle northern or two to show for it. I troll 8-10' deep with walley divers, thunder stix, shad raps, ect. Any help on what I might be doing wrong?"
568747,prov1900,2007-09-02 20:01:00,544,"Tea colored waters? Must be talking about Lac Seul, or at least Sunset Country? Never had any luck with crankbaits either, then again, I am also a lousy crankbait fisherman. Jigs and rigs baby. There is nothing else out there, IMO. Sorry, this wasn't much help, but I just wanted to make you feel better. Others will chime in and we will both learn."
568748,Jimmy Jig,2007-09-02 20:40:00,1905,"Well for starters the lures must be ""tuned"" or they won't catch much. Most lures out of the box are not much good. And then about 50% of them will never work right no matter what you do with them. They have to run straight in the water at high speeds or they need the nose loop bent so they will. Rapala lures used to be the best of lot, but now that they are farming them out to be built by the cheapest bidder they are not so hot. Musky lures are worse yet to get right and if you get any lure right, guard it with your life."
568777,reconssd,2007-09-05 18:29:00,147,"Trolling is an art form just like a great walleye presentation. One of the problems might be dragging the lures right behind the boat. You want to invest in some ""yellow birds"" that will get your presentation away from the boat. Next you need to consider the length of line out from the yellow bird. I would run a short line (10 feet to 20 feet) and one long line (75 feet to 125 feet). This is a good test to see if they are hitting on a tight fast wobble (short line) or a lazy wobble (long line). Another person mentioned tuning the lures. This is a must. But also what is very important is to make sure you are trolling two lures that are compatible with the speed you are trolling. I have been fishing Lake Michgan for salmon for the last 25 years. This year was the first year I took up dipsey diver rods and ran lures off of dipseys for large pike and walleye. The results were very impressive. Overall, the biggest fish from our trip all came via trolling. And don't be afraid to run big baits. The walleyes we caught were all caught on muskie plugs. Believe it or not, we have even caught large perch (12-16"") on muskie plugs. If I wasn't in the boat, I never would have believed it. Good luck."

568974,Guest,2007-09-13 20:06:00,0,"All of the responses so far provide valuable information. Yes, trolling is an art, and has many variables depending on the CURRENT CONDITIONS, ie. water temp, water color/clarity, depth, water current,type of lake & location etc. There is to many to list here, but spend time at it and you will learn. Just a few tidbits of info: you will need a GOOD Quality sonar & a GPS system like the Lowrance LCX Series, to identify fish and other objects/clutter/baitfish/thermocline, etc in the water. the color sonars are wonderful. When trolling, note the depths the fish are at and troll your lures ABOVE them. Fish almost always will go up to strike a lure (like Jaws) The more lines you have in the water legally, the better. But also run some at shallower depths, and DEEP, near the bottom if possible (30-50 feet)depending on time of year/water temp, etc. If you are by your self, keep changing depths until you consistantly catch fish. Depending on time of year & water temp, you will troll in shallow or deep water, sometimes in open areas with no structure, other times troll over structure, hunps,mudflats, rock piles or troll along a sharp drop off sometimes on the breakline, and sometimes in the deeper water off the breakline. On all of the above, this is where a good color sonar and GPS unit with a good quality navigation chip is so critical. If you do not have a GPS get a good lake map & use your sonar to assist you in working the structure and depths. Also get a good diversification of stickbaits & crankbaits. Some (stickbaits) roll when being pulled and crankbaits wobble (to keep it simple) While I use them all regardless of water temp, they do have a tendency toward which to use in cold vs warm water, as the fish metabolism increase or decreases. Oh yea, sometimes lure color matters to. I have been pleasantly suprised many times catching fish on the non predominant type lure because I experimented. Also put S-turns in your prensentation as this speeds up and slows down lures depending on which side of the boat they are. Try differnt trolling speed from slow to burn'em in the water. And do not forget PLANER BOARDS to get the lures away from the boat. You will also have to decide if you are going to use lead core line (this will also change the type of lures you will predominately use, or use mono or a no stretch type line. I have most of my trolling rods rigged w/mono and w/no-stretch as I believe it give me more flexibilty. However, I also have a couple with 3 & 4 color lead core line. Then there are jet divers & dipsy divers to pull spoons & crawler harness rigs......I fish Mille Lacs and other lakes in MN and have fished LOTW & Lac Suel (my favorite lake)since the late 1960's While I do alot of jigging & rigging, I started trolling Mille Lacs opening weekend and still am this year, and caught both walleye and northerns. I just got back this week from my 2nd trip to Lac Suel this year, and did very well trolling. Sometimes I caught them deep in deep water, and other times I caught them shallow 8-10 feet lure depth while trolling in water 35-55 feet deep. Caught a nice walleye in 40 ft of water on f18 Rapala (runs 8-10 ft deep)perch color, and the just a few minutes later, a 41 inch gator on the same lure in 52 ft of water following a breakline. The next day, the same lure for a 38"" northern in 55 ft of water following a breakline that dropped off from 35 ft. There is so much to learn in this art, I suggest you start out by purchasing some good quality books devoted primarily to trolling. I have several that I purchased to speed up the learning curve & still continue to by books & magazines to improve my knowledge. You will also neeed to purchase ""the"" Trolling book as this provides valuable info on the depth lures run at different length of line out and weight & type of line being used. This will also help you to decide what equipement to buy, especially if you are on a budget. Also monitoring fishing sites like this one will help improve your skill. I hope my little bit of knowledge from my experience helps so we can all enjoy our time fishing. But with this knowledge comes the the responsibility of practicing proper fish management, handling and releasing them unharmed back to the water. You will generally catch bigger fish when trolling, so take good care of them for the future of our wonderful sport. Bullett700"
568975,FuzzyIL,2007-09-14 08:33:00,906,"Lots of great info in Bullett's post - good stuff. Juls makes good point of watching your depth too, but 8-10 is a good overall starting point. You ain't gonna catch them if they ain't there. We catch boat loads of Canadian shield walleye's on jigs AND crankbaits. If you are jigging a series of humps and structure - back off and troll shadraps through and around the humps for suspended fish - try to 'tick' the top or side of the humps to trigger bites. Smithwich Rogues work great exploriing rocky wind blown showlines for walleye and pike. Follow the contours and look for drops. Watch you locator very closely. If you hit a rock snag, let out slack and throw the motor in reverse and back up passed the hung up lure and pull back in the opposite direction. The lure should pop right out. It will take a few successes to start gaining confidence. Once you get the confidence you will use cranks to find new pods of fish and then 'pour the lead down on 'em!' Years ago I was invited to a fly-in with some college buddies and their dads. When we got there I opened my gear box and they saw my crankbaits and began to laugh at me. ""There are no bass up here you moron Ha Ha"". I found them jigging a weedline humps off a sand point the first morning and my partner and I began to troll cranks up and down the sand point and weedline. Our fish were coming 2 to 1 against two boats and our fish were chunkier. By the second day, they I was renting them cranks for 4 beers a day. They brought cranks every year since."
568980,Guest,2007-09-14 10:18:00,0,"Thanks for the compliment FuzzyIL. I love your last paragraph, yes I also questioned trolling deeper water until I went out with a fried a few years ago. Now it's my turn to get questioned or laughed at when I want to troll, until they see the results. Just happened to me at Lac Suel last week....the 2 older guys in my boat were non-believers, now they believe!! :rockit: Bullett700 :cheers:"
568983,Dacotah Eye,2007-09-14 10:59:00,2722,I fish carnkbaits quite a bit and I think the biggest factor is to find the fish on the sonar and then fish a crankbait that will run at the correct depth. You also have to find the right color and action that they like at the time. I had a tournavent partner tell me during a tournament that I didn't know how to troll crankbaits because I don't do it the same way that he does. We took first in the tournament and also got the money for the largest Walleye and he didn't put one fish in the boat. He changed his mind about the way I do it and I had a good net man for the day.
