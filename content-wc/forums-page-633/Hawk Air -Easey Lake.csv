We have been to several other Hawk Air outposts and have always had a positive experience. Cabins are nice, equipment is usually in good order. And most importantly fish aren't hard to find. This past summer our group went to Duffy Lake. The fishing was average. We would catch 30 -50 eyes per day and the quality was good with plenty of fish from 17"" to 22"" and a few larger but no hogs. Also very few northerns. We don't know alot going in here, other than the lake holds good numbers of walleye, pike and perch. Also there are two portage lakes with boats for more walleye and pike. Will are scheduled for the last week in July. Any information you might have would be appreciated."
