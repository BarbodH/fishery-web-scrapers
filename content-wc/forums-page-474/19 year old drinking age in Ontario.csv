1332287,tv4fish,2011-07-21 08:07:00,2694,"Yeah --- the Duty free (going INTO Canada) usually has a ""special"" on Crown Royal - good price !"
1332553,Bluff,2011-07-21 17:01:00,152,Yea - I have always been surprised by the liquor prices in Ontario versus the US - pretty good if not cheaper. Unfortunately not the same for beer - not even close.
1332581,jignminow,2011-07-21 18:11:00,168,"yeah well the special, which is usually $35 for two 1.1l bottles is great except my one bottle will last 2 days if I am lucky. I always end up buying the giant 3L bottle from the LCBO in Nestor falls which is another $100 plus. I seriously drink to much....off to bed. We leave the driveway in t-minus 5 hours....yeah, like I can sleep.............."
1331693,Hammerhead Herb,2011-07-19 16:51:00,259,Crossing the border this Thursday. Can a 19 year old bring a bottle of whiskey across the border. I know that the legal age for beer is 19 in Ontario.
1331707,drew59,2011-07-19 17:29:00,87,"Yes, either."
1331722,3M TA3,2011-07-19 18:04:00,2846,How does the 19 year old get it to the boarder?
1331724,Hammerhead Herb,2011-07-19 18:06:00,259,With hhis father and 2 uncles in the car with him. picking it up at DFA store
1331811,jignminow,2011-07-20 05:21:00,168,you might want to call the duty free in Ft. Francis.....this doesn't sound right to me. He would still be making a purchase in the U.S. and would have to be 21......not sure.....better call.
1331843,ftfarms,2011-07-20 06:50:00,444,why dont u just buy it after u get into canada? most whiskeys are not much higher up there than in the states and some are cheaper.
1331853,Aaron-IN,2011-07-20 07:20:00,500,"It doesn't matter who buys the alcohol, anyone over 21 can buy it. If he is 19 (legal drinking age in Ontario) he can claim it when crossing into Canada."
1331861,Mohleye,2011-07-20 07:32:00,368,The people in the car that are over 21 can have 10 bottles apiece if they want to...until they cross the border. There is no problem with the 19yo bringing his allotment into Canada. Although when I brought my 19yo nephew a few years ago he got a kick out of going into the LCBO in Emo and making his own purchase.
1331890,lacseul810,2011-07-20 08:33:00,22,"Yes it is legal for him to bring in alcohol if he is 19. You are going into Canada which the drinking age is 19 totally legal we have been doing it for years and this year we have 9 legal drinkers in canada and only 5 in the states. Beer down here is about half of what it is in Canada, Buy your beer in the states and the liquor in Canada especially Crown. Hope this helps, enjoy your trip!"
1331906,jambi,2011-07-20 08:50:00,504,"Have a great trip Hammerhead Herb, please report when you get back!"
