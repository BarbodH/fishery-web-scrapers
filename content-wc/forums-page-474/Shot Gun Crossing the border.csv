1329683,Knutson21,2011-07-14 07:03:00,348,We are heading up to a remote cabin north of Vermilion Bay in the middle of August that is somehow associated with my Grandma's Cousin. Private cabin not with a Lodge. There have been reports from a couple of groups that have gone up already this year that they have had some bear problems at the cabin. I tried reading the rules on bringing up a shotgun on the customes web page. It says that you can get a permit for $25 dollars but specifically says that firearm must be used for hunting purposes or competition purposes. We are only looking to use it for protection as the last resort but mainly for the noise if the bears do come around. We are not going to be bear hunting and not registered in a competition. Are we aloud to get the $25 permit and bring the shotgun with us.

There is a process for owners of ""remote cabins"" (what that means is not very clear) to keep a long gun at the cabin but I do not believe that this would work for your situation. Canada takes weapons violations at least as serious as OWIs, so I would not chance it."

1331151,Guest,2011-07-18 13:15:00,0,Why not call the Customs Office where you plan to cross and talk to an agent and ask them what the procedure is for bring a weapon across?
1331234,hogridnfool,2011-07-18 16:05:00,349,". As Outfitter 17 said, not a problem. http://www.canadawelcomesyou.net/firearms.html"
1331474,LOW1,2011-07-19 07:51:00,2828,"It is the "". . .must be for hunting or competition use. . ."" requirement which could cause you problems. Canada's attitude towards guns for self-defense is much different than the United States'. Above all, if you decide to take the shotgun, make sure that you declare it."
1331492,Mike Kansas,2011-07-19 08:31:00,1463,"My bet is that they would frown on shooting a Bear unless he attacked you. We had Bear trouble once in a outpost in Manitoba. One of the guys had a hand held air horn...couple blasts with that and Mr. Bear left us alone. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
