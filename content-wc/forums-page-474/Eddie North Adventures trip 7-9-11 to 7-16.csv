We arrived and the water level was 3 feet lower than 2 weeks before we got there, very worried that the heat and water level would sink our trip. However, the group of 4 from Toronto that were in the other cabin and my party of 2 caught and relessed 21 pike 40 +. 2 biggest were 45's, my biggest 44"" (see pic), may be heaver than the 2 47's I caught in past trips elsewere? We found at least 3 spots were we could catch pike 2-4 ft of water with cabbage, sunny or cloudy days. Found 3 spoots we could catch all the walleye we wnated ranging from 16 to 27""'s. We could not reach more than 50% of the water that we had planned on fishing. Eddie and his camp manager James were extremely accomodating!!!! Going back next year!!!!!!!!!! I could only get one opicture to attache, none of the othe 8 will show up, sorry."
