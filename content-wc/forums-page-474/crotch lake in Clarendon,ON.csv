We did so poorly on walleyes, we finally gave up and trolled for lakers (had the downriggers with us). Great lake trout fishing! If you find out or figure out what works, let us know. I love the area and would try it again. Good Fishing, Sluggo (p.s...I figured I can sneak onto this board, my Mother was from Saskatoon)"
507427,Guest,2000-04-04 13:38:00,0,I was only there once. All we could catch them on was a white Big O.

Get as far away from the lodge and watercraft traffic as is possible. The lake is 9 miles long, and is surrounded by mostly Crown Land, so you'll find plenty of spots.I had very good luck there for walleye three years ago in mid June. The key was finding shady slack water first, usually the leeward side of a rocky point, and then lowering a temperature probe until we found the depth at which the water was about 68 degrees. At that time of the year, we were looking at about 15 feet. Gold or orange #3 Indiana blade spinner rig worm harnesses drifted or backtrolled on a plain bottom bouncer or snap weight worked like a charm. I don't know how much colour really matters with spinners, but the walleye forage on perch in that lake, so maybe that's why. When we located suspended schools further out into the main lake, they were deeper, typically in the 25 foot level, and again, we used worm harnesses with snap weights, trolled at no more than 1.5 mph....Want a friendly suggestion? Bring an ultralight spinning rig, 2 lb. test, tiny slip bobbers, and some weighted #8 attractor hooks, and when midday rolls around, have yourself an absolute ball and go after perch. The lake's loaded with them, and to my way of thinking, nothing tastes better. Look for sparsely weeded sand bottom in about 12 to 15 feet of water, and have fun!!!!If you decide to fish deep with cranks, consider a leader. There's plenty of toothy critters in Crotch Lake as well, especially over weed flats in 20 to 30 feet of water, and with the price of cranks these days, it can be a painful and expensive lesson in learning just how MANY pike swim in Canadian waters!Have a great time, and good luck."
