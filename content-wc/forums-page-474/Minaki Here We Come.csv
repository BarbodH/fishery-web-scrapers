1331422,Bigiver,2011-07-19 05:43:00,94,"Walleye Central should be well represented in Minaki this weekend. I am heading up with a group of ten and will be there Saturday as well. Jignminow will be up there and I think from reading IndyPikeSlinger as well. It sound like KSauers will just be finished up and on his way back. Looks like the weather will be perfect for most of the week just hope the fire (fire #Kenora39) on the North end of Big Sand yesterday (7/18) does not cause any major problems for any of us up there. The MNR's website say they they have it under control. Hoping tight lines for us all, BigIver"
1331430,jignminow,2011-07-19 06:09:00,168,"I spoke to the owner of our camp last night and he mentioned that the water level is about 3"" below what they consider to be normal.....Walleye fishing has been great for big fish but finding slot eaters has been more of a challenge. He said that the fires that have been popping up seem to be struck quickly. There is a bit of rain in the forecast....lets hope so and then be gone on Friday...I do hope for some cloud cover and it looks like the heat will be over by next week as well.....2 more days!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1331436,Aaron-IN,2011-07-19 06:27:00,500,"The water levels are pretty much what I remember ""normal"" being years ago but they are certainly lower than they have been this time the past several years.The crank bite is on!!!!!!!Good luck everyone, post results when you get back."
1332325,tikka_t3,2011-07-21 09:34:00,14,Will be there Friday to Monday looks like the weather is cooling down a bit for us. I have heard that fishing has been good with lots of larger fish being caught.
