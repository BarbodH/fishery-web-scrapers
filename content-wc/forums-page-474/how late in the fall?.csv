1332942,Outfitter17,2011-07-22 20:25:00,127,I would guess most are going to be open at least until the 3rd week of september. We are open for fishing this year until Oct. 4 and hunting until Nov. 16.
1332945,hogridnfool,2011-07-22 20:31:00,349,I've gone up to Mameigwess Lake (by Ignace) the last week in September to fish for Lake Trout while they are up in the shallows; and after trout season closes (Sept. 30) I take Ripple Creek over to Indian Lake to fish for Walleye. Late Fall is my favorite time to fish in Canada.
1332947,jambi,2011-07-22 20:40:00,504,Headed to a flyout 90miles NW of Ear Falls last week of August. Will this be a transitional summer/fall timeframe? Figure to do alot of trolling to find some walleye. What areas should we concentrate? This lake chain consists of 6 lakes about two miles long each. May try lake points with jigging and see how that goes... Any thoughts on pike moving shallow then or think they will still be deep? Thanks!
1332959,Hawkfan,2011-07-22 21:46:00,237,"Our group has done a fly in through Slate Falls/Red Pine in Sioux Lookout sometime in the last week of August to first week or two of September every year. This year we are going to Onaway Lodge on Lac Seul the last week of September. We didn't book our trip this year until May or June, but had a number of places with openings. One of the perks of going late in the year I guess."
1332983,Golden Eagle,2011-07-23 05:54:00,2642,I've made many trips the first week of October to NW Ontario. Latest ever was the week after non-resident moose season. Was probably around October 12. Good trip. Pinned down by a pretty big snow for a couple of days. Walleyes and/or moose for dinner. Every night.
1332987,DavKin,2011-07-23 06:11:00,104,We fish that time of year 100 miles north of Red Lake. We prefer vertical jogging or lindy rigging and usually find them in 20 to 30 FOW.
1332997,AllenW,2011-07-23 07:03:00,11482,"We've gone to Red as late as the first week in Oct, after years of trying different fall dates we come up with the second or third week in Sept works best over all.Remember to bring your parka, anytime in Sept you can get snow or ice.Al"
