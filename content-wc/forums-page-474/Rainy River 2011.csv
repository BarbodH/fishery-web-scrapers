The water temp fluctuates quite abit as well, right now it's between 62-68 degrees.Walleye in my area are holding in the current seams, in rock/sand transitions, and mud to rock or sand transitions. Pockets of active walleye are holding about 14-20ft deep in some spots, but very shallow around the sand bars, 2-6ft. I'm surprised it's this late, but there are still walleye, and big ones too. Usually this time of year they have migrated back towards LOTW or Rainy Lake, so maybe the higher water early in the season is what has kept them here. Go to lures have been 3/8oz jigs, black, chartruesse, green and pink. Chartruesse grubs, YUM salted black/silver have also produced awesome. Live bait, crawlers and leeches are also getting hit hard. Some areas cranks are producing great. Rapala X-raps off the sand bars, a little deeper and the Rapala DT 10's in various patterns work well. Gulp Alive minnows 3"" in all colors are working to, as well as floating crawlers. Berkley Ripple shad 3-4"" minnow pattern and firetiger patter on jigs are also getting hit hard.The bass bite 3-4 weeks ago was awesome, hiting them with cranks and everything else in shallow. The bite died off, but is now heating up once again. Heavy current areas with rocks is the key right now, but you can also find them mixed with the walleye on shallow sand bars.The pike have been amazing!!!! All my biggest Rainy River pike have come in the last month, including 3 fish over 40"". My previous best here was mid 30's. The pike can be found on the current edges where deep meets shallow. Lots of new weed growth near heavy current areas are worth exploring with spinner baits, swim jigs, swim baits as well. Shallow bays also pay off for some pike action.Hope this helps anyone planning a rainy trip this year!!!Tight lines"

1323443,ManitouBass,2011-06-27 21:25:00,201,"Hit me up anyhow, we can get some fishing in, and maybe a few drinks and some good food, lol.I'm only a short drive from Sha Sha's.And as per your post, no, I dont agree. Rainy is a complicated beast, I would only trust those who fish there almost on a daily basis for good information., lol."
1325282,ManitouBass,2011-07-02 15:28:00,201,"A quick update...About 4-5 days ago, the water almost doubled in volume, kickin up alot of sediment etc. Water is very muddy, and around a 12ft average, at 65-68 degrees.When the water level drastically changes, the bite dies hard for 2-3 days. I'd avoid coming here until the water lowers a bit and stabalizes."
1325416,Limeyangler,2011-07-03 01:49:00,563,I have heard not to trust people from that area....their information sucks
1325517,ManitouBass,2011-07-03 10:52:00,201,"Truth, just hit it up blind and figure it out"
1331027,ManitouBass,2011-07-18 09:23:00,201,"A quick update... Walleye can still be found, very tough though. This time of year I wouldn'y make a trip to Rainy river to fish walleye, lol. The bass bite is on big time now. Can't really do any wrong fishing the rapids. Water temp are around 75-78 degrees, water levels dropped to an average of about 6ft, which is normal this time of year. Big pike can be found in the early morning and evenings, searching the hallow weed growth. Had a blast the last few nights throwing scum frogs for big pike. No trophies yet, but lots of pike in the 35-40"" range. And they'll blast outta the water right now which is always a great time!!!"
