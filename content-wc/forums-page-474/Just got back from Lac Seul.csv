Broad Lake and Sunlight were slower than normal. Leeches worked best for us with nightcrawlers a close second. Never really used minnows. We caught our eaters every morning. Everybody in the group caught at least one over 26"". Good weather. One day of rain and chill. Saw alot of bears this year. Some were dead on 17, be carefull. Wished I was still there. Greg."

1331131,greg2648,2011-07-18 12:34:00,80,"We caught eaters at 10-13ft. Biggers eyes at 15-20ft. Mostly trolled spinners. I trolled a 3/8 oz chain sinker with 32"" leader with gold blade and red beads. Gold was best but red/white and chartruce were also good. Red jigs with leech also good. Surface water temps were 72. All different winds. Greg."
