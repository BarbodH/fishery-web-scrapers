1332061,JinxCanada,2011-07-20 14:07:00,1306,"LOW is not exactly ""southern"" Ontario"
1332131,Leeches,2011-07-20 16:24:00,106,Lets call it southwestern then if your splitting hairs.
1332161,adempsey,2011-07-20 18:13:00,963,That's actually northwestern Ontario :PSouthern Ontario is south of Quebec.
1332274,tyson2925,2011-07-21 07:37:00,95,"What part of LOW? Northern end, Lakes huge! I had some friends go up in June and had a great trip, lots of 21-24"" walleye but no 30"". Not that I wouldnt be happy with that size of fish."
1332810,JinxCanada,2011-07-22 12:13:00,1306,"The Western and especially CENTRAL basin of Lake Erie (Wheatley/Leamington/Colchester) spit up 27"" as the standard size, and easily you'll see MANY 31"" + walleye on a daily basis. Just Sayin'"
1332820,MrWalleye73,2011-07-22 12:45:00,821,"That whole Rainy River system has some nice 'eyes in it. We fish the Eastern end, Seine Bay, and every year I've caught something over 27"". Biggest was 31"" three years ago. Lots in the mid 20's range too. My favorite spot is still Green Bay region.....wow! I know, it's not Canada."
1333297,dogrodder,2011-07-24 09:11:00,400,Great fishing for what ever you want to catch. The Dryden area is tough to beat for drive in camps. My favorite is Bonny Bay. It's a first class housekeeping camp and a 10 minute drive from all the comforts of home.
1333599,ziemann,2011-07-25 09:03:00,641,"A couple of hours north if I'tl Falls is northern Ontario.... Keep in mind that Ontario stretches from Hudson Bay to New York. Southern Ontario would be Windsor, Ottawa, and Toronto. So Lake Erie would be considered southern Ontario as previously referenced. If I was traveling north of MN to fish, I would agree that Lake of the Woods would be a good choice. My summer home is east of Atikokan, ON- there are tons of good lakes all across that region within a couple of hours of International Falls to catch great walleye. The easiest to get to will be Lake of the Woods."
1331212,tyson2925,2011-07-18 15:11:00,95,Just looking for ideas for drive too spots in Ontario with the best big walleye upside? We normally go early june but would consider a september trip (hoping to take a spring and fall trip if possible)
1331409,adempsey,2011-07-19 01:22:00,963,I'd say the biggest walleye in Southern Ontario are definitely caught in the Bay of Quinte.
1331423,NARDA 1,2011-07-19 05:44:00,636,I've seen 13 -15 lb walleye come out of Eagle and regularly catch 23 inch + fish.
1331512,tyson2925,2011-07-19 09:08:00,95,Can you catch big fish during the summer there? I would probably just take a guided trip if I was going to get out on that big water. thanks.
1331610,JinxCanada,2011-07-19 13:12:00,1306,Lake Erie in Colchester or Wheatley yeild 10-13lbs often
1331699,3M TA3,2011-07-19 17:04:00,2846,"Ontario is pretty darn big, north to south. What do you consider southern Ontario?"
1331706,adempsey,2011-07-19 17:24:00,963,"It's more popular in the spring and fall during migration when the bigger fish start to move in/out of the bay, but I am pretty sure you can catch fish there throughout the season. Just nothing like what you see in the fall."
1331943,tyson2925,2011-07-20 10:06:00,95,"A couple hrs north of international falls, mn"
1331947,jswinter40,2011-07-20 10:09:00,127,"best shot, LOW.lots of options though. if there is a small lake with a lot of 30"" fish then don't expect it to be posted on the internet."
1331967,camp chef,2011-07-20 10:55:00,915,LOL........Loose lips sink ships
