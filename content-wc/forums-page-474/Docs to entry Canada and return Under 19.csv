1332611,labsrus,2011-07-21 19:57:00,557,"Question on the definition of a youth group We are going on our annual family fishing trip. Everyone has a passport expect for my sons girlfriend, who might be going along. She is 17. In reading the sticky it states that youth groups under the age of 19 as long as they are part of the religious, school or youth group can use a birth certificate to get back in. Any experience with this from anyone? Thanks"

You may need something like a permission slip signed by her parents. It would be best to find out directly from them rather than having any surprises.

1332710,Fishin Fun,2011-07-22 08:08:00,218,I just went through the border with my 11 year old son and 16 year old nephew last week and they asked for a permission slip from the parents along with the passport. I told them that I had my son and nephew with and I did not have any slip. They asked the boys a lot of questions about who they live with and does their other parents know where they are and such. They let us through but said that next time we need to bring some sort of permission slip to show them. At least until they are 18 years of age.
