1332903,Babamel2,2011-07-22 17:14:00,414,I plan to go to Allanwater Bridge Lodge in late August. We will be arriving there by train and was wondering if any of you have been there and if so what kind of tackle would you take if you were going again. And any info about where to fish and how you would fish those areas.thanks

All I can suggest is the usual: Assuming you are using a camp boat and outboard motor for trolling. Look a a map that shows contours and use it in conjunction with a fish finder. (Of course if you have sophisticated electronics with an electronic map, be sure it is compatible with what you have to work with. Of course check with the resort operator now and shortly before you arrive for tackle and bait suggestions. If bringing night crawlers, make arrangements for keeping them cool; minnows and leeches oxygenated.Bottom bounce humps points and fish weed lines and current breaks or jig those areas. Spoons and spinners and crankbaits to cover area. I like the small Hot 'n tot, it will catch northern, walleye and smallmouth. (not sure what this system has to offer)Years ago I fished at Sonny-Bob Lodge on the Algoma-Central Railway. We could bring a lot of stuff, including a 6 hp Johnson outboard.Good trip in and out. Recall catching Walleye at noon on a bright cloudless day, casting artificial lures from an island.Best of luck.Gary"
