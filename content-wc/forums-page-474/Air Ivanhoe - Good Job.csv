While on the trip, on Tuesday one of party had a heart attack. We got him back to the cabin and used the Sat Phone to call the main lodge and reported the medical emergency that we had. They flew in to take him out and one of our guys went along. The crew at Air Ivanhoe had our vehicles pulled out and ready to go follow the ambulance to the hosipital in Timmins. They had maps to the hosipital printed out for him. This was a great idea and saved a lot of time. In the end our friend needed to have a stint put in and is still in the Hospital today, he gets out on Friday. The crew at Air Ivanhoe was professional and did a great job to help us with this emergency. Many thanks go out to the people who helped us. Our next trip will be planned to go with them again. Thanks Jay Forster"

I had an older friend die while on a fly-in trip. He died of a heart attack also I might add. Ya , I like the idea of remoteness and away from computer and phones but all it takes is one time . By you having the phone your friend may live another day to fly-in . I even take it now along on my fly-in canoe trips . My wife and I canoe alone most of the time and like I told her ,I would hate for something to ""happen"" to one of us and the other sitting there ALONE on the shore ."
1332582,515,2011-07-21 18:11:00,254,Good on them for helping your crew out. Sat phone has always been on my mind while being up there and something to look into for the future.
1332681,vteye,2011-07-22 06:42:00,812,I do drop off unguided float trips in AK with friends and really like having a Sat phone. Last trip my 14 & 16 yr old sons called home to speak with mom mid week just to let her know they were ok.
