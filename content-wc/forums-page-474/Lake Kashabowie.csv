1246828,Jarbear,2010-11-04 11:46:00,24,Any fellow walleye slayers fish Lake Kashabowie west of Thunder Bay? Our group has fished out on Armstrong (Caribou Lake) for many years and have done well. We like to go in September. We might be looking for something new. Any info on the Lake or Lodges on Lake Kashabowie would be appreciated.
