1332462,MrWalleye73,2011-07-21 13:30:00,821,"Yeah, the Great Bear (gas station) on hwy 11 east of Fort Frances sells them. I always buy a few of the ""name"" brands and they are a good smoke. My dad is a cigar nut, asked the guy to see the boxes, and said they were legit. Right on with Canadian beer and a Cuban after a meal!"
1332482,Stu,2011-07-21 14:14:00,472,"Greg, If you've smoked an Opus X you will probably be disappointed w/ most Cubans, unless you can find some Cohiba's. I used to buy them from the Village Corner in Vermilion Bay. Rainy Lake Sports may have them. I think I saw a shop in Dryden that carried cigars, but I've never stopped there. A little research will probably pay off."
1332489,greg2648,2011-07-21 14:29:00,80,Stu- I think you are right. I have heard that there are many other brands that compete and exceed the quality of some Cubans cigars. Then you run across that one guy that says its the best smoke out there. My problem is that I never really smoked cigars until this last year. I have been going to Canada for over 30 years now and never thought about getting some. When we go through Dryden and Vermillion Bay its usually early in the morning. I will have to wait until next year. Greg.

Buy a smoke or two you normally wouldn't and enjoy!"
1332562,outdoorsron,2011-07-21 17:16:00,843,Hello: A few years back my brother bought some cubans when we came up to Canada. He gave me one and it tasted like pissed on sawdust rolled in dog doo doo. I'll stick with my Swisher Sweets Perfectos. Good Luck O R
1332569,Guest,2011-07-21 17:36:00,0,"Really, how do u know that?"
1332659,4Paulie7,2011-07-22 03:48:00,30,"Just because they are Cubans doesn't mean that they can't be stinkweed. IMHO. If you do buy one or two make sure that they have been stored properly in a humidor. Stick with a brand name and go for one at least 6"" and with a 50 - 54 guage ring. In reality, the Dominican, Mexican and Nicaraguan weed has been cultivated and rolled by Cuban expatriots who know their craft and have been producing sticks that equal or surpass the Cubans. Additionally, if I can get political here, you won't be supporting Senor Castro's government."
1332699,fishead,2011-07-22 07:27:00,41,"4pauly7 hit it on the head , I've been a cigar smoker for over 20yrs, most cuban cigar makers have growing and rollers in the dominacan republic and other caribean countrys. That are on par with or past cubans. Even the ones with the same bands."
1332713,wallydave,2011-07-22 08:15:00,2151,"There have been many threads about what makes Canada fishing trips so special. In many cases, it goes far beyond just the fishing.... It is getting away from the normal grind.. making memories around the camp, in the boats and around the campfires. Sure, you could fish in the States, catch and eat fish followed by an American beer and a non-cuban cigar, but part of the whole experiance of travel, not just fishing trips, is to experiance life in a different way. For us who fish Canada, part of the fabric of our trips is the natural surroundings, the peace and quiet, the bear, eagles, moose and the call of the loon! Followed by those tasty walleye fillets, Canadian beer, and perhaps even a Cuban cigar! Enjoy, your experiance, fish hard and return safe... and start planning the next trip!"
1332352,greg2648,2011-07-21 10:12:00,80,"On our way to Ear Falls this year I almost pulled the ""trigger"" and bought some Cubans to smoke while fishing. I saw Dutchies and Smitties (Ear Falls) sells them. Has anyone on here bought them up there. Being a novice, what would be the chances that they were real Cubans? Greg."
1332361,IaDave,2011-07-21 10:22:00,476,I have bought them in the past and they are not any better than a good Domicinan that you can buy here. Just my opinion.

1332377,deputy dog,2011-07-21 10:48:00,305,they are not cubans but i highly recommend a padrone or romeo y julietta vintage....good stuff
1332379,wallydave,2011-07-21 10:51:00,2151,"I remember the days when Coors was unavailable east of Colorado. Not being able to get it some how made it taste better when you were able to ""sneak"" some across statelines. The cuban cigars in Canada are about the same kind of thing. When the exchange rate was in our favor, I would by cubans, just becase I could and the prices weren't as bad then. Now, I might have one just because, I can, but mostly I bring a few Dominican cigars along, they are just as good, and much cheaper! I say do what ever it takes to keep the mosquito's away!"
1332384,greg2648,2011-07-21 10:54:00,80,"Since I have never smoked a Cuban, its just an itch that I have to scratch. I have paid over $30 for a cigar before (OpusX). I dont mind paying a little more if I knew it was real. Greg."
1332388,wallydave,2011-07-21 11:03:00,2151,"Might as well buy a name brand or two cuban cigars a try. Go with a name brand, if you can look at the box they come in, check the back of the box, if it looks like the seal was burned in, they should be ok. For me part of the trip is the Canadian beer and a Cuban cigar, a good way to finish a fresh walleye meal!"
1332402,tv4fish,2011-07-21 11:21:00,2694,"This is where I get our cigars for Canada - they have some very good ""samplers"" http://www.holts.com/home.html"
1332406,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-21 11:25:00,1460,"I get my cuban at the Can Op(Rainy Lake Sports) normally. They are pricy but sometimes you can get a break. 2 years ago I bought about 30 various cigars but the kid behind register only charged me for about 20.This June they were out and said the shipment got lost. I asked where else I could get them. They sent me to some gas stop right past NWO on Hwy 11 east. A mile or two over the causeway. They also had good ones.Walleye Dave has it right. A good cuban cigar in the north country is awesome.I smoke em in the boat as well. This year I used ""The Wonder Bar"" as seen in Cabelas, to wash my hands with to keep the stink off my lures and bait.I like the little ones to smoke when crossing the lake. We will smoke the bigger ones at the card table.Have a great trip Greg. Anxious to hear how it went.Slayer"
1332448,JayM5209,2011-07-21 12:55:00,1050,"greg, buy a couple and enjoy 'em. Just be sure you smoke them all in Canada and don't have a left over one in your vehicle when coming back across the border!P.S. I've smoked a bunch of cigars over the years. On a few special occasions (or when they've been given to me) I've had one of those pricey ones. Just my opinion but I've never smoked a cigar costing more than two bucks that was worth the price."
