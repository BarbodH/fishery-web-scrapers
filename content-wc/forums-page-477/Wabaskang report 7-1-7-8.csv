1328116,Big Mike,2011-07-10 18:36:00,35,"Just returned from a great week of fishing at Wabaskang...the fishing was fantastic as usual. I will give a few highlights and patterns that I was able to put together for anyone going up in the next week or so. I would have to say that this year's mayfly hatch was the absolute worst I have ever seen in! With that in mind I spoke to many groups that were struggling as I arrived to camp on Friday. They said the walleyes bite was tough. I knew right away that this would mean ""monster"" walleyes would be our primary target as the smaller ones were probably gorging themselves. We targeted thick,green cabbage beds with crankbaits and stickbaits. We were able to boat several fish over 25"" with two over 28"". We stayed in the weeds for our big fish and caught our eaters and others by pitching 1/8 oz jigs/minnows onto any rocky wind blown point we could find. These walleyes seemed to be keyed in on minnows if they were on rock structure instead of the millions of mayflys found over mud/weed areas. We needed to be in 8 feet or less for these rock fish to bite. The northern were aggressive with a 43"" beast caught by my younges son the largest of the trip (pics at wabaskangcamp.com) and also many over 35 inches up to 40 inches from all areas of the lake...primarily deep weed edges but a surprisingly large amount are already migrating to the rock points and reefs close to weedbeds. It should be a great summer for fishing once the mayfly hatch ends for anyone targeting walleye. I would bring crawlers along also because there is a great spinner rig bite happening in shallow weeds and it will continue through the rest of July. Good luck to anyone going and I will post another report after my next trip end of July. As always feel free to stop and say hi to me if you see the Team Crestliner or stop by Jim and Julies camp if you see it tied to the dock! Later, Mike"
