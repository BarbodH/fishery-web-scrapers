1328350,troutwater,2011-07-11 10:33:00,299,I just returned from Cedar Lake and my god was the mayfly hatch horrible. Some of the other guys in camp were saying it was the worst they had ever seen. One guy had a brand new outboard that the water pump quit working on. When he stuck a wire up it he found that it was totally clogged with mayflies. Just wondering if any other lakes have had it that bad as well.
1328365,v-bay gord,2011-07-11 10:58:00,3168,Eagle had what I would consider a bountiful mayfly harvest.......it seems to be winding down to almost over. Fishing was good to excellent for most folk throughout the few weeks this lasted.
1328367,Golden Eagle,2011-07-11 11:05:00,2642,Whitefish love mayfles. Whitefish fatten up and Esox fatten up on whitefish. A productive cycle.
1328397,phishfearme,2011-07-11 12:47:00,1242,i guess bad is in the eye of the beholder! lots of mayflies this year - see photo of our kearns lake cabin at night - thousands of them - like a cloud over the cabin. fishing was still great - especially for the larger fish who i think concentrate on smaller fish and ignore these little morsels. phish

1328627,troutwater,2011-07-11 22:41:00,299,"I fished muskies all week except for about a 3 hour window one day so the mayfly hatch didn't have a huge effect on me. Two other people in our group were after the eater walleyes and they had a hard time connecting with fish consistently though. I've just never seen that many before, and it was constant for the first half of the trip."
1328713,Bill Krejca,2011-07-12 08:15:00,6107,"I maybe have a little different take on the mayflies hatching. Although in some areas the hatch may mean less fish caught (by some), in other areas it may result in improved or about the same fishing. The thing that leaves me in awe is that a healthy hatch, I am told, is due to a relatively healthy body of water, whether it is a lake, stream, or impoundment. Many of us who live elsewhere and traverse annually, or more often to the north country, would love to have that same degree of clean water to sustain hatches near where we live. Bill Krejca"
1328975,jld235,2011-07-12 18:20:00,11,A group of us were on Northern Light Lake the last week of June. The mayflies hatched the day before we arrived. The result was almost no walleye being boated. All the locals told us not to bother targeting walleye for a few days after the hatch. The good news was that smallmouth and lakers seemed more than willing to cooperate.JD
1329090,Moondog,2011-07-12 21:53:00,362,Fished the mayfly hatch on Gull Rock with no problem. If you see fish suspended on your fish finder........use suspended baits! or find a place where fish are and no mayfly's. Boated many large fish during the hatch. Think maybe the bigger ones target larger baits. Should be over most places so no need to be concerned anyway.
