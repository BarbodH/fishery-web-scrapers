1328076,Eyes_R_Us,2011-07-10 16:00:00,66,This year I am going to Eagle much later than usual - the first week of August. I'm typically an early June type but I have also had great fishing there in mid July. Can I expect any big differences from the mid July patterns? Typically in mid July we find the Walleyes along the sunken rock reefs in about 20 to 30 ft of water. I usually take 1/2 flat of crawlers for daytime fishing and 1/2 pound of leeches for evenings. Are those two baits still productive in August? Any tips on hunting Northerns this time of year would also be appreciated. Thanks.
1328231,stevie,2011-07-11 06:07:00,21,"the nice thing about aug is aug is aug regardless of how late or early ice out mis or how early or how late turn over is so unless very extreme weather patterns are going on during your week there is you should have very good fishing. it is in many way similar to mid july though also diff. reefs points and humps are the primary location pattern though typically the general depths will be slightly deeper and fish using the stairstep sides and flats off the the bases of the bars more than the tops and first step down as in july. rigs and jigs with minnows though crawlers and leeches will catch some fish too. hot flatter weather will have some big fish buried deep in heavy cabbage and there also is a great pm suspended trolling bite over deeper basins especially after sunnier relativly calmer days when the ciscos rise into the upper 20' of the water column early evening till dark. the walleyes will be using the surface as an edge and will be up high.these same fish can be worked during the day but will be deep and touchy,the cisco rise is the dinner bell and turn on. actually aug is one mof the most consistant and patternable times for both numbers and size on eagle and many bigger deeper shield lakes. good luck steve AML"
