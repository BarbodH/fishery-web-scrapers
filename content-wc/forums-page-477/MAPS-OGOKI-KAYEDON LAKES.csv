547792,ONE TIME DAVE,2005-05-11 11:43:00,110,"NEED depth maps of both OGOKI and KAYEDON LAKES. These are located North of Nakina, as a fly in. I have tried map dealers and map distributors. They all say they have them, then they check to find out they don't. If you have fished either or both lakes and have a map I will be happy to pay your cost for a copy. Thanks in advance."
547793,Guest,2005-05-11 12:04:00,0,Have tried http://app.gov.mb.ca/cust/cdeploy?ec...walkin1.en.htm Look at section 42-L
547797,ONE TIME DAVE,2005-05-11 13:02:00,110,I have tried the Manitoba site. No luck. They get theirs from a distributor in Eastern Ontario. He has these lakes listed on his web site and in the catalog but does not have the maps. THANKS for your suggestion. Dave
547823,Guest,2005-05-12 05:21:00,0,try maptown.com-i have had good luck with them.
547857,Fishoil,2005-05-12 17:53:00,1277,You might want to check Skinner's in Longlac. They have a pretty good selection of maps for the area.
547866,phishfearme,2005-05-12 20:13:00,1242,"one time - i think if you're looking for DEPTH maps of these lakes, you're gonna be outta luck unless the outfitter has generated then himself. the various map sources around - both governmental and commercial - have only a few of the most popular lakes sounded. please post if you find a source for depth maps. - phish"
547915,Guest,2005-05-13 12:40:00,0,"One Time Dave, When are you going and where are you staying. On ogoki or Kayedon? I have been going up there going on 10 years and have never seen a map showing depths. Sure would like one though."
547916,ONE TIME DAVE,2005-05-13 13:01:00,110,"We are going to Melchett Lake this year and have reserved a cabin on Kayedon for next year. Just doing some early research. You having been to the lakes that many times can probably be an asset to my research, if you are willing to share info. We are staying at the cabin which was owned by Twin Lakes. It was purchased over the winter by Arctic Watershed Outposts. We have used this outfitter 9 times in the past with #10 in June. I had a person mention a bay in Ogoki called ""monster bay"". He couldn't remember where it was. Thought it was into the lake from the river coming from Kayedon. My e-mail is [email protected] or [email protected]. Any info appreciated. Thanks Dave"
548032,Guest,2005-05-17 12:40:00,0,"Well I've been fishing there around 20 years. I made my own map with depth charts that will also so structure and the type of structure present. There are hotspot locations marked for eatter walleye and trophy locations as well. I have the same info on pike too. For a nominal fee you can purchase this complete set of ""hot maps"". Coming soon moon guide to night time fishing and water temp postings. Good fishing: There is a bay I named called ""Hog Bay"" it's included in the maps above if your interested."
548062,ONE TIME DAVE,2005-05-18 05:36:00,110,"Interested in ""hot maps"" of Okoki and Kayedon. Advise cost and address to send $$$ to. E-mail is [email protected] or [email protected]. Thanks for reply"
