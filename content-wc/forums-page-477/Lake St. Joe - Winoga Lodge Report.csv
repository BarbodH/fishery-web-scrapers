1328369,Guest,2011-07-11 11:12:00,0,"Just returned from a great trip at Lake St. Joe. We booked through Winoga Lodge. As many had mentioned, Dick was a fantastic host and the cabin was the ""Hilton"". He took us to the outpost very early Saturday morning ""so we could get fishing quickly"". He took the time to take us around in his twin engine boat and fished the various reefs and marked up the map with other areas to check out. We got back to the cabin and Dick and I cleaned the fish and and Dick and Kim joined us for a great lunch before they took off. It was nice that he spent some time and allowed us to get to know them and vice versa. The first morning my brother and I got up early and went out fishing; the counter said 53 before we retured to the cabin for breakfast. The remainder of the week continued with success and good times. As I was told, and will confirm, the majority of the walleyes were between 19"" and 21"" with many over 23"". The largest was 28"". There was a mayfly hatch going on, but it didn't seem to hinder the fishing. Depending on the sun and wind, we caught fishing from 5' to 31' off the edge of the reefs. Thank you to all for the help and suggestions that you made. I do recommend trying out Lake St. Joe at least once; and without a doubt recommend Winoga Lodge."
1328403,IaDave,2011-07-11 13:05:00,476,Thanks for the report. I'm still working on a trip this year with him but it is not looking too promising. Will probably end up going to his island camp on Abrams in Sept. I have been there at leat 10+ times. He is a great guy and will do anything for you and the fishing is not too bad there either in the fall. How was the ride in his boat and did you have any luck with the pike?
