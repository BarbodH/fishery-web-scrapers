1327796,BenBeattie,2011-07-09 18:19:00,232,"Right now there are a couple things going on here. 1. there is a weedline walleye bite in 8-12 feet and 2. the walleye have moved to the big water (baisns) and are holding in 18-25 feet on islands, humps/reefs etc. Colour doesn't seem to matter for jigs, they all catch fish. Having said that, I do tend to use glow, chart., white, pink and orange a lot. Another tip... follow the wind! Fish structure that is being hit by the wind/waves. Good luck!"
1327840,OmahaHawk,2011-07-09 21:08:00,5,Thanks for the tips. Hopefully walleye fishing goes well and then we can target some pike any advice on fishing pike in the same area of the lake?
1327846,davenathe,2011-07-09 21:16:00,113,try vaughn and any areas with cabbage
1327968,BenBeattie,2011-07-10 10:04:00,232,"Weeds, stumps, reefs close to shore. If there is a weedline walleye bite there will be big pike nearby."
1328560,Limeyangler,2011-07-11 19:29:00,563,I have fished that area a few times at this time of year....WEED!....find the cabbage in 10' to 15' of water. I have even fished a creek up that way off a small bay...they were in as little as 2' of water in thick weed...we had to cast slip bobbers to small weedless pockets....very effective.
