Of course, after the dam it's the rock road again and we had to crawl. Got to DHL a whole hour early! Went down to Lac Andou. Caught a few Walleye in the channel where you have to then bang a 90 degree. Headed into Andou proper and caught three or four near the submerged snow mobile in 9 to 10 feet of water. All throwbacks, though. Tomorrow, we are headed to big water to fish for lakers."

Of course, once past the dam, it's back to 5 mph for the last mile or two into DHL. The water is going down on the Cabonga. We were at the main dam on Sunday and you should have heard the roar of the water gushing out of the dam into the Gens de Terre. Looks like it's falling 1/2"" to 1"" a day. As for the fishing, catching a lot of Walleye but they are all small. Kept 3 so far. Excellent for lakers, caught 3 and kept 2, 5 and 7 lbs. Nary a pike though. My father caught one today in Whitefish Lake but he was too small to keep and smelled really fishy, too. Tomorrow we are heading down to Baie Dixie for Lakers in the morning and walleye in Waseka Bay."
