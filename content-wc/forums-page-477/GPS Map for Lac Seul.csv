1327979,C Schmidt Fish,2011-07-10 11:02:00,1,"I am making my first trip to Lac Seul in August. I have been researching options for a GPS lake chip for my Lowrance ifinder h2o. I found out that the newest Navionics chip, at least the premium Canada chip, will not work in the h2o and I also found out that the h2o has been discontinued, which might explain why the new chip won't work in the h2o. I also found mixed reviews on the Navionics chips. It appears that the Lac Seul map is 10' contours, which some people don't find very helpful. If I can find a chip, is it worth the money? Since the newest version of the chips won't work in my h2o, does anyone know if there are older versions that would work in the h2o? It appears that there are some versions of hotmaps(not platinum or premium) that might work. Is there any difference in detail for Lac Seul between these versions? Seems like the older versions are hard to find. Don't want to buy a chip that won't work in my h2o, since I don't have plans on buying a new GPS. Or, should I be looking at buying a new GPS and newer chip?"
1328009,rnnonmt,2011-07-10 12:31:00,992,I know for certain that Lac Seul was not surveyed in less than 10 foot contours. If you purchase the premium or platinum hotmap for Lac Seul there is no difference in the mapping on these more expensive versions versus the standard hotmap. Buy the standard hotmap if you are going after Lac Seul only. Hope this helps
1328026,rather-be-fishin,2011-07-10 13:37:00,429,On Lac Seul a GPS & Navionics lake map is VERY helpful! Try to find a old Navionics Hot Maps Canada Canada chip or the Lake of the Woods/ Rainy Lake chip. (2007?) version. They should work. Try looking/posting on Craigs List & you should be able to find one. I have an old Lowrance iPro 2005 handheld unit & those chips work in it. Hope this helps.
