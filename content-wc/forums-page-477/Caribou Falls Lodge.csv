1328540,Brandin Iron,2011-07-11 18:00:00,11,I'am looking at Caribou Falls Lodge for our next fishing outing--any reviews on the lodge and the fishing out of that camp. We have been to Angler's Kingdom the last 2 years and would like to try a new adventure. The Kingdom had great fishing and wonder what we could expect at Caribou Falls.
1328905,Larbo,2011-07-12 16:02:00,231,Stayed at Caribou Falls Lodge each year from 2001 thru 2006. Walleye and smallmouth bite is always good. Had to work a little for bigger northern and musky. They netted all there own minnows back then. half oz jigs are a must when close to the English River channel. Food was better than average. I don't have anything bad to say about them. We stopped going because it was such a long drive from Des Moines IA. Found a place on LOTW that is just as nice with a short drive time.
