Tried Lac Poigan a few years ago, beautiful scenery but walleye that year were few. The locals claimed it was an off year. Any suggestions for another lake to fish/camp in the parc ? I undersatnd there is a slot limit for walleye this year. Would be nice to hook some pike for a change. Would also like to sleep soundly knowing my stuff won't get broken into as we sleep."
1295337,emanonmac,2011-04-15 22:56:00,62,"Fishing at Cabonga is risky with the stealing by the indians. A little further up you will find the logging road leading to Deer Horn Lodge. Never had a problem there or heard of one. Usually just leave my gear on the boat overnight. Reservoir level was way down last year as they were working on the dam going to the Ottowa river. Have heard that in the past when the level has gone down that much, it takes a couple years for the fishing to return to it's previous level. I have also noted they have a slot limit up there this year. 18 mile logging road in will test the shocks on your vehicle and can cause some damage to your boat if you bring one with you and go faster than say 10 MPH. New owner there this year but still in the Hamel family. I've always found that they do a pretty good job marking any rocks you might encounter but still a good idea to keep your eyes peeled and get one of the laminated maps showing depths and such. Not going this year myself as we are trying to sell our parents house and when that goes through I'm selling my boat and getting a bigger one to fish up there. 3 guys in a 17' boat works but there's not much room."

Pavillon is at the southern end of Cabonga. We now go to Deer Horn except for last year, because of the low water. I do wish they would do something about the road going to Deer Horn."
1326582,eatsleepfish,2011-07-06 12:38:00,52,"I have been going to DHL on and off since 1981. Never had a problem with the Indians up there but have heard horror stories from those that have stayed at the other end of the lake. If you are going to camp, I would go in at the southern end of the Cabonga and fish in the big water, or Baie Dixie. When I was a kid, I canoed the Gens de Terre with a group and we spent a few days fishing in Lac Saint Amore and it was insane! Of course that was over 30 years ago. Going back Friday and can't wait. Even if the Walleye fishing is slow, it won't matter for Lakers! I will be posting daily reports on my blog if you want to follow:http://eatsleepfish.blogspot.com/"

1326807,still fishin',2011-07-06 23:29:00,69,No problems with theft/security at DHL. Lake level normal this year. Logging road is in the best shape ever. The Quebec Water Authority now uses the road to the dam and has paid to upgrade it. Almost as good as paved except for the last mile (after the dam).

1328988,eatsleepfish,2011-07-12 18:38:00,52,"Turns out the reason why the Rock Road is so nice is because every two weeks inspectors have to drive out to check out the **** and I guess they complained to Quebec Hydro that the roads needs to be fixed. Bought tears to our eyes seeing 30 mph on the rock road. Saturday, Lac Andou: caught a total of 10 walleye all under the minimum slot limit of 14 5/8s Sunday, Big Water: 3 lakers, kept 2, 5 lb & 7 lb Monday, Waseka/Rock Lake, 6 walleye and kept 1 Tuesday, Whitefish Lake, 20 walleye, kept 2"
