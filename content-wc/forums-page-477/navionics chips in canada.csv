1329049,bigwalleye1,2011-07-12 20:45:00,2632,"Wallydave, I called Navionics some years ago and asked specifically at what elevation the lake was mappped. I was told 1167 is the target elevation for the lake, so the Navionics map (10' intervals) was made with that elevation as a baseline. I check www.lwcb.ca and get the current elevation before I go, and I'm pretty close by using 1167 and the ""plus or minus"" factor from the website listed."
1327289,kordman,2011-07-08 04:51:00,5,Going to canada in august. I see that navionics has a chip for the lake we are going to. does anyone have one and how good arre the maps.
1327320,Outfitter17,2011-07-08 06:40:00,127,"Kordman,I have the premium chip for canada and our lake shows up with great detail, all the rocks that I know of are marked. It's a great tool if you are new to the lake or even if you have fished it 30 years, I found Rocks, breaks, humps that I neve knew existed.You can't go wrong by picking one up."
1327353,rnnonmt,2011-07-08 07:38:00,992,I have the US North region standard hotmap which includes some of Ontario lakes in my humminbird. I thought the map was good.
1327360,Pezman38,2011-07-08 07:49:00,3196,"I have the hotmaps premium as well and use it on Gull Rock. I find the contours to be off about 5-10 feet, so keep that in mind and be patient. If you find a spot to try on the contour make sure you slow down and idle over those spots instead of trying to see them at 20-30, could miss it."
1327376,Obabikon,2011-07-08 08:02:00,2370,"No matter what lake, if Lake Master has the lake done, it's better. I've used hotspots, navionics, and Lake Master. Whatever the guys at bass pro or cabelas say, if they don't say lake master, they're just peddling a product. Lake master is by far the best chip. The detail and readability is so superior to any of the other companies that it isn't even comparable. The most important thing is though... make sure you do some research. Don't get a ""general"" map with a bunch of lakes on it. Also, make sure that they've actually done a survey of the lake. Your lake chip should cost around a hundred bucks, and you'll probably have to order it online."
1327382,Obabikon,2011-07-08 08:05:00,2370,"Also, I was not meaning to be rude to anyone who uses the other companies' products. GPS maps are great."
1327479,jignminow,2011-07-08 11:51:00,168,"also, from expierience, watch where you are going and not just your screen!!!!!!!! I was screwing around with the Lowrance settings one time while I was under power and realized that I had moved over a reef. The depth went from 22' to 2' real quick and thank God I was trimmed on plain or it would have been all bad. I was able to vere back off without trouble...luckily, I was smart enough not to throttle down or I would still be sitting on top of something very bad right now....."
1327504,rather-be-fishin,2011-07-08 12:27:00,429,"I contacted Lakemaster because I wanted to get a chip for Lac Seul. They told me they don't have permission or access to chart lakes in Canada. I also just spoke with Navionics & was told depending on your atenna reception the map can be off 10 to 20+ meters. However, they said the new 50 channel external antennas (compared to 16 channel) are much more accurate within 3-5 meters. So use the chip as a guide & when it shows reefs slow down & stay away. I have used the Navionics Canada chip on Lac Seul & it has worked great!"
1327517,wallydave,2011-07-08 13:01:00,2151,"I am new the electronics of fishing, but if you have a map in your equipment, the depths shown would they be averages? After fishing the NW end of Lac Seul over ten years, I know how much the water levels can change, as mentioned before, keep one eye on your screen, and one where you are going!"
1328984,jld235,2011-07-12 18:30:00,11,"I agree LakeMaster is the way to go if your lake is avaliable. LakeMaster doesn't do a very good job of survey a great number of lakes, but they do a great job on the lake that they do survey.That being said, I just got back from Canada and used the Navionics chip. The outline of the islands were good, but the depths and drop offs were less than desirable. However, the lake that I fished was not one of the Navionic high def lakes...I can only imagine their high def lakes are much better. I found the Canada chip worth the money...especially since it was my first time on the body of water. But it is now where near the quality as my WI LakeMaster chip.My two cents.JD"
