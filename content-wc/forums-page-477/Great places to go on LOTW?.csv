1328229,Ia Walihntr,2011-07-11 06:00:00,320,Try Mylie's Place Resort out of Morson. It is a drive-to with excellent facilities and first class owners. Excellent fishing close by. www.myliesplaceresort.com Marv
1328304,Shorelunch,2011-07-11 08:45:00,554,"I recommend Morson - easy drive, great scenery and great fishing. On shore, Mylie's - and a short boat ride to Obabikon. Both great choices."
1328400,geareng,2011-07-11 13:00:00,335,"We have been going to LOTW for the last three years after switching from the houseboats on Lac Seul. I did allot of research as far as where to stay and fish depending on the time of year and we determine the best area for us was to be in Sioux Narrows because we have the option of going south into Whitefish Bay's clear water or go to the north depending on the weather and water temperature. We stay at Rod and Reel and have been very happy with the accomodations. They have cater to our needs, have options of a variety of meal choices (great food by the way), are reasonably priced and have nice clean cabins."
1327916,Guest,2011-07-10 07:41:00,0,"I'm looking for a great resort to go with my dad (82), brothers, and our boys (13 to 20). We have been to Witch bay camp twice and they are A-1 people, with a beautiful resort. The first trip the fishing was great. The second trip was slow (for canada). It's been five years since we have been to canada as a family, and would like a drive to resort with great fishing reasonably close to the cabins. We may end up at Witch Bay again as they were such nice people. Do you have any suggestions for Canada that may fit the bill. I know everyone wants to find a great drive to resort, I will take whatever suggestions you have and research. We would be going mid-july to this place. Thanks for your input. Icedog"
1327929,Hawker,2011-07-10 08:02:00,3967,"If a ""drive to"" resort isn't limited to a five minute boat ride from the landing to an island resort, then I can't help but ""Highly"" recommend Young's Wilderness Camp on Stevens Bay just north of Nestor Falls!! Wonderful wonderful people, very comfortable cozy cabins, and the fishing is excellent on minutes from the camp! Very nice boats with electric start Honda or Yamaha outboards, TM's and Lowrance electronics. First class folks (Perry & Carol) who care about their guests and take great pride in providing a great getaway fishing camp!! Food is outstanding as well!! Wife & I have been going there for the past 20 years straight, wouldn't even consider going anywhere else!!"
1327932,Outfitter17,2011-07-10 08:09:00,127,"Hawker is right,If you are looking for great owners, nice boats, nice cabins, good food, and you want to stay on LOW you can't go wrong with Young's. The 5 Minute ride adds a bit of adventure to the trip, you will have all the comforts of a drive in and you might like it when you return from fishing and your vehicle isn't parked right next to your cabin. It's a nice remote setting with good people."

1327955,Slushfish,2011-07-10 09:20:00,263,"Canadian Haven is tough to beat for the price. Brian and Kathy are are super hosts that will give you the shirt off their back. Very clean, comfortable cabins. Friendly, quiet camp. Will be their again Saturday."
1327973,MN_Moose,2011-07-10 10:44:00,964,Smith Camps Kenora. Nearby the places you fished at Witch Bay. Not as remote drive to. http://www.smithcamps.com/
1328028,eyeman_1,2011-07-10 13:45:00,690,"I would second Totem Lodge - however, I would recommend their so called ""OutPost"" at Wiley Point. I just came back from out 7th trip out there and the fishing was fantastic - perhaps the best trip yet. The resort is about an hour boat ride from Totem in Sioux Narrows, which is part of the adventure. The facilities are first class, food is good and if you are using the camp boats they are alright. I'm not a fan of the Triumph boats they have, but the are durable and well equiped as far as camp boats go. You will have a GPS and graph, livewell, baitwell, all the nets, life jackets, lights, marine radio that you will need. Guided packages are available but not necessary. Check out their website and take a look for your self. If you like the more pampered experience than look at Totem. We too have considered Witch Bay and were seriously planning on staying there this year. We had some nice conversations with Steve at the Outdoor Show, and really liked what we heard and saw. The only two things that gave us pause was the fact that not all cabins have private facilities and the unknown about the road in as we were bringing our own boats in."
1328131,Obabikon,2011-07-10 19:07:00,2370,www.obabikon.com Has some of the best walleye fishing on the entire lake within a few minutes of the camp.
1328155,nemusky,2011-07-10 20:10:00,60,"Not on shore, but the island is only 9 miles out from Nestor Falls, which allows you less travel to find fish! Also the resort owner, Mike, is top notch and the rates are very reasonable.http://www.splitrocklodge.net/"
1328187,1shooter,2011-07-10 21:32:00,1493,I will second that......great resort and good fishing!
