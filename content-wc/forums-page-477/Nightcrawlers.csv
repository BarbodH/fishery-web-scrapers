I was told by someone that I could order a flat of night crawlers ready for Canada from a bait shop or gas station in International Falls and pick them up on the way. Just wondered if anybody does this and who to contact. Thank You, O R"
1328542,camp chef,2011-07-11 18:02:00,915,We get ours in Emo at Village Variety. Call Marlene You can google up their email and phone. I think we paid $42 for a flat this spring. Nice crawlers.They had great looking bakery too. Next year we will order are bread to be picked up there as well

Our group of six always goes to NW Ontario the week of Memorial Day and takes two flats of crawlers along. For years I bought the crawlers locally then found two styrofoam containers and bedding to use, picked up the crawlers, prepared the bedding, picked the crawlers out of the dirt they came in. . . . what a pain. In recent years I have purchased the crawlers, already packed in bedding for Canada, from either Vados Bait or Knutson's Live Bait. Tell them the date you'll leave for Canada and they'll ship the crawlers (UPS, FedEx, Speedi, etc.) for delivery at your door a day or two before you leave. I put a plastic soda bottle of ice in each container and duct tape it shut. There is still ice - plus plump lively crawlers - when we unload at camp.For the last two years the crawlers from these two sources, including shipping costs, were cheaper than I could buy them in dirt locally.http://www.knutsonlivebait.com/night_crawlers.htmlhttp://www.vadosbait.com/P.S. If you travel through or around the Twin Cities on your way north, it's not hard to get to Vados' shop for pick-up."

Crawlers and fresh bakery in one stop. I just hope Marlene is washing her hands between the crawler flats and the fresh bakery. LMFAO! I have gotta stop in Emo this year. Marlene, I'm on my way!!!!!"
1328841,Mike Kansas,2011-07-12 13:16:00,1463,"You can call Cabelas in Owatanna Minn and tell them when you will pick them up and they will be ready. Assuming you are taking I-35 north. The crawlers are in a Canada pak approved for entry into Canada. Good Luck, Mike Kansas (Raised in Iowa City)"
1328865,IaDave,2011-07-12 14:01:00,476,Anybody know of a place in Minnesota that I can pick up some on the way to Canada. I haven't had much luck doing it myself and the bait shop that did it around here is closed up. As far as crawlers go we always stopped at Cabelas.
1328887,davenathe,2011-07-12 15:06:00,113,"Get them in Canada, every bait shop should have in stock. That way no issue at the border."
1328902,Outfitter17,2011-07-12 15:53:00,127,"Get them at Sportsmans Service in Int'l Falls, MN. They are already packed in the right bedding for going over the border. You can call Tim at 218-283-2411. They are located right on hwy 53 as you are going through town to the border."
