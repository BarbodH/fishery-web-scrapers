3890129,lassh,2015-05-20 16:03:00,553,How low is LOW from normal? Does anyone know if you can get from Ash Bay to Shoal at the current time. I heard that last week some people couldn't launch from the ramps across from the Safeway in Kenora because lake was too low. Did level come up much after rains over the weekend? Thanks

3893825,lassh,2015-05-21 16:53:00,553,Thanks for the bump Mr. Pike. I sure would like to know if folks are getting through. I've hit rocks twice on LOW and am paranoid now so I don't know if I'll try unless i hear something. I hope to be up there on Saturday after noon. I'll let you how it went upon my return. Anybody got a read on level in Northwest Lake of Woods or in Kenora area?
3894153,bassnblast,2015-05-21 19:02:00,56,I checked with Ash Rapids Lodge today. They said they're able to get through. We'll be up there June 3-7.

3902842,bassnblast,2015-05-25 08:44:00,56,Thanks -- you too... Please report when you return!
3903770,Iceshack05,2015-05-25 15:41:00,31,A buddy of mine went through on Saturday. No issue's. But go slow...
3921065,lassh,2015-05-31 07:17:00,553,"We got through both rapids with no issues to do some smallie and pike fishing. We did catch some walleyes while smallmouth fishing on swim baits and cranks. Fishing was good on NW LOW. Walleyes are in transition. We caught them anywhere from 5 to 30 FOW. They haven't yet moved out to deep humps etc. Smallmouth are on points and rocks near spawning areas. After the weather on Thursday, they moved out a little deeper."
