3911866,octanehi5,2015-05-28 05:37:00,1104,"Glad to hear you guys fish for them, Makes for less people were I fish. I have never asked the mods to Dust a thread, Not trying to make history. fishism is practiced here, If not why is there a separate thread for Muskie? I believe that certain topics belong in there own place. My favorite fish to catch are bluefin tuna,But then again this is the wrong thread.Good luck in your fishing endeavors for what ever your fishing for Octanehi5"
3911914,zeebee,2015-05-28 05:56:00,1144,"I have not fished Crow however, generally when I encounter schools of undersized smallies...I go deeper till I find what I want. 30' levels depending on lake and time of year.Take some heavier jig/tube setups.By the way........smallies to walleye are not the same as bluefins are to dum-asses."
3912186,BuckeyeBill,2015-05-28 07:06:00,76,How about a smallmouth board being added to walleye central? Just a thought.
3912194,skindzier,2015-05-28 07:07:00,137,"Hey ocatane - all I'm doing is asking for advice for a side-trip I'm going to take while on my WALLEYE trip. There's certainly room in here to talk about other fish, etc that we may run into while on our walleye trip. Maybe we shouldn't talk about the cool wildlife we see up there too, or the good places to eat or stay... Point is, walleye fishermen do actually do other things than fish for walleyes and there are other folks that may be interested in those things. Anyway, thanks to those that have responded!"
3912226,skindzier,2015-05-28 07:08:00,137,"I've also found that the folks on this board are the most helpful of any of the fishing boards I've frequented, so who better to ask for advice?"
3912346,Hawker,2015-05-28 07:26:00,3967,"Crow is a beautiful lake to fish for a variety of species and I wish I could spend more time fishing it than I do! I primarily target Lake Trout on Crow, then Musky, then Smallmouth, but we are usually up there a little earlier than the end of June.I'm sure you'll likely get some good pointers etc before I get back with you, but I've got a couple of friends that live up there and target the Smallies on Crow, so I'll get hold of them and glean any info I can for you if you'd like and pass it along here on via PM.BTW, this is the Canada forum! Last time I checked (recently I may add) open discussion on all popular fish species sought after in Canada are open for discussion, NOT just Walleye!!"
3912410,RCDuck,2015-05-28 07:38:00,18,Skindzier.... sent you a PM
3913994,freespoolin,2015-05-28 15:21:00,472,"I have fished Crow Lake since 1985 and caught Lake Trout, Musky, Pike and Smallmouth. It definitely is one of the most beautiful lakes anywhere. Smallmouth can be found anywhere up against steep walls and on boulder strewn points. Catch enough and you'll catch bigger ones. Good luck. While I'm primarily a walleye fisherman, catching a tail walking smallie is a thrill."
3909762,skindzier,2015-05-27 12:15:00,137,"Hi folks - we've been going Lake of the Woods in Nestor for the last 4 years now & love it! Last year we took a half day out on Crow to go after smallies. We caught plenty of them & had a blast, however they were almost all small (12 inches or less). We were throwing primarily crawdad cranks. We'll be up again on June 27th & wondered if anybody might want to share some info on spots/methods/info to try & get into some bigger ones. Certainly not looking for anyone's ""A"" spot, just some places/things to try as I explore. Thanks a bunch!"
3909882,Thompmd,2015-05-27 12:58:00,320,"Finally a ""smallmouth"" fisherman lol. We are smallmouth fishermen but we fish for everything and generally use baits that target about anything. We stay in Nestor Falls and always make a day trip over to Crow for smallmouth. What a beautiful lake. We always have much better luck with size on Crow if we picked a day with either some cloud cover/wind to hide us. We generally had good luck with spinnerbaits, jerkbaits, tubes all in natural colors. The other thing that definitely helped was flourocarbon line and long casts and also move your baits fast. Don't give them time to think. In regards to spots, we really don't have any believe it or not. We fished the conditions meaning windy shorelines, shade etc. They always said live bait works well but we didn't have much luck."
3909922,skindzier,2015-05-27 13:17:00,137,"Thanks! I agree - the lake is just gorgeous. Always loved catching smallies - I'll admit that I snuck in some musky casts too, but didn't have any action."
3909994,octanehi5,2015-05-27 13:40:00,1104,"If your catching smallmouths, your not fishing far enough north, they do make good food for cats or the garden. Read the name of this web site."
3910250,ftfarms,2015-05-27 15:16:00,444,Who yanked your chain. How rude!!
3910306,Freytown,2015-05-27 15:40:00,770,"Ron, having a bad day??? Your comments stunned me...not like you. SM bass are a fine N.America sport fish & if prepare right, fine table fare. To each his own. You need a week on Hebert buddy.....RELAX."
3910922,octanehi5,2015-05-27 19:05:00,1104,"I think you may have missed my point,WC Is about Walleye fishing,If it floats your boat to catch Smallmouths on a trip to Canada Thats ok, There are alot more sites that capitalize on Bass. I highly disagree on eating Bass not even close to Walleye or Pike. Not trying to be rude just voicing my opinion. Yes I do need a trip to a real walleye lake 25 days No Bass were I'm headed, Cars, Roads, tv or phone,only toothy critters There is a board on here called General Discussion related to Fishing"
3911122,BuckeyeBill,2015-05-27 20:03:00,76,Ask Al Lindner what's his favorite fish? Smallmouth !! Leaving June 6th for a week on our favorite smallie lake. Can't wait !!!!!
3911370,spotter,2015-05-27 20:43:00,178,smallmouth to me are the most fun to fish for of any species imo... i would rather fish them then walleye any day....
3911634,Nimstug,2015-05-27 22:47:00,2605,"As much as I love Walleye Central, if I had one fish I'd prefer to catch it'a a smallmouth bass. My experience is people are willing to share other species information here. Fishism is not practiced here. I've never seen a smallie thread dusted. Click on the red triangle and see what the mods think. You couild make history. Nimstug"
