I'm also interested if some of the US based clubs get Canada specific. I think I'd be interested in a once a month type get together. I did a quick search and it seems some of the fishing clubs listed on an old WC thread have either disbanded or at least their web presence has changed. It seems it would be a good way to keep the fire burning throughout the year while learning and sharing."
