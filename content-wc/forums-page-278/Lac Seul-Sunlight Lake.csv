3911282,MikeinMN,2015-05-27 20:29:00,190,"Our group stays at Gawleys which is pretty close to Ear Falls. We have been fishing Lac Seul for close to 10 years now and last year we finally made it past Manitoba Point. There was an amazing number of boats visible south of MP, especially considering there is not a resort real close to that area. This was in late summer and we will be at Gawleys again this year same time. I don't think I'll be down that far again this year, as the fishing was for me no better or worse than waters closer to camp. If I ever get to Broad or Sunlight it will be for adventure rather than fishing, but the creek might be too adventurous a trip for me."
3911434,Bstar,2015-05-27 21:12:00,564,The creek isn't as bad as it sounds. The ride through the creek was the best part. It's a little tricky at the mouth from the main lake as it's pretty shallow and you usually need to trim the motor up. We used to go to Lac Seul in late August or the 1st week in Sept. We always caught a lot of walleye in Sunlight then. Especially around the island and at the north end. We'll be up there on July 25th so maybe we'll check out some areas on the main lake that we haven't fished before.
3912738,JDP,2015-05-28 08:20:00,1457,Bstar you are correct. FC had the Sunlight Outpost before Lac Seul Lodge.
3903682,Bstar,2015-05-25 15:12:00,564,"Our group is headed up the Fishermans Cove on LS at the end of July (60 days to be exact but who's counting?). We haven't been up there in 13 years. We've done some fly-ins since then. My question is ""Does anybody run up to Sunlight lake anymore?"" We used to take a day and go to Sunlight because it was a nice ride through Altimeter Creek and the lake itself is like fishing in a old Hamms beer commercial. We always caught a ton of walleye there although we never caught any to brag about. Any thoughts?"
3904282,greg2648,2015-05-25 19:15:00,80,We will be there the first week in July. We fish Broad/Sunlight lakes every year. We catch alot of Walleye at both lakes. Easy fishing. Greg.
3904450,prov1800,2015-05-25 20:00:00,5010,Most people myself included fish there in the spring.fishing is awesome there then.still catch fish there the rest of the year but its a long trip and the fishing is ten times better on the main lake.most fish head out of there to the main lake.some stay.not worth it in my book anyways
3904826,Aspencreek,2015-05-25 22:29:00,2911,"Broad and Sunlight are good early but after the spawn or when the water temps it that ""special"" temp most of the fish are making there way down Altimeter into the main lake basin. By the end of June most of the fish are gone, there are always going to be some, and some of the big girls stay there as long as the forage minnows can support them.I always liked the ride up river but a couple of those turns and the tight corners around some of those stumps made the trip interesting, now since we go in July and again in Sept. it doesn't pay to spend the time or effort. Besides if I want that experience, I will make the much easier trip up the river on the east side of South islet to that small lake. I have caught my biggest fish up there 2 out of the last 3 years, plus I usually have it to myself."
3905178,SinOrSwim,2015-05-26 06:26:00,1528,Is the water down on LS too? Be a tough ride in some of those spots if the water was down? We went in there once. We were told in the fall many of the big ones migrate in there. We had no luck at all. Cool ride to do once though
3905274,prov1800,2015-05-26 06:42:00,5010,Havnt been to lac seul yet this year sim.my early guests have changed to july.got a few gigs up there even taking some guys out from onaway.freind of mine and some others camped at the launch on the opener.was iffy launching there boats then.had some rain so i imagine its pretty good.might have to watch a couple of areas.just been fishing cedar and cliff lakes.very good fishing.water a bit low there also.i wouldnt waste my time going to broad in the fall.fall time is big fish time on lac seul.and every other lake for that matter.you guys headed up again this fall.
3905530,SinOrSwim,2015-05-26 07:43:00,1528,"We will be there September 12,13,14, 15. Are you around?"
3906418,prov1800,2015-05-26 11:54:00,5010,Iam always around.lol.great time of the year.
3906450,Carnhzkr,2015-05-26 11:58:00,964,"Lac Seul Lodge has an outpost camp on Sunlight. I stayed there in early August two years ago and will be doing so again this August. The outpost is great because it provides easy access to some of the prime area on LS - just a short ride to Manitoba Point and that area. We did 90% of our fishing in the big lake, but often caught our eaters at the mouth of Broad. I tried SL several evenings and always caught fish, but all small."
3909674,Bstar,2015-05-27 11:52:00,564,I think Fishermans Cove owned that outpost on Sunlight back in the late 80's or early 90's. I seem to remember it in their brochures from back then. It sounds like we should spend our time on the main lake. We've always fished in the Mckenzie Bay Area and never ventured south of Manitoba point. Any recommendations?
