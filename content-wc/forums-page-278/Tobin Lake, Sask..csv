3915810,deadhead1,2015-05-29 08:21:00,193,I lived there for 10 years and unless things have changed it will be very good time of year to be there. Where are you staying?--will you be fishing lake or river or both? Also can be very good for pike this time of the year.
3917521,Mrnovice,2015-05-29 17:02:00,75,We have been staying at Tobin Lake Resort. Mostly fished by the resort and the river but last year we brought our own boat and got to know the big lake and it was really good. We would love to get into some of those pike but couldn't find any last year
