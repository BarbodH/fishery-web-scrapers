I would need at least one boat rental also.Looking to book around the end of June next year.Any phone numbers or websites would be very helpfulThanks in advance.

Never stayed there, but appears similar to Mahkwa.Both of the above are located on the reservation. Neither hard to get to and people are pretty accommodating.There is a outpost on Vauhn, but I can't remember who's it is. Why Vaughn? What time of the year? It's my understanding that Vauhn is an spring - early summer spot. We've stopped by and fished it in late summer and it was dead. Fish were on the main lake.Pooch"
