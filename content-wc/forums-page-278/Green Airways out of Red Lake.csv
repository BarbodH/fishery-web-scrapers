I've heard they are winding down and have sold their planes.Anyone fishing with them? What's the story on camps? Have they sold some of the camps? Who is flying their guests in?Just gathering info for a possible trip again with them. Always liked the operation, but have heard that things have changed. Specifically looking at going back to Birch Lake. Fished it probably twenty times, but have not been there for eight or nine years. Hate to be disappointed after such fantastic past trips. Lots of really good memories.Pooch"
3912786,itsme,2015-05-28 08:26:00,31,Hello Pooch. One of the brothers died more than a couple of years ago. The whole thing was for sale but no takers. They had to sell off some planes to settle the estate. Just the beginning of their problems. For several years I used them to go to Bull Moose Camp. Now its Chino Air a day earlier. Suggest you go to their web site for your answers.

3913314,adempsey,2015-05-28 11:17:00,963,"I hope they are still in operation. Always disappointing to hear about places shutting down. Looking at their website, I'd think they are still operating most of their fly-in outposts. The link to the rates page shows this years date but 2013 on the actual page. Naturally, a phone call or email would be best.http://www.greensflyin.com/outposts/birch-lake-outpost/http://www.greensflyin.com/outposts/poplar-grove-camp/http://www.greensflyin.com/rates/There are two other outposts and another lodge on Birch as well.http://www.northernwilderness.net/lakes/birchhttp://www.kayair.com/BirchLake.htmlhttp://www.birchlakelodge.com/"
3913554,campchick,2015-05-28 12:42:00,96,Green Airways is definitely taking fishermen in to Birch Lake so you are in luck. Phone number is 807-727-2848. Superior Airways does their flying.
