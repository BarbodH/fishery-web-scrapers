Friday we ran to the Sawmill area and had slower day. Saturday and Sunday we mainly fished the mouth of the Wenesaga. For the 3 days the 3 of us boated 360 walleyes with the 2 biggest being 28 3/4"" and 27 3/4 inch. We went back to the cabin each day and took a break and made shore lunch. If I had my druthers we would fished all day and snacked in the boat and our catch numbers would have been even better, but not everyone in the group likes to fish quite as much. It was a great trip, but wish it could have been longer."

3910354,Knoxabilly,2015-05-27 15:58:00,225,Nice work! Those are great numbers with a few big ones mixed in. I'm ready to go back too!

3912994,stumcfar,2015-05-28 09:35:00,451,"They do have new ownership. Very nice people, who are already making changes and have other improvements in there plans. We were treated well by the previous owners and had a great three days with the new owners, actually we were their first official customers ever. They have previous experience running a fly in camp, so I am sure they will do a great job."
3913034,Mark R,2015-05-28 10:03:00,1538,This is the place next to Evergreen isn't it? We drove over there on our rain day and saw a cabin had burned down. Any idea what happened with that?
3914234,teddi,2015-05-28 17:21:00,349,Making way for new.
3914578,stumcfar,2015-05-28 19:59:00,451,"Yes, that is the place. That was a cabin that hadn't been used and was in shape beyond repair. They had the local fire department come and burn it down. They will have it cleaned up in the near future."
