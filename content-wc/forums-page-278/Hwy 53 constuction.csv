3910898,iman63,2015-05-27 18:58:00,91,"Can anyone tell me if the construction on Hwy 53 in Minnesota will cause any meaningful delays for our trip to Dryden? We are coming from central Wisconsin and google maps says about 7 hours to International Falls. We are crossing here for the first time in 25 years, usually cross at Pidgeon Falls. Also, is there a duty free shop to buy cigars there?"
3910978,dutchboy,2015-05-27 19:26:00,5717,From what i understand there is some construction North of Orr. However other then slowing down at times it shouldn't effect you much.
3911050,Bstar,2015-05-27 19:55:00,564,There's a tread on page 4 with some info on 53. There is a duty free store in IFalls
3912090,tv4fish,2015-05-28 06:52:00,2694,Iman: The duty free shop is just north of the 3 way stop that is about 1 block south of the RR crossing as you approach the border (on the west side of the road) you can't miss it as you will see a lot of people going in/out.

I think, though, the duty free on the Canadian side, on the left just after the border crossing checkpoint, will be able to help you out. If not, I believe the Big Bear station on the left a couple miles out of town on your ride to Dryden also has them available."
3912370,Mark R,2015-05-28 07:31:00,1538,Came back last Thursday and the wait times were minimal maybe 30 minutes. If you go thru the area after the construction works quitting time I would say almost no delay. If you are towing a boat use caution and slow way down or you could lose a spring or an axle. Good Luck
3912530,LOW1,2015-05-28 07:49:00,2828,Last week there was a series of repair spots on 53 - perhaps 4 or so. Looks like they are trying to repair/correct water damage in low areas. Only one had a temporary stop light. But all were very rough and should be entered at about 10 mph or so. No significant delays for us.

3921025,lassh,2015-05-31 06:58:00,553,We went through on Friday. It seems like there were about 5 repair areas with surface stripped off. One required stopping. One section was maybe 1/4 mile long. It maybe added 15 minutes to trip.
