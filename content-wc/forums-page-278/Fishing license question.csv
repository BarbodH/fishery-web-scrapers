3918385,forgop,2015-05-29 23:37:00,880,"I've only bought online once, but I printed mine at the time of purchase with no expectation of receiving anything in the mail."
3918481,Draco1206,2015-05-30 03:41:00,175,I believe if you bought your license on line you need to print it out. That is your license. You won't receive it in the mail. The outdoor card is different. You print out a copy in case you need it while you wait for the card to come in the mail.
3918593,stjoeguy,2015-05-30 05:02:00,979,"The fishing license is printed in a small block on the back of the Outdoors Card when I renewed this year. Since the Outdoors Card is good for 3 years and I got a 1 year fishing license, I'm not sure what happens next year. Probably back to a paper license to accompany the plastic card."
3918649,Shellback,2015-05-30 05:31:00,8083,"If you bought them together online, you needed to print your license out at that time. They only mail the Outdoors card."
3918737,Jeler,2015-05-30 06:33:00,92,"We purchased our License's on line and with out reading thoroughly thru the directions I did not print my license ""immediately"" and figured I could do it later. Well that didn't work and I had to email them for a copy, we had them within a week along with an attachment that said, ""Next time please print them out""The outdoors card is normally mailed."
3919353,Bayou,2015-05-30 09:20:00,52,The license is on the back of the card. I only bought the one year license so next year I will have to carry a paper license also as said above. I also kept the email from when I purchased online that I could print. I just assumed it would be two different items. Upon further review the paper that came with my license states that on ly yearly or 3 year license will be on the back of the card. It appears the 8 day licenses will not be on the back of the card.
3869425,Bayou,2015-05-14 09:42:00,52,I went ahead and bought my license last night online for this year and I chose the the yearly as I will be going up twice but was curious of the 8 day license. Can the 8 day license be bought ahead of time for a specific date? Would like to knock that out early for the better half for one of trips.
3869449,pwbmlr,2015-05-14 09:47:00,37,Yes you can put the date you want it to start on. A guy in our group bought a 8 day this year since he lives in FL and won't be back up again. The rest of us in the group bought the year license since we fish lake erie and may wonder into Canadian waters while fishing.
3869473,MrSimon,2015-05-14 09:54:00,922,"Yup, sure can."
3869537,h8go4s,2015-05-14 10:21:00,1673,How does Canadian border patrol/customs deal with that? Here in Minnesota we need to have a Remote Area Border Crossing permit from Ontario for the border waters between the Pigeon River and Lake of the Woods. It's $30 Canadian yearly. Just curious.
3869953,U D,2015-05-14 12:01:00,249,"In Michigan near the Detroit Windsor border it is just a phone call to the Canadian Border patrol to report who is on board and request permission to fish in Canadian waters that particular day. They give you a confirmation number for reference. All, no charge."
3870001,pwbmlr,2015-05-14 12:07:00,37,Yeah same in ohio. just call and let them know. Luckly the daily limit is the same for walleye in Ontario Lake Erie as is it is in Ohio. 6 per day so you don't have to worry about being over your limit. As long as you don't touch land you don't need to carry your passport either.
3871809,Bayou,2015-05-14 22:55:00,52,"Ok, thanks guys"
3872193,forgop,2015-05-15 06:15:00,880,Just bought my license and input the beginning date. Now I just need to decide if I want to spend $60+ for each of my daughters to increase my possession limit. 4 walleye isn't exactly a huge fish fry for 3 people.
3872385,onetimedave,2015-05-15 06:56:00,502,I have been buying mine on line for years
3918377,Bayou,2015-05-29 23:34:00,52,"I received my sportsman card but not the yearly license that I bought at the same time, is that normal? I assumed they would have came together. Any insight"
