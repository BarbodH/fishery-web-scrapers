3918185,pikeandtina,2015-05-29 21:25:00,145,"Hey Mike, where's that write-up?"
3902762,Mike Borger,2015-05-25 08:19:00,1554,"Just back from Nakina late last night, what a trip! I'll do a full write up asap, but day 3 of our 4 day trip my son and I experienced the single best day of trophy northern fishing I've ever had in my life! 15 fish over 40"" with the two largest topping out at 45. Many fish in the mid to high 30"" range (from 35-39"") - too many to count.I've fished that system before, but just for walleyes, was totally blown away by the pike fishing!Here's my boy with a couple..."
3903290,Further North,2015-05-25 11:54:00,2008,Holy Wow!I'd still be shaking...Pike are my favorite fish.I'm assuming a fly in to Brace Lake?
3903306,Pikeslayer8,2015-05-25 12:08:00,1460,"Right now I'm guessing Google is busy sending a whole lot of drooling fishermen to their website! 15 over 40"" in one day! I have no response to such a thing. Bet it's never been done before like that! The bar is set pretty high for your remaining 19 trips this year. Well done Brendan!!!!!!!!!!!"
3903314,Mike Borger,2015-05-25 12:10:00,1554,"Yep, it was a fly in. I'm honestly still dumbfounded. I really wasn't expecting the trophy pike fishing to be that good."
3903490,milford72,2015-05-25 13:51:00,13,Awesome pictures! Your son looks mighty proud.Would You explain what method You use to lift those big gators into the boat? It sounds like You got plenty of practice!
3903618,new hips,2015-05-25 14:41:00,498,"Sounds like a great trip, it sounds like you hit the perfect timing for the gators. Video to follow?????Thanks for sharing"
3903722,Mike Borger,2015-05-25 15:27:00,1554,"19 trips? HAHA! Honestly I have some amazing trips on tap for this year but that one day will be hard to top. If anyone is looking at Brace Lake right now here's a tip: be willing to explore. I keyed on Ara because it's the deepest lake of the 3 and made a milk run of spots on the map I was specifically looking for. I found this spot at 2pm and it was stacked with fish. Reality is it was really not even a full day, more a half day once I found the spot. And yeah, Bren did well, I'm very proud. Quote: Originally Posted by milford72Awesome pictures!

The fish were unhooked in the water in the cradle, lifted quickly for a pic then back to the cradle to revive.A large number of the pike I grabbed by hand though, simply because I was throwing a Husky Jerk with 3 tiny sharp trebles that always get horribly snarled in the mesh. Again unhook quickly, quick pic, then back in the water.Quote: Originally Posted by new hipsSounds like a great trip, it sounds like you hit the perfect timing for the gators. Video to follow?????Thanks for sharing Lots of video bud, over 2 hours worth in fact. Havn't had a chance to look at it yet, but I know some of it is amazing. The water was crystal clear and the lighting was perfect!"
