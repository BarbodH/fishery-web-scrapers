3912978,Mark R,2015-05-28 09:30:00,1538,Did you keep the pike after pulling the eel pout out of it's stomach?
3913106,Mike Borger,2015-05-28 10:19:00,1554,"It was hanging half out of its mouth when I landed it. Wasn't hooked bad although I realize there's blood. I revived it and she swam away strong. Would have kept it if I knew for sure it wouldn't survive.It was totally disgusting, the ling was so decomposed the smell was unreal."
3913114,Mark R,2015-05-28 10:20:00,1538,maybe removing it did the pike a favor

Saturday was beautiful weather, we were fishing in t-shirts and getting sunburned. The bite was on too- the fish were a little deeper then normal and we had our best luck on the islands just outside of Sawmill. 12-15FOW was the key, we found some hard breaks from 2-12 feet off the islands and sandbars with mudbreaks were good all week. We had the best bite on minnows but did use leeches and when they got real frisky I was using gulp and doing very well. Slip bobbers, pitching jigs, vertical jigging and I did some drop shotting this year that did very well! We got to experience all seasons through the week, Sunday it was cold and rainy and Monday Snowed and froze our bay over! Tuesday-Thursday we had nice weather, 50-60 degrees and blue bird skies. It was a grind after the cold front and if we hadn't been fishing 8-10pm we would have had a tuff trip. The fish would turn on almost every evening at dusk and that's where we would get most of our fish. Biggest walleye was 26"", caught a lot of milting males. We lost a lower unit on one of our boats, the water is low so be careful out there boys. We caught northern while jigging but didn't get many when trying. Mouth of Sanctuary was consistently producing fish and islands on the outskirts of sawmill- spots deep in sawmill were no good this year. My brother caught a 29.5"" Burbot this year!!! We have never caught one or heard of one being caught, that was a first for us! It was very nice having Moose back in camp and Pat took care of us as always. Also was nice meeting fellow WC member MarkR! I'm ready to go back already."

3907202,Knoxabilly,2015-05-26 15:30:00,225,"I didn't know what the restrictions or anything were on them. As far as the bait shop knew, there was no limit on them. Wish we could have tried them"
3909106,bus33,2015-05-27 08:50:00,289,"We fish out of ear falls for the opener every year. Were you guys the two evergreen boats that always followed each other around the lake? We saw you everyday heading out. We nicknamed you Seal Team Six.....looked like seal boats heading out in formation everyday.. We did pretty well also. Weather was a bit unstable but, like you, found a good bite starting around 3pm. We did well at the mouth, goose, clay banks."
3910346,Knoxabilly,2015-05-27 15:56:00,225,"Yes that was us-Haha I love the nickname- Seal Team Six! I'll tell the boys! I felt we did very well for a cold front moving through. You guys get any big ones? Biggest in our group was 26""- nothing too special."
3910938,beckaj1973,2015-05-27 19:10:00,12,We are heading to Lac Seul on Saturday for the week and staying in Ear Falls at Gold Pines. Any advice for us? We typically spend most of our time in Sawmill Bay. Any other good spots other than the river mouth? Thanks!!!
3911098,Guest,2015-05-27 20:01:00,0,"We'll be in cabin 5 at Gold Pines starting Saturday also. Been wondering how fishing was this week and what we'll be coming into. Always been able to find fish and last year this same week was good. Caught 4 fish over 27"" between my dad and me. Beckaj1973, what cabin you guys staying in?"
3911450,beckaj1973,2015-05-27 21:17:00,12,It looks like we're going to be neighbors. We are in cabin 6. Stop by and we can swap some trade secrets!!
3912610,flntknp17,2015-05-28 08:03:00,151,Wow that water looks low.....I'm sorta uneasy about that....last year's high water was a blessing for us.....oh well....can't change it! Thanks for the report.....a month from today for me.
3912882,bus33,2015-05-28 08:54:00,289,I think our biggest was 26 also. We started getting nice keepers (17.5's) the last couple days. Also did pretty well getting northerns off wind blown points casting spoons. We were in a white alumacraft with a full windshield.
