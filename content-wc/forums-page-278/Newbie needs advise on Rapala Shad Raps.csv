1450773,v-bay gord,2012-06-18 14:17:00,3168,"Fred...here's a link to some walleye tips that will work on Eagle Lake. For the time of year you are coming your best bet might be the bottom bouncers with a crawler harness. The Viking Reef area will produce fish that time of year, and that is close to where I think you will be staying. Good luck.http://www.vermilionbaylodge.com/wal...hing-tips.html"
3914738,MoreHits32,2015-05-28 20:43:00,7,"If the walleyes are working in 10 to 12-feet of water, I'm pulling a #5 Shad Rap.(Blue-Silver or Firetiger color). When I get less than 8 feet I will use one of my favorite lure Ugly Duckling 7F (2 3/4"")."
3914874,reconssd,2015-05-28 21:19:00,147,"There's a walleye lure on the market that will BLOW rapala's right out of the water. I fished them for the first time a couple years ago. Bandit lures makes a shallow running and deep diving walleye lure. We had so many hits on the lure that I had to retire it because the fish knocked the snot out of it. Doesn't matter what color because it's all in the rattle. These baits have a rattle that will put fish in the boat. If you have to have a color the color to choose is called CLOWN. The color break down is a gold body with a red head. It's no longer available as its an old pattern. However, go to landbigfish.com and they have the clown lure color. The funny thing is I'm not a walleye fisherman. I'm a pike and muskie guy. When the pike turned off, we started trolling the bandits just to see what would happen. I lost track of all the big walleye's this lure put in the boat. I don't work for bandit and I don't work for landbigfish.com. Safe travels, tight lines, and get ready to get hoarse from saying ""fish on"" all the time."
3917137,muskyman73,2015-05-29 15:24:00,402,"I gotta admit, he's right, we catch alot of walleye on bandits, in crawdad patterns and the berkely frenzys in brown crawdad as well. We tie using snaps and throw everything on fireline, gotta throw that or some sorta braid. I find the way a walleye hits, non-stretch lines are the best, plus you get more baits back from drive by northerns. One thing is for sure, we throw alot of crankbaits and bettle spins too. Never had to resort to live bait."
1449762,Bozotheclown,2012-06-15 13:42:00,15,"First time to Canada.I will be fishing Eagle Lake.I would appreciate any and all tips if you use Shad Raps.For example,Techniques,sizes,colors and even tying the shad Rap to your line.Thanks to all!!!!!!!!"
1449819,v-bay gord,2012-06-15 16:17:00,3168,Bozo....I've sent you a p.m. I prefer Rapala Taildancers to the shad raps myself. Have also been experimenting with the Salmo Hornets......they seem to work well on Eagle too.
1449834,adempsey,2012-06-15 17:59:00,963,"I use sizes 5, 7 and 9. Mostly size 7 though.Colors - Firetiger, Silver, Gold, Perch, Purpledescent. Most of the colors are pretty good though.I always use a swivel. I mostly troll with them.Berkley Flicker Shads work well too.The Shallow ShadRaps are nice if you're casting over weedbeds.The X-Rap Shad also offers some more colors/finishes. I don't really think they perform any better though.If I use cranks for walleye in the summer, I almost certainly will troll 10-18 FOW with either Shad Raps, Flicker Shads or Storm Hot'n'Tots."
1449850,fishinnut 3446,2012-06-15 19:03:00,638,"Gord,does anyone ever troll with planner boards on Eagle?Bozo,I have been having better luck with the flicker shad,size 6 color has not seem to matter for me so far."
1449894,Manitou,2012-06-15 21:31:00,125,"Gold, silver and perch are my go to colours.I would not fish them without a leader up here.But then I'm still using monofilament and copolymer line."
1449911,RapShad,2012-06-15 23:08:00,76,"I'm a big fan of Shad Raps (duh). Almost all of my walleye and bass crankbaits are shad raps. We always bring at least 2 of every color (you never know when your buddy is going to get jealous of all the 30 inchers you are pulling up). Use the #7 in Firetiger (king of all colors), Chartreuse/White, clown, baby bass, perch, and copper. We use them from casting to shore for bass, to trolling, and also casting downstream in the current. Using a swivel is a good idea they tend to spin and cause a lot of twist while being casted. After a lot of use and bouncing off the rocks on the bottom they do tend to become off balance and will begin to favor one side of the other basically marking the end of their useful lives (another reason to have several of each color). They are one of the easiest and most simple lures to use, just a straight retrieve for the most part. Like most crankbaits I would stay away from using them in heavily weeded areas where they will get hung up constantly."
1449938,v-bay gord,2012-06-16 06:58:00,3168,I often use an ultralight with 6 pound mono trolling Taildancers....no leader and rarely get bit off. I think I catch more walleye without the leader. Planer boards? I've seen people use them.....not sure if they are more effective.
1449984,Bozotheclown,2012-06-16 09:52:00,15,Thanks for all the info.I especially thank Gord for his insights.Good luck to all this year!!
1450626,Jball,2012-06-18 10:00:00,23,"Just got back from Critchell lake - about 100 miles north of red lake. They were biting on almost everything until the cold front moved in and the temp dropped about 30 degrees, then everything went deep. I will note that I personally caught the most fish using rapala jointed shad raps. But after you catch 400+ fish you have a tendency to lose your lures A combination of hang ups and pike will thin you out pretty quickly. I have always been shy on using leaders. Although my friends were using them and caught plenty too. I also get tired of removing treble hooks from pike 100 times a day. After the front moved through we caught most everything else on .25 ounce jigs. We didn't use any live bait the whole week. 1 group of 5 guys fished 4 solid days and caught 400 + fish"
1450687,Guest,2012-06-18 12:09:00,0,"#7 Perch Shad Rap would be my first choice. Firetiger next. Any natural color after that. Maybe a few size 9s. Usually only use a snap to connect. The Pike usually have the lure in their mouth and the line does not get bit. I have leaders in the boat in case the Pike start stealing. Casting or trolling especially by rocky points and reefs. Use jigs in the weeds. I have never fished Eagle lake, but have fisher other parts of Ontario/Manitoba."
