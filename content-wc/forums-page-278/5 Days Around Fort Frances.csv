3921609,Zim3,2015-05-31 09:58:00,5,"Well I wanted to try this lake for old times sake but my suspicions were confirmed. Thought the eyes might be a little better since conservation practices began. I did not find this to be the case. Rented a boat and hit it Friday. Caught quite a few but all very tiny 10""-12"". Pretty sad to see. But not unexpected. Anyone know if there is commercial fishing still going on there? Or is the damage just done by all the easy access and lodges?"
3905554,Zim3,2015-05-26 07:53:00,5,"Hi, I am looking for suggestions on where I might spend 4 or 5 days, May 29-June2, fishing somewhere in southern Ontario. I am up here on a 3 week work trip inspecting post offices for repairs. My farthest north facility is Superior, Wisconsin so I thought I'd drive up. Used to fish up there often in the old days. I'll be alone, and did remember to bring my passport.Would like some place I can get a cheap hotel, and rent a boat. Priority is a nice experience & convenience. I don't need the greatest fishing, just reasonable. Maybe Rainy Lake, Nestor Falls, Kenora, Souix Lookout, Ear Falls? Any suggestions welcome. Thanks much."
3905826,ftfarms,2015-05-26 08:56:00,444,Try buena vista resort out of morson or mylies place. Thay may have something. Buena vista has motel rooms.
3905842,Bill Krejca,2015-05-26 08:58:00,6107,BV has a camping area also. Bill
3906738,Zim3,2015-05-26 13:14:00,5,"Ya after checking some prices for just one person it looks like it would be best just to camp. So I think a place with tent campground, nice showers, and boat rental is what I need."
3906802,wallydave,2015-05-26 13:32:00,2151,"http://www.lacseul.com/Goose Bay, near Ear Falls has 17ft Lunds, camping area and bathroom and showers for camping. Good luck!"
3914530,Zim3,2015-05-28 19:29:00,5,"Well I finished my work and drove on up to Int'l Falls. Making lots of calls with no luck so far. Both Mylie's & Buena Vista have all boats rented out. Called several other places - all rented out. Only one I found available so far is on Caliper Lake (near Nestor Falls), where I could camp at Provincial Park. But it looks like a really small lake, not sure what's in there."
3914594,Bill Krejca,2015-05-28 20:04:00,6107,"Caliper used to have some pretty good crappie fishing, believe there are some walleye and bass, pike. I haven't fished it, but just know about it (a little) from other folks. A pretty area. Bill"
3915082,Zim3,2015-05-29 04:50:00,5,Finally located a place with boat rentals available. Coppens Resort on east side of Rainy Lake. Could only find old reviews that mention walleye fishery not do good around there. But I'll give it a try Friday.
3915762,rockape,2015-05-29 08:09:00,215,"Call Greg at Northumbrianresort.com. He at least used to rent cabins by the day for rates less than most motels. He rents boats too, and the fishing in the area is great. Cabins are on Abram Lake and you can get to Minnitaki or Pelican as well."
3916474,Blackmacs,2015-05-29 11:31:00,2121,That area has great walleye fishing. I haven't fished in Red Gut in years but there are good spots off the reefs and islands in Swell Bay. That is the part of the lake to your right when going over the bridge at Bears Pass.
