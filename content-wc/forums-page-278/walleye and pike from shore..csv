3916154,emma17,2015-05-29 10:02:00,436,"Thanks for taking the time to share your videos. It's obvious that those on this board long for more time in NW Ontario and your videos (and videos from others as well) provide us with those ""ahh"" moments that mean so much. I don't know if you've shared before, but I'm interested to hear some of your story. England to a NW Ontario?"
3916170,tv4fish,2015-05-29 10:02:00,2694,Keep'em coming...............
3916242,Limeyangler,2015-05-29 10:17:00,563,"LOL why not, I'll keep it short. Born in Canada(Toronto) moved away to England in 1974, lived and went to school all over the world, returned to Canada in 2007 after a visit to my wife's uncle who vied in NWO. Loved it so much sold the house in England and moved here on a whim, we did not even have jobs to come to just a desire to live on the lake and enjoy the outdoors and raise a family away from the big cities of the world .so far so good lol."
3916506,emma17,2015-05-29 11:44:00,436,"Good for you and your family for taking the risk and breaking away from the pack. With one child in HS and two in college, I hear the call of the wild clearly. I use the excuse that I'll miss seeing the kids, however, at their ages, I don't see them anyway Until I can get the gumption to make it happen, I'll live vicariously through your videos and the 1 or 2 trips a year I'll make up your way God willing."
3917657,rnnonmt,2015-05-29 17:48:00,992,Thanks for sharing Limey. I always enjoy the videos! Ive been going to Lac Seul since 1982 at the young age of 10. love it
3918561,Limeyangler,2015-05-30 04:41:00,563,You up this year?
3919193,rnnonmt,2015-05-30 08:38:00,992,"Yep! We leave Phoenix AZ on the 9th at will be at Abrams Camp the 13th-19th and launching out of deception every day. Round trip is about 4000 miles and 80 hrs of drive time. Every trip is a great time! By the way... which model of gopro do you have and what recording settings do you use, Micro SD card size, battery run time, etc etc. My older son has a gopro 3 white and I might have to snag it from him but I think he only has one 64gb card and two batteries. Im wondering if I need to get another battery and micro sd card to get his camera to run all day on the boat."
3919305,Limeyangler,2015-05-30 09:15:00,563,"Wow..thats a long round trip! But worth it. I have a Gopro Hero 3 Black edition. I am using a 32Gb card at the moment but usually use a 64Gb. 64Gb will be plenty but I would bring a spare memory card just incase one gets damaged or craps out on you. I would get a couple of extra batteries, check out Ebay, they have great deals on brands like Wasabi that include 2 - 3 batteries and a charger for the price of one GoPro branded battery (about $20). Also check out the 'GoPro Battery BacPac'. A head mount or chest mount is what I would recommend, I prefer the head mount. I typically shoot in 1080p at 60fps setting. The lower resolutions will allow you to have higher fps so you can do slow motion if you want once you get to editing. If you intend on filming hours of footage I would recommend using the 'looping' feature .it is explained here in this link .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP6wRTZ9BLw Have a great trip, can't wait to see the video!"
3913562,Limeyangler,2015-05-28 12:46:00,563,"Hi all, Went back to one of my favourite shore spots for a morning stroll with walleye on my mind. Was kind of also making a comparison video for the video I made last year at the same place. Very different couple of hours from last year, but always fun with my partner and fish hound Roloff, and of course plenty of fish and wildlife to enjoy.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej5FlNScB6o"
3913618,Mike Borger,2015-05-28 13:01:00,1554,Very cool! I love the shots with Roloff - great stuff.
3913730,LoDo,2015-05-28 13:50:00,721,Are you using a GoPro with a head mount?
3913802,tv4fish,2015-05-28 14:14:00,2694,"Judging by his shadow - he for sure is using a head mount (AND, I would guess it IS a GoPro)VERY cool - Limey....... I think your dog knows that shoreline as well as you do......"
3913938,PBsQuest,2015-05-28 14:39:00,49,I love your videos. Makes me wish for August to get here much quicker.
3914106,turtle chain,2015-05-28 16:28:00,1398,good fun
3914210,Draco1206,2015-05-28 17:01:00,175,Love your videos. Fishing with your dog and son. They make my day. You're are a lucky guy.
3914226,Carnhzkr,2015-05-28 17:15:00,964,"Roloff is one lucky dog. If I was a Lab, I would want to live in NW Ontario."
3914370,LoDo,2015-05-28 18:28:00,721,"August trip this year for me too! Usually a late May, early June trip for our group, but we decided to switch it up this year. The pro is we'll fish Aug 2015 and early June 2016, which means only 9-10 months between trips. Do you fish Aug most years? What should we expect? I'll be west of Red Lake 50miles."
3916026,Limeyangler,2015-05-29 09:21:00,563,"Guys .YOU ARE TOO GENEROUS! Thanks for the feedback on my videos. I have been making them for just about every trip I make out since we moved to canada from England. I hesitated for a while posting here as I was not sure if it was appropriate or not, well .no mods have told me not to and I keep it to walleye related videos only but if you like them PM me and I'll show you how to access all the vids of a slice of life in NWO! Simon(AKA 'Limey')Thanks Mike, always loving your vids too, can't wait for the next one. I subbed your youtube channel so I get the first previewsQuote: Originally Posted by LoDoAre you using a GoPro with a head mount?Yup, its a Gopro with a head mount. I used to just hold a point and shoot, but the go pro is better quality and having hands free is a bonus too, I used to break a lot of cameras!!!Quote: Originally Posted by tv4fishJudging by his shadow - he for sure is using a head mount (AND, I would guess it IS a GoPro) VERY cool - Limey....... I think your dog knows that shoreline as well as you do......LOL you should be a detective if you are not already! Roloff definitely knows tha shoreline well, we go there lots, very relaxing when no other anglers are there.Quote: Originally Posted by PBsQuestI love your videos. Makes me wish for August to get here much quicker.And I really appreciate your comment, makes my day when people say they like my creations, mind you I have easy material to work with living where I do .I just hold the camera .Northwest Ontario does the rest! HAVE A BLAST IN AUGUST great time to fish BIG walleye on deep structure!Quote: Originally Posted by turtle chaingood funOH YEAH! Quote: Originally Posted by Draco1206Love your videos.

You're are a lucky guy.Thanks Draco, as soon as I get my boat up and running and school is out there will be a ton more father/son videos, my boy is bugging me daily about returning to lac Seul!!Quote: Originally Posted by CarnhzkrRoloff is one lucky dog.
