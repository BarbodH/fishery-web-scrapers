There seems to be very little feedback from the past few years, and some of the things I found were rather negative toward the lodge. I don't want to book a trip based on reviews from 10 years ago .... does anyone have any more recent info they could share? Specifically, we are interested in staying at one of the outpost cabins."

The negatives that you have read have probably had nothing to do with the fishing which keeps us returning annually (usually two trips per year). The outfitter has recently taken measures to protect him from property damage, particularly his motors, specifically prop damage. We have never experienced such issues mainly because we take ordinary caution when traversing rocky areas. Many visitors now bring their own boats, eliminating the possibility of such issues. Personally, I am satisfied with the equipment and hesitate to drag my rig up the Clova Road but, like I mentioned, many do. That being said, the fishing can be great for walleyes (numbers and size) and pike (same). Everyone in our current party has landed (and released) 20+ lb northerns. Recently we have devoted more fishing time to catching lake trout which are underfished and offer the real potential of landing a 30+ lb fish. The facilities are comfortable and include hot water, flush toilets, propane stoves and electric refrigerators. New for 2013 will be solar power so that you will not be hearing the constant sound of a diesel generator. The only outpost that I would endorse is the main lake outpost (Southern Outpost) which is new and only slightly less amenable than the main lodge cabins. You can access the main lake from there with ease while maintaining seclusion and privacy. The other outpost facilities are only occasionally occupied and are for the hard core anglers only, in my opinion. We spend so little time in the cabins that privacy and seclusion are not a big consideration. Otherwise, OSLL offers a great experience and we are already looking forward to returning next summer."
