Along with finding the 'eyes, I hope to spend significant time chasing lakers. I see that Dryden is only 50 degrees (F) at the moment. Does anyone have a report on water temps? Have the lakes started to cool some? Any signs of the lakers beginning to move a bit shallower?TIA for any info."
1484501,v-bay gord,2012-09-08 15:49:00,3168,Jay....I believe the temps are in the lower 60's as of a few days ago. I had guests have some great trout and whitefish fishing this past week......mostly in deep water but the last trip produced some (all males) in shallower ...30 feet. I suspect that a spawn may be imminent. Talked to someone today who caught a whitefish in 15 ft on Perrault lake....it was full of spawn.
1484502,stillangling,2012-09-08 15:50:00,149,Lake of the Woods is currently sitting at 66F. Hope this link works. I use it all of the time. http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/marine/weatherConditions-currentConditions_e.html?mapID=09&siteID=08100&sta tionID=4514814 day temperature forecast is calling for above normal temps out to Sept 22. LOW area is normally the warmest portion of NW Ontario but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the lake trout to move up shallow before the season closes this year in the Perrault Falls area...unless things really turn around here quick. They really seem to go on the feed bag at this time of year anyhow but expect them to be deep.

1484547,JayM5209,2012-09-08 19:28:00,1050,"Thanks guys! That's helpful info. I'll be sure to pack the jigging box with my laker jigs, jigging spoons, and big blade baits along with the favorite trolling spoons, sticks and, of course, the Canadian Wigglers and Flatfish!My boat releases all the big girls, but a smaller male or two for the table will be a real treat (Note of optimism here).Gord, a PM coming your way."
