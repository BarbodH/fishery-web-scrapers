1486021,new hips,2012-09-13 08:23:00,498,"Trip Report / Beteau September 1 2012 Myself and my two boys arrived in Nakina the night before flying out Saturday morning for our Attawapiskat adventure. We were to be at Nakina Air by 7:00 but when arriving told to come back at 8:30, so back to town for a much needed breakfast. The process went smooth, and were in the air around 9:30 for our 1.5 hour flight. We had a beautiful day with temps in the low 70's and light winds. Before we knew it we landed, and greeted by Eddie, who unfortunately was leaving for the week to get his Moose tags. Water levels were down, I would say 4-5 feet, leaving most bays unfishable. The gnats were bad, on land and on the water, especially if no wind was present. I was fortunate to get a map from Walleye Wanderer (Thanks' Rob) + help from Solopaddler two great assets to this forum. I actually got to meet Rob .he was coming in for the week after us, with a couple of his friends /hunting fishing. Can't wait to hear how he does, take his advice on quality leaders and snaps with a 11in needle nose which proved invaluable for the week. The boats and motors were great, we used a 16ft with Mercury engine ..good seats and very comfortable. We were out fishing within a hour or two, we casted some current breaks and points, about 3 hours in I popped my first 40in on a Â¾ oz spinner bait ..great start ! Beteau, is not a numbers lake (I knew that) but once you find walleye, you can load up in a hurry. Two guys from Chicago area found a pocket of walleye and called us over and we fished with plastics for a hour or two (Thanks Tim & Mike) with a 26in in the mix with all year classes. We were in 8ft of water with gravel, fun day. Day 2 produced another 41in for me, using a hard body swim bait (for the life of me can't remember the name of) I thought Rapala made it I believe is discontinued, this was my go to lure all week. Day 3 produced a few in the low 30in, probably our worst day. Day 4 we popped two 39in and found a walleye hotspot, by accident. Day 5 was the best 26.5in walleye on a spinner bait and a 43in Northern on my lucky swimbait. Lots of walleye .mostly big (probably 20in average) on jigs using 5in flukes in silver. In a one hour window in the same inside turn we got the 43,39,38,35 .Wow !!!!!! Day 6 a cold front hit shutting down a lot of action, still got a 38,35,30 and only small walleye. Met with Tim & Mike and did a shore lunch, towards evening winds settled down and was quite nice. Got some eater walleye near camp and popped a 37in before calling it quits. Day 7 was cold with 39 degrees for a low, the day started with plenty of wind and cold temps, we put on all the clothes we had. I was not to optimistic for the day. Tim got a 45in in the back bay near camp, so my hopes picked up. We got on the water kind of late (as we were in no hurry) For the day we had a 39,38 & 4 in the low 30's, walleyes were limited but got some big ones again. Conclusion: Met all my expectations, only went there for Trophy Northern Low water long stretches of 4ft or less Good locater a must, for watching depth at all times. All big fish came from 3-4 feet never deeper than six. For the week, we found maybe 4-5 good spots. Great wildlife, we saw 3 bear cubs, beavers, otter families, eagles, geese, flocks of ducks, Tim spotted a cow Moose Very physically demanding for the week, thank goodness my two boys did all the heavy work.
