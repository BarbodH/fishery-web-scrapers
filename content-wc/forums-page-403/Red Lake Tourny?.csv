1482707,HighTech,2012-09-04 07:03:00,75,"Same situation here. We were in the west end fishing about 25 feet. Day one picked up only one over. Day two we found excellent unders 17 3/4 inch fish in 15 feet. Picked up five unders but they were bitting very light and took a lot of patience to let them ""get on"". Fished 20 to 30 for big fish the rest of the day,had two heavy hits on for about 10 cranks then lost them. (I think they were walleye but i,m an optimistic fisherman !!!!) I don't want to start a debate, but overall the fishery is down a bit from a few years back, but the fish we caught were all healthy and fairly fat. No idea where we ended up as had to leave early sunday after ending. (I do know we were not first!!)"
1482722,Mondo,2012-09-04 07:51:00,61,"We had a great time too. My son and I really enjoyed ourselves and a special thanks to Five Lakes Lodge for their accommodations, too. Overall, a very successfully run event by the Red Lake Classic board. Our day 1 ended with 12.09 pounds from the West end with a couple of overs (21"" and 23""). We stayed away from Pipestone, but managed to catch most of our fish in 16-25 fow. Basically, we emptied our tackle boxes to trigger a bite. Just had to work for them and never really established a pattern of consistency. Day 2 was tougher for us where we had nice slot fish 7.17 pounds, but couldn't get anything big to bite. We couldn't squeeze our 20 3/4"" walleyes to measure up to 21"". Darn! Weather was interesting (other than a bit of lightening from the distance in the early am) and thought the chop was perfect for fishing conditions. Hooked into some nice pike, tho. Them toothy critters always get the heart beating ~ thinking you've just hooked into a 27"" eye until you quickly realize its a D@5$ pike again. Oh well, that's why they call it fishing and not catching!"

1486171,Golden Eagle,2012-09-13 14:58:00,2642,X 2. Saw two float planes that have taken me to good fishing.
1486265,Skywagon,2012-09-13 19:34:00,1106,"My boat was in that picture Connie (don't ask me which one), lent it to friends fishing the tourney."
1486276,Golden Eagle,2012-09-13 20:00:00,2642,Were they FIBS?
1486342,Skywagon,2012-09-14 05:10:00,1106,"No, Dryden guys I fish with all the time. My livewell is larger than that in their boat, better for keeping fish alive."
1482284,Limeyangler,2012-09-02 19:52:00,563,Anyone know where i can get info? Results for this year?
1482298,tackleman,2012-09-02 20:30:00,444,the winners are Terry Feriancek and Pat Wagner with a 10 fish weight of 27.71 poundsSecond went to Lloyd Gillis and Angie Fryklund with 27.15 pounds
1482307,Pikeslayer8,2012-09-02 20:59:00,1460,"How did it go for you, Bill? Any good stories?"
1482338,Skywagon,2012-09-03 05:38:00,1106,"I had looked everywhere for results also, they never bothered to put them on the Fall Classic site. Someone dropped the ball on that one."
1482341,JDP,2012-09-03 05:47:00,1457,"I don't understand it either, hopefully just delayed a bit..."
1482411,Limeyangler,2012-09-03 09:07:00,563,"Not the first time it's been slow on coverage, frustrating, I would think it would be more than frustrating if I was a sponsor!"
1482510,NWwalleye,2012-09-03 13:19:00,223,"Or a participant , that wants to know were he/she placed after final day !!!!! I had to leave and didn't stop by the legion for final results .."
1482566,tackleman,2012-09-03 16:54:00,444,"this year i fished with my son Pat and he put on a lesson for me, I couldn't get a big fish to save my soul but pat came through and he put the 2 big ones we weighed in but we still finished 72 but that was up 50 spots from last years tournament.Everyone i talked to on day one said they had a tought time finding the fish and the weather was great, hardly a ripple on the lake and it got hot and sunny during the day. Everyone i talked to told me they were fishing 30 feet of water and off the points and humps in the west end of the lake.another friend of mine told me he was doing the complete opposite of the others and he put in 9.6 pounds the first day. he was fishing 8 feet of water and on the rocks. Day 2 the top team on day 1 finished in 18th place and my friend moved from 55th to 2nd. he posted 17.46 pounds and took home a pile of loot as well as prizes for biggest fish on day 2, top mixed team, best weight day 2, so i guess 8 feet can be just as productive as any other spot on the lake. just gotta be the right spot at the right time."
1482573,Pikeslayer8,2012-09-03 17:11:00,1460,"What could be better than fishing the big tourney with your son. And you are right, ya just gotta be the right spot at the right time and have the good fortune of a few big mamas willing to bite. Way to go finishing 50 spots better! Let Linda know some fabric is headed her way."
1482623,NWwalleye,2012-09-03 19:26:00,223,"Tackleman..What was your weight ? I could possibly figure out were I placed, if I knew your weight ..If , I remeber right my weight was 17.42 lbs.My partner and I had the same problem, as you and your son. Only 2 over slot fish for the tourney. We also had a 16 ounce penalty on day one, as a result of a stressed fish penalty ..Still a great time and we will be back in 2013 looking for top spot honours ..Till next year..."
