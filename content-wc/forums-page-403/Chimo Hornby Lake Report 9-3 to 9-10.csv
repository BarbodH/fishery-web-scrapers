Hornby Lake is approximately 100 miles North of Red Lake. The flight was smooth and on time. The cabin, boats and motors were in good shape but being one of the last groups of the season the props were pretty beaten up LOL. The weather for the week was cool with a few pretty windy days thrown in. Weather fronts were moving in and out regularly with spotty rain all week. The walleye fishing was good with the sizes ranging from 15"" t0 24.5"" with many 17"" to 21"" fish being caught. The majority of the fish came out of 18' to 28' FOW which were taken on jigs. They were primarily on the drop offs leading into deeper water. They were predominantly on the windy points and wind side of Islands and reefs. Northerns were caught but nothing of any size to mention. We did have a pack of wolves close to camp serenading us at night. Overall it was a great trip, with great friends. We are truly blessed.P.S Thank you DaveKin for all your help in making our trips a success. The selfless giving of your time along with sharing your incredible knowledge of those lakes is truly appreciated by us all. It was great spending time with you and your group in Red Lake and on the Float Plane. Again Thank you very much!!!!P.P.S. Mr. Krejca your salted minnow recipe is the best one I have ever used bar none!!! Thank you very much!!!!Thank you,Larry Mac"
