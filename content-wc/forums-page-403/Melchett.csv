Stayed at Wawa Motor Inn one night (OPP had a roadblock set up just before we got there looking for open containers). First time staying there, it was really nice. Stayed in Nakina the next night, can't remeber the place, but it was just across from the air-strip.Had a couple hour delay due to fog going out on Friday, although we were out fishing by 10:30.Windy and rainy the first few days, although the fishing was great. Caught a lot of walleyes. Consistantly caught larger (about 24-26 IN)WE's on the north side of the point in front of the cabin. Excellent fishing as usual at the fuel dump. Kind of slow on the Melchett side of the river to Kap, although it was great on the Kap side of the river mouth. Caught quite a few off the point in Kap across of the cabin on the beach.Weather improved the last couple of days and the fishing slowed a bit. By slow I mean it took us until 11:00 to catch out dinner rather than 9:30.Picked us up early on 8/24 and we were packed and on the road by 8:00. Not issues coming back other than the they were pulling every fisherman over on the Canada side and going through their stuff. We didn't bring any fish back so no issues.Another great trip!"

We managed to get to melchette via the south pass if i remember correctly, but was a little hairy entering and exiting stream. What a beautiful place. Could drop me off in may and pick me up end of sept....just airmail some blues every now and again!"
1482799,flipdip,2012-09-04 12:08:00,27,"water levels seemed to be down a little from the last few trips we've made. The south branch of the river was challenging to get through (there's a big rock in the middle of the river in a place you wouldn't expect, a couple of us hit it).on the north branch, the mouth on the Kap side was nearly impossible to get through. We had to raise the motor out of the water and try to float through."
1484078,dog2,2012-09-07 09:52:00,198,"we were in kap onaug25 sept1 could not use west side passage at all could not float a boat thru.looked like a rock dam . we walked half the way across on the rocks then i didn't feel i could make the leap to the next exposed rock with out getting wet feet. the east or north side the rock in the middle was shining above the water level by 2 in, or so. there seemed to be a small school of eyes in the rocks at both outlets ."
1484137,flipdip,2012-09-07 11:47:00,27,"Can't believe i forgot this on the original post. Couple of cools things happened on this trip.I caught the first fish on the trip about 3 seconds after my line was in the water. That's a new record! We were fishing Melchett side mouth of the river to Kap. Just put a crawler on my jig and plopped it over the side into the water. Leaned over to clean my fingers in the lake and bam...fish on!Seen this before, but it's alway cool....had a Northern hammer a walleye I had hooked. About landed both of them, but the Northern let go.Had a northern to the boat and he broke my line. About half an hour later, had a northern again. Landed him this time and he still had my other jig in his mouth. Caught the same fish twice! First time i've done that."
