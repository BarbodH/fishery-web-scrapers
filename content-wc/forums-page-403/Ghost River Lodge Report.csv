Fishing overall was quite good with a couple of slower half days when the wind was down to nothing. We don't keep track of numbers of fish caught but I would guess my son and I averaged 60-70 fish per day with a couple of days not quite at those numbers.Lots of eaters and smaller fish but we caught more over 20 inches this year than in the past few years. I attribute this to tne full moon we had the day before we boated in. The last morning John's first 2 fish of the day were 23 1/2 inches in the first 15-20 minutes of fishing. We guessed we caught 8-10 over 20 inches the last day of our trip.The service by Darrell and Don was excellent as usual. Our boats were tied to the dock, cleaned out and minnows in buckets by 6:30 or 7 each morning. They were there if you needed something but left you alone if you didn't.Overall a very good trip as usual.wmd"
