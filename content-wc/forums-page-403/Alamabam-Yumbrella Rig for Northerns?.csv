Not that I would necessarily pay $25+ for a single ""lure"", but I am just curious about your thoughts and if anyone has even tried.For reference: http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Yum_Y...page-YYBR.html"
1486490,Hillbiehle,2012-09-14 11:34:00,66,"They can and are very destructive to the fish. The bigger the fish, the more hooks that will embedded in the sides of the fish. With the fight that a northern can put up, it would be a sad scene. I'm sure they would work, but you'd have a very injured fish as a result I do no recommend."
1486527,5richards,2012-09-14 12:53:00,131,I second Hillbiehle -- Please don't use that on pike or any game fish you intend to release unharmed.
1486528,rocko0305,2012-09-14 12:55:00,138,"Like I said, I don't plan on using it. Just wondering if anyone has."
1486541,Hillbiehle,2012-09-14 13:08:00,66,"I do think they would work especially since you would be using heavy enough gear to throw. They are pretty amazing contraptions, but they are more suited for stocking the freezer IMO. But as mentioned, it would be a mess and rather sad scene."
1486673,Hawker,2012-09-15 05:31:00,3967,"I took one up this past Spring (end of May) with the intent of fishing for Pike with it and did quite well actually! I had no (zero) incidents of double hooking or multiple hooks imbedding the fish! I primarily used two different ""baits"" on the U-Rigs, neither of which had open exposed hooks though. I fished with super flukes using the shank weighted hooks and rigged them like you would a Texas rigged plastic worm with the hook point skin hooked to make them weedless! I also fished the U-Rig with 1/4 oz Johnson Silver Minnows (weedless) with good success, and again, no foul hooking or damaged fish, though I did catch several 35+ inch Pike that would have two baits in their mouth and as far as I can tell did no damage or less damage than hooking with a crankbait with multiple treble hooks!! Caught several really nice Smallies, more than a dozen ""really"" nice Eyes and two surprise muskies while fishing the U-Rig for Pike!To each his own, but rigged with baits like I used, it was a fun and different style of fishing for me and we left them none the less for wear!"
1486949,Mojo-NC,2012-09-16 09:51:00,1929,"If you decide to use an Alabama Rig in Ontario, make sure not to fully load it with all 5 baits containing hooks. Ontario only allows a max of 4 hooks on a single line; therefore, one will have to be a dummy. I agree there is the potential for damaged fish using this rig, but it also depends on the types of baits you are using. Flukes or other similar rigs without exposed hooks will greatly reduce the damage. They definitely work!"
