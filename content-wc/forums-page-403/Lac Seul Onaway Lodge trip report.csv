1486035,SinOrSwim,2012-09-13 09:17:00,1528,"Trip Report Lac SeulSpent 4 days fishing Lac Seul out of Onaway Lodge. This was our second year at Onaway and I can't imagine a camp being nicer? Cabins are all almost brand new the boats are fantastic. 1750's with 50hp 4 stroke Hondas. My GPS had us going 28mph with two rather large guys.Love the fact there is an ice machine in the fish house to ice our beer and they supply the coolers to put dead fish in so we don't have to skank up our own coolers. Fish house is awesome with a slotted floor so you can just dump your ice and let it go. Fishing: Was very slow. Again, this is only our second year and we had a couple half days where the fishing was really pretty good. We had 5 boats in our group and had mornings where in a 3 hour period a boat would catch 20 to 30 decent walleye. The problem was it would shut off just as fast and we would go 3 hours with very little to nothing. Biggest walleye were a couple 26's and a couple 25's. Many in the group then followed with 24, 23 and 22. We had one morning fishing by Manitoba where almost everything caught was above 18. Had one morning we went to the south inlet. Thought we were in for a great day when in the first 10 to 15 minutes, I had a 17.5 in the cooler and another 18.5 I let go. Then followed in the next 15 minutes with another 4 smaller walleye in about the 11 to 14 range. After that, it completely shut off and nothing. Fished our way out of the inlet and into South Bay with very little. One 26 Northern was about it. Bay of Islands was one of our better spots as far as consistency. That is where a 26 and 25 came from and many more in the 19-22 range. But, very very spotty. Talked to others in camp who experienced the same thing. One group had been coming for 12 years and another about 9 years and they said they had a couple days this trip where it was slower than they had ever seen. Said they fished Cedar Island and didn't catch a thing for over 2 hours. Finally left and went to Manitoba. Caught one or two small fish and left. Only negative about the trip was we went with 11 guys and that is a lot of people to clean fish and cook for. We had many older guys who had never been and really didn't know what to do. The great part was some of them caught some really nice fish so they had an absolute blast. Oh, and experienced both the issues discussed on here many times. We had 5 boats fishing a couple islands and boom .2 more boats fishing along side. One at least was around the corner but the other started jigging at the end of where we were trolling back and forth. Had this happen in Bay of Islands as well. Had all 5 boats fishing an area along a shoreline and wasn't 10 minutes and another boat joined us???????? Also had a day we were fishing a shoreline in about 20-30 ft of water and 3 boats from another camp went ZOOMING by between us and the shore????????? All in all a great trip but the fishing was a little slower than we thought. It was either ON or OFF. No in between it didn't seem. And some advice: don't be the guy who sits around while all the fish are being cleaned and cooked and complain about when we eat or how long it takes. Don't be the guy who make the comment about how amazing it is the mosquitoes are non-existent but the guys cooking the fish at dusk are outside getting eaten alive. Or, how shore lunch just takes up too much time. Maybe if others would help carry equipment, clean fish , cook fish and then clean up it would go a little faster. Now the countdown begins for next year's trip to Onaway! Love that place.Oh, and we were the people trying to get the satellite to work. Didn't happen. But, can't say enough nice things about the owner Blair for helping us try. I just don't think we had a good enough line of sight. We finally got a couple numbers on sat 101 on a couple transponders but no matter what we did couldn't get any more? I think the trees were just too high. We tried our best though!"
1486062,Pikeslayer8,2012-09-13 10:25:00,1460,"Glad that you guys had a good trip. Sounds like you hit a tough week for the bite. Too bad for the first timers not to experience what it like in God's country with a hot bite. Very distressing to keep hearing of all the bad form that fishermen are using when fishing Lac Seul. For the short of time you were there, to have 3 instances of rude or clueless behavior just sucks. Inexcusable really. Sounds like you had a few guys not fully understanding the program in fishcamp. Were they wanting a catered event for them, or what? Just makes things a lot tougher on the fellas doing the work. Nothing worse than a complainer in camp. Yup, don't be that guy! You didn't miss much with the Iowa game. Ferentz was badly out coached and Iowa St. laid the lumber to the Hawkeyes. Game wasn't as close as the score indicated. Gonna be a long year for the Hawks. How were the fish tacos this trip?"
1486069,orchard frank,2012-09-13 10:41:00,1900,"Been on a lot of trips with various size groups. With newer people around, don't be reluctant to be the ""wagonmaster"", suggesting to them what to do. Often new guys may think you want to do it yourself, or that they don't know enough to help. Actual lazy guys or complainers just don't make the cut the next time."
1486076,wallydave,2012-09-13 10:51:00,2151,"Putting a group together that can work together is an art form! The whiners and the watchers, can make for a long trip! When you can find the right bunch, trips North can be great, even when the fishing isn't! It is always a good thing to bring a newbie along, even better when they step up and help out around the cabin. If they do more whining than helping it might be time to ""forget"" to invite them for the next trip!Oh yea, thanks for the report! Onaway is a place I have often wondered about, closer to some different spots on LS than the Ear Falls area, that I would like to try one day! The whole boating/fishing manners thing is part of the LS experience I for one could do without!"
1486097,SinOrSwim,2012-09-13 11:24:00,1528,"For me it's not a matter of whether they actually do much but the offer to help. Sort of like when someone offers to pay for something but we had no intention of taking their money anyway.I actually got a kick out of the people being inconsiderate just since it had been talked about so much. Still amazed me people would move in on 5 boats, all from the same lodge so it was obvious we were together?Still a fun trip regardless and even though we had some people who ddin't do much (some of that is/was age related if ya know what I mean lol) we enjoyed the trip. Got some fish, played some poker, drank some beer and spent 4 days with family and friends. P.S. Oh, and one other bad thing. Many of the guys we took were a little ""older"" so we were limited in boat drivers so I didn't get to fish in the same boat with my brothers which is always disappointing. But, we pretty much knew that before we left. P.S.S If someone wants to send me precise GPS coordinates of those **** sunken humps by Mantiba Point, I would take them. LOLOL I could NOT find those darn things. doh!"
1486195,rommel,2012-09-13 16:08:00,369,sounds like all in all it was a good trip. were heading up to onaway next july. never been to lac seul. hopefully we have a good trip also
1486330,MorganMan,2012-09-13 23:19:00,341,Saved the fish tacos for the last shore lunch and didn't stop as we really didn't have enough fish kept by lunch to have that and actually send a fish home with those that wanted em. We did make a version as appetizer that night before dinner though! Great eats!
1487094,NWwalleye,2012-09-16 19:19:00,223,Anytime .... Maybe next year we could hook up for a drinks and share some fishing stories ..
1487108,SinOrSwim,2012-09-16 20:24:00,1528,Absolutely!!!
1487582,Steve of Madison,2012-09-17 22:04:00,230,"SIN, you have a private message"
1486681,NWwalleye,2012-09-15 07:02:00,223,"SinOrSwim ...You were supposed to get in touch with me .. I could have helped out with that satellite problem .. I was guiding on Lac Seul Sept 10th - 13th .. Fishing was slower for sure. But that is Fall Walleye fishing .. My Walleye fishing was a hunt and peck system .. Fished the central basin, marked tons of fish in the 22 - 32 fow ..Caugh several in the 22 - 26 "" range with quite a few eating size mixed in .. Just had to be patient and wait them out .. When they completely shut down in that spot move to another ( hunt & peck )..."
1486803,SinOrSwim,2012-09-15 16:49:00,1528,"I know, and I probably should have. I appreciate it! However, we tested the system here and everything worked fine. We couldn't get any signal up there and then moved the dish as far as we possibly could away from cabin to get the best line of sight. We got a couple numbers on two transponders but that was it. I'm almost positive we just couldn't get over the trees. We had an app on our phones where we could point to the sky and find the satellites. We also had a compass and saw where the main lodge's dish was pointing and got their coordinates. Theirs was up on top of their chimney so we were quite a long distance lower than that. Yes, very hit and miss. We did move a lot. We did okay just not a ton. Had a couple times where it got very slow and there was no wind. We actually did better by just letting it sit on the bottom and barely moving it. The tough part is when it's slow we tend to go back to spots we have fished before. But, since we have only fished LS twice we don't have a ton of those spots so trying new ones we just never know if it's the bite or where we are. Creatures of habit I guess. Still a fun trip. Always is."
1487044,Hawkfan,2012-09-16 16:23:00,237,"I actually went to get on here and look you up, but at that point I wasn't getting a wifi signal and then went out to fish and had given up on it by the time we got back. But like he said, I think it was more of a line of sight issue than anything. Thanks for the offer again, we really do appreciate it."
