1480262,Jaskonie,2012-08-27 20:07:00,80,Headed up September 20th and staying at Camp Lochalsh with the Wilsons. Hows the fishing in the fall in this area of Ontario? Thanks guys.

We've been fishing this lake, this time of year for about 5 years and to this lake for about 15 years (spring and summer trips). It's always been fairly productive. Of course most of that time was spent on the north side of the lake, so we'll have to see if the normal spring and summer spots (Snag point, Twin Rocks, etc...) on the south side are productive in the fall....And I'm sure that Andy will help get us to the right places. We'll see you up there!"
