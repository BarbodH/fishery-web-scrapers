Myself and a buddy would like to tag along with a larger group to Beteau in 2013. I am a serous Pike fisherman who has been to Kesagami as well as fly-in lakes out of Nakina,Hornpayne and Cochrane. Anyway if anyone would be interesting in letting two guys join their group next summer send me an e-mail at [email protected] or shoot me a text on my phone at 586-337-1718."
1484807,pike50plus,2012-09-09 20:35:00,584,The camp has 3 cabins and depending on how many are there Eddie may let you go as 2. We did that in 2011.
1484819,Mike Borger,2012-09-09 20:56:00,1554,"Exactly, I don't see two being a problem."
1484868,wallydave,2012-09-10 06:56:00,2151,Be sure and check with Eddie! He is very good about responding to e-mail questions! I have exchanged several e-mails with him anout putting a trip together. Good luck! Be sure and let us know how your trip went!
1485295,lionfan19,2012-09-11 08:16:00,41,Eddie saw my post like two hours after I put it up here. I am booked for the first week in June next year. He was able to slip us in with a larger group. I can't wait.
1485373,GOBIG,2012-09-11 11:32:00,126,Eddie is the best. Save some fish.
1485774,rocko0305,2012-09-12 14:00:00,138,"That's great news. I will see you when you get off the plane, as we will be there the week of May 25 - June 1! (Group of 12)"
1485816,deputy dog,2012-09-12 15:52:00,305,"And I will see you Rocco when you get off as I will be heading out, we are going ice out, may 18-25!"
1486237,boelter21,2012-09-13 18:25:00,10,Ill be up with our group the first week of june!
1486456,rocko0305,2012-09-14 10:16:00,138,"Nice to hear. Have you gone the first week after ice out at Eddie's before? If you would care to share anything about your past successes or trip reports, please feel free to PM me. I would love to hear, and pass along even more info to our group than I already have. Our group has been going out of Leuenberger's for the past 20 years or so. Out of our group of 12, there will be 6 guys going for the first time on any sort of fly-in trip, so they have no idea that they are going to the crown jewel compared to other locales."
