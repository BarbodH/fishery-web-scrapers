1488670,bigdaddyguns,2012-09-21 06:36:00,608,"Now as the ""soft"" water season winds down, I have a question for the folks who have been fishing for several years up north. What impact, if any, did the early ice out have on your fishing this season? My guess is early season was different as I assume the spawn was also early and so was the migration back to the main lake. We did our first trip this year in mid-summer so I don't have any experience to compare against but by then we found the walleyes at the typical reef, main lake points, and weed edge locations with a good bite. Just wondering if anyone had any different experiences that they might attribute to the unusually early ice out."

1488818,campchick,2012-09-21 11:52:00,96,"We saw an earlier mayfly hatch but all in all it was a ""normal"" pattern. No major differences than other years. Low lake levels were a concern early in the spring but frequent rains fixed that. Trees have been shedding their leaves for a couple of weeks now, so that is normal too. Geese and cranes have been heading south for a few weeks now. Not much for ducks yet."
1488888,Glenman12,2012-09-21 15:08:00,762,We had water temps several degrees warmer than we are used to seeing in mid June..still caught lots of fish but several of our hot spots didnt produce like years past..had to do some runnning to find them elsewhere..
1488922,Obabikon,2012-09-21 17:41:00,2370,"I don't think it's fair to compare this summer to early ice out. The record breaking summer heat had much more to do with summer fishing than did an early ice out. Early ice outs affect spawns, but once those happen shouldn't change much."
1488926,Knoxabilly,2012-09-21 18:08:00,225,"I went opening week- most my spots didn't produce. Fish were not schooled up like usual. Really had to work for them, catch a few and move."
