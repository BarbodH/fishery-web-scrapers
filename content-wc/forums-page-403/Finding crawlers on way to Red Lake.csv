1485680,J Arendt,2012-09-12 08:08:00,45,"Hey guys looking for some help. I called four seasons bait in Ear Falls looking for crawlers, none to be had. Going thru Friday am Fort Franny then east to hwy 71 then north. Any help would be appreciated."
1485694,mdsn,2012-09-12 09:00:00,121,"Yes, crawlers and leeches are done for the year. Last week we went through Fort Francis and bought a flat at Rainy River Sports. We put the flat, still sealed right into the cooler.We got to Lac Seul 4 hours later only to find better than 80% dead and the rest dying. Yes we should have opened the flat before we left the store, I take that responsibility...but then again Rainy River sports should be caring for the bait they sell. That's just bad business.Its not only the $62 we lost but more important we had none of the bait we wanted! 4 Seasons was out already too.After that experience I have heard a few bad stories about Rainy River sports, we will never stop there again"
1485707,NathanH,2012-09-12 09:35:00,697,Maybe Contact Vados Bait. I got my crawlers from them this year and they had great quality and were well packed. I think they ship if you wont be in the Metro Mn area.
1485721,port1042,2012-09-12 10:28:00,509,I got crawlers and leeches 2 weeks ago at Anglers Pro Shop on Hwy. 71 in Nester Falls. They have a web site where you can order on-line. They advised me when I ordered that leeches may not be avaliable -- but I got them and they were in very good shape. We also got a half flat of very nice crawlers which were well packaged.I'd recommend you try them. (I'd also recommend using this the Hwy. 71 route. We drove up 71 and returned on 502. I'll use 71 from now on.)Good luck!
1485791,Mike Kansas,2012-09-12 14:46:00,1463,"John, hope you find some crawlers. Tough time to get them. There is a bait shop in dryden on the left side about 1/2 mile past best western. Might give them a shot if all else fails. Don't know the name but it is a gas station too. Catch a bunch of fish and be safe mike kansas"
1485792,Mohleye,2012-09-12 14:46:00,368,"Although I normally buy my crawlers in Canada, in this case I'd recommend buying them in the states and taking them across the border. Just make sure they're packed in artificial bedding. With the fall temps should be no problem transporting them."
