Along the way we caught hundreds and hundreds of 3-5lb brookies, many on topwater mouse patterns. It truly was beyond belief.At one point we were also chased by a polar bear!Trip of a lifetime for sure.If you'd like to read the whole story in detail you can see it here, complete with pic's and video clips.It's a very long read so don't open the link unless you have an hour to kill.http://www.canadafishingguide.net/br...river-journal/Cheers, Mike"

1487943,beer slayer,2012-09-18 20:03:00,33,"Hi Mike - I really enjoy your reports, What a trip you had! I would be real leery of the bears myself. I did a trip with Hearst air last August myself to Wanzatika lake, it was a fun time. Fishing was kinda slow, but everything else was good. Melanie from Hearst air is a very nice lady. So I wanted to tell you I booked a trip with Brad from 7 lakes to Teabeu lake/ Albany river 2nd week of June 2013 for me & my wife. Really looking forward to this, a lot of my research was had from your reports among others. I wanted to say thank you for all your reviews & insights. I will let you know how the trip goes. Until then Good fishing. Kenny from New Jersey"

His camp on Teabeau is one I'm really interested in myself actually, so I would love to hear how you make out. It's a spectacularly beautiful part of the Albany, that much I know.Cheers"
