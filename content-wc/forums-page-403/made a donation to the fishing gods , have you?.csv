At least once a year the hat blows off my head and lands in the lake. I have always turned around and fished it out of the lake. This year, it blows off again and sinks like a stone.........Had to buy a new hat"

1488665,Hawgeye,2012-09-21 06:07:00,1355,"My 12 yo son and I were fishing Waubay in the spring several years ago. I'd say it was water temps of about 45 degrees. We were jigging along a sunken road next to a few other boats and just so happened to be facing a boat with a couple fishing. As I am watching, I see the wife in the bow was all bundled up with the rod leaning on gunwale. At that moment, the rod bends and flips over the side. In what seemed to be slow motion, the husband leans over stretching down into the water and floopp, head first over the side he goes completely under water. The next thing I see is a hand appear with the fishing pole, then his head, then shoulders. He hands his wife the rod and he proceeds to swim back to the transom, climb into the boat. At the same time as this is going on, the wife is yelling, ""hey, I got a fish!"" As she is now focused on the fish, the husband is grumbling and shivering with the net in his hand. It was about a 3lb pike. He unhooked the fish, threw it over the side and off they went, presumably to the landing. About an hour later, just the husband was back in what appeared to be a fresh ""brand new set of clothing...and no wife?"" I always wondered what happened to her that day."

1488790,farmnfish,2012-09-21 10:28:00,130,"I've been gifted from the gods and have returned the gift. On a fly-in trip I noticed something shiny in about 5 feet of water, dropped a spoon down and pulled up a very nice rod and reel. About 5 years later I loaned that very same rod and reel to another guy in the boat and he dropped it in the lake. Easy come, easy go."
1488098,tackleman,2012-09-19 15:39:00,444,"yesterday i started out heading to the north end of the lake to see if any big ones were hanging around fishermans point. when i left the dock i had put my micro lite pole in the boat to see if i could have some fun with it.well , i guess when i pulled my life jacket on the pole must have moved and i never noticed it, so just as i was pulling up to fishermans point i heard a little rattle but i thought it was the large minnows i had in my bucket making a noise.i stopped the boat and went to get the pole, it was nowhere to be seen.i kinda figure that the rattle i heard must have been the pole going over the side. i guess the fishing gods must have liked it and wanted it. So, if anyone pulls in a micro lite with a diawa reel, enjoy , Any one else make a donation to the gods this year, lets hear what you lost."
1488105,wallydave,2012-09-19 16:01:00,2151,just the usual jigs and more jigs!! The first walleye usually goes back to prevent the fish gods from becoming angry!!??
1488172,Fred_G,2012-09-19 18:49:00,908,"Not sure if this qualifies but I lost two brand new Loomis NRX rods with Curado reels last month. I put them in the boat, made a quick stop for a pop and when I got to the lake they were gone. Not sure if they were stolen or if they blew out driving down the road. I hope whoever has them is enjoying them. I'm sure enjoying the replacements!"
1488194,Lund1993,2012-09-19 19:25:00,141,Scotty rod holder knocked it off when landing boat next to the dock at red door resort on mille lacs. Tried to fish it out with a net but 18 inches of muck sucked it in.

1488259,HeHooksHimself,2012-09-20 05:13:00,725,"This didn't happen this year and I have told this story before, but it is worth hearing again in my opinion.I was fishing with my BIL Doc in a place we frequent and the week was ending fast. We were jigging and knew it was time to go in on the last hours of the last day. We had been talking about how we would have to be leaving soon, but each one of us wanted one more cast. I'm watching Doc and his pole somehow just slips out of his hand and in the drink. He leans over, seeing nothing but tea-stained water but staring down for a good 10 seconds, then he stands erect, looks at me and says, ""we were done fishing, right?""We still laugh about that one."
1488261,Skywagon,2012-09-20 05:30:00,1106,"Eagle lake, opening day this year, put a fish in the livewell went to pick up my rod and it was gone. Drug a bare jig around for a while trying to snag the pole, caught two fish, but no rod, oh well."
1488263,tly,2012-09-20 05:35:00,1900,"The tackle gods have had wonderful days as results of my several sinkings (another set of stories). Generally anything that floats is long gone. Pails, vests, cushions, nets, markers, tackle boxes. The target lake is only 800+ acres but I have recovered very little of this stuff. It either must eventually sink or someone needs it more than I do. The gods have kind of done a free will offering though. I have had a number of fish remain in the boat after recovery. Still not much of a trade off."
1488281,Medds1,2012-09-20 06:29:00,18,"This year, my wife and I on our ""couples"" trip were flying across the lake, as fast as a 20hp Yamaha will do. I hear her babling something, I take my attention off of the scenery, all the memories of past trips, and the thought of ""are you serious"" we are on vacation what did I do wrong this time. Just in time to notice the suction cup on the transducer must have come undone and was no reeling wire out the back of the boat at close to light speed, pulled the plug out of the back of the fish finder cleaner and quicker then I did plugging it in. She starts in with ""I was trying to warn you"", my response, ""Didn't need that anyway, this is Canada"". Fished the rest of the trip no problems, caught plenty of fish in locations I had fished before. The second I got back across the border I was ordering a new transducer for the ""guys"" trip two weeks later."
1488509,ILScott,2012-09-20 15:52:00,139,Friend of mine brought a fish basket that his son painted bright orange before he left. The first night out fishing I had a fish on at this was going to be our limit. When I got the fish in and of the hook my partner noticed the fish basket was gone. We looked for it and trolled around the area but could not find it. He was not very happy. On Monday we had a cabin fish tournament and my partner for the day and myself went and fished the area we lost the basket. Sure enough on my last cast I thought I had a snag and then it kept coming up. About a two or three feet from the top of the water I noticed the orange basket. Only 3 fish left in it but i did need one more for my contest. When we went to weigh in everybody was looking at the fish weird because it had some orange paint on it. I then had to tell everyone that I caught the basket but I still one the contest. Scott
