6460496,Fisherman1792,2020-07-05 05:06:00,927,"Thanks for all the replies. Been using them for years just didn't know what they were called or where I even got them, but I'm down to only one now so would like to get a few more. Ya, they are like a poor mans downrigger, I use 25lbs Berkley big game mono for all my lake trout/salmon fishing. I've never experienced the Gibbs ever cutting the line when it slid down to the knot. Thanks again for the help all! Fisherman 1792"
6460504,Wrktfsh,2020-07-05 06:02:00,492,Get some rubber core sinkers in the sizes you need. Shove a brass wire in them with a loop on one end. Boom....sinkers that release when snagged
6460626,Paul H,2020-07-05 15:17:00,1232,https://www.gibbsdelta.com/product/d...weight-sinker/ Google Gibbs-Delta. I saw a few sites selling them.
6460642,campchick,2020-07-05 15:44:00,96,Isn't this a great website? Ask a question and someone always knows! Â‘Never heard of this kind of sinker.
6460902,wmd,2020-07-06 13:27:00,388,"Use a Pucci sliding swivel to attach the weight, it's what Im use for bottom bouncers. Cabelas has them wmd"
6460110,Fisherman1792,2020-07-03 16:15:00,927,"Hey guys, I'm looking for a certain slip sinker don't know what the real name of them are called and I don't know where i even got this but I've had them for years and they work real well for me fishing lake superior. If you come across any or have spares ill buy. They are 6oz weight. Thanks Fisherman 1792"

6460150,Guest,2020-07-03 18:48:00,0,Send more detailed pics to [email protected] Have a friend that manufactures all kinds of tackle I'm sure he could figure something out for you
6460154,ccr,2020-07-03 19:20:00,8,They're called a Gibb sinker.
6460276,Bill Krejca,2020-07-04 07:17:00,6107,"Appears they are designed to release if snagged, other wise it would seem to be a lot simpler to create without the snap-on wire, eh? Bill"
6460308,prov1800,2020-07-04 07:59:00,5010,6 oz pretty heavy.sounds like your going deep and long lining.
6460310,Jesse-WI,2020-07-04 08:11:00,534,https://westsidestores.ca/products/d...ht-sinker.html seem to have some heavier weights in stock
6460328,The tank,2020-07-04 09:19:00,340,Cabelas has them.
6460332,Clairebear,2020-07-04 09:40:00,937,Gibbs is correct. Some call them a poor mans down rigger. They work well but I've experienced cut lines once they slide down to the bait.
6460460,Stringbean,2020-07-04 21:03:00,279,What weight line do we spool up when using these sinkers?
