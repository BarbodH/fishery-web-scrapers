Approximatly 1 mile of normalÄºy crazy fishing. Nothing.I probably saw 200 fish.Lake is clear to about 20 ft.had the boat in 12-15 ft.Could see them trying to get under my boat for shade.lol.I checked some areas and reefs.Saw fish all over.Had fun trying all the bass stuff.Lake has some trout also and huge walleyes which ill try at a later date and the odd muskie.Decided to meet up with my wife and do a bit of swimming.Still in upper 30c.here.to hot."
