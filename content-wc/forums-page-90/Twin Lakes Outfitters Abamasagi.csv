But my son, now 23, but went on his 1st trip at 10yrs old and every trip since, flew into Aba with his best buddy. His bud has never been on a fly-in before and my son had never planned, organized a trip like this. These guys have done several canoe trips for a couple days, but never a fly-in for a week,14hr drive, etc. They just got home this weekend and had a fantastic trip. All parts of the trip went smooth, drive, flying, camp,etc. He said he now realizes what goes into the organization of a trip like this. Im proud he pulled off his 1st one, albeit only 2. I also wanna give a shout out to Chad, Dawn. TLO and these 2 are honestly the best. Amazing people. There isnt much going on up in Nakina and the flight base on Cordingley right now. TLO has a couple lakes open for business. If youre even remotely debating a trip( obviously Ontarians for now), DO IT. Give them a call. These outfitters want and need our business. Fishing.....A lot different than June for sure. Water temps went from mid 60sF to mid 70sF in less than 1wk. Brutal heat. Then the hated mayfly hatch hit midweek. But they worked hard and still caught loads of fish. Cheers"
6460792,kona77,2020-07-06 07:55:00,236,Glad your son had a successful trip.. I am sure he learned a lot from his dad over the years!!! Nice to see a trip report to help us get thru this difficult summer.. Thanks for posting

6461090,Bobby Winds,2020-07-07 04:32:00,10817,I fished Aba way back in the 80's in late August.......fishing was amazingly easy and almost no bugs to contend with. A 8 man crew comprised of 1080 walleyes and over 200 pike just jigging black bucktails and Mister Twisters.......NO BAIT was ever used. Things have changed in the last 40 years but I'm sure you will find August to your liking. Bob
6461156,gmattbruin,2020-07-07 07:29:00,174,"Hey Bobby, thats awesome to hear. Im not sure if this body of water has changed much as far as productivity. It is a fantastic walleye factory. Our #s each yr have only increased. We had a few days last June of catch over 200 per boat a day...it was incredible. But, we have never worked this lake in late Aug."
6461170,Bobby Winds,2020-07-07 08:12:00,10817,My old friend that ran most of these trips would always wait for August because he said the bugs are down and you never have to worry about black flies either. I remember taking a bath in the lake and I think it was still cold because there was significant shrinkage.......LOL
6461226,kingsalmon,2020-07-07 12:04:00,1,"We were At Camp #3 the same week your boy was there and I met him at the airbase and flew out with them at the end. Thumbs up on surviving the week that it was. Seven days of heat like we have never experienced before. Our water went from 64F on Saturday to 85F on Thursday. At least we swam everyday. Fish were transitioning differently everyday. Walleye were at 5ft on Saturday and were 15-20 feet down by the end of the week. Scattered and not finding concentrations anywhere but we probably caught close to 1000 for the week fishing mornings and evenings with 8 people. One thing that will be on my list for the future will be a big fan to pull out the heat from the cabin in the evenings. It was brutal! If we had a mosquito tent, we could have been outside in the cool air, but the bugs dictated we stay inside in the evening. I would also like to thank Chad, Dawn, & Twin Lakes Outfitters for accommodating us at the last minute and taking care of our check flight replenishment list as my kids burned through the beverages in the heat. Having moose hunted with TLO for over 30 years in spike camps, we were spoiled by the cabin and hot/cold running water with shower. Almost everything that you needed was there including ice. My wife is still looking for the flushing toilet though........ )) If anyone from Ontario is looking for great and affordable fly-in fishing, go with TLO. They have numerous openings as the US/Canada border is closed and they would be more than happy to accommodate others. For the Americans, I hope that this virus crap gets resolved sooner than later so that we can get back to some normalcy in our world. Mike G."
