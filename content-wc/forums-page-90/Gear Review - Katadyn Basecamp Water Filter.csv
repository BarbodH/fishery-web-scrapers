6460976,BnD,2020-07-06 16:13:00,13,This is sawyer video but it will work on any water filter system. Filter runs slow backflush and your good as new. The back flush syringe is the key.https://sawyer.com/videos/backwashing-tips-tricks/
6461088,BnD,2020-07-07 04:02:00,13,"Read my post on backflushing including video. On the move the best option by far is a sawyer mini filter spliced into the straw portion of a nalgene water bottle. Just dip it in the lake and drink. No pumping no stopping. Lots of trial and err with various water filter systems. The sawyer bag system works ok but, fills slow, multi step process, etc. Again the sawyer mini spliced in the straw is the best option we've ever tried for water on the go."

6459314,pike50plus,2020-07-01 14:55:00,584,Nice job
6459342,mctbone,2020-07-01 16:39:00,26,Been using this for fly-ins the last 7 years and it's always worked great for us. Unfortunately won't get to use it this year.
6459506,kona77,2020-07-02 06:30:00,236,Good update- May need to try this if we ever need to supply our own fresh water again
6459522,gordy28,2020-07-02 07:01:00,437,Thanks all - glad the review was helpful! Andrew
6459550,10lbeye,2020-07-02 07:49:00,61,"I've used it for the last 5 fly ins and love it as well, with one caveat. The filter will eventually clog sooner than advertised, and the last 2 trips didn't last the entire week, but thankfully we had a spare one. Good idea to buy an extra one as a backup."
6460314,BnD,2020-07-04 08:23:00,13,We backcountry fish/camp a lot in Wabakimi and Quetico Parks and we always use a 4l gravity works system. The key to longevity for all of these type filters is two fold 1. Find the cleanest water available and most important get a back flush syringe to flush the filter in reverse of water flow. The filters clog on the outside of the inlet side ( dirty water) waaayyy before the filter media is actually plugged full. We usually flush ours every other day or so depending on use and water clarity. Upon returning home we flush a mild bleach solution thru the filter to kill any bacteria or viruses and set out to dry to re-use. Hope this is useful. Works great for us for years after years of experimenting with different water filter setups.
6460832,10lbeye,2020-07-06 09:22:00,61,BnD: Thanks for sharing your tip. Not sure I can figure out from your description exactly how to do this. Can you explain a bit further or show me visually through a photo or 2? Thanks.
6460864,Jerryv,2020-07-06 11:40:00,1222,Last time I went camping in the BWCA I had one of the Katadyn hand pumps and another guy brought one off these gravity filters. The combination was good. The hand pump is better when you are on the move. The gravity bag is great in camp. Take extra filters though. Six guys can go through a lot of water when it is warm and our filters were so clogged by the end of the trip that we could hardly get anything through them. Jerry
