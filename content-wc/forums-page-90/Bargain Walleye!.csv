6460230,tv4fish,2020-07-04 04:49:00,2694,"Bill: One thing that my 2 buddies and I agreed upon many years ago ---- we were NEVER going to try and figure out what the ""cost per pound"" was for our Canadian walleyes............."
6460272,Bill Krejca,2020-07-04 07:12:00,6107,"I had a guy once keep track of every fish we all caught for the week and figured in all costs to go up north. I don't remember the breakdown, but we all know it's not just about the fish. Another subject - Is it possible that the cut gills, etc can change the length of the fish, change enough to cause a concern for the authorities?. just asking. Bill"
6460280,prov1800,2020-07-04 07:21:00,5010,"I would say if your keeping fish that close to the your already taking chances.Ive kept some fish close the kine for some of my guests and just having a fish in the lifewell will change its kength.I keep only smaller fish to eat so never have to worry about a ticket.Tge guys that want to keep a 18"" fish are playing with fire.lol."
6460752,Ozark Bob,2020-07-06 06:27:00,5240,"This is my procedure when the surface temps get above 80. Like you(Gerry) I bought 1,000 bags.( I use them wherever and whenever I can! I did shop for a month or so and got a bargan price and went for it. I will leave the Amazon link but I bought then for $16.72 in 2017. They are $82!! now so not a good choice anymore. I am supplying the link for the size and description. Leaving fish in the livewell at those temps are not conducive to better tasting fish.

6461626,emma17,2020-07-08 12:40:00,436,We just returned from Florida the other day. We were hanging out with a FL couple and they were telling us about a great seafood/fish restaurant nearby. He said he had the best fish he's ever had. Something called...Walleye. From the menu:Appetizers too: [QUOTE*Grouper or Walleye Fingers 14.95 Grouper or Canadian walleye strips lightly breaded and fried served with tartar sauce and fresh lemon wedges.][/QUOTE]
6461636,Eckohlt,2020-07-08 13:16:00,3685,Emma17 sounds darn good to me
6447988,Bill Krejca,2020-06-03 15:40:00,6107,"I see in the flyer today that Fareway has walleye, 5 pounds for $45. You'll never get it that cheap once the border opens!!!! I don't buy walleye in the store, but couldn't jokingly pass up sharing how much cheaper it can be rather than what it costs when we personally engage in the ""outside procurement process""! Bill"
6447994,walleyecheek,2020-06-03 15:55:00,2231,Are you sure they're not trying to pass it off as POLLOCK ?
6448006,Eckohlt,2020-06-03 16:30:00,3685,"I much prefer the 200$ per pound eye myself it taste better lol,rod"
6448154,Bill Krejca,2020-06-04 05:38:00,6107,"Ha,ha, yeah! My point exactly!!Re:Pollock - Naw, I don't think they are legally allowed to advertise as such for the fresh/frozen fish market, but that doesn't stop folks who advertise dinners as ""Alaskan walleye""!Bill"
6459794,ackvil,2020-07-02 17:47:00,177,I received an email from walleyedirect.com selling 11 pounds of walleye fillet for $130. Red Lake fishery sells it for $154+
6459810,Clairebear,2020-07-02 18:31:00,937,"28 and 30"" Walleye are 1/2 the price per pound as 22"" fish. And 1/4 the quality in my eyes. You get what you pay for."
6459930,prov1800,2020-07-03 07:20:00,5010,Nothing like fresh fish caught and then eaten at a shorelunch or brought home in livewell tank or on ice.Actually i find the fish put on ice the best as required on Lac Seul.We put a couple of frozen gallon jugs of frozen water in a cooler on our Lac Suel days.
6459956,gbin,2020-07-03 08:57:00,1384,"While in graduate school a buddy and I looked at capture stress in FL gar. We'd electroshock the fish out of a lake, hold them alive and sample their blood at various intervals after capture. Meaningful levels of stress hormones showed up pretty darn quickly and continued to rise for some time thereafter.Last time I fished LOTW (U.S. side), several years ago, was the first time I used a method I'd seen recommended in a few different places online: Whenever I caught a fish that I planned to keep, I immediately bled it out and and threw it on ice. The fillets were more white and I believe tastier than any I'd had before - and I've eaten a lot of walleye over the course of my life!So I'm now sold on this method.Gerry"
6460012,Clairebear,2020-07-03 11:14:00,937,"I too slit the gills as soon as I catch them and then into a half full bucket of water to bleed out for a few minutes. Then put them on ice, this keeps your cooler and ice nice and clean."
6460082,gbin,2020-07-03 14:45:00,1384,"Some years ago I bought a big roll of lightweight, leak-proof, food-grade plastic bags - like produce bags you get in the grocery, but somewhat bigger and thicker - that I use for all kinds of purposes (and I still think the roll will last the rest of my life. ). What I do is slip the fish into one of these bags right after bleeding it out and then I pack the bagged fish in ice. No waiting and no chance of mess in the cooler. I probably still have ordering information on the bags around here somewhere if anyone is interested. I'm quite pleased with them! Gerry"
