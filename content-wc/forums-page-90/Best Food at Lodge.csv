6383998,Guest,2020-01-06 11:22:00,0,Friends I like to eat and was wondering what Lodge you have stayed at has the best food. My vote goes for the Old Post Lodge and Donald Fraiser as the Head Chef
6384026,bthomas3333,2020-01-06 12:29:00,465,Hawk Lake Lodge and compared to more than 12 other full service places in NWT/MB/ON it isn't even really close.Brett
6384040,prov1800,2020-01-06 13:23:00,5010,Although i dont eat at the lodges i guide at i have had a few breakfasts and dinners and i think theve all been fantastic.Anytime someone puts food in front of is fine with me.But the shorelunches i would rate #1.

6385824,martinbns,2020-01-12 16:46:00,1520,"Totem and Wylie Point have unreal food. Not cheap but fantastic, as good as any restaurant I've ever eaten in."
6385844,fishron,2020-01-12 18:17:00,317,"Unfortunately, the best food at any lodge our group ever had is no longer available. For so many years our group of fishermen, wives and kids enjoyed the dining room at Green Shingle fishing resort in Southern Canada. The wife of Bill McCullough, Anna, served up the best breakfasts, lunches and dinners that we had ever had at any lodge. Nobody ever left the table hungry. I can remember many times coming in from the lake for dinner, grubby and smelling like fish and always having our large table full of men women and children in the midst of the local regulars that had come to feast on her great food. We would eat and enjoy and many times hear the wind howl off the lake as the lodge sat on the top of a hill over the lake. After dinner we would all retire to our cabins dispersed throughout the camp in anticipation of breakfast the next morning. As a group we have fished many places in Canada but nothing ever compared to the memories of Green Shingle."
6386668,Lazy Fisherman,2020-01-15 13:08:00,276,My 2 favorites are Hawk Lake Lodge and Wylie Point. Great food and atmosphere.
6386672,PJHColdwater,2020-01-15 13:19:00,37,Zup's Resort on Lac La Croix. Hands down the best food I have every had at a fishing resort. We must have all gained 5 pounds on the last trip. Gourmet quality main course and desserts.

6387030,adempsey2.0,2020-01-17 08:37:00,611,"I was at a lodge several years back and there was a large group of guys who would NOT stop talking about the food and service at Hawk Lake Lodge. For whatever reason it has always stuck in my mind. Especially the snack basket you get that had popcorn in it, lol. That always replays in my head when I read about Hawk Lake Lodge. No idea why. They were just so excited about their complimentary popcorn snack basket I guess.Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk"
