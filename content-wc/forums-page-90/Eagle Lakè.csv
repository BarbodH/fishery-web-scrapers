6463052,Net_Man,2020-07-13 09:56:00,580,"I only fished Froghead Bay once and it was our first year on Eagle on opener and we struggled. But I would like to think that I am a much better fishermen now then back then. However we did make it in the lodges picture book most years back then........... Assuming that they still have the spring walleye closure which had covered Froghead Bay, is Froghead Bay a good spot after the closure June 1st I believe?"
6463054,prov1800,2020-07-13 10:01:00,5010,Still closed for the spawn.Fishing is incredible in there once it opens.Gets busy though at times.
6463056,Net_Man,2020-07-13 10:17:00,580,"It was 1982 and I can still remember bumping in to my first rock in Froghead. Just a slight bump at trolling speed. The rock came up very sharply and went right back down very sharply. I believe from at least 13' plus of water........ Ah, the sound of a boat in the distance running at approx full speed on a quiet day. What a lovely sound till you hear the bang followed by a wheeeeeeeee from the motor. Busy - Is this Canadian busy or Minnesota busy? I can't say it was busy back then but I do recall too many Temple Bay boats running back and forth on the lake. Speaking of rocks on Eagle. What do you recommend for lake map chips for Eagle Lake in today's world. I have Humminbird and Garmin equipment."
6463066,prov1800,2020-07-13 10:50:00,5010,I would say cdn busy.As far as map chips go for lakes here there are nòne that would give you a safe passage especially the east end.Either go slow or hire a guide and make a safe route.Cheaper than a lower unit.
6463072,Eckohlt,2020-07-13 11:15:00,3685,Hire john Jakob's I think he could get around on most lakes in his area blindfolded lol
6463130,prov1800,2020-07-13 14:30:00,5010,Used to do that before GPS.Good old days.Used to guide all day then all ñight.lol.
6463170,v-bay gord,2020-07-13 15:40:00,3168,"Back in the ""day"" we would fish Froghead on the opener, back in what I think some referred to as the Frog Pond....it was a small shallow lake you went into through a narrow channel on the west side of Froghead Bay. It was dark water and probably not much more than 8 feet, but we did catch fish back there."
6463230,prov1800,2020-07-13 18:06:00,5010,Ill try my best Bill.We try to pick a couple of nice days a week.Hard to go everyday.Can get expensive.Like the no stress fishing with my wife.Fish a little swim a bit.Its like being on a holiday.Going to fish west arm next week wife wants to go see Buzzard Falls which is a beautifull area and there is some real good walleye down there and lake trout as thats where the 2 trout holes are and the clear water. Looking like a lot of wind this week.Its roughly 20 mi from Vermilion Bay to the falls.
6463234,Net_Man,2020-07-13 18:18:00,580,Do they still have a night closure on Eagle? The owner at camp back in the day talked about night fishing but I believe they implemented a night closure at some point in time and I never participated in it.
6463238,prov1800,2020-07-13 18:32:00,5010,Sure do.Have to make sure all lights work on the boat in case you run back in the dark.have till 1/2 hr after sunset.
6462916,LoDo,2020-07-12 21:05:00,721,Excellent thread! Nice photos and comments!!
6462936,Net_Man,2020-07-12 22:20:00,580,"Prov1800, In talking about Eagle Lake you bring up some fond memories of mine from the early 80's and 90's. I use to fish once or twice a year during this time frame but I have not been up there in the last 20 plus years. Most of my trips were at opener and we always stayed at Colegrove's. Do you get over to the east end much for fishing? I am not sure of how long your experience is at Eagle Lake but I have been curious on how walleye fishing is more recently compared to 25+ years ago."
6462960,prov1800,2020-07-13 05:48:00,5010,"Been fishing Eagle since the mid 80,s.It was pretty slow then.Fished the west end a lot then and down to Nash Bay.Last few years i have guideď for Northshore Lodge which is close to Colegroves.Fishing has improved 1000 %.Fish everywhere."
6462966,Bill Krejca,2020-07-13 06:18:00,6107,"I remember driving by Eagle in the early 1950's to visit nearby friends, Dad remarked that it used to be really good, but it was becoming ""fished out"", as they called ""overharvesting"" in those days. (Dad and I fished the Eagle River one day, got mostly small pike.) As with many other water bodies, it is good to see what positives can happen when sound limit provisions are in effect. On a general down side, it is easy to predict what negatives will happen when overharvesting, by whatever means, returns to a body of water. Keep those tease pictures coming, John, even just scenery is welcomed! Bill"
6462968,prov1800,2020-07-13 06:32:00,5010,"Eagle was heavily commercial fished then.It still is today but more monitòred.I see the buoys marking nets all the time.Mainly for whitefish in 60-80 ft Amazingly they catch other species in those depths to especially big pike.They are allowed a 3% accidental catch to their quotas.But fishing eagle is amazing if you know where to go.Tough always getting big ones but its a big lake but if you like to catch lots of eaters and some slot fish (18-23"") its pretty good.Sometimes guests want to go fish the west end (45 mi) run.Its a amazing trip to Buzzard Falls."
6462974,v-bay gord,2020-07-13 06:55:00,3168,"Since I've been on Eagle (back in the 70's) there has only been one licensed commercial fishery targeting whitefish. They are limited to fishing the big section of the lake, but at one time could fish Portage Bay. Way back in the day (1930's) there was more commercial fishing, and I've seen some of the poundage of fish taken out which was amazing....including lake trout and musky! In the 80's the walleye fishery was struggling, and much of the local blame was heaped on the commercial netting, but of course the main problem was overharvesting by the camps....no size limits, generous bag limits, and more and more anglers. Since then many good changes have been made to manage the fishery, and it has rebounded. MNR sampling on the lake has shown it to have a very healthy walleye population....but as Prov states it can still be a challenge as it's a big lake with a lot of different patterns. The nice thing about Eagle is that most of the shoreline has no development, and a few years ago the whole body of water was reclassified as ""trout waters"", which invokes very strict building codes, basically shutting down most future development. Over the past ten years the pike population has gone way down, probably associated with the introduction of the rusty crayfish, but I'm seeing a ton of juvenile pike these days which tells me things are starting to balance themselves once again. Anyways, that's my take on Eagle Lake........love it!"
6462976,rosh1,2020-07-13 07:05:00,275,Thanks for the pictures.
6462984,prov1800,2020-07-13 07:42:00,5010,I have been seeing a increase in the rusty greyfish in the east end in the last couple of years.Some spots are very good and you can catch a bunch of them.Very good eating.Can trap them very easy to.
6462988,Net_Man,2020-07-13 07:50:00,580,When we starting going up to Eagle in 1982 we were rookies. Fished mostly east and west of Stanton Island. About the time we were ready to branch out they started the spring walleye closures from north of Froghead Bay south to the Bear Narrows area. We fished a couple of times past Bear Narrows in the spring but never could work up much of a catch to keep bringing us back down there. We fished a few times in July on the main lake humps/reefs but we seen too many slow days. We really did not see any uptick of the quality of fishing and we branched out to fly-in trips and other lakes approx. year 2000.Maybe it is time to plan to go back.
6462996,prov1800,2020-07-13 08:04:00,5010,Yup.Fishing is very good.Of course its busier than a flyout.But its a big lake to.Love frog head.fantaztic fishing as well as stanton bay.
6461578,7 Mag,2020-07-08 10:35:00,1887,"Thanks, I'm curious if the zebra muscles have invaded Eagle and the surrounding lakes. They've become such a problem here."
6461674,prov1800,2020-07-08 15:01:00,5010,No zebras.only rusty crayfish.but there just more food for fish.
6461752,dakota eye,2020-07-08 19:42:00,69,"John, just curious what we're casting into the weedbeds? Thx"
6461798,rockpt,2020-07-08 23:19:00,589,Outstanding! And agree 14-15 inchers are good eaters.
6461818,prov1800,2020-07-09 05:45:00,5010,Weedless jigs and drop shot with a weedless hook.Both ways worked very good.
6461836,rosh1,2020-07-09 06:56:00,275,You need more background in pictures so I can tell where you are. Ha
6461840,prov1800,2020-07-09 07:06:00,5010,Lol.We caught a lot of fish in that calm bay pic.Its in Midway Bay by the little island where shorelunch spot is.Also the weed beds in thursday bay.Swimming on south side of net island on shorelunch island spot.Humps were no good.Ran to Garnett bay.slow there slow on humps in nash bay. Worked our way to midway.Most action there on a number of weed bed spots
6461842,rosh1,2020-07-09 07:10:00,275,Between your pictures and our neighbors facetime phone calls it helps. We are lucky to have them mowing for us. Wish we could get there!
6461846,prov1800,2020-07-09 07:23:00,5010,Hard to say when that will happen.maybe they will relax a bit in fall when travell slows down.
6462818,prov1800,2020-07-12 17:32:00,5010,"Had another awesome day on Eagle Lake today.Fished the weedbeds again and did catch somecwalleye in them it was slower there but the perch and pike bite was good.Today top of the humps produced great fishing.Nothing big today all up to 16"".Real steady bite.Lots of fun.greàt weather.All fish came on jigs in around 15 ft.Waþer temps at 75 f."
6461464,prov1800,2020-07-08 07:39:00,5010,"We decidèd to fish Eagle yesterday.Put in at Temple Bay.Fished humps heading west from camp.Slow fishing.Tried 5 spots and just caught a couple at each spot so decided to fish weed beds.That was the ticket. Each weedbed produced a lot of fish and perch bite was real good to.Great weather and little wind.Had a nice swim.Water was 76.5 f running on main lake warmer in bays.Lots of eater sized fish and got luckey with a 30"".Best fish for me so far this year.Fished till 2 and headed back.Did see 4 boats."
6461470,prov1800,2020-07-08 07:48:00,5010,Some nice pics of Eagle yesterday.The calm bay pic produced the best fishing.
6461490,Eckohlt,2020-07-08 08:16:00,3685,"4 boats that's a bit crowded john,swimming n fishing in Ontario doesn't get any better than that,30 incher that's a pig,that was nice of your wife to let you have a pic with her fish haha"
6461530,Bill Krejca,2020-07-08 08:50:00,6107,"Nice fish. Since the establishment of size restrictions, it is encouraging the amount of really nice fish being caught (and released). Back when I was a youngster and a bit older, a 30 incher was very hard to come by. I still remember an old magazine article by Al Lindner entitled, I think, ""Why You Won't Catch a 10 Pounder"" or words to that effect. Bill"
6461534,rosh1,2020-07-08 09:07:00,275,Thanks for pictures. You know your are driving me crazy! Keep it up please.
6461550,prov1800,2020-07-08 09:54:00,5010,"Great fishery.I was fishing and guiding in the 80,s and thatvwas a tough gig.Sometimes (mostly) we went and got a couple of whitefish for lunch.Pike where more abundent to back then and a more sought after fish then now.I can remember catching more muskies also back then while casting for pike and my guests complaining that there were to many muskies. Mepps soinners and cheapspinner baits is all you needed.Right now Eagle is loaded with 13-16"" fish.So many i think bigger fish have a hard time getting at your bait.Thats my thought.Can get on the humps and just catch one after the other.Lots of slot fish throughout a day also and always a chance at a trophy.Challenge on windy days she can get rolling"
6461552,stumcfar,2020-07-08 10:01:00,451,"Thanks for sharing. IF we can't be up there, it is fun to see pics! Slot limits make a difference. On the MN side of LOW, you can not keep any walleyes between 19.5"" and 28"". Catching a walleye 26""-31"" is a far more common occurrence now than a decade ago. One problem though is it is getting increasingly difficult to catch that 16"" to 18"" fish. Heavy winter pressure along with the summer fishing in my opinion is depleting the keeper sized fish."
6461562,7 Mag,2020-07-08 10:16:00,1887,"Thanks for sharing, how is the water clarity on Eagle Lake?"
6461570,prov1800,2020-07-08 10:22:00,5010,"Agreed.Eagles slot is 18-23"" Where Lac Seuls is 18.1-20.9""not sure whos idea was the LS slot.The magic # for keeper fish is 17"" up here.So those can become a hard find.Eagle is a busy lake as are all the lakes.This border closure is amazing when we go out and dont see anyone.or only 2 which is nothing.Good thing we are into 13-15"" fish to eat.Have zero problems getting them."
6461572,prov1800,2020-07-08 10:26:00,5010,Water clarity is cleaŕ to stained.The west arm has the trout waters and gradually as you head toward the east end its starts staining but it has started to clear up some in east end to.
