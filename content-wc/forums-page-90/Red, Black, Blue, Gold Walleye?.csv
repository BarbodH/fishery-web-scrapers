6460546,gbin,2020-07-05 08:16:00,1384,"The thing is, some of the genes that made the blue pike look the way they did are likely still around even though the species itself apparently isn't. It's known to happen that individuals of a species en route to extinction will sometimes hybridize with close relatives in the vicinity because mates of their own species have become difficult or impossible to find.

6459228,fishron,2020-07-01 11:26:00,317,"Fishing Cabonga reservoir in Quebec years ago, we would catch off colored walleye on occasion. Steve Hamel who owned the lodge at that time claimed the lake had four different kinds of walleye. The red it turns out were Sauger. A fishing buddy in my boat caught one that was 21 inches. Placed next to the common gold variety, the fish was definitely of a reddish hue, especially in the fins. Smaller fish showed the bloches common to Sauger. The Blue, I'm sure many of the WC guys catch regularly have little gold on them and blue in the fins. This one's a Blue. Now and then we would catch a walleye that was for sure much darker than the common Gold walleye. A black phase? Maybe because of the water in a particular place. One thing they all had in common. They were delicious to eat. I would never suggest we introduce any foreign species but the European Zander is very similar to a Walleye. The males are said to guard the eggs somewhat like a bass. Seems that could be handy if the waters were inhabited by Gobies. The European perch grows over six pounds occasionally. Need a bigger hole in the ice? Lots of other interesting fish have come along over the years but the variation in the walleye clan has me curious. Anybody else catch some weird ones?"
6459246,eyecatcher1,2020-07-01 11:59:00,323,"I have caught two blue walleyes in Canada too. One on Lac Seul and the other on Abram Lake. Even caught a blue perch once on Lac Seul. I knew that there used to be blue walleyes in Lake Erie, so I did some research. The blue walleyes in Erie were their own species and at one time were thought to be extinct. Ends up a few have been showing up again the past few years. The ones we catch in Canada they say are just color mutations. We have also caught several walleyes in Lake Minnitaki that are so dark green that they are almost black."
6459298,hoosiercanadian,2020-07-01 13:56:00,104,"Sauger have black dots on their top dorsal fin, i fish for them in late fall, early winter here on the Ohio river. They interbreed with walleye to make saugeye, but i do not know whether a saugeye would have a clear dorsal fin or one with black dots. I also have caught a few blue walleye from a lake in the Savant Lake area of Ontario. Up in north west Manitoba the walleye have a brilliant orange belly. And i have caught them out of lakes that almost look muddy , but it is the makeup of the bottom and those walleye are silver."

6460116,frozen fish,2020-07-03 16:49:00,92,Here in Manitoba walleye colour can range from black/brown with yellow/gold sides in the North to silver/grey on Lake Manitoba to the famous Greenbacks on Lake Winnipeg.
6460226,tv4fish,2020-07-04 04:36:00,2694,"Just a FWIW:And - another ""thought"":Quote: There are a lot of different things that come into play in a fishes color. Much of it has to do with water clarity and diet. And yes fish can change thier color to somewhat match thier surroundings. And actually the darker fish come from shallower water and the lighter fish deeper.However, most has to do with water clarity and diet."
6460240,Bobby Winds,2020-07-04 05:28:00,10817,"In Buffalo, NY walleye was called ""Yellow Pike"" because Lake Erie also had ""Blue Pike"" which my dad said were smaller and better tasting. Over the years there has been ""claims"" of someone catching a blue pike but the NYS DEC has always as far as I know dismissed those claims once DNA was done on said fish. So with all that said, do you have any links to any Lake Erie Blue Pike as I am very interested if you found anything new/different. Bob"
6460268,fishron,2020-07-04 07:10:00,317,"That green backed walleye is one I've never seen before. It's hard to believe that in all the years that Lake Erie had a vital fishery for the Blue Pike (walleye) that some enterprising fisherman didn't stock some in other lakes or some naturally made their way into Lake Ontario. As a boy in NE Philly I would see the blue pike displayed on ice at the local food market. The color wasn't obvious but the heads were small and the eyes were large suggesting a deeper water preference. There's nothing lacking in our present fish. Abundant, sporty, and delicious. Can't wait to get back on them. I might have to make a trip to the upper Delaware river to catch a few."

6460522,fishron,2020-07-05 07:06:00,317,That neat green back walleye tells me that the Eagles might have some representation here.
