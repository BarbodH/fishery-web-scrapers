One of my observations, call it a concern, maybe, was that there seemed to be few if any, deep areas in the water system. I believe I read that they drop the water level a few feet in winter, not sure why. It still looks interesting, and should afford you a good time, please let us know how you do. A bit deeper water appears to be at the upper end (nearer the other camp ) Bill"

There are a lot of medium size pike and small mouth in there, nothing huge, but occasionally someone will pull out a 40"" pike down towards the dam. Walleyes are ok, you'll catch a bunch of small ones, but there's not many over 25"" in there. In any case, it is a beautiful lake and you'll catch some fish, in the Ely area it's one of the best spots behind Vermillion."
6460640,Walleye2242,2020-07-05 15:42:00,263,Any info if there are fishing camps on the boundary waters? is it all canoe trips? Fishing camps in the states sure do seem to be more expensive than canadian resorts which is odd to me but whatever. I am not sure i am up for a canoe trip at my age. Just looking for options since i assume my august canada trip will not happen. Thanks to all.
6460654,LoDo,2020-07-05 16:18:00,721,Boundary waters is a different trip IMO.
6460660,rockpt,2020-07-05 16:46:00,589,"There are several lodges with cabin and boat rentals along the Gunflint Trail. https://northshorevisitor.com/lodgin...unflint-trail/ I've only been up there in the winter so can't comment on the fishing, but it's a beautiful area. A lot more activities too than the typical Canadian fishing lodge."
6460710,h8go4s,2020-07-05 20:53:00,1673,"The BWCAW is the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. No motorized travel allowed, no resorts in the BWCAW. However, the Minnesota-Canada boundary extends many miles beyond the BWCAW, including lakes like Namakan, Rainy and Lake of the Woods. There are also many lakes partially within the BWCA (Basswood, Saganaga for example) where there is a 25-HP limit on outboards."
6460722,prov1900,2020-07-05 23:51:00,544,"Check Kabetogama if you are looking for the ""closest thing to the Canadian experience"" while staying stateside. Lots of resort options and the fishing is pretty darn good. Not Canada by any means, but still way better than nothing. Canoe trips are rough. I use to guide in the BWCA/Quetico when I was young. Great experience...but not easy by any stretch. Another option is boat in camping on Rainy. Did that and it was awesome."
6461906,turkeyriver,2020-07-09 09:14:00,80,"BWCA canoe trips are a completely different experience. Fishing can be good but not like the 50-100 fish days you experience in Northern Canada. Paddling a canoe around is not for the out of shape fisherman. Speaking from experience, you will NEVER have a pucker factor greater than being in the middle of a lake when the wind unexpectedly picks up! I have been in the front of a canoe when every 3rd or 4th whitecap breaks over the front and puts some water in. If you're looking for an adrenaline rush I recommend it!!"
6461918,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2020-07-09 09:38:00,240,"Located at the end of the Gunflint trail, Seagull Creek Fishing Camp specializes in fishing Saganaga Lake, where your odds of catching a 10 lb. walleye are better than most destinations. Forget about numbers, but your odds of catching a big walleye are very good. The Minnesota state record walleye came out of Saganaga on the opening weekend of 1979. Sag. is a motorized lake until you reach Cache Bay on the Ontario side. Then it is paddle only. Not the easiest lake to navigate, with over 200 islands."
6462164,HeHooksHimself,2020-07-10 08:17:00,725,We booked the week of 8/14-8/21 at this resort. Seems a little refined (villa with a/c) but at least we will get to fish somewhere.....will post a report even though it is not in Canada. Fish On! Hooks
