6462770,Ltrain,2020-07-12 14:22:00,4145,"Bladedancer rolls over weeds too can be fished as a top water, just under surface, start and stop, you name it. Sounds like it fishes very similar to the Barney spoon. I like some of the Barney colors, probably grab a few to try out and compare to my BladedancersWhat color do you recommend?"
6462874,pike50plus,2020-07-12 20:13:00,584,"I have fished Blade dancers before, not as wide and not cupped as much on the top(underside when returning)"
6462886,Ltrain,2020-07-12 20:27:00,4145,Thanks for the info- if you had to buy one color which one would you go for?
6463164,pike50plus,2020-07-13 15:35:00,584,"I like black for overcast and early am, late pm and white for sunny daysWe use to be able to but these from the original lure maker in Kent OH for $7"

6350774,Ltrain,2019-08-16 22:34:00,4145,Look very similiar to the discontinued Berkley bladedancer. Really liked them lures wish Berkley still made them. Glad I stocked up when i did.

6462418,5 of Diamonds,2020-07-10 21:46:00,151,"Yea... It's still hard to believe... Been going up since '89... You? We're still optimistic (which helps us maintain our sanity) that our 2 week trip to Lac Kamwakuskach still happens this year. We're still planning Friday 21 August - Friday 04 September. The 3/4 oz Chartreuse Shad Barney Spoon is lights out on Nothern's. It's in my top 3 lures of all time when fishing in the bush, most especially mid-Summer... Just can't believe how effective it is... Blows my mind... Stay safe Amigo!"

6462734,Ltrain,2020-07-12 12:17:00,4145,"I don't know about that- the Blade dancers I use are the weedless edition. I can swim them through all but the densest vegetation, then I pull out the Moss Boss"
