He called someone in the DNR? and the fellow had a check sent to him for a refund. This posting should keep that fellow busy for some time! Good luck. Bill"

A refund can be submitted for consideration. Please provide the credit card type used and the last 4 digits. This process can take 4-6 weeks. If approved you will see the refund on the credit card statement. Your current 8 day licence will be invalidated once the credit card information is received.

There is another earlier thread that covers this refund as well."
6462236,eyecatcher1,2020-07-10 12:21:00,323,I just called the MNR and since I bought a three year license last year I don't qualify for the refund. He said it was for licenses purchased this year after the border closing date only. I'm not giving up on this year yet!
6462276,LOW1,2020-07-10 14:01:00,2828,"I have also not yet given up hope for 2020, especially for September. In late September it is very hard not to social distance as there just aren't very many people there anyway.But if it doesn't happen I will just consider my license cost to be a donation to a worthy cause. The MNR folks need to eat too. A few other local charities will get some dollars from us too. It may be a very tough winter up there."
