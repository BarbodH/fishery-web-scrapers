I personally dont know anyone who has been positive but our area has been great as well as the whole province of Manitoba.ÃŒ think something else could have been put in place to allow the camps to have had tgere guests come up instead of a lock down.Each group would be in there own space and just keep up tge social distance between the other groups.All cabins are usually spaced far apart anyways especially on a flyout.I just find the whole deal got a bad smell to it.
