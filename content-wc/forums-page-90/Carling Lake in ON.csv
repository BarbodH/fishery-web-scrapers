6460962,Cacoleman74,2020-07-06 15:50:00,3,Hello I am wondering if anyone has every fished Carling lake before and could give a little info on how the fishing was. We are considering it for 2021 with Slate Falls and they are remodeling a camp there. I have been unable to find much info on fishing there and wonder if anyone has been there. Any info would be appreciated. Thanks.

If memory serves, we hammered walleye every day, and caught a few big northern incidentally. It was a classic fly in lake where it seemed like the fish had never been exposed to artificial lures before. We had northern attack our marker buoys on multiple occasions. Biggest walleye was 24.75”, caught trolling a husky jerk on our way into camp at dusk the last night. Biggest northern was 13 pounds, didn’t get the length, mid 30s? Super fun and cool lake, my friends actually went back multiple times after and started figuring out the lake trout fishing I guess. I don’t think there are a lot of monsters in there, but they caught some decent trout and good eating size. We had a couple walleye spots there I’d be happy to point out on a map(as best as I can, it’s been 15 years!) in PMs where we just caught unlimited fish. I’d love to go back there someday."
6461284,doc,2020-07-07 14:33:00,143,I was there last August and had pretty much the same results as Phil.Tons of walleyes and some very nice pike. We struggled on the Lakers but they are there to be had.The new Slate Falls camp with be in a nice central location vs where we stayed with Winoga.
6461288,PhilTickelson,2020-07-07 14:41:00,84,"I couldn’t remember the name until you mentioned it, but we stayed at the Winoga camp. We trekked down to masque(mask?) lake a couple days, long boat ride with 15 hp motors, but man were there walleye down there!!"

The day we looked at the cabin I talked to a couple of guys who were staying in the Winoga cabin, they said the fishing on Carling was fair, but not outstanding. A lot of times you have to work a little harder to find walleye in a trout lake, I assume that was part of their issue. It is a nice lake, just like the rest of them in this part of the world."
