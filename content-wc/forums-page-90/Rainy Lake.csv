6460774,JohnWF,2020-07-06 07:30:00,129,Normally fish LOW around Sioux Narrows but that's not happening right now so going to try the US side of Rainy Lake in a few weeks. I'm usually a jig fisherman. Anyone got some pointers/advice for fishing Rainy at the end of July? Thanks. John

Your best bet is to take the boat ride through the Brule, and fish the East side of the lake. Make sure you have mapping software that shows the reefs. The walleyes will be on the reefs, but you may have to hop around a few reefs to find the biters. I always had the best luck with jig/shiners. I'm sure the lake will be more crowded than ever, but it's a big and beautiful lake."

6461936,trapsht,2020-07-09 10:13:00,28,"I always concentrated on the edges of reefs in 25-35 fow. The main thing is that the reefs are adjacent to deep water. A lot of guys will pull rigs along main lake drops, and also do well. I just prefer to jig."

My brother and I were lucky enough to get a houseboat for the last week of August. We had to rebook our Canada trip for next year. When we hit Rainy lake we are going use swimbaits and jigging raps mostly. Fish the rock humps around the blueberry island. Just keep fishing the humps till we find biters. If the wind blows we fish the island shorelines and the points Good luck out there and let me know how you do,"
