6460202,rockpt,2020-07-03 21:16:00,589,"Nice fish! How deep are we talking about and what speeds? I've got the muskie trolling down, but I've mostly jigged and bottom bounced for eyes."

6460458,oldlund,2020-07-04 20:49:00,209,I struggled majorly at whitefish bay for walleye. Fishing seemed substantially better past the smiley rock. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro

6460510,MN_Moose,2020-07-05 06:26:00,964,Have you vacationed in the area? Lots of beautiful places around there. I would prefer to be familiar with an area prior to purchasing any property. Also keep in mind that clearer water can mean effective fishing Dawn and dusk. There are fish there in Whitefish bay. It's just different habitat.
6460514,walleyecheek,2020-07-05 06:44:00,2231,"Its phenomenal smallmouth fishing. I've always done real well in the clear water for walleye (middle of the day) down by Last point, and Devils bay."
6460542,Bill Krejca,2020-07-05 07:47:00,6107,"There are a few potentially good walleye spots down in the lower, southern part of Whitefish. Some of the reefs and sunken humps across from Last Point can be OK, sometimes. Alfred Inlet used to have a few spots which produced walleye, also. I haven't been in there for a number of years, low water pretty much cancels the potential there. I was told a few years ago that the inlet was being netted, I don't know if this is still the case. Bill"
6460614,rockpt,2020-07-05 13:04:00,589,"I've fished Sabaskong, Miles Bay and points west for the last twenty years. I'd like to try Whitefish but the closed border makes that impossible right now. Looks like a beautiful area."
6460672,doc,2020-07-05 17:29:00,143,IM me and I can send you some spots up near Yellow Girl
6459378,rockpt,2020-07-01 18:46:00,589,"How's the walleye fishing in Whitefish Bay around Sioux Narrows? I hear the deep clear water is a different pattern than Sabaskong, for example."
6459410,Bill Krejca,2020-07-01 19:52:00,6107,"Most folks seem to head north from SN, in the area of Yellow Girl. I don't have any experience fishing in that p/o LOW, I'm told there may be some spots for walleye in Snake Bay, which is south a bit. Bill"
6459414,Obabikon,2020-07-01 20:03:00,2370,It is certainly different from Sab. Like Bill said... most people do the long boat ride up to some stained water.
6459460,rockpt,2020-07-02 00:02:00,589,How long of a boat ride are we talking about?
6459476,walleyecheek,2020-07-02 04:37:00,2231,just this morning heard of another resort on whitefish bay calling this year a wash.....with almost 100% of their business American. They are closed.
6459496,Bill Krejca,2020-07-02 06:12:00,6107,"One of my friends has been going up there for the last several years (not this year), I think he said around 20-25 miles, depending, of course from where you start. Bill"
6459508,MN_Moose,2020-07-02 06:32:00,964,From the bridge to the smiley face 45 minutes to an hour. The fishing makes it worth it.
6459534,Wall-i-Lama,2020-07-02 07:19:00,1524,Which resort?
6459544,Wall-i-Lama,2020-07-02 07:35:00,1524,"For numbers, most go out past smiley rock into the open lake section. With your boat about a 35 min ride. However, there are nice walleye in and around the whitefish Bay Area. I think sometimes they get overlooked as people race to the area NW of Sioux narrows. During July, the walleye in the clear lake whitefish Bay area tend to be either deep (over 40 foot) or surprise surprise surprise, very shallow. We don't even mess with the deeper fish. On overcast days they tend to move into shallow weedy areas. We've had good success in wind blown bays that have sand and weeds. Crawler harness pulled adjacent to these weed lines in 6 to 8 foot of water can hold real nice fish. We've caught a LOT of very nice walleye just a few miles from Sioux Narrows. You have to work at it to find these spots. The majority of the time we make the drive, but when conditions are right that area close to town can produce."
6459682,rockpt,2020-07-02 13:02:00,589,"Thanks for the replies. I'm looking to buy and there are a few nice properties in Whitefish around Sioux Narrows, but I'd prefer not to have to run 30-45 minutes for walleye."
