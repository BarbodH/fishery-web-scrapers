The news article did not give any details as to why the couple were allowed to cross the border in the first place, possibly tourist camp owners? No matter what, it looks like CBP is serious."

6460252,tv4fish,2020-07-04 06:27:00,2694,"Yes, it does. Rules are rules --- and they should apply to everybody........."
6460256,Eckohlt,2020-07-04 06:44:00,3685,I wonder if that cpl would have been ok if it was gas stop or a food stop?
6460260,Lmbkiller,2020-07-04 06:46:00,639,If this is a true story and they only got $1000 fine that's totally worth the risk to me for where I'm gonna go up there
