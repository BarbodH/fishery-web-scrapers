6462220,jambi,2020-07-10 11:47:00,504,"I know next year our 2020 group of 8, whose deposits are rolled over to 2021, isn't going to hold together. The replacements will give the guys that aren't going next year their deposit money directly. Or will there be outfitters say that ""this isn't allowed"" as deposits were specific to a certain individual ???? If they do I would cry BS. Maybe one of you website gurus can come up with a ""Refund Transfer Portal""....swapping refunds....Maybe at a discount"
6462258,tandm,2020-07-10 13:08:00,679,"I have three trips cancelled for 2020 and rolled to 2021. No names were asked for when I made the initial reservations, nor when we rolled them to 2021.Thinking back, other than the contact person, I've never been asked for names of others in my fishing party until I have gotten to the site, and,many times, not even then."
6462264,Juls,2020-07-10 13:12:00,13414,"They don't care if it's ""Bob"", ""Bill"", or ""George""....they only care about what the number of people in your group will be. Don't sweat it."
6462272,Obabikon,2020-07-10 13:49:00,2370,"I can't speak for all resorts, but we certainly do not care. In fact... if a group of 8 shows up with 7... I credit the guy who didn't make the trip's deposit towards the head of the group. He can refund it if he wishes, but just glad 7 people came."
