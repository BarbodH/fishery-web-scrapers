The largest was a 33 caught on a section of the English River north of Kenora. The guy who runs the resort pulled a 36 out of the same section a few years earlier. I caught a 32 inch walleye on the Canadian side of the Rainy River located on the Minnesota / Canadian border. The third was a 30 inch walleye on the English River section north of Ignace, Ontario. Over many years I've had several 27 to 29's on Lac Suel, Lake of the Woods and Rainy Lake, but the big ones have come from rivers."

My group all hold each other to a certain standard although I'm guessing a 1/4"" here and there has been added for fishing contests, but never more than that. A buddy caught a legit 49 1/2 "" muskie with me that we let him call 50"", but we measured it pretty closely and 49 1/2"", not 50""....but for the purposes of stories.....we cut him slack.I have seen a legit 32"" and 31"" caught as well.

By Pb is 14lbs 5oz 33Caught mid August on Lake Ontario trolling. https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/202...e5a418a270.jpgThe biggest I've seen in person was on my boat and it was 14lbs 9oz 32.5 from bay of Quinte. It was caught trolling on remembrance day 2018. https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/202...5269091530.jpgI consider anything above 10lbs a good fish and anything above 11 as a trophy. In the fall on Quinte a 10lb fish is almost average as even a 28 eye will weigh that. I will get a replica mount done when I break 15lbs Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

Skinniest adult Walleye you'd ever lay eyes on.In that span hundreds & hundreds (over 200 in a single day between 3 guys in the boat - multiple times) of barely legal (15"") or just under legal (14.75"") Walleyes have crossed the gunnels and gone back to be caught again.The biggest Walleye HYATT™ has personally seen from Mendota was a 11.5# sow taken in late October in 65' of water by the cousin of a (former) best fishing buddy who lives right across the park on a canal.(You know something went horribly wrong for HYATT™ to give up a fishing buddy with water access.)#1 Son (Freshwater Hall of Fame record-holder) did take a fantastic fish from Mendota in 2005 - prettiest silverback Walleye HYATT™ has EVER seen & even more remarkable for it being a male, not a female.(It displayed rainbow hues when caught that were still discernable by the taxidermist when he mounted it.) 27.625"" x 14.125"" & 8.48#Here's the proof of former life."

The 32.25"" came about 20 minutes after my 18 year old nephew boated a 30.5"" walleye, and on the next drift I thought I broke the 30"" mark only to find out it was 29.5"", and then the drift after that, I caught that 32.25"" walleye (my son caught a 26.5"" walleye in that 20 minutes too). It was the best 20 minutes of fishing in my life! We also caught about a dozen between 18"" - 22"" in that time span - it truly was unreal! My biggest in Minnesota (on the Mississippi River) is 26"", so I am still working on that 30"" Minnesota fish. I have fished a lot, and been fortunate to go on a lot of trips to Ontario. I know I lost some big ones when I was younger, but have been luckier (and maybe better) the older I get. I also can go A LOT more now than I used to when I was younger. FYI - All of those fish were let go, and I thank the guys that likely caught and released those fish for me to catch later. Catch and release works!"

I'm going to have a hard time beating that fish. On my favorite lake, St. Joseph, my biggest is 27.5. My buddy has a 28 there but I just can't catch him. Biggest northern there for me is 42. Last year was a good one with two 40+ in one day. Two memorable northern for me both came out of Upper Red Lake in MN. One ice fishing trip there I only got one fish. It was 36 or 39, I really don't remember, but it was fun getting out of an 8 hole. Last week I was there for a day jigging for walleye and got a 37 northern that made a lot of runs from the boat.

I had on a worm harness rig at the time, my sons reel got all tangled up.He hands me his rod, i hand him mine. Not 1minute later...BAMMM. He was in for the fight of his life. We did everything we could to bring her in and keep her alive and revive her, but it all failed. 32inches...the biggest anyone on any of our fly ins has ever caught.It was so hot that week and it was early in the week, so we had no way to save the fish for mounting.
