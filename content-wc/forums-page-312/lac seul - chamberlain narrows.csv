3044569,tv4fish,2014-07-30 06:53:00,2694,I do believe the same people still own it: (go down to the bottom to see the owners) FWIW: You aren't/weren't the Lone Ranger in the billing regard.http://www.lacseuloutposts.com/

3044729,Bitinlight,2014-07-30 08:07:00,95,I have stayed there 13 times beginning in 2008 and never seem to have a problem with billing. They always take care of us.

Sure there might be a glitch every now and then but Ken and Brenda will treat you right. Fishing and hospitality gets better year after year. We strictly fish for walleyes but have caught numerous 40""+ Northerns and a couple of 50"" muskies. Works great for taking your own boat or they have very nice boat/motor rigs for the camp. We did skip one year at camp and tried the houseboat routine but didn't like the loss of fishing time travelling to and from the area around and North of Chamberlain Narrows. Plan on going around the end of September again this year. Can't Wait!"
3045937,Bitinlight,2014-07-30 14:53:00,95,"First and foremost, the fishing is excellent. 2nd, the facilities are very comfortable. If you use their boat, the boats are 16 foot Lund Rebels with very comfortable pedestal seats powered by new Merc 30 four strokes. 3rd, Ken and Brenda, and staff of Sam and Betty, Garrett, and Brian all go out of their way to make everything right. You can't go wrong here."
