3018690,bensen,2014-07-21 21:19:00,155,"I upgraded to Onix locators & was wondering if I should upgrade the Navionics chip. Onix reads the SD/PREM/C3 Vol. 18 chip fine, but just wondering if a newer chip has more details & info for Lac Suel?"
3019874,CamoHunter,2014-07-22 09:42:00,363,"Where you headed to on Lac Seul? A newer navionics chip with sonar charts might ""pretend"" to show more data by adding more contour lines, but in reality, all it does is interpolate 1ft contour lines between the 10ft, 20ft, 40ft contours that are already extremely inaccurate. Thus, a newer chip isn't an improvement for Lac Seul yet at all. You can pull up the navionics website, and look at their depth data for Lac Seul. I can tell you first hand that the depth data is of little help, because it isn't accurate.The one thing that it is good for, is warning you of some of the dangerous rocks. Those seemed to be marked fairly decent. But you would already have those displayed on your older map chip, so no reason to upgrade yet.If you're fishing near Mahkwa lodge, I've started to create my own lake map with AutoCharts, and I'd be willing to share my map data. Since you have an Onix, you can upgrade the software on your unit, and get Autocharts Live on your depthfinder."
3021962,bensen,2014-07-22 21:20:00,155,Thanks. I will be in a house boat stay near Taylor Island so your mapping will not help me. I ordered a Zero Line Chart Card today & will make my own map on the Onix. I could not see a difference in the maps that Navonics had online to the cards I have. I will save my $ & not buy one.
3022233,jimirjr,2014-07-23 05:10:00,1149,Where is TAYLOR ISLAND in realtionship to CHAMBERLAIN NARROWS? Can't seem to locate it on the map...
3022577,CamoHunter,2014-07-23 07:38:00,363,"Wise choice benson.jimirjr, Taylor Island is about 11 miles SSW of Chamberlain Narrows. It is a fairly popular anchoring location for houseboats coming out of the town of Hudson.Taylor Island: 50.344020°, -92.005528°"
3040409,bensen,2014-07-28 23:13:00,155,Zero Line Card has arrived for the Onix. I am ready to try charting Lac Seul. 9 days to wait....
3041257,CamoHunter,2014-07-29 08:06:00,363,"Cool! Bet you're excited to get up there! Before you go, I'd watch a couple of the tutorial videos on youtube from Jason Halfen and Doug Vahrenburg. That way, you'll have some more familiarity with it when you're up in Canada, and don't have access to any help files or information.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5I1jCXKJqohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG0KNU06enEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_RQ-gZUaIgSome people have experienced some bugs, so while you're up there, be sure to save your boat tracks at the end of each day. That way, if autochart live doesn't make the map properly, or something doesn't quite work out correctly, you can still have someone use your boat tracks data to make a map with the AutoChart computer software."
3044185,bensen,2014-07-29 22:26:00,155,"Thanks. The Onix has been a learning curve, but it's all GOOD. I just could not buy old technology when I expected the best."
