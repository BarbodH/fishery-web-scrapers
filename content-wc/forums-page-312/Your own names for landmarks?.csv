3041321,tv4fish,2014-07-29 08:21:00,2694,"We have named a few islands after ourselves (last name) up on Lac Seul--- the very first year that we ventured out to what is now our usual area, I pointed out an island that looked like it would be a good spot - we tried it and had very good luck, so ""my"" island is always the first one we try. Through the years, my partners have suggested other islands, and if we have good luck at that island - it is named after the guy that suggested it. Oh, we have come up with some other ""interesting"" names for other spots also."
3046385,Hewhocookstomuch,2014-07-30 18:36:00,66,"In Lake Saint Joseph one of our hot spots is the Grassy Knoll. (Image 1) About twenty-five yards from the knoll there is a twenty to thirty feet drop off that runs well over two hundred yards with lots of walleye. When the water is high there will only be some blades of grass showing, really hard to find It is locate on a shelf that covers almost an acre. In low water several boulders are showing. This year, with the extreme high water, nothing was in sight. Fortunately this year I made a fish maker (Image two) We could spot this well over a quarter mile away and the marker remained on station for the whole week. I retrieved the buoy to use next year."

He had us fishing on Little Sand Banks and we made it back down to fish it at least 4 more times that week. We backtrolled all week and someone said it was like landing craft approaching the beach.....so the name OMAHA BEACH."
2940897,btyreprich,2014-06-26 20:23:00,1067,"In tAlking to lodge owners we have stayed with over the years, they always have a story to tell about new guests who heard that ""Chicago Point"" is a great spot. (Insert any name at all for Chicago Point) When the lodge owner tells the new guest there is no such spot as ""Chicago Point"", the new guests either get upset or flustered. They heard from their friends that that spot is a honey hole and to make sure you fish it. Now they don't know if they heard the name wrong or if their friend was teasing them. It's fun to find and name your own spots. The kids in our group especially like naming the spots and can usually remember exactly what was caught there when the spot was named."
2941801,AMPHIB206,2014-06-27 06:50:00,191,The buoy is between zig zag island and corkscrews island near Kenora. patricktjms was right on the money; did you look up the buoy marker on the internet; or are you a 34 DD ? lol

One of the worst smells ever. EVER.Fast forward to the evening when my fishing partner deposited a digested gallon of prune juice back at the cabin and the smell about made me heave and i would have traded the smell for the dead turtle in a heartbeat!Now that Rock is named ""Dan's ***"" because it smells similar.

2937441,Smallmouth Hunter,2014-06-25 19:48:00,84,Some of these are repeats from other posts but we have a bunch. Two bass island-got two bass on a single bait. The steps- a little bay that holds a bunch of walleye and has a set of steps that lead from the water to what seems like nowhere. The Iowa hole- a place we found out from some guys fron Iowa The honey hole- another walleye spot The eagles nest- it's an eagles nest that we troll by The gauntlet-a very small pass that leads to a large bay and is full of large pike and a monster Muskie. Naked mans house- a secluded house where a very big very hairy man came of out one day buck naked and walked directly into the lake for a swim. Loon island. Always a pair of loons nesting on this little island every year. The killer rock. Saw a boat hit this large rock one year and tear their boat up badly. It's just under the water and in a bad spot. The lunch rock. A place where we used to have shore lunch The green buoy. Raised a huge Muskie there one year. There are lots of green bouys but we all know we mean this one. The sandy beach. Another good walleye spot. All of these are on LOTW.

My cousin and I always called it skull rock and I think everyone in our group called it that for years for obvious reasons. Some in our group have a little bay over in LOTW that they call Million Dollar Bay also."

2935777,Pooch,2014-06-25 12:30:00,4619,"Every group has landmarks that usually have no ""real name"" in Canada, but are used by the group for a reference point that all can relate to.One of many for us is a small island on Lake Savant that many years ago had a dead gull hanging upside down in a scruffy dead pine, it's feet entangled in fishing line. Since then it's always been referred to as ""dead gull"".Another are a couple hidden back bays that many people don't even realize are there. Very pleasant little jewels on occasion so it was tagged as ""Mayberry"" while another similar hidden back bay a mile further north was tagged ""Mt. Pile"". Both referencing the Andy Griffith show towns.Everyone does it and it causes some confusion when trying to explain to an outsider what you are talking about. Cheap entertainment on a long trip.Pooch"

Heineken Reef - my brother-in-law's lunch spot where he was almost caught drinking a beer by the conservation officer2. Confrontation Point - my buddy got into an argument with another boater here. The other boater just pulled up to ""our"" spot and literally came within 3 feet of our boat at a fairly remote location. Why this guy had to come so close to us on a lake as big as Lac Seul is still a question I cannot answer.3. Tee Pee Point - on a sandy beach, some fisherman must have been bored and made a tee pee from like 20 fallen birch trees.4. Photo Rock - HUGE rock out in the middle of the lake that the kids climb on every trip for a photo opportunity. It's fun to get their pictures year after year and then compare how they are growing up when looking at the photo album."
