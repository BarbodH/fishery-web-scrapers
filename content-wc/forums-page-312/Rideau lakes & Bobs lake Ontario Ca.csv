3042337,Offshore24,2014-07-29 12:39:00,68,I fish here every year and stay on Upper (lil) Rideau lake. Next week I am planning a day trip to Bob's lake for pike. pike seem to be a little thin in Upper Rideau. I have fished big Rideau lake but not much and not for pike. Just looking to connect with people who fish these lakes. Anyone how the pike fishing is in any of these lakes? I am strictly catch and release on anything other than perch and bluegill.

That being said, we had one about 40 inches take a walleye jig on wolfe lake a couple years ago. The best southern Ontario pike fishing I have experienced has been in the Kingston-Wolfe Island area in toward Lake Ontario. Lots of weed beds and clear water. I've been wanting to try otter lake near Smiths Falls. It's said to have good bass and pike fishing. Has one free ramp."

3044465,Offshore24,2014-07-30 06:02:00,68,upper rideau does have large pike however they are scarce. 1-2 day on a good day. I am after #'s more than size. I go to a fly in lake for big pike. little sand lake seems to be hit or miss year to year on pike. Heard they catch alot through the ice on that lake. I have only seen 1 over 15# come out of lil sand. With as much perch and bluegills in these lakes you would think the pike population would flourish.
