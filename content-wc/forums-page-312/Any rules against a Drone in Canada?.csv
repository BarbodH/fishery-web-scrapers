3048649,Fisherman Ted,2014-07-31 12:00:00,461,We had a show filming here last month and they had a sweet drone. Got some killer shots hundreds of feet in the air. There are a few regulations on the books such as not over airports or residential areas plus you need a special permit if you are charging someone for the work/footage. But for personal use on a trip it shouldn't be an issue at all. -FT

3053065,NWO Guy,2014-08-01 19:24:00,2,"Here you go boys! Right from Transport Canada Website""Section 602.41 of the CARs states, no person shall operate an unmanned air vehicle in flight except in accordance with a Special Flight Operation Certificate (SFOC)""Definition of Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) Section 101.01 of the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs) states, ""Unmanned Air Vehicle"" means a power driven aircraft, other than a model aircraft, that is operated without a flight crew member on board. Unmanned air vehicles have been given many names, but are most commonly referred to as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), unmanned air vehicles, remotely operated aircraft or remotely piloted vehicles. Unmanned air vehicles may take the form of airships, aeroplanes or rotorcraft. Basically, they could be considered to be any unmanned aircraft that performs a useful mission and can be remotely controlled or has autonomous flight capability.How unmanned air vehicles are different from model aircraft ""Model aircraft"" means an aircraft, the total weight of which does not exceed 35 kg (77.2 pounds), that is mechanically driven or launched into flight for recreational purposes and that is not designed to carry persons or other living creatures. Although some micro unmanned air vehicles may weigh less than 35 kg, they are operated by research institutions and other organizations for non-recreational purposes.I would guess in any case, its at the discretion of the officer stopping you.There is a Case going on in Vancouver right now where a civilian drone was stupid close to landing jets at Vancouver's International Airport.http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/drone-f...tion-1.1788494Sure the bush is not a busy airport, just giving the info I found. Still it would be awesome to see your footage!"

3046129,SinOrSwim,2014-07-30 16:32:00,1528,"Not a drone that gets in the way of planes. Just a small drone you use a tablet or smartphone to control. Told my 9 year old we would try to make a youtube video of our trip when we get back and we want to take the little drone to get a little bit of footage. And by little, I mean little. lol It only flies for about 10 minutes on a charge. I just want to make sure there isn't some rule against them. Don't want to drop in in a bucket like we used to do with our potatoes."
3046329,515,2014-07-30 17:46:00,254,No rules against them that I know of and especially up there. I know lots of people with them and they fly them all over the place near the cities.
3047473,eyegator,2014-07-31 07:13:00,29,"That's very interesting. I just assumed they would be illegal. The Canadian government is pretty hands on with most everything, so I assumed they might not like that."
3047777,tv4fish,2014-07-31 08:11:00,2694,"Just a FWIW: The issue of using drones (aka UAV's) is a pretty hot topic in the surveying profession (land surveying) right now. The FAA is ""studying"" their use and will be issuing new guidelines for their use here in the US."
3047825,CKM,2014-07-31 08:23:00,3836,I vow to shoot down any drones over my air space.
3047865,grizzley,2014-07-31 08:29:00,2518,Just don't use it to try to fly drugs into a prison! Apparently someone just tried it.

3048305,zeebee,2014-07-31 10:07:00,1144,"Yup as opposed to government free anarchy in the USA......lol.Too funny. You are one of the most ""governed"" countries in the world but you cant see the forest. Drink your self stirred koolaid.Suppose if you have a gun that means you have liberty and freedom.....give the sheep a gun and the the herd thinks they are in control.Fact is the sheep can shoot each other but not much else. You see, the farmer has bigger guns, some with tracks and some with wings and, hes watchin/listening /reading your every move.. 2nd amendment kinda missed that that one didnt it?All is well cause your government is hands free....right?"
3048457,Skywagon,2014-07-31 10:50:00,1106,"zeebee, I think most of us probably agree with what you are thinking, but a lot was lost in the translation, you might want to consider a re-write. As much as I like to harp about the problems/inequities of both countries, this is probably not the place for that discussion."
3048465,bigwalleye1,2014-07-31 11:00:00,2632,Be careful what you wish for...
