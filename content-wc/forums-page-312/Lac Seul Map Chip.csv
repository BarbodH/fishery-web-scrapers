Navionics has one, but it is not detailed, and highly innaccurate. I decided to buy Humminbird Autocharts this year, and I was able import some boat tracks I had saved over the last two years, and create a map of the areas we had fished those years. This year, I added to the map after I returned from fishing.It was a huge benefit having a good lake map on the depthfinder this year, and knowing our boat position in relation to structure. Not to mention the benefit of mapping safe boat routes (anyone familiar with Lac Seul knows about the barely submerged, island rock structures that are a danger on that lake.)It was great having a map to go off of while up there this year!I've attached a few pictures of the map I was able to produce, for a few of the areas we fish.If anyone has boat tracks or sonar recordings saved, and want to see what a map would look like from those, send me a PM.If you want to know more about producing maps, lets have some open discussion so others can learn also."

3055569,cruiseforever,2014-08-02 19:48:00,177,I wonder what water level they use when making the maps. There can be a significant difference of depth.
3055585,CamoHunter,2014-08-02 19:55:00,363,"Summer levels on Lac Seul, really only fluctuate about 3-4 feet +/- in the area we fish. That's beside the point though, because no company has surveyed Lac Seul. The navionics contours are 10ft, 20ft, 40ft, 60ft. And even those are not accurate at all, and were not created from any kind of survey anyone has done in the last 30 years. That is why I'd like to put together data from anyone who is willing to share, and start generating our own lake map chip for the lake."
