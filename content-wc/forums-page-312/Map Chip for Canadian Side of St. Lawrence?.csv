I'm not opposed to buying a second card, but I don't want to have to switch out cards in the middle of the river while fishing. I'd like to see the entire river all at once."

The Navionics + contain all the datas that you wish to add on it until you reach the capacity of 2Gig. You will get SonarCharts also witch is a neat tool for the fisherman, free updats for a year and you can sale you're older chip or keep it. The Nav+ is a excellent for the St-Lawrence because it contains all the infos of the Gold and the Hotmap."
