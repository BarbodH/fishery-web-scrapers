He is an outstandiing operator I am sure you will do well. Please give us a report when you get back!!!! There is never much for Manitoba news on this forum and we could use more of it in my opinion. Also google Manitoba fishing forums maybe some intell there..... good luck"

I wasn't overly impressed with how they ran the camp, but we had a good time nonetheless. If you like big northern pike, this is the place to go. The walleye fishing could be great, but the guides didn't like fishing for them. In four days of fishing (actually three because of the weather), the three of us caught 10-12 pike over 40"" and dozens in the 30""-40"" range. Decent cabins and food."
3054985,Guest,2014-08-02 13:52:00,0,Went to Silsby in early August last year. Too much warm weather so the fishing was slow everywhere. Maybe this year is cooler so it will be better. Real good chance to get lots of big pike and walleye if the water temp cooperates.
