3045297,Skyraptor,2014-07-30 10:17:00,291,What are the hours at the duty free store? I take it they sell both beer and hard booze. Is it Canadian beer that you can get or US brands or beer? If Canadian is there a website listing what they carry?
3045385,SinOrSwim,2014-07-30 10:49:00,1528,"You still have to pay duty though, correct? You can take your one case across but if you take more you have to pay the fee."
3045665,1/4 oz Jig,2014-07-30 12:36:00,90,I believe they have both. Since there was a long to cross the border. I jumped out of the car ran in and ordered a case of kokanee. Hopped out of the car after the tracks and picked it up. Didn't even have to park. Since it was a quick in and out for me I did see labatt and bud light but i'm sure they have more. I paid 20$ for a 24 pack of kokanee. I'm sure there's a phone # to call and see what they stock. They also sell hard liquor too I saw a sign that was advertising 2 750ml of either crown royal or canadian club for $35 i don't remember which one though.
3045689,1/4 oz Jig,2014-07-30 12:40:00,90,"Correct, If you have one case with you already and go in the duty free store and purchase another case you would have to pay duty at the border. It would still only cost the $18 or $20 in the duty free store though."
3050121,Glenman12,2014-07-31 19:52:00,762,"maybe Im missing something here but if you have to pay the duty on any liquor you are over, no matter if you bought it in your home state or the Duty Free in IF, what is the savings?"
3050329,1/4 oz Jig,2014-07-31 20:47:00,90,I only buy kokanee at the duty free store. I can't find it in the chicagoland area. $20 at the duty free store beats the $40 it would cost at the beer store in ft frances or dryden. We buy our booze and our other beer in Illinois.
3050673,Skyraptor,2014-08-01 04:45:00,291,Yup it is a hard beer to find in the states. Been looking and found a liquor store in Duluth that sells it. So everytime I go watch my son play football for UMD I pick up a case or two. Good Stuff!
3054209,NARDA 1,2014-08-02 08:13:00,636,Do they still hide the skier on the label?
3040649,Jatar,2014-07-29 05:14:00,169,"We will be crossing at I-Falls, can someone explain the procedure for purchasing beer via the duty free ? Thanks !"
3040657,Whopper,2014-07-29 05:19:00,340,"Walk in, pick out what you want and take to the counter. You then pay for it and the cashier will give you a receipt. You'll then leave the store without your purchase and someone will meet you about a hundred and fifty yards up the street at a little shack on the right before you head across the bridge and hand you your purchase. Easy peasy"
3040825,Jatar,2014-07-29 06:23:00,169,where do you walk in at ? Border Bob's ?
3040921,camp chef,2014-07-29 06:49:00,915,There is a seperate duty free store. Not border bob's. You will see the signs.
3041073,stjoeguy,2014-07-29 07:34:00,979,"Here's a picture & map:http://www.lakesnwoods.com/images/LNWa%20233.jpghttps://www.google.com/maps/place/Du...5e1d0af4?hl=en The shack where you pick up the liquor is very small, on your right, right after the railroad tracks and just before the bridge. DO NOT get distracted by the cute girl in shorts passing out flyers right before the tracks or you'll miss the shack, cross the bridge and go through customs. At that point your only options are to get in line to drive back into the US and do it all again or park the truck, explain to customs on both sides of the border what you're doing and walk back and forth across the bridge to retrieve the liquor. Don't ask how I know this."
3041345,tv4fish,2014-07-29 08:29:00,2694,"The info. ^^^ is very good. Another thing to point out - be prepared for this little ""stop"" to take some time -- get in line at the register as soon as you get inside the building. Hopefully you will know what you want to get. If your rig has to pull over to stop and wait for you, you may have a problem getting back in line with your truck/boat rig (hopefully, someone will be kind and let you pull back out into the traffic flow). You may run into the same problem when you pull over at the pickup building. (OH -- Crown Royal is always a good buy)."
3041953,bigwalleye1,2014-07-29 10:45:00,2632,"The cute girl is a relative term, and she only works midweek if it's sunny. Other times, it's the ""average"" girl from the Falls, and THAT ain't sayin' much."
3042401,Hawkfan,2014-07-29 12:48:00,237,"Not these girls specifically, but this ""relative"" comment usually holds true depending on if you are on your way up to camp or the way home."
3043665,pale ryder,2014-07-29 19:10:00,1937,"To me it isn't worth the hassle.Just bring a bottle of good whiskey or rum from home and buy beer in Canada,"
3044753,Bitinlight,2014-07-30 08:13:00,95,"Booze prices at the duty free seem to be equal to or better than what you can get in Wis. or Mn. Beer usually about $18 per case give or take some, depending on kind. These prices are far better than what you pay in Canada."
