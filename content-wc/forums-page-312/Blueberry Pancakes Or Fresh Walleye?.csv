What a dilema. I wish my job gave me such demanding choices to make. Hope everyone had a good trip or will have a good trip this year."
3049521,jimirjr,2014-07-31 16:52:00,1149,IMHO... YOU WIN with either...
3049553,@Lunker,2014-07-31 16:56:00,835,Whassamatta wit both?
3050009,bigwalleye1,2014-07-31 19:20:00,2632,"Lunker's got it right. Asking which one is like asking ""Ginger or Maryann?"" Same answer...BOTH."
3051449,Mike Borger,2014-08-01 09:36:00,1554,A few years back while guiding I did a shore lunch for my clients and mistakenly used blueberry pancake mix as a batter. The fish came out tasting like giant crispy blueberry fritters. I thought it was hideous but they liked it.Best of both worlds.
3051649,Golden Eagle,2014-08-01 10:26:00,2642,"On the morning I left home on my last fishing trip I was in my garden at first light, picking: blueberries, tomatoes, sweet corn, okra, cukes, and green peppers for our stay up yonder. I like fresh blueberries on top of my pancakes, rather than in the batter."
3051705,tv4fish,2014-08-01 10:36:00,2694,I would say it depends on what time of day we are talking about ????????
3051785,JayM5209,2014-08-01 11:08:00,1050,"Unless it's a solo trip, I'd say flip a coin. Heads goes to get the 'eyes and tails goes berry pickin'. See ya in the cabin about 5:00 for drinks and dinner!"
3052969,forgop,2014-08-01 18:51:00,880,Too many Crown Royal bombers before making the batter Mike?
