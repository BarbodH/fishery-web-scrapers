I just want to be prepared for this so I am looking for things like what to bring and not bring?,Is there a good portable fish finder/depth finder for a reasonable price?,We are going in August of so what lures and colors work at that time?,Black flies?ect...Any help would be awesome.Looking forward to getting to know you all and thanks for any help."

Bugs wont be too bad in August, more than likely no black flies. I would take the normal walleye gear, once you pack your tackle go through it again and cut it in 1/2, you will still be bringing too much. There are others on here that will give you some good advice on tackle and such as I mostly bass fish in NW Ontario, never use electronics and still catch more walleye than I care to every year. Enjoy your trip to Severn, it's an awesome lake!"
3051953,DD1700,2014-08-01 11:56:00,5,Thanks for the reply.So I take it you have been there?Any pointers or hot spots?Oh and also there arn't any smallies in Severn or am I wrong.Would love it if there were but proly too far north?
3051977,Aaron-IN,2014-08-01 12:02:00,500,"Yes I've been there but it was over 20 years ago, my dad took me on a trip there when I was in college, the walleye fishing was outstanding, I don't recall catching any smallmouth. Sorry, if you do a search on this site you should find some posts on Severn."
3053337,DocRollo,2014-08-01 20:48:00,8,"I would take a portable sonar. We have been fishing fly ins for 40 yrs and would not be without them. We have a large group and all of us own Eagle brand portable sonars. Several members have tried others but we all ended up with Eagle. Bugs wont be an issue on the water but skeeters at night in camp will be. Spend $10 and get a bug net for over your bunk. Eddie has great cabins but the mosquitoes still get in. Best $10 you will spend. White, yellow, lime green are common colors. Eddie can tell you specifics about Severn. Each lake can have a color preference. As much as I hate to ever use bait, in august you may find that minnows will increase your catch rate. I have gone with Eddie a couple of times now and he is definitely a good outfitter. Ask Eddie if he can connect you with someone who has gone to Severn before and they can provide more information."
3053401,Guest,2014-08-01 21:23:00,0,Give Eddie a call. Meh can give you all the info you need. He.will have maps with all the hot spots on Severn and the guys that are going out when you go in will give you all the hot spots too! Give them a call they will hook you up! Pun intended
3055593,DD1700,2014-08-02 19:56:00,5,Thank you for the info I am very grateful.This is gona be an experience for sure!!!
