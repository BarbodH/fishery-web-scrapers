On this trip we were accompanied by two adults bringing their children to Canada for the first time. Will they return? The 12 year old caught a 26.75"" Walleye and a 39"" Northern mixed in with many other fish. The 22 year old caught a 29"" Walleye. These fish are still swimming. Our first night out my 18 year old brought a 46"" (approx.) Musky to into the net on a Rattle Trap fishing for Small Mouth. The beast eventually escaped the net- never having left the water and therefore, as unharmed as it gets. Unfortunately my musky hunting 17 year old (3 years into it now) did not get a Musky. On the one cast that resulted in a follow (our last day), he took his sweatshirt off prior to doing the figure 8- only to see a giant Musky at his lure while his hands were stuck in his hoodie. Three years of frustration came out at that moment from a boy that is always happy. His sadness was palpable when he said ""I'm so disappointed"" with a quivering voice. A tough moment but a character builder for sure. Initially we were uncertain about Lake of the Woods (I assumed it would be crowded) and about an island- boat to lodge. Turns out we loved the location- part for its central location to all kinds of great fishing and part because of the surprising remoteness of it. We saw very few other boats. Jared and his staff were as good as we've experienced in Canada. Jared was always willing to help and give suggestions. The food was plentiful and fantastic. The guide (Jason) put us on Walleye immediately. In addition, Jason was incredibly patient with the two first-timers. Teaching them to Jig and even giving his rod to the 12 year old to reel in a fish. This was the fourth trip up for my sons and I. Four different lodges, four different lakes. We do like to try new places. Obabikon is the one place we would certainly return to."

I have fished 40+ years, many times solo but my fondest memories are those where my kids were front and center.When they were young I recall days on the lake when I never even picked up a rod, instead catering to their needs and watching the expressions when they hooked into one. Never regretted it for a moment. Cherish those memories.My son (now 24) and I leave in a couple of weeks for 7 days on LOTW (remote island boat-in too). Funny, during the winter Im lucky if he calls me once a week.... during the days building up to our departure, I get a call every day. Ill have to tell him to leave the sweatshirts at home.Hats off to Obab too, resort operators like that need to be acknowledged."
3044833,emma17,2014-07-30 08:27:00,436,Zeebee- you're so right about the special time w kids. The hours (maybe days) spent tying and untangling lines was the sowing of this fruitful field. My boys are 17 and 18 so we don't spend a whole lot of quality time together any more. Although being on the boat all day is the highlight of our trip - the drive to and from as well as 3 meals a day together provides quality time we'd never get otherwise. Best of success to you and your son on your upcoming trip.
