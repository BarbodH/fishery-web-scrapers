My dad took my brothers and me on such memorable trips to each of these lodges over the years, but we haven't been in several years now. I'm looking to introduce my 9 year old son to the fantastic fishing trips I remember and I'd like to take him to one of these places since I've been there before, but can't seem to find any recent posts. Anderson's has openings for 2015 but SWW is already booked for 2015 which would suggest SWW is the better spot. Would be grateful for any recent information about either spot or another that would be similar. Thanks in advance for your help."

3042449,Perch56,2014-07-29 13:00:00,17,"My wife and I love SWW for several reasons.The guides are very good at putting you on fish and helping as much as you need. I am always picking up a new tip or two.....if I can only remember them. All of the guides share information nightly about what has worked that day (usually around a 30 minute roundtable discussion) which is very different from alot of resorts. The guides help you to take real quality pictures of the big ones and even give you ones that they take.The quality of the fishing is awesome. We have caught 3 29"" walleyes and lot of 25 to 28's. We have seen several 30's and a couple of 31""s caught in nearby boats....so they are there. My wife and my Mom have both caught 28.5's that were over 10lbs because they were so fat. Notherns are accidental but we have still caught a 41 and a couple of 40's and several 37-39's. Quanity of smaller fish has never been a problem.Shore lunch is done a choice of three ways and my wife really likes the baked option. The guides don't take too much time to cook so that you can get back to fishing fast.Suppers have never disappointed us. The best is Sunday night with turkey and all the trimmings. The only trouble is that I add a couple of pounds.They keep the boats and motors and elecctronics up to date and we have never had a problem. The cabins are clean and kept up to date.The only trouble is they are tough to get reservations at times because people never give up their time slots. (Now you know the rest of the story about why.) This spring we missed our regular time due to late ice out and could not get back in until the end of September. Fortunately we still have our dates in May for next spring and hope for a ice out that is a few days earlier. They do keep a wait list. Because we could not get in this spring due to the late ice out we went to a fly in place just to compare and found there to be no comparison. Its hard to believe but SWW actually told me that we might get a few bigger fish at the other place! When is the last time a resorter told you that? We did get one bigger one for the trip to the other place but the overall quality of SWW was much better. People will say that the trip can be done cheaper.....and it can it be cheaper at another place if you want to cook and run the boat and get added costs for using more bait and gas. Being a accountant I sometimes compare costs and it is amazing how quick those extra costs at other places that are buried in the fine print add up. SWW's price only adds sales tax which I like. I never feel like they hold back on taking you to the best fishing spots to control gas costs and have only nearly run out of bait once. (We stayed on nealy the same spot all day and had one of those once in a lifetime fishing days.) We appreciate the quality of the trip and think its well worth any added costs. We are not related to the owners or staff in any way.I worked at a resort in northern Minnesota for several years in high school and so at look at how the operations are run with a critical eye. Before we found SWW we had stayed several other places (never Andersons) and none have come close to SWW.You just can't beat SWW."
