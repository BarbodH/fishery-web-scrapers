Cedar has huge muskies but not the numbers that the chain has.Both have good small mouth fishing, I think it is better on Cedar.I have always stayed at Clarks Resorts on both the chain and on Cedar, and they run great resorts."
3028401,lundmike,2014-07-24 20:31:00,39,"silvery moon lodge is a great place. Lots of bass, musky, pike, pickerel. I go every year for a week in Julyhttp://www.duenorth.net/silvrymoonlodge/"
3042697,Esox2hart,2014-07-29 13:57:00,3,"Check Out Cliff Lake. Its right across from Cedar and has great smallie and Muskie fishing. Lots of Number and few big ones to boot! Go to cedar for a day and fish for some giants, but not as much action. Lakers are a fun bonus in August also!www.Lostbayresort.com"
3013361,bigcreekdad,2014-07-20 07:21:00,74,"I fish the French River 3-4 times a year, but every few years I take one trip somewhere else. Thinking of NW Ontario in August. Looking for an American Plan Lodge, with good boats (I won't be taking my Alumacraft Magnum 165 ( I think I'll fly to Int'l Falls and drive from there). I've been to Crow Rock Lodge on LOTW and Fireside Lodge on Little Vermillion. Crow Rock produced my only 50"" muskie, and Fireside had some of the best smallmouth fishing I've ever had. Both places had excellent accommodations and great food, and I'd highly recommend them. However, I want to make all these non French River trips to new places. Muskie is my #1 objective, but I usually try to get some smallmouth action as well. Not really looking for walleye, as I get my fill of them on the Ftench. I'd also like a smaller lake (vs LOTW) and not to have to take a guide, but that's not mandatory. I'm quite used to fishing by myself, but I would be leary of this on a lake the size of LOTW (where I did take a guide). Based on some posts on this board, I've looked at the Indian chain a bit. So, give me your thoughts, and thanks in advance."
3014145,bobbylfishermon,2014-07-20 11:56:00,241,"bigcreekdad, My wife and I have been staying at Indian Lake Lodge for 15 years, and love the ""CHAIN"" they have a American Plan, really good camp boats,really clean modern cabins, it's a flat layout as far as the camp goes and the owners are sweethearts and aim to please. As for fishing, lots of musky, lots !! Tons of walleye, good smallies, good northern, and some Lakers. They have a web site Indian Lake Lodge.com and you can contact them there or call them at 1-888-227-2040, enjoy, we do !!!!"
3014305,NARDA 1,2014-07-20 12:41:00,636,"Check out www.birchdalelodge.com on Eagle Lake, has the Muskies you are looking for. American plan is unique because you order off a menu instead of everyone having the same thing, if you want steak every night you can do that! Good reliable boats and nice cabins, bar in the lodge. I will be up there the last week of August for my 26th year. Owners name is Marcel 807-227-5262. Terry"
3016850,Guest,2014-07-21 10:48:00,0,"try Lake Despair Lodge. The folks there run a great lodge and campground. Good boats and motors. good prices all around. My buddies and I have been going there for 30 years. You can fish without a guide if you have a decent map and pay attention. Walleyes aplenty, smallies if you hunt them, and as many northern as you could want. good fishing."
3016882,IaDave,2014-07-21 10:57:00,476,Even though it is on LOW it is on bay east of the main body of water. I have been there 3 times by myself and have never felt uncomfortable fishing the bodies of water within 10 miles of camp. Everything about the camp would fit what you are looking for. It is really known as a place to catch a large Musky and there are many smallmouth around. One of their guides will even take you out for a day at no charge.
3018666,Painter1,2014-07-21 21:10:00,26,"I don't want to hijack this thread but I am also looking for a place to fish for 5 days in mid August. We also want to do an American plan, but we would probably prefer a guide for a couple days. We aren't Muskie fishermen, but love to catch walleye, bass and Pike. We also enjoy a single day fly-in. Our last trip was an outpost and we were very disappointed with the slow fishing. Really looking for numbers over trophy size. I will check out the suggestions already made, but would welcome any additional thoughts. Thanks for your help"
3022513,wishinfishinmn,2014-07-23 07:14:00,52,I am heading up to the Chain next week.Love the muskie and walleye fishing.My 5th grader wants to find some smallies.Where? Haven't had much luck in our 5 years there.SOS
3023929,bobbylfishermon,2014-07-23 14:05:00,241,"I fish the rocky points and reefs in Bladder and Cobble,and Boulder , start at the second set sticks and go south from there, slow roll spinner baits, fish 5in. swim baits, or deep diving jerk baits. There are some really big smallies down there, but really, you never know whats going to hit, because there's everything that swims in the chain down there !!! Good Fishing !"
3024345,ftfarms,2014-07-23 15:42:00,444,I would say cedar lake by perrualt falls. We stay at cedar point resort at the center of the lake thay do American plan. I think ray would guide you for a day or two. Cedar lake you really don't need one. It's my favorite smaller lake in Ontario. We fish there and lotws. If you change and want to go to lotws stay at obabikon Jared will put you on musksy and smallmouth. Obabikon bay and miles bay are nothing short of awesome for pike musky walleye and smallmouth we've fished all over northwest Ontario and have not found any where close. But this is my experience out of over 35 trips
3024793,Danbear,2014-07-23 18:17:00,72,I have to second NARDA1 Birch Dale Lodge has become a second home to me and my gang. Don't let the size on the map fool you. Many of the best Muskie haunts are in the west arm and there are plenty of bays and islands to try. One of the better Muskie spots in August is Strawberry Island which is 3 minute boat ride from the lodge. The American plan is fantastic as you order off the menu you will never leave hungry. We are leaving in 23 days for our 7th year.
