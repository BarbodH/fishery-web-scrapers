Not really too concerned about going in there blind, but if anyone has any info on this lake I'd love to hear about it!Long shot at best especially on short notice but hey you never know.Thanks guys."

3043425,Mike Borger,2014-07-29 17:59:00,1554,"Contour map would be GREAT, thanks Adam!!I knew it was Craig Lake, was looking at a topo today.Basic info from Steve Dale, the lake has fewer but larger walleyes than Medhurst and there is the odd big pike. Someone fluked off a 51""er a few years back. Course I'd never expect that but it's nice to know the lake has the ability to produce them."
3043593,adempsey,2014-07-29 18:41:00,963,OK. I'll email it to you shortly =)

I had just turned 17. I was hooked for life. I still have Air-Dales flyer for that season . Cost of the trip , with tax was $107 . The camp was a 2x2 frame with plywood sides and a milky colored tarp on top. The camp was way back in the woods ,behind the present cabin. Don Massey flew us in . He was their cheif pilot for years . I decided then and there I was going to buy a property , build a house and then I would go on fly in trips every year. I have been on 38 fly ins and 14 other trips to Ontario, since I got my house built . I kept my word. LOL. BY Dad's first cousin , who took me along , caught a 42 inch pike on that trip. Have fun!"
