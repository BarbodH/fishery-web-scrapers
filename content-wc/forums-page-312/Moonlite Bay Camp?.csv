That said, We stay across the bay at Mylie's Place and I can vouch for the area fishing. We fish the area a week for the walleye opener and a week in September. It's is excellent fishing for all species anytime if you can fish in varying conditions as fish locations change with the seasons. The resort grounds are well kept, nicely taken care of lodge and cabins, The docks are in good condition and appear to have newer boats and motors. If you are looking for American Plan that won't break the bank and still be in a great fishing area, you can't go wrong with Moonlight Bay."
