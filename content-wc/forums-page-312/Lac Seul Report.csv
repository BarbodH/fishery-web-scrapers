The fishing in the last week has been,for us,a wind driven bite.The first day we fished we stayed close to Evergreen and had a hard time finding bigger fish.After that day we fished Mc Kenzie and then main lake spots.We got on a hot bite on the Little Sand Banks with the wind blowing in.We couldn't catch a walleye under 18 inches that morning.Lot's of 20 to 23 inch fish.When the wind died off the bite really slowed down.We searched for the fish out to 35 ft of water and just couldn't find them.The bite was in 8 ft of water.We found walleyes on sand flats and rock bars/reefs.The walleyes are on smelt as we had numerous fish puke up smelt in the boat.The depths varied we caught them in 8 ft.,10 to 13 ft.16 ft.,26 ft and 32 ft. The smaller fish seemed to be deeper.Biggest walleye so far is 24 inches.The fish seem to be in small schools or pods.When the wind is blowing they seem to move up in pulses.Half a crawler on a spinner behind a bouncer has been the best,leeches running a close second.Bill"

Glad to here you were able to get in at another resort! Are you leaving Saturday the 23rd? that is the day we are coming up.. Have you done any jigging yet or are you still dragging around them dakota riggs....aka bottom bouncers and spinners ... lol Have you marked any big schools of smelt?"
3038785,btmbncr,2014-07-28 14:18:00,492,BigtimeelectricWe have seen some large schools of smelt in 2 spots the wind was blowing in.The water is really dirty and bouncers with spinners with big hammered nickel blades and glow or Chartruese beads with a half a crawler or a leech have been the ticket. We got into them on a sand flat in 7.3 to 8. feet of water.Had some doubles on.Eaters with fish up to 24 inches. Had an engine warning light go ff on the Suzuki.Headed to Dryden in the morning to get it looked at.Bill

Hopefully the fix for your motor does not keep you off the water to long or drain your Kokanee fund by too much."
