556968,Jig A Lowe,2006-05-08 13:24:00,87,"I certainly don't condone drunk driving and I would be the first to admit that ""there but for the grace of god, go I"". But, I don't understand what the threat is to allow a person thru with a DUI if he is not in his car and not driving. I can't imagine why anyone would allow this person to drive their car once in Canada and for what reason if there are other ""eligible"" drivers. I have been going to Canada for over 50 yrs. and have made about 80-90 border crossings during that time. We have never had much of a hassle going in. But, except for just one trip with the guys, all of my trips have been with just the wife or family. Obviously, they really target groups of guys. Probably because there is a greater chance that if you have a group of 5-6 guys on a fishing trip that one of them may have a DUI in their background at some point. For things to change, I believe that the resort owners and those responsible for Canada's toursim industry will need to complain about the treatment of Americans trying to enter Canada. Just my two cents."
556970,Guest,2006-05-08 13:33:00,0,Tell the offender to stay home unless he can meet and follow all the paper work that is required for DWI offenders to cross. Play by the rules....if he had played by the rules before he wouldnt be in the bind he is now. Cheaters never win and winners never cheat!!!!!
556984,jigman 2003,2006-05-08 14:57:00,981,The reason they don't allow people in with DUI's is the same reason they don't allow people in who have committed other felonies. They don't want felons coming into their country.
556995,Guest,2006-05-08 16:27:00,0,"""To All the DUI Inquirers"" Ogdensberg, New York is no place to spend a weekend when you planned to be in Quebec boating walleye with you buddies. It is foolish and terribly short-sighted to try to enter Canada if you have a U.S. arrest record (I use ""arrest"" intentionally"") Investigate the waiver and do the paperwork for Rehabilitation. I spent a terrible weekend in Ogdensburg, NY in 2001 (Pre-911!)after being rejected for a 1983 DUI which was disposed of back then without a conviction after a year's probation. All they need is a Social Security # and/or DOB and you are toast. I was allowed in on Monday (for $200 Canadian). For all the slick dudes out there who are convinced they'll BS their way in: I look like Wally Cleaver, had no sunglasses or facial ticks and am honest in appearance and speech. Save yourself the nightmares and respect their laws"
557004,cunn6776,2006-05-08 19:49:00,8,"Thanks for all of the input. Due to our lack of investigating, we didn't find out about the DUI law until January of this year. Our group member received his DUI seven years ago and it is his only convection. We did talk to the Canadian embassy and border services, but they both thought that we would not get the needed paperwork (pardon) back in time for our trip at the end of May. With all of the deposits already in and plans already set, we have no choice but to hope for the best. I don't have a problem with Canada and their laws or playing by the rules, but sometimes situations are out of our control and you just have to roll the dice. Thanks."

Just my two cents. DUI is a Federal (Criminal) offense in Canada. No one with a criminal record can cross the border. No Canadian can get into the US with a record and no American with one into Canada. Pretty simple. It is not poor 'treatment of Americans.' The same rules apply to everyone. Go through the proper channels if you have arecord and if you're considered no threat they'll let you in."
556872,cunn6776,2006-05-04 12:00:00,8,"Going into Canada for the first time this year. One in our group got a DUI six years ago. I know all the rules and laws, don't need help with that. But from reading all of the past posts, is there anybody out there that gets in without any hassle. From reading everything, there has to be a lot more getting in, than turned away. Give me some positive outlook. Thanks."
556874,Guest,2006-05-04 13:30:00,0,"You have a chance at getting through. But have a plan... what will you do if this person is refused entry. Do all of you cancel the trip you have been planning for the better part of a year? Do you leave this one person at the nearest hotel for the week while all of you take your planned trip? I know you want someone to say your chances are good at getting through, and easing your thoughts of a problem. But the enjoyment on the drive up will diminish as you near the border. Anyone that knows about this DUI will start to get nervous. The border guards are trained to pick up on these things. Does everyone in you party know about this person? Good luck with whatever you decide to do. Greg @ Agate Bay Lodge"
556876,Guest,2006-05-04 14:23:00,0,Do not drive this person's vehicle through the border and definetly don't let him drive. Chances are they will run the plate on your vehicle and maybe look at the drivers license of the person driving. Make sure everyone takes their sunglasses off so they can get a good look at you. Answer all their questions and you should get through.
556877,jigman 2003,2006-05-04 14:35:00,981,"You're nuts if you try to cross with this guy, unless you're all willing to turn around and go back home. Have him do it the right way, either that or make him drive himself in his own car so he can just drive home when he gets refused entry."
556880,Guest,2006-05-04 15:50:00,0,"I share fish for foods opinion. Certainly do not use his vehicle or have him driving. Sunglasses and hats off, be courtious. We have never been turned around in 9 tries."
556891,Guest,2006-05-04 22:01:00,0,If I were you... I'd call the border and ask. Or check with customs.. Your buddy might want to apply for a pardon.. Unless he has priors.. I'm not sure if he would be eligible. Good luck...
556913,hammer_gold_spinner,2006-05-05 12:04:00,151,Don't try to get thru with a DWI on your record without going thru the process of getting the OK from Immigration Canada. Rumor has it that every so many vehicles will recieve an extensive check at all border crossings. You may be the one. Respect the rules that Canada has the same way we would expect Canadians to respect our rules. Mac
556915,Guest,2006-05-05 12:17:00,0,It happens very rarely you get turned back. And it would only be that person. And usually if you tring to hide it and the person is being a prick that day. Be courrtous and nothing will happen. The easiest way is to get the pardon.
556939,Skyraptor,2006-05-06 14:41:00,291,"We have a person in our group and what we did was make sure everyone has a current passport and the only person that was asked for a id besides the passport was the driver. Our border crossing person was nice as we had 8 guys and had alcohol over what we could bring in and we told this person what we had and she let us go w/o paying any duty. Be polite, have everything in order and ready before approaching the border and you shoudl be fine."
556958,MoWalleyeguy,2006-05-08 09:36:00,409,"Last year our group was asked to park and come into the customs and Imigration office (because of 12 year old that was with us)... during the 40 minute wait we saw 2 different people sitting there, 1 was very upset. Come to find out both were being turned back and were working on ways to get back home. Both of there groups left them at the border. Both had prior DUI's and were not being allowed in. I talked to one of them and he said he had gone through several times before with no troubles but this time they ran his ID (he was a passenger). They wouldnt allow any waivers or gave him any options to get through. I felt bad for the guy since he told me the dui was years ago and he hasnt had a sip of any alcohol since. The worst part was he was 500 miles from home and had to have his wife drive up and get him. Guys have you stuff in order BEFORE you go. Even us having a 12 year old with us... we had ALL documents including notorized letter signed by the mother saying she gave permission to go through and we still got stopped and checked. Also, dont try to sneak ANYTHING in acrossed the boarder as we saw several people being spot checked... (everything taken out of the vehicles and searched). They are making it more difficult to cross every year we go. This will be my 26th year going across and I am expecting it to be even tougher. We have Passports and everything we have is clear so hopefully we fly through this time."
