556711,FlyBoy,2006-04-29 15:17:00,631,"Thanks for the info guys - it sounds like maybe a BB gun would be a little less trouble than a pellet gun. And one of the other posters was right, I was asking for entertainment value on a house boat trip - not for a 9 year old, but we are all kids at heart. A couple of my buddies were picking on me in this thread as well :) I didn't mean to start the ""If you don't like my country go somewhere else"" fight. Some of you guys need to go fishing or post less. Thanks to those that helped. -John"

556694,FlyBoy,2006-04-29 00:26:00,631,"Is it legal to cross the border into Canada with one of the above mentioned? I don't know how they are treated? (I know about real guns, I've gotten the permit for them before, I'd feel a little foolish getting one for a pellet gun!) -John"
556695,wiggle,2006-04-29 06:52:00,400,What do you plan on using the pellet gun for??? Where??? Deer are pretty hard to take down with a pellet gun!!! Brad
556696,Thunderstick,2006-04-29 07:11:00,35,"If it's so important to shoot, bring a rubber band and some paper clips."
556698,Guest,2006-04-29 08:25:00,0,I don't think a pellet gun is considered a gun!! I don't know if it will keep the bears away.DL
556699,guidedfishing,2006-04-29 09:39:00,531,"A pellet gun is considered a gun, and I would think you have to have a pretty important reason to go through the additional paper work to bring it in? I've taken rifles in several times not that big of a deal, paper work in triplicate, and $50.00 for a year long registration. Is a pellet rifle worth that? If it is a pellet pistol you are considering don't even try. good luck GF"
556701,Guest,2006-04-29 09:47:00,0,"Just stash it where they won't find it and don't worry about it. If you are not a long haired tattoed freaky/druggy looking person, the Cunucks won't bother you."
556702,troutaholic,2006-04-29 09:47:00,827,"Last time that we took an international flight, we treated them as guns, but were not required to. I think that Canada defines a ""gun"" as an object capable of delivering an explosive charge (been several years). Just for those who are un-informed, there are multiple groups that help and host airgun competitions for youth (and adults). It is a great way to get youth involved in outdoor activities.....so instead of ripping on the person, try to give some viable information. Perhaps he is taking his 9-year old son into Canada for the first time and wants his son to really enjoy his time.....nothing wrong with that!!! Not trying to be negative, but people ask questions to find the answers....not to be ridiculed!!!!! Just Rip Lips and Keep a Tight Line"
556704,Big Fish,2006-04-29 10:33:00,138,Went through this last year with my son wanting to take a paintball gun. After talking to customs at I-Falls and being told they didn't really know if it was a firearm or not they referred me to Firearms Canada. After talking to two people there it was decided that 500fps velocity was the majic number. Above that it is considered a firearm. So even if you take a rubber band gun make sure the bands aren't too strong. cw
556705,Guest,2006-04-29 10:49:00,0,"What is your problem? If you don't like Canada don't go there. Canada is a different country which means it is different. If you want to be upset at somebody, pick a country that isn't our friend. That takes in a lot of countries!"
556707,Trailerguy,2006-04-29 12:01:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]A pelletgun that produces more than 500 fps has to be registered and you pay the $50 fee just like you would any long gun or shotgun. BB guns and weaker pelletguns are legal. However you can expect to be scrutinized when you are asked the standard question about ""guns"". Most camp owners don't want BB guns in camp either, inevitably windows or those cute little chippy's they feed all summer to amuse the guests get shot. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
