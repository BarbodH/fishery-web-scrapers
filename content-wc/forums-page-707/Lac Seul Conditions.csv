Weather: use Environment Canada Weather Stations surrounding Lac Seul, namely Dryden, Ear Falls, and Sioux Lookout. www.ec.gc.ca click on weather (top-right). Water Levels: controlled by the ""Lake of the Woods"" control board www.lwcb.ca click on Basin Data, then on Lac Seul Graph. You can see the level is near the high end long-term normal for this time. It's stinkin cold here right now!! Cold front went through last night, brrrrrrr! NWO Fishing Bum"
