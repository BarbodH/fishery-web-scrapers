556944,Guest,2006-05-07 05:47:00,0,I am gettinga bigger boat and my friend who I fish with in Ontario wants to buy my boat.I have no clue as to whats involved or if I can sell it to him legally.Anyone have any info that they would care to share? Thanks in advance.

My friend had called customs and said there neeed to eb 3 appraisals from dealerships on the value so that the purchase price could be compared and shown to be close to market value and not low to avoid taxation, etc. There were other checks that customs had to run on the boat before it was cleared. My deal was handled by a dealership in the end because my friend was buying a new boat in canada at the same time so I wasnt directly involved. You would want to call Canada-US customs and talk to an experiences agent to make sure you get the proper info. Don't wait too long, the summer students will be on duty soon. HAHA"
