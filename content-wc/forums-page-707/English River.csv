553818,Coach BWS,2006-01-16 22:38:00,38,"Actually you go through Dumpy to get to Scotty. (unless there is another way?) The entrance to Dumpy is oppisite the channel up to Tide Lake from Ball Lake. At the north end of Ball you turn right instead of left and go about 1/4 mile and the entrance is on the right (north), it is small and covered by big rocks, the water needs to be high to get in. Last year we were able to drive in carefully, the year before we have get out and push it through the rocks. Scotty entrance is on the far north side of dumpy and is a creek that is shallow for about a 1/2 mile to get to Scotty (again the water needs to be high). Rodney at the marina will be able to sell you one of his maps (not for navagation) that will help you see the route. I don't have this on GPS because I have done it enough to know the way and it isn't difficult once you see it. In early June the Lakers are usually up shallow and you can catch them trolling in 12-15 feet of water. When I go we need to use downriggers."

Do you have any other places to recommend in May/June for walleye? We have a map and I see exactly where you speak of. It's nice to get some good info on here.

553866,driftersifter,2006-01-17 12:30:00,109,"I use # 7 early in the year and will switch to a 9 bas the season gets rollin. The reason I use a 7 early is that size bait matches the baitfish in the water. I have found that crankbaits usually give me bigger fish than other baits. But you may catch fewer fish as it takes time to let out the line controll the boat and bring the bait to the fish properly. Once I catch a fish 4 pounds or bigger I go back at that spot and giver the tackle box approach. I try several things looking for their favorite of the day. I love to fish jigs walleyes don't always like to bite jigs. I have to adjust, to what they prefer. If you aren't catching big walleyes in canada, consider this: noise travels a lot faster underwater than on land or in the air it is also louder underwater than above. I suggest that you are spooking the large walleyes in that shallow water. Many times after catching a 5 i will drift back over the area and consistantly take on 7,8,9's until I spook the school. They will still be there or not butt they aren't as likely to bite. I scuba dive and have observed this repeatedly underwater. Just your foot scraping the bottom of the boat is enough to do it. #### even how you return the caught fish can send them off their feed. slip them in quietly not toss them in. Driftersifter"

I'll keep them in mind. Are there certain areas in that you would suggest? A place we could run to quickly on the first day to try this? I can give you my personal email if you don't want to post here. If not, I understand. I would really like to catch my first 7 - 12 pounder this year. ;)"
553868,driftersifter,2006-01-17 12:43:00,109,To be honest I don't think I have ever really marked a spot on a map and said to myself or anyone else this is where the fish are. I would suggest that you look at your map and look for an incoming creek or small stream. Go to the mouth of the creek and float backwards keep one eye on your depthfinder and the other on the current. look for the very first drop on that creek mouth and there is as good a starting point as any I could describe. Cast your rap above the drop and retrieve it back faster than the current give a little twitch when you float it over the hole. Hang on. Go back later when you have not floated over the hole and do it again. hang on with both hands this time. driftersifter P.S I go to Canada about three times a year.

I have seen the netting for many years now, but wonder if it is getting out of control.used to be primarily white fish, but now hear reports of large quantities of walleyes. will try the winnipeg river north of minaki this spring - a place I haven't tried. have you any experience there ? particularly for walleye. I gather there have been some decent muskies caught in that area. Overall, have fished over about 50 years from Quetico to LOW and many places in between and a little north, including Lac Seul. Can't say that any of the places are ""sure bets"" as it always depends on weather and fish patterns when you show up one thing i do like about the english river is you can find areas that are fairly remote and personally i like to fish alone (or close to it). havent' been to grassy narrows or ball lake, but generally hear good things about ball. went to oak and big canyon years ago-too many people there for me. good luck"

Why the concern? Those longer, thinner northern seem odd however. I wonder if they are 30 years old? All of the pike we caught at Lount were fatter and healthier than any I've ever caught in other lakes. Does the English River flow to/from LOW somewhere? I thought it made it's way over to Lake Winnepeg to the West....I think that's the giant lake over there anyway?"

553875,driftersifter,2006-01-17 16:03:00,109,"I did a flyin fishing trip and photographed my planned route. The portages and marked likely looking hotspots from the air, you know the small lake that is too much hassle to get to. Some are duds some are 100 fish days with the smallest being 4 pounds. Spring weather plays such a part of what can happen like the 100 fish days, that spring was wet and fish could go anywhere then it dried up and a beaver dam held these fish prisoner until I freed them downstream one at a time. Some maps mark where the portages are and of course you must put your neck out there and give her a whirl. When I was real young I always wanted to test myself against the wilderness. I have hiked through a large part of uor west alone and really never had cause for concern I use a reliable person to know where my route is and when I'm expected back plus two days all has been good so far. If you have some fear of what might happen contact a fly in outfitter and hire them to be your backup let them know where you are headed anmd arrange for them to do a fly over and check upon you. For a few years that settled my first wifes worries. Before the divorce however she didn't think that safety check was no longer neccessary.

553982,Guest,2006-01-23 15:04:00,0,"We've fished the river system for the past nine Summers, usually mid-July. This year we are headed up the first week in August. The best piece of advice I'll give you is to go to the Marina, buy a map, minnows, ice, and gas, ask for Rodney a.k.a. Frenchie and tell him to mark at least six different spots on the map that he would fish that day. Tell him the ""Big Guys"" from Iowa told you he would and if he gives you any static, tell him we said we'd never do business with him again. Seriously, this is exactly what we did our first year and I'm sure he'll do it for you. After that we discovered spots on our own and stole some from the Native guides you will see all week long in their 16' Lunds. GPS is a must the first year, we never would have found camp back without it. We've got years of waypoints, but don't use it much any more. Just know the place. Also, bring an extra prop and especially a wrench cause you will need it! Many reefs that come up sharp (ouch!) having painful flashbacks just thinking about it. It's a great fishery and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Biggest Summer key is not the main lakes, it's all about the narrows and fast water, that's where the Summer trophies swim. Took a nine pound, 6 ounce fish in 3 feet of water last Summer on a jig drifting a narrow. Hope this helps."

553873,driftersifter,2006-01-17 15:30:00,109,"Most of the time I go it alone as I teach school for a living and my buds do not have as much free time as I have. I have dragged my 14 footer 50-60 miles from the nearest road many times. To tell the truth the further away from the road or any lake you can land a plane the better the fishing. I like to start fishing after the third portage. Most people don't like to hike or work they want the big buck to walk out to the road for them to shoot or swim up to the bridge for them to catch. I prefer to earn my fish and I could have a wall full of big ones, I have yet to get a single fish mounted. I don't want to advertise and after a year full of 6 grade kids a little quiet is welcome too. I have dragged my now 18 year old daughter along and she could start her own wall of trophies. She has gotten tooo old now and prefers we car camp so once each year we do that together along with my brother and his two daughters. I live in wisconsin and its about 700 miles to where I fish. I use a toyota truck and popup camper to tow my boat. Lest you think all I do is canoe camp, I have been on the big water too and I do own 5 boats. Driftersifter"

553712,Guest,2006-01-11 09:30:00,0,thanks. We'll be fishing about 16 miles East of Separation if anyone has ever fished that.
553727,DaveIN,2006-01-12 10:45:00,191,"I stay at Separation Rapids Campground and fish down river from there. Many of the boats go down to Kettle Falls to fish. The guides generally take each guest down there at least once during their stay at the lodge. They also go over to Lount Lake, so I guess this might be in the same area you are talking about. I am not familar with the lakes you named. I know that a 17 lb walleye came out of there last year. I am afraid that might be quite a long run from where you are at."

We stayed at Lount last year, but furhter East yet. After Lount is Big Fox, then Little Fox, then Indian Lake. Where is Kettle Falls? 17lb walleye is a monster."

Or do you use something else? #7 is kind of small isn't it? Why #7 and not something bigger? I would love to catch an 8 lber. If it works for you, then I'll give it a whirl. Do you fish the same area I am asking about? If so, do you have any great spots where many large fish were caught in the May/June timeframe that you could suggest via email? I could give that to you. I've been coming up since I was 14 (34 now) and have not caught one over 6 pounds yet. :( I don't consider myself a bad fisheman either. Not great, but not bad either."
553753,Coach BWS,2006-01-14 15:06:00,38,I fish this area in late July. Been doing so for the last 8 years with great success. Most of my time has been spent further up river beyond Indian Lake. The fast water areas are usually the best in July. However we have had good luck along shorelines in lakes such as Dumpy and Grassy. We almost strickly use leaches and crawlers behind a bottom bouncer (1 to 2 oz). If you find a reef you will find fish. Where are you going out of?

Do you first have to go through Scotty or is there an entrance to Dumpy somewhere? I've heard both Dumpy and Scotty have lake trout. Thanks for the tips. If you have any good spots to recommend please let me know. Thanks much!!!!

553683,Guest,2006-01-09 11:38:00,0,"We are fishing Big Fox and Indian Lake area next spring. May 23rd - 28th. Does anyone have a marked map of any hot spots that may have worked for them? It is a rather large system and any help would be greatly appreciated. We always catch fish, but I have never caught a walleye over 6 pounds. Thanks guys!"
553685,Guest,2006-01-09 13:08:00,0,"Nobody has fished this part of the English River? Grassy Lake, Indian Lake, Ball Lake, Tide Lake, Big Fox Lake, Little Fox lake, Lount Lake, Separation Lake."
553689,Guest,2006-01-09 14:41:00,0,Has anyone fished the English River?
553690,Guest,2006-01-09 15:12:00,0,GPS Coordinates would work too. Am I on the right board?
553691,Guest,2006-01-09 16:09:00,0,think these guys went into hibernation. i've seen separation lake spoken about at some length here. do a search of the canada board. lots of info there. i personally am not familiar with that area. good luck.
553692,Guest,2006-01-09 16:31:00,0,"Thanks Whit. We are about 20 miles away from Separation though. I know that area a little bit. I'm looking for knowledge on Grassy Lake, Indian Lake, Big and Little Fox Lakes, Ball Lake, and Tide Lake. Maybe somebody will help me. Sure hope so. Thanks all!"
553697,Guest,2006-01-10 09:19:00,0,I thought I would bump this since I haven't heard from anyone. I would assume that some of you guys have been there?
553701,Guest,2006-01-10 10:44:00,0,"I never have, but I know some on this board have. They should be able to help you out."
553704,driftersifter,2006-01-10 14:14:00,109,"I think what you should be asking instead of spots is what depth and what pattern will work in a variety of spots. My suggetion to you is to troll a shad rap on one line and on the other a no 7 silver and black rapala with a sinker about 2-3 feet up the line. I try to get both raps in 6-10 feet of water. I troll shorelines looking for the school of walleyes I want to play with. Upon finding the school, I then switch to casting the same raps or switching to jigs or slip bobbers and giving the school my quietest effort. These fish are really shallow and your noise is whats sending the big ones off the feed. I usually catch several over 8 each trip into Canada using this simple method. Once a pattern is established it will be repeated in other areas of the system. Mark with your eyes the terrain in which fish were caught and remember walleyes generally school by size. Of course to fish two lines there must be two of you in the boat. I wouldn't recommend anything illeagal. If you need more specifics , just ask. Driftersifter"
553706,Guest,2006-01-10 15:08:00,0,Have you fished the English River then? Thank you for the help. It is greatly appreciated. This is kind of how we found them on Lount last year. We then sat on them and jigged. We had very good luck this way. Do you know of any locations in that area that you would highly recommend? I'll shoot you my email if you don't want them to be public knowledge. Thanks!
