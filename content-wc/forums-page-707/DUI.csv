556865,Guest,2006-05-04 10:00:00,0,on a Friday or Saturday night after 7 or 8 Pm I would say 1/2 or more of the drivers have had drink or two
556867,wooglin,2006-05-04 10:07:00,371,You do realize that WI is relatively close to Canada - 1/2 is an underestimate. hahahaha >on a Friday or Saturday night after 7 or 8 Pm I would say 1/2 >or more of the drivers have had drink or two

They used to talk all the time about all the good beer they had in Canada and all the beer drinking everyone did due to the good beer they brewed in Canada. And in the winter what are you going to do with all that good beer going to waste. (WWBADD) ""What would Bob and Doug do"" From the Great White North? By the way what else besides a DUI would keep you from entering Canada. i.e. writting bad checks, stealing, slapping a girlfriend, peeping tom, drug use... anyone know??"

Criminal offences include both minor and serious offences such as theft, assault, dangerous driving, driving while intoxicated and manslaughter, among others. For a complete list of criminal offences in Canada, please consult the Canadian Criminal Code. If you have juvenile convictions (convictions for crimes committed while under the age of 18), you are most likely not prohibited from entering Canada. Find out how you may be able to overcome a past conviction. Read the Frequently Asked Questions for more information on criminal inadmissibility."
