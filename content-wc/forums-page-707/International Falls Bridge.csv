556821,czy42strokes,2006-05-03 08:15:00,419,I know the bridge was up for sale. Didn't anyone buy it and did the price to cross go up?
556825,hammer_gold_spinner,2006-05-03 10:21:00,151,It is up for sale but that is a long way off. Cost I believe is $6 for vehicle and $4 for the trailer. Pay one way. no cost for return to U.S. Think that is expensive try living there and go back and forth several times a week. You can buy prepaid cards for around $9 that give you 8 or 9 trips over but these do not cover trailers. Mac

Their govt. works about as fast as ours, ;) . I've seen no recent news coverage indicating that it has been actually sold yet. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
556827,Guest,2006-05-03 10:53:00,0,Not a bad bridge to buy. Could be a good second job to have in the summer for X-tra income. It would be a real money maker. Maybe someone from the middle east will buy it. Maybe Iran?

He said that although the price of crossing is posted in dollars, the real cost when you consider that most vehicles that cross the bridge uses monthly passes , the real revenue per vehicle works out to less than a dollar a trip."
