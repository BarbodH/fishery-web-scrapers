556733,Hammerhead Herb,2006-04-30 13:50:00,259,"I see that the Canadian beer store websitehttp://www.thebeerstore.ca/storesand...brandname=BLUE shows Labatt Blue 24 can case selling for $CD 39.95. It states that this price includes GST, PST and deposit. So how much are these individual taxes and deposit costing? How does one get a deposit back? Is there a deposit on cans, bottles, or both?"
556735,Guest,2006-04-30 15:56:00,0,You drink the beer and return the cans for your deposit back.
556736,Slick Willy,2006-04-30 20:24:00,36,Taxes are approx. 60% of the total cost on beer and over 70% on hard liquor/wine in Ontario. Deposit is .10 on bottles and cans but cans have an extra recycling tax (more energy to manufacture a new can than reuse a bottle) applied which results in the difference in price between bottles $35.90 and cans $39.95.There are bargain brands available in both packages as low as $26.40 bottles and $29.95 cans.Gotta pay for that free healthcare somehow I guess.
556737,Matches,2006-04-30 21:27:00,236,"If you're from the US, buy it at the duty free going in. I think last fall, a case of Labatts was $16.00 U.S. dollars. Might be different now the exchange rate has changed. Anyway, for that we forget the deposits and let the resort owners cash in big time with the stack of empties we leave."
556743,Guest,2006-05-01 08:30:00,0,Do they have a alumn. can recycling programn in Canada? I know in Missouri you can sell can to the scrapman for .60 cents a pound. Or is it better to not smash the cans in camp and bring them back in the beer box?
556749,Pooch,2006-05-01 10:37:00,4619,Our camp operator said to smash 'em. Pooch
556753,Guest,2006-05-01 12:35:00,0,Same here to save on space in the plane. But do you still get your .10 cents back per can if they are all smashed? Or do they care and just go by a can count? And I wonder do they have a .10 dep on soda pop cans?
556768,phishfearme,2006-05-01 19:01:00,1242,flattened cans are rejected by the beer stores - at least they rejected our flattened cans a few years ago when our outfitter said to flatten them. if there's room in the plane to take them in there's certainly room to take them out - or just give them to the pilot / dock crew as an additional tip. - phish
