556813,Guest,2006-05-02 21:59:00,0,"As to Vaughn, really not sure on where the fish sanctuary starts and I would hate to give you info that ruins your trip. The folks at ML should be able to tell you that. If its closed, just work you way up the shore to west and hit the points and the cups on the wind blown shore. There are ton of islands through there and its easy to get turned around, so the GPS unit would be smart to plot your way in and follow it back to ML. Same going to the North shore. If you see a SWWL boat, you can rest assured they are on fish, just be respectful of your distance. 100% of their guides are great guys. They do a ton of back trolling (both jigs and bottom bouncer/spinners) so watch what they do and then take a similar back troll. Just remember to give them the kind of space on the troll that you would want in return (just a common courtesy). 99.9% of fishermen are great, but it only takes one in a bunch to ruin a day for everyone. One other thing, on parts of LS, there is a strong clay bottom. If you see a shoreline where the waves/wind are hitting it and the water looks liked chocolate milk, give that shot. Best thing is to stay on the clear water side and fire jigs and cranks into the shoreline/dirty water. The clay particles seem to suspend up high in the water column, but in doing so, it darkens the water below, giving the walleyes an upper hand in the predator-prey relationship and that seems to turn them on. Just back troll down that edge line but cast your jigs/cranks toward shore. If there are any walleyes in the area, they will be there and aggressive. While LS is a terrific fishery capable of 100 fish days or a 30 inch walleye, its also capable of being a bit slow when the weather is tough. If that happens, just stay at it becasue it will happen. A couple of years ago we had a day of really tough fishing followed by a morning of the same. Wind picked up in the afternoon after shore lunch and we had a afternoon like none I have every seen. For the first time in my life I almost felt like I was tired of catching fish. This year my ten-year old daughter is coming with her father and 76-year old father. She is determined to be her 13 year-old brother's Lac Seul best of 30 1/4"" walleye (which I have not come close to...yet) Even if she does not, what is better than time with family and our SWWL friends in a great part of God's Country!....IA Walleye"

556831,Guest,2006-05-03 12:50:00,0,"There used to be a ""Fish Sanctuary"" sign right at the narrow entrance to the lake. There is a small dock with a path leading to a cabin there. I wouldn't go beyond that just to be safe. No sense in possibly ruining your trip when there are plenty of other spots to fish. Our trip is timed for the Vaughan Lake opening but I can honestly tell you that I don't do any better in there than in the rest of LS. Regards,"
556836,Guest,2006-05-03 16:41:00,0,When you say at the narrows entering the lake do you mean the narrows entering Lac Seul or at the other end where it narrows before entering Vaughn lake? Thanks
556838,Guest,2006-05-03 17:14:00,0,"The opening I refer to is at the opening of Vaughn onto Lac Seul, right where the cabins are. I think technically, anything beyond that narrows is considered Vaughn, but I guess. My email is [email protected], IA Hawk, send me note and we can chat. Have been going to SWWL for six years and never regreted a minute of time there. MW runs a great camp. When will you be there?...IA Walleye"
556858,Guest,2006-05-04 08:07:00,0,"The narrows I am referring to is the first one. As I said there used to be a sign but it's gone now. I don't know where Vaughan technically starts but that is where I would stop. I have a satellite photo that shows where I'm talking about but I forgot my password and can't put photos here. I can email you directly if you'd like. Regards,"

556708,schick,2006-04-29 13:45:00,35,"I am making my second trip to Lac Seul fishing out of Mahkwa Lodge. Prior to that I fished out of Chamberlain Narrows for 2 years. I know you do not have to be genius to catch walleye and pike, but this year I am taking my 24 year old son who has never done a lot of fishing. I want to make sure we have a great experiences. Does anyone have recommendations on best spots to try within 10 miles of Mahkwa Lodge (near the mouth of Vaughn Lake). We will be fishing the last week of May. Does anybody know where the ""no fish"" line starts as you go into Vaughn Channel from Lac Seul. Last year I did not dare venture past the mouth of Vaughn Channel entering Lac Seul because I could not see the posts. I would like to venture west through the islands and fish just east of Manitou Narrows. I have the new GPS chip that shows a channel through the islands, but I have a fiberglass fishing boat, so I have to be careful. If I follow that channel line will I be okay? Finally what is the prospect for this spring? I hear it maybe early again like last year and that the water level may be high again like last year? Thanks for any tips. I would like to see my son get the walleye/pike bug like me."
556709,Guest,2006-04-29 13:54:00,0,"Don't be afraid to fish very shallow using jigs with plastic twister tails or gulp baits. Try different shorelines and points. If you see spots with Mahkwa or Silver Water Wheel boats, fish those spots."
556713,Guest,2006-04-29 19:02:00,0,"When will you be there. We fish out of SWWL which is the same area, so I might be able to help you a bit, but my limited knowledge is confined to June, the only time I have fished LS....IA Walleye"

556805,Guest,2006-05-02 18:42:00,0,"Your up there a bit earlier than I have been so that is cavet #1. The other is I don't carry a GPS unit (we have a guide), so that is #2, and #3 is I don't know the official names of the of the places, so that is #3. SWW is to the west of the place your staying. I have fished the first part of Vaughn only a couple of times but always had luck. As you come through the opening from LS, it seem as if you go about 1.5 miles on the left there is as sand bar that always holds fish. Its shaped a little like a banana, and its the inside curve that seems to hold the fish. Frankly, while strong numbers the size has been below average. Back on the LS, we tend to fish in a few type of places and in the spring it all depends on the water temp and the wind. If the water temps are upper 50's to 60, then work any wind blown point or shoreline (rock or sand or combination) and don't be afraid to pitch jigs real shallow. We have got real nice walleyes out of water as little as 2 feet deep. You will feel like your casting for smallies with your casts landing within a foot of shore, but it will be walleys that will hammer your jig 9 out of 10 times with the 10 being a pike or a smallie. If the wind is not hitting or the temp a little cooler, back off the same shorline and work 12 - 8 feet. They are there, just a little less aggressive. Jigs worked real slow or spinners on a bottom bouncer will produce. I have tried leaches with little success this early, its always minnows or just a jig with plastic. Everbody has their own color preference and I am convinced confidence in your bait is just as important as the actual color, but I have confidence in pink or chartruese jig head and a white curly tail. Last year I tried the thumper bodies and it seemed while I did not catch as many, I caught bigger fish on them. However, our guides always seem to outcatch me and they use nothing but a jig with a curly tail. On days when the wind is coming from the south, if the waves are not too big or your boat good enough, go to the north shore. Same thing on that side, but also don't overlook the river that's across from your resort. The folks at ML can tell you about, lots of their boats are in it. I tend not to fish it much, long boat ride for us and too often too many boats for my taste. Part of the reason to go to LS is to get away from other boats cutting you off or crowding you. As to the waves, LS is a really big body of water and it can get rough in a hurry. A few years ago we were on the north shore and tried to get back before a storm hit. Did not make it and had to sit it out on a island and that was with a 18 foot Lund. Point of raising that is this because this lake is oriented west to east and if you get the right storm out of the west, the waves build in a hurry. Better to sit it out on an island for a bit than treading water or worse. Early in the spring, on the same wind pounded shoreline, don't overlook the crankbait bite. The last couple of years I have had a ball throwing the new Rapala Rap X. When the bite is on the hits are huge and you never know what its going to be on the bite. If you find the right shore line that is getting pounded and it has some rock pikes in about 10 feet that top out 3 - 4 feed down, its a hoot. On the Rap-X, don't forget to pause the bait after about 5 - 6 cranks. Half the hits comes when the bait is at rest. By June 1, unless its a cold spring which I doubt this year, the pike will have already transitioned out of the back bays and mixed in with the walleyes that are in the 12 - shoreline range. They are there feeding on the walleyes. Because of this we don't really target them as it seems we get plenty that either hit the jigs, the cranks, or a walleye that did a second before. Sorry, I am not giving you names of places, but I am not sure the names I have are on any maps (ie Poppi's Point) and for me to give you the exact places our guides have taken us over the years might not be appropriate from their perspective. Will be up the second week in June, so email your results back. I heard the water level is down a bit but not as much as few years back. Look to be a largely normal spring, perhaps a little ahead of normal, but honestly everything changes so fast that who knows what four weeks will bring. We have fished in 90 degrees on year, snow the following year in the same week. Have a great time...IA Walleye"
