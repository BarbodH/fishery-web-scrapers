556832,Guest,2006-05-03 13:07:00,0,"Rodbender, Are group of 6 is heading to White pine lodge from June 4th to June 8th. Maybe we can get together and throw a few back over at whatever resort you're staying or ours. We're coming in from Duluth on Sunday. We have fished that area for the last 4 years. Superb fishing that time of year.Trout are moving deeper but still might be in close. Good luck if we don't cross paths and be careful out there. Eddy"
556833,dewyg,2006-05-03 14:21:00,1006,"With the early spring and unusual temps the trout will be deep. I have been bass fishing for the last two weeks on LOTW, everything is about 3-4 weeks ahead of schedule. The walleye started spawning the middle of April. Good Luck when you are on vacation. If you see a new 2025 le Black and pewter with a 250 Verado screeming by give me a wave."
