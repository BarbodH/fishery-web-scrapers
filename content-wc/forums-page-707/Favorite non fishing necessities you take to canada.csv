556549,jigman 2003,2006-04-26 13:09:00,981,Baxter-your #4 is definitely a good tip. I started bringing enough ear plugs for each guy in the group awhile ago. It can save a trip. Nothing like not being able to sleep to make someone grumpy.

556484,Bill Krejca,2006-04-25 09:26:00,6107,Re: extra eyeglasses - good reminder. I aways save my last old pair of prescription glasses and take them along. Being up there and not being able to enjoy it completely due to dunked glasses would be a bummer.
556493,Guest,2006-04-25 10:47:00,0,"I brought this up last year, and I will again. I bring an Epi-pen with. You never know when someone will go down with a bee sting allergic reaction, and you are in the middle of the lake at shorelunch. My wife is allergic to bee stings so I have some at the house, and take a couple with to make sure no one else in my party is. A few years ago my uncle and I were 10 lakes out in the Boundary Waters and thankfully nothing happened. He got back to Chicago, and while mowing his lawn the next week got stung and went down with a bad allergic reaction. Had he not been 2 minutes from a paramedic with an epi-pen, he would be dead."
556498,jigman 2003,2006-04-25 11:52:00,981,"Yes, I used to carry those when my Dad went with me. Now, however we don't have anyone with a prescription for them. Any ideas on how to get them without a known allergy?"
556502,Lovetofish,2006-04-25 13:02:00,458,"Small fan and extension cord. Cabins get warm in July/August. Also bring a heating pad and soft ice packs. Can't forget the mouse traps for our furry friends. Ditto on the duct tape, seen it cover a hole in a lower unit for a couple days!"
556517,north_alabama,2006-04-25 18:28:00,172,"Well in my case, I do have a history of allergy to bee stings, buy my present doctor only knows about it from what I described to her (i.e., she does'nt have all those records from when I was a kid). I have other typical/mild allergy symptoms (congestion, athsma, eye troubles, etc) occasionally, and explained that I would be in a remote area without access to immediate medical help and was looking to get a ""double"" set of my normal prescription to have a backup in case I misplaced a bottle or something. She suggested the pen, and wrote me an Rx for it. Anyway, you might explain to your doctor you'll be spending time in a remote place, and although you haven't had a bad reaction to stings *yet* you have immediate family members that do, and are concerned about having something happen with no ability to get fast help. It's possible your Dr. would prescribe one ""just in case"", since the allergy exists in you family. I don't think the things can be ""abused"", so that shouldn't be an issue. Can't hurt to ask, I guess."

Now four of us cant get all our stuff in the back of a Suburban and a small trailer we tow. Batteries for all our electric stuff cost more than a fishing lic did 30 years ago. Love It Still

I'm telling you folks, gifts and thank you cards are just going out style and they shouldn't. 2. Lures/New Jigs, whatever for the guys I'm with to try 3. Gotta bring some Wimmer's Summer Sausage and a few Nebraska Ribeyes (I have them aged, cut 1.5"", seasoned and vacuum packed) 4. Kokanee Beer, Gibson's Whiskey, Rainwear, Malkin's Jam, English Toasting Bread, and bacon are NOT luxury items! Todd We buried him, on a hill, overlooking a little river with pine cones all around."
556459,Thunderstick,2006-04-24 18:30:00,35,"XM has accompanied me for the past three years. Our camp is about 230 miles north of Ottawa. As long as there's a clear view of the low south, it should work. Because of the latitude, I'm guessing that the sattlites are a little lower on the southern horizon but discounting any obstructions, you should be able to pick up the signal. Do you get reception as you travel? Good luck."
