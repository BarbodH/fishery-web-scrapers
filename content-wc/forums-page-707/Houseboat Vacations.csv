556933,Guest,2006-05-06 10:56:00,0,Anybody ever went on a houseboat vacation on Lake Temagami north of North Bay or the canal and lock areas from Peterborough to Georgian Bay? Looking at a house boat vacation in both areas. Lake of the Woods area is too far away for me.
556935,Guest,2006-05-06 11:10:00,0,I am specifically looking at this houseboat outfitter:http://www.leisureislandhouseboats.com/index.asp Anybody know anything about them?
556962,Guest,2006-05-08 11:12:00,0,Went on a houseboat trip one time on LOW. Didnt care for it much and when the final cost came in it was more than advertised. Not a great place to be in a storm.
