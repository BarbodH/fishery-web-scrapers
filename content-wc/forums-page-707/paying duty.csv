556889,phishfearme,2006-05-04 19:23:00,1242,it's typically based on what you paid for it. bring along the reciept. - phish
556890,Guest,2006-05-04 20:28:00,0,Why the receipt. They have never cared too much with me. I just tell them it was $12 a case and thats it. You then pay about $6 to $7 duty for the case. It is definately cheaper to bring beer.
556895,phishfearme,2006-05-05 06:07:00,1242,the duty on any goods and services is based on what you paid for it/them. they've asked us for receipts in the past and once in a while they havn't. it's definitly alot cheaper to buy in the US and pay the duty - but it can be time consuming. - phish

Heck, even Miller tastes better when you buy it up there. Plus, there is actually some alcohol in Canadian beer. More expensive up front, but you don't need as much to accomplish the same goal :-)"
557031,Guest,2006-05-09 09:55:00,0,Do what I do. Be the one that fills the cooler each day and load all your buddies beer in the cooler filled with ice water and after a few hours all the labels fall off. With no lables they don't know that you are drinking their beer!
