556882,Guest,2006-05-04 16:00:00,0,"Iced down cold beer in a cooler?? I was told this was the same as drinking and driving if it was in reach, even in the back of a truck with a window that slides open. Anyone confirm this."
556893,phaffy12,2006-05-05 02:02:00,9,"Why try and push the limits? The exchange rate is not that good for Americans anymore, so just buy the food (or whatever) in Canada. It won't be that much more expensive and you can tell the mounties at the border you don't have anything worth searching for and be on your way. Trust me, it's not worth the effort to save a few bucks and sit around for a few hours to get searched (done it twice). We're all on vacation up there to relax, so enjoy yourselves; don't stress out about a few beef patties or dog food..."
556929,north_alabama,2006-05-06 08:19:00,172,"I agree. We take up as little as we can, mostly to simplify the border crossing as much as possible. But since we stay overnight in Thunder Bay anyway, stopping at the A&P for perishables, and at the beer store is not an inconvenience. We don't go though much beer, so the price difference on that is not much of a hassle, and offset by the Bicardi guys offering free sample shots."
556438,Reels,2006-04-24 14:17:00,2876,When did the no beef thing start? <{{}}><
556452,Jimmy Jig,2006-04-24 17:03:00,1905,You ar allowed 11 lbs. of meat per person. Beef included. Dog food with CHICKEN is OK also!
556481,jigman 2003,2006-04-25 08:21:00,981,Looks like the one website says no dog food is permitted. Better to be safe than sorry I always say.
556482,Guest,2006-04-25 08:28:00,0,"You can bring in dog food if it does not contain any beef by products. And keep it in the original bag or container so they can read what it is make of. If it contains beef it is not allowed. This all started with the mad cow thing. You can buy and eat beef in Canada, but don't bring any home with you. If one gets searched at the U.S. border and they find any kind of beef product, it will be taken. Works both ways, its the powers that be protecting the people."

556861,Guest,2006-05-04 08:34:00,0,I have conflicting information. Can a fellow bring some burger patties or not?
556862,jigman 2003,2006-05-04 08:55:00,981,"Yes, you can take burger into Canada"
556863,Guest,2006-05-04 09:06:00,0,what about frozen frenchfries and frozen pizzas?
556399,Moondog,2006-04-22 11:51:00,362,"So what are the banned substances de jour at the border these days? In the past we lost all our pet food (coming and going), potatoes, chicken and beef. Anyone been thru at International Falls that can assist here? Also any websites that might contain some info?? Thanks!"
556400,Jimmy Jig,2006-04-22 17:04:00,1905,"No taters unless processed, raw is a no no. Dog food can NOT have beef or lamb by-products in it."
556401,Guest,2006-04-22 18:14:00,0,"Firewood, we had to toss all of ours at the border last year."
556405,walleyeduran,2006-04-23 08:37:00,286,"I know of a group that had to leave behind their venison and moose steaks. The guy who brought the moose steaks was pissed. He shot the moose in Canada the fall before, paid to have the meat cross the border into the US and then they will not let him bring it back into Canada to eat on their fishing trip."
556406,dewyg,2006-04-23 08:52:00,1006,"Being a weekly user of the I falls crossing, the answer to your inquiry is simple. No taters, no dog food, no plants, and certainly no common sense in making these decisions. Look at their web sit for more no no's I'm sure they will add more soon."
556419,JDP,2006-04-24 08:26:00,1457,A couple of websites for reference:http://www.canadawelcomesyou.net/travelreminders.htmlhttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/E/pub/cp/.../rc4161-e.html Good Luck.:-)
556429,Ohio fisherman,2006-04-24 11:18:00,989,"So, how can i take dog food for the two labs? Can i take in dry or canned food? If dry, does it need to be in the original package? Lamb, beef, chicken, or fish, meal based food? Thanks, O F"
556431,Guest,2006-04-24 11:33:00,0,"Don't bring it, buy it in Canada, eh."
556434,Moondog,2006-04-24 12:35:00,362,"The last time thru they took our dog food, including treats. I would just bring enuf to get thru the border and then stop at Wallyworld and get some more in St. Francis. That is what we will do."
556435,bigfish1965,2006-04-24 12:55:00,3210,"No beef products,plants,potatoes. (travelling both ways there is the same restrictions)."
