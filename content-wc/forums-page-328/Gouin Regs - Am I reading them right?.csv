2836857,smallcal,2014-05-27 10:52:00,119,"Just went through the Quebec regulations for the Gouin, I believe. I sited where I found the ""answers"" in the regulations (linked at the bottom of the post), if there is somewhere else please let me know. The main things I came away with are:No slot limit - 32 cm and above are legal (pg. 19, Zone 14, Gouin Specific Reg)One Line per person - (pg. 10 Last paragraph in ""Line Fishing"" section) This is unfortunate, wanted to troll with a worm harness and a crankbait to see which they prefer.Dead Baitfish - Legal outside of the communal wildlife area if the baitfish is not on the prohibited list - which pike, walleye and yellow perch are (pg. 15, Zone 14 and prohibited list - pg. 16)Leeches are legal dead or alive but cannot be imported into Quebec (pg. 16 ""Other Bait"" and ""Importation of Baitfish"")Baitfish alive or dead may not be imported into Quebec (pg. 16 ""Importation of Baitfish"")Is this how you read it as well? Guess the biggest two for me are the one line and assuming that leeches are baitfish and cannot be imported.Want to make sure I do it legal and killing time until July 11th!Thanks.Link to the Quebec regs in English:http://www.mddep.gouv.qc.ca/faune/re...hing-rules.pdf"
2837121,TheDFP,2014-05-27 11:41:00,39,We always use a night crawler tipped on a jig/soft plastic on the Gouin and have done very well. Only keep a couple of fish for dinner and they all had leeches in their stomachs. I have used gulp alive leeches tipped with a crawler and have done well. I'm curious about the live leeches. We might try to catch some out of the lake this year if it is legal. I would assume that you will be in the boat by yourself trolling with 1 rod. Have two rods and just keep switching back and forth. The fish will tell you what they want. Good luck and tight lines.
2837129,Andre (wallyandre),2014-05-27 11:42:00,2274,"No slot limit for now. In 2016 don,t be surprise to see a slot limit. you can keep a fish between 12.6"" 7 18.6"" 1 rod per license is a stupid rule but this the rule Leeches are easy to find and you can capture you're own (just bait them)"
2837489,phishfearme,2014-05-27 13:04:00,1242,"andre' - wouldn't that 12.6 to 18.6inches be the ""slot"" limit? it seems I've heard the ""slot"" defined two different ways in Quebec and Ontario - the slot can be the size range where you have to release them OR could be the range in which you can keep them. one specifically protects the high breeder range. and - can a non-resident trap their own bait - leeches or minnows - in Quebec? I don't think it's legal in Ontario. thanks phish"
2837537,smallcal,2014-05-27 13:13:00,119,"A quick review did not differentiate between residents and non-residents for baitfish collection (Quebec).I was under the impression that the leeches that people were using for walleye were the 'vegetarian' type and the blood suckers that are easy to catch were not nearly as good. Am I incorrect on that? If not, I'll be taking some calf liver and foil plates to Gouin with me rather than buying them on the way in...Thanks."
2837665,Andre (wallyandre),2014-05-27 13:34:00,2274,"Trap you,re leeches not minnows. It doesn,t matter resident or not You will allowed to keep the fish between or inside the measurements I gave. This for 2016 I use walleye and pike guts to trap my leeches"
2837697,smallcal,2014-05-27 13:46:00,119,"Andre - the way I read the regs, that would not be allowable, is this true? It says you can use traps but does not mention what you can use for bait. I assume that would fall under the baitfish rules?That's why I posted originally, there are places for interpretation on many of the regs."
2838113,Andre (wallyandre),2014-05-27 15:44:00,2274,I'm not a game warden but I own a camp on the gouin for 12 years and I was trapping my leeches when I used all the one that I purchase. Never care for minnows. To be sure ask you're outfitter.
2838369,smallcal,2014-05-27 16:51:00,119,"Andre - Thanks, and honestly I think you may know your regulations better than our outfitter does!Thank you!"
2838561,Andre (wallyandre),2014-05-27 17:29:00,2274,I just check again with a reliable source: dead or live minnows are prohibited You can use and catch you're leeches to be use. I'll be there June 13 to the 16th. August the 01st to the 04th August the 20th to the 24th
