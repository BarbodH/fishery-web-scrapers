2847297,Troy Mansfield,2014-05-30 00:03:00,22,"You can see the ""chutes"" from frog rapids camp. It's about a 1.5 miles. Abram also has good walleyes but doesn't get much traffic. Most non resident people go to minnitaki or lac seul"
2850281,jkoebel,2014-05-30 19:25:00,10,Very good camp. Started going there in 1994 and the place is run really well. We stopped going 5 years ago because we were able to get on a houseboat for the second week. If we stopped going on a houseboat we would go back to Frog Rapids in a heartbeat. The whole Bowers family is great and Larry is super friendly and helpful.
2836097,bluefin85,2014-05-27 08:11:00,31,Would like to know if anyone has fished at Frograpids camp in the past. Thinking of a trip next year for a change. THANKS
2836881,Jimmy Jig,2014-05-27 10:56:00,1905,I've stayed there about 20 times.....very good camp.
2836953,bigwalleye1,2014-05-27 11:06:00,2632,"I've also stayed there close to 20 times, usually 2 trips a year. Good folks, go out of their way for you. Old time fish camp,nothing fancy, limited services, but you can eat off the floor. Golf cart for your use on the property, free shaved ice, a lodge to catch a ball game. They're like 75 years in business in the same family. PM me if I can help with questions. I have no stake there, but never had a problem. Prices are good and they're nice folks."
2837777,skindzier,2014-05-27 14:02:00,137,"Curious, those of you who have been there - do you usually fish Minnitaki, trailer to Lac Seul, a combination of those, or something else? Lots of water to pick from there, obviously."
2838697,bigwalleye1,2014-05-27 18:09:00,2632,"I have always trailered to Lac Seul, but Larry the owner will be happy to provide info re: Pelican, Abrams, and Minnitaki."
2839097,CI_Guy,2014-05-27 19:31:00,2118,"We've been going there the last 5 years, the Bowers do a great job. We fish mostly on Minnitaki but have found productive spots for smaller walleyes on Abrams & Pelican. The northern in my avatar came out of Minnitaki."
2841601,skindzier,2014-05-28 12:47:00,137,Thanks guys - I've always fished the Ear Falls side of Lac Seul and was curious about the Sioux Lookout side...
2842049,bluefin85,2014-05-28 14:29:00,31,how far is Minnitaki from Frograpids Camp by boat.
2842193,BenBeattie,2014-05-28 15:13:00,232,5 Minutes. Not far at all.
