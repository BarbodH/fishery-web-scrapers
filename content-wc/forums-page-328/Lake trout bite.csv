The warmest temps were only in the shallow back bays. The main lake was a consistent 39. There were a few carpenter ants out and that normally means a good surface bite but the water was just too cold. The best bite was at 30' on downriggers with spoons. No real consistent pattern as far as spoon type was concerned. Tried some cranks to no avail. Fish will start to come up to the surface as the week progresses. On another note, the suckers were in the creeks so there should be a good pike bite starting at the creek mouths."
