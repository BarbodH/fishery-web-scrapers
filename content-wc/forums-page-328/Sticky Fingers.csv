2842945,unclejoe,2014-05-28 19:47:00,22,For those that have a long drive and stop over night at the motel..... Anyone hear about recurring problems in certain towns with theft on the way up if you stopped at motel to get some sleep? Obviously you never want to leave something out in plain sight but with all the gear in the truck and boat a thief can get to your stuff if he wants it. You guys bring all your stuff in motel or just hope for the best?

I lock up fish finder and tackle box along with other valuables but as for the rest I have a locking tailgate and a boat cover to keep out the honest thieves. I figure rods can be replaced quickly but a lifetime of tackle in the box not so much. They also have a lighted parking area so I figure that helps a bit also.
