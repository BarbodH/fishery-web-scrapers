I know they make UV fishing gloves but wondering if any of you have had luck just cutting the fingers off of something I can find at Menards or Home Depot? I think those dollar store ""one size fits all"" gloves will be to hot and don't have any grip...Might be a dumb question but looking for any suggestions."

I don't use them for sun protection, but more for in the spring/fall when it's cold/wet. They are basically thin gloves.Heck, maybe even some type of sports glove might be good, like for cycling."

I just cut the fingers off a pair of gardening gloves to take with me FRIDAY!!!!!!! But that was more for cold weather which doesn't look likes its gonna be cold anymore."
2820209,lassh,2014-05-21 11:15:00,553,Just get a pair of the brown jersey gloves and cut off the fingers. Cheap and they keep the sun off.

But I have a skin condition that is I do not use these gloves I break out from the sun like I got poison ivy. This conditions just started about 5 years ago and makes sleeping at night impossible because the hands itch so bad, not even a belly full of beer makes it any better. Go with the sun gloves, they are only $20."
2838761,keek,2014-05-27 18:23:00,1003,I got the Simms sun glove and love them. You won't wear something that is uncomfortable and/or bulky - at least I tend not too.
2839881,orchard frank,2014-05-28 05:13:00,1900,"Check a couple of the agricultural supply places, Gempler's, A.M. Leonard. I buy some stretchy (snug fitting) gloves that have a tacky rubber face on them, use them around the farm and for fishing. Haven't cut the fingers off, but I'm sure they would work well, buy them by the dozen."
2840665,Simple Man,2014-05-28 09:03:00,92,"I had been using a thin pair of aviator flight gloves with the fingers cut out in the past, but I agree with this post and have purchased the sun gloves from Cabela's. They were actually on sale for less than 20 bucks. Even the thin gloves I had been using in the past got hot and made my hands sweat. I have to be more disciplined about covering my skin this year....The sun is starting to bother me quite a bit the older I get.....The sun gloves seem like they are going to be very comfortable. I actually bought the sun protective sleeves this year as well. I will wear those when I have on short sleeve SPF protective fishing shirts. Those shirts and sun protective gear are not cheap but its worth it to me. To much sun will ruin a day for me anymore."
