Howey Bay was full of ice and several lakes surrounding Red Lake to the west had ice. Ice out was probably 5/25 ish...Our fishing was difficult all five days. We really only had 2-3 consistent places throughout the lake where we could catch 17-18"" walleyes. These areas were at the bottom of pools/inlets with extremely fast moving water. All the normal spots were dead. We figured the females had just laid their eggs and moved out. The males were in the spawning areas however only biting in the AM and late PM. Fishing between 11a- 5p was pointless. Water temps were in the upper 40s and mid 50s by the time we left. Any females caught had zero fight and acting extremely tired. Fish were not schooled up yet. Makes sense. Id bet we were a week, maybe two to early. My guess is June will be spectacular!Big Northern 43"". jig and minnowBig Walleye 26"". minnow looking rapala"
