Missing is a small natural brook trout lake nestled in high hills about 30 miles west of Wawa near the southern boundary of Pukaskwa National Park. It's really rugged country and very pretty!We lost almost two full days because of weather (couldn't fly in). That was a first for me and made things kind of rushed. Still had a great time with my son though. There was still tons of snow all over the bush and water temps were only 41 degrees which made things VERY tough. Still managed to catch some nice trout though and saw one huge fish (5lb's plus) that followed my sons lure in then turned away. I'd really like to return to this camp again when the water is a bit warmer. Either a bit later in the spring or maybe in September when they're spawning.In any case I put together this short video of the trip, hope you enjoy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dFubizTkTs"
