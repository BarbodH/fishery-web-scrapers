The drive up there was a little traffic construction on 35N just south of Minneapolis other then that the stateside interstates were good. 105 had water across it with warning signs, this made us all nervous. The truck made it no problem, the guys in the car were a little nervous but needless to say we made it no problems. All lakes were ice free until we got to the border and noticed Rainy had some pretty good ice. Our first glance of Lac Seul on 105 was completely ice covered :/. There was lots of ice in our bay and we had to launch boats from a nearby resort that is in the current. First couple of days we were able to make it to Goose Island but then you would hit the ice pack with no openings or way around. So we fished the mouth of the sanctuary a lot and a small creek. One day we counted 22 boats fishing the mouth! Water was cold and fishing was slow. Monday night the bite turned on from 8-9:30, when we came in that night the ice had moved from goose all the way down to the narrows coming our of camp, it was a close call to getting iced in! The next day, Tuesday all the ice had disappeared and we were able to get into Sawmill. We fished all the usual spots but had very limited success, Herbs point, Radar Island, 3 islands, clay banks, black hole. We finally found them back in a creek in 8-10 foot of water off the river channel near a point and the water temp was a little warmer. The other boat put on a clinic for us that day and we watched them boat 10-15 slot and over slot in a row. Nothing under in that time frame, usually ya get a few dinks. The biggest being 27.5"" that day. Our boat could not get a bite and we're sitting 10 feet apart casting at their boat, it was wild! I caught one walleye in the couple hours they were slamming them. It was like watching TV haha. The one I caught was a fat 26"" though! Wednesday the spot was on fire too, I caught a 29.5"" that weighed 8.5lbs! Not my longest but was very heavy! An hour later we hit the sanctuary at dusk again and I caught a 28"" and partner got a 27"". The other boat had quite a few big girls too, biggest being 25"". Right before we left my buddy hooked into something very large, fought it for 5 minutes and it came off before we ever got to see it, the kind of stuff that will haunt you. I've never known the sanctuary to produce size, mostly numbers but it did that night. The next day we went back to sanctuary in the morning and first cast, my buddy got a 30"" walleye! It was justice for losing the fish the night before. He had his go pro on so video will follow, I'm sure the other boats were hating us, roll up and first cast boat that beast! The last night we fished for an hour at the mouth and caught 74 walleyes in that time! Overall it was an interesting year, the ice produced the craziest fog I've ever seen on the lake and on the same day the icepack moved down current, when we got to the trussel bridge we had to play ""frogger"" with the ice zigging and zagging to get back to camp! The fishing was slow at times especially in the beginning of the week but started to heat up midweek. They're not on the usual spots yet so you have to bounce around a little until ya find them. We caught more over the slots then I can remember in past years. We used minnows and leeches, caught fish on both. Vertical jigging was the best method, caught few fish on slip bobbers, nothing trolling and one on a rapala. Size down and fish slow! If ya want numbers, make sure to hit the mouth of Sanctuary and hour or two before sun goes down, it's also nice because we had the spot to ourselves during this time, always a plus! I'm ready to go back already!"

2832881,forgop,2014-05-25 22:39:00,880,"After my first fly-in trip, half the enjoyment is not having to deal with anyone else on the lake. You guys can have at it in pic #3."
2833457,Hawkfan,2014-05-26 07:57:00,237,Sounds like a fun week. Good pics.
2833825,Knoxabilly,2014-05-26 10:43:00,225,"Forgop- I know, due to the ice in the beginning of the week, we were concentrated around one hot spot. Once ice opened we didn't fish near people which is my preference also. If I wanna be surrounded by boats I'll go fish around Iowa"
2834153,Hump,2014-05-26 13:36:00,578,We have stayed at Evergreen for the 10 years. Nice place. Where is this little River off the Sanctuary. Is it to the right as you go into the Sanctuary? Towards the Clay Banks? thanks. We will be up there the 20nth of June
2834825,cton20,2014-05-26 18:53:00,8,"Good post, very nice pics. Looks like you guys found some pigs. My group is headed to Lac Seul on 6/6, we go to the east side of the lake though."
