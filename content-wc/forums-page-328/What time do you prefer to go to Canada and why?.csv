2791545,kzoofisher,2014-05-13 17:59:00,5144,July or August. The local fishing in May and June is too good to walk away from. When the kids get older I might move into September.
2792497,btmbncr,2014-05-13 22:00:00,492,Thanks for all the posts.I would like to make a September trip to Lac Seul and my just get there this year.Bill
2794929,patricktjms,2014-05-14 13:58:00,67,We used to go the second week of June every year for ever. This year we are going to leave July 4th and go up for the following week. I hope the fishing is as good then as it always was in June.
2798105,labsrus,2014-05-15 10:44:00,557,"I like September, usually mid month Seems like the fishing is pretty good at that time of year. Just before hunting season kicks in"
2808545,Breal31,2014-05-18 12:33:00,13,"well, any time is a great time for Canadawith that being said, September would be down my list. The weather is a lot more unpredictable and the days are much shorter. If you only get to go up once or twice a year a trip in June with light until 10:30 PM is a much better buy for your money then September when your at the dock by 7 or so. an extra 3 hours of fishing per day x 7 days is the equivalent to a whole another full day ( and then some) ...just something to think about, I love the longer days"
2838721,reconssd,2014-05-27 18:17:00,147,"Always go between mid July to Mid August. Weeds are plentiful. Thermoclines are established which makes locating fish easier. I've been considering September because I've heard the fishing is still good, with fewer people on the water."
2789225,Fishoil,2014-05-13 08:05:00,1277,"I've fished many times every month from the May opener thru October and they each have their good and bad. Right now the big group I go with goes in mid June and if I had to only go once per year that would probably be my time. The fishing is almost always great, the weather is usually comfortable, and the bugs usually haven't gotten bad yet. May can be cold and wet, July and August can be hot, and September and October can be cold. But with the proper clothing and preparations any of those months can be great too. I wouldn't turn down any Canadian trip just because of when it is."
2789289,LOW1,2014-05-13 08:14:00,2828,"I now try to go four weeks per year. The first week is usually Memorial Day week. Because of the holiday its only four days out of the office instead of five and usually some of the kids don't mind getting pulled out of school or may even be done by then. (This year we missed so much school because of heat in the fall and cold in the winter that the last day of school is June 7 so I am still trying to figure out the logistics of how this will work this year.) I always try to be there over Canada Day because it also is a short work week because of July 4. The first or second week in August is the ""family vacation"" where everyone goes. And Labor Day week or else a week in late September."
2789305,bones82,2014-05-13 08:17:00,121,"We go opening week. Fewer bugs, less heat, great fishing, easy to sit around the fire at night, and it scratches that itch I've had to fish open water all winter long. I also have a long Memorial Day Weekend to come home to. What a way to start the summer."
2789537,Gregking,2014-05-13 09:08:00,2658,"Growing up from birth to college dad took me the first week of August. I missed the college years due to I had no money. Started going back in '94, bought my first boat and from there always went the first week of August. A few years ago we went over the 4 th of July then back again the first week of August and the fishing was the same. Dad went that time of the yr because he was a farmer and we had nothing to do then. I don't care either July or August because fishing the Missouri is slow. Now I go the last of July first of August because my daughter is between Summer softball and fall softball right then. I take my dad and my youngest daughter with me. I want to spend as much time as I can with them while I can. Fishing with them is just a side note to the time spent on the trip."
2789729,JAY221,2014-05-13 10:07:00,877,"The first week after the 4th of July is when we end up going. I have to be home on the 4th as all the family comes to my house to gather & celebrate.I like the stable weather & the fishing has always been good no matter where we have gone. I do have to say that in 2001 we saw the temperature drop 42 degrees overnight & the rain kind of floated down. Later, Jay"
2789985,SinOrSwim,2014-05-13 10:54:00,1528,"When we first started we went late August. Had a year that might have been more mid-august but we mostly go in early to mid-september. Originally, it was temperature related. We are all very warm blooded and sleeping in a hot cabin was not our preference. However, lately does't seem to matter. We have been going in September for years now and the last 4 or 5 have been hotter than crap. Had a few trips where it never really cooled down at night either. One in particular about 4 years ago. I am taking my oldest son who will be 9 the first week of August. Never been that early. Our guys trip is early September this year. I'm hoping it goes back to decent days and cool/cold nights. I like coming in and needing a fire in the cabin. Haven't done that in a few years. Too **** hot"
2791385,MuskyMaster,2014-05-13 17:25:00,79,"This is my first time going in early may, first 2 weeks of june are always good. I will never go in July or early August again, ive had good weather but ive also had 100 degrees for the entire week. Still caught fish but not as good as normal. Last year I was in the UP in the middle of August and booked a cabin based on it having AC, welllll they got record cold temps that week and the AC was never on.... I'd say early june is the best as well as early September."
2791441,packpro,2014-05-13 17:36:00,695,"15 out of 17 years we have booked the first full week of June. No matter what time you have to be somewhat adaptable. We had a week 95F plus for 6 straight days. One year earlier- rain and sleet. Temps between 38F and 50F. High winds and rains. High water-low water. We've hit the spawn and the post spawn. We've hit the mayflies. Always caught fish, just fished different areas, different ways. The camp hands are a trusted resource and have always treated us well with the best information."
2791449,port1042,2014-05-13 17:37:00,509,"Memorial Day week will be my 4th trip in the past 2 years and my second ""spring trip"". I've done two fall trips (Labor Day Week). All at the same lodge (Manotak on Perrault Lake) and I'll be headed back in the fall this year. Spring and Fall are different and I'm not sure which I like best. We've had better weather in the fall and maybe even more fish -- but there is something about the early trip I really enjoy. Maybe it's just that I'm back on the water after the cruel winter. Next spring I'm going to Alaska so I'll miss my Onterio trip in the spring. My grandkids are getting to the age when I'd like to take them with me (currently 10 and 7) so I may need to adjust to the 2nd week in June to accommodate school schedules. We'll see. I guess the best time is when you can go!"

2788273,btmbncr,2014-05-12 21:09:00,492,"I just survived my 64th Birthday party ribeye steak and lobster feed.I got Allman Brothers""Eat a Peach Album"" cranked in the headphones with a splash of single malt over a couple of ice cubes.My thoughts turned toward Canada trips when and why that time of the season. My parents started going to Ontario early in season,like the opener,and after a few years switched to later in the season.Mid July through mid August was their preferred time. My father's reason was more stable weather,less bugs and the walleyes were schooled up,more concentrated,and he thought easier to find and catch.My mother said she liked the warmer weather,less bugs,blueberries were ripe and a good walleye bite. I've always fished locally early in the season and except,one trip,fished mid July to some time up to mid August.The one trip I made earlier we had miserable weather, it rained 13 days out of the 14 days we were there and cold temps. 46 degrees was the high for the two weeks.It got down to freezing 2 nights in an unheated cabin.Still caught lots of walleyes and some big fish. Now since I introduced my wife to walleye fishing on Lac Seul we prefer mid July through mid August.We've had good weather,can't complain about the bugs,blueberries are ripe,the walleyes seem to be schooled up in deep water and are fairly easy to find with electronics and catch. I don't have as much experience on as many different Canadian lakes as some of you.I have only fished Berry Lake,Dryberry Lake,Umfreville(sp)(Halley's Camp), Lake of the Woods and Lac Seul in Ontario.Clearwater Lake in Manitoba one fall for Lake Trout. Just curious as to when others chose to go to Canada fishing.Bill"
2788321,Baitslinger,2014-05-12 21:21:00,93,"Growing up, we fished NWO almost every week of the summer at one point or another. No real pattern to it, fishing was always pretty good.Now, as a ""grown up"" with a wife who is a teacher, and two kids in school, we still do a family trip (including grandparents), but it has been over the week of July 4 for the past five or six years. Fishing is always pretty good then, we have good days, great days, and bad days too. Weather has been a problem-- temps in the 90's+, which is hard on the older folks, and I'd much rather fish in cool weather than broiling heat. We also hit the mayfly hatch, but I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing sometimes.We pick that week because it fits all our schedules, and its the slowest week at our camp. I guess that should tell us something too??Outfitter says that August would be his chosen month if he had to pick a time to fish, for the reason you mention-- stable weather, fish schooled on mid lake reefs & structure, and just overall less variability. I'd love to fish earlier in June when its a bit cooler, or later in August or even Sept, but in order to meet everyones schedule, we'll probably keep going during the same time frame. Someday when the kids are grown and we retire, maybe we'll do a fall trip, but without the kids . . . what fun would that be anyway? With any luck, we'll be taking our own grandkids someday!"
2788377,@Lunker,2014-05-12 21:36:00,835,"Over the years I've been up there each of the months between June and sept. Fishing seems ""faster"" in June but I love how quiet it is in Sept. 'Course, those are the months with the greatest chance of inclement weather. Like the deep water fishing in July. August gets just a wee bit warm for me. But as long as I'm fortunate enough to keep going, any month works for me."
2788433,Fishin Fun,2014-05-12 22:24:00,218,"I used to fish Canada in late May or early June when I went with my dad. After he passed we started going in July because my father-in-law doesn't like to be ""cold"" while fishing. Now we've pushed it back further until the first week in August because my 2 boys play a lot of summer baseball and I don't want to miss any of it and they are usually done by then except for a few fall baseball games. But by that time of the year, I'm ok to miss a couple games. I honestly don't have a preference on when I go just as long as I go."
2788866,MrSimon,2014-05-13 06:43:00,922,"There are pros and cons to everything, and it really comes down to personal preference and scheduling. Personally, I prefer late August. Warm days, nights cool off a bit, very few bugs, doesn't interfere with family vacations and stuff like that. And the fishing is just fine."
2789057,Aaron-IN,2014-05-13 07:35:00,500,"I like to go 37-40 days after ice out, but I'm a bass fisherman."
2789065,nitrodude,2014-05-13 07:35:00,60,"My group and I travel up to LS/Sioux Lookout for the last week of June and first week of July each year for some fantastic fishing, fellowship, and relaxation. My FIL started the yearly tradition in 1964 and has kept it a yearly consecutive, male only trip since. Over the years we've made our sons eligible to join us at 10 yrs. old, depending on maturity and ability to handle a day's excursion, and many have continued the tradition consecutively as well. I married into this wonderful legacy in 1995 and haven't missed a trip since. My son is anticipating his upcoming fourth trip at the ripe old age of 14 and I'm quite convinced he plans on carrying on the tradition with his sons, should he be blessed with one or more. We are both looking forward to next year when his little brother will be able to join us as the new, youngest ""man"" of the troop. ""Pops"" (my FIL) turns 80 this year and is the cornerstone of this ever expanding group and even though his time in the boats is not as long as he'd like, he still looks forward to it just as much as he did 50 years ago when he unknowingly created this family tradition. (We are making this a VERY special 50th anniversary trip for him this year!) It started out as a weekend drive up from Chicago, fish the week, then the weekend drive back home. Over the years it grew to our current schedule with 10 days of fishing and exploring and a weekend up and back for the road travelers. Coming from GA the timing couldn't be any better. About the time we are averaging 95 degrees and 95% humidity we board a plane and exit into the dry cool air of a Canada Summer for a couple of weeks. That combined with the yearly reunion of family, our local friends (who are like our family) and the opportunity to enjoy the beauty and recreation our neighbors to the north have maintained is the legacy I want my sons to appreciate and pass down to theirs as long as there is a Lac Seul to visit and enjoy. I start counting down the days back on the flight home every year."
2789081,mrpike24,2014-05-13 07:39:00,54,"We have been going to LOTW in mid-June but have been up in late May and all weeks in July. In June, you seem to find fish just about everywhere, they can seem a tad scattered and not as concentrated as late May or even in July on Reefs or Humps. Late May was always tough to find big fish, as they seemed to be in recovery mode from the Spawn. June/July was always better for bigger fish, with my preference probably being June, just because of all the different ways you could pick up fish. May was a great time to fish, as bigger Northern still were pretty shallow and the Smallmouth were in pre-spawn mode and all congregated in the shallows, walleye numbers were often very good as well. July the heat could get pretty bad and the flied/mosquitos definitely were a problem on certain days! Will be up one month from today and can't wait!"
2789113,jimirjr,2014-05-13 07:48:00,1149,"Mid/Late Sept. on LOW for Us... NO BUGS, very few other people... Weather can be cooler, or Hotter, You never know.. Fish are deeper, bigger and hungrier... Tougher to pattern, but once you do... IT'S ON!!! Scenery is always beautiful at that time, too!"
2789145,camp chef,2014-05-13 07:49:00,915,"We have pretty much settled on the last week of May. We prefer the cooler weather and there seems to be less people.The fishing can be awesome. If money and time allows, we sometimes take a second trip in September.. Again the weather is usually cooler and we see less people."
