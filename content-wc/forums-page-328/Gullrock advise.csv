2817305,Los Pollos Hermanos,2014-05-20 16:53:00,10,"I have not made it over the border in 5 years. I have fished Lac Seul as well as Nungessor and Minaki multiple times. Gullrock Lake will be my next Canadian Lake destination shortly. I am about as excited as I can be right now. I turned down an offer to follow my wife up to bed last night to organize my Canada tackle bag and choose which poles are making the trek north. ( I have never claimed to be smart) I will be staying at Golden Hook on June 7. I have never been on the lake. Anyone know a guide I can hire to show me around the first day? I am nervous about being up there so early in the year. I usually go in July. Based on weather, am I hitting the lake in the middle of the spawn this year? Should I have pushed this to later? I usually fish with leaches. Is this too early for them? Should we go minnow? Any advise would help. Last question, I am hoping to catch the Hawks carry around Lord Stanley's cup on one of my first nights there. What bar in Red Lake do I watch the game? Do I wear my red Seabrook sweater, or go with Toews? (both are Canadians)"
2817665,tackleman,2014-05-20 18:16:00,444,"gullrock is a great lake to fish, im sure that people in camp will be happy to mark up a map for you. most people use minnows to fish but I know there are die hard leech people out there too. I guess it's really up to you but I'm a minnow guy if I had a preference. if you want someone to show you around, give me a call, I can take you out for a couple hours. you can reach me at 728-2124 as far as going to the bar to watch the game, I would suggest that you try to watch the game at camp since the drinking and driving issues up here are pretty stiff and the police are always watching the bar parking lots. (besides at over 4 bucks a beer, camp is a lot cheaper)"
2818825,P&y only,2014-05-21 05:52:00,133,I refuse to answer this because you turned down........................to pack your stuff. You coulda packed 8 minutes later! LOL
2819097,kzoofisher,2014-05-21 07:36:00,5144,8 minutes? I thought Canada was the only place I had to step up my game.
2822945,GWC,2014-05-22 03:29:00,1021,We've had execellent luck trolling bandit 200 & 300 about 75 - 100 feet behind our boat. Three Sisters & Fisherman's Point are both good areas for walleye. Color doesn't appear to matter much. Watch out for the big northern's. We've taken several 44 & 46 inchers on these lures too.
2823273,luv2fishcanada,2014-05-22 06:14:00,41,After last nights performance your Blackhawks may be playing golf on June 7th. Good luck fishing. I'll be there the same time.
2825009,Fishin Fun,2014-05-22 13:37:00,218,I agree with Tackleman. Gullrock is a great lake to fish. It isn't overly big which is nice. Agreed. The resort can mark plenty of areas for you to fish. You don't have much worry about rocks either. I like that too. We've fished Gullrock for many years and usually use minnows and leaches with jigs. Have not used crawlers much at all. I really don't think there is much need for a guide. Just get a lake map or take up Tackleman on his offer. That's an offer that can't be refused. Have fun!
2827593,jkwildhunting,2014-05-23 11:20:00,361,"I agree..... You do NOT need a guide. If you want to pay tackleman or someone then thats your choice, but gull rock is a pretty easy lake to fish. Bring an assortment of jigs from 1/4 oz to 1/2oz incase its a windy day. Also bottom bouncers and spinners/slow death are our favorite method to fish.We ALWAYS bring a flat of night crawlers with us when we come in June and then again in September. Pulling slow death has become our new favorite for the lake as I prefer to search.We always bring minnows out with us and if leeches are in season we bring them there have been days we have noticed that they wont touch leech then the next day you will go throught 5 dozen leeches...Last late June many guys on the lake found the fish in 2-5fow so search and your camp will/should mark up some good spots to try.A few of the community holes are The Flats, Burnt Island, The Boot, Fisherman's point, 3 sisters, Stephson Point (spelling maybe be wrong). If you go over June 15 I think you can fish back up in Ranger Bay I believe as they close that down for the spawn.Send me a PM if you need more help on spots to try or lures. Tackleman is a standup guy and is on the lake few times a week so he stays up with the reports and knows where some fish are being caught but truthfully you will NOT have a issue getting on fish!Good luck and Be Safe."

2847065,Minnow Man,2014-05-29 21:15:00,85,"Once you arrive in camp Machelle will issue you with a paper lake map and mark the current fishing hot spots. Keith the fellow who works the docks will give the most current fishing reports. The fellow in the black Alumacraft boat with the 150 Yamaha on it has fished the lake for over 40 years, talk with Don he is like a free guide & you can even follow him out onto the lake. Lots of repeat guests in that week, just walk into the fish cleaning house and ask a few of the guys what depth they caught their fish at. Tell them your new to the lake and they'll want to impress you with their knowledge. Like Tackelman said watch the game on your t.v. in your cottage and you'll be able to return to Canada for future trips. One D.U. I. and your done for 10 years. Have a great trip."
