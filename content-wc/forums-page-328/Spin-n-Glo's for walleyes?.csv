2842513,itsme,2014-05-28 17:08:00,31,"I took my brother-in-law To Camp and he liked the way the Spin & Glo looked... He had not fished for 30 or so years. We were @ Bull Moose Camp so I took him to the second island from camp, He hooked and I netted a 24"" walleye on the first troll past the point. To make the matters worse he was using my rod/reel & Spin & Glo rigs I tied. Then he caught 3 hogs in three separate days (2) @ 30+"" and one 31+""... My best is 29 1/2 in more than 50 yrs fishing Ontario water. I do use them from time to time and have caught many walleyes but not a 30"" YET."
2842593,rnnonmt,2014-05-28 17:43:00,992,LOL. Real fisherman dont have any pink colored lures.... The color is bubble-gum Geez
2799969,btmbncr,2014-05-15 20:35:00,492,"I've been looking at them for a couple of years.I finally got some,tied up some single hook leaders so I can fish minnows,1/2 a crawler or leeches with them. Does any one use them in Canada for walleyes with success? Thanks. Bill"
2800009,TinmanDon,2014-05-15 20:42:00,194,"Oh no the secret's out....lol One of my go to set ups on LOTW...spin n glow, crawler harness or single hook with leech is dynamite on walleyes, also works good with plastic worms"
2800073,LoDo,2014-05-15 21:20:00,721,"Probably different, but i crushed walleyes with a UV #9 Rapala last year early season. White and pink."
2804753,MorganMan,2014-05-17 07:17:00,341,"Never bought any and I don't know if I even knew they existed? I'm taking my youngest son this year so maybe that will be our secret weapon? BTMBNCR, we head to Lac Seul after you are there, let us know how they do?"
2806009,Pooch,2014-05-17 18:21:00,4619,"Several years ago on Birch Lake, Ontario if you were not pulling a green/white/pink spin-n-glo you were not catching any fish. Never saw anything like it. That was the last time I had much luck with them. I still bring some to Canada every year, but they have not been a good producer since back on Birch. Go figure.Pooch"
2841449,flntknp17,2014-05-28 12:01:00,151,I've used the Yakima ones for most of my life on walleyes.......don't tell anyone!Matt
2841609,bcmss396,2014-05-28 12:48:00,296,We've been using them for years. The Beaver Flick in Grand Marias sells all varieties. Blair
2841873,Mike Kansas,2014-05-28 13:51:00,1463,Don't let BTMBCR fool you . His favorite lure is a hand gernade in Char or Pink. Mike Kansas
2842297,btmbncr,2014-05-28 15:41:00,492,Mike-I like to use them behind a 1.5 oz bottombouncer.
