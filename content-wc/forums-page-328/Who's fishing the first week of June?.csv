2793609,Pikeslayer8,2014-05-14 07:48:00,1460,"I'm crossing on the 1st and staying at the Rendezvous Inn in Ft Frances. Fly out early on Monday the 2nd, for a week of fishing bliss on Wabakimi!"
2795801,Guest,2014-05-14 18:29:00,0,We are staying at Gold Pines in Ear Falls and fishing Lac Seul during the 1st week of June.
2795945,ftfarms,2014-05-14 18:58:00,444,We are crossing on the 30 th of may driving straight to the camp. We're staying at grassy narrows on lake of the woods out of morson Ontario.
2797257,jkaup,2014-05-15 07:35:00,56,"8 of us will be crossing at Int. Falls May 30th. 8 Days of pike and walleye at Kenoji Lake with Pipestone Fly-In Outposts. It will be my third trip in less than 10 years. Started packing yesterday, plenty of new gear to bring!"
2797417,Pikeslayer8,2014-05-15 08:04:00,1460,"Sounds incredible, we will be just on the other side of the Wabakimi inlet to Kenoji at the same time, also group of 8. Please provide trip report. Pipestone has a camp on Wabakimi and from what I've seen, he runs a nice camp with better boats and motors than my outfitter, Northern Wilderness Outfitters. The guy, (Pipestone owner) is one heck of a fisherman. I watched him put on a display several years back on Wabakimi that left me impressed as he was guiding a group at the same fishing hole I was in."
2800937,Camoclad,2014-05-16 06:36:00,628,"We will post up some reports/results when we return. Mike is a good fisherman and as far as scheduling and preparing for the trip, dealing with PFO couldn't be easier (not to mention clean cabins, dry boats, new(er) motors,etc) . I will let jkaup chime in, though his first trip with Mike was to Wabakimi. I hope you and your group has a good time as well."
2801161,Pikeslayer8,2014-05-16 07:21:00,1460,"Thanks Camoclad. While surfing the web last night, I made contact with another of Mike's customers. Turns out that he will be on Wabakimi the same time we are. He shared this story with me.......... ""I didn't know my neighbor(he lives six houses north of me) until after my Kenoji Trip I took W L Wellers with me. Sipping in it one evening, our guide said, "" We have a customer from Oklahoma that brings Wellers."" I said, ""I'm from Oklahoma. What town is your customer from?"" Guide said, "" Sand Springs."" I said, ""I'm from Sand Springs. What's his name?"" He said, ""*** *****."" I said, ""He lives six houses north of me, but I've never met him."" He said, "" When you get home, go introduce yourself."" I did, and a friendship was born. We went to Wabakimi together last year. And, are going together this June."" It is a small world. I also wish you fellas have a great trip and if I get swept down the falls, I'll be looking for a guy who is clad in camo for rescue."

2807657,jkaup,2014-05-18 08:30:00,56,"Hi Pikeslayer8, My first trip up was with my wife to Wabakimi with Mike at PFO. We had a blast! Was week 2 of the season. When we landed there was about 4 ft of ice on the island out in front of the cabin in the big water. Wind was whipping and we wanted to go take some photos before it melted...big mistake! We got out of the protection of the trees around the river and the waves nearly swamped us! We turned tail and ran up the river for some back bay pike fishing. Not sure if you have been there before? We explored and fished around the islands down the lake one day and happened to come up on an old cabin. Someone on here has written about it if you search for trappers cabin. Good read. Not much left of it now. A bunch of old turpentine cans and rotten logs. You are right about Mike and his fishing skill!!! We had never fished for walleye and had only caught 3 fish in 2 days. He came on a check flight and took us out. Within 30 minutes he had us on a pile of walleyes. We boated over 40 fish in less than 30 minutes between the two of us one evening about 7pm. Our best walleye fishing was across the main body of water where the big falls dumps into Wabakimi. We tried up near the falls but found them easiest caught back trolling the edge of an eddy 2-3 hundred yards back from the falls. Jig on the bottom with minnow. No Plastic. Pike were hot up the river in the bays near the weeds and submerged rocks. Casting topwater or trolling spoons made for some great battles! Hope you have a great time on Wabakimi! Oh, look for moose near your cabin in the afternoon! We saw a big female and calf over that way."
2791665,P&y only,2014-05-13 18:43:00,133,Just wanna know who's gonna be in line at the border with me. Where are you headed? Good Luck to everyone!
2791873,Golden Eagle,2014-05-13 19:29:00,2642,"Arriving in camp May 31. 30th consecutive year, but late for opener last two years due to rescheduling because of ice. Need to be sure because I drive 1500 miles one way and two guys drive 1900 miles one way. Would be a long haul to stay in town waiting for ice to make up it's mind. Where are you headed?"
2791913,P&y only,2014-05-13 19:31:00,133,Pakwash for me. 7th year I think

2792849,The Donger,2014-05-14 04:23:00,48,A fly in on McInnes Lake through Viking Outposts in Red Lake. The walleye bite may be suspect due to the late ice out but the lake trout should be shallow. We'll catch plenty of fish. It's hard not to up there.
2792873,liner,2014-05-14 05:17:00,5,Crossing the border on 5/31. Fly out to Cobham lake with Amik Outposts on 6/1. I'm going to be pretty much useless at work the next two weeks.
