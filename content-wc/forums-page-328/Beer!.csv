I tend to like smoother beers now and drink either Leinnies Honeywiess, Alaskan Pale ale, Kayak KÃ¶lsch brewed in Duluth, Miller draft or Grain Belt Premium. All about personal preference and if you want to remember what you did today, tomorrow. Al"

I know when I was coming up and turned 21, before Mike's Hard Lemonade and all this sugar n caffeinated junked up stuff, there was a lemon brew called One eyed Jack made out of a Wilkes-Barre microbrewery that was pretty strong and flavorful... Also, if you want some bang for the buck, I believe I got it when in Canada, they had something called Maximum Ice n was like wine strong @ 12%, anybody remember/ know of that?Sent from my LGMS323 using Tapatalk"
2802953,MikeinMN,2014-05-16 14:34:00,190,"I like to bring a 12 or so of something not available in Canada to share with our lodge owner. If you travel through WI, Spotted Cow from New Glarus is absolutely not available outside WI, yet seemingly available everywhere in WI, and is an excellent choice for a summer beer. I usually pick up a little Molson Export while in Canada for the same reason, despite its name, Molson Export is not exported."

I'm surprised the Labatt emblem wasn't more apparent, I probably thought it was generic, but back then we never drank premium beer only the cheapest stuff, so that must have been a bonus that day...

2789489,Ranger319,2014-05-13 08:58:00,166,"Looking at trying a new beer or 3 during this year's trip. I am generally a light beer drinker - Coors/Bud/Miller, but also like a little darker beer from time to time. Killians, Fat Tire, etc always seem to be in my fridge at home as well. I've had Kokanee and liked it. Blue's are always good. Is there any other that stand out that are worth trying? That Beer store in Sioux Lookout has my name on it!"
2789561,ftfarms,2014-05-13 09:23:00,444,I've tried a lot of beers and its all about your own taste but I haven't found a beer for me that's even close to KOKANEE. I wish I could get it at home.

I am no expert on beer selection, but I really like the PBR. Blue is one of my favorites and I love a hoppy IPA for a change of pace. Lots of good stuff out there!"

2792817,forgop,2014-05-14 02:28:00,880,"My dad had Caffreys Irish Ale when he was in England many years ago and loved it. Can't get it in the states. Back in 2007, he was in really bad shape and we took a road trip together and got a keg in Windsor. Border agents seemed quite puzzled why 2 guys would drive 10 hours round trip for beer. He barely even drank anything out of it, but it was the last trip we had to spend much quality time together as he went downhill really quick later that fall. I think I'll make it a point to pick up some Caffrey's on every trip in the future in his memory."
