6152865,Duflebag,2018-04-23 15:12:00,218,You might try an independant guide that has partnerships with camps. I know that Cal Ritchie from the Eagle Lake area is a world class guide. I have fished with him many times and know he is recognized as a top tier guide. Cal has arrangments with several camps in the Vermilion Bay area where his clients stay at the partner camp and Cal guides them fishing. There are several guides in that area that have similar arrangements. Do some work on google and contact some of those guides.

6155257,bthomas3333,2018-04-24 15:12:00,465,I have researched the heck out of this. Some high end places will definitely up-charge you to fish alone. Although if you were flexible and looked at slower season (aug/sept?) I would guess you might be able to make a deal on the up-charge. Some places are totally fine with taking a single but before I throw out names it would help to know the budget. Less than 2k? 2k-4k? Unlimited?I will also say the places listed above are all three quality experiences.Brett

6155513,zeebee,2018-04-24 18:27:00,1144,"I used to do a lot of solo ...quite enjoy it. Never found a lodge that wouldn't cater however some require a premium to be paid. If you want to go to a lodge high in demand, consider off peak weeks and the premium might disappear. Research and negotiate. Cal Ritchie (Eagle Lake) is very client oriented but musky fixated once season opens."
