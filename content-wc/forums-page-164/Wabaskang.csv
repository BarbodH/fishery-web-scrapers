6112834,JAY221,2018-04-05 18:04:00,877,"July 14-20 @ Sleepy Dog Cabins. I hope the water is up a little bit but it won't ruin my time there if it isn't. Have a good time. Later, Jay"
6113282,billy weaver,2018-04-05 20:48:00,470,"I'll be at Peffley's camp June16 for my 31st trip to Wabaskang. Last year was a good year and I hope 2018 will be the same. The walleye fishing in 2017 was about average but man did we get into some big yellow perch, not a good substitute for walleye but it was a lot of fun. How did you do last year? Billy Weaver"
6113346,AB,2018-04-05 21:46:00,61,I will be there August 4th. First trip was in 1972.

Marked a lot but only caught enough for one nights meal, all kinds of bait fish were marking so I'm guessing they were well fed. One guy caught a Musky up in McCloud. Bill where did you get into the big perch? What on?"
6115434,JAY221,2018-04-06 17:58:00,877,"The wife & I did okay last year but the daughter was the big winner in a boat with her husband. She got a 27 1/2 & a 29"" walleye off of Big Nose Island where the channel runs by there. Pulling deep reef runners worked for her in the deep water. She was extremely happy & they were both put back unharmed. Later, Jay"
6115458,billy weaver,2018-04-06 18:04:00,470,I never have fished Wabaskang south of the indian village. The yellow perch we caught were in the back of a bay with a stream entering. We had caught walleye out in front of the bay but fishing was slow and we happened to drift into the bay in about 3 to 4 ft. of water. You could see a mud bottom with old decayed vegetation on bottom. We started catching 12 inch fat yellow perch with no worms. We used jigs and a piece of nightcrawler but I think they would hit about anything. Four of us in two boats ended up catching about 110 nice perch. When we cleaned them they were full of crawdads. I have friends who fish Wabaskang in August. They fish deep water humps in 15 to 20 ft. of water. I would try a bottom bouncer or a three way with weight pulling a nightcrawler rig or a crankbait. You could go to a jig when you find them. I am a long way from a expert but that is what I would try. Billy

Water level was high and fish were shallow. Caught and released my PB walleye (27.5"") and numbers were +/-50 walleyes per boat per day! Can't wait!"
