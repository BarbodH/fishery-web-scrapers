I've been there 3 times now and am slated to go back again this year. I'm going to keep going back until I can't do it anymore!My first two trips were in June when things are usually much easier to figure out. If you've ever wondered how to go about targeting and catching giant pike in the fall on northern shield lakes, read on and see how I did it! Cheers, Mike https://www.canadafishingguide.net/g...-caribou-lake/"
6174241,adempsey2.0,2018-05-04 22:08:00,612,Excellent write-up! It's such an awesome lake and a spectacular camp. A place that I would not hesitate to return year after year. The Brodhagen's are truly wonderful hosts as well. You would truly be hard pressed to find a better venue in Ontario.
6174441,Larry S,2018-05-05 07:35:00,665,"This Lake is AWESOME!!! I have fished it Twice First time in 2007 with Brodhagens at North Caribou Camp . We stayed in single cabin on other side of Island from main camp. Even when we went it was a bit High$$$$$ for me. Last year we fished North Caribou with Pete Johnsons Pickle Lake Outposts. A Basic Fishing Camp which had all the stuff necessary for a great trip. Fishing was just as good as at the more Expensive Camp. We had Large 17 ft boats with electric start 25's. shower, but outhouses which were fine. A Basic Camp at around $800 less. We had to drive to Pickle lake which for our group is fine Depending upon what you are looking for ,You can fish this GREAT lake with Two Options More$$$$ or Cheaper with SAME GREAT Fishing Our group is going back June 27 to July 6th to Pickle Lake Outposts North Caribou Lake this Year . Bob Kerr & Myself will Post a Report when we get back If anyone has any questions or is interested in the Pickle Lake Outpost ,Please don't hesitate to message me Larry S"
6174593,Mike Borger,2018-05-05 09:24:00,1554,The big differences between the two camps are:1. North Caribou is centrally located whereas Pete Johnson's is in the NW corner. It would be a very long run to fish some of my spots from Pete Johnson's camp.2. Logistically it's a lot easier to fly from Thunder Bay compared to Pickle Lake. I could never fly out of Pickle Lake.That said it's definitely a good option if you don't mind the extra drive to get to the jump off point or the longer boat runs. It's certainly cheaper!
6174977,Larry S,2018-05-05 15:20:00,665,"Mike I understand from your perspective why you like North Caribou Camps . First it your Job and money isn't that important as time. For me being retired, I have the time and saving around $800 I can use it to go on another trip. Also I like to drive and the drive to Pickle is only about 5 hours more I can also see being centrally located its a lot better for you as you run around looking for pike to film. Pete's camp at the NW Part of Lake has tons of spots to fish and as we fish walleye most of the time its good for our fishing needs. We seldom motored over 45 minutes to fish last year Anyway have a Great Year and catch a Ton of fish I will post a Report & Pictures of our trip for 2018 Larry S"
6175233,Mike Borger,2018-05-05 17:59:00,1554,"Larry, I don't typically ""run around looking for pike to film"", but I get your point LOL!Anyhow it's a good camp, never said it wasn't and it's definitely a great lake!"
