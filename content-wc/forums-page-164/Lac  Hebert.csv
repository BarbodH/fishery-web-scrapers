6150521,Lktrician,2018-04-22 18:27:00,32,Earlier to day I posed a question on how the fishing is on Lac Hebert. I tried to see if other members would post their reports about how well the fishing on this Lac.i tried to explain that I was not trying to offend anyone or show disbelief in what they reported..It seems from the views and only one reply that I in fact insulted the original poster. For this I apologize. This will most certainly be my one and only flyin trip I will drive from South Carolina to Clova to airfield about 28 to 30 hours. I'm close to seventy years old. All I really wanted was to hear from others about their experiences. Some positive reinforcement that I was making a good choice. To those I offended even in a mild way i certainly and sincerely apologize. No offense intended
