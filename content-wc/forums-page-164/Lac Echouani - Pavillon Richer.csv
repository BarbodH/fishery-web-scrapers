555270,Guest,2006-03-08 12:19:00,0,Never been up but it's pretty far north. I would be on the look out for rough road.

555313,retire55,2006-03-09 21:17:00,1029,"I did a search for Lac Echouani on a Quebec fishing site - see http://quebecpeche.com/ The site is in French. From the three threads available, the following information was gleaned: 1. Over 70 miles of gravel road which sometimes is apparently rough. 2. There are some big walleyes and northerns in the lake. 3. Apparently, there's lots of submerged trees watch require attention 4. Six guys for 4 days caught only 2 walleyes in the summer of 2003 5. The same threads recommended another outfitter - see http://www.menjo.qc.ca/default.htm Menjo provides access to 20 lakes and northerns, walleyes, lake trout and speckled trout are available. Unfortunately, this site is French only too. There is an email address if you have any interest. Many times, outfitter sites in Quebec will only be in French but the owner also speaks English. And Menjo is closer to civilization."
