4875833,1K1MOA,2016-05-27 10:58:00,90,"Yes, it is well marked. Maybe two intersections you need to pay attention at, but no problem taking it. It is gravel, and as you approach some of the uphill (and downhill) sections, it is common to hit what I call washboards, so you need to be ready for it, because it will bounce you around. Just slow down and it is fine. In my Xterra Pro 4X I run it at about 40 MPH in 4WD (because it is more stable when you hit the washboards). Those are caused by the logging trucks using the road. Just straddle the middle (except on hills or curves of course) and you will miss most of the rough stuff. It is about 20 miles shorter than 11 to 584 and time wise about 15 - 20 minutes (mostly because of two towns you go through if on 11/584. Another option is to take Crib rd (right before Longlac) which cuts the corner to 584. That also will save you about 10 minutes and put you back on asphalt.An hour on gravel (all lit up) at night will let your party know they are truly in the boonies. At that time, you probably won't see any other vehicles at all. I have run it at 4AM with my off-road lights on and you will see some wildlife. We saw a couple of wolves and a bear last September when we were on Blueberry. There are moose in that area, and if you hit one it will be like hitting a wall. I personally think that is a greater risk on 584 since your speed tends to be higher. My point is light things up well on the sides of the road if you are driving at that hour and be alert because that is prime time for them to be moving around.Hope this helps.We are heading back up next Friday. Have a great trip."
4876193,515,2016-05-27 14:01:00,254,Just my opinion but stick to the paved road especially that time of the night. We did it once the ten times up and did paved after that.
4876273,Fishoil,2016-05-27 15:07:00,1277,I was just coming off a lake on the road one night when bingo ended in Longlac. The locals don't seem to have any qualms about using it at night. It looked like a mini convoy heading towards Nakina.
4876385,"6'3""",2016-05-27 16:25:00,47,Last May as we neared Lower Twin Lakes area about 3 miles of the road was as bad as any road we have ever traveled. It was all rutted up from spring travel with very deep ruts. Not worth the miles saved
4879337,adempsey,2016-05-29 13:56:00,963,"We were just on there yesterday. Most of it was good, some deep ruts at a various places which bounced us around really good. One section was quite muddy and we slid around a bit. It had just rained though. I have an SUV, but a truck would be much better on that road.Saves some time, but not sure I would bother with it next trip up to Nakina. I personally wouldn't be on it at 3AM."
