6159881,Lktrician,2018-04-26 20:52:00,32,I was waiting to hear what one of my group's Doctor's has to say and it seems his Doctor would not ok his going. He needs dialysis and said it would be too long between treatments. You guys that have diabetes please take it seriously. Thanks for your support maybe next year will be different
6161393,kzoofisher,2018-04-27 16:35:00,5144,Sorry to hear that. Good luck to your friend.
6161849,fishron,2018-04-28 05:19:00,317,Sorry to hear one of your guys can't go. Thought I'd let you know about this possibility.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=665705

This yr is looking like a late ice out for sure.making the south end of the lake the best place to fish until the deep pools in the north warm. Make catching a few big girls the first and second week in june possible.The south side of the island as well as behind it always produce some nice size Walleye.Wind direction on this lake is always key, Many guys have caught their personal best ,Size and Numbers on this lake. My guys have a nine day stay this yr. good luck"
6179033,octanehi5,2018-05-08 05:39:00,1104,"Its looking like ice out will be after the 20th,just my guess, temps still below freezing at night,hopefully be gone for the opener"
6179065,Freytown,2018-05-08 06:04:00,770,Ice maybe still around but it can leave quickly with the rain and higher temps. It is what it is....stay tuned. FT
6149953,Lktrician,2018-04-22 09:23:00,32,My small group has taken at least 10 yearly trips to a different lac in Quebec. Maybe we are naive but have never experienced fishing remotely productive as others have reported at this lake. Reports talk about catching hundreds and hundreds of walleye over the course a week. Is the fishing this good? Have we been foolish going back to a spot that has never really produced? I hesitated to write this posting not wanting to offend others yet never saw or heard anyone report this kind of success. Is it really this good?
6150449,fishron,2018-04-22 17:10:00,317,"The short answer is yes, Hebert is that good. Why? is an interesting question. Twelve miles long and a maximum depth not much over sixty feet and not much of that. In my opinion that, coupled with vast schools of baitfish I have marked accounts for it's productivity. There is no dead, deep water in Hebert, just one big horror story for anything under eight inches. I won't reiterate some of my former posts. I'm not a liar, have no money coming to me for singing Heberts praises. It's a phenomenon. Will it last? Who knows. I took three fly-ins to Hebert. I can't do another right now. Octanehi5 is the man for information on Hebert. We had great get-together's with his group when we were there. Ron shared information freely and I may have given a little back. I and my group have had great trips to some other lakes in Quebec but Hebert is unique. Definitely a bucket list trip. What more can I say than another great season is upon us. Just a few weeks to the opener. No ice where we start. Good luck. Ron"
6150577,Lktrician,2018-04-22 18:43:00,32,Appreciate. Your taking the time to reply Thanks
6150601,fishron,2018-04-22 18:54:00,317,"Lk, Give it time. You will get feedback on Hebert. Most of the site are NW Ontario walleye fisherman. There are several members that are familiar with Hebert. They will chime in in due time. Don't worry about offending me. I don't offend easily and on a walleye board if things bother you, you might as well take up catfishing. There I've done it......I've offended Catfishermen."

6153321,retire55,2018-04-23 18:16:00,1029,I did a nine day fly in into Lac Hebert 20-29 Jun 2014. Both the fishing and the accommodations were outstanding. I consider Air Tamarack a first rate outfitter.
6153329,kzoofisher,2018-04-23 18:18:00,5144,"It's a good lake and lots of guys report catching around 50 fish per day per rod. That's pretty good fishing right there. There are posters* here who know the lake well and I believe you can get a map of it from Navionics now, so you should be able to locate some good spots with a few tips. Take plenty of worms, sounds like bait is a plus for numbers. *fishron, walleyeandre, octanehi5"
6154065,MikeG1,2018-04-24 05:49:00,433,The 6 guys in my group in July 2016 caught over 2000 eyes during a sun / sun period. It was great action. Fish the side of the lake the wind blows INTO. We'll be back this July.
6156001,potsie225,2018-04-25 06:07:00,41,"10 guys from Rochester, NY went to Hebert last year first week in July. Everything that has been said here is 100% correct. With some excellent advise from these guys we caught 1702 eyes and a few northerns. Air Tamarac is a 5 star outfit, You will not be disappointed. This year we are going June 22 for a week. Doug"
