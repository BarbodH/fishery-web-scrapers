6164457,Red Pine J,2018-04-30 07:47:00,44,"No problems at all. That said, I've not been to Dryden in some 10 yrears, so, things could well have changed."
6165281,JAY221,2018-04-30 16:15:00,877,"Clean and a little dated, think 1980's. We have never had an issue there and we have stayed there 4-5 times. Later, Jay"

6165561,Guest,2018-04-30 18:26:00,0,Stayed at Northside a couple of times motel is fine supper options a little scarce
6166609,maddogg,2018-05-01 08:24:00,178,We've stayed at the Riverview Lodge in Dryden a few times nice place with a restaurant.
6166689,Mojo-NC,2018-05-01 08:51:00,1929,That's part of our plan too - we love the restaurant at the Riverview Lodge so that's our Friday evening dinner before heading up to Ear Falls first thing Saturday morning. We stay at the Holiday Inn Express - it makes us smarter and better fishermen.
