The far south end of Eagle is a walleye spawning mecca....just not sure they spend the entire season in 15 feet of water. Sounds like a good musky bite though. Bonus on the cellphone reception.
6144121,kcguy68,2018-04-19 11:08:00,51,"For what it's worth. We go up every year to South Shore Lodge, towards the end of July. My brother and I visited with the lodge owner about a possible trip in early September, and he indicated that if you are going after walleye, it starts getting tough in the Fall. They scatter, and become difficult to locate."
6145625,prov1800,2018-04-20 06:14:00,5010,Are you sure you heard him right.if anything the fishing is absolutely fantastic in september.
6146153,Ricky Spanish,2018-04-20 08:46:00,1298,"I had a tougher time in Sep than on our previous mid June, early July, trips. I chalked it up to the weather being unstable. It was in the 70's when we arrived then a cold front and rain came in the night after day 2. By day 5 it as in the mid 40's. We still caught 20x as many as we would have at our home lakes."
6146353,prov1800,2018-04-20 09:36:00,5010,That's a bonus.i guided a lot for North shore lodge so basically fished same area as you did.lots of places to fish if one is not producing.but seemed to me all of them where firing on all cylinders.sometimes the main lake stuff gets slower they are there nust need to present bait diff.i fish mostly south from north shore going toward oz.sometimes nivens.long run but worth it.
6146393,Ricky Spanish,2018-04-20 09:53:00,1298,"I'm still not confident enough to head to Osbourne and will surely wreck my boat if I tried to make it to Nivens. I really only go as far west as West 3 Sisters in Nash's and south to Lost and Meridian Bays. My father in law and brother in law fish with Miah the same week we are there and they head down to Nivens every day. I know I could follow them, but I don't feel right about it. My father in law caught eight muskies in five days last year so it is awfully tempting."
6146481,prov1800,2018-04-20 10:32:00,5010,"It's very good.awrsome run once your in the river section.dont think miah would mind.but there's lots of good fishing that way.stanton bay,froghead.tje east end is very good."
6146529,Ricky Spanish,2018-04-20 10:48:00,1298,"We used to run down that way with Brad J. before he went to the west end. I think we fished with him for 7-8yrs before I remembered enough to take a camp boat as far as Meridian after dinner. Got kind of boring trolling around V with everyone else. I also didn't like seeing that kind of pressure put on one spot. We would have switched camps just to keep fishing with him if he would have gone just about anywhere else. After he left, I bought a bigger boat and have been ""guiding us"" ever since. I wish I lived there."
6146673,prov1800,2018-04-20 11:31:00,5010,Yes I know we're brad went.hope everything works out and you get to come back soon.
6147625,NARDA 1,2018-04-20 18:34:00,636,+1 We have been going the second week of September for years and have never had any problems finding Walleye.
6093089,Bergy,2018-03-28 17:36:00,83,Any thoughts on Eagle Lake near Vermillion Falls Ontario? Mainly want information on Walleye fishing. Average size? What to expect for numbers per day per boat. Is there a map chip for the lake? Thinking of going in later June or early July. Anyone stayed at Stanleyâ€™s or Cedar Point Camps?
6093673,pjshorthorn,2018-03-29 06:13:00,5654,"Are you asking about Vermilion Bay, ON ? PjShorthorn"
6093929,The tank,2018-03-29 07:35:00,340,"we fished the west side of eagle before. (the area your looking at) we did alright considering it was the first week of august and it snowed on monday and 80 degrees on Wednesday. most of the walleye we caught were 17-19"" not a fan of the clear water in that area. we did most of our fishing on the walk to lakes. just my opinion but if I would go back to eagle I would stay more toward the east and or south east side."
6094121,Bergy,2018-03-29 08:14:00,83,Yes. Vermillion Falls. You can tell I am new to exploring Ontario. I am open to other good lakes/camps within 3 hours of the Minnesota/Canada border
6094345,Remi,2018-03-29 09:50:00,41,"Last year was our first time on Eagle Lake, we stayed at Cedar Point Lodge, it was the 1st week of August. We caught about 500 walleyes, 3 guys, and took camp guide 2 days-that really helped. Disclaimer, my memory and counts could be off, but we did fish 10 hours per day and enjoyed the 7-day trip. Most walleyes in the smaller size, some in the slot, 2 biggest were 24-inch. For that time of year, seemed like most boats (including us) went for longer boat rides (about 30-40 minutes or so) towards the bigger section of Eagle Lake to jig the reefs.I did a video of 15 minutes raw video footage from that trip:https://youtu.be/UZTeP_PuWjYAh fishing..."
6094553,griff,2018-03-29 10:56:00,40,Lots of big ol' walleye to filet! Yum!
6096489,Bakefish,2018-03-30 07:40:00,1077,Lol
6104154,ljcs789,2018-04-02 08:21:00,42,"We fished at Stanley's last year early July and it was tough. Stanley's is an excellent resort and accomodations are first class. Owners are awesome. Dock help gasses your boat, they clean your fish and freeze them if you want and free bait with bookings. Prices are really reasonable too. We had a guide for a day and he put us on some fish, but the next day we went back to the spots he showed us and had little to no luck. He said fish were not yet on their summer spots and were scattered so it was tough. That end of the lake is clear water, so also makes it a little tough. There are portage lakes with nice boats you can use. We went into one and had no luck. I would advise getting a guide if you can."
6111650,wooglin,2018-04-05 09:17:00,371,"Fished Eagle last fall (early Sept) for the first time. We targeted walleye and musky. Boated 7 musky in a week, and 66 walleye. Yes, 66. 5 pike and 2 smallies. We stayed at Century Lodge. Average walleye size was probably 12"" and all the rockbass you can catch. If you like cellphone reception, Eagle is for you. If you want to get away, hit up Lac Seul or go further north.If I go back to Eagle, it'll be a 'musky only' trip."
