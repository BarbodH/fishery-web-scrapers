6173073,Johnny Rock,2018-05-04 13:02:00,8,RABC at $23.00 a year is kind of steep. Thatâ€™s $230.00 for 10 years vs. $145.00 for a passport.Charge $75.00 and call it good for 10 years.
6174481,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2018-05-05 08:01:00,629,"Since the majority of my time on LOTW water is in Canadian water, I wanted to know specifically if one could take a guest into Canadian water & fish without an RABC. My answer from a Custom Officer @ the Rainy River, Ont. Customs office was this: ""No"" was his interpretation. Because the law states there is to be no angering or other stipulations as mentioned in the earlier posts. Thus, when ""Jig-Fishing"" it would be in violation. For my money, I have & will continue to carry an RABC in order to have Canadian fishing privileges of any style or Resort visitation. Hope this helps those in ?. Set the Hook, CRJohn"
6174585,Johnny Rock,2018-05-05 09:24:00,8,"The Customs Officer response seems very odd to me. If your guest is in your boat, has an Ontario Outdoors Card and valid Ontario fishing license, and you don't touch Canadian land or another boat, then that seems to me to be exactly why this law was enacted. It's textbook. What am I missing? Also, this talk about GPS anchoring with your trolling motor being a violation is bs to me. Your anchor is not touching the ground and your boat is still moving to stay in one spot. No way you would get a ticket for that or for touching an enforcement boat when they might board to check your compliance. It's just not practical."
6174609,camp chef,2018-05-05 09:27:00,915,You still need a passport to get an RABC. The RABC is cheap to be able to Cross into Canada by water.
6174617,G I Mike,2018-05-05 09:37:00,89,"Camp Chef, not to split hairs but you do NOT need a passport to get a RABC. A DL and Birth Certificate will get you one."
6174721,camp chef,2018-05-05 10:52:00,915,I stand corrected
6174961,patrick,2018-05-05 14:29:00,277,Last year I paid $30 for the remote border crossing pass for my wife and I have $30 was the family rate for $30 I can come and go across the border into Canada as I please I think that's pretty reasonable and it's good for the whole year I know I'm gonna buy one immediately not gonna take any chances thanks Rick
6001609,G I Mike,2018-02-13 15:19:00,89,"In June 2017 Canadian Parliament passed Bill S-233 meaning that American boaters and anglers will no longer be required to report to Canadian Customs as long as they do not leave their vessel, land, anchor, moor, or make contact with another conveyance in Canadian waters. Link to the Bill:http://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en...3/royal-assent Link to Michigan News Article:http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/new_can...sg17_bohling17 I haven't been able to find any info in the MN Papers/News. I have been using a Remote Area Border Crossing (RABC) Permit to fish Rainy Lake for many years and it always made it difficult to bring people along at the last minute, etc. The way I read it that will no longer be a concern if we are staying in the US and simply angling on the Canadian side of the line. Just will need a Ontario Fishing License. Anyone living/working on the border have any clarification or insight? Are the local CBSA offices providing any guidance on the changes? Im not finding much online yet and summer is coming! Thanks"
6001809,That Minnesota guy,2018-02-13 16:01:00,8293,"Just remember, a Talon or Powerpole is considered anchoring in which case the permit would still be required as I understand it. I fish up there often so for the few extra bucks I will continue buying everything."
6148697,Guest,2018-04-21 09:53:00,0,does that law apply to low also?????
6149209,zogman,2018-04-21 18:55:00,77,yes
6149217,The tank,2018-04-21 18:55:00,340,yes it does.
6150009,srj,2018-04-22 10:23:00,971,"I suggest contacting Customs/Immigration on both sides of the border. The border crossing process by boat has been confusing for a long time. IF indeed you can enter Canada in your boat because of a new Canadian law, that law does not apply to entering the U.S. I-68 maybe? It would sure be nice if a customs guy entered this thread."
6150105,kzoofisher,2018-04-22 11:46:00,5144,"Thousands of boats have been crisscrossing between Detroit and Windsor the last few weeks, haven't heard of any problems for anyone who obeyed the law. Plenty of ICE vehicles parked on the American side keeping an eye on things, probably the same on the Queen's side."
6155097,G I Mike,2018-04-24 14:13:00,89,"All, Just an update...After starting this post I reached out to a friend who is a resort owner/outfitter on the MN/ON border (Rainy Lake). Below is what he sent me for a reply after he spoke with Canadian Customs. Nothing definitive, but some additional opinion. This is unedited. <<Quoted Message>>I visited Canadian Customs yesterday and talked to them about RABC's. You can cross in water without one as long as you don't anchor, touch land, or touch/hover with another boat. If you have a DWI then you still cannot go over and all usual Canadian laws apply as far as licensing and bait and whatnot. However if a warden comes to check you in Canadian waters then you are touching another boat and then you need the RABC. Seems to me like a gamble to go over without one if your fishing with a group and the customs officer agreed that it pretty much was. Also US border laws still apply so an I68 would be needed to touch land in Canada or another boat and you are supposed to have either a passport, enhanced drivers license or NEXUS card for water crossing without RABC. Basically I think this new Canadian law didn't do much for anyone and there is a lot of false information floating around out there. Hope that helps. <<End of Quoted Message>> On a separate note, I think it will be interesting to see how this is interpreted and/or enforced in different places such as the metropolitan Detroit/Windsor area with high boat traffic vs. the remote areas of northern MN where we have traditionally had the RABC requirements (only apply from Lake Superior to LOW)."
6155105,G I Mike,2018-04-24 14:15:00,89,I agree completely MN Guy. Just got my RABC back in the mail for the 2018 season. Definitely not worth the hassle this year for sure until it all gets sorted out.
6155281,Esoxchaser,2018-04-24 15:16:00,1576,Reservation police pulling alongside to check your tribal fishing license counts as making contact with another vessel too.
