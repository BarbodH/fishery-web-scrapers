6157401,Pooch,2018-04-25 19:40:00,4618,I'm not so sure that braid ever wears out? I've got two reels going on four years now and I just don't see it breaking down at all so far.Anyone else have some spooled for many years AND actually using it regularly?Pooch

6157913,SkWalter,2018-04-26 06:33:00,515,"I was fishing for peacock bass in Miami a couple months ago and the guide was using what looked to be yellow Power Pro. I asked him what line it was and he said Bull Buster. Claimed it was cheaper than PowerPro or Suffix 832 and worked just as well for him. The braid did seem a bit coarser than what I was used too, but I'm not sure the lb rating so it could have been higher than I use.https://bullbuster.net/braidedfishinglineLooks like 500 yards of 20 lb is $32."
6158681,wmd,2018-04-26 11:01:00,388,I have reels with Fireline Crystal that I have used for 6 years and have seen no break down at all. Slowly changing to Sufix 832 Ghost tried it on a new reel a couple of years ago and like it better than Fireline. wmd
6145425,123chadder,2018-04-20 01:44:00,429,i was reading a thread on braids and it made me wonder if any cheaper brands exist that are as good as the premium braids if anyone uses a cheaper brand with success please name the brand...id love to hear about it
6145585,prov1800,2018-04-20 06:04:00,5010,The only thing cheap I would put on any of my reels is backing.braid is not that expensive and lasts a long time.last year in the spring on a trip I stopped in a big sporting good store and found some braid I had not seen in Canada so I bought a bunch.its j braid and I used it on a couple of my reels and am pretty impressed with it.i also use venom braid on my muskie reel and got to put that stuff through a number of tests.that stuff was half price of most other lines.not sure if the venom braid comes in walleye type poundage.
6145633,last chance,2018-04-20 06:16:00,3262,i couldn't tell you the name but i used cheap braid on my saltwater reels in fl and was very impressed with it. i have also used china's power pro and am very happy with it.
6145833,123chadder,2018-04-20 07:07:00,429,what is the name of the chinese powerpro?
6146249,last chance,2018-04-20 09:08:00,3262,i bought mine off ebay. it was listed as power pro and the label said power pro but was from china. i got 1500 yrds for about 45.00 less than usa power pro. but i just looked for the same line and didn't find anything listed on ebay. so i don't think there selling it on ebay any more.

I use regular Power Pro on all my rods, using cheap line is a bit like using a cheap bullet on moose fired from a $5,000 custom rifle. Good braided line will last a long time, particularly if you use a flouro leader, when you get snagged it's virtually always the leader that snaps. 150 yard package is $22.99 cdn, with a bit of backing on the reel that will fill virtually any walleye reel and will last for at least a couple of seasons."
6151513,prov1900,2018-04-23 06:35:00,544,"Sufix Performance Braid, at Scheels, is around $7-$8 bucks a spool, 150 yds. Great line for spinning reels, it is very supple and seems to hold up well. Way more supple then any other braid off the spool. Perfect line for pitching jigs."
6151601,Darrenf442,2018-04-23 07:17:00,1369,I read an article from a retired pro fishermen. He said over his career he was paid to use different braids to test them. He said there was really no difference and now he chooses braid by what on sale.
