I was through there yesterday, and, at this point, it looks to be staging of trucks in the northbound area that was the truck scale across from the Gander store, and the beginnings of lane re-routes in the southbound lane, but i believe this is going to be a summer of fun. The only alternatives would be 61 through Hugo to Forest Lake and back on the freeway at Forest Lake, or highway 65. or 35 W to Lexington Ave, north to Broadway, and East to 35 at Forest Lake and back on the freeway. Plan your routes and travel times accordingly..."
