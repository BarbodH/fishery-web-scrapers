6174577,kona77,2018-05-05 09:22:00,236,Our group has always used bottom bouncers and crawler rigs with good success over the years. In many cases it is our go-to set-up for finding active fish.I know others have posted about using floating raps with their b/b's..Just wondering what kind of leader material and length most guys use with this set-up?? I was thinking about using Power-Pro or some type of braid versus the normal mono we use on crawler rigs. (do not want to lose too many raps to gators).. Thanks in advance for any feedback..
6175065,Aspencreek,2018-05-05 16:52:00,2911,Wingspan or a little better for leader length (approx 6'). and I have used 20# power pro for leader with almost no difference in success. I have been using the floating tail dancer or flicker shad with good success.
6175121,BornToFish,2018-05-05 17:24:00,1224,"Greetings,Many thanks to the original poster of this thread! I was thinking about the same question the last week or two as I prepare for the upcoming season.I was also wondering about the length of the leader from the bottom bouncer to the floating crank bait. I wondered if the ability of the lure to dive (when at speed) offsets the tendency of the lure to float. If not, I was thinking that a fairly long leader might let the lure rise out of the walleye's strike zone.I have another question. What sizes of floating crank bait works well? I was thinking along the lines of a #7 or #9 Rapala floating crank bait. Any suggestions?Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6175345,Pooch,2018-05-05 18:58:00,4618,"Been doing it for many years. Takes heavy bouncer, as in 2 to 3 ounces. I pull floating original Rapalas a lot. Don't get as many fish as a spinner, but they tend to be larger.I use plastic coated braided wire with crimps for leader. Kind of a pain but it prevents bite offs. If I were using anything else maybe a heavy mono or braid leader.It's just another tool option when looking for fish.Get rid of the front treble hook as fish are nearly always caught on the back treble, which I even sometimes cut off the bottom hook of the treble. Front treble will be nothing but grief for snags.Pooch"
6175545,Aspencreek,2018-05-05 21:46:00,2911,"Yes, forgot to say that earlier, lose the front treble, they also tend to run truer also."
6176105,kona77,2018-05-06 10:07:00,236,Thanks for the feedback and suggestion on removing the front treble
6176401,LoDo,2018-05-06 13:45:00,721,"Excellent recommendation with removing the front treble hook. My dad rolled with this setup all last year, early June, Lac Seul at Big / Little Sand. Id guess he caught the most and largest with this setup. He covered so much more water with this setup than the folks jigging. Great post!!"
6176569,Mojo-NC,2018-05-06 15:24:00,1929,"Excellent post! There are a few areas in my lake that have deep rocks and I've always wanted to have better depth control when using crankbaits over these areas. This method would definitely be just the ticket. However, it also got me thinking, how would this method provide an advantage over using a standard 3-way swivel set-up? Potentially less snags with the bottom bouncer?"
6177113,Aspencreek,2018-05-06 20:46:00,2911,"Yes......But when in a rocky shoreline or rock pile where the bottom bouncer can get caught between rocks, I will switch to the 3way. But the dropper has a football sinker pinned with a split shot. That way if the dropper line gets hung up a good tug allows the split shot to pull off and all I lose is the football sinker and split shot. The rest of the rig floats to the surface."
6177153,LoDo,2018-05-06 21:10:00,721,"One more thing, this is a great way to fish walleyes in late summer and Fall when fisher are deeper. Obviously the later in the year, deeper the big walleyes, heavier the weight."
