6143305,pjshorthorn,2018-04-19 04:54:00,5654,I tend not to make it a habit to call up a convicted criminal to get their side of the story. The guy pleaded guilty in a court of law. Why would there be a need to speak to him for any reason regarding the matter? I guess I'm just wired differently. PjShorthorn
6147737,pan-man,2018-04-20 19:15:00,299,I think that last part in red is an understatement!

6148017,castnblast,2018-04-20 23:44:00,111,Seriously hope this guy never chooses to visit our country again. He is not welcome. Hope he sees this and sleeps on it...
6148057,northshoremb,2018-04-21 03:19:00,492,Should be a higher fine once you are 2 or more over your limit. Make it like $1000 a fish so that SOB should have to pay for years of lost fish that those 87 walleye could have madeSent from my LG-H873 using Tapatalk
6148065,northshoremb,2018-04-21 03:26:00,492,I believe if you are building a secret compartment in a freezee and taking 87 extra walleye you deserve to lose your vehicle and anything else that was in your possesion at time of the crime. Hes not just at a camp or living in the bush and trying to feed his family with a fish or 2 a day. How many other times have you thought that he might have done that and how much money has he pocketed from selling the fish most likely? Its our resources and our money buying licences that help ensure there are fish to catch years from now. You need to show that its a serious crime because if a guy can keep doing that and make thousands and thousands a month he doesnt care if he finally gets caught and pays peanuts compared to what he made.Also from your response i would love to see your freezer or livewell after every day you fish. You sound like you belive its ok to keep extra fish and that would make you part of the problemSent from my LG-H873 using Tapatalk
6148233,That Minnesota guy,2018-04-21 06:19:00,8293,"We don't know for a fact that he did it more then once. Maybe he got caught on his freezers maiden voyage. I would think that Canada would have pulled his ability to enter the country along with the fines. He was caught, he was fined, he has suffered embarrassment (hopefully) in his hometown. Short of wrapping all his vehicles in a giant ""POACHER"" wrap I think he is done for now."
6126210,38bill,2018-04-11 14:40:00,331,This was a planned heist and he has probably been doing this kind of thing for years. I'd show him no mercy.

If you are so willing to rip him a new one all over the internet, why haven't you gone to him directly?"
6136025,That Minnesota guy,2018-04-16 06:12:00,8293,I have not. I'm sure he is busy discussing what happened with his wife and friends. I don't owe him a call nor does he owe me an apology. I'm happy he is getting what he deserves.
6143257,Huntindave,2018-04-19 04:01:00,2194,I'd like to call him. Please share his phone number.

6109122,Obabikon,2018-04-04 07:55:00,2370,"Don't forget this was a major infraction... not the average ""kept 1-2 fish too many"" Drunk driving - the average cost of a DUI is $10,000... which is pretty much exactly what this guy owes. That's the average. Major infractions can result in prison time. Drug possession depends on the drug, and the amount... but you certainly would end up doing prison time for major drug infractions. Spousal abuse - major infractions result in prison time Child abuse - certainly can result in prison time Auto theft - has a minimum of 18 months in prison for GTA. Tax evasion - imprisonment of up to 5 years Insurance fraud - up to 5 years in jail in extreme cases I'm certainly not saying that any of the above is acceptable... but they certainly aren't punished at a lesser degree than this man was."

I think there should be an enhanced punishment for attempting to conceal over the limit fish.Too bad they didn't catch him at the border and charge him also with some federal charges and not just Ontario charges.Kudos to the local newspaper and those who made it aware.
6110106,Fisherman1792,2018-04-04 14:22:00,927,The guy is probably in his late 70's early 80's so I'm pretty sure he has been doing this kind of stuff for a long time. Kudos to the local newspaper I really hope they print something. Fisherman 1792
6111754,MrSimon,2018-04-05 10:26:00,922,I get it that everyone here is passionate about fishing and conservation ... I am too ... but trying to publicly shame a complete stranger because of an article you read on the internet?? That's pretty severe.
6111818,That Minnesota guy,2018-04-05 10:49:00,8293,"It was a link of a story on a radio station page. So it wasn't something that was heard by my neighbors cousins brothers maid. You are correct, public shaming might not be enough in addition to the fine. But it's about all we can do at this point. Or I guess we can just turn our backs and ignore the slob. If public shaming keeps just one other pig from poaching our resources don't you think it's well worth it?"
6111906,v-bay gord,2018-04-05 11:26:00,3168,The information is put online by the MNR on their website.......I would assume for that exact purpose. It could be looked at as a means to dissuade others from doing similar illegal actions.
6112410,Fisherman1792,2018-04-05 15:05:00,927,If you would have read the thread in the general discussion forum that I posted I have met the POS. He even had the nerve to accuse Zanderman and I for fishing in his spot. We first met him at the fish cleaning station so to me he is not a total stranger. I sure hope he didn't go to your local lakes and did the same. He sure got off pretty easy I wish he would have lost all his stuff it's not like he had only an extra limit or two. And BTW did I mention that his daughter came up to visit them as well. Wonder how much she went home with? Fisherman 1792
6112770,kzoofisher,2018-04-05 17:52:00,5144,I just posted this story on the Saginaw Bay forum of Michigan Sportsman. If they guy hasn't been publicly shamed yet he's about to be. And I would do the same thing if he was a child abuser or super drunk driver.

6108946,MrSimon,2018-04-04 07:06:00,922,"Jail time ... public shaming ... lifetime ban from fishing ... letters to newspapers ... truck and boat confiscations ... etc etc Wow people, that's a lot of rocks to throw. I sure hope you aren't living in glass houses. I'm not defending the guys actions at all. But I feel a 10 year ban and a $13,000 fine is pretty dang severe, but appropriate. Here is a list of things that get LESS of a punishment. Drunk driving Drug possesion Spouse abuse Child abuse Auto theft Tax evasion Insurance fraud How come you guys don't get all bent out of shape when these things happen? And they happen all the time ... and likely some of you have done them."

6109082,tv4fish,2018-04-04 07:48:00,2694,"FWIW: MrSimon - I agree with Huntindave -- This IS a fishing site and is the appropriate place to get irate about this sort of abuse of fishing ""rights"".That said - I also sure agree with you on the other items that are not being ""appropriately punished"". Maybe if more people let our politicians know how we feel about those issues - SOMETHING might get done about them. Seems like I was taught that the punishment is supposed to fit the crime and that the punishment is also supposed to be a deterrent to these crimes - in many cases that is not now true.I think the more that we react to these abuses, the better chance we have to put an end to them.Yeah, maybe I have my face buried in the ""Dream Whip"" - but things need to change in a lot of the crime/punishment areas."
6106626,last chance,2018-04-03 05:32:00,3262,chain his gonads to the floor set the building on fire then hand him a dull knife. all jokes aside they should have took everything plus the fine plus jail time. what he did wasn't just a mistake but a flagrant violation of the law. we was caught with 2 fish over in ohio between 6 of us. the dnr said it wasn't a bad infraction of the law but it was a infraction. we had put all our fish together so we didn't know who was over the limit so we split the 58.00 fine between the 6 of us.
6106714,prov1900,2018-04-03 06:49:00,544,"What chaps me the most is that this dude is an American. When I go to Canada, I follow the rules to the letter of the law because it is one heck of a privilege to be able to go with such ease. Any more, I rarely even take fish home because I appreciate the resource that much. I follow the Ontario Conservation Officer page on Facebook and they report poaching violations several times a week. 99.999% are resident violators. But then there is this guy, one guy, who makes the paper and probably makes the rest of us look bad. I hope not but like they say, it only takes one bad apple... This dude did not receive near enough punishment."
6106762,That Minnesota guy,2018-04-03 07:07:00,8293,"Would LOVE to hear the guys local newspaper got their hands on the story! ""Local resident convicted of poaching"" with his name and photo. Really, there isn't enough shame that can he heaped upon this guy."
6106866,Huntindave,2018-04-03 07:41:00,2194,"This won't stop him. Public shaming in his home town MIGHT be the best punishment, AFTER some stiff fines and loss of boat and equipment."
6106874,LOW1,2018-04-03 07:42:00,2828,"The false compartment means that this was not an unintentional mistake or misunderstanding as to what the law is. It was a premeditated and well planned violation. Also, it seems likely that a person who builds a false compartment does not do so for a one-time use and that this conduct likely had been done in the past and would be done in the future if he had not been caught.I wonder what happens if he does not pay the fine? Could he just leave Canada and never return and avoid the fine that way?I agree with the poster who suggests jail time. 20 or 30 days would seem right to me. And a substantial civil penalty for the fish. Keep the vehicle, boat, and his passport until its paid. To me that false bottom puts this case into an entirely different league than the standard over the limit case."

I told a guy the other day "" you golf so what do you bring back ? "" other than an empty wallet. To each their own, if they like golf that is fine. It's all about a good time. In my 30 plus years of fishing Ontario, I have seen lakes get better , with the size and numbers limits being reduced. I was with 3 guys from church and by mid week they were starting to talk of their limit to take home. Last day , just to make a point when asked how many i had back i said NONE. I said I ate fish while here and had a great time. Listening to the loons and white throated sparrows, listening to the wind blowing thru the pine, smelling the pines and forest . Seeing a moose or bear was enough for me. When I go with my wife go, we do bring some fish back for my 98 year old Mom. I will not go looking over my shoulder for the MAN. We buy full limit license just to make sure we are always legal. On our next trip , which is bear hunt we are using our canoe , and just catch enough to eat. I may be wrong but if a person gets busted in Ohio , then they cannot buy a license in Michigan."
6107506,kzoofisher,2018-04-03 14:06:00,5144,47 States have that. Should be all of them. And they should at least make their data base available with foreign countries even if loss of privileges isn’t mandatory. I’d like to see extreme poachers turned around at the border.

Some guys money just doesn't matter. Also how many other times did he get out of country after raping the resource? 87 fish over the limit isn't just counting or measuring wrong. It's a blatant attempt to poach the resources of the country. If he is willing to take that risk in Canada just what do you think he did around home? I would have no problem with the Canadians grabbing his vehicle, boat, gear and throwing him in jail for 6 months. Harsh? Not in my opinion. Harsh to me for what he did would be lining him up against a wall and shooting him. That would be harsh. Otherwise I'm OK."
