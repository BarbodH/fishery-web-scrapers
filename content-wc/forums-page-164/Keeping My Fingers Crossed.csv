6151945,gullrockguy,2018-04-23 09:06:00,44,"the snow has taken a beating here this week and the lakes are starting to be covered with water so if you are lucky, and the weather stays warm you could be fishing, BUT i just checked the weather for here and on May 2 and 3 there is a forecast of snow. time will tell , hope it works out for you"
6151961,Golden Eagle,2018-04-23 09:12:00,2642,"May 16, I'll be looking for lawn chair tracks and used cigars atthe Bug River bridge. Bug River will be a dangerous spotfor pike as they head toward bigger water.Might even make a house call if the sun is still turned on."
6152073,Obabikon,2018-04-23 09:39:00,2370,"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday look like ice melting days in the Morson area...https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/CAXX1857:1:CA 60's and rain!!!! Hopefully that spreads all over NW Ontario."

6156689,prov1900,2018-04-25 12:45:00,544,I'm feeling pretty darn good...now about my May 24 trip. Whew!
6158201,bones82,2018-04-26 08:02:00,121,I'm feeling good about the opener.
6158521,prov1900,2018-04-26 10:02:00,544,"Yep. Looking at the 10 day in Sioux Lookout, I think you are going to be just fine for opener. Warm temps plus rain = open water."
6158545,bones82,2018-04-26 10:08:00,121,Hopefully it comes off the day before. We are heading up to the English River just NE of Kenora. Ice is usually off a day or two before LOW.
6158569,prov1900,2018-04-26 10:17:00,544,"We are at Minnitaki on the 24th. Have been up there on opener where the ice came off the day before...actually the night before, so we really cut it close. I like it though, because it makes fishing locations pretty predictable. Good luck on your trip!"
