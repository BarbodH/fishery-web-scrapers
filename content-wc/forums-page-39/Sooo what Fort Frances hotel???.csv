It's a Ma and Pa operation - not fancy, but always clean and quiet. Pet-friendly too, as I recall, and very reasonably priced. Ideal if you're heading toward 71, less so if heading for 502."

Rooms were always clean but was always a chance that someone smoked in the room previously. But has been several years since we stayed there.Super-8 and Copper River Inn would be my next choice. Have done the Super-8 for last 8 years or so and they recently added on so have some brand new rooms. Copper River Inn changed hands in recent years and appears they have done renovations, maybe someone has stayed recently and has insight. We are thinking of staying there for our August trip. Price is a wash between the two. Think it was $160 Canadian last I looked. Influencing my decision to these two is I take kids so they get some time in the pool.La Place Rendezvous is the other hotel. Again clean, has a restaurant but price is a little higher for about the same thing. Think it was $190 when stayed there a couple weeks ago.I think there are several others on the budget friendly side that people have said are clean."
6667018,SweetD,2022-06-23 13:54:00,243,Bayview Motel is a nice little place and right on highway 11 and sits right next to Rainy River. There is still a restaurant that sits next door that is pretty good too!

6667026,NARDA 1,2022-06-23 14:17:00,636,The Copper River Inn or LaPlace Rendezvous are good choices. Both have restaurants and bars. Copper River at the West end of town if you are going North on 71. LaPlace Rendezvous is on the East end of town if you are going up the 502.
6667136,Invader21,2022-06-23 19:36:00,105,"Always stay at the Copper River Inn. It is pretty nice especially since the renovation/change from the Adventure Inn (it's old identity). We were there this year opening week, and while the hotel was in good shape, the restaurant and bar were closed, and there were few people staying there. It was sort of stunning (but I've never gone opening week before - so could be due to that). The Super 8 on the other hand was very busy-looking.But, when I go back, I'll most likely stay at the Copper River Inn again.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
6667206,Walleye2242,2022-06-24 06:45:00,263,there were only 2 places that had rooms so I went with the Bayview. Thank you all.
