6665600,SterlingArcher,2022-06-18 08:20:00,92,Walleye: 1/4oz glow white jig and a minnow. For artificial baits I'd say a white jerkbait if they're shallow and a dropshot if they're deep.Pike: blue and silver Doctor spoon.Lake trout: 1oz glow white tube jig tipped with a sucker minnow

6665678,PBsQuest,2022-06-18 20:29:00,49,"I use a Mepps Walleye Killer, white with pink blade for walleye. Have had good success with neon swim baits. Bass jig with a 3 shiner pattern or white power grub. I've caught bass in just about everything in my box. I used a few lures I had left over from my Grandpa that he had from the 50's. Caught a fish and retired them. Never fished for lake trout. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
