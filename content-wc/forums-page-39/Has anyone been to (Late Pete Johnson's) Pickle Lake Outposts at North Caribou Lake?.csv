I don't recall the drive from Thunder Bay to Pickle Lake being bad at all. Departing from Mawley is interesting. Think I'd still rather leave from Pickle Lake or Armstrong.
6667058,SweetD,2022-06-23 15:44:00,243,What are you thinking????!!!! Never agree to flyout of a lake called “Graveyard”!!!!!
6667084,phishfearme,2022-06-23 17:15:00,1242,not if there's fog or forest fire smoke between Pickle/Armstrong and Mawley. a few years ago the only option for us was to fly into Mawley as the smoke from all the forest fires essentially blotted out Pickle Lake. Mawley is at least a viable option in that situation. PLO has an LUP on Mawley - dock and small cabin - that enables them to use it as a base of operation. phish
6667088,adempsey2.0,2022-06-23 17:22:00,611,It wasn't by choice!
6667096,adempsey2.0,2022-06-23 17:24:00,611,"I think it's good to know that this alternative exists. The driving distance is the reason I would prefer the other locations. If I had to drive to somewhere like Mawley to get into the camp, I would not hesitate at all!"
6667192,Freytown,2022-06-24 05:50:00,770,Thxs. I just travel on 160 miles (320 in/out) in Quebec...that was enough for this year. FT
6667324,phishfearme,2022-06-24 12:03:00,1242,see you Sunday morning!! phish
6667362,Da' Walleye Assassun,2022-06-24 13:43:00,358,Fishermen are dying to get into Graveyard.
6665960,Larry S,2022-06-20 09:14:00,665,"Would like to talk with Anyone who has been in the Past 2 weeks to North Caribou Lake with (Former, Deceasd Owner Pete Johnson) Pickle Lake Outposts? This is Urgent for my group as we are scheduled for a trip there next week and Need Information Larry Schroeder"
6666086,Eckohlt,2022-06-20 17:24:00,3685,Can you contact the new owner if it's urgent?
6666098,SweetD,2022-06-20 18:59:00,243,"It’s probably too obvious to call your outfitter. Assiuming you have been trying??? Maybe call local chamber of commerce, local baitshop etc maybe????Good Luck"
6666196,Larry S,2022-06-21 07:05:00,665,Have taken care of the problem. Just wanted to talk to the past people who fished there this year to see how the camp is!
6666242,RichA$1970,2022-06-21 10:14:00,1159,Always heard that is a great lake with big pike. Kudos to you driving all the way to the end of civilization in Pickle Lake
6666248,Walleye2242,2022-06-21 10:26:00,263,How is the fishing in the pickle lake area? When i was really young we went to Pashkokogan(?) lake and i think it might be in that area???? the fishing was really good from what i remember as a 12 year old? haha
6666686,lenray,2022-06-22 15:47:00,467,Pickle Lake the village is just the beginning of my adventures up there. Up the gravel road many miles-up a big river many miles--portage over to a walleye factory----PORK AND BEANER HERE----Never ever see another fisherman or fisher woman....Just the way I like it...PORK AND BEANER......
6666716,phishfearme,2022-06-22 17:19:00,1242,"Lenray - glad you're still hanging out on this board. For our trip to N Caribou last year we took a van up the Windigo Lake Road to Mawley lake where we flew out to N Caribou. the per mile trip cost via a van is MUCH less than the per mile cost for an otter. took more than a half hour out of the flying time. anyway - the road was like an interstate highway - smooth and some dust but not bad - and the outfitter is considering building an outpost cabin on Mawley and we want to be first there - no ""pork and beans"" for us except with a grilled pork tenderloin!! stay heathy and active! phish"
6666812,Freytown,2022-06-23 06:10:00,770,"phish, will we be on gravel roads this year? I hate dust but can prepare to handle. FT"
6666826,phishfearme,2022-06-23 06:30:00,1242,"the road north of Pickle Lake is now paved to about where it crosses the Otoskwin River then gravel past that. we are scheduled to fly out of Pickle Lake - roads are totally paved to here. however, in the past, the outfitter has changed the floatplane departure/arrival plans to leave/arrive at Mawley Lake - they have used a van to get us from Pickle Lake to Mawley so there should be no need for us to drive past Pickle Lake. flying from Mawley to North Caribou Lake - instead of flying from Pickle lake - cuts the flight time more than in half and minimizes potential weather (or smoke!) issues. you can find Mawley Lake on Google Maps at 52°20'12.3""N 90°45'49.4""W and see how much closer it is to N Caribou. phish"
