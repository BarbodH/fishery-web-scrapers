Several fish in the 20""+ range with many caught over 24. There were 3 29"" caught out of our group of 6 and I caught at least one in every integer from 20 on. Still waiting on that elusive 30"". The lake has 4 lodges on it but was very lightly fished by any of them the last 2 years. The rivers opened up last Thursday and the fish (although smaller) were plentiful and aggressive. It was a great trip and this camp is excellent (http://www.expeditions-north.com/)."
6666934,staker1875,2022-06-23 10:55:00,13,Heading to KV Lodge the second week of July so hoping for some early intel. Where did you catch them besides in the rivers? What lures worked best? I'm sure the fish will migrate into the main lake by the time I get there so may be completely different than your experience. Glad you had a great trip!

I struck out on Timberwolf point but that is normal for me. My brother did well there. I did not fish Debbies this year so no information. Rivers were really good but maybe because the guys were still hanging around. Caught a really nice pike in there but did not target Pike at all. I used a 3/8 oz jig (tungsten) almost 80% of the time with various Gulp or twister tails. I did some bottom bouncing with spinner rigs. There were others in camp that trolled cranks exclusively in fairly skinny water and did very well. The bite was not always aggressive but maybe a factor of the time of day that we fished. Full moon last week so they may have been eating early or late. Most bites (except in the river) were more just heaviness on the line. That said, did not lose many of the dozens that were caught. I hope this helps"

Always wanted to check out Kay-Vee Lodge, but Expeditions North was good. When I was there in early July in 2012 (?) the mayfly hatch was on. The whitefish were all over the place at the surface. Walleye fishing was still good though. Sounds like we still fished similar locations as Stehle1. Just not in the river. It's a fairly easy lake to fish. Pretty much anywhere there is 10' to 20' that drop off to 40'+ you will find walleye. There are many areas like this in the main basin not shown on the depth maps."
6666976,staker1875,2022-06-23 12:20:00,13,Thanks for the update Stehle1! Sounds like the usual spots were producing. I've had limited luck backtrolling spinners off the south side of Timberwolf right east of Expeditions. There is a break that goes from 8-25 and they stack up right there pretty close to shore. Adam - A few in my group have been to both KV and Expeditions and we continue to go back to KV. Not a knock on Expeditions but the KV owners Donna and Rob have been top notch to us over the years. Local family vs Expeditions owner is from Grand Rapids I think. I also like that Rob is a pilot and keeps a skywagon at camp should there be an emergency.

Plus, they're located off the main body of lake providing protection and ability to get out when weather turns. Big walleye to be had on Nagagami."
