We learned the first time we went to Canada that we had a lot to learn about fishing up north, so we had a guide the entire stay. Fished walleye mostly and caught hundreds of them, most 21혬-24혬. Fish were found in shallow protected bays that had water in the low 60s vs the low 50s on the main lake. Went after Northerns some, but I didn't get a 40혬, with my best being a 37혬. Still too early for a lot of trout action, but I did catch one nice one. The numbers and average size of walleye in that lake is mind blowing. No trophy walleye but the average size was tremendous. We had to take the detour going up, but 105 was open coming back. Saw a moose between Red Lake and Ear Falls. Faron runs a nice operation and we were happy with accommodations, service, and food. We plan to go a little later next year and get in on more trout action."

Just got back from Headwaters lake with Excellent Adventures and it was one of our best numbers weeks ever. Fish in 6' to 12' and just a steady bite every day. Walked over to Judy Twice and we always catch fish there but Headwaters was just as good with bigger fish."
