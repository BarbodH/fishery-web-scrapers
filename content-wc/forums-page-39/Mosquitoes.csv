6666458,HeHooksHimself,2022-06-22 04:19:00,725,"Bingo! I was wondering if flirting with the fish paid off? With minnows being part of the deal at Wildewood, I guess you can take the time to wine and dine them before taking them home... It was great meeting you there last year. We are booked again this year for the first week in September. See you then? Hooks"
6666482,Bill Krejca,2022-06-22 06:05:00,6107,"Long life, yeah, I have survived as a kid Dad each night spraying the inside of the tent with DDT, and sleeping most of some nights with the Coleman on to try to keep warm. So far I have survived. My humble opinion is that 2 inches of coil in a large cabin is not going to kill anybody, but I am not a scientist, so what do I know? Just sharing what I do. We read the directions and take our chances if we feel up to it. Appreciate the input, have a great day! Bill"
6666558,Eckohlt,2022-06-22 10:22:00,3685,"I've had 2 full coils going all night many many times,I'm healthier than most 20 year old's."
6666560,SterlingArcher,2022-06-22 10:27:00,92,"Cat Track on Savant Lake has a nice cleaning house, and even better they will clean your fish for you at no charge! Just drop em off and go."
6666700,N_of_Quibell,2022-06-22 16:26:00,151,"I like Thermacells so much I have 2 of them, and I use them indoors (with moderation), contrary to the label instructions. Thermacells use the same active ingredients as many coils, such as OFF! I believe the one of the major beef against coils is not the active ingredient, but the incense-like combustibles used to vaporize the active ingredient. Thermacell's butane burns arguably cleaner, but the active ingredient in both still have at least the theoretical capacity to produce liver damage. Life is full of tradeoffs. I'll risk some theoretical chances of liver damage to reduce my discomfort and risk of mosquitoe borne illness, such as West Nile here in Wi. For my liver's sake, I do lay off the booze when I think I'm going to be inhaling much of the stuff. I am not saying any of this is a good idea, it's just what I do."
6666186,Bill Krejca,2022-06-21 06:45:00,6107,"Coils work great in cabin for the night, just a small piece several inches long will clean out the entire cabin if folks aren't reintroducing by going in and out. (Keep the beer inside.) Bill"
6666252,SD-walleye,2022-06-21 10:35:00,192,"I have never tried the coils, are there certain ones that work better than others?"
6666270,KC Walleye,2022-06-21 11:48:00,274,"You have lived a long life Bill, from what I have gathered on here, maybe you enjoy breathing in all those small smoke particles and formaldehyde I haven't seen a coil recommended for indoor use ..most specifically say outdoor use only. Google shows how many cigarette equivalents burning those coils is equivalent to. Be careful in your advice!"
6666288,Eckohlt,2022-06-21 12:16:00,3685,"I'm still here after burning them for 50 years,bigger cabins i fire up 2."
6666316,valley366,2022-06-21 13:37:00,193,"We just buy the cheep ones at local discount store. Place them on the deck by the entrance door, maybe 2 if thick.You can also look at the thermocel's, they have done well for us too."
6666344,kswalleyer,2022-06-21 15:56:00,1651,ive done this many times in the boundary waters and I can tell you that you learn to get your business done very fast....like before you can spell mississippi fast. You cant even defend yourself!your exposed *** is like a biscuits and gravy truck pulling up on the ice at 10:00 AM on Lake of the woods.
6666358,Eckohlt,2022-06-21 16:36:00,3685,You got that right!!
6666412,RichA$1970,2022-06-21 19:59:00,1159,"After getting eating alive while flirting fish at my fly-ins table at the dock, I’m leaning now to picking camps that have nice fish cleaning houses. I was spoiled last fall at Wildewoode on Savant with their fish cleaning house."
6666422,elway12,2022-06-21 21:58:00,335,You are correct Wildewood has a very nice fish cleaning house. But after cleaning the fish we always had to try to out run the mosquitos for the 50 yards to the cabin!
6666448,Eckohlt,2022-06-22 02:22:00,3685,"Rich better yet try to pick a lake with zero mosquitoes,they say boois on trout lake is the place."
6665876,Eckohlt,2022-06-20 04:34:00,3685,Better to drop the drawers than to sit in the boat with it in your drawers!!
6665930,ryguy,2022-06-20 07:54:00,11,Thermacell 10000%never leave home without mine.. try to stay away from Coils now if we have this thing going but it's wonderful to even take the handheld one to the outhouse and not be eaten alive while your trying to do your business
6665946,Eckohlt,2022-06-20 08:24:00,3685,"Love coils,drops'em out of the sky like raindrops."
6665958,Pooch,2022-06-20 09:03:00,4618,"We use coils when needed, but usually break them into small parts so they don't hammer us, too. Watching 'skeeters drop/fall like they've been shot is cheap entertainment on a trapped in the cabin rainy day. Pooch"
6666004,fishron,2022-06-20 11:59:00,317,"New Jersey is famous for biting critters. There's a repellent that really popular that is all natural. No deet or harmful chemicals. It's called Captain Ron's. I'm not a salesman, just heard it really works."
6666078,vteye3,2022-06-20 17:14:00,496,"Just back as my trip report indicates bugs were bad at camp on the blue bird days. That nastiness includes being out on the water. Black flies at airport Cordingly Lake were ferocious. No surprise really, high water, lots of water standing is perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes. Bring lots of coils, deet and a sheet to pull over the noggin at night"
6666110,SterlingArcher,2022-06-20 19:25:00,92,My cpap will be like a snorkel at night. I can pull blankets all the way over my head and my magic breathing tube will do the rest &#x1f923;
6666118,gopherbuddy,2022-06-20 20:01:00,51,What coils are people using that they find effective?
6666126,SweetD,2022-06-20 20:24:00,243,If you don’t have one get a Thermacell…….they are maybe $30 with the butane and little inserts needed to run them!!!!
6666140,packpro,2022-06-20 21:50:00,695,"They were bad for our trip at the beginning of the month. Yes, it is the high water. Some of the guides had mosquito nets for time at the dock. Could have sold them for big bucks. Came home and order two off of Amazon around $10. Ready for next year. The bites itch for over a week."
6665786,Hewhocookstomuch,2022-06-19 15:49:00,66,"I strongly recommend anyone going to North West Ontario in next few weeks be prepared for unbelievable hordes of mosquitoes. Lots of bug spray, repellent, Benadryl, calamine lotion and hydro odor ointment Never have I experienced anything like this. In the Deep South or my many trips to Canada."
6665790,valley366,2022-06-19 15:58:00,193,They are thick and they are huge. We burnt coils at cabin door every day and when out by the grill had 2 going.
6665802,Ricky Spanish,2022-06-19 17:21:00,1298,"Two weeks ago in N WI they were as thick and bloodthirsty as I've ever seen. Heading up to Eagle Lake, ON tomorrow morning for the week. Praying for wind because bug spray makes me feel like I've been poisoned."
6665804,walleyecheek,2022-06-19 17:22:00,2231,Its because of all the high water !
6665808,Eckohlt,2022-06-19 18:02:00,3685,"Wear a bug jacket,remember skeeters need to eat also,they were in a feeding frenzy last week,fish were full of mayfly large.Every creature up there is bulking up."
6665812,SterlingArcher,2022-06-19 18:07:00,92,"Can't be any worse than what we've been dealing with in northern MN. Apply DEET, keep moving, don't leave the cabin door open."
6665814,Hewhocookstomuch,2022-06-19 18:11:00,66,The dragonflies haven't hatched yet. Their main diet is mosquitoes. Things should get better then. The mosquitoes followed us out the lake as far as fifty yards. The wind only helped to move them around.
6665824,7 Mag,2022-06-19 18:46:00,1887,"They were bad. I use a thermocell, they work great in a boat."
6665848,Hewhocookstomuch,2022-06-19 20:48:00,66,We used thermacells on the deck while grilling. The only thing that kept them away.
6665854,Net_Man,2022-06-19 21:53:00,580,On fly-in trips - A fogger was always on my list of things to bring after the first 2 weeks of the start of the season. If they are bad and you are out fishing a ways from the cabin I always felt sorry for anyone that might need to pull over on a island that needed to drop his drawers.................
