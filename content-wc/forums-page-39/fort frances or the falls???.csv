6666778,SterlingArcher,2022-06-22 21:58:00,92,Cross first. My group used to drive to Dryden and stay overnight there. Now we go all the way to Sioux Lookout...really shortens up the final leg of the drive and we don't have to wake up as early to get to the plane.
6667178,btyreprich,2022-06-24 04:15:00,1067,Absolutely true! I have always made our motel reservations close to a year in advance and confirm with the owners 2 months before our stay. Our motel of choice is The Hilltop - very clean and comfortable. We are at the border by 6 am and have never had a long wait at border inspection. Breakfast at the Mcdonalds in FF.
6667190,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-24 05:18:00,8293,Hilltop is a excellent choice. I've always been impressed by how clean the place was and the new(er) owners are following suit. It will be interesting to see what the new motels (Cobblestone & Americ Inn) charge for a room. I know Cobblestone will have a bar & restaurant but i'm not sure what Americ Inn has.
6666592,Walleye2242,2022-06-22 11:48:00,263,Opinions.....have done both..stayed in falls and crossed early AM. crossed to Fort in the afternoon and stayed there. What do you guys think is easier and convenient? Thanks.
6666600,emma17,2022-06-22 12:00:00,436,"I've done both and prefer to cross into FF in the evening. Then it's wake up, hit the grocery store and to the camp w no worries of border crossing."
6666602,SweetD,2022-06-22 12:04:00,243,My preference is Fort Frances so we are not impacted by delays that could impact our arrival time and potentially our flight into our lake. If driving in more flexibility with arrival times so may not be as big a deal. My tendency and lean over the years is to get across the border night before and that will allow for some flexibility……..it is within your control once you are across.
6666656,nitroman,2022-06-22 14:27:00,368,"Sleep in Canada, eat pancakes at La place De Rendezvous in the morning. Just feels better when you get across the border."
6666678,valley366,2022-06-22 14:51:00,193,"Agree with cross then sleep. Just so much more relaxing. Had pondered the thought of doing the morning cross when couldn't find a hotel due to booking late, glad I found an open hotel.We also go to camps that check in is in the afternoon. If we crossed in the early AM to avoid traffic we would have to find something to do for a couple hours."
6666704,Fishin Fun,2022-06-22 16:43:00,218,Stayed at FF this year for the first time. We've always stayed in the Falls prior years. I did like the fact that we had to just get up in the morning and go and not worry about crossing the border and the traffic delay doing so. I do like the place we stay in the Falls better though.
6666722,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-22 17:31:00,8293,Everyone who responded said to stay in FF. gives you a idea how many cross the border as every motel room in International Falls is sold out on Friday nights. Enjoy your trips and stay safe traveling.
6666742,glncanada99,2022-06-22 19:03:00,13,We have been crossing the border around 3:00pm and staying a hotel in FF. Border times are a lot easier and able to get a decent start in the morning!
6666748,7 Mag,2022-06-22 19:18:00,1887,"I’m staying in IF on a Friday night and will cross Saturday morning, check in for me isn’t until 2 pm so I have plenty of time to get to Vermillion Bay."
6666766,x4flatfish,2022-06-22 20:30:00,319,"We stay in the Falls. Last minute shopping, fuel, eat and sleep all with American dollars. Cross in the am and into camp by noon. Never had much of wait to cross. With the new cleaning rules some places don't allow check in until 3 or 4 anyway. Dump the boat and go catch dinner..."
