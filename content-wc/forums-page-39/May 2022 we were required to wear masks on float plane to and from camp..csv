6666368,Golden Eagle,2022-06-21 17:13:00,2642,Our pilot was following orders from their government. It went well except I had to borrow a used mask for the ride back to Red Lake.
6666370,vteye3,2022-06-21 17:21:00,496,"Yep we were required to wear one as well going in, coming out were dealing with a wild situation so no one was asked,"
6666388,SweetD,2022-06-21 18:08:00,243,Canâ€™t just leave it like that Vleye!!!! Dealing with a wild situation like what?????
6666608,stumcfar,2022-06-22 12:15:00,451,No mention of a mask on our June 1st trip. The pilot didn't wear one nor were we asked.
6666644,walleyecheek,2022-06-22 13:58:00,2231,A USED ONE ! way to go !
6666654,Eckohlt,2022-06-22 14:23:00,3685,Wonder how many people used it before you Golden??
6666690,Mojo-NC,2022-06-22 16:11:00,1929,"Ewwww, a used mask from someone you don't even know? I won't even wear a mask my wife has already worn. That's worse than wearing someone else's underwear. We brought our masks last September for our fly-in and were told ""you don't need those here!"" We were all vaccinated and confirmed negative, so if they were comfortable with us not wearing one, so were we."
6666746,Golden Eagle,2022-06-22 19:11:00,2642,"How many is not a problem.Depends on what was used 4. 4 is not a preposition, is it?Actually it was a spare that had been used, then washed, before I used it to hide my face."
6667106,X-monarch,2022-06-23 18:08:00,52,Not just in Canada where you might be asked to wear a mask. We have been informed we WILL be wearing a mask on our float plane trip out of Homer Ak next month.
