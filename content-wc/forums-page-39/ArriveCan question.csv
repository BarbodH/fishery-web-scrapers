6666990,elway12,2022-06-23 12:51:00,335,You just have to put in the passport(s) number.
6666992,lmoore,2022-06-23 12:52:00,40,"You have to have the passport info in ArriveCAN, you can either scan a picture or enter it manually. Don't necessarily need a picture of it."
6666994,10point,2022-06-23 12:52:00,102,Yes you do. It will not work without it.
