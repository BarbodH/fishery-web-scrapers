6666498,acplumber,2022-06-22 07:10:00,80,Hi has anyone travelled it lately? We leave in 2 days and google maps is saying its the shortest route. Is it worth it? Thx
6666512,10lbeye,2022-06-22 07:47:00,61,"I have not traveled it, but from what I've read on this issue from other posters, the answer is not worth it. Last year we went via 584 and it was a nice, relaxing last leg form Geraldton to Nakina."

Stay Safe"
6666712,vteye3,2022-06-22 17:15:00,496,"RT 584 is beautiful, new pavement and has been straightened out. You can drive 80-100 kmh no problem other than a couple of turns and RR crossing. I would not even consider saving a few minutes to drive a dirt logging road."
6666724,tooski,2022-06-22 17:36:00,393,I've done it several times heading to Nakina Air. You might save 20 minutes off the drive. Road conditions change as early in the year we experienced some washouts. I have seen worse logging roads but it is definitely a logging road. For us the worst trips were getting stuck behind a logging truck. Might as well pull over and wait for the dust to settle.
6666732,acplumber,2022-06-22 18:12:00,80,Alright thx for your input. We have a truck and a minivan. Weâ€™ll stick to the paved road

I have not traveled the possible alternative, but have taken others which look on paper to be alternatives and have found out they turn into rock strewn cow paths which even a cow would avoid. * The highway can even be somewhat slow going in places, but it certainly has improved, based on my last journey on it , perhaps 5 years ago, compared with some earlier trips. Have fun, the area has some goof fishing! Bill"
