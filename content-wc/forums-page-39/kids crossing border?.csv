I think we have rules figures out now. parents both stabbed, will have prearrival testing done for kids. everything uploaded to arrivcan app. the day before. no eggs, chicken, bait, etc. will also have dogs with but to date have not seen any covid requirements for them lol. biggest challenge has been finding dog food with no chicken products in it."
6664916,MN Brandon,2022-06-15 11:36:00,14,Both kids will have to take a test prior to crossing the border. Both kids will have to take a test at the border (Kind of a pain) Both kids will also have to quarantine. (if your at fishing camp this should be fine) There is also a day 8 test they will have to take if you stay that long. One way around all the testing but not the quarantine is if both kids have a positive test less than 180 days old. Hope this helps. We cross with our kids often and both are unvaccinated.

6665702,kettyspanky,2022-06-19 06:11:00,271,Kinda wondering if it helps having the kids vaccinated to hopefully avoiding a random test. My son is vaccinated and hoping this helps with border entry. I know they are ( random ) but hope we don't get one. We have no cell service when we are up there and the resort has no wifi. Just wondering how border crossing with kids has been going for the rest of you.
6665706,RRK285,2022-06-19 06:22:00,44,I crossed on 5/31 with my 8 and 9 year old neither are vaxed. Crossing took less than a minute total. They guy at the booth did want me the driver to be wearing a mask which i did not have in the truck.
6667460,7thCrowWing,2022-06-24 18:04:00,132,"Tried to cross today with unvax 13 year old. Followed everything we were told by Noto ( they assured us we would be fine if follow procedure )and CAnada Covid website resources. I was comfortable in the process, we pre tested and such. They turned us back. In short if you going fishing your not getting across unvaxxed anyone over 12. No different rules for 12-17 We have found accommodations at vermillion lake but still a disaster. Border agents were rude and aggressive."
6667468,Eckohlt,2022-06-24 18:15:00,3685,"Ya they don't like unvaxxed people,that's why I'm jacked up with 5 shots,they like that."
6667470,MN Brandon,2022-06-24 18:27:00,14,I have crossed with unvaxed kids over 20 times. 12-15yr old. Need negative test. Take test after crossing border. Another test on day 8. Must have a location (cabin) to quarantine. Never had an issue.
6667576,NARDA 1,2022-06-25 06:40:00,636,I would contact the border where you intend to cross and speak with a supervisor and ask what is required. Make sure you get his name and that way if you have any issues you have someone to refer to.
