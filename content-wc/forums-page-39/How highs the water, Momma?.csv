All four truck tires were in the water before the back of the boat was over the first concrete plank of the landing itself. Lots of floating branches and logs in the wster all the way around Big Island and up past Ogaman light.

I know it's 1170.something, but it seems like the height at one end in numbers isn't as easily registered in my head as how many concrete planks are out of the water. Thanks! Down to 7 sleeps and a wake-up!!"
6663350,David Anderson,2022-06-09 22:45:00,2073,Loaded up there 2 weeks ago and no concrete visible. Had to back the bumper into the water to get enough clearance to load the boat. The level looks to be a little higher now than it was then.
6663568,Skywagon,2022-06-11 04:59:00,1106,"I drove past the Deception landing yesterday afternoon on the way back from the cabin. The water was still high up on the boat house's at Frog Rapids, it had not change a lot in a week and a half, my lake was down about a foot, still above the normal high water mark, I assume the Deception landing has probably not changed much since then either. The by-pass around Sioux Lookout is now open, but there is still water standing around the motel near Dick and Nellie's and a little on the by-pass road."

6663632,bigwalleye1,2022-06-11 11:07:00,2632,"Thanks, Skywagon! We'll be there Thursday! I have visions of having to launch the boat in the parking lot at Deception!"

6663956,PRO-V16,2022-06-12 21:25:00,454,My buddy has landed at Deception 3 or 4 times now since opener and has reported no problems. I had to skip this trip due to medical problems. Sigh &#x1f614;
6666056,1shooter,2022-06-20 15:53:00,1493,Got back last Friday from Obabikon Bay Resort and WOW was the water high. It had to be 4' above normal levels.
6666190,Bill Krejca,2022-06-21 06:48:00,6107,Should have been easy getting into/out of Obabikon Lake. Dd you try fishing the narrows at Turtle? Should have been mega current there. Bill
6666216,1shooter,2022-06-21 08:15:00,1493,you didnt even have to trim the motor up and yes there was some major current
