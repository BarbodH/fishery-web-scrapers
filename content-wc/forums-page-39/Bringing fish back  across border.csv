6666964,BuckeyeATC,2022-06-23 11:57:00,88,"I agree with all the above. A Vac sealer is worth its weight in gold for fish and at home butchering. In 40+ years of going to Canada we have never been stopped nor asked about bringing fish back into the States. Just make sure they are filleted and properly packaged. If we could bring back more than 4 per person more people would do it, imo."
6666982,eyecatcher1,2022-06-23 12:37:00,323,Does the plug have to be out in Canada too now guidedfishing?
6666984,guidedfishing,2022-06-23 12:48:00,531,"Yup, the CO was very polite about it but would not move on until I pulled it, I also have the intake for the back live well plugged because I use it for storage and he asked that I pull that plug as well. He said it was a change this year so they are giving everyone a grace notification before further enforcement takes place."
6667000,eyecatcher1,2022-06-23 13:01:00,323,"Thanks! I thought that had to be a new rule. Here in Minnesota the plug always has to be out when the boat is on the trailer, but I used to leave it in while in Canada."
6667016,Net_Man,2022-06-23 13:46:00,580,If you have dead air space in your cooler above the frozen items - if you take some thing like a bath towel (preferably clean bath towel ) and lay it over your frozen items covering them it will help keep things frozen longer. 2 layers of bath towels is better than one.
6667064,Old Timer,2022-06-23 16:12:00,255,Maybe seven or eight years ago I was at a game stop on Highway 11 close to Rainy River. The couple next to me had wads of fish in frozen milk cartons. They were getting pinched for not having their take readily identifiable and who knows what else. The two of them got loud and ugly while pleading their case. They were getting nowhere from what I could see. Here's something interesting. I've had fish checked while coming back through U.S. customs. Once at IF and the other at Baudette. No different than a stop in Canada. Maybe the two countries have a cooperation agreement of some kind I didn't ask.
6667068,walleyecheek,2022-06-23 16:23:00,2231,Colder water in Canada ? Yeah maybe in May !
6667110,Eckohlt,2022-06-23 18:20:00,3685,"Water was alittle cool when I went swimming everyday starting June 13,At the almighty wapesi lake."
6667222,Bakefish,2022-06-24 07:44:00,1077,"I was driving home down 502 one year and was very low on gas. I turned onto highway 11 I pulled into the first gas station. As I was filling up a CO pulled up and started filling up right next to me. He asked if we had a good time. I said that we did. He asked if we caught any fish. I said we did. He asked if we kept any. I said, yes we did, would you like to see them. He did...right there at the gas pump. Nice enough guy, just doing his job."
6667462,glncanada99,2022-06-24 18:05:00,13,Good one !^^^^^^^^^^^^
6666824,lmoore,2022-06-23 06:22:00,40,"Never an issue for us either. One thing we started doing about 10 years ago is to submerge the filets in water in the ziplock before freezing them. You don't want much, just enough that you end up with a thin layer of ice on all sides. Reduces or removes issues with freezer burn and they don't develop such a strong ""fishy taste."" I just ate some from our trip a year agp and they tasted great."
6666828,IowaWalleye1978,2022-06-23 06:47:00,96,lol!
6666832,eyecatcher1,2022-06-23 06:55:00,323,Never had a problem in 30 years two or three trips every year.
6666834,bigwalleye1,2022-06-23 07:02:00,2632,"I've never had any issues either. Actually , it's always been less of an inspection and line of queries coming home than going in."
6666840,Old Timer,2022-06-23 07:14:00,255,I've had more than my share of drop-in game checks while in camp. On more than one occasion the agents have told me the most common violation is fishermen packing up their take-home fish early in the trip and then continually keeping fish for dinner. They see it all the time.
6666858,Mojo-NC,2022-06-23 07:56:00,1929,"In the 20 years we've been going to Canada, we've never had a problem. We have not taken any extreme measures other than wrapping each pair of filets (with a bit of skin left on each filet) in freezer paper and labeling it as 17"" walleye (or whatever it is) with our name on each package. The wardens have checked us on the water and come back to camp with us to check the freezer - never an issue. Just remember that every time you decide to keep a fish, your personal limit drops by one. Often on the last day we only have one fish remaining to fill our limit. Once we catch and keep the last fish, we're done. That's why our last night at camp is steak night. At the US border, sometimes they ask if we are bringing fish back with us, sometimes not. We just tell them 4 walleyes and 4 pike. We've never actually been checked. The last few years we have not kept any fish at all, but it is not because of any hassle. It'd just difficult to keep fish frozen from 6 AM when we leave camp until midnight when we get home."
6666872,valley366,2022-06-23 08:21:00,193,The only time our groups have been checked at the border coming back was the year that one of our drivers forgot that half the party was in his truck and half in another. He had grabbed the fish total sheet off the fridge before departure that included all the fish in the freezer. He realized his mistake too late and the agents asked them to the inspection area. We were in compliance and the check took a couple minutes and we were on our way.We do our last fish fry on Wed night. Then get our last take home fish on Thursday so they get a good 24 hours in the freezer before departure. Also makes Friday a mess around day or fun day. Explore places we don't normally fish or pursue another species.A good cooler goes a long way too. Don't have to get an expensive one but we have a coleman 6 day extreme. I know I didn't break the bank buying it. We filled it with our weeks worth of frozen meat and probably 10lbs of ice. We say overnight in Fort Frances on the way up and things are still frozen solid when we get to camp after 1.5 days. There is enough ice that we pack that in bags and throw it in the freezer and use that ice on the return trip. everything was still ice cold when we got back.
6666904,NM_Trout,2022-06-23 09:05:00,1094,Was out last week on an outpost trip. We ate walleye every day except one. I am ok not seeing another walleye fillet for quite awhile ;-)The border agent on the cross into the US did ask if we were bringing fish home. I was shocked by the question that I almost laughed before I caught myself and told her no. I bet I'll want some walleye in a month or so......
6666920,guidedfishing,2022-06-23 09:44:00,531,"I have never had an issue bringing back a limit of fish. The wife when she does not go with expects at least one walleye dinner when I get home. Now with multiple trips each year I pretty much expect to get stopped at a check point or prior to crossing the border at least once each year, and I typically do. Whether the packages are frozen or unfrozen we make sure the skin is clearly visible, and the package clearly labeled with species and over / under if frozen the fish are individually packed if not frozen then we put a limit per person of that species in a ziploc. Lake trout typically each half gets its own bag. The key is the fish must be easily counted and species identified. Very difficult for a CO to count a limit of fish frozen together. Typically the officer will want to look in each live well, then look in each cooler so keep you coolers handy and not buried. Same with your license, don't bury it in your bags or in the boat keep handy. Line of questions is how was the fishing, what do you have for fish, did you fish this morning? The next question you will likely get will be what did you have for lunch or supper last night? This is key. Because if you have a limit of walleye, and you said you had walleye for supper or shore lunch last night, and you did not fish that day you are traveling, but you have your limit of fish you will get pinched for being over your bag limit. Our last meal is always burgers, or brats, pork chops, or steak etc. Make sure the limits of fish correspond to the number of individuals in the vehicle. Do not haul all your crews catch in a single cooler in one vehicle. last but not least make darn sure your plug is pulled on the boat and live wells. You don't want to give any CO who may be having a bad day an opportunity to take it out on you. I have never had an issue on the US side just declaring what we have for fish if asked at all. Its so much simpler to just follow the rules."
6666944,Eckohlt,2022-06-23 11:15:00,3685,"I eat eye twice a day up fishing,then at least 5 nights straight when I get home,it's never enough."
6666752,dstemp,2022-06-22 19:55:00,16,Im making my second trip to Canada soon last fall I did not bring and fish back But talking with some people who go fishing up there often tell me not to they say its a big hassle at the border crossing So Im confused if one follows there rules as to how it must be prepared why are my friends telling me its not worth it am I missing something interested in any feedback on this
6666754,Pooch,2022-06-22 20:15:00,4618,"I agree with your friends. Some of our group bring home fish others do not. I too agree that it is a PITA. Best to not freeze them as they just don't seem the same back home. Some who live a short drive back to the states get along ok, but we are nearly two days drive and keeping them half ways fresh isn't worth the hassle. Long time ago a conservation officer told me that many of the fish they check are going to be inedible by the time they get back to home.After several meals of walleye I'm ready for good old American cheeseburger. Pooch"
6666758,Lmbkiller,2022-06-22 20:22:00,639,Nothing but misinformation is all hear ..bringing fish back is 0 hassle if u have a brain
6666760,SweetD,2022-06-22 20:23:00,243,"If bringing fish home I would strongly suggest packing 1 fish(two fillets) per ziplock bag with plenty of skin left on to identify species. Alternate the two fillets in opposite direction so can readily see the separation and identify. Freeze solid before departing camp and if can locate some dry ice ideal but regular ice will work too. Be sure you have your license and be sure your license limits align with the number of fish you have (e.g, 2 Walleye for Conservation License and 4 Walleye for Full Season License). Finally, be sure while in camp you don’t keep 4 in the freezer and continue to fish for, catch and keep additional fish to eat. The limit prescribed by your license includes both fish in your freezer and fish on your stringer…….do not exceed your license limit. Good luck"
6666762,x4flatfish,2022-06-22 20:24:00,319,Always bring fish back to Illinois. No hassle at all. Vacuum pack and freeze. If we drive straight through (15 hours) just pack in a GOOD cooler with some ice packs. If we stay overnight we get a little dry ice to keep them frozen. In over 50 years never an issue. Fish still taste great even months after we get home. Fish caught in the colder water of Canada taste better than fresh fish caught here...to each his own...but I don't think it's a hassle...
6666772,valley366,2022-06-22 21:37:00,193,"Best investment I ever made was a vacuum sealer. It is a savior in fishing and at home. At home we buy chicken especially in bulk and vacuum seal meal size portions.On any of the trips we do it is a pretty simple process. Fillet the the fish the way you normally do it but leave the last couple inches of skin on the fillets. Then wash them clean and let dry in a strainer for an hour or so in the fridge. Then lay out on paper towels and pat them dry.Cut the bags to size for the fillet to lay flat. Usually a couple inches longer then each side of the fillet. IE if you have a 10 inch fillet cut bags about 14 inches long. Pair your fillets together and you can package 2 fish or more in each bag. I recommend 2 fish as they fit nicely.Kit is they have to be identifiable as individual fish.Vacuum seal and lay flat in the freezer. I label each bag with date, location, species and quantity.I was stopped by Ontario CO's on the way out this year and they specified that our fish were packaged perfect. He even complimented us on them.Pic attached so you get the picture. It is not a hassle. My 13yo packages all of our fish on our trips.I have packaged fish and eaten them a year later and taste as fresh as the day we caught them."
6666776,SterlingArcher,2022-06-22 21:56:00,92,"Agreed. If they're put in the freezer immediately after fileting they will be delicious no matter how long your drive, and as long as you have legal fish it's zero hassle crossing the border with them."
6666782,Old Timer,2022-06-22 22:32:00,255,"Interesting topic. I'm old enough to remember when we brought fish home gutted and gilled, and packed frozen in banded wooden crates full of sawdust. That was the law. There were packing outfits in Sioux Lookout that provided this service. I remember is being an expensive hassle. For me, bringing fish home is still a hassle and so I don't do it anymore. But when I did I'd follow Valley's procedure to the T when I had electricity. Otherwise it was ziplocks."
6666784,elway12,2022-06-22 22:34:00,335,"We cannot get good walleye here in AZ so we always bring some home. I agree with most all of the posts saying it's very little hassle. We have taken fish all the way back home to ARIZONA on every trip we have made to Canada. One time we waited almost a full year to thaw and cook them and they still tasted great! I keep ALL of the skin on the fillets. I think it helps protect the meat(freezer burn). Though a vacuum sealer is the best food protection - I have never brought one to use. I just make sure to get as much air out of the fillets bags as I can. I also make sure the fillets are frozen solid for transport home. I wrap the fillets up with newspaper & tape to help insulate them & put them in Ziploc bags(fillets in plastic bag, wrapped over with newspaper, then put in a Ziploc). I have been lucky enough not to have been stopped for inspection. But if I ever do I would just have to take them out of the Ziploc and newspaper."
6666816,Freytown,2022-06-23 06:13:00,770,Never had a problem bring fish back. 40+ years doing so! FT
