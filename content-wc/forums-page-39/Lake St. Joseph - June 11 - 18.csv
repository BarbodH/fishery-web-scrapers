6667174,Eckohlt,2022-06-24 03:20:00,3685,"I've seen better looking fish than you guys,,,,,,,,just kidding hahaha,looks like a crew with many many stories to be told!!"
6666688,stjoeguy,2022-06-22 16:06:00,979,"Our trip started well with a smooth border crossing at noon on Friday. All the gates were open, for the first time in a while, and we were third in line. The wait was 15 minutes at most. The icing on the cake was that nobody got the random Covid test box! Last fall year we got the random test boxes on 2 out of 4 trips. Our truck was a case of beer over the limits but were just waved on with no duty. The trip was lots of water, mosquitos and fish. The water was the highest I've seen and the mosquitos were the worst. Lake level was extremely low last fall and extremely high this June. Fishing was great, however. Biggest caught were a 40혬 northern and a 27.5혬 walleye. Boats had 100+ fish days most of the week. We had 9 guys this trip and everyone had a great time. We were going to be 10, but a guy had to drop out at the last minute after testing positive. I brought a neighbor with failing eyesight that really doesn't fish much. He was practically giddy getting so many fish, including a 25.5혬 walleye and 37혬 northern. It was a joy watching him bring in fish after fish. We had a lot of animal sightings this year, also. 7 bears and 4 moose on the early morning drive from Sioux Lookout up to Lake St. Joseph, a bear crossing the front yard of the cabin and a moose swimming between islands while we were there. Then there were 3 bears and another moose on the way home. There were a lot of pelicans on the lake. We never used to see them, but they've been quite common in the last several years. There were a couple sandhill cranes hanging around. I've never seen them up there in the past. Every evening the show was watching the gulls, eagles and pelicans going after the fish guts deposited on the island across the bay. Our meals were tremendous. Fried walleye, baked walleye, walleye creole, steak filets on the grill, home smoked bacon, elk brats, and biscuits & gravy. Why did we even bother going out fishing? Lightning forced us off the lake one afternoon and probably raised the lake another couple inches with heavy rain all afternoon. One morning we fished through a sudden, very heavy, but short rainfall. That was followed by some great weather. All in all, it was a great trip, even with the mosquitos."

6666694,Eckohlt,2022-06-22 16:17:00,3685,"Nice report stjoeguy,marlin perkins would have loved that trip with all the critters running around n birds,,to bad the pelicans can't swoop down with there mouth open and gobble up all the skitters near the cabin."
6666696,Eckohlt,2022-06-22 16:19:00,3685,"Which one is you in the pic,I only see one handsome guy must be you hahaha."
6666706,stjoeguy,2022-06-22 16:47:00,979,"Yup, that's me."
6666710,phishfearme,2022-06-22 17:08:00,1242,Great trip StJoeguy - where did you stay? could you please fill us in on the special permits required for the lake and if the barbless requirement challenges you? thanks phish
6666764,SweetD,2022-06-22 20:28:00,243,Good to hear St Joe guy. We will be at Root Bay in a few weeks so hoping the fishing remains on fire and the bugs get swept away by the wind!!!! Thanks for sharing your report!!!!!

6666770,stjoeguy,2022-06-22 21:22:00,979,"I've stayed at three different camps on Lake St. Joseph. 2001-2006 we stayed at Camp Lake St. Joseph on the east end of the lake. It's a fairly rustic, multi-cabin camp. There's another camp located close to Camp Lake St. Joseph called Old Post. I've never stayed there, but some members of my group have. It's fancier with guides, meals, etc. From 2007 on I've stayed in June at the Winoga Lodge outpost cabin 25 miles down the lake. It's a single boat-in cabin that's isolated like a fly-in. I've also stayed in the fall twice at the Eagle Island location 20 miles further down the lake and the Root Bay cabin at the west end of the lake, both operated by Slate Falls Outposts as fly-in cabins. I'm going to Root Bay for the second time this August. The permit system, called the Lake St. Joseph Accord, is an agreement between MNR and camp operators that limits the number of nonresident fishermen. It's run by the camps, so if you've got a reservation, you've got a permit. The Accord also requires single barbless hooks. You might lose a few fish, but as you can see by the numbers, it's not a big deal. It comes in handy when reaching over the side of the boat to easily unhook a northern."
6666790,btyreprich,2022-06-23 04:21:00,1067,Great report - thanks for sharing! There was no doubt in my mind that the trip would be fantastic. Here's hoping I get the invite from you next year. It's been too many years since I have fished Lake St Joseph and with an experienced guide such as yourself the possibilities are endless.
