6666566,jambi,2022-06-22 10:40:00,504,"Two man trip to Darkwater Lake operated by Northland Outpost Company (www.fishnorthland.com) arriving Monday June 6th thru Monday June 13th. Took my brother-in-law; his first trip to Canada. After all these years of hearing how awesome Canada trips are, he finally came with me. I'm glad he did as none of my other buddies are jabbed. We flew out of Showalter's base north of Ear Falls - A quick 18 minute flight and we were unpacking at 8am. Kyle and Trista Wood have an incredible outpost on Darkwater Lake. The cabin is up on a 25 ft bluff above the water  views out the of the cabin are stellar facing WNW which was perfect for campfires and sunsets. There is a small screened-in sheltered structure for grilling which was nice  it also had a picnic table. Cabin is standard two bedroom, kitchen, shower/sink setup with two refrigerators. Everything was very clean, the cabin was built in 2012. Deck is large and in great condition. Kyle has planned to build a screened-in fish cleaning/boat house later this year which will be a very cool addition to the camp. Cabin has solar lighting setup, and also a small honda generator that can plug in to the house and tie into outlets for charging etc. We didn't run it but a couple hours all week. Boats are newer style Lund that have the cut-away for the tiller access equipped w/ new 15 hp motors. There is a lot of water to fish here, but it's pretty narrow overall  so wind wasn't a factor. It fishes as if several small lakes are tied together vs a big-water feel. With this year's high water, the current is quite noticeable in many of the neckdown/narrows. We explored the entire system  I was hoping to find fish at the inflow of the Whitemud River (there was quite a bit of water coming in here), but it was more of a flat 3-4' deep slough area instead of a rapids. I wish I went back here and pulled off some to the first deep water but maybe next time. We traveled to the north to the outflow area. Water was clipping here over some big rapids; we hiked a little through the woods to try to bank fish below but it was overgrown and didn't think we could fish it during the heavy flow. After all the exploration we went back to sets of narrows and it was game on. During the week, we'd still spend some time trolling, casting for pike etc with decent action around the lake but the piles of walleyes in six or seven spots that we pinpointed were hard to stay away from. We had easy 120-140+ fish days. Fair size overall and loads of fun especially for my BIL, the first timer. We had many over 20 with best few at 23. The pike fishing was interesting to me  the flats/reeds didn't hold willing fish; They were all ganged up with the walleyes in these holes. I think this was the best week I've had for numbers of 30-32 pike. We had a half dozen or so 34-36. I lost a tank of a pike on the last morning. One to remember, and one to go back for! Water temps 57 to start and 65 by end of the week. I must say we had seven days of picture-perfect weather, only wearing raingear on 45 minutes all week. Of note I talked to the group of six fished after us and just came out on Monday. (6-13-22 to 6-20-22). They had sore thumbs from clickers cycling and totals for six guys @ 3,100 fish with a 27 walleye best. Funny my BIL ended the trip with something like so I just experienced a perfect Canada fishing trip and it's all downhill from here, right? I had to laugh at him when he said that! Kyle Wood is a first-class outfitter; his communications up to and during the trip were well appreciated. Another first-class outfitter is Eddie Showalter. I enjoyed catching up with him; we are a regular of his but he didn't have a slot for only two guys. Like everyone we are hoping the border opens fully later in the year for a possible fall trip and a bigger group in 2023."
