6666888,Cgillespie,2022-06-23 08:36:00,120,I hate that dirt! I have to clean mine up and put them in newspaper bedding. This will save me time.
6666968,BuckeyeATC,2022-06-23 12:01:00,88,"The dirt definitely sucks. I always re-package in paper bedding or I used to, until the Canadians banned importation of worms. THAT WERE ALREADY COMING TO THE STATES FROM CANADA. As a border agent once told me when inspecting my worms ""EH, returning natives I see"". Makes no sense, but whatever....."
