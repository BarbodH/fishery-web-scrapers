We were on the water by 10:30 am but took us a good couple of hours running around to find a good bite. Water temps were still in the high 50s on the main lake areas, with upto high 60s in some bays. Fish were caught in 30'FOW to 4'FOW. Sweet spot was warmer water between 8'and 16' FOW, especially any shoreline where the SW wind was blowing onto it. Leeches absolutely crushed Â‘em, as did 3-4 plastics in various forms. Live Minnows not as productive, weird. There were fish and bait showing on the mid water humps, I predict they will be on their summer spots within the next week.VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/-ZdWZtREQ6M"
