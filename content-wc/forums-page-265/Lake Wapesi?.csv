3837353,schoolofhardknocks,2015-05-04 12:06:00,29,I've been there several times with my son and once alone for a week in Sept. Once the water was so high that a northern went onto the beach and almost on the cabin porch! My son was very pleased with the pilot also. Fishing is decent. We just eat what eat we catch for dinner and throw everything else back nowadays.
3837721,Carnhzkr,2015-05-04 14:23:00,964,Looks like your son wanted to take home more than just fish!
3840065,rnnonmt,2015-05-05 08:10:00,992,"The ""Wapesi"" you are thinking of can be boated to from deception launch. It is a long haul though. I have made the run from deception to the Wapesi river averaging about 40 mph. It was about an hour and 30 minutes to get there. Fishing is always good up there but so are many other places too. Stop and fish the submerged reefs on the north/east facing shore after you get through the little s turn into Wapesi Bay. If you go all the way to the river take the south arm (LH side) of the split. That is where the rapids are at. I don't recall any water flow on the north arm of the split."
4063778,Ebarnett,2015-07-20 18:34:00,60,"Our group of 10 just returned from Lake Wapesi. Pickerel Arm Camps has two fly in outposts on the lake and we stayed in the northern camp. In our group were two children and two adults that were there to relax and cruise the lake looking for wildlife as well as a little fishing. The other 6 of us were hard core fishermen who put in a lot of hours each day on the lake. None of us are very experienced at Walleye or pike fishing, nonetheless we caught 1700 fish for the week and had a blast. We caught many walleye over 20"" with our biggest being 25 1/2"". We also caught many pike over 30"" with our biggest being 38 3/4"". Its a beautiful lake, and the accommodations were excellent. The boats and motors all ran well."
3436274,Ebarnett,2015-01-11 12:21:00,60,"My group has narrowed it choice down to a few different lakes and outfitters (thanks everybody here! We got some great recomendations and i think any choice we make now will be a great one) but someone in my group saw Lake Wapesi with Pickerel arm camps and thought it looked great. Problem is I cant find any info on it...good or bad. It is directly above Lac Seul, so im guessing the fishing would be very good? Any help on this lake would be appreciated."
3442170,bigwillies,2015-01-13 14:23:00,515,the fishing is very good.haven't been there in quite a few years.a group of us would go for the opener.no problem catching plenty of walleyes.lake is pretty remote so there isn't much traffic on the lake.
3442594,Skywagon,2015-01-13 17:01:00,1106,"It is a good lake (but so are many others). We flew in there one winter in the ski-plane at lunch time, drilled holes in the ice and did not have time to eat, for catching walleye. We caught our limit immediately, ate, then finished off the day at another lake trout fishing. Very unusual for mid-day walleye ice fishing, the kind of day you remember, but will be hard to replicate."
3444706,bigwalleye1,2015-01-14 09:22:00,2632,"Anybody ever try to fish Wapesi on a boat in, launching from Deception Landing? I know it's a haul, but if you're gonna run to Bear Narrows.... Seems like we've always thought Wapesi was the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. For those that have, and ideas on fuel consumption and travel time? I'd like to go, but I'd also like to make sure I can get back again. Any idea if fuel is available at the camp for non-camp boats? Or is this a different Wapesi than the one I'm thinking of, that being the one past Bear Narrows, past Kekabeka Narrows?"
3445778,bigwillies,2015-01-14 17:13:00,515,there is no way u can drive a boat into wapesi from lac suel.there is a big set of rapids right at the begining of the river(wapesi end).if you google earth and zoom in enough u can see the rapids that go under the road.vermillion river rd. i think
3445874,Skywagon,2015-01-14 17:35:00,1106,"I have an interactive map of the area, and looked at getting from Lac Seul to Wapesi, you would have to travel down the Wapesi river. The map makes it look like with a canoe, maybe? Even if it were/is possible, you would be traveling a great distance, over a lot of good walleye fishing for more of the same. Don't get me wrong, I am in this for the adventure, but not sure if that one is do-able, or worthwhile. If you decide to try it, take Pooch along, he likes to paddle."
3445898,Blue Lk,2015-01-14 17:50:00,269,"30+ years ago I blasted the rock for the bridge abutments at the river,in the evenings we would catch & release more walleye than I have ever seen in my life.My crew was one of the first to drive the road through to Ear Falls."
3446106,bigwalleye1,2015-01-14 19:11:00,2632,I'm suspecting Wapesi lake is a different place than WapesI Bay. wapesi bay is past LS outposts camp on my Navionics map is showing a marked path line into wapesi bay.
3446354,Ebarnett,2015-01-14 21:03:00,60,"Correct! Lake Wapesi is a 12 mile long lake up river from Wapesi Bay (Lac Seul) but as one poster mentioned, no doubt the same great walleye water as found in Wapesi Bay and the Wapesi river. Lee at Pickerel Arm gave us a deal we couldnt refuse for the second week in July. The place looks awesome and we are stoked!"
3446666,Skywagon,2015-01-15 04:35:00,1106,"Blue LK, 30 years and all the logging roads that have been put in since then have caused some major changes haven't they? Many of those fly-in lakes north of Lac Seul now have road access, one way or the other. Kind of sad when I fly over that area in the summer and see the dust in the air being kicked up by a logging truck. The relatively untouched fishing and moose hunting just keeps getting pushed farther north... progress."
