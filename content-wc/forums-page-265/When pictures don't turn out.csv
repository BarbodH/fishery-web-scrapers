4063146,fishron,2015-07-20 14:41:00,317,Thanks for sharing. Nice walleye. I find it usually comes down to the length of your arms.
4065426,MrSimon,2015-07-21 10:15:00,922,"Ain't that the truth. Simply extending your arms a bit and holding the fish closer to the camera will make it look a lot bigger. We try to take our pictures quick to get the fish back in the water, but we also pay attention to where the sun is, what's in the background, and how the fish is being presented. An extra ten seconds to get those little details right can mean the difference between a crappy snapshot and a high quality memory that will last a lifetime. Proper focus and holding the phone/camera steady also is important."
4061914,SinOrSwim,2015-07-20 08:25:00,1528,"It is amazing to me how much difference one picture can be to another. Went up with my father in law and caught a couple really nice fish. Unfortunately, they happened at the same time so it was very hectic in the boat. My son (10) was the picture taker. The fish don't look nearly as big in the pictures as they really were. But, then I had some gopro footage of my father in laws fish and that actually does his fish justice. But, I don't have a single picture of mine that makes it look as big as it was. It's hard to brag about a fish and then when someone asks for a pic you don't want to show it. LOL ugh"
4061970,Golden Eagle,2015-07-20 08:36:00,2642,Hopefully you can use individual shots from your GoPro movie. I can with my Canon Pro 1. Share with us if it works for you.
4062010,SinOrSwim,2015-07-20 08:52:00,1528,"I did get a good shot of my father in laws fish from the go pro. Unfortunately I don't have much footage of mine and nothing clear. The one time I thought I would have, the gopro was set to a still shot. So, it didn't record. This was my first trip with the gopro."
4062026,SinOrSwim,2015-07-20 08:57:00,1528,Here you go.
4062034,SinOrSwim,2015-07-20 08:58:00,1528,release of my fish.

This was my first trip with the gopro.After my first year with my Gopro, I threw it all in a bag and put it in the corner, finally giving it to my youngest. This year, Bradley brought it with some sort of strange gizmo to keep it powered up so he took an icredible amount of footage."
4062290,Huntindave,2015-07-20 09:59:00,2194,"I fish solo a lot and have struggled with pictures. My solution is to use a function on my camera called ""interval shooting"" where it is set to take X number of pictures X amount of time between shots. At the beginning of the day I use my Gorilla Pod and position my camera such that later I can take a self portrait. I then adjust the settings for the camera to take ten photos over a 1 1/2 minute period of time. When the time comes for a picture, I push the button and have several chances and sufficient time for a good photo. Also once the camera is done, I KNOW it is time to get that fish back into the water pronto."
4062354,Lake Wisconsin,2015-07-20 10:11:00,1960,"I know your feeling. I have taken some photography classes early on in life and still use the basics even when simply using my iPhone. But when others take photos, most of the time they turn out like crap. I am working with my 10 year old son and he is coming along nicely for his age. Him and I did a Catch Record Release tourney this year, and we actually practiced prior to the tourney on taking photos. Need to make sure a 25"" walleye looks like a 25"" walleye."
4062410,fishman10,2015-07-20 10:25:00,226,Pictures never do fish justice. They always seem a lot smaller
4062938,SinOrSwim,2015-07-20 13:40:00,1528,"It's interesting. That fish he is holding looked much smaller when I look at the pictures on my phone. But, the go pro captured it much better. The only problem now is MY fish was bigger than that one but I don't have any go pro of it. Just the pics on my phone that my kid took. I don't mean this as a complaint because it was amazing but we had BOTH fish in the boat at the same time. As we were getting his out of the net my pole went down. It was a VERY hectic few minutes. My father in law doesn't move around in the boat so he stayed seated up front. My 10 year old did a great job with the net. A 29 and a 32.5 in a matter of minutes!!!!!!"
