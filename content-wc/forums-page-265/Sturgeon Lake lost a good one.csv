If he could have chosen a way and place to go ...... his wishes came true. We just came home from White Sands Camp and the mood was pretty sad. Twigg was a very unique man and his camp was 1 of a kind. If you knew him , you know what I mean. His son Troy will be operating it and keeping the tradition alive. Ive drank a few with Twigg and enjoyed his friendship. They will have a memorial service for him at Maries Bay later in August and I believe a service will also be held in Rhinelander sometime also. RIP buddy."
