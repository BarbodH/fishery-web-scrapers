Sounds like there are jumbo perch aplenty? Anybody have any good advice for places and techniques this time of year? Thanks in advance for any responses."

You might randomly see some or hook one--sometimes on comically large lures--and then proceed to catch more with small (~#2) mepps spinners or 1/8 once jigs with white twister tails. It seemed that a piece of crawler helped a lot.I believe I remembered that sometimes they would follow large lures, but not bite, or you'd get a bunch of little nip bites. It those cases it was handy to have something smaller to throw back at them. Similarly, there'd be some places you'd be more likely to expect to find them from experience. When fishing those places, I might downsize my pike lure to something like a mepps #4 in case.I do remember often seeing one type of weed that I associated with perch. They were really low growing weeds that were pretty shallow and looked a bit like a fern carpeting the lake bottom. IIRC, it was associated with cabbage. I wish I knew what it was called.My fuzzy memory also wants to assign perch to cabbage beds in sandy areas more than mucky areas.One spot that was fun to fish was the river between Keynote Lake and Wabaskang. You catch a lot of small pike and sometimes do well for perch trolling up and down it. The weedbeds in the first lake right before the narrows were another spot that I seem to remember catching a lot of perch in (along with small pike)--thought that may be more of a function of spending a lot of time fishing that spot.I had two fish I caught on Wabaskang mounted. One was a 14.5"" perch I caught in 1985 when I was 5. The other was a 31.5"" pike I got in front of Tall Pines a few years later. I've thankfully caught a number of bigger pike sense then, but never a larger perch.Good luck."
