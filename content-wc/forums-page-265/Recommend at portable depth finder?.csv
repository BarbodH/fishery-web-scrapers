4033313,bkw67,2015-07-09 08:21:00,70,"I saw the amp draw was listed as 1.1 amps as well, but bench testing it showed only a 4ma draw. It ran for 3 straight days (24 hours a day) on the bench with the battery box I mention below. I am taking a small multimeter with me and I am going to 'field test"" it on the lake to get a real-world reading with transducer & GPS running (I know it will be higher, but I bet the 1.1 is a MAX rating). I am expecting around 6ma - 7ma draw average on the water, which if I remember, is what Lowrance told me it runs when I called them a few months ago.

I made some custom mods.. with parts I already had (terminal posts instead of cig lighter jacks). I will probably change it after this trip to Cig lighters as my concern is busting one in transit. (I have extra's, so am going to bring them just in case). FYI, I got the box from Walmart (had to order it online, but they shipped it for free to a local store) and got the batteries at Gander Mtn (had them for only $15 a piece, which is as good, or better than I found online).One major change I made compared to the video was the wiring. I think he made a mistake in how he hooked up the batteries. He has them in parallel.. But if the positive goes out of the first battery to the outputs, the negative should go out of the last battery to the outputs. Like this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kY0FyLhnMQHis both come out of the same battery to the outputs, which is not an efficient way to do it.I'd take pictures of what I did, but I already have it packed as I am leaving in a few days.I'll report back when I return if you can wait that long."

4033625,bkw67,2015-07-09 10:03:00,70,"I agree.. I looked at them and it was my first choice. But I was able to get the Lowrance, with lake maps and a cover for $250 after rebate (which was in my budget).I probably would have gotten the Helix GPS/DI unit if I could have gotten it for the same amount. I was going to get the Helix DI... but the Lowrance got me GPS and Lake maps for the same price."
4034625,Old Timer,2015-07-09 16:33:00,255,"Take a look at the Vexilar LC 10 ""Boundary Waters"" model. They're not made anymore, but I see them for sale on the Internet from time to time. Usually $50-100. I've had one for maybe ten years or more and fully satisfied. For the money the LC 10 is a good tool for a rental boat, a fly-in or a portage boat. I wouldn't use the LC 10 as the primary unit on a main-lake boat, but for the purposes stated above, they're a hard unit to beat."
4064002,bkw67,2015-07-20 20:45:00,70,"Just got back from Ontario... I'll write up a full review soon. I took my little multimeter and monitored the amp draw for 30 minutes with the display on 100%, the GPS & Down-Scan running and logging to the SD card.The amp draw averaged .32 amps in live use. The largest I saw was .36 during startup. Lowest with the above use was .31 amps. I was very impressed of the low amp draw.Hope that helps!"
3970882,deadhead1,2015-06-16 08:04:00,193,I have a Hummingbird 343 which I won in a draw a few years ago. At first I thought I would never use it but now I take it ice fishing and also use it on my second boat. It works great.
3972698,Bad Santa,2015-06-16 18:37:00,100,"I made my 'bird 998 portable by mounting a ram mount w/ the GPS module on a board and the transducer on another 1x2, c-clamped to the transom. The camp I go to has electric start motors, so power is not an issue."
3975138,fish007,2015-06-17 11:38:00,120,The camp I go to has electric start motors also so I rigged up an hds7 with alligator clips and a suction cup on the transducer and it worked great all week. Plus having map gps was a good deal.
4032209,elway12,2015-07-08 19:08:00,335,"I too am looking for a new unit. I don't care if it is ""portable""(I can convert it) but I need GPS on it. And I don't need preloaded maps. Any suggestions between the 3 common brands Humminbird-Garmin-Lowrance? They all have mid-range units($299-499). Any and all help greatly appreciated!"
4032281,bkw67,2015-07-08 19:34:00,70,"I purchased the Lowrance 4 Elite Chirp. It came with With Lake Insight Pro Cartography. I got the suction cup for the transducer and built a battery box with 3 Sealed Lead Acid 8AH batteries in parallel. I mounted the fish finder to a cutting board I got second hand for $2.50. I put blind T bolts in 6 locations to vary the install once I get on the boat. The lake I am going to is not included in the lake maps (as far as I can tell, the lake isn't on any). I will be saving to a 32 gig card and creating a depth chart when I get back (I hope)I'm leaving on my trip next week and will know soon if all goes well, or not."
4032641,sauvain,2015-07-08 21:55:00,63,"I ended up with the HB 899ci hd si unit. I have the floattubefanatic gimble mount, and my transducer on a sully portable transducer mount...sweet set up"

4032993,MrSimon,2015-07-09 06:36:00,922,I tried a few different options and finally settled on an entry level Humminbird unit converted to run off 8 AA batteries. It lasts all week. Here is a video of exactly what I did (I've posted this before).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_nfH9brIu4
4033177,zeebee,2015-07-09 07:58:00,1144,I take a backup unit.....both run on 8 D size. If one goes down Im still good to go. A non operating depth finder would put a big damper on a fly-in.
4033201,Bob_Loblaw,2015-07-09 08:01:00,109,"I use a Lowrance Mark 5x that has a suction cup mount. It can run either off 8 size D batteries or a 12-volt battery, which is what I use. Very lightweight, easily portable, and I just bring my Vexilar charger thingy to charge the 12-volt at the end of each day. I got mine for about $100, but I had some credit on Amazon...can't remember what full price would have been."
3963289,Bassmandpe,2015-06-13 17:38:00,42,"We travel from Florida so it is too far to drag our bass boats. We rent boats from the lodge owner but they don't seem to have good dept finders on them. Got an old Humminbird and an old Garmin but they are ancient, looking to upgrade. What do you think?"
3963921,Bstar,2015-06-13 22:09:00,564,The hummingbird portables are a good finder for the money. Invest in a Sully portable transducer mount so you don't loose the transducer
3963953,adempsey,2015-06-13 22:33:00,963,"Most of the portables won't be anything fancy. If you want a ""good"" unit you will have to make it portable yourself, which isn't difficult at all. Also, those high end units can take a lot of power, which may or may not be an issue for you."
3964025,Bayou,2015-06-14 00:55:00,52,"I just bought the Lowrance elite 4x chirp model from Bass Pro. I believe it was $170 but had a $50 mail in rebate, also another $10 for their sale. So it ended up being $110, then purchased the portable pack from Cabelas for $100. I didt't get the model with down imaging or chart plotter but i'm happy. It was a little more than a basic Humminbird but much nicer. $210 was the final price for everything."
3964289,shortmag,2015-06-14 07:02:00,70,Got the Lowrance Mark-5X portable with a 12 volt and it has been a fine unit. It will run all week if I remember to shut it down at the end of the day. Came with a water resistant case. I had to assemble some of the components but it was simple and it has served for 6 years without a hiccup. Cabela's has them. They provide the basics and as such are an asset on the water.
3964305,retire55,2015-06-14 07:06:00,1029,"The $100 Cabela's portable pak only has a 7 amp hour battery. Lowrance Elite 4x, 5x, 7x and 9x all draw 1.1 amps per hour. With any of those Elite units, your 7 amp hour battery would theoretically last less than 7 hours. Consequently, in my opinion, you would be better served constructing your own sonar carrying case (wooden box with a handle or converting a dry box to a sonar carrying case) and using a bigger (more capacity) battery. As an example, I use a Lowrance HDS-7 (combination colour sonar + GPS unit) and a 51 amp hour battery for week long fishing trips without any requirement to recharge my battery. Alternatively, choose a simple black and white fish finder that requires minimal power. As an example, my back up fish/depth finder is a Lowrance Mark-5x Pro. Its current draw is only 200 milliamps (0.2 amps) per hour. A seven amp hour battery would provide adequate power for 3 + days. Lastly, it really comes down to what you require/desire from a portable fish finder for your trip."
3964513,SinOrSwim,2015-06-14 08:17:00,1528,Any finder can be made portable. I bought a humminbird 595 many years ago and bought the portable bag from humminbird.
3964721,Bayou,2015-06-14 09:29:00,52,I planned on buying an additional battery to charge while we are on the water but was curious if the charger that comes with the 7 amp battery will charge the 12 volt?
3964745,packpro,2015-06-14 09:32:00,695,"I have been using an old Garmin 240. It's black and white so it draws minimal power from the portable 12V battery. Same battery used for ice fishing locators. I recharge the battery every night, and have always had a full day of use. I just cut the cord for the power supply, put and inline fuse on the positive lead. Then I attached alligator clips to the positive and negative leads. Some in our group will attach directly to the boat battery to save the weight of the portable battery. Built the box for portability. 12V sits behind the handle. Whole box has a hard removable cover. You can search the site for other designs. For it's age (15+ years) I get great returns on this unit. It shows individual weed stalks, depth, structure, bottom composition, and water temperature. It comes down to returns vs. power consumption. This old unit balances those demands very well."
3964921,sauvain,2015-06-14 10:13:00,63,I took my HB 899ci hd si and bought a portable set up from fishfindermounts.com will power with a deep cycle battery...great set up.
