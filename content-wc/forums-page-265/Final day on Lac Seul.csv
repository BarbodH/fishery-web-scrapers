I wanted to be upbeat and exciting but I just cant help but feel like it will be the last trip with all of my fishing family. I had a great time with my Dad and Uncle and especially with my son Caleb, especially watching him out-fish us. I was a very proud Dad, son, and nephew. I wish that I could spend all my time with them, but, mostly my son. I looked back through the pics and videos of the brief years of fishing with him and watched him grow so fast. I hope that this is just the beginning of long lasting memories of being out on the water with him. I hope you enjoy the video.https://youtu.be/yZh3tbRCsYY"

I really liked the very ending......I bet you would have wanted that last ride in to be in slow motion to enjoy it as long as possible with your family. Your son really caught some nice Snakes. I bet he was jazzed!!!! Thanks for sharing your trip with all of us. PjShorthorn
