4066234,Fishin Fun,2015-07-21 14:56:00,218,My father left us suddenly too. I couldn't go back to Gullrock for about 4 years after he passed. Too many great memories that were hard to deal with. But I got enough courage to go back and was blessed with some of the best fishing that year that I've ever had. I guess it was his way of keeping me hooked and doing what we loved to do together. Have not missed a year in Canada since. Sorry to hear about Frank. Here's to Frank.
4066258,JayM5209,2015-07-21 15:06:00,1050,"Ziggyzag, don't know if you and your dad ever jigged for lake trout, but next week my son and I will be doing lots of it on Cliff Lake. We'll definitely get at least one for Frank, and will name the appropriate spot and post a pic.You and your family are in our thoughts through this time."
4067402,Thumpr50,2015-07-21 21:35:00,139,"heading to Lac Seul next week, will make it a point to jig one in honor of Frank. You and your family are in our thoughts and prayers."

4064794,pjshorthorn,2015-07-21 06:41:00,5654,"We will do our best to "" jig up "" a beauty for your Dad next week on Eagle Lake. I'm hopeful that we can post a picture or two so you can share it with him and let him know it is in his honor as a great fisherman. PjShorthorn"
4064922,ziggyzag,2015-07-21 07:42:00,125,"Thanks looking forward to the pics. Have a great time on Eagle, I am sure you will."
4065018,wallydave,2015-07-21 08:14:00,2151,"Sorry to read about your Dad. Take the time you have left with your Dad. Thank him, tell him your feelings! When your family gathers, tell a story or two about his life. My prayers are with you and your family. My next trip Ill jig a couple up for you and your Dad."
4065074,ziggyzag,2015-07-21 08:36:00,125,"Thanks Walleyedave: Do me a favor and find a new spot and name it ""Franks Spot"" I am sure he would appreciate it. I am sure you would have enjoyed spending a day jig fishing with my Dad."
4065226,wallydave,2015-07-21 09:24:00,2151,Ill be fishing a new to me section of Lac Seul! The biggest walleye spot will be Franks spot!
4065370,ziggyzag,2015-07-21 09:57:00,125,"Walleyedave: Just told my Dad about you naming a spot for him You made his day! To all you walleye guys if you could do the same and name a spot on your favorite Lake after my Dad ""Frank"" and let him know the lake name it would definitely make his last days enjoyable to hear and read about. Thanks to all in advance our family appreciate all the kind words and actions. Just my way of dealing with a bad situation by remembering a great time in all our lives with our Dad."
4065434,tjandy,2015-07-21 10:22:00,107,Sorry to hear. Prayers to you and your family. I'll jig up a few for the both of you in August!!!
4065522,fishron,2015-07-21 10:46:00,317,It will be a couple of months before we hit one of our favorite walleye lakes in southern Ontario. There's a spot we always jigged called the honey hole. From now on it will be Frank's spot. My best to your Dad and your family.
4065762,bigwalleye1,2015-07-21 12:09:00,2632,"Got the perfect spot in mind, and the Lac Seul map will be duly annotated to read : ""Frank's Over 21 club"". Never caught a little one on that spot. Best pure jigging spot I know."
4063522,ziggyzag,2015-07-20 17:22:00,125,"Well just found out my dad has 2-3 weeks left here on earth and as the memories flood back on all the fishing and hunting trips we shared I realized me and my brothers where blessed to fish along side the GREATEST JIG FISHERMAN EVER!! man that guy had the touch. So all you guys headed up to walleye fish jig one up for my old man ""Frank"" I am sure he would appreciate it. Dad's biggest walleye Granite Hill Lodge 30"" 9 LBS."
4063650,Pikeslayer8,2015-07-20 17:54:00,1460,Here's to Frank!
4063698,rnnonmt,2015-07-20 18:04:00,992,Cherish those times. Sounds like a great buddy and father to make all those memories with his kids!
4063938,johnboat,2015-07-20 19:55:00,2014,"""A man who has children never dies""........This was written on my Dad's Memorial pamphlet during his funeral. As much as it hurt to see him go it was good to know he was still going to live in me. My thoughts are with you."
4063962,lassh,2015-07-20 20:19:00,553,Going back north in less than 2 weeks. We'll definitely dedicate some jigging sessions to Frank and to his boys. I am so glad that I got to bring my dad up on several Canadian trips. God bless our dads.
4063970,Mike Borger,2015-07-20 20:23:00,1554,Very sorry to hear. I'll catch a couple for Frank north of White River next week.
4064074,Bill Krejca,2015-07-20 21:05:00,6107,"My dad never really left me. My dad's been gone 15 years, and we still fish together several times a week, during sleep time. A book with some wonderful thoughts is entitled ""The Next Place"", authored by Warren Hanson, who lives in the St.Paul area. It was given to me during that similar trying time. Bill"
4064146,ziggyzag,2015-07-20 21:33:00,125,"Thanks to all! I know over the next, who knows how many years our family will have many fishing spots called ""Franks spot"" On many Ontario shield lakes. So if you see it marked on some remote cabin lake map make sure to fish it. Wit a JIG of course!"
4064194,Mrnovice,2015-07-20 21:49:00,75,"Prayers to your family. My dad past away a week ago Saturday. Many memories of hunting, fishing and camping. We will have those forever as will you."
