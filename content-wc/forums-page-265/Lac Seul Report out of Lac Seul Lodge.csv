4067906,pastorted,2015-07-22 07:41:00,19,"Just got back from our trip (7/11-7/17) to Lac Seul. We have previously fished out of the Ear Falls area down to around the Steamboat narrows and bay several times. This time we stayed at Lac Seul Lodge in Rat Bay and closer to MacKenzie Bay. First a report on LSL. It is a fantastic camp. Great cabins, great people, great boat motors in a spectacularly beautiful part of the lake. We simply could not have been happier with the accommodations - a big improvement over where we have stayed previously. Camp boats had new 60hp Yamaha 4 cycle engines on Lund 17' boats. Dock facilities and Fish house were terrific. Now to our fishing results. We found the fishing to be very difficult and disappointing Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. Water temps around 70, fish were scattered and not where you would expect them for this time of year. Water quality was good. There was a secondary May Fly hatch finishing up that must have had a negative effect on the fishing. Also, it rained hard on us every day but Friday. Most people in the camp reported similar disappointing results. Fishing improved Wednesday through Friday, but still wasn't up to the par we expect for Lac Seul. Perhaps part of that is due to the fact that we have never fished this part of the lake before. We used mostly jigs (chartreuse, pink, orange, & white) with minnows, but had equal results with leeches. Used bottom bouncer and spinners some with fair results. Probably should have been using Lindy rigs to find the fish. Fish were located in 7' to 30' of water. By the way ""moon eye"" jigs seemed to produce the best, but road runners also worked well. In the final count we had lots of little fish, quite a few big fish (both Walleyes and Pike over the slot), but had a tough time finding ""keeper size"" fish."

4068194,btodd,2015-07-22 08:59:00,30,"I was on Abram & Minnitaki most the week with good results. Went to Chamberlain Narrows from Deception Bay on Lac Suel last Tues & Wed and did okay with husky jerks, spinner baits around shorelines and lindy rig with leech in 15-20' for walleye. No wall hangers but quality fish. I felt like I passed a lot of good water on that hour boat ride. Next time I'll start closer to Deception and fish closer waters a bit more!"
4068330,pastorted,2015-07-22 10:02:00,19,"I forgot to add a couple of things. 1. There are some great people on WalleyCentral! ""Bob"" contacted me and offered to give me a bunch of salted minnows. He met us on the way to International Falls to give them to us and made sure we had all the information needed. Great guy and wouldn't let me pay him for them. Thanks Bob. 2. The line going into Canada was a little longer than normal but still took only about 20 minutes. They asked the normal questions and about eggs. We were prepared so no trouble. 3. The line coming back into the states at IFalls, was the shortest I have ever experienced. Essentially no wait at all. We crossed the border about 11:30 AM Saturday morning. That was a pleasent surprise."

Biggest was 28"". Caught crazy amount over 24""+. We fished Broad Lake once. Sand Banks once. South Inlet twice. Manitoba Point once. We had great luck with leeches and crawlers. Not many Northern this year. Made reservations for next year. Did I mention that it is a Great Camp......"
