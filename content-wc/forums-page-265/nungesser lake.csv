3848705,jdahl625,2015-05-07 13:47:00,6,"Anyone heading up to Nungesser this year? Just got word that the ice left a few days ago. Counting the days until I leave, I will be there June 12-19."
3850809,larry0418,2015-05-08 06:31:00,16,"We are heading up 5/29. Never been there - staying at Anglers Kingdom. I got grounded for 2 days 2 years ago with a fly-in and decided to find a remote place like Nungesser that is driven to for the most past. Last year we tried Vista Lake Outfitters, but that really was disappointing, so Nungesser here we come. I'm sure Kevin Keary will help us, but any additional info be greatly appreciated. Thanks"

4065570,tjandy,2015-07-21 11:02:00,107,How was Angler's Kingdom this year?
4066418,Golden Eagle,2015-07-21 15:52:00,2642,"I heard from one of my fishing friends that he arrived at AK July 7 with his wife and they will be leaving August 1. Will return on August 15, with his brother, for a 2 week stay at AK. Thinking he likes the lake and the camp. Friend mentioned that fishing has been so so and walleyes are arriving at mid season humps, which should stabilize fishing and increase catching. He's boating a lot of walleyes, but not doing great with pike. Got a 29"" walleye and several around 25"". Numbers are improving by the day."
4068066,tjandy,2015-07-22 08:20:00,107,"Thank you. I spoke with Kevin yesterday and he said the same thing. Eyes just got on their summer humps. Nothing huge yet. Wonder why this year is different? Was ice out late? Has it been cold up there? We aren't going to make it up there this year, going to Lake of the Woods. Nungesser is my favorite though, been up there a dozen time or so."
1807530,walleye88ia,2013-05-25 19:55:00,35,has anyone been to nungesser lake this year? hows the fishing?
1812290,clearis,2013-05-27 20:07:00,47,"I'd also like to know of any significant changes on Nungesser this year. Was up there last year and caught fewer than in prior years, but those caught were good size. It is one of the best walleye lakes I've ever fished."
1813346,Ralfeee,2013-05-28 08:08:00,33,"I am heading up in a couple of weeks. What lodge are you staying at? We are staying and Nungesser Lake Lodge and I have been watching their facebook page and it appears the ice was going out on May 18th, but not all of the lake. There are not many reports yet, but it sounds like they are catching fish."
1824417,jdahl625,2013-05-31 09:13:00,6,Any word on the water levels? I will be up there the June 16th-23rd staying at Anglers Kingdom. Late ice should make for good fishing this year maybe even the shiners will be spawning.
1859769,jdahl625,2013-06-12 12:09:00,6,Any last words of advice?? Hoping to find the big pike this year!!
1859809,camp chef,2013-06-12 12:17:00,915,Listen to what Kevin tells you and you will do well. It is a great lake. Have fun.
1905850,jdahl625,2013-06-28 12:42:00,6,Got back last weekend from our trip to Nungesser. Fishing was decent around 100 fish per day with a some being slower then others. Shiners spawned while we were there and the mayflies started to hatch later in the week. Our group did manage a few nice walleyes (around 26 and 27 inches) and 2 fat pike (45 and 46 inch). Hope to make it up there again.
1992857,tjandy,2013-07-30 11:36:00,107,Headed up in a week and a half. Looking forward to another year of incredible fishing.
1993921,gypsy,2013-07-30 18:37:00,10,Will be at Anglers Kingdom and Nungesser for the first time Aug.10-17. Really looking forward to this trip. It is my brothers first trip to Canada. Gypsy
2004153,tjandy,2013-08-04 06:55:00,107,See ya up there. We are getting there on the 9 th.
