Being that we were inexperienced on LOTW, we didn't do as well as we had hoped. Also the MAYFLIES joined up with us that week. That said, we had a great time. The lodge was great(a little worn), the hosts Todd, Kim and their children plus all their employees were very helpful. The location of the Island lodge is wonderful. From that point on the map you can go anywhere to find fish. Hopefully same time next year."
