Fishing is poor and you will have multiple canoers joining you on the river. Don't forget the cost of the train, plus we waited over 7 hours alongside the tracks one year... Many, many better options out there."
3493850,Arayfog,2015-01-30 10:00:00,1,Can You tell me how your trip to shooting star was? Anyone else have any experience with them? I am looking at them for a fall fishing bear hunting trip. Thanks

3505626,chris.brock,2015-02-03 17:05:00,112,This unique place has been on my radar for quite a while. I would be interested in hearing more about your trip Tooski The main thing that deterred us from going was that there isn't a lot of water to fish.
4065874,Guest,2015-07-21 12:58:00,0,"got back from shooting star camp last week with wife. Who has never done anything like this. Think city girl. Train dropped us off next to creek. Shane was there with boat to take us/gear down creek to lake where cabin was. Even tho it was remote, had fridge, stove, furnace, firepit, smoker, grill. dock with boat, and portage above rapids with more boats. So plenty of fishing places. Cabin also had HOT shower that wife used twice. He has also just added lights inside that are solar panel charged for nite use instead of lanterns. Altho we pretty much went to bed at dark and woke up when sun came up. Fishing. i would rate it very good. caught several walleye over 20"" and numerous ones 14/20"". several slimy pike along with several bite-off's, and feisty smallies. even an 18"" sucker one morning. Shane took us around below/above rapids showing us good fishing spots. We had lake/river to ourselves so you know its not overfished. 2 canoe parties went thru in week we were there. one upstream, one downstream. they didn't fish our area at all. Just moving thru. If you can bounce jig, or cast a lure, you will catch fish. Black bear hunting. Talk to Shane. they are around. he saw one on RR tracks that week, and he had one hanging around one of his 7 cabins. we also saw rabbits and grouse with chicks numerous times at camp and chipmonk would take peanuts out of our hands. also Loon on lake with chick. eagles all over place to enjoy also. Not sure about the negative comments on this thread. not sure how you could even use $300 worth gas unless you poured it in lake. shane called us before boarding train and was there to meet us at stop. if you waited 7 hrs you either got off at wrong place or you were waiting on train to be picked up. if its late, thats out of camp's control. The only better fishing i have ever had was when road stopped at lake and i canoed 3 lakes in and set up tent. then every walleye was over 20"" that week. take along plenty of tackle. you will get snagged on rocks and bit off by pike if you aren't using steel leaders. Talking to another party on way home, and they caught pike that had clamped on the head of jig and would not let go. NOT hooked. they had to pry his mouth off the jig head to get him loose. crazy fish. in summary we had great time, caught fish, went swimming, sat around campfire, played cards and got some R and R that we all need. went antiquing in Michigan on way home so that was plus. Shane has owned camps for 30+ yrs so i think he knows what he is doing. Said its been 20+ yrs since he has set up at sport/boat/travel show anywhere, so that is indication of his repeat business. will try to monitor posts here and answer anyone's questions."

537679,winkdink,2004-02-24 11:07:00,13,"I am going July 04 for the first time here. I did my homework and have talked to several people via the telephone and have gotten nothing but good reports. I have been told the walleye were plentiful, the water and surrounding area very clean,and very few people(i was told mostly canoeists..and they don't fish very hard).It is the smallmouth that made me change my usual lodge, I have been going to a 17 mile long lake in quebec for the past 12 years and the walleye were huge and plentiful but not a bass for 200 miles and I missed them very much. Good luck and Godspeed. Vince W. in New Jersey[email protected]"
537710,Guest,2004-02-25 18:58:00,0,Thanks for the info. We will be up there the middle of June. Chad
537712,GregN,2004-02-25 19:45:00,2,"Chad - just wondering. Are you staying on a lake outpost or on the Spanish River. What species of fish are you targetting on your trip? Thanks, Greg"
537733,winkdink,2004-02-26 12:25:00,13,"I am staying on the River as it is the best option for Walleye and also the best option for mixed bag(I fish mostly for walleye but enjoy whatever is on the end of the line).There is also two portage lakes within ten minutes of my cabin one is pike and bass the other is just bass.One thing that I have learned is the bigger the body of water , the better it is.While it may be more difficult to locate fish on a bigger body it offers a better feeding and growing opportunity.Plus it weeds out the weaker fisherman(by weaker I mean the one who does not really know how to use a fish finder,identify structure and fish deeper water.I don't know how many people i have seen trolling a shallow running rapala over 60 feet of water with no sunken island or hump or whatever under them and then complain the lake has no fish or they just are not biting).If you are not sure of how to fish up there then the smaller lakes are for you, but like I said the big schools of walleye and big walleye themselves are much more likely in the river than a six acre lake. Good Luck & Godspeed Vince W in New Jersey"
537738,Guest,2004-02-26 13:40:00,0,"Pretty much like winkdink. We will have two cabins for the six of us on the river. The cabins are next to each other, but away from the crowd. I liked the option of fishng the river in front of camp or portages allowing access to other lakes. Here is the link: www.shootingstarcamp.com Chad"
537969,michric,2004-03-07 06:54:00,46,"Chad, this may not be close to your area but last year we went to Biscotasi which is on the Spanish river the second week of June. We caught the peak of black fly season. Annoying but not that bad. During the day on sunny days we found walleyes at the edge of rocks in 8-14 FOW where it dropped off into basin areas. We caught the most pitching jigs and twister tails along this edge. We spent some time trolling crawler harnesses in the same area and got some fish but were snagged quite a bit. On cloudy days the fish were up shallower in the bays and could be caught trolling shallow-running crankbaits or casting jigs and twister tails. In the evening any bay that had some muck and weeds in the back end held fish. This was by far the most consistent fishing. Some of the bays were quite small but still held decent amounts of fish. We did not go far from the camp for evening fishing because of the numerous rocks. Pike seemed plentiful in the areas we fished for walleyes. The camp owner told us that in July the weed growth tops out in the shallows and more and bigger pike could be caught then."
