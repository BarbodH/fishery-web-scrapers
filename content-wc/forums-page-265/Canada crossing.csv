4063386,5 of Diamonds,2015-07-20 16:19:00,151,"U.S. citizens 21 years of age and older returning to the U.S. should figure about $1.25 USD for every case of beer OVER your allowance and $2.50 USD for every bottle of booze OVER your allowance. Pretty simple. These figures vary by a few cents however these are simple, reliable estimates. I paid duty entering the U.S. last Mon 06 Jul. Duty is not a big deal. They never seem to be concerned about wine. BOTTOM LINE...Don't bull**** the U.S. Customs Agents. Declare your exact haul and hope they tell you 'Welcome Home and Travel Safe'. If not, be prepared to pay a little. Travel safe!"
4063954,Gregking,2015-07-20 20:07:00,2658,"We are going into Canada with beer, will not be bringing any home I suspect. I don't BS the agents, I will declare what we have. I have not ever had a need to declare more than our free limit though. I have nothing to hide, was just wondering what I was getting into. Boarder police are just doing their job and I don't want to make it hard for them or me."
4065026,Bakefish,2015-07-21 08:16:00,1077,"We take over our allotment every year and declare it. After duty the price comes out to about the same you would pay if you were buying in Canada. If you are not fussy about your brand, then just buy it in Canada, but if you want to bring in a particular brand then just declare and pay the duty. Once you tell the border guard that you're over, it seems like all conversation stops and you are given a slip and told to go inside and pay. I've found that it actually makes crossing a breeze. Once while I was pulled over and my buddy was inside paying, a guard came over to search the truck and I told him I was parked to pay duty. He nodded and walked away."
4065778,KoolBlue,2015-07-21 12:13:00,23,Just did it a month ago and it was cake. Had a list pre written of all the stuff we had and handed it to him. Our agent was nice event though we were waaay over and said have a nice day and let us through. My cousin on the other hand tried to take a quicker line and simply had to run inside and pay the duty. Don't really save much on beer by doing it other than if you don't want to make a stop for beer. Liquor on the other hand I save a lot. Captain Morgan is crazy expensive up there and I can take admiral and save about 30-40 bucks a half gallon. Last I saw a liter of captain was nearly 50 bucks in Maniwaki.
4060866,Gregking,2015-07-19 19:48:00,2658,"What's the rule on beer as far as bringing more over than allowed? Example is if two adults are going over we get two cases, what do we have to do to bring two more cases over? I think we pay a tax but can we do it right there at the toll or do we have to stop, get out and go inside?"
4060882,dstar49,2015-07-19 19:55:00,33,they will ask you how much alcohol you have tell them 4 cases they will tell you to pull over go inside and pay the duty. it doesn't take very long to do
4060890,Golden Eagle,2015-07-19 19:56:00,2642,"You go inside and it's pretty quick. Do it on the Canadian side of border. You'd like me as a fishing partner these days because I go in with a full box and leave behind 16 or 17 at the end of a week. Haven't been cheated over the long haul, but that's it for me these days, as I'm fine tuned and don't want to do today what might take away from tomorrow's performance."
4060970,Gregking,2015-07-19 20:27:00,2658,Anyone know what the tax is on say 1 case of beer?
4061170,packpro,2015-07-19 22:50:00,695,I never have been able to figure it out. Varies with every trip. This year it was just over $9.00 case for our group. Still less than buying it up there.
4061185,btmbncr,2015-07-20 00:27:00,492,The last two trips to Canada two of use had an extra two cases of beer.We declared it and they just passed us through.We didn't have to pay the extra duty.Bill
4061514,law57,2015-07-20 06:49:00,1147,"Only once have I been made to pay the duty on extra beer. My guess is that's over 100 trips. Now I only take a case - and bring most of that home with me. As I get older, beer is less important to me than sleep"
4062538,Bigstorm,2015-07-20 11:05:00,799,"We prefer to take our 1 case with, then buy the rest once we cross. I'm OK with it costing more up there, besides, the Canadian beers taste better up there than when I buy them locally."
4063090,fishinnut 3446,2015-07-20 14:25:00,638,And if you get Labatt's black ice you don't have to drink as much and if you do your in trouble in the morning
4063194,pjshorthorn,2015-07-20 14:56:00,5654,I drank one of those one time and called no mas. That is potent stuff PjShorthorn
