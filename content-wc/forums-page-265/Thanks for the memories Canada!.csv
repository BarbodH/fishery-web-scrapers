4059818,Black98TransAM,2015-07-19 09:51:00,794,Have to work a little on the music selection but nice fish
4059994,new hips,2015-07-19 11:06:00,498,Great fish.........that day will hard to top......
4060082,Mrnovice,2015-07-19 12:06:00,75,"LOL! Background music from the kid's phone on the boat. Somehow they like the music over the loons in the lake and the wind whistling through the trees. Kind of ironic, the name of the song as he was reeling it in was ""Breakaway"". Not something you want to hear as you are bringing in a good one"
4060130,Limeyangler,2015-07-19 12:32:00,563,"Thats is awesome .BIG walleye for sure, they don't get much bigger .congrats!"
4057586,Mrnovice,2015-07-18 08:14:00,75,"Just a dad trying to instill the great outdoors into my boys. I've been taking them fishing to Canada since they were 5. We may not always catch the monsters or the numbers but always have a good time. The stars must have been aligned this trip as we caught 4 walleyes over 30"" in 1 day, the biggest being 31.5"" in the video below. Please excuse the chaos and amateur video taking! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVxpLqZU_kE"

4057770,rnnonmt,2015-07-18 09:20:00,992,Nice Job guys!!!
4058226,Rich B,2015-07-18 13:10:00,1081,"Great memory to have on video for your family.....tell your boy he always has to give proper credit to the ""Canadian Guide"" that put him on that beautiful fish.....looks like your other son handled the ""net"" duties OK (well, at least he didn't knock off his brother's trophy walleye with the net while he was being given proper netting instructions)......father & son(s) fishing trips are to be treasured. Oh Canada..... Congrats ! Rich B"
4058434,Golden Eagle,2015-07-18 14:24:00,2642,"Way to go, but it seems your walleyes are beginning to outgrow your net."
