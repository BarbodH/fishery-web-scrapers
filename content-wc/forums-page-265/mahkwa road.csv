3991434,Guest,2015-06-23 08:25:00,0,Thanks for the info. I am used to traveling the washboard road from Hudson to Mahkwa back in the days so may end up going this route.
3991458,IronDioPriest,2015-06-23 08:34:00,96,"There are stretches of the detour that are as bad as the worst of what you remember. Nothing worse than that. Now, keep in mind, I traveled up on 6/12 and returned on 6/17. It's possible that rain since then has changed things. But if you remember the old road, you know what to prepare for."
3992338,NLpike,2015-06-23 12:18:00,28,"The Deer/Lynx detour is much shorter and preferable if it's not a mud pot. From what many people have written, it sounds like they have greatly improved it (graded and graveled) since May 29 when we took it. At that time, the only way to make it through was with 4X4 and in low many stretches. I have been driving that road before it was paved, before it was graded; when there were ruts and boulders in middle of it that could punch holes in your oil pan. It was never as bad as what we saw in May."
4012898,Timing,2015-06-30 18:00:00,95,Any update? Has anyone drove both options and have an opinion?
4013002,Bluebomber,2015-06-30 18:20:00,29,Yup went up last wed on the Dryden route rough most the way. Hudson on the way out on Sunday rough but a lot less miles of rough road. Thanks for the directions guys took a screen shot and no problem finding it
4052666,marine_man,2015-07-16 11:32:00,16,Just got back... the road to Mahkwa is open again - no more detour. marine_man
4056650,Timing,2015-07-17 16:51:00,95,Awesome head up in a week!
4062018,CamoHunter,2015-07-20 08:56:00,363,Also just got back. Same comment as marine_man. The road is fixed and you can drive the normal route straight into camp again. Good luck! Fishing was awesome!
3956793,Bluebomber,2015-06-11 12:34:00,29,Thanks for the info guys! Like the vid. Heading up on the 24th can't wait! Any fishing reports? Only get 3 days to fish so any info is much appreciated!
3957033,Pooch,2015-06-11 13:40:00,4619,"Thanks for the time to make a video of the road. What would you guess the drive time from Dryden to Mahkwa with a boat? I'm hoping the bridge is in when we head up the end of August, but the alternate route would be a nice change of pace is we aren't in a hurry.Can a person download your You Tube video and carry it with us in the truck? That would be great.Part of the diversion looks like the old road before it was upgraded several years ago. The fishing is still worth the longer trip.All of us owe you a beer or two or three. Good job on Mahkwa's part.Again, thanks to you and Mahkwa.Pooch"

3976826,IronDioPriest,2015-06-18 00:33:00,96,"We used the Deer Road/Lynx Road detour out of Hudson. 4 vehicles and three big glass boats, on the way in and on the way out. It was rough, but passable. You just have to take your time. It takes about 40 minutes to cover that short stretch, but being able to fly on the high quality road the rest of the way is worth it.Almost the entire distance from Hudson to Mahkwa used to be just as rough as this as recently as 3 or 4 years ago. I was hesitant to take the detour because of some of the comments I saw here and elsewhere, but we decided to go this route and it was just like old times. I can see where someone who's never experienced the way it used to be might get freaked out by how rough the road is, but if you take your time you'll be fine. You don't need a four wheel drive as some have said. You just need to go slow when you need to go slow, and be smart about when you accellerate.If you've been going to Mahkwa for more than a couple years, then you know exactly what this detour is like. Use it - or don't - at your own discretion."
3991210,Guest,2015-06-23 07:39:00,0,How many miles is that detour between Hudson and Mahkwa? Thanks for your help! I am heading up tomorrow with a crew. I appreciate the info you have provided!
3991346,IronDioPriest,2015-06-23 08:01:00,96,"Forgive me if I'm wrong. I wasn't the lead vehicle, so I wasn't paying close attention. But I believe the detour was about 7 miles. 40 minutes to cover 7 miles. The benefit being that you get to drive on the nice newer road for the entire rest of the journey from Hudson. I would definitely recommend at least traveling in pairs. And we usually have walkie-talkies so the lead vehicle can warn of obstacles/oncoming vehicles. That's the way we always used to do it when the whole road from Hudson was crap like the detour is now. It's very rough, but passable. Just plan on max speeds of 15-20MPH with most of the way slow-rolling under 5 MPH, and you'll be fine."
3953993,172EYES,2015-06-10 13:23:00,22,I just tried to do the aerial map search on the route and noticed that several of the distances were incorrect (if I am looking at the correct turns). I am going to try to post a map of the turns as I have them figured.
3955249,Pooch,2015-06-11 05:44:00,4619,"How did you folks get out? What route or roads?I was trying to follow the directions given above on Google Earth, but kept getting lost after the road names stopped showing up.Thanks,Pooch"
3955513,rlchapel,2015-06-11 07:28:00,7,"What Mahkwa expects of their customers, is to follow their written directions on how to get there and reverse it when they leave. They said no one has ever had a problem before, that they know of. We tried that when we left in the dark at 4:00 A.M. and got lost. Someone came by and we waved him down and explained our problem. Luckily he was going to Sioux Lookout and said we could follow him. He took us through the most horrendous roads you could imagine. Thank God our car had all-wheel drive. If we were towing a boat, it would have been a disaster.Before I left for Canada, I tried to create a map following their directions. I couldn't do it. I wasn't able to find anything that showed all the roads. On the trip in, the intersection of the roads are marked when you get to them with street signs, so you have to watch very closely for those signs. Then you have to watch for their yellow ribbons they tied onto bushes and hope they haven't fallen off. Crude is a good word to explain how they did it.The road turns into gravel very shortly after you leave Dryden and a boat can be towed, as the road isn't as bad as I expected. Though, there is one area shortly before the lodge that is quite rough and you'll have to slow down. If I go next year, I pray the bridge has been built as that is the plan now."
3955785,172EYES,2015-06-11 08:27:00,22,Someone let me know if this is correct. Hopefully the link works:http://binged.it/1Gh7pQh
3955865,rlchapel,2015-06-11 08:41:00,7,The map turned out really nice. I was able to pan around and zoom in and out. Did you use Google earth?
3955873,172EYES,2015-06-11 08:46:00,22,It was Bing maps. I just need to know if it is correct or not!
3956025,rlchapel,2015-06-11 09:36:00,7,"I'm not familiar with Bing Maps. What's the secret to printing out the map? Each time I enlarge it so I'm able to see the roads and I get the ""Print Preview"", it's not the area of the map I'm looking to print, but I print it anyway and its not what I wanted. Plus, it's considerably smaller than I'd like. Obviously, I'm not doing something right. I'd like to print it out so I can analyze it from the route we took last week."
3956353,tv4fish,2015-06-11 10:49:00,2694,"Don't mean to hi-jack the thread - BUT, anyone else question why the entirety of Lac Seul is called Englishman River on that Bing map?????"

3937401,Swanee,2015-06-04 20:20:00,16,just informed the road to mahkwa has a washout any info about the road
3938049,Pooch,2015-06-05 06:52:00,4619,"A essential and well traveled road, so I can't imagine it being closed for more than a few hour or a day. Call the camp if you are headed that way soon.Pooch"
3939065,172EYES,2015-06-05 12:15:00,22,Called up there today. They said they are working on the bridge for at least another 4 weeks until July. They mentioned that there is a 10-12 km detour that gets you there on a gravel road. Didn't sound like a huge deal.
3946617,NLpike,2015-06-08 12:28:00,28,"We just came from there. The main road will take months to fix. Given thier track record, it could be a year. The Deer Road and Lynx road detours are very difficult, only 4WD will make it. There is an alternative route on a logging road that will get you there with many bumps and dents, but it's safe. That alternative route goes out of Dryden and dumps you directly at Adventures/Mahkwa. It will take you 2 hours if you are pulling a boat. Do not use the detour from Hudson. That is very dangerous and if it rains, you will have serious problems. We broke a bracket bolt on our trailer pulling our boat that way. If we had known about the Dryden detour, we would have definitely done that instead."

3953441,rlchapel,2015-06-10 09:41:00,7,"I just returned from Mahkwa Lodge. They said the road will be out for another 4-8 weeks, as they are going to build a new bridge in the spot where the road washed out."
3953473,rlchapel,2015-06-10 09:50:00,7,I just returned from Mahkwa (June 6) and they said it will be 4-8 weeks before the road can be used again. They are going to build a bridge in the spot where the road is washed out. Guess this isn't the first time this has happened.
3953657,rlchapel,2015-06-10 10:50:00,7,"I used the Dryden route. As long as you watch for the road signs, you should be able to make it through with no problem. Some of the the distances they have listed in km are not accurate, so watch for the R.R. tracks and road signs. The last turn to your left is not mentioned in their instructions, but it's close to Mahkwa and their sign is at the corner to point you in the right direction. As you get closer to the lodge, they have yellow ribbons tied to bushes and signs, as long as they don't fall off.......... and you continue see them, you're safe. You can trailer your boat but, the vast majority of the road is decent gravel. There is one area close to Mahkwa that's quite rough and you'll have to slow down. I wish they gave a map, as trying to follow their instructions is a little concerning. Pay attention to all the turns etc.. on the way up, as the route back, you can't see any signs. We had to leave very early in the morning and it was dark. We got lost on our way out, luckily a guy came along and we followed him to Sioux Lookout on Lynx Road. Try NOT to take that road!"
3953761,JDP,2015-06-10 11:24:00,1457,Thanks Very Much rlchapel!Valuable information for those of us going to Mahkwa Lodge.
