4037361,octanehi5,2015-07-11 07:34:00,1104,"The weather is still below normal,cold water temps means, Summer has not shown its face up north and an early winter, Days are allready getting shorter, This should increase the fall bite. Good luck up there"
4061042,MyDinghy,2015-07-19 21:00:00,11,"I can't believe our trip to Lake Herbert has come and gone already. In talking to the 3 others in our group, we all agreed that the lake lived up to its reputation. The road to Clova was in very good shape, we made great time on it and we arrived an hour early. We checked in with the outfitter and after 10-15 minutes of small talk, we found our stuff weighed, loaded in the plane and we were on our way.Our flight was smoother than expected as the winds were whipping at a good rate. We caught a decent amount of fish despite tough fishing conditions. The winds blew out of every direction from day to day. Sometimes they changed multiple times within the same day....lol. To make fishing a bit more challenging, we had to deal with a cold front that hit early in the week and really shut down the bite. We didn't let the tough conditions get us down, we fished through it and managed to boat some really nice fish. Our biggest fish for the week was 28"" and had quite a bit over the slot size that had to go back. The fishery seems to be very healthy....as there are a lot of sore-lipped 10-14 inchers that are recuperating and will right sized for next years season.It helped that the equipment and accommodations were top notch and much better than anticipated. The care-taker was also very helpful and quite entertaining as well.All in all, it was a great trip and appears that we will be going back."
4061210,fishron,2015-07-20 04:09:00,317,"Thanks for the report. I'm glad your trip was a success. The weather up there can really be a surprise. You leave the 80's and 90's at home and drive into a different season. Usually if it's not too severe, it's makes the fishing better. Hebert is a productive lake with good accommodations and that usually goes a long way to smoothing out the weather."
4061346,octanehi5,2015-07-20 05:59:00,1104,Its always good to hear you had a successful trip.Hebert has always lived up to my expectations.Air Tamarac's Equiptment always performs. The lake is a Walleye factory. I have seen more big fish caught this yr than any other of my 12 yrs. on this lake.Now we have 11months to plan the next one. Fishron we will see you the last week in june 2016
4063738,MyDinghy,2015-07-20 18:21:00,11,"My only complaint would be that I have to wait 340 days until we can go back....lol. With our first year under our belts we learned a lot about the lake. We tried to fish a new section of the lake each day to learn the lake. I am sure we have plenty more to learn too. We concentrated our fishing efforts from the main island to the big island just north of 5 islands most days. We really did not spend any time at the south end of the lake and only were at the far north end once. Honestly, I don't think we had to travel that far to find fish and there were a few spots we probably could have camped on all day and increased our fish count.....but I think part of the fun is exploring to see what the lake has to offer....members of our group may disagree....lol. After a dozen years of doing these types of trips.....realized we can always improve on a few things too. We were way over packed. In fairness to us though, we weren't sure what to expect so we packed heavy. I think I can scale back on rods, tackle, and food.....Daniel told us.....""you have tooo much sheeeetttt!!!!"" Also, thanks to all that sent info to us about the lake."
4064634,octanehi5,2015-07-21 06:09:00,1104,"Its a very hard task to make 110lbs per person weight limit,I think in all my yrs. going we made weight once. You can make it if you eat saltine crackers and fish. We enjoy two nights of Ribeyes,One night of homemade pasta sauce,Bugers,hotdogs,french toast, pancakes,brats, bacon, with many fishfries. Being Italian Alot of food is a must, Wine ,beer and whiskey also on the list. We pay whatever the overage is. Exploring the lake is always a great way to learn about the lake. after 12 yrs. on the lake I still find new structure that I mark with a GPS. We troll to the spots we are headed to its a big lake.the fishfinder lets you know were the fish are. Once you find most of the hot spots,You can catch fish all day no matter which way the wind blows.I always develop a tear in my eye when It comes time to leave One of the best Walleye fishing Lakes In Quebec. Only 330days to go"
4019658,Freytown,2015-07-03 11:57:00,770,"I agree that a mouth full of bladder = dead eye. Most active fish in June are shallow...you guys caught a 1,000 of em...right. Why fish that deep....jmho. To each his own I guess. FT"
4019714,Freytown,2015-07-03 12:29:00,770,I started a thread in Strictly Fishing
4019802,fishron,2015-07-03 14:03:00,317,Piercing the bladder to allow a fish to return to deep water is a common method used in salt and fresh water. If the fish bladder is not capable of functioning or repairing itself the fish would pop back to the surface as the body cavity filled with air. I'm not a biologist but that's my understanding of the process. My group also caught some fairly deep walleye. We fished a similar area and in the strong wind that day it was very easy to start in 15 feet and in less than a minute drop off to 45+. The abnormal thing was that usually the bite disappears when you leave the active feeding zone. I've never seen a situation when the whole water column was producing fish as it was that day. None of our fish showed any bladder problems but the amazing thing to me was the variety of depths that were producing fish. The deep fish were a surprise as we stated to motor back to more common fishing depths.
4019874,phishfearme,2015-07-03 15:11:00,1242,"""You are on a need to know basis, and do not need to know."" does your outfitter know?"

4022322,octanehi5,2015-07-05 06:46:00,1104,"The mayfly bite was incredible, Walleye were jumping out of the water after them. it would have been a good time to try a fly rod.The waters were the coldest I have ever encountered, with fish stacked top to bottom, most fish caught were in 22 to 24'. Paddletails worked well in the rock piles of 8' and less During the day if there was a good chop, at dark it did not matter they jumped out of the water after the lures. On a good night we would drift fish from 12'to as much as 60' ,Big drop off near seagull Island, you can catch fish there any time of the day. As usuall Wind direction and cold fronts dictated were you were going to catch fish. We had a few days the wind direction changed 5 times. Our worst weather was on Tuesday wind blowing at 35 mph driving the rain sideways 5 to 6' rollers, The biggest fish of the trip were boated that day, Fishron crew had the same luck that day. we all boated some very nice fish. It was the kind of day that put the best rain gear to the test, Frog togs Failed big time, Best performing rain gear was the gear woren by the guys on deadlyest catch, rubber bibs and double snap jackets.I was dry as toast all day. well worth the price. We caught walleye's in size from 4"" to 30"", showing the the future of this lake is intact, a real walleye factory. So another Yr is in the books 2016 is on deposit, Fishing with old and new friends Priceless Octanehi5 AKA Walleye Ron"
4022738,fishron,2015-07-05 09:42:00,317,"That's a good summation of the trip Ron. My rain gear failed but the bite made me oblivious to being soaked. I've never seen the wind do a 180 like it did in front of chlorox. One drift was one way, the next was the opposite. As I mentioned before, I've never seen pike sipping mayflies as they emerged. Sounds like the mayfly hatch was pretty common across Ontario and Quebec that week. In some cases it makes the fishing more difficult but that wasn't the case on Hebert."
4034897,MyDinghy,2015-07-09 19:43:00,11,"Leaving tomorrow for our first trip to Herbert. Everyone is very excited. I have fished many times in the Gouin, but never fished Herbert. Has anyone been on the road to Parent recently? I was to the Gouin June 18-23 and the road was the best I ever saw. We made it to Parent in 2 hours."
4035353,octanehi5,2015-07-10 06:37:00,1104,"Good Luck up there, the road is not in the same shape as it was it will be a 3 1/2 hr trip on the road to clova. Please report when you get back"
4017146,fishron,2015-07-02 10:00:00,317,"Air Tamarac has exclusive rights on Hebert. They monitor numbers caught and numbers kept. They have set a slot of four walleye 16 to 20 inches to the inside of the fork. Essentially a 21 inch fish. For pike it's up to 28 inches. The gators go back in. (after a photo). You might catch a ling, a sucker, or a gull, your choice."
4017434,vteye,2015-07-02 12:08:00,812,I presume you can keep a couple fish under the slot to eat?
4017658,octanehi5,2015-07-02 13:32:00,1104,"The slot to keep fish (walleye is from 14 to 20"" writen on the measuring tape side of the boat, pike Ron is correct at 28""for pike 4 fish(walleye or pike may be kept until consumed) you may take 4 of each home. Not the quebec limit of 8 walleye and 10 pike The slot limit as well as the take home #s are impossed by Air Tam. This was my 12th yr. on the lake,over the yrs. I have watched and enjoyed the average size of fish increice over the yrs. It works"
4017722,fishron,2015-07-02 14:12:00,317,"Sorry, I tried to correct the slot post but it didn't go through. Ron, (octanehi5) is correct. The rules are working, and Hebert has a healthy population of robust walleye."
4018050,octanehi5,2015-07-02 16:28:00,1104,Most of the time we do not take anything under 17 it takes to many fish to make a good fry for 10 guys
4018794,hunts2long,2015-07-03 06:04:00,115,Nice picture Ron. You look like a KID with his first fish....h2l
4018818,phishfearme,2015-07-03 06:25:00,1242,"how do you know it survived?? just because a fish swims off does not mean it will make it. I really doubt that a walleye yanked out of that deep water and having the bladder ballooning out of the mouth will make it. I asked MNR biologists about pulling lakers out of deep water (in the summer) and the response was in essence that ""it's not that good for them so keep them"". maybe walleye are different but I doubt it. I guess the main question is though - why would you fish that deep anyway?? phish"
4019226,octanehi5,2015-07-03 08:57:00,1104,"I fished that area for hrs did not see any dead fish, I'm not going to tell you how I do it because you do not fish that deep. I fish that deep because they are there, In a fishery that has over a million walleye in it, I really do not think my fishing deep effects the lake, If we impail a fish so it will not survive we eat it. If you spend the $ and fish were you want its up to you. I for one do not tell guys were to fish or how deep Its the differance in catching fish or not.If the fish did die it made great Pike food, there are pike in the lake that exseed 50"" A 25 "" walleye is just a snack This yr was my 12th yr on this lake we practice catch & release on over the slot limit fish, I have watched the average size of fish grow over the yrs. In no way after a guy has spent over 1200 US to take this trip am I going to tell you or anyone else not to fish deep. My 13th yr is allready Booked. I hope this answered your ? Octanehi5"
4019586,phishfearme,2015-07-03 11:09:00,1242,"hmmm - a secret method!! you don't mean ""fizzing"" by any chance?? (fizzing = ""impale"" the bladder with a needle, press the sides of the fish and let the gas out which produces bubbles that fizz). the theory = without ""fizzing"" the fish will not be able to swim down and re-compress the bladder so let the air out at the surface and the fish can go down. here's a thought - after being ""fizzed"" and the fish goes back to depth, where does the remaining air in the swim bladder go? the water depth continues to force air out the fizz hole and the fish continue to sink struggling to exhaustion to control his depth. you won't see this fish you killed because it's lying on the bottom. please tell me I'm wrong phish"

4013722,Bayou,2015-06-30 22:56:00,52,"Not to hijack but I Haven't left for either of my two trip this year and am already looking at places for next year and was curious of Herbert. Would Herbert be a good place to take a 8 and 11 year old plus the the better half. The cabins look nice but would like to get them numbers over size. It will be their 2nd trip if things go right this year. Was also looking at MLO but trying to eep costs reasonable, thanks."
4013858,NY Walleye,2015-07-01 05:16:00,78,"I brought my son who was 7 and 8 years old the past two years. Lots of numbers to keep,him happy. Great boats, very comfortable cabins that are big. Lake can get a little ruff, but you can hide and still catch fish. I asked my son if he would like to go to disney or Hebert. He picked Hebert. Great place!"
4013898,fishron,2015-07-01 05:28:00,317,I believe Hebert would be a good trip for a family if certain things are accepted before you go. The wife and kids have to accept the outhouse experience. The six cabins on the island are much less buggy than a cabin set in the bush. There are two caretakers on the island that service the boats and maintain the outhouses. The setting is protected and attractive and the cabins are well maintained. Any first timer would be wise to take a guide early on. Daniel is a guide that is very familiar with the lake and will put you on fish. Mickael is a young helper who has been there the last two years and backs up Daniel with the service on the Island. He is very familiar with the southern part of the lake and fishes every chance he gets. This year he also played his guitar and sang in some of his off time. Keep in mind that if an accident were to occur the help is provided by a helicopter service that is included in the price. Pack a few puzzles and games for rainy days unless your nuts like us that fish all the harder in lousy conditions. Good Luck.
4013970,octanehi5,2015-07-01 05:59:00,1104,"I agree with Fishron about Hebert, a stay on the island would be good for the family, Another option is to fly in to Charlotte 3 mile lake only one cabin lots of fish The lake does not get as ruff as hebert I also believe air Tam offers a great family price. My Dinghy, you and your dad will have a great time,Hebert will live up to its reputation, Ask Daniel to show you were to fish have him show the sandbar behind the island,clorox bottle island , seagull island. Have a good trip"
4014042,octanehi5,2015-07-01 06:48:00,1104,nice fish
4014218,Freytown,2015-07-01 07:40:00,770,Thxs for sharing Ron....nice eye.
4015362,Freytown,2015-07-01 16:07:00,770,"Ron, second look at your fish, it seems that the bladder is popping out, how deep was the water? Did it survive?"
4016474,octanehi5,2015-07-02 06:03:00,1104,"That walleye came out of 46' of water, Yes its alive I make sure they are. the deepest walleye I took was in 62' We caught about 20 fish over the slot, All were treated like trophies revived and turned loose"
4016698,fishron,2015-07-02 07:11:00,317,It was unusual to catch walleye so deep.(45+ feet). It had to be very cold down there. The fish were in the whole water column. I had a couple crush my paddletail in four feet of water. I snagged an unusual baitfish bringing up my jig. It was a troutperch. A standalone species that competes with young walleye that max's out at about eight inches. I've seen them in other northern Canadian lakes and some of the clouds of baitfish I saw on Hebert were probably troutperch.
4017082,vteye,2015-07-02 09:36:00,812,Often considered Hebert as I have heard good things aside from posts. What is the slot limit on the lake?
4004674,fishron,2015-06-28 05:21:00,317,"Just returned from Hebert. Air Tamarac is first class all the way.It's our second year and the lake treated us well. Despite the weather being all over the place and only a five day trip, the four of us caught 530 walleye and numerous pike. Two of the days, my buddy and I concentrated on pike, and our best walleye day was in high winds and rain with three fish coming on almost every short drift.We traded walleye feasts with Octanehi5's group and had a great time eating walleye and trading stories.I've included a few photo's of some of our fish prior to release.Good fishing to all!"
4004858,NY Walleye,2015-06-28 07:08:00,78,"Fishron, Really nice report. I have fished lac Hebert with Tamarac the past three years. Any insight on where you caught the eyes an pike. I have always found the eyes but have ha trouble finding pike the last couple of years. Thanks for the report."
4005554,retire55,2015-06-28 12:15:00,1029,Thanks for the report. Glad to read that your group did well fishing. Some nice sized walleye in those pics.
4005610,fishron,2015-06-28 12:48:00,317,Hi Retire 55. Met you on the lake last year. Hope you've had some good fishing this year. NY walleye. Last year the pike were somewhat of a mystery to us. The obvious north bay area was productive. This year we fished any rock bed we could find. Around small islands or shoals. The firetiger hollowbelly paddletail was a winner. A large single hook is much easier to remove. Saw a first for me. On one shoal numerous pike were visibly sipping emerging mayflies from the surface. Had to coax them over to something larger.
4009026,octanehi5,2015-06-29 17:29:00,1104,"As Fishron said a great time was had by all, We got back at 330 am this morning, Weather on the cool side , the one day of rain and wind produced the biggest fish. My group enjoyed catching Walleye from 30"" at 11lbs, from a first timer, from 27"",26"",25"" 24s"" 23s""22""s21s""s Plus the rest of the gambit, 1105 Walleye's and 120 Pike biggest being 40"", Food and company was great,all equipment worked very well. Air Tamarac lived up to its reputation,as one of the best outfitters in Quebec. The deposit has bin made for 2016.Pm me if interested We may have both camps in the north end of the lake.
