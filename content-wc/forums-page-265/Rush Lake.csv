A few Perch and Whitefish. There are 2 portage lakes to the north, Lasacur (sp?) and McOwen. We had found smallmouth and pike in Mcowen and walleye and pike in Lasacur. Smallmouth and walleye supposedly stocked in those two, respectively. As time went by, we started catching walleye in both Rush and Little Rush. It got better every year it seemed. They either migrated down into Rush or we got to be better walleye fishermen! Two hotspots are the hump at the entrance to Rush River and Mallard Bay. But you can get into them all over in the usual walleye structure. I always will have a soft spot for Rush. Very pretty lake, good cabin, and my first Canadian fishing trip. The only downfall (if you can call it that) is there is road access at the south end. Its a hike, but people do regularly travel in there to camp.A fellow member on here Labsrus, is an Ivanhoe regular. I believe he has been to Rush a lot. Might want to message him if he doesn't see this."
