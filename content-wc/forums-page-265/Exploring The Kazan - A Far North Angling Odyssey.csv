4061586,Mike Borger,2015-07-20 07:07:00,1554,"Guys I truly thank you for the kind words! It's really gratifying to know you enjoy the stories.Yes, I just got back from Medhurst late last night although it wasn't a family trip. I hosted the man who's publishing my magazine as well as his two boys. As usual my boy Brendan fished with me and put on a pretty good clinic. Report will be done quickly, but fwiw I was pleasantly shocked how good Medhurst was for walleye, plus the camp itself is very nice!Large family trip is later this week to Shekak Lake with White River Air. A HUGE bunch of us head north for a week leaving Saturday morning early...ALL pm's answered! Cheers"
4061986,Golden Eagle,2015-07-20 08:43:00,2642,"You're beginning to intimidate me with your expertise in writing, photographing and fish catching. And you showcase a new, fresh, younger Borger who out fishes just about everybody I know. How do you explain that? I'm looking forward to hearing about your next venture and the one after that and..................................... Thanks for what you bring to WC. .................................................. ........ The Old Angler, rounding third and heading for second."
4062282,Mike Borger,2015-07-20 09:59:00,1554,"Thanks Connie, that's very kind.As far as Brendan goes he has a good teacher, but beyond that he's got this fire in his belly that just comes natural. It amazes even myself."
4045745,HeHooksHimself,2015-07-14 07:03:00,725,Brendan has my vote! It would be great to keep it in the family.
4046505,vteye,2015-07-14 09:45:00,812,"Whoa, great report, love the giant brookies - lakers.. Lakers come in so many color variations fantastic photos. I truly look forward to your reports and like many others hope you strike it rich and willing to adopt a lot of 53 year olds..."
4046729,rsiminski,2015-07-14 10:34:00,53,"Mike, I absolutly love reading your trip reports and look over past trips on a weekly basis. You are living the life we all dream about. I think its time for you to start looking into buying an outpost camp!"
4047458,pike50plus,2015-07-14 14:23:00,584,Greta trip may have to go there in 2016!
4051346,itsme,2015-07-15 20:45:00,31,I didn't want to bother all the other readers about how I started fishing in Canada.. So I sent a PM Let me know if you can read it. Keep up the fishing news... will look forward to your report after the 7/25 trip.
4053994,itsme,2015-07-16 20:40:00,31,Hi Mike Sent you an PM so far no reply???
4054442,pjshorthorn,2015-07-17 04:58:00,5654,"Well Mike, I finally had some quiet time early yesterday morning to read your article. As always, you have written a piece that makes the reader feel as if they are on the adventure themselves. It surely was an adventure and I commend you for making a trip of this kind with your son. I also really enjoyed the parts when you got out to pull the boat to get to those spots that may just be the ""Golden Ticket"" and to just explore. Your son's supportive comments brought back some memories from trips with my own son. That what trips are supposed to be....a great adventure. Sometimes we just never know what will present itself, at any given time, and make it the adventure of a lifetime. The pictures of your son conked out in the bow of the boat made me smile. It brought back memories of my son who did the same thing whether it be an 85 mile trip out in the Gulf of Mexico fishing for blackfin tuna or a long run back to camp on Lac Seul. I have some really special pictures of him taking a few "" power naps"" in the boat that make me smile everytime I run across them in the old albums. I call that ' a really good sleep""....doing something so fun it just wears you out !!!!!Taking a young person fishing is such an honor to have them WANT YOU to take them..... I can't think of many more things that special and that will leave a lasting memory.Nicely done,PjShorthorn"
4055946,uv2021,2015-07-17 11:47:00,48,I also really enjoy the trip reports.And you are one incredibly experienced person.But I get butterfly's in my stomach just looking at the pictures of your son standing on the bow bow of a boat holding a big pike .....with no life jacket. When my kids were young I was occasionally guilty of the same thing.Fortunately nothing bad ever happened. So get him a really nice comfortable one with lot's of cool pockets that he can wear all the time. 36 days until Kellow lake!!!!
4055978,Pikeslayer8,2015-07-17 11:56:00,1460,Isn't he in Medhurst this week with his entire family?
4056274,Golden Eagle,2015-07-17 13:43:00,2642,"Mike is a pretty busy guy and receives lots of email and PM. I suggest you wait until he shows up on the forum and then send the PM, again. Don't want your message to be overlooked."
4040121,Mike Borger,2015-07-12 12:33:00,1554,"Well it's done, what a marathon! I started writing Saturday morning at 6am and just finished an hour ago, no sleep and only coffee, Red Bull and junk food to keep me going.At 3am last night I took a break on my back deck and smoked a cigar, but beyond that it's been a grind.I have a timeline and needed to get it done, and like I tell my kids sometimes you have to do whatever it takes to get stuff done. Needless to say I'm quite pleased with this story and I hope you are too, it's a truly epic tale in my estimation.If you're interested in reading it don't sit down unless you have a couple of hours to kill. There's 27 embedded video clips as well as a scary amount of photos to go along with the writing.Hope you enjoy! http://www.canadafishingguide.net/ex...gling-odyssey/"
4040177,Rich B,2015-07-12 13:24:00,1081,"Mike, Another outstanding trip report. Your son is a blessed young man, to accompany his Dad on some of your fishing expeditions. Enjoyed reading your comments and viewed a few of the video - will watch the rest later, though wanted to say how much I enjoyed the photos and write-up of your trip (the quality of your photos and video is excellent). Looked like a perfect trip.....(other than the bugs, but what can you do ? ha). Rich B"
4040937,Kwags,2015-07-12 18:43:00,48,"That was great I have quit trying to catalog the places you go, Mike, thinking I will follow you and catch the same (or similar) amount and quality of fish. It's finally now enough to watch the videos and read the reports! Brendan has caught more fish and larger fish in his lifetime than I have I'm certain (and I'm a lifetime 53 year old fisherman). Thank you for your reports and good luck on the next adventure Pikes layer and I would love for you to visit lake wabakimi. We need some new spots!"
4040969,itsme,2015-07-12 18:49:00,31,"I really enjoyed all of the writings,photo's and video's. Makes me wish I was 45 not 85 I am sure the two sons will remember forever. I still recall my first trip fishing. All the way to Wisconsin, Mirrow Lake not far from the Dells. I was 12 and caught a huge rock bass and my Mom cooked it for my breakfast. I am headed to Ontario in three weeks. Each year I am not too sure of the next."
4041473,Mike Borger,2015-07-13 03:52:00,1554,"Thank you. And you're right my son is very lucky. Right now he doesn't realize quite how much, but he will one day.

4042009,HeHooksHimself,2015-07-13 07:45:00,725,"Man, That is a huge bunch of fish. Brendan is a lucky man! By the way, I am available for adoption. I am only 63 and have a job so other than that gray haired guy on your couch you would hardly notice me. Let me know when we can begin the process! By the way dad-to-be, when is the next family trip? Fish On! Hooks"
4042025,Mike Borger,2015-07-13 07:50:00,1554,LOL!Next family trip leaves July 25 for Shekak Lake with White River Air. Bringing the entire clan along on that one including the dog.If we can get the paperwork expedited you're welcome to join.
4042785,HeHooksHimself,2015-07-13 11:25:00,725,"Don't tease me Mike, my wife is totally on board with the adoption! Have a great trip. Fish On! Hooks"
4045049,Pikeslayer8,2015-07-13 21:18:00,1460,"Probably gonna work out with the Hooks adoption. Only problem I see is if Hooks gets the top bunk and starts snoring. Brendan might just backhand him. Have ya seen the biceps on that kid. His hard assed dad has him on this massive fish regime hauling in multiple lunker trophies of all species all day and parts of the night. Did ya see where he makes Brendan sleep in the boat. Brutal! Seriously though, have ya ever seen a kid so blessed. He has caught more trophies in a couple weeks than most of us combined, in our lifetimes. In this spirit, I would like to nominate Brendan Borger for ""Walleye Central Young Angler of the Year"". Should be worth an ESPY!"
4045177,Mike Borger,2015-07-13 21:53:00,1554,Bren will get a kick out of this post when I show him.
