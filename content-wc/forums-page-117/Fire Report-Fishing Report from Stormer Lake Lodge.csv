Stormer Lake Lodge is located approx 45-50 miles North of Red Lake on Nungesser Rd. There are two monster forest fires in our area and our lodge is directly in the middle of both of them. They have been identified as RED039 and RED040 on the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) forest fires website. Here is a link to the website: https://www.ontario.ca/page/forest-fires. These fires started on June 30 and are now finally getting under control. We were never in imminent danger at Stormer Lake Lodge but had very thick smoke for a short period of time. As of this writing, all smoke is gone and the fires are now being managed by ground crew instead of helicopters and water bombers. It is actually a beautiful day to fish at Stormer Lake Lodge with clear skies and perfect temps. We want to thank all of the MNR firefighters that kept us informed on the fires and for the water prevention system that was temporarily installed at our lodge. We also want to offer our best wishes to the other lodges that were effected by the fires, specifically the lodges on Nungesser Lake and Roderick Lake. Now, on to a more fun topic and that is a fishing report from the season so far at Stormer Lake Lodge. The season started out with great fishing but not in our usual locations. Most of our fishermen like to go over to Kirkness Lake (directly connected to Stormer Lake via easily navigated channel) believing that there previous fishing haunts will always produce. As it turned out, Stormer Lake was not red hot but white hot. You could be fishing within eyesight of the lodge and be catching 100 Walleyes a day. This pattern kept going for the better part of 3-4 weeks. One major factor for keeping the great Walleye bite going on Stormer Lake was the slow drawn out spawning of our many game and bait fish in our lake system and specifically on Stormer Lake. Silver Shiners spawned slightly later than normal, as did Perch, Bass and all of our other many species of minnows. There was no doubt a long buffet cycle of forage for Walleye and Pike to eat on Stormer Lake Lodge. As the waters started to warm up and the bait fish started to spread out to normal lake locations, Kirkness Lake started to kick in with good numbers of fish on weedlines and sand bays. Weeds and sand structure were a phenomenal pattern right through June and in to early July. The Mayfly hatch started in mid June and continued through early July and kept Walleyes shallow and easy to pick off along most bays with sand bottom or along the reeds on shore lines. It is now mid July and the Mayflies are gone and the Walleyes are now on weedlines, sand bays AND rock structure. This is a fun time to fish because all of our favorite spots to fish around the lake are active. Or in other words, you can catch fish almost anywhere. As an example, I was out fishing last evening with our long time staff members and good friends, Kenny & Dawn, and we caught over 100 Walleyes on both rock reefs and weedlines and this was all in about 2 hours time. In regards to Pike fishing, there was no slow down or strange patterns for the most part throughout the season so far. They have been active right from the start and are still biting aggressively. Our typical lures such as Mepps #3, 4 & 5 are always going to catch a lot of fish. Rattle Traps in Blue/Silver and Perch colors are some of my favorites and Johnson Silver Minnows and Cleo Spoons are great on sunny days. We have had a few Pike over 40 inches and many in the 32-38 inch Range. This is a brief post about Stormer Lake Lodge and the interesting summer season so far. We will try to post more fishing updates as the summer goes on. We have to admit that posting fishing reports sometimes get redundant: Drop line, catch fish, re-bait, repeat. You will do this about 100-150 times a day. Life is good when you are fishing at Stormer Lake Lodge. Regards, Dave & Linda Becker Stormer Lake Lodge"
