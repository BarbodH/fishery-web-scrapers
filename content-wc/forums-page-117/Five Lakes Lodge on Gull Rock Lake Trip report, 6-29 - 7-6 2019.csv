6338900,PhilTickelson,2019-07-08 22:13:00,84,"Hello everybody, I'm back to write up another report from Five Lakes Lodge on Gull Rock Lake! I don't post on here a lot, but I wrote up a big report last year and had a good time writing it. I normally wouldn't spend the time, but we have such a great time up there and Ian and Drew are such great hosts that I like to make sure people hear about it! Lead-up to a long awaited Departure This story starts about a month ago, when I bought a new-to-me boat from a friend of mine. We were fortunate enough to grab a 2005 Ranger Reata 1850VS that was in great shape, apart from the trailer brakes needing to get checked out. Well, that little job turned into quite an ordeal, and while we bought the boat in May, we were down to the wire on getting it fixed in time for our trip. We left for Canada Saturday the 29th, and the trailer was finally fixed that Tuesday, only a few days to spare! It turns out it needed a whole new coupler, but the Tie Down model we have isn't made anymore, so Ranger had to build one and overnight it to us. *Phew*. Stress levels were high leading up to the trip, we had a big birthday party for our 3 year old the weekend before and we just didn't have a lot of time to prep. In addition, we were in limbo on whether we would be able to take the boat up or not. At the end of the day, this wasn't a terribly huge deal as Ian at FLL has some of the nicest rental boats I've ever used. I was still shopping/scrambling around on Friday before we headed down to Red Wing to drop off the kids with our in-laws. On the way back from Red Wing, about 15 minutes from our home in the NE suburbs of St. Paul, we had what I can only describe as catastrophic transmission failure in our 2014 outback...while going 70mph on the freeway. We heard a huge *CLUNK*, the car lurched and bounced violently, and we lost all power to the wheels. We were able to pull over and get to the shoulder, but after putting the vehicle in park, it still wanted to roll forward. This is about 7:30PM on the night before we leave for our trip. Ugh. side-note: My mechanic called me while we were up there and asked, ""Did you slam this thing in park while on the freeway? You are completely missing an axle, and the other one is completely twisted"". Long story short, needs two new CV shafts, front differential and transmission. Subaru released an extended warranty and we are crossing our fingers that it is covered :/. Side-note part deux: if anyone is looking for a recommendation for a nice AWD vehicle that needs new headlights every 4-6 months, which more or less require you to remove the front tires to change, AND has the possibility of more or less shifting itself into park at high speeds, boy do I have the car for you! After about a 2 hour delay to get a tow and find a ride home, we were finally able to get our shopping and packing done and got to bed at the ripe old time of 1AM. Needless to say, our plan to leave at 5AM wasn't looking so great. We accepted our fate, cursed the ancient gods of australia for the state of our Outback, and went to bed. Coming up next, would this dynamic duo make it up to Canada unscathed? Or would we see yet another problem with the boat/trailer/truck on the way up? The stakes are high as there isn't a working vehicle to come home to! Stay tuned!"
6338902,PhilTickelson,2019-07-08 22:19:00,84,"Sorry to disappoint you folks, but we had a perfectly enjoyable, eventless drive up. My wife drove the truck from our house to the border, we had some Hardee's at I-Falls, and breezed through customs. 502 had a few culverts that were rough, so we learned to slow down a bit before those, and towards the end of 502 it was all gravel. Apart from that, no complaints! The truck got about 13.3 mpg, and we made it up there more or less on one tank of gas. We did see two moose just south of camp, and a babyish black bear a bit south of Dryden. We arrived at camp around 7PM, Ian met us immediately and I believe his first words were, ""You didn't tell me you bought a Ranger."" . We got everything unpacked, launched the boat and got about an hour of fishing in. We stayed close to camp and caught a couple fish. But were looking forward to our first full day of fishing. I asked Ian how the fishing has been and he said it's been really hot, no wind, and we just had a mayfly hatch. Coming up next, would this terrific twosome find fish under these brutal, harsh, basically impossible conditions?! Or would they catch as many fish as they do when they fish around home, which is...not a substantial amount. It's really not a quantity that's worth mentioning publicly, we should probably talk about something else."
6338904,PhilTickelson,2019-07-08 22:37:00,84,"Based on our results last year, we already had a fairly good game plan going into the week, or at least that's what I told myself as I lay awake at night, dreaming of the days ahead. 1.) We would get up early, fish walleye at The Gull Rock to try and get a big one(a very large off-shore reefish type thing on the north end of the lake). 2) Troll for pike during the day, as we had some great luck on the last day doing this. I bought a bunch of new baits and more dedicated trolling rods. 3.) find some nice evening spots to fish walleye again. As the saying goes, the best laid plans completely suck, so why even plan anything out at all you big dumb idiot. Alright, our plans weren't total garbage, but it was clear on day one that this wasn't going to be the same as last year. We woke up around 6:45, ate breakfast and were fishing on the gull rock by about 8 AM. We had good, steady fishing until about 10:30. We had our fish in the livewell for dinner, and I caught a 21.5"" and a 25"" walleye. Our biggest last year was 24.5"", so we already beat our biggest from the year before, a good sign! Last year, we mainly caught fish in the 18-22 foot range, which I'd say are really on the pretty steep breakline of this structure. This morning however, we caught most of our fish on top, in 13-16 FOW. Hmmmm, very interesting. I placed this nugget of information in the corner of my brain I call the, ""recite this information to sound like I know what I'm talking about in fishing conversations"" part. We mainly drifted and slow-trolled Lindy's and spinner rigs. My wife likes fishing that way and so do I, but we just didn't have as much luck vertical jigging this trip, so that was our go-to technique. It also helped us cover some water over the course of the week. We got our trolling gear out and tried for some big northern. Last year we caught 6 over 32"" on the last day, while doing some haphazard trolling. This year I was prepared though. I had all the gear, the lures, the rods, the physique, everything. It .... didn't work out. No northern for us this day. We at lunch in the boat, fished a few other spots for walleye in the afternoon and evening, catching a few just about any place we tried, but nothing big. We went in for dinner and fried up some fresh fish. If you remember my post from last year, you will remember that my fish cleaning skills were admittedly sub-optimal. I am happy to report this year that on day one, I was consistent with past experiences. We scraped enough off for a meal and were happy as clams. In the evening we went out around camp and caught a couple, but didn't fish too hard. As is the norm, Ian asked us how fishing was and how we did. I reached into the recesses of the ""recite this information to sound like I know what I'm talking about in fishing conversations"" and said we caught a lot of fish at The Gull Rock but not out deep, on top in shallow water. I could tell by Ian's reaction that this was indeed a golden nugget of information that he was storing for future conversations of his own. Weather: Hot, sunny, not very windy I don't think. I didn't take good notes on the weather for the week because it was basically warm all week, and sunny most days. We didn't get rained on a single day, which is pretty weird. Up next: Would we get up early for another day of fishing at the gull rock, or would they succumb to the siren song of ""No kids, sleep in for once you idiots!!"""
6338906,PhilTickelson,2019-07-08 22:49:00,84,"In what will go down as one of the most shocking moments of my lifetime, I snoozed the alarm about 5 times and we didn't get out fishing until about 8:30 AM. This my friends, was an absolute shocker. It only took us 2 days to immediately smash the reputation we had built last year. Last year, we were known as 'that couple that woke up early one of the 7 days in camp', so this was a tough blow so early in the week. The night before Ian said that the best groups the previous week fished mega early and came home for a nap. We were putting Ian's wisdom into action with little delay. We decided to try a similar game plan as day 2, except get there later and be lazier, a tried and true method for success. We had good fishing again at the gull rock, our biggest fish were a 21.75"" walleye and a 21"" walleye this morning, so nothing to write home about. After getting more sleep than normal, we decided it was prudent to come home and take a nap. we slept for a couple hours and tried more pike fishing in the afternoon. Again we came up empty handed. Two days in and our plan was ... not working. We found a nice little piece of shoreline near Stephenson's point that evening and caught a fair amount of walleye right before dark. I pulled up a 20"" and caught a few others in the 18-19"" range. I think we fried up more fish for dinner but my notes are incomplete! My fish cleaning was...better than the day before, but still had some room for improvement. We visited with our neighbor a bit the first couple days, it was his first time up here and I was hoping he was having good luck. He was up with his 12 year old son, so he definitely had a bit more to worry about than us, but they seemed to be having good luck, he had even found a killer evening spot where they were catching them one after another. We ended up joining them in this spot later in the week, but I think their best night was like 75 fish in a couple of hours. Weather: hot and sunny. Up next: after a day of recovery, would we take Ian's advice and get after it? I think the answer will surprise you, but you will not know unless you tune in for Day 4."
6339042,Hoosier_25,2019-07-09 11:47:00,9,Great stuff. Looking forward to reading the rest when I log in at work tomorrow!
6339084,sagecreek,2019-07-09 14:23:00,24,"great report, I was there the week before and the fishing was really slow due to the mayfly hatch. \ the fish were not in the spots they are usually and I marked a pile of fish at 25 to 35 feet but they had no intention of biting anything I threw at them, what a bummer. but I did get a few at 5 to 10 feet in the weeds. as usual , I heard the fishing picked up after we had left, I kind of think the fish heard I was coming and decided to hide out of fear of my fishing ability lol glad you had a great time , ian runs a fantastic camp and knows where the fish are and is very helpful"
6339182,PhilTickelson,2019-07-09 21:13:00,84,"As the late, great, Owen Hart once said, ""Enough is enough and it's tiiiiime for a change!"" Wednesday morning we were up early and fishing at the Gull Rock by 6:50! That's AM, just to clarify. The only other boat out there was a nice couple from Iowa from our same camp. On our first drift we caught 4 walleye, nice! We had good action until about 9:00 this morning, getting bites on just about every drift we did. On one specific drift, we drifted over a huge pod of fish. I'm talking like 8 fish on my small little graph at one time, including 2 or 3 LARGE marks. I quickly threw down a waypoint and hit the spot lock on the trolling motor and got out the jigging rods. By the time we spun around and Dr. Spot lock had us in position, it was obvious we were a little off of our mark. I dropped a jig down there anyways. In what can only be described as an absolute eternity, I lost patience and tried to adjust us to get back to our waypoint. Fish can't move far in 30 seconds right? I hopped on the 'bunny button' to get us out there quick and decided it wasn't worth reeling up my jig, remember what I said about laziness? Always pays off. About 3 seconds after we start zooming forwards, my 1/4 ounce jig trolling quickly along, it gets just obliterated. I set the hook and it's all hands on deck to try and land another big northern. This one fights longer than the 35.5"" the day before, and just absolutely did not want anything to do with our sparkly boat. It finally tires out and comes up next to the boat, my wife nets the first half of it and upon liftly slightly it ..... slides into the net. *phew*. This was a bigger fish I could tell, but not sure how big. My PB pike at this point was a 37"" I caught up on LOTW on a tip-up, but this beauty clocked in at an even 38""! A new PB! We fished Gull rock for a little longer, tried trolling for pike with no luck, and then headed back to our favorite spot on Dogshead point. The wind had picked up on Gull Rock and there was starting to be a bit of traffic out there, but our Dogshead spot was just barely out of the wind. We trolled through there and caught quite a few fish, nothing huge, but I managed a 19"" and a 19.5"" before we headed in for lunch. After lunch my wife laid down, but she wasn't going to take a nap, no sir. She made it very clear that she had no desire or intention to nap. I walked out to grab something out of the boat and upon return found her fast asleep. I knew at that moment that if I were to lay down and nap, I would not wake up until the weekend, so I forced myself to drink a couple beers and visit with some other folks at camp, she deserves a nap every now and then right? Once she woke up, we just hung around camp and visited, my memory is a bit hazy, but eventually we decided to run into town for dinner, instead of making something and had some great food at Antonio's, a very good Italian joint in Red Lake. We got back and our neighbor invited us out to his evening spot that he'd been having such great luck in. We fished the last 45 minutes of daylight or so, jigging for walleye/sauger in 7 FOW, catching one after another. A great way to end our day. I tried to impress Ian with our story of a 38"" northern, but it was obvious his level of impressedeness was low, many bigger fish to catch in this lake. UP NEXT: Day 5, it's time to get serious, would we strike gold on our penultimate day on Gull Rock?"
6339186,PhilTickelson,2019-07-09 21:35:00,84,"After having great luck early on Wednesday morning, before we went to bed I gave my wife an impassioned speech on why we have to get up early again the next morning. I don't remember the exact words I used, but it was very impressive, believe me. It was somewhere between Herb Brooks Miracle speech in between periods against the Russians in 1980, and when our president gave the rallying speech before he led a squadron of fighters against the aliens back on July 4th, 1996, saving earth from impending doom. We woke up at a similar time to the day before, and got out on Gull Rock by about 6:45. Again there was just one other boat there, but that quickly changed as there were 5 or 6 boats there by 8 AM. Some were jigging, some trolling bottom bouncers, but we appeared to be the only people drifting. I don't know about you guys, but I very much enjoy a nice drift. Sure, Dr. Spot lock can hold is in one place pretty good, or we can troll through at the exact right speed, but there's just something about a natural drift. While everyone is trolling around the area, we setup drift after drift and connect with fish on just about every pass again. On one particular pass, I hook up with a very nice fish, this one feels a bit different than the other ones I've been catching. After giving some great commentary and insight into what the fish is doing on the other end of the line, such gems as: ""Stayyyying down"" ""it's bigger than the last fish I caught"" and ""I think this one is going to be pretty big, maybe, but it could also not be"" the fish finally shows itself, a nice large walleye! It takes off for a run under the boat but eventually finds it's way into the net. Have you ever noticed how big walleye just look different? Their heads seem almost too big for their bodies or something. Anyways, this one tapes out at 27.5"", as we are taking some quick photos my wife chimes in with, ""It's a beaut Clark"" and we release her to safety of the reefish thing area we are fishing. Not quite my PB, but tied for the 4th biggest walleye I've ever caught, and the biggest fish I've ever caught in Canada. On my very next bite, I set the hook on a very average feeling fish when it all of a sudden feels quite heavier. I'm pretty sure I know what happened, but I get the fish almost up to the boat and see a HUGE northern had T-boned my walleye, this thing is massive. It sees the boat, runs off about 20 yards of line and *tink*, bites me off. Crestfallen, emotional, and moody, I tie on another Lindy and do the only thing any of us could do in that situation. I blame the drag for not being set right, tell my wife how the sun was kind of in my eyes and my flip flops were stuck to my feet. What could have been had all of those completely unavoidable circumstances been in my favor. We catch a few more fish, but by about 9AM this spot has slowed down. We go in for an early lunch and decide to pick up on the hot pike trolling action from previous days. We've set quite a high bar thus far with like zero fish in the boat by means of trolling, but I'm a bit disappointed we haven't explored more, so we vow to explore some new areas to us. We end up trolling most of the afternoon. The boot, burnt island, 5 islands, all over the place. We end up catching probably 4-5 northern, but nothing over 28"" or so. We go in for some dinner, ""ribeye and walleye part II: The Fattening"", and head back out to the evening spot for another hour or so of fast action in shallow water. Before bed we set a plan for our last day. It's going to be an early rise again, but we are hoping my wife finally catches a bigger fish, as they have all seemed to grab on to my line this trip. UP NEXT: The final day, will the better half finally get on the big fish board?"
6339196,PhilTickelson,2019-07-09 22:03:00,84,"We wake up very early on our final day, at least for us. 5:30 AM, granola bar breakfast in the boat, no lunch packed and we hit the water. We get fishing by about 6 AM on the Gull Rock, joined again by our Iowa friends. The wind had been blowing the same direction basically all week, but today it's a bit different, bringing a modicum of haze from the nearby forest fires. We get drifting and before I even have a minnow on my hook, my wife gets a bite. I can tell it's a nice fish because of how it is, and because Katie says, ""this is a nice fish"". After a very respectable tussle, this 'nice fish' slides into the net. We measure it out and it's 24.75"", besting her PB by a robust 1/4"", woohoo! She's excited to finally be on the board AND beat her PB, and I was wondering when it was going to happen on this morning, we had been fishing for a whole 15 seconds already! We get our lines back in the water and I hook up with a couple nice fish, a 19"", 20"" and 20"" one after another. Everything over the slot so far. We continue drifting and it starts to slow down a bit, our friends from camp head out to greener pastures as it looks like this spot is just not holding as many fish this morning. I'm contemplating a move to dogshead point or another part of the reef, when all of a sudden the wind picks up substantially. Not enough to blow us off the lake or anything, but enough to churn up the top of the water a bit. On our next drift, Katie hooks up with another 'Nice fish', and after a truly majestic battle, we net another beaut. This one tapes out at 25.25"", a new PB!! She's all smiles as she's caught two PBs on the same morning and everything just seems good. The wind is blowing pretty good now so we decide to try dogshead, as I think it might be protected a bit again. That turns out to ... not be the case. We try our little point there and catch a couple fish, but it slows down, so I decide to slow troll lindys around the other point and just continue along the shoreline as it's just getting pounded by waves. Maybe that's making something happen ya know? We get out to the shoreline that's getting the brunt of the wave action and Katie gets a nice bite. After getting the fish partway up, it starts taking some pretty big runs. I'm hoping she has a big northern on at this point, as she REALLY wanted to catch some big ones. It is a northern, but not huge, we get it on board and it's a healthy 32"". She holds it up for a picture and it flops just right in her hand and cuts her pinkie, bad. There's quite a bit of blood, she gets the fish in the water, I feint from the multiple milliliters of blood present and then we get her patched up. She's a tough cookie so we keep fishing and don't catch anything else on the next few passes. We move to the other side of the lake to get out of the wind a bit and decide to try a bit more walleye fishing as we still need one more walleye for our take home limit. We decide to fish the heel of the boot, a point we caught some nice fish on last year with a similar wind. We get our bearing and drift/troll around the point, I'm using the trolling motor to just kick us in and out if we get too deep/shallow. I look up and see a beautiful bald eagle watching us from a pine tree overhead and think to myself, this just seems right. A few seconds later as we are just getting around the outside of the point, I get a bite. I set the hook and to no one's surprise, I miss. I reel up to check my minnow. As my hook gets up the surface I lean over to check it out and with the minnow sitting about 3 feet from my face, maybe 4 inches under the water, a large northern slowly glides up, sucks up the minnow and does a quick 180 and swims away. It happened so fast, I the minnow seemed completely engulfed and maybe even swallowed in an instant, where was my hook? As my line tightens I set the hook and this fish just takes off like a bat out of ****. This is a large fish, but I'm convinced that my line is in this fish's mouth and there's no way this fight will last long. But somehow, the line doesn't break right away. Learning from my previous failures, I loosen my drag a bit, position myself with the sun at my back, and slip off my shoes. I settle in for a long fight and it did not disappoint. This fish ran straight out the back, went under the boat, almost got caught in the motor, jumped 3 feet out of the water, trying everything to spit the hook, but it just. stayed. on. After quite awhile it just hung out about 6 feet under the boat. I applied gradual pressure, but not wanting to break my line I had to just lean on it a bit and guide it slowly upwards. It gets a few feet behind the boat and I can tell Katie is nervous about trying to get it in the net, she starts as if to reach for it and I tell her to wait, I think she's about to run. At that instant it takes it's biggest run, a final, desperate bid for freedom. My heart was in my throat, and at this point my right leg is shaking uncontrollably, I need to land this fish, I'm sure it's 40"". It finally glides back next to the boat and we get it into the net. I'm ecstatic and need to sit down. My little octopus is again perfectly situated in the corner of it's mouth, probably the only place it could possibly survive such a fight on my 6 lb mono. We measure, snap a few photos and get her back in the water. 39"" on the button, just shy of the magic 40, but a new PB! I felt bad catching these big pike on such small gear, this one was quite tired. I spent a minute or two holding it upright in the water and she finally kicked off pretty strong, retreating back to the depths. A total trip-maker. We headed in for lunch not long after, got some packing done and visited with other campers. At this point it was extremely hazy/smoky and we honestly were a bit worried about staying another night. Some others left early as the air quality was pretty poor, ash was in the air, etc. We ended up fishing for a couple hours in the late evening and caught fish in every spot we tried, the smoke/ash made it a lot darker out than it normally was at that time, and I think the fish liked it. We came in a bit later than we wanted, loaded the boat on the trailer and did a bit of packing. All in all it was a fantastic day, three personal bests in the boat on one day is tough to argue with. It's always sad packing up after a week of fishing, but we were pretty exhausted, and admittedly missed the kids and our dog quite a bit. We got up at about 7, finished packing and hit the road. Another completely uneventful trip back, we did see two more moose and another bear, and arrived back at our house unscathed. Another great trip in the books at Five Lakes Lodge! We will be back next summer, and if I decide to put in the effort, will probably post another long-winded and probably unnecessary report for you guys to read."
6339200,PhilTickelson,2019-07-09 22:08:00,84,"We had a great trip overall. I think we caught less total fish than last year, but the conditions weren't on our side. It was hot, sunny, and we hit the end of a mayfly hatch, but I have zero complaints with the quality of fishing. This is an absolute gem of a fishery. Next year I'd like to hit Two Island and maybe Keg lake to get a bit more exploring in, as it seemed we kind of got into a rut this year. But any trip where we can catch 4 personal bests is not one you will see me complain about. Five lakes Lodge was again an outstanding camp. Ian just gets people and gets this industry. He truly works his butt off for his guests and it absolutely shows. I will continue to recommend this lodge to anyone that listens . I didn't count our total fish, but it was surely in the hundreds for the week. Biggest pike: 32"", 35.5"", 38"", 39"" Biggest walleye: 25"", 25.5"", 25.5"", 27.5"" We had probably 20 walleye in the 19-25"" range and the one 27.5"". In my mind that's a great week for a team of two. Thanks for reading and if you are looking for a place to go for a canada trip, give Ian a call and try to get on his books, if you can."

6339372,Mojo-NC,2019-07-10 11:16:00,1929,You have quite the entertaining writing style - thanks for sharing. Hopefully we'll be just as successful on our upcoming trip to Canada in September.
6339814,PhilTickelson,2019-07-11 21:57:00,84,"Glad you guys enjoyed the write up! I've only been up there twice so I'm far from an expert, but I'm happy to answer questions about the lake or lodge. I'm sure others will chime in with far more knowledge on the lake system than me, but I can give you my thoughts! I still really feel it's a top tier lake system as far as drive-in lodges are concerned. Couple that with it's ease of navigation(few hazards and most are well marked), and it's great for those of us that aren't....great fishermen. Well that would be a blast! But I doubt you'd learn anything from us, you tipped me off to most of our good spots anyways . Seriously, though, I think that dogshead point area is my favorite on the lake, just a cool little area with a lot of neat structure. Prototypical Canada 'spot' if you ask me ."

6339346,Hoosier_25,2019-07-10 09:59:00,9,Phenomenal report and great pictures. Your writing style made it so easy and fun to follow along. Was hoping the report would never end! Definitely has me salivating for my trip in 3 weeks! Thank you for taking the time to write this all up.
6338908,PhilTickelson,2019-07-08 23:11:00,84,"I type this out knowing that most will not believe what I'm about to say. But I do not care, I speak the truth and this is the actual events of this morning. After multiple failed attempts to get up early our first coupe of days, I managed to squeak out of bed at the butt crack of 7:30 AM. We decided to fish a different spot in the morning, we fished one of the ears of Dogshead point, a favorite of ours from last year. And it turned out to be a great decision! We fished here until about 10AM, and caught fish in two very distinct spots. Out on the edge of the point in 17-19 FOW we caught very nice eater fish, 14-16"", consistently. Once we got in further to about 14 FOW, we caught bigger fish. On the first three passes I caught a 19"", 21"", and a 25.5"". My wife caught a 20"" and a number of the eater sized fish. To this point, the bigger fish still alluded her. We tried trolling for pike again for awhile and our persistence was finally starting to show us that persisting at something completely ineffective can indeed stay ineffective. No fish. We moved north to try Three Sisters, three islands we never got to fish the previous year. At first we tried for northern, but then switched to walleye. We caught a couple off the biggest island in a really snaggy spot, about 16-18FOW, but were fighting the snags. We noticed one of the other camp boats north of us and they seemed to be doing well, fishing the same stretch of water. We didn't want to intrude on them though so we left them alone. Turns out they slammed them up there! On what was going to be our last pass, my lindy rig got snagged up and i quickly ran to the back, jumped on the back casting deck and tried to lift it out of the snag. At first I thought I failed, but then it popped free, phew! not a second later my minnow got absolutely hammered. I set the hook and knew right away this was not a walleye. After a very long fight on 6# test and my medium-light rod, we pulled the 35.5"" northern on board. I'll post pictures later, but there is a great picture of this one in the net with the little red hook nestled perfectly in the corner of it's mouth. This was an absolute beast of a nothern too, very thick, very fat, very fun. This fight had it all, near disaster as the line almost got caught in the motor, a nearly botched net job, gymnastics around the bimini as the fish ran around the boat, it was a real crowd pleaser. We tried fishermen's point, which we also never fished last year and I made the mistake of not trying to map it out on my map chip before fishing. I normally cruise around and mark the 10 ft and 20ft depths with waypoints, this gives me a bit of an idea how everything's laid out. We kind of aimlessly drifted/trolled around and caught a few, but quickly got tired of it. We hit the Gull Rock on the way back, knowing it wasn't going to be as good as in the morning, but we caught a few decent fish in the 16-17"" range, and then hit a couple cool looking island spots on the way back. We marked an absolutely massive fish off of one of the points, but no bites. We cruised back into camp in the early evening, cleaned the one fish we kept for surf n turn, and grilled up some ribeyes. It was a fantastic meal. We only had about an hour of daylight to fish that night so we hit up stoney point close to camp, we could have stayed there and caught all the 10-13"" sauger we wanted, but as it turns out, we didn't want to catch too many 10-13"" sauger. We tried Stephenson's again, and caught a few more there before heading in at dark. We asked our neighbor how they did in the evening, they were up shallow in 7 FOW and totally killed 'em again. Coming up next: Day 5, a milestone moment, and heartbreak. I'm pretty tired though so I will probably type the last couple days up tomorrow night. Until then amigos."
