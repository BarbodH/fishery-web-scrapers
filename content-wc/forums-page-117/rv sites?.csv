6338518,Powder,2019-07-07 20:20:00,38,I've got some friends with campers/ice castles that would like to go to Canada on a short trip. They'd like to use their campers and would probably need to rent a boat/motor. They would prefer to cross at Baudette but maybe would be able to go through Fort Frances.They are mostly looking to fish walleyes. There are several teenage kids that love to fish so they just want action. It doesn't have to be anything fancy. Ideally this would be within 2 hours of the border. None of them have ever done this before.Can anyone help with some places they could look into? I'm thinking a drive to resort with camping.Thanks!
