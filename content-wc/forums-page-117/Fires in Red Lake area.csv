6339422,hoosiercanadian,2019-07-10 13:59:00,104,"In other words , if it was not safe, they would tell you."
6339462,campchick,2019-07-10 16:42:00,96,3 inches of rain between yesterday and this morning for us. Some locations probably had less and some had more. Highways 105 and 17 closed for a short time this morning due to flooding but reopened again. Nice to see blue sky once more.
6339726,Pink Unicorn,2019-07-11 15:11:00,83,"There are still restrictions on McCusker Lake. Fires have been beaten up but are not close to being out. Yesterday my brother in law (Pilot in Red Lake) said ""I think you guys will be able to go out but it's 50/50 on if you'll be able to spend a week or not""."
6339770,RichA$1970,2019-07-11 18:31:00,1159,Just got back from Hornby 100 mi north of Red Lake on Tuesday. Got an extra 1.5 days of fishing as they could not fly in to get us. Fishing was good and it was hazy but still a great time.
6340058,Pink Unicorn,2019-07-12 13:31:00,83,"Sounds great if you had ample food and drink! How was the fishing? I went there last year and had a blast, probably my favorite lake thus far. Couldn't find any trophies though... We caught a 19, 24-26"" eyes but nothing bigger."
6338674,Hoosier_25,2019-07-08 10:54:00,9,When is your trip up there? We are not until August 2nd but still nervous. Will you be planning an alternate trip? Trying to decide at what point we should start looking at other camps.
6338680,Pink Unicorn,2019-07-08 11:09:00,83,"Great resource, thanks for sharing! Check out Ventusky.com for live global weather info and predictions. Pretty cool as well"
6338682,Pink Unicorn,2019-07-08 11:14:00,83,"I have 18 going up July 25 to a fly in that is not on fire but surrounded, so I spent the entire day yesterday looking for alternatives. Sydney Lake Lodge has availability but we can't go because of no flush toilets (some of the lady folk aren't into outhouses). Looked like a nice last minute alternative. Found a few others as well. PM me if you need more info."
6338694,trapsht,2019-07-08 11:52:00,28,"We are supposed to leave this Friday. I'm looking for alternatives, but I think its going to be tough since its last minute. I'm with 2 young kids and my wife so I have to be careful with lodging."
6338696,Hoosier_25,2019-07-08 12:08:00,9,Nungesser Lake Lodge just posted a video on their Facebook page of rain falling. Looks like plenty more to come over the next couple days. Hoping for the best!
6338698,campchick,2019-07-08 12:14:00,96,"Yup, it is raining heavy right now with more rain expected in the next couple of days. You'll be able to get to your original lake so no more worries. Have a great trip!"
6338734,Golden Eagle,2019-07-08 13:47:00,2642,Thanks for the good news. Don't stay gone so long this time.
6338740,ManitowishWaters,2019-07-08 14:16:00,39,"Love the optimism, but Red lake 39 is a beast of a fire. Hoping for the best!"
6339352,ManitowishWaters,2019-07-10 10:05:00,39,Any news after the rain?
6339358,trapsht,2019-07-10 10:23:00,28,"I just received a call from Stormer Lake Lodge. They said we are clear to come up. Evidently, the heavy rains contained the fire and they are contained. I'm not sure how I feel about driving my family up on Nungesser Rd however. He said the smoke is gone today. I've never been to Stormer so I hope the owner is being sincere and not just trying to help his business."
6338470,phishfearme,2019-07-07 15:19:00,1242,we were at north caribou lake - the walleye seem to always be turned on there. the biggest issue for us was getting a plane in to take us out. heavy smoke seriously restricts VFR planes. we were lucky - our outfitter found a gap. phish
6338474,ManitowishWaters,2019-07-07 15:32:00,39,I was one of them...Thank u for taking my call while headed out this am!
6338482,Pink Unicorn,2019-07-07 15:39:00,83,Where did you come out of?
6338488,Pink Unicorn,2019-07-07 16:32:00,83,I am looking for a new place just in case and just got off the phone with this guy. He doesn't have availability the week we're going (18 people = not much felxibility) but has some nice looking cabins and water...http://discoverylake.com/fishing.html
6338590,ljcs789,2019-07-08 07:00:00,42,We are booked for the 19th at Orono Lake with Viking Outposts. Just talked to them this morning and guys are stuck at that ouptost since Friday due to fires. They are having trouble getting guys out at other outposts too.
6338608,SterlingArcher,2019-07-08 07:58:00,92,Yikes I hope they are able to get everyone to safety. I also hope this doesn't cause us trouble flying into Savant Lake on Saturday!
6338636,Hoosier_25,2019-07-08 08:59:00,9,Looks like quite a bit of rain in the forecast for the Red Lake area this week. Hope for some non-windy storms...
6338638,flntknp17,2019-07-08 09:01:00,151,"Fished Lac Seul last week and the smoke was pretty intense Thursday-Saturday. Had visibility under 200 yards at times Friday morning. First noticed it in the Manitou Creek area on Wednesday. As was noted above, the walleye fishing was absolutely ridiculous all day while the smoke was heavy......seems like they just kept feeding shallow even in mid afternoon. Matt"
6338642,ChuckD,2019-07-08 09:11:00,1581,Scroll through the days. Impressive fires.https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov...51547222407385Last year we experienced some wildfires and it was not good.Praying for rain..
6338658,trapsht,2019-07-08 10:10:00,28,"I just received a phone call from Stormer Lake Lodge. They said that they evacuated the lodge this morning. Apparently, they aren't letting anyone travel north on Nungesser Rd."
6338206,Pink Unicorn,2019-07-06 14:35:00,83,"Hey guys- Just a heads up that there are some serious fires in Red Lake. Several camps and First Nations communities had to be evacuated. There is currently a 100,000 acre fire burning about 55 miles NW of Red with several others in the vicinity.This is a pretty cool website that shows where fires are currently;https://www.ontario.ca/page/forest-firesI've got a big group headed up in 2 weeks and fingers crossed, we'll be able to get in. It is currently surrounded to the NW, NE, SW and S but they are 10-15 miles away. Stay safe!!"
6338222,Obabikon,2019-07-06 15:29:00,2370,"I actually jumped out of bed last night at midnight, and ran outside. The smoke was so bad, I thought something was on fire at the resort. It had been hazy, but nothing like it was last night. Tried to go back to sleep, but ended up walking a full lap around the resort to make sure everything was fine. Wind out of the North was blowing it down, and it was heavy smoke. Be safe out there!"
6338230,Pink Unicorn,2019-07-06 15:47:00,83,Wow! That had to be terrifying. A friend of mine just lost 4 cabins and they could barely evacuate the guests. Thankfully everyone is safe. These past 2 years have been terrible.
6338250,phishfearme,2019-07-06 18:01:00,1242,just returned from north caribou lake - smoke and ash - as well as hot air blasts - felt everyday. some photos attached. phish
6338252,ManitowishWaters,2019-07-06 18:20:00,39,Headed up on the 13th...starting to look for last week minute reservations as I think our camp will be evacuated soon. Any and all recommendations welcome
6338256,Pink Unicorn,2019-07-06 19:24:00,83,We might be in the same boat! My group is 18 so will be tough to find a good camp that can accommodate. There seems to be less fires south but much of the area NW of Red isn't looking good. I don't know anything about Wesley Outposts- they seem to be geared more towards hunting than fishing so you might be able to get in?
6338258,Pink Unicorn,2019-07-06 19:26:00,83,Did the fishing turn on for you? I've had that happen once where pine needles were dropping on our heads and the walleye went bonkers. Great pics but must've been a bit eerie. How did you upload them?
6338260,BornToFish,2019-07-06 20:04:00,1224,"Greetings, We just returned from a week of fishing on Stormer and Kirkness Lakes, about fifty miles north of Red Lake. A relatively meek rainstorm passed through the area early last Sunday morning. I heard a few gentle rumbles of thunder about 4:45 a.m. that morning as I left the dock. There was a light rain for about five minutes. My wife and I noticed a smoke plume about mid-afternoon on Sunday. We promptly returned to the lodge to report the fire The lodge owner immediately called the ""fire number"" to report the fire and learned that it had been reported minutes earlier by a pilot on a float plane. It wasn't long before a helicopter flew over the lake to follow-up on the reports. I believe this fire morphed into the now famous Nungesser Lake fire. The curious thing is that we were checked by the MNR just two hours before we or anyone else noticed the fire. The MNR guys apparently didn't notice the fire, or I am sure they would have reported it. The fire went from nothing to a raging wildfire in about two hours. I learned later that day that the storm spawned six separate fires in the general area that we were fishing. The smell of smoke, haze in the sky and falling ash were intimidating at times. Our lodge owner was in constant contact with the area fire fighters, such that all lodge guests were updated several times each day with the status of the fires. It was clear to all of us that the wild fires were and still are very dynamic - subject to the weather and prevailing winds. Some of the fires merged into a single fire while other fires split into multiple fires. We drove past a large burned area as we drove south on Nungesser road on Friday morning. It was a very solemn ride as my wife and I just looked at each other several times. We couldn't think of words that would be appropriate to say. We sure do hope for the very best for all that are affected by these fires. For those that believe, pray for a long and gentle rain. Very kindest regards....."
6338450,Obabikon,2019-07-07 14:00:00,2370,"I've actually had 3 different phone calls today about people looking to re-book trips because of the fires. Could help out one of them, but the other two were going to still be looking."
6338460,Pink Unicorn,2019-07-07 14:24:00,83,Got room for 18 plus a dog?
