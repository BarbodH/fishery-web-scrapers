1128777,thunderatwork,2009-08-14 10:39:00,79,"Bluff, water was about two feet higher than normal. Maybe that had something to do with it? we found walleyes in spots we couldn't find them before. don't know why. that northeast arm was the hottest spot (except for snags) for numbers with a few large ones mixed in-but not this year. was the water high on your trip also?"
1128971,Bluff,2009-08-15 07:58:00,152,"Yea, the water was high - over the dock at the Outpost, but we've seen it higher and still had a lot better fishing where your talking about. Our weather was really rough so we figured that had something to do with it. We couldn't go out on the big water for two days - waves were over 6-feet. We had snow, ice - ****, we caught lake trout in ten feet of water at the mouth of Little Wabakimi. We'll probably never see that again. That area though has always produced well - one of those spots you could count on when other areas turned off. Not this year."
1142789,Guest,2009-10-18 02:51:00,0,"We have been fishing with NWO for many years, have fished sessi, lil shab' and mink. Aug. 2010 will be our first time to Wabakimi. We would appreciate any lake info and pictures. My e-mail is [email protected]. Thanks D.K."
1143806,Bluff,2009-10-22 17:20:00,152,indypacker - I'll try to get some info together for you. I'm booked again for next year late may early june. Do you use a GPS?
1144221,indypacker,2009-10-25 06:26:00,2,"Yes we use GPS, I am also interested to know how big the lake is and how close the 3 outpost are to each other. We are used to having a lake to ourselves. Thanks"
1144407,thunderatwork,2009-10-26 07:09:00,79,"huge lake, by one resort's web site its 27 miles long including lower wabakimi. other outposts are 5? miles away. been there three times. Not going next year due to wife wanting me to take her somewhere. and i only have time for one week off in fishing season. I would book this lake again in a heartbeat. And i've been to six other outposts eleven times. all kinds of fishing- deep water, moving water ,mid lake reefs, shallow reefs, and weedy flats. been there 3 times and barely touched the number of good spots. Its comical to me to watch the canoes go by once every trip. these people are on a 14 to 17 day canoe trip thru wabakimi park. spots seem to change slightly each year. our best walleye came from sturgeon bay the first year, lower the second, and the icehouse toward the west last year. pike was always sturgeon bay. not real far up the east side. actually NWO is real close to some fantastic fishing."
1144462,Bluff,2009-10-26 10:41:00,152,"thunderatwork - where or what is the ""icehouse""? Is that the old trapper's cabin?indypacker - I can't disagree with anything thunderatwork stated about the lake. I wouldn't worry about people from the other outposts. You rarely see them even ""if"" they are up there at the same time you are. I'll work on some coordinates for you."
1144638,thunderatwork,2009-10-27 08:44:00,79,"Bluff,just soth of old trappers cabin,(1/3 mile?) and west thru some narrows to a bay. just past the narrows 50 to a 100 yards on the right shore, 10 to 14 feet of water, is awesome fishing. This is not a big spot, can ruin it real fast with motors running all the time in 10 feet of water. called icehouse because of one of the large rocks sticking out of the water resembles one. rest of lake can be turned on at 20 to 24 feet of water- but here they will be 10 to 14 feet- but i don't think there is any deeper water in this bay. Don't waste time oround the ""bald island rock"" in the main lake. we have every trip and never caught anything. use it as a reference point as you can see it from nearly anywhere in the main lake. this island even shows up in satilite photos."
1144682,Bluff,2009-10-27 12:09:00,152,"Thunderatwork - thanks, I know exactly where that rock is. We call that bay ""Glacier Bay"" because in spring there can still be ice on the water. Good if you need extra ice, which we have needed some times. That narrows and along the north shore has always produced for us. Not unusual that the trip's biggest northern comes from that area. We also get a lot of medium sized walleye. We'll work that shore as well as directly across the bay. For what it's worth it always seems cooler in that area during hot weather."
1144735,indypacker,2009-10-27 15:25:00,2,This is great info. I'll take all you have. It's going to be a long 10 month wait! Thanks
1124925,Guest,2009-07-29 22:25:00,0,"Wabakimi is coming back to it's old self...use RM and go up either for the opener or the second week (depending in the ice!). Had a fantastic trip this year with large northern up to 44"" and walleye jumping into the boat! If anyone needs some insight please post. hntnfsh"
1125576,houli,2009-08-01 11:22:00,4,group of six leaving for wabakimi aug.23 .with nwo 2nd trip there. 2years ago had just ok luck .any help would be great . will post on return.thanks houli. first post
1125742,Bluff,2009-08-02 09:34:00,152,"houli - do you fish the NWO bay much? Our group will go down south to the Sturgeon Rapids but we have never spent a lot of time in that bay. I do see NWO boats fishing in that area, but I wondered if they were just scared of the big water."
1126270,houli,2009-08-04 10:49:00,4,"bluff check your pm ,, leaving 8/23 with nwo any help from anyone would be great will post on return thanks houli"

1127105,Bluff,2009-08-07 15:30:00,152,"CowboyD - were you able to get Wabakimi coordinates to houli? If not, I am able to do it."
1127330,houli,2009-08-08 18:31:00,4,bluff and coyboyd i would like any gps spots you can give me and will give you ours and post when we return thanks houli
1128252,thunderatwork,2009-08-12 08:35:00,79,"just got back from wabakimi yesterday- five day trip thru rusty meyers. good fishing 4/5 days. although not as good as last year. the bigger fish were hard to find. Six people, biggest walleye-26, northern 42"". hot spot up northeast arm was dead. water highest in the three years i've been there. sturgon bay and just west of the mouth was our best. bears, moose, and bait stealing otters were fun to watch. the otters would come right to our dock and empty our minnow buckets that were hanging over the side of the boat."
1128766,Bluff,2009-08-14 10:04:00,152,"thunderatwork - You know we went up in late May and that northeast arm was the worst fishing we had seen in years. You know it's really bad when there is no action at all. It's also highly unusual. That's interesting that you found the same results. We were very surprised because it is usually one of the better, if not the best spot, especially for big fish. I wonder what happened?"
1098095,Bluff,2009-04-18 15:26:00,152,I know this lake has been discussed before but not for some time. I'm going up in late May and have been there several times before. Looking to share some knowledge about good spots to fish. Anyone interested?
1098334,lassh,2009-04-19 12:26:00,553,"Bluff, I have not been there before, so I won't be able to share any info. It is on my bucket list though. Its a good sized lake with a great variety of habitat. With the different populations of the deep fish, shallow fish, rock fish, weed fish and current fish, there should always be a pattern that will produce. I was signed up once to go in the fall, when 2 of the four in the group had to back out due to their company going bankrupt. Consequently lost deposits and opportunity to fish that lake. I was looking forward to some good September pike fishing. Which camp are you going to?"
1098392,Bluff,2009-04-19 16:53:00,152,"Lassh - thanks for the reply. We go with Rusty Meyers. Some people in our group have been going to Wabakimi for 25+ years. Excellent fishery. It is a big lake (have to keep an eye on the weather) with a variety of structure. We have always had very good success. Pike up to 52"" and Walleye up to 33"". No one in our group goes after Lake Trout but we are extending our stay this year and are going to try for a few. If you decide to go I could probably point you to a few good starting areas. It is a ""stained"" lake, lots of rocks and weeds. Really just an expansion of the Allen Waters."
1098712,thunderatwork,2009-04-20 13:09:00,79,you have pm bluff
1099014,cowboyd,2009-04-21 13:54:00,33,"HI BluffI an not here all that often but our group has been going there in fall for I guess ten or more years. We have used both Rusty and Northern. I agree it is a great fishery! We noticed a real drop off in numbers of fish after the big fire but half of our group went back last fall and said it was back to normal so the whole group will be going up again this fall in early Sept.I would be happy to discuss spots with you, the lake is so long I am sure we will both have some different ones besides the obvious. I seem to remember the trout hole out side the entrance to the Northern camp and on the way down to the falls on the far end of the lake. I have marked them but we only fished for them once and not long enough to do any good.Dick"
1099062,Bluff,2009-04-21 17:25:00,152,Dick - thanks for the reply. The falls you're talking about are the Tew Lake falls - correct? Some of our group went down there years ago and got a few walleye - they didn't spend much time there. It is a long haul. I am curious to here more about that Trout hole by the NWO bay. How deep is that hole? We go up at the end of May so it may be a different story at that time of year (?). While we have gone done to the Sturgeon Rapids I can't help but notice NWO boats fishing the whole general area in the vicinity of their cabin. I always wonder if they are getting anything. We spend a lot of time across the lake in what we call Sock Bay as well as what is called St. James Bay. Sock Bay looks like a sock between the bays that look like chicken and rabbit heads. St. James is the bay off to the left as you head towards Kenoji Lake. That whole north shore of that bay has been very productive. Is that trout hole literally inside the NWO bay?
1099298,cowboyd,2009-04-22 14:46:00,33,"first of all I am not a comp whiz kid so I left you a private message as well. If this works it should be a link to Rusty's map of the lake and by us both looking at the same referenc it should be easier. http://www.rustymyers.com/files/wabakimi_map.jpgif you come out of the Northern bay and turn to your left going towards the end of the big lake with in a couple of hundred yards of the mouth you will find a hump, sand bar or rock the drop off, depending on wind direction, should hold fish. Keep going along with your fish or depth finder on and in maybe a quarter mile or so ( guessing) you will find what I believe is the deepest part of the lake a spot about 90 to 100 deep. We have marked trout there in the past but as I said never really tried to bring one up. I have to be honest without a map and the names I only know the spots by the names we give them lol. That makes this a bit hard. The falls down from the cabin in the fall when we fish are almost always a good bet for walleyes as well as the island just down from the cabin. There are three major sets of falls I know of on the lake. The one I just mentioned, the second all the way down the long part of the big lake and the third in what I guess you call sock bay or the one just down to the right from Rusty's when facing towards the Northern camp side of the lake. It lies all the way down and I believe is the exit point for the flowage while the other two are entry points for water. Hopes this helps some but please feel free to contact me and I suspect we may be able to help each other more. The bigest issue will be spring vs fall fishing I suspect.Dick"
1120838,Willboy,2009-07-14 09:12:00,1,I was just reading all of the posts for Wabakimi. This is my first trip to the lake. Using NWO. I would be interested in some locations to start fishing. I have been reading some of the posts but can not relate since most are directions from Rusty Myers camp. I do not know where this camp is located. I have printed out a map of Wabakimi. Any more info would be helpful.Willboy
1121189,cowboyd,2009-07-15 14:20:00,33,hello:I got your email please yours and give me a call and I will try and help
1123905,Bluff,2009-07-26 07:28:00,152,I know CowboyD has plenty of info. I'm just getting my computer back up and running. If you need any info from me let me know. Our group has rebooked again for next year on Wabakimi.
