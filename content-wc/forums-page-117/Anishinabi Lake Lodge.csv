6338188,prov1800,2019-07-06 13:20:00,5010,We had another opportunity to go to Clark's Anishinabi Lodge for 4 days. Our flight was at 9:30 last Saturday. Zack was our pilot again and we had a great flight that took about 15 minutes from the base camp at Clark's Northern Lights on Cedar Lake. There was a group of 8 people on the dock at Anishinabi Lodge ready for their flight out. They told us they had an awesome week of fishing on the main lake and on a number of portage lakes. After taking our gear to our cabin (the guide cabin) using the gator we got out on the lake in search of trout and pike. Our goal was to fish more pike than trout as our trip last year produced some good pike fishing. We had seen some exceptionally large pike and with the water being as clear in Anishinabi as it is we could see the pike coming after our lures. In most cases we either let them bite or if they were smaller we would reel fast and try to get the lure away from them. We still managed to catch 70 plus in a half day of fishing with some decent sized ones. We went into Halverson Lake also which can be accessed by boat from Anishinabi. We fished for pike and smallmouth bass and pretty much caught bass on every cast and the pike in Halverson were very aggressive. Jigging for trout was tougher this year than last year so we ended up using manual downriggers that we found at the camp which turned out to be the ticket and we caught lake trout in 80 feet of water. Weather was great up in the 30c range and we had some windy days. For 4 days we enjoyed the peace and tranquility and the beautiful scenery. It is amazing how quiet it is out there. Highly recommend this trip. Walleye fishing at the portage lakes is excellent this time of year and if you are searching for superb lake trout fishing a short portage will get you into Isabella Lake. ATVs are available for your use to get into the walleye lakes. Bottled drinking water is supplied and all the live bait needed.

6338368,jsmyers,2019-07-07 08:26:00,198,"Thanks for the report. I'm curious what it's like on Anishinabi compared to other lakes, especially when the wind is blowing.It is a big lake! And mostly over 200' deep!https://anishinabilodge.com/mapanishinabilake.htmFinding pike in something that deep and clear seems like an interesting challenge.In September 2016, I fished Halvorsen and the end of the lake by Williams' Narrows, using Wine Lake Camp's portage boats. The number of bass we caught was nuts! At that time, the fish we're around 5-10 feet, especially on the windy side of the lake, silvery lippless rattling cranks worked best. Once a bass coughed up a ~3"" cisco.Note that the narrows is named for the Williams, who built Wine Lake Camp and owned it until 1987. That outpost used to be part of Wine Lake's operation, though I don't know when that changed. Tom Williams owns Sleepy Dog Cabins on Wabaskang, where I just visited.It's quite a trip up the river from Wine Lake to Anishinabi. I doubt I'll ever be able to explore Anishinabi much without staying on the lake.Sent from my SM-G960U using Tapatalk"
6338502,prov1800,2019-07-07 18:19:00,5010,Anishinabi is definitely a interesting lake. My wife and I went to Halverston the first day after we got unloaded.very shallow to get into Halverston only a good deep.As went slowly went through the sand bar we saw bass scattering steady.we did fish just left as we got in the lake.we caught bass on most casts and they loved the tiny torpedoes.my wife changed up and started throwing a silver spoonbehind the boat and basically caught pike on most casts.We fished all around lake and it was non stop.Right in front of the portage trail to duck lake was exceptionally good for both species and some good sized fish there.Good weed beds in the lake just coming up. Anishinabi mostly gets West winds so leaving the lodge on the island and head to West shore is not bad but it can get rolling but once your on the west shoreline it's pretty calm and all the bays are fantastic for pike and bass.just need to find the sweet spots in the bays where the dropp offs are and were the deep weed beds are and you will find the pike.last week it was 7-15 ft and caught them on most casts.A silver spoon was the winner though although other lures worked quite well.i used a orange shallow raider with a lot of success.The whole West shoreline is trollable for trout on windy days.Tgere are a couple bigger islands that can be fished on either side depending on wind plus there are portage lakes with walleye and trout so there's options.best part is the peace and queite.lol.
