6339556,Painter1,2019-07-11 00:07:00,26,I have some unexpected free time for a few weeks in August and would like to drag my TR22 Triton fiberglass bass boat from Missouri to fish somewhere new in Canada. I don't care to troll but am after anything that will tug on the line; 100% catch and release guy. I am blessed with an ample budget but will fish alone unless a guide comes along. Your thoughts are most welcome.
