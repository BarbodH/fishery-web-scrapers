6338714,Pooch,2019-07-08 12:55:00,4618,"I'm at Mahkwa right now. Fish are not on any main lake structure, yet. Popular spots in late July are devoid of fish for now. Have to hunt fish. We are trolling and jigging, but trolling producing best fish.Better report later on. Heavy smoke on the lake last week and over the weekend. Cleared up today.When we arrived last Thursday all fish we caught were slots and overs. Since then numbers have gone up, but size has gone down. We did pickup five overs just before we came in for lunch with the largest 24.5"". No monsters by any means, but just nice plump fish.I'd call fishing average for early July. Lake level still down. but not a factor. I am getting more red X's marking hazards on my waypoint list. Seeing hazards I was not aware of and points that come out further and shallower than I realized.Pooch"
6338742,fisher_i_am,2019-07-08 14:25:00,498,What water temps are you seeing
6338774,Pooch,2019-07-08 15:52:00,4618,"High sixties to low seventies on the surface. Though caught fish fell colder than usual this year. We were near Dominions yesterday and surface temps were mid sixties. South wind today they are seventy one in same area.The ""cloud"" cover from the forest fires seems to have held surface temps down a little, but with high sun now they jumped quickly.Pooch"
