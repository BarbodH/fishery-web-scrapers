The first thing my sister said to me was ""Our plaque dating back to '93 is destroyed"". As I sit here, exhausted from a sleepless night and numb from emotion, a flood of memories flow through my mind. My Dad took me up for my first trip when I was 10 years old. We stepped off the plane and I was immediately introduced to the wilds of Canada; A recently killed nuisance black bear had attempted cabin entry the night before (the same cabin we were to stay in). I can still remember how tightly I held my back against the back corner of that top bunk bed. My sister was introduced 3 years later and together, the 3 of us became quite the team. We've had years where it was just us and groups of 12 of more. I've caught countless fish, met my best friend there, bonded with people I would've never otherwise met, enjoyed night fishing under the northern lights and escaped very dangerous situations. Needless to say, this camp meant the world to me. It's funny how these places become such significant parts of our lives. I don't think people outside of our world know the power that remote trips can have on the soul. Chimo has vowed to rebuild and they have a great team. I'm sure the cabin will be incredible when it's done. The only thing missing will be that plaque from '93.Neil"

6338556,Lake Of The Woods,2019-07-08 01:18:00,124,"Lived in Kenora for 15 years and was a Forest Fire Fighter for 5 of those years. I was on hundreds of fires during that time and had sadly witnessed camps, cottages and homes being burnt to the ground along with wildlife being destroyed by the forces of mother nature. Although destructive there is always new life that follows. The forest will return along with wildlife and eventually those who lost their material belongings rebuild and carry on bringing with them the memories of the past. It is the natural cycle of nature and when living in that environment we must accept the risks that are a part of it. The most important factor is to prevent as best we can the loss of human life,... everything else is secondary. When you hear of fires in the 10,000 to 100,000 acre range it sounds monstrous in size and though it is a large area when you fly over it at 20,000 plus feet it looks relatively small compared to the entire land mass that surrounds it. In 1988 I was on a fire north of Red Lake which reached a final size of 350,000 hectares(864,868 acres). It burnt all summer and took out our base camp when the wind suddenly changed direction one afternoon. The fire was fought late into the fall of that year and the following spring it still had sub-surface hot spots that had to be extinguished. Still, when flying over the burnt area it didn't seem to put a dent into the millions of hectares that was still green. Some 30 years later there are fresh new ecosystems flourishing, That's life on planet Earth,... the Mother of all nature knows what she's doing."
