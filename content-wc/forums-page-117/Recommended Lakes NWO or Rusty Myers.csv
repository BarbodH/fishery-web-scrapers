My only visit was in 2014 to Wabakimi which was great other than the weather! Looking for a lake with an only cabin (preferable but not 100% necessary), good water flow, and cabbage weeds for better than average pike. I think I've narrowed them down to a handful of lakes and am interested to see if anyone has further input. NWO: Holly, Dasant, Lil Shab, Mink Rusty Myers: Siess, Granite, Wilkie, Metionga Thank you"

Many options.i personally like anishinabi and did real good last week when I wad there."
6339304,Boiler,2019-07-10 08:39:00,6,"Thanks Prov1800 for your response. Yes we are looking for a fly out, and we will use either NWO or Rusty Myers given their close proximity to the border and our familiarity with NWO."
6339396,grindstone,2019-07-10 12:11:00,201,"So we have flown NWO for I'm guessing 20 years. In our case they are the exclusive air guys for the fly in lodge where we go but that they (NWO) doesn't own. A few years back a guide that we had known for a number of years was telling us a story. ""so the group after you guys last year I had been guiding a guy for a few days. Making conversation I asked the client ""what do you do back in the world?"" ""I'm the chairman of Boeing"" the guide asked then making a gesture as drawing a bow ""like strings, arrow rests, and sights and such?"" ""no"" the guest said gesturing to the sky ""jets"". I repeated the story to the camp owner and he laughed OH YA that group sent an advance team and they inspected the aircraft and logs. I said sure the stock could fall 10 percent before it's found that it was a turbo Otter not a 737 makes since to me. NWO has safe planes. I would assume they run their camps to a high standard. I do have a suggestion for Boiler if you want to PM me about where we have gone for the last 20 out of my 28 consecutive years."
6339478,mctbone,2019-07-10 18:27:00,26,"Five of us were at Siess last year in early August. Loads of walleyes on off-shore humps and points. Good average size, but nothing overly large for us, maybe 24"" max. We fished almost exclusively for walleye and saw very few pike. Only one pike of any size, 40"" trolling across a point. Did not see much of weeds. Miles of water to explore through a number of different lakes in both directions, but most of our luck was on Siess itself."
6339558,dschiebel,2019-07-11 01:27:00,85,"Been using them for 20 yearsMink - Higher number of walleyes, and Northerns, smaller fishLil Shab - Bigger walleyes and northerns, lower numbersFished both numerous times, great lakes, only cabins on lake.Vic and Mitzi and company are great."
6339584,Boiler,2019-07-11 06:21:00,6,"mctbone, could you elaborate a little more about Siess? It is the lake I have the most questions about. I contacted Rusty Myers, and they stated that Siess had some of the best pike fishing (for larger pike). How was the cabin? Was there a lot of moving water? Any other details would be appreciated."
6339794,mctbone,2019-07-11 20:16:00,26,"Boiler, the cabin was one of the nicer fly-in cabins I've stayed at. 3 separate bedrooms and an enclosed porch area large enough to spread out everyone's fishing and boat gear and hang wet rain gear with 2 full sized refrigerators. I would not say there was moving water in terms of incoming streams or rapids, but there were more miles of connected lakes than we could could get to in either direction. There are neck-down areas between each lake with a little current but we didn't get anything in those areas. In fact we didn't get much of anything in the shallower sections of the lake. It was early August and the walleyes were stacked on mid-lake humps topping out 16-20 feet in 30-40 ft of water. My wife and I and a friend were almost exclusively jigging for walleyes but did not run into many incidental pike and none above 30'. The other couple were almost exclusively trolling cranks and got the one 40"" pike but I think that was their only one above 30"". I can believe there are big pike in there as we saw a lot of baitfish clouds in the deeper sections and the walleyes we caught were well fed and fought well. In hind sight, maybe the other couple should have tried some open water trolling in the deeper sections. In any case we really didn't run into any sizeable pike but the one. I would consider going back there again someday because of the fast walleye action, but there's just so many other new lakes I haven't been to yet. Feel free to PM me if you want more details."
