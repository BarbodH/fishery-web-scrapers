Biggest walleye was 27"". Also a 25 incher. Lots of fish between 20-23 and seemingly countless numbers in 14 - 18 range. Did notice smoke rising near us one day on way back to cabin and within the hour planes were working on that small fire. Found out there were actually 5 small fires in our area. Rained most of night the next night and took care of those fires but it was smokey in our area. Highly recommend this lake and this outfitter."
