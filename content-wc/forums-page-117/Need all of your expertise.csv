Never been up there during that time. So, howâ€™s the walleye fishing? How about the Muskie during that time?? Smallies ?? Northern ??? Thanks in advance for your help. Going to northern Ontario. Thanks again."
6338838,The tank,2019-07-08 18:44:00,340,For walleyes I fish mid july and mid to end of August. Pretty much fish the same spots. Done it that way for years. Muskie pretty much the same unless the weather has gotten alot cooler. Dont fish for snot rockets anymore. Haven't fished for smallies in a few years either.
6338884,martinbns,2019-07-08 21:17:00,1520,Where I fish on the Canadian part of LOTW walleye are far better on Sept 1st than July 30th. They are on humps feeding like crazy
6338942,BornToFish,2019-07-09 05:44:00,1224,"Greetings, I have considerable experience fishing in NW Ontario during middle of August and again in the middle of September. The weeks between these fishing trips involve considerable change in the lakes that I fished. Peak water temperature was often reached in about the middle of August, which meant weed growth was also at its peak. Water temperature was often rapidly falling by middle of September, such that weed beds were often decimated. Fishing in early September will likely put the original poster somewhere on this path of falling water temperatures. The exact placement on the path will depend upon summer/autumn weather patterns. I fished for walleyes in the same places in September that I fished during July and August - just deeper on the sides of off-shore structure. For example, I might be fishing at 18 feet in early August on the side of a rock hump and then fishing the same rock hump at 32 feet in mid-September. Smallies would often be on the tops of the same rock humps. Northerns typically remained in the vicinity of the rock humps until the water temperature fell far enough to break down the thermocline. Much of my musky fishing in August and September involved looking for complexity = wood + weed + rock + nearby deep water. I let the muskies tell me what they wanted in terms of speed - burning blades versus slow moving twitch or jerk baits. An interesting pattern often develops in early to middle of September. As mentioned above, cabbage weed beds often declining rapidly in early September. This means that perch and other bait fish get funneled into ever smaller patches of standing green weeds. Casting around three standing green weeds in close proximity to one another can be the equivalent of finding a gold mine that is loaded with shiny diamonds. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6338954,MrSimon,2019-07-09 06:28:00,922,"I have fished late August many times in Ontario. I love that time of year. The weather and temps are usually stable. Very few bugs. Cool evenings and warm days. Walleye are just doing their thing on structure in 18-22 FOW, pike are on main lake structure, but healthy green weed beds will always hold fish. I REALLY like weedy bays that have some depth and a creek coming in. Those always produce in late August."
6339050,SterlingArcher,2019-07-09 12:14:00,92,"The nice thing about fishing later in the year is that as available cover decreases (e.g. weed beds thinning out as they die) the remaining cover can really concentrate fish. Finding the best remaining weeds for example can put you on a pile of fish in a hurry. You might have to hunt a little more to find fish, but once you find them it can be crazy good. Don't assume that they will be deeper (though that is often the case). Shallow windblown rocky points and shallow rock/gravel bars can be absolute dynamite in the fall."
6339370,eyecatcher1,2019-07-10 10:56:00,323,If you're going up there after Labor Day take some warm clothes just in case. I've been there mid September when it's 80* and also when we had snow.
6339378,gordy28,2019-07-10 11:22:00,437,"Our trip in 2018 was the last full week of August - I did a pretty detailed breakdown of our fishingPer other feedback at this time of year it can get cold fast - on all of our trips (we always go last week of Aug, first of September) we have some pretty sharp weather changes from hot to cold and then back the other way https://www.canadafishingguide.net/f...ek-ogoki-lake/"
