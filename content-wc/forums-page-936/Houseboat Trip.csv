522416,Guest,2002-07-18 16:28:00,0,"Houseboats are a good deal, first time you learn, then it's old hat. Great way to have a good time right in the heart of the fishing grounds."
522417,BD,2002-07-18 16:34:00,739,"When you are underway the houseboat is a boat; no open alcoholic beverages are allowed. When the houseboat is tied up to an island the houseboat is a cabin and open alcoholic beverages are allowed. We never had any trouble underway but we were never checked. There were some guys in another boat that got checked on the way in and got caught with a few to many fish (they had a limit in the freezer to take home and were having one last fish fry with the overs). Not only did they get nailed for the extra fish, the wardens got them for everything else they could including drinking underway. They were cussing out Canada and everything Canadian when they got back to the dock. From the comments they made the Canadians can be happy that crew won't be back."
522418,BD,2002-07-19 15:50:00,739,"The septic tanks are large. Don't be afraid to use water when you flush the head. Without enough water during the flush the dropings build up under the pipe and that can make you think the septic is full when it isn't. Also take a couple of packages of tank treatment along to treat the septic tank. It will keep the boat from smelling like an unvented outhouse.Just checked out the Tomahawk site for the first time. There used to be dozens of houseboat operators on LOTW. The bad ones didn't stay in business very long. Floating Lodges, LOTW Houseboats, and Tomahawk must all doing something right, like making their customers happy, or they would not be around. The Tomahawk boats look nice but there is one thing they don't show that most of the LOTW Houseboats have; an enclosed front porch (combination windows can be opened for air). When the weather or bugs get bad the extra room inside helps.When you are crusing pay close attension to the maps!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There are a lot of rocks, sunken islands etc that can give you a lot of trouble. Also with 14000 islands it's easy to get lost. A GPS does help on the way back but if you don't have a route entered in the unit to retrace it's easy to get mixed up and head the wrong direction.JB; When you become a WC member, send me an email or leave a private message and I will send you some fishing info. Just look up BD in the user menu."
522405,JB,2002-07-12 09:14:00,109,"Looking to take a houseboat trip on Lake of the Woods. I'm checking into the Tomahawk Resort boats. Anyone have experience with them and their houseboats, or any suggestions about houseboats in general."
522406,BD,2002-07-12 10:18:00,739,Our group has used Lake of the Woods Houseboats for 15 years. http://www.lowhouseboats.com I can give you a more info but I would like to know how large your group will be and when you are planning to go.
522407,Guest,2002-07-12 14:35:00,0,We plan on having 7 people.
522409,Rather Be Lucky,2002-07-12 20:19:00,256,"We have been using Floating Lodges out of Souix Narrows for many years, class act. Leave in 34 days. Great way to put your ""cabin"" anywhere you want. With all the high water it could be a problem finding beaches without being in the trees. I'm sure the 'eyes are on the humps. Can't wait!! Swede"
522408,BD,2002-07-14 22:53:00,739,"The 44' boats are perfect for 6 people and the 52' boats for 8 or 9. There are six individual bunks in the 44' and nine in the 52'. When our party was smaller we took 7 people in the 52' boat for the extra room. That made the rental a little more expensive for each man but we thought it was worth it. If there are a couple of kids along they might be OK with sharing a double bunk in the 44"" boat. There is no way that I would share a bunk with the Vampire, the Mad Irishman or any other member of that crew so the larger boat worked best for us. You get a 16' Lund fishing boat with the rental but the motor is extra so we bring a short shaft 20hp or 25hp along with us. The 16' Lund has the ""resort boat"" type flat board seats so we also bring some clamp-on seats along. I made the clamps to match the Lund seats. They do not slip like the commercial clamp-on ones can.Rather Be Lucky mentioned Floating Lodges. Their boats were a little fancier, however LOTW Houseboats have upgraded many of their boats recently. The fishing boat that comes with the Floating Lodges rentals has swivel seats allready installed. The boats from Floating Lodges were much more expensive to rent than the Lake of the Woods Houseboats. I haven't checked the price difference lately so that's something you would want to do.After you decide when and where you are going and become a Walleye Central member yourself, send me an email and I will send you some more info on areas to fish etc."
522410,fishinnut,2002-07-15 08:04:00,642,"From my experience I would suggest you make sure the septic holding tank has been pumped completely out before you start your trip. I would keep a large cooler with blocks of ice to keep beer/pop. Saves frig space. Get a five gallon bucket with lid, drill holes in upper 1/3 and lid. Place a rock inside to sink. Works great to keep minnows. Also try to set up a radio chat time with other houseboaters to talk fishing(location, baits, etc). Have used services of Lake of the Woods Houseboats and would recommend them."
522411,Guest,2002-07-16 15:10:00,0,"Sounds like a good deal,but hows the fishing???? These boats can be as fancy as the RITZ hotel, but $10.00 is too much if the fishings lousy!"
522412,BD,2002-07-16 21:37:00,739,"Now that kinda depends on how good a fisherman you are. :)The fishing on LOTW has been great recently. Of course the weather etc. has an effect on the day to day action. LOTW is not a Northwest Territories fly in trophy lake by any means; but we have caught (or sometimes lost when there is a beginner on the net) quite a few piggies. The northern, musky, smallmouth and crapie fishing is good also."
522413,Guest,2002-07-17 04:45:00,0,"Tomahawk is a great resort with nothing but top notch equipment. The Kast family does nothing but first class all the way. The other houseboat companies around Sioux Narrows are great as well. I would drive it around Yellow Girl Bay area or maybe park it around Shore Island, you would then be in the heart of some the Woods best walleye fishing. The eyes are in the summer homes and using depths from 2' to 30'. You can get them with bouncers on the deep edges and cranks on top. Check out Secret Spots on http://www.justfishontario.com, they have spots in that area marked with GPS. To be in the heart of the best fishing grounds will give you more fishing time. The spots marked on Secret Spots are some great producers but there are literally hundreds of others as well. The keys, underwater humps and shorelines of off shore islands; also the edges of deep cabbage beds can be hot especially during lower light periods."
522414,JB,2002-07-17 11:10:00,109,"Well, I've booked a week with one of Tomahawks houseboats. Thanks for the advice guy's. Most of all, thanks for the tip on the septic tank. That one would be bad. One more question! Not that it's a high priority, but I do enjoy a good cold one after a hot day fishing. Is alchohol allowed on the houseboats?JB"
