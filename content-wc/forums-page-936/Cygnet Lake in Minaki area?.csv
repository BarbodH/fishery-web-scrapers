522578,Swede811,2002-07-17 18:43:00,32,"I think it is NW of Minaki, maybe a drive to camp called something like Cygnet Lake Camp or Lodge.?"

It is 3300 acre lake with walleyes, northerns, smallmouth bass, and perch. We catch lots of walleyes in the 17"" to 20"" range. We do ocassionally get bigger ones but it is rare. Cygnet Lake camp is under new ownership this year and If they are half the hosts Bill and Sam were I will keep going up there. If your friend wants any more info e-mail me."
