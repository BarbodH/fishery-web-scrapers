Doesen't ever hurt to have a photocopy of your birth certificate when crossing the border though.I have always kept a copy in my truck even before the whole 9/11 incident. I live in Soo, Ontario and trust me the U.S side of the border is way more strict than the Canadian right now.ThanksMartyNorthAlgoma.com"

We crossed in mid June and they did not ask for birthcertificates just used drivers licenses. The crossing was definately easier into Canada then coming back. But no problems really either way."
