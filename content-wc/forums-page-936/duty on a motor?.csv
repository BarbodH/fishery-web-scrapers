Good deal. you will have to stop at Canadian custom's offfice on way out to show you are taking the motor out of the country, thus no sales tax, and at U.S. office to show it is EPA OK.Have fun.Bill K"

522563,Guest,2002-07-17 15:00:00,0,Good idea to check it out but if you buy Honda or Yamaha the warranty is international. Not sure about the others. Dealers get paid to fix warranty issues. I can't see turning away a customer. Lots of this talk is urban legend material.
