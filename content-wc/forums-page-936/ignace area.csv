Then drive up the road to where you have a 1/3 mile walk in to their landing. Theyre the only one that have this boat landing,boats and bait deal on the whole lake and have it tied up. Costwise its not a bad deal. Theres good walleye and excellent northern fishing."
522269,eyewitness,2002-07-17 20:57:00,680,"Kevin, Do you have a phone # for the outpost camp where you stayed? Or maybe even Vern's bait Shop? Also, is it possible to put an 18' Tournament type boat into these lakes or is it only small boat territory? How bad is the last three miles? I've been on some pretty nasty logging roads up there, but usually the effort is worth it. Thanks!"
522275,Guest,2002-07-19 11:40:00,0,"we stay at flayer's.but you can still fish kukukus from another resort. the north landing is a natural landing, and is rough but the logging co.made it a little better.it is futher down that road but i'm not sure how far,or how good it is.i have not seen but the guy's that i go with have seen it ."
522263,Guest,2002-07-07 20:40:00,0,im looking for info on any lakes good for fishing in the ignace ontario area.will be camping on crown land and will be taking a 14ft boat.will be wanting some where within 50 to 75 miles.
522264,Guest,2002-07-07 21:34:00,0,"Grande, I just got back from Ignace! First time there? Let me recommend a lake to you that you will catch plenty and good size fish. We left on the 26th of June to head back to South Dakota. Let me tell you one thing, I didn't want to come back. The fishing was amazing. I am not sure where Crown Island is. But, go to Vern's bait shop in Ignace and let them know you want to fish Heathwalt lake and directions to Artheusa(Spelling?) (Air-re-thu-za). We fished Heathwalt the entire trip. One word of caution is the road. You turn off of Road 599 onto a road that turns out 24 miles of mid to low grade. The last 3 miles is really low grade. We stayed on Heathwalt/Godden lake at an Outpost camp. Our Outpost owner who lives in Ignace, told us Artheusa has some of the biggest walleye's around. We didn't fish that lake, wish we did though. Were are you driving from? US?Look forward to hearing from you. Kevin LowerreGet your bait at Vern's bait shop, they will supply the containers full of minnows and air for your stay. How long are you staying?"
522265,Guest,2002-07-08 05:11:00,0,"We are also camping on crown land at Hamilton Lake 50 miles north of Savant Lake on Hwy 599. Beautiful lake. Campground unimproved though there are plenty of camping spaces. Outhouses last we were there three years ago left much to be desired. But, where there is a good lake, lots of fish, there is a way."
522266,Guest,2002-07-08 19:52:00,0,"If you're looking for a good map of the area - when you are in getting your bait at Vern's Minnows or Castle Baits, ask for a Bud Evans map of the Ignace Area #113,which covers Heathwalt and Arethus Lakes. The other area maps that would be helpful are Sturgeon Lake #114 and also Valora #112.Good Luck Fishing!"
522270,Kurt,2002-07-08 20:27:00,47,"If you take the mine road (Matabi Lyon Div.)just north of Silver Dollar, you will come to Darkwater Lake at the very end of the road just before the mine entrance. Follow the little river through the culvert and the lake opens up. Good walleye. No trophies but good numbers in the past.Sturgeon is good for lake trout early in the year in shallow water. After the water warms up if you have deep gear you can still get them. The area around Mountain Island seems to be the most popular. The access is just north of the Moose creek camp. Not marked very well and will require driving through some standing water. Check at the Moose Creek Camp bait shop maybe for directions. If you can get on Sturgeon and the water is high enough, on the southeast end of the lake you can get into Jackpot Lake. Great Walleye in there. Requires you tilt up the motor and oar you way through some tough rocks. In general be very aware of sudden shallow areas and submerged reefs on Sturgeon and Jackpot. Mountain Island Bay is good for big Pike. There are several lodges in the area at the south end of Sturgeon. Sac Bay Lodge, Lumberjack Lodge, and Sturgeon Lake Lodge.The English River landing by the 599 bridge will take you upstream several miles to some falls/rapids. Great fishing just below the falls. Make sure you have a good map, it's kind of tricky finding the falls but not bad if have a decent map. Good Luck"
522271,BD,2002-07-10 15:19:00,739,"Press Lake ---Go about 40 miles north of Ignace then turn onto the road to Press Lake Camp. Good campsites and a decent landing. Fishing for eyes, smallies and snot rockets is good.Indian Lake --- Much like Press. Both are part of the English River system.English River --- Take along plenty of extra shear pins and an extra prop. :)Seine River --- Take along an extra lower unit. :D"
522267,Guest,2002-07-14 22:01:00,0,"hey kevin! thanks for the advice.i am not planning on going through an outfitter.just want to do it on my own and camp.will be taking my truck camper and boat.how bad is this road you r talking about.is there any places to camp on crownland there.will be coming from central wisconsin. what was the size of fish you caught?i was on CALM lake last year.right off of hwy11 just east of atikokan.the fishing was just terrible.caught walleyes every day and alll day.biggest one was probally 13inches.what a joke!what is crown island?how much did you guys pay to stay where you went?i'll be going up july 31 for 5 days. hope you can tell me more ! thanks again , grande"
522268,BD,2002-07-14 23:26:00,739,Try Press Lake Camp www.presslake.on.ca It's about forty miles north of Ignace to the turn off then another thirteen miles by gravel road. There is only Press Lake Camp there for camp sites or housekeeping cabins. The camp buildings are the only buildings on the 9000 acre lake. There is public access by an old burned out bridge at the end of the road if you want to make it a day trip and not pay the camp launch fee.
522272,Guest,2002-07-16 09:23:00,0,anyone out there that knows anything about heathwalt and arethusa lakes as far as camping and fishing?
522273,Guest,2002-07-17 11:50:00,0,"try going to kukukus lake it is a fantastic walleye factory you have to put in at the north landing, check the condition of the landing first at one of the bait shops.it was bad a few years ago but i think the logging company fixed it up a little."
