My problem is that i don't fully understand pike behavior during this time period. Will big pike (38"" plus) still be deep? will they be in the remaining green weeds? rockpiles near deep water? weed edges near deep water? in the river mouths feeding on spawning ciscoes?...etc. Once I understand I can better select my lure linuep. Any advice is, as always, most appreciated. thanks.."

It's your friend. When wind-swept, rocky points are available, cast or troll these spots thoroughly. Big mommas often hang off these areas, suspended, as they await the arrival of unsuspecting baitfish. If you're trolling, don't move too slowly. I've land my biggest northerns trolling at over 4 mph and as fast as 5 mph. Those toothy critters don't get a chance to think about it. They simply react. You'll be surprised at how they can engulf a hook laden lure at high speed. Also, and old Canadian guide once told me that if you find small walleye, there's most likely big pike in the neighborhood. Cast around with Husky Jerks or spoons. Another likely spot is weed infested feeder streams, especially when the wind is pushing up against it on overcast days. Weedless spoons and topwaters are effective weapons. And remember, if you're working the wood and weeds along the shore for smaller pike, don't forget to turn around and throw your lure into the deeper water on the other side of the boat every once in awhile. Stickbaits and crank baits with plenty of flash will sometimes provide you with the surprise of a lifetime. Another tactic is to get up early and work shallow flats with topwaters, big Mepps Bucktail spinners and ugly looking spoons. Good luck and have fun."
