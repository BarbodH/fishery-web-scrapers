522463,Guest,2002-07-16 08:26:00,0,"try http://justfishontario.com/reports.htm they have a bunch of reports on the LOTW. I understand the fishing has been great all over northwestern Ontario. Walleyes are in their summer patterns relating to the deeper water, underwater humps, shorelines of islands, and deep edges of weed beds. By the way that site has a page that is called Secret Spots that give you some GPS spots for summer walleyes. I guess the guy used to fish the Woods about a 150 days a year and has a pretty good handle on it. Good luck."
522464,Pete,2002-07-17 11:44:00,35,"The fishing on the Woods is great. Walleyes, smallies, northerns, perch are all doing well. Muskies seem to be getting ready for the big ones to really go. Haven't heard of many giants yet. Heard of the big girls following alot but not really munching."

522468,Guest,2002-07-19 17:33:00,0,"Any one have any luck staying closer to the Narrows and fishing Bass or Pike?
