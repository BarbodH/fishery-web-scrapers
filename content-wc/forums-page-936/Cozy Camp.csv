522565,Kurt,2002-07-16 19:32:00,47,"I have never stayed at the Cozy Camp, but I have launched by the 599 bridge and went upstream. If you go all the way to talking falls, the fishing is great just below the falls. Watch out for the rocks and have either a good troller, good anchor or both to keep you in the current. The back water portion of the falls area is much deeper and will have larger pike typically in the slot length. You will need to be able to read a good map to find the falls but it is not too difficult to find with a decent map. Good luck!!"
522566,Guest,2002-07-17 06:24:00,0,I spent the 3rd week of June In that camp.I don't have time to write now but will get back to you this evening.
522567,Guest,2002-07-17 14:29:00,0,"spent a week there 4 years ago in late summer. Did poorly below the falls up-river. Had some luck on large northerns upriver from the Cosy Kamp. Best fishing was down stream in the corners of the river towards Barrell Lake. Just before Barrell Lake gave us the best fishing for wallys. And then at the very end of Barrell where it goes over the falls (left side of island) into the river above Press Lake. Got into a school of 3-5 # we. But, this is a dangerous area as you better not get sucked into the falls. The river splits around an island and there are actually 2 falls. I refer to the left one. We landed the boat and walked down to the bottom of the 2 falls from the falls on the right side."

Like stated before the fishing was betterdown river. we found eyes at the mouth of the river by barrel lake.Around the islands. Most around the last island and the the northshore. Many eaters, but we got fish up to 26"" there. We also foundeyes at the north falls on the left side. Found some Smallmouth on thenorth west side on Barrel. Also just upriver from the mouth, where ever you find rock on shore. Some biggies. Plenty of pike around. The bigger fish go deeper,they were even chaseing our walleyes.It is 1/2 hour ride downstream to the mouth of the river. another 15 min. to the north falls. I was not impressed with the river upstream from the camp. We liked it downstream much better. I would like to be there when the river is not so high. We had tough conditions but still didwell.The camp is not fancy, but has what you need. I will post my Website showing pics. tonight. I will go back."
