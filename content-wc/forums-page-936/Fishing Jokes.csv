He motors over and asks what is the matter. she keeps crying,""Oh, my FiFi, Oh, my FiFi. He fianally asks,""Who is FiFi?"" she responds, my Poodle and a giant muskie just jumped out of the water and ate her!"". The gentleman turns and opens his tackle box, rummages around and says, Ah, and what color was FiFi?"""

Checks into the lodge at 2 am drops his new wife in the cabin and heads down to the dock for a 4 am start to fishing. He is gone all day and returns at 11 pm. The next morning, same thing, at the dock for 4 am and returns at 11 pm. The next day, same routine. The lodge owner notices this activity and is waiting for the guy at 4 am the next day. ""Are you not on your honeymoon?"" the owner asks. The fisherman responds,""why yes I am, why do you ask?. ""well, should you not be up there having intercourse with your new wife?""asks the owner. ""I can't do that, she has gonorhea.""responds the fisherman. ""well why not roll her over and have anal with her"" responds the owner. ""Well I can't do that she has diarehha as well."" responds the fisherman. ""Well how about a little oral ""responds the owner. ""Well, she has pyorhea as well"" responds the fisherman. ""If she has gonorhea, diarehea and pyorhea, why did you marry her?""asks the owner. Fisherman, ""well she has worms too and I like to do a little fishing now and then."
