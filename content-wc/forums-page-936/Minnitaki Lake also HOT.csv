More fish in or over the slot than under it. Average was about 20 inches with biggest near 27. All caught on jig/minnow drifting in 13 to 16 feet of water. Backtrolling with a crawler harness worked even better but I prefer jigging. No one was using leeches, though we all had some along just in case. Big mayfly hatch last Monday slowed things down for a few days.Weather was also HOT. Near 90F ever day with no clouds for two weeks. Cooled to a comfortable 55F at night though. Lake level was highest I've ever seen. At least two feet higher than last year. Waterline covers tree trunks closest to the water. No sand beaches anywhere and many logs floating everywhere. Everyone I talked to had hit at least one, but fortunately not one of the telephone pole sized ones. Those were easier to spot and avoid.Black flys were horrible when I got there two weeks ago, but only a problem for first two days."

Other? we stayed out on an island near the Rice river.would like to hear from you. If you like reply e-mail [email protected]"
