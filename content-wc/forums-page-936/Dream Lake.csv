522497,whitetip1,2002-07-15 12:56:00,53,"The group that I go to Canada with is looking for a lake that we would consider our ""Dream Lake"". The lake would have to have the following: Muskie (50"" potential), Walleye (size and #'s), Lake Trout and be manageable in size, cost and within resonable driving distance from the Twin Cities area. We have been to Rowan (excellent muskie and trout, poor walleye) and LacSeul (fantastic walleye, no lakers and limited muskie).Any suggestions?Dave"

522499,Guest,2002-07-16 10:54:00,0,"That would be one lake in northwestern Ontario. The Lake of the Woods without question. It's the only one that can fill the bill. It has big muskies, great walleye, and lakers in Whitefish and Clearwater Bays. More 50"" muskies caught in the Woods than all the rest of the lakes put together. However, the one problem is that not all species inhabit the same exact location."

522503,Guest,2002-07-16 11:47:00,0,"I Have the lake for you. Walleyes are plentiful and big,Lakers are giants and can be caught on every sandbar that is in 20 ft of water.. The Muskies all run 40 to 55"" long and are so aggressive they will attack the net when you net the one you have hooked. The outfitter is awesome and he only charges $100 per week per fisherman for the Amercian Plan. The lake is located in Fantasy ,Ontario and is called PERFECT LAKE......Good Luck"
