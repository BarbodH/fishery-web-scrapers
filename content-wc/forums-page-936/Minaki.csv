522351,iamwalleye1,2002-07-10 18:21:00,1589,http://www.lwcb.ca/This give the water levels. I still have yet to see anyone give a report all they do is ask. never give us a reprot. Maybe it is that bad.
522352,Guest,2002-07-11 06:49:00,0,"I can tell you first hand from my father I spoke to yesterday that the water level is higher than it was last year, 50+ inches higher than it was on June 8th and they are saying it could come up another 10 inches.......be carefull out there.Typicaly on this board some of the Minaki local yocals will give rose colored glass fishing reports, the fact that no one has chimed in on the water levels isn't a good sign."
522353,Guest,2002-07-11 08:45:00,0,"I was up there during the first week of July and we saw the water raise about 2"" a day but we were still catching fish. We weren't just fishing for walleye however, we enjoy casting for northern and bass most of the time but we did spend a few hours bouncing for walleye and we were able to catch enough for shore lunch and brought 6 back home with us. We didn't catch any big ones but we landed a few over 20"", we also caught several 20""+ walleye casting spinnerbaits. The current was pretty strong in the normal walleye spots but so we looked for areas that typically had little current.We also spent a few days musky fishing and were able to land five. We caught 21"", 22"", 33"", 40"", and a 48"". We had dozens of follows, many 50"" plus. I think we saw so many because the weather was warm and stable for five straight days, when it started to cool down towards the end of the week the musky did too. We were using mainly Perch colored suicks and shallow raiders. By brother caught the 48""er on a large white spinnerbait. Good luck next week!IPS"
522354,Guest,2002-07-11 09:08:00,0,"Just got back from Minaki on the 7th. Water levels are the highest I've seen in all my years of fishing there. Higher than last year,no question. Despite that, the fishing was quite good. Walleyes were in the weeds big time while we were there. Slowed down a bit at end of the week with mayfly hatch starting. With late spring and high water every thing seems to be set back a few weeks from normal. Roads were good on the way up. Must have been a mess earlier."
522355,Guest,2002-07-11 15:51:00,0,"We returned July 8th and water levels reminded me of last summer. I felt the walleyes were a little slow, however we did have good luck pulling crankbaits in the evening from bud's buoy all the way to burnt island. Several fish in the 20""-25"". I will say the northerns are about as good as we've seen for that time of the year. The mayflies were starting to arrive and I'm sure that will have some affects. Good Luck!"
522356,Guest,2002-07-17 10:58:00,0,I'm heading up this friday and I was wondering if anybody had any current info.
522357,Guest,2002-07-18 06:35:00,0,I've heard there are some nice walleye being caught right now. Fish in the opening and vicinity of Mine Bay.
