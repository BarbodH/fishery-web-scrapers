522612,Andyeye,2002-07-18 05:37:00,179,I have been to Canada many times but have never purchased anything at the duty free shop in Fort Francis. What is the procedure for purchasing a bottle of Crown Royal when entering Canada? Is it saving me any money? or should I just buy it beforehand and declare it at the border? Thanks for any information.

Also, smoking material, other bottle brands of booze (sometimes they have specials on certain brands), some perfume or cologne for the gals at home.At Pidgeon River (above Duluth)I stop at Rydens and get beef jerky--good and its cheap."

You stop at the duty free store in Ft. Frances when you are leaving Canada. I've never stopped on the way in but we always stop on the way out to pick up a case of LaBatts for about $12.00
