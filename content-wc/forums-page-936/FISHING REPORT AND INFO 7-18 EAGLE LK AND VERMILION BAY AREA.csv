522619,Guest,2002-07-18 12:56:00,0,"WHEW!THE WEATHER HAS BEEN EXTREMLY AND UNCHARACTERISTICALLY HOT THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS WITH TEMPS AVG.90+ DEGREES AND WATER SURFACE TEMPS PUSHING THE MID 70'S AND BEYOND DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE SYSTEM IN THE AREA OR PART OF EAGLE LAKE YOU'RE ON.THE MAYFLY HATCH HAS BEEN A LONG AND DRAWN OUT PROCESS THIS SEASON BECAUSE THE WATER TEMPS HAVE STAYED IN THE 70-74 DEGREE RANGE THOUGHOUT IT.THE NEWS IS FISHING HAS BEEN GOOD DESPITE THESE SETBACKS,WATER LEVELS ARE RETURNING TO NORMAL,WEED GROWTH IS CATCHING UP TO RELATIVLEY NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF THE SEASON,AND IT APPEARS THE HEAT WAVE IS OVER WITH THE RETURN OF NORMAL TEMPS IN THE HIGH 70'S AND LOW 80'S WITH NITETIME TEMPS IN THE LOW 70'S. THE HATCH APPEARS TO BE OVER.ACTUALLY OUR REPEAT BOOKINGS FOR NEXT YEAR WERE HIGHER DURING THIS TOUGH PERIOD % PER GUEST #'S IN CAMP THAN DURING THE REAL SUPER FISHING EARLIER IN JUNE.THE ONLY THING I CAN FIGURE IS PERHAPS IT SHOWS WE STEP UP INTERACTION WITH GUESTS EVEN A BIT MORE TO HELP GET YOU ON FISH DURING THE TOUGH TIMES.SUNDAY ROB MANTHEI (ONE OF THE BEST YOUNG GUIDES IN VILAS COUNTY AND ONE OF OUR GUEST INSTRUCTORS)AND DANNY FILMED A WALLEYE/LAKE TROUT SHOW WITH JOHN GILLESPIE OF THE WOODS AND WATERS TV SERIES TO BE AIRED THIS NEXT WEEK ON THE FOX SPORT NET N..CHECK IT OUT, THEY BOATED WALLEYES JIGGING ROCK POINTS AND CABBAGE WEEDS PICKING UP A FEW BONUS BASS BESIDES,TOOK A MID DAY BREAK AND DID SOME LAKE TROUT BOATING TROUT TO 22-25#'S BEFORE AN APPROACHING LIGHTNING STORM CHASED THEM OFF AND FINISHED THE DAY BY GOING OUT AFTER SUPPER AND FISHING A SUSPENDED WALLEYE BITE WITH A BUNCH OF FISH TO 26-28"" SHOWING THE WIDE RANGE OF PATTERNS AND PRESENTATIONS AVAILABLE TO EXPLORE.JOHN WILL BE BACK THIS FALL TO GO AFTER MUSKIE AND BIG PIKE WITH US.WATCH FOR THAT ONE ,IT WILL BE AN EXCITING SHOW AS MUSKIES ARE JOHNS FAVORITE QUARRY AND IT IS SCHEDULED FOR A PRIME TIME SEPT-0CT TROPHY HUNT.THIS REPORT WON'T BE ABOUT WHO CAUGHT WHAT THE PAST FEW WEEKS BUT WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THOSE CATCHES AND WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW AND VERY LIKELY THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS TO HELP PREPARE YOU FOR YOUR TRIP.WALLEYES-MANY DIFF PATTERNS TO EXPLORE,ANY OR ALL COULD BE THE TICKET DEPENDING ON THE WEATHER,TIME OF DAY,SECTION OF THE LAKE AND IT'S HABITAT.WITH THE HIGH,BRIGHT SKIES,HOT WEATHER AND RESULTING RAISING WATER TEMPS SOME FISH HAVE MOVED RIGHT INTO THE HEART OF THE HEAVIEST CABBAGE BEDS NEAR DEEP WATER.THE BIGGER AND THICKER THE BED AND THE BETTER THE BREAK IS TO DEEP WATER THE MORE WALLEYES WILL BE USING IT.THIS IS PRIMARILY A BIG FISH PATTERN WITH THE SMALLER FISH AND #'S OF FISH OFF THE BREAK AT 16-22'.THESE FISH ARE BEST WORKED WITH JIGS WITH A FRONT EYE TIE VS A 90 DEGREE TIE LIKE MOST BALL JIGS.MAKES THE JIGS EASY TO GET THROUGH THE WEEDS.SLO POKES AND OTHER WEEDLESS JIGS LIKE THE SLOW-FALL OR WEED WEASELS ARE PERFECT FOR THIS PRESENTATION.IF THE WEEDS ARE THICK WITH POCKETS PITCH MUCH LIKE BASS FISHING,IF THEY ARE TALL CABBAGE WORK THE JIG TILL IT BREAKS FREE AND FALLS TO THE BASE OF THE WEEDS WHERE THE FISH ARE LYING IN THE SHADE.BE SURE TO USE A STIFFER THAN NORMAL ROD AND A HIGH ABRASION RESISTANT LINE LIKE XT AND GET EM' UP AND OUT ONCE YOU SET THE HOOK.CRAWLERS AND LEECHES HAVE BEEN BEST.USUALLY AROUND WEEDS LEECHES HELP KEEP THE PESKY PERCH FROM ROBBING YOU TO OFTEN AND ON THE ROCKS MANY TIMES CRAWLERS WORK BETTER BECAUSE THE CRAWDAD SEASON IS STARTING.BEST TO HAVE BOTH,SOME CHUBS TOO,YOU NEVER KNOW.WORK THE EDGES IN THE EVENING JIGGING,CRANKING,AND BOTTOM BOUNCING FOR FAST ACTION.ON LAKES THAT THE WEEDS HAVE NOT COME UP GOOD OR THE FISH ARE JUST STARTING USING THEM OR EVEN IF THEY ARE TRY DOWNED TIMBER ESPECIALLY CEDARS ON STEEP SHORELINES WHERE THE TREES ARE DOWN IN AN AREA WHERE IT GOES FROM STEEP TO SHALLOW AREA OR FLATS CREATING AN INSIDE TURN.WALLEYES ARE STARTING TO BUNCH UP ON THE REEFS AND HUMPS MORE AND MORE EVERYDAY BECOMING A CONSISTANT PATTERN.THE BEST DEPTHS SEEM TO BE AROUND 16'22' BUT HAVE CAUGHT FISH DEEPER AND AS SHALLOW AS 2'RIGHT ON TOP SO IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO EXPERIMENT AND NOT GET CAUGHT UP ON ONE DEPTH RANGE ESPECIALLY DAY TO DAY AND LOOK FOR A DEEPER BITE TO START SOON.JIGGING,RIGGING,BOTTOM BOUNCING BOTH SPINNER RIGS WITH CRAWLER HARNESSES AND OR MINNOWBAITS,CASTING THE REEF TOPS AND TROLLING THE EDGES WITH SHAD RAPS OR OTHER DEEP DIVING CRANKS WILL ALL TAKE FISH DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION AND THE AGGRESSIVNESS OF THE FISH AT THE TIME.THE SUSPENDED FISH BITE IS HAPPENING FROM 8;00-10;00PM OVER 50-70FT OF WATER IN MAINLAKE BASINS.RUN SHALLOW RUNNING CRANKS LIKE #18 RAPS,YOZURI CRYSTAL MINNOWS,FAST TRACS,RATTL'N ROUGES,ETC.OFF BOARDS WITH 60-160 FT OF LINE FROM THE BOARD TO THE BAITS, LONGER EARLIER IN THE EVENING, SHORTER TOWARDS EVENING BRINGING THE BAITS HIGHER.TRY RUN A STORM DEEP THUNDER STICK,STRETCH MANNS OR OTHER DEEP DIVERS DOWN ABOUT 18-28'AS A FLAT LINE EARLIER IN THE EVENING ALSO.MOST OF THESE FISH WILL BE 22""-30"" SO PLEASE PRACTICE C/R AS THESE ARE THE PRIME SPAWNERS,HAVE BEEN LITERALLY UNTAPPED AND UNPRESSURED FOR YEARS,AND SINCE THEY ARE BEING CAUGHT ON ARTIFICIALS AND ARE ONLY 6'-20' DOWN WHEN THEY ARE BITING THEY ARE TOTALLY RELEASABLE.IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SPEND A LEISURLY EVENING ON THE WATER WITH A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET AFTER A LONG DAY ON THE WATER AND CATCH A FEW QUALITY FISH WITHOUT ALOT OF COMPANY.BASS-SCATTERED MORE THAN IN JUNE ALONG ROCKY RUBBLE/AND OR WEED COMBO BREAKLINES IN DEEPER BAYS AND ISLAND CLUSTERS BUT STILL VERY CATCHABLE,SOME OF THE BIGGEST COMING INCIDENTALLY WHILE WALLEYE FISHING.TUBE JIGS,CAROLINA RIGGED 4"" WORMS,AND CRAWDAD CRANKS DOING THE TRICK.WE'VE HAD SEVERAL GROUPS REPORT CATCHES OF 75-100 FISH WITH THE AVG SIZE DOWN SOMEWHAT FROM JUNE BUT STILL PICKING UP FISH IN THE 17-19"" RANGE.TROUT-NOT MANY CONCENTRATING ON THEM BUT WHY I DON'T KNOW.BEST BIG FISH BITE OF THE SEASON GOING ON RIGHT NOW,DANNY HAD TWO DAYS LAST WEEK GUIDING PEOPLE TO A DOZEN OR MORE FISH PER TRIP WITH 3-4 EACH DAY FROM 18-25#'S.CLEO'S,AND CRANKS BLUE/SILVER AND WHITE BEST COLORS AT 60-80FT,BEST DAYS BEEN SUNNY AND WINDY OFF THE WINDY SIDE BREAKS AND SHELVES.PIKE-LOTS OF SMALL-MED SIZE (22""-38"")CASTING WEED BEDS AND REEDS,LENNY TARGETED BIG PIKE ON A GUIDE DATE LAST WEEK AND FOUND THEM AS DEEP AS 42' OFF DEEP POINTS AND BREAKS SO THAT RIGHT THERE TELLS YOU WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE BIG PIKE.THE ONLY WAY YOU WILL GET THEM WHEN THEY ARE THIS DEEP IS WITH BIG LIVE BAIT AND WIRE SNELL RIGS PREFERABLY WITH QUICKSETS, VERTICAL JIGGING,OR TRY TROLLING WITH STRETCH MANNS 30+.TARGET THE EDGES AND BASES OF THE BIG REEFS,AND POINTS IN THE MAINLAKE BASINS NEAR SCHOOLS OF BAITFISH.OCCASIONALLY A BIG PIKE IS CAUGHT INCIDENTLY WHILE CASTING MUSKIES MOSTLY ON SPINNERBAITS AND JERKBAITS NEAR THE MOUTHS OF LARGE BAYS AND ON ROCK PILES IN OR NEAR DEEP WATER.THE FLY-INS WERE WE CAN TARGET DARKER DIRTIER SHALLOW WATER RIVER SYSTEMS ARE A DIFF STORY.THOSE HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT AND NOW THAT THE WATER LEVELS ARE DROPPING ON THE RIVER SYSTEMS WE 4WD DRIVE SAFARI INTO WE WILL BE ABLE TO TARGET THEM MORE CONSISTANLY IN THE NEAR FUTURE.MUSKIE-LOTS OF FISH BOATED SINCE LAST REPORT (152 registered since last report with only a few fishing them)but avg size is down somewhat at this point.big girls starting to gear up past week or so,weeds are looking good now and fish using them big time but the rocks,reefs,walls,and points are showing signs of coming to life especially for the larger muskies.all summer patterns should be looked into and checked including suspended and deeper humps during the day along with heavy slop and breaklines.best shallow activity has been am and pm due to the hot flat weather with alot of slow follows after and before during mid day.topwaters,bucktails,dogs,and jakes been moving most fish.with the arrival of some wind to mix up the water,some fronts moving in,and the more typical weather things should bust wide open.the darker water drive to lakes in the area have been steady in producing lots of fish 33""-42"" including some nice tigers but even these are slow on the hot flat days with topwater action happening towards dark.GOOD LUCK TO ALL THOSE COMING TO CANADA AND TO THOSE COMING TO SEE US SOON WE LOOK FORWARD TO IT.IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING A TRIP WE HAVE SEVERL OPENINGS JULY 27-AUG 3,1 OVER LABOR DAY WEEK, AND SCATTERED OPENINGS IN SEPT-EARLY OCT WHICH WE ARE OFFERING A 10% DISC OFF ANY PKG OR A FREE GUIDE DATE PER 3 IN A BOAT.SEPT IS PRIME TIME FOR TROPHY MUSKIE,WALLEYE,AND PIKE,ALONG WITH A VERY OVERLOOKED SMALLMOUTH BITE THAT IS SECOND ONLY TO THE SPAWNING SEASON IN #'S WITH A LARGER AVG. SIZE THAN ANY TIME OF THE YEAR.WE CAN BE REACHED AT [email protected] or 888 727 5865 and researched at http://www.andymyerslodge.comTHE FISH ARE JUMP'N AND THE SCALES ARE FLY'N!!STEVE HERBECKANDY MYERS LODGE"
