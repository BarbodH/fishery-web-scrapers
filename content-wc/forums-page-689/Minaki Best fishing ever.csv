559362,Guest,2006-07-13 09:40:00,0,Bob S I am going up to the Winnipeg in the middle of August. Would you give me a idea of the location? Thanks
559364,Guest,2006-07-13 09:52:00,0,...I think he took his rod and went home... Good luck -- hope the weather cools a bit for you!!
559366,Guest,2006-07-13 10:08:00,0,I think he is busy tending bar at Pardise Cove. :rotflmao:
559367,Guest,2006-07-13 10:19:00,0,I would bet a buck on the rough rock narrows area. Lots of hardly fished holes in that whole stretch. Not to mention some good musky in there
559370,IaCraig,2006-07-13 11:43:00,434,"Could be, that is the 1st place I thought of too only my favorite spot on it wasn't 28 - 35 ft deep in normal years. I went there last year and the water was so high I barely recognized it and all I caught were saugers & dinks in the moving water. In that river system it could be any number of places upstream from Minaki too. I'm heading up the 29th for some family fun. :D IaCraig"
559379,Guest,2006-07-13 15:11:00,0,Ha ha ha! That was pretty funny.
559414,woods,2006-07-15 13:05:00,646,Well said!
559530,iamwalleye1,2006-07-19 17:50:00,1589,"Craig Are you ready to go? I know the nights are short and the days are long, Let us know how you do! Have fun and be safe. Take some Rapala's #9 pearl white, The kids will love the night bite up on Big sand! I also had very good luck on perch #9 Rapala's!"
559233,IaCraig,2006-07-10 17:14:00,434,"Wow, already? I thought the longlining didn't usually get good until much later in the summer! :-) I'm anxious to get back up there, if the summer tactics are working now I'm guessing the water is still low and everything is ahead by a couple weeks. How about the bays, are they getting real weedy already too? My kids love casting them for little northerns, but with low water I'm guessing my normal haunts for that will be too weedy by the time I get there in 3 weeks. IaCraig"
559236,Guest,2006-07-10 19:13:00,0,I'd say everything is about three weeks ahead up there. From what I was told the trolling bite on Big Sand is just getting started but not large numbers of fish like you will see by the first of August. There will be plenty of weed growth when you get there.
559241,Guest,2006-07-10 20:49:00,0,That is sad that you think so.
559250,phaffy12,2006-07-11 01:37:00,9,"That's too bad when somebody posts a great report and has to get chastised for killing ""the last walleyes."" Keep it up Bob, I fish the same kind of spots on the Winnipeg and they're always deep, but I rarely see a swim bladder in the back of their mouth until I start pulling them out of 40 foot plus water."
559257,Guest,2006-07-11 08:54:00,0,The last walleye was Eagle food! That is great at least the eagle are getting fed!
559260,Guest,2006-07-11 11:34:00,0,"As a rule we don't fish for walleye over 35'. People who fish with ultra lite rods and play the fish to the end kill more fish , AND why would anyone throw a walleye to the eagles for food ????? That's unreal early for suspended walleye's. We took a pile of rap's to a body shop and had them painted pearl. They out fish every other lure 3 to 1 for us. As a note in the one chance we fished the current we caught a 58 pound sturgeon. 30' feet of water..."
559279,Guest,2006-07-11 22:14:00,0,"I can't help but feel sorry for some people who have never learned the proper way to fish, they miss out on so much great fishing and it seems that they are so bitter about being poor fishermen that they feel that the only way to make themselfs feel better is to try and spoil the moment for the guys who can catch fish. I would like to thank all of you that took the time to send a positive reply to my report, but I will not be responding to anymore replys on this as I just want to rember one of the best weekends of fishing in my 45 years of learning and honing my skils of this sport. Thanks again Bob S."

When they come up out of the deep the air bladder is FULL. When you fish killer's let them go without fizzing them they will float up and then become EAGLE FOOD!! > >That's unreal early for suspended walleye's.

559297,Guest,2006-07-12 08:45:00,0,"but the Eagles have to eat to, don't be so stingy with your walleye."

559187,Guest,2006-07-09 22:04:00,0,":7 :7 Before I start to write this let me just say that I know I'll be getting reply after reply saying that what I'm about to tell you is made up or that I'm one of the camp onwers in Minaki or that I'm simply on some kind of weird drugs or some other negitive replys, to you people all I can says is that if you don't try this it's your loss. i just had the best weekend of fishing in my 30 plus years of fishing Minaki. I was fishing with a friend of mine from the US and he took me to a spot I've never fished before, now this spot is in some very strong current we were using 1& 1/2 oz bottom walkers to get us down to the bottom between 28 35 ft. On saturday we fished from about 11 am to 4 pm and boated what I estimated to be about 80 to 100 walleyes. Yes you read it right I said 80 to 100 with about 2/3 of them being in the slot. On sunday we of course went back to the same spot and got there at 10 am I wanted to see just how many fish we would catch so I started to count every wally we landed we fished until 4 pm when we ran out of bait and I counted 152 landed fish that dose not include the ones we lost just what was brought into the boat. I was using leeches and Kevin was using crawlers and we caught just about 1 for 1 but the way they were biteing I think you could of used any bait. Now for those of you who have being saying the fishing is gone from Minaki all I can say is you had better try and find some fast water and try again. If you can't fish well in fast water just find a spot where there is a bottom break that drops sharply and drop an ancor this will hold you over this spot. After this weekend I will never again accept anyone saing the fishing is dead in the Winnipeg river, just get out there and try a few different places and you will find them. Good luck. Bob S"
559190,Guest,2006-07-10 07:23:00,0,You must have found my spot...dangit!
559198,Guest,2006-07-10 09:36:00,0,Bob s Does thet stand for BS.
559200,Guest,2006-07-10 10:01:00,0,"With the water so low, where is there fast moving current?"
559201,Guest,2006-07-10 10:11:00,0,Way too go I was up for 4 days during last week. We didn't do nearly as good. With the kids in the boat I stay away from the current areas. I can think of one area that could produce fish like that. Keep that spot a secret!
559205,Guest,2006-07-10 10:25:00,0,....Bob..I was being serious. I never fish where everyone else does. Congrats on the good fishing. Can't wait to get back up there.
559207,Guest,2006-07-10 11:47:00,0,I wonder how many fish you killed with air bladders coming out of their mouths...
559224,Guest,2006-07-10 16:04:00,0,Just spoke with someone today who boated a 28 and 30 incher in the same evening trolling up on Big Sand.
559226,Guest,2006-07-10 16:08:00,0,Not a single one! Maybe you don't know how to bring a fish out of 35 feet of water but I can assure you I do. A-H
559227,Guest,2006-07-10 16:11:00,0,Yea I heard that the longlining bite has being going great for about 4 days
