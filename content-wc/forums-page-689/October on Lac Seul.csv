Because of current jigs may need to be a little heavier 3/4 to 1 oz. The lightest you can get to the bottom with. We do some drifting but most of the time we anchor or use the motor to keep boat in zone...I think anchoring is most productive because when the fish are active they move through the area feeding and they will come to you. There are bait shops in Ear Falls on the right side of road off of main highway. Good Luck, Mike Kansas PS we will be there sept 16-23 at Little Canada Camp/ main lodge. Any other questions email me if you want[email protected]"
559533,Sutsgold,2006-07-19 18:25:00,219,"Mike, thanks for all the info. I am definetly going to make the trip. Excited already. Are there other spots I can boat to if that spot is not working at that time of year? Brad"
559537,Guest,2006-07-19 20:04:00,0,"The public boat launch for the Ear Falls end of Lac Seul is at the end of Hwy 657. From the 4 Seasons sports shop go about 3 miles to the end of the road. The parking lot is just across the road. As was mentioned before, you may be the only one out there."
559538,Guest,2006-07-19 20:25:00,0,"Has anyone tried chamberlain narrows, bear narrows, or senn bay that time of year? I have heard once the chamberlain narrows can be fantastic that time of year, but it would be one heck of a trip up there."
559540,Guest,2006-07-19 21:40:00,0,"Suts, Send me your address and I will be happy to send you a map of the area with the spots that have been good to us.[email protected] Mike Kansas"
559474,Sutsgold,2006-07-17 18:52:00,219,Does anyone have any experience fishing on Lac Seul in late October? I will be up there the 3rd weekend of October and am curious if heading out there would be a worhtwhile experience.
559482,Guest,2006-07-18 01:04:00,0,"Yes, I have been out there until the middle (2nd, 3rd week of October). The volume of fish on later-season spots starts to drop-off in October, but they are there. I've found fish holding more often to rocky or rock-sand structure that late, and mega-sand structure has much lower volume than in July through September. For the most part, fish are in 22'-40'. From my Bay of Quinte days in S. Ontario as a kid, the walleyes come back up fairly shallow, especially at night, cruising along the deep edges of dying weedbeds in October. I haven't seen this as much on Seul. I've tried a myriad of such places in late-September-October, and it's been very hit and miss. You're best bet is probably exposed windward points or shorelines, offering rock and rock-sand transition in the 20'-40' range, and close to deep water (minimum 50'+). I'm not sure which part of the lake you're headed to, but it's starting to get mighty cold and very quiet out there, particularly if you're in the more-isolated, central part of the lake. Go prepared for the conditions possible at that time of year! NWO Fishing Bum"
559486,Mike Kansas,2006-07-18 08:40:00,1463,"Sutsgold, We fish below the Dam at Ear Falls in the fall of the year. Have done very well with the Walleye moving up river to the Dam in the fall to forage up for the winter. We stay at Little Canada Camp which is a mile or so below the Dam. (First left after Dam when going north into Ear Falls) You might want to give it a try it has been great.www.littlecanadacamp.com Good Luck, Mike kansas"
559487,Sutsgold,2006-07-18 09:32:00,219,"Im staying around the dryden area, and am open to any of the sections of the lake provided there is still a possibility to catch fish. We have never fished that late in the year up there, so I am quite unfamiliar locations and techniques."
559489,Mike Kansas,2006-07-18 09:59:00,1463,"You are a couple of hours from Ear Falls when you are at Dryden. Might be too far for you to go to Little Canada Camp but in October. You would have a real chance of catching a 28"" +++ Walleye there and if they are running a boat load of them. Might be a good one day trip. Good Luck, Mike Kansaswww.littlecanadacamp.com"

Go >prepared for the conditions possible at that time of year! Amen to that, brother. I fish LOTW out of a boat-in camp every year in mid-October and although I love it and the fishing can be great, we'll go hours at a time without seeing another boat or hearing any radio traffic. It's not unusual for us to be the only fishermen in camp along with duck and moose hunters. And we always see snow at some point during the trip."
559492,Mike Kansas,2006-07-18 11:22:00,1463,"Rockpt, I agree. We have been fall fishing for years in Canada and have had our share of snowball fights in the boats. We fish the English River right below the Dam at Ear Falls, Ontario and we are ten minutes from warmth and shelter. Big Lake has more challenges that time of year. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
559508,orchard frank,2006-07-18 22:29:00,1900,"Never been there that late, but the English River below Pelican Falls was loaded with fish when I was there the last 2 weeks of Sept. one year. That area would be accessable from the Hudson launch, if it is still in use that late. Pack lots of clothes and drain your motor every night. Good Luck"
559510,Sutsgold,2006-07-19 08:04:00,219,"Is there a public boat launch near the ear falls ####? That sounds like it might be worth it for a day to make the trip. We are about 15 minutes out of vermillion bay, so the ride shouldnt be that unbearable. What are the techniques you use at this time of year? If minnows, is there a bait shop up there that sells at that time?"
559513,Guest,2006-07-19 10:47:00,0,"Sutsgold, There is a public boat launch at Ear Falls. Go to the North end of town on the highway and you will see a boat launch sign on your left. It is about a mile down the road after you turn and it is very adequate. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
