Does anyone know of any motels within 10 to 15 miles on either side of the border, other than the Grand Portage Casino? (afraid I will lose all my minnow money!) We are afraid that trying to make Thunder Bay may be too much if we get held up at all at the border. Any info would be greatly appreciated!!!"

There are several motels to choose from, we stay in a motel across the street from a grocery store, sorry the name escapes me now, but we buy our butter, bread,eggs etc. for our stay at Young Lake Lodge near Silver Dollar."

There are several small motels near Kakabeka Falls that are popular with fisherman. Good luck with Press, I used to fish it about 20years ago, now fish the other lakes near by. Press in good for numbers lots of 15inchers with a bigger fish every once in a while. I take it you are staying at press lake camp? I think that is the only resort on the lake now. We spent most of our time fishing in and around the English river. Many good lakes to fish in the Silver dollar area. good luck GF"
559477,Guest,2006-07-17 21:26:00,0,"thanks for the info...I think I will check out Kakabeka Falls...yes, this will be our first year above Ignace, other than one year at Cozy Camp. We fished Wabby for many years and were up for a change...las year we fished the Seine by Atikokan....but really tough to catch a walleye!!! Good smallies though. Any lakes right around Press that you fish for larger fish???"
