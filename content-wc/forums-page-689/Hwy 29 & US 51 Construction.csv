559534,Skyraptor,2006-07-19 18:34:00,291,I live in St. Point and the construction continues but traffic has been moving pretty steady through Wausau on I39. Best to not try and drive on I39/29 during morning or even rush hour as traffice does stop sometiems. I usually take a short-cut through Marathon City or look at taking hwy 10 to 94 up to Eau Claire.
