Car thermometer said temp was 101. Just wanted to pass it along to those getting ready to go, and wondered if anyone had heard anything as to why the long delay. Line was at least twice as long and slow as I've seen it in 26 trips, yet the traffic on the roads and in the duty-free made me feel like the traffic count was actually down a little this year."
559456,Guest,2006-07-17 11:49:00,0,"We had the same problem. Got there at 9:30 AM, usually only half hour wait or less. This time it was two hours. Someone said one of the scanning machines was broke. Several other groups at the restaurant we stopped at in Int Falls said it was much slower than usual. What are they scanning for anyway? How do these things work? Regards, RSH >We crossed from Canada to US at Ft Frances last Sat AM. The >line started at the Welcome to Ft Frances sign west of town, >and we waited over 3 hours.

Inside is what looks like an electric company line truck. The boom is up and at the top center there is a scanner module mounted on the boom. You pull into the building, the person outside will talk to the operator via 2-way and signal that he is ready to scan. The scanning starts at the trailer tongue and you creep forward at idle speed and they have a picture of the contents of your boat. You can see this same picture at the airport when they scan your luggage. The permanent building is under construction."
559485,MoWalleyeguy,2006-07-18 08:21:00,409,We crossed both ways over the week of July 4th and didnt experience much in the way of delays. When we went into Canada on Saturday morning it took maybe 5 minutes. I think the main thing for us is we drive to International Falls and spend the night and the next morning we are right there able to cross. We made the trip through right at 8am and there was no line at all. I think it gets backed up from then on all day. Key- get there before 8am! Coming back we got to the bordercrossing at about 8:35am and there was a 25 minute wait and we could see it backing up FAST behind us. Its a 2 1/2 hour drive to the border for us so we get on the road fairly early on the trip home.
559500,Guest,2006-07-18 17:14:00,0,We left camp at 2:30 AM and drove the 4 hours to the border. We got to the Safeway grocery store parking lot and took a snooze until 7 AM when the duty free shop opened to collect our GST rebate. I was first in line. It took 4 minutes to get the rebate and we were on our way. The end of the line was at the north end of the railroad bridge and all 3 lanes were open. Didn't take very long at all. It may have helped matters along when we handed them our passports. The number of questions asked seemed to be cut in half.
