559493,Guest,2006-07-18 11:25:00,0,Does anybody have a good source for Looped Spinner Baits. Got to have some that I can use a leader with. THANKS
559496,Guest,2006-07-18 15:02:00,0,"I always just use a bass style spinner for pike and had the same problem. I used to use a rubber band at the end and use a leader. I found the Hank Parker spinnerbaits have that loop. Work great. You can find them anywhere...Cabela's, Bass Pro or Dick's"
559498,Guest,2006-07-18 15:22:00,0,Thanks Dave....they look perfect.
559499,Guest,2006-07-18 16:02:00,0,"Just buy whatever spinnerbait you want. Then buy some small shrink tube. Cut off a small portion, slide it over the bend in the spinnerbait,heat it, clip on your leader and go catcha big one. Very easy to do and worked great. Give it a try."
559509,Guest,2006-07-19 06:19:00,0,"Or, just carry an assortment of small split rings. Pop a split ring over the ""R"" bend of the spinnerbait, clip on your leader to the portion of the ""R"" that is stuck thru the split ring and your good to go!! Been doing it this way for years and works great! Hawker"
559511,Guest,2006-07-19 10:17:00,0,Yep the split ring works great. Don't forget it will fall off into the bottom of the boat when you take the spinner bait off you leader.
559512,Guest,2006-07-19 10:42:00,0,Thanks for all the great info. I will try the split ring technique. I had used rubber bands in the past but it didnt work to well. Thanks Again
