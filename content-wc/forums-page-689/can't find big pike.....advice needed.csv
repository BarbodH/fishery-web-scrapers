559554,ksboy2,2006-07-20 12:13:00,38,"i just got back from a fly in with showalters outfitters. we fished apps and meddick lakes which are about 100 air miles north of red lake. we caught tons of walleye, lakers, and small northern. i was hoping to get into some big pike. this was my fourth trip up and i have never had trouble catching fish in the 30-36"" range. i was hoping to snag into some 40 plus inch fish. not to be! i talked to a guy who fished the lake in early june and he caught four fish over 40 inches on a five day trip. i tried every trick i knew to catch a big pike. i fished bays back. front, middle....i had lots of follows, but no takers. i fished windy points.......drop offs......reefs........i even deep trolled with three way setups. no big fish. i am thinking the unseasonable hot weather up north has put the bigguns down deep, even this far north.... i sure would appreciate any advice on catching big pike during hot weather. ps: my next trip will be booked for early june. i want one of those hogs. haha kirk miller mapleton,ks"

559555,Guest,2006-07-20 12:33:00,0,"We found that big pike were down deeper this year than in previous years in late-June. Early ice-out, warmer water temperatures and a generally milder spring have the season about 3 to 4 weeks earlier than what we'd normally expect. Large pike were generally absent from the bays and entrance to bays, but were instead found either suspending at 10-20' in/over deeper water near large schools of forage, or suspended along the side of vertical rock ledges. Even so, we still caught a lot of larger pike (36""-44"") by trolling deep-diving cranks, snap-jiggin minnow baits off the bottom when they were holding to that structure, or using tube jigs with heavier jig heads swum down and over the top of them. We would often see a group of 3 or 4 on our sonar, and used that as an opportunity to work them vertically, or would mark them on the GPS and troll over them later. The pattern we observed with the bigger pike this year was what we'd generally expect in late-July or early-August in Minaki. We also observed that the musky were extremely active in late-June, which again doesn't typically occur until early-August. ...just our experience this year. Chuck"

You know what they say about advice, it is worth what you pay for it, so here's my 2 cents worth. The best pike fishing usually comes in August, July is simply good. This may have something to do with the amount of light because in August the difference in the daylight is not too great perhaps an hour more up north. In July it can get light enough to fish as early as 4:00 am and not too dark until well after 11:00. You need to be on the water at these times of day, take a break in middle of the day and head back out after supper. The weather seems to be fairly consistent in August and the cabbage beds are at their height. July the air may be warm but the water is still cold and a really large fish may be a bit lethargic. The weather is the big factor in choosing when and where to fish. If it's cloudy and raining then don't waste your time on pike, go after the walleye's instead. I've only caught one large pike under these circumstances. Wind with perhaps 2-3 foot waves I would try to anchor off a rocky point near a cabbage patch. Look for minnows getting tossed into the rocks and pike will usually be nearby. You can also use large jigs in these conditions. Try to stand off and cast shallow to deep with your lure coming back to the cabbage. You'll take a beating from the waves but this is a good time to hook up a monster pike. Light wind with perhaps a ripple. I would head for a stream feeder. Try to fish the cabbage near the stained water coming into the lake. I like to troll big bays with lots of cabbage. Always keep an eye open for swirls and splashes in the water. When pike are chasing minnows this can tip you off to a great experience. I've also noticed that if a bunch of boats are clustered over a cabbage area then fish the perimeter. Pike will sometimes move into these areas when there's a lot of fishing pressure. Good Luck,"
