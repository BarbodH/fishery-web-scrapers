Then we got to Fort Frances and wait for 1 hour to cross the border. took us 15 hours to get home vs 12 1/2 to get there. I've gone to Canada each of the past 15 years and have decided never to cross in international falls again. Also no more boat-ins. Too much hassle. I'll pay the extra money and fly-in. Which means, I'll cross in Pigeon River from now on."

We were not pulling a boat. The officer was polite and asked where we stayed and specifically what fish (if any) we had. Once I told him we were at Stanleys for a week, and that we had to dig for our conservation licenses, he took a quick look in the cooler at our well marked fish and we were on our way without having to show licenses. We got to the border crossing about 7:30 am and waited only 20 minutes or so."

559463,Guest,2006-07-17 14:58:00,0,Where was the check held? Do they ever hold these on Fridays?
559465,Trailerguy,2006-07-17 15:45:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Fridays and Saturdays they set up check points all summer long, various places, 105,502 even 71 at times, it can take as much as an hour and they usually have some OPP in the crowd as well. Just plan for the inconvience. They check at the bridge in Fort Francis sometimes as well. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

559470,idapaul,2006-07-17 16:29:00,82,went thru that check and it was no problem for us or my bro in the other vehicle but it seemed like it was for anybody pulling a boat. they just asked if we had fish and we never do so they let us on thru. opp was there checking for seat belts and drinking. when asked about drinking i just told him 10 am was too early. seemed satisfied with that and let us thru

559518,Guest,2006-07-19 13:13:00,0,Where was the check located?
559532,Sutsgold,2006-07-19 18:23:00,219,Absolutly. If you are restricted on how many fish you bring over the border the feeling is that you will stay in Minnesota and spend your vacation money on the lodges there.
559612,woods,2006-07-21 13:20:00,646,The check was about 20 ft. after they (US) question you when you enter the US.
