Water temps were in the 70's.Fishing was tough for us, we could not bring ourselves to anchor and jig the walleye holes,we lost alot of hardware to the trees trolling or drifting.We caught more big pike,over 31"" and bass over 19""then we ever did, but they were few and far between.We caught the pike on plugs, it was rare to catch three pike on the same lure,or color, caught my biggest pike 35""on a walleye rapala did'nt catch anything else on it. Spoons in red/white, purple/silver,green/white worked.Plugs were all different colors, white spinner baits worked for the smaller pike.The walleye were caught on spinner rigs hammered silver worked the best but we lost alot of them.The locals and regulars caught more walleyes jigging the holes,we did not have the paintence(sp)or touch for that type of fishing.The Chain is the most secnic lakes I have ever seen flat calm water, islands ,I took a roll of film just of the lakes.All in all it was a great trip Terry"
