559278,Hammerhead Herb,2006-07-11 22:13:00,259,Heading to Ear Falls in about a week. Will probably be in Dryden about dinner time. Any recommendations for restaurants there?

559286,Skylane,2006-07-12 06:17:00,101,"I agree with Riverview, there really are not any other places in town to get a nice evening meal. Riverview is located on the west side of town, on the emmediate east side of the river, just south of the wood mill (Weyerhaeuser). I have always thought that there was a void and Dryden could use another higher end restaurant, though I am not sure the town could support it. Maybe NWO fishing bum could open one up in his spare time this winter."

559471,Skylane,2006-07-17 16:30:00,101,"They are good, but the problem is I don't think they are open in the evenings."
559490,Hammerhead Herb,2006-07-18 10:45:00,259,I've got the locations for Kupper's and Riverview. Does anyone have a location/address for Restaurante Pizzeria? Thanx for the info.
559494,Skylane,2006-07-18 12:33:00,101,53 Princess ST. probably not over five blocks east of Riverview. Sits on the North side of the street.
