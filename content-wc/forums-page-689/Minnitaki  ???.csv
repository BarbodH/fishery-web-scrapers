We all caught our limits in walleye, >northern, and smallies, but worked for everyone of them. Fishing was tough for the best sized eaters, 16 - 18 inches. Had to resort to keeping some 14 inchers the last two days, got lots of these. Also got more walleyes over the slot than in past years, all from Redpine. Weather was very hot, and water level is low, could barely get from Butterfly Lake out into Minnitaki."
559539,lazyk,2006-07-19 21:29:00,26,How big of a boat do you have? I`m a little concerned about getting from Butterfly Lake into the big lake as we will be going in a month. How was the camp? This will be our first time up. lazyk

We could just barely get through by planing down, trimming up, and putting the passengers all the way forward. In places there were only 1.5 ft of water below the transducer, and the prop would chew up the bottom. Others said they could go thru on plane, we could not. There were no real big boats in camp the week we were there, the biggest was maybe 17.5 ft. The channel branches in several places - the natural creek is more circuitous, the path choppped thru by boats (when the water is high) is straighter. We did better by taking the more circuitous paths, they are a little deeper. There are also lots of rocks exposed I did not know about. There is a really bad one just east of the north passsage between Burnthut Island and the mainland, close to the island. I must have gone right past it 50 times in past years on the way to Troutfish Bay. Hope you have a good trip."

559610,Guest,2006-07-21 11:44:00,0,">where did u guys find the smallies? any size to them >Terry Sorry Terry, we only got one smallmouth all week. That's par for us on Minnitaki. For some reason, we don't get many smallmouth. We never go for them specifically, but you'd think we get more while fishin for walleyes and northerns."
559614,GreNation,2006-07-21 13:33:00,4,">where did u guys find the smallies? any size to them >Terry All I can say about the smallies is they were footballs. we caught several mainly in the 16-17 inch range. We had great luck taking a crawler on a bait hook with the smallest split shot about 6 inches up from the hook. We were targeting fallen timber, just cast so you line hits the tree or right next to it and let it slowly fall down, jigging it along the conture of the structure, it was common to find 2 or even 3 very nice sized smallies within one piece of structure."
