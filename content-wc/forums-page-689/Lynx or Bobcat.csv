559601,Trailerguy,2006-07-21 06:58:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Both are common in that area, but full grown Lynx are larger than that, and their legs are longer, which puts the body higher off the ground. Their primary food source is the Hare, so they are built for speed like a greyhound. Bobcats are built more in the porportions of a house cat, and don't seem as shy. I've seen more Bobcats over the years in midday hunting voles and other small creatures. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
559609,Guest,2006-07-21 11:11:00,0,From the size you describe it sounds like a Bobcat to me. We have lots of them where I live. Have had them on my deck making faces at my dogs through the sliding glass door. LOL! (The dogs were pretty vocal in their displeasure about the situation).
559611,Guest,2006-07-21 12:47:00,0,I've seen a lynx once and it was very shy and about the size of a coyote with a distinct gray coat and black tipped tail. It was standing over a dead jack rabbit. The size you describe sounds like a bobcat. I've seen lots of bobcats and they have a splotched straw color to their coats and quite fast for their size. They are more often heard than seen.
