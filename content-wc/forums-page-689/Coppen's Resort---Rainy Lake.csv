559566,Guest,2006-07-20 17:14:00,0,"We stayed at Coppens the week of June 17th-24th, we probably caught more than 50 smallies in the middle of the day(we fished for walleyes early & late in the day) everyday by casting Mepps spinners & crankbaits around islands/reefs or any rocky shoreline for that matter. Walleyes were much tougher to catch consistently because of numerous cold fronts & a mayfly hatch. Best methods for us was bottom bouncers w/ spinners and leeches and trolling DEEP DIVING crankbaits. We seemed to catch most of our walleyes in the 16ft depths early in the week, with the ""eyes"" moving deeper as the week went along, as our best success was between 24-30 ft deep at the end of the week. Very few bites on jigs/leech presentation with almost all fish being smallies. Slip bobbers on the same ""humps"" we trolled across for walleyes again produced almost all bass. We also caught lots of northerns casting, with the biggest one being 36"", but, dozens of 22""-28"" northerns everyday(I think my net still has slime in it but the 2 kids seemed to have fun) Biggest walleye was 26.5"" & smallie was 20"". I think you'll have better luck with walleyes now that the mayfly hatch is over(hopefully) and if your struggling catching ""eyes"", the lake is full of smallies & northerns. Good luck to you & save some for us next year:)"
