The bigger fish seemed to be easier to find and we caught over 100+ during the 6 days OVER 20"" with the largest being 28"". (2 fisherman) Note- last year guys were saying Walleye fishing was way off and blamed the netting, etc. Last year hands down for US was the BEST we could ever remember. This year is even better because of the average size. Its all in how you fish and where you are going. We found the big girls out on the main lake humps. 23-29'. I would use my gps to find the humps and then use my depth finder to find the little edges and drops. This seemed to be key. Sure there are fish on the flat parts of the humps, but many more can be found on the edges at times. The transition points seemed to be key."
