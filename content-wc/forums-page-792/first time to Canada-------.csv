Something like a passport or a birth certificate. Does anyone know if adoption papers would qualify as proof?? I would hate to get to the border and not be able to go. thanks in advance for any thoughts on this.

If you get involved with an auto accident in Canada, you'll need to confirm your auto insurance coverage, and there is a specfic card for this purpose that your insurance agent can provide to you - it doesn't matter if the auto accident is your fault or not, you'll need to provide proof of current auto insurance at the scene. Good luck with your trip - should be a great time for you (no bugs and the fish on a fall bite ! (hopefully) Faith, Family, Friends........and Fishing ! RHB (Rich B)"

She could also grant permission for you to seek medical help and hospitization for the children if necessary. On the same line, if you have nieces, nephews or unrelated children traveling with you have written and notarized authorization from the parents or guardians. The written and notarized authorization should also include phone numbers where the stay at home parent(s) can be reached in case the authorities want check it out. Driver's license plus birth certificate for those old enough. For younger children birth certificate plus some form of photo id. Some states can provide these at there driver license centers. Possibly the child's school has a photo id card that will qualify. If you and the others have valid passports, you should be good to go."
