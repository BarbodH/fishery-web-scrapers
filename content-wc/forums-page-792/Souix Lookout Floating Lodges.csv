We have always stayed on a houseboat at the other end of the lake by Manitoba & Stoney Points on the west side of the lake but were thinking about trying the east side of Lac Seul for a change. FIshing is really good up by the Manitoba & Stoney Point area, is the fishing good on this end of the lake too. Any information is greatly appreciated and thank you in advance."
