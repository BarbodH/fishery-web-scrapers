We'll be staying at the Thunder Bird. I was up there a couple of years ago and fished Boot Bay most of the time. I would really appreciate any help that anyone could give as to what's happening on Lac Des Mille Lacs and where. It would be great if someone could advise me on the Jumbo Perch. This is such an informitive site I'm sure that someone can help. Thank you."
542614,Guest,2004-08-14 20:56:00,0,I went to lac des mille lacs the 1st week in aug.Fishing started out real slow and picked up a little at the end. We troll crankbaits to catch walleye and northern. They were in deeper water than usual and had to use lures with long bills to get down.Our biggest walleye was 26'' and northern was 37''. fished around pinepoint where we stayed and bolton bay.Never been to boot bay.How do you fish and what do you usually catch?
542619,Guest,2004-08-15 09:13:00,0,"I was there with a friend that's been going for over 20 years. We used crawlers and single hook, a slip sinker up the line about 24 inches. Then we would either drift or slow troll. We found walleyes in the 10 to 20'range, but that could have changed at any time. We found Northerns most every where that there were a few weeds. They would bite anything tha moved. Even had some bite off's on the walleye rigs. This year I'm going to try to find the Perch. A friend just came back and had some that were in the one pound range."

542809,hgf,2004-08-22 13:11:00,199,"We just came back yesterday from a week on the north end of this Lake. We stayed at a camp by Upsala. We had very poor luck. The entire north part of the Lake is very shallow, only gets down to 8 feet or so. The resort owner tried to tell us there were plenty of walleyes there, and we did find a few keepers. But, in general, I would not go back, unless I went in June or late September. Supposedly it turns on then. I did try a couple days to run to deeper water, and fish in 15 to 20 feet. Again, very little luck. No one else in our camp was catching very much either. And some of them were running daily to deeper water, despite the awful weather. In fairness, the weather turned cold in the middle of the week, and we had several storms. Never saw it get so cold in the middle of August anywhere. We even saw a few snowflakes. That might have a little something to do with the poor fishing. I camped next to a couple who has a permanent space there, and they said it is great right after opening. But July and August???? One has to ""..work hard for a fish..."" The beer and friends were great. Fishing????"
542833,Guest,2004-08-23 08:39:00,0,"I fish this lake frequently from Opener to early July. I don't fish it again until mid September. (That's a rule of thumb that can be altered abit by weather of course). When I fish it in September, I try and time it with a few nights of cold temperatures and a forecasted warming trend. If those conditions present themselves, I will fish some spots that have 35' water adjacent to some 15' humps. I fish a good sized minnow. I have done really well in September, but the weather is always unpredictable. I've never done well in August on that lake."
