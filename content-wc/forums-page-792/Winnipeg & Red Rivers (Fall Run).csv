542907,Backwater Eddy,2004-08-24 14:33:00,3871,"I am optimistic for a good fall. Mostly because a week or so back on my last trip up for catfish there were tons of emerald shiners already in the system. The river has remained up all summer and the cat bite was certainly one for the books this year, and remains to be very good. September tends to be big-big fish time up on that end so if it gets even better then it has been...Mmmmm-Boy. I feel the odds are good the shiners may remain in the Red in good numbers, and may even increase in numbers as fall nears, at least tell they do the big draw down. While casting for cats on my last trip I managed to catch 3 river walleye (not greenbacks) that were in the 27"" range, a first for me up there in early August. This was plainly due to the high amount of forage in the river. Lots of food available, plus early cooling temps and the stray report of true Greenbacks being caught now out near the End of Main has me optimistic. Time and the weather will tell I guess? I plan to give it a hard go in a couple of weeks, maybe even sooner. Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""ED on the RED"" ><,sUMo,>"
