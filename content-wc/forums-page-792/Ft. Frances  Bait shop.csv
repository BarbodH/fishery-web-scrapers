542850,Guest,2004-08-23 13:21:00,0,"Can someone give me the phone number of the bait shop on Hwy 11 east out of Ft. Frances. I believe it's called; Rainey Lake Sports. It's right before you get out of town and over the bridge going toward Hwy 502. Will be leaving this Friday for a week at Sioux Lookout. I have bought leeches there before, but wanted to see if I could get an order in for some jumbos. When you take what they have you get all sizes. Also, any reports would be appreciated, especially on Minnetaki Lake. Thanks in advance...eyesnatcher"
