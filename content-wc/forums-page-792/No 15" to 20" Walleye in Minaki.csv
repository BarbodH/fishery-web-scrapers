Fishing was a little slow, but with the weather (high of 45 and constant rain for almost 2-3 days straight), bringing in about 25 -40 fish a day was fine by me. Big fish in my boat was a 26 1/2"". Had 3 24's, 3 23's, and about ten 20-22 inchers. The rest of the fish were under 15 inches. We caught only about 2-3 fish the whole week that were 15 to 20 inches. Did Minaki lose some spawns a few years back due to weather. It was weird that there was such a void in that size walleye. The Hatrack was a hot walleye spot for anyone going next week. Hidden lake (or was it lost lake) which is across from Bayview Lodge has the biggest musky I have ever seen in it. The thing had to go 55+ inches. It hit me twice, on a white bass style spinner. Almost had to change my shorts. Was quite impressed by the smallmouth in the lake, but I am heading back to Lac Seul next year."

542768,Guest,2004-08-20 08:21:00,0,"Bor.......Hidden or Lost lake as most call it is not across from Bayview, it's up off of Big Sand."
542774,Guest,2004-08-20 12:02:00,0,"I just looked at a map that is on the Paridise Cove website...I was in Hidden Lake, which is right next to Bayview."
542788,Guest,2004-08-20 14:59:00,0,"Bor, your fish numbers were higher than ours when we went to Minaki at the end of July but the size ranges were very similar. IaCraig"
542794,Guest,2004-08-20 16:52:00,0,"Those numbers were for my boat, not just one person. Sometimes I had three guys in the boat. It was a long drive to catch only 12 to 20 fish a day."
542799,Guest,2004-08-21 09:28:00,0,"Bor, You mentioned good smallmouth fishing. What was the depth and the pattern for you all. I will be up there with a buddy on August 26. Coming in from TN. I love smallmouth, but have never effectively patterned them this time of year. Thanks for any insights, Don"

Mainly looked for less than 12 feet of water and the smallies were at the weed edges. We threw tube jigs into the weeds and worked them out and got stricks. I used a gray sparkle, and my buddy used a white jig, and got them on both. Were trying spinners but mostly got northers and then that muskie came along."
