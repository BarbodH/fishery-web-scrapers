I see many,many american vehicles and do know how much you enjoy your time in canada. Here is my situation,just starting out with a house which in the future will be accomadations for fishermen.(not telling more about house as im not trying to advertise here,just find out what i may include in the house for the future) Would appreciate any comments or ideas thanks *countryliving*"

542675,Guest,2004-08-17 11:19:00,0,"well it all looks better at the moment in dryden,,,all that want to work there are back and students were even hired back for summer... and the town continues to grow,so hope it all goes straight forward.."
542681,srj,2004-08-17 14:09:00,971,"Jak, here is what myself and most of my friends find important: a safe place to park the boat, a decent bed and clean bathroom, a bit of peace and quiet (plenty of noise available stateside), and it's nice to be able to cook your catch. I fish Wabigoon and Thunder occasionally--let me know what you come up with. Good luck."
542708,Guest,2004-08-18 15:13:00,0,"Jak I fish once a year near Dryden (Route Lake, Bluett & Starfire) and I would agree with the others, quiet, some place to cook, a decent boat (I don't like to go thru the trouble & risks of pulling mine up there) a clean bed and ice are about all we need to have a great time. Keep me posted as to your progress."
542755,jak93,2004-08-19 13:35:00,5,"well maybe what i should of been asking is... 1.How many of you come up here and stay on your own and not at a lodge? 2.How many of you come up and bring boat and fishing equipment? Im looking at offering functional house,but what about minnows gas boats and things like that?? thanks sherrie"
