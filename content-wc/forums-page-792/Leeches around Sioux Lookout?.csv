Called them this morning and the only sizes they have or small to mediums. Even as they were explaining them, they seemed to be really small. Hoping for some larger leeches. Does anyone know where we could get some between Ft. Frances and SL? Don't know of any bait shops in Dryden (I'm sure there's a number)so if anyone could help I sure would appreciate it. Even in the town of SL. Small or mediums may haft to do, but was hoping for something a little bigger. Thanks ..."
