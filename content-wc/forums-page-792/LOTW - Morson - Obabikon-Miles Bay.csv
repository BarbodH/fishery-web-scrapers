My son and I hit Miles primarily and found small walleyes most everywhere. The traditional bays, Horseshoe, west side of Garden and other non-named bays that yielded good numbers of 12-14"" fish. The reefs were also productive with 25' of water being about the best on the reef. The bite was definitely better towards evening. We just used any colored jig and half a crawler and scooted around the region till fish hit. Was surprised at the number of random, large crappies caught with jig and worm. We did not target them with minnows but ended up with 6 or so each day. My friends targeted the Obabikon for 3 days and casted shorelines with a variety of lures. They complained the pike numbers were down but everyone still had a great time. I have NEVER seen Miles as crowded as this trip. You did not have to look far to see boats on most reefs and bays. You were never alone. My son did hook up with a 42"" muskie and I got a 27"" walleye jigging. Good trip and will be back up in January to ice fish."
