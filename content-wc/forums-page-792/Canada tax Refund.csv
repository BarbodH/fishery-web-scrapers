Is this true and how and where do you go to collect this money? We will be going to thunder bay and then on to armstrong where we will fly in to our out-post.Thanks in advance for any info."
542726,Guest,2004-08-19 06:30:00,0,Yes you can get part of your taxes refunded. You should be able to get the paperwork for your outfitter. You can also get the money at the border. I think its at the duty free shop on the border if you are crossing at Fort Frances. You fill out some paperwork and show them a reciept form you trip at the shop. It ussually buys us lunch somewhere.
