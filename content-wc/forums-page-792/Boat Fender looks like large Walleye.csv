542819,NEWMARGUY,2004-08-23 07:23:00,34,"Has anyone ever seen a ""rubber"" very lifelike looking boat fender shaped and painted like a large Walleye. It was mfg by ""Dock's Edge Mfg. Inc."" and sold by ""Lunkers"" in Michigan. ""Lunkers"" contacted and they don't know where the item came from and they have not carried it for some time. I can't find ""Dock's Edge Mfg. Inc."" and Cabelas, Bass Pro have been no help. Anyone who has any info that may help please post a reply. Thanks, Andy"

542821,Guest,2004-08-23 07:36:00,0,I don't know where the rubber ones come from. We just use real walleyes. Oh by the way we change them every couple of days.

542871,Guest,2004-08-23 19:20:00,0,I have one that is a Walleye and one that is a largemouth bass. They have the name Dock Edge Inc on them. I checked their website www.dockedge.com but they do not show them on their product list.
542878,NEWMARGUY,2004-08-24 06:27:00,34,"If you look closely you will notice the mfg name is Dock's Edge - not Dock Edge . I contacted the ""Dock Edge "" and they have never produced this product and stated it was another company with a similar name. Do you recall where you purchased the fenders from? Maybe the retailer may have info on his source for this product"
