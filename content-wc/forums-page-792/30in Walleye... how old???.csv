How do you think they were able to teach us the growth rates and how they relate to latitude and other factors like forage base and water quality? They killed thousands of fish to do it. Research cannot be accomplished without it in many cases. While I agree that a 25 inch fish is not a sound choice for the frying pan, given the situation I think the guy deserves a free pass. The fish you see in my avator is a 33 inch walleye that was released. I understand the value of genetic preservation, but science also has to have a way to confirm hypothesis."

They also have been cited for over harvest of great sized crappies(the other major fish in this body of water) and now they play cat and mouse with the local game warden, who is a great guy and lives just down the road.

542592,Guest,2004-08-13 09:10:00,0,"dear fishinanteasy - just so you know what we do. we fish hard, use live bait to make sure we guthook the fish, and then keep every fish that comes into the boat. a garbage can makes a great ""deadwell"". we do filet some of them, but throw away the larger ones - too much work to fillet eyes over about 24 inches. maybe that is why you don't like to keep them and maybe don't have a shovel. they make great fertilizer for the garden. it takes a big hole to bury a pile of big walleyes. in fact earlier this year, we buried about 20 eyes on one weekend including a 30"" and 31"" fish. since you don;t like to keep eyes that are large, just throw them in a dumpster somewhere. i aint from iowa either, but iowa people seem ok to me. To the other guys: i hope that clown is just pulling your leg with his bad attitude. otherwise, he is one sad individual. i appreciate your comments and insight. don't let this guy ruin your day."

I immediately release any walleyes under 15"" or over 20"" unless local regulations state differently (in which case I'd be releasing more fish as I still don't break my personal rule of nothing under 15"" or over 20""). I take far fewer fish out of the system than most locals, I pay non-resident license rates, and I support what is becoming a dwindling resort business in MN. I guess my practice is foolish if I'm going to be branded as a fishhog who will butcher whatever I catch anyway..... BTW, I've witnessed ""locals"" (they had MN plates anyway) keeping everything from 9"" to 25-26"" walleye, 5lb largemouth, etc.. It's not a matter of geography."

542834,Guest,2004-08-23 08:52:00,0,"I once caught a 32 inch walleye. It wieghed maybe 7 pounds max. The fish had a huge head but the body was emanciated. The fish was quite weak. The stomach was all caved in on itself.....there was a deep crease from the throat to the anus. This fish was on the verge of dying of old age. The lake was full of chub and the other walleyes were very healthy. The only fish in the lake are walleye and chubb. The walleye were so active that they often jumped out of the water when hooked.....just like speckled trout. I did not know better then but I should have kept some of the scales and the ""otolite"" bone which is just behind the head and is used to accurately age the fish. This is in the Saguenay region and the biologist in charge of the walleye operations for my area told me that the largest walleye they ever caught was 27 inches long and was 27 years old. According to him, for large walleye, the 1 inch per year idea was quite accurate because this criteria held true for the walleye they had captured and disected over the years."

542513,docIN,2004-08-11 19:41:00,120,"Just recently caught (and released) a 30in walleye in Canada and was wondering how old this fish may be. I know the growing season is really short due to the cold weather and was just curious. I'm sure it would have to be ""ballpark"" age since the only true way is cut the bone in the head and count the rings. Unique fact given to me by the dnr in port clinton. They told me the oldest that they found lately was a 27in male that was 19 years old. My guess would be that this fish is around 24yrs old due to the short growing season."
542514,Guest,2004-08-11 20:31:00,0,"Interesting question docIn. Last week I C&R a 26"" eye...would be interested to know its approximate age. That a fish has lived and survived over two decades is quite a feat. Not to humanize a fish...but think of the stories that fish could tell if it could talk."
542519,Matches,2004-08-11 21:48:00,236,"I'm not sure where I heard this or read this, but what I recall is that is takes about 5 years for a walleye to reach 12 inches, and after that it grows on average one inch a year."
542526,phishfearme,2004-08-12 06:49:00,1242,"docIN - first, congrats on the 30""er. looking at the hunting and fishing library book on walleye (dick sternberg), a 10 year old walleye in pymatuning lake, PA (43 deg N) is 29"", in LOW (49 deg N)it's 19.6"" and in north caribou lake (43 deg N) it's 18"". the change from 8 to 9 years and from 9 to 10 years is about 1 inch each for LOW so the one inch per year number is probably pretty good. a quote from the book; ""Walleyes in the north have been know to live as long as 26 years although fish older than 15 are rare."" i'd say 30""ers are rare and would bet on an age around 20 years or so. - phish"
542527,Guest,2004-08-12 06:59:00,0,"I was told at our fly-in camp, which is NE of Red lake, that a 30"" eye in that area would be 20 years old. Growth rate are SUPER slow, which makes C/R that more important. Also talked to MNR guys about growth rates of Lakers. Unbelievable how old a 'trophy' laker is."
542528,jcass,2004-08-12 07:33:00,255,"On the other side of the coin - south vs north, at the PWT in Bull Shoals, a state biologist told the group that an 18 inch walleye in that lake would be 2 or 3 years old - due to the incredible shad population."
542533,Guest,2004-08-12 09:36:00,0,"The trout oriented biologists in the west used to think that walleyes 18"" long were two years old. Those biologists used to make statements like that, too. They have since become more educated. A body of water could have all the shad in the world available to walleye minnows, but walleye minnows eat what they can fit in their mouth. Mainly, that would be zooplankton until they get large enough to consume other fish. This takes time. Cell division takes time. I'd have a hard time believing 2 years to grow an 18"" walleye."
542534,bigfish1965,2004-08-12 10:56:00,3210,I know that here it is very difficult to tell because once the walleye strain we have reaches 30 inches it's growth slows temendously. But from what I have read a 30 inch fish is between 17 and 22 years old.
542542,Ia Walihntr,2004-08-12 12:49:00,320,"DocIN Several years ago, a local Iowa DNR Biologist asked me to bring back the heads of a couple good sized walleyes from LOTW to help thier studies of size to age comparison for walleyes in different latitudes. I brought back the heads of a 25 inch and a 25 1/2 inch that I had caught in the Tug Channel area. In case anyone is interested, there is a small bone in the area of the nostrils that ,when cut like a tree, reveals age rings, a process that has proved to be very accuate. Unfortunately, you have to kill the fish to find it's age. Th 25 in. fish proved to be 12 years old and the 25 1/2 in. proved to be 13. Considering that 1 inch growth per year after a fish reaches a certain size is fairly accurate, and considering that these fish came from a area farther north where the 1 inch per year may be a little to much, it would be a fairly accurate guess that a 30 inch walleye would be between 17 and 19 years of age. If you considered aging by climate, walleyes in Greers Ferry Arkansas would be about 10 to 12 years old when reaching 30 inches and live to maybe 13 years to 15 years, whereas a walleye in Northwest Ontario may live 20 to 25 years. The southern walleye doesn't have the metabolism slow down in the colder months as an Ontario walleye and consequently, the southern walleye won't live nearly as long. Marv"
