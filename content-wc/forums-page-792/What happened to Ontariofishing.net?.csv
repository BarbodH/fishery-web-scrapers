542804,WillieB,2004-08-21 20:56:00,292,"....a significant difference between O.F.N. and justfishontario.com (justfishontario strikes me as a hughly commercial site, with more reports and feedback from lodge owners and outfitters than your average private fisherman)"
542838,bkr43050,2004-08-23 09:49:00,11,"I just popped in to announce the OFN was back up but others beat me to it. As a side note, I agree with WillieB's take on the comparison of OFN and JFO. I have found much more good info on OFN."
542839,bkr43050,2004-08-23 09:52:00,11,Thanks for the response. I do enjoy the OFN site. TJ runs it pretty well it seems. He just may have to delegate a bit of responsility before his next trip or we can't allow him to go.;)
542763,bkr43050,2004-08-20 06:42:00,11,"I usually check out the www.ontariofishing.net site before and after my annual trip to Ontario. I was able to access it before I left a couple of weeks ago. However, it has been down all of this week. I imagine someone on here is a member of the site and can fill me in? Thanks, Brian"
542771,bkr43050,2004-08-20 10:15:00,11,"Okay apparently nobody on here is a frequent user of Ontariofishing.net or I would think I would have heard an answer by now. If that is the case then hopefully some folks from here can help me to find some info on my Ontario fishing area. We go to Bright Lake which is a small lake near Thessalon, ON. I have been going there for quite a while but what I want to find out is a bit more about other fishing opportunities within the same area. I may try to hit some other bodies of water next year if I can find some encouraging information. Just north of us is Big Basswood Lake. Does anybody know anything about this one? This is not the same lake as BWCA. I know it is a larger lake but I am not sure of what species and numbers in this lake. I believe Chiblow Lake is pretty close as well. Bright Lake is primarily a walleye/pike lake with some bass fishing but I am just looking for some new opportunities. Any information would be appreciated. Thanks, Brian"
542777,Whopper,2004-08-20 13:00:00,340,"Was wondering the same thing. I posted a subject two weeks ago and was told to wait ""Marty"" to return for a report. Ever since he was supposed to return it's been shut down. As far as your question about the area you ask about sorry I can not help you."
542778,Guest,2004-08-20 13:24:00,0,"owing to the fact that you are redirected to some server company's website, could be that someone did not pay their bill. just a guess. could be wrong."
542782,bkr43050,2004-08-20 13:50:00,11,"Whit, It does appear to be more than just downtime related. That was why I thought perhaps they closed up shop. I had visited their site for at least three years off and on. They had a lot of info on Ontario fishing. Oh well. Hopefully someone on here can fill me in on the fishing in the area that I mentioned."
542783,bkr43050,2004-08-20 13:54:00,11,"Whopper, Two weeks ago was about the last I was on there as well. I checked it just before taking off for vacation. If I see that it comes back up I will try to remember to post back to this thread to let you know. Thanks, Brian"
542787,Guest,2004-08-20 14:56:00,0,"Here is a tiny explanation that Spiel gave for the OntarioFishing.net board being down. He posted it on the ""Fishing World Outdoor"" message board. ""One of my fellow moderators for the board has been dealing with the problem but the servers will only talk to TJ who is away till the weekend. Guess we'll just have to wait."" Not much of an explanation but that is it."
542795,Guest,2004-08-20 18:41:00,0,Fished tunnel lake above thessalon this year. did not do well on eyes but did catch some real nice smallies and some pike. Eric
542796,bigfish1965,2004-08-20 19:33:00,3210,"That is the gist of it. There is a server problem and the server company won't deal with anyone but the owner and he is away on a fly-in trip in the far reaches of Northern Ontario. Judging by the huge increase in traffic there lately I am guessing it is a bandwidth issue, but I am only guessing. Whatever the problem is, it is temporary (at least till TJ gets home from da nort')"
