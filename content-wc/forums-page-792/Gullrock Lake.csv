There's a reason the office closes at 8pm...so Bud can get a little time on the water and keep his guest informed on what's working and where. According to Bud, if you want to catch a lot/big walleyes...get vertical...jigging the breaks off flats, islands and sunken islands. If cold fronts come through...go even lighter with slip bobber rigs. The week we were there, the weather went from 70 to 45 in 24 hours, yet with Bud's help we were able to C,P&R over 60 walleyes over 18"". If the weather is stable and you can troll with spinner rigs or crankbaits, you'll be able to pick up some decent notherns as well. Good luck and say hi to Bud and Malinda from the Coughlins. Craig"

If all else fails trolling with bottom bouncers will produce fish. It is a fairly easy lake to fish with many spots to try. If I do not catch a fish within a few minutes I move onto the next spot.
