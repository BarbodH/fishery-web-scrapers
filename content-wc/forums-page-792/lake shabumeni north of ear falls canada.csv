542694,Guest,2004-08-18 08:11:00,0,Little or Big Shab. Little is an outstanding fishery. Live bait not always needed. Little pieces of nightcrawler is all you will need. I have been to little shab numerous times. It is one of the best walleye and large northern lakes I have ever fished
542698,Guest,2004-08-18 09:18:00,0,"thanks for your response. it will help me. i just found out that we are going to big shabi. i have been there before, about 10 years ago and we used worms and leaches on an inline spinner rig. i am taking several grubs in many colors and jigs to try that out. have you heard as to grub color. also have you heard of location of walleye as to shallow or deep at this time of year (sept, and presentation. thanks again for your help. let me know what you think of big shab. walter blocker"

We had to fish 18-26' in Sept, mostly off of the humps, more structure fishing, a graph comes in handy. Watch out for the reefs, they come up out of no where. What outfitter are going to be staying with? We didn't catch much for big northerns, but the group before us caught a 46"". Good luck, and I'd like to hear how it goes."
