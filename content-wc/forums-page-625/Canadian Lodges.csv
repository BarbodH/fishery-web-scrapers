570840,nicko,2008-01-17 10:43:00,508,I am not sure how this place relates to the 4 lodges I asked about.
570841,Guest,2008-01-17 10:53:00,0,"White Pine Lodge is the clear choice here. Been there many times and you can't go wrong as indicated earlier. Great Camp,food,service. It was recently taken over by Jim and Jody, Very hospitable people.Good luck! What time of year are planning on going?"
570842,nicko,2008-01-17 10:58:00,508,Have a tentative spot held June 21-28. Have you been there at that time? What can I expect? Whats hot? Whats not? I far out of Snake bay to I go for Eyes? Thanks...Nick
570843,Guest,2008-01-17 11:18:00,0,"We have usually gone up the 2nd or 3rd week in June. As Jigmeister noted, Yellow Girl Bay as well as parts of Long Bay are certainly Hot Spots and YES Bobby Elders (Guide) will be there. There are certainly areas within Snake Bay that hold walleye's but just not in any great numbers. Regina Bay is also worth noting, but again we haven't seen great numbers. Ask Jim what's hot, he won't steer you wrong. As far as presentation,Jig-Minnow all day. Troll cranks and sticks in the morning and evening. That's if you can roll your self down to the boat after one of Jody's superb meals!!"

570903,nicko,2008-01-20 09:54:00,508,"Rick, Will try and ring you today...Trying to head to Boat show in Rosemont....:)"
570730,nicko,2008-01-14 16:46:00,508,"Well after a trip to the Chicago All-Canada show and endless pouring over packets of info, I think we may have nailed it down to 4 lodges. Anyone have opinions on the following for a first trip to Canada for a few Fathers, sons, Grandson. We will be bringing our own boat which is is part of the criteria we used along with the following: Drive-in only American Plan Good number of species Good accomodations and lodging Fair number of ammenties Who has any info on : Red Indian Lodge LOTW Indianhead Lodge LOTW Manotak Lodge Perrault Lake White Pines Lodge LOTW Any info would be welcome. Are these good for a first trip? I plan on being back, so I'd like to get my feet wet in decent waters with a good place that has good service. Not looking for a Spa like Totem resorts or a meat market like the large places. I travel quite a lot for business and don't need Hilton and Hyatt type service. Just a good clean place with decent food and lodging with good service and a better than average chance of getting a good shot at some nice fishing for the fathers. Ok lets hear it....Trying to keep costs lower on this first trip also. Because i'm paying for my father and my son, i'd like to keep costs to around $1500-$1800 for the 3 of us. There are 5 total in the party. Thanks...Nick"
570731,Obabikon,2008-01-14 16:55:00,2370,"They weren't at the show, but I'm going to recommend Buena Vista or Red Wing out of Morson. (since you're not interested in a boat in ;) lol) Anyhow, definately choose lake of the woods!"
570732,nicko,2008-01-14 16:57:00,508,Thanks....I will take a look at both....
570733,Guest,2008-01-14 17:32:00,0,"stayed at white pine the last 2 years.nice camp with great food and great hosts.reasonably priced for an american plan as well.satellite in cabins is nice.fishing was a 6 out of 10,with all the northern you would want in snake bay. you must fish off the back dock for crappie in the evening with minnow and bobber.caught a 36 inch pike 2 years ago as well as many smallmouth.never did catch a walleye there. bob elders is their guide and he does a great job for your guided day which is included.you will travel across the lake with him,but it is in his boat.my first fish with him 2 years ago was a 29-1/2 walter.i have been to many camps,and would definitely recommend this one.i am not going there this year as we want a change of scenery.(i will be fishing manitou falls camp on the english river system the 1st week of june)bring a gps if you have one, and enjoy..can't go wrong here. i post alot on this board,and would stake my reputation on this camp and your trip..jig ouuuttt!!!"
570734,nicko,2008-01-14 17:34:00,508,Thanks...Just the kind of info I want. How is the Walleye fishing? I have an 1800 Pro-V with GPS so I can move around a bit. Smallmouth? Are bait and Ice included? Thanks...Nick
570735,Guest,2008-01-14 17:44:00,0,"bait is included if you do american plan.ice is extra,but reasonable.they have a bouy system on this lake which makes it easier to navigate, but in the spring,we travelled a ways to get walleye.once you get out of snake bay, the water is gin clear and the wallies are hard to come by.30-40 minute boat ride, and you are in the tea colored water.you can fish there for the day.yellow girl bay,and that area.e mail me at [email protected] with your phone # and i will call you this evening to discuss. i fished manotak as well.will talk to you on phone about both..jig"
570810,nicko,2008-01-16 14:38:00,508,Hard to believe only 1 person on this board has been to any of these camps......Anyone?
570818,Trailerguy,2008-01-16 17:52:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I could give you some insite on Manotak, it's right down the road from my cottage. Shot me an e-mail by clicking on the icon, and I'll reply. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
