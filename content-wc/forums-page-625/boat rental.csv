Cast mostly for northerns and smallmouth and we are used to the bow mounted type. Any help appreciated."

570968,Guest,2008-01-23 08:29:00,0,"Thank you, i have about exhausted all the lodges and marinas around and i thought i might add the selfish reason im looking for this type of set-up. I take my dad and my brother on this trip, dad is getting older and doesnt know the lake chain like i do so i drive the big motor all day, my brother cant take fish off (so he says) so i take off all the fish we catch, the only savior i had was the front trolling motor one of them could use so i could fish some, with a back trolling motor i might as well not bring a pole!! anyway we all have problems huh? good luck in your fishing this year."
571034,Goldeneagle,2008-01-26 16:22:00,78,Have you considered backtrolling? Keeps Dad and Brother's lines out of the prop. Maybe take the hooks off Brother's lure. A true Wolverine fan should have had Bo teach Bro how to remove his own fish.
571057,Guest,2008-01-28 11:37:00,0,Ha you make a good point but i did let him do it a few times and the surgery he performed was unacceptable to the fish and the boat!!!!! I have backtrolled some but we like to strictly cast the banks as we move along and its much easier with a bow mount as a bass boat has than a rear mount. thanks for the answer and i will pass your info on to my bro!!! good fishin
571065,jerry bark,2008-01-28 16:28:00,822,i sometimes take guys fishing that don;t take their own fish off. seems their limit is one fish a day...until they learn. cheers jerry
