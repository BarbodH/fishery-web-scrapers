We need a motel with big enough parking for trucks and boats. Security is a concern, don't want our rigs broken into and wrecking our trip. Not looking for anything fancy, just a place to crash for the night and maybe a few ice-cubes for the cocktail hour. ;-)"
570722,Guest,2008-01-14 14:35:00,0,"There's the Kakabeka Falls Motel (may be under name ""Carriage House""). Security? Security is the same as anywhere I guess, but if you're leaving all your stuff in the vehicle there is that inevitable risk associated, though I would contend that risk is minimal. If you're talking 'secure' as in underground parking, or patrolled parking lots, forget about it anywhere in NWO!! Just 30km east of K.F., at the corner of Arthur St. and Thunder Bay Expressway (which on a low-scale map would be where 11/17 turns east/west or where hwy 61 northbound terminates), you will find many more options...Valhalla, Best Western, Travelodge Airlane, Victoria Inn, and others. Nicer accom's but with a higher price tag! NWO Fishing Bum p.s., For peace of mind, you could take in your rod tubes and tackle for the night. I know whenever I travel and stop just for the night, the rod tube (with the 2K+ value inside), the big tackle bag (perhaps another 1.5K-2K; assembled over years), and the reels (just over 1K) always comes in with me!!! The rest I leave, and have luckily never been the victim of crime. NWO Fishing Bum"
570807,Fishoil,2008-01-16 13:06:00,1277,"Thanks for the info. NWO Fishing Bum. So far I've been able to compile the following list of motels in the area: Carriage House Motel Telstar Motel Pineview Motel Kakebeka Motor Hotel Cascades Motel & Restaurant I'm looking for a big, well lighted parking lot, reasonable prices, and clean rooms, nothing fancy. Are any of these possibilities for what I'm looking for?"
571022,Fishoil,2008-01-25 17:37:00,1277,Does anybody know anything about any of these motels?
571072,Planocat,2008-01-28 21:08:00,473,"I haven't stayed in any of them as we make the drive to LDML without stopping. But, I have always thought the Pineview was a place I would stop if required to spend a night in the area. Just a nice appearing family type motel that is kept neat as a pin on the outside. Why don't you call them and inquire about what they have to offer vs your needs. Planocat"
