571005,stevensinks,2008-01-24 12:13:00,330,"I have had Pike go through rubber nets. So what I do now is use a very large plastic coated hoop net. I net the fish but I dont pick it up with the net.If we dont pick them up with the net they dont seem to trash. I leave the net in the water using it like a live well. I then unhook the fish and pick it up by hand, snap a phot and send it home."

When fishing Lac Seul we catch a lot of large pike that get wrapped up in our standard fishing nets and some times do damage to their gills. I have found some large hooped rubber nets at Cabelas, but I really wonder how well they stretch to take in a 40+ inch pike. Can anyone help me out? NE Piker"
570919,Hump,2008-01-21 09:10:00,578,"The camp we stay at on Lac Seul has rubber nets, but small ones. They are great for walleye, but probably not much stretch. They sink very quickly!!!"
570924,tlars,2008-01-21 12:45:00,137,"No problem with the larger rubber nets on pike up to 41""."
570934,Guest,2008-01-21 18:35:00,0,"From my experience you do not want the rubber stretchable net, they work great for walleyes, but the larger northerns will slip through the mesh in the net. I use a rubber or vinyl coated net and it works great for both the walleyes and northerns"
570935,hawkeye,2008-01-21 20:17:00,112,"Fished Lac Seul 28 years, quit using net. Big laughs when someone loses fish. We remove the hook in water and let the big ones go."
570941,Frankm,2008-01-22 06:28:00,154,We've used a medium sized rubber nets for years. They are great for Walleye. We netted a few 40+ Pike too. It's a little tricky but not bad.
570946,Freud,2008-01-22 08:13:00,15,"I have to agree that using a net on a large pike is mostly futile. Over the years I've come to read the fish and know when I can safely slip my hand under it, while it's in the water, pick it up under the gill plate and remove the hook. If you're squeamish about this, try removing the hook while it's still in the water or use a cradle. Freud"
570947,Guest,2008-01-22 11:37:00,0,"Don't net pike, period!!! I've landed thousands of pike, several well over the 40"" mark, and always land them by hand. Netting pike will only destroy both the net and the pike. Remember pike have the protective film (yes, that's what makes them slippery), which can be removed when thrashing in a net, making the fish very vulnerable to disease and parasites. I would not recommend rubber nets. Large fish will flop out of them. What you want is a rubber-coated net, with a tight mesh size!!! The rubber coating keeps hooks and so forth from getting completely caught up, yet does not have the elasticity of a complete rubber net (which causes more problems than it solves). NWO Fishing Bum"
570951,AllenW,2008-01-22 13:35:00,11482,"Had a nice sized pike go though a rubber net years ago, wouldn't have been bad except it was the wife's fish and her biggest to that date, a picture of it would have been nice, anyway I haven't used a net on pike or muskies since. While I have no problem with landing one with out a net, not so with many of the people I fish with, including the wife. I've also seemed people hanging large fish buy grabbing though the underside of the jaw and hoisting them up, been told by a guy from the Minn DNR and others, that holding them that way is hard on them also. Barbless hooks and a shallow net seem to work well for us, fish doesn't get tangled and I can get them out of the net, pictures if wanted and back in the water with out hurting them. Problem with most nets is, the bigger the deeper they are, hard to find big, shallow nets. Whatever works for ya. Al"
570957,Guest,2008-01-22 15:03:00,0,"Very true Allen! Hoisting a 20lb pike by a single jaw bone, or having it carelessly flopped over one hand placed under the stomach organs for support, can certainly cause damage, noting of course that these species live a 'suspended life' and such strain is never felt in their common behaviour. I think ultimately, if you bring larger fish in the boat, you're inevitably doing some damage, and for many it becomes responsibly minimizing that damage. (And yes, here is where the eco-centric people suggest doing so means stopping fishing...blah, blah) The worst is when somebody nets a monster, hoists it up over the gunnel, then slams it down on the bottom of the boat to thrash in the net and get covered in whatever else is on the boat floor, while he/she hoots and hollers. It takes focus and often some experience to keep that excitement curtailed when somebody in the boat lands a big fish, until after the hook is out, fish is measured, pictures are taken and the fish is released. THEN, go nuts, and high-five, and start stretching how long it was for the dinner table stories, etc., etc. NWO Fishing Bum"
