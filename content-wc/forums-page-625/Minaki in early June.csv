570837,Guest,2008-01-17 10:02:00,0,"In general, fishing in the first week of June at Minaki will offer some excellent walleye, northern and smallmouth fishing. Musky will be good, although in our experience it usually tends to get even better beginning in late-June, as larger forage completes the final transition to summer habitat. Crappie will be isolated to a few locations that can be difficult for a newcomer to find. The effects of weather will be more dramatic in early-June when compared to late-June. Brisker and more variable winds, and wider swings in temperature can affect day-to-day patterns more at this time. So, in severe fronts look for active walleye on the river or areas affected by slow moving current. We've usually caught more walleye on minnows during this week, but my mid-June the leech/crawler bite starts to pick up. Smallmouth will typically be caught on cranks, tubes, spinnerbaits, top water, chatterbaits and mepps cast to shorelines, rockpiles, and main points. Northern are usually very active in the bigger bays near weed growth. I suggest you page back through the posts from June 2007 and June 2006 to get a feel for the fishing at Minaki in that period. There are some good reports from board members that will provide insight, results, and even some areas that hold active fish. There is some big water on the Winnepeg around Minaki, so you'll need to watch the weather and wind. Big Sand and Rough Rock north of Minaki can be especially exciting in early June winds, while the Big Stretch south of Minaki can be a tough for the un-initiated. The government maps and Navionics chips for Minaki are pretty good as far as marking hazards, everywhere except for the far north end of Rough Rock by Blueberry Lake. A good sonar and GPS would be very helpful! Chuck"

Another 2 lakes are Worth & sword, and they both have lakers, pike and bass. From 596 where you turn left on 525 to Whitedog about 5 miles down the road on the left. The first 2 of the lakes is worth, most people by-pass this lake and take the litle creek at the far end of to fish sword. A ok producer in winter and spring. We generally don't spend to much time here. Now the other 1 I think it's called Gosshawk. It's past whitedog, and we always were on sleds in the winter so I'm not sure if it has a boat launch . I appolgize I don't have my maps with me, but I am certain that it is connected to the english river system. This lake had good size fish, but not great numbers of fish. Anything beyond there I don't know."
570860,Guest,2008-01-17 17:14:00,0,So that's your 14fter over there? You aren't the A-hole who keeps screwing with my boat are you?...LOL. Some jackass drifted it out in the lake one year then dragged it up on the bank another year. I guess he thinks he owns the lake. I even have permission from the MNR to have the boat over there.
570868,Guest,2008-01-18 07:24:00,0,"Ours is the 14' starcraft, but we don't leave it on the beach. On the CDN long weekend in May kids always show up there and take the boats out. We keep out boat way out of sight. Somebody hauled a little 18' aluminum last year. The 14' boat was heavy enough ! Where going ice fishing there next week."
570870,Guest,2008-01-18 11:07:00,0,"Brain, Yep ours is hidden know to. Good luck ice fishing. Are there maintained snowmobile trails in that area? There use to be one that ran right by the east side of Harbour Island then shot right up the middle of Big Sand. I've been thinking about bringing my sled up there some winter."
570872,Guest,2008-01-18 11:44:00,0,"There is a groomed trail from the far north west arm of the lake ( the other portage). We're going into the lake from the south side, so we are not crossing the wpg river at all. Ice is kinda funny this year in places and I'm not really interested in the polar bear swim."
570875,Guest,2008-01-18 14:21:00,0,"I have fished the area for about 8 years now, all last week in may to first week of june each year. We have always had good fishing, some years better than others but we predominently casted for northerns, musky and smallmouth. Each day we jigged for about two hours for walleye to eat. We generally fished rough rock and into little sand lake. I will say the size of the eyes were not what i see on these boards generaly that time of the year and im guessing its due to the migration time being a little later, but that beingsaid i wont rule out me not being a real good fisherman!! Seems water level definately has affected our trips more than weather, wind patterns. I dont want to steal this thread but due to financial restrictions this year (bringing my 12 yr old) i wont be staying at a american plan lodge this year and was wondering where in minaki you guys would choose to stay? seems paradise cove is mentioned alot but would appreciate any help you have and again sorry if i jumped on your thread."
570880,Guest,2008-01-18 19:30:00,0,"Woods, I have been going up to Minaki for many years. For years we went the last week of May or the first week of June. Some years we still make the early trip but by far the later trips in mid July to mid Aug are much more productive for walleyes and easier to pattern. I would agree with earlier posts weather early can be terrible from snow to cold rain and walleye's usually are very scattered. For early try the mouth of the McFarland river, and we all fish around Mertle Rapids and the back bays in this area that the water warms up faster, we have an area that we call the cabbage patch that if conditions are right can be fantastic fishing for walleye's, crappies, and nice northerns, this time of the year. The fishing last summer for walleye's appeared to be making a nice come back after several slim years on the water. I am not sure if it is the reduced limit or water levels back to normal. This area is hard to beat in my oponion Brian Thomas"
570886,woods,2008-01-19 09:39:00,646,"I would recommend Barber's or Paradise Cove, and Fergie's (if you don't mind a little more rustic conditions and lower prices)."
570887,woods,2008-01-19 09:42:00,646,"With what your saying, and the iffy weather, I think I'll stick to my late June trips. May try a July or August one this year too."
570710,woods,2008-01-14 09:46:00,646,"Has anyone fished at Minaki in the first week of June? What were you fishing for, and how good was it?"
570718,Guest,2008-01-14 14:07:00,0,"I'm up there starting in may, and in early june. For at least walleye's that's the end of the spawing period or there abouts. So at this time they a further down strean then I prefer to travel by boat. But they are just starting to head up for there summer haunts. So in the river system they can be found in good numbers, but it can take a few days to pattern them, but like last year they were all over the place. a few here and few there. But if your staying at a lodge I'm sure they would narrow down the spots faster. That time a year we generally focus on lakers on other waters"
570743,Guest,2008-01-14 21:58:00,0,"Wood, I will be fishing out of Birch Island Resort the first week of June at Minaki. My partner and I fish mainly smallmouth with some walleye and crappie thrown in. You can not keep pike off the line, so if you like pike, your in luck. Usually catch some Muskie while smallmouth and walleye fishing. ChuckE, if he posts has excellent information. There are many others with good information also. Hopefully they will chime in. May see you up there. Good fishing, DonC"
570747,Guest,2008-01-15 08:55:00,0,"I am going back to Minaki for my 3rd year.Last week of May.Excellent body of water.We are just scratching the surface and we fish new locations every day. Great walleye and Northern fishing.We stay at bignorth lodge and are south of minaki and have to date never been north of the tressle.We really like the peace and quiet where we fish.A normal day usually gets us on the water by 8 a.m. and by 3 or 4 p.m. we have been fished out for day and move on to camp chores i.e. cocktail hour, a game or two of gin, dinner preparation and sitting on the deck watching the wildlife."
570755,woods,2008-01-15 11:40:00,646,Ever have any luck at the Cobalt Narrows that time of year?
570756,Hump,2008-01-15 11:59:00,578,Is Minaki easy to fish? How about hazards? Open water? Just curious
570758,Guest,2008-01-15 13:08:00,0,Yes the cobalt narrows can be good that time of year.The Minaki river is easy too fish if you know how to fish moving water.Yes there are hazards just like any body of water in the Canadian Sheild.Caution is necessary.There is vast areas of open water as well Big Sand being the biggest.I fish a lot of NWO and right now this is one of my favorite destinations
570781,Guest,2008-01-16 06:56:00,0,"Depending on ice out, water temp, and the current weather conditions the first week of June can be outstanding for Smallmouth bass. Really depends on what you are fishing for."
570784,Guest,2008-01-16 08:03:00,0,"Briand, what lakes do you fish for the lake trout? I have been going to Minaki for years, we have a lake up on the English that we catch a few lake trout but would like to try some different waters thanks Briant"
570803,woods,2008-01-16 11:31:00,646,"I mainly wanted to fish for walleye, and I was concerned how they would be biting that early in June. I normally go 3 weeks later, and it is almost always good then. Thanks to all for the comments."
