I did do a little update to the website which includes the 2008 registration form. I will be updating it weekly with info on what I am planning. I am just finalizing the rules, only minor adjustments... nothing major. The main difference this year will be in tournament procedures, not rules. I have lots of time for planning this year and if anyone wants to throw their two cents in, go for it. I am all ears! I am looking for volunteers and anyone who can help out in any way. I am planning to do a 2 or 3 hours kids tournament off the dock for kids 12 and under with parental supervision of course. You will notice that right now the web page is very plane with only text on a white background... that will change soon, I got a good web designer cooking up something nice. It's just taking longer then I would like. One new item this year is a $500.00 early bird draw if entry is paid before April 30th. A little incentive so people don't wait till the last minute. The official tournament website is located @ www.fishminaki.com for those who don't know. Please feel free to email me or to ask questions on this board. Thanks, J.P."
