570822,Obabikon,2008-01-16 19:31:00,2370,"Rose, One thing to consider is this... the further away you are, the less likely people are to bring their own food. A lot in the Chicago area don't want to carry 7 days worth of food 13-14 hours... While someone in the Minneapolis area is only 7-8 hours away, it wouldnt be such a hassle for them. Just two cents (which isn't worth much :))"
570828,Guest,2008-01-17 03:36:00,0,We go with the housekeeping but this year we will be haveing a few meals in camp (I guess they call it modified housekeeping)we just let them know 2 days in advance breakfast or dinner.We bring our own lunch. Terry
570834,Guest,2008-01-17 08:48:00,0,"Jared, Is that 2 cents in US funds or Canadian? LOL See you in Des Moines, right?"
570836,Obabikon,2008-01-17 09:11:00,2370,"US funds, so it's value is getting worse daily! lol George will be in Des Moines, I'll be in Omaha and St. Louis though!"
570849,Guest,2008-01-17 12:41:00,0,we do the houskeeping and bring our food from Omaha to Ear Falls. we like to be on our own schedule. we sleep late and take cold cuts out for lunch and then cook supper whenever we get back. Done the American Plan and it was Ok but not prefered
570859,Guest,2008-01-17 16:11:00,0,"As far as traveling with food is more a matter of space rather than the idea of spoilage. I purchase as much as I can here in Madison, freeze what I can and pack the coolers very tight and duct tape the seams. Then purchase the bread, milk, potatoes, onions and any other stuff at the Grocery store in Ft. Francis. Works great for us and the FF store is as nice as any, and prices are reasonable."
570766,Guest,2008-01-15 16:51:00,0,"I'm just curious which is the favored plan? I got to thinking about this when I left the show in St. Charles because many asked me if I would cook for them. To those on W.C. that stopped to say hello, Thank you!"
570771,Guest,2008-01-15 18:19:00,0,"I prefer the Housekeeping plan, I am a good camp cook and we can decide when to have dinner when we want it. For our group of 6 guys it costs about $150 for provisions, not including beer and liquor for the week, and we have a menu that includes Steaks, Chicken, Ham, and of course FISH. (For those of you math challenged, that's only $25/guy)I can eat breakfast in my PJ's, cook my own shorelunch without interupting the days fishing or going back to camp and Lastly, It's much less expensive. I understand the people who need to be catered too, they just don't vacation in Canada with me."
570773,Guest,2008-01-15 18:29:00,0,Im sure you will get a variety of responses on this..for our group we prefer a modified housekeeping plan where the lodge just makes dinner for us and we are on our own for breakfast and lunch..this way we are locked into only one specific time to be in..we eat dinner at 5:00 and most of our guys are back out fishing by 5:45
570774,prov1900,2008-01-15 18:59:00,544,"It would be nice to have dinner waiting, but the guys in my group would miss my cooking. Housekeeping all the way. Eat what you want, when you want. We come in fairly early after a full day, make dinner, then either head back out till sunset, or settle in with some suds, cards, and cigars. Campfire if it is nice. I too, think that if you offered the American Plan, you would get some takers. But the price is expensive (as it should be) and with gas and Canadian vacations (all vacations) going up in price, people are going to save. That is going to be done with food. It is the only thing you can sacrifice if need be. We will still eat steak. Not going to sacrifice. A modified plan, where breakfast was available with enough coffee to go around, with coffee to go, would be great. Just an idea. Rose, good luck and report back on what worked for you."
570779,Pooch,2008-01-15 21:01:00,4619,Our group has done both. Sometimes American plan on a fly-in where weight restrictions are really tight. Other wise we really enjoy just snacking when we come in tired at all hours of the day and night. To be on a cook's schedule can be a pain when your onto a hot bite in the far corner of the lake. The meal that our guys would consider would be having pancakes or eggs and bacon ready in the morning so we could get on the water earlier and not have dishes to mess with. That is a pretty generic breakfast that wouldn't put a huge strain on the camp operators and would be affordable to most groups. Our group actually only eats two meals a day when we are fishing. Always breakfast then fish for lunch in the early to mid afternoon before or after a nap. Then popcorn or cold cuts if anyone one person is hungry before we hit the rack. Each guy is on his own for that late evening snack. I guess my vote says that Housekeeping or a modified version is the way to go on a drive in camp. Good luck with your camp Rose. Pooch

570782,AllenW,2008-01-16 07:07:00,11482,"For us its always been housekeeping, quick breakfast of pancakes and eggs or oatmeal and lunch in the boat of sandwiches and stuff and then a big supper, grilling steaks, chicken, fish or whatever. I've discovered that if I cook, someone else cleans up, works for me as I like to cook.. :) As we're getting older, I find we're not quite so obsessed with being on the water and I'd probably enjoy the lodge offering meals, problem is timing and we would only want the option of eating at the resort, not a complete package. Also it would vary if it was either the guys going or the wife and I, she would be more apt to eat at the resort. Al"
570785,retire55,2008-01-16 08:31:00,1029,"More input Rose. Our group has always opted for the housekeeping plan in order that we can eat when we want or when the walleyes aren't biting. The flexibility of the housekeeping plan is what is attractive for us. Our normal routine involves coffee and toast around 5 AM, fishing until 9 AM, full breakfast about 9:45 AM, fishing, dinner at 5:30 PM and fishing until we quit for the day. Anytime we luck into a walleye bite, we change our routine as required. Our meal plan tends to run 90 to 100 dollars per man for a 7 day trip (not including beer/liquor)."
570788,skindzier,2008-01-16 10:06:00,137,"I go up with my family - my wife likes having dinner waiting when we get back. I'm not as big on a lodge breakfast, as I like to be out at the crack of dawn. I think a modified American Plan or even a la carte meals with a bit of notice would be great. As far as I can tell, nobody else on Cliff or Cedar offers meals, so that might be a nice niche for you in your immediate area. One other thing that I think would be interesting to look into would be allowing guests to trailer boats to other lakes. Most camps can't/won't allow it due to insurance restrictions. It might be interesting to find out how much additional insurance costs would be if the boats were allowed to be trailered & pass that cost on to folks that might want to do it. You are in an area with so many awesome lakes, it would be great to give guests the flexability to go elsewhere too. I bring my own boat, so I'm able to go to other lakes. For example, I like Cliff as great multi-species lake, but I prefer Lac Seul as a pure walleye lake & Eagle is my favorite musky lake. However, I have friends that also do the trip sometimes that don't have their own boat - it makes planning interesting. I'm staying on Lac Seul this year, but will be making at least 3 day trips to Eagle and/or Cliff. Anyway, a lodge on Cliff that offered meals and flexability with camp boats would certainly be attractive to me - I guess the question is: How many other wierdos are there out there like me? :)"
570794,Guest,2008-01-16 10:41:00,0,"Your comments have been very interesting to read. We have so many things to consider and this feedback is great. To begin with, we will offer early morning coffee and some sort of danish/doughnut/bagels. My husbands idea since he's the early riser [5:00 am] and the coffee drinker. He can also be there for those who need live bait. To begin with, there's only 2 of us, but as we get going, who knows. Thanks to all that responded. P.S Skindzier, you raised another topic that I want feedback on and that is having a boat ready to take to remote lakes. I will post a new topic for feedback on that issue. Thanks for bringing it up, Rose"
