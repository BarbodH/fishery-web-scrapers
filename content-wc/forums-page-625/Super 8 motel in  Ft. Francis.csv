570948,AllenW,2008-01-22 12:51:00,11482,"Many times I think we're dealing with crimes of opportunity when it comes to getting stuff stolen out of boats/cars/whatever. Over the years I've learned to take the high buck items in with us, things like depth finders now are easy to remove, and worth a lot more now than the old flashers were. The old adage, out of sight out of mind works too. Al"

It is right on Rainy Lake and has a nice restaurant and bar.We look forward to having a few cocktails ,a nice dinner and talking to the fisherman staying there.We have made some new friends and picked up intel for future trips.Of course we leave home a day early and take our time on the way up."
570985,Guest,2008-01-23 14:54:00,0,"Camp Chief I am intrigued my your suggestion of Lost Island as a place to overnight on the way up. Any concerns or thoughts you have about it. The only concern I have is I travel with my 78 father and one my kids (either 15 year old son or 12 year-old daughter and I noticed the lodge rooms are above the restuarant/bar. Would the noise level be loud on a weekend night, especially if you turn in early. We normally stay in Orr, but a change is always good to help you experience more in life. Any insights your willing to share (quality of food, etc) would be helpful. Cheers,....IA Walleye"
570986,Guest,2008-01-23 15:12:00,0,"The island view is a nice place.The non lake view rooms are cheaper and are over the gift shop and kitchen .Noise was not a problem for us.We also travel with a youngboy who turns in early.The steps are steep so the only drawback would be if any of you had difficulty with stairs. I have bed knees myself,but just take it easy and only go up and down twice. The views from the deck,bar and dining room are quite nice"

They did that for 10 years or so ... 2 boats, 6 people. 2 years ago they came out before dawn and found their boat covers loose with the straps trailing down to the ground. Now they drive straight through and don't stop anywhere. I stop at the Super 8 in Fort Frances ... have done that the last 2 years. The folks who work there tell me they have never had a theft problem. Don't know if that is true or not, but so far, so good, for me. I have heard too many bad things about International Falls. I won't stay there."
571032,Guest,2008-01-26 09:55:00,0,"I used to stay in IFalls but because of what I saw happen to others we drive across the border. I may try the place talked about earlier in the post. Anyway, the Super 8 has been very good, very bright lighted parking lot, most of the other guests are going in or comming out from camps, and the make your own waffels in the morning will put anyone in a good mood."
571041,Guest,2008-01-27 10:42:00,0,Beter you stay at super 8 in International Falls..have stayed several times w/boat cover and no problem [email protected]
570797,Guest,2008-01-16 10:52:00,0,"Anyone ever spend the night at the Super 8 in Ft. Francis? If so, how safe is it to leave a tarped boat (with equipment) in the parking lot? If you did stay, would you recommend it to someone else?"
570801,Frankm,2008-01-16 11:19:00,154,We've stayed at the Super 8 a few times. Its well lit up and you can see your rig from the room. The rooms are nice and they have a pretty decent continetal breakfast. Last year we stayed down the road at the Emo Inn. The rooms were decent. Their lot is well lit and we were able to park the truck/boat outside our room. Also the OPP is right across the street. I would recommend both places. The Super 8 has a few fast food places right next door. The Emo Inn has a sports bar and restaraunt attached.
570806,Guest,2008-01-16 12:41:00,0,I agree with Frankm...our group has stayed at both and you shouldnt have any concerns..
570809,Mohleye,2008-01-16 13:56:00,368,"Same story here.....since you list security as your biggest concern, I felt pretty good having the police station across the street in Emo, plus it's a smaller town, just seemed about as secure as you could hope for. Both the hotels are fine."
570865,Guest,2008-01-17 20:34:00,0,"We stay in the Super 8 and have never had any problems with gear left in the boat. Last year a guy in our party brought a boat with no cover and all his gear in the storage compartments, but no problems. Large parking lot, nice breakfast in the morning (free), and the hot tub is great after 8 hrs in the car."
570890,2746,2008-01-19 10:57:00,3206,"We have stayed there and, as others have said, it is a clean and safe place to stay. The last few years we have begun to go accross the border (gets that out of the way) and stay at the Rendevouse(sp?). Maybe a bit more cost but has a nice resturante attached and speeds up the trip considerably the next morning. That's important to us as we are headed to Gullrock or Lac Seul.....if your destination is closer it might not be important."
570891,Guest,2008-01-19 11:43:00,0,the full name is La Place Rendevoux. again not sure about the spelling. its very nice though.
570893,Hump,2008-01-19 15:03:00,578,"We used to stay in International Falls, then on to Dryden for a few years. We now go the 71 route and stay in Vermillion Bay. good motel and good place to eat and only an hour or so from Lac Seul."
570904,BOBBYB,2008-01-20 10:17:00,44,"Stayed at both, super 8 and roundevous, and left all 3 boats (2 tarped one not)with gear in the parking lot and had no problems. Think the local police come by pretty often to keep it that way as tourists are big business."
570913,MoWalleyeguy,2008-01-20 18:40:00,409,I know a group of guys that had gear stolen from the Super 8 in Ft Francis. I have always stayed at the Super 8 in International Falls and not had any trouble... and the Chocolate Moose resturant is very close by... great place to eat!
