So if you don't want to scramble at the last minute prior to your trip this spring/summer, get a passport/passport card asap. Here's the info from the Homeland SEcurity website: LAND AND SEA TRAVEL The following summarizes information available on the Department of Homeland Security's website. JANUARY 31, 2008 U.S. and Canadian citizens will need to present either a WHTI-compliant document, or a government-issued photo ID, such as a driver's license, plus proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate. DHS also proposes to begin alternative procedures for U.S. and Canadian children at that time. LATER At a later date, to be determined, the departments will implement the full requirements of the land and sea phase of WHTI. The proposed rules require most U.S. citizens entering the United States at sea or land ports of entry to have either a U.S. passport; a U.S. passport card; a trusted traveler card such as NEXUS, FAST, or SENTRI; a valid Merchant Mariner Document (MMD) when traveling in conjunction with official maritime business; or a valid U.S. Military identification card when traveling on official orders."

570814,SSH,2008-01-16 15:25:00,526,Driver's license and birth certificate. Won't want not to be able to get back into the US.
570819,Guest,2008-01-16 18:02:00,0,Is this new card only for people living in boardering states to Canada and Mexico since they said it was developed for people who cross the boarder often?
