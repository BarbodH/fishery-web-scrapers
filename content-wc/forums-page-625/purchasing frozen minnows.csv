Can anyone advise me where I can purchase these and at what approximate cost? Man! we are biting at the ""bit"" and can't wait to head north!"
571010,Guest,2008-01-25 09:52:00,0,I believe frozen minnows must be dead for at least 1 or 2 months or you cannot take them across the border. Something about the eggs can still reproduse. If they were to ask you how long there were frozen and you said 1 week you would have to toss them out.
571011,5richards,2008-01-25 10:23:00,131,Thanks for the info -- I would be more than happy to purchase north of the border.
571014,Goldeneagle,2008-01-25 12:34:00,78,Gas station at Bobby's Corner at Vermilion Bay where you turn north on the Red Lake Road. What week will you be there?
571015,Bill Krejca,2008-01-25 14:13:00,6107,"So.. now in addition to a birth certificate, we need a death certificate for minnows, eh? Getting pretty complicated, getting into God's country. It is getting to be a long winter."
571016,Jimmy Jig,2008-01-25 14:25:00,1905,There is no problem getting in to Canada. Its getting back thats the problem!! Myabe we should just stay....
571018,5richards,2008-01-25 15:28:00,131,Heading to little vermilion first or second week in june. We fish mostly for large northern pike -- yes we use a circle hook and release all in the water. Walleye is just for dinner and probably only 15 per cent of our fishing. can't wait
571019,Bill Krejca,2008-01-25 15:39:00,6107,"Amen, brother!"
571023,Goldeneagle,2008-01-25 18:15:00,78,"Okay, one of 5richards, I may see you on the change over. My guys are going in May 16 and out May 31 unless we can figure out a way to stay a couple of extra days as we did last year. We met on the walkway. You might be coming too late because many of the biggest pike will have sore mouths. Or maybe not. Good fishing to you."
571030,5richards,2008-01-26 06:51:00,131,"Hope to see you- I guess the fishing will all depend on the weather. Not that we won't fish in bad weather, but when the waves whip up I feel safer on terra firma!!! Don't forget your ice auger! Good fishing to you and your guys!"
