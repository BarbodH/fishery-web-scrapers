571097,Crede,2008-01-30 04:45:00,134,"Went to Makokibatan Lodge with Liddles Fishing Adventures 7 times - most recently June 2007. The fishing was always great and Steve Liddle ran a first class operation. Liddles was purchased by Wilderness North in January of 2007, and it is my understanding that the Liddle family will not be involved in the operation starting this season. You can get more info at www.wildernessnorth.com. If you would like more details on the fishing at Makokibatan Lake feel free to contact me at [email protected]."
