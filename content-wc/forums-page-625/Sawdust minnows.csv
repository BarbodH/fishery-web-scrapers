571017,Guest,2008-01-25 14:44:00,0,Saw an article in a fishing publication stating that storing minnows in a fine sawdust is better than salting minnows? Anyone have experience using sawdust instead of salt? I have never heard of it until now....
571020,dirt,2008-01-25 16:47:00,144,"Never heard of that. Would probably advise against it unless the minnows were dried first. Salt acts as a preservative and better protects the minnows from decomposing. I doubt that sawdust would offer the same protection, unless they were dried first. IÂ´m no scientist, that is just my opinion."
571026,guidedfishing,2008-01-25 18:28:00,531,I've heard of guys freezing their minnows in a mixture of sawdust or oatmeal so that they can get them out without defrosting the entire package. Just break them off?? I've never done it myself. After all is said and done it is cheaper to just buy the commercial perserved minnows at farm and barn then go through the hassle. For some folks that is part of the fun as well so to each their own. good luck GF
