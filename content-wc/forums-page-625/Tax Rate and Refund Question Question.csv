She told me to get the lodge owner to itemize the bill, so I did. I sent it in showing that we used the modified plan including cabin and meals (I bring my own boat). I was denied my request. I have heard that the only thing that gets approved is the full American Plan (boat, cabin and meals). I have also heard that some get approved and some do not, so does anyone know the real scoop. With the rising costs a couple hundred dollars back would be great. NE Piker"

You would have to ask your outfitter how they break it down, that is why some use different percentages, it just depends on how they break the packages down. Others probably just charge the maximum tax rate to cover them on their end and it just costs the customer more."

Our lodge owner mailed in our rebate form, but I recently received a letter from the Canadian Govt saying our trip did not qualify for the rebate because we did not use a guide service during our stay. If we had used a guide, our package would have qualified for the rebate."
571006,Guest,2008-01-24 13:06:00,0,"Easy way to get your GST back if your type of trip qualifies for the rebate, find an outfitter who will do the GST rebate for you and saves you from being denied from the government. They rebate you the money directly back to you and they take care of all the paperwork. There are outfitters who do this."
570900,clemento,2008-01-20 07:22:00,48,My outfitter told me the tax rate is 14%. I would like to know if this is correct and how much of it should be refunded by the government.
570902,Guest,2008-01-20 09:21:00,0,3 years ago you would have received 6% or so back. Now you get none back.
570907,clemento,2008-01-20 11:17:00,48,"Looking at websites, some outfitters say 9% others say 10%. What are the true tax rates? Why does mine say 14%? Would a lodge owner or outfitter please let me know?"
570908,clemento,2008-01-20 11:24:00,48,"Rose, Would you please let me know what the actual tax rates are that you must charge? Thanks for any information."
570909,Guest,2008-01-20 11:34:00,0,The GST was lowered January 1 2008 from 6% to 5% and 1/2 of the 5% can be rebated under certain package deals. The PST is 7%.
570910,Guest,2008-01-20 13:16:00,0,"You are right about the GST. The PST is 8% on most things(boat rentals, meals, clothing, ect) and 5% on lodging only."
570911,Guest,2008-01-20 16:37:00,0,"I just got a letter from our accountant and yes, as of Jan. 1st, 2008, the GST is now 5%, but the PST is 8%. As for the rebate, I'm working on the answer to that and will let you know when I find out. I'm getting conflicting answers. PS, What could be better...Just got back from the Milwaukee All Canada show. I got to talk fishing all day and in a couple of minutes, the Packers play. It doesnt get much better than that...Rose"
570912,Guest,2008-01-20 17:53:00,0,"PST is different on different things. It is 5% & 8%, if you are just renting a cabin, then it is 5% PST not 8%."
570915,Guest,2008-01-21 07:54:00,0,"Our package is $1380 for everything(food, flight, boat gas and lodging). How do they split up taxes or do they have to tax the total amount at both rates?"
570916,clemento,2008-01-21 08:35:00,48,What does PST and GST stand for?
