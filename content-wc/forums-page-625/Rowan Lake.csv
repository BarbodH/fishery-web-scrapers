570586,Guest,2008-01-08 16:15:00,0,Anybody out there ever been there ? If so would you go again ? Have been considering that place for years and always change my mind the closer I read the brochure it just seems like the kind of place that could nickel and dime ya to death ...
570587,Guest,2008-01-08 16:33:00,0,Which lodge are you referring too? I believe theres 2 lodges on Rowan lake. What kind of fishing are you after?
570601,Guest,2008-01-09 11:24:00,0,Nielsens is the name of the place
570602,Guest,2008-01-09 11:31:00,0,"Looking for a trophy muskie and also some action maybe some Walleye, bass or lake trout."
570608,Guest,2008-01-09 13:12:00,0,I was there a couple times years ago chasing Muskie and saw a few didn't catch any. My fault not theirs. Walleye could be diffict due to very clear water. Lake trout in the spring is good or so I was told. We caught a few down rigging in July. I have other places I would like to go before I went back. But I would consider going back. I like Don Pursch the operator. I ended up paying more airfare due to weight restrictions on fly in.
570697,Guest,2008-01-13 15:48:00,0,Wow for the rates they charge just seeing a few does not sound like a very good trip to me. I see what you mean about nikel and diming ! I have never heard of having to pay extra rent swivel for a boat seat. I would steer clear and try a different place myself
570885,Guest,2008-01-19 08:41:00,0,Place sure advertises alot. Saw them at show last weekend seemed like nice people

We only found them on the portages (only caught 2). They also have good laker and northern fishing. I don't think we were ""nickle and dimed"". There boats were fine and we didn't up-grade anything. The food was outstanding."
