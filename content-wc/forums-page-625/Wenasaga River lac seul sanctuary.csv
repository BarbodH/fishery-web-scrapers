Guess the benifit is when I get back, much prettier than the guys to look at and dinner is cookin! See your from Blair? We live in Plattsmouth. Small world! Drop me an e-mail."
570778,bpetersen,2008-01-15 21:01:00,251,FlyInOnH20 I have been trying to get my wife to go up with me. It's getting closer. Is the navigation as bad as I have been reading? It looks like Cox Island south is the worst. How about Goose Island and Sawmill for shallow spots? Pete
570863,Guest,2008-01-17 18:05:00,0,"Yes the lake is FULL of land mines. Not sure if the 2008 Canadian Navonics chip is better. Know the previous chip DOESN't show all reefs. If you ""stay"" in the somewhat marked channel your are ok. Once you stray out of the channel, you need to pay attention to your depth locator. On the N and S side of Cox you have a couple of reefs to watch out for. Sawmill > shallow area but ok if you stay in the old creek. Between Lunker Point anf the mouth of Sawmill is a hump and depending the water level sometimes is a idle area or go around the island/stump field to the south. There are places where the front of my boat is in 1-2' and the back is in 40'. Boat is 20.5'. In 16 years I have personally damaged 2 lower units, 3 skegs and 2 props. Suprised the Insurance Co still insures it! Replacing lower units up there is +2K. Pay attention the the locator and land contour and you will be Ok. When you don't is when you pay the price."
570702,bpetersen,2008-01-13 22:20:00,251,Does anybody have the GPS coordinates of the Wenasaga River sanctuary. I have read it starts at the rapid and goes toward Lac Seul. I have been trying to find GPS reading in the 08 fishing regulations but can't seem to find them in the manual. It will be my first time at Lac Seul and don't want to mess up. Pete
570707,Hump,2008-01-14 08:34:00,578,Where are you staying. It is pretty easy to find.
570708,Walleye_Slayer,2008-01-14 08:36:00,134,There are signs posted at the mouth of the river on both sides. just make sure you stay outside (toward the big lake) of the imaginary line between the signs. Also there is a bay prior to the mouth of the river. You can fish that as long as you don't go into the stump mine field that cuts it off from the river. Only if the water is high can you get through the first opening anyhow. There are no signs in the first opening. A Bad Day Fishing is Better than the Best Day at Work Best Reguards Walleye_Slayer :cheers:
570709,Guest,2008-01-14 09:11:00,0,Pete. I gave you coordinates to the enterance. You will see the signs from here and you cannot go further into the santuary to fish before June 15. 50.38.089N 093.08.314W
570719,Guest,2008-01-14 14:29:00,0,"Hump, I will be staying at Cherob's by White Wing resort. Small set-up, only 3 cabins. We shall see. Pete"
570721,Hump,2008-01-14 14:35:00,578,I have found that if it is a late spring it is hardly worth the trouble of fishing there. Otherwise it is pretty good. When are you heading up?
570724,Guest,2008-01-14 14:43:00,0,"Any other suggestion, feel free to e-mail me. Pete[email protected]"
570725,Guest,2008-01-14 14:48:00,0,I will be there June 7 - 13 2008.
570737,Guest,2008-01-14 17:57:00,0,By the time you get there most of the Big fish will have moved on out of that area. There will be a few males lurking around but the masses will be out of there. Try the islands out in front of of the river (Goose Island) and all the way down to Steamboat Narrows. The islands (Cox) just south of Sawmill Bay are also goood that time of year. Cherob is a very nice place and Rob will take care of you! Will try to save a few fish for you> will be up for the last 2 weeks May Enjoy
570738,bpetersen,2008-01-14 18:23:00,251,"FlyInOnH20 Two weeks, you must be single or have a very understanding wife. Would you mind giving me an update when you get back or a post on your success? If you send me an e-mail address. I would contact you a couple of days before I leave if you wouldn't mind. Pete[email protected]"
