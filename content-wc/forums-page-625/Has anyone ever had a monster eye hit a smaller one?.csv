This isn't the first time that I have seen this. I have had big pike and and a few muskies come in this way, as I sure everyone has. I was curious if this has ever happened to anybody out there, and if anyone knew the facts on if walleyes eat their own, or this is just an act of agression. This is definetly not an everyday occurance. I look forward to your input."

570855,Jimmy Jig,2008-01-17 14:38:00,1905,"I and several others had this happen at LacSuel. It was in Loon Rapids and the same thing happened over a 3 yr. period. This very large walleye would attack a hooked small walleye, it would hit it sideways and hold on until we could see the fish and then let go before it could be netted. If we let the small eye down again it would take it again. Once I had that fish on 3 or 4 times before it finally gave up. I am sure it was always the same walleye and I have never had it happen again in any other place. L.S. is noted for northerns doing this, alot!"

570857,Guest,2008-01-17 15:48:00,0,Small Walleyes in the 5-9in range make excellant bait for larger Walleyes. I have witnessed native fishers who can do it legally in Ontario do this. I have also seen fish of over 10lbs caught with this method. Large Walleyes will hunt the small walleyes..... PS Don't shoot the messenger please.
570866,Guest,2008-01-17 22:54:00,0,"Yes - I was guiding and we were fishing on the big reef near Huggins bar on Lake of the Woods and I hooked what felt at first to be a normal size walleye and then it felt big - I reeled it to the boat and saw it briefly - It was about 8 pound or more - and then it was gone - but I still had a small walleye on and when I reeled the small one in, it was all sliced up. It's amazing how those big fish can hold on with out being hooked."

The 12 incher was way too big to swallow, but the bigger walleye grabbed it anyway. The bigger one let go as I tried to net both of them, but I caught it a few minutes later."
571002,Mike Kansas,2008-01-24 10:11:00,1463,I have had Big Pike and Muskie grab a Walleye at the boat but have only ever had one Big Eye do the dirty deed. We were Walleye fishing on the Red River at Selkirk Manitoba in the fall and I had a Sauger on when a nice Walleye came up and clamped on. She only held the Sauger for a few seconds and spit it out when I applied pressure. That's only one time in 50 years of Walleye fishing.

571029,Guest,2008-01-26 00:39:00,0,I've never seen a walleye hit another walleye but have seen a walleye reeled up to within 5 or so feet from the boat holding onto about a 15 - 18 inch pike. What a pig that fish was.
