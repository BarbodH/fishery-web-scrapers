It appears to me that the Ontario regs restrict you to no more than 4 hooks on a line-with a treble hook on an artificial counting as one hook. Am I correct that you could for example fish a line with a jig, a spoon and a spinner rig and still be in compliance with the regs? Do any of you fish multiple lures-baits on one line and how effective is it? I am interested in spring, summer fishing out of boat. Even if legal wouldn't line snarls be a problem?"

A few years back I thought about using a big jig as a dropper for a three way rig like I fished in the Mississippi. Did some research and found it to be illegal. It´s best to keep it simple anyway. Hope this helps."
570889,Guest,2008-01-19 10:32:00,0,Does that mean when I fish my crappie rig with 2 hooks and a minnow on each hook that I am illegal?
570892,Guest,2008-01-19 12:34:00,0,"We handline in the spring with upto 3 lures,, as long as there isnt a total of 4 hooks your good to go"
570921,north_alabama,2008-01-21 10:24:00,172,"Yes, unless they've changed for 2008. Treble hooks on a lure each count as a single hook, but as three when tied to a line. Single hooks count as 1. I actually called the MNR and talked to an officer a couple years ago to clarify this. I discussed a 3-way rig with him with a crankbait and a spoon, and he said as long as there weren't more than four hooks total (in this case they all four could be trebles) I was okay. Using the 3-way rig did not violate the 1-line rule either. I use the 3-way rig the get some depth to smaller ""walleye"" spoons without having to use a weight or a mile of line. If you don't mind the occasional tangle, it's reasonably effective, especially if you're not sure what the fish want. I also use a heavy jig with a tube ""drop-shotted"" about 6' above when jigging for lakers. Never got a fish on the tube, but they seem to hit the jig more readily."
570922,dirt,2008-01-21 10:49:00,144,"My bad, It does state on the website that you can have one line with up to 4 hooks. Obviously the person I got my information from was misinformed. Good news though, I can now fish multiple baits."
570923,Guest,2008-01-21 12:36:00,0,"Thanks for your input. Your reading seems the same as I read it. Yet, I was concerned if there was an ""official"" position that effectively limits a fisherman to one bait or lure. It appears that you could drop shot or slip bobber with up to 4 separate hooks and minnows spaced apart on one line-wouldn't the perch love that!"
