But i just talked to another resort owner up there and he is saying if you are telling them you are on a fly-in trip that they will look the other way so to speak on older dwi's. The resort owners keep putting on the pressure saying they will lose to much money!! The bottom line is i am not going to worry about it anymore !!!! USA1 16 days away!!!"

517380,Guest,2002-05-07 05:50:00,0,usa1 what day do you cross? Just curious what age group are you guys? We have people from 30 to 60. What did the owner of seperation lake say about the border crossing does he anticipate a problem?? Are you bringing a copy of your birth certificate or the original? Yes i do live in minnesota. I just wonder if it would be wise to reserve a spot on lake of the woods somewhere but at that time of the year and it only being a month away i don't know? You might want to try www.clementsonresort.com if you dont get through the border.

They have a nice picture of the cabin on the nestorfalls web site looks real nice. Michelle told me there might even be a second freezer there this year and you know how important that is. We must hook up and enjoy a few ice cold blues. We fly into the lake on the 8th. I have a question for you guys? Every outpost lake i have been on has had at least a few spots were you could catch a walleye with every drift or pass for a few hours does this hold true for this river system at this time of the year?"
517355,Guest,2002-03-12 22:19:00,0,. I will be upset if >people can actually drive to the lake when they are flying >us into lount.

517368,Guest,2002-03-27 15:47:00,0,Hey usa1 thanks i have a map! Have you seen the cabin on lount? How far is the grassy narrows? Sounds like we (lount lake) that is are centered in between grassy and speration. It is 55 degrees here today in minnesota. There is cabin fever running wild around here. As far as the border crossing usa1 everyone in are group has had a dwi but all are from 6-16 yrs ago so if we get stopped it will be the last time i spend any $$$$ there again.

517351,Guest,2002-02-19 10:21:00,0,"Has anyone here fished this area of the english river? I have read about seperation lake that which is a drive in but i will be doing a fly-in from nestor falls to lount lake that i think is just east of there. Just curious of the fishing i know that Dave& michelle have never steered me wrong but this is a new area of canada for me. I have never fished south of red lake ontario but i here this area of canada is some very fertile waters any suggestions or stories. thanks, The nuker"
517352,manitobawalleye,2002-02-19 16:15:00,885,i am 90% certain that you can drive to lount lake...100 % certain that you can go there easily by boat from seperation as i have done it myself....i am just insure of the road quality directly to lount...it is probably about a 10 mile boat ride from seperation lake campground ....give me a few days to see if i can find out for sure and others on this site may have made the road trip....
517353,Guest,2002-02-20 10:45:00,0,"Hey, manitoba thanks. How did you do on lount i will be going there the second week in june. I will be upset if people can actually drive to the lake when they are flying us into lount. What kind of minnows are in that river system?"
517354,Guest,2002-02-20 22:14:00,0,"NUKE I have been going to sep.lake for the past 10yrs.I have fished LOUNT LAKE.Dont know about drive to.I will be at SEPARATION LAKE the same week you are.Spend most of the time on sep.lake.Fishing is great.The times I have been on LOUNT LAKE.Fished heart shaped bay,south bay,lost bay,reef bay and the many islands.Watch out for the rocks in this part of the eng.river.What lake did you go to from red lake.I use to take fly-outs from there to."
517356,Piscatorian,2002-02-20 23:13:00,12,"I fished Lount about 21 years ago, the first time I ever fished in Canada and I was about 14 years old. I've been hooked ever since. I would not be surprised if the camp you are going to is the same location where I was. Back then, it was a very primitive camp, with about 3 tent-cabins (hard sides and soft tops). There will be lots of small pike there. You'll probably have to venture rather far out to find better sized ones. Pretty good walleye fishing. I remember a place they called the Glory Hole where we did most of our damage. It was a deep, narrow current area about 18-21' deep, if I can remember. I also remember doing very well in a small lake that was accessible through a small, narrow passage. Lots of pike and some nice walleyes. Best of luck."
517357,Guest,2002-02-21 09:30:00,0,"Thanks guys, Hey u.s.a.1 i have fished sharpstone lake, lake herod, one pine, and once flew out of pickle lake terrible drive by the way and fished pipestone lake. maybe we should meet somewhere on the river that week that would be cool. you could show me some hot spots(lol) Have you caught any small mouth or muskie they say there are a few of them in there. keep in touch."

517359,Guest,2002-02-28 12:18:00,0,"I have been fishing the Separation Lake area for several years and it is GREAT. Big Walleyes, big Pike and Big Smallies. You can't go wrong in this area. Gunny"
517360,Guest,2002-03-01 09:32:00,0,"Hey, gunny and usa1 that is a drive to resort correct?? If so how much pressure is on that lake/river. Do many people venture over to lount which i believe is east of ther correct? What does a guy have to shell out of his pocket for one of these drive to resorts? Hey usa1 you will know who we are that week we will be the group enjoying cold canadian beer and cuban cigars speaking of that have you had any problems with tha canadian DNR i know that every beer in a boat is a $50 fine. I like my beer but for that price i dont think so. I have always been on remote lakes so this has never even entered are minds before. Hope to hear from you guys soon."
517361,Guest,2002-03-01 13:49:00,0,"I have fished this system for the last 13 years.When the law went into effect on the beer, we didn't drink in the boat but always had some with us thinking if we waited until we got to shore we would be ok.We would have a couple while we were fixing shore lunch thinking this was legal.Well we were stopped by the fish and game and told us the particulars about the beer deal.Both of them said that they thought the law was ridiculous as long as people kept it in check and they didn't have a problem with it.They didn't write any tickets but told us they didn't have a problem with the shore lunch before dinner drinks.They did say if your intoxicated we will take you to jail, and that if your stopped by the O.P.P. it will be a different story even if you have unopened beer in the boat in a cooler.My father and brother were stopped last year on Gullrock by the fish and game and were told the same thing.I don't carry any beer with me anymore, its not worth the risk but I don't have a problem with having a couple of beers before the fish are done.I do have a problem with those that get juiced while fishing though, they shouldn't be on the water!"
