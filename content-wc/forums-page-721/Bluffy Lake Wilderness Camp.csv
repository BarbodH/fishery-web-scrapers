553906,Guest,2006-01-19 11:14:00,0,Has anyone gone here before. It is up by Ear Falls ON. I have searched the message board and there have been a few comments. I would like a new view. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks. We are going in June. I have been to Caribou Falls lodge on Lake Tetu and loved it.....a comparison would help. Thanks in advance

You don't have to go far from camp to catch fish and the lake never gets too rough that you can't get out on it. I haven't been there for 8-9 years, I understand he has built some new cabins and you can drive much closer to camp."
