The ice on our lake was not over 12 inches thick and there was slush about everywhere, with the snow about knee deep in the bush. There were very few ice houses on the lake, because the only way you could get them out there is by snow machine. I am sure temperatures will dictate ice out, but unless things change is does not look like there will be much to melt, and as for water levels, it can snow a lot between now and May."
