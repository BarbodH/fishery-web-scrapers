553938,Guest,2006-01-21 00:36:00,0,"That is very true! The salt destroys the bodies of cars. I now in southern Quebec, anywhere around Montreal they also use salt. They use more sand further west (like Alberta), but have now started using some salt as well. If the sand is low quality, then it gets full of small rocks, and windshield replacements become more of a problem. In northwestern Ontario most places use sand. NWO Fishing Bum"

The hood rusted thru in the corners after 1 more year and the underside was coated with rust. A carfax revealed the original owner was from Quebec. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

I'm still driving a 1991 Ford Explorer, original paint, and there is very little rust on my vehicle. Mind you, it gets an oil based rust inhibitor treatment every fall."
