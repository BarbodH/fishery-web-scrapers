ONLY IF YOU DONT MIND RIDEING WITH YOUR 40hp FOR 4 HOURS TO EITHER END OF LAC SEUL. LOTS OF WATER BETWEEN THE WEST SHORE AND THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF LAC SEUL. YOU CAN CATCH PLENTY OF FISH WITHIN 1 HOUR OF THE COVE. GOOD LUCK"
554006,Guest,2006-01-24 16:39:00,0,would like some feedback on this camp and area of lac seul.considering family trip in august.. thank you... jig

554039,Guest,2006-01-25 16:18:00,0,"Most of my 5 trips to Fishermans Cove were in mid July. 100 fish per boat days are common. Most days we invested in a 45 minute boat trip east/southeaast to the numerous honey holes. Keith and Dan could point out a few good spots. Check the Walleye Central archives - lots of good info. Get a good map and a good compass. GPS helps, but is not necessary if you're experienced on ""larger"" lakes. Favorite tactic is trolling a spinner rig behind a 1/4 oz. weight. We start 1/4 oz. jiggin one we find lots of em. Tip the spinner/jig with a minnow or leech or crawler (they all work). Gulp works good too. Conventional wisdom expects the wallies to be at midlake reefs and humps in deeper (25') water. But, we still found most of them in 8-12 fow. Weedlines, dropoffs, big rock reefs, etc. August may be different (deeper). Don't forget the previously mentioned sand banks. Ask Keith about the square rock. Fisherman's Cove is the best operation I have visited in 20 years of Canadian fishing trips (I am not affiliated with them - just a very satisfied guest). They will take good care of you. Be careful out on the water. Many rocks & reefs to trash your lower unit, prop or worse. Windy days can make crossing big water dicey. Have an experienced boater is each boat. Mr. Sauger"

554068,Guest,2006-01-26 09:30:00,0,"Yes, there is fishable protected water closer to camp. Their web sight, www.fishermanscoveontario.com ,provides all the info in their printed brochure. The Fishing Camp is pretty quiet. Mostly fishermen out fishin all day. The ""lodge"" may serve meals, but not much activity outside of that. I think there was a floating platform for swimming and diving."
