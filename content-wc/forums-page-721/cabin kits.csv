Most Canadian newspapers can be pulled up online where there is valuable info in the classifieds, such as property for sale, boats , motors , contractors, etc."

I am picky, and will say they have done good work for us and was impressed by their craftmanship in a new house we monitored the builing of two years ago. I know they spent this last summer working on a lake just north of Sioux Narrows so your place would probably be within their working range. I have two numbers on Bob Hampe, one is home and the other is his cottage, I believe 807-937-5838 is the home and 807-755-2143 is the cottage but am not sure, probably best to try in the evenings. A lot of locals go south for a couple of weeks this time of year, but Bob's wife teaches, so I would imagine he should be around. They are the only suggestion I have for your area, as our place is located east of Dryden, quite aways from you. We just got back from Canada Monday. It is just as nice in the winter,in a different way, than it is in summer. You might want to consider a winterezed cabin. Good luck."
