553660,phern,2006-01-07 00:54:00,151,"If you are using a spinning reel....stay away from fluorocarbon line. Is it absolutely necessary for you to use fluorocarbon line? What are you fishing for? What type of water? How deep? If it's for walleye in shallow water....why not use a good 4 lb test mono? Fish do not only see line. They can also feel the line displace water as it moves through the water. This displacement causes very slight changes in water pressure that the fish's lateral line can quickly and easily detect. Ever see an underwater vidéo where a huge school of fish suddenly change direction at the same time? It isn't choréographed before hand. It's the very slight difference in water pressure between the fish that causes the fish to move together at the same time. Eyesight is not fast enough to do this. It takes a certain amount of time for the signal from the eyes to reach the brain, the brain to react and send a signal to the muscles. The lateral line is connected all along the muscles on the side of the fish. If you want to use 4 lb fluorocarbon line....you will have to accept the fact that fluorocarbon is quite fragile."
553681,MoWalleyeguy,2006-01-09 09:09:00,409,I am not sure about the post that said don't use Fluorocarbon on a spinning reel since I do and have for over 2 years now. I prefer fireline but in clear water situations I use floro in either 6 or 8 pound. Its WAY more sensitive then mono and denser also so it sinks much faster and soesnt streach like mono does. Set your drag light and play the fish and you won't have any troubles. I use the Bass Pro Shops brand... XPS Signature Series Fluorocarbon. I normally re-spool line every 4-6 weeks and even more if I am hitting the water really hard.
553734,Guest,2006-01-12 14:18:00,0,I have problems with knots NOT holding when using floro. This seems especially true with the chinc(SP??)knot. What knots do you recommend?
553739,MoWalleyeguy,2006-01-13 08:58:00,409,"I would recommend a Trilene Knot or cinch knot of some kind... maybe even a San Diego Knot. I would NOT recommend a Palomar knot! Also, its a MUST to re-tie every hour or even sooner. wow... yes re-tue that often! Also when tieing the knot make SURE the knot is wet... even go as far as to do the final cinching underwater. Another note is to becareful when using needlenose pliers or any kind of hook outs. If you nick the line it will fail. Check your line often and if its frayed or nicked then cut off the bad and re-tie. Is all of this worth it?... Well I believe it is. In one particular situation I know I have outfished my partner 15 to 2 with me using Flourocarbon. It all depends on the situation and if you want to catch a few more fish. In clear water I don't think there is anything better then Flouro. In stained water, I use fireline when the situation allows. Look at it this way, you spend all kinds of money to go fishing, then spend a little time doing it right and catching a few more fish!"
553754,haybaylarry,2006-01-14 16:41:00,55,I use berkley vanish. It is excellent line. I also use it to make live bait rigs. They stand up to abrasion well and have no problems with knots. I make the live bait rigs for my self and aslo sell them. I have never had a problem with this line or a customer concern...larry
