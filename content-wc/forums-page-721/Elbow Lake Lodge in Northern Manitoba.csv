Based on their website, it seems like a nice place at a reasonable price--especially their wilderness camp. Are they the only camp on Elbow? How's the walleye fishing? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!"
553975,Guest,2006-01-23 07:09:00,0,"I have fished Elbow Lake for the past 22 years. Have never stayed at Elbow Lake Lodge, has always been a little too high for what you get for us. We usually stay at Caribou Lodge, although it did sell last year, we met the new owner last June and I think he has his head on right. The rates might go up a little, but still the most economical for the area. The area we fish is at the Southwestern end of the chain of lakes known as cranberry #1,#2, #3, then about ten miles of swithchback turns known as the Grassy River(my favorite part) then the river ends at the opening to Elbow Lake. During the fall season the walleyes are in Elbow, in the spring they will be in an area the locals call ""the narrows"" on the end of the chain near Caribou. It has never been advantageous for us to stay at Elbow Lake. Besides if the walleyes have lock jaw we can always trailer to another lake to try something else."
