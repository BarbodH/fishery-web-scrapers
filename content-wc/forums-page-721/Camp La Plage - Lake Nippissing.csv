554011,Guest,2006-01-25 08:00:00,0,Hi Guys Just wondering if anyone has ever fished this area - it is in the north west corner near North Bay. We are planning on booking at this Camp - would like to hear some comments? Thanks Tim
554016,Slimeball,2006-01-25 10:21:00,56,"Tim, North Bay is on the East end of the lake.You do know there is a slot regulation for Nipissing on Walleye-no fish may be kept between 15.7"" and 23.6"" J."
554023,rockpt,2006-01-25 11:42:00,589,"It's actually on the central north shore, between Sturgeon Falls and North Bay. The main concern I would have is the lack of sheltered water and the long runs you'll have to make to get to the French River or the West Arm, where there are lots of islands and protected bays. If you look at a good map I think you'll see that there's some pretty big water around that area and if you get a brisk west wind the waves on the main lake can get big in a hurry. Also, I think there has been more native netting in that area the last few years than in other parts of Nipissing."
554035,Guest,2006-01-25 14:43:00,0,I have heard the wind can get howling on that Lake....Is the best place to fish the French River area?

554037,rockpt,2006-01-25 15:40:00,589,"Tim, Because Nipissing runs west to east without many islands in the main lake, it doesn't take much for the waves to get rolling. And it can get hairy fast. If you have a big deep V, you'll be ok if you know how to run big water. But if you're running a camp boat or something similar, you'll want to keep a real close eye on the weather if you're running around on the main lake. The south shore around Sandy Island and the mouth of the French is very well protected as is the West Arm. Those areas also are more secluded and scenic than the north shore. There are boat-in camps on Sandy Island and I think the camps on the West Arm are drive-in, but there may be some boat-in camps there too. If it were me, I'd find a camp in one of those areas."
