553743,Guest,2006-01-13 11:47:00,0,We've been up in mid august and the fishing has been terrific. The weather can be cold or warm but thats to be expected. Poplar point is a small camp with probably the best rates and the rental boats are quite nice(if needed). And the owners are super friendly.
553745,Guest,2006-01-13 13:08:00,0,Been up there first week of June and had excellent luck in Ranger Bay...non-stop fish catching action. Fished the point and Rock facce just outside of the bay too and caught some larger fish. Caught a couple 5 pounder on a jointed rapala too while fishing pike in 4-6 ft of water.

553504,Guest,2005-12-27 17:28:00,0,Well I've fished Gullrock for about five to sixyears and have always had a great time. Trip is always in 2nd week in sept. However the little lady wants to go on a trip this year(before it was always seven to Eight Guys) My question is what is the better month for fishing and for taking the little lady with? I have never fished spring or early summer in canada I'm sure there is postives and negatives for both.
553506,Guest,2005-12-27 18:49:00,0,"I was at Gullrock last year the third week in June and the walleye fishing was top notch. We caught a lot of fish and many of them were 24-26"". The only drawback was the weather which was cold, windy and rainy. In fact the last three times I've been to Canada it was at that same time and we always had the same weather. As far as I know the best fishing is in June but the weather can be less stable. This year we are going July 8 in hopes of getting nicer weather."
553509,Guest,2005-12-28 09:16:00,0,Just what I was thinking? Better fishing in june better weather in july. Is there much problems with Fly's or other aggressive insects that the little lady would be worried about? We are thinking about the second week in July. What resort do you stay at? And thanks for the info.
553512,Guest,2005-12-28 11:05:00,0,"I made 2 late July ""couples"" trips to Gull Rock several years ago. Fishing was excellent both times......decent numbers, and very good size. As you know, it's a fairly large, round body of water, so anything better than a strong breeze makes for a lot of rolling action, which seemed to be the wives only complaint. We stayed at Weaver's Wilderness Lodge, which was absolutely top-notch. I know the ownership has changed, maybe someone can help out with the new camp name?? This camp is also less than 10 minutes from Red Lake, which was a plus on a couple rainy days, when the ladies wanted a break from fishing, or for having dinner at a restaurant."
553513,2 DOGS,2005-12-28 13:54:00,361,I believe it's now called Wrights Wilderness Lodge. Nice people from what I hear. If you can't get in there you might try 5 Lakes Lodge also.
553515,Minnow Man,2005-12-28 18:36:00,85,Hello Sifty 1 You might want to look at www.goldenhookcamp.com. They are located in a sheltered bay on Gullrock Lake. They have some new modern cabins that are lady friendly. ( fully modern)
553517,Guest,2005-12-28 19:56:00,0,Stayed at Goldenhook and it was nice but also heard good things about 5 Lakes Lodge and Wrights. This year we are going to Lake of the Woods to add muskies to the menu.
553525,mrwalleyesneighbor,2005-12-29 14:39:00,10,"Yes, it is now Wrights Wilderness Camp, and as far as a ""family"" oriented camp, I must say they will try to accomodate. The last time I was there Lee took his better half and another lady out and were water skiing and pulling a tube around the lake. I had heard he may add some jet skis, unsure if he received those or not."
553528,Guest,2005-12-29 17:33:00,0,"Yes, indeed we will try to accomodate. We have a couple of kayaks free for guests to use. Most people don't go very far, unless they've been conditioning. And no- Jet Skiis are not in our vision for the camp. Sorry! Good luck in your search!"
553549,Guest,2005-12-31 10:18:00,0,"Link if you get up to Gullrock again give 5 Lakes lodge a call. We've been there 6 years now, Bud we'll put you on some muskies. We usally spend a day fishing for them and have seen alot. As far as the oringal question I have fished Gullrock every month And fill as long as the weather is right you will catch fish."
