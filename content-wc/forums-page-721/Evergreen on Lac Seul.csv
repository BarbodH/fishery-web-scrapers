Lac Seul lodge Evergreen Silver Water Wheel Lac Seul has many great resorts I havent been at but we are trying new ones again this year. Every place we have been the fishing has been awesome. Lac Seul is truly a great fishery.

553522,tlars,2005-12-29 11:26:00,137,"My wife and I are heading to Evergreen Lodge on May 27 for a week. I'd love to talk to someone about what to expect, maybe some spots to start with. Thanks."
553524,Hump,2005-12-29 13:27:00,578,I stayed there for the first time last year. Excellent. E-mail me and I will fill you in on any questions. I am going back June 24th. [email protected]
553534,Guest,2005-12-30 09:33:00,0,"It is hard to give you any spots right now because we do not know what the water temps will be. I would tell you to get in line at Sawmill or Chamberlain Narrows and you would be safe starting there. I would suggest getting a guide for at least the first day to get you around and show you the patterns. The resort and owners are about the nicest you will ever stay at. If you are renting a boat, see if you can get the bigger boats. They have 16 foot Alumacrafts and also 18 foot Misty Rivers. The 18 foot boats will take on any waves that Lac Seul can offer."
553550,Guest,2005-12-31 10:52:00,0,"Dave is right, 3 years ago you could hardly get to Sawmill by due to a late spring thaw. Many fished the area around the mouth of the Winnesaga river and the islands just to the south. By mid-week the lake was open and boats were jammed into Sawmill, Winnesagua river. turkey creek and Sunlight just to name a few. Once you get there, ask questions... Where How deep What presentation Don't worry.... you'll catch fish!"
553565,Guest,2006-01-01 12:18:00,0,Where is Chamberlain Narrows?
553568,2 DOGS,2006-01-01 16:56:00,361,I think he meant Steamboat Narrows or Shanty Narrows. I believe Chamberlin Narrows is on the eastern part of the lake.

553569,Guest,2006-01-01 17:07:00,0,I did mean Steamboat

553576,Mike Kansas,2006-01-01 20:36:00,1463,"The owners of Evergreen and their employees will give you valued information on where and how to catch fish when you arrive. I have stayed at nine different Resorts on Lac Seul and Evergreen gets a five star rating from me. The only reason my wife and I havent gone back to Evergreen is the fact that we like to go to different Resorts every year. We were at Evergreen in 2004 ( Last week June) and my wife caught a 31 1/2"" Walleye and we caught around 400 Walleye for the week. Have a great time and enjoy Gary & Pat's hospitality."
