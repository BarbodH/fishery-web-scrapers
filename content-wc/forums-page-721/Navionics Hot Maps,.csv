553942,bob888,2006-01-21 09:41:00,244,"I'm about to purchase an Lowrance 334c. Was going to purchase the Navionics Hot Maps Gold series North Region as I routinely fish Lake of the Woods and my fishing partner is using that map on his Lowrance and I've viewed it. It would do everything I need. Going to the Navionics web site that map seems to be no longer listed. They do list a Navionics Hot Maps Classic North Region that has Woods on it. The sections covered are: Lake of the Woods -NW (incl. Clearwater/Portage Narrows),NE (incl. Kenora/Witch/Bigstone Bays) & SE (incl. Sioux Narrows/Nestor Falls). Two questions, does anyone know if that map covers Sabaskong Bay, Miles Bay, Basil Channel, and Little Traverse Bay areas? And/or has the Gold map been just renamed to the ""Classic"" and is the same? If the Classic is the same as the Gold I would prefer to purchase it as there may have been map updates. By the way, I don't want to purchase the Premium Hot Maps series as the North region does not provide Woods. And that is the primary lake for which I need a navigation map. Because I also fish Iowa and Minnesota lakes I would need to purchase two cartridges if I went with the Premium maps. Thanks for any help. Bob"

553959,bob888,2006-01-22 06:44:00,244,I was wrong. The Navionics Hot Maps Premium North does include Lake of the Woods Ontario and MN according to the Navionics web site. Bob

553974,bob888,2006-01-23 04:53:00,244,Go to this link.http://www.navionics.com/PremiumLake...asp?RegionID=5 Lac Seul is listed as a high definition map.
553988,Guest,2006-01-23 17:21:00,0,Jeff from Navionics said they are not quite done with the survey of Lac Seul. He didn't go into too much detail but said there was more detail to be added in the NW end. It will take about a year for the chip to be complete in that area.
