553878,Guest,2006-01-17 16:39:00,0,Looking for feedback on Snake Bay on LOTW. Most of the info in the archives is dated back 2-3 years ago.
553883,Flip Silverlake,2006-01-17 21:33:00,645,"Lots of Bass and Northerns. Not well marked so you really have to be good with a map or use a GPS with a mapping unit, lots of rocks just below the surface. Outlets into Whitefish Bay which is gin clear, but also very rocky. You'll be looking at about a 35 mile run to Yellowgirl Bay to start to get into Walleyes. Most folks fish in Sunset Channel and Dead Broke, which is even further than Yellow Girl. Really pretty on that end of the lake, but you'll be running over some fairly large water. Any way good luck."
553903,fishanytime,2006-01-19 09:34:00,63,"I fish out of Snake Bay, park my trailer at Paradise Point RV. My GPS says its about 14 miles to Yellow Girl. As Flip said, lots of northers and some walleyes in May and June can be found. Many of the worst rocks are marked with gallon jugs but a good map or GPS with mapping is required. We always catch some bass as well."
553931,Guest,2006-01-20 19:06:00,0,"if you had done any research,you would know that snake bay has been overfished commercially and most of the good fishing is a little further south near calvert island whitefish bay.small (hammerhandle) northerns inhabit snake bay as well as (cigar) walleye.occasionally you will catch some 10-12 inch bass but you could get that in northern wisconsin.try a real walleye lake (lac seul)or head to saskatchewan. i hope they feed you well, fishing will be slow. jig"
553933,Flip Silverlake,2006-01-20 20:58:00,645,"Fishing for Walleyes in the Yellowgirl Bay and a little north of there is not bad. Nice size and plenty of spots. Just watch the weather. I do find it fun to have a challange, even if it's a 20 mile trip up the lake. The boat ride was half the fun."

Probably has been overfished but it can be very good, have to work for those walleyes but they will be nice. You can only catch keep two and then its just a jump to some of the best Lake Trout fishing in the area, northern, bass and muskie. As Flip said you can run north for lots of walleyes if thats what you want. I certainly don't mind if Jig fishes Lac Seul though. I understand the natives are netting there also. Killing walleyes before putting them in the livewell on Lac Seul doesn't appeal to me."
553961,srj,2006-01-22 10:16:00,971,"Jigmeister, where would one research the commercial fishing on Snake Bay?"
554033,Guest,2006-01-25 14:17:00,0,"Jigmeister, It sounds to me as though you are a pond fisherman based on the fish you have caught and may not have an actual clue as to the area or any part of LOTW for that matter. I am gussing you reside somewhere in Iowa or Illinois and are just looking to be negative. Most of your comments tell us nothing about the area, other than the fact you haven't been there. I have been there and that area for 7 years striaght and it offers some of the best fishing you can find. Your comments are very broad and tell me you might be wasting time on waters that are too big for you. Good luck at Lac Seul."
