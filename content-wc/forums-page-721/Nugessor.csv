553910,Guest,2006-01-19 14:41:00,0,years ago in early 70's late 60's we went to Nungesser via the river with our own boats and camping equip. 2 tents and camped on East end. I don't no if this is allowed by Ontario anymore. Previosly we had flown 4 times and when mining road was extended we started to boat in. Great lake then gets plenty of pressure now. Then only one camp on west shore and Green fly-in camp and 3 cabins with outfitter on lac suel. Sounds like lake still produces though. Our trips were early June and early Sept.
553911,hoosiercanadian,2006-01-19 15:50:00,104,"A couple of years ago I rented a 12 foot Lund and a 9.9 motor in Red Lake , put the Lund on top of my Suburban, not an easy task by the way, drove up the Nungessar road to the boat launch on the river, took the boat off the truck, launched in the river. Went the 7 miles up the river to where you are stopped by the rapids, took the motor off the boat, packed it across the walkway to the other side of the river, then I had to pull the Lund up the hill, rolling it on logs , then another trip down the walkway to pack fishing gear, life jacket etc. fished that day in a driving rain, caught some good walleye, a few jacks, couldn't really go very far as it was kind of choppy and we wern't it a boat that I wanted to go very far in. Then reversed the process, at least the boat went down the hill easier than it went up! Although it was a good day ,and good exercise,I don't plan on going through that much pain to fish that lake, it can be fished as a day trip but it is an extreme amount of work. Needless to say I slept well that night."
553912,Guest,2006-01-19 17:01:00,0,We went to the outpost camp on Nungesser about 15 years ago. This camp is owned by the people at Goose Bay on Lac Seul. I was 50 at that time and the oldest in the group of 8. It was a great experience to be back in the bush away from everybody and the fishing was good however as the previous post stated it was a lot of work. If you are a softy you better think twice about going. This kind of work is for young fellows.

553939,Guest,2006-01-21 07:37:00,0,"lot of rocks and reefs ,good map or GPS a plus. I understand some critical spots are now bouyed. Have a great trip and report back"
553944,Guest,2006-01-21 11:00:00,0,Does Garman or any other gps company have electronic map coverage for Nungesser that you can download for your gps unit?
553714,Hump,2006-01-11 13:24:00,578,"I thought that to get to nugessor you were picked up at Balmertown and then boated to camp. I was looking at the map in the last Midwest outdoors and it doesn't appear to me that there is any lake or river that goes there. If so, how do they get there and how long and how far? Thanks"
553716,Guest,2006-01-11 13:56:00,0,What camp are you interested in at Nungesser? I believe there are 3 outfitters on Nungesser.
553719,Hump,2006-01-11 15:35:00,578,I'm not interested in a camp. I go to Lac Seul. Just wondered about getting there.
553720,hoosiercanadian,2006-01-11 16:03:00,104,"Nungessar,i'm assuming you are inquiring about the lake north of Red Lake? It is about a 7 mile boat ride up the Nungessar river then you are stopped by a set of rapids, there is a boardwalk up a hill to the other side of the rapids where you continue on to the lake."
553886,BigDave2,2006-01-18 08:09:00,104,How is the fishing on Nugessor in the middle of June? We are looking at taking a trip up there this year.
553890,Guest,2006-01-18 13:36:00,0,"I HAVE ONLY BEEN THERE ONCE IT WAS IN EARLY JULY.... GOOD SIZED PIKE ( 42""ER OUR BEST THAT TRIP) A LOT OF WALLEYE WITH A CHANCE AT A TROPHY. WHAT LODGE ARE YOU LOOKING AT?"
553899,BigDave2,2006-01-19 07:48:00,104,We are looking at Kevin Geary's Anglers Kingdom. The pictures look good to catch big pike. I just want to know if it really true. How many pike did your group catch in the 40 inch range?
553900,Guest,2006-01-19 08:22:00,0,"that time of year should be a good time for casting the the weedbeds with weedless spoons. i caught my only trophy pike on that trip at the ""narrows"" when we went in early july ...be sure to check out the narrows. i would also check the numerous creeks and rivers that run into the lake. the weedbeds around these usually hold nice fish. it was hot when we went up there .. we only got one trophy , but numerous 33- 38 inchers. if you are jigging for eyes and the action stops be ready for a pike to hit your bait. we caught quite a few jigging for eyes. the walleye are numerous and pretty good size. the ""wall"" is good, and there are a lot of islands where you can get into walleye on the drop- offs. we stayed at nungesser lake lodge. chad and tonya fortner are the owners. they are great people who do an excellent job. if you contact them, tell them bob bramlett said hi. any more questions , feel free to email me directly....i love to talk about canadian fishing.[email protected]"
553907,Guest,2006-01-19 12:19:00,0,"any way to fish this lake without staying at one of the camps? can you drive in and land a boat some where or somehow boat in? thanks, don"
553909,Guest,2006-01-19 13:13:00,0,"I DON'T THINK A GUY CAN BRING HIS OWN BOAT IN , UNLESS THERE IS A ANOTHER WAY OTHER THAN THE WAY WENT.... BY RIVER , THEN OVERLAND A FEW HUNDRED YARDS, THEN INTO THE LAKE. I COULD BE WRONG, BUT IT IS PRETTY ISOLATED......"
