509397,TeeDub,2000-08-05 22:35:00,48,"What tends to happen at this time of year, is that the bugs get so bad in the bush that the moose will come out to the right-of-ways by the roads to feed in the evenings. A moose's eyes don't reflect the light as much as a deer's. That, combined with their dark colour make them harder to see at night. Take Frank's advice and stay alert when night driving in Northern Ontario. A thousand pounds of moosemeat sliding over your hood and through your windshield is not something you'd want to see twice!"
