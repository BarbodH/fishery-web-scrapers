I would appreciate any advice as to what area would be best and any lodge recommendations any of you would make. As far as a lodge is concerned my priorities are clean, modern houskeeping cabins with good docking facilities and paved road access. I don't need anything real fancy."

I do understand that the best fishing in the fall is where the lake enters the rainy river in the south end. Thats where we fished this spring. We stayed at Bayview lodge which is about 6-7 miles nw of baudette, mn. we stayed in they're new cabins and they were great. They also had great docking facilities with gas. It is about a 5-6 mile boat ride to lake of the woods, but there will be good fishing all along the river between the cabin and the lake too. I don't have the number for the resort handy but just search the net under lake of the woods resorts, and thats how we found it. good luck."

It all depends on what you really want. I would like to hear from you via telephone@ (807) 274-4584. I would refer you to fishing the river at this time, all the fish are back up in the at this time of the year. The Long Sault and Manitou Rapids are great places to land you Walleye of a lifetime. And on Lake of the Woods this time of the year is equally as great for bass and musky. All fish are fattening up for winter."
