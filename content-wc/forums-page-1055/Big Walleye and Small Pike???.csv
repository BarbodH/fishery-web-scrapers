509377,Beeg,2000-08-03 19:06:00,9,Why do I find Canadian lakes that have 3 to 4 lb. walleye {in large numbers} have small pike? The lakes where I can catch pike over 10 lb. the walleye run in the 1.5 to 2 lb. range.Any ideas???

Two of lakes I told you about (favorable and setting net) that produce trophy pike daily also produce nice eyes consistently as well. I am curiuos to find out if anyone else has had the same experience that you have had and if so why? Good fishing"

My theory is that walleyes and pike are both predators, and that there is only so much room at the top of the food chain. Too many pike displaces the walleye, and vice versa."
