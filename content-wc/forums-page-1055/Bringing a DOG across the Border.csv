509331,GregK,2000-07-31 14:58:00,113,Rabies vacination document (the tag does not count) that is less than 9 months old. Best thing to do is call 1-800-ONTARIO. They can give you bullet proof information.
509332,Guest,2000-08-01 10:23:00,0,Thanks for info everything is taken care of..
509333,Guest,2000-08-01 13:55:00,0,Canadian Custom Officers on Minnesota borders are very diligent about checking for the proper shot records for your dog. It's in your best interest to have your records from your vet. I've seen it delay a fishing trip too many times if you don't
509334,Guest,2000-08-01 14:47:00,0,These guys are bang on correct. We just got back from a fly-in and the first thing Can Customs asked for was the rabies papers. No problem or questions comming back thru US Customs.
509335,Guest,2000-08-05 15:58:00,0,must have health certificate showing shots expecially rabies should be done ahead of travel
