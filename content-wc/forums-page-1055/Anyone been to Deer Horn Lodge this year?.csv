509283,Guest,2000-08-07 09:18:00,0,"Just returned from Deerhorn and the fishing ""Blew Monkey ***!"" It was hot from 7/29 through 8/1, then became variable cloudy and somewhat cooler during the middle of the week and then a cold front came through and the temps were in the 50s.Fishing just sucked! We think its due to three things:1. Too Many Baitfish, we caught more perch than anything else.2. Over fishing3. High water - after three years of low water the reservoire is now at 85% capacity and its the highest that I have ever seen it. I think after three years of low water the huge school of Walleyes that we were used to running into were forced into the larger bays (eg the Big Water) and are not migrating back into the smaller bays.Hope your trip is better than ours!Tight lines!"
