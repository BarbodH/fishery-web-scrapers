Going again this year same time. Could not find eyes on Athapap. Ended up fishing Maraiche about 40 miles away (fishing was out of this world for eyes)but it was no good for trucks and boats driving 20 miles down a gravel road. I have no clue where or how to fish Athapap for eyes at that time of year, I'm guessing that just by the nature of the lake there are some huge ones in there. I would really like to find some being as we are staying at Bakers Narrows lodge. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Also looking for info on where I could get a decent lake map. Thanks!!"
