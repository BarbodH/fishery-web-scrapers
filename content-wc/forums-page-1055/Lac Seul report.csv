509469,Guest,2000-08-08 08:17:00,0,Had our first trip to Lac Seul. What a lake!!! Started catching eye's first five min. and never stopped. We were fishing Ear Falls area out of Golden Fawn Resort. Caught all sizes of eyes and lots. Lodge was great. One of our group had to cancel at the last min. because of ill. to his mother and they gave him back his deposit(almost unheard of these days). Would recomend to anyone eye fishing or lodge.
