509407,Guest,2000-08-05 15:04:00,0,I will be up at Tomahawk Resort next week and was wondering if anyone had a current (within the past two days or more current) report? I have been monitoring the reports for the past 2 months. Are all of the good walleye spots so darn far away from Sioux Narrows. Seems as if Yellow Girl Bay and area are the best. Any info will be greatly appreciated.
