Might be worth a trip down to the 400 mile on either side of the channel. Make sure you stay on structure. Pulling crank baits in open water in front of Seperation Lake Camp. If you have electronics you should be able to find the reefs in the middle of Lount Lake. Smallmouth are also jumping in the boat. Can try 3 to 4 inch grubs on mushrooms jig heads. Try the color cotton candy. Hope this helps you out."
