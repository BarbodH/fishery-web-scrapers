Mostly on a 1/4 oz chartruse jig and crawler. We picked up our over 18"" fish (5@22"") in 15 min. in 12' at noon on a calm day bright sun and clear water. I'd never have believed it if I was'nt there. Smallies cooperated too,but mostly after 6pm. Same way crawler and jig.I would throw a crankbait w/ only follows and my wife and daughter would catch them at boatside. Northerns seemed slow. Mostly small fish 18-24"" w/ only one in the slot 28"" and none above slot. Fun none the less. We fished mostly long bay out to yellow girl. Got out one day to west side of chisholm island and didn't catch a fish, maybe we weren't deep enough. A guy at the dock said he had a real good topwater bite for smallies on a skitterpop. He said pop-r's were to big.He said the bite started at 7:30 pm. Every smallie we caught was puking up crayfish.No delays at the border, we crossed 9 am. sat. took us 15 min. The way back was just as short. Good luck fishing ,hope this helps. Don't forget to post a report on your return that's what this board's about. Tight lines Bob"
