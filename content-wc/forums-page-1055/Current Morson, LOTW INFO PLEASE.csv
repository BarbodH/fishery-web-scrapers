509408,Guest,2000-08-05 20:12:00,0,I am heading up Tuesday AM and will fish Wed thru Saturday. I will be at the Obabikon Bay Lodge with my son and any current info would be appreciated. Will probably throw spinner baits for Northerns and live bait jig/minnows or jig/crawlers for walleyes. My concern is locating walleyes. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.
