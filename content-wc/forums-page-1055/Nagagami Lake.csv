First year fishing was really good, limits of 'eyes everyday on plain jigs, could find spots away from all other fisherman, 2 +40"" pike, next year fishing was slower, had to sweeten jigs with minnows and had to join crowds. Lake is huge, but at least in Spring most fish (and fishermen) are congregated in several spots, mouths of Foch River, Pody Creek, Buck River and Twin Islands. Liddles have 2 camps on lake and there were two other outfitters on lake so these spots could get crowded. I prefer outposts but I would recommend Nag at least for a time or two"
