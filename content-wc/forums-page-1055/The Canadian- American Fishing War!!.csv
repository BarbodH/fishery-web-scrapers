508498,Guest,2000-08-05 12:41:00,0,"Wow, all this over a field check on a guy with no skin on his fillets!! I'll have to remember that next time I do a road block or compliance check. All I can say is that if you fish anywhere, be it Canada or the USA, regulation summaries are available with all licences. I tell everyone I run into to ensure they check the regulations before starting to fish, rather after we issue you a ticket for something you didn't know. As for this idea of a fishing war, both sides of the border have resource violators, so a war is a little overstated. good fishing folks and read the regulations"

508489,Guest,2000-06-28 20:58:00,0,"The Ontario fisheries and wildlife minister has been promoting Canadian fisheries down in the States, needless to say I will not vote for him and his party. I was quite put off when the fishing licenses came out for residence of Ontario but it was an evil I could handle as the funds were going towards the sport I most enjoy. The prices have been raised and of course taxed. The way government works this was forseeable again a tollerated money grab(I pay $15 (I think it $17.50 this year) cnd every 3 years and I buy the card needed to cary my licence on this is 2 dollars cnd). I have not seen much of an improvement in our fisheries since licencing came into effect. I have seen how good the fishing was say 30 years ago but I find the european attitude of catch as much as you can then catch more really took a big bite into our fisheries. I would like to see our rivers streams and lakes get a break, so that the fish stocks can gain back there once plentiful population. So I wouldn't mind seeing the states back off unless you come up here to catch and release and respect a depleating resource. Not just the states but the residence of Ontario who don't know what the regulations were put there for.Anyways that was my rant and fishful thinking Ken"
508490,Guest,2000-06-29 06:54:00,0,"Have been going to Canada fishing for over 20 years and have thoroughly enjoyed every trip. Have only been checked at the border twice and everyone has been polite. However, I wish the folks in the little shacks that ask all the questions would smile once in awhile. Then, if I had to sit in one of those all day and ask the same questions to folks who are on their way to wet a line, I might not be too happy either.Did want to mention something I noticed this year at the lodge we fly out of to our outpost. Was visiting with the staff, the evening prior to our departure, and they had been out fishing that evening (things were kinda slow around the lodge) and when they cleaned their fish to my surprise - what was left on the fillets---you guessed it - a small piece of skin. It's almost like us Americans when we get ready to turn left, we turn on the a left turn signal. It's the law.Don't mind buying bait in Canada, however, they may need to consider it becoming less expensive since soft plastics and lures catch just as many walleye's. Bought 22 dozen minnows, used three.Fishing is a wonderful world no matter where we are, so keep that bobber bobbing and the hook baited."
508491,Robert,2000-06-29 12:21:00,19,"My $0.02.From my perspective as a US cit., I see fishing rigs well in excess of $20,000 going fishing for a once a year Canadian vacation; I have no trouble buying my bait in Canada. No one likes to think they are being ripped off, any place, by anyone; but I find all resorts, even in the US ripping me for bait, as compared to bait shop prices. So I think it's best to try to ask on msg. boards like this, where the good bait shops are. You'll probably get the freshest bait, and local advise. As to preserving fisheries, I'm all for it, and salute Canada for protecting theirs."
508481,Steve,2000-07-19 09:58:00,259,"Wow, I'm still trying to get over Nam and now this! When I fish at my home lake there are rules, you follow them or get burned. When I go to a nearby state to fish, there are rules, you follow them or get burned. Why not another country? I come to Canada for the experience of the whole trip, everything that means ""Canada"" to me. I have taken one walleye home in 10 years or so, cause it was the biggest I had ever caught. We eat a couple during the week, we pick up our garbage, we drive the speed limit, and you know what? We do the same here at home too. I have come to know that a ""jerk"" is a ""jerk"" no matter where they are. Since my canadien friends are intelegent I will assume that most of you guys know enough to see that a few ""jerks"" with computers can cause a lot of problems. I hope the Can/Am war is over soon so I can go back up to my favorite lake in Ontario. I know nothing new was said here, but I feel better now. Hope everyone stays healthy, NOW SHUT UP AND FISH!!!!!"
508492,IaCraig,2000-07-22 15:18:00,434,"It's nice to read civil comments about an issue that I think people misdirected some of their penned up frustrations on. Sometimes it seems people use discussion boards to vent frustrations because the weather's bad, the fishing's been poor or they are just in a bad mood because something is preventing them from doing what they really want. Personally, as long as the supply of bait in Canada keeps up with the demand, I am happy. I'll admit that since I have quite a long drive to Canada it was nice when I could take my own bait so I didn't waste time making stops to find what I like, but I'm not going to get my underwear in a knot over it.I love Fish'n Ontario. I hope they allow my family to return for generations to come, and manage their fishery well so it the trips remain worthwhile.IaCraig"

508495,Guest,2000-08-02 20:16:00,0,"bof...three cheers for ""gettin' it said!"". God gave man dominion over the earth and all that it gives us, however we must be good stewards of the land if it is to continue to produce. Populations will increase and demands on resources will only grow. Efforts (yours and ours) today will go a long way to assuring it to be there tomorrow. I am previledged to travel and enjoy your beautifull country. Good luck...be well!"

508477,Bof,2000-06-14 07:51:00,6,"First of all, I'd like to appologize for what some of my fellow Canadians have said on this message board. Most un-called for. What they don't understand is that ""your"" US dollars are a big part of the funding that actually keep our lakes and rivers full of fish. ""Your"" US dollars employ a great deal of canadians. I am employed with the Government of Ontario, not as an enforcement agent but as a fisheries manager. The reason (as explained below) for not allowing bait transfer is simply to keep non-native species out of our waters. This is essential to keeping our ecosystems in check. Certain species of southern minnows, leeches and other baits occupy habitats of our native species. Some may push an entire species out therefore destroying the ecosystem. The other detrimental effect is parisites, what if the minnows you bring over are infected with a disease that you can't even see, this is then transferred to the lake and there goes ""your"" favorite lake. I hope you guys can see now the effect of bucket transferring. As far as getting harrased. To keep our lakes productive there has to be certain laws enforced. This resource can be decimated, that is why we check your license, hey, even canadians get asked for thier license. As with your catch, It's not hard to fillet a walleye and keep a small corner un-skinned so CO's can identify the fish. Your limit is a generous one, I mean how many fish can you actually eat. How many of you, I know I'm guilty too but how many of you have had fish get burnt in the freezer and spoiled? That's one more fish that would have spawned and got wasted. Our laws are tight but only to protect the fisheries, not to keep Americans away. We as Canadians have to abide by the same laws. It is illegal for us to transfer minnows from one lake to another. The guys that got busted at the boarder recently had broken laws, the took over thier limit and took out of season bass, put that all together and as long as you co-operate with the regulations there is no problem. The regs are there to give Canadians and Americans alike, lakes and rivers to fish now and in the future. So, on behalf of all Canadians I'd again like to appologize for the morons that posted those stupid messages and I'd like to invite all Americans to sample the great fishery we have here in Canada. Tips Up! Bof."
508478,No_Fish,2000-06-14 08:54:00,6,"Dear Bof, Thank you for your thoughtful response to such an emotional issue. It is always nice to hear from a professional Lymnoligist, the facts behind fisheries rules and regulations.As a case in point,the fact that Lac Suel, now has an abundent population of smelt shows what happens with unrestricted bait transfer.As far as tourist dollars are counted, your government and ours consider this issue a wash. That is to say, that Canadians spending their resoures in the U.S. is just as common as U.S. citizens leaving their money in Canada. Having had the previlige to fish in your country from the border waters to Victoria Island, I will always be grateful for having my life enriched by the experence. Thank you again, No Fish"
508479,mkebenn,2000-06-14 09:47:00,59,"Bof, Appology accepted as long as you accept my appology from south of the border. You certainly don't have a lock on morons. I'll be up in Sept. to enjoy your country, buy bait and that wonderfull beer, and eat a couple rock bass. Mike in E.A."
508480,kingsway,2000-06-14 10:11:00,27,"Bof,Thank you for your letter. My wife and I will be leaving home here in Central Wisconsin tomarrow to again enjoy the wounderful country you call home. I have been treated very well by Canadians and have some very good friends there that I have met over the years. I have been checked by your C.O's and they were very polite on every occasion. I guess I feel this way because I stay within the law and treat them with respect.We have people here in Wisconsin that dislike our game wardens and I believe that has alot to do with them breaking our regulations here as well. For the people that complain about the long wait at the border crossings consider this, the reason it takes so long is because so many of the Americans going home have violated the Canidian regulations and are trying to get away with steeling their resources. How would you feel if the situation was reversed? For you Good American sportsmen, I say turn them in so as to make the C.O's job easier and our relationship with our neighbors to the north better. If the price of a few minnows or leeches or gas or the number of fish you can or can't take home bothers you than you need to examine why you go in the first place. It would be much more economical to stay at home, save your money and go to the store and buy some fish to eat. For me, I love to see the wounder of God's creation, smell the freshness during the rain, view a clear starlite night, hear the loones various calls, relax, catch and release a few fish for my grandson or yours to enjoy catching in the future, have one or two great shore lunches, and get to make new friends as well as renew old aquaintances. Life is too short to see all that may be wrong in this world, enjoy life. Take time to smell the flowers and see all that is good in this world of ours. Lastly my apoligies for the way some of my fellow Americans have acted when they visit your country. Please don't judge us all by the actions of a few.Sincerly a sportsman,Richard"
508482,Guest,2000-06-14 10:21:00,0,"Thank you for clearing up some of issues involved here. I have a number of Americans who I fish with and I have rarely hear any complaints as they are up on holidays and are always the first to have their wallets out to buy the first round of drinks. You must be one heck of a fisheries manager, you don't mince words. I thought Harris had gotten rid of all the guys who spoke up. Good fishing: Frank"
