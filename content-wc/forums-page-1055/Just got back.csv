Last Sun. - Tues. afternoon it was hot and flat, Tues. afternoon - Wed. it was wet and windy and finally on Thurs. the temperature was right and there was a slight breeze. The Northerns were mainly hitting on gold Johnson silver minows (3/4), yellow w/red 5 of diamonds (3/4) and mepps spinners black furry's w/gold or black and yellow #5's. The Suicks and bigger baits were not producing much. All in all, great trip but the fishing could of been better!"
509422,Guest,2000-08-07 14:04:00,0,Where did you go?I was up there July 21-28. I was thinking about shifting to August fishing since it was so hot and flat for us also. ThanksJeff

I live up in that area and the weather has been bizzare to say the least - such a long cold spring (and windy) with a slow walleye bite at first - then they went crazy for the last week of june/first two in July. The big northerns seemed to be on scheduale this year, with a good june bite that tapered off in july. All fishing seemed to be slow during the unstable weather (a lot of it!) and lately it has been hot and calm - not good for the walleye, but the smallies are on the prowl I'm told. Haven't been out yet in the heat...Seems like everytime I got out earlier in the year it was cold windy and wet, fortunately I did have some good sessions.I'm on the water next week, and I sure hope mamma nature is nice to me...I've been tying spinners non-stop to pass the time to avoid going banannas since I have to work like a mule lately....My crawlers are eating well and all have first names now - porky, bubba, chubby, piggy, etc etc...Happy Fishing!"
