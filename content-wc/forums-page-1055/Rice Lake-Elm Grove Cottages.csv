How has the walleye fishing been lately?Thanks for any info you could share, and we'll be sure to post when we get back!Thanks!Duane"
509164,Guest,2000-07-20 11:47:00,0,"I am going to Rice Lake on the 28th, I give you the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Along with time of day, temps, depths and gps cords. This should help unless you are going this week!"
509165,Guest,2000-07-20 16:53:00,0,"We stay at Pinecrest near Bewdly,but the eye fishing has changed over the years ! Fish the weeds in the evening near deeper water,this can be intimidating because there are so many weed beds.Try trolling south of Black Island to the submerged R/R AND navigational Xing stay in deeper waternear the weeds,using small crankbaits I prefer the Magnet crankin craw in chartruese and orange,or whisler jigs with 1/2 a crawler.This lake will no longer be considered a walleye lake to me as it has become a tremendous Smallmouth fishery! Oleruff"

509168,Ron,2000-07-22 14:27:00,387,"I spent a week on Rice Lake two weeks ago. Came home with our limit of Walleyes plus what we ate at the lake. This is my favorite lake, I fish it several times per year and will probably be going back mid September. Jig the weed beds, especially the ones in about 10- 12 feet of water. All you need are white or black Mr. Twisters. I use bucktail jigs because they can take lots of abuse and stay sharpe longer. We also had success casting 4 inch jointed minows around dusk, we positioned our boat about 20 feet from the docks and would cast ashore."
509169,Guest,2000-08-04 15:08:00,0,"Just got back from Rice Lake and as I promised here is my report. Trol, 2mph, in 9.5 to 12.2' of water along weed lines with body baits that rattle. I took home my limit and ate very well at the lake. Looking for pan fish? Drift the same area with leaches, crawlers or wax worms. No. 8 octopus hook and 1/8 to 3/16 oz. split shot. With that set up you won't be bothered by little fish only the slab sized gills. Good Luck!"
509170,Guest,2000-08-06 17:59:00,0,"Fuji, glad you had some good luck! Thanks to all for the info. I'm not sure what you mean by body baits; are they the same as crankbaits? Also, did you try using jigs or worm harnesses for walleye, and if so, any luck? What size fish were you catching?Thanks again!Duane"
509171,Guest,2000-08-07 05:05:00,0,"Body baits, wrigle wart, shad rap, big-o, ect. I didn't use any harnesses. I don't like live bait except for leaches and minnows because the worm dirt always gets ground into the carpet and gets tracked all over the place. That is a poor excuse but I did OK without them."
