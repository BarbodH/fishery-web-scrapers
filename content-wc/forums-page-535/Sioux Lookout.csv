1206984,skap,2010-06-04 13:10:00,58,"Heading up next Wednesday the 9th and returning Sunday the 13th. Quick father / son(s) outing. This will be my 10 year or so of this trip. By far the most favorite thing I do each year. Going back again in September with my wife.Any information on how the fishing has been on Minnitaki would be greatly appreciated. Also, with the lower water levels, are there any issues getting up the chutes?Crestliner 1750 fishhawk with a 115 Yamaha"
1207191,HighTech,2010-06-05 07:25:00,75,"I ran the chutes last Sunday. Water is low be VERY sure to hug the inside line ALL the way to the top of the rapids and ONLY then sharp left to get around the red marker at the top. If you were to aim for the center of the red green markers at the top that would put you directly over a dangerous rock in the rapids and you would lose a bottom end for sure. The markers at the top were placed there so that traffic comeing down was forced to swing wide out to have a view of any traffic comeing up. The markers do not actually mark a reef. Keep just inside the red marker at the top and only swing toward the red marker after you have hugged the shore ALL the way to the top of the fast water. Hope I'm clear, that rock is a killer, I know,, I have seen boats hit it and to be honest I was one of them."
