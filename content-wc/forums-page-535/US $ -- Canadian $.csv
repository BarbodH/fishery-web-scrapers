Did you need to exchange any since the US dollar and the Canadian $ are close in exchange rate. Are merchants giving dollar for dollar trade? Crossing at Pembina MB, are there exchange places open later in the evening? Potatoes ?? US Grade # 1 okay to cross or not?Thank You in advance for your responses."
1207051,TIGHTLINER,2010-06-04 16:32:00,223,WE WENT THROUGH AT THE SOO THE FIRST WEEK EVERYTHING WAS DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR. HAD NO ONE QUESTION IT I THINK WHEN I CHECKED WWW.XE.COM IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE $1.0232 NOT EVEN WORTH STOPPING TO CHECK IT BECAUSE THEY DOCK YOU SEVERAL CENTS ANYWAY. WE HAVE FOUND THE BEST PLACE TO GET MONEY EXCHANGED IF POSSIBLE IS AT THE CASINO'S THEY WANT YOU TO PUT THAT QUARTER IN THE ONE ARM BANDITS SO THEY ARE A LITTLE MORE GENEROUS. I CAN REMEMBER YEARS BACK WE GOT 59 CENTS ON THE US BUCK MAKES FOR A CHEAP TRIP. WE BOUGHT A BOTTLE OF CC AT THE BORDER FOR $12.40 FOR 40 OZ. GOOD FISHING EVERYONE..

However, I should mention that in some places they had to give you change back in Canadian. Charge cards were accepted everywhere. I only brought back a couple of dollars in Canadian, so I didn't worry about exchanging it."

We just got back from the French River - stopped in Toronto and used an ATM to withdraw cash. That particular ATM had a $500 limit, so I had to use it twice, and my credit union charged me $1.50 twice for a foreign country ATM. Anyway, I withdrew $700US total and that came to $669 plus change from my account. not bad."
