It is being organized by Jim Chute who runs the Vanity Cup every year in the fall. If your familiar with the Vanity it`s one of North Americas largest and most Prestigious walleye tournaments. I have no doubt that the Big River tournament will be it`s equal. If your up for the challenge check out the website. http://www.bigriverwalleyeclassic.com/
