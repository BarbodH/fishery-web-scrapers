1207636,Guest,2010-06-06 20:01:00,0,"Just back from 9 days on Lac Seul East and Big V. We fished 4 days on Lac Seul and we were over 125 fish in our boat on 3 of 4 days. There were 4 of us in the boat and we averaged 16-20 dozen minnows a day. Minnow consumption was significant as light biters took a lot of minnows. The key to catching such a large number of fish was moving around to find at least one spot with a hot bite and then working it carefully to find where the fish were concentrating from hour to hour. We caught fish in 6-8 FOW in some places and as deep as 20 FOW in other places. Nearly all fish were caught on jigs with live minnows. Jig size was important - 1/8th in shallow to medium depths and 1/4 in deeper water, particularly in windy areas. Best colours were orange, chartreuse and glow white for bigger fish. Some spots yielded a reasonable number of slot size or larger fish. However, we did not get fish larger than 25 inches all week long. All in all, a great week of fishing, even though the weather was quite variable with a couple of days of significant rainfall. Hope to be back up soon."

1207902,Guest,2010-06-07 18:44:00,0,"Big V was interesting because the bass were on their beds and the bedding bass were much bigger than I am used to catching on Big V. This type of sight fishing was a lot of fun for our group as we had not had much experience with this before. We got an incidental 44"" musky and a 31 3/4 "" laker as other highlights. Lakers were generally not in the shallows this year given how early the ice went out so casting for lakers was generally unproductive."
1208059,Guest,2010-06-08 07:58:00,0,"Guys, I have never been to LS but considering a trip in 2011 w/grandson and was wanting more information about the bass in regards to numbers/sizes. The only info I see on the web is basically the fishing is getting better each year but no more details. thx"
1204099,Guest,2010-05-26 07:47:00,0,I see a lot of reports from the West end of Lac Seul but nothing much on the East/Sioux Lookout area. Anyone been fishing over on this end? How's it been? We normally fish around the Chute in Sioux Lookout but heard early reports that the water was so low that you couldn't get up it...true?? Thanks
1204105,81Saluki,2010-05-26 08:00:00,97,It will be interesting to hear what people say about water levels in the area after Monday night's storm (6/24) ... SL got nearly 1.5 inches which should significantly improve things.
1204107,Guest,2010-05-26 08:08:00,0,There was no problem going through the chute even for the opener. Fish were scattered
1207032,wtw_fisherman,2010-06-04 15:12:00,13,How has the fishing been on the East end of the lake?
1207036,fishman10,2010-06-04 15:28:00,226,the water levels in the area have gone up 8 inches since the opener. they are continuing to rise every day. woke up one morning and our boat was floating. never has been a problem going up the chutes.

As this is our first time staying here, does anyone have information on how good/bad the fishing is here. Would appreciate any information we could get. Also how long of a boat ride to get out to the main part of Lac Seul? Thanks."
1207486,SeulAreaWalleye,2010-06-06 09:07:00,100,"If it is your first time on Lac Seul, take a guide with you!! The fishing is NEVER bad here, IF you know where to be and when......have a great trip!"
1207587,wrestle189,2010-06-06 17:20:00,2,"We have fished Lac Seul the last 6 years, usually in the area of eagle island. This will be our first time on lost lake. Thanks."
1207600,brwhite,2010-06-06 18:21:00,41,"I'm at lost island lodge now in the cabin connected to the lodge.we're not getting much on jigs, seems like they're perfering a faster presentation right now, lures and trolling is picking up better. Also the colors blue, white, and silver seem to be hitting. depth about 8-12. Casting into shallow is picking stuff up. Gotta find the right spots though. every once and a while there is a school but seems a tadder scattered"
1207601,prov1900,2010-06-06 18:30:00,544,Just got back from Minnitaki. Fishing was hot!!! So was the weather...
