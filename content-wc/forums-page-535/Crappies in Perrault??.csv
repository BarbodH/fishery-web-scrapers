While he said the fishing was tough this year, he said his group caught eight big crappies in the Ord River. I have fished Perrault many times but not recently. How long have there been crapies there?"
1206497,Kevin R,2010-06-03 04:59:00,305,I have heard but never caught one & I have caught more than a few different kinds of suckers & some other strange looking fish in Perrault & connecting waters.
1206513,Glenman12,2010-06-03 06:07:00,762,Ive never caught one either but our lodge owner said they are there..they call them something other than crappie but I cant remember what it was.
1206964,team walleye,2010-06-04 11:45:00,336,I've been going to Perrault for a long time now and have never caught a crappie in there. To my knowledge Perrault didn't have any crappie in there.... Kind of nice to hear that there might be some in there. I'm sure the Ord holds a lot of different kinds of fish. Does he have any pictures of the crappie they caught?I usually stay at Rocky Shore Lodge and love it. So the fishing has been slow up there this season?
1207359,Guest,2010-06-05 19:38:00,0,I was in Perrault Falls last week and my friend who is a campowner called his buddy at Rainbow Point. He confirmed the rumor about catching Crappie in Perrault Lake. 12-14 inch slabs were brought in.
