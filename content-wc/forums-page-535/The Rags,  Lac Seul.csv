1205351,rnnonmt,2010-05-30 08:26:00,992,Has anyone witnessed the houseboats passing through the rags yet with the current water level? Heading up there June 6th. Wondering if we will have to take the Devil's elbow route instead. Thanks

1204128,Sutsgold,2010-05-26 09:47:00,219,"Guys, I am planning on launching out of Hudson and take what appears to be a river up to the main lake. What is the rags and where is it located? Will I be going through it on this route? I hear of it all the time, but have no idea what or where it is and Id hate to lose my lower unit on a day trip to Lac Seul. Thanks for any help you can provide."
1204166,Walleye_Wrangler,2010-05-26 11:38:00,138,"If it were me.. I'd get a guide for the day. It is well worth the money. Your gonna catch more fish now and in the future. Get to know the hazards of the lake, saving your lower unit. And have more fun. I recommend getting one of the guys out of Moosehorn. One of my better investments!"
1204372,Blackcloud,2010-05-26 21:04:00,2,"I agree with you wrangler, the water levels are low this year. It would probably save you money getting a guide. A few of my friends guide for moosehorn, you will not be disappointed if you get one of them. Check this site out http://www.lacseulguide.com/"
1204750,Guest,2010-05-27 20:09:00,0,"The Rags is a shortcut on the route north from Hudson to Bear Narrows, avoiding the detour around Devil's Elbow. It is a channel between land that is stump filled and shallow (2-3 ft at opener). You would never think of going through there on a plane unless you had previously run it and new the channel/depth. It is marked on the maps I have and if you take it as slow as it appears to warrant on first viewing you should be fine. Having said this, I too recommend a guide as there are lots of other more dangerous spots with unmarked shoals."
1205041,Guest,2010-05-28 16:56:00,0,"I ran through the rags on step on Monday in a 21' with a 115 trimmed to normal. The depth's I passed through were from 2' to 5'. With the rain of the past week, I'd like to think that you'd be fine now. I definitely recommend Colin at LacSeulFishing or maybe one of my friends at Anderson's Lodge. Either way, just be safe out there. dragon"
1205054,brwhite,2010-05-28 19:03:00,41,Is there any good fishing in the rags? I've always fished lost lake and never been past bear paw. The idea of any area that big shallow with stumps makes me think pike. Is it worth exploring?
1205071,Walleye_Wrangler,2010-05-28 19:37:00,138,The muskies keep the pike population low .
1205119,SeulAreaWalleye,2010-05-29 04:57:00,100,"I have been running the rags with a 21'/150 wide open for a few days as well. Graph shows 3 feet, but you still have to know your exact channel if trying this.....Walleyes schools have been more concentrated in the last few days on islands and main points, action has been incredible, big fish too. Look out for the Mayfly hatch within the next few weeks, fish will move shallow again.Looks like it's a year for landing huge fish on light tackle. My guest had an accidental 45"" muskie battle yesterday with a walleye rod, 8lb test and a Mepps #4, what a fight! Dragonfishing had a guest with a 45"" on a jig and minnow last week. Muskie do not open until the third Saturday in June here, but are always catch and release, regardless.Pike have been hungry in shallow as well, feeding in similiar areas. I landed my 2nd best pike at 44.5"" last week on 8lb test, 1/8 jig/minnow. 20 minutes of praying that it did not break the line!More rain in the forecast this weekend, levels should be close to last year by mid June at this rate. Thanks for the great comments, and good fishing to everyone the comes this way in 2010!Tight Lines"
1205139,Skywagon,2010-05-29 07:29:00,1106,"Sutsgold,Check your PM's."
1205186,brwhite,2010-05-29 11:57:00,41,"Thanks for the report Colin! It's good to hear they're schooling up some. Should make the dinner hunting easy! I'll be there June 5th at lost island lodge. Last year it was a little rough as they hadn't really schooled up much at all, except a little hole we found in bear paw. I'm hoping this year with the record early ice out the 25""+ pike will be full bore when I get there. It's been a long time since I've been able to throw top water and get some decent action. Nothing beats tossing topwater on top of a pissed off pike."
