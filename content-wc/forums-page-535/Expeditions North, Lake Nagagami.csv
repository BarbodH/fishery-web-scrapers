We caught a easy 50 Walleye a day being the majority over 18"" all the way to 28"". It become a challange to catch anything under 18"". As for the camp its the best I have ever been too. Clean cabins, great boats with elect start, clean fishing cleaning station screened in from bugs and fresh running water only place with corion tops for cleaning fish. For the hospitilaity its beyond great from Dave the owner to the help they want you to have the greatest time ever. Interested check this web site expeditionsnorth.com. As for other fish theres a pike in there that I will be back after. I seen him and hes huge. We got some nice white fish also."

All the group are retired so we have slowed down a bit and don,t troll and explore as much as we used to. We heard a lot of good things about Exp. North and are looking forward to this trip. I am sure we will meet and share a libation or two. Seanik"
