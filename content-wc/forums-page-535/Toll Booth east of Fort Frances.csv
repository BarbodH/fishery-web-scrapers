1205182,fishanytime,2010-05-29 11:21:00,63,I wonder when land owners in the states will be able to charge for the use of their land for town and county roads. I have owned and paid property taxes on several miles of roads for over 30 years and watched the asparagus and grape hunters enjoy themselves as well.
1205227,2746,2010-05-29 16:12:00,3206,Went up last Friday and back through yesterday. Wait was less than 2-3 minutes. Handed them a dollar and received some liturature describing their complaint. All in all an interesting experience and gave us something to talk about for the next hour. Could have driven through w/o giving them any money I'm sure but what the heck......it was another Canandian experience.
1205297,orchard frank,2010-05-29 22:13:00,1900,"I don't travel to Ontario to fish very often anymore. Family in Florida trumps the Canada trips, but I used to really enjoy them. Road toll would irritate me, the time and hassle moreso than the money, but it would grind a little. The outdoors card is a rip also, too many folks buying conservation licenses maybe, so let's put a ""toll"" on all licenses. I think a trip to enjoy the great resources of Ontario or other provinces is a wonderful bargain, but I find these type of surcharges to be petty, much like the old GST/PST tax (sort-of) rebate, if you go through the process. Myself, I would rather just pay once, and be done, and go fishing. If I go, I know I'm a guest, it is a priviledge not a right, so I'll just pay whatever hand is held out, but I won't be tap-dancing while I'm doing it."

The grievance of the Indians could very well be valid and that should be taken care of. But, to put up a toll booth on a Federal highway and get away with it? I'm sure that every land owner along I35 between the Twin Cities and Duluth who doesn't feel they got treated fairly when the road went through would love to put up a toll booth. I don't think it would stay up very long though..... On another note, the fishing was beyond awesome. I was really surprised to find the walleye in the shallows still in the same places we normally find them this time of year. They must be as much or more affected by the calendar than by water temperature. George"

1204948,alanexpup,2010-05-28 11:57:00,278,I clicked on the link earlier in this thread and the booth is still there it sound like.
1205037,Guest,2010-05-28 16:48:00,0,"I think this toll is ridiculous and I am pretty sick of the greed exhibited by the people running this reservation. The people that live on this reservation could gain more financially by developing some businesses that would draw tourist's cash in beside a convenience store. Why not a fishing/hunting shop or a half decent restaurant? Tourist's could then develop their own traditions of stopping at these places every year when they come through instead of bypassing the community. This way, the residents of Couchiching would be able to benefit directly from the people using the roadway every day. If motorists refuse to pay the toll, Chief and Council have said that they are in favor of the application of an area of the Indian Act that states in which a person found trespassing on reserve land can face a fine of up to $50. Here's the link for that one from the CKDR website. http://ckdr.net/news/index.php Anyway, I hope this doesn't discourage folks from coming fishing north of the border. There's no toll once you get up to Sioux Lookout. Tight lines everyone, Dragon out."
1205089,v-bay gord,2010-05-28 21:01:00,3168,If you think the toll is about greed ($1 per vehicle?) then you have missed the point. It's about getting the attention of the politicians who don't give a rat's arse about this part of Ontario......native or non-native alike.

I called the OPP (Ontario police) before going down and they said it was an illegal action by the band, but were posting squad cars on each side of the booth to keep watch. There were squad cars there, with their lights on, just watching. I did pay the toll on the way down, at my wife's insistance, as she was concerned about coming back through by herself. It is no problem to go on through and not pay the toll, no gate and plenty of room. They will not stop you. If it was not for my wife making the return trip, I would not have paid it, many don't.

With about 1.5 minutes of research I found good information on the background and rationale for this action by the Couchiching First Nation. There are a variety of historical and legal issues involved, the primary one being that the Federal and Provincial governments have never compensated the Couchiching First Nation for taking Reserve land for construction of the Norden Causeway and the highway over the First Nation's land.I'll happily pay a mere $1 toll.Incidentally, with all the discussion I've read on this forum about waiting times at the Int'l Falls border crossing, I don't remember ever reading someone's post asserting that they will never go to Canada again because of that delay. And, given what we all spend on excess fishing tackle that we'll never use (and beer in quantities we don't need), the investment of emotional energy over a $1 toll is beyond my comprehension. As to ""the principle of the thing,"" it's a h___ of a lot more important for the Provincial and Federal governments to enter into serious negotiations with the First Nation to come to a fair and just resolution of this generations old dispute than it is to refuse to pony up a buck.When it comes to broken treaty promises, uncompensated usurping of land or resources, or disrespect of the culture, history, and customs of the weak by the powerful, I'll stand with the underdog.Just my $.02."

That was a one time trip but it was worth it being able to tell our kids, how we remember the trip on the dusty trail. Paying a buck and waiting in line still isn't enough to keep me from making the trip. One thing to consider, I have noticed in the past few years there are less people traveling each year, that alone will lessen the wait time at the toll booth. If the extra dollar is more than you care to spend taking that route, pick another. Take the drive along Lake Superior sometime, if you cut back to head west from Thunder Bay be sure to stop in at Kakabeka Falls the cost is well worth it! I plan on giving them a Susan B. Anthony dollar to pay my first toll. I will always have a little friendly reminder the next time I pass through to never forget when standing up for Liberty is does have a little extra cost.

Not to mention when you toss in the battle between Canada and the local tribe on the subject and what impact this could have on possible re-entry into Canada if the whole scene goes quickly ""south"" when someone refuses to pay the toll and the OPP gets involved. I could list thousands of things that are infinitely more important than refusing to pay a $1 toll if you're looking to ""stand up for your principles"". This has got to be one of the most ridiculous arguments I've ever read. Good luck - Scott"

1202277,Golden Eagle,2010-05-20 10:07:00,2642,"I'll miss it Saturday morning when I leave Red Lake, as I'll be picking up a friend in Kenora, on my way home to Tennessee. Unfortunately we'll be traveling through Illinois."
1202280,Walleye_Wrangler,2010-05-20 10:15:00,138,"Scott, I understand why you feel this is ""one of the most ridiculous arguments"". It is because you don't understand the argument. It has nothing to do with the money. It has to do with not bowing down to what some people feel is extortion. It is the PRINCIPLE of the thing. I personally don't really care one way or the other. I just felt like defending Teddi on his post and stirring things up a little."
1202293,cast_and_blast,2010-05-20 10:58:00,1098,"I do understand the argument. I also see the bigger picture which is the province of Ontario in a whizzing match with the tribe. Tribe feels that they were not properly compensated for the land that the road goes through, province of Ontario feels differently. Tribe is going to ""test the waters"" by putting up an impromtu tool booth (much like some of the tribes by Bemidji, MN recently deployed nets the day before fishing opener on lakes they are not allowed to net). The real question is: Do you feel strongly enough about your principles that you will risk something (your time, your fishing trip, a ticket, denial of the use of the road, arrest) to do something about it? Maybe you do - I know I want no part of getting between the province and the tribe and that political mess. I don't know enough about the issue to really take a position on it. So, I'll pay my $1 and continue on my way. To my point about the ridiculousness (is that even a word? let's pretend it is...) of the argument; If you feel strongly enough to act on principle in this matter then I would think that your time and energy would be much better spent acting on your principles on any one of thousands of issues right here in the good 'ol USA. That would seemingly be much more worthwhile. Good luck - Scott"
1202342,Guest,2010-05-20 13:12:00,0,"For those who really feel strongly about this and want to make a statement, pay the toll in US coins (dimes or quarters). Then they'll have to carry all that heavy change to the bank every day and still be charged the exchange rate. NOTE: pennies are exchanged at equal value, so don't waste your time with that ploy. Don't know about nickels."
1202353,tackleman,2010-05-20 13:48:00,444,"here's another problem spot for you if you are heading north of Kenora on the jones road.The natives at grassy narrows have put up a blockade , but according to the radio, it is designed to keep the treaty 3 police out of the reserve property,I don't know if this affects any of your backwood fishermen, just thought i'd make you aware of it."
1202358,Hot Runr Guy,2010-05-20 14:02:00,16062,"if it makes you feel any better, it costs me $9.60 in tolls to tow my boat 75 miles from my home in Glen Ellyn IL to the Wisconsin border @ Beloit, each way! HRG"
1202057,Enid Elizabeth,2010-05-19 16:34:00,59,This toll booth seems set to go starting noon on Friday May 21. They will charge $1 per passenger and try not to hold up traffic for long. Should be no biggie.
1202090,teddi,2010-05-19 18:18:00,349,"don,t pay. when you get stopped ask for an OPP officer and ask if it is legal. i think you will find it,s not so you should not have to pay."
1202148,Obabikon,2010-05-19 20:45:00,2370,"""Legal"" depends on your definition. The Natives have ""treaty rights""... which give them the privilage of doing just about anything they want to do on ""their"" land. That said... an OPP officer has very little pull when it comes to those issues."
1202165,Guest,2010-05-19 21:35:00,0,It is a Queens hwy and I don't believe they own it. Don't pay and continue on threw. What are they going to do if you don't?
1202167,Obabikon,2010-05-19 21:48:00,2370,Actually... I believe the government had to pay to have it put through in the first place. Good luck with that. Go on threw and risk getting stopped and hassled by a reserve officer over $1. Doesn't make sense to me... most of you are fine with paying $6 or whatever it is to cross the bridge at I-Falls. I'm not saying I agree with it... I'm just saying that anyone who tries to blow right through... or gives them a hard time is risking ruining their trip over a one dollar toll.
1202172,Guest,2010-05-19 22:35:00,0,"I understand that $1 isn't much, but if it is not legal it does not make it right. Once off the reserve, a treaty 3 officer has no jurisdiction to issue a ticket if you request an OPP officer he must wait for one to come and issue the ticket for him."
1202194,Sutsgold,2010-05-20 05:15:00,219,Is this toll between the border and 502?
1202198,teddi,2010-05-20 05:27:00,349,the toll is on the east side of fort frances after you leave town. also backs up traffic making for another wait in 80 degree weather. people just want to go fishing not put up with this bs.
1202217,v-bay gord,2010-05-20 06:52:00,3168,I would rather pay the first nation toll than the one they charge at the bridge. It is not a big deal.....there is no point in making it a bigger issue than it is.
1202228,Glenman12,2010-05-20 07:27:00,762,agreed..with what everyone pays for their trips up north $1 is a spit in the bucket..
