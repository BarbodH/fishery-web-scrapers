1205955,2746,2010-06-01 14:02:00,3206,They will have you pull over and come into the office to pay. I've never had them ask for a receipt but bringing it sure wouldn't hurt anything. It does slow the crossing a bit and you can wait in line inside if they are busy.
1206169,Glenman12,2010-06-02 06:04:00,762,We've never been asked for a receipt but they do ask how much you paid for the beer/liquor..its from what you paid that they base the duty fee..
1206510,geo1111,2010-06-03 05:54:00,8,When we went up on the 23rd through Fort Francis they asked for a receipt. We figured out that it was about half price getting the beer in the States over buying it up there and that'll be our norm from now on. George
1207364,Mojo-NC,2010-06-05 20:02:00,1931,"We just returned from a trip to Canada through International Falls, MN/Fort Frances, ON. A case of Canadian at the duty free store was priced at $18 per case, and they gave a $10 discount if you bought 5 cases (not a problem with my group). The duty was approximately $9 per case. It's simple, - you declare it, they have you pull over and park, you go in and pay your duty, and go merrily on your way. Once you're there in Canada, I think Molson Canadian was $43 a case and Blue was on sale for only $29. Tight lines!"
1202832,tlee,2010-05-22 09:34:00,65,"I go up there all the time and I just declare that I have 2 cases (24 packs). The duty for the extra case is only $5.00. I have yet to pay that, they just say thank you for being honest and go on through."
1203043,Glenman12,2010-05-23 07:03:00,762,"I thought my last time through was based on price. We declared a 1L bottle as our free one and the beer as our need to pay duty on. While at the checkout, the agent noticed we had declared the bottle (worth way more) and joked that he could have taken us for over $20 had we done it the other way."" yep, we found that out the hard way one year..out of the 4 guys in our car we declared our beer and not the hard liquor..since everyone had an extra case of beer the total we had to pay was $105 in duty..lesson learned the hard way.."
1203128,craigh,2010-05-23 12:21:00,6,"I hear lots of differences going through, but 90% of the time it goes smoothly. I have even had a few quick conversations on how the fishing is/was and maybe even one joke cracked over the years. Imagine the fishing info you could glean off of the people going through if you were an agent? (Where?, How?, What?, When?, etc?)For my border crossings, I try to show up respectful, passport in hand, receipts for duty items in hand, and hope that I don't get someone with a chip on their shoulder. The only agents that seem to give me extra attention are the ones that notice I have my PAL license for bringing firearms into Canada and assume that I must be packing since I am a ""Yank"". Hint for the agents - I think you need to look into the ones not showing up with every form under the sun already filled out and checkbook in hand.Either way, the fishing is worth a little bit of hassle and the remote places and people are nice. It is their country - go into it with that viewpoint and you won't be letdown. If you show up thinking we own them, you will somehow be shown otherwise."
1203719,deputy dog,2010-05-25 06:19:00,305,so do you pay at the booth or do you have to pull over and go in to pay?
1203732,Blue Lk,2010-05-25 07:02:00,269,You declare your stuff to the agent in the booth & he will direct you inside to pay.
1204148,WallerChief,2010-05-26 10:38:00,83,"Can you explain this in a little more detail? Sounds like a great way to go and I'd like to try it. Do you buy it in I-Falls? How do you ""pick it up"" on the other side?"
1204171,cast_and_blast,2010-05-26 11:44:00,1098,"There is a duty free shop right before you cross the tracks to go across the bridge. You go in, order your beer and/or liquor off of a ""menu"" and pay for it. You're given a receipt. You then proceed to the bridge and just before crossing you pull over to a smallish ""shack"" that has your order ready. The shack is situated such that you cannot possibly turn around and return to the US - you're committed to crossing the bridge. Load up your purchase and cross the bridge. When you get to customs on the other side you declare what you have in terms of liquor and about 90% of the time they will ask you to pull over in the covered parking area and come in to pay your duty. You do so with receipt in hand, pay your tab and continue on your way. Easy. Scott"
1204193,WallerChief,2010-05-26 12:30:00,83,Got it! Thank you!!!
1204246,cast_and_blast,2010-05-26 14:54:00,1098,"No problem. Have a cold one for me too! I'll be there in 9 days, but who's counting... Scott"

At the Duty Free in Baudette, you can get 5 cases of Canadian beer (24 cans) for $60. Money is at par. You then pay $62 duty. Works out to $24.40/case. Still cheaper than Canada."

1201886,Aaron-IN,2010-05-19 08:39:00,500,Depends on what you tell them you paid for the extra case. I don't bother and buy all my beer up there. On average we pay around $38/case Canadian.
1201892,Obabikon,2010-05-19 08:50:00,2370,http://www.serviceontap.ca/retailpartners.asp You end up paying about $30 a case. If you can get a case for $15 or so on the U.S. side... it'd be worth it. Much more than that it probably isn't. You can bank on paying about $10 duty per case over your 1.
1201911,cast_and_blast,2010-05-19 09:23:00,1098,"We buy ours prior to crossing and pick it up on the other side of the bridge (I-Falls to Fort Frances). Case of Molson is ~ $15 and we pay ~$10 per case duty. At the Beer Store in Fort Frances is $41.50 (Canadian) plus all of their taxes - so you're pushing $50 per case. Bottom line - you can get the same Canadian beer for about 1/2 the price. Fly-in is all about weight. Extra beer is extra weight, so I'm not sure if there would be an additional charge if you show up with your own beer - you'd have to ask the outfitter. When we did fly-in's they would fly what they could on Day 1 (usually all of it on the size planes we had) along with all of us and our stuff. If we had extra stuff (mid-week bait, etc.) they would send it in with a 2nd flight at no charge (2nd flight was a safety check by the resort owner in his cessna - he would often bring in propane or boat gas too). Good luck! Scott"
1201957,Guest,2010-05-19 11:26:00,0,Is there any difference on the duty paid if we paid 10.00 per case instead of 15.00? Always wondered if it was a flat rate or according to what you paid.
1202013,cast_and_blast,2010-05-19 13:55:00,1098,It's based on the amount you paid. Scott
1202370,phishfearme,2010-05-20 14:30:00,1242,the last time we declared extra beer and paid duty it was $9-$10 canadian and the price we paid didn't matter. this was at pidgeon river. phish

The cases of real canadian beer range from $15 to $18 at Rydens at Pigeon River. You will pay around $10 duty per case after the first case. But call ahead to get the store hours. Most of my crossings happen when those stores are closed.Wherever you buy it, make sure to bring your receipts (get a separate one for your additional cases past your first one). I don't think the resort is gouging you at $50 delivered and cold when you arrive.- Craig"
1202798,a3dad,2010-05-22 07:21:00,115,"Do you have to pay in canadian dollars or do they take credit cards, personal checks?"
1202828,deputy dog,2010-05-22 09:20:00,305,"so i buy my beer at home, save the receipt, when at the border booth tell the officer i am declaring 3 cases show him my receipt and pay the duty to him or will i have to pull over to the office/check station and pay there? never did this before and would like to know how it's goin to go before getting there. thanks......."
