1208034,DonC,2010-06-08 06:34:00,93,"Just returned from Northwest Angle MN for a 3 day fishing trip. Usually I fish Minaki at Birch Island Resort and will in early July. We had a good trip. Stayed with a neighbor of my in-laws in FL who is a MN resident and has a cabin on Oak Island. Fished Canadian waters only. The water color in the Northwest Angle area was tinged on the muddy side. It cleared heading up north through the French Portage. I am a smallmouth fisherman primarily. Our host is a walleye and sometimes musky fisherman. The first night we fished deep walleye without success. The next day we went smallmouth fishing. All of us, especially the host, started catching walleye 2-9 feet deep everywhere that we fished smallmouth. The first day for smallmouth was poor in the mud stained waters. He was amazed that the walleye were shallow. All he and others in the boat fishing walleye was to pull a jig and natural chartreuse 3 inch Berkley Power Grub with a little action on the bottom. This pattern continued all 3 days. The last 2 days we got in to the smallmouth, and continued catching walleye also all day long on tubes, spinnerbaits or grubs. The smallmouth action was in clearer water. I caught 2 muskie on tubes, the largest was 42 inches. The pike were active at times, though I usually never target them. We had a pike contest because my son-in-law and the other fellow with us had never caught pike. We caught over 40 pike and 4 muskies over the 2 days we fished off and on for the contest. For those fishing right now in the Lake of the Woods and Minaki area and are having trouble with deep water walleye, you can try and go to smallmouth areas and work depths 4-9 feet of water with power grubs for walleye. Who knows how long this pattern will persist. The walleye size was OK with most in the 14-22 inch size range. We even caught many walleye in 2 feet of water the last days casting up to shore with soft plastics. Good luck to all, Don"
