1205942,ii4me,2010-06-01 13:44:00,20,We are heading to Lac Seul on Saturday. Does anyone know if there are any road surprises along the way? Thanks
1205952,2746,2010-06-01 13:57:00,3206,Just got back Saturday. Nothing to worry about except two one lane bridge jobs between Dryden and Vermillon bay and one more south of Ear Falls. They are short and only a few minutes delay. 501 was in reasonably good shape.

If you are heading back to the states on Saturday, better have your fish catch in order. Last Saturday there was a traffic stop on 11 just before you get on to 502. Everyone that had a boat trailer behind them were pulled over for inspection. We came through last Friday and did not experience the traffice stop. We always pay close attention to our limit and packaging so I commend our friend from the north for keeping everyone honest so we can enjoy their offerings for many years to come."
