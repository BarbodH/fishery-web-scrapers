1207253,wmd,2010-06-05 10:47:00,388,I vertical jig in fairly deep water and also in current and much prefer to use monofilament line over braids. Line twist is always a problem is there ia style of jig that will reduce line twist?
1207274,polaris-pete,2010-06-05 12:26:00,343,I started using tiny SPRO power swivels with a short floro leader and it has helped line twist greatly.
1207300,Bill Krejca,2010-06-05 14:22:00,6107,"A dependent factor is what is attached to the hook, i.e., ""twister"" tail, minnow, bucktail, tube, etc. It seems that most stuff we attach to the hook cause some amount of line twist. Amount of action imparted to the bait is also a factor - more aggressive sweeps will result in more line twist than just a finesse vibration action. ""Twister"" tails really do, so also tubes, during the spiral drop. A jig head that has the eye in the center of gravity of the head helps, one that hangs hook bend down may spin more. I usually, actually always, use a ball bearing swivel several feet above the bait, this being found to be most beneficial in keeping line twist to a minimum. Bill Krejca"
