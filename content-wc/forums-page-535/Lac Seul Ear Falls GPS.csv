1192517,winston123,2010-04-23 13:42:00,13,I am in the market for a new depth finder. I also have a hand help GPS that I purchased in 1999. Think its time to upgrade!! Can someone provide a recommendation on what would work well on Lac Seul? I am not an expert on electronics so any help would be appreciated.Thanks

I assume you'll be driving up through Vermillion??? If so, stop at the gas station/market on the corner and buy the NW section of Lac Seul. The map the gas station has for sale is the best map I've seen for Lac Seul."

1192887,worthsr,2010-04-24 19:24:00,52,"Not a bad idea to replace your old handheld before it craps out. Mine died last year 15 minutes into our trip, yada yada yada; I bought my first lower unit. I went with the Garmin 76CSX at walmart dot com for under $300. I also added the map chip from Garmin for another $100. It's awesome how far these things have come in the last decade. The color screen is nice, it floats and adding a map chip makes a world of difference. With the map chip rocks and reefs are marked and you also have access to depths etc. I haven't had a chance to use it out on the lake yet, but I did a lot of research and feel like I made a good choice. There is an electronics message board on this site that I found helpful. Good Luck, Scott."

I also bought the Navionics card for Lac Seul. I made a suction cup mount for the transducer. It worked out great. I had a high quality depth finder with GPS and mapping. With the Lowrance HDS units they have a built in GPS puck so it's even easier to make it portable. I think most of the camp boats have electric start so just connect to that for power and you don't have to worry about a battery."
1205561,rnnonmt,2010-05-31 08:12:00,992,A couple years ago I bought a Garmin Colorado 300 and the downloadable Lac Seul map from Trakmaps. The garmin works well and the map was easy to install and unlock. Garmin: $250.00 Lac Seul Map: $79.00. 4 2700Mah AA Nimh rechargeable batteries: $30.00Being able to find your way back: PRICELESSOne down side to Garmin Colorado is that it eats 2 standard AA batteries in a matter of a couple hrs. Tried the ultra cell and lithium type and it lasts about 4-8 hrs but I just couldnt stand chucking that many batteries in the garbage. The best I have found are 2700Mah AA NiMH type batteries. This was the only type of battery that I could get close to the 15 hr run time that Garmin states on the specs page for the Colorado. Happy fishing!
1207302,archer66,2010-06-05 14:29:00,21,"I have a Garmin Map76CSX and purchased a map of the Northwest section of Lac Suel from Trackmaps. I also took with me a paper version of the NW section of the lake...the same one mentioned above that can be found at area shops. Here is a link to Trackmaps:http://www.trakmaps.com/liste_produits.phpI found my gps to be a LOT of help especially after the first day. Since you don't know the lake and you don't know what the lake level is like in relation to shoals, you shouldn't rely too heavily on the depths shown on any map. My recommendation would be to use the map AND the GPS but on that first day out pay attention to your depth finder and go slow. Once you've made a route for yourself thru Bay of Islands toward South Bay and or toward McKenzie or wherever you plan to fish you'll be able to use your GPS to navigate. You'll get a feel for how accurate the depths on the gps and map are after paying attention and using your depth finder and then you will be more confident."
1207674,Lonefisherman,2010-06-06 22:56:00,13,"You might want to look into a locator with GPS that can take both Lakemaster or Navionics chips. Navionics Hotmaps Premium Canada chiphas Lac Suel on it and can come in very handy to navigate your way around. It does have depth chart on it but comes from their Ministry of Natural Resource map. It does show a lot of hazards that exist but does not show everything. Good luck in finding what you are looking for. P.S. You are in for a real treat fishing Lac Suel, cause you are going to be spoiled fishing there."
1207790,2746,2010-06-07 10:48:00,3206,I'm not into electonics either but have found the Lowarnce H20 (colcr if you want to spend the $) and navionics map to be a great help on Lac Seul. I only use my GPS a couple times a year when we go up north so didn't want to invest a bundle. You can find the H20 on e-bay for for well under @200 in black and white and can have color for another $100. The Canada map will give you most of the lakes in Ontario.
1207894,Guest,2010-06-07 18:10:00,0,"I also have the Garmin Map76CSX with TrakMaps Marine vesion for NorthWest Ontario (44 lakes). It works quite well on Lac Seul and Big V where I fish, although not all hazards are marked. Two double A batteries will last several full days if it is not too cold. I have all the lakes in the TrakMaps program on my computer and download only the mapsets of the lakes I require for a trip with my previous waypoints and tracks. I then add more as I find new ""hotspots"" and save back to the computer after the trip where I can edit waypopint names etc. Great system for my needs."
