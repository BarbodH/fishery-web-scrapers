1207518,keek,2010-06-06 11:18:00,1003,I saw McQ's report on the Hot and Tot action in the wildfire thread and I wanted to ask a question to McQ or anyone with info- Do you normally troll these in Canada this time of year? Cast them? Both? I've had some luck with them in the past but I'm headed to Quebec this week and I'm curious. Also: Mono or Superline?(I've had luck with 14lb fireline personally but how about you?)
1207550,Mondo_)H,2010-06-06 14:31:00,91,Steve are you going to DeCelles? (Northern Outfitters?)
1207554,keek,2010-06-06 14:44:00,1003,"Hey Mondo,Yes we'll be at Northern Outfitters from June 11-18. I've got a 16' Starcraft blue and cream colored with a 40 merc. Are you at the other side of the Res?"
1207598,McQ,2010-06-06 18:14:00,615,"Keek we use the larger Hot n Tots for 20' depths and #7 Shad Raps for 8 - 10 Hot n Tots in Crawfish, Blue/Chrome, Black/Gold are the most popular colors Shad Raps in walleye pattern are #1 perch #2 I use 20/8 fireline myself. I've found the chartreuse patterns to be effective for pike more so than walleye."
