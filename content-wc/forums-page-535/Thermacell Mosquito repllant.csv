1195742,northsky99,2010-05-02 06:58:00,41,Has anybody used the thermacell Mosquito repellant? does this product really work on Mosquito and black flies?
1195744,Esoxchaser,2010-05-02 07:00:00,1576,On a calm day it works wonders. A little breeze and you want to set it up just upwind from you. A stiffer breeze and the bugs aren't flying anyhow.
1195756,Outfitter17,2010-05-02 07:48:00,127,"Esoxchaser is dead on, it works great on calm day and if there is a light breeze you need to have it upwind about 15' from you and if it is windy the bugs won't be around you anyways.We have all our bears hunters use them and they are great."
1195761,youngcanadianguide,2010-05-02 08:09:00,60,"Hey Northsky99,If you are price checking Cabelas has them on sale for $19.99 through May 9th."
1196454,Steve of Madison,2010-05-03 22:26:00,230,They work!!!
1196473,81Saluki,2010-05-04 05:26:00,97,Has anyone compared the ThermaCell to OFF's Clip-On product? The OFF product is cheaper. I went to buy one of the OFF units last week but my grocery store didn't have them in stock. I think I'll wait to buy something until I hear from people who have used either/both.

I agree with prior posting, if there is a slight wind set it about 5-10 feet away. Just make sure to wash your hands before handling any fishing gear. Randy"
1206275,keek,2010-06-02 11:04:00,1003,Do you guys have any problems crossing the boarder with these?
1206342,IowaDave,2010-06-02 14:22:00,69,"I've taken mine up for 2 years now & haven't had any problems, but I've never been asked about it either. Not sure why there would be an issue even if they did ask. And BTW, they work great!"
1206851,djarz929,2010-06-04 06:06:00,40,"Been using it for 2 years now and it does work. All the previous posts are dead on about the wind. I was sceptical at first, thinking I would just be pissing away $20, but i wouldn't go on a trip without mine now."
