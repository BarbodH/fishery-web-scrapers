They used to allow a rod carrier and a tackle box to be counted as a single checked bag. Now it looks like each are separate and the rod carriers can be a maximum of 80 inches, which means no 7 foot rods. Are they really measuring?"
1204152,wolverine fan,2010-05-26 10:48:00,71,"i would suggest looking up their website, i just booked my res. for this year and need to do so also. I do know that the FIRST bag on delta/northwest is $23 online pay or $25 at the airport, second bags/rods are more. i also know that last year i paid $160 extra dollars for my son and i at the counter to be allowed to go onboard because of two extra bags and a 6'6"" rod carrier. I thought they said 60 inches max and i was over but they may have changed it so thats why i say check the regs. It kinda sucks really, makes you feel like theyre not in the customer service bittness anymore! Too bad southwest doesnt fly north!!Good luck"

Believe Delta calls rods safely secured in a travel case "" a special item "" and up to 80"" is a simple extra bag charge. My tube is 76"". As intense as they seem I'm pretty sure an 84"" case would of freeked em out. Why don't you buy good quality 2 or 3 piece rods with the hard tubes and stick em in a suitcase? Maybe $130.00 ea but at $35.00 ea way your half way there."
1207369,Mojo-NC,2010-06-05 20:30:00,1931,"Just returned from Canada - after calling Delta prior to leaving, we decided to take a chance and wrap 3 rod carriers together using Saran Wrap and duct tape and claim them as only 1 checked bag. It worked. However, I should mention that we did leave our 7' rods at home and bring only 6'6"" rods to keep the total length under 80"" according to the airline regulations. We also checked the bags online and saved $5 per bag, so 5 of us carried 19 rods for $25 total."
