532403,cincymike,2003-06-16 19:42:00,8,does anyone have any information/comments on the lowrance X-87 vs the Eagle 320 fishfinders. was looking at portable models but the equipment would be the same.
532430,xcleox,2003-06-17 11:08:00,10,"Isn't it the exact same model (Fishmark 320/Lowrance x87)? Both are made by the same company. Same box, specs, ect..."
532464,Guest,2003-06-17 18:14:00,0,I believe the X-87 has a flasher mode and the 320 does not.
