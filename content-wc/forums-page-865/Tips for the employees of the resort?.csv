We take a fly-in trip to Ontario and have been tipping every year, however, we would like to know if our tipping is sufficient. We stay in small camp on the American plan. We tip the pilot $20.00, the cook $100.00, and the dock hand(who filets our fish and tells us some hotspots) $120.00. There are four of us in the group and we stay for six days. We would really like to hear from some of you that are employed in this kind of work, but feedback is welcome and encouraged from anyone. I don't know if it makes a difference but the cook is the owner's daughter and the dock hands drinks our beer all week. No biggie. Are these tips average, high, low? Somebody please chime in and let us know. We are going to back to see these same people in a month."

They fuel the boats every day, load and unload the plane and bend over backwords to assist us if something isn't right. We also try to bring them a gift every year. Since we have known them for years we invite them over for supper about every night. Pooch"

Mind you the lodge that I worked at split all the tips evenly between ALL employees. Which sometimes helped and sometime I got the shorter end. But a group of your size a 175-225 tip would be perfect for the lodge I worked at. Of course there are a few factors that you might want to consider: What is the price of the lodge that you are staying at? How much ""catering"" do the staff do for you? It really comes down to how much you want to give and what you think they deserve. I know that some of the staff at the lodge wheren't happy unless they got a king's ransom for a tip and somebody like myself apprciated anything the guests where willing to give. I just enjoyed making people have a good time while visting my country. Oh, and another thing the staff at the lodge where I was at wasn't alowed to touch alcohol with a ten foot pole. Fish ON!!"

Rarely, I've gone up to 20%, but only for exceptional service. I never discuss my tipping with the others in my party unless they ask what I'm going to do. TGG"
