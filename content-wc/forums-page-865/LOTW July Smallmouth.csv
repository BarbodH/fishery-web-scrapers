My favorite lures have been rattletraps but I have caught them on surface poppers, spinner baits, and using a fly rod. I usually fish Highrock island and the south end of the island directly west of Highrock(this is where the Sanctuary is located), any of the islands that have rip rap will hold smallmouth in July. You will catch a ton of 1-2 lb fish and some that are a little larger. With the water levels being low you will have to be careful because of the large amount of reefs and rocks in Whitefish Bay !!!"
532494,bronzeback77,2003-06-18 09:58:00,97,"Thanks for the info, I fished that same area back at the end of May and caught a lot of fish on Jerkbaits and Grubs. I also fished on the southern tip of Timber island around the corner from the big sand beach. Actually caught about 30 largemouth one day in between Timber and the un named island to the south. I guess we should just fish the same areas we fish in May but just a litle deeper and a little faster. What do you think?"
532503,downriverbob,2003-06-18 12:51:00,880,"There are a couple of areas off Timber and Highrock that drop off into deeper water that hold some bigger fish. There are some deep bolders on the southwest corner of Highrock, southeast corner of Sanctuary Island, and one large complex of rocks off southeast side of Timber that hold bigger fish in July. I am usually up there the first two weeks of July but will not be going till first two weeks in September this year."

532529,Guest,2003-06-18 19:18:00,0,"sactuary island is the one just west of high roack island? there are 2 islands that look like they are pointing at timber island. i am looking at the map and just want to confirm where sanctuary island is , its not marked on our map. we have never fished for bass before because we are ther in june and june is a no no for bass. Do you troll for bass or just jig with a minnow or live bait or only cast with a spinner bait like they do on TV. thanks a lot for any help alan"
532531,downriverbob,2003-06-18 19:38:00,880,"We strickly cast with cranks, spinner baits, top water, and fly rods, Sanctuary is directly west of Highrock, there is an old boat house and docks on the east side in a small cove, near the center of the island. You might see a older gentleman pulling wire for lake trout in the area out front, stop by and say hi and tell him Bob Lesner said hi. He is the owner Robert Horley of the Sancutary Resort and has been guiding on LOTW for 60 years."

Gold blades and brown buck tails. The Mepps also caught many Northerns (35 - 41"") and eyes up to 10 pounds. Gold stick baits (black back) like Bomber long A also work very good. Good luck! We leave tomorrow for Rainy. Pathfinder"
