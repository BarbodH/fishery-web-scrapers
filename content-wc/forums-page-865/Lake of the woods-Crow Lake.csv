The fish have not gone to the summer humps and patterns yet. Plastics of black, white, or brown on an eighth-ounce jig were working as were minnow-colored crank baits. All the fish caught were in 2 to 11 feet of water. It is still a fantastic bite. Hope you do well."

They were throwing Shadraps into two feet of water and caught all of the fish within 5 feet of the bank. I was told that that was their best day but that they caught over a hundred a couple other times last week."
