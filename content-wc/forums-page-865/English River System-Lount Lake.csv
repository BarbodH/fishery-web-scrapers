We really didn't catch any smallmouth though, only Walleye. I've read previous posts say they catch a lot of nice ones. Should I head towards the Sep. Camp for those? Seems like there is more current up that way. We went to nine foot for Northerns last year...not a lot of numbers but did get a 42incher. Not a lot of Northerns all week...any suggestions for them? Last year, our first year, we just caught Walleye all week. Believe me, that is not a bad thing, but this year we will be going with a couple of my friends that don't fish that much and will need some variety. Thanks for the info. One more thing. Do you, or anybody else, know of a place to go Lake Trout fishing in the area. I caught my first one two years back at Big Canon and I am hooked. Thanks for your help and hope to hear from you soon.
