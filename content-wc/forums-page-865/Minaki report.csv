I think I am staying at a place called Rich's or Richard's. I guess it is not really a resort but just a guy who rents out a few cabins. I too would be interested in a more recent fishing report. Also, does anybody now where you can look at some maps of the Minaki area on the internet? I haven't found much as of yet."

The Walleyes are stacked up on Claybanks, there were 4 guys nexted to us got their limits in 2 1/2 hours, we had motor trouble so we came home, but everyone ya talk to are limiting out with nice Walleyes and the big Northerns are hitting and even a few Muskies. We are going back, so let us know how you do.[email protected]"
