They did really great, caught lots of fish, only one slow day out of 7. Lots of eyes in the 3,4,5 pound range, biggest was 8-3 and a couple of 7's. Biggest pike was 20 and a 17 with lots of 10's~. We usually stay at the Moak Lodge. Where do you stay? I have rescheduled my trip to Sept and going to Tobin. Hear and read lots of good stories about it. The friend I'm going with was there 2 years ago and brought home a 13 to hang on the wall. On a 5 day trip they had 4 over 10 in the boat. I've got to get my hands on a 10+. Good luck up there. The boarder guards must be getting tougher up there. When we went last year we had 2 teenages with us and they never said a word. This year they wanted to see a birth certificate/passport and a note from his mother. So if your going to take your kids without their mother get a note."
