532396,Guest,2003-06-16 17:15:00,0,"I have a pending misdemeanor charge of Disorderly Conduct here in the US. My hearings are scheduled after my planned trip to Lac Seul, will I have any issues getting into Canada If I have yet to be convicted? If there is an issue does anyone know how to contact the International Falls border crossing, so I can get some more information? Thanks in advance"

You are presumed innocent until proven guilty and only after your day in court would it show up on any type of record. That being said, refrain from any disorderly conduct up in Canada. It's not very neighborly and I've noticed that the police officers up there don't mess around. But, you would be best advised to follow the advice of the post before mine."
532406,Guest,2003-06-16 20:58:00,0,The OPP or provincial cops are real hardcore. No sense of humour. I have experience with them on a couple of issues.
532409,bigfish1965,2003-06-16 21:36:00,3210,Provincial cops on the highways are all by-the-book. The more local OPP are more laid back and used to the 'northern ways'. They are all ridiculously polite.

532445,Guest,2003-06-17 13:16:00,0,"Well, the automated checklist at that phone number talks only about the number of convictions. Since I have no convictions I am assuming that I am good to go. I am just going to be a good little fisherman and mind my p's and q's while in Canada, expect no trouble from me!"
