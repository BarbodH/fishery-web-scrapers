532500,IaDave,2003-06-18 11:19:00,476,Considering Anderson's for next year. For anyone who has been to their outposts which one do you prefer? Are they normally booked up for June trips right away? Is there much boat traffic or do you feel like you are at a fly-in lake? I know Lac Suel is huge but would hate to spend the money for flying in just to find 10 other boats fishing the same hot spot. Any experiences would be greatly appreciated.

They have a small cabin on the lake, the only one but the fishing is really good and I have a boat stashed in there. Really turns heads when people are there as they think they own the lake because they paid for a fly in. Granted, only a few of us that know go in there as its a really rough trail to get there. Fly in fishing, or drive in my way is awesome!"

You will see many houseboats (we parked ours within a mile of the outpost)and also a lot of boat traffic from Sioux will make a day run to this area. Ojibwa Outfitters also has a camp about 3 or 4 miles away. Yes you will see other boats. But you usually don't have a problem with people being in ""your"" spot. It does happen though."

This lake is one of the best around for walleye and pike and you have a camp cook, custodian etc. and the lake during the summer is for the lodge only (legally) and no boat traffic at all. Now, there are ways to access this lake but by law, lynx lake lodge has exclusive rights during the summer and no acess is allowed from any logging road but there is only 1 way to get around the law."
532551,IaDave,2003-06-19 07:47:00,476,Hoping to hear from folks who have stayed with Anderson's. I know they run a top notch operation and the price is right. We are also considering Slate Falls Outposts but they are a little more expensive. Anybody used both of these outfitters.
532553,Guest,2003-06-19 08:56:00,0,"Hey IaDave....after I meet you on Abrams this spring, I went into Anderson's - Tuk. Bay outpost the next week. It is just north of Bear Narrows. They also have one about 4 miles east called Kekabeca Narrows (not sure on the spelling). Both are excellent locations. We have been going to one or the other for the past 8 or so years. If you get one of those, (book early) be sure and let me know and I'll show you some excellent places to fish. There are alot of house boats that come up there. The traffic is twice or three times as much as when we first started. It certainly is not the remote area of Lac Seul, but hasn't been a problem. eyesnatcher"
