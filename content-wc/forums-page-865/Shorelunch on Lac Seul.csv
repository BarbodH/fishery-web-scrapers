532505,Guest,2003-06-18 13:26:00,0,"Thanks for the info. Although it does tell you what you CANNOT keep, how many under the slot can you keep? Is that the 4 total, or 3 smaller and the 1 big one? Either way, its 4 total no matter the combo (with none in the slot and only one max above the slot)??

532524,retire55,2003-06-18 18:00:00,1029,"Wooglin: You raised a good question. The regulations don't provide the answer. I read your question too late to telephone the Ontario MNR for a response. They have a toll free telphone number good for all North America (1-800-667-1940). My interpretation of the regulations is that the size limit applies to your daily catch and retain limit only. Of the 4 walleye you can catch and retain in one day, all 4 walleye could all be under the slot or 3 under and 1 over. If you have walleye in possession (e.g. back at camp), then your daily catch and retain limit is reduced by the number in possession. If you had 2 walleyes in possession and they were the 2 walleye over 20.8 inches you had caught and retained on different days, then you would still be eligible to catch and retain 2 more walleye - one of which could be over 20.8 inches (in my opinion). I will telephone MNR tomorrow to confirm."
532541,ackermannsacre,2003-06-18 22:04:00,196,If you are stopped at a check station leaving Lac Suel with 3 walleye over 20.8 it could get very expensive. Bill
532542,ackermannsacre,2003-06-18 22:10:00,196,"You guys are just making this just too hard, does nobody read the regulations anymore? ""Possession limits are the same as one day's catch limit except where otherwise specified."" If your one day's catch limit states that you can only have one walleye over 20.8, then your possession limit is only one walleye over 20.8"
532552,retire55,2003-06-19 08:49:00,1029,"Bill: Thanks for your input on this subject. MNR called me back and confirmed your interpretation - size limits apply equally to ""catch and retain"" and ""possession limits"". Consequently, for Lake Seul, one can not have more than 1 walleye over 20.8 inches in possession."
532313,Guest,2003-06-13 19:26:00,0,"If you have two walleye in your freezer in Iowa or something like that, don't be overly concerned. That said, if you live on Lac Seul you should be concerned. The MNR can walk in and check any freezer you have at their discretion. They have ""just cause."" In the north, the MNR have far more power than the OPP in such regards. If you are out fishing for the day, the MNR will often check the fish count in the freezer back at camp before heading out on the water to question you. When they meet you on the water, they will then try to get you to say the wrong thing. It happens all the time. When I am guiding guests and I spot the MNR, I tell my guests to let me do all the talking. Even if the CO is asking the guest specifically and makes a point of telling me not to answer for he/she, I will still always answer. He gets pissed sometimes, but he can't do anything about it. If I am guiding, I do not expect the guests to know the entire gamut of regulations. The MNR feels they should know them all, but that is absolute GARBAGE!! People are paying to enjoy themselves and not have to worry about such technicalities, that is my job. The province (not the ""providence""-see the posting above) is segmented into several fish management areas. Lac Seul is very unique and thus has its own rules. They are greater in magnitude and specificity than most. If you are not taking a guide and do not know the rules, learn them, and learn them well because you will get nailed with some small technicality."

532317,Guest,2003-06-13 21:16:00,0,If I remember correctly it states in the guide that shorelunch counts towards your daily catch limit so that means you can kill 4 on Lac Seul per day period. What about catch and release? have a shore lunch or 2 per week and let the rest go.
532346,Guest,2003-06-15 05:16:00,0,"Good God, you make it sound like you must have a PHD to understand fishing limits, regulations on Lac seul. It's the same across NW Ontario, there is however a slot limit on lac seul 18-21 inches ( walleye) must be leleased. Also you may NOT posess a live fish. You decided when you catch it if your going to keep or release. Even a woman can figure this on out. Some guide out ther is trying to get you to hire him and it's really not the complicated. Good luck, enjoy your stay in Canada whatever lake your on."
532371,Guest,2003-06-16 07:18:00,0,"The last few times to Canada I bought the Conservation License. This discussion may lead me to buy the regular 7 day license, eat and catch no more than the 4 fish per day (assuming none in the refrigerator or freezer. I think the eaten fish as possession ends with new sunrise, so I start the count over the next day. Also makes me think of eating other species for shore lunch, if I have a big fish hunger-perch, northern, smallmouth. I enjoy fresh fish but I don't have to eat fish to have a good fishing trip. There are always pork chops and chicken and beer. (Last year I would eat steak and potatoes instead:)"
532374,retire55,2003-06-16 08:46:00,1029,"Gary_IA: Just a clarification comment regarding your statement ""I think the eaten fish as possession ends with new sunrise, so I start the count over the next day."" Where your daily ""catch and retain"" limit is 4 walleye, any walleye caught and retained and then subsequently eaten (e.g. shore lunch) still counts towards your daily catch and retain limit. Once you have caught and retained 4 walleyes on any particular day, you can not legally ""catch and retain"" any more walleye that day - even if you eat one. Granted, it would be almost impossible for an enforcement officer to determine whether you caught and retained 5 walleyes and had one for shore lunch - but they have been known to ""lie in wait in the weeds"". Much more importantly, catch and retain limits are resource management vehicles that should be respected by all responsible fishermen. There is no ""daily"" per se ""possession"" limit. Where your walleye ""possession"" limit is 4, then 4 is the total number of walleye you are allowed to have at any time in your possession (whether they be on your stringer, in your live well, on ice back at camp, in transit, etc.) regardless when you caught and retained them. And even though the daily ""catch and retain"" limit is 4, if you already have 2 walleyes in possession, then you can legally only catch and retain 2 more walleye - else you would exceed your possession limit."
532376,Guest,2003-06-16 09:11:00,0,"I don't disagree with you. When I speak of starting the count over the next sunrise, I count any Walleyes I have in the refrigerator and freezer. I just don't count the fish I ate yesterday. If I had 3 fish on hand, I could only catch one more fish to eat or add to the ones in camp. As I said, look at other species to eat (within the legal limits) such as northern, perch, smallmouth, lake trout, crappies, whitefish. I don't think there are crappies in Lac Seul-but the point is to see how you can eat fish and still comply with the regulations. Fishing is recreation for us and we shouldn't jeopardize it over activities we have control over."
532481,Guest,2003-06-18 07:32:00,0,"So I read all of these postings, and now I understand that Lac Seul has a slot of 18-21 inches, all walleye in that range must be released. Fine with me. Next point: YOu can only have 4 fish in your posession at a time, whether that be 3 in the fridge, 1 in the boat....or all 4 in the boat...etc. So, do you suggest catching the ones you want to take home with you, on the last day, hence you can catch and eat 4 per day until then? Are their limits on Northern, similar to walley? Just trying to not get fined, thanks for your time. >I don't disagree with you.

532490,Trailerguy,2003-06-18 08:44:00,1407,"[font face=""Arial"" color=green size=3][b] Yes, you could catch and eat 4 per day, but you'd be awful sick of fish at the end of the week. Most people would save back a few nice ones to take home as the week progressed. Then you aren't pressured on the last day to fill out. And I beleive the pike limit is similar to walleye in most management units, a quick check of regulations wouldn't hurt."

532252,stumcfar,2003-06-12 14:16:00,451,"I realize that any walleye you eat for shorelunch goes towards your daily limit. Are you supposed to put carcasses in a garbage bag and keep them with you, or how do you prove how much you ate and how much you can still have in your cooler. I have been told they are quite particular on this and would like to make sure we do things legally."

532263,Guest,2003-06-12 16:31:00,0,Actually the burdon of proof lies with the fisherman. If someone tells them that they seen you eating 4 walleye and observed you keeping 4 more your going to be charged and loose your gear until you go to court. This scenario I have heard about many times as I live on Lac Seul.
532291,bubbalou,2003-06-13 08:20:00,29,I am taking a guide for a day this year and I sure hope he knows the rules. I would sure hate to get caught and still pay the guide!!! LOL. I was always told that if you keep a fish and eat it for shorelunch that fish if part of your limit. I am sure many people eat the fish and then head out after lunch and fill there limit to head home with. That's why I have no problem with the MNR pulling up to my boat and checking the catch. It's their job!!!
532292,red_river_fisher,2003-06-13 08:32:00,24,Is this true for all Ontario lakes or just this one. I was under the impression that if you ate it you no longer had it in your possesion and there for was aloud more for later. Born to Fish But Forced To Work

532303,retire55,2003-06-13 11:53:00,1029,"red_river_fisher: Firstly, the Ontario Fishing Regulations require a wholescale rewrite employing the KISS (Keep it simple stupid) principle. Apparently such streamlining is in the works (maybe by 2006). Catch and retain limits and possession limits are not easily understood. On Lake Seul, the ""possession limit"" for walleye is identical to the ""catch and retain limit"" - 4 walleye. Consequently, a fisherman with a sports fishing licence can catch and retain 4 walleye in any one day period providing that he does not have any walleye in possession (whether those walleye be back at camp or in his freezer at home). If said fisherman has any walleye in his possession, then even though his daily catch and retain limit is 4, he can only catch and retain 4 minus the number of walleye he has in possession. So if the guy has 2 walleye back at camp on ice, he can legally only catch and retain 2 more walleye. Lets assume said fisherman (with 2 walleye back at camp) catches two walleye before lunch. Consequently he has reached his possession limit (4) and he can not catch and retain any more walleye. However, if he opts to eat a walleye for shore lunch, he will reduce the number of walleye in his possession and he will become eligible to catch and retain another walleye. Remember that fish consumed as part of a shore lunch remain part of your daily catch and retain limit."
