Got to the point where we just cut the heads off the 29"" walleyes to get that cheek meat. I have to admit, we had to keep more than our four per day to get enough meat to eat. Has anyone ever tried this delicacy before?"

The sight of the chew spit running down he chin was quite funny. Hey Dick, did you break any Loomis rods again this year? Generally good for falling on one"
