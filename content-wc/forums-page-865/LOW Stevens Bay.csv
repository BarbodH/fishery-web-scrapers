I have access to Stevens Bay on LOW and was wondering if any of you LOW experts could point me to some walleye and crappie spots. I been crappie fishing around Hay Island in the winter, and I've fished Miles Bay and Morson area several times in the early summer, but I have never been into Steven's. Any help would be appreciated. TGG"

I don't have a map in front of me, but there are several bays on the south side of Stevens as you get close to Sabaskong that are good for walleyes that time of year. In the past, we found walleyes in 6-12 feet of water along weed edges that were just starting to top out. Pretty easy pattern. Just look for the weedy bays that are at the right depth and you'll find walleyes. As you move into Sabaskong, you'll have even better luck. Have tried some other spots in Stevens but never had much luck. Hope this helps."
532561,Guest,2003-06-19 13:08:00,0,Great Guide - don't you also fish Rainy? My group will be going tomorrow to Rainy. Got a report? Will be fishing out of The Fisheries resort on Red Gut. Pathfinder

Drag some #9 Shad Raps or Bombers over 10 feet of water. Red Pine is still good as are the reefs on either side of Airplane Island. By the end of June Crooked and Spawn have usually slowed down. Peary Straights is active, but full of dinks. Seine River Narrows should still be good. Get the map and try to find some of the main lake reefs in Seine. The fish should be on them in 25 to 50 feet and you can pluck them off with jigs and minnows. If I were going tomorrow I'd go first to the reefs off of Airplane Island then move to Red Pine Narrows. After that I move to the bays off of Porters, by then you will know where the W's are. The next day I'd go to Seine and find the reefs. This has been an interesting year thus far. We went Kabatogama on the MN opener and caught fish of all sizes in 3 to 10 feet and also in 35 to 40 feet. Went to Rainy and only caught fish in 20 to 40 feet for the first 2 days then 5 to 15 feet the last 2 days. The W's moved into the bays overnight. Went to Lac Suel and never fished deeper that 10 feet and caught fish all week. Then went back to Kabetogama and we fished deep thinking that the fish had gone to their summer haunts and could only catch saugars. The walleyes were in 2 to 10 feet on the main channel shorelines.Then last weekend we went to Basswood in the BWCA and every fish we caught on the first day was in 35 feet. On day two they just disappeared. On day three we decided to go for some smallmouth and started catching walleys in the mid-afternoon on the rocky shoreline in two feet of water using cranks. No telling where the walleyes on Rainy will be. I'd like to know what you find. I won't be able to go to Rainy until early August. Seems the wife has planned a week long vacation to the deserts of Santa Fe in July. I haven't found many lakes in New Mexico, but the wife says no fishing rods allowed. Have a good time. TGG"
