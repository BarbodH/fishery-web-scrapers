532412,rpieske,2003-06-16 22:50:00,1276,TEmps in the 70 degree range today. Water coming up slowly. Weeds are starting to top out in many areas. Have seen some nice muskies. Been catching some while northern fishing. The females are pretty beat up from spawning. Exceptionally warm today. Summer seems to be here early.
