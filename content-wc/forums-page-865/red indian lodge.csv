There are places with nicer cabins (like Tomahawk and Totem), but the cabins range from decent to really nice (ask for cabin #4 right in the water) and they are committed to upgrading. When we left last year, the manager told us they were planning to put A/C in all the cabins. Food was decent and what was nice about it was that you got a selection by ordering from a menu instead of the ""meal of the day"" What I really liked about the place is that it is a super family place. They have a nice swimming beach with a raft, canoes, paddleboats, and bicycles. The water on Whitefish Bay is clear and great for swimming, with minimal algae problems. They also have miniture golf, a tennis and basketball court and a decent game room with a pool table, foosball, darts etc. The grounds are well kept and very spacious. The location is great, as it is just far enough out of Souix Narrows to feel ""out of the traffic"". The staff is very courteous. Most people that were there when I were on the fully guided package and most everyone I talked to were very satisfied with the guides and boats. While you can get cruisers, the 18'Lunds with the 60 hp tillers seemed better set up for fishing and there are so many islands that rough water never got to be an issue. I took my boat up there and got the boat owners package that for 65 bucks a day included unlimited gas, docking and bait. Overall, that probably broke about even as I was using about 20-25 gallons of gas/day and did go through massive amounts of minnows. For just the modified American plan (we made our own sandwiches, etc, no big deal)plus the boat owners package, the price wasn't bad. I was there the beginning of August last year and the walleye fishing was excellent, also alot of nice, non-wormy perch. I contracted an independent guide (Darcyfish on this board) and would highly recommend him. I would readily recommend this place, especially so if you are bringing the kids along."

532474,Guest,2003-06-18 00:02:00,0,the cabins were soso the ones we stayed in anyway. 800 canadians this year. they have a beach thats bigger this year cause of low water. next year we are trying some where else. my wife says for that kind of money there must be better places. so i am willing. she wants a place that gets the bill straight the first time and me too. going to try whitebirch lodge just over the bridge a little.
