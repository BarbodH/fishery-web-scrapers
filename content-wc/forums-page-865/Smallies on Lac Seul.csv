532454,Guest,2003-06-17 15:18:00,0,Hey guys I was just wondering what is your best presentation you use for the smallies.I will be heading up last week of July and wouldnt mind getting into some in the early morning before we hunt Big Eyes.Never really spent much time fishing for them because of the hot bite on Walleyes and Northerns.Any advice would be appreciated.Thanks
