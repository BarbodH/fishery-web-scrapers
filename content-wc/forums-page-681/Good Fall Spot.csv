560818,Guest,2006-09-04 08:57:00,0,Have you thought about trying the fishing near Sultan. You have tons of lakes to choose from and all of them are walleye heaven. Just to name a few that I have cleaned up on all threw the year especially in the fall. Opeepeesway is one. Biscotasing lake. Rice lake. Ramsey lake. These are all big lakes around the 20 mile in lenght. The worse fishing i've done in these lakes is no less than 30 pick's a day. Anyways just a thought

560746,Guest,2006-08-30 10:04:00,0,Several of us would like to go to Ontario late next month and do some Walleye fishing. Would love to hear about some Resorts that you think we might be able to catch some fish at. We are coming out of Illinois and would like to be fishing in Ontario. Thanks In Advance
560747,Mohleye,2006-08-30 10:12:00,368,"You might get more and better responses if you can narrow it down a little. Are you looking for something you can drive to, or fly in? There are resorts anywhere from full American plan complete with guides, to basic housekeeping or even camping. You should have quite a few options available in late September."
560750,Guest,2006-08-30 10:51:00,0,Thanks for the suggestion. We would be driving and would like to stay within 250 miles or so of Int Falls.
560761,Mike Kansas,2006-08-30 14:40:00,1463,"Give Little Canada Camp at Ear falls, Ontario a shot. It is located below the dam at Ear Falls and the fall fishing there can be awesome. We have been going there for two years and are headed back in three weeks. Nice accomadations, reasonable pricing, great host and service, 5 minutes from Ear Falls.www.littlecanadacamp.com Good luck,Mike Kansas"
560765,Burr,2006-08-30 16:07:00,8612,"It's not Ontario, but it is within 250 of I-Falls - Pine Falls, Mb. During the whole month of October Pine Falls is rather full of walleye fisherman - fishing the mouth of the Winnipeg River. Big fish time of the year, greenbacks. Also, not really a resort, more of a motel stay in town. AKA Papertown."
560786,Sutsgold,2006-08-31 13:54:00,219,"Mike, im going to give below the dam a shot in late october. Please keep us posted as to how your trip goes. Thanks"
560788,Mike Kansas,2006-08-31 14:49:00,1463,"Sutsgold, I would be happy to tell you how we do. Like most fisherman I will probably expand on the truth a little bit so if i were you I would discount what I tell you by 10%. HOW ABOUT A PRACTICE RUN: Suts, Everyday day was awesome. We had a tough time catching any Walleye under 6 pounds. There was 7 of us and each of us stopped counting our fish we personally caught everyday at 100. There was a couple of days that I had my 100 by 11 am. So I would stop fishing off the dock and take a boat up to the Dam. When you got to the Dam there were so many fish that their backs were sticking out of the water. It was a scary site. Every day was the same, hookset after hookset, Hog after Hog, trophies galore. We had to go to the store and buy some fish because everything we caught was to big to clean. Got to go. I'm at the Chiropracter to get my back adjusted from all the fish I caught. Trust me the pain is worth it. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
560792,Sutsgold,2006-08-31 20:58:00,219,"Mike, I hope to see a story just like that when you get back only you forgot to mention the incidental 55 in. musky you caught. Best of luck"
560794,Kansaseye,2006-09-01 08:39:00,6,"Mike, Do you know if they have completed work on the dam yet? When I was in Ear Falls the second week of August it looked like they had added a new set of bouys below the dam keeping boats a little further away. Also, I'm curious to hear what affect the blasting and heavy equipment has had on the walleye bite."
560798,Mike Kansas,2006-09-01 11:09:00,1463,"Sutsgold--- It was a 57"" Muskie. I forgot because I was so busy calling the Taxidermist about getting a replica made of the 14 LB Smallmouth I caught on Gummie Wurms. Kansaseye--- Sorry don't know about the status of the Dam. Talked to Kevin several times the Owner of Little Canada Camp and he said the water was cooling down and the fishing was good with some of the bigger fish beginning to move in. Fall fishing is always dependent on good water flow and colder water temps bringing the fish to the Dam. To be 100% honest with you I will have a ball no matter how good the fishing is.....however it has been excellent fishing there for us the last two years. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
