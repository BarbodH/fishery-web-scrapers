560714,old fisherman,2006-08-29 07:06:00,545,It has been reported to me that at Nestor Falls the lake is down 3'? I'm wondering how hard it is to launch at the goverment dock or at Vic and Dot's. It would seem to be very difficult if this is true. How has fishing been out by Hay Ialand or at White Fish Bay? Just two weeks to wait.
560717,Guest,2006-08-29 09:23:00,0,O/F We put in at the Govt dock and it was fine but that was in June and the lake was definitely down then but I would guess closer to 2'. You could probably go to witchbay.com and see their report. Good Luck.
