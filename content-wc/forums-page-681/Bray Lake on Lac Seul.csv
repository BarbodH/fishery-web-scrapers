Bray Lake is a round lake with shoreline, the mouth/entrance, one island, one sand bar, one gravel bar, and one hump. Go to the windward side, find the active depth, reel 'em in. There are areas better than others which an experienced walleye angler can easily figure out and narrow down in a day. The areas that are more rocky or cobble will hold smallies, from ice out until early-July. The smaller, shallower back bays, on the east, south and west, and small creek at the west end, will hold early-season pike, before they move to the deeper water and feed in the weed beds that surround the island, and run periodically along the north and south shorelines. Do you want some grid coordinates? Is that what's expected these days? Waaa, if you're a resort owner/operator/whatever on a bad fishery, that's your problem. The fishery is your insurance policy in the lodge business. If you didn't check over the 'policy' closely before buying, that is your mistake. NWO Fishing Bum"

560575,Guest,2006-08-22 21:10:00,0,"NWO, Sorry dont own a lodge just love to fish and have been fishing Bray before you were in diapers. It is not your ""private spot"" and you did not invent fishing or did you discover any spots on Lac Seul for the first time. You are a product of GPS and those who told you where to fish. So please continue to share your self acclaimed original knowledge of Bray and Lac Seul. By the way at the next meeting of ""The Lac Seul Fishing Scene"" they should give you an award for Modesty."
560576,tlars,2006-08-22 21:24:00,137,"Come on guys, let's play nice. Lac Seul is a special place and certainly big enough for all of us. So what if Waaa has been fishing the lake forever. More power to yah, Waaaaa. I am appreciative of whoever had the foresight to discuss and implement the regulations we now fish under. I can only see Lac Seul getting better and better - if that's possible. So what if Bum uses GPS instead of triangulating land marks. More power to you too, Bum. I only get to go to Lac Seul twice per year - the week after opening week and the last week in Sept. It's a different kind of bite, different areas and the treat of a lifetime each trip."
560578,Guest,2006-08-22 23:50:00,0,"Waaa, First of all, I am no product of any GPS technology. I was fishing out there long before GPS was being carried in depth finders, and rarely in any form. GPS for fishing only became mainstream in the last 5 years. The spots I discuss are the product of my fishing experience and expertise (as in several years of fishing there). I don't care if your older than I am, and fished there before I was born . . . do you think that makes you special? None of my knowledge came from you I'm sure. Rather it came from numerous experiences out there of crawling along contours, catching and sometimes not catching, and learning as I went, then sharing my experiences with my fellow guiding colleagues. And yes, with today's technology, those spots-on-spots can be marked with a GPS once you find them. What difference does it make if you line-up landmarks and throw marker bouys, or drive to a waypoint. It maximizes fishing time, that's it!! The point is that expertise is required to find those spots, fish them properly, and with the right presentation, at the appropriate time, with the appropriate conditions. I have hundreds of spots I fish on Seul, each having a time-proven record, and almost all of which were discovered through careful observation and trial and error (as in fishing a spot that theoretically should hold fish and having it produce routinely). If you think everyone younger than you is just mindlessly driving around to different waypoints that you or somebody else provided, you are sadly mistaken. Am I detecting some mid-life crisis in you, Waaa? NWO Fishing Bum"
560580,Skylane,2006-08-23 06:28:00,101,"Waaaa, I am not absolutely politically aligned with NWO Fishing Bum, but I must defend his fishing ability-knowledge. Fishing out of Silver Water Wheel 4 years ago was quite an experience, what that group does is as much science as it is knowing the humps. There is much to be learned from those people."
560585,Mohleye,2006-08-23 08:50:00,368,"Waaa, If a guy who fishes these waters for a living every day is good enough to share some general knowlege with a bunch of guys who only have a week or two a year to fish a huge body of water, I'd say that's pretty good of him. If you've actually been fishing Lac Seul since he was in diapers, how about sharing some of your treasure trove of knowlege? For the record, I don't fish Lac Seul at all, and have no idea who NWO is, but you're way out of line."

Review Business 101"
560693,Guest,2006-08-28 15:29:00,0,"I have always been entertained by NWO and have appreciated his fishing knowledge. Business 101 does not state that you cannot joke around a little on a web page. And that is what he was doing. I will say that most of you out there will not fish in the same spot as NWO as there are not that many lodges in that area where he fishes. That being said, he was being polite and answered where Bray lake was at. If he did not WANT TO HELP, he could have simply not responded. But he does reply kindly, and throws in a little jest about giving too much info, and you jump down his throat?? Grow up HMMMM. I bet waaaa and hmmmm have the same IP address!"
560718,Guest,2006-08-29 09:30:00,0,"No, I have not been in his boat. Nor do I know who he is. I fish out of Evergreen. I just think that some people on anonymous boards are idiots for taking such grand/angry stands. He was joking around a little and you jump all over him. NWO and I will never meet in person, but I do respect him and his knowledge. If he wants to hold back some knowledge on a free website, I really do not see what is wrong with that. I think from now on, all persons who post on this site must first post ALL of their GPS locations and all knowledge of all lakes and not hold back any info. This will ensure that Hmmmm does not feel left out."
560722,Guest,2006-08-29 10:53:00,0,"Dave, Sorry you cant understand my tiff with NWO. He wants all the good but is concerned that too many people will be fishing Lac Seul because of information given out on WC. He is especially concerned that people might fish Bray because his merry band of guides sit in Bray in Aug/Sept and fish all day so others may crowd him and catch fish that he believes should be his. He promotes himself and his business on this site as long as it benifits him. But he does find time to critize other LS Resorts like Lac Seul Adventures about self promoting on this site. NWO is a classic double standard guy. Only interested in himself and his self promotion. Dont dare fish in a spot that he thinks he discovered....especially if he is going to live there for two months."

560695,Guest,2006-08-28 16:14:00,0,"Dave B, Wrong on all counts. By the way NWO never did tell anyone where Bray is. He simply said that he had fished every square inch of it and that he probably should not share any more knowledge about Bray with those who might want to fish it because he had probably already told to many people too many things about Lac Seul and the locals at Lac Seul were concerned about to much info getting out. I think it is sad that a man who uses all the FREE ADVERTISING on WC to promote himself and his business would show the arrogance that he does about Bray. If you want to know why it's because he and his buds live on Bray in August and September. God forbid that anybody else fish there....so dont tell them......ARROGANCE GALORE Wake up Dave ...or are you in one of his boats in August?"
560541,Guest,2006-08-22 12:13:00,0,Could someone tell me where Bray Lake is located? Thanks!
560546,Mike Kansas,2006-08-22 12:58:00,1463,"Bray is located on the south shore. If you look on a map and find Vaughn Lake, Bray is Northwest of it and connects to the main lake."
560550,Guest,2006-08-22 14:40:00,0,Thank you very much for the info.

560555,Guest,2006-08-22 16:13:00,0,"NWO, ""The Lac Seul Fishing Scene"" Do you mean the business's that profit from the tourism that is attracted to Lac Seul because of it's excellent fishing. I know you wont believe this but Lac Seul was a great lake to fish way before you or most of ""The Scene"" was born. You and the others who derive income from the fishing industry on Lac Seul should be thanking your lucky stars that Lac Seul is what it is and that you can enjoy some financial stability from it. If you want a challenge find a lake that has a thinner population and test your expertise at building a business. You better hope the Gold Rush doesent end because if it does or you try someplace else you will be eating free cheese and cashing food stamps."
560557,Guest,2006-08-22 16:18:00,0,"I think that NWO was kinda joking about not wanting Bray Lake fishing spot to be public knowledge. I have been on this site for years, and I would say that NWO is not someone you would say is a whiner."

Nothing worse than being crowded out by flocks of ""seagulls."" Last I heard is LS is to be drained for restoration. Think Fall of 2006. Adding more structure, silt dams, rip/rap to stabilize the shoreline and removing siltation. Unfortunatly the lake will take 20+ years to be back to it's glory years. It will be a sad day in fishing history. Suggest you start fishing the river below the dam. Happy trails"
