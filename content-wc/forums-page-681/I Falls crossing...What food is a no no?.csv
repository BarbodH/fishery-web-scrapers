559934,Catman59,2006-08-02 05:25:00,345,Lakers............... any report?
560733,Guest,2006-08-29 21:20:00,0,Does anyone know if I can take a whole watermelon and sweetcorn (on the cob) across the border into Fort Frances?
560736,Trailerguy,2006-08-29 21:45:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Yes, I've taken both in the past, just no live plants, melons and corn are not live plants. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
560741,Guest,2006-08-30 00:53:00,0,"Well, per the question, I'll only entertainAand beyond. In 200y you cannot bring anything with skin on it. This includes potatotes, tomatos and yes, fish. If it has dirt on it, you cannot bring it, that includes onions, beans, hot peppers and Bud Dry. Don't ask why. Also, if you where blue contact lenses, you cannot cross. If you bring McDonalds from Ft. Francis, you cannot cross. If you drive on Michelin, Firestone, Goodyear of Bridgestong tires, you cannot cross. If you can walk on your two feet, sorry, you cannot cross. You a fish? sorry, still cannot cross, we'll nuke you. Lastly, if you're a moose, and you're not on the can of a beer, you cannot cross. Blame bin laden."
559666,Guest,2006-07-23 10:25:00,0,"Just wondering what we can, or cannot bring across the border this year. I assume no potatos? What are other groceries we can't take with us. Also if bringing worms they have to be in bedding correct? I just read that they seem to be much slower this summer for some reason?"
559670,Guest,2006-07-23 15:04:00,0,"Stop at the Safeway grocery store about 3 blocks east of the crossing and get your potatoes there. Coming back, raw meat is a no-no. No driftwood, deer antlers, and all the other questions they ask at the border."
559671,Catman59,2006-07-23 16:21:00,345,Yep..............$7.99 a bag for 10lbs of Idaho Russets !!! That was at Safeway in Dryden Friday.
559673,Jimmy Jig,2006-07-23 17:44:00,1905,"Forget Safeway, there is a good store across for Walmart, East end of town, North side. Potatoes are a fair price. Safeway prices are not fair."
559675,Guest,2006-07-23 18:47:00,0,"Catman59, did you go to sturgeon lake? How did it go?"
559679,Catman59,2006-07-23 21:42:00,345,"Yep........... just got back.Weather patterns were very extreme , saw the wind change 3 times in 1/2 hour 1 day ! Northerns galore. Walleyes were tough in the big lake . Went to bush lake nearby and did over 100 in 6 hrs with the kids. Jigged my first Laker. What a fish!!!gotta be the toughest fighting fish in the water. Felt like a Smallie with lotsa steroids !!....You ?"
559707,Guest,2006-07-24 13:59:00,0,Heading up next week. Can't wait.
559709,Catman59,2006-07-24 14:34:00,345,You going to White Sands ?
559712,Guest,2006-07-24 15:55:00,0,"Yes, whitesands."
559718,Guest,2006-07-24 17:16:00,0,Or you can get some groceries at Wal-Mart.
