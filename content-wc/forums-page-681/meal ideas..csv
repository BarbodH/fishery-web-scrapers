I don't know about you but I'd have trouble eating that much in a 1 or 2 week stay. Good luck and good fish'n IaCraig"

Put it in before you go out for the day, put a timer on it ( the kind they sell for lamps and such) set it to start about noon and off at 8*pm. Even if you don't return till 9pm it's still hot. Made mom's fishing life alot more enjoyable knowing that she does'nt have to make dinner at 9:00 when she's beat from a good day of fishing."
560404,Guest,2006-08-17 08:05:00,0,"We've found this to work very well....a few days before you head up, do some chicken on the grill. Let it cool, bag in freezer bags and put it in the freezer. Take along an aluminum roasting pan. When you get to camp, on the nite you elect to serve chicken, put the chicken in the roasting pan with a couple beers and cover with aluminum foil. Put in the oven at 250-300 degrees and heat it up. The beer helps keep the chicken moist and adds some flavor.The Lipton chicken alfredo noodles make a nice addition and are easy to make. Also another great and easy way to make walleye in camp: double up two sheets of aluminum foil turn up the edges to form a tray or pan. Place 4-6 pads of butter in the tray. Lay walleye fillets on the butter pads. sprinke lemon pepper on the fillets and put on the grill until they flake. Enjoy!!"

Did that this year for the first time, we did a surf and turf, we added sliced onion to the package. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!"

560671,Guest,2006-08-26 20:38:00,0,"This was our usual evening menu for many years, always a week stay: Cheeseburgers Breadedpork chops Spaghetti & meatballs & sausage Moose roast with frsh picked chanterelle mushrooms(made by Pete, the owner) Meatloaf & fried potatoes Baked ham & yams T-bone steaks All meals included a side of fried walleye. God I miss those trips!!!!"
560730,Dacotah Eye,2006-08-29 17:35:00,2722,I really miss those trips also and I'm going to take my son to northern Manitoba next fall unless someone or something kills me first.
560198,Guest,2006-08-10 11:06:00,0,i know this was covered some time ago but was wondering (other than walleye) if you had any other dinner ideas. nothing to fancy but looking for different ideas.

560210,Mohleye,2006-08-10 14:57:00,368,"We spent a lot of years trying to outdo each other cooking elaborate evening meals, to the point it was getting ridiculous. We sure ate great, but everything tastes great after a day on the water. Two years ago we decided our priorities needed to be easier, faster, and fewer dishes. Now we grill a lot, boil a bunch of potatoes at once on the outdoor propane cooker and put them in the fridge. They can be sliced and fried or shredded for hash browns. Bring up chili or lasagne. Doesn't much matter, as long as it's simple. Evenings are for drinking a few Blues on the porch, not washing every pot and pan in the kitchen."
560222,phishfearme,2006-08-10 18:48:00,1242,"for our 10 day trips, we have 6 walleye (3 grilled and 3 fried) and the other four are: - boboli pizza (pepperoni and canned mushrooms) - pork tenderloin (already marinated and sealed at the factory) - spagetti night with hot sausage and fresh baked break sticks - shrimp on the barbie (coated with italian dressing) good eating but can't beat walleye - but you can over do even a great thing. phish"

560237,Guest,2006-08-11 07:29:00,0,"on our last night we usually get grill a London Broil roast. I merinate it in worchestershire sauce, freeze it. Put it in the fridge in the morning. 1 hour on the grill and it's done. be sure to put the coals around the outer edge of the grill with a drip pan under the roast to catch the drippings and keep it from flaming up. tastes great."

560241,wooglin,2006-08-11 08:44:00,371,"We eat fish every night typically, and we keep it different so it doesn't burn our tastebuds. Here was our menu this year: Fried Fish - Friday (just 3 hours on the water, so we keep it simple) Fish Tacos  Saturday (served with Crispy Walleye, lime chips, salsa) Fish Pizza  Sunday (served with Parmesan-Italian Fried Walleye, onion rings) Baked Fish  Monday (served with beer battered walleye, potatoes and beans) Cajun Fried Walleye  Tuesday (served with bacon wrapped walleye, grilled veggies) Wed. night  Venison brats (served with potatoes, beans - we don't eat fish this day so we can keep our fish to take home)"
560244,Guest,2006-08-11 10:04:00,0,"we do alot of grill things. fish obviously, chops, steaks, brats, and we use to do a big meal mid week with everyone there(this has stopped), it was kind of nice--always baked a turkey with all the fixins. it was really nice to get everyone together for a sit down meal. Plus turkey sandwiches the next day were pretty tasty about 10am after 5-6 blues in the am."
560293,Guest,2006-08-14 10:50:00,0,"A few years ago we started taking a Crock Pot along and it has worked out well. Nice Beef roast, potatoes, carrots, couple cans of beef broth plug it in any when you get back you are ready to go. The other one we do is Pork Roast and sauerkraut (sp?) which is also easy and make some out of the box mashed potatoes, also a quick and easy meal. Nice part is it's ready when you get in from fishing and an easy clean up. Paul"
