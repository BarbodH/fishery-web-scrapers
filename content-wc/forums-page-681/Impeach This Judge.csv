By Dan Gauthier Miner and News Wednesday August 30, 2006 An odd court ruling that dismissed illegal angling charges against a Winnipeg man in May -- because he did not provide any evidence at his trial -- was overturned by Justice Donald Fraser in Ontario Court of Justice in Kenora last week. Fraser heard the provincial offences appeal on Aug. 21 by Ministry of Natural Resources prosecutor Al Farrer and reversed the decision by Justice of the Peace Edith Bass to dismiss all charges against Winnipeg angler David Bereznycky following a May 2 trial. As a result, Bereznycky has been found guilty of two charges of violating the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act for an incident that occurred May 20, 2005 on the Winnipeg River. One of the charges was for engaging in angling during the closed season and the second was for obstructing a conservation officer by failing to comply with a request to inspect his boat. Fraser ordered the sentencing take place on Sept. 11 to allow Bereznycky an opportunity to make submissions. He did not attend the appeal hearing last week. Bereznycky was the last of five Manitoba men charged in the same incident on May 20, 2005 when they were found angling for walleyes on the Winnipeg River, near the Whitedog Dam, one day before the walleye season opened. Conservation officer Bryon Cosgrove and deputy conservation officer Scott McAughey testified at the May 2 trial that they observed the five men angling from a boat near the dam and saw four walleyes placed on a stringer. They told the court Bereznycky was driving the boat and did not keep any walleye. However, he was charged because he was aware that others in the boat were keeping walleye illegally. When they came to shore one of the other men stepped out of the boat, pushed it away from the shoreline and told the other men to leave. Bereznycky ignored the officers' request to return to shore and allow them to inspect the boat and drove away downriver, out of sight of the officers. He returned to the landing about 30 minutes later with no fish in the boat. Three of the other men in the boat have already been convicted of various offences related to the same incident and fined  between $250 and $1,000 each, while one was acquitted. In her May 2 ruling, Bass said she believed the testimony of the two conservation officers who testified that they witnessed Bereznycky commit the offences, but with no evidence given by the defendant  who represented himself at the trial  she said she was unable to make a decision. That's all I have to go by is the (conservation) officers' testimony, said Bass. So I can not decide one way or the other whether to convict or not to convict, so the charge is dismissed. Fraser was critical of the decision in his ruling on the appeal, noting Bass herself found the evidence given by the conservation officers believable. He said there was nothing in the transcript from the trial to contradict any other conclusion than a guilty verdict. This reasoning by the Justice of the Peace is deeply flawed and constitutes a clear error in law, said Fraser. He noted that, if this decision was allowed to stand, no defendant would ever elect to call evidence and, as a result, all defendants would be found not guilty. There is no burden on a defendant to testify, cautioned Fraser. Should a defendant elect not to call evidence, that silence alone cannot be the basis for finding a reasonable doubt."

560775,Guest,2006-08-31 11:35:00,0,Those boys.... or at least the operator should have went to jail for not following the orders of the officer. A week with Biff and Buff would have given this guy an attitude adjustment. The Judge should be fired or retired....
560776,Guest,2006-08-31 11:45:00,0,Thanks for the update.
560777,Guest,2006-08-31 11:50:00,0,Ok. Good example of when Judge needs to be removed. Judge Bass cannot do her job. She said it herself. Remove her. She proved she is useless and not in touch with reality.
560809,phern,2006-09-03 17:24:00,151,"I don't see real evidence that the person was fishing. In any event, here is another twist to this event. Imagine you are a visitor from the U.S. or Europe. You are in the boat and the conservation officers charge you with illegal fishing. What do you do? There is not much you can do. The first thing you have to do is pay the fine. If you decide to plead not guilty, there are extra fees that you must pay right away. This is to make sure you present yourself in court. Is it worth it to make the trip back to go to court? You have no choice. You pay the fine in any event. When you sign the receipt, there are 2 little boxes that you must mark. One is ""not guilty"" and the other is ""guilty"". In either event, you pay the fine and you pay extra fees if you plead ""not guilty""."

By Dan Gauthier Miner and News Thursday May 04, 2006 All charges against a Winnipeg man for angling out of season were dismissed Tuesday in Kenora provincial offences court when the Justice of the Peace ruled she could not make a decision because the defendant did not provide any evidence. The odd ruling by Justice of the Peace Edith Bass came after a three-hour trial where two witnesses, both Kenora District Ministry of Natural Resources conservation officers, testified to the man's guilt. David Bereznycky was facing two charges of violating the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act for an incident that occurred May 20, 2005 on the Winnipeg River. One of the charges was for engaging in angling during the closed season and the second was for obstructing a conservation officer by failing to comply with a request to inspect his boat. In her ruling, Bass said she believed the testimony of the two conservation officers, but with no evidence given by Bereznycky -- who represented himself at the trial -- she was unable to make a decision. That's all I have to go by is the (conservation) officers' testimony, said Bass. I can not decide one way or the other, so the charge is dismissed. The ruling stunned MNR prosecutor Al Farrer who told Bereznycky following the trial that she should expect them to appeal the decision. Bereznycky was the last of five Manitoba men charged in the same May 20, 2005 incident when they were found angling for walleyes on the Winnipeg River, near the Whitedog Dam, one day before the walleye season opened. Conservation officer Bryon Cosgrove and deputy conservation officer Scott McAughey testified they observed the five angling from a boat near the dam and saw four walleyes placed on a stringer. Bereznycky was driving the boat and did not keep any walleyes. However, he was charged by the officers because he was observed releasing a walleye by tossing it high into the air and was aware that others in the boat were keeping walleyes on a stringer. When the boat returned to shore, the officers approached to inspect the vessel. One of the men, Errol Bolduc, pushed the boat away and told the other men to leave. Cosgrove said Bereznycky then ignored his request that he return to shore and allow them to inspect their boat for fish. Bereznycky drove the boat away, around a bend downriver, then returned to the landing about 30 minutes later with no fish. Three of the other men were previously convicted of various offences related to the same incident and fined, while one was acquitted. Bolduc was found guilty of the same two charges as Bereznycky -- angling out of season and obstructing a conservation officer -- following a trial on Oct. 25. He was fined a total of $1,000 by Justice of the Peace Marjorie Pasloski. Pasloski also acquitted Jason Stevenson of an angling out of season charge on the same day. On Feb. 7, Mark Thompson was fined $250 for angling out season by Justice of the Peace Joe Morrison. Back On Sept. 20, Rick Klotz was fined $250, also by Morrison, after he pled guilty, without a trial, to the charge of angling during the closed season. Like Bereznycky, Bolduc, Stevenson and Thompson all represented themselves during their trials. Unlike Bereznycky, they were informed by Justice of the Peace Morrison and Pasloski they were entitled to be sworn in and give their evidence during their trials, which they all elected to do. back"
556885,Guest,2006-05-04 16:43:00,0,"Interesting case, I'm sure they'll appeal it. This brings forward a query....Are you responsible for the actions of your partners in a boat when they break the law. Say you go fishing with three other guys and they are keeping illegal fish and you are obeying the law ..are you guilty by association?"
556886,rockpt,2006-05-04 17:15:00,589,"I thought of the same thing and I don't know the answer. Doesn't appear the judge dismissed the charges on that basis, though. But, at a minimum he disregarded the officer's instruction to return to the dock and should have been charged and convicted of that. Also, there's got to be something illegal with launching an out-of-season into the air, which he also did."
556894,eyedoktr,2006-05-05 05:25:00,2426,This sucks but what can you expect from a judge named Bass. :-)
556896,Guest,2006-05-05 06:16:00,0,"While the specific question can't be answered without reference to the applicable law, as a general matter, the law requires intent to commit an offense prior to a finding of guilt. Turning to the question of whether one can be held legally responsible or accountable for the actions of one's companions, you've raised a both a legal issue and a fact issue. The first question may be whether the law prohibits conspiring to commit a crime, or aiding and abetting the commission of a crime. If the answer is yes (as it often is), then the fact question arises - was the fisherman's conduct consistent with the elements of the offense of conspiracy or aiding and abetting an offense. The finding on that question will turn on the specific facts of the situation - as an example, fisherman A, who owns and has control of his boat (i.e., he can easily exit the situation), is seen fishing all day with companions in his boat who are keeping fish illegally. Might be difficult to convince you, the fact finder, that he wasn't in league with them, on those facts and circumstances. John"
556898,Guest,2006-05-05 07:42:00,0,Two things to think about. First once the other guys jumped out of the boat and the clown drove away he should have been charged with fleeing a peace officer. Second once he drove away wasn't he in sole possesion of those walleyes in his boat? This judge screwed up.
556902,Guest,2006-05-05 09:30:00,0,This can be dificult sometimes to deal with politically in some situations. In Ontario when they changed the Northern Law to one over 37in and none between 27 and 36 it can be hard to tell an 80 year old friend that I know the Pike fishing is real good but the Walleye is dificult in a lake he has fished for 60 yrs. The gentleman wants to keep the Northern he has been catching to help the Walleye out. As well a slot Pike makes great fish soup just the perfect size......
556910,Guest,2006-05-05 11:21:00,0,"Let me get this straight- Ok, so you represent yourself and provide no evidence in your defense. You simply plead not guilty, and nothing more. So you get the charges dismissed? WOW! Maybe there is a good side to this ;) This could put lawyers out of business. :rotflmao: Seriously, WOW!!!"
556919,Guest,2006-05-05 13:50:00,0,One of the JPs in that area was investigated a few years ago for toking on the job...It was found there was not enough for charges to be laid.....makes you wonder
556947,515,2006-05-07 08:15:00,254,Really too bad our conservations officers put all there time into something like this and they get no backing from the bench. What a joke.
