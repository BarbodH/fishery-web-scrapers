560226,Guest,2006-08-10 20:30:00,0,"We will be up in Sept as well. We have been going up for 13 yrs. Great fishing and decent camp. You can get a guide inexpensively for the days or week. They're pretty fair in their prices. Get a map of the area and fish the Mission area, Pine Pt , Windigo Island which is 3 minutes away along with Lasalle Islands. ALso, you can try Vaughan lake the people at Mahkwa will help by marking your maps as well as guide you. Pike are in the weeds if they're still green, otherwise, weed edges as well as steep drop off points. Slow trolling will produce nice pike. also, you will see quite a few walleye fishing. Hope this helps.Good Luck"
