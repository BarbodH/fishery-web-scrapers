560699,Mack22,2006-08-28 17:17:00,1,"I recently got back from Lac Seul on a one week trip in the first week of August (Aug 5 - Aug 11). We stayed at Williams Lake Lodge in the south central portion of Lac Seul, straight north of Dryden. We had an amazing time, great lodge, nice people, beautiful scenery, but the fishing was slow. Here is my problem, and I was hoping that NWO Fishing Bum and other people knowledgable about Lac Seul could chime in. The weather was a little warmer than normal I was told so the water was a little warmer. We had a storm the first day there, so I am not sure if that had anything to do with it. I have heard of many people saying they are catching 100 walleyes per day, while I don't think my group of five guys caught 100 walleyes all week. We tried jigs, spinners, cranks, slip bobbers. We fished 10 FOW to probably around 35 FOW. We tried weed edges, rocky points, and clay/sand banks. We kept moving around but never really found an active group of fish. We had a great trip and plan on going back next year, but I want to be more prepared. I found this board when we got back and have been reading a lot of info about Lac Seul here, as well as other boards, and was hoping some of you could give me some pointers, or at least theories as to why we weren't catching a lot of fish. And also, anybody that was fishing up in that area at the same time, did you experience slower fishing as well? I forgot to mention that it was our first time fishing Lac Seul and we didn't have a guide either. Thanks for all your help. Mack"
560700,fishingbuddy,2006-08-28 17:39:00,18,"Hey don""t get discouraged. Our group has been fishing Lac Suel the last eight years and this year was one of the slowest for us also. Part ot what we determined was that there was an over abundance of bait in the system. The humps we fished had a tremendace amount of baitfish on them. We usually fish leeches most of the time on a live bait rig and this year it seemed this year most fish bit on night crawlers. There was times also we would sit over fish that where not willing to bite. A lot of the fish we caught where puking up siscoes. Most of the siscoes where 5 to 6 inches long. If you go to Silver Water Wheels fishing report, it seems they reported the same thing that there was an abundance of bait in the system this year. Hope this might help you in knowing what kind of bite others have had also this year. Hope you keep fishing Lac Suel because of the potential it has. Hey good fishing in the future."
560701,dave10,2006-08-28 18:49:00,342,"Mack - Your e-mail reminds me of mine last year, when we moved off of Eagle Lake to Lac Seul because we were frustrated with our numbers on Eagle. Goes to show you no place is always ""on,"" I guess. My only advice, as a virtually total newbie to Lac Seul, is to consider a different section of the lake. I have a very good friend who fishes out of the lodge you were at, and while they love it for all the reasons you noted, they are primarily targeting muskies (and my understanding is that there aren't many areas on Lac Seul that hold muskies). I think your walleye numbers might be better in a different area, but I will certainly defer to others who are more experienced as to that point. I also second the idea of checking the Silver Water Wheel reports - pretty informative. Good luck. Dave"
560702,Guest,2006-08-28 19:22:00,0,"I still believe that a first timer to any Lake especially as big as Lac Seul should invest some money in a Guide. Face it most Guides are on the Lake almost every day and they know where, what and how when it comes to catching fish. I assure you that had you been with NWO you would have caught fish. Dont give up on Lac Seul. It is an awesome Walleye fishery and you will do better. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
560731,Guest,2006-08-29 20:47:00,0,"mac 22, we also fish out of Williams Lodge, a normal day for us is about 20-30 walleyes most over the slot, occasional northern. Usally about 20 for the week. We found that live bait works best, crawlers, minnows, active days use gulp. Same as other reports, wind is huge, fish the wind side of points or funnel areas. No wind slow down with small jigs or live bait with a 3 way swivel. Don't overlook 40 ft of water on the flats. Most every point or island have some type of active fish, keep moving. We have been up there 5 yrs now and have many spots to choose from. We mainly fish the main lake portions, every year we look for new ones. Most of the time I use 6lb fireline with 1 oz walking sinker, is more then enough to stay on on the bottom. Hope this helps, it's a great fisherie"
560732,Guest,2006-08-29 21:11:00,0,"I know what you're talking about when you said, ""too much bait"". We were there in mid-July and we threw everything at them and they sat on the bottom and watched our minnows and leeches go by. We could mark schools of inch and a half minnows in the water and look over the side of the boat and the school was following the boat. And you're supposed to compete with natural bait? And yes, there are days when you can catch 100 walleyes a day. It just didn't happen this year."
560737,Guest,2006-08-29 22:37:00,0,"Hey Mack, We were up at Williams Lake last week (Aug 19-25). This was our second year and we had a very similar experience as your group had this year. We probably caught four times the number of fish last year compared to this year. Most of the fish this year were in much deeper water, and very reluctant to bite. We fished every day out in the main body of water of Lac Seul. I changed jigs frequently and tried many different fishing techniques, but none seemed to yield the easy bite we had last year. I would say that most of our fish caught were holding in 30-35 feet with a few caught at 40 feet. I added stinger hooks to some of my jigs that seemed to help with the soft bite. Crawlers seemed to be more successful for us than minnows, with leaches being a close secondary bait. Plastics didn't seem to work well for us this year. We also noticed 4-5 inch ciscoes in the bellies of the keeper walleyes taken. The days we found most difficult were extremely calm bright sunny days. We always found and caught fish on the windward side of island points on other days. The storms that blew thru overnight seemed to help fishing the next day. Our group chalked up most of our poor fishing success this year to a very hot summer season that drove fish deeper making the schools more difficult to fish."
560781,bushy,2006-08-31 13:06:00,17,"Went up with my Dad the week of Aug. 12-18. Stayed at Gold Pines by Ear Falls. First time to the lake and I thought we did well. Traveled 13 miles to fish Steamboat bay. Made it down there 5 days and each day fished from around 8 to 2 and caught about 40 to 50 fish each day. Fished in depths of 12 to 22 feet along break in shore. Most fish were in the 15 to 18 inch range. Usually caught about 3 or 4 over slot and around 8 in the slot. Biggest for the week was my Dad's 26"" and mine 24"". Backtrolled spinners with minnows or nightcrawlers. Had one 1/2 mile shore all to ourselves and just stayed there the whole time. Other people were going 20 miles or more down to McKensie Bay and getting into bigger ones. Weather was real nice and had a great week. Will be back next year has long has my 79 year Dad is healthy."
560770,Guest,2006-08-30 19:17:00,0,"We were at Goldpines Resort the same week(our 1st time on Lac Seul also) and we actually did very well once we stopped trying so hard. The first day we used slip bobbers with crawlers, trolled bottom bouncers with spinners & trolled cranks around numerous islands/points with only fair success. On the 2nd day we really focused on slip bobbers & jigs while anchored on the windy side of islands/points/reefs. We too saw lots of fish on the bottom and decided the majority of the fish weren't active/chasing so we SLOWED DOWN our offerings. We would anchor between 15-25ft of water with only the front anchor and let out 15-20ft of slack rope to hold us and also let me(in the back) swing back & forth over the structure sometimes in 15ft of water and then swinging deeper into 25ft depths or more. By the 3rd day we were rigged like we were ""perch fishing"" 2 split shots about a foot above a plain #4 hook and 1/2 crawler and we would drop the split shots to the bottom and then reel up 1.5 cranks and let the pole bounce in the waves. The walleyes would just suck the bait in and our rod tips jiggled(like ice fishing with a spring bobber) and we set the hook. Don't know exactly how many per day but we kept count a couple of mornings and we averaged 14-15 per hour(3 people) not including perch,northerns,rock bass or whitefish. We also missed our share of short hitting fish but did lots of arm raises:-) For not knowing the lake and not venturing out too far(30 min. boat ride from camp was the farthest) we felt we did quite well although our biggest ""eye"" was only 24"" but LOTS of 17-20"" fish. I'm sorry that you didn't fare as well as you hoped, but, as others have said, don't give up on this fishery, it truly is awesome !!:-)"
560774,Guest,2006-08-31 11:02:00,0,"my group went the third week of july. fishing was tough and it was hot!!! first 2 days in the mid 90s. 3 or 4 days the week before in the 90s. we did not mark a single fish the first 2 days shallower than 30 feet. water temp hit 78.5 degrees one day. hottest i've ever seen it. some were being caught in the weeds by pike fishermen, but i think they would run in and feed and then head for deeper cooler water and remained fairly inactive. we had about 3 half day periods of typical good lac seul fishing. the balance of the week was tough. it was just too hot this year. largest walleye all week was only 23 inches. a first for my boat. usually lots of 24"" and up fish in a week. my son and i have logged plenty of 100 fish days, but not this year. we do, however, move if we get into those 13-14 inchers. spoiled, i guess. probably would have worked em this year. oh, forgot to mention that we were blown off the main lake for 2 days. that was just mother nature's way of adding insult to injury. there's always next year."
560780,orchard frank,2006-08-31 12:58:00,1900,"I've spent a lot of time on Lac Seul over the years and one thing definitely worth trying when it is hot and calm is to move shallow. I know it goes against the grain,sounds crazy, but I have had some incredible days on those HOT calm days moving as shallow as a few feet. Have to be quiet, some areas near weedlines can be packed with fish, especially if you can find an area with an inside weedline with gravel or rock between the weeds and shore. I always carry a few planer boards for these conditions also, a shallow stick bait right along shore can be a hoot or along steep banks also. About 10 years ago we encountered a bad stretch of heat and gave up on eyes, started fishing weeds for pike,first fish was a walleye about 7lbs on a Johnson silver minnow!! Good Luck"
