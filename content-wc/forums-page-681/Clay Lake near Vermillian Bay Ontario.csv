Have gone to North Star Lodge web site, but would like to hear from anglers who have fished there before. Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks."
560783,Guest,2006-08-31 13:14:00,0,"have fished out of north star lodge 4 times the last 2 years. fished in spring and mid august. both times of year have been very good. in the spring we trolled floating rapalas in all colors and had very good success for walleye and northern along the rocky shorelines of the main lake. casted for smallies on the rock piles with average results. floated leaches under slip bobbers along the shore of the falls and slayed the spawning smallies.(double and triple headers were common with 17-21 inchers and the occassional walter mixed in) carter lake at the north end of the north arm was very productive in the spring as well for both northern and walleye. in august there was still a good trolling bite, but mostly for smallies and pike.(the majority were caught in ""the narrows"" and stan or sam can show you where all these spots are on the map) the walleye we caught were off of burnt and christmas tree island in the main lake 15-25 ft.all of these spots are within 20 mins of camp and the lake is very easy to navigate. camp is well run and is in good shape. great boats, and dont miss prime rib night if you do the housekeeping plan. also have an affordable family plan in august. if you talk to them let them know rick and bob from west chicago say hey..bender out"
