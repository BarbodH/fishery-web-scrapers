Under this program, all citizens of the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Bermuda entering the U.S. by air and most seaports, must present a valid passport starting Dec. 31, 2006. All persons entering the U.S. by any means must present a valid passport after Dec. 31, 2007 AND: The U.S. is starting to issue E-passports, which include a digital photograph and a computer chip that holds the same information that is printed inside the passport Â– name, date of birth, gender, place of birth, dates of passport's issuance and expiration, and passport number. U.S. border agents will be able to scan the chip to verify the information that appears inside the passport. So far only the Colorado Passport Agency is producing E-passports. Older passports are valid until they expire for entry into the U.S., but other countries may require travelers to present electronic passports, in which case U.S. travelers would need to get an E-passport to enter those countries."

Or, some where they shouldn't be. Hey, maybe also a implanted GPS device so you could be tracked. Mandatory chip would make things much easier for law enforcement."
