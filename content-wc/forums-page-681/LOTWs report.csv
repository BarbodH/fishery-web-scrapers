560679,freespoolin,2006-08-27 14:51:00,472,"Very good for walleye, mid-lake humps, 22'-33'"
560683,woogie,2006-08-28 07:40:00,63,"We just returned from Sioux Narrows. The best walleye fishing was in Yellow Girl Bay on humps adjacent to deep water, 50' to 60' feet. Start on the top of the hump and work your way deeper until you connect. We found that we caught as many walleye on Gulp as live bait. Crawlers outperformed the minnows. Gulp twister tails, crawlers, and turtleback worms all performed well. Color didn't seem that important. Best fishing times were morning to about 11:00 am and then again after 3:30 pm. When the sun was overhead it died off. Also try shorlines with dropoffs to 50' of water."
560684,bronzeback77,2006-08-28 09:28:00,97,Thank you
560686,rpieske,2006-08-28 09:46:00,1276,Just got home from Nestor Falls after 3 months up there. Walleyes were just moving back into the weeds when I left. Muskies were following them in.

560728,Guest,2006-08-29 14:50:00,0,"especially out of Witch Bay Camp is EXTREMELY quiet. Your summer crowd - jet skiis, houseboats, etc are essentially gone. Camp crowds are generally 1/3 of high season. It's a reall neat time of year to be there. I'm leaving day after tomorrow. By the way, for up-to-date fishing reports, check http://www.witchbay.com/fishrpt.htm"
560764,rpieske,2006-08-30 15:49:00,1276,I left there 6 days ago and the boat traffic was almost non-existent. Never saw so few boats.
