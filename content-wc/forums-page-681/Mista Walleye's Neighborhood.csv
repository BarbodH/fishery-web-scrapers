560675,Guest,2006-08-26 22:47:00,0,What a night! Just got off the lake 1 hour ago. Slamfest again. I'm warming the old arm up for the Classic next weekend. I caught a nice football tonight. 23 incher that must have weighed 5 pounds. He was so fat I couldn't hold him with one hand. 35 minutes of fishing and 6 on my chart. I also caught a 21 inch walleye and some nice slot fish.. Not bad for only 100 yards from my dock... The Frankfarter brothers are going to be asking me questions tomorrow...hehehe (inside joke). They keep telling me the Wolf is in the Narrows... Well the Frankfarter brothers will be there anyway... We've had a lot of entries for our Red Lake Fall Classic this year. I heard that nearly 20 surplus boats are trying to enter the tourney this year... We have 140 boats locked and loaded for Walleye.. Woo Hoo let the games begin...Happy Hunting.. Mista W
560685,Guest,2006-08-28 09:32:00,0,It sure sounds like 100 ft. from your dock is a pretty good spot. Good luck this weekend in the tourney!
560690,Guest,2006-08-28 14:02:00,0,Many a tournament has be pre-won while pre-fishing. ;) Good luck in the tournament!
560691,Guest,2006-08-28 14:22:00,0,"sorry mista, You are fishing for second place. I have the spots and the skills. First place is mine. Its in the bag. Come take my picture. Give me the prizes. No charge for autographs. It's a done deal. Pass the Champagne. Victory is mine. All over but the shouting."
560694,grt1,2006-08-28 15:44:00,259,So does this mean I won't see you guys on Gullrock?
560696,Guest,2006-08-28 16:21:00,0,I'm guessing you won't be on Gullrock either!?!
560706,Guest,2006-08-28 20:03:00,0,"The WOLF is in the NARROWS!!! Actually I heard a 31 inch walleye was caught in Gullrock last week.. Stories that need to be investigated this week. Last year I was fishing beside Mr. Walleye himself G. Roach. He wished me luck. I also gave a few pointers to the Ice Man and Snow Man.. They weren't impressed..hehehe But the bubblies were good that night.. Well, I'm going to be Pre-Fishing and telling fish stories all week with the Tourney Boys starting tommorrow. Woo Hoo Let the games begin...I can hear that Big Fish calling me already.. Good Luck Yall... Mista W"
560716,Guest,2006-08-29 08:58:00,0,"Everyone I talk to says ""GO WEST YOUNG MAN.....GO WEST""! We start pre-fishing tomorrow in hopes of locating the Big Wallhanger. I like Gullrock.....will spend some time there either tomorrow or Thursday. I'm hearing a lot of stories of people catching 8/9 lb. walleyes. We'll see if those big buggers are around tournament time. I hope so....and I hope their hanging around my live-well. Good luck anglers!"
560726,grt1,2006-08-29 14:32:00,259,I was talking to a friend who heard from Budfll (remember him?) that someone at his camp found a 38inch walleye and a 31inch walleye floating on Gullrock a week ago. Is this the truth or just an urban myth?
560727,Guest,2006-08-29 14:43:00,0,"No truth at all...it was a 39"" Walleye and a 42"" Walleye and they were in the mouth of a 74"" Musky."
