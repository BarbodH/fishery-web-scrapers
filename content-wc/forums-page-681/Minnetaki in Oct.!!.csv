I understand the fishing can be awesome, but the weather not so good. Pray for Indian summer! I'll be in a campground just south of town and will be fishing mostly Minnetaki and Abram Lakes. Probably will run over to the English River outlet and maybe even to Redpine Bay hoping for some returning fish to spawning areas. The chutes produces pretty well in early spring and that undoubtly is a spawning spot, so will give that a try. Has anyone been successful that time of year and what is the best presentation. Jig and minnow is my favorite, but not sure that will work unless it's presented differently than just jigging. This will be a brand new experience for me and would appreciate any tips, etc. How is the water levels usually around the first of Oct? I believe they start drawing down Lac Seul in the fall and can effect other lakes. Any help for Minnetaki or surrounding lakes would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance........."

I was up there last year at that time for business and talked with some fishermen who were having unbelievable success on minnitaki. They were also enjoying the lake by themselves. Let us know how you did when you get back.

I just need to figure out the best approach and presentation. Start with the basics and go from there. Hate to spend alot of time on say; jigging a minnow etc which is great in the spring, when another presentation would work better in the fall."
