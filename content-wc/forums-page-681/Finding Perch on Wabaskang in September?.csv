Spring and Summer perch seem easy enough to find, but now that we're heading into fall, I need any suggestions available for locating them (and getting them to bite)! Thanks!"

After the 1st narrows, the 2nd island to the west has a red cabin on the point, the weed bed NW of that island produced well last year, there are similar weeds in Keynote that also have done well in the past. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
