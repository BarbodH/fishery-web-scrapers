I live an hour away from Nipawin, and fish it a bit, but I also fish Codette lake more as its closer to me(same river, just before the Nipawin dam). We fished at Nipawin during the Premier's cup (although we didnt enter the tournament, as my partner couldnt prefish, and we hadnt been on there except for 1 day in early June), fished 2 days at Nipawin on the river , furthest north we went was just past eagles nest, if you can believe in 2 days fishing, 2 boats, 3 per boat, never caught 1 single walleye! Tried Lindy, jigs, bottom bouncers and cranks.....nada, some goldeyes, couple pike, thats about it. Went and fished on Codette for 2 days, much better, I caught 3 - 3lbers the one day, but nothing bigger than that, but thats not too bad, lots of little ones as well. Dont know about the Nipawin fishery.....I hope they expand the slot as I think there is a problem.....getting overfished me thinks.....used to always go there, bought my boat in 1998 and fished there lots for 5 years. Seems like its getting tougher to catch em, and more boats around. Have a 12lb2oz on my wall from there.....and had caugh several in the slot, but since 02 havent done all that great. Dont get me wrong, still lots of big fish in there (just ask Fr. Zajac!!), but seems to be those 3-8 lb range have disappeared, at least to me......cant comment about further up the lake at Tobin, etc as I have never fished up there. But all this being said, we are fishing this weekend the family, just not sure if it should be at Nipawin or Codette...."

Then came back and fished in on thusday and caught 5 fish, 2 aound 6-7 pounds and 2 around the 9 pounds. Then friday i only caught 3 fish that were 5-8 pounds. And on saturday went from 9:30 till around 2 and caught 1 jack. Not so good right now."

560841,Fishful Thinker,2006-09-04 15:09:00,100,Could it be that too many people have put their trophies on the wall?
560851,Guest,2006-09-04 22:08:00,0,"I think it has had a huge impact on this river system. The weight in the vanity cup as been going down and down, and there are not near as many big fish being caught. Iam not saying there isn't anymore big fish in the river because there is, just not as many. The proposal for next year is fish between 50 cm and 84cm will go back to swim another day. Right now the protected slot is 55 to 80. So hopefully when this is put in place the numbers of bigger fish will grow to what is was."
