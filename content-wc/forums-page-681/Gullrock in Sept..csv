560535,sifty,2006-08-22 09:13:00,46,Going up sept. 2-9th wondering what the lake temp is and at what depths you guys are having the most luck? Will be the 7th trip to Gullrock for myself and love it everytime I go. I was up on the first week of july and fishing was not so good. Hope the sept. trip will be better. Always have better luck drifting and backtrolling with lindy rigs. Is there still a ban against fires in the area for shore lunch? I was also wondering if anyone has caught a musky on gull rock? In July I caught two fish back to back that were about 13 inches long that sure looked like small muskies.
560583,grt1,2006-08-23 08:25:00,259,"I was out yesterday for a couple hours at Burnt Island, caught lots of walleye in the 13 to 15 inch range and several saugers in the same range. Water temperature is 68 degrees. I read the message about the muskies on red lake, I was up there last week and wow, the northerns were everywhere and were they mean, hitting the walleyes as we were pulling them in. Maybe there is a Musky hybrid up there."
560622,Guest,2006-08-24 12:03:00,0,"Took the kids out on Tuesday for a 30 minute fish, just off of Howey Bay, Pine Island. My oldest daughter brought in a 27 inch walleye. We picked that one up at around 35 feet. I went the following day to see if those hogs where still hanging out and they had moved to 50 feet. They've been coming up to feed at 35 feet. Took some nice pics. Going to try Keg tonight... Mista W"
560715,sifty,2006-08-29 08:46:00,46,GRT1 were is Burnt Island located on gullrock? As stated earlier I have been coming up there for 6 years and I can't remember an island called by that name. I love to fish new area's on the lake as rubbing shoulders with other boats is not something that I enjoy-get enough of that back home. Thats why I hardly ever fish marker Island or the boot. Any tips would be appreciated.
560719,Renn,2006-08-29 09:50:00,87,"sifty, Burnt Island is the round island if you travel straight off the ""toe"" of the boot. Another way to explain it....if you draw a straight line from the point of Clay Banks to the toe of the boot. It's the larger round island north or northwest of that line. Many a walleye has come from it's waters. Renn"
560724,sifty,2006-08-29 11:58:00,46,"Renn, Thanks for the the clarification I have fished the Island before and have it down as one of my favorites just never new what the name was. Thanks Sifty."
560790,sifty,2006-08-31 17:02:00,46,"Leaving sat morning any special gear or lures I should have before coming up. Whats working best- trolling, jigging, crawlers,leechs,minny's? Bought some gulp for this trip going to give it a try along with salted minnows."
560791,Renn,2006-08-31 17:44:00,87,"Sifty, I'm leaving in the morning for Gullrock also. Good luck finding leeches. I think the leech season is over. We will fish live bait rigs, with minnows and crawlers. Have a great trip!! Leave a few for me."
560795,sifty,2006-09-01 09:02:00,46,I'm in a 17 ft. pro-v grey and white in color with suzuki motor- if you see me come on over and give me a shout. Good-luck and have a safe trip.
560806,Guest,2006-09-03 15:49:00,0,"you dog, headin up again? Let us know how you do."
560302,Renn,2006-08-14 15:35:00,87,"Thanks for remembering me ruffe!!! Just got back Saturday, am heading back Sept. 1. My excuse I am telling work is that I forgot something!!! :-) Had a pretty good week, nothing real huge 3 - 26 1/2"" were the biggest walleye. One by my 9 year old son and another by my 7 year old daughter. The third was caught by my mom. I think we hit it when they were coming off the mayfly feeding binge. We caught quite a few fish for the week and had a great time. Probably, the highlight of the week was witnessing my dad sticking a monster northern! The best part is it's still swimming. The count down has begun again! :-) Renn"
560309,Guest,2006-08-14 22:19:00,0,you dog Renn!!!All I have been doing is mowing the lawn.Still looking to go muskie fishing.Don't know when or where but still want to go a couple of times this fall.I don't have that duck hunting thing so I will probably fish all the way through November.
560320,Guest,2006-08-15 09:26:00,0,"Good for you Renn! 3- 26.5"" walleyes are nice. I hear of a lot of people catching big northerns up there. Our boat is anti-northerns but once in a while hook on to a large one. You go to Gullrock quite often....where do you stay when your up there?"
560363,Renn,2006-08-15 19:30:00,87,"We stay at Poplar Point. Have been for the past 12 years. Before that we stayed at Weavers, now Wrights. And before Weavers it was owned by Dave Retzsky. Don't know if I spelled that correct or not. That was when they had chemical toilets in the cabins. That was fun!!! And the toasters would make those old diesel generators groan!!! :-) Hair dryers were a no, no.They would completely shut those things down!!! Grant and Bev at Polar Point are great people. But I think most camp owners on Gullrock are great to work with. The camp is a little out of the way on the lake but we don't ever go farther up the lake than the boot. Looking forward to the next trip! Renn"
560380,Guest,2006-08-16 09:00:00,0,Thanks for the info Renn. We have been staying at Golden Hook Camp for many years now and really enjoy our stay there. Bill & Maureen are great people and the camp is beautiful. I hear good things about Poplar Point and other camps on Gullrock. The lake is managed tightly by the owners which is great. Their ensuring the quality of fishing for many years to come. All the best....and happy fishing!
560390,Guest,2006-08-16 17:53:00,0,"This will be my second time on Gullrock in Sept. I will be up on the 9th. We stay at Procyk's which has good accomidations and good equipment. Their fish house is awsome. My group had very good fishing for Walleye and Northern. Compared to 30+ years fishing in the Winnipeg River which is also very good. Several eyes caught in the 24-26"" range mostly near Gullrock on a plain hook and slitshot rig as well as rigs w/spinners. I released a Northern large enough for a 2005 In-Fisherman master angler award on a crankbait. If you don't know where to go, just look for the crowd of boats on a spot. Rub shoulders with them, actually. Do what they do or change it up. You'll find the pattern. That's how it seamed to me the first year up."
560398,Guest,2006-08-16 19:20:00,0,"I wouldn't recommend rubbing shoulders with anyone, it is a large lake afterall and theres nothing more annoying than having someone come right up to your spot and start fishing. but maybe thats just one of our groups pet peeves. theres nothing wrong with fishing the same spot as someone as long as you are courteous and give them their space. there are plenty of rocky points and humps on this chain that you wouldn't need to barge in on people. thats just my two cents tho. :)"
560399,Guest,2006-08-16 19:34:00,0,"yeah, i know what you mean. we do not like it when people come to close to us--actually had a group from iowa one year follow us to a spot and got so close to us they ran over our lines trolling in their prop. Now when people do that we always ask if they from iowa!!!Just a joke ya know. We are familiar with and have fished gullrock many times but never this late."
560407,Mohleye,2006-08-17 08:43:00,368,"You have to excuse us Iowans........we get a little crazy when we get on a lake that actually has some fish in it.....although....I was on a fly-in a few years back, trolling for lakers in a huge deep-water area. The only boat I saw all afternoon came by so close they snagged my downrigger ball. They were from Minnesota, by the way."
560411,Guest,2006-08-17 10:23:00,0,"My comments about rubbing shoulders was a joke. I was merely poking fun at a lot of the people I saw fishing on Gullrock Lake. I agree with the comments you are making about moving into a spot. Noone cares what you think or what you like, that lake like no other I've been to has people on top of one another. As long as you are a fisherman about it, a novice taking turns on a drift across Gullrock or any other popular spot is a good recommendation. However, I will be the one fishing the other side. Because I choose not to do it. I'd rather find fish elsewhere."
560100,Guest,2006-08-08 10:51:00,0,How is the fishing on gullrock in sept. never been there in sept. any different patterns or tactics that need to be done. I am familiar with gullrock---so any hot places to try in sept.? What is the weather like. leaving like the 9th of sept. Thanks everybody.
560136,Guest,2006-08-09 09:00:00,0,probably the most fished lake on this board other than lac seul and nobody knows anything about it for sept.?? interesting stuff.
560137,Mohleye,2006-08-09 09:16:00,368,"This may not be much help, but for whatever it's worth....I've been to Gullrock, but not in Sept. I've been to NW Ontario in Sept, but not to Gull Rock. When we went, the fish were still in the typical summer locations and depths. We caught good size and numbers the first few days, then the weather went to heck and it got pretty tough. Our weather varied from beautiful Indian summer, to steady all-day- long cold rain, and the last day it snowed all morning with howling winds, and that afternoon we were in tee-shirts. I would start with the same spots that worked on your other trips to Gull Rock and ask the resort owner for other ideas."
560147,Guest,2006-08-09 11:13:00,0,Many people think the best fishing in the Gullrock/Red Lake area is in June. I disagree with this.....the best fishing is in late August/early September. We catch more fish on these lakes in our annual September trip and it seems the fish are bigger. Suggestion: Locate and fish humps and reefs on Gullrock. Example: the flats area might work for you. Once again a buddy I will be participating in the Red Lake Fall Classic Walleye Tournament....and if we had a bigger (faster) boat...we would fish Gullrock. Unfortunately our boat is not quick enough to get back to Red Lake if we catch a large/stressed fish. Good luck....
560180,Guest,2006-08-09 20:47:00,0,I think some of the regular posters on Gull Rock are up there as we speak.You will probably see reports next week.
560203,7thCrowWing,2006-08-10 13:37:00,132,"I have been there 9 times in late september, always caught the most fish jigging in 20-30 fow. One year the really big ones came in and we had phenominal fishing with several fish a day ( for 3 straight days) between 5-10 lbs and three fish for the week over 10 lbs (one over 10 at falls at wenasaga also). That was 7 years ago. We caught them off what we call bear point by Weavers (or whatever it is now) and it wasnt far from camp. Three sisters was always our other place to get quality fish. I have fished with out a shirt on and been snowed on that 3 week, could get any kind of weather. I am headed to Lac Seul this year the 2nd week in sept. My 1st time there."
560205,Pat T,2006-08-10 14:00:00,221,"I can confirm what CrowWing has to say. Weather has been milder the last few years in my opinion. We leave the 14th of September and have been going up this week for over 20 years. We have had days when we wish we had shorts on and then others when we had insulated coveralls on in a snow storm. My experiences have been the rougher the weather, the better the fishing. Your fish should run larger in September than in the summer months. They are starting to produce eggs by this time and fattening up for the winter. Unlike CrowWing, we use a simple 5' - 6' snell plain or maybe with a colored bead and a 3/8 oz. or 1/2 oz. slip sinker. Always have and probably always will. Jig fishermen would probably have that same feeling. To each his own. Minnows are going to be your best bait with the slip sinker method. Unless you are lucky enough to find some jumbo leeches. However, at that time of the year they are very hard to come by. Drifting the Rock is probably our favorite spot if the winds give you a nice drift. Otherwise we have had good success also at Burnt Island, the heel of the Boot and Fisherman's Point to name a few. Fishing where the wind is blowing into should be taken into consideration. Good luck, Pat T"
560206,7thCrowWing,2006-08-10 14:08:00,132,"Pat, i always want to troll and drift but i went with good old boys that only believed in still fishing. Also, a couple big fellas were over 300 lbs and everytime they moved when drifing the boat would spin out of position. Burnt island was also good for us. I believe bear point was at the entrance to keg, just off the main traveled area going out into the lake from weavers. Bait didnt seem to matter that year as long as it had a large minnow. And yes, we had snow that year!!"
560223,Guest,2006-08-10 19:17:00,0,Been to Gull Rock many times. This year went to Pakwash in the spring and am going to try it this fall. If it is anything close to the spring fishing I can't see me ever trying another lake. Fish-on
560246,Guest,2006-08-11 10:46:00,0,Pakwash!?!.....never had anyone consider it in the same breath as Gullrock or Red Lake. Very interesting!
