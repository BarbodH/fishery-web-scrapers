We arrived on Friday Aug. 9 at 6:00 PM, our flight to Lake Vimont was scheduled for 9:00Am the next morning. Air Melacon reserved a decent and in-expensive motel for us 2 minutes from the air base. The 35 min. flight to Lake Vimont was uneventful with great scenery. Upon arrival at the lake we found a clean well equipped cabin with 2 bedrooms, inside toilet and shower, excellent solar powered lights and a working 12 volt radio. There is also a caretaker located about a 1/2 mile away, he has another lake to service via a 4 wheeler trail, also has radio communications with Air Melacon base, we were the only cabin on the lake. Lake Vimont is about a 1 1/2 miles long and about the same wide with several islands, the deepest we found was 30' with most action at 12-15'. Several small Northern Pike were caught but the 14""-20"" Walleyes produced constant non-stop action using nightcrawlers with worm harnesses, we also drifted using a bare hook baited with a nightcrawler and got similar results. This was one of the better and most pleasant Canadian fly ins I been on in several years, very relaxing with great service, we were 150 [bs over the allowable weight limit and not charged. Seanik"

I have not been back with them since they sold their camps on bay du nord on the Gouin,In my opinion there best place to fish. Vimont has always produced a good walleye population.In my 20 + yrs of fishing the great north, I find the farther you fly north the better the fishing,not better cabins. I find that south of the Gouin the fishing is good, the gouin and north the fishing is something fisherman only dream about. It all boils down to did your outfitter produce the trip you expected,you caught fish and had a great time."
