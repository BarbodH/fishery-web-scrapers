2018554,brochet,2013-08-09 21:00:00,88,"lac theodat is excellent for walleys ,big pike, and brook trout.lake is only 10 miles long,nice cabins,30,00 a day.90 miles of poor gravel ,but that's why the fishing is so good."
2019065,Freytown,2013-08-10 08:54:00,770,"La Pointe aux Dorés Outfitter on baie du Sud, reservoir Gouin would be a good choice. Just be aware that the last 2 miles off the main gravel road would need high clearance. A 4x4 would be my recommendation.http://www.pointe-aux-dores.com/en/apropos.shtmlThis camp is very well kept and fishing is very good for a drive-in. Their Facebook page is updated with current photo's...have a look.https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pourv...82897828401728"
2019545,retire55,2013-08-10 14:44:00,1029,"The following web reference provides the names of outfitters in the Abitibi Témiscaming region of north western Quebec - see http://www.bonjourquebec.com/qc-en/a...CAT&num_page=3. Shield lakes with walleyes, northerns and lake trout. While the Gouin is a great destination, fishing there requires a minimum of 4 hours driving gravel roads. Maybe for trips of only 3 or 4 days, you ought to consider fly-in destinations."
2029698,mr limit,2013-08-14 20:21:00,17,Id like to thank everyone who replied to my post.The info was really helpful.Weve decided to book a trip with Nemio outfitters on the Gouin Resevoir.They seem to have everything were looking for.I like the fact its on a river so if it gets snotty on the big lake my buddy will still be able to fish.All the reviews i found all gave good reports for this outfitter.Again i want to thank everyone for their help.Sorry it took so long to reply but Ive been working 7 days a week to make the money to go.
2029938,retire55,2013-08-14 21:40:00,1029,"Nemio's is a great place to fish walleye and provides easy access to Baie du Nord. Ron and Rosie are great hosts. I fished there in Aug 2005 and had no difficulty catching walleye. The amount of sand in that area will blow you away. One caveat: When you see one of those huge lumber trucks coming, get off the road if possible. In dry conditions, when those trucks pass, its a complete dust white out for at least 10 seconds."
2030466,B-Nads,2013-08-15 07:39:00,2,"There are some very nice and productive lakes up around Mont Laurier for future reference - less driving than Guoin, less gravel driving, and some nice camps."
2033602,octanehi5,2013-08-16 10:28:00,1104,"I have fished bay du nord, with another outfitter many times its agreat place to fish along with the nemio river,which will give you a great spot to fish in bad weather. It is well worth the ride on the gravel roads, Other easy to drive to spots are over fished,The gouin is one of the best lakes to fish on a drive to.farther north you need to fly in. Have a great trip"
