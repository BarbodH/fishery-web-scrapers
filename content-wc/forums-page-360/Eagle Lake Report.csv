2026522,fishguide1800,2013-08-13 18:41:00,84,Fishing in portage is allrigjt not great.tons of fish but a slow bite need to be patient and you will catch fish.they are moving deeper.dont be scarred to go 30-40 ft.bring them up slow.west arm is aboutvthe same.evening as usuall on eagle is some what better and some larger fish will come up abd feed shallower.pi ke are deep.muskies are there but with the cold snap tgey are a little slower.

2044050,Eyes_R_Us,2013-08-20 18:52:00,66,"We fished Portage Bay for a week ending on August 3rd. It was windy and cold but the walleyes were pretty much where I expected them to be. They were on the various rock reefs at around 27ft. I would say crawlers were best even in the low light times of day. Although one day it was very cloudy and windy and we went through a bunch of leeches that day. Our numbers were down from last year and the year before but we still caught plenty of fish. It seemed like even when we were on the smaller fish (15-18"") a nice 24-27"" fish would come along to make things interesting. I'm not sure how the weather has been since we left but I'm sure you will do just fine. You may have to hunt a little harder for them but you will find them and have a blast. Good luck. Let us know how it turns out."
