The cabin at Ribes is tiny but perfectly adequate. I was there last year so knew exactly what we were getting into.Both kids caught a ton of walleye, some of them quite chunky. The usual jig/twister and worm was deadly, but on this trip a 31/2"" Northland Impulse Minnow in this funky pink and yellow color outfished everything 2:1. Honestly they were just lethal.Once again it was all about the kids and it was a pure joy to watch them bond and see the excitement in their eyes.We'll do it again for sure!If anyone's interested you can see my full report here with lots of pictures and video:http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...howtopic=71026Cheers, Mike"
