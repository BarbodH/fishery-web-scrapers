2036106,oldccm,2013-08-17 10:26:00,109,So how did the trip go?
2036810,Guest,2013-08-17 17:56:00,0,"Trip was great. My buddy got his passport in the mail the day before we left, so that never became an issue. We caught the majority of our fish on leaches on a long snell with a floating bead. Mostly fished the reef to the north and east of Pine Island on Big Sand. Biggest walleye was right at 26"", but we caught 13 others between 25 and 25 1/2"" and countless 23 and 24"" fish. Biggest northern was around 34"". We averaged 30 to 40 fish per day (three in the boat), that's all species. Most of the walleyes we caught were over 20"", which was fun. Got to see a bear and her two cubs on the shoreline, so that was really cool. We also got to meet Vic, Jim and their wives. Great folks and it sounds like they might be able to help my son and I out on an ice fishing trip to Lake Winnipeg in March! Already looking forward to next year."
2040937,oldccm,2013-08-19 15:21:00,109,"Awesome. I haven't seen Vic at the office since he got back. Vic, Jim and the wives are great people. We're on LW a lot and March is definitely the time to be there. Glad you had a good trip. Let me know when you come up and ill make sure I'm around. Glad the passport thing worked out too!"
1996089,10point,2013-07-31 14:25:00,102,Lasy year one of our guys left his passport at our camp. I thought I was going to have to leave him in Canada. He gave his ID and explained what had happened and he got back in the US no problem.
1996097,oldccm,2013-07-31 14:27:00,109,"Bait is available around town. We had a bad year for leeches. Paid $50 for a bag full with close to 90% being 1"" or less (not happy). Fuel prices are retarded so if you can pick up on the way. If you're coming up through MB there's a Shell & Esso side by side on HWY 1 about an hour before Ontario border. Gas there was 20c less per litre. Kenora was 10c less and Minaki was about $1.70L which I think is almost $6.50 gallon. I'm not sure if you said how many days your going but troll, troll, troll until you find them. People are very helpful, might not tell your their spot but will at least give you general areas. Duane and Mandy at Paradise are quite helpful with who's catching where if you stop by for gas or bait. Last time I was out Duane spent most of his time up at Big Sand beach area. Buddies name is Vic & Nic. Good luck, I wish I could make it but looks like ill be fishing a couple smaller lakes in the Whiteshell (MB) as home is Winnipeg."
1996377,troutwater,2013-07-31 16:11:00,299,What state do you live in? Someone was on here a few weeks ago and had expired passports. They said they called up IL senator Mark Kirk's office and them in a day.
1996665,Guest,2013-07-31 17:56:00,0,"We are staying for a week and generally have to fill the boat once while we are there. I will bring a couple empty 6 gallon tanks and fill them at that Shell Station. Will only fill it a little over a 1/4 of the way, but every bit helps. We are actually staying in Winnipeg on Friday night at the Casino hotel on the west end of town (Regal maybe?). When I was a kid, we would drive to Whiteshell Lake and a boat would meet us at the dock, take us across the lake, where we would load up jeeps and travel overland to Crowduck Lake. The resort was ran by a guy named Ken McKenzie (I think that was his first name) and his wife. We always did a portage one day to Saddle Lake for walleyes. Ken would fly our equipment to the lake and always let us kids ride with him in the float plane. Lots of good memories from that area!"
1996697,Guest,2013-07-31 18:05:00,0,"I said in my previous post that the casino/hotel was on the west side of Winnipeg, it's on actually on the East side. Trout--My buddy talked about calling Senator Grassley, but I think time has ran out. I spoke with him earlier and he is very hesitant to try crossing without a passport. It might be just my son and I on the trip. Thanks for the advice though, I wish I had posted this about four days ago."
1997329,oldccm,2013-07-31 21:21:00,109,Crow duck is a great place. Run buy bill and nick kolansky now. I don't think there's a float plane anymore but i think they keep boats and motors in saddle if you make the hike. Went there a couple years ago and did pretty good. Will have to get back out there again soon.
2000033,unclepaully,2013-08-01 23:09:00,112,"It turns out you don't need any id to get into the states...Right before we left for our trip a few weeks ago my buddy said we have to swing by his dad's place to pick up his dad's girlfriends passport. They were camping the week before we went up and she left it at home. Long story short, we were a few hours from crossing the border and getting her passport to her and the dad calls and says no need, we made it across. She had no drivers license, no birth certificate, nothing. The dad said it took just a few minutes and they let them both back in."
2000481,CI_Guy,2013-08-02 08:26:00,2118,I think it depends on the agent working that day. About 3 years ago a 19 year old in our group had a copy of his birth certificate that didn't have the raised stamp & his drivers license. It took about an hour and 45 min. to get things worked out. The border agent did say the birth certificate copy without the raised stamp was of little value.
2000553,troutwater,2013-08-02 08:55:00,299,"Yep good point. You have to get the certified birth certificate from the county clerk, they stamp the seal on it right there in front of you(at least they did in the county I was born). When I got mine 5-6 years ago it was $15 for one copy and $20 for two. The birth certificate from the hospital is pretty much worthless to the government like CI said. I've known people to get burned by this when filing for their passport too."
2005313,rommel,2013-08-04 16:30:00,369,many states now offer the enhanced drivers license/ID. this is used to cross north american borders by ground. much easier to obtain than a passport just go to your local dot station
1994521,Guest,2013-07-31 06:38:00,0,"My son, a buddy and I are headed to Minaki on Friday, August 2nd. The problem is that my buddy's passport a was rejected about two weeks ago because the photo he submitted wasn't in compliance. He Went in the next day and expedited his new application. He has been in contact with the State Department the last few days and it doesn't look like his passport will be here in time. I did search on this site and it seems that they will let you through the border with a certified birth certificate and state drivers license. Does anybody have any personal experience with this?"
1994641,ret-ro,2013-07-31 08:01:00,41,"Have him bring a copy of the passport application docs, a certified copy of the birth certificate, current drivers license. Canada won't be much trouble, the U.S. could take a bit longer to get back in, but he will get back in. We had a similar issue with a youth who just turned seventeen in June. I called ahead and was told that they need to get ""comfortable"" with the identity of the person before they are allowed re-entry. They advised to bring all of the documentation possible as I listed above. This was at the Baudette, MN border crossing. I would call up there yourself and give them the facts and record the supervisors name."
1994785,LOW1,2013-07-31 08:46:00,2828,"You won't have any trouble getting into Canada, assuming there are no criminal records, etc.In addition to the documents others recommended, he should have as many photo id's as possible, preferably government issue. And make sure that the birth certificate is in fact certified and not just a photocopy. It should have a raised seal on it. And have the names and telephone numbers of some responsible people ""back home"" who could be available to vouch for your friend by phone if the border folks want to check his references. Even something as simple as a paystub from an employer or a tax return could help.Everyone in the car should understand that there may be a wait involved and no one should get grouchy. And you want to be upfront and completely honest about the matter.You might want to consider returning at a non-busy time or at Baudette."
1995065,Gary from Iowa,2013-07-31 09:58:00,74,It's too late now but another avenue when photos are rejected is using the expedited process and/or contacting your US Senator's Office. My grandnephew age 8 had a similar problem when the initial photograph was rejected. His parents had another photo taken and used the expedited process and also utilized Minnesota Senator Klobuchar's website and found a link that is helpful. My niece faxed the senator's office. I suspect your senator may have a similar link on his or her website. We don't know if the expedited application or the involvement of the senator's office resulted in the passport being received quickly and in time for our trip.
1995201,SinOrSwim,2013-07-31 10:33:00,1528,This is easy. When you get to the border have someone jump out and pretend to have a heart attack to create a diversion. Have him jump out the other side of the truck and dodge behind posts and cars until he is across the border. You are welcome.
1995369,Guest,2013-07-31 11:11:00,0,"Thanks for the replies. I feel better about getting through the border. He will have a certified birth certificate, two forms of picture ID, a pay stub and a couple utility bills. I will have him contact our state Senator's Office and see if something can be done. He pre-paid for overnight shipping on the passport both ways."
1995433,oldccm,2013-07-31 11:29:00,109,{off topic} where are you staying in Minaki? Curious as I'm up there a lot
1995473,Guest,2013-07-31 11:41:00,0,We are staying at Carol's Cabins (same bay as Paradise Cove). It's been about five years since I've been up there. Any tips or advice you can give would be greatly appreciated. I will post a report when we get back.
1995665,oldccm,2013-07-31 12:23:00,109,"Carrols is a great place for small groups. A buddy from work will also be at Carrols starting this Friday for a week. He's going to be in the Black Crestliner WT. I was there about 2 weeks ago. Fishing was slow but mayfly hatch was on. Walleye were pretty deep at about 35' on humps and points. Lots of people were fishing in Big Sand area, but there was a boat at pretty much every rock pile and point. Guys will be long lining with reef runners trying to cover big water. As for Muskie I can't help you as I'm usually a walleye guy. At the time I was there leeches were the ticket, but worms were starting to get more bites towards the end of our trip. Water was a bit high, there was a few islands with reefs hidden that are usually visible. The railway bridge can really produce, but be prepared to fight hard current. To find them on the reefs and points most guys were bottom bouncing 2-3oz with spinner rigs to track them down. If you get a bit of wind you should find them a little more stacked up on those reefs. Let me know how you did and maybe you'll have some good pointers for me..."
1995729,Guest,2013-07-31 12:53:00,0,"I will have to look your buddy up. We will be in a blue and white Skeeter WT with Ia tags on it. Is bait readily available at Jacks or the marina? We will be fishing for walleye also, but pull a lot of cranks, so we do connect with an occasional musky. Thanks for the info."
