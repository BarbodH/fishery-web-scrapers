Minnow or night crawler on a jig was best producer. Cabin is very nice and George and Jeanne are top notch. The equipment is in good shape and motors ran well. If you get a strong south wind go to the weedy bay at the north end of the lake, the fish chase all the bait that gets pushed into this bay, we had a field day one afternoon in this area. Good luck."
