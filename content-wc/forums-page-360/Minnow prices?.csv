2036626,port1042,2013-08-17 16:04:00,509,"I'm heading to Perrault Lake the 1st. of Sept. I'd like to try salted minnows. How do you use them? On a jig -- on a bare hook -- or ? I'm pretty new to using minnows at all. Last spring on Perrault we put them on a jig, threw out and retrieved slowly. We did alright. I didn't do very well vertical jigging. I could use some advice. Should I be tipping anything other than a jig with them? How about spoons or spinners? Thanks!"
2036826,1jigfish2,2013-08-17 18:32:00,110,"I know monnow prices are not cheap, but I look at it this way. We all know the costs before we go, if it is too much, do not use minnows, or do not go up. There are plenty of baits to use, besides minnows. All we use is minnows, it averages out to about $80 a person, when we have to buy them. We just consider that part of the cost of going to the resort. Plenty of options out there, if you cannot afford it."
2036890,NathanH,2013-08-17 19:12:00,697,I think last year we paid 4 dollars a dz. we had a mix if sticklebacks which I don't care for and wouldn't use but at that pice you use them. We brought crawlers up and they worked well and that was opening weekend
2036906,Pooch,2013-08-17 19:32:00,4619,Was on Savant two weeks ago and the walleye ignored the stickleback minnows and jumped on anything else.Don't remember them being fussy like that before.Just thinking... anyone else ever notice that?Pooch
2036938,Pooch,2013-08-17 19:41:00,4619,"I've preserved left over minnows using about half and half of table salt and Borox.Dry the minnows and cover them with the mix. Keep refrigerated in a zip lock. DO NOT FREEZE or they will turn into mush.Walleye hit them about the same rate as live minnows. Maybe on a slow day the fish might be more selective and ignore the preserved ones. Kind of like fishing artificial's, you have to make them look alive.Still bugs me to pay forty cents a minnow when they can be gone in an instant. Rare occasion to get more than two or three fish per minnow. Usually takes a couple minnows to get an ""experienced"" biter!Preserved are a little tougher if done right.Pooch"
2037058,wallydave,2013-08-17 20:30:00,2151,"We paid 5 bucks a dozen at BBL last week. Mike Kansas showed me how to double hook the minnows, they stay on better! We used crawlers and a few leeches the minnows worked best for us."
2037234,NathanH,2013-08-18 03:37:00,697,This is key to retaining your Minnow for a number of fish. Through the mouth out through the gills and into the back. Jigs with out large collars or the wire keeper ones are best like the ones hutch or Mike Kansas sells.
2034538,Pooch,2013-08-16 15:30:00,4619,What are minnows going for around the Sioux Lookout area this year? Need a bunch in ten days for ten guys.Pooch
2034802,packpro,2013-08-16 17:19:00,695,"End of June, beginning of July in Vermillion bay area $5-$6 doz. from the camp owners. Discussions were that the supplier did not have any competition, and could basically get want he wants. The resident with the minnow trap license had bullied and sabotaged others with traps in his ""claimed"" areas. Camp owners and guides were venting pretty good one night."
2035106,scar,2013-08-16 19:03:00,196,I was quoted $5.25/dz last week at Anderson's. We did not buy as we had a flat of crawlers instead we bought in Superior Wi. for $55. I guess they worked pretty well.............3 people 1 boat Day 1 40 eyes Minnitaki day 2 94 eyes Minnitkai day 3 112 eyes Minnitaki day 4 124 eyes Lac Seul
2035242,Pooch,2013-08-16 20:20:00,4619,Those prices are ridiculous. Holy moly!!Pooch
2035298,Bigstorm,2013-08-16 20:54:00,799,Take salted minnows instead
2035778,fishinnut 3446,2013-08-17 06:54:00,638,"Bigstorm, Are you talking buying salted or doing your own?And how does one go about that if doing it yourself?"
2035810,Jatar,2013-08-17 07:25:00,169,"I think we just paid $90 for a litre, 20-25 dozen at sioux lookout, smaller size"
2035842,Pooch,2013-08-17 07:41:00,4619,Where did you buy minnows?In the past we have bought them bulk from a wholesaler south of Sioux Lookout. Our contact passed away last winter so I don't know if that is still going to be an option for our group.Just trying to cover all our bases before we leave.What do you call smaller sized?Pooch
2036506,Bigstorm,2013-08-17 14:05:00,799,"I have done it myself many times, usually end up with about 20doz in a 1qt ziplock bag with 3/4lb of salt. I do it in layers making sure that each layer is well covered in the salt. Do a search on here, there are many ways to do itThis year we bought some preserved minnows for our local bait shop and took them instead. We would buy them by the 1/2gal or 1gal size. When I asked how many dozen were in gallon, they laughed. There are way too many to count. 4 guys for 5 days in Canada went thru just over half of the gallon. The minnows were preserved in a salt brine."
2036610,2746,2013-08-17 15:57:00,3206,First it was the exchange rate (now corrected) then gas prices and now minnow prices. Makes one wonder if there is a conspiracy to keep us from Canadian fishing. We used more crawlers the last two years than ever before because of minnow prices but there are some days nothing else works. We certainly buy fewer than we used to.
