OK I took 1 bottle to Our Nakina Canada fishing trip and as the camp cook and head bottle washer after day 2 I was adding a few drops of Melchett lake water to get the last of it and on to my MY fish. You want to blow your fishing partners away take some and show some authority and say this was brought for you and start negotiating for a shot of Jack etc. We can buy it here at a grocers called Miejers here in Michigan on a shelf called Michigan 50 best products but i think you can go to www.fesslersauces.com and get some. Look I know the procedure here on walleye central with patronizing but, want to blow your fishing buddies away at camp try some of this on your walleye. The camp cook .....Halfmoon"

As the capers brown, flatten them with a spatula....remove from heat. In a bowl add: 1 1/2 cups of Mayo 1 1/2 t ""Bragg"" Liquiod Aminos all purpose seasoning 1 t spicy brown mustard 1 t wasabi sauce (find near the mustard in the store) pepper to taste Add reserved caper juice to bring the mayo to a tartar sauce like consistency Mix well and enjoy. This is also a great salad dressing for grilled Romaine lettuce halves with roasted grape tomatoes."
