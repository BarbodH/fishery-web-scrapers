It really only rained one day, Tuesday but we went out about noon. The big fish of the week was caught by my son-inlaw. We were crappie fishing in our favorite spot. He was using an ultra-lite with 6 lb. test. All of a sudden he set the hook and his pole bent to the water. I thought he had hooked a good sized Northern but after alittle coaching to the youngster not to ""horse it"" I saw it was a BIG walleye. We did a quick weigh & measure at almost 31"" and 10.4 lbs. on my digital scale. We quickly took a few pics and released it. It flipped it's tail and headed straight for the bottom. Later on in the week at the same spot he caught a 23"" 5 1/2 lb. walleye while crappie fishing again. My nephew caught a 36 in. Northern that weighed 13.3 lbs. which we released also. We brought home limits of slot walleye and crappie & a few pike that were eating size. My nephew had never been to Canada before and really had a good time. The walleye were mainly at 30 to 35' on reefs and island points. The crappie were at around 16'. To top things off Matt Rydberg & his fishing partner Brian took 2nd in the KBI out of Kenora. Matt & his mom run Crawford Camp in Sioux Narrows. The other bonus was we stopped at Big Bear Casino on the way home Friday. Spent the night in Moose Lake to cut some time off a normally 13 hr. drive on Saturday. I put $10 in a ""HotShots"" penny slot and hit a bonus round for $491 which was a nice little win. All in all it was one of our better trips. Hope you all had good trips also."
