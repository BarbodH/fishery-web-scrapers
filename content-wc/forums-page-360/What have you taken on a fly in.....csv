Have you taken something that absolutely makes your trip?One thing we started taking is a battery powered portable bilge. It's round about the size of a med coffee can, hose wraps around it. 2 D cell batteries and it bilges the boats out really fast. It can take forever to bail those things out after a good rain. Or, when backtrolling and the splashing. Other option is to take the plug out and go full speed but something always makes me nervous about taking the plug out of the boat.So, what is the item you started taking that changed your trip."

Slickest thing I ever done. Just carry the can down to the boat, open both and stick the hose in and shake a few times. Fills them up fast but just remember which end to pull out first when they are full. No mess at all. Hey I didn't leave it there. It will be on all the trips now. I don't consider myself dump but maybe a slow learner, it only took 20 yrs for me to this. Best thing I ever came up with."

2040073,Carnhzkr,2013-08-19 10:10:00,964,"Olejoe, I know exactly what you mean. Went to Camp Narrows on Rainy Lake this summer and the camp owner used one of those shaker syphon hoses with a one-way valve you put in your gas can. I'd never seen one of those before, but it worked great. I need to find one on Amazon to give to my 84 year old dad. He still makes a couple Canadian trips each year and refules his boat with 5 gallon gas cans."
