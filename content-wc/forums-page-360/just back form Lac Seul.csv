2034474,Red legs,2013-08-16 15:14:00,27,"I rig main line with a snap swivel then attach the three way swivel with a leader four inches long with a snap swivel for attachment to leader loop. This cuts down on line twist. The dropper for weight was six to ten inches again with snap swivel for attachment to the weight eye. This makes for super fast color, length and weight changes as drift conditions change. I carry weight from 1/16 to 2 ounces. I prefer Lindy weights because tend to snag less in rock and wood. All rigs are pre- tied with loops for attachment."

2018178,Red legs,2013-08-09 14:44:00,27,"Just returned from Lac Seul, Chamberlin Narrows trip 7/26-8/2.. Fishing was great despite four cold fronts, with biggest walleye 30.5 inches and too many over 25 to count. Had three in our boat and averaged 100-125 fish per day. Fish were deep 25-35 feet. Smaller fish were related to weeds and rock. We estimate each of us caught 50 fish 25 inches or over. Bigger fish were on transition zones from deep rock to sand. Used leech rigs exclusively with 1/2- 3/4 oz dropper and 24 inch leader on a modified wolf river rig with floating (phelps type) jig. Water was at 60-65 degrees ( ten degrees below norm for this week historically) and lake level 70-75th percentile, winds were moderate 10-20 mph ,air temps range 65-40 degrees and we had popcorn showers every day. Bugs were minimal. We do a house boat trip out of Hudson using Sioux Lookout Floating Lodges. This was 30th year for some members but 24th for me. I would highly recommend them to anyone.We did very little pike/ muskie fishing due to excellent big walleye bite. House boat trips are hard to beat!!! The LAC is definitely on the upswing as universal comments from all locals/outfitters is that the average size of the fish is up this year. Don't know if this is due to late ice out or is correlated to positive aspects of slot limits. I tend to think latter as fish were just moving into summer pattern this particular week and it took us two days to find them."
2018210,tv4fish,2013-08-09 14:55:00,2694,Sounds like another great trip up on Lac Seul.
2018234,Limeyangler,2013-08-09 15:24:00,563,"I'd have to agree with the statement that the bigger fish seem more abundant this year, only been out twice this year, but each trip has produced 30""ers!"
2018322,2746,2013-08-09 17:13:00,3206,"""We estimated each of us caught 50 fish over 25 inches"" Red legs, I'm not making fun and believe what your saying but it reminded me of our recent trip to Gullrock and a conversation we all laughed at. We had been golfing one day (a tradition we have) and one of our group said "" isn't it strange that when I remember how many strokes I took the number shrinks, when I remember the number of fish I caught the number grows"""
2018665,Red legs,2013-08-09 22:47:00,27,I don't golf. Just catch big fish. The bite was phenomenal.
2019705,2746,2013-08-10 16:01:00,3206,"We go there often and yes, the fishing can be great. Even there we take an afternoon and go to Ear Falls to play a round.....like I said, it's a tradition."
2019857,Wall-i-Lama,2013-08-10 18:38:00,1524,"Red Legs, Congrats on a great trip. We had a good year at LOTW, but nothing like 150 walleye over 25"". I sure that will be a trip to remember!"
2020370,SinOrSwim,2013-08-11 06:45:00,1528,Nice fish Red. Great report. Counting the days as we will be headed up the first week of Sept.
2032850,Iowa Hawkeye,2013-08-16 06:51:00,90,"We go to the same area, and thought his numbers were on the low side. Can't beat the house boats, stay where the fish are."
2033026,1jigfish2,2013-08-16 07:49:00,110,"Red Legs, great fishing trip, I am curious about your modified wolf river rig. I fish the wolf and am familiar with it. What changes do you make? I am always interested in learning new rigs, please let us know or pm me. I am heading up to Cedar in 4 weeks, I would like to give it a try. I did try the drop rig this spring, too many bites on the weight, instead of the hook. Thank you"
