2022402,Carnhzkr,2013-08-12 09:25:00,964,"Just returned from a very enjoyable week. I've probably made at least 45 fishing trips to Canada, going back to the mid-60s when I was just a boy, but this one ranks as my favorite. I say that for a variety of reasons. The fishing was great, but this was also a father-son trip with my 15 year old. We went through LSL and stayed at their small outpost on Sunlight lake. I really enjoyed the solitude, being the only humans within a five mile radius. I'd yell and hear my echo bouncing back and know that no one else could hear me.We made the 30 minute trip through the river system, out to the main lake every day. Our hotspots were the twin islands south of Manitoba Point (very popular spot and always produced), Stony Point, and the reefs in that general area. The big fish were feeding the frist two days. Nearly every eye was over 20"", with the average probably around 22"". My son caught a couple of 27s that first day, those held up as our biggest for the trip. We had similar luck the second day with a couple of 26s and about a 22"" average. Then rain came in and the big fish stopped feeding. We continued to catch fish at about the same pace, but the average dropped to about 18"". We'd catch an occasional 24 - 25, but 18 was about the norm. Funny how the big girls were hungry for two days, then the smaller ones took over.We mostly pulled bottom-bouncers with spinners and crawlers or minnows. For the most part there wasn't much difference between the two, but one day, crawlers seemed to have the upper hand, and on another, minnows outfished the worms. Maybe just luck of the draw, but both presentations worked.We went north to Ghost Narrows one day, but caught only smaller fish, then further north to McKenzie one day, but except for one nice 25"", caught smaller fish. The Big Sand Bank didn't produce that day, and there were lots of boats on the reef in the middle of the bay. We joined them and caught a few small ones. After a half dozen northern snip offs, we headed back south. Wished we'd stayed in our usual areas, but I wanted to see what all the fuss about McKenzie and the Sand Banks was all about. I've reserved the cabin for the same week next year. I hope I'm able to put together another father-son, or maybe find a couple of buddies. Either way, I'll try to make it happen again."

2023570,South Dakota,2013-08-12 15:25:00,24,What depth worked best for you? Thx
2025082,Carnhzkr,2013-08-13 08:19:00,964,"We caught fish from 14 - 44 feet, but they seemed to be concentrated at the lower ends of ridges, around 30 - 34. Around the islands, we fished in the 20 - 32 range, since this has a gradual drop off, but I had a lot of fun fishing the reefs. The upper plateau would be around 20, and we'd catch fish on the top, but I could just about bet that one of us would get a hit when every time we pulled our presentation down the drop off and hit the lower shelf which was at about 30 - 32. Several days it was quite windy, which made fishing the reefs difficult. I'd mark the high point on the reef, maybe 15 feet, then run the length of the upper plateau and drift with the wind/waves. We'd usually pick up one or two along the upper part of the reef, then watch for when we'd go over the ledge. We'd get a hit almost every time our spinner hit 32ish."

2038434,Riceburner,2013-08-18 17:28:00,436,Was that you in the red boat coming out of Altimer creek each day that week? Pls contact me at [email protected]
2038674,Carnhzkr,2013-08-18 19:18:00,964,That must have been us. We were in a red Lund Outfitter and we ran through Altimeter every day but that first Saturday.
2038802,Guest,2013-08-18 20:07:00,0,"We just got back ourselves and can tell you that our results were very similar. We fished the drops off Windigo and the same islands you mentioned and we caught a ton of fish. Many mid 22-27's with very few dinks. Best depth for us was 25-35 ft using a jig and the biggest minnows we could find. We pulled in over 70 fish one day and 50+ the others. Mckenzie produced fish for us as well but we caught mostly smaller fish. Needless to say, we spent the majority of our week in the Windigo area. The water in that area appeared cleaner than other parts of the lake. All I can say-- what a great fishery."
