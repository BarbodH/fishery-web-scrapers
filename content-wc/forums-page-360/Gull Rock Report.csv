2031378,pattmit,2013-08-15 14:38:00,36,Just 4 weeks until we head up to Gull Rock. Wanted to see if anyone has just gotten back from any trips recently or any current fishing reports.The days can't go fast enough at this point.

2031578,jkwildhunting,2013-08-15 15:50:00,361,I heard that there was a huge fish kill in the last few weeks up there. Some rumors are stating not even worth driving up might well stay at home... On a more serious note.....Pezman pretty much summed it up. Minnows and leeches are working best. The lake just got done with a bad month of mayflys. Fish will be in summer locations. Jig and Minnow in deeper spots will probably produce best.Ill be up a week after the tourny. May enter that some year.

2034642,jkwildhunting,2013-08-16 15:59:00,361,"Yup I got a few close buddies who fish the tourny every year. You pretty much HAVE to send your form in by the opening date as you have to get on the waiting list early, and if I heard it right the previous anglers of the tournament the year before already have a spot in the tournament if they want it Still have to build up my courage to come up would have to fish Red Lake more before I sign up and learn some key spots, as all my fishing is done on Gull."
