2039177,bluegussler,2013-08-19 05:50:00,124,I would suggest Kupper's restaurant and bakery downtown. Good food and bakery! a little tough to park though
2042498,muskyroller,2013-08-20 09:43:00,56,"Just eat at McDonald's and park in the back. Simple, quick, and painless. Then, move on and fish!"
2042514,Carnhzkr,2013-08-20 09:53:00,964,"What about Tim Horton's? I've never eaten at one, but heard they're good. From their website, it looks like their menu is geared more toward breakfast and lunch."
2042666,bigwalleye1,2013-08-20 11:15:00,2632,Don't try to get into that lot with a boat. Park at Wally World across the street and walk.
2027866,Guest,2013-08-14 09:57:00,0,Looking for a good spot to eat lunch in Dryden. Need plenty of parking for boats etc.
2027962,v-bay gord,2013-08-14 10:23:00,3168,Try the Patricia Inn........just across the hwy from mcdonalds.

2029506,Skywagon,2013-08-14 19:15:00,1106,"Riverview Lodge, go south 2-3 blocks at the stop light on the east side of the mill dam (Fas Gas is on the N/E corner at the light). It is an original log building, good food, drinks available if you want. Should be plenty of room for boats, park on the north side of the parking lot. Prices will be slightly higher than Patricia Inn, but it's is not a greasy spoon, it would be my preference of the two. Not a lot of options for multiple boat parking in town if you don't know your way around."
2029682,CI_Guy,2013-08-14 20:19:00,2118,We will have to try Riverview Lodge next year. We've tried 3 places the last 3 years and haven't hit a winner yet. Patricia Inn had the worst service and possibly the worst food I've ever had at a full service restaurant!
2029954,JAMOKIN,2013-08-14 21:55:00,48,The Lodge gets my vote.Food is allways good.It doesnt get any better in Dryden.5 star in my books.
2030338,tv4fish,2013-08-15 07:03:00,2694,"I'm going to have to agree with this post. FWIW: Years ago -- the Patricia Inn DID have some additional ""amenities""............"
2032938,nitrodude,2013-08-16 07:25:00,60,"Yeah, the suppers were worth it at one time. Now, I'd sooner eat at A&W than stop at the Patricia. Not worth it. IMHO"
2033050,Limeyangler,2013-08-16 07:50:00,563,If ya wanted to try something a bit different there is also Masalas on Duke street. East Indian and greek food....pretty good too!
2036682,115 optimax,2013-08-17 16:55:00,650,"The ""amenities"" are back."
