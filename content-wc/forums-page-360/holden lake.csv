1903258,Guest,2013-06-27 15:50:00,0,Has anyone fished lake Holden on the Ottawa River. What is your opinion of the area?

We took a quick look at the area on a recent trip to Lady Evelyn, another four hours further. The cabins are housekeeping and therefore more reasonably priced than all inclusive. The fast water below the Dam looks like a good fishery and the Ottawa has many species. Years ago, I fished the river at Westmeath and caught walleye, smallmouth, channel cats and pike. I hope 387loup will post a report after their trip."
1911610,mickr,2013-07-01 07:19:00,74,I'm interested in the response to this as well. Never fished Holden Lake but I have heard the fishing there is better than below the dam. Fishing below the dam has gone downhill in the last few years.
2037258,387loup,2013-08-18 06:12:00,12,"Just returned from Holden Lake Lodge. Cabins are new, nice and clean. Dock for each cabin is located on the lake above the dams, very convenient . Water in cabin is not drinkable. Only one electrical outlet in each cabin, make sure you bring a power strip and bottled water.Fishing in the lake was challenging. Our party of 8 did catch a few walleye, bass and pike but all were on the small side. I guess you just have to put in your time to learn new water. Little fishing pressure on the lake. We also fished the Ottawa River below the dam. The lodge has a convenient dock with boats docked there. This dock is located about 15 minutes from the lodge. We found better fishing there catching mostly small 12 "" walleye but many 4 - 5 pound small mouth bass. A few of the walleye were in the 18 inch range, but they were few.All of the locals said the fishing was slow during the week we were there. Speaking with people who fished there for years they claimed the river was a great fishery, lots of walleyes in the past. Supposedly 4 years ago there was a great walleye hatch. Those 12"" walleyes should be grown up over the next 2 years. Mid May to mid June seems to be the best time to fish this water."
2038194,Guest,2013-08-18 15:53:00,0,"Thanks for the report 387. I agree, it's sometimes tough finding fish in a new area. The Ottawa River has many species in it but finding the spots can be difficult. Our group is considering Holden because its a much easier drive but that does not often translate to better fishing. We are fishing a lake in a few weeks in southeastern Ontario that has produced many good walleye trips in the past. I'll post a report."
2038290,387loup,2013-08-18 16:40:00,12,"Ronfish,The guy in the cabin next to us said fishing in the lake was better than most other years. He suggested fishing a depth of 30 ft where the fish finder marked fish. Was using jigs and chartreuse twisters tipped with minnow, leech or worm. Saw him fillet a 20 "" walleye one night. He only fished nightly between 6:45 PM - 8 PM. Good luck to you"
2040809,mickr,2013-08-19 14:45:00,74,"I have fished that river a lot below the dam. It can be hit and miss but for the most part if you know what you are doing you will catch fish for sure. In my experience Was using jigs and chartreuse twisters tipped with minnow, leech or worm. it doesn't matter what those bolded words are, they are part of the problem. jig and a minnow, leech or worm. Add something else, make sure you have lots of steak back at the cabin."
