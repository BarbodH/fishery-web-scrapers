6745063,10point,2023-06-18 12:03:00,102,Looking for advice. I'm staying in vermilion bay. Last year was first time here and we did good but it was two weeks earlier. This year lake is lower and it's all different. Have been mostly bottom bouncing in about 10 to 20 ft of water. Last year we could get them casting shallow.
