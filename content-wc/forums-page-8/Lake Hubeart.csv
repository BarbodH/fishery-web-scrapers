Willing to fly commercially? How many people? Many outfitters work with groups of 4 to 8, but some do 1-2 and 10+. When you plan on going. What type of fish you are targeting. Trophy fishing vs. more numbers. Good fishing depends on the the target. Personally, I like chasing trophy pike so 100 walleyes/day doesn't always interest me. Outpost only? Lodge? Only camp on the lake? As of right now, I believe access to that part of Quebec is closed due to forest fire hazards. That can change at any time though."
