6745153,ILScott,2023-06-19 05:32:00,139,Some of the best fishing I have had is during a mayfly hatch. Even last week on Wine Lake some of the lakes had mayfly's on the water. My go to is a bottom bouncer with a size 2 gold hammered colorado blade with a size 1 slow death hook tipped with a little bit of a worm. Went through a half a flat of worms between two of us. We even jigged with a little bit of a worm and caught them. I make my own spinner rigs with Fireline and they are a little over 3 feet long.
6745193,tv4fish,2023-06-19 07:42:00,2694,"I will agree with the previous post. If you hit the EARLY start of the mayfly hatch - the fish are much more active and they will hit almost anything that resembles a mayfly moving in the water. After a day or 2, the walleyes have eaten well and then it slows the bite considerably and they are then much harder to get them to hit any bait."
6745253,Lost Dogger,2023-06-19 13:14:00,4,"Fished Lady Evelyn, Northeast Ontario, in 2022 during the last week of June. The hatch was on. We used a small black jig and a half crawler rigged perfectly straight and let it sit on bottom with a taunt line. The walleyes would suck it up at the evening honey holes. Tried minnows and plastics at the same time and location and the black jig, crawler out fished the other presentations 10-1."
6744899,Pooch,2023-06-17 07:37:00,4618,"Mayflies were mentioned in another post so I thought I would jump in. Especially since it's about that time of year. Last year in late June Bobo filled in for my wife on our annual trip to LSL, We hit the Mayfly hatch dead on. Fishing was tough to dead. Worst trip fishing wise I've ever encountered. Boats were covered in Mayflies every morning and water looked like it had a blanket on it. Depth finder was just black with fish feeding on the hatch and catching anything was not going to happen. We eventually started making long runs to get away from sand/mud and did fairly well, but when not away from soft bottom and fishing a more ""shield"" like area we caught very few fish. Like John eluded to in the fake vs live thread, for us, most fish in soft bottom areas came really close to shore in very shallow water. A few humps in McKenzie kept us interested, but we worked our butts off scrounging for just a few fish. I even tried a method that Skywagon mentioned years ago. He offered using a small tan jig and leech. Mimicking (sort of) a Mayfly. That didn't work this time. Mayflies are seldom a (big) problem when fishing other lakes that have mostly rock. So how do others fish a Mayfly hatch? Pooch"
6744901,Riding high,2023-06-17 08:08:00,69,"What works for us is usually fishing the mud where they're hatching from with small white twisters with 1/16 to 1/8 white jig. Our best day was fishing the wind sweept reeds. Casting them and don't let it sink, reel it almost across the top of the water. I could hear the walleye in the reeds feeding on the mayflies. I have never caught so many walleyes in one spot in my life. We have also pulled little white spinners in the mud before and had good results. I guess for us it's small and white."
6744937,MN_Moose,2023-06-17 13:28:00,964,Small mayflies were a nuisance a couple days but I don't think it affected fishing. The worst day of mayflies was best day for smallmouth bass. The biting flies is another story. My leg was covered in so much blood it looked like a murder scene.
6744955,pjshorthorn,2023-06-17 19:30:00,5654,Many years ago we hit the hatch on the east end of LS. Fishing was pretty slow ..using all the normal bait methods. After dinner one evening my uncle pulled out his fly tying gear that he brought along just for grins ( mostly to show my young son). He tied up a couple dozen in a mayfly patten in various sizes. The next morning we tried them out jigging the flies via a Carolina rig style. It increased our catch rate quite a bit for the rest of the trip. I still have a few of those flies from almost 25 years ago .so does my son. Don't know that either of us will ever fish them again can't get them anymore. PjShorthorn
6744965,prov1800,2023-06-17 20:01:00,5010,I tie some hair jigs in brown on 1/16 oz jig head and tiny piece of worn.Jig about floats and goes down real slow.works great.
6744999,Bill Krejca,2023-06-18 06:18:00,6107,"I think maybe success during the hatch may just be a case of placing the lure in the same place as the fish are - if they are near surface, a bait which generally stays on the retrieve higher up pus them in the same area as where the fish are. Years ago, I had some success with a fly rod and a floating dry fly, even got a bullhead on one during a hatch. My druthers are not to have to be on the water during the hatch time, however, otherers' mileage may vary. Bill"
6745017,kona77,2023-06-18 07:32:00,236,"We have been on two trips where the mayflies were hatching. We knew we may run into them based on the timing of the trips (end of June) and thought we were prepared. Had crawlers, small hair jigs/flies, small floating hard baits etc. On one trip the hatch started in the middle of our trip and we had some great fishing for a couple of days but then slowed down considerably. The hatch had started just before our 2nd trip and it was a challenging bite. Yes, we caught fish on all the methods I mentioned but we knew this lake well and the fishing was considerably slower than past trips. I still remember seeing fish coming to the surface and just spitting out tons of mayflies and there bellies were round and tight as a drum with mayflies. Even the northern's were feeding heavily on the mayflies and I remember wind blown shorelines just full of mayfly husks. Bottom line for our group is we try to avoid the end of June/early July trips. Yes you can catch fish and even have some great fishing at the start of a mayfly hatch, but fishing is certainly more challenging (and frustrating at times)."
6745023,reddemon2,2023-06-18 08:06:00,255,I know the bullfrog hatch was monsterous last week in MB
6745101,prov1800,2023-06-18 16:52:00,5010,Some mayfly hatching on Cedar today in some areas.Just happened maybe yesterday overnight as yesterday didn't see any bodies but did today.Still burned through 10 doz minnows and went back to clarks and got some more.Off lake at 2:30 and did a shorelunch on the cabin deck.
6745139,PRO-V16,2023-06-18 22:07:00,454,"I got hit with a big hatch on Winnibigoshish. Was doing very poorly and noticed when reeling a pod of walleye chasing it but I was already out of the water. Switched to a spinner and bottom bouncer, ran it about 12' below the boat and filled out rather quickly. I was in 25' or so."
