6744957,dosxx,2023-06-17 19:33:00,60,"I just got back from the Chapleau area for a three day four night trip.We stayed at Chapleau Lodge on Borden Lake.First, about the lodge. The cabin we stayed at was excellent with all the creature comforts. It was just my 80 plus year old father in law and I in a cabin for six so we had lots of room. The kitchen was great and well stocked, everything was clean and in good working order and for those of you that want it, there is even Wi-Fi in the cabin as well as 24 hour electricity. The floating docks were well kept with a power station at each cabin dock. My 16.5 boat fit nicely and was in a sheltered bay. The host, John, was excellent. He checked us in, went through the cabin amenities, helped me launch my boat, and he was also very helpful with an alternative date when we thought a family emergency might derail our plan— it didn’t but it was nice to have options.Now for the fishing. First of all it was cold and raining (mid forties), then cold and windy the one day we fished Borden. This was after a stretch of warm weather. I have fished it twice in the past on other trips and found some smallmouth but never a walleye. Our experience was similar the one day we fished it— we got maybe six smallmouth in the morning (we didn’t target walleye) and in the evening we got two walleye. One went on a stringer which I forgot to close the clip on and lost the whole stringer with the fish and the other I knocked off my father in law’s line at the boat. No walleye dinner. The next day was so cold that I let FIL sleep in and we went to breakfast and just drove around in the truck. My original plan was to fish Borden one day, then Nagassin/Highbrush and Sideburned a day and then another lake to the north. Unfortunately my plans were dashed because the road washed out at Highbrush and that cut off our access point unless I was willing to haul my boat down many miles of rough back roads that I’m unfamiliar with to get around the closure. We spent some time following a local man’s directions to another access point kind of on the south side of the lake and we found it while driving around but it looked very private and no one was around so I couldn’t ask permission and it was a no go.We stopped at a smaller lake near Borden that I saw on the map and that clearly had an access point and we came back with the boat and launched at around 5:30 pm. We fished a spot that looked good on the graph and 5 minutes in my FIL had a smaller walleye on and he lost it at the boat. I thought we were really on to something. Two hours later I caught the next and last fish— a little hammer handle northern. The wind was bitter and cold and we wrapped it up at 800 pm.The next day the forecast was for sun and in the sixties, a huge change. It was cold early on so we hit the Dominion in Chapleau again for breakfast and headed to a lake we had been to before and were pretty familiar with. We were blessed with a gorgeous day, light winds and the smallmouth action was absolutely fantastic. The lake we were on definitely has walleye and we gave them a bit of a try but it’s hard to leave fish to find fish so we spent almost the entire time, 900 am to 2 pm, catching bass. We had a ball. I think Borden has potential. Some other guys staying there had some great smallmouth action on the sunny day and there were plenty of walleye in the fish cleaning bucket so I know they are in there. I think you need to know the lake a bit (a hot spot map is provided by the way), get some weather that doesn’t make you wish you had your ice fishing gear, and probably fish it more than a few hours in the evening to have any success. My father in law and I have done several trips in the area, the fishing some years way better than others (the weather too), but we always have had a lot of fun. Unfortunately the years have caught up and this may be our last trip due to health and some safety issues, so I’m glad we had a strong finish with the weather and the fish.I’m looking forward to my next trip with some friends with Twin Lakes Outfitters in Nakina near the end of August!"

6745005,kzoofisher,2023-06-18 06:27:00,5144,"Glad you had a good trip and great Father's Day post. I like the Chapleau area, it's significantly closer than Nakina or west of Superior, has more lakes with a mix of smallmouth and walleye until you get way west and still has all of that Canada feel. But for some reason the numbers aren't there like Nakina and west. It's not like the lakes are super crowded and over fished, they just aren't fish factories. If your focus is more the Canada experience and less pure numbers I don't think you can beat it."
6745051,Golden Eagle,2023-06-18 10:45:00,2642,"In 1960 my wife and I, plus another couple, fished & camped in the Chapleau area. We were in a 1959 cherry red Austin Healey Sprite. The other couple were in their 1959 BRG Austin Healey Sprite. My wife and I subrented out our $50 a month tiny house and we spent 49 days & nights away from home, sleeping on the ground all but 2 nights. One night was spent in the home of Harry Birch, commercial fisherman in Desbarats, Ontario and a second night was spent in the wood shed of Fred Gjos in Desbarats. We made several trips to the Chapleau area until we began doing fly ins from Red Lake, Ontario in 1972. The 49 days in 1960 weren't exactly easy, but our marriage lasted until we lost our battle to endemetrial cancer in September 2017."

6745125,dosxx,2023-06-18 18:56:00,60,We are headed to Tennant Lake. It is our first time at that particular one and we are really looking forward to it because it has been several years since we have done a fly in.
6745269,Wawajake,2023-06-19 16:20:00,413,Desbarats is 5 miles away ( as the crow flies) from my homestead. Desbarats now has a great Boat sales place that sells Legend Boats located right on the highway in Desbarats. ( Looney Tunes Pontoons) Thats where I bought my fishing boat 2 years ago. Many of the farms around Desbarats have been bought up by Amish farmers ( no electricity just horses etc) Just thought you would like an update on that community.
