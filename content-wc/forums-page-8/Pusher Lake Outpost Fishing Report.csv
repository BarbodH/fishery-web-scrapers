Went through a lot of firewood keeping the cabin warm at night. No issues with bugs. Cabin is small but functional. It has 2 bedrooms with one set of bunk beds in each. Comfortable for only two adults or two adults with kids. Boats were 14' and water tight. Had one motor problem next to the cabin when it wouldn't go into forward or reverse. Luckily we could paddle back to the dock and use a second boat as there were 3 boats and motors ready to go on the skids. Check plane pilot took the motor back to get repaired. Clark's pilots and dock workers were courteous and professional. We had two camp checks. Ended up not needing the ice or minnows the pilots had for us as there were only two of us using initial 2 bags of ice, and we caught fish easily on jigs and paddle tails or twister tails. The lake is fairly small and stained. We trolled the entire lake the first day to discover where the fish were. Lots of yellow reeds from last year surrounding most of the lake, and bottom was mostly mud with a few rocky areas. Nice stained walleye water, with water temperatures varying from 54 to 57 degrees most of the week, and then reaching over 60 degrees on our last day. Fishing was easy for walleyes and the many small pike. We also caught a half dozen perch, and nice ones at that. Fish were all in 5-7 feet of water so trolling with original floating Rapalas worked best for covering water. We spent most of our time with 1/8 or 3/16 oz. jigs. We mostly used plastic trailers while drifting. Colors didn't matter as the walleyes were super aggressive. We also spent some time anchored on the last two days and caught plenty in hotspots doing this as well. We must've caught 800+ fish altogether. Average size walleye was probably 17 inches after accounting for the smaller ones. One cove in particular was filled with 19 walleyes. We fished this cove extensively on the second day. My buddy Dave stated Aren't there any small walleyes in this lake? while fishing this cove that day. What a problem to have! We must've caught 50 walleyes that day from that cove, with most being 19 and a few 20-21. We also did an experiment with Dave using plastics and I using a minnow at the same time to see if it made any difference. It didn't, as we caught equal numbers of fish on each. The walleyes were plump and feisty. Numerous times we saw where the walleyes had chased minnows up to the surface and bodies/tails roiled the surface. Casting into these roils almost always produced a walleye. Fishing off the dock was also exceptional. You could either cast or just drop the jig over the side of the dock. Lastly, we had a moose one morning prancing through the shallow water of the small bay by the cabin. The moose would run one direction, stop, and run another direction, then back several times. First time I've witnessed a playful moose. All in all a great trip!"

Just like you the fishing was excellent ,but due to the winds and rain we were only able to fish for 2 to 3 hours then had to come in to dry off and warm up . I wrote a report for last year on this site Just got back from a trip, June 2 to June10 to Okanse lake with my sister. We has agreat time I will post a report directly Larry Schroeder"
6744959,wdkott,2023-06-17 19:37:00,26,"Yes, it is possible to go to Upper Wapesi as group from there came into Pusher. But Beaver Dam close to Upper Wapesi makes it so you have to get out of the boat. Fishing was so good on Pusher that there was no need to change lakes."
