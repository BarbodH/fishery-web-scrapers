6745415,Yellowfin123,2023-06-20 10:33:00,2182,if thats the case I'd be crackin the whip on that house!!
6744903,troutwater,2023-06-17 08:23:00,299,"Argh guess I should have seen that from your original post, sorry about that. If you don't mind fighting the boat traffic(and it could a lot) I'd go with Cedar personally. Hattfield Bay is really good early on with great weeds."
6744967,lunker99,2023-06-17 20:02:00,236,Thanks for the advice everyone. We'll see how this week goes on Lac Seul and decide at the end of the week if we're ready to try something different.
6744973,prov1800,2023-06-17 21:03:00,5010,You on east end or west end
6744991,lunker99,2023-06-18 05:33:00,236,West up around Ear Falls
6745161,nitroman,2023-06-19 06:01:00,368,Just got back from an amazing week on Cedar. Full week of walleye and many days/times of walleye on every cast. Our group agreed we had some of the best fishing days ever. But please continue to drive by and leave them to us.
6745175,Lmbkiller,2023-06-19 06:32:00,639,Of course I will. U and everyone else should should just continue to have your amazing fishing on that lk. I'm glad it always works out for everyone that goes there
6745281,Bill Krejca,2023-06-19 18:23:00,6107,"Good to hear, will be up in Sep. Bill"
6745287,prov1800,2023-06-19 19:03:00,5010,Was on Cedar yesterday.Your right it's on fire.Some Mayflies showing up.
6745323,pjshorthorn,2023-06-20 04:39:00,5654,Is your trip in Sept on Cedar. I might be on Cedar the week of 9/6 as long as my house is done being built. Would be great meeting you if timing /location worked out. PjShorthorn
6745347,Bill Krejca,2023-06-20 06:41:00,6107,"Wow, that would be great! I am going up a little later, tho, will be staying at Cedar Point Resort on Cedar starting Sep. 23. Hoping to finally have a face-to-face with John, and a renewal with Nitroman, meeting up with you would be cool, perhaps you could change your timing? Bill."
6744661,lunker99,2023-06-15 14:42:00,236,"Will be fishing Lac Seul next week. Our camp week ends on Friday so thought about using a public launch to fish one of these lakes on the way home. If you were choosing one for a day trip, which would you pick?"
6744667,Spurgery,2023-06-15 15:28:00,79,Prov1800 will answer this one for you quite accurately as he fishes both ALOT!
6744677,prov1800,2023-06-15 17:07:00,5010,Both good if you know them.Cliff very clear with trout also and tough to get walleye.and Cedar bit stained and easier to fish.
6744713,lunker99,2023-06-15 21:34:00,236,Thanks for the quick response. Are there Musky in both? Not necessarily my interest but the guy travelling with me would be interested in them.
6744715,prov1800,2023-06-15 21:38:00,5010,Both have muskies.
6744719,Lmbkiller,2023-06-15 23:01:00,639,"In the grand scheme that is Ontario both these lakes are extremely low on my list of lakes to fish, because there are loads of lakes much better with much less people"
6744725,prov1800,2023-06-16 04:25:00,5010,Most drive ins can have a fair amount of people on it.Cedar does have 5 camps on it but lake is spread out pretty good so pretty easy to fish without much traffic around you.Cliff is about the less fished lake around.Only one camp and hardly see any boats out on it.Every lake in my area does get fisherman as it's a tourist area so not much a guy can do about it.Not going to drive to the end of the road when I can fish for any species within 15 min of my house.Farthest I go is 45 min.Puts me in Lac Suel.Can be busy there to but it's 110 mi long so easy to fish alone.Busy or not the fishing is fantastic.
6744855,troutwater,2023-06-16 20:27:00,299,"I've done week long muskie trips to both in the past. I like both lakes, but Cliff is more the numbers lake and Cedar more the trophy lake....which is kind of opposite of how it normally is for clear vs stained water. Cedar does have a lot of boat traffic while Cliff does not. Cliff is also a pretty poor lake for pike if that matters. The west arm of Cedar is actually pretty clear, but still lots of good weed beds and bays that are available to fish. Cliff is deeper with less weeds, but you can find them still. That said I caught one of my heaviest muskie on Cliff back in 14' casting to 50 foot of water off of Gull Rock. What time of year are you going?"
6744869,lunker99,2023-06-17 04:14:00,236,"This week, thanks for the tips!"
6744887,prov1800,2023-06-17 06:23:00,5010,Have been on both lakes a few times already since ice out.Best tactic so far has been a jig and minnow and bass crank baits.They are really active and iam thinking it's going to be a great muskie opener.
