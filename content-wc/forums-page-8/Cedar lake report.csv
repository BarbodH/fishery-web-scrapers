Outside of one afternoon just outside the east sanctuary, the majority of our fish came from the west side. Our big fish was only 21‚Äù but we boated a fair amount 19-21 inch fish. Most of our eaters and take home fish were 15-16 inches. My group prefers the season opener or the following week so we jumped on an available cabin for the 2024 opener."
