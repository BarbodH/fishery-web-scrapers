6744897,Bakefish,2023-06-17 07:30:00,1077,Gerard has some outstanding perch fishing.
6744927,N_of_Quibell,2023-06-17 12:50:00,151,"My wife and I bought 20 acres of bush N of Quibell some 20 years ago; I usually camp there. However, when I get too itchy, I go over to Blue Lake Provincial Park for a warm shower - I have also camped over there; it's a nice spot - a stone's throw from the Indian chain of lakes. There are probably other camping opportunities in the VB area."
6744929,N_of_Quibell,2023-06-17 12:54:00,151,"Good to know! Some many inviting lakes, so little time."
6745037,Bakefish,2023-06-18 08:53:00,1077,"Let me clarify just a bit. Gerard had great perch fishing back in the 70's when I was there last. Don't know how it is these days, but I know that access was limited for a while, so who knows. Prov1800?"
6744443,2vets,2023-06-14 14:23:00,2,Looking to try a new area. Father and I enjoy basing at a lodge and puttering around in smaller Backcountry/ portage lakes in the area with our 12 foot boat or canoe. Any recommendations on lodges that have an abundance of this style of lakes nearby with an owner that could point us in the right direction?
6744475,prov1800,2023-06-14 17:51:00,5010,Depends on which part of the country your looking at but north of Vermilion bay check out Gold Arrow lodge.they strictly do portage lakes and have boats at all lakes
6744477,prov1800,2023-06-14 17:55:00,5010,Actually it's gold arrow camp
6744479,Baseline,2023-06-14 18:00:00,3207,"Check out Agimac River Outfitters located down a rock road just north of Ignace, Ont. Lots of lakes a short drive away and some are accessible only by short portage. They have boats at some of the larger lakes. Nice cabins and they have a campground too."
6744525,Yellowfin123,2023-06-14 21:09:00,2182,"sounds like for what your looking for would be the lodges in and around the atikokan area, lots of portage and canoe type places in that area of nwo"
6744529,eyemike,2023-06-14 22:19:00,233,Pasha near Jellicoe.Fabulous waters to drive to everyday. Check out his website. It's just what your looking for.
6744793,N_of_Quibell,2023-06-16 10:41:00,151,"That's my style of fishing, but I generally camp so I can't help with lodge suggestions. However, once you've narrowed down a general area, I highly recommend Ontario Fish On-line (google it). It shows lakes, fish species, and access points (not perfect in that respect). To echo PROV1800, north of VB, I have found it not unusual to put in a good bit of effort to access a lake, only to find a Golden Arrow boat cached there."
6744853,prov1800,2023-06-16 19:36:00,5010,Lol.Which lake was it on.
6744859,N_of_Quibell,2023-06-16 21:00:00,151,"If memory serves, I've found them on Moose/Ord Lake (via April Rd), Hogg Lake (via Aerobus Rd), Cliff Lake (via Deer Lake Rd), and probably others I don't recall."
6744875,prov1800,2023-06-17 05:12:00,5010,Since the new logging cut from couple years ago if you keep going past the ord turn off a few more miles the rd now goes to Gerard Lake right beside the road.Really good fishing.
