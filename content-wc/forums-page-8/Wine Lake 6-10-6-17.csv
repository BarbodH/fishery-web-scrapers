6745593,ILScott,2023-06-21 06:41:00,139,Went to Wine Lake the week of June 10th. Great boat ride in and no issues at the portage but the main visual on the way to camp was how low the water was. I stayed in the Ice House and last year the water was right on the deck of the cabin. This year it is probably 7 feet below that. First time staying in this cabin and it is great for 3 or 4 people. When I got out fishing we had our limit in less than 30 minutes. The walleye in my spot for the first day was best at between 12-17 feet. The next 3 days had warm temperatures and very little wind. We still found walleye a little deeper. One day went to Mud lake and with the low temps my son had to pull us through the shallow water to get into the lake. It was a fun adventure and caught many fish since not many people have fished it this year. Another day we went to Turn Around lake and found many walleye drifting a point and saw a massive northern trying to attack a smaller northern. The channel off the main lake was shallow and had to go slow to get in. Next day we headed into Beaver lake and the channel was low so we slowly went into the lake. Once again found walleye all over. We did fish the north end a little but not until the end of the week when the wind started blowing in to shore it started to pick up. We went up to Annishinabi Falls one night but once again it was really shallow to get up there and used shallow run to get up to the falls. As you can see if they don't get rain soon a lot of the places will be to shallow to get into. I think for the first time ever it never rained the whole week and the smoke was not to bad. Just a couple of days you could tell the smoke was blowing in. In our group a 27 and 29 inch trout was caught. A lot of walleye over 20 with the biggest 25.5. Overall another great week at Wine Lake and and a lot of fish caught. Back again June 15 2024.

We didn't even try Mud Lake since Nick said we would have to pull the boat in and they call it Mud Lake for a reason. Nice to hear the trout are still shallow. We are booked next year for June 15-22. Are you booked for next year yet? How were the bugs? I worry about black flies since they really do a number on me. We stayed in Ice House last year. Isn't that a great porch! Did you run into any big pike other than the one you mentioned in Turn Around? I got a 40 incher in May. Thanks for the great report Scott. Fish On! Hooks"
6745617,HeHooksHimself,2023-06-21 07:39:00,725,"Oh, I just noticed that we are booked for the same week next year. It will be great to see you! Hooks"
6745657,ILScott,2023-06-21 08:55:00,139,"Hooks, We are booked the same week. We have the Trout and Ice House next year. The bugs were not bad at all. A lot of walleye caught throughout camp not many northern fisherman. But a couple of people who have gone to Wine for many years saw some of the biggest northerns they have every seen going after walleye. The one thing I missed this year was camp fires. What cabin you in? Scott"
