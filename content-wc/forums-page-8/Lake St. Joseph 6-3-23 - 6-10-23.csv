Falls was very smooth in both directions. We went up on a Friday and crossed in about 5-10 minutes at 1:00 pm . On the return trip we were the 3rd truck in line at 6:15 pm on a Saturday. We went a week earlier than normal this year (3rd week of the season) because two of us had a grandson graduating the following week. Thank you to the regular 3rd week crew for switching with us this year! The weather varied from hot and still early in the week to very windy for a rough ride out on Saturday, but overall was very good. We were only kept off the lake by rain part of one morning and thunder/lightning part of one afternoon. On Friday, the last afternoon of fishing, we saw a helicopter fly back and forth over us. Guys at the cabin smelled smoke and we saw on the Ontario fire website ( https://www.lioapplications.lrc.gov....ewer=FFIM.FFIM ) that two fires had started, one about 4 miles SW of the cabin and the other about 4 miles NE of the cabin. Both were less than an acre and were out in a day or two. Wildlife sightings included a wolf, bear and moose on the way up and bear and moose on the way home. On the lake a caribou and calf were seen swimming across the lake. We also had a bear near the cabin that was scared off after being hit by a rock. A year ago the lake was at record high levels. This year it was as low as I've seen it. I've fished the lake for over 20 years and saw rocks this year that I'd never seen before, including the string of lower unit buster rocks pictured below that stretched out for more than a block. Imagine that string of rocks with the lake level 2-3' higher like normal! It turned out to be a good fishing spot. The new dock with railings on the pivoting section between the permanent section and the floating section was very much appreciated. None of us are getting any younger and the railings are a great addition. The crew was 10 guys this year (the cabin maximum) with 8 veterans and 2 new guys. Obviously they're all great guys and get along well. Everyone pitched in. With fish, steak, ribs, biscuits and gravy, home-smoked bacon, home-made spaghetti and garlic bread we all ate well. Finally, the fishing was fantastic this year. 100 fish per boat used to be the benchmark. This year it became 150. Fish were everywhere we went and were caught in 4-16' on jigs and plastic. Most were caught around 10'. Just for a change my partner and I trolled spoons a couple of times in 6-10' and continued to get a mix of walleyes and northerns. . Largest walleye was 28.75 and largest northern was 40.25. Can't wait until next year!"

6744467,stjoeguy,2023-06-14 17:15:00,979,We fished the windward side of the ridge and got quite a few in 6-8'. The closer to the rocks you pitched the greater the likelihood you'd get a northern rather than a walleye.
6744763,Lovetofish,2023-06-16 08:32:00,458,Thanks for the report. My turn in 3 weeks. Seems like the fishing reports I've been receiving and reading have all reported good fishing.
