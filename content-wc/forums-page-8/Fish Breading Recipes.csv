Very uncomplicated , a little different, can use low sodium for less salt. Nice, for a change, I wouldn't want this every day, tho, lots of good recipes out there using various crumbs. Bill"

6744249,aprowl,2023-06-13 19:44:00,8,Looking for your best breading recipes?
6744253,prov1800,2023-06-13 20:02:00,5010,"There's like hundreds of recipes for breading fish.Homemade ones you can add your favorite tastes to.One we use at home is basically pretty simple but always comes out great and I use it for my shorelunches.Eggs beaten with milk or carnation milk.Wal-Mart Italian seasoned bread crumbs.Can spice up the egg/milk dip.Heat up lard to 375f and use temp gauge or a wooden match for fun.It will light up at 375f.Yes lard.lol.It adds the taste to the fish.Brown both sides,don't over cook.Fish does right should be very flaky."
6744275,btyreprich,2023-06-13 21:17:00,1067,"We use a 3 step process: 1. Fish are dredged in all purpose flower 2. Then the coated fillets are placed in an egg wash ""bath"". Eggs & small amount of milk 3. Last step will have the wet fillets covered in a bread crumb mix. We might add garlic or onion powder to the bread crumbs."
6744283,dschiebel,2023-06-14 02:13:00,85,"The one we have been doing the most, is roll in flour, dip in egg and milk, put the fish in a bag of CRUSHED and SMASHED saltine crackers. Fry in butter flavor crisco . Another is fry fresh fish butter with cut up onions."
6744301,stjoeguy,2023-06-14 05:21:00,979,Instead of flour and egg I dip the filets in a combination of Shore Lunch regular and cajun mixed with water to the consistency of pancake batter. Then roll in Panko bread crumbs. You can vary the regular/cajun ratio for spiciness. I prefer 2 regular to 1 cajun.
6744303,kona77,2023-06-14 05:52:00,236,"I am a big fan of using the egg/milk wash process at home but on our fly-in's we don't have milk so we just use a home made dry/batter recipe. Combination of regular flour, cornmeal and Italian bread crumbs, then add some pepper and cajun seasoning. Roll fresh fillets in coating mixture and into the hot oil. Sprinkle some lemon pepper on after you take the fish out of the oil. Nice light coating that really really enhances the natural flavor of those fresh walleye/pike fillets. Lots of good store bought coatings on the market but most are really high in salt, which is something I try to avoid in my diet (and others in our group)."
6744319,Iceshack05,2023-06-14 06:24:00,31,"When i pan fry fish (oil and butter) I prefer using milk/eggwash then seasoned breadcrumbs. But for deep frying them, I like to use the same milk/eggwash but with cornflakes. I find the fillets stay together better and come out nice and crispy. Also usually do some in beer batter when deep frying. Add in some homemade tarter!"
6744341,10point,2023-06-14 07:23:00,102,My family is a big fan of shore lunch. We like to mix original and cajun.https://www.scheels.com/p/shore-lunc...le_shipping_50
6744371,valley366,2023-06-14 09:59:00,193,We use a pretty simple recipe and never have complaints.Egg/milk wash the fish. Then drop in ziplock bag with 50/50 Corn Flake Crumbs and Flower.Deep fry in 350 degree oil until golden.Tried other methods but keep going back to the basics.
6744617,a_hershy,2023-06-15 11:10:00,36,Some in our group have used crushed up pork rinds as a breading substitute to stay within their diet needs...pick your flavor
