6745443,Web,2023-06-20 13:28:00,7,"I have been fishing in Northwest Ontario for 45 years.. basically only have ever missed just these last few covid years.. other than that i have been there at the same couple of lakes for that time period every year. I would have to say that 2023 for us was on the exceptional side.. Of course it is Northwest Ontario, so pretty much every year is exceptional; but this was certainly one of the top years that i can remember.. Likely not the best.. but top 10 for sure. And our weather for week 3 was pretty crazy.. Way too hot a couple of days.. rain and cold a couple of days and then back to hot, with tons of bugs.. None of it mattered.. fish were hitting hard the entire time. Lots of walleyes, very nice size.. Best big pike year in many.. several over 40"". Reasons.. Well the lighter pressure certainly has helped.. Fewer people keeping trophy sized fish.. certainly could be helping as well. At any rate, truly an awesome year in 2023..Web"

And there's still plenty of time to start getting the 혩da** mayflies' posts, the 혩hot and calm for six straight days' posts and the 혩wind never quit' posts. Overall though it does sound like numbers and sizes are up a bit. Anyone else getting that impression?"
6745177,adempsey2.0,2023-06-19 06:33:00,611,I think the heat wave at the end of May probably contributed in some areas.
6745189,kzoofisher,2023-06-19 07:26:00,5144,I wondered about that. Maybe the warmer water drove up the walleyes metabolism while the spring spawning bait were still quite shallow and there was a ferocious bite in <10'. Some of the reports are still calling for fishing quite shallow. The low water might be concentrating fish in more accessible areas too. Maybe other factors involved or maybe I'm imagining that the fishing is better. It's not like you can plan for these conditions when you book a trip anyway.
6745209,ILScott,2023-06-19 10:20:00,139,Covid might have played a role in this. No fishing pressure in 2020 and 2021. 2022 was not back to normal pressure yet but this year it is. Prime example last year at the border it took 5 minutes to cross on Saturday. Last Saturday it took us 45 minutes to cross at International Falls. A lot more vehicle traffic this year.
6745213,Old Timer,2023-06-19 10:31:00,255,"I just returned from a Canada lake I often fish. Yes, the fishing was exceptional. But we hit a seam of nice, stable weather and I'm sure that helped. No mayflies for us, but the hatch was about to happen. Saturday afternoon a few became bothersome in the boat."
6745259,emma17,2023-06-19 13:57:00,436,Thanks. Was one of these graphs supposed to be for May of 2022?
6745261,BankerFish,2023-06-19 14:48:00,27,"i don't want to hyjack the thread or speak for the OP, but my read is that they are 2 different locations for 5/2023 - one in Geraldton and the other in Kenora. You do raise a good point tho - would be interesting to compare May 2023 to 2022 and also 5 year average."
6745297,adempsey2.0,2023-06-19 21:12:00,611,No. I probably should have labelled them. Just two different locations - Geraldton and Sioux Lookout (I mistakenly named it Kenora).
6745363,Obabikon,2023-06-20 07:21:00,2370,"I would say it is stable fishing. Not a ton of ""unbelievable"" days, but not many pure grind days either. So, instead of having one day of catching 100 walleye and one day of catching 10 walleye... we're having more days of catching 55. We prefer stability, but I'm not sure if ""totals"" are up."
6745367,1shooter,2023-06-20 07:59:00,1493,Just got back last Friday from our trip and the fishing was really good but I would not say exceptional. I would say last just was closer to exceptional than this year. Of course there were several factors that came into play: cold front and mayfly larvae starting to come up.
