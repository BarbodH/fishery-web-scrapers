6745449,Web,2023-06-20 13:47:00,7,"My dad was really a tried and true traditional walleye fisherman.. He was mostly a walleye guy and would love to troll the day away.. we would try to get him to jig fish or cast or fish for a northern from time to time.. but his true love was to troll for walleyes.. He was likely better than all of us in his youth. His persistence was certainly to be admired.. He would love to tell us ""lets take that side one more time"", or ""do you want to go over that hotspot again."" (when we really hardly caught anything in an area). But best of all, he was able to fish with us in Canada until he was 83. I think he did just over 50 trips in all. He is not with us anymore.. but we certainly shared some amazing trip memories with him that will last a lifetime.Web"

6745011,andreindy,2023-06-18 06:45:00,308,"Days your Dad outfished you. My Dad is not a dedicated fisherman. His passion is golf. But when he's in the boat, he can be calmly determined. I still remember the trip and day in Cass Lake where we struggled. I couldn't figure out any fish (and felt like the group was counting on me) and eventually I spent quite a bit of time sitting at the back of the boat, elbows on my knees in the deep thinking pose not even touching a rod. Sort of an adult, frustrated form of pouting I guess. But Dad kept casting away. Eventually something hit his crank bait and he reeled in a walleye. First walleye of our trip after days of trying. I will always remember how happy he was and the smile on his face. We cheered out loud and my mood immediately brightened. It's like he knew I needed that fish in the boat and he was going to make it happen. Thanks Dad for outfishing me that Day and for the memory I have of that moment all these years later. Happy Fathers Day."

6745019,stjoeguy,2023-06-18 07:39:00,979,One of may favorite memories is trolling in the old wooden resort boat with my father and grandfather at Butternut Point Resort on Whitefish Lake during our annual family vacation. I'd be in the small seat up front with my grandfather in the middle and dad at the motor. When I wasn't paying attention my dad would tweak my line. That would get my attention every time!
6745059,Walleye2242,2023-06-18 11:48:00,263,I will say that i could out fish my dad. He taught me how to fish and he was good but also very stuck in the 1 way he was taught. trolling lure. very very little jigging. My dad and gramps started me in canada in 1979. we also had a small cabin on a river in illinois. So that is how i grew up. they taught many lessons. My dad passed at 59. way to young. he was a brickmason. he would work all year and weekend job just for those special 10 days in canada each year.
6745065,kzoofisher,2023-06-18 12:30:00,5144,"No, he never fished. I started both my sons young and it took hard with one of them, he out fishes me now. He's just got that knack."
6745073,Obabikon,2023-06-18 14:03:00,2370,It depends on the species and what electronics we were able to use. My dad was one heck of a walleye and crappie fisherman. I have spent my time chasing elusive muskies. As many people experience... my dad was gone way too soon. I would love to have had this argument with him. We would both be laughing. Age and experience over youth and energy?
6745135,eyemike,2023-06-18 21:10:00,233,"My dad would outfish pretty much anyone in the boat. He was a heck of a fisherman. He was willing to try whatever it took to catch fish. His favorite saying in the boat was ""I'll roll up little turd balls and put them on the hook if I can catch fish."" My Canada fishing with my dad was so special. Again gone way to soon."

6745205,stumcfar,2023-06-19 10:17:00,451,"My dad passed 22 years ago when I was 34. It doesn't matter who fished better, but I am thankful everyday that he took me fishing and hunting and instilled that passion in me!"
6745227,Timmer92,2023-06-19 10:59:00,451,"My dad is 93 now and doesn't have the skills he once had. He used to be a super walleye guy. I think I could out fish him now, but that doesn't mean I'm better than he used to be!"
