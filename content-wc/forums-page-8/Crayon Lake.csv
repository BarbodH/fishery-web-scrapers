6745581,Spartan1,2023-06-21 06:13:00,46,Planning a trip to Crayon Lake. Wondering if anyone has fished it and what their perceptions were. I hear it is a smaller lake. Any idea on the lakes dimensions? I have a group of 6 and want to make sure there is sufficient space to fish and explore. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Tight lines everyone! Thanks!

Second, i'd mapquest the lake, zooming in/out to see features. It will also have the distance in lower right corner and you can get good feel for how big the lake is."
