Bring your rain gear just in case (I hauled mine all the way from Atlanta only to leave it on the porch of the resort, too excited to think straight I suppose), but not to worry, John hooked me up with some designer trash can liners that were nearly as good as frogg toggs! Ha! I have heard the expression, ""just like fishing in a barrel"" all my life, Zizania is as close to the embodiment of that as I have seen anywhere in the world."

6745993,prov1800,2023-06-22 18:38:00,5010,No clicker for us 25 doz minnows=290 fish plus or minus.Was nice to sit back a few times and let my guests haul fish up.
6746019,pjshorthorn,2023-06-23 04:02:00,5654,"Last fall we sat in 8-15 fow and hammered them. I was on an 8ft deep weed line about 50 feet from the dock. Never had to leave that shoreline the entire time. Camoclad and his brother were another 100 yds or so done the shoreline from me and they moved in and out from shore ..same results for them. Also caught my only blue walleye in Zizania. For a very small lake , it is amazing how fertile the fishery is year on year. In the past we have been asked to keep a rough survey count for MNR purposes to monitor the catch rate , by species, each season. It is one of those happy places to fish with a fly in experience. As a side note, it is catch and release only .no fish can be kept. If you would like a shore lunch you can do that. PjShorthorn"
