We found historical low water levels compared to 2022's high water, which gave view to many new rocks, but thankfully we stayed clear of any major mishaps. The water temps were anywhere from 64-71F, depending on the day and time of day. The walleyes were plentiful for our group of 8, finding them in moving water and usually in 4-8 feet of water. We mainly used 1/4oz jigs tipped with either live minnows, cut up pieces of dead minnows, or leeches. Due to the numbers that we caught, we often ran out of live bait and then switched over to plastics. We found that the best plastics were the Northland Impulse 3.5"" Paddle Tails. The ""Electric Chicken"" or ""Fathead Minnow"" color were favorites, though we lost many to pike bite-offs. We never really fished for pike, but still caught over 500 of them for the week. Biggest pike was 39"" that had a 30"" one in it's mouth, and yes, we netted both of them. We caught thousands of walleyes, with the biggest one at 26"", with many caught in the 16-22"" range. Many days of 100 fish per person during the week. It seemed that the low water levels really concentrated the walleyes in specific holes and channels. Towards the end of the week we could notice the haze from the wildfires, and we saw two active fires on our flight out on 6/11. Weather was very comfortable most of the week, with maybe 1/2 day of rain, and a windy cold front blew in one afternoon that limited our fishing that evening. Also had a lightning bolt hit within a few hundred yards of us one day, out of no where, which was a bit uncomfortable in the aluminum boat with a graphite rod in hand. Overall, another great trip and accommodations provided by the Clark's!"

6745237,ljcs789,2023-06-19 11:22:00,42,We head to Kapikik on 7/2 for a week. First time with Clarks. Hoping the mayflies are done and the fires stay away! Any reliable dinner holes to check out? I'm guessing there's hardly a bad spot on the lake. Can't wait!
6745275,kona77,2023-06-19 17:07:00,236,"Our group has fished Kapikik 3 times and our 2022 trip was the last week of June. Was fearful of mayflies last year but did not see any. Might have been the high water levels and cooler weather (wore jackets all week).. As noted by ""Eagle 1"" you can not go wrong with moving water. Cabin sits on a large island and there are two channels to the North/South that are always great.One called S-Curve and the other Hotspot and both are minutes from cabin.. Kasego Falls is usually very good but a bit of a run (40-45 minutes). Lots of moving water at Kasego and a beautiful area to fish. South outlet is usually productive. Jackpine Lake can be good. Kapikik is a huge body of water and there are not fish ""all over"".. Map on Clark's website shows the good fishing spots and they are consistent with most lakes. Focus on moving water, points, neck down area's etc. Lots of rocks and the water is low so you need to be careful until you get to know the lake. Great/spacious cabin. Have fun and good luck.."
