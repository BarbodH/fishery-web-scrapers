6673222,Pooch,2022-07-17 06:24:00,4618,"I've not been on Ses' for twenty years, but it has always been known as a great Walleye lake. I've also seen some really large Northern there. We always did quite well there. It is an interesting lake. No more or less boating hazards than other shield lakes. Sorry for nothing current to offer, but no one seems to be responding. Where are you staying?Pooch"

I know that there are several outposts on it, its a large body of water, and appears to have some fast moving water in areas. Looks narrower than most lakes we hit up. Going a bit earlier than normal for us as well, so expecting the learning curve to be a bit more than usual. So any ""hot spots"" or areas to avoid would be appreciated."
