6745061,kzoofisher,2023-06-18 11:49:00,5144,The one? 1/4 oz darter head and a white paddle tail. But I'd be kicking myself for not also having fluke tails. And chartreuse and something with purple.
6745137,eyemike,2023-06-18 21:22:00,233,"White 3/8 oz.underspin jig with a 5 inch Authentix K grub or white 4 inch Authentix paddletail or moxi. I just have so much confidence in this setup. I also catch big pike, same setup."
6745383,Mojo-NC,2023-06-20 09:03:00,1929,"I've had good luck with the 3/8 oz VMC Moon Eye jig in the Fathead color pattern (love the keeper on these jigs) paired with a ZMan TRD MinnowZ in the Bad Shad color pattern threaded on. You can add a small piece of crawler to this when the bite is finicky.https://www.tackledirect.com/vmc-neo...-eye-jigs.htmlhttps://zmanfishing.com/store/catego...ch/TRD_minnowz When the bite is on, I like to mix up the colors and see if one pattern seems to work better than another. I carry an assortment of VMC jig heads and a Ned-rig bag filled with a bunch of similar minnow baits in various colors, some with paddle tails and some without. They pretty much all work. Pink and orange color combinations seem to attract too many pike for my taste."
6745435,adempsey2.0,2023-06-20 12:55:00,611,"1/8 to 1 oz jigs. Color doesn't matter to me. Plastics - Yum 4"" grubs in pink/white, Northland Impulse Paddletail minnow in Electric Chicken/White/Shad, Berkley Ripple Shad 3"" in Uncle Rico, Pink Shine, Orange Pearl and Pearl White and Berkley Grass Pig Jr in a natural color that contains white (but Swamp Gas is good too). I would be fine with just the Yum curly tails and any one of the paddle tails in any one of the colors. I have used many different paddle tail minnows and they pretty much all worked. I like the ones mentioned because they are easy for me to get and some are relatively inexpensive. I also use flukes/fork tail minnows (Powerbait Minnow, Lunker City Fin-S), but I think the paddle tails always work for me so I don't have to bring them."
6745441,bluegill8,2023-06-20 13:05:00,5,1/4 or 3/8 jig with these 2 trailers with 1/2 nightcrawler
6745445,Hewhocookstomuch,2023-06-20 13:37:00,66,"1/4 or 3/8 oz jig white, orange, yellow, or purple jigs. White or minnow hoochie coochie (paddle tail). Worked best for me two weeks ago. The mayfly hatch was about to start. Some of my fish were throwing up eggs."
