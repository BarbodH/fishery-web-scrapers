6447826,erino,2020-06-03 08:24:00,399,"I was in the same boat. The state departments website said there was a 7-month backlog.....wow. And if you mail in all your credentials (old passport, birth certificates) you should not expect to get them back for 7-months. Minneapolis has a passport agency that I have used in the past and could get a passport within 24-hours if needed and paid the expedited charge. As of about 2 weeks ago the only way to get an appointment was if there was a life/death situation, and they wanted a copy of a death certificate as well.You have to send in the old passport and they will send it back to you along with the new one."
6447830,Wrktfsh,2020-06-03 08:37:00,492,It's been awhile. Thinking back you are correct

6450792,rwl,2020-06-10 14:21:00,1655,"I went last year with an expired passport. Of course entering Canada was no issue, seeing you don't need a passport for that in the first place. On the way home the US border agent asked all the typical questions including how the fishing was. Handed everything back to me and said BTW, your passport is expired. He explained they can not deny a US citizen re-entry as long as you can prove who you are, and even an expired passport will do that. They can make you go inside and make you wait a bit, it's not a crime or anything so don't sweat it."
6450872,RichA$1970,2020-06-10 18:48:00,1159,I hate to say it but I doubt you’ll need a passport for early August as the border will still be closed. Hope I’m wrong.

6459732,isumoose,2020-07-02 15:01:00,14,"While I'm not very optimistic I'll be presenting it to Canadian Border Services at the end of August, passports are starting to be processed by our State Dept. 236,000 of them this past week as a matter of fact. One of which was mine and it arrived today. I submitted my renewal application in late February."
6459744,Baseline,2020-07-02 15:43:00,3207,"Take a photo of you existing passport photo page and store it on your phone. You do not need a passport to enter Canada if you are traveling by road although they may require you to prove your identity. Passports are needed for reentry to the US, but they cannot refuse you entry if you are a citizen so be prepared to show proof of citizenship. Birth Certificate and DL. A couple years ago I forgot my passport and entered Canada at Fort Francis. Took about an hour for them to run my DL and run my ID through the criminal record system. I had to fill out a form and swear I was a US Citizen. Returning to the US I told the guy at the border I forgot my passport and gave him my DL. He asked if I was a US citizen and said I was good to go. Incidentally he also asked me if I had and bananas bought in Canada."
6447574,jackpotjohnny48,2020-06-02 16:22:00,153,"Hi guys, Question about crossing the border (International Falls / Fort Frances) with an expired passport.... I'm a U.S. citizen, and my passport expires in about 3 weeks.... Assuming that the border actually does reopen in time, my first Canadian fishing trip is scheduled for August 1-8. I had planned to file my passport renewal paperwork back in March or April, but have been away from my hometown of Madison, WI ever since the COVID-19 quarantine hit. So, I just made it back to Madison today, and stopped at the post office. Was looking to get an expedited passport renewal, but they told me that the earliest I can expect to have this processed is 10 to 12 weeks from now. So, I won't even get the renewed passport in time for the August trip. However, I called the U.S. customs office in International Falls, and apparently, if I show them my expired passport, along with proof of my renewal application (such as a photocopy of the paperwork and postal tracking numbers, etc), then I will apparently be able to cross back into the U.S. with my expired passport. Is this correct? I can't remember if I'm allowed to even keep my soon-to-be expired passport, or if I'm required to mail it in with the renewal application. Can somebody give me some guidance here? I think I'll probably be good to go, but I'm not 100% sure about this. ...And I don't think there's a way to expedite anything at this point. Thanks in advance for any info! John."

6447618,Wrktfsh,2020-06-02 18:46:00,492,I have my old passports. Was not required to surrender them
6447676,Stringbean,2020-06-02 19:56:00,279,"They told you at the border that you would have to show your expired passport plus renewal documents. If you submit your renewal you have to send in the old passport with the check and photos and the new DS-82. You had better check to see if copies of the documents will suffice. Otherwise, you don't have a passport to show."
6447682,jackpotjohnny48,2020-06-02 20:02:00,153,"Yes, It appears that in order to renew the passport, I have to send in the old, expiring passport. Therefore, I will obviously not have any passport in hand if and when I go. However, it appears as if I can make color photocopies of the old passport prior to mailing it in for renewal, and if I include this with photocopies of the renewal application (again, photocopied prior to mailing it in), and provide proof of mailing (such as tracking numbers), I think I will be allowed back in to the USA. I will also be bringing along a copy of my birth certificate. After having just read the renewal application form (the DS-82), it appears that I have to send in the old (soon to be expired) passport along with the application for a new one. So, hopefully photocopies of the old one, plus birth certificate and driver's license will suffice for returning to the USA. If not, then it's going to be a very LONG fishing trip in Canada (and I suppose that's ok too) :-) John"
6447716,CI_Guy,2020-06-02 21:23:00,2118,You have to send the old passport in with the application then they mail your old passport back to you with the new one. My newest old passport has holes spelling VOID punched in it.
6447748,Guest,2020-06-03 01:26:00,0,"To enter Canada at any land border crossing, all you need is proof of citizenship and proof of identity. A birth certificate and government issued photo ID, like a drivers license. Heading home the the USA over a land border port of entry, yes technically you need to provide a passport. However, I spoke directly with a US border agent in International Falls. He told me they would not deny a US citizen entry into the USA IF they can provide proof of citizenship and proof of identity. May take some more time to sort it out rather than with a passport, but you will get home. You can also enter Canada and the US at the land crossing with an Enhanced Driver's License. Available at the following states Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont and Washington. You will not require to have your birth certificate if you have an EDL. You can also use a NEXUS card or a FAST (Free and Secure Trade) card. to cross the border as a form of citizenship and ID If flying into Canada, you must have a passport."
6447754,walleyecheek,2020-06-03 04:39:00,2231,Why dont they (whoever they is) just put a chip in all of us and scan it ????
6447756,Stringbean,2020-06-03 04:39:00,279,"This is one of those situations where you hear these famous words ""Pull ahead under the canopy and come inside""."
6447802,David Anderson,2020-06-03 07:29:00,2073,"2 years ago we crossed twice at International Falls, my friends passport had expired in April. On our May trip no one said anything. In June the Canadian guy made a note of the fact his passport was expired and made the statement, ""You could go to Baudette and maybe they won't catch it....Technically I don't have to let you in"" He told us he would allow entry this time. Coming back the US side never said a word, either time."
