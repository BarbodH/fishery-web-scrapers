6459364,pike50plus,2020-07-01 18:17:00,584,Is the crossing allowed to go back into the us to get to LOTW camps on US soil/ factual site references please no side turns.
6459372,bthomas3333,2020-07-01 18:29:00,465,I think you are talking about the NW Angle of MN on LOTW - The section of Minnesota that only has ground access via Canada. I heard you could boat there via US waters and be ok. You can not go there via border crossing. Of course the boating path is more than an hour boat ride.Quite a mess.B-
6459390,muskyman73,2020-07-01 19:05:00,401,So I wonder if you are staying at a camp on the U.S. side and wish to fish into Canadian waters without exiting the boat ? I wonder if this will be allowed ?
6459394,Slim03,2020-07-01 19:12:00,159,Nope
6459398,CI_Guy,2020-07-01 19:32:00,2118,"My son had to boat into Oak Island. They had called ahead and were informed by Canadian border agents they could not drive through Canada to get to the NW angle.For muskyman73, you are not allowed to cross into Canadian waters, doesn't matter if you don't touch land, even if you have a remote access card."
6459412,Obabikon,2020-07-01 19:57:00,2370,That's a big no no right now. They are full on lock down mode.
6459532,Lmbkiller,2020-07-02 07:18:00,639,Well that's unfortunate
6459576,pike50plus,2020-07-02 08:37:00,584,No matter where we can fish
