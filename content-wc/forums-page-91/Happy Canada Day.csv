6459318,Skywagon,2020-07-01 15:20:00,1106,"It's hard to beat a good Ceasar, but when the cocktail hour rolls around today, it will be time for a Rusty Nail. Moose on the menu tonight, but the cook informed me that the walleye caught today will be for lunch tomorrow. A little warm for my liking, but overall a good Canada day, enjoy your 4th of July!"

6459740,Pooch,2020-07-02 15:29:00,4618,Hot up there too! No wonder you're inside on the confuser this time of day. Chest and shoulder high. Few if any tassels by the fourth. There are a lot of replant acres that might be about knee high by the fourth. No Black flies or May flies here... Don't miss 'em. Pooch
