The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) is committed to limiting the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Canada, while facilitating travel and trade. During this time, we are limiting travel to essential travel only. We are asking individuals not to travel at this time if it is not deemed essential. Non-essential travel includes, but is not limited to: tourism, recreation, and/or sight-seeing. Essential travel may be defined as, but is not limited to: economic services and supply chains; critical infrastructure support; health (immediate medical care), safety and security; transiting through Canada for essential purposes; indigenous communities; cross-border employment; tending to family matters for essential purposes; and shopping for essential goods such as medication or basic needs. Specific to your enquiry, we regret to advise that your travel to Canada would be deemed non-essential. On June 16, 2020, the Prime Minister announced that the temporary restriction on all optional or discretionary (non-essential) travel at the Canada-U.S. border will be extended until July 21, 2020, for public health reasons. Note that there are several factors that border services officers (BSOs) must take into account before determining whether a person is admissible into Canada, and each person will be dealt with in person on a case-by-case basis. The burden of proof rests with the foreign national seeking entry to Canada to satisfy the BSO they are admissible in accordance with the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and Regulations. Complying with documentary requirements does not guarantee entry into Canada.
