6453808,Friedo35,2020-06-18 19:36:00,18,Looking hard at outfitters for a June trip in the next year or two. Both of these look great so I was looking for input/experience. Like the meal plan/grocery services along with what appears to be phenomenal fishing. Any advice? Open to other suggestions too
6453878,55walleyes,2020-06-19 03:35:00,131,I have done multiple trips with both and highly recommend both.
6454242,phishfearme,2020-06-20 06:55:00,1242,"my personal experience is that there are really no bad outfitters - especially flyin outfitters - they either love what they're doing or are out of business quickly. so i think as a first priority it's most important to pick the lake that suits your needs/desires then worry about the other things. and for this, the best source of info is this board and others like it. and don't be afraid to ask the outfitter for the name of a person who was there the previous year around the same time frame and chat with them. lakes in NW Ontario vary significantly - even ones near each other. you asked for other options - check out this one:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...ht=kearns+lake there's two subsequent reports also - just search ""kearns"" phish"
6454562,tv4fish,2020-06-21 05:12:00,2694,My personal experience - Slate Falls is one of the best up there.
6455354,DaBirdman,2020-06-22 21:24:00,164,"This is an apples to apples comparison IMO. I've only done 1 fly-in and it was with Hidden Bay. Everything I've read about SF is top notch reports. Hidden Bay is as well. What I like about HBL is that most everything is included in their price....cabin stay the night before, food plan, sat phone, Wi-Fi, plus they'll make you homemade cookies and pies! They have their own plane & fly you out early (weather permitting). Our trip we were fishing by 10:00am day 1. Cabins have indoor bathroom/showers. The people are super nice. And the list goes on. We're planning on another trip with them next year if everything falls into place. Can't go wrong with either place."
6455414,Bstar,2020-06-23 05:27:00,564,"You probably can't go wrong with either outfit. My experience is with SFO. We've done two trips with them and could not be happier with the cabin, equipment, service and their attention to detail. The fishing on Miniss is spectacular. Their other camps look awesome too although we haven't been to them. They are always trying to improve the camps so you have a better experience. Great guys running the show too."
6455580,Jig Man,2020-06-23 10:30:00,95,We used Hidden Bay in 2019 (Miniss) and was not overly impressed. PM if you want further details.
6457622,Clarence1,2020-06-27 08:39:00,29,"We have only been to Hidden Bay of the 2 mentioned, so can’t speak for SF, but have heard good things of Sf too. We have at least 15 trips with Hidden Bay.Simply stated, they are great.Very prompt, pilots are commercial pilots that take long vacations to fly float planes for Hidden Bay.The Pilots and Staff are very friendly and accommodating.Some lakes better than others as with all outfits.The fact they include decent food and plenty of it makes our trip much easier.Treated as a family member upon arrival , hugs , cookies, coffee, and all.Can’t go wrong in our opinion.We have been on many , many others over 42 years.To us they are the most dependable and no worries about things going wrong when you get there.Cost started getting a little higher as we aged, and it did not make sense to spend 2-3 times more flying out when we have a fully rigged new boat ( which is way more comfortable than 14’ 9 hp boats, that we now trailer up and fish larger lakes in Ontario With our own boat.But we do really miss the fly out only cabin on lake thing.Some people don’t have boats or just don’t want to fool with towing, then I would say you cannot go wrong with HBL"
