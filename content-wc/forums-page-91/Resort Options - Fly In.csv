6457392,danvan18$,2020-06-26 16:38:00,67,"I'm assuming PAC is rolling over deposits. Only one guy in our group sent in a deposit. We've been going for so long Lee doesn't require us to send in a deposit ahead of time, although some in our group do. If you want any other details, just let me know. Thanks, Dan"

6456076,Net_Man,2020-06-24 10:49:00,580,If Canada keeps the border closed for the balance of this year and if the current resort I am scheduled with will not allow roll over of my deposit till next year I will need resort options for 2021 and beyond. Looking for fly in options if some one would have any recommendations?
6456222,Net_Man,2020-06-24 15:54:00,580,Anyone booked through Showalter's fly-in this year and if yes then how are they treating you this year concerning deposits and missed reservations due to the closure?
6456234,RichA$1970,2020-06-24 16:14:00,1159,Lesson learned is I would roll the dice and F the deposit. Get a list of outfitters and call 1-2 weeks before you leave as they might have openings. What some are doing on keeping/spending deposits sucks. I know a lot are carrying them over so 2021 will be packed but I am sure there are open weeks.
6456424,Bstar,2020-06-25 04:47:00,564,Check out Slate Falls Outposts in Sioux Lookout. Do a search on them here on WC. Nothing but good.
6456490,jambi,2020-06-25 07:31:00,504,I should be at Cherrington NOW. ... Deposit rolled over to 2021
6456512,Smeds,2020-06-25 07:55:00,103,"Clark's, perhaps? Same thing happening with us. Not looking for a refund, at all ... just a slide to 2021 of our deposit."
6456522,Net_Man,2020-06-25 08:06:00,580,I am not looking for a refund either. Have our trip rescheduled for later this year due to the closure. If the border does not open to salvage a trip this year I have asked to roll the deposit in to a trip next year. They stated if the border does not re-open this year then no refund and they would not roll it over to a trip next year. I am not looking to bash a resort over this border closure but is there only 1 resort that is not offering roll over of deposit to next year if the border does not open this summer or fall? With the attitude of this resort I am now looking a for another Fly-In service for future trips. I have used Showalter's in the past but I wanted to confirm that they were not pulling this BS with their current customers.
6456528,danvan18$,2020-06-25 08:15:00,67,"Check out Pickerel Arm Camps, have been using them for 25 years. Lots of different lake options and not so strict on weight allowances."
6457348,Net_Man,2020-06-26 14:37:00,580,Can any one chime in on Pickeral Arms Camp and/or Slate Falls Outpost on specifically how they are handling deposits for scheduled trips this year that will not happen due to border closure? Are they rolling your deposit over to a trip for next year? Your input would be appreciated.
6457350,Bstar,2020-06-26 14:42:00,564,Slate Falls rolled ours to next year. Great guys to work with. Verne and Ryan will take care of you.
