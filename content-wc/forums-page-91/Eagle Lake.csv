Checked the forecast, supposed to be 93 in the Red Lake area tuesday. A week of that weather up there , then the next thing you have is fires popping up from lightning."

6457754,prov1800,2020-06-27 14:45:00,5010,No blue berries.Usually mid July on.We have fires every year.There part of living in the north.Luckily they seem to be more north of us and if not they get out out fast.But have had some good real close that burnt a long time..This evening tge wife and i are headed to Cliff lake for some muskie action hooefully.They get sluggish in this heat and warmer water temps.Today that surface temp will climb and fir tge next week with these temps we are going to get.Already looking forward to this heat going away.I dont function well in it.But if anything this will drive the walleyes deeper and make fishing easier.
