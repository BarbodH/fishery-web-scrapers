6457368,walleyecheek,2020-06-26 15:35:00,2231,you better change your handle then (net- man) ?
6457376,Eckohlt,2020-06-26 15:50:00,3685,"I don't use a net much But if your boat sits higher out of the water a net beats stretching over the side every time to grab a fish,camp boats are usually pretty low in the water"
6457508,Net_Man,2020-06-26 21:09:00,580,"I gave myself this name when I fished with my kids. I would let them reel in all the fish and I seemed to be the net man. When I am fishing with out them primarily for walleyes I normally do not use a net. A fat 23"" gets a little harder to get my hand around it. A walleye at approx. 27"" or larger the net comes out again. And no sensible man wants to try and pull in a decent sized trout or salmon in the boat with out a net."
6457606,mr ducks,2020-06-27 07:57:00,1459,"My absolute favorite lodge! Great service, cabins, guides, food!"
6457628,The tank,2020-06-27 08:54:00,340,Breven and Afton at Gawley's parkview camp are two of my favorites. I would put them on top of the list.
6457638,kettyspanky,2020-06-27 09:18:00,271,Come by chance resort is my favorite. Ole's resort is a close second. Both are great to stay at and take good care of you.
6457728,hoosiercanadian,2020-06-27 13:53:00,104,"I spent ten years taking my family to White Sands Camp on Sturgeon Lake, which is just south of Savant Lake Ontario . Great people who own it, would have a camp fish fry every thursday night of beer batter walleye, great place to take kids, good place to swim , plenty of lakes in the area to fish besides Sturgeon. I now also fish in north western Manitoba, in mid September we usually go up to Reindeer Lake and stay a couple of days at Grand Slam Lodge, it is owned by Floyd Olson who is of the Cree first nation , and knows the lake like the back of his hand, Reindeer Lake is 100 miles long and has 5,500 islands in it . It is word class fishing , and very well may have a potential world record lake trout , or pike in it. In September the trout are spawning and you can catch and release them until you can no longer lift your arms. Barbless hooks are required , and while chasing trout you usually hook into a huge jack , it is a fisherman's paradise."
6457106,bthomas3333,2020-06-26 09:33:00,465,"Pooch,NOTHING gets someone kicked out of my boat faster than someone complaining. We all get cold or bug bites or nicks or whatever. We are doing this for fun! Complaining about cuts on fingers from catching and releasing a lot of fish is the WORST. I mean would they rather sit there and NOT catch fish.Rant over."
6457114,RichA$1970,2020-06-26 09:38:00,1159,Never had those complaints so I guess the question always goes to “who invited that ....” but agree n would let him find a new boat mate.
6457186,Eckohlt,2020-06-26 11:38:00,3685,"I get alittle irate in the boat when I'm out of jujyfruits,RichA might be able to hook up somewhere sept 11,I need sugar in the boat and lots of it"
6457232,Net_Man,2020-06-26 12:09:00,580,I usually rate the quality of a walleye fishing trip by the number of cuts I have obtained on my hands. Nets are for wussies.
6457264,jambi,2020-06-26 12:37:00,504,I quit netting the big pike too - the camp nets aren't that great and those gators do their roll - and cause a big A mess.
6457282,RichA$1970,2020-06-26 13:16:00,1159,. I was on a fly in an there was an old pervert in the odd# group who on the last day decided to unveil the Anna Nichole Smith blow up doll he packed n was cuddling with all week as he was the odd man that day with a boat to himself. At the end of the day we tied her up to a tree in the narrow channel we had to take daily n when we flew out the next morning the incoming crew was a large family so I bet the dad had some explaining to do. Be careful who you invite is the morale of this story.
6457294,Eckohlt,2020-06-26 13:29:00,3685,Well if the family was all boys that channel probably got a work out
6457324,Da' Walleye Assassun,2020-06-26 14:16:00,358,Anna Nichole Smith's channel?
6457346,Eckohlt,2020-06-26 14:37:00,3685,"Da'walleye that's a good name for the channel,I could give it a few other good names but I don't want to get booted out"
6457366,emma17,2020-06-26 15:32:00,436,Witch Bay for great service and guest interaction.
6456786,troutwater,2020-06-25 17:13:00,299,I thought I'd start a positive thread about lodges we've been to that gave great service. I've been going to Canada since 2007 and there are 3 that stand out.#1 Pipestone Lodge Pipestone Lake. Art and Jenny are great people and hosts. Been there a couple times and always have a blast. #2 Huber's Lone Point Lodge on Wabigoon. Manfred is quite the character and always good for a story and joke. His daughter Tina and her husband Adam now run it and do a great job. Only place I've been to that gives you a complimentary check in beer! They also have the best camp dinner I've ever had. #3 Lost Bay Resort on Cliff. Great people all around. Tyler and Sara are very friendly and would come down to check on us every few days at Muskie Bay. My brother had a coil pack go out and they called around for us until one was found. They even offered to go get it for us. I know there are more good than bad and I've talked to a ton of resorts that seem to be run by great hosts. Just curious to hear from others.

6456830,bthomas3333,2020-06-25 18:09:00,465,"Yeah Eck....I have a couple of holds on trips for September if it happens. Unless we stop the virus from spiking we are probably all out of luck.To make matters worse I had the brilliant idea to go to Alaska pike fishing as a back up. Dream trip for me since it was basically a whole seasons fishing budget and Alaska is open with a test. Great!!! Ill just take one trip since everything else cancelled. I booked it in May, lined up flights, and buddys and then went to talk to the boss at work and was told if I leave for a week my 6 month contract would be cancelled. So I had a dream trip on my finger tips and for the first time in 20 years work said no. **** Virus got me from a whole new angle! Its like it just isn't meant to be.Just one trip. Thats all I need! One good trip. Fingers crossed for Cree Lake Broken Arrow Sept 5. B-"
6456854,Eckohlt,2020-06-25 18:59:00,3685,Brett I'm counting sept also I'm like you need a fix then my high blood pressure might relax lol
6456888,drlee,2020-06-25 20:18:00,409,"I have had great service at a variety of lodges over the years. Right now, I am down to two places that I have fished for many years, after exploring nearly 30 different lakes in northern Ontario since 1987. Press Lake Camp and Austin's Wilderness Fishing Lodge are my two current favorites. I have had a lot of other good experiences. You know what the trick is? Be nice, be respectful, don't fuss over little stuff, also be candid if you have an issue that concerns you. Make an effort to interact with other guests, IF they are willing. And, finally, pay your darn bill without complaining."
6456890,RichA$1970,2020-06-25 20:20:00,1159,"Sept 12 is my floatplane ticket but who knows, but still hoping. This is a good post and at least reflects on the hard work of camps."
6456894,v-bay gord,2020-06-25 20:24:00,3168,You are right!
6456932,Pooch,2020-06-26 02:27:00,4618,^^^Bingo!!^^^ Some folks just can't help themselves and they just whine about everything. PITA guests and fellow guests. It's a fishing camp for heavens sake... Pooch
