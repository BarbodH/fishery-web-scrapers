Supposed to be a Canada-like lake with little development on the lake. Good walleye, smallies, pike and crappie. If anyone knows this lake and can give some tips, it would be appreciated. Still hoping for our Sept. 5 trip to Wildewood, Savant Lake to happen. They have not communicated anything to us but neither have we to them. We will see! Fish On! Hooks"

6458272,rather-be-fishin,2020-06-28 22:44:00,429,"I fish Birch Lake on a regular basis on the weekends. My trip to Canada on Lac Seul also got cancelled, so we booked a 5 day trip at a resort on the South end of the lake near Babbitt, MN. It is about 20 miles long & 20-30ft deep. The North end of the lake where River Point Resort is undeveloped & is in Superior National Forest. There is a campground up there. It does have a Canadian feel. There are 2 resorts that rent houseboats on the lake. The lake has Walleye, Northern, Bass, Crappie & Perch. The Walleye size no way compare to what we catch on Lac Seul, but you will catch some eaters with an occasional 23Â” plus one. We have caught some nice size Crappie. I have heard there are some BIG Northern in there that people fish for with big sucker bait. Use Lindy rigs with a hook with red or chartreuse bead, small gold hammered spinners & other spinners, Orange & other colored jigs with minnows, leeches & crawlers. Hope you have a great trip! RBF"

On the other hand we have an opportunity to fish Northern WI with a friend for free. I haven't seen good fishing in N WI in years- anybody have the same experience? Besides fishing pressure, I wonder if the popularity of Musky fishing isn't taking a toll on the Walleye."
6458412,rather-be-fishin,2020-06-29 11:34:00,429,"Addition to above comment, Birch also has Sunfish. It has a nice variety of fish species, so is fun to fish not knowing what you will catch. There is also not a lot of boat traffic. RBF"
6458422,DaBirdman,2020-06-29 12:11:00,164,"Birch looks like a fun lake. Really long, narrow, not terribly deep with points, bays, islands, rocks and weeds. A lot of what you look for in a lake! Good luck up there! I'll be fishing for a weekend about 50mi southwest of there on the Whiteface Reservoir about a week earlier than your trip."
