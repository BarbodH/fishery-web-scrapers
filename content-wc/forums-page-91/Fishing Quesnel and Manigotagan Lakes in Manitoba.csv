There is a lodge (Q Lodge) on Quesnel. The road into those two lakes requires some time and patience. Drive slowly and you won't have any problems towing a boat.

The last 10 miles in takes about an hour and a half or maybe two hours, and there are places were you hope you don't meet another person coming in the opposite direction. One time I made it in pulling a fifth-wheel and boat behind that. It wasn't easy, but it can be done. There's a big reef out in the middle of Manigotagan. It's usually marked with a jug of some sort so you can find it, otherwise, just look for the line of boats. That's where almost everyone fishes on that water. As long as you can fish the reef you'll probably do well, but if it's a windy day then you'll have to find other places to fish and that's my issue with Q/M. In my four trips there, we never found anywhere else to consistently catch fish, other than the reef. I know people do catch trophy walleye, bass, and pike on Q and on M at other places than the reef but I've had no success in finding them anywhere but on the reef. The average size walleye out on M are quite large, and it's loaded with huge smallmouth (18""+ are very common). Some days you'll catch more walleye and some days more bass, but when they're biting that reef can be a load of fun. The last couple of times I was there, the lodge owner kept a boat cache on Happy Lake. You had to rent a motor from him and carry it around the falls, but that was always a fun trip. Happy is just loaded with bass and walleye, but they don't average as large as the ones on the reef in Manigotagan, but it's fast action. There's not a lot of boat traffic. There's only the one lodge on Quesnel and there are a few private cottages north of the lodge, and a few more spread across both lakes that you'd have to boat to."
