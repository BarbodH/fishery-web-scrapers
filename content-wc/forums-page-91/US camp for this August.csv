6458430,Pink Unicorn,2020-06-29 12:33:00,83,"Since my two weeks in August looks like it'll be cancelled, can anyone recommend a lake in MN or WI? We're usually walleye fishermen but also go after pike and perch. We don't have our own boats and are used to jigging walleye off hard structure in NW Ontario. Something for the family would be great! Budget is not a concern."

Make sure you stick up on food as it’s 30 minutes from town. Nice family run place and I’d spend more time in Teal Lake. There’s another lodge on the lake this that has a great fish fry also, forgot the name. Good lucks"

6458776,DanM57,2020-06-30 10:43:00,135,"If you are interested in the Hayward area, you might also want to check out Treeland's on the Chippewa Flowage. The Chip has mostly undeveloped shoreline and is as close to a Canadian experience as you will find in NW WI. https://www.treelandresorts.com/ DanM"
6458860,troutwater,2020-06-30 14:36:00,299,"I booked a cabin up on Kabetogama for mid August last week. I'm almost exclusively a muskie fisherman, but I guess I'll try to hone my walleye, pike, and bass skills. I've looked at some places in WI, but its hard to find one with good boat rentals"
6459162,pikeandtina,2020-07-01 08:43:00,145,"[QUOTE=RichA$1970;6458586]Thanks Rich, I'm not getting my hopes up...just want to fish for bass, maybe musky? It'll just be good to be on a boat and fish! Looking at the map, I agree with your assessment about Teal. Just concerned about getting through the channel, as they say it is often choked with wild rice later in the season...don't know when that is though???"
6459194,RichA$1970,2020-07-01 09:33:00,1159,[QUOTE=pikeandtina;6459162]In late Sept the channel was no problem and it’s pretty wide (~50-100’). There’s a nice bait shop on the way around 2 miles from the resort that will have shiners n suckers. The lodge owners are really nice n it’s pretty quiet. On Teal lake there’s an island you can stop and have lunch. Good luck n enjoy
