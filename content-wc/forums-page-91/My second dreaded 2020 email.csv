6456516,fishingMN4eyes,2020-06-25 08:00:00,108,"Cool, quick read. Thanks for sharing!"
6456544,Whopper,2020-06-25 08:37:00,340,"So why is it acceptable for Canadians to enter the US?https://www.garsonil.com/blogs/covid...el-to-the-u-s/Read an article yesterday about a women that was denied entry at a land crossing out west and was told to look at flying by our customs agent, she did just that to visit her new grandson."
6456254,Pooch,2020-06-24 17:22:00,4618,A lot of deer in our area. Herd is rebounding after blue tongue and whatever else decimated the population a few years ago. Hope your September trip is a go. One of my regular buddies and his wife make a mid-September trip each year. He's concerned about his trip also. Pooch

6456320,Net_Man,2020-06-24 19:28:00,580,Sorry to hear but at least you had booked through resort with good morals and are rolling your deposit over till next year.
6456328,bigwalleye1,2020-06-24 19:53:00,2632,"Pooch, I offer my condolences on our respective losses. The camp to which I've made 37 trips since 1999 is unavailable to me due to the border closure, now until July 22. May be some hope for a short September trip, so I'll still hold on, but I'm 0 for 2 this year already...."
6456330,bthomas3333,2020-06-24 19:56:00,465,Hey - I have had several of those letters this year too. Still a small chance I might be fishing in Canada in Sept. Not holding my breathe though...I caught 5 - 29/29.5 inch walleyes before I finally got a legit 30.5 in walleye. It makes it so much sweeter when you get a legit milestone fish. Go get it done!B
6456460,tv4fish,2020-06-25 06:01:00,2694,[QUOTE The upside to fewer fisherman in Canada this year is that the average fish should all be the nearly an inch longer and uneducated in 2021.[/QUOTE] Just might be even bigger than that:https://www.aikenslake.com/news/a-lo...tes-of-walleye
6456462,lassh,2020-06-25 06:01:00,553,"Yeah. I have caught 2 29's but not yet one over 30"" in Canada. One of the eyes was 29 7/8"" but not quite 30"". I have caught a handul of 28 inchers. I would like to catch a 30"" from the shield but its not as important as the experience and beauty up there."
6456468,Twodogs,2020-06-25 06:41:00,115,I hear ya...my fingers are still crossed for our mid Sept trip...

6456506,IaDave14,2020-06-25 07:53:00,99,agree but unfortunately mask wearing has become politicized. We need a common sense 3rd party.
6456064,Pooch,2020-06-24 10:25:00,4618,"Was just contacted by another camp that our August trip has been cancelled. Camp decided to not open for such an abbreviated season this year. They rolled our deposits into 2021. I've been worried and sort of expected to hear from them as I just don't see the border opening up this year. Hope it does, but looks grim with the USA still such a hot spot. So, both of our Canada trips have been cancelled for this year. I have been making three trips a year but cut back to two this last year so we could do more racing. I'm headed for the shop to put the boat back into the barn for the winter.... The up and down side of this is that my wife has a long list of jobs for me to get done this summer. I'd much rather be fishing.... Good luck to those still holding out hope. Pooch PS: The upside to fewer fisherman in Canada this year is that the average fish should all be the nearly an inch longer and uneducated in 2021."
6456082,skindzier,2020-06-24 10:57:00,137,"I'm particularly curious to see if there's any noticeable change in musky behavior next year. Wondering if a year off from seeing baits will turn more follows into strikes, at least for awhile..."
6456084,Whopper,2020-06-24 11:03:00,340,"Pooch it saddens me to see your post. I'm still on the hope train, not looking good though. If it doesn't happen it's going to be a very long winter"
6456088,Pooch,2020-06-24 11:15:00,4618,"Yes to the long winter? Long summer, too. I'm seventy two and still farming so there is always something that needs tending to around our place. But.. Canada trips with friends is my escape that I look forward to from the moment I leave Canada until I can return.Like most folks I have plenty of work to do. And... Race tracks across the Midwest are now up and running, but with no spectators so we can at least race a couple weekends a month. Though fishing is my passion racing is my adrenaline fix.Hoping for the best for the rest of you folks. There is more to life than fishing, but I can find little else that is so pure in spirit. I'm optimistic that 2021 has the potential be a peach of a year for all concerned. Maybe I can finally put a legit 30"" walleye in the boat.Pooch"
6456140,Eckohlt,2020-06-24 12:48:00,3685,"I ain't givin up till the water is hard in Ontario,there are places open into Oct and I'm goin"
6456180,Shellback,2020-06-24 13:57:00,8083,"I missed my annual 2 weeks in June, and I have 2 more weeks reserved in Sept. Looks like those are in jeopardy also. I did get up to Erie last week for four days and caught some nice eyes. Not the same experience as Canada, but the fishing was great. Just gotta make the best of what you are dealt."
6456190,gbin,2020-06-24 14:31:00,1384,"Just out of curiosity, what's a legit 30"" walleye? One that was hatched in wedlock?...Gerry"
6456224,Pooch,2020-06-24 16:00:00,4618,"Many guys claim a thirty inch fish when most likely a little shy, but ""close enough"". I've got a lot of 29"" and over, but none have ever been a true thirty inch fish. I can lie to others, but not to myself. I would always know that it wasn't an actual thirty inch fish. It's all about integrity. I don't care about others, but I do care about mine. Pooch"
6456228,Eckohlt,2020-06-24 16:03:00,3685,It's like I shot 5 under par in a round of golf but reality it was a 90
6456230,RichA$1970,2020-06-24 16:11:00,1159,"Pooch, at least Illinois has deer hunting if you are into it as my deer camp in SoIL will be packed this year with the unused vacation time from missed fishing trips. Hopefully my Sept trip is a go but odds are dwindling imo."
