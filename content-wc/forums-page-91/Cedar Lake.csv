6456448,prov1800,2020-06-25 05:43:00,5010,"Got out for a solo trip to Cedar Lake.It was a muskie mission.Pretty much every place a cast i had a follow up but tgey were all lazy fish.All around tge 35"" mark except for one in the mid 40,s.Enjoyed the day. Water temps were 70 f going across the lake so its getting warm.Looked like a huge mayfly explosion to.They were all over.I fished 2 walleye spots but stuck to rock dropoffs and got my 4 fairly quick.Got a day planned for Eagle today with my wife and ìmagine tge hatch will be happening tgere to but we will mainly concentrate on muskies again and they will be lazy again but we dont care.Going to be another hot one and little wind.There are some beautifull beaches on Eagle and iam sure we will end up on one."

6456812,Eckohlt,2020-06-25 17:39:00,3685,"It's a waiting game now,hope you can get some fall clients john be better than nothing,I hoping to be fishing when the moose hunters are out,great time of the year as far as I'm concerned,I should have left you a Ben Franklin when I left so you don't forget what they look like lol,sounds like bill wants to hook up with you to reef on some fall crappies"

6457464,Bill Krejca,2020-06-26 19:09:00,6107,"I haven't had any problem getting crappie, sometimes 100/day/person, but I'd just like to sit around and bs a little with John. Maybe have a pop or 3, been talking on WC for some years, never have had a person to person, but feel like we know each other pretty well. We'll see what this year brings. Or doesn't bring. Bill"
6457490,prov1800,2020-06-26 20:28:00,5010,Got a strange feeling Bill that this is not the year we are going to meet up.there will be many crappies around next year as except for the 30 of them my wife and i brought home that's about all that has come out of the lake so far this year.ill get some more yet this year and around fall. Every species in the lake is getting a holiday this year.
6457522,Hwy 101,2020-06-26 22:23:00,33,"I read Prov's reports even though it's an emotional roller coaster. I'm just happy some one is up there to enjoy the fishing. Most of us will not get to Canada this year, and your updates are the only way we are going to get our fix. good luck and thank you."
