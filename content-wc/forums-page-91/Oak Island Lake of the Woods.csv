6459358,Slim03,2020-07-01 17:38:00,159,Looking at plan B since we are supposed to go August 1st to Lac Seul. Has anyone stayed there that time of year and how was the fishing? Couple of the guys in the group are excited about it but interested in opinions and experiences. We would be planning to take our own boats.
6459400,The tank,2020-07-01 19:33:00,340,My concern would be getting there. Gotta boat from the US side that's a long ride. It's fine as long as it's not windy. Fishing around oak and flag can be good. Good luck.

6459406,CI_Guy,2020-07-01 19:47:00,2118,My son's group took over an hour to get to Oak Island by boat from Warroad.
6459418,Slim03,2020-07-01 20:07:00,159,Yeah it looks like a haul by boat. We are used to big water and long hauls as we do fish Lac Seul. Did your son say how the fishing was?
6459422,Net_Man,2020-07-01 20:30:00,580,"We had been taking a break from Canadian fly in trips and going to Oak Island the last few years. We mostly fish Canadian waters but the Minnesota section of the NW Angle still has some of the best walleye fishing that Minnesota has to offer. We have always crossed through Canada to get there. However, I have fished the main lake from the south shore and for me it seems too often that mother nature does not cooperate."
6459504,CI_Guy,2020-07-02 06:23:00,2118,"They found good numbers of walleyes on a couple of flats further south of Oak than the ones most people were fishing. 6 guys for 4 days the largest walleye was 24 1/2"". He said they caught quite a few in the 22"" range."
