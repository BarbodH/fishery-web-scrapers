6452242,prov1800,2020-06-15 07:26:00,5010,Every week since the opener and actually before the opener i have been missing regular groups that have been coming for years and was so looking forward to meeting some new guys who were so excited.My cell ohone shows me every morning that i had guide dates.Sad situation.My group for this week ended up on Crane Lake in Mn.They keep in touch with me daily and tell me there missing Canada.Fishing they say is not even close to our canadian waters and pretty on the water there.
6452288,danvan18$,2020-06-15 09:07:00,67,"I have been enjoying your posts. Sorry to hear, its a sad situation for all. We are meeting this week to look at a northern MN trip as well because we feel the border will not be opening in time for our mid-August trip."
6452306,rpbadger,2020-06-15 09:57:00,22,55 Walleyes - I fish the meathole occasionally but not that much. Truth is that there are two cabins on the lake and people from the Hidden Bay cabin usually anchor in there 3 abreast and I can hardly get thru. I know many great spots on that lake.
6456072,worthsr,2020-06-24 10:41:00,52,"So this was supposed to be my week at the Black Bay outpost on Lac Seul. The third full week of June every year. A beautiful secluded cabin 25 miles away from everyone else and 50 yards away from world class fishing. I found an old fishing license from 1998 but I think our first trip was in 1995. After several disappointing trips to other Sunset Country outfitters Lac Seul Lodges Black Bay Outpost was love at first sight for me. In the early years we would always see more moose then people for the entire week. Back then there wasn't a shower at the outpost so after shore lunch was consumed it was time to grab your towel and ivory soap and motor over to what the Plummer called the nude beach. Some years the water was so cold you were numb by the time you got every crack, pore and orifice clean. Years later a hot water heater and shower were added to the cabin. What a huge upgrade! We target walleye almost exclusively now days. Each two man boat will catch 100 or so every day, most of them in the slot or above. We also catch about 30 pike, small mouth and perch a day. I miss the scenery, the strategy discussions, the camaraderie, the wildlife and the kind of sleep I can only get when I'm 50 miles away from the closest cell tower. My favorite vacation spot is like the social distancing capital of North America and I really miss it this week. #StaySafe #InItTogether #ScienceWillWin"

6447034,Eckohlt,2020-06-01 14:31:00,3685,"Sept would awesome time to try wapesi dan,if I go July 27 I'll be sure to give you all the details,and I'll do my best not to stretch a 27 inch eye to 29 inch,38 years ago when I drank I had wild fish stories but now I'm a straight shooter lol,rod"
6447046,danvan18$,2020-06-01 15:18:00,67,"Thank you for saving the big ones for me. September Wapesi would be interesting and challenging, only been to Keike that time of year. Not sure if the fish would be in different spots than June. The weather was awesome, fishing ok, not as good as June. I don't drink much, only at night"
6447060,RichA$1970,2020-06-01 15:47:00,1159,Thanks for the link so it looks like June 30 before an update. Problem I have is they say majority of cases are in Toronto area and I wish across all regions it could be more local vs the big cities.
6447138,PA troutguy,2020-06-01 19:54:00,58,"Moved my trip to mid July, hoping to have some sort of definitive answer with enough time to book in Minnesota if I can't cross the border."
6447414,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2020-06-02 10:59:00,240,"Feeling your pain. All day yesterday (June 1) I was thinking about being on Larus Lake or Onepine. Ever since I made my first fly in trip in 2001, June 1 was always right in the middle of the 6-7 day trip for us. Hopefully, as they say, ""there's always next year."" Made 4 trips to Canada last year, and now, am so glad I did. Those outfitters that can hang in there are going to be very, very busy next year."
6447872,I Wire Em,2020-06-03 10:34:00,16,"This would have been my Last Day of fishing on Lac Suel. Would be looking for a Shore Lunch Spot right about now. Weather looked Good All Week. Sunny and 65 degrees in Dryden right now. Had some New Baits I wanted to try. I guess I'll even have more baits for next years trip. God Willing . Stay Save and Healthy, <*((()))<>"
6451840,rpbadger,2020-06-13 14:53:00,22,"I've fished Blackstone, Fawcett, Kabi, and Keike all with Lee from Pickerel Arm. Favorite is Blackstone. Have trip starting Aug 6. Hope the Canadians open up the stupid border!"
6451932,55walleyes,2020-06-14 04:27:00,131,I am sure you will visit the meat hole at Blackstone.
6452018,danvan18$,2020-06-14 11:52:00,67,"I just sent you a PM, would like to chat"
6452158,WallyWarrior,2020-06-14 20:29:00,2488,We would be cleaning fish and drinking a few beers right now. Feels horrible to miss that trip. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6446904,danvan18$,2020-06-01 08:33:00,67,"It feels weird. This is the first time in 36 years not up fishing in NW Ontario the first week of June. We started out doing our own portages using the Vermilion River to access lakes in the Sioux Lookout area. While fun and exciting, it was a lot of work (and we got older). So we went to Ghost River for a handful of year- very cool. Then we tried a fly-in and got hooked on that type of trip and have been using Pickerel Arm Camp for 25+ years. By now the Otter will have dropped us off, get spooled up and catch that first Wally. Re-booked for mid-August- hoping! Darn virus"
6446972,Eckohlt,2020-06-01 12:01:00,3685,"I feel for you Dan I would be right behind you coming into wapesi,hoping for your report,rod"

6446982,Eckohlt,2020-06-01 12:28:00,3685,John don't forget about the great guy from minn
6446984,prov1800,2020-06-01 12:33:00,5010,Wont forget about you Ron.Lol.
6446994,danvan18$,2020-06-01 12:50:00,67,"Unfortunate and we are just starting to get to know this lake the last two years and have much more exploring to do down in the south part. Have been as close as you can get the two trips to a trophy wally right near 27""."
6447006,eyecatcher1,2020-06-01 13:26:00,323,This was the first year that my wife and I were going to stay for two weeks. It was supposed to start June 13. Maybe next year???
6447008,Eckohlt,2020-06-01 13:27:00,3685,"Well dan hopefully I'll be the one giving you a trip report before you go in august if your going to wapesi,but those walleyes over 27inches all might have sore lips and may not want to bite when you get there haha,rod"
6447016,Guest,2020-06-01 13:43:00,0,https://www.cp24.com/news/province-p...e-30-1.4963128 Sorry for the bad news but everyone should now it doesn't look good for awhile yet. Ontario in phase 1 but not close to getting to phase 2.
6447018,danvan18$,2020-06-01 13:50:00,67,"Your a funny man Rod! We have moved our trip to Keike, but will certainly take any intel you get from Wapesi. There was some open time in September on Wapesi, so you never know. Dan"
