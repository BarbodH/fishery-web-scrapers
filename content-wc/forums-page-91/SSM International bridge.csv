6457964,pjshorthorn,2020-06-28 06:12:00,5654,"Brad, a stop on the way up to your cabin would be worth your time to check out the camp. Very nice place....for sure. Before you were to do that, we can chat and I'll give you the low down on how to push Lord Gord's buttons a bit and how to really get under his skin . It is getting progressively easier to do so every year I get to the lodge. Hopefully I'll get there this fall to unleash my new repertoire of torture and unsuredness on Gord....from a safe distance of course...... Hope your cabin build has come along nicely. Would love to see it one day . You picked a beauty of a spot within striking distance of all the prime spots on the lake ....in my opinion. PjShorthorn"
6457984,LoDo,2020-06-28 06:58:00,721,"I'm coming in hacking, sneezing, big ol bronchitis cough looking for a Gord hug! Kidding of course! The mask thing doesn't bother me. I carry it every where I go, wear it in public when needed. The mask doesnt bother me a bit. If the mask is the new means of travel, so be it. Gord n I would get along just fine. We're clearly on opposite ends of the political aisle, but the other 99% of life's obstacles we'd probably agree! Is the handshake a thing of the past?"

6457998,v-bay gord,2020-06-28 07:29:00,3168,If you do make it up this fall you will find me very relaxed after a season of no guests....I will be button-less.

6457442,LoDo,2020-06-26 18:33:00,721,"Thats funny! Feb to April, maybe May the road construction in Denver was unreal. A years worth of projects where taking place in that 2-4 month span."
6457444,pike50plus,2020-06-26 18:35:00,584,Easy go's it!
6457488,Lmbkiller,2020-06-26 20:21:00,639,Hard to believe Lodo in a legalized state of grass
6457550,Eckohlt,2020-06-27 05:36:00,3685,"I think LoDo is more into the sauce than grass,I think he likes his snore juice,lol"
6457570,RichA$1970,2020-06-27 06:38:00,1159,I would love to know how many cases or litres he and his crew go through a week
6457582,LoDo,2020-06-27 06:57:00,721,"Too many responsibilities now. I work too much to be smoking grass all the time. Leave that to the lazy folks! I'm working on buying more property in NW Ontario cottage country. I've stayed in US owned private camps, cottages within Canadas Provincial parks. Think about that. You think Canadians own property inside Yellowstone? Rocky Mtn National Park? Americans are buying up cottage country and its going to continue happening more n more with the tourism funk taking place this year."
6457612,v-bay gord,2020-06-27 08:28:00,3168,Keep buying....we're going to need plenty of tax $ to pay off some bills......
6457712,LoDo,2020-06-27 13:04:00,721,Thanks Gord! I always hear good things about your camp. I need to swing in one of these years when passing through and check it out. I've never fished eagle lake.
