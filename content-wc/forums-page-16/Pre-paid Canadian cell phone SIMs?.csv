It's a long story, but I haven't been happy with what my US carrier (Consumer Cellular) can do for me when I'm in Canada. I will be mainly in the Ear Falls/Perrault Falls/VB area. I'm leaning toward a Phonebox 30 day prepaid SIM card, which is supported by Rogers, but user reviews appear to be mixed."

6729749,Shotgun,2023-04-05 08:47:00,759,"Lac Seul fishing with Verizon as the carrier: if you have an unlimited plan Mexico and Canada are included. If not, it's five dollars a day when used. You can get service sometimes at the cabin several miles south of Ear Falls and out on the lake but it's not reliable. We also tie into the Wi-Fi when we're in the cabin but at times can be slow and erratic service. If you're going to have much of a conversation, it's best to drive into Ear Falls for the best reception/service. We'll visit the bait shop (believe it's Four Seasons), while guys are on the phone. Overall, not very expensive for service but also somewhat limited use. For the most part works adequately."
6729777,N_of_Quibell,2023-04-05 09:54:00,151,"First I want to thank everyone for the very useful input. As I understand it, Consumer Cellular actually uses ATT and T-mobile. Locally, we have only ATT service, but CC's Canada plan is with T-mobile. In fairness to CC, their T-mobile SIM worked ok in Canada in the spring of 2022. However, it was a complete failure in the fall of 2022 (new T-mobile sim). My wife spent hours with their support, to no avail. They emailed us several pages of technical ""stuff"" how to program my phone, which wasn't helpful (and a little odd, considering it work ok a few months earlier). Thankfully I could continue to communicate with my wife in WI via text messaging on my Garmin Inreach (I love that thing.) I've always found CC customer support to be good; within the limitations of their system. I recently suggested to CC that they work a Canadian deal with ATT - I might be wrong, but I think ATT uses Rogers in Ontario. I used to have ATT prepaid several years ago, and I recall being impressed that I had Rogers service way back Timberpoint Road. I think I will try ATT prepaid again. I'm not as spry as I used to be, and going solo, good phone service is important to me for safety concerns. But this stuff is my least favorite part of trip preparation - thanks again for everyones' input. I hope to be bobbing about on Cliff Lake in a few weeks:-)"
