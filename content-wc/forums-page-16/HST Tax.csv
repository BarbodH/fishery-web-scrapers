6728083,walleyecheek,2023-03-30 16:10:00,2231,My group always looked at the HST tax refund as kind of a thank-you to the U.S. Fisherman ! We would always stop at the Duty Free Store in Fort Francis and give it back anyway !.......What would Canada (Ontario) be like without the U.S. Fisherman ?.......Hmmmmm ?
6728089,Eckohlt,2023-03-30 16:26:00,3685,"Looks like orange man is gonna be in a orange jump suit,he probably has a buddy to sneak in a hacksaw for the bars."
6728095,Skywagon,2023-03-30 16:37:00,1106,There would be more walleye in our lakes for us to catch.
6728097,Eckohlt,2023-03-30 16:40:00,3685,And you would have a lot more crawlers n minnows and booze!
6728099,walleyecheek,2023-03-30 16:45:00,2231,That would be Great ! ...........But not for the resort owners !
6728149,Skywagon,2023-03-31 04:57:00,1106,Now we're talking necessities of life!
6728169,Eckohlt,2023-03-31 06:42:00,3685,"Sky,your just going to have to live with less fish and less the other necessities,there opening the flood gates may 20,the onslaught will begin!!"
6728197,Yellowfin123,2023-03-31 08:11:00,2182,"hst tax? never heard of it but I could have missed it, I didnt even know canada was country till probably 2015, then i saw alot of water above minnesota on the map and started checking to see if there was any fish in those waters"
6728255,Eckohlt,2023-03-31 11:34:00,3685,"What did you come up with when you checked if there were fish in those waters??,,,just wanna check with ya Fin if im on the right water???"
6727519,Bill Krejca,2023-03-28 18:14:00,6107,"I'm still holding a check from the last payback, maybe someday I'll get to Canada on a day when a bank is open. Bill"
6727523,Eckohlt,2023-03-28 18:30:00,3685,"Leave it to me in your will,I'll get'er cashed for ya."
6727599,Bill Krejca,2023-03-29 06:52:00,6107,Ha! So many just great comebacks to chose from! I'll have it sent it to ya - postage will be $99.01 (U.S. funds). (In advance) Bill
6727609,Eckohlt,2023-03-29 07:40:00,3685,"Where you sending it to Russia??I only live n.e of you,I can go as high as a 1$ for postage,but thanks for the offer anyways,OH!!by the way do you really need that extra penny,haha."
6727611,walleyecheek,2023-03-29 07:47:00,2231,Is that why they quit giving it to the US fisherpeople so we could support those Canadians who don't want to work ?..........LOL.
6727825,Skywagon,2023-03-30 06:01:00,1106,"That and all of the other give-away programs. Here in northwestern Ontario we don't have a shortage of people or fish, we have a shortage of taxpayers. Thank you for the 13% in tax you pay when here to catch walleye, we need the money."
6727841,Bill Krejca,2023-03-30 06:28:00,6107,! Bill
6727877,Eckohlt,2023-03-30 07:41:00,3685,"I think the people getting the free hand outs,should be standing at the border on opening day holding huge signs saying welcome fisherman n thank you,maybe that's asking to much,might seem like work to them."
6727907,RichA$1970,2023-03-30 08:32:00,1159,"A couple of years ago I saw a funny shirt that said “Keep on working, millions of Americans depend on you for Welfare”. The way to fix it is to look at other countries who don’t use tax payer dollars for a long term free handout, those people figure out how to work or live a life to their income levels."
6727933,walleyecheek,2023-03-30 09:33:00,2231,They do ! They hand out flyers for BORDER BOB'S !..........LOL.LOL.LOL.
6727387,ljcs789,2023-03-28 12:45:00,42,Is this something you can still get back for a trip? I am guessing not any more?
6727393,stjoeguy,2023-03-28 13:14:00,979,No more HST refunds. They've been gone for a while now.
6727397,walleyecheek,2023-03-28 13:19:00,2231,Its a MONEY GRAB NOW !
6727415,Eckohlt,2023-03-28 14:09:00,3685,"The guy with the biggest hands can grab the most,I think Trudy has some huge hands I've heard."
6727441,RichA$1970,2023-03-28 15:32:00,1159,If it’s still 13% for Ontario that’s thievery as I doubt much of that stays in NW Ontario and gets sucked into Toronto.
6727473,v-bay gord,2023-03-28 16:28:00,3168,"whine [(h)wīn] NOUN a long, high-pitched complaining cry: ""the dog gave a small whine"" If tax was unique to NW Ontario you might have a point..."
6727487,Skywagon,2023-03-28 16:43:00,1106,"Actually HST should probably be higher! It takes a lot of money to support those that choose not to work and their growing families, then there is the underfunded Socialized health care system...."
6727495,RichA$1970,2023-03-28 16:53:00,1159,And to pay for those PM’s famous cheesecake recipes and dancing trips to India while they shut down the industry for 2 years….that might be considered a whine so I guess no taxation without representation doesn’t apply to tourists haha.
6727505,Eckohlt,2023-03-28 17:15:00,3685,Paying in cash to a business doesn't always make it to the bank.That's why they made pockets on jeans.
6727517,Clairebear,2023-03-28 18:10:00,937,"Grrr, sore spot with me, my wife and I worked hard to get what we have and to see all the free giveaways boils my blood. But as the saying goes,, the quickest way to kill a man, is to pay him to do nothing."
