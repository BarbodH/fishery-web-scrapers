6427958,TritonEbbs,2020-04-22 19:32:00,16,Wondering if anyone has heard if Ontario side of border lakes will be accessible as long as you don't leave your boat etc... I would think if the US state which shares the lake is open the Canadian portion of the lake would be accessible Regards Ebbs
6427966,FishTour,2020-04-22 19:46:00,105,"A Remote Area Border Crossing (RABC) is required to enter Canada on a remote lake with shared US border. These are not being issued at this time as the border is still closed. I have one pending that may be issued if the border status changes. Even if you do not touch land, anchor or leave your boat, entering without one of these or clearing customs you run the risk of a very stiff fine ($1,500) and loss of equipment including your boat."
6427972,TritonEbbs,2020-04-22 19:54:00,16,"Fish What about the Bill passed a couple of years back not requiring a RABC...as long as you don't touch land, anchor, etc..I have a copy of the Bill in my office; think it was Bill 226 or something like that... Looking at Rainy or LOTW areas Brad"
6428336,FishTour,2020-04-23 06:25:00,105,"Ebbs, The only change to the remote border system that I am aware of was the change not requiring a call in or face to face meeting with customs if you did not touch land or anchor while in Canada. I have fished the Canadian side of Rainy and other lakes but always have had an Ontario fishing license, RABC and passport card in my possession any time I fish Canada remotely. A quick call to Canada Customs should give you definitive answers on what they do or no not require. If an RABC were no longer required, I do not think Canada Customs would have called me about my pending RABC application. Scott"
6429732,LyleKvarnlov,2020-04-26 15:18:00,1,"I did call Canada Customs and was informed that the RABC program is suspended for the time being and no cross border traffic is allowed, even if you don't touch land. Simply put, no travel into Canadian waters from the US. The program itself is also under review with no decision as to the future of it. That info was as of late last week."
6429816,PJHColdwater,2020-04-26 20:37:00,37,I called Canadian Customs yesterday and received the same answer. No water crossing allowed.
