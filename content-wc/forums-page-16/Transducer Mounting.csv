Suction cups require more TLC especially on a rental boat which sets and accumulates it's share of crud- my son found out how quickly the whole suction cup apparatus can vanish, especially when it is not tied to the boat, exit one transducer.

6727791,adempsey2.0,2023-03-29 21:09:00,611,"I think you could do just fine with a suction cup. For me, it was a pain, but I think if you do it properly it should be good. You probably need to clean off the transom, maybe with a scrubby and use Vaseline. Not sure what the best trick is. I purchased the aluminum transducer holder from Tite-Lok. Works, but it's a bit of a beast. I stopped using it. I am trying to remember exactly why I stopped, but it is definitely bulkier and more annoying that a piece of wood and a C-clamp.https://www.titelok.com/product-p/trd-5hs798.htm Now, I am using a 1X4 and a C-Clamp. I think it is important to bring some small pieces of wood or rubber to put where the clamp will connect. It makes a better connection. Same with the Tite-lok mount. Also, I would tie off your wire in case something happens and the transducer doesn't come off the unit or the whole unit goes into the lake! I did have one board snap on me when going full speed and my unit almost went over. Not sure what happened. Maybe the board was just too old? No idea. I certainly used it at least once before. I think the wood used for hockey sticks is much stronger and likely makes it a better choice than regular lumber. A friend uses that magnetic holder. Looks great to me and he has never had an issue. I would probably buy one if was bringing my portable unit more often than I have been."

6728989,Beer King,2023-04-02 19:48:00,146,I made one out of old transom mount trolling motor. Pretty easy to find one cheap. Remove head and cut lower unit off shaft to your desired length. I ran transducer cable thru the shaft out the top or could zip tie. The fully adjustable transom mount is so nice to have. Just have to figure best way to attach your transducer to the shaft. Not rocket science for sure. Maybe if every ounce counts a board and clamp is better but mine does not weigh very much. There could be options for lighter weight shaft too. Dan
6727329,Mr Ranger,2023-03-28 10:12:00,272,I am looking for a clamp on transom transducer bracket. I have used the suction cups but unreliable and lost a transducer last year. Does anyone have a recommendation on a decent bracket. Thanks
6727333,prov1800,2023-03-28 10:32:00,5010,Have used this one for years.Awesome item.Use it on all flyouts and guiding out of camp boats.Got it from cabelas many years ago.
6727347,Ltrain,2023-03-28 11:06:00,4145,If i was going with a rental I'd just mount my transducer to a 2x4 and get a big C clamp and attach it to the transom
6727353,mctbone,2023-03-28 11:10:00,26,I've used this magnetic transducer mount on my last 4 fly-ins and it has never accidentally come off.https://www.fishfindermounts.com/pro...ucer-mount-kit
6727375,JAY221,2023-03-28 11:47:00,877,"I second this. This is how I have been doing it for years and never had a boat it wouldn't fit on to. Later, Jay"
6727423,phishfearme,2023-03-28 15:01:00,1242,i wouldn't give up on suction cups - just make sure: 1 - you sand and steel wool the mounting spot - find an area that's as smooth as possible 2 - you tie the transducer off to the gunnel with a strong cord after we lost a complete sounder when the cup came off at full speed - we've been doing the above and have rarely had the transducer come off and never had any other issues. how do you get a magnet to stick to aluminum? phish
6727427,proguidedream,2023-03-28 15:13:00,345,"2x3 piece of wood, if its for a fly in camp with small boats cut the board to fit in your clothes bag.. use a ratcheting or quick grip style c clamp. put the ducer just below the piece of wood. and dont put the wood lower than the boat. thus you wont create any drag when boat is moving and it wont get knocked off. i use this method a couple times a year, its fairly flawless. i have had it fall off 1 time after 3 days of use and forgot to check the clamp. the wood floats , so pretty hard to break anything. lost the clamp tho bring an extra"
6727433,jambi,2023-03-28 15:21:00,504,Magnet is double sided. Half in the boat half out. Looks pretty cool can use in kayaks etc.
6727449,prov1800,2023-03-28 15:37:00,5010,Be tough getting a magnate on inside of the modern boats now and getting outside magnate to hold would need 2 people and might need to get stuff out of way.My clamp on in the pic I pisted is the simplest thing going for mounting a transducer and you can adjust it perfectly to work on the boats with 50+ horsepower.
