6728029,Bigtaproot,2023-03-30 13:25:00,900,but i know i provide entertainment for you between episodes of gunsmoke or whatever you are doing in the tundra. my guess is that you will be at the golden corral tonight

6728209,wallguy1992,2023-03-31 08:36:00,19,"Huge congratulations taproot, this is the least intelligent post I've seen on walleye central to date, and there are some doozies.You seem to be so elite at everything that hiring a guide would do you a disservice, why waste time paying someone who knows less than you?"
6728245,walleyecheek,2023-03-31 11:13:00,2231,"AH, can i chime in here ! Your wrong about the Golden Corral ! He'll be at the Chocolate Moose !"
6728409,fishin779,2023-04-01 05:37:00,63,"That is pretty cool, but last nite you could have stayed home and watched a great basketball game WON by the Lady Hawks !! Wish them well in the finals , GO HAWKS !!"
6728435,Eckohlt,2023-04-01 07:14:00,3685,I'm all in for the lady hawks!!
6728783,Fisherman Ted,2023-04-02 08:50:00,461,At first I thought this was a joke. Nope. You win man. But if I want to gamble with a guest we could do what you propose. However there is an upside for me. If I show you 200 fish you owe me 2 grand. Sounds fair..... -FT
6728993,Obabikon,2023-04-02 20:18:00,2370,"I had someone ask me that one time several years ago. I was charging $200 for a day of musky fishing. He asked if he had to pay if we didn't catch any. I told him we could play that game, but if that's the case, I get paid $100 per musky... if we boat 5, you're paying $500. But, if we don't boat any... it's free. He laughed and said he'd better just pay the $200. We boated 3... and he tipped me $100 for the extra fish. It was all light hearted, but most confident guides are willing to put their money where their mouth is. I know what an average day is for me... and I know what a great day is too."
6728999,Eyesore,2023-04-02 20:26:00,455,That was a great counter offer you made and cool story as well!
6727763,Eckohlt,2023-03-29 19:32:00,3685,"What the heck you doing eating at golden corral,that stuff will kill ya,if the booze don't getcha first.And by the way you don't need a guide,you should be able to out smart any fish that swims in Ontario waters,being the captain of your own vessel."
6727765,Yellowfin123,2023-03-29 19:33:00,2182,"tap you better lay low tonight and get your beauty sleep, its spring and all the good lookin housewives are coming down to open up the lake homes, there will probably be some good action at the store tomorrow"

6727811,Bigtaproot,2023-03-30 04:40:00,900,I find most women react positively to the cut of my Jib
6727871,Eckohlt,2023-03-30 07:28:00,3685,"Bigtap I don't think fishing is your forete,,you belong in Hollywood in the movie business and not the ones kids watch."
6727875,That Minnesota guy,2023-03-30 07:33:00,8293,He's a fantasy writer. It's pretty obvious.
6727881,Eckohlt,2023-03-30 07:45:00,3685,We can give him that credit.lol
6727723,Bigtaproot,2023-03-29 17:12:00,900,"Do any guides charge based on the number of fish caught. For example, if the guide fee is $200 and I asked the guy how many fish I can expect to catch and he says 20. With any guide to agree to get paid $10 a fish caught, not necessarily boated but just visible."
6727727,Eckohlt,2023-03-29 17:40:00,3685,"I kinda doudt it works like that,can't predict how many fish a person gonna catch,Root you know how fishing works,somedays good n somedays bad,unpredictable."
6727729,v-bay gord,2023-03-29 17:46:00,3168,Something tells me that even using your ten fingers you're still not going to be able to figure out the math.....
6727731,That Minnesota guy,2023-03-29 17:49:00,8293,"Since you want to pay on performance, bring a bunch of your stocks to pay him with."
6727733,Eyesore,2023-03-29 17:56:00,455,"You would be hirgring a fishing guide, not a catching guide. Connect them dots"
6727739,Bigtaproot,2023-03-29 18:41:00,900,Have made up all my losses on NVDA. I must admit I am below 10 million on net worth now but I anticipate going over it in the summer when the market rallies a little bit.
6727741,Bigtaproot,2023-03-29 18:46:00,900,"You remain the voice of reason. I am just thinking if someone came up and wanted six bratwurst and ice took their money, and then said we don't have any bratwurst. They would not be happy same logic, if I bought a 1.75 L bottle of the captain and then got home and it was empty. I would not be happy."
6727743,Bigtaproot,2023-03-29 18:47:00,900,"What is the asset management t firm that sayss, we make money when out clients do. I think that would be similar logic for a fishing guide."
6727755,Eckohlt,2023-03-29 19:09:00,3685,Bigroot do you remember drinking a 1.75 L of captain tonight??
6727761,Bigtaproot,2023-03-29 19:20:00,900,I have not even gotten through a 750 tonight but did have to tree jack and cokes at Golden Corral. Even on a good weekend day I hardly ever finish a whole 1.75 in a day.
