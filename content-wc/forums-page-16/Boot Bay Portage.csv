I remember reading somewhere on here that it used to be a good snowmobile trail at one time, just wondering if it is still accessible."

The map may have been included on a camps web site, or maybe a Morson info site, etc. Might have been from Buena Vista? Bill"
6716529,mjames,2023-02-22 09:21:00,18,"Thanks guys, just got back from the area, didn't get a chance to check that part of the lake out but certainly on the list of places to go. Too many spots to check out in that area! Are the crappies in the Elbow on Obabikon in winter or is that just a fall area to fish?"
6716653,Obabikon,2023-02-22 20:20:00,2370,"Yes... it is. Snowmobilers use it regularly. There's a nice trail, and even a picnic spot about halfway through to stop and rest. It's been 5 years since I've been up in the winter time, but we took it then."
6716695,mjames,2023-02-23 06:56:00,18,That's great and thanks for the info! If conditions are still good when I get back to Sioux Narrows and I make the trip I'll report how it is currently. Are the crappies in Obabikon Lake (elbow area) in winter or do they move out?
6716727,Bill Krejca,2023-02-23 07:59:00,6107,The Elbow is one of their(crappie)wintering spots. Bill
6716735,mjames,2023-02-23 08:31:00,18,Thanks Bill! I'll give a report if and when I make it there!
6729133,mjames,2023-04-03 10:08:00,18,"Finally made it out and wife, kids and I went and checked out the boot bay portage trail into Obabikon and it is a well used trail, fairly long through the bush but good shape. Fished for trout in Whitefish then went to Obabikon for crappie, tried a few spots around the Elbow where other people had been fishing but didn't mark a single fish so didn't spend much time in there. We didn't get into there until mid afternoon so not sure if that had something to do with it. Beautiful spot and will go back someday for a more honest effort."
