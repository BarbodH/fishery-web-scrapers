507576,Guest,2000-04-07 15:31:00,0,I am currently looking at this rig does anyone have any experience with this boat.Looking at 115 merc to push it. I am posting it under Canada because i understand they dont make this model in the US.
507577,Guest,2000-04-09 16:41:00,0,"Hi Barry, The Izumi editions of the Lund boats you are asking about are built in Canada At the Steinbach plant. There is both a Bob and Wayne model. The difference I believe is one has a single consul and the other a double consul. These boats are built on the what I believe to be a fisherman series hull. I can not find this boat in the new Canadian catalog only the Bob Edition, both boats were basicaly the same. The dimensions of the 2000 Bob are: Length 16'11""width: 89"" and it weighs in at 1056lbs, has a max hp rating of 120 hp, free board thickness is .063 and the bottom is .080 with a .063 twin plate. As well as having a built in 18 gallon fuel tank. Those are the basic numbers and as for performance I have very little to go on other than the Fisherman series boats are real good sellers here in Canada. They are also a very affordable mid-line multi purpose series. I hope this helps a bit. I will continue looking for the 1999 catalog with it in there and relay the info to you.Good Fishin'Russ"
507578,Guest,2000-04-12 09:27:00,0,i currently own the wayne izumi with a 90hp yamaha. i bought it in the spring of 98 and have been quite happy with it. i had alittle warranty work done the first fall but since then there has been nothing go wrong with it. believe me i spent alot of time researching before i purchased this unit and when it came down to spending hard earned dollars i could not find anything of equal value with the same features. where are you from because i know a dealer close by with a 98 model with a yamaha 115 and is willing to deal.
6627606,RonI,2022-01-23 21:12:00,4,I too am looking at purchasing this boat. Does anyone know the towing weight? I 'm trying to decide if I can pull it with an older 4litre 4x4 Ford Ranger. Any info would be appreciated. thanx
6627624,Hot Runr Guy,2022-01-23 23:11:00,16061,"Boat/motor/trailer (empty) about 1900#. Add gas, batteries and stuff, and I'd say you'll be about 2500#.A 2000 4.0L 4x4 Ranger had a towing capacity of 5800#, so you should be fine.HRG"
6627626,RonI,2022-01-23 23:22:00,4,I was thinking the same. My Ranger (2002) will look like a smart car with that boat behind
6728613,RonI,2023-04-01 15:46:00,4,"Well, I did buy that boat and had a good season with it. A roomy, solid boat. Ran a 115 Evinrude on it, after spinning out the prop that was on it, it ran flawlessly with the new one. So now it's time to do some of the cosmetic work it needs. Does anyone know where I can get a set of windshields and a cover/bimini/camper top for it?"
