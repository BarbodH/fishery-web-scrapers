6729521,Yellowfin123,2023-04-04 12:07:00,2182,"my last time there was 1st week of july 2019,, i'd say the place was filled to maybe 35% capacity, we had the whole motel section to ourselves, docks are ok but 3 different boats, nice skeeters and a ranger would take their boats out every night and just pull them behind their cabin at night , i day i wished i would have pulled mine out with the winds, shoulds just ran it up on the sand where they keep their lodge boats, some times i would wonder if we were the only boat on half of lac suel. its ""bring a 5 gallon bucket of tarter sauce"" type water and would never fool with live bait, just not worth getting the bait tank dirty"
6729541,Old Timer,2023-04-04 12:35:00,255,Mahkwa's dockage has been a continuing complaint for longer than I can remember. Every year there's a new thread somewhere. You'd think the camp would change its ways.
6729545,Eckohlt,2023-04-04 12:42:00,3685,"Those are old native ways,you don't mess with docking!!"
6729575,Yellowfin123,2023-04-04 13:53:00,2182,"there's alot of things to be addressed besides to the docks too!! such a prime untouched location with even the structures in place already but just need some upkeep... if I had the cash, that would maybe would be the 1 resort in NWO I would buy and fix up... a drive too location with fly in quality fishing"
6729579,Eckohlt,2023-04-04 14:00:00,3685,When I went there we had to boat to it.how long have they had a road to resort??
6729585,Yellowfin123,2023-04-04 14:05:00,2182,"not sure, its pavement till the last 1-2 miles, you would think at least 20 years as a guess"
6729589,Eckohlt,2023-04-04 14:28:00,3685,"Ok,thanks"
6729773,cuamb,2023-04-05 09:47:00,203,How are the cabins? Do we need mouse traps?
6729825,Eckohlt,2023-04-05 12:01:00,3685,Bring traps or a cat!
6729875,Yellowfin123,2023-04-05 14:03:00,2182,"pooch might know the cabins across the water but everything south of the office is pretty decent, heck our bathrooms had granite counter tops , where you have dinner, pretty nice.."
6729177,Lac Seul John,2023-04-03 12:01:00,31,Thanks JDP for posting that link. We smoked 'em. What a trip. I struggled a bit with the docks. Plenty of space since we were up during a real slow weekend. But not alot of padding on the docs and alot of the rings were pulled out (I have a 21 foot boat and am paranoid about scratches - so am very sensitive about where I tie up). The boat was too big for the majority of the spaces on the dock. I am pretty sure I could have parked by cabins if I needed to but that was a longer walk and heck I am on vacation so I need to be lazy! Keep it simple and fish the spots that look fishy. It's an awesome spot there and loaded with fish. I think you are in for a great trip. I am bummed as I don't think I will make it back up there again for a while. Please be sure to share a report. I will be looking forward to it.
6729253,cuamb,2023-04-03 16:59:00,203,"Thanks, I will make sure to give a report. I have trips in June and August for the NE side but the September trip will be the first time in this area."
6729291,Pooch,2023-04-03 19:04:00,4618,"Most (but not all) times if you park your boat, hang bumpers on the dock and have a shore line plugged in and laying in a parking spot, that should be enough for others to know that someone is parking there and out fishing. Find another spot.Not everyone respects that common courtesy. I've came back in the evening to find someone in a spot that I've used all week using my bumpers and my shore line. That's BS.It's just common courtesy folks.Dock space on the housekeeping side of Mahkwa does get crowded. Some slips are too narrow to get two boats in side by side. Everyone seems to be getting bigger and wider boats anymore. Great fishing camp and good people, just docking can be a hassle. Sometimes for the close cabins it might be easier to just load every night when the camp is full. Mahkwa is a well kept secret.Pooch"
6729309,Eckohlt,2023-04-03 19:47:00,3685,"nothing better than having a secret camp n lake,there very rare."
6729381,cuamb,2023-04-04 06:24:00,203,Is there sand beaches by the cabins? That would be an option for parking your boats also.
6729401,Pooch,2023-04-04 07:14:00,4618,"Sand, but too shallow. Only a couple cabins next to the shore would have that option. We considered though that wasn't going to work. Docking not a problem if people would just respect each other. Not a big deal, just sometimes aggravating. When one guy pulls into a docking space that someone else is using, it ripples out 'cause now the displaced boat has to go searching and possible take another's spot. Etc..etc..I don't know how the camp could fix it other than add another dock and there might not be room and building another dock would be expensive. Camp is full most of the time. Of the several trips I make a year, the Mahkwa trip is my favorite. Location on Lac Seul is nearly a perfect fishing destination. Most camps on LS are located long drives from some of the best fishing areas. I've never found ""the Perfect"" camp. They don't exist. Fishing camps are just that... fishing camps.Pooch"
6729455,btyreprich,2023-04-04 09:24:00,1067,"This camp is on my bucket list to fish - hopefully in the next year or two. With regards to dock space being a challenge at times, is it feasible to launch the boat each morning & take out at the end of the day? Yes I know this can be a pain in the seat, just asking. Not sure how their boat launch ramp is as I've never been to this camp."
6729481,Old Timer,2023-04-04 10:42:00,255,I'm with Pooch still searching for the perfect camp and I've been searching for fifty years. I often try a new place and doing so again this summer. It won't be perfect. Prolly not even close.
6729485,JDP,2023-04-04 10:47:00,1457,"************************************************ Please see the camp layout attached. Yes, a person could take out the boat everyday. The boat ramp is concrete (middle of the layout) and gradually slopes. But it is without a dock, so having a 2nd person as an assistant is helpful. However, Mahkwa management requests that trailers be parked in a parking lot (bottom of the layout) not next to the cabins. This keeps congestion down to a minimum near the cabins. Trailer parking is a few minute walk from the Housekeeping Cabins (top of the layout). Camp layout attached."
6729505,Eckohlt,2023-04-04 11:38:00,3685,"sht,it looks like a major city compared back in the early 80's when I was there!"
6662396,Lac Seul John,2022-06-07 07:03:00,31,"Hi All I am headed up to Mahkwa for the second time ever late part of this August. Our first trip was great success and we are looking forward to our return. We hired a guide for 2 days and asked that he show us the hazards and find us some spots. Long story, but we decided to go on our own after the 1st day with the guide. We really did not learn much. We also asked at the counter in the lodge and the employees there basically said 'huh, we have no idea'. So the fishing for us was pretty tough for the first couple of days - the fish were set up on mid lake humps and locating them took time. (It wasn't as simple as just fishing good looking points and steep edges off of islands). We were very lucky that some of the guests gave us some ideas. We ended the week with 2 100 + fish days and one day with 80 something - so great times. So the point of the post is to ask if anyone can give us some pointers for our next trip. We basically ended up with a milk run of 3 spots all within eye sight of the camp. We would like to explore a bit more this time up, but don't know which way to go. I am going to get a better chip for my plotter - so I expect that will help alot. But I've learned so much from this forum, and have seen how much people share info here - so I am asking for help and advice. Any ideas about techniques and / or location would be very much appreciated! As for Mahkwa - don't get me wrong - we had a great time there, and I recommend it to anyone. Our only disappointment is that you are kind of left on your own to figure out the fishery. The fishing is so good that even this blind squirrel can find them, but our time there is so short that it can be frustrating the few days when you are trying to locate. Thanks All!! John"
6662462,Yellowfin123,2022-06-07 09:38:00,2182,"i know what you mean, you won't get alot of input from the folks there lol... i kinda learned from other guest while there, if you head north outa camp then fade nw you can get into alot of fish in the current around all the islands.. other guys were going to bray lake everyday, you head west then turn south, about 10 miles.. you have vaughn lake to check out too, dragging spinners going into vaughn you'll hook up about every 30 seconds but all really small... tell ya truth i'd like to buy that resort and take a couple guys for a couple months then sell it, the facilities there have alot of potential and its a drive to resort on an untapped section of lac seul it looks like to me , their really missing out it looks to me"
6664024,Lac Seul John,2022-06-13 08:12:00,31,"Thanks YF. Our guide took us into Vaughn Lake. We did not do very well there - from what I can figure out it is an early season spot, or maybe he did not take us to the right place. I had a guest there tell us about Bray Lake also - will give that a shot. Thank you! The islands to the north - we tried some of those spots. Had a real good day the first time, then it kind of fizzled out. Will revisit that for sure. I've been having some fun exploring on my Navionics app. Was able to find some interesting structure around Holden Island to the east and Chambers Island to the west. It will be fun to explore. Hope to avoid hidden rocks!"
6728789,cuamb,2023-04-02 08:54:00,203,"LS John, Any update on your trip? We will be headed to Mahkwa in September. We have many trips to the NE section but never this area."
6728797,Eckohlt,2023-04-02 09:15:00,3685,"Do you still have to fight for dock space at night when you return back to mahkwa at night??,,in the late 80' it was race at night to get a space at the dock!"
6728825,JDP,2023-04-02 10:36:00,1457,https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=734562
6728831,JDP,2023-04-02 10:46:00,1457,"Dock space is not assigned. In my experience since 2005, you may not get the same dock spot. However, I always have ended up with satisfactory docking. ************************************************** *********** Below is from Mahkwa Lodge's website, the Frequently Asked Questions page. Question: Can you reserve docking space? Answer: There is ample docking space to dock your boat when staying at the Lodge, but we do have a docking system in place, therefore, we do not reserve specific docks for certain cabins."
6728869,Yellowfin123,2023-04-02 12:31:00,2182,dock space is not a problem
6728871,Eckohlt,2023-04-02 12:37:00,3685,"Ok,thanks"
6728873,Eckohlt,2023-04-02 12:38:00,3685,thanks.
