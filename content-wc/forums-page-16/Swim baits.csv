6726987,bode,2023-03-27 07:50:00,39,Would like to hear suggestions from anyone using swimbaits for walleyes such as size and Colors of plastics. Thinking about trying some this year instead of live bait.

Or actual large swimbaits?I will just assume you mean paddle/twitch tail baits.These are some that I use:Berkeley Ripple Shad 3.5"" (I think all the colors would work, but these are the ones I use - Uncle Rico, Pearl White, Fire Tiger, Pink Shine, Smelt, Orange Pearl)Berkeley Grass Pig Jr. (these are cheap and very effective) (Pearl White, Shad, Swamp Gas)Northland Impulse Paddle Minnow (White, Shiner, Fathead, Smelt, Electric Chicken, Chartreuse Shad - all the colors are good)I use a lot of locally made baits that are very similar to the recently introduced 3"" Keitech Easy Shiner. The Keitech looks nice, but is usually more expensive relative to the local brands like Anglers Choice.I also like the Lunker City 3.5""/4"" Fin-S Minnow. They also make paddle tail minnows, but I have not used them yet. The 3"" Berkeley Powerbait Minnow is also pretty good.In general, I get white and maybe something natural like shad/smelt etc as well as some variation on pink or purple, but chartreuse and orange work great for me too."
6727059,bode,2023-03-27 10:32:00,39,Thanks for the reply. Was considering paddle tail for added vibration as water is pretty stained. Appreciate listing of color choices you included.
6727071,MrSimon,2023-03-27 10:51:00,922,"I want to love paddle tail swimbaits so much .... and I've bought TONS of them. But for some reason they just don't work for me. I think it's because I like to jig vertically for walleyes instead of casting and retrieving. I'm sure some guys jig with paddle tails and do well, but they just haven't worked for me. I've tried just about every plastic bait ever created for walleye fishing .... and I usually end up with a curly tail grub tipped with half a crawler."
6727097,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-03-27 12:08:00,358,Walleye Assasin soft plastics swimbaits in white or chartreuse work great. I use a quarter ounce head in shallow water and use a three-eighths head in wind or moving water. Keep the swimbait near the bottom by the speed of the retrieve. Don't stop the retrieve after getting a hit without a hook-up. I have had them come back three or four times before catching a walleye. Walleye Assasin swimbaits are a very soft plastic. You can rig the swimbait sideways for three times the use. The soft plastic is what gives them great action. Hope this helps.

For casting presentation paddle tails work better for me in the lakes I fish, but could be different other places for sure. In paddle tails I like the Ripple Shad - White / White Chart / Orange Yellow / Elect chicken Brett"

6727303,NM_Trout,2023-03-28 08:47:00,1094,I second the electric chicken color pattern. That outfished everything on our last trip 3:1.

6729181,valley366,2023-04-03 12:26:00,193,I too mainly vertical jig and have found minimal success with paddle tails. Nice to know I am not the only one.We found that different bodies of water or even different parts of the same lake impacted how well things worked. Had several varieties of Berkley Power Minnows and different colors worked in different places. Should have taken better notes as need to restock some and don't remember which ones worked best.The kid had grabbed this multi-pack of plastic shads someplace. He did good on a pink colored one. We saved the package from it only to find out the color was discontinued. But like the Berkley it worked good in one section of the lake but not others.
