6728599,That Minnesota guy,2023-04-01 14:05:00,8293,Rainy Lake still has 2-3 feet of ice. It's going to be a while. My best guess is ice out will be the week of the openers both here & Canada.

6728699,Skywagon,2023-04-02 04:49:00,1106,"And that is a deep trout lake, the ice usually does not get as thick as a shallower walleye lake."
6728723,prov1800,2023-04-02 06:48:00,5010,That is very true.Usually trout lakes freeze up last and usually thaw first.
6728745,prov1800,2023-04-02 07:40:00,5010,Had a fun day yesterday.Weather is improving but not good enough to melt much. Overnight Temps still below 0 so that will have to change first to above 0.This coming week here in NWO is staying below all week.Daytime Temps will creep above 0 a couple of times.Its a long process to get rid of ice.But if all the right things happen it can disappear in a hurry but not looking to good yet.So lucky us we get to play on the ice longer.Iam sure it will be gone around first week of May as it historically does.We just have to be patient.Wife and I had a great trout day on the ice yesterday.
