Once those are used for trips this summer (or sacrificed), we'll start seeing how much fallout there truly is."
6720579,Fisherman Ted,2023-03-06 14:48:00,461,"After last year's open border all rollovers should have been used in 2022. Starting fresh this summer.I am seeing a down year numbers wise. And have heard from numerous outfitters saying much the same.Guests should have known prices were going to be going up. Just like the rest of the world. To only increase prices 10-15% is actually quite low considering how much everything else has skyrocketed. My prices have increased 11.75% since 2019. So that's over 3 years, 2 of which I was never open hemorrhaging money, huge inflation and unheard of price increases most notably labor, food and insurance (boy did insurance kill me this year).I agree that this year will be critical for many operators. High costs and no more rollovers will be hard to overcome for many. We shall see.-FT"

I hear the same at work & laugh when I seeThem holding like a $6 Starbucks cup, a $15 Panera lunch or other items that are more Wants vs Needs. I think if people prioritize they can offset a fishing trip price increase by skipping on certain expenses."

6727721,Bigtaproot,2023-03-29 17:08:00,900,Do you guys still offer free minnows? I'm surprised with all the crap you took on the pandemic deposits that anyone would visit.

6727753,Eckohlt,2023-03-29 19:06:00,3685,I think Tap been into the snore juice!!
6727787,bthomas3333,2023-03-29 20:36:00,465,10-15% isnt bad. One well known lodge in the far far north is up 40% since 2019. Completely pricing me and I would guess another who works for a living right out of ever visiting. Super disappointed.B-

6718489,Eckohlt,2023-02-28 15:33:00,3685,"I'm heading to the spam museum in Austin mn Friday,I'm gonna turn that guys arse in!!!"
6720555,Obabikon,2023-03-06 13:05:00,2370,"Certainly prices have gone up... I mean, everyone knew it was going to happen. Talking with a lot of lodge owners this offseason, I would say that prices are lower than I would have guessed 18 months ago. Most places are up between 8%-15% compared to 2019. That's not bad, in my opinion. We're lucky... it could have been much worse."
6720561,That Minnesota guy,2023-03-06 13:15:00,8293,"Jared, how are the bookings? People coming back?"
