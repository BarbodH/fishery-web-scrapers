511984,Guest,2001-04-26 16:38:00,0,"Larry S, thanks for all of the tips.I'll keep you posted.Good fishing!!!!"
511974,Larry,2001-04-20 18:11:00,357,"All the fish that we left in Misaw in 1990 should be a lot bigger now.Hope you catch them all again .I'm going to a new lodge outside of Thompson Manitoba this year This is its first year opened,its owned and operated by Pete and Geri Czorny,a vetern canadian guide and cook. I went a number of years to a resort they operated on Amphiban Lake and always caught lots of large fish.They are two of the nicest people in the resort business.I'm very glad they have their own resort now .The lake and river system their lodge is on ,hasn't been fished for six years,so fishing should be excellent.I will post a report after going there in AugustLarry"
511975,Guest,2001-04-20 19:44:00,0,"Up north if the fish are biting, they'll bite on anything. The standards are len thompson spoons, no. 1 or 2, either in red/white or five of diamonds. Rapala rattle 'n rap also work well for pike, but take 1 treble off, or you'll feel like you're wasting time getting hooks out of mouths. Take some jigs and plastic bodies (white & chartreuse) nothing fancy is required. If you need lighter spoons, lucky strike makes a 5 or 6 hook set taht is very cheap (about $11 cdn.) You can take anything else you want, but with the above, you'll have all you need."
511976,Northern Manitoban,2001-04-22 06:57:00,195,Hello Larry i live in Thompson what lodge are you talking about? If you need any info on Fishing around Thompson drop me a line.FISH ON.
511977,Larry,2001-04-22 14:36:00,357,"Northern Manitoban,I'm going to the former Seven Lakes Lodge,on Natawahunan Lake.The lodge was bought by Pete and Geri Czorny and is now called Pete and Geri's Place. This will be the first year that it has been operated in about six years as a fishing lodge. Pete and Geri are terrific people,and as I said in previous postings run a great operation .I'll be up August 17 to 24th to do some fishing and relaxing Do you work in the fishing industry? or run a camp?I'll be getting in on thursday night to Thompson at about 830pm,then heading out on a float plane to the lodge the next morningLarry"
511978,Guest,2001-04-22 19:39:00,0,"I am also going to Pete and Geri's place to fish in June. Pete and Geri do a great job of running their lodge. I went to Amphiban Lodge for 3 years when they ran it. Looking forward to some great fishing at their newly owned lodge, LDJ"
511979,Northern Manitoban,2001-04-22 20:23:00,195,"Larry,i'm not familiar with that lake is it somewhere off the churchill river or hayes river? i would like to get into guiding one day or even have a bed and breakfast.I trophy fish throughout Manitoba for Walleye's, Lakers, rainbows ,Pike.and will be going for some big cats on the Red river this year.Just got back saturday ice fishing on Reed lake for lakers we lost alot landed 4 only around 7 pounds had some bigones one broke my partners line.If your in Thompson for a day i would gladly take you out fishing and its all free,we have alot of lakes around here and hardly any distance only minutes away.The fishing is great here,but august is usually the slow month probably not for most but from what i'm used too.I fish 2 to 3 days a week.Email me if you want any info.Dave."
511980,Larry S,2001-04-23 17:08:00,666,"Northern Manitoban,Pet & Geri's resort is on Natawahunan Lake 20 miles east of Thompson on the Grass River System Its near Partridge Crop Lake. Thanks for the fishing invite I get in Thursday nite ,and leave for the camp early friday morning Hope you can realize your dream of being a guideLarry S"
511981,Northern Manitoban,2001-04-23 19:36:00,195,"thanks Larry,i ice fish wintering lake which is part of Partridge crop and the grassy river system,if you ever get a chance go to paint lake marina great fishing and beach camping areas and small cabins its very nice there,planning on purchasing a cabin there as my home base for fishing.Paint lake is all part of the Grassy its a huge lake.Dave."
511982,Guest,2001-04-24 15:09:00,0,Question for Larry S. and/or northern Manitban.Are the place's you are talking about have equal fishing to say Misaw ?How about price's?
511983,Larry S,2001-04-25 16:28:00,666,"Mike,I haven't fished the lake or the area we are talking about.As you can tell from the messages,Pete & Geri's Place is near Thompson, Manitoba not as far as Misaw Lake The species ther are northern pike,walleye,perch and whitefish.No lake trout or grayling as at Misaw I'm pretty sure the pike are of good size,also the walleye should be quite large The price for a week at Pete & Geri's is 1600 without a guide I'll e-mail you when I get back from there in August I'm sure you will catch a lot of large pike and trout at Misaw.Be sure to fish for the grayling,flies or very small,size oo spinners.Mepps and Panther Martin are good spinners Larry"
511964,Guest,2001-04-15 08:21:00,0,I just booked a trip to northern Sas. in mid June to fish pike and trout.Any info on what lures and other items to take?First time fly out. What is the weather like then? Thanks in advance.
511965,Northern Manitoban,2001-04-15 12:24:00,195,"What lake Wollaston maybe? if so your in for some great action.For gear i would bring a 5 of diamonds,Daredevil spoons,Halfwave,cyclops,Northernking silver spoons,bucktail jigs white and chartruese.In june the ice wouldn't have been off long the lakers will be in the shallows along shorelines and reafs even suspended very shallow in deep water.And they will be very aggressive,There is some monster pike up that way i don't think you will have a problem catching a trophy or 2.Make sure you have good fresh line on your reels.You will need it.Good luck.FISH ON."
511966,whitey,2001-04-16 04:23:00,36,"Reindeer???definitly take spoons. but also take some jerk baits and rattle traps. We caught alot of trout trolling the traps. also some rubbers...I mean rubber baits like slugo's. One of my fav's is a mepps' spinner with a rubber minnow imbeded on the back of it. It trolls nice for trout and is king of weedless, so works good on the pick in the shallows. Have a great time. I've been up to that area 5 times....it's a blast."
511967,4bigfish,2001-04-16 19:50:00,25,"Try Len Thompson # 2 spoons. Red and White or 5 of diamonds. Great on pike and trout. I live in northern Saskatchewan and thats all I use.Weather could vary, take a rain jacket for sure. Should be reasonably warm.Good luck,Mark[email protected]www.4bigfish.com"
511968,Guest,2001-04-17 13:40:00,0,"Thanks for the info guys. I am staying atMisaw Lake Lodge. First trip of the season for them, can not wait!Keith Kavajecz taped a show there, it was on tv a couple weeks ago but I do not have cable.Thought about Lindberghs on Reineer and Laurie River Lodge"
511969,Tyler,2001-04-19 05:57:00,3,"Mike,I am also booked for 2002 at Misaw. Pleae provide a trip report when you get back. It's going to a long year and half wait."
511970,Guest,2001-04-19 16:18:00,0,"Tyler, sounds good, I will post soon as I get back the week of 6/25."
511971,Larry S,2001-04-20 04:29:00,666,"Went to Misaw Lake Lodge in 1990,fishing was excellent.The Lodge had a different owner back then.The cabins were small,the new owner has completly re-done all the cabins We used five-diamonds,and black-white pattern dardeveles,Len Thompson spoons,and large rapalas with great success for pike.Largest pike going 46plus inches.Lake Trout liked large flatfish,same spoons as pike,and rapalas.Also don't forget the grayling fisherey.We caught lots of grayling after diner in the river,which is a short boat ride from camp,small spinners,and flies work well .I'm thinking of going back next year,so kep us informed on how you do this yearLarry"
511972,Guest,2001-04-20 10:19:00,0,"Larry, thanks for the info. 11 years later the fish should be bigger!!!! Does Bass Pro or Cabelas carry Len Thompson spoons ?Ihave not seen them yet."
511973,duffy,2001-04-20 16:27:00,49,"Mike,I just ordered Len thompson spoons direct. Cabelas has some stock but not the correct sizes. Go to www.lenthompson.com. You can order them off the net. I would suggest calling them and ask for Greg. He helped me pick the right colors and sizes for the type of trip I am taking. He is very helpfull. He even threw in a few free spoons after I placed my order. Tell him Sean sent you and you want some free spoons. The phone number is on the web site. Good luck and post a report when you get back.Duffy"
