This year we ran into a little bump. Four of the main guys are heavy into the stock market and because of the recent slide, they don't have their slush money for this years trip. I talked to the owner on Saturday and he asked me if I could find a group to replace ours, I told him that I would give it a shot. This is why I need some help from you. I need a group to replace ours at the end of june (prime time). June 17-24 You can look at their web site at www.happy-landing-lodge.com and get the Phone Number from there.Good Fishin'Richard"
