If you want to go up north into the shield, try Jim's Camp's at Stanley Mission or Thompson's camps at Otter Lake. You can drive or fly. I've been to both. Accomodations are good (and fairly priced) and the fishing both walleye and pike is good."
511726,Guest,2001-04-21 22:12:00,0,"My Choices would be www.janlakelodge.com ,excellent walleye fishing, make sure to hire a guide(for the first day to show you the lake) and you will have no problem catching a limit of walleye per day. I have stayed at this lodge and trust me you will not be dissapointed!!!P.SIf you want to taste the best walleye in the world go to northern Saskatchewan. Tobin Lake(polluted), Deifenbeiker, and any other lake south of Prince Albert do not even compare when it comes to taste!!!"

511715,Guest,2001-03-27 14:27:00,0,A couple of us here in SE Montana are looking for a good place to go up after the elusive walleye in Saskatchewan. We are looking for a place with good fishing and reasonably priced accomodations (isn't everyone).Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
511716,PWaldow123,2001-03-27 17:08:00,198,"Try a place called Jan Lake. It is located about 40 minutes north of Flin Flon Manitoba. They have a couple of Rustic Lodges there, not sure of all the names, but I know one of them is called the Great North Lodge. Haven't fished there in a couple of years, as it's a long way from home, but have personally caught 40-50 walleyes per hour on that lake. For more info email me and I'll give you what I have."
511717,Guest,2001-03-27 18:22:00,0,"Hey, I have fished Jan Lake many, many times since 1984 & I have never heard of 40-50 fish per hour.Where in the world were you at on the lake? I would be very interested. Also, Jan is 50 miles due West of Flin Flon,Mb.Lets share info if you wish, Thanks"

511719,Guest,2001-03-28 05:16:00,0,"If you do not want to drive all day, you could go to SaskatchewanLanding. Bob Glover has an outfitting service at Beaver Flats. They just started last year so the prices are very reasonable. The fishing varies depending on the time of year you want to go. Your best chance at a trophy fish is between May and early July, before the runoff from the mountains comes and raises water levels. Bob's number can be found in either the Kyle or Swift Current directory. Good Luck!"

511723,Kannata,2001-04-03 17:15:00,20,If your looking for big walleye's there are only three places to go:1) Last Mountain lake with a great fall bite and a super summer crank bite bite.2) Lake Diefenbaker in the spring.3) Tobin (on the river) in the late fall.If you want small dinks but large numbers go to all those other places.Kannata
