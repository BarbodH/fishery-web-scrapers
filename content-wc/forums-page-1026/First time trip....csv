512021,Guest,2001-04-16 05:31:00,0,My dad and I are flying out to Crayon Lake with some buddies to do some fishing for a week. This is our first time fishing for Pike and Waleye. What can we expect? What kind of lures do you recomend? Just need to know the basics...Trip is at the begining of June. Thanks Nate
512022,Guest,2001-04-16 08:35:00,0,"NateCouple of things for Walleyes1. Jigs tipped with monnows in green, orange, or white. I like you use a skirt with them. Probalbly 1/4-3/8 oz.2. Bottom bouncers tipped with moinnows back trolled very slowly. Once you catch some fish throw out marker buoy and start jigging.Jeff"
512023,Northern Manitoban,2001-04-16 12:02:00,195,"Bottom bouncing is great for covering water and when you do find them and they start biting,yes throw out the marker but don't stop and jig.First turn the boat around and troll over that same spot have done this many times and have spent hours trolling back and forth over the same spot catching them,if that doesn't work then i will try jigging.Or when they do stop biting then i will stop on that spot and jig.FISH ON."
512024,IaCraig,2001-04-16 12:43:00,434,"For Walleye's, I agree with the other recommendations drifting with bottom bouncers from 12 - 40 ' deep, and marker bouys are a must so you can keep on them. I would add that you should find a depth map of the lake you will be fishing so you can find these submerged humps where the eye's hold out. If you want to do some casting. In june I have had great success with silver(not chrome) rattletraps (5/8 oz or bigger). They dive maybe 10 - 12 feet deep and work great for pike over submerged weedbeds, Smallmouth bass if casted towards rocks on shore or Walleyes if fished near a drop-off. You never know what will hit them! Also take some good spoons(5 of diamonds is my favorite).Wishing you Lots-a-Luck & Lots-a-fun IaCraig"
512025,Guest,2001-04-17 20:36:00,0,"You don't tell us how old you are,but if it's your first trip, you are probably pretty young. Sounds like you will be the junior member of the team. Good chance you'll get outvoted. Go with the flow and have fun. Be sure you have lots of snacks and drinks. Take lures that you can cast, like daredevil spoons and spinner baits. If things get slow you can cast the weed lines and bays for a few jackfish. Take some small hooks, split shot, and a few slip bobbers. Practice making bobber stop knots. Read about lindy rigs and practice making them . Learn how to snell your own hooks. Find out what the other guys will have and try to have the same kind of stuff. If you do your homework and practice these things, you will be able to show the older guys that you are a good fisherman. You might even be able to show them a few things. Be rigged and ready and have a good trip."

512027,IaCraig,2001-04-19 13:19:00,434,"Nate, a bit of trivia......Do you know what GORD meant by jackfish? I'm 40 years old and a couple years ago my dad used that term on me for the 1st time in reference to a Pike. I have heard pike called Northerns, slime monsters, toothy critters, water wolves along with some colorfully adjectives that I won't repeat here, but the jackfish was new to me. Also, learn how to tie your snells, leaders and lindy rigs so you can quickly make them while on the water. Because if you pretie very many and stick them in your tacklebox you will have a mess. Have fun Nate, and teach the old farts something newIaCraig"
512028,Guest,2001-04-23 13:33:00,0,"IaCraig: jackfish is a name we have in saskatchewan. As a kid, i did not even know this was a nickname. If they're small, we also call them hammer handles.Nate: For pike, a few basic spoons (len thompson red/white and five of diamonds) and some rapala rattle n' rap, and a blue fox vibrax spinner or two will be all you need.For the eyes, every guy has his own must-have's. I think most will agree to take some jig heads (1/8, 1/4, 3/8 oz.), some plastic bodies (white, yellow, chartreuse), and some sort of spinner and/or lindy rigs. If it's your first trip, keep to the basic's. If the eyes are biting, you'll do fine with these."
