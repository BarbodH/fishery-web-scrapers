Thank You everyone that shares their experiences. 28 Days & counting!

We have had great luck in the area where the Wenasaga River comes in as well as Sawmill bay and small islands nearby. I don't think that the Wenasaga opens until June 1 because it is a designated spawning area, but you can fish the outlet area to the lake.Good luck, and let us know how you do up there.Bob"
