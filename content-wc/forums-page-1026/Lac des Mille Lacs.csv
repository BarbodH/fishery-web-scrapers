512179,PJM,2001-04-29 19:38:00,3516,"The only map they make is from the MNR I believe an I think it was from like 1974. I called the MNR and to find a map and this is the best one. It has some contour of the lake, but it could use more. Like in Bolton bay there is all kinds of structure but it not on the map. I called about 7 months ago but maybe they have a new map now."
512180,Frank from TBay,2001-04-30 14:36:00,312,The depth map available for Lac has a lot missing but is still better than no map at all. Your outfitter may have them or you can check with Curries Copy Shop in Thunder Bay. Their phone number is 807 6234646. I'm sure they can send you one out.There is a new map being made in the next couple of years that is going to have great accuracy. It has been in the planning stages for around 10 years. There are now parties committed to its making. It is a huge job with lots of vollunteer hours.The money raised on its sale will go to worthy projects on the lake. I look forward to seeing it when it is complete.
