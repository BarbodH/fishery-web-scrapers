Any suggestions? I have been looking into Athapapuskow. Has anyone fished it. Is it worth the drive. Is there a lot of trout pike and walleye and how big are they? Are there other lakes in the area that you could go to to get better pike and walleye fishing, from what I here Athapapuskow is mostly a trout lake. Any help would be greatly appreciated."

511523,Guest,2001-03-20 12:18:00,0,"Brian, Go to Reed Lake. There is a fairly new camp there and the lake is full of big walleye, pike, and trout. It's part of the Grass River system, so it's about as far north as Athapap. I have fished their several times and have always done well with all three species."
511524,Brian,2001-03-20 16:33:00,140,"Mark I heard alot about Reed lake. What time of year do you go or recommend going up there? Are there any special regs to note(i.e certain areas that cannot be fished till a certain date)? Also what quality/quantity of fish do you usually catch, especially Northerns? Lastly how are the numbers of people? Thanks again, Brian"
511525,Northern Manitoban,2001-03-20 20:41:00,195,"You want big fish go to Reed lake Big northerns,Lakers,Walleyes,whitefish.I went there last June for 5 days 2 guys we landed over 100 lakers 3 trophys,16 lbs was our biggest didn't get that 40 pounder.We will be there this May around the 26th for another 5 days.Great campsite you can catch the lakers not to far from the boat launch,and the pike are all over there is a good shallow weedy bay where the float planes land and its full of them.so many areas to try,and you don't have to go far,we were fishing for lakers but we did manage to snag 2 pike niether one of them was under 10 lbs there is some monsters in there and that is what Reed is known for.I go there in the spring and fall.plan on going ice fishing there in a couple weeks.Email me if you want more info.FISH ON."

Many a trailer has lost it's axle due to the road going in..very rough and your trailer will thank you for not going on it. If you like your paint ON the trailer, this is NOT the place to go. Last year, our group had a few troubles. One rig lost broke it's axle...ended up going to Flin Flon and getting one made. 6 hours later, they finally made it in. The second group came up and pushed a roller through boat hull. A little too much weight on one spot helped that though...still not fun. The trip north of Cranberry portage is about 40 miles (of washboards and dirt) or so to Sherridan. Keep the boat contents light and if you can, get a guard of some kind or you will have lots of paint missing."
511527,PWaldow123,2001-04-29 18:37:00,198,Has happened to me! It's not a whole lot of fun. Those roads up in Flin Flon are not good.:-(
