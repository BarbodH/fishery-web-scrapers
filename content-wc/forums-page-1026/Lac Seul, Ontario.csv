512046,Guest,2001-04-27 03:11:00,0,"I believe you will find the best musky fishing northeast of Chamberlain Narrows. Anderson's have a flyin cabin there that is quite nice. We have fished there and while we did not get any really large muskies we did get some, even a double. The party that was there when we came in had some very nice trophy size muskies. Too bad they didn't leave them for others to enjoy too but..... Lots of 'eyes and northern also. The area is also fairly sheltered so wind is generally not an issue.TLY"
512047,Guest,2001-04-27 05:28:00,0,isn't there a 50 inch size limit on muskies?
512048,MNBS,2001-04-27 09:12:00,13,Lac Suel is catch and release only for muskies.
512055,Guest,2001-04-28 16:53:00,0,"angle_eyes....I appreciate your response and help with the area around Tuk Bay. When you mentioned half way up Tuk Bay and the east shore, do you mean going west, say from three sisters, into Tuk Bay and the channel about half way up (west) that turns north? Then trolling the east shore of the n-s channel that runs into the northern part of Tuk Bay.Also, what did you use for trolling. Lindy rig, shad raps, etc.Thanks so much. I'm getting real excited about going up there.eyesnatcher...."
512056,Guest,2001-04-28 18:19:00,0,"Yes, sorry I was not more specific. On the east shore of the section that runs north-south. About half way in there is a fairly large cove for that part of the bay. We will troll that shoreline with Hot & Tots, and shad raps. Often we will find a spot and jig with a round head (white, gold, orange, red) tipped with a minnow. The fishing can be tremendous........ its a fantastic fishery."
512049,RMB,2001-04-29 19:33:00,251,Isn't the Muskie fishing strictly catch and release there?
512041,Guest,2001-04-17 16:49:00,0,"Could someone tell me the main forage in Lac Seul. Will be fishing the Chamberlain Narrows in late May. Is it crayfish, smelt, herron, yellow perch, etc?Will be fishing mostly for 'eyes. Have been using trolling tactics the last few years and would like to match the food of choice.Thanks in advance....eyesnatcher"
512042,Russ Warye,2001-04-18 06:37:00,8,"The Lac Seul forage base is largely cisco, lake whitefish, emerald shiner, chubs, white sucker, juvenile yellow perch, brook stickeback, logperch and trout perch. I am not aware of a crayfish forage component, and it has not come up in my conversations with Ministry biologists. From personal observation, I have seen walleye disgorging shiners, small yellow perch and cisco - perhaps 3 ro 4 inches long, as we brought them to the surface.Congratulations - being at Chamberlain in May is like going to ""walleye"" heaven, because on an average year during the opening day period a lot of post-spawn fish are holding in the narrows and available current. Just completed a new manuscript for Fishing Hot Spots, titled WALLEYE: The Top Fisheries of North America...and Lac Seul is obviously in it.RussSr. Research Editor"
512043,Guest,2001-04-18 08:17:00,0,"How does one get access to the ""manuscript"" of Top Walleye Fisheries."
512050,Russ Warye,2001-04-18 10:35:00,8,"Thanks for the inquiry. FHS hopes to have it printed by late July. We are in the formatting stage now. In fact, have been selecting photos, consulting with the artist...and doing all that fun stuff after the writing and research is over.Russ"
512044,Guest,2001-04-19 05:36:00,0,"Thanks Russ for the information. I would really like to get a copy of your publication when available. Will you post here on WC when available?Also, on the forage you mentioned, what are the basis colors say for; cisco, yellow perch is obvious, and shiners are probably silver with dark back. At least based on the colors here in MO. We always take minnows with us, however, the last few years have been successful trolling. So, wanted to match as closely as possible the colors that will attract walleyes.Appreciate your response....eyesnatcher"
512051,Guest,2001-04-19 16:10:00,0,"Have done well with leeches on a light leader with slip sinkers. Drifting, casting into structure, retrieving to deep, or vertical jigging.You really need to try skidoo point, which is south of Chamberlain. If you come by boat you go right by it. It is just east of 3 sister and the first point out of Bear Narrows. It amazingly has an abandoned snowmobile on the point altho notreally super visible. Depending on wind, drift in any direction crossing the point and following the structure. Lots of big fish early. Also there is structure out several hundred yards to drift. Have also done well with little cleo's either vertical jig or a very slow retrieve.There are many other prime places within a few miles of there as well. You will have a great time.Luck, and wish we were there.TLY"
512052,Russ Warye,2001-04-19 17:27:00,8,"Eyesnatcher - I certainly agree from my experience on Seul (about 12 trips)that minnows are the way to go early in the season - from opening day in May through mid-June. After that period, both nightcrawlers and leeches have done well for us. Our crankbait patterns have been chrome with blue, clown patterns are the most extreme, but anything that duplicates a ""shad"" color. I don't believe crankbait color is terribly important as long as its natural. We have done well with Shad Raps, ThunderSticks, Bomber Long-A's...and am anxious to try the Tail Dancers somewhere (still have ice in Northern Wisconsin). Also, these are objective statements about the lures - not sponsored by any of them. It helps keep me objective! Jigs, rigs, bottom bouncers with bait, and trolling crankbaits have done well, although I have to admit I'm partial to jigging.Have fun...and never overlook Wapesi Bay, Birch Narrows and Pine Island for eyes.Russ"
512053,Guest,2001-04-19 17:55:00,0,"TLY.... appreciate your response. I have fished around that area some and know where skidoo point is located. Never done real good there, but maybe not fishing it right. I'm still a novice when it comes to walleye and trying real hard to learn. Any of the other points you could tell me about would be greatly appreciated. I have maps of that area so reference would be easy. My email is [email protected] if you would care to email me, it would be greatly appreciated.Russ: thanks again for your help.eyesnatcher"
512054,Guest,2001-04-25 08:03:00,0,"You should troll the shoreline north of bear narrows and southwest of three sisters. Also Tuk bay, east side of bay about halfway up. I can't begin to count the 25""+ eyes we have spanked there. Oh ya, troll Kakabeka narrows, north shoreline, watched my cabin neighbor pull a 30.5"", 10lb+ from there last year."
512045,Guest,2001-04-26 09:00:00,0,"Where is the best Muskie fishing on Lac Seul, I have been told that it is at Chamberlain Narrows and is there a resort at chamberlain narrows by the same name?"
