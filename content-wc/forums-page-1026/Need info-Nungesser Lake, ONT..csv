512116,ET,2001-04-23 18:32:00,120,"Was at Nungesser lake lodge 3 and 4 years ago... Walleye and Pike of course. Both can be excellent at the right toimes. VEry Common to catch several huge walleye and tons of eater size. Jigs/minnows are the standard and Flashy baits for pike. Nice Accomodations, very nice/helpful dockhands. The only thing I could not understand is why so many people fished in the same areas. You are in Canada.. so give a guy some room. At times you could walk across the boats in the Nungesser River (far end of lake) They supplied maps and had a nice map in the boathouse. There is some areas of open water that will get rough in the wind, so keep that in mind. Seemed like the ride back at the end of the day was brutal.. Look for first weeds if you are going early season"
512117,Riceburner,2001-04-24 22:22:00,436,"Thanks for the help. We'll be at the same lodge--July 13-19, so imagine the fish will be deeper than earlier summer. Is the water stained? Any plug bite? Any other water coming in, other than the River you mentioned..?? Have some other questions too-would you mind e-mailing me??? THX. [email protected]"
