512154,Swede,2001-04-27 16:50:00,17,"To Mean Mike: Any year where all the tourists stay home is a bad year for bugs. Sort of depends on from whose point of view this is discussed.Frank: Thanks for the earlier info re: the route into Beaverhouse. If I see ya at Moose's Fish Camp, I'll buy you one - your choice! - about June 12 or 20.Stay upright and dry."

512162,Frank from TBay,2001-04-27 19:06:00,312,I've got reports from three of the larger lakes in the Thunder Bay area. In the boys best guess we are still a minimum of two weeks away from any sort of open water. They were still hauling Ice shacks at Lac Des Mille Lacs this last week. We are getting a lot of warm weather in the next while so the weatherman says....hopefully this speeds things up a bit.
512148,Frank from TBay,2001-04-25 17:24:00,312,"Temperature was over 60f today and sunny. In the last week we had a snow storm, suntanning weather and torrential rain. The lakes are still frozen solid, I have patches of green grass in area around the house and I saw my first mosquito today......... biggg......... I think he was a scout for the hordes that are sure to follow.It's been a long winter and I cannot wait for open water."

512151,Mean Mike,2001-04-26 02:42:00,115,"Northerners, what conditions result in a bad year for bugs vs. a good year for bugs?"
512152,Frank from TBay,2001-04-26 02:48:00,312,Lots of snow and moisture give lots of breeding sites for bugs. In 1996 we had a lot of snow in the bush and a slow start like this year. The bugs were terrible. It has all the makings of a banner bug year. Things can change it like a dry summer but the general rule is if it is warm and there is moisture there will be lots of bugs.
512153,Guest,2001-04-26 12:20:00,0,The best conditions exist the week I go to the Boundry Waters. TGG
512155,Guest,2001-04-26 12:23:00,0,Hey Frank!!! How about giving us a daily progress report on ice out. I've got a trout and northern trip scheduled for May 5th. We will be heading just north of Atikoken. TGG
512156,BD,2001-04-26 18:05:00,739,Ever stop at Finlayson (camp 113)?
512157,PJM,2001-04-26 20:32:00,3516,FrankI have a question for you about boating in Canada. I do have a floating rope but it seem the longest I could find is 25 feet. If I need a 50 foot rope can I tie two of them togather. Second question is I have carried a flare gun in my boat for years and is it against the law in Canada to have one in your boat. Some one posted that it was a concealed weapon if you had one in your boat.
512158,Frank from TBay,2001-04-27 03:04:00,312,I do no know about the rope. Flare guns are common on our waters here. They are not illegal. The only ones I understand that would be a problem are ones that could possibly shoot regular 12ga ammo. If you are in doubt about the gun you have check with the RCMP or OPP in Ontario. They will advise you.
