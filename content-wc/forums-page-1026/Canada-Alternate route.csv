512100,Guest,2001-04-22 08:04:00,0,Thinking about crossing the border at Rainey River instead of International Falls (long lines on Saturdays). What's the best route to Baudette out of Milwaukee? I'm going to Kenora and don't mind an extra hour as long as I'm moving! That line at I.F.last year was endless. Thanks
512101,Guest,2001-04-22 11:22:00,0,Here's a suggestion. We cross before 4:00am on Saturdays. No lines.
512102,Walley Guide,2001-04-22 16:26:00,67,"I agree with crossing the boarder early in the morning. The process is so much better. The last 5 or 6 years we started out to make sure we cross before sunrise. One year we crossed at 1 a.m., the only problem was driving through Canada in the dark. We missed the landscape and had to miss too many animals in the road...Enjoy!Walley"
512103,Kaz,2001-04-23 04:49:00,643,"You don't want to drive to Baudette to cross!!! It's about 70 miles over and the Canadian road to Kenora is not that good. Drive time over and back is not ""Time Effective"", Take my word.. Early dark AM is the best!!!!...Good luck fishing...Kaz"
512104,Guest,2001-04-24 06:42:00,0,"Just how long was ""endless""? Making our first trip Mat 26th. Our timetable puts us @I.F.about 7 or 8AM Maybe the guys will have to get off work a little early to avoid sitting in the line too long."
512107,Guest,2001-04-25 03:48:00,0,If your really set ontraveling over to Baudette to cross border. Go up your normal route to International Falls and take cut off road just south of Fisherman/Int'l Skillet (airport rd.) to 71/11 west turns into 11 west @ Pelland to Baudette.I would agree with others. The distance over to Baudette and back east again to pick up Canada 71 would not be worth it. I have also crossed very early in I.F. Drive all night Friday find a place to sleep withing an hour of I.F.I crossed last June at Baudette for first time. The lack of trafic confused me from what I'm used to at Buffalo and I.F. I drove through the gate without stopping. Needless to say the officers were less than pleased!
512105,Guest,2001-04-25 09:35:00,0,"last year - 24 june 2000, 10:00am line of vehicles and vehicles trailing boats over a mile long!"
512106,GetTheNet,2001-04-25 09:52:00,29,"Should have no trouble @ 7am in May. June is the worst month and even then not much of a line @ 7am. The trick is to get to the border before the crowd commuting from the twin cities (5-6 hrs south) gets here. A few drive through the night but most get on the road between 3 and 6am, putting them here @ between 8am and noon. Man you do not want to pull into the Falls @ 10am on a Sat in June. I've seen the line 4 miles long. Even with all lanes open @ the border, you are looking @ 2 hours of idling."
512108,Guest,2001-04-25 15:37:00,0,Thanks for all the feedback---We will leave earlier so we arrive in I.F. by 6AM. By the way last year second Saturday in June line at 3PM was almost two miles!
