2766697,tshea,2014-05-07 07:48:00,36,Does anyone actually know where the money for the AFC Gouin is going or what it is used for? Every year I find the price of the AFC permit goes up ($85 last year I think) and the fishing gets worse. They haven't posted and financial statements since 2010 and Quebec is not particularly well known for scrupulous use of public funds Also curious as to what the fine would be if someone were to be caught without one. The members of my camp dole out over $1000/year to this organization with no representation or accountability.http://www.afcgouin.ca/corporation.html Thanks Todd.

From what I've learned the money funds the policing staff and supports a hatchery project. One thing I've learned about permits and/or taxation...it never goes down, lol. (anywhere on planet earth) For those that use outfitters, complaining to them, is about the best we can do. For those with private cabins, I don't know who should ask for info. BTW, I am pretty sure that there is a building moratorium on the Gouin...has been in place for quite a while. I am not concerned about an extra CA$ 40 for the week if it aids the reservoir."

Are all native born Quebec residents not equal?? Why does the First Nation, in the year 2014, not follow fishing laws like other Quebec residents?? Conservation needs to be practiced by all. Nuff said."
