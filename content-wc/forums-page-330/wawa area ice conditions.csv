2813177,northsky99,2014-05-19 17:08:00,41,Its the weekend sleeping in late and staying up all night Good luck and have fun Fish On :fr
2760081,pwbmlr,2014-05-05 11:00:00,37,Anyone have any updates on the wawa area? I fly out 5/24 with Hawk Air and haven't seen an updates to some of the lakes up there. I email the outfitter but haven't heard back yet.
2760257,northsky99,2014-05-05 11:59:00,41,Checkout Canadianfishing.com They have two web cams set up in the chapleau area. Looks like the ice is just starting to melt. Fish on
2760281,Mike Borger,2014-05-05 12:10:00,1554,Hey thanks for that! Wawa Lake also has a webcam but it hasn't been updated since March 31.
2760481,Algoma Guy,2014-05-05 13:28:00,48,You might be cutting it close. If the lake you are flying into is stained and shallower you will probably be OK. If the lake is clearer and deeper you might have a problem. The Oba river which feeds Kaby lake is a little farther north than Wawa and is still locked tight which is very unusual for this time of year.
2763273,Mike Borger,2014-05-06 08:59:00,1554,Looking at those webcams it's amazing how much the ice has deteriorated in less than 24 hours. I'll bet it's completely gone within 3 days.
2790665,Guest,2014-05-13 13:59:00,0,I understand that Hawk Lake is free of ice but haven' heard about any of the outpost camps. They intend to check on the outpost camps later this week. I fly out on the 17th so that ice had better be melting fast. Keep your fingers crossed.
2790937,polaris-pete,2014-05-13 15:15:00,343,The ice is gone. There are boats running the Chapleau River and the 1 Webcam I have watched them puttting in 3 floating docks.If in doubt CALL your Air Service or your Outfitter.
2808337,Cumminsram2010,2014-05-18 11:11:00,396,Any news on prairie bee lake is the ice gone? What's the water temp?
2811273,MrSimon,2014-05-19 09:29:00,922,Just got off the phone with Bob (owner of Happy Day and Prairie Bee camps) and the ice is completely off both lakes .... went off last week he said.
2811529,Cumminsram2010,2014-05-19 10:20:00,396,Great news! I wonder what the eyes will be doing this weekend?
