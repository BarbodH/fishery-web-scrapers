2800577,HeHooksHimself,2014-05-16 05:03:00,725,"Our destination, Wine Lake Camp, officially moved their opening week back to the 24th. We mace a decision several weeks ago to move it back anyway since they had an opening. Our group shrunk from 6 to 2. Five days til we leave (can't count today or the day you are leaving....). We hope we don't get caught in post spawn"
