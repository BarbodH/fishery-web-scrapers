2800433,2746,2014-05-16 04:19:00,3206,The thread is not about WHETHER you take a kid fishing.....of course you do! The thread is about whether you force your kid into a group that does not want him.....of course you don't.
2800745,CPDFisherman,2014-05-16 05:57:00,212,"It appears that many people are missing the entire story. As the OP posted above, they have other trips that are family oriented. It is just this particular trip that is adults only."
2801273,Guest,2014-05-16 07:48:00,0,"Guess I'm curious. What age is appropriate for a son to see his father get drunk, cuss like a sailor, and talk about the his Vegas hookers? Maybe 16 or 17 would be better? To tell the truth, I have friends that like to get drunk, cuss, brag about their exploits, etc. That gets old after a while and personally, I'd rather be around a 14 year old. My son first went at 13 (had his 14th birthday while on the trip), out fished a few of the old guys, cleaned fish, did more than his share of the cooking and camp work, carried his own weight and helped out others and everyone had a great time. The new guy should have asked permission but the problem shouldn't be about a 14 yr. old kid. You should welcome the kid and maybe you'll learn a thing or two."
2801649,hawg,2014-05-16 09:05:00,2008,That same issue has ended some of the funnest trips I've ever been on and is now breaking up our hunting camp we've had for almost 30 years. Everybody has their own opinion but it does end things.
2801833,forgop,2014-05-16 09:48:00,880,What I have yet to hear from the OP is whether the rest of the group has the same opinion or whether he's alone in his cantankerous views. Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-N900A using Tapatalk

Makes me sick to see that people not wanting to take younger guys fishing. I will never forget my first trip up north, the younger guys should be welcomed and shown what's its all about. It is a fishing and outdoor adventure not a drunkfest. I am only 25 but I would never tell a young guy he couldn't go and fish and learn about nature and how to catch fish. I understand it the guys trip and everything but who is going to carry on the tradition after your old grouchy a** is gone? Guess it won't be your kids hope someone else has the sense to teach the younger generation how to do it."
2769625,nitrox21,2014-05-07 17:54:00,2,"Two sides to the issue. Many think you are right on the no kid thing. Personally I agree with the rest of your group. They don't seem to have an issue with bringing along the 14 year old, after all none of the rest of the guys appear to have a problem with the guy bringing his son. So really how strict is the rule no kids anyway? I have been going to Canada the last ten or twelve years and frankly I welcomed the 14 year old, great experience for him and he was a great help with gear and the over all experience. Watching him on this first time trip was actually a highlight for me, quite entertaining to me as his eyes were bulging out as he fought many monster pike and walleye. He is 19 now and has an open invitation anytime he wants to join the group."
2773169,schoolofhardknocks,2014-05-08 14:20:00,29,"I do many activities with different types of people and each has it's unspoken rules. For example, I walk with a group of guys and someone wanted to bring his wife. I was the first one to say NO. We even call it a men's walk. It really is a men's therapy walk and if we brought a woman or one of our kids it would be a different group. I have been going to Canada for fly-ins about once or twice a year for 30 years and have done it both ways. I go with my wife in the Spring and with my son in the fall. I've also gone with ""the guys."" I don't even want to bring one of my son's friend with because this time is very special for my son and myself. We had years (teen years) where he barely talked to me, but we went fishing. Now he says it is the best time of his year, just the two of us. If I went with the guys, which is the subject of the post, I would NOT want a son or daughter to come with because it WOULD change the climate and yes, guys would talk and act differently and what can I say, we just wouldn't be able to regress for a week, which is therapeutic in itself. Bottom line, you might have to suck it up and just go for it with the kid. There should have been a discussion but I bet that it would have been very difficult if not impossible for you to have the guts to exclude the kid. The reality is that it WILL be a different trip, but the group either has to say no and live with that or let the innocent boy come with and then the GROUP needs to be mature and show him a good time."
2773217,LoDo,2014-05-08 14:37:00,721,"Had I not been invited to go with my father at age 6,7,8, etc.... I'm not sure id be going today. My dad introducing me to fishing Canada was one of the best things he has done for me. I'm a smart guy, good job, etc....and will continue this tradition as long as I can. Question for you. Do you ski? I ask because my dad doesn't. He's 61 and it's far too late for him to learn. I learned at 18. Those that don't get introduced to Canada at a young age will never spend the money and do it for the first time at an older age. Same goes for my father and skiing. My two cents!"
2773449,Guest,2014-05-08 15:41:00,0,"Your skiing analogy is missing the point. NO ONE is saying that kids shouldn't be introdued into, in this case, Canada. The entire point of this is the way the dad forced his way onto an already eatablished group. The group has set rules and the newb refused to adhere to them. You guys missing the point are making thia out that no one wants to take kids on a trip. That is not the case"
2773513,JAY221,2014-05-08 16:00:00,877,"The title to this original post is kind of misleading. The dad that wants to change the rules ought to go off on there own trip upon arrival.Later, Jay"
2798449,CMesserschmidt,2014-05-15 12:35:00,1006,"Here is my take on this....First off, have you talked to the other guys in the group and gathered their thoughts??? I think if everyone says NO.....then the group should have a meeting and just be honest with the guy. Just tell him, it's nothing against his kid or anything, it's just the rules of this group trip.NOW.... I remember like others have said, when I got to go with my dad and grandpa and uncles on the first deer hunt or whatever and only adults or guys were allowed. My dad basically told me, that if I repeated anything I saw or said, I wouldn't be welcomed any more. I am 32 now and loved every minute of it. I heard cussing like no other, and saw my first porn mag haha! My dad even brought my buddy with when we were 17. He still talks about how much fun it was to this day. I never repeated anything to my mom and I loved every minute of those trips. I shut up because I never wanted to be left home!If the group says they don't care if the kids goes, then let him role with. It was a group vote. Now go read the ""Prankster"" thread and get some ideas lol! Think of it like this..... you just got out of dish duty! I work in schools sometimes and I will pretty much guarantee you that the kids will know every word you say and will be able to tell you dirty crap as well. You would be shocked at what you hear in the hallways of schools.I have a 2 year old daughter and cannot wait to take her on her first Canada trip around the age of 10. I guess my friends are different. I would welcome there kid as they probably would mine. Will I change what I do around the guys if she comes along.....probably not. I will give her the same rule I had, what’s said in Canada stays in Canada otherwise she won't be allowed to go again."
2798673,MN_Moose,2014-05-15 13:43:00,964,"You could tell the young man as I've done in the past,,, We'll take you along and show you the ropes when you're 16, and we're 44 You have to take us along when your 35 and we're 65."
2800089,btmbncr,2014-05-15 21:22:00,492,"Smitty I got to side with you this.If the rule is no kids that's the way it is.Sounds like you need to get rid of the newbie who wants to bring his kid. We use to go on a guys trip,everybody honored the no kids,wives or girlfriends rule.It was a great way to ""decompress""."
2800385,KurtG,2014-05-16 03:40:00,259,"Years ago, my father was approached by a neighbor that was having real issues with his teenage son. Dads solution was quite simple, to the point and dead on the money. He told the man to ""take those golf clubs, stick them where the sun dont shine and do something the boy wants to do"". The boy likes to fish so take him fishing! If you dont want to watch the boy become a man that his father can be proud of, go your own way but dont ruin a friendship over a man being a father."
2800409,btyreprich,2014-05-16 04:07:00,1067,"I could not imagine a trip without my youngest son and my buddy's son. My friend and I are best friends for almost 50 years & godfathers to each other's kids. Each & every trip there are funny stores shared about the experiences of the boys while in Canada. The boys are also a great help when it comes to loading / unloading the boat, helping out a shore lunch, etc. Photos of the smiles on the boys' faces are worth every penny we spend to bring them up with us. More than anything, I am ""buying"" good memories for my son and I hope when is a father, he'll do the same for his kids."
2767265,CPDFisherman,2014-05-07 09:32:00,212,"How is allowing the boy to watch a group of adults unwind and get drunk going to teach him anything about acceptable/unacceptable behavior?It just turns into a ""Do as I say, not as I do"" lesson. Anyone with kids knows that this would be a recipe for future problems.Besides, your missing the main point. This is a traditional mens trip with a NO KIDS rule. The man has no right to force his 14 year old onto everyone else."
2767329,Bakefish,2014-05-07 09:40:00,1077,"It is not the responsibility of the established group to help the dad teach his kid about the outdoors. I'm sure other members of the group have kids, but they are not bringing theirs. This is an adults only group, or it is represented as such. If a member of this group wants to show their kid what the outdoors is all about it's up to him, not the village. My kids were never invited to tag along with my adult group. They went on separate trips with me. The guys in my group went on our trip to get away from their jobs and their responsibilities. It was an unwritten but oft talked about bylaw that speaking of jobs and families was off limits. We were there for a reason, and that reason was... it was all about us. We had a guy in our group who owned a gas station and he refused to pump gas or clean a windshield on the road. We all understood. His kids were grown and on their own. How do you think he'd feel if I had my kids tag along? He was a good guy and wouldn't have said anything, but I guarantee that the group would have broken up shortly after. Some here say that people are selfish, or need alcohol rehab because they don't want kids along. It is not up to the group to accept another members responsibility. As I said in an earlier post. It's all about the dynamics of the group."
2767401,Guest,2014-05-07 10:03:00,0,"If your group was, and is, a man's trip only keep it that way. When a child is old enough take him (or her) along and make them a new member of the group. There are plenty of other opportunities for parent/child fishing trips. I think your ""buddy"" is being selfish AND very rude in expecting the group to accept his decision to bring a youngster on the trip. It also is wrong for the group to acquiesce to this one persons selfish demand. If it is so important then that person could very well start a family fishing trip tradition."
2767465,pryorhunt,2014-05-07 10:27:00,26,"I look at your situation kind of like a similar situation but only dealing with deer hunting. Here in Michigan you can now deer hunt at age ten and younger if you are sitting with an adult. At one time the legal age was fourteen and many of my group's kids would start coming to camp with them. However, we still have a fourteen year old rule. It is understood that the father will get with the child and let them know the rules of camp. First and foremost, what is seen or heard in camp, stays in camp. The child is warned by everyone upon entering the camp that any breakage of the rule will lead to permanent expulsion! I realize it may be somewhat uncomfortable at first, but if the parent doesn't have a problem with what their child may hear or see, then try not to worry about it yourself and have a good time! Besides, hopefully someday you will be able to pay them back by bringing your son with you. If you don't have one, rent one, lol. Bringing a daughter opens up another can of nightcrawlers!!!! We have been fortunate enough not to have any daughters who hunt. Or, should I say yet?"
2767521,davenathe,2014-05-07 10:37:00,113,"Not in favor of kid joining group unless charter members approve. Should be discussed an approved in advance. Personally, would not want a 14 year old joining our group. As organizer or our group it is 5 days of enjoyment without having to deal with issues. Unless, I know the person do not feel comfortable joining our group size of 6. One bad apple could ruin a trip, would rather go with 5 and then 6."
2767577,Pomme Man,2014-05-07 10:50:00,6,"My dad passed away in June of 74. I was two months away from turning thirteen. The following year one of my dad's best friends invited me to northern Canada as his guest. Buzzy and his group of friends (also friends of my dad) had been going to Lake Pashkokogan since they saw Curt Gowdy do a fly in trip on Wide World of Sports.This trip was a right of passage not only for me but for every other teenage son who experienced northern Canada with this group. The adults were hard on me as I assumed they would be since it was my first trip. But it was all good. As for the ""adult behavior"" this wasn't my first rodeo. I had seen my dad's friends drink and curse before so Canada wasn't something that was going to scar me for life.I think you should ask yourself why ""adults only"" is so important to you? You may realize it's not that big of a deal. In the spirit of maturing, it is so important for a father and son to bond. Canada is the perfect place for this to occur. I know this as I took my son to Eagle Lake in October 2010 for his right of passage. I will always be grateful to Buzzy for taking me to the most wonderful place on earth.Good luck as you decide what is important."
2767585,CPDFisherman,2014-05-07 10:58:00,212,"Obviously that was a group that regularly included kids in the trip. In the OP's case, Kids have never been allowed.The new guy shouldn't be forcing the rest of the group to change."
2767737,SinOrSwim,2014-05-07 11:15:00,1528,"I think most of us with kids agree it's important. That doesn't mean there should be some negative connotation attached to people who want an adults only trip? What if they want to get drunk, cuss like sailors and talk about all the hookers they banged in Vegas? Is that appropriate for a 14 year old? This, to me, is a to each their own situation. You want a guys trip.....take a guys trip. You want to take your wife......take your wife or kids. But, there is nothign wrong with wanting an adults only trip either. I get tired of the self-righteous preachy crap. Whether it be this or drinking etc. Doesn't change the fact the core group of people should be the decision makers. If the others want to play along, fine. If not, take a different trip. Pisses me off when we get a new person on our trip and they question or complain how we do things."
2767881,WalleyeWally28,2014-05-07 11:46:00,298,"I think a lot of you guys missed this clarification from Smitty. The group lives in Canada and they have many other times that they go to cottages and resorts with their kids. This is a once a year ""guys"" trip without their families. At least that was what it was supposed to be."
2768057,MikeinMN,2014-05-07 12:21:00,190,"Lots of emotion on this topic, I think mostly because we all have such strong memories of our first trip, and for a portion of us that was as the youngest addition to an established group. That was the case for me anyway. The OP is not asking if it is a good idea to bring along a child of one of the group, and I think we would all agree that once a young person is mature enough it's a great idea, but rather he is asking is it OK that he is upset that one member is bringing his child against the wishes of at least 2 members, (including the founding member) and doing so after others who wanted to bring their own children of similar age have not brought them out of respect for the groups wishes. These trips are so valuable and group dynamics are so fragile that it is tremendously disrespectful of this person to bring his child along regardless of the group's feeling, or at least the feelings of several individuals in the group, and by doing that risk not only the group's enjoyment of the trip, but also the group being split or dissolved. My thought is that it is right to be upset that this member is risking your, and your group members, enjoyment of this trip, and the group's actual trip itself, by enforcing his own wishes regardless of others."

If this place is just the guys getaway then that's how I think it should stay. You can always plan a kids trip plus maybe make it a bit shorter. You know how kids can be sometimes..........."
2765457,RETIRETOFISH,2014-05-06 20:05:00,6,"It all depends on the 14 year old . We have been on some fishing trips where the 70 year old man acted like a child.

We where all young once and fishing with our Dad made lasting memories . Good luck"
2765505,CPDFisherman,2014-05-06 20:20:00,212,"If you allow the 14 year old, you might as well make it a complete family trip and bring all kids and the wives."

Most of those times I spend more time helping them tie lures, pick spots, lose tackle etc. I love it and I do it with a smile, but in the back of my head what keeps the smile going is knowing that for that 1 week a year I'm free to do whatever I need and only for me. No kids, just a bunch of grown men who's only worry for an entire week should be heartburn."

Well guess what, this year one of our sons is joining our group, because of a group decision. I personally welcome the young legs. Your group of originals should also have a decision meeting and discuss it and make a decision and then all must live by it. Should be a group decision. Cheers and happy fishing."

The more I think about this, I would tell Dad sorry but you are out. It sucks for the kid but ultimately will teach him and his dad a valuable lesson. With the way Dad is acting now, I seriously doubt Dad will be teaching this kid anything other than how to be an idiot."
2767225,Guest,2014-05-07 09:21:00,0,"I would let the kid go. You have to start somewhere and it's a good way to get youth involved in the great outdoors (much better than video games). My grandfather took me fishing and hunting when I was growing up and my Dad did as well when he wasn't working. Even if the adults get drunk, cuss or act up, it's an opportunity to teach the boy what is acceptable/unacceptable behavior. The main thing is to introduce the young man into the group as a positive thing for all."
2759177,Enid Elizabeth,2014-05-05 07:10:00,59,"Take your kids fishing before they are 16. By then they are more interested in their friends and the opposite sex. UNLESS they are already addicted to fishing. Take them around home, short trips whatever. If you take them north bring a friend their age... Fathers/sons (or daughters of course), add a grandpa if you can. If your kids don't fish they may never like to fish and won't be taking you as the old guy years from now. Of course nothing wrong with the guys fishing trip... No kids. Just gotta go fishing 2x a yearI run a flyin camp and I see 3 generation trips all the time. Nothing better than grandpa watching the kids catch a big fish"

I took my 17 yr old grandson last year, and he said if he would go again in a heartbeat. I thought he was bored some nights with the stories and drinking, etc. but I guess I was wrong! He ended up catching the biggest walleye of the trip the last 10 minutes we fished. 10 pounder!"

Parents should include their kids in a variety of experiences. Take them to Canada when possible . . . I took my son the 1st time for his 16th birthday and 30 years later he and I still do a week together each year. But in this case, the immature and insensitive dunce is the father who, knowing the group's traditions and agreed to rules, just announces, without any discussion or negotiation, that he doesn't give a hoot and he's just going to do what he wants, regardless. Frankly, I wouldn't want someone who's that disrespectful of the group to come with us. Seems like most of the comments are missing the point. This above is spot on. This thread is not about if kids should be able to go fishing its about respecting the rules. Rules are rules. This is clearly an adult Guys trip. Of course its awesome to take kids on a fishing trips but this Dad needs to take the boy on a father(s) son(s) fishing trip not a ""Guys trip"". Personally I rarely do ""Guys trips"" of any kind I always take my kids when I can get them to go but I would never horn in on a Guys trip and expect them welcome my kids. Imagine what the boys going to feel like if Dad insist on going against the rules and brings him on a trip he is not 100% welcome on. Geeez some peoples Dads...."

The thing I remember most about that trip was when I was told ""what happens in deer camp, stays in deer camp !"" There are a lot of stories I to this day have never told anyone. My point is, take the young guys along. Because ""If you teach a youngster to hunt, fish and trap, they won't be out mugging little old ladies"" And besides, it will make memories that neither you or they will forget for the rest of their lives ! I take my grand children on fishing trips with me all the time, and they love every minute of it ! Enjoy your time with them while you can, they grow up way too fast. And to quote a song, "" you wake one day and find that ten years have passed you by"" Don't waste the years you have now ! Share them with your kids ! ! !"

If I wanted to bring a buddy, kid, whatever I would have to run it up the ladder. I joined in year 2. We're on year 8 or 9 now and that still doesn't mean it's up to me. As for buddy bringing 'the kid' it makes me wonder if someone at home didn't like idea of hubby running off to the woods for a week and leaving the kids at home again."

If the guy wants to bring his 14 year old on a fishing trip, he should plan his own.There is no way ANY 14 year old is mature enough to be around a group of adult men full of booze and BS. The father is setting himself up for problems down the road. How is he going to expect his teenage son to act responsibly after bringing him on this trip. The rules were set, if he doesn't like it he doesn't have to go. He is one of the new guys and has no business trying to change the dynamics of the trip.If I were you I would politely tell him that he is no longer welcome. If you tell him he needs to leave his son at home, he will likely have a chip on his shoulder the entire trip. If the rest of the ""core"" decide to allow the kid to go, then it is likely that they dynamics have already changed which could mean the beginning of the end of your annual trip.No matter how much the others insist that the presence of the 14 year old will not change things, it will. Certain stories will be withheld. There will be ""looks"" when someone goes too far with their stories or actions. You will not be able to fully relax, which is the whole point of the trip.I'm all for bringing a kid fishing, but this type of trip is not the place for it."

Unfortunately, if the rest of the group want to change the rules and alow kids to come, well then you know what you have to do.Rick......"
2744841,Smitty123,2014-05-01 04:54:00,11,"Thanks Guys - I really appreciate your input - just a side note - a few years back - a founding member was told that he could not bring his kid on the trip - he was fine with that and decided to take a family trip that week instead - he's going to be really mad when he finds out this ""newbie"" is bringing his kid.I am going on the trip with an open mind and I am going to have a good time either way - I am not going to change my ways because there's a kid with us - his father can explain my behavior Thanks again"
2744921,Shellback,2014-05-01 05:39:00,8083,"If it's a man's trip by previous agreement, it should stay that way. Want to take your son or daughter? Plan your own trip. Sure, a high school boy has probably seen or heard whatever might go on during a man trip. But how about next year and a fellow decides to bring his 12 year old daughter? The real problem the OP has is not the kid, but the newcomer adult that doesn't respect the adult only rules."
2745145,Ranger319,2014-05-01 06:28:00,166,"I completely agree. The kid is getting caught in the middle when in reality it is not his fault, but his d-bag ""Father"". At 14, I would be PO'd at my Father if I knew this is how I got to go to Canada. It is too late to do anything this year so do your best to make it a great trip. Once the trip is over, I would be having a conversation with the group and then this guy (without his son present) saying hopefully your son had a great time, let us know how your trip next year goes with him as you will not be going with this group again. Then explain to him why, the fact that he forced his way on to the group and that just isn't happening. If he did it once, he will do it again. If he has another kid, he will be doing this again. If the group doesn't feel the same way, then i would be seeing what members of my current group wanted to break off and start a new one, GUY'S ONLY. There are plenty of guys willing to FOLLOW group rules that go to Canada. A lot of us work all year just for this trip. Having one person like this guy can easily ruin that trip. You already have a sour taste in your mouth and the ice isn't out yet! I know I work too **** hard to put up with a joke like this guy. Good luck!"
2745193,Golden Eagle,2014-05-01 06:43:00,2642,"""New guy"" should fit in with the group, not bring about change. Maybe he could come up with his transportation and make use of a second cabin. Fishing trips should not become about one person, especially if that person is new to the group. Who invited the guy? Maybe they could team up instead of being with your regulars. Might be better for all members."
2750601,camp chef,2014-05-02 08:49:00,915,several times in my life we have subsected our Fishing group in order to accomadate everyone's needs and desires. A second cabin in the same camp and separate provisions worked well. We were able to get together for a communal dinner one night. Shared shore lunches and joint cocktail hours. It worked out well for everyone for multiple reasons.
2751753,WalleyeRigger,2014-05-02 15:33:00,14,"This is a time of year to hang out with the boys, have some laughs drink some beer and maybe a few extras. You should not have to worry about changing the way you or the others act while your out there just because there is a kid around. It's nice to be able to let loose now and then with the boys and the new lad should understand this. Yes at 14 he is old enough to understand what's going on but a boys trip is still a boys trip. Leave the kids at home and maybe as mentioned before set a family date with the for another weekend of the year. Nothing beats a week of fishing with a core of guys that has done it together for years - I say for next season leave the kid and new guy at home - Cheers, Enjoy your trip."
2752217,Nimstug,2014-05-02 17:07:00,2605,"I've never been part of a set fishing trip group so for what it's worth... Did the group ever define 'kid' as in 'No one under age ___ will be allowed on the trip'? or was it more generic 'no kids'. And how that was communicated to the guys as they joined the group? If you had a certain minimum age set and clearly communicated that to the people as they came on board, and the majority of the group agree, I think you have a right to consider un-inviting the dad. If I read your post right, the majority of the group is OK with the son coming along. (Or they don't care.) They may be willing to modulate their behavior some for the youngster or perhaps they think whatever goes on at camp is fine. The group as a whole can decide to change the rules. Did you explain your concerns to the Dad, beyond saying flat out the kid can't come? Did you give your reasons why you have the rule, other than it's a rule? Maybe the dad thinks what goes on at camp is acceptable for his 14 year old son. If the kid comes on the trip, I hope you give it a chance to work before deciding you can't live with it. You can have a lot of fun with a greenhorn. If you can't that's fine. You will have to make decisions based on what you think is best for you. Nimstug"
2755121,zeebee,2014-05-03 18:57:00,1144,Not a kids trip.....I took my kids on a separate trip. Much better for everyone. Kids need one on one without resentment otherwise nasty develops.
2755329,Brett W.,2014-05-03 20:42:00,82,"We always had a guys weekend for opening of duck hunting, no kids were really allowed but one year one of the guys wife was on a trip and brought his daughter out. We slept in a trailer and hung out there all weekend. Kid complained all weekend, cold, bored, ex. Really put a damper on the weekend. Now she wasn't old enough to hunt so a little different but it will go 1 of 2 ways, I hope for u it goes good, if not I would push the no kids stronger for next year, no reason for you to stop going"
2755673,forgop,2014-05-04 00:03:00,880,"Here's how I look at it.... My dad passed away nearly 6-1/2 years ago and there's not a day that goes by that I don't think of him. We never went to Canada, but some of my fondest memories in particular were spent fishing in Minnesota with him around that same age (and the fishing was horrible mind you). I work in health care now and it continually reminds me that none of us are guaranteed the next year. For all we know we can be hit head on by someone texting and driving to/from work tomorrow or stricken with a progressive illness that significantly impacts your quality of life and be terminally ill the following year. Let him be a father to his son and the experience of the trip will be memories they'll always have and will likely continue the tradition. We live in an era where boys are growing up without active fathers and encourage everyone in said group that may have kids around the same age to start bringing theirs as well. All that said, I think he should have asked the group first, but I don't see the need to give up going because someone is bringing a teenage son. Anyone that objects to the son going can be the one to stay home IMO."
2741953,NathanH,2014-04-30 11:34:00,697,"Depends on the Kid. I would wait to see how it goes. You might be shocked at how well but dont be worried about checking Dad if Kids a pain. He should be able to do everything your group is doing but drink. But he should be ready to entertain himself. I think you got a nice grunt to do work. I remember when I got to go to Deer camp and stay about 14. I cut the wood, feed the stove, did the dishes, cleaned up, and fetched the drinks.. and when it was time I put in my ear plugs and went to bed. When deer were shot I help drag or carry items helped butcher, and cleaned up ect. I was just happy to be around it all. I was invited back for the next year and as other said they were happy to have me. Folks dont mind others doing extra work for them, or helping them out as they age."
2742161,camp chef,2014-04-30 12:44:00,915,Very well said.Deer Camp and and a Canadian Fishing trip is the same learning experience for our young outdoorsmen. My favorite part of being a kid was Deer camp and fishing trips.
2742385,Aaron-IN,2014-04-30 13:37:00,500,"""I am I nuts for being like this??"" I would say YES, you are nuts. When you said you were out next year if it happened again that just confirmed it for me given you haven't been on this years trip to even know what it's like to take the 14 year old with you."
2742609,Smitty123,2014-04-30 14:33:00,11,"Okay let me clear up a few things I actually live in Canada this is not a ""Canada"" trip - We all have kids that are this lads age or older - they are fine with us going on this trip we only get away once a year without them. There are plenty of other family trips to cottages and resorts to fish. I'm a guy who likes to keep tradition - This same dad actually has brought a few duds to our group too - which doesn't help. I'm glad to hear people think I'm nuts for thinking this lol. Oh well he's coming this year I guess I have no say in the matter. Thanks for your help guys"
2742729,P&y only,2014-04-30 15:01:00,133,Yep. Yer nuts. At 14 that kid is old enough to see you get drunk and not be scarred. He wont cause you any problems. Have fun with him. Remember your youth. You'll be ok.
2742889,SinOrSwim,2014-04-30 15:36:00,1528,Would everyone be okay if this dude decided to bring his wife? I mean she might like to fish too.
2743105,Fish_Heads,2014-04-30 16:35:00,154,Prolly need to see pics first before that decision can be made.........
2743618,MorganMan,2014-04-30 19:14:00,341,"Well put. If someone was that disrespectful, he should be uninvited if it can't be discussed. It takes time and effort to plan these things. Newbie guy can start his own group. Don't tell someone to grow up if you don't know the people/personalities involved."
2743817,JAY221,2014-04-30 19:57:00,877,"I don't think your nuts & as a group I would want to know the current rules we are going by early enough to change my plans if I want to . He might want to bring a baby next year,who knows??? If it was agreed no kids it should be no kids. Later, Jay"
2744801,revitup,2014-05-01 03:41:00,140,"I have to say that I fall on your side with this one Smitty. Shame on the one who says he is above the group and is willing to risk another person's enjoyment of a prized week of vacation for his own pleasure. Since these are the rules in effect, changes to the rules should come about only with a significant majority opinion and be done with plenty of time (probably when the group is together at the lodge) so that those not liking the new rules would have time to opt out of the group.That being said, I urge you to make the best of it this year and then after the week is over to make your decision. Your vacation is too valuable to let any issue ruin this week for you. And resist the urge to do paybacks to the one who has offended you or his son. I really hope you can still have a great week."
2741553,Fishin Fun,2014-04-30 10:00:00,218,Wow. I love to have my kids come. So do the guys in my group. Nothing better than spending time with your kids when you still can. Sounds like you need to find a new group if it doesn't work for you anymore.
2741569,Bakefish,2014-04-30 10:02:00,1077,"I don't think you're wrong at all. This has as much to do with a new guy bringing a new member in as it does with having a child along on a man trip. This new invitee should have been discussed and voted on, not shoved down your throat, child or not. The original group I used to go to Canada with could absolutely not support a child along, and none of us would want one there. But I've been with another group where kids were welcome. Different dynamics. There is a time and place for everything, and I understand where you are coming from, and I agree with you."
2741689,Jack77,2014-04-30 10:14:00,168,I could be wrong but it sounds like you are concerned that the presence of the teenager will affect either the groups behaivior or/ and activities which is a reasonable concern. The group needs to make it clear that the presence of his son isn't going change anything for the rest of you. The kid might be doing some growing up that week. Relax and have fun.
2741697,MrSimon,2014-04-30 10:24:00,922,"What kind of adjustments to your behavior would you have to do if the kid comes? He is 14 .... probably can tell more dirty jokes than you can, and I'm sure he hears worse language at school than he'll hear in Canada. Since you asked, I'd say you should change your attitude. Look at this an opportunity for a young man to experience what Canada is all about. Maybe even go out of your way to make it fun for him. And whatever you do, do be all pouty and complain about it."
2741785,Knutson21,2014-04-30 10:42:00,348,"My dad started taking me when I was 7. Havent stoped yet and now 36. I take it you dont have kids? Grow up, it might be good for you and the kid. This coming from a guy that doesnt understand the mentality of some groups that hate it when fishing interupts their drinking trip."
2741801,strength22,2014-04-30 10:44:00,49,My dad started taking me when I was 7. It was a big group of guys. I did my own thing and didn't bother the group when they were playing cards and such. If I was tired in the boat I slept on the boat seat. I fell in love with Canada. I went every year with the group of guys. Had my 1st labatts blue with the group when I was in 8th grade and a few after that as I grew up with the group. My dad and Gramps have both passed on but I still go every year and I am now 42. Group is much smaller and we do things a lot different. We use to haul everything with us and have huge meals and such now I can pack in about 10 minutes and we get whatever we need up there. Meals are much smaller and simpler and we like that. Only about 4 of us go up now a days. I sure am glad my dad brought me up when he did. My daughter wants to start coming up and that would be a 1st and if the group of guys doesn't like it then well I will be going with my daughter then as I would not deprive a kid of that experience and growth as a person because some guy in my group didn't like it. at my dad's funeral the wife of an older fella(who passed away long ago) that use to come up to Canada came to the funeral and I spoke with her and told her how much I loved Frank(her husband) and how I wish I was older when we would go up and be around him so I could have appreciated him more because of my age but that he was a funny man that made me laugh as I kid. She looked at me and said I came here on your fathers funeral to try to cheer you up with kind words and you ended up making my day. A few days later she brought me over an old jack daniels whiskey wooden clock that Frank had as he owned a very nice liquor store and gave that to me. None of this would have been possible if a guy in the group didn't want a kid up there.
2741833,10point,2014-04-30 10:53:00,102,"Been taking my Son since I started going. He was 11 at the time. We go to fish. We don't drink or play cards. We fish, eat, and sleep."
2741858,poultryman,2014-04-30 11:02:00,183,"I bring my 12 year old along. Hes been going since he was 8. He needs to learn to shut up a bit more often, but he fishes hard and doesnt complain. When he gets tired he just stops fishing and eats whatever snacks we have along. He doesnt *****, and he crashes by 9pm after a long day on the water. My buddy did pay him 20 bucks to stop talking at one point when he was still just 8. He doesnt cause any friction now. He has learned. Personally, I have fished with other peoples kids and HATED it so I get where the OP is coming from...BUT...if the dude is responsible for his kid and that kid isnt in my boat, I wouldnt mind but Im not changing my behavior or language for someone else's kid. 14 is old enough in my book. Kid is in High School, correct? Thats old enough to take a beating if he opens his big mouth about what went on on the trip."
2741882,JayM5209,2014-04-30 11:15:00,1050,"For me the bigger issue here isn't a kid, it's a father, relatively new to the group, who doesn't give a da-- about the rest of the group or its agreed to ground rules. Parents should include their kids in a variety of experiences. Take them to Canada when possible . . . I took my son the 1st time for his 16th birthday and 30 years later he and I still do a week together each year. But in this case, the immature and insensitive dunce is the father who, knowing the group's traditions and agreed to rules, just announces, without any discussion or negotiation, that he doesn't give a hoot and he's just going to do what he wants, regardless. Frankly, I wouldn't want someone who's that disrespectful of the group to come with us.How 'bout if the group decides to take the son for the week if the father promises to stay home? I'd actually vote for that if it was my annual group."
2741898,bthomas3333,2014-04-30 11:16:00,465,I have been doing fly-in trips since I was 12. That was 35 years ago. I now bring my son(15) along and honestly I think we NEED him on the trip. The amount of work he does to help his Grandfather and the other guys who are over 70 is amazing. He is always the one carrying bags. Fetching jugs of water/etc. He is a huge help for the older guys and seriously what are you guys doing that a normal 14 year old hasn't seen or been around? An all guys trip isn't that much different than a bunch of 15 year olds hanging out (ok not the beer) but the point is a bunch of guys in the woods isn't exactly an ADULT setting. If the kid doesn't fit with the group that is a different story. Tell the guy what you expect the kid to do or not do and you will be fine.
2741250,Smitty123,2014-04-30 09:12:00,11,"Hey GuysWe have been going on a man trip for well over 15 yrs  different spots but we finally found a lake that we like.There is a core group of about 5 guys that do all the organizing and go every year  4-5 other guys are new to the group  in the last 5 yrs.It has always been a guys week  drinking, poker, fishing and relaxing  when it started  No Kids was the strict rule.Well one of the new guys has decided to bring his 14 yr old boy  I told him straight up that he wasn't invited  well that's not stopping him  he's still coming.I am pretty pissed that my words did not have much effect and that my core group did not stand up and say no to this  but I will put up with it this year if I have to - but I told them I am out next year if the kid comes.I am I nuts for being like this??Anyone else have to deal with this  how did you handle it?thanks"
2741305,stumcfar,2014-04-30 09:23:00,451,"I can understand your concerns, but you have to see his side. I have been doing a Canadian trip for about 25 years. I have a 13 year old son as does one other member of my group. I decided that when my son turned 10, he could come with and so would the other guys son. Fortunately our group was okay with this. I will not go back to Canada without my son as long as he wants to go. I would have left the group if they were not open to this. I have always loved my fishing trip and it has only gotten better, making memories with my son. The two boys have not been complainers, they will fish all day and then fish on the dock when we get back and now have become part of the group. Have an open mind and give it a try. Just think of the excitement for this young man, getting to join the guys on a Canadian fishing trip. I would hope you wouldn't quit going, just because a younger person has joined the group. My son is well aware he may here some words or see some things that are not acceptable for him to do until he is older, but for the most part our group has adjusted and actually enjoy having the boys around. We did a fly-in last year and the boys were not a bother to anyone. Hopefully you will find out that your trip is not compromised in any way. Good luck, have fun as I know the boy will remember it for his entire life!"
2741313,LOW1,2014-04-30 09:23:00,2828,"Did your father ever take you anywhere you wanted to go when you were 14? At 14 the kid may be a jerk or he may be a great friend - the same can be said for those aged 60. At 14 he's probably better toilet trained than some of your regulars. If Dad agrees, you may even want to let him try a Cuban cigar and a Molson. Take him along, grow the group for the future, and have fun."
2741329,Jimmy Jig,2014-04-30 09:27:00,1905,"I would say it your life, do what you have to do! I will say that when I was l7 years old and one of my Dad's group couldn't go that year, my Dad took me. It was the only time it happened but I still think about that trip......I still am going to the same camp now. Maybe it will be a one time deal?"
2741337,Mike Borger,2014-04-30 09:27:00,1554,"No I don't think you're nuts, but I do think you should rethink your stance.Kids are only young once, these kinds of experiences are the kinds of things they'll always remember."
2741401,big popi,2014-04-30 09:34:00,635,"My Dad took me on a ""man"" trip to Canada when I was 14. It was a great experience. I was told to not repeat the stories I heard Pops and the other guys talk about. It was the first time I heard him drop an F-bomb. As long as the kid is not a brat, what is the big deal? Probably like most guys, they enjoy showing the young ones how to do things as long as they want to learn. If the kid is a jerk, just ignore him. It can be a great experience to bring some youth into a group, maybe even make you feel like a kid again. My $.02, take him & have a good time."
2741433,bcmss396,2014-04-30 09:37:00,296,"Our rule for the ""Men's Camp"" was when the kids are legal Canadian Drinking age (19) they are welcome. Until then I will continue to have a men's trip and also a family trip where ALL the kids go with (ages 6, 10 and 13 this year).Kids love the trip and I enjoy having a week of juvenile behavior with the boys.Blair"
2741449,SinOrSwim,2014-04-30 09:39:00,1528,"Depends on the group. I wouldn't take my kid on our guys trip which is why we are doing a separate trip. Not at that age. However, we have taken two of my brothers boys but the deal was they waited til they were like Jr or Sr in high school. We have too much drinking and the conversations are not suitable/appropriate for a younger kid. So, it's not that we mind kids. We like having them come up. We just want them to be old enough to be in that environment. I don't think it would be fair for me to bring my younger kid and expect others to act in a way I deem suitable for my child."
2741473,camp chef,2014-04-30 09:45:00,915,"Everyone has to be a first timer once. I can think of nothing more rewarding than introducing a young person to the same things that I love. People ***** about the youth of today, but the kids that we have introduced to the Canada experience are more well adjusted than thier nonfishing counterparts. I don't have any kids but am proud to have been able to be apart of my ""god kids"" early Canadian trips. If they don't learn about the world from you ,then you can't be sure what they will learn and from whom."
2741537,Gregking,2014-04-30 09:57:00,2658,"I have a few questions to better understand the rules 1 did everyone in the group agree to the no kids rule? was there an age minimum set on the age? Is the father aware of drinking, and whatever else? From what I read so far it seems the protocol was set but would like more details. If the father wanted to take him he has the option of going at a different time. Wen I was a baby- high school dad took me every year to Canada. By age 10 they added a mans trip. I asked to go, was told no that it's just adults. I understood and couldn't wait to turn 18 to go. They broke up before I could go but not once did I blame anyone or go on a crime spree. I accepted the rules and still turned out ok. I don't have a guys trip, my kids can go anytime they want but those are my rules since it's my boat, pickup ,camper or if in Canada I'm the one setting up the trip. I would like to see more parents take their kids fishing but the guy does have the option of going a different time or place. Then again I don't know the whole story"
