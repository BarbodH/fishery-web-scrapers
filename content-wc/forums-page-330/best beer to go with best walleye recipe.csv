2802729,dynamite,2014-05-16 13:26:00,20,"Our favorite is ""Blue"". You must drink it very cold and in the summer this means fast so it does not loose its coldness. You just have to drink more, so plan accordinly."

2777825,AllenW,2014-05-09 17:22:00,11482,"Ya, don't care for a beer that dominates the flavor either, miller draft works as does Grain Belt premium or even Michelob draft. I'll drink LaBatts or Molson when in Canada for a change of pace, but tend to stay with milder beers normally. al"
2777921,lassh,2014-05-09 18:15:00,553,I think he's asking what brews do you like to drink when eating fresh walleye. If you're gravitating towards brown beer Sleeman makes a good Honey Brown Lager. They make a Porter too but I haven't tried that yet.
2777961,zeebee,2014-05-09 18:30:00,1144,In that case the best beer is a scotch
2778353,Baxman1958,2014-05-09 20:38:00,14,"My dad, brothers and I, used to boat into an outpost cabin - about a 27 mile trip. We have done this 15 - 20 times. One year, after shoving off from Ross' camp, we stopped at a resort down the lake on Clearwater, that had a store. My pick was Molson Black ice. Something like 8.5%. I drank 2 driving one of our boats out to camp. It was a 1.5 - 2 hour trip, depending on the weather. I had been up about 30 hours or so by this time. And, it was about 10am. Got to the camp - no problem. But when it came time to unload the boats, and carry everything up the hill to the cabin, my legs somehow became unconnected from my cerebral cortex. I learned a valuable lesson, all those years ago. NO drinking before noon. At least on the first and last day ......."
2778513,lassh,2014-05-09 21:51:00,553,A good scotch at the end of the day is hard to beat. I'm with there Zeebee.

2783905,Bigstorm,2014-05-12 06:26:00,799,I like my Labatts (regular preferred but unleaded works too) or some Moosehead.
2776985,centralstater,2014-05-09 12:26:00,20,"I am new to this forum so bear with me if this has been discussed previously. Those walleye recipes are making me extremely excited for next weeks opener. So my question is, is what is your favorite beer to go with those fish. My favorite has always been LaBatts but lately I really have taken a liking to darker, amber type beer. Are there any local or Canadian darker beers that I might try. As a side note, I am really enjoying the discussions on here."
2777025,bcmss396,2014-05-09 12:38:00,296,Always LaBatt's Blue - Leaded or unleaded work equally well. Just typing this made me thirsty Blair

2777265,wallydave,2014-05-09 13:54:00,2151,"For me the beer depends on the weather, colder calls for a darker beer, warmer, Blue has been a fav. Last August a new lake called for a new beer, Molson sure was a good warm weather beer! Just glad to have some good beer to go with fresh walleye!"

2777345,lassh,2014-05-09 14:31:00,553,Kokanee or Alexander Keith's IPA are excellent. Of course LaBatts Blue is also a really good beer. I do not like the Canadian light beers as much.
