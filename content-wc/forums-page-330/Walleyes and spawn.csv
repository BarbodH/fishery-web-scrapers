2786305,LoDo,2014-05-12 14:35:00,721,"Id fish in the warmest, most current, shallow, spawning areas. If you can't find walleyes there, I'd find 25-30ft areas that are a direct line from those spawning areas. Basically means the females haven't come into the spawning areas yet and waiting for temps to rise. My two cents..."
2791393,back357,2014-05-13 17:27:00,106,Fished just north of Ignace last year which sits at 49 degrees latitude. We fished the 16th through the 21st of June and probably had the best year in at least 10 years. We'll be up there fishing the 15th through the 20th of June this year and I would expect another good year as long as everything continues down the current path. We focus on 8-12 feet depending on water temps.
2803305,LoDo,2014-05-16 16:59:00,721,Looks like many will be fishing this weekend. Best of luck to all! Would love to hear some reports. Send when you can.
2716737,The Donger,2014-04-24 03:20:00,48,I am assuming ice out in Red Lake and North of there will be similar to last year. Maybe a couple days earlier this time. Does anyone remember when the spawn lull was North of Red Lake last year?
2726881,octanehi5,2014-04-26 16:45:00,1104,"If your location to fly to is north of 48 degrees lat. You may find ice or just out, water temps will be very cold,below 45 F its possible to get a pre spawn bite,Pike fishing in the shallows will be good,the last week of May will bring the spawning time,by the end of the first week in June.Most of the spawning will be finished,Second week they will be lethargic but starting to bite. The third week in June Walter should start to feed Alot. I start my trip To Hebert on June 20th ending on the 29th, After May 1 most of the northern lakes will stay above freezing all day,but very cloudy days have slowed the effect of sun light on the melt.and will continue to do so. The northern lakes have been locked up since Nov 2013 And still are, It takes a long time to build 6+feet of ice, it will not go over night. My fishing Lac Hebert happens to be 49.3 Degrees north Lat. A spring fed lake, with all water running out of the lake. Last yr the magic week was the first week in July, We slayed them. In my past 20 yrs. my favorite week is the last week in June. This yr it looks like we hit it right on the head."
2727041,LoDo,2014-04-26 17:57:00,721,"Comedy! I love your so ""matter of fact"" comments. Ice will do this, spawn will take place then, 2nd week/june lethargic, fish won't be biting until the third week of June ""which is when I set up my trip"". Come on don't be ""that guy"". My group crushed walleyes the second week of June last year and many are projecting this years ice out to be a week ahead of last years. None of us will know the walleye bite, etc.. until we get there."
2727065,Guest,2014-04-26 18:06:00,0,You guys who don't think eyes bite during the spawn need to fish the Detroit River and Lake Erie during the spawn lol
2728009,octanehi5,2014-04-27 04:58:00,1104,"When I post my matter of facts they are just that. I see you did not post the lat. of your fishing trip. When you caught all those Fish the second week in June. Its a fact that all the lakes north of the 48 degrees Lat are frozen solid. Some of which have not even started to melt. Fishing in the states and fishing in Northern fly to locations differs greatly, along with times of spawning and water temps,How you fish for them,Many lakes in Canada you are not aloud to fish in spawning areas .The opener up there is May 17th,20 days from now.Some lakes will not be ice out by then. We will see shortly if my predictions come true. I wish you all a good season on soft water, no matter were you fish."
2728049,Swamp_Donkey_Slayer,2014-04-27 05:21:00,42,"Sorry buddy your statements from last year are likely a reflection of how you observed it, which is great. Who knows what happened the weeks before and after. Super glad you found your favorite week.As for LoDo he did crush it north of the 48 lat up in woodland caribou wilderness. As for this year we will all see. My guess is LoDo will slay a bunch of fish in late May and you will too on your trip"
2730769,JayM5209,2014-04-27 20:44:00,1050,"octane, your gross, fixed-in-concrete generalizations about everything north of the 48th parallel just aren't reality. Last year I fished the 1st and 2nd weeks of the season on lakes at about the 49.55 line. Ice was totally gone before I got there. This year it will likely be gone a week to ten days earlier than last year. Thunder Bay is about 48 degrees latitude. It's really a bit ludicrous to assert that everything from Thunder Bay north will be frozen in on May 17.I understand that your experience is that the lakes you fish, in Quebec if I remember, seem to hold ice longer than most of us experience in NW Ontario. I hope the ice is out when you go this year and you have another great trip. I can assure you that come May 17 there will be hundreds of ice free lakes north of the 48th in western Ontario.Happy fishing.P.S. Where my group fishes the walleye fishing was average during weeks 1 and 2 last year. The lake trout fishing both weeks was the best we've had in 20 or 25 years."
2785609,pwbmlr,2014-05-12 12:09:00,37,Assuming the ice went over this past weekend ( wawa area ) when do you all estimate the post spawn feeding to kick in?
2785929,LoDo,2014-05-12 13:22:00,721,Not all walleyes spawn at the same time/temp each year. However all will be done when the water temps reach lower 50s.
2786017,bones82,2014-05-12 13:37:00,121,What are the water temps the first week after ice out? 40's? ice just coming off the area we are heading and cold temps below freezing expected this week. Guessing the water will be 35-45 degrees everywhere.
2643625,tv4fish,2014-04-06 06:49:00,2694,"I think Octane has stated what we have found to be true also:Quote: It takes about 10 days and 90% will have spawned. It may vary slightly due to weather conditions, temp.,etc."
2697706,Swamp_Donkey_Slayer,2014-04-19 08:40:00,42,"LoDo, Based on the temps and the ice this year, little worried about or 22 fly in day. First hope the ice is out. Second sure hope the weather warms up soon so we are there end of spawn. Think last year we were in the tail end of it as we were catching tons of small males. Very few big females. Anyways I am happy to just be sitting in the boat even if they are not biting."
2698090,phishfearme,2014-04-19 11:05:00,1242,I agree with both your points lassh - an MNR biologist told me that almost any walleye over 19 inches in NW Ontario is female - and that a 19 inch fish is around 10 years old. we also go later in the season - better fishing and more stabler weather. don't understand the need to be there during opening weekend. phish
2698338,bones82,2014-04-19 13:39:00,121,I like the weather early. You just have to layer up. I also like not fighting the bugs and Mosquitos. Plus the fishing can be outstanding.
2706738,LoDo,2014-04-21 19:00:00,721,"I like the last two weeks of May and first two of June. Jeans and a flannel/hoodie is my outfit of choice. I also like sleeping when the temps are cool. Late June, all of July and most of Aug can be extremely warm, bugs and may not sleep as comfortably. There is no right or wrong answer, more personal preference. If you can catch the ladder end of the spawn I feel the bite is best. One of these days Im going to have to book late Aug, early Sept. I just get so excited I don't want to wait that long. Canadian fishing trip kicks off the summer for me! I still think the ice is out mothers day weekend. Spawn gets going 5/12 ish and finishing up 5/22 ish ."
2706818,Swamp_Donkey_Slayer,2014-04-21 19:10:00,42,Also don't mind having to have a fire going at night to stay warm....heck throw in a one good rain on the trip as well. Man I love this time of year.
2706946,Guest,2014-04-21 19:34:00,0,I commend your early season passion. My group tried one opening day in Quebec and had fun with boat to boat snowball fights and walleye we had to hit on the head to bite. Froze are butts off but the ice was out and there were no bugs. I can't believe the number of folks that are viewing these early season posts. I truly hope the weather will improve and you all will get on your lakes. We're going for late June on Hebert in Quebec and wish all good fishing.

Anyways I am happy to just be sitting in the boat even if they are not biting.SD Slayer - Perhaps 5/22 will be pre spawn!! Pre spawn can be an excellent time for walleyes. Last year we fished 6/7/13 to 6/14 and I'd have to think the walleyes were post spawn. The group that fished before us didn't catch many fish. Most people are saying this spring is similar to last spring. That being said, pre spawn could be late May and spawn first two weeks of June."
2708506,bones82,2014-04-22 06:57:00,121,Agree with all of this.
2708898,LoDo,2014-04-22 08:08:00,721,"The 14 day weather trend still looking bright. An earlier poster on a different thread stated the ice out is ahead of last years. Hmmm... who knows!?!?! Sunny n 55 here in Denver melts snow awfully quick. Hard to compare because we are much higher in elevation and the sun is more intense. Someone needs to get a yardstick going with a live camera like they do with the ski resorts here in CO. Rather than tracking snow fall, lets track snow melt. Great idea, ha!!"
2631689,octanehi5,2014-04-03 06:45:00,1104,"Having worked in a hatchery,I have some knowledge about walleye spawn, It is kicked into gear by water temps 45 F and hrs of day light. The males and females school up near there spawning areas. pre spawn can be caught,the females will then move into the spawning areas first, followed by the males, They have a few beers ideal chit chat, she deposits her eggs and the males come by and fertilize them. Do not bite in spawn mode, It takes about 10 days and 90% will have spawned. About a week after this they put the feed bag on, AKA Time to Fish"
2631785,tv4fish,2014-04-03 07:06:00,2694,Octane: You reinforce what I know/have learned - the walleyes are not interested in biting during their spawn OR for about a week after they spawn. They need that recuperation period before they really put on the feedbag.
2632217,bones82,2014-04-03 08:20:00,121,"We fished the opener last year NorthEast of Kenora. The ice had come off the river 3 days before we arrived. Many of us went to our normal post spawn spots as we always go their on opening week, but we weren't catching the normal numbers. They were spotty, one small male here or there. One boat began fishing the current and had excellent results. We moved to current and had excellent success. The numbers weren't as great as years past, but the size was incredible. Every boat out of 7 boats caught at least a 27"" walleye. There were 2, 30"" walleye caught that week as well. The kicker...most were females and were full of eggs. Our goal was to handle them gently and put them back quickly. Males were full of sperm too. Heck, I think we made some minnows in the bottom of our boat. I am still scraping eggs off my cooler. Ha!"
2632313,octanehi5,2014-04-03 08:38:00,1104,"you were in the tail end of pre spawn begining of spawn for sure,walleye's in the flow tells that. If you going the same times this yr, you may find it a little early for these conditions with late ice out and all"
2632337,bones82,2014-04-03 08:44:00,121,"We are going at the same time. I'm just hoping ice is off. It always has been according to the elders on the reservation. We did catch a few long females that were thin and weak. We arrived 3 days after ice out last year. I hope the pattern isn't any later than last year. We might be coming home. The temps seem to be creeping up to averages movin forward so we may be okay and hit it perfectly. Either way, we will find them if we can get on the water."
2633009,Carnhzkr,2014-04-03 11:24:00,964,How do you tell if a walleye is a male or female? Male is holding a TV remote and the female is on the phone with her mother?
2633177,bones82,2014-04-03 12:10:00,121,Funny. One always has it's mouth open. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...hp/t-2110.html
2640921,LoDo,2014-04-05 10:54:00,721,How many days/weeks do walleye spawn? Is the spawn a few days or is this something that takes place for week or so?
2641465,brochet,2014-04-05 14:26:00,88,we have fished walleyes many times during spawn and always did well in fact there were times that the males followed the female right into the net.
2641937,Blades-n-Beads,2014-04-05 16:38:00,484,"Not sure when ice went out last year on lac seul but we were there in a honey of a bay last week in June. Large females still shallow 7-15' and had the feed bag on. Boated easy 100 fish per guy each day, could not catch a eater fish for lunch and that was ok when all your hooking is 21-30"" eyes. Peanut butter and jelly goes good with a beer too! Lol."
2627041,LoDo,2014-04-01 19:54:00,721,"This question is for the regular anglers, guides and those who live to fish walleyes. Do you find walleyes bite before, during and post spawn? Is there a time when the bite is more difficult? What I'm getting at, is because we would assume the ice isn't going to melt until mid May at the earliest, those hoping to fish the opener and the few weeks after could run into the spawn. Thank you!!"
2627345,Fisherman Ted,2014-04-01 21:56:00,461,Spawn fishing can be tough. Last year they were spawning in NWO right at the open. You could see huge males (25-32+ inches) in like 2-3 feet of water just sitting there waiting for the females and they wanted absolutely nothing to do with feeding. Brutal..... Of course after the spawn it was game on. -FT
2627409,roscoe33,2014-04-02 01:52:00,653,"Last year, the first 2-4 days after ice out, the big fish were hungry. Then they shut down as they went to spawning."
2627721,octanehi5,2014-04-02 06:38:00,1104,"I have been talking to the guys at the hatchery on Oneida, They are saying the walleye may spawn under the ice this yr, Its a combination of water temps and amount of day light, they may not get to raise any fry this yr Prespawn the bite is ok, during spawning stay home watch TV, Post spawn the bite will begin to turn on big time."
2627841,camp chef,2014-04-02 07:24:00,915,Post spawn best......pre spawn good......while they are spawning you might as well be working on your garden.
2628113,Freytown,2014-04-02 08:37:00,770,"Pre spawn , spawn and post spawn?? I've read that on larger bodies of waters, all three phases of the spawn periods can be happening. All walleye don't spawn at the exact same time. Is this true??"
2628153,prov1800,2014-04-02 08:47:00,5010,"Anytime I fish w alleyes is fine with, dont care if its p respawn, spawn, or post spawn, just need to adjust to what they want.they need to eat at some time.its all about presentation and being in the right spot.as a guide we have to catch fish on any given day, true id rather fish post spawn but every year nature throws us a curve ball and after years of being in all kinds of situations you learn things.its also a great time for large pike and if your on the right lake trout are all over the place at that time of the year.I'd rather be out there catching fish then working in the garden any day."
2628745,vteye,2014-04-02 12:00:00,812,We did a fly in last May and ice had just gone out. We could not catcha walleye to save ourselves till the last 3 days. We then hammered themon post spawn patterns.
2629049,LoDo,2014-04-02 13:15:00,721,"Our group has never had problems catching walleyes on our lake in NWO. We usually plan the trip the last week of May or first week of June. The spawn hasn't been an issue at those times, but then again I don't know what to expect with the late ice that is going to take place. Desperately need some warm weather."
2629753,lassh,2014-04-02 15:54:00,553,"Those were likely females not males, regardless the observation is valid. The fish have lockjaw during the spawn. Of course not all the fish spawn at the same time or in the same locations, but most of them do. During and just before the major spawn, you will catch pretty much only smaller males. If you hit right at Prespawn, you can have some really good fishing. Most of the time this is before the opener. We used to go as close to opening week as possible, but after a couple trips during or just after the spawn we decided to go later, when some of the fish have moved out to structure and the hormones have settled down."
