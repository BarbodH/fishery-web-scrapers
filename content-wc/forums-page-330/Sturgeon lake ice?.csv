2796369,rpsnider,2014-05-14 20:33:00,3,North end of sturgeon lake! Not sure what bird those are...
2804793,rnelson,2014-05-17 07:31:00,2,"Talked to Harris Bay Resort yesterday and they said ice should be out in the bay in few days and hopefully by the end on the week on the main lake. We were suppose to be there right now, but delayed it a week for the second year in a row."
2805465,resq91,2014-05-17 14:00:00,6,Talked to guys up there on Fri. and said iceburgs on Sturgeon Lake in main lake. Should be good to go for us the 2nd week. Maybe guys up for opening week get out last half. 70's later in the week should do that ice in. Yippeee!!!!
2738994,iman63,2014-04-29 17:20:00,91,Well it is that time of year again. Ice or no ice for opener? Anyone know if any rain has reached this area yet? Any reports of conditions of lake? Thanks Dave
2739258,Catman59,2014-04-29 18:23:00,345,"Well here is a Strikemaster to the handles on Sunday !!!!!! It doesn't take long , but still darn thick ice on Sturgeon ."
2739962,DMella,2014-04-29 20:36:00,32,Maybe that will be the hole that causes the break up.
2739994,JJJMN,2014-04-29 20:53:00,153,If the late ice out is like last year it should be a good fishing trip for the opener. Just hoping the bay at trappers point melts enough to a get a line in the legal area. Watching the Ice out map for Minnesota there are lots of lakes north of I 94 that are Ice free earlier than last year.
2787529,iman63,2014-05-12 18:54:00,91,Any updates?
2790681,JJJMN,2014-05-13 14:01:00,153,North End at Trappers Point there is enough open water to get into legal fishing area. I don't think you can make it all the way to Rusty Myers yet. The camp is suppose to get Internet installed today and then they should be able to provide pictures of Ice Out or NOT OUT.
2793681,rpsnider,2014-05-14 08:02:00,3,New ice pictures are posted on Trappers Point Camps site now.
2793849,JJJMN,2014-05-14 08:53:00,153,"From the pictures at trapperspointcamp.com the water is open all the way to Rusty Myers. Hoping for a repeat of last years opener. Big, Hungry, Post Spawn, Females looking to eat anything in their path. By the middle of the week we should be able to venture out on the big lake for some trout. Good luck to all."
2795225,Catman59,2014-05-14 15:19:00,345,Here is White Sands Bay looking towards the narrows at 11am today. That's still the snowmobile trail on top of the ice ............. It aint going to be ready in a couple days
2795465,plumberjoe,2014-05-14 16:43:00,54,We talked to the camp owner at Marie's Bay which is an outpost comp on the north arm Sat and he said ice may not be off on main lake for the second weekend if it doesn't get going. We switched our trip to the 3rd week.
