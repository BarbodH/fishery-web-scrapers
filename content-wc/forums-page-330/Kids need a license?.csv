2804489,Mike Borger,2014-05-17 06:00:00,1554,As the original poster said he looked online and found that 18 or over an outdoor card is required. He asked what about a license?How is an outdoor card not a license? That's what is presumed with that statement. They kind of go hand in hand don't they?
2804537,benn,2014-05-17 06:13:00,48,"Thanks, Jay. That's what I was looking for. Must have missed it in my earlier search. We're not interested in bringing fish home, so will not be buying them a license. Might cause some problems eating shore lunch, though! Maybe the other licensed guys in our group will share?"
2804761,v-bay gord,2014-05-17 07:21:00,3168,"True, they go hand in hand....but to avoid any confusion the outdoor card is something that stores your information, the license, which is separate, allows you to fish. I see your point, but like I said having one without the other would be problematic."
2802561,benn,2014-05-16 12:50:00,48,"I plan on bringing my kids (all under 18) to Canada fishing this year. Can they fish under my non-resident license? I tried finding the requirements on-line, but they only say that they need an outdoor card if they are 18. What about a license?"
2802617,Gregking,2014-05-16 13:01:00,2658,"Ontario? My daughter (under 18) fishes under mine, however if I want to take back more fish I can get her a license but not needed for her to fish with me."
2802737,benn,2014-05-16 13:29:00,48,"Yes, Ontario. Thanks for the reply. I tried finding this in the regs, but they only referenced the outdoor card, not the fishing license."
2802793,Shellback,2014-05-16 13:43:00,8083,"You can only possess the limit of fish your adult license specifies though. So if you have a conservation license with a limit of 2 walleye, that's all you can have in your possession no matter how many kids you have with you. Plus a days possession limit is equal to a season limit."
2802801,Fisherman1792,2014-05-16 13:46:00,927,"As a resident, children under 18 do not need a license and are allowed a full limit, as for non-residents under 18 I would call the MNR to be sure. My guess is ""no"" they would not need a license but to bring back their limits find out for sure.Fisherman 1792"
2802993,BreezyPoint,2014-05-16 14:48:00,1581,"You are not limited to two fish a season, just two in possession, including what you eat on any given day.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk HD"

2804361,Mike Borger,2014-05-17 03:52:00,1554,outdoor card = license
2804473,v-bay gord,2014-05-17 05:51:00,3168,An outdoor card is not a license. Non resident children (under 18) do not need an outdoor card or a license to fish.....but they do if they want to keep a limit of fish.
