2814233,resq91,2014-05-19 22:29:00,6,I have always had 3X the success at dawn than I did at dusk.......real hard to get up though after a night of Molson and a belly full of grilled lake trout
2818025,stillangling,2014-05-20 20:11:00,149,"If you get a day when it is blowing, troll the leeward shore. Trout want the warmest water they can find if it is below 53 F but they get spooky if it is too calm. Under the right conditions they will be very shallow even at high noon. A few of my favourite spoons are Little Cleos. Len Thompsons and Williams Whitefish. Long lines with relatively heavy mono and a longer rod hooked up with a baitcaster work well. I also agree with a previous poster. Rapala Countdowns can be awesome. Older bait and not that common anymore but I sure hope they don't stop making them."
2576777,packpro,2014-03-20 20:13:00,695,"On the lake we fish, we jig for them after dinner. We found a hole that tops out at 4 ft., but slopes quickly to 60 ft. That is our spot. I put together a Visual Tackle box for our new guys. The picture is attached. These are all the lures that we have had success with for Lake Trout. Far and away the clear cut winner is the white jig head with 6"" twistertail. In addition to the twister tail we include two minnows that are left over from the morning fishing. This year we are going to try large-5"" white minnow profiles as mentioned in a previous post. The picture is labeled wrong as jig head is actually 1 oz. ="
2581001,ILScott,2014-03-22 05:00:00,139,"Depends when I go to Canada and what the water temp is. If it is early in the season and the water is cold I long line in 10-20 feet of water. I use a spinner rig like fishing for walleye and minnow. If they have transitioned to deeper water I target 40 ft of water in mid to late June. I will jig with a big white jig or troll with a five of diamonds or sutton spoon. Also, I get up early and troll close to islands because they like to feed in early morning shallows 15 to 20 feet I have found."
2797729,LoDo,2014-05-15 09:03:00,721,I had to dig the archives for this thread. For all those fishing in May we should have lakers on our mind. I've found luck jigging small to med size spoons. What are some of your favorites?
2797833,sptrix,2014-05-15 09:32:00,175,"I agree with everything on this thread thus far. I've spent hundreds of hours trying to hone in on how to best catch these fish. Here are a couple of thoughts:* I believe there are ALWAYS fish in deep basins, year-round, regardless of time of year* Lakers, especially in cold water, use all of the water column -- I can't tell you how many times I've caught a fish in the top 5 feet in 100' of water* Catching a few lake trout isn't difficult -- just troll and troll until you hit a couple.* Catching large numbers of trout is much more challenging. Early in the year, I still contend that they can be schooled up in deep(er) water than most guys think. We fish in Manitoba in mid- to late-June, but sometimes it's only a week since ice out. We still find fish deep -- over 70' at that time of year. The shallowest we've ever been able to put good numbers of fish in the boat has been around 40'. By good numbers, I mean over 40 fish in several hours of fishing.* I would use electronics to look for structure that is near deep water (by deep, I mean close to or over 100'). If you can find a large structure that comes up to 40' in that deep water, I can almost guarantee you'll find numbers of trout. You might have to really dissect the structure to find the ""spot on the spot,"" but I really think they'll be there. When you find baitfish on that structure, it's pretty much a slam dunk.* Lure selection doesn't seem to be a huge deal. Trout, IMO, are not a finicky fish - they are pigs. But they are maddening to find. We've caught them on jigs, spoons, plastics, sucker belly, whitefish strips, bulldawgs...the list goes on and on. FWIW, I prefer a 1.5 oz bucktail because of its versatility. But they will hit anything. As for jigging, I prefer the superlines because of the hookset advantage. I also prefer at least a 7' rod with at least a MH rating.Best of luck to you. I, too, cannot wait to get up to Canada to catch some lakers. Hoping to have our best year ever.SPTRIX"
2797921,JayM5209,2014-05-15 09:53:00,1050,"LoDo, early in the season I mostly long line troll for lakers, as noted in my earlier post. However, when jigging I've had good luck with a silver/pearl inset Crocodile spoon and a small blue/silver Little Cleo. The last four or five years a new favorite jigging tool has taken over my lake trout jigging - a large blade bait. . . large, as in 2.75""-3"". Color doesn't seem to matter but my best one is a crude looking hand painted red & white. If this year turns out be be as good as the last several, I won't bother to pack anything for laker jigging but three or four big blade baits.9 days and I'll be on my favorite laker lake!!!"
2805545,resq91,2014-05-17 15:05:00,6,"We hired a guide for lakers last year and he suggested we use a bait rig called a ""Herring Teaser"" They are available through a company in BC called Eagle Eye Outdoors or Outfitters. Made by Rys Davis I believe. Bait with a whole fresh herring........worked awesome trolled 1.2 - 1.5mph early season."
2806801,Cumminsram2010,2014-05-18 05:31:00,396,Bottom bouncer large spin n glow and a Bowie fly behind the spin n glow. Works better than any other trolling method I have ever tried. We use this on Lake Michigan on the down riggers with a big garbage can flasher.
2806969,123chadder,2014-05-18 06:36:00,429,"what is a bowie fly?i googled it,but no info..."
2807417,Cumminsram2010,2014-05-18 07:55:00,396,Stupid auto correct it is supposed to say HOWIE fly. Pick one that is close to the forage species color and cut the top loop off of the leader and slide on your spin n glow. That's how we fish them or you can tie your own flies. I like a longer leader than what the flies come with so I usually make one about 6ft long out of 25-30lb floro.
2808689,SteveJ715,2014-05-18 13:42:00,59,"Sounds like some guys chase lakers in the early evening hours. In your experience, how late will they be active? We are staying at an outpost cabin on a trout and pike lake again this year, so it will be easy to get out and troll around the islands nearby after dinner (we have had zero success jigging for them but it's a goal for me for this year). That said, it seems like once it gets close to dark we're wasting our time. I'm so accustomed to walleye fishing where it seems like sometimes they will hit all night if you stayed out there. But in your experience do the lakers head to bed around a certain hour? Or should we switch to glow-in-the-dark stuff as the evening wears on?Thanks in advance - lot of great info here.- Steve"
2568089,Mohleye,2014-03-18 16:42:00,368,"I like Zeebee's advice also, but if you enjoy jig fishing as opposed to trolling like I do, you can have good luck using a white or blue shad-like tail or a 4"" tube tail on a regular jig head. I had good luck last spring on a white Walleye Assassin paddle tail. Tipped with a minnow if you have them. You can cast and slowly retrieve and kind of ""swim"" your jig rather than bouncing it on the bottom as you would for walleye. You can also troll with the above jigs. I've caught big walleyes doing this in the spring as well. Are you going to Wamserville?"
2568113,Swamp_Donkey_Slayer,2014-03-18 16:52:00,42,Zeebee seems to be the man. Like your advice as well never tried using jigs like that...sure will give it a try.I am going to Wamersville. Be my 5th year there...amazing place. You been?
2568521,LoDo,2014-03-18 19:21:00,721,"Me, ha! I've been! Every year with you my friend! Leaving again third week of May. Good ""laker"" thread. Seems to me like fishing for walleye, donkey's and trout are all roughly in the same areas in the early spring. We have a caught a few the past few years on Donald. We were randomly catching them on jigs, etc nothing fancy! Love all the good suggestions. Will def pick up some new tackle this season. Thanks for all the advice!"
2568713,zeebee,2014-03-18 20:07:00,1144,"Try ""butterflying"" a trout....easier than it may appear in the link below. Stuff and bake...lotsa onions. Keep em under 5 lbs unless you like a real potent fishy taste.http://www.shaddlakecabins.com/bestw...m#.Uyj63oU2CHQ"
2569809,FishFry2012,2014-03-19 07:53:00,27,"We go just north of Vermillion Bay every Memoroial Week. We've caught some from a bank in 20-25FOW some years, but this past year we tried a deep lake(60-80ft). I marked some with my electronics but we weren't able to catch any. I'll have to try some of the ledges this year. We typically used spoons and sometimes tipped them with minnoes. I heard Lake Trout have a good sense of smell so figured this helped."
2569857,Swamp_Donkey_Slayer,2014-03-19 07:57:00,42,That looks greats...have not baked one in a while. Really need to do that. We have a smoker up there we have used a couple times. Turned out great. This year we are going to take some quality wood up for smoking. Using pine or any left over scraps of woods were not ideal.
2569969,JayM5209,2014-03-19 08:24:00,1050,"If you can get your hands on a sucker, use a small strip of sucker meat. In my experience that works better than a minnow. Years ago we used to fish for lakers in a lake we accessed by a 30-40 minute run up a small creek. I'd net a sucker out of the creek and while we waited for the fire to burn down for shore lunch I'd put a piece of sucker meat on a treble hook, add a split shot and just toss it out from shore as far as I could. Be sure the rod is tied to something, not just laying on a rock or against the gunwale of the boat!! More than one lake trout went back to camp as a result of that lazy lunch break technique!"

2567393,Swamp_Donkey_Slayer,2014-03-18 13:31:00,42,After a long day of walleye and northern fishing followed by an early dinner I really enjoy going trolling for Lakers. However my success rate is very low. In year 1 and 2 we were in Trout Lake (near Red Lake) and had some success using spoons and cast master. The last four we moved to more remote and less populated waters of Donald lake in Woodland Caribou Park. The lake is smaller and not as deep but plenty of 100' sections. I know the lake has trout in it as we catch several of them while jigging. But never intentionally catch them while actively targeting them. Obviously time of year will make a difference in depth and location. Almost all years we are there in the first 3 weeks of walleye season. Every year I tell myself that I am going to read up and study in the off season to try to pick up some tricks and tips but never have. Can someone help a guy out with a couple tips or pointers?
2567457,speckmaster,2014-03-18 13:47:00,17,Run spoons in shallow areas (6-15 ft) that are near deeper water. The lakers are up high when the water is still cool. Nothing fancy to catching them.
2567465,zeebee,2014-03-18 13:53:00,1144,"At that time of year LT's can be anywhere in the water column making them harder to target however, your best bet is to find bait fish in the shallows, say 10- 25', and troll thin minnow Raps like a J-11. Ive had my most consistent luck on such shallow flats with streams feeding into them where the warmer waters attract the spawning/post spawn bait fish. Leave the spoons alone till later in the season.As a side note, pulled a 33lbs laker outta Trout Lake a couple years ago but that was mid August when they are bunched up in deeper basins and easier to target."
2567497,Swamp_Donkey_Slayer,2014-03-18 13:59:00,42,Great advice. We were always fishing the deeper waters (80-100') but higher in the water column about 20'-30'. Will make the adjustment you suggest. Do you have a preferred size or color for that depth and time of year.
2567513,zeebee,2014-03-18 14:02:00,1144,"Ive had good luck with Rapala floating jointed in J-9 & J-11 sizes, perch, blue/silver or silver/black."
2567521,lassh,2014-03-18 14:02:00,553,"The lakers should still found in relatively shallow water in Donald at that time of year. Trolling crank baits near drop offs should work in the early season. Floating Rapalas, Husky jerks, wally divers etc. will all pick up lake trout. They are typically spread out at this time of year. Another pattern to try is to use your electronics over the deeper sections to see where the cisco schools are, and fish flutter spoons behind bead chain sinkers or snap weights just about at the depths where the baitfish are. If you do find that they are down deep, then blade baits or 1 to 2 oz. buck tail jigs can be used to get down to them. The guys on Hammerhead (just upstream of Donald) expected a great trout week last year at a similar time due to the late ice out but only caught a few of them. I'm not sure why it wasn't better last year. I know you have a great trip. That area is beautiful."
2567545,Swamp_Donkey_Slayer,2014-03-18 14:05:00,42,33lbs...great job I love to real in one of those bad boys. Targeting bait fish is what I have been trying to do...but with spoons not thin minnow raps. I will give that a go as well.
2567553,speckmaster,2014-03-18 14:09:00,17,"As far as size goes, Swamp, 4-5"" spoons. I like using a black/white combo, but all lakes will probably be a bit different. Silver, gold, and chartreuse are also good bets."
2567617,Swamp_Donkey_Slayer,2014-03-18 14:32:00,42,Thanks guys for all the info this is great. I needed to do something different and this gives me several things to try. Speckmaster welcome to walleye central...I just joined as well. So addicted love this site
2567745,JayM5209,2014-03-18 15:20:00,1050,"x 2 on zeebee's advice. Plus, if you have some, try Rapala CDs in black/silver, black/gold, blue/silver, or the black/silver Shad Rap in the larger sizes. These are my favorites in the 1st two or three weeks of the season while the water is still cold. At that time of the year I long line the Rapalas - with an occasional troll using a Canadian Wiggler - without additional weight. Don't be afraid to run in close to the shoreline, I've caught lakers in 5' of water! I fish south of where you'll be (just south of Perrault Falls) and last year week 1 and week 2 we had the best laker fishing in 25 years, both in terms of numbers and size for the lake we fish. One of the most productive areas was running the boat about 15' from the shoreline rocks where it dropped straight down to 45' of water. The trout were only 8'-10' down right against that rock wall.Have fun, and post an after trip report!"
