2812569,Carnhzkr,2014-05-19 13:56:00,964,"The US Hockey HOF is in Eveleth, by the way. Not in Hibbing as someone suggested earlier. I only know because it's right on the drive through town. I've never been to it."
2814321,Golden Eagle,2014-05-20 05:11:00,2642,"It's located on the right, as you enter Superior. It's worth the time and the cost of admission. A highlight of our visit was spending nearly an hour talking with World War II vets who were manning the table at the entrance of the building. They were special. Their stories set the tone for the rest of the tour."
2815201,deadhead1,2014-05-20 08:30:00,193,There is a back road east of Duluth and then north that has some neat stuff to see. There is a wolf center and some neat small towns to stop at. I think there is also a bear center. Take Hwy 2 north to Ely and then back west to join on to Hwy 58 to International falls. Stop at tourist center in Duluth--they always have good ideas of what there is to see.
2806809,Slushfish,2014-05-18 05:34:00,263,"Making our 7th trip to LOTW mid July with wife and 7&14 yr old boys. Normally drive from N. Michigan, spend night in Deluth, drive rest of way to Nestor Falls next day. we've decided to take extra days this year and do a little sightseeing along the way. Was wondering if anyone has any points of interest or things they do along the way on their trip. Not looking for all day excursions, but things not too far out of the way that might take a couple hours. Will be travelling across Mi. U.P. to Ashland, Superior, Deluth, and up to International Falls. Any and all ideas welcome. Thanks Everyone, Slushfish"
2807329,@Lunker,2014-05-18 07:44:00,835,"Stop at I think it's called Mineview in Virginia, MN, on the right side of the highway as you're headed north. A very interesting (and free) peek into the whole iron mining thing, including how incredibly deep the mines are. They even have a couple of their monster trucks you can crawl around on - huge. That was one of those ""I'm gonna stop there someday"" places until I finally did. Also the hockey hall of fame in, what is it, Hibbing? If you're into that. There's also a tour you can take of an actual Great Lakes freighter in Duluth, forget the name of it. I thought that was very fascinating. http://www.decc.org/william-a-irvin/"
2807577,LOW1,2014-05-18 08:13:00,2828,"Lunker is right about Mineview, especially if the kids like big trucks. The entire harbor area of Duluth is worth seeing. You could drive up the Lake Superior coast and see Grand Marais - restored fur trading post and perhaps a boat ride to Isle Royale National Park. About ten miles west of The Junction (where Highway 71 turns north west of Emo) there is a cultural preserve/museum about the history and culture of the Rainy River area near where it enters Lake of the Woods. Above all, stop for lunch at Gordy's Top Hat in Cloquet and buy the kids a burger and a shake."
2810841,Stu,2014-05-19 07:57:00,472,"If you drive up the Lake Superior coast, be sure to stop at the Split Rock Light House in Two Harbors. The tour takes about an hour and there is a 30 minute video that is pretty cool. If you go thru Cloquet, stop by the Lindholm Service Station, it is the only gas station designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The Chocolate Moose in International Falls is absolutely the best place for dinner."
2811185,Breal31,2014-05-19 09:13:00,13,The Vince Shute Wildlife Sanctuary in Orr. It's like going to the zoo except the Bears are all wild and you can view them up close...im sure the kids would like ithttp://www.americanbear.org/
2811353,MikeinMN,2014-05-19 09:49:00,190,"Plan a day or two in Duluth and exploring Minnesota's North Shore of Lake Superior. Check out duluthboats.com for a schedule of freighter entries into the Port of Duluth. It is pretty cool to watch these big boats come in just a few feet away through the narrow entry. Another website for Duluth info is visitduluth.com, it has many places and activities for the immediate Duluth area including the Great Lakes Aquarium, train rides, and museums. The North Shore itself has several (5 or so) state parks that are well worth visiting. A $25 vehicle pass allows entry to all of our state parks for the year. Jay Cooke State Park is only a few miles west of Duluth in addition to the North Shore parks. All of these are exceptional parks with waterfalls, lighthouses, and whitewater rivers. More info on state parks at exploreminnesota.com"
2811777,Lovetofish,2014-05-19 11:01:00,458,If you go a little farther north of Nester there is some shopping at Sioux Narrows and Rushing River Provincial Park further north.
2812009,Slushfish,2014-05-19 11:49:00,263,"Thanks guys, we were thinking about the mine view, great lakes aquarium looks pretty cool. Like the wildlife sanctuary in Orr too. Didn't know about Gordy's Top Hat. We usually come through Int. Falls late morning, does the Chocolate Moose have good lunch, breakfast? I've heard alot of people talk about it, we'll put that on the list. That's all good stuff, if anyone has any other ""can't miss"" ideas, please let me know. Slushfish"
2812169,Carnhzkr,2014-05-19 12:18:00,964,"I've been taking my two boys since they were 6. They're now 19 & 16. I've found some interesting things to do to break up the drive and give them something to do other than sit in the boat for a week. Mineview, as previously mentioned is a quick and easy way to get their minds off the drive. I stopped at the Subway in Evelith and got sandwiches to go then I took an unexpected turn at the entrance to Mineview without telling anyone where I was going. Both the kids and my wife were surprised. We had a picnic on top of the hill. I took a few pics of them climbing on the big equipment. One time, while at the visitor center at Mineview, the lady told us about an actual mine tour in Soudan. Soudan is about 18 miles to the east of the highway, toward Ely. There's a state park there where they take you down about half a mile into an old mine and give a really nice tour. Do a search for it on the internet to get more info. There is a fee, and the first time we stopped, we turned around because it was way too busy and we'd have to wait a couple hours for the tour, so we headed back. I think you used to be able to make reservations in advance, but not sure you can do that any more.The first time I took my oldest son, when he was six, we took the free tour of the paper mill in IF. It was the highlight of his trip. There is a minimum age of, I think 8 or 10, but they let him pass. He got to wear a hard hat, eye protection, and headphones with speakers so you can hear the tour guide. He loved watching the huge equipment in the plant pumping out reams of paper.This year, since we'll have time on our way up, we're going out of our way to Duluth. I plan to check out the Lift Bridge. It's free and sounds cool. There's also a free museum at the site of the Lift Bridge. I've never been there, so I can't give a review, but I'm sure you'll be able to see the big ships. I think both the young and old kids will enjoy it."
