1206590,tlee,2010-06-03 09:48:00,65,"I'm heading up to Besnard Lake, SK in the middle of June. Does anyone have some info on fishing for walleyes or lake trout. Do I need to take down riggers for the trout? If not, have you been to any of the lakes between the ND border and there?"
1206627,Waxy,2010-06-03 11:44:00,2938,"That's quite the hike lol. On Besnard, you should be able to catch the walleyes on just about anything, so keep it simple. I've seen them caught on a bottle cap with a hook on it up there. Simple jigs with minnows will be your best bet hands down, but you can cast cranks too. I've never fished for lake trout so I can't really help you, but from what I understand, you shouldn't need downriggers this time of year. As for places to fish on the way up - both Lake Diefenbaker and Last Mountain Lake in southern SK have world class walleye and pike fishing. The world record Rainbow trout came out of Diefenbaker.

Just got back from 2 weeks up there and the Walleyes are still in the bays. Use 1.5 ounce bottom bouncers and worm harnesses trolled slow( 1.1 to 1.5 mph). Once you find jig up with 1/8 jig tipped with minnow only. We also had great sucess with Berkley Alive 3"" in Smelt colour. You get so many bites jigging the Eyes will steal your minnow. This was not happening with the Berkley. Hooking percentage increased. Find the warmest water in the bays and you will find the walleye. Excellent Pike fishing as well."

1207269,Guest,2010-06-05 12:06:00,0,No problem. Another tip I would give you is to get a guide. At least for first day. If not you will lose your skeg within 10 minutes. Let me know if you need any other info on Besnard or any other lake in Northern Saskatchewan.
1207347,Sanchez,2010-06-05 18:42:00,7,"I'll be heading up in mid to late June as well. Just wondering if there is any markers on the lake for troublesome reef's? Is there any direction to travel where fishing is better (head north, west etc)? Thanks"
1207504,Guest,2010-06-06 10:13:00,0,Unfortunately there are no marks for reefs. Don't trust the Topo maps either. Most people head West under the bridge. If you do head West try Rice Bay if water temp still below 60 degrees. For big Pike Banana Bay is the ticket this time of year. As soon as the water warms though the Pike move out. Pay close attention to the water temp when you go. If it has warmed significantly most of the Walleye will be moved out of the Bays. Right now they are still in the bays but just the small Males are biting well. If you can time that magical time when the big Female's are recovered from spawn you will have a panic on your hands! Can be incredible. The Ice went off the earliest I can remember (Apr 30th) so Mid June is like July this year so far. If it gets warm you might have trouble finding the Eyes but like I say let the water temp be your guide.
1208001,Sanchez,2010-06-07 23:16:00,7,Thanks for the tips....much appreciated.
2805609,RoosterSlayer,2014-05-17 15:59:00,2,"Perhaps I could take you up on your offer of tips. One time chance to fish Besnard next spring in mid-May. Been decades since I've fished for pike and walleye. Any lake info for Besnard in mid-May would be appreciated, such as average spawn stages of pike and walleye in mid-May on that lake, water temps and clarity, bottom material or structure, predominant weedline depths, etc. Leeches present?"
2805865,LoDo,2014-05-17 17:34:00,721,"Ha! The far North. I've fished Jan Lake which is pretty close to where you are going. Jan Lake is big water east of Besnard. Incredible Lodge, wow!! As many have said, keep the walleye fishing simple. They'll hit on anything. I just recently started fishing lakers the past 5 yrs and don't feel i have the education to give out any pointers. I'm still learning."
