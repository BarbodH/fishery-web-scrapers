2793921,heritage2008,2014-05-14 09:02:00,92,"Looking to visit one of these lake in mid-july. Have done some research/reading here and online. Not taking my boat from Ohio so looking to find a decent cabin with boats on one of these lakes. Would like to here from those that have stayed and fished for walleyes at either in the last 2 or so years--please no camp owners.Looking at Gow-Bush-Kon and BigBear on Horwood.Not a newbie so given structure and a bit of wind I'll be using the frying panThanks, David"
2794025,Mike Borger,2014-05-14 09:23:00,1554,"Have never fished either but have had positive feedback from several people on Horwood. A client of mine fished it in July as well and they killed them, including a couple of walleye in the 30"" range. FWIW almost all of their fish were caught trolling bouncers and harnesses in 30 plus feet of water.Have never even heard of Big Bear, but lots of positive feedback on Horwood Outpost."
2795785,Paul H,2014-05-14 18:25:00,1232,"Gowganda gets a lot of pressure - or did - have not been there in > 10 years. Used to hit the area every year and stayed about 10 miles out (west) Hit Duncan, Wapus, Firth and others. Stayed at Gow Busk Kon one time over 20 years ago. I think one of the local camp owners is on here. Can't comment or Horwood. Both look tp be similar mileage for me - Zanesville area. Foe some reason there are a lot of Ohioans that go to Gowganda."
2795857,heritage2008,2014-05-14 18:43:00,92,"Hey Fellow Ohioan, So where do you venture to in the North? Looked at Firth for smallmouth but seems limited on eyes? Sportmencamp is a cheap place to stay but sometimes cheap is cheap. Don't really want to tow 1500 miles--so many things can happen with a trailer even though I maintain it like it should be. Looking for good boats with 4 strokes and elec start. Basically a toss up right now. Looking at Big Bear camp at Horwood-seems like a place to hang a lure for a week. I can't find camps on Duncan--anywhere. Friends where I stayed in Zec Dumoine years ago drove there and said it is a great eyes lake. Crappie have been on fire--. You see any saugeye action down there? David"
2797089,Paul H,2014-05-15 06:58:00,1232,"I always took my own boat as that let me move to other lakes . But then I had one rear ended on the NT Thruway. Used to have a 16' Smokercraft - then a Lund 1890. Personally - since it's been years. No one had electric starts, but they were just starting to go to 4 stroke. On Duncan there is Duncan Lake Camp that is 10 miles up the Lake on an island. I stayed at Breeze Creek - small, does not advertize. Has 3 cottages It has some big eyes, lots of eaters, huge pike, monster perch and has probably changed as it was just starting to get smallmouth. It's 20 miles or so long - not that wide so it covers a huge area. Sportsmen's - know the owners, from PA, great people, small lake, limited eyes but fantastic smallmouth. Gowganda, other than the week years ago where we stayed there, I actually rarely would tow into town and fish it. Wapus creek which is the Montreal river has some great walleye and killer prop eating rocks and snags. There are tons of outlying lakes that get little pressure, many of the camps jeep basic boats at them. We ran into a couple guys from Akron area that stayed at Gow-Bush-Kon and never fished the lake. They hit a remote lake they trailerd to every day - jut went for big pike. There are several camps towards Shinning Tree - some with river access that goes for miles. Huston Lake is also that direction - used to be owned by a couple from Chardon. FWIW - wife's late uncle had been going to Gowganda area since the road was just a trail. He knew the original owner of Gow-Bush-Kon and saw him build it up over the years."
2797353,adempsey,2014-05-15 07:51:00,963,"I stayed at Horwood Lake Lodge a few years ago for a week in July. Decent grounds, cottages and boats.We had a hard time with fishing though. The lodge is located at the end of the eastern arm, which is deep and narrow. Something we weren't accustomed to fishing. We did have a couple good days when we went further down the lake; and when we switched up our tactics a bit.Horwood lake is a nice scenic lake at the southern end. It's quite isolated for a drive-in camp. However, Big Bear is located right where Horwood spills into Groundhog Lake at the north end of Horwood Lake. It looks like a fairly large camp too. In the northern section of the lake there are a fair number of private cottages as well. We never had a chance to fish the northern ""arm"" of the lake at all, but it has a bunch of islands and looks much shallower compared to the eastern arm. Definitely has a potential.I figured if I ever went back I'd go to Horwood Outpost, which is a boat-in camp located more centrally. Away from most people and it gives access to what I would consider prime fishing areas for pike and walleye."
2798169,FrankLeigh,2014-05-15 10:56:00,80,"Hi David,I don't qualify for ""the last 2 or so years"", but I have fished both. Horwood was about 6 years ago, and Gowganda and area was thru the '70's up until the early '90's.We stayed at Gow-Bush-Kon on most of those Gowganda trips until the owner passed away and the camp closed for a while. Then we moved over to Auld Reekie and also to another place across from Bullock's. (Can't remember the name.) We never failed to catch walleye and ate them every night. There were years when we made three trips.Horwood was a September trip and was less than successful. For a number of reasons, we did not return.I have talked to the current owner of Gow-Bush-Kon and I would like to return there one year.If you are looking for more info on Gowganda Lake and many of the surrounding lakes, you can PM me.FrankLeigh"
2804497,north560,2014-05-17 06:01:00,53,"Hi Frank sounds like you are due to come back to Gow-Bush-Kon Lodge. Fishing is still as good. Have up-graded the boats so you are fishing in comfort, 25 4strokes electric start, fish finder,livewell padded swivel seats. Going out today for the opening of walleye, supper will taste great. Hopefully see you soon."
