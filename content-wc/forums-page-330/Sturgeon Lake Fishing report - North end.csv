Got into camp last night and it had been a slow day also, everyone had caught limits and enjoyed that first shore lunch of the year. But they had to work for every fish. White Fish and Northerns have been caught as well as Walleye up to 24in. No trout seen in camp so far. South end of lake is Ice Fishing from what I've heard. Today the weather has been over cast with lots of Sunshine. Shore lunch today was fantastic. Water Temp 42 deg. On vacation, well worth the wait. Good luck to all"

2818369,JJJMN,2014-05-20 21:36:00,153,"Water level is about as high as we've seen in 20plus years. I would say the water level is about a foot higher than last year, lots of killer rocks have disappeared. Water temp today about 46deg. Walleye fishing was fantastic this morning. Our boat with 3 guy's caught about 50 fish for the morning. With several in the 28-30inch range (all released). Late afternoon we were back out and it slowed down to maybe 10 fish for 3 hours. We did a run to town and stopped and checked the spawning stream up by the road and they were still stacked up in there. We were happy about the fact that the local crowed weren't back with garbage can's to fill with netted fish. It was cold and misting all day. We have high hope's for the morning outing. Northerns have been few but then the water temp hasn't come up much yet."
