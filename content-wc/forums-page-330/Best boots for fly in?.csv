2816153,adempsey,2014-05-20 11:39:00,963,"I looked at some Muck boots today. It seems to be that the Bogs basically copied them, no? There are also plenty of Crocs that don't look like the well known Croc clog. I have a pair of these ones."
2816273,Draco1206,2014-05-20 12:05:00,175,You're the man! I guess all the rest of us that are looking for a comfortable pair of boots are just wimps.
2811249,MrSimon,2014-05-19 09:25:00,922,"Almost all my trips north have been in July or August. I end up wearing flip flops or sandals almost the entire time. I also take along a good pair of waterproof hiking shoes that I wear on portage hikes or if it gets really cold and rainy. I've never taken a pair of boots north, and I've never needed them. But if I were to take a pair ..... Muck Boots all the way!"
2811905,Draco1206,2014-05-19 11:22:00,175,"Some of you guys obviously don't go on fly-ins in May or early June. Try wearing your flip flops when it's 35-40 degrees (F) and raining or spitting snow or you have a leaky boat like most of them at outpost camps. Must be flying in to the Florida Keys or Bahamas. This is a question our group struggles with also. You want something warm and comfortable for those cold rainy/snowy days yet must also be comfortable on those hot days. Knee high rubber boots like LaCrosse or Muck get too hot for me. I bought a pair of 6"" high redhead rubber slip on boots last year and they were fine until we had a real cold rainy day and either I didn't pull my rainsuit down over the top of the boots or my rainsuit pulled up when I sat down but either way I ended up with very wet and cold feet. The top of those boots don't hug the ankles and don't tie so water can get in over the top. Was a pretty miserable day. I like some of the suggestions some are giving here and I'll keep trying to find the perfect boots for fly-ins. Until then I'll hope for warm sunny days."
2812297,Carnhzkr,2014-05-19 12:53:00,964,"I have noticed two different lodge owners wearing Crocks. I've never owned a pair of Crocks, but I can see why these would work well in the summer. Won't keep your feet dry, but they're light, comfortable, and don't have to worry about them getting wet."
2812361,JayM5209,2014-05-19 13:11:00,1050,"Buy a pair! TODAY!! I swore vehemently that I'd never be caught dead wearing something like that. Then, three summers ago, I bought a pair. They are my warm weather, all summer long, for everything footwear. Not good for warmth in cold weather, but they sure are versatile for everything else. Need to wade into the water when retrieving your boat? No worry, just go. Water sloshing in the bottom of a camp boat? Keep fishing without fret. Obviously, I like Crocs! On NWO trips, they're my hot weather alternative to uninsulated pac boots."
2812505,poultryman,2014-05-19 13:37:00,183,"Ill second the Bogs low cut shoes. I have a farm, I live in Muck boots or Bogs all year long. I prefer the Bogs low cut rubber shoes when its warmer out, or when I simply dont need high boots. The neoprene is warm and they are very comfortable. Muck Boots wear out in the heel faster than the Bogs boots, on my anyway. My heels seem to cut right through the neoprene liners. The Bogs have lasted longer than the Muck boots."
2813513,MorganMan,2014-05-19 18:45:00,341,Bogs. This ends the thread.

2814817,MorganMan,2014-05-20 07:25:00,341,"LOL, this comes from the guy who let us use his electric knife when he couldn't go one year and had pictures (faces) of me and our younger brother pasted to figures of soft gay porn. Had them cut out and put in the knife case and whatever else he sent with us. I'm sure those shoes are in his closet!?"
2814833,MorganMan,2014-05-20 07:26:00,341,Are they waterproof?
2815745,Aaron-IN,2014-05-20 10:18:00,500,"I've been doing fly-ins for 30 years in early June, never once needed boots. I guess some of us are just tougher than others......"
2808657,MorganMan,2014-05-18 13:26:00,341,"OK, go with the Mucks if you want to!? Probably wise because what I have noticed is the ladies are really attracted to the Bogs! Sometimes too much! May get in the way of fishing. Mucks might be safer for that reason."
2808769,forgop,2014-05-18 14:13:00,880,"I have a pair of timberland euro hiker boots. I don't know that they're waterproof, but my feet have never gotten wet in any application I've worn them in. (Obviously I don't go wading in anything that will likely result in wet feet). They're also well insulated and it takes a cold day for my feet to get cold. I've had these boots for almost 20 years and never looked back. Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-N900A using Tapatalk"

2808905,polaris-pete,2014-05-18 15:21:00,343,"Mucks are great boots.Many styles, heights, insulated, non-insulated and fit well to walk in and most of all lightweight. I have different pairs for Summer Fishing, Hunting and Ice Fishing and just got a new pair for Snowmobiling."
2809145,keek,2014-05-18 16:48:00,1003,The tried and true boot for standing around in wet boats and walking around on slippery surfaces is the Xtra Tuf boot. They are called the Alaskan sneaker for good reason. They are comfortable and almost every alaskan owns a pair. 100% waterproof. I love mine.
2809177,keek,2014-05-18 16:50:00,1003,"Here you go: ""There seems to be an unbreakable bond between owners and their XTRATUF boots. There's nothing mysterious or questionable about this loyalty. Simply stated if asked Â– XTRATUF boots are the most comfortable, best value, hard-wearing boots on the market. XTRATUF boots were originally developed in the 1960's for fishermen on the West Coast of the United States.

2807521,jkaup,2014-05-18 08:08:00,56,We'll be leaving on my third fly-in within the past 10 years in about 12 days. The first time water was over the dock and I spent a week with wet feet. The next time I took a pair of hunting boots that I sprayed well with water proofer. They lasted about 3-4 days and started leaking after a muddy portage. I have some tall Red Head Rubber boots but they don't provide the greatest fit so I'm on the hunt for the perfect waterproof boot. Any suggestions?
2807633,SinOrSwim,2014-05-18 08:22:00,1528,"Rubber ones are about the only thing that will keep your feet dry. The problem is if it's hot or cold they can be uncomfortable. I used to take some boot covers. They were made of a water proof material and a rubber sole. They slipped over my boots and I only used them if it was raining. A little cumbersome but they were lightweight and I only used them when needed. Otherwise, just plain old rubber boots are the best.I used to waterproof the boots I wore and the other thing we all did was search around the cabin for some pieces of wood. Find a couple pieces of 2x6 or something like that and put it in the bottom of your boat. You can put your feet on that to keep them off the bottom of the boat which always had water in it. Also, we always took battery powered fans. Otherwise you can't dry anything out. I used it to sleep better and if things got wet, some air flow dried them out faster."
2807649,Pooch,2014-05-18 08:29:00,4619,"""ProLine"" Black with redish bottom and top ring.http://www.amazon.com/Line-121M-8-Ru...pro+line+bootsBuy them at Farm King or various stores. Reasonably priced, light weight, goes on and off easily. Several of us wear them all the time. They don't seem to get hot unless it is really hot out. Then I just kick them off and go barefoot. Probably should throw a cheap pair of deck shoes in the boat and not be barefoot around hooks and stuff.When using a camp boat, which always seem to leak at least a little, the cool aluminum floor seems to keep my feet from getting hot.They are good ""chore"" boots around home. I get several years out of each pair. Usually they will start to crack where our ankles pivot eventually. Very comfortable as they are not real stiff like others we have tried.Pooch"
2807673,MikeMcC,2014-05-18 08:35:00,72,"Muck Boots! So comfortable, breathable, waterproof...well worth the price!"

2807985,MorganMan,2014-05-18 10:04:00,341,"I have had a couple pair of the Bogs boots over the years for the exact reason Sin Or Swim mentioned.....water in the bottom of the boats while on a fly-in. I found the low cut slip ons perfect as they fit well and are an easy on and off without having to tie your boots up. They do make some that are higher cut if you need to wade into shallow water, but I haven't needed anything like that. Here is what I have.http://www.bogsfootwear.com/shop/style/71465-974.html"
2808137,TheDFP,2014-05-18 10:23:00,39,"I have a pair of white rubber boots that are 12"" high. They are made for saltwater fishing. I put them on when we start unloading the truck and don't take them off until we get the truck loaded on the way home. Feet stay dry and there is plenty of room in them to let air circulate or you can wear two pair of socks to keep your feet warm. One philosophy I go by on a fly-in trip is you are probably never more than a few feet from water the whole week! Wet feet are no fun!"
2808233,jkaup,2014-05-18 10:35:00,56,Many Thanks Folks! I think I'll try the muck boots. I'm looking for lightweight and a better fit. Bum knee gets sore wearing the tall rubber ones I have now. Thanks for the replies.My 3 year old likes the smilies!
2808257,octanehi5,2014-05-18 10:40:00,1104,You may also want to try goretex socks in any boot they will keep your feet dry even in sneakers
2808409,JayM5209,2014-05-18 11:20:00,1050,"My favorite boat/camp boot for 25+ years has been the 10"" uninsulated pac boot. LL Bean made them famous years ago, but Cabelas sells them at 1/2 the price. Get the 8"" or 10"", uninsulated. Feet are always dry, don't get too hot, an extra pair of socks if it's really cold, comfortable. If you get a good fit, they're good for short hikes to portage lakes. Light weight.I just retired a pair I've worn for more than 20 years and will break in the new pair next week. These boots and a pair of sneakers will cover any situation on your fly-in."
