2785321,feathersandfins,2014-05-12 11:15:00,10,"We're headed up to Lac Charlotte with Air Taramac this summer. We figure we'll take our time driving and will overnight somewhere in the Ottawa area (an hour south or north, out of the city itself) the first night. Since our flight is at 8:00 a.m., we'd like to stay close to the Clova the next night. The one and only hotel in Clova (the base the outfitter flies out of) is about $85. That seems high but maybe that's because it's the only place in town. The town of Parent is about 60 miles south (and east) of Clova. We're thinking there are more housing options in that town. If the weather is nice, we can just pitch a tent. Actually, we'd prefer to do that than stay in a hotel. I've been having a hard time finding information online or through AAA for Parent. Anyone know the areas and can make recommendations?"
2785721,Andre (wallyandre),2014-05-12 12:36:00,2274,"There is some in Parent; I can't comment on how they are, never slept in one of thosehttp://www.quebecgetaways.com/hotel-en_parent"
2785857,MrSimon,2014-05-12 13:13:00,922,"I own a cottage that is an hour South of Ottawa, on the US side, just over the border. If it isn't rented for the night you need it, we might be able to work something out. Send me a PM to discuss. Here is a link to the cottage http://www.vrbo.com/557104"
2786193,fosterthedog,2014-05-12 14:11:00,51,"Don't know how far your drive is but Mont Laurier is the last major town you go through before the Parent /Clova road. Lots of hotels to choose from about 4 1/2-5 hours to Clova. in regards to Auberge Clova talk to Eliane or Jean see if they won't get you a better price. The people that own both hotels in town are their relations. I paid $69 US last year for the place on the other side of the lake. Have a great trip, haven't fished Charlotte for a few years as it was a portage lake back then and was off limits until the cabin was built. Have fished Hebert for many years any questions you have PM me and I'll do my best to help(ie., travel fishing tips)."
2793169,TheDFP,2014-05-14 06:24:00,39,"I would just stay in Clova. It appears you are taking your time getting up there. You can wake up and go get something to eat. Then take care of the weight check,fishing licences, pay........ Sure would be a lot less stressful."
2794225,rsiminski,2014-05-14 10:19:00,53,"Last July we stayed at a residents house that had the upstairs turned into rooms that they rented out. I think there was 5 rooms and 2-3 rooms had there own bathroom/shower. Basically you had the whole upstairs to your self. We booked with Ceasars North Camps and the rooms were booked through them. For some reason I think we only paid around $40 per person. I would call either Tamarac or Ceasars and see if you can find out if this option is available. In the past we have always stayed at the school and I dont remember it being that expensive. Maybe Tamarac is charging you more per night than Ceasars does, but maybe they just increased the price this year."
2810201,octanehi5,2014-05-19 05:54:00,1104,"We have stayed in both the Auberge and Hotel Tamarac, I prefure hotel Tam, you can get breakfast or dinner right in the hotel, Dominic from Clova owns them both.The other option is to drive to Mount Laurier only about 2 hrs north of Ottawa. Air Tam and Ceasars north have nothing to do with what you are charged for hotels. In the past 10+ yrs we find it much easier to get the long drive out of the way,A good nights sleep in Clova,Than take off for your trip, I'm sure the can find you a spot to camp if you want. Have a great time on Charlotte. Ron"
2810817,keek,2014-05-19 07:55:00,1003,I agree. I made the drive from upstate NY to Clova a few years ago in a convoy of vehicles following Octanehi5 and it wasn't that bad at all.
2812049,bloom08,2014-05-19 11:52:00,13,I would stay in Clova. Stay at the Auberge there. Its like 70 bucks for a room so you split it. 35 per person. you can wake up and eat right at the gas station there. we have done this many times. easier to drive there and spend night instead of waking in morning and making drive into clova for flight. much more refreshing.
2813297,NY Walleye,2014-05-19 17:49:00,78,I would stay in clova as well. We are heading back to Lac Hebert in July. The flight into the lake is 7:30am. Easier to stay in Clova and then head out for the week. We were gong to try yo stay in Mt Laurier but have to catch the flight in at 7:30.
