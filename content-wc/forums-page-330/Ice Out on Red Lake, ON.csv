2803153,HeHooksHimself,2014-05-16 15:39:00,725,We will be a bit south of you on Wine Lake pulling in giant lakers and hoping we miss the walleye post spawn lull I am a bit anxious and could leave tonight if necessary. Hooks
2803441,Pikeslayer8,2014-05-16 18:19:00,1460,"Awesome man! We were all pullin for your trip! Just too hard to lug a Swamp Donkey all the way from kangarrooville and not let him fish.

HooksMan Hooks, them giant lakers floppin in the shallows got your name written all over um. Might be a good thing, might not, considering your name. I wish you both great trips!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2803601,LoDo,2014-05-16 18:50:00,721,Swamp Donkey arrived a few hrs ago in Denver. He'll have a few days to acclimate us westerners before we fly to Minny and begin the walleye adventure. Going to be interesting early season. Post trip fishing report coming first week of June.
2803665,lassh,2014-05-16 19:08:00,553,"Good luck to y'all. You might be hitting it just right. The lakers will be shallow any way. Have a nice trip and welcome to North America Swamp Donkey! He gets to see 2 of the many beauties in America- the Rockies and the Canadian Shield. It doesn't get much better. I would like to see Australia some day, but I still have some North America to see yet.Have a great trip and be safe everybody!"

I wish you both great trips!!!!!!!!!!!!!! __________________ Hey PikeSlayer, a couple hook stabs for a 25lb. laker seems like a good trade off to me! For now I have a day of yard work and a couple of episodes of ""The Next Bite"" to keep me busy. We will leave Valpo about 2pm Thurs. to get through Chi Town and into VBay Fri. morning. Friday night with Gail and Brad at Pine Grove, dinner and breakfast at Buster's and then into the wilderness next Sat. morning. Not going to be a productive week at work, I'm sure. Fish On! my friends! Look for a brag report in early June"
2779865,LoDo,2014-05-10 15:50:00,721,Do you foresee planes flying out of Howey Bay by the opener or soon after?
2780153,Enid Elizabeth,2014-05-10 18:23:00,59,"Because there is so much skidoo and vehicle traffic on Howey Bay during the winter, the snow is packed and the ice gets thicker. Fly-in lakes are always open before Howey Bay. Amik Outposts has great docks on the river and they are very kind to their competitors!! We are all packed at Johnny's dock waiting for Howey to open. Here is Johnnie's post Note his comment: Most of the airplanes that get maintained in Red Lake take off from the ice when the conditions are perfect. Right before the ice goes bad. They park at our dock because the river is always the first water in the area until Howey Bay opens which on most years is well after the other lakes. We don't mind doing favors for the neighbors. We are all competitors but we all work together and look after each other in this wild country! So for fly-in operations when Howey opens is not so important. I predict that come May 17, we may not be parked at our dock but most of our lakes will be open and we will be flying."
2780225,Golden Eagle,2014-05-10 18:40:00,2642,"A great example of your working together was October 6, 2012 when I needed a ride back to town. Airways teamed up by picking up each other's guests whenever it saved time and flights. Fuel was made available to whoever needed it. I was amazed at how well things were coordinated. Would have taken our government at least a week to do what you guys accomplished in one day."
2780345,Swamp_Donkey_Slayer,2014-05-10 19:14:00,42,I really like the sounds of that keep the positive info coming.
2783977,Enid Elizabeth,2014-05-12 06:40:00,59,"Nice steady rain today. Looks like no flying. It'll do a number on the ice though. A good wind would finish it off on the lakes west of Red Lake. Red Lake itself is breaking up, moving a bit, melting away from the shore and looking black"
2798185,Enid Elizabeth,2014-05-15 11:04:00,59,"Here is a picture of Douglas Lake taken last evening. I'm still planning to be there on Saturday afternoon,... it's gotta happen. Our planes are flying and I'll have more reports tonight. Call your outfitter as some lakes are opening up, others are a long way off and some planes are still frozen in at their bases. Soon Soon...."
2798417,tackleman,2014-05-15 12:18:00,444,this was just posted to facebook http://i1135.photobucket.com/albums/...redlakeice.jpg
2798473,LoDo,2014-05-15 12:44:00,721,"3""+ of ice is safe for someone under 225lbs to walk."
2798497,jkonop,2014-05-15 13:05:00,544,The trail off the Island!
2798505,bones82,2014-05-15 13:08:00,121,"Unless it's rotten or candled ice. Then 18"" of ice isn't safe. My guess it's this type of ice given the conditions. Be careful if you try it. Meaning, don't do it."
2740930,Enid Elizabeth,2014-04-30 08:10:00,59,We drilled the ice in front of our house where no skidoos or snowshoers have been and found 22 inches of ice. Some of that was already candled. We were expecting more. Strong winds and some warm weather are working away on that ice. Last year on May 1 we had 15 or 16 inches of ice. Next week we hope to fly planes off the ice and land on the river. We will be flying by opening weekend. Usually the remote smaller lakes are open about 10 days before Howey Bay. Here's a video from yesterday:http://www.viking-island.blogspot.ca...l-29-2014.html
2741114,LoDo,2014-04-30 08:48:00,721,Great news! Thanks a ton for the update. I'm pretty sure Chimo Air fly's in and out of Howey Bay. Our group is pushing the envelope this year with a 5/22 fly in. Here's to warm weather between now and then!!
2741234,Enid Elizabeth,2014-04-30 09:11:00,59,"Chimo Air does fly out of Howey Bay but if the ice is still in the bay, they will go to the river. Opening weekend is May 17, so you'll be fine for May 22. At least let's hope so!!!"
2763481,Enid Elizabeth,2014-05-06 10:10:00,59,"Planes off the ice and at the river. Thanks Amik for docking space! Hugh flew to the west end of Red Lake yesterday and found the narrows wide open: West Narrows, Wolf Narrows and Bow Narrows. everything else solid ice but a few small lakes are starting to look black. Arthur is going ice fishing for trout today, so hope to have pictures tonight."
2765273,Enid Elizabeth,2014-05-06 19:09:00,59,"My son, Arthur and 2 friends went out today and came home with supper. Fresh lake trout tasted great! They had a little trouble getting onto the ice but with an old Honda they were fine. Icing was great. Arthur lost a rod down the hole after a gallant try with entire arm down the hole. Most of us have been there. Must have been BIG."
2765353,vanscj76,2014-05-06 19:43:00,16,I am heading to Gull Rock For the opener. We are staying at Poplar Point. How doe the ice situation look over that direction?
2766089,Enid Elizabeth,2014-05-07 05:08:00,59,"Did you go there last year? Because I think this spring is very similar to last year so far. Last year we flew off the ice on May 7, this year May 5 same conditions. I haven't been by Gullrock this spring. Of course the river by Poplar Point is open. No suckers spawning yet on the creek by there"
2770953,Enid Elizabeth,2014-05-08 06:26:00,59,Rain last night. Ice looking black
2772465,tjandy,2014-05-08 11:18:00,107,Nice pics
2779705,Enid Elizabeth,2014-05-10 15:05:00,59,"Just came back from a flight out to the west end of Red Lake. narrows on Red are open. Pipestone Narrows by Bow Narrows Camp is open, Optic Lake opening up, ice pulling away from the shore on Douglas Lake, Viking Island."
