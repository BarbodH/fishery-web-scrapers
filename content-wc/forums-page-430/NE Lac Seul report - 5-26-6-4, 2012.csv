1446179,IMWalleye,2012-06-07 12:13:00,35,"Our group of six (WA, TX, OH) just completed our annual nine day trip to Lac Seul Outposts in Chamberlain Narrows. Great time there as usual - can't beat it in my mind. We fished from May 26 through June 4. Rain/snow first three days, then 6 days of sun and perfect winds. Throughout the trip, the fish were scattered - had to be at the right place at the right time. Depths were 10 - 20 ft, best action near current. Fished as far north as Birch Narrows and Wapesi, and as far south as Bear Narrows area. Scaler Lake was it's usual sweet self - nothing scattered there, just constant action. Averaged approx 60/two man boat/day mix of mostly walleye and a few northern. Jigs (all colors) and minnows by far outfished the crankbaits. Largest walleye 27 1/4"" & largest northern was a 42"" pig. Only 1 average smallmouth. Lots of wildlife sitings on the road and on the water...multiple bear, moose, fox, eagle. In summary, another great trip with the best group I can imagine at a great facility. As one of our TX guys put it, ""It's so great to be out here - the fishing is just a bonus!"""

1446213,IMWalleye,2012-06-07 13:25:00,35,"Yes, by the rapids in 8-10 feet. Right in the strong current. Good luck next week."
