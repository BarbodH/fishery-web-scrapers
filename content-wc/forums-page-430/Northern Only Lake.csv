On the heels of leaving in several days I am questioning our decision, wondering what northerns eat in the absence of walleye and how large can they grow. Anyone have experience with a lake where northerns outnumber walleye so heavily."

1445177,pegasis0066,2012-06-05 12:07:00,64,"Yeah, I was thinking other northerns too, but wondered between that and other bait fish, would this make up for very little walleye population."

This flyin chain of four lakes had basically no walleye, but loads of pike. We did catch and see several small perch - pike candy. Perch and firetiger colors were killers all week. We sat off one windy point during the afternoon and wore out the mid size pike (24-30"") on everything we could throw at them! Beautiful chain of lakes and great for Pike!"
1445266,RapShad,2012-06-05 15:04:00,76,"The 9:1 ratio would concern me a little bit too. I'm sure there are a lot of Pike in the lake but the quality would be the issue. Like what was mentioned Pike do not hesitate to cannibalize. The lakes in which I fish a major source for pike is walleye. There's a reason why you always hear guys on this site telling us that they catch their biggest pike while bottom bouncing or trolling schools of walleye. One thing our group likes to do if we find a big school of small or midsize walleye we cast or troll around the school with bigger crankbaits or spinners, it can turn up some very interesting results sometimes a big walleye but usually larger pike will follow these schools."
1445281,adempsey,2012-06-05 15:39:00,963,"I'd think you'd want a high energy forage base of alewife, cisco, smelt and whitefish etc... Walleye more than likely compete as top predators, not act as a primary food source."
1446688,Bigfishhunter,2012-06-08 13:32:00,803,"the best pike lake that I fish for both size and numbers, is pretty much a pike only lake. It has walleye in it, but it is not a catchable population. The amount of pike is way too high, for their to be any large amount of walleyes, it is absurd how many pike are in this lake. The quality of pike is also not compromised. I can end up with a 40""+ fish on most trips. Believe it or not this lake is a drive in lake, very easily accessed, and rivals some of the best fy in lakes I have ever guided on."
