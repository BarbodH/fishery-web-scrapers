1445066,Larbo,2012-06-05 08:46:00,231,"I am taking my nephew with me this year to Canada and US Department of State- Travel.State.Gov web page mentions that. Children: Beginning June 1, 2009, U.S. and Canadian citizen children under age 16 arriving by land or sea from contiguous territory may also present an original or copy of his or her birth certificate, a Consular Report of Birth Abroad, a Naturalization Certificate, or a Canadian Citizenship Card.I am also bringing a letter from mom and dad with the birth certificate. My question is.Do I need anthing else?Has anybody had any problems with this?I dont want to drive 10 hours with my group and then get turned away at the border. Thanks, Larry"

1445093,Gary from Iowa,2012-06-05 09:33:00,74,"In the past I've drawn the letter up mentioning the dates of travel, origin point of trip and destination, giving permission for the child or children to travel to and from the destination with the person in charge and included address of both parent(s) or guardian(s) and stated that the person in charge was allowed to seek medical, dental or vision care for the child if needed. I also typed in the parent(s),guardian(s) and work and home home phone numbers so the authorities could check it out.Don't be surprised if the child is taken aside and questioned out of your presence. They are trying to avoid children being kidnapped or taken by one spouse over the border when the other spouse does not consent.I haven't read the rules recently or had the occasion to draw up such a letter recently. I'm sure you can find more by doing a search on this message board.Gary"
1445099,RapShad,2012-06-05 09:38:00,76,"Gary that is great stuff! The only thing I would add is to get the letter notarized and signed by the parents, you and child. Also I would suggest if the child is above 8 or 9 to take them into the DMV to get an ID Card or passport (I'm not sure at what age kids need passports)."
1445103,Gary from Iowa,2012-06-05 09:49:00,74,"RapshadI agree on notarizing. I don't know if that is required but notarization makes the document appear more ""official"". I agree about photo ID. The nephew might have a photo school id or a learner's permit for driving. Provide the information that you would want if you were determining whether the child should be traveling across the border.Gary"

They let us through, but was told that the letter was a really good idea because some officials might not let us through without it. They said that it didn't need to be notarized. One person's opinion though. They did speak directly to my son about the trip and if his mom knew where he was."
