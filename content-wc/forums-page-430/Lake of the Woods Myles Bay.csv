However, yesterday was an unbelievable day of fishing. Lots of 20+ walleyes, and tons of 16-18"" take homes were caught. I personally found the walleyes on boulder shorelines in 8-10' of water. Other guides are finding them between 10 and 15 feet deep. Earlier in the week, they were much deeper... in the range of 20-25. The saving grace of the slow walleyes early in the week was that the crappie were biting. We caught lots of them on sunken trees in the area. They have moved into the dock, and we're catching a ton of them. Northerns are going crazy up in Obabikon Lake. I was telling some of our guests that Obabikon makes a guides job easy. You'll need to find some of the deeper weed beds in order to find the bigger fish. But, there's a bunch of action to be had. Smallmouth are on the shore lines, and the evening bite is great! Crankbaits thrown next to boulder rocks will produce lots of fish. Muskies, while they're not open yet, have been active. They should be moving for opener next Saturday!"
