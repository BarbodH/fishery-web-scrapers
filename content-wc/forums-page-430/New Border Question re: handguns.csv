1447203,2746,2012-06-10 09:16:00,3206,"Crossing into Canada from Niagra Falls. Official ask if I owned a hand gun. I said yes. Do you have it with you? I said no. He then asked ""how do you intend to protect yourself""? I said I didn't think I would need to. He said, ""have a good day"". I think they learn to ask a variety of questions, in different ways to determine if they are getting truthfull replies."
1447208,Campcountry,2012-06-10 09:30:00,164,It works the other way around too - at least it used to. Years ago I got turned back at the border trying to enter the US from Canada because I was trying to bring my target pellet pistol into the US. (I am Canadian). My cousin was with me (he is American) and he has the same pistol. He was able to bring his pistol into Canada without a problem and was able to bring it back over the border into the US without a problem. They just didn't want me as a non-American to enter the US with the pistol. Keep in mind that this was only a pellet gun too.
1447271,bigdaddyguns,2012-06-10 11:56:00,608,My kids were wondering if they could take their airsoft guns to Canada. I found that some airsoft models are classified as firearms by the Canadian government http://cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/...2-005-eng.html which could make for a more difficult than need be border crossing. Passing along as an FYI to anyone in that may be in this situation.

1447340,stillangling,2012-06-10 15:20:00,149,"Surprisingly it is more difficult for me to get into the USA with a gun than it is for you to come into Canada with one. I need to apply to the ATF for a permit 8-10 weeks in advance of crossing. In order to do that I need to demonstrate the purpose of my trip with a hunting licence, in hand, at the time of application. The draw system in many states makes it difficult to get the tag (licence) well enough in advance of the season start for the application process to work. You can simply bring a gun across the border and purchase a tag across the counter."
1445725,BuckeyeATC,2012-06-06 13:28:00,88,The old man got a new question when crossing the border into Canada this past month. They asked if he owned any handguns in the States. And after he answered yes they obviously asked if he was brining any into the country. My question to you is what relevency does this have to being allowed into the country and could you refuse to answer and be let in?
1445729,LOW1,2012-06-06 13:47:00,2828,"Of course you could refuse to answer it. I suspect that if you did you would then immediately be escorted to the holding area and given the ""Full Monty"" inspection.There is no requirement that the questions asked be relevant or even logical from the perspective of the visitor."
1445730,NathanH,2012-06-06 13:51:00,697,I would guess if you answered no there would not be the follow up question. At the end of the day they can ask you whatever they like and can deny access to their country on a whim I would guess. I mean we have no rights entitling us access to their country. We were asked the same questions when we crossed over. No hassle when compared to security checks I have been through when traveling outside the country. In fact I'm convinced that a Security guard in Holland has a model of my testicals after the search and rub down I once received.
1445736,Golden Eagle,2012-06-06 14:03:00,2642,"May 18, two of my party were crossing into Ontario at the International Falls border. Each was asked if he owned any handguns. Driver said, no. Passenger replied, yes. Guard asked if passenger had any guns with him. Answered, no. Guard told them to have a good trip and waved them through. Not a problem."
1445743,Whopper,2012-06-06 14:14:00,340,"LOL you beat me to it If there is one thing I have learned since crossing the border, answer their questions and be honest. You might be surprised what they know."
1446928,Manitou,2012-06-09 09:23:00,125,"DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BRING HANDGUNS INTO CANADA.If you get caught trying to cross into Canada, or are caught here with handguns you are in for a rough ride. We have no CCW here at all, handguns under 4"" barrel length as well as .32 caliber are absolutely prohibited.All other handguns are classified as restricted and require an Authorization to Transport (ATT) that allows you to take the gun from your home to a range. There is no ""wilderness carry"" whatsoever, unless you have a trappers licence. The only way to get a handgun into Canada is to receive a letter from a range that is inviting you to participate in a shooting event.There is no handgun hunting. I can't even plink on my own private property with a .22.Rifles and shotguns are different, as are antiques.You can bring an antique pistol. Go figure."
1446950,Golden Eagle,2012-06-09 10:33:00,2642,"Phil, I hope you receive a couple of nice handguns as a Father's Day present. One of these days you'll be too old to fight with your hands."
1446977,grizzley,2012-06-09 13:06:00,2518,"was told about this years ago. assume It's true.A local guy was hunting in Maine. crossed the border into Canada at Jackman ME., and came back into Maine at another checkpoint to hunt the Allagash.They noticed some pistol cartridges in the vehicle and asked him if he had a pistol. He replied that he did, and that he always has it with him, and never gave it a thought to take it out.they had to contact the American Embassy to get him out of jail."
1446980,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-09 13:24:00,235,About 15 years ago we were on a fly in and it was the day to leave. We watched the new group get situated while we waited for a second plane (we had a large group). Two old timers were immediately getting their boat ready to go fishing - first thing they put into their boat was large bottle of whiskey and then a hand gun (in a case). Thought that was odd.
1447067,Further North,2012-06-09 20:48:00,2008,"Canada is a lovely country...but like many others, their attitude towards guns is puzzling...."
