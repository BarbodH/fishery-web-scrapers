1446191,johnboat,2012-06-07 12:40:00,2014,"Up last week of May. Fishing was good as usuall. Went to the marked spots on map. As well as our secret ones. The one thing I found was fish were everywhere, but not bunched up. Was better to move slow instead of spot lock. Size was good, numbers just a pinch lower, but just a little pinch. Size for numbers any day for me. Weather was cold the first few days, with a touch of sleet and hail, then weather was sunny and calm. Should settle the fish down and herd them to the usuall spots. 99% jig and a minnow. Liight bite, but picked up as the week went on. KEEP ON THE BOTTOM!! As always, booked again for next year at Five Lakes Lodge, group of 10. Ian and Drew are working hard to make some nice additions to an already SUPER lodge. Have fun. JohnB.O.A.T."
1446294,jkwildhunting,2012-06-07 16:22:00,361,"Glad to hear you had a good time.Yes, Drew and Ian are make that camp even better which was a good camp to start with! I keep in touch with them weekly and am anxious to get up there next march to try my luck at some ice fishing!Hope they are on a spinner bite when we get up there. That is my favorite type of fishing and last year it was strictly jigging which is not bad just like covering ground alot faster!"
1389596,jeffreydsmith,2012-02-03 23:23:00,3,"Thanks for the reply. Wright's doesn't have a lot of info on their web site, no rates or cabin pics, so they weren't at the top of my list. Based on your recommendation though, I'll give them a call."
1390062,Pezman38,2012-02-05 09:26:00,3196,"You'll be glad you did! Lee is a great fisherman, and he will help you find fish if it is your first trip. He has also been known to join you if you want a demo."
1390245,jkwildhunting,2012-02-05 17:14:00,361,"We have been going to Gull Rock for 4 year I think now. All 4 years we have stayed at 5 Lakes Lodge!!!Last year it switched over to Drew and Ian Cooke!They have been VERY VERY VERY helpful in getting people on fish and they are doing a very good job on running the camp.They are upgrading boats this season I believe and are trying to make the camp better (cabin upgrades, adding hunting trips, ice fishing...ect)http://www.fivelakeslodge.com/If you want more info on 5 lakes feel free to PM me and I can help you out we have became very good friends with Drew and Ian over the last year and you will not be disappointed in your stay!!!!"
1391881,jeffreydsmith,2012-02-09 12:29:00,3,"Just a follow-up. We ended up booking at Wright's for the week of July 14-21. Thanks for the recomedations. I found nothing but good opinions of all the camps on Gull Rock, which seems like it should make the decision on where to go easier, but actually it was harder. We'll stop by the other camps while we're there to check them out in person to gauge alternatives, but I have no doubt Wright's will be a great experience. Jeff"
1400816,H Burns,2012-02-29 12:03:00,7,Will be at South Bay on Gull Rock over memorial day. Year 15 or 16. Anyone who has been there when I was there will likely remember seeing these guys....http://i36.photobucket.com/albums/e2...skies0036B.jpg
1401364,2746,2012-03-01 13:27:00,3206,"Beautiful Dogs! BTW, we've caught a ton of fish off that point in the background. We stay at 5 lakes and often check out this point going out in the morning and again coming in at night."
1402199,H Burns,2012-03-03 08:42:00,7,"Larry M - I see you are from DSM. Me - Hillis, Franklin, Hoover, Drake."
1402231,2746,2012-03-03 10:10:00,3206,"Actually from Clive. We've been going to Gullrock for 10 or 11 years, sometimes twice each year. This year just once in July due to some grandkids graduating. Lots of Iowa folks up there! Retired now but have been in Des Moines area since early 90's. Welcome to Walley Central. You'll enjoy it here."
1438668,tight_line,2012-05-21 22:26:00,6,Well Hello WallerChief- can't wait for the trip! Anyone know if the early ice out and warmer spring has influenced the depth/presentation/etc the walleye are looking for?
1445196,Blue Fin,2012-06-05 12:37:00,47,Any updates? Leaving Friday morning.
1378208,tackleman,2012-01-02 05:42:00,444,"In regards to smallies in gullrock, they are not present, HOWEVER, there is a population of rock bass that are a fair size, I get a few every year on the windy rock points.as far as the new owners at 5 lakes lodge, they are a young couplle with a couple small kids. Ian is a great fisherman and will keep you informed as to where the fish are if you ask him and his wife Drew will make your stay at camp enjoyable. The kids will keep you smiling. All in all, you won't be disappointed with them as owners."
1380321,GWC,2012-01-08 07:08:00,1021,"Yea, heard this before. Gotta admit smallies are a rare fish caught on Gullrock but I managed to catch one on my first trip there. It was verified by the Resort owner. Haven't seen or caught one since."
1384165,WallerChief,2012-01-20 19:51:00,83,Poplar Point it is. June 9-16th. Can't wait!
1384288,GWC,2012-01-21 10:15:00,1021,I guess we'll see you there. We have a reservation for the same week. We'll be in cabin 9. Look us up. We've been going to Poplar Point for several years now. It's always been great. I think you'll enjoy your trip.Jerry
1384348,WallerChief,2012-01-21 15:04:00,83,I'll look you up Jerry - not sure what cabin # ours is. He said its an 8 person cabin close to the water with a screened in front porch. Looks like we'll have 7 guys this year.
1385617,WallerChief,2012-01-24 17:35:00,83,"I stand corrected, looks like it's the week of June 2nd - 9th."
1385726,GWC,2012-01-25 05:58:00,1021,Sorry we'll miss you. Be sure to leave some walleye for us. Have a great week & enjoy the fishing. It's usually very very good in early to late June. The fish are usually in 8 to 15 feet of water. Don't forget to troll the bay in front of camp & the bug river.
1386043,SoulFulCry,2012-01-25 18:37:00,158,id love to come meet any of u guys n gals that come to red lake (gullrock) i live up on the north east end of the lake and make many trips to gull 2 island etc i hope ya all have a great fishing vacation +
1389325,jeffreydsmith,2012-02-03 11:49:00,3,"Any suggestions on which Gull Rock resort appeals most to the women in the group? I've looked at the web sites of all the resorts and they all look like they do a fine job and would be great for the serious fisherman (me). The wife comes along to relax and spend time with me (go figure?). She may not even go out for one or two of the days, prefering to relax at the cabin, reading, naping, etc. The primary thing that would appeal to her would be comfortable furnishings (not meaning fancy), clean, maybe a screen porch. It will be just the two of us. We've been to Red Lake twice, staying at Sunset Resort which we found to be great, and have explored central and westwern Red Lake quite a bit. I'm interested in fishing the eastern end of the chain this year. That's the only reason we're looking for something other than Sunset."
1389349,Pezman38,2012-02-03 12:37:00,3196,"We stay at http://www.wrightswildernesscamp.com/. Lee and Steph do a great job hosting us each year. Their kids are adorable and are half the fun. Every year there are more and more women in the camp. I think most of this is do to the excellent cabins they have. I think you and your wife would love it. They do have internet access available too. I know some fisherman won't like this and that is fine don't use it, but I like to keep in touch with my family as they don't come with. I have heard great things from other camps, but we have gone here for 8 years and it isn't broke by any means, so we aren't changing."
1373925,WallerChief,2011-12-16 17:22:00,83,"Considering Gullrock for the first time this year. Would love to hear some recommendations on camps, fishing pointers, success stories, etc. Thanks in advance!"
1374095,luv2fishcanada,2011-12-17 12:45:00,41,I have fished Gullrock since 1981. Ontario has done a great job since then managing their resources. Gullrock provides both quality fish and quantity. Our group has always gone in early June. We have always gone to what is now called Golden Hook Camp. The owners have been there 15+ years and run a good clean camp. They have both modern and semi modern cabins that are maintained quite well. The road is in good shape now getting to Gullrock and the road into Golden Hook is a couple blocks of the blacktop. Hope this helps
1374247,GWC,2011-12-18 05:17:00,1021,"I've have been going to Gullrock for several years & I like Poplar Point Resort. Good equipment, excellent service & great host. We've always had good luck fishing the lake & have taken some nice fish."
1374420,tackleman,2011-12-18 16:27:00,444,"any of the resorts on gullrock are good, the owners are very easy going and will do anything to make your stay a great one.you have a choice of Golden Hook camp, Procyks Anglers (something), poplar point, 5 lakes lodge, south bay on gullrock, and wrights wilderness camp.i'm sure if you google any of these you'll get all the information you want.as far as fishing, lots of walleye, lots of pike, some perch, some whitefish, the odd lake trout is caught every year (they come down the river from Red Lake and it is strictly a Catch and Release item). if you can't catch a fish on gullrock, you can't catch a fish anywhere.you won't regret the gullrock experience."
1374633,Fishin Fun,2011-12-19 12:20:00,218,"I've been fishing Gullrock for god knows how many years. I absolutely love it. It's not too big, but definately big enough to catch really nice fish. I've been staying at Southbay for many years and like it, but I've heard many good things about the other resorts on the lake too. So I don't think you can go wrong with any of them. You won't regret fishing Gullrock. I know I havn't. Matter of fact, I don't really fish anywhere else!"
1374634,johnboat,2011-12-19 12:26:00,2014,"Group of 10 of us for 10+ years running. Won't consider anywhere else. Fishing has always been good and have never had any complaints about the facilities or owners. Check through the archives, plenty of info there. Have fun! JohnB.O.A.T."
1374754,WallerChief,2011-12-19 19:31:00,83,Are there any smallies in Gullrock?Thanks for the replies!
1374757,walleyeduran,2011-12-19 19:40:00,286,"Hopefully not, I have fished it for 12 years and never have caught a small mouth. The resort oweners and the fisheries do not want small mouth bass in this water system. They want to keep the walleye reproduction/survival as good as they can. Duran"
1374761,jkonop,2011-12-19 20:05:00,544,"If you have trouble booking on Gull Rock, Red Lake has a few resorts minutes from the marina and it is a nice ride to Gull Rock down the river. You may not even want to leave Red Lake!"
1378099,BigBadBucky,2012-01-01 17:56:00,3,"Gullrock chain is great. We could always get on fish regardless of the weather. Just would have to sometime vary depth, locations or direction of fishing. We are pretty much vertical jig fishermen. Unfortunately haven't made it up last couple years. We liked 5 Lakes Lodge and would get the upgrade boats. 18' with 40hp 4-stroke, pedestal seats and depth finder. I know they've changed owners recently.My dad also liked it as if we had a day when he needed a break, we could come in a bit early in the evening and it was conveniently located to run into town and get an ice cream."
