We seem to usually hit the post spawn smallies and action is tougher for larger fish. We launch out of Clearwater and stay in the Ptarmigan Bay area for a week. If anyone has any reports on what's going on and what the water temp is I would appreciate it! Also, any advice for fishing this time of year would be great as well. How's weed growth been and are the walleyes moving to structure yet?"
1446602,Aaron-IN,2012-06-08 09:59:00,500,"I don't have a current report for you but you will be fishing post spawn for sure. My guess is it will be more like fishing late June early July conditions. When I'm fishing post spawn and having trouble getting on bigger fish I always go deeper with tube jigs, problem solved."
1446925,Manitou,2012-06-09 09:13:00,125,"I'm up a the north end of the lake, and yesterday I watched two smallies chasing each other off rockpiles right up on the shoreline.I think they're not yet spawning, I caught a big fat one, think it was a female.The weeds are just starting to come up and the water is really clear."
1446959,SimilarIsland,2012-06-09 11:16:00,121,We saw several females on the nest all over the Lower and Upper Manitou last week.
