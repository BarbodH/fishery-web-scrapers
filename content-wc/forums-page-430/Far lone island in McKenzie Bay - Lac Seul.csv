1439240,LoDo,2012-05-22 21:15:00,721,"Have any of you made the long boat ride to the small island in the far corner of McKenzie Bay - Lac Seul? I haven't fished McKenzie in a few years, but always had great luck, especially in the spring. The boat ride can be extremely long no matter if you are staying in Ear Falls or south of there along the 105. The boat ride can be extremely rough if the winds are high. Any who... the southwest side of the island in 12-15ft was always great! LoDo"
1446293,WalleyeWally28,2012-06-07 16:17:00,298,Checked my map and think I know which island you are talking about. Wife and I have fished most of McKenzie over the years but not quite that far into the corner. We will be heading to Lac Seul in two weeks and like to explore so we will make a point of checking that area out. Thanks for the tip.
1446379,Riceburner,2012-06-07 20:08:00,436,"I'm curious which far corner island you are referring to.....?? Close to Ghost Narrows, Poplar Narrows, Deer Island, ???"
1446476,WalleyeWally28,2012-06-08 06:04:00,298,"In a post from about two years ago, referring to the McKenzie outpost cabin, LoDo mentioned this island as being in the far NE corner of the bay. I assume he is referring to the area NE of Deer Island. On the map there is a shallow bay with an island sitting near the end of it. While fishing the backside of Deer Island my wife and I have seen boats heading in that direction and wondered where they were going."
1446610,KTroller,2012-06-08 10:31:00,237,"Be careful, off the SW side of the island 150-200 yds is a big submerged rock that I watched a guy hit at about 30 mph last year. Punched a nice hole in his LU and dented his hull.KT"
1446673,WalleyeWally28,2012-06-08 12:52:00,298,"Thanks for the warning. Just to be sure we are on the same page, are we talking about the island in the shallow bay that Ruber Creek runs into?"
1446683,Guest,2012-06-08 13:20:00,0,"I got the rock last year and lost my skag. The fishing can be awsume up there. It is a long way from Ear Falls, but well worth the boat ride. Pick a nice day as the water does get rough coming out and you won't feel it back there fishing. You just have to take your time when it is that rough. Tight Lines. See you there next week."
1446705,WalleyeWally28,2012-06-08 14:02:00,298,"You're right about McKenzie and Steamboat getting rough - they can be down right nasty. This is our 20th trip to LS in the past 16 years and we normally fish McKenzie and points south into the main basin. We've had some long trips back due to high winds, but the fishing is worth it. We will be there from the 23rd thru the 29th. Is that the week you will be there?"
1446818,KTroller,2012-06-08 21:14:00,237,"WW28, just to be clear the island I am talking about is at 50 34.459N 92 430.830 W. it is not way up by Ruber Creek but is the main island in the bay as you appoach the smaller openings nearer Ruber. PM me and I'd be happy to swap some specific spots in that bay and around the island for some of your spots in Ghost Narrows and south as we've never ventured that direction. I'll be up there out of Ear Falls starting on the 16th. Will likely be down to McKenzie a couple times that week depending on the bite NW and the wind.KT"
