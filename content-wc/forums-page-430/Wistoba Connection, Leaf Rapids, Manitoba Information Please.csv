A friend of mine has a weeks worth of accommodations coming from a bid at a fund raiser. He will be travelling from the Minneapolis area. Is it reasonable to drive? Are the roads paved,etc.?http://home.centurytel.net/wistoba/Home.html Thanks, JDP."

From Thompson to Lynn Lake (via Leaf Rapids) it is a gravel road that is not well maintained. Lots of curves, washboard, sharp protruding rocks, mud etc. Not a lot of traffic on the road. There are no road side rest stops. I've seen this place advertised on v r b o . c o m. Beautiful country up there, fishing is great. The town history of Leaf Rapids is quite interesting. Bring a spare tire or two if you are driving. I would not tow boat past Thompson. I used to live in Lynn Lake and Thompson."
