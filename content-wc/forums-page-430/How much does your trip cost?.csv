1442056,Guest,2012-05-29 11:26:00,0,"wow. i feel much better about my trip now after seeing some of these numbers. i do a 7 day 6 night canoe/camping trip in quetico park. in the end its around $250 a person. liscence is $40, $17 per night x 6 nights=$102 for park fees, we bring our own canoes/no live bait and weve been camping/canoeing long before our canada adventures started so we have all the gear already. so it comes down to 4 guys splitting gas in 1 suv 4 ways for an 800 mile trip. gas runs between $40 and $50 a person. then we all chip in a little for fryer oil, propane, some fish breading so around another $10 a person. total, erring on the high side, is around $210. i carry $250 in cash just in case. we pay for the liscences online and have them printed off ahead of time."
1443454,JVB1,2012-06-01 07:06:00,12,"Our trips from Ohio to just about any outfitter in Quebec or Ontario range from $1200 to $1600 on an average for a 7 day trip.Outfitter $ 3400 (850pp)Truck Gas $ 900 (two trucks) one from Michigan one from OhioLicense $ 180 (45pp)Food $ 700 (100pp per day)We do not include the cost for all the new tackle, gear, sunscreen, bug spray ect. We don't normally use any bait, large Doctor Spoons are my favorite pike lure. If we happen to smash a prop on the rocks that should not be where they always are the cost goes up. Extra weight for the second float plane trip (we never seem to make it on 110 pounds per man) adds cost. You simply cannot justify a trip like this down the cost, for me spending a week in Gods country with my brothers is worth every penny I have."

All for a nominal fee of $1550 Canadian each. Thats from the time we leave home until our return The good thing is as of today it only 3 weeks away"
1447167,bpetersen,2012-06-10 07:44:00,251,Just returned. 6 people 2 private boats round trip 2400 miles housekeeping If no one chooses to drink alcohol. $585 for everything.
1440207,NEpiker,2012-05-24 15:54:00,9,We budget $1500 per person driving from Omaha and staying 6 nights under the modified American plan (we bring our own boat). We stay one night on the road each way in addition to the 6 nights in the lodge.
1440216,lcwhit,2012-05-24 16:30:00,104,"4 guys average about $1100 each. 1000 mile trip, one night motel, northwest end lac seul with camp boats upgraded. includes lodging, boats, bait, gas, food, licenses, beer and incidentals. really a pretty cheap vacation in my opinion. son lives in san diego and daughter near baltimore. now there you can spend some serious change for a week stay. and neither place has walleye."
1440222,"6'3""",2012-05-24 16:43:00,47,"My whole week costs under 400 bucks. Half the gas in my truck,100 bucks cabin,50 license,50-60 food,a little misc.,and a tip. Close to 400 bucks"
1440373,jimmie,2012-05-24 23:32:00,123,"I do take my trips on the cheap but I don't mond. The biggest expense is the gas to and from and for the boat. It will cost about $100 a day for me and if i take a buddy about $150 for two and about another $50-60 for each beyond that up to four folks. I now stay at a motel that has TV, microwave, small fridge and is nice and clean good shower ect. It also has a restaurant for breakfast and lunch if you like. That's about 800-850 miles total. Sandwiches for lunch and a meal or two out per week. Good luck in saving up. I don't use my vehicle at least 2-4 days per week to save on gas I use on needless trips to pay for my Canada trips. I'll be in Sioux lookout area from July 1st until . . . .????"
1440436,octanehi5,2012-05-25 07:04:00,1104,"We do a seven day fly in to northern Quebec Boats ,gas,cabin we bring all our food .beer tackel. Its a 12 hr ride to get to Clova QC. The total cost Is $1500-1600 PER PERSON thats everything"
1440447,doubleheader,2012-05-25 07:22:00,2652,"My wife and I share a nice large 5 bedroom 2 bathroom remodeled cottage with another couple. Our total cost is around $2300/family for 2 weeks. It's about a 450 miles each way. We go Housekeeping Plan, we make our own meals and eat 1 meal/week at the lodge. Again, this is a total cost/family."
1440500,3M TA3,2012-05-25 08:48:00,2846,"So that's $375 for boat gas total, right? Wow. Sounds like big water and long distance travel on your lake for sure. For me... 2 to 3 weeks out, 600 miles RT Truck gas $200 1 guy Camp on remote island $170 (MNR requirement) 1 guy Boat gas $125 Bait $0 Booze $0 Anyone that joins me, no charge except they gotta buy their own camp permit. Also they gotta bring enough ice for the trip with plenty of cold beverages. I budget around $20000 for each trip. (For new boat every other year.)"
1440542,camp chef,2012-05-25 09:53:00,915,My trip costs somewhere in the $1000 area for a week with our own boat and cooking gourmet food.It is hard to imagine any other type of therapy for close to that cost.
1440951,Ogoki,2012-05-26 11:07:00,291,"Fly-in last year cost my wife and I $4000 for the two of us and that included gas , 3 nights motel , license and all the food for the entire trip . The trip is 1150 each way . When we were younger we went straight thru and spent the night before flying in at the motel near the base . now we drive to Wawa and spend the night .Arrive at Armstrong late afternoon and spend that night there . Mattice Lake Outfitters like to start flying as soon as they can in the mornings so we usually get flown in and out early . Coming out it usually works out where we stay at Wawa or the Soo. Gas and motel hit around $800 to $900 for the trip. The fly-in costs around $1400 each BUT we stay 8 or 9 days too . Not 4 days of fishing . I know a group that fly-in from near the border and go in for 4 days . We tried that ONCE and had heavy rain the fist two days and then two days of good weather . Found fish the late evening of the third day so we basically had a good one day fishing trip . To each there own . After 35 fly-in trips I am as excited as ever to get back UP NORTH . Between a bear hunt/ fishing trip with my wife and a fly-in ,I will be in Ontario 22 days in August .Plus the trip in June . I have worked all my life to be at this point in life and By The Grace of God I am there ."
1441089,DanL,2012-05-26 21:16:00,262,Our group is at about $750.00 per person. This includes everything except for the food. We all bring our own boats and prepare our own food. It is money well spent.
1439147,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-22 18:44:00,235,"$1275 per person - housekeeping cabin, fly-in outpost. Includes four full days fishing, flights, food (though we bring additional snacks and booze), boats/motors/unlimited gas, fishing license, taxes and a one night stay at base camp prior to flying out. It's usually another couple hundred bucks per person when you factor in bait, gas, meals on the way (750 mile drive), souvenirs, etc."
1439172,Terwalleye,2012-05-22 19:29:00,166,"I'll leave out the food and drink and gas money. We stay at a resort and rent camp boats. 4 year old cabin with 3 bdrms. 17 ft Lund Outfitters boats with a 40 hP and tolling motor nice seats, live well etc. Gas for boat, ice and bait included. $689 plus tax per guy. And the best part is we are heading up 3 weeks from Friday!"
1439230,pan-man,2012-05-22 20:47:00,299,We bring own boat and camper. Drive 525 miles each way. Everything (except depreciation/wear on everything) costs $450 per person for 7 days of great fishing. I try to do 3 of these trips a year!!!
1439332,GWC,2012-05-23 06:58:00,1021,We do about 1200 miles pulling a Lund 16 footer with a Jeep JK. We do 2 nights on the road going & 1 coming back. It usually runs about $1200 for each of us. This trip is a week on the lake fishing for two people. Beer is extra. One or maybe two trips each year (June & September). This year it'll probably just be the June trip. I have a lot of good water locally & will be getting a lot of fishing in over the summer & into late fall.
1439376,Babamel2,2012-05-23 07:41:00,414,"we drive about 900 mi one way, spend night on the way up and back. Drive to the camp, bring our own boats, cabin is housekeeping and we do our own cooking. Travel, lodging, fuel, groceries & camp expenses. I would say its about $600 - 700 per person. Thats the cost, value -- Priceless. The only down side, is my wife caught the biggest fish. and it seems that as she talks about the trips, she is still catching that thing over and over. Its still worth it taking her along."
1439406,Dodger31,2012-05-23 08:13:00,18,450 miles to resort. 8-10 guys each year in group. Cost comes in around $700-800 each guy after everything. I agree with earlier posts. It is worth every penny for the laughs and relaxation. Oh yeah and catching a crapload of fish too!
1439456,Stehle1,2012-05-23 09:55:00,22,"We do a flyin housekeeping trip to Expeditions North (Nagagami Lake) each year.

1439885,Guest,2012-05-24 07:36:00,0,"Always a good question. I have records going back to our first trip up north in 1974; cost on the trip was 328.00. Last year's trip was 1163.00. We bring about half our food (steaks, H-burgers, chicken breast, bacon, and sausage) mostly meat, and buy the rest in Kenova. We have the camp owners bring the beer 15 cases, water 4 cases. Pop 2 cases. We pull 1 boat and rent 2 using an ext. van. We have 6 fishing 2 per-boats. The 1163.00 covered every cost from home to back home. (1120 miles each way) we drive straight thru. I hope this helps and have a great fishing trip."

1438981,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-05-22 13:03:00,138,"I know everybody does it different. Housekeeping vs American plan. Camp boat vs bring your own etc.. But how much do you spend on your trip(s).We drive 1000 miles each way. Bring our own boat. Stay a week in a housekeeping cabin.Per personTruck gas $200 3 guysCabin $250Boat Gas $125Bait $100Booze???I budget about $1000 for everything. New tackle, boat repair/maintenance etc.."
1438994,wallydave,2012-05-22 13:26:00,2151,"Where to start?? The long list might be too scary to put everything down, so lets keep it simple. First is the deposit, this year I put down $200, a little less to pay at the end of the week! We will split the gas and groceries; two in a 21 mpg suv, so 170 for gas another $40 each for groceries, now we are at $410. License $40. now $450. tackle lets call it another $150 each( New Bass Pro!! ) That rings up at $600. We will split a room in Fort Francis Friday night $70. Getting into the $670 range. Lets say $25 for the one case of beer plus another $40 for Canadian beer. $735 so far, plus $110 per person/day at Goose Bay(Cabin, boat upgrade, gas and minnows) $770, less deposit, means $570, not inculding the taxes. Add a few bucks for meals on the road, and leeches and crawlers, say $30. Looks like the $1335 neighborhood. The actual, on hand cash won't be that high, around $900 per person, most of these expenses are already taken care of before we leave. At the end of the day though, these trips up North can not be reduced to mere dollars, loons and twoons! The scenery, the fishing, the good times at camp are simply priceless!!"
1438999,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-05-22 13:35:00,138,I forgot about licenses. Thanks.
1439020,Fishin Fun,2012-05-22 13:55:00,218,"We bring our own boats and food. 5 or 6 guys usually. Stay in a 2 bedroom cabin. After all expenses including gas, food, bait, licenses, resort fees, etc, it generally costs us around $550 each for the week. Not bad for a weeks worth of fishing in Canada."
1439021,wallydave,2012-05-22 13:56:00,2151,My boat/cabin buddy have ours from the website one less thing to worry about on the way to camp. Taking care of stuff before means less out of pocket during the trip.
1439045,Lovetofish,2012-05-22 14:23:00,458,$700 a head covers me for 6 nights in camp and night in Sioux Lookout pulling one boat and renting another camp boat. I bring along a motor for the camp boat. It also includes tackle I've bought and the dog sitter fee when we get home. I don't count the food part. This is a family trip and we have to eat at home anyway. Plus we don't eat fancy up there and eat a lot of fish.
1439050,Bigstorm,2012-05-22 14:27:00,799,I'm guessing it is about $900/ea for our group. This includes everything with extra
1439076,elway12,2012-05-22 15:16:00,335,"Our trips to Canada cost pp max about $1750 total for a 5-7 day fishing trip. We (3 person group) split the cost of a rental van, food, gas, 1 night hotel stay. The fishing resort we stay at provides the usual: boats, gas, 2dzn minnows/pp day etc. The total pp cost of our trip also includes buying a sports license, some tackle bought specifcally each year for the trip, food bought in camp and for the journey north, tips. Our cost is probably alittle higher than most since we have airfare from AZ to contend with. We have to drive from Minneapolis to 90 miles north of Ignace(1200 miles RT)."
1439090,unclepaully,2012-05-22 15:52:00,112,This year we figure our trip will cost about $1000 per person. This includes the outfitter and all expenses there & back(Abamasagi).
1439102,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-22 16:32:00,298,My wife and I take our own boat and spend a night at a motel on the way up. It always seems to cost us right at $2000 ($1000 each) to cover everything.
