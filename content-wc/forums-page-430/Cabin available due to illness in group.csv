If anyone is looking for a great place to stay in Minaki, the North cottage is now available June 22nd for a week. This is not an advertisement, I just feel like crap that the owner is going to lose out on a week rental due to our group. I would like to do anything I can to fill it. I will even donate our DP to to reduce the cost to fill it. PM me for details. Here is the cabinhttp://www.sandlakeoutpost.com/"

Rob and Jan are great people, I've known them for over 30 years, going all the way back to when he used to own Sunset Point Resort. We occasionally stop by to see them and the 2 girls at their place in Jackfish Bay. Those cabins are centrally located in Big Sand Lake, not far from some excellent walleye hotspots, and of course the cove behind Dead Boys Island is a great smallmouth and pike area. The North Passage leading over to Little Sand and Rough Rock Lake is just around the corner. Sorry you won't be making it this year, we probably would have seen your group that week. We always try to get up in that bay a couple times during the 2-3 weeks I'm at Minaki. Disclaimer: This isn't an advertisement or a schill post to tag-team with the OP. Just trying to point out some of the nice characteristics about the huge cabin."

1444016,DonC,2012-06-02 19:00:00,93,"Reels, I know how you feel. I have not missed a year in a Canadian lodge for the past 24 years, till this year. Unable to get the other's interest up anymore with changes in the group's lives on various levels. I will at least get to fish out of friend's cabin on Oak Island, MN, June 9-14th in the Northwest Angle of Lake of the Woods fishing Canadian waters. I would have done these group trips for another 15-20 years but alas not to be. I like those cabins on Dead Boy's Island. Never knew they were rentals. Showed the wife the website pictures and said half joking to her, ""would you like to go for a month"". Hope you get up again soon, Don"

1447077,cruiseforever,2012-06-09 21:11:00,177,I know how you feel. Last year I had the fever and went to Canada alone. It was nice to get away but just not the same with a group to banter with. I think there should be a support group started to help us recover or find new friends to go north with.
