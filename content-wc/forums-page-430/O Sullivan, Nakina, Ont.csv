What kind of fish bite can we expect on O Sullivan in early August compared to a June bite? We will be fishing primarily for pike and walleye and perhaps lakers. Our June techniques included trolling and casting jigs, crawler/leech harnesses and cranks in 10 feet of water or less. What should our early August techniques on O Sullivan include? Thanks. Jeepman"

By this time, most walleye fishing is off of reefs and edges adjacent to deeper water, which are fairly common on this lake. Fish areas that the wind is blowing in to. This lake seems to really draw the fish where the food chain is being sent. The bite can change as quickly as the wind changes. You will do well, great lake! Bill Krejca"
