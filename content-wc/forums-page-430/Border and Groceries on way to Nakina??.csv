How long does it take to go from Pigeon Falls to Nakina? What are roads like? Where is the best place to buy groceries on way to Nakina? Thanks and good fishing this year!

It is hard to miss, is on left side just before ""Metro Geraldton"". It a good store, and they have about anything that we need to round out our groceries. Some items such as vegetables and eggs, and of course, bread, can get sort of squished on a long ride. We also pick up a quantity of ice, don't have to haul it as far, either. Take along one or two Canadian 1 dollar coins for the shopping carts, which have a locking coin release mechanism on them. (You get the buck back when the cart is placed back in the cart row.)

You can view the Geraldton store's weekly flyer and get some idea of the selection by going thru the website www.extrafoods.ca It's a pretty complete and modern grocery store."
