1446336,lassh,2012-06-07 18:36:00,553,I'm currently working in Omaha and will be meeting up with a group from Illinois/Indiana in July for a trip to Beteau. Does anyone know where I can safely park a vehicle for a week when our paths intersect at Duluth?
1446338,Golden Eagle,2012-06-07 18:43:00,2642,Maybe check long term parking rates at airport.
1446340,BrianinVA,2012-06-07 18:45:00,160,Long-term parking at Duluth Airport for $45 a week might be an option.
1446354,bigwalleye1,2012-06-07 19:22:00,2632,"Check with the Fon Du Luth Casino in downtown, they've got their own ramp right next to the casino. I don't know about a weekly rate, but it's been pretty cheap for an evening's gambling, and possibly offer a fee reduction with some gambling."
1446516,Larry S,2012-06-08 07:10:00,665,I parked my car at Duluth Airport in 2009. The damage was around $80 for 10 days. You can google the Duluth Airport and get the parking rates. The airport is patrolled and extremely safe
1446522,falkopat,2012-06-08 07:16:00,44,"due to last minute changes in plans, we had one guy in our group park at the major hotel in virginia. They only asked he parked in the back of the lot and that he gave them his contact info. Completely FREEfalkopat"
1446600,Gary from Iowa,2012-06-08 09:50:00,74,"I know that one option when flying to a destination from my small town is to drive to a motel with a shuttle to the airport. For the price of the room, you can leave the car in the lot and take the shuttle back to the motel and your car. If you could do something like that, you could shorten a long exhausting day and have your car at a safe place during the trip.Good luck on the car and fishing.Gary"
1446664,Mr Ranger,2012-06-08 12:24:00,272,Downtown Duluth there is a number of Public parking garages. I have left my truck there three different years without any problem. They just ask that you pay in advance in the office at the ramp. think it was like $35.00 for the week and then I could at least have a roof overhead should it storm. Have never had any problems. If interested I might still have the garage phone number. Good luck
1446739,drlee,2012-06-08 16:14:00,409,Most Walmarts will allow you to park in their lot if you go to the customer service desk and sign up. I have done this outside of LaCrosse on several occasions and have never had a problem leaving my vehicle for a week.
