1446227,Larry Mac,2012-06-07 13:50:00,530,"LOL!!!!!!!Thank you,Larry mac"
1446410,fishincrazy,2012-06-07 20:47:00,1282,NICE!!!!! FC
1445707,Lovetofish,2012-06-06 13:04:00,458,I'll second this from Cash. But I use a salted minnow.
1445735,NathanH,2012-06-06 14:03:00,697,"Great Question Tried a ton of jigs in Canada this year. Northland Gumball, Northland whistler, Northland Thumper, Hutch Glitter, Hutch Painted, Sirmanski Jigs, Capt Red Beards, VMC Dominator Metal head jigs(long shank 3/0) VMC mooneye, Vmc Hot skirt Jigs.)Most of these were good some were Great (VMC mooneye, Hutch, Sirmanski)But My run away favorite was the VMC Dominator Metal head jigs(long shank 3/0). Didnt snag nearly as much as the others, hooks stayed super sharp and didnt bend when hung up. Solid hookset everytime Least favorite by a long shot was Capt Red Beards didnt care for the hooks small gap felt like I had a harder time getting a solid hookset. I. Also I take good care of my stuff keep it dry at the end of the day. I have never seen a hook develop rust so fast in my life."
1445775,1shooter,2012-06-06 14:55:00,1493,I use 2 types of jigs. Northland FireBall and http://anglersguidehq.com/bucktail-jig/
1445778,Guest,2012-06-06 15:04:00,0,"any jig that i can hook a 4"" ringworm to. i mainly use the round ones in two tone patterns, but if i had to choose only one, probably a stand up type but they are harder to find."
1445823,Jiggin_Rob,2012-06-06 16:21:00,26,I second the captain red beard jigs... I use them with a thill cigar style slip bobber to catch suspended fish during the day...
1445879,Nimstug,2012-06-06 18:36:00,2605,Shake the finger over the jig box. The one that stays embedded in the skin gets tied on...
1445914,heritage2008,2012-06-06 19:42:00,92,Switched to glow yellow orange blended powder coated minnow shaped lead head the past few years and drag fewer weeds and have had better succes than others I have tried. I use red hooks too--seems to be the best for Quebec walleyes. I use 1/8th ounce for slow troll and up to 1/4 ounce if searching. Mostly fish 6-9' of water.
1445936,fishincrazy,2012-06-06 20:19:00,1282,This is great Keep em coming!!!!FC
1445955,Bigstorm,2012-06-06 21:02:00,799,"I prefer to use the standard round head jig that I mold/paint for my Canada trips instead of some the jigs I buy down here (Northland or Capt Redbeard) because of th ecost. Where I fish in Canada (English River), I go up there expecting to lose 100 jigs."
1445965,fishincrazy,2012-06-06 21:32:00,1282,I hear that if your not loosing jig's your not fishing right!Plus my 16 year old is going this year and I know he can get snagged on a top water!FC
1445351,fishincrazy,2012-06-05 19:37:00,1282,I was just thinking about what kind of new jig head do I want to try this year on my Canada trip???I normally use just plain ball head jigs for everything from crappies to striped bass.Recently I got a new pot and some different molds to try.I wanted to add a new wally jig to my bag.Any thoughts on what you prefer north of the border????FC
1445354,wallydave,2012-06-05 19:45:00,2151,"Last year I tried some walleye weapons from capon redbeard. They are similar to roadrunners, they have blade on the bottom. We were fishing in some current theses jigs out fished any other jig we tried. This year I am trying some Northland thumper jigs. Gold and pink were the hot floors last year. In eleven days we will see what's hot this year!!"
1445372,Bill Krejca,2012-06-05 20:08:00,6107,"I prefer jigs from my Do-It Walleye mold, with the collar. I have found it, for me, to be the less likely to snag in rocks. The collar can easily be cut off when I like to use just the head alone - like when using a plastic leech. The mold can be modified to move the eye to the center, allowing it to be vertically fished in a true horizontal position. When I use the leech, I cast in the very short bait hook, size 1 or 1/0, the only two hook sizes available. Bill Krejca"
1445382,SteveJ715,2012-06-05 20:24:00,59,"I use Northland's Whistler Jigs. These are somewhat similar to the Thumpers mentioned above, but the blade sits right underneath the jig head. Same main concept, though -- a little extra sound and flash. I will be casting one into some northern Ontario water in...four days!- Steve"
1445415,Nimstug,2012-06-05 21:33:00,2605,"Generally 1/4 to 3/8 oz plain ol' ball jig for vertical; 1/8 to 1/4 for pitching. Jig box has yellow, chartreuse, green, white, pink and probably a couple other colors. Whatever gets stuck in a finger when I reach in the box is what I tie on. This year I've added some Fuzz E Grubs and Whistler jigs just to see what happens. I'm also going to try some Beetle Spins. NimstugIs it September yet?"
1445417,fishincrazy,2012-06-05 21:44:00,1282,"Thanks for the replies guy's!!!WDave---I love road runners and have a few,I also have some of the northland whistler jig's which I have used in the past. Thanks I am looking into a mold for the road runners.Bill I was looking for a Wally jig mold but haven't found the right price yet.Steve,and Nim I have used whistler jig's in the past with some success,Nim Fuzzy grubs rock!!Thanks for the responses!!!FC"
1445423,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-05 22:18:00,235,Whatever gets ya to the bottom. It doesn't take much to trick those dumb Canadian walleye.
1445425,rnnonmt,2012-06-05 22:30:00,992,In the great Canadian northland it probably doesn't matter if we dropped a bowling ball with some fish scent on it and a plastic tale attached. All kidding aside it is way too easy to capitalize on the abundance of walleye available..... BUT... If I had to choose one Jig it would be pink 3/8 oz skirted with fire tiger color tipped with a small to medium sized live minnow. Why small to medium sized live minnow you may ask....because I am tired of feeding the short strikers!
1445654,adempsey,2012-06-06 10:51:00,963,"Lol, that's priceless. I think I might try this technique. What do you do if you get stabbed by more than one?Another type of jig you might try is an airplane jig. We mostly use those for ice fishing, but they should work fine vertical jigging. The Lindy Flyer is one type. Anyway, it's something different.However, my favorite is just a standard jig. I use all sorts, round head, flat bottom, knuckle ball.Have you tried shakey head fishing?"
1445701,Cash,2012-06-06 12:55:00,73,This ^. Any brightly colored jig head and more than likely a chartreuse twister tail. Tipped with a minnow of course.
