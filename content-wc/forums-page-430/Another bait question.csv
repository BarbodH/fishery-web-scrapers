He catches just as many fish as the rest of us and can use a leech for hours at a time and many fish before it is gone. Makes them like old show leather. Once they turn grey the show is over though.I need to contact the MNR if the ones in the Borax at the moment look usable. It seems to take a long time to get an answer back from them, but they do always answer.Pooch"
1447336,jiggster,2012-06-10 15:12:00,183,My brother in law brought live leaches into Canada and told the officer at the border. As long as they were in artifical bedding they were fine.
1447345,Pooch,2012-06-10 15:25:00,4619,I think the border guards were referring to night crawlers. Leeches have been banned for about ten years.Pooch
