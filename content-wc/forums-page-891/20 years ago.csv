My question now is, how far back do they consider this to be a problem!The guy going with me had a DWI over 20 years ago. Is this still going to be a problem? His record is clean since.Thanks for your help.dutchboy"
529139,Guest,2003-03-30 19:17:00,0,I don't think this will be a problem considering the time limit of over 20yrs and this goes both ways.The best thing I can suggest is that you don't lie to customs and everything should be fine.Check with Canada Customs here: http://www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca/customs/menu-e.htmlAnd get more detailed info on what to expect.Good Luck!
