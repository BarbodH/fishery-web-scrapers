I didn't exactly plan ahead this year (probably because our ""All Canada"" show was effectively snowed out). In the past we tried Eagle LAke but the temperature at the end of June was near 100 degrees and the fishing was poor. Two questions, and I thank you in advance for responses, as I am a novice Walleye hunter:1) How is fishing in general the 1st week in June - is there anything to be wary of (i.e. does a late ice out ruin things around that time, or are the fish spawning and inactive, etc?)2) The two lodges we have been looking at are Goose Bay Lodge and Canada North lodge - anyone have any experience with either? Canada North looks super nice but someone said you had to boat 1 1/2 hours to get to the fishing - I asked the owner who was very nice and said that they fish right around the lodge and have success. On the other hand I've heard great things about Lac Seul as well and Goose Bay Lodge is there. Is the fishing good at this time of year around these lodges or do you have to do portage or fly-ins to get the fish?Thanks very much for any advice."

We have had many successful trips during that time frame. The walleye have finished the spawn and are beginning to go into their summer cycles. We find them at the ends of high current in our river and lake system as well as on humps in open water. We routinely pull cranks and bottom bounce.Sorry, but I can't comment about the specific places you are inquiring about. I hope this helps."

I can also remember the mayfly hatch really messing up fishing one year. But...for the most part, June is good. In my experience, earlier in the month is the best for walleyes. Pike don't seem to care!I've never been to any of the places you mentioned but I'd say early June should be good. Good luck!Trout"

If your serious about going I would start to make some reservations asap. LS has many many areas to fish and lodges to stay in. People on this site could help you more but you need to figure out the lake you sant to fish and how much money you want to spend as this has a big bearing on the options you can choose from.If you want to discus this further email me at[email protected]"
529059,Guest,2003-03-30 12:20:00,0,"I stayed at Goose Bay last year during the second week of June and was very satisfied with the accomodations and the fishing. We had great fishing in the Wenasaga River(2 miles from camp), Sawmill Bay(4 miles), and McKenzie Bay (15 miles). The cabins are clean and the camp owner was nice. We are going back during the same week this year. If you are looking for something fancy this is probably not the place for you. Hope this helps."
