Also we couldn' find any at Fort Francis or other bait shops..First no minnows, then no leeches now no waxies. What's next? Crawlers? (I asked if Crawlers were still OK and she said yes, no dirt.)"

529075,happy,2003-03-28 20:48:00,34,Does the virus disappear when the Canadian bait dealers inport them?
529076,bigfish1965,2003-03-29 00:09:00,3210,Canadian imports are from certified sources only. We got zillions of leeches up here anyway...why do they need to import?
