I love fishing, I live in Hudson (outside of Sioux Lookout) and I propose this:I have had a few testy time with the folks from the States due to proximity fishing and such but I can live with that, no hard feelings here, I might blow my stack from time to time but hey this is where I live and where I play on my free time. I know where the walleye are year round so I guess I can expect people to follow me from time to time and when you get down deep, I can understand your position on following me.All that aside, Why not I take a few fellow fisherman out for a fishing cruze during the first/second week of July? You bring your boat and I can put you on the fish and we can all shoot the chit. I might not show you my best secret places on L.S. but I can guarentee you your going to catch and have a really good day.I always have a shore lunch when I fish, this is a givin when fishing walleye and I happen to have a HUGE fish frying pan that we can use to whip up a mess of tasty walleye.So thats my propasal, there is no charge, you bring your own bait,tackle, rods whatever and we fish.What do you say? Who is going to be on L.S. the second week of July?Oh..... If you can bring something I can't get here for the shore lunch and thats a few cans of Bush Beans With Onion..... Those beans are without a doubt the best for a shore lunch.Let me know.Local...AKA the ""Pirate Flag"""

I can almost taste that shore lunch now!!I would ask you to stipulate one more request to the lucky party that you guide for the day. That stipulation would be that the party reports back to Walleye Central with the results of the day!!!Again, my fishing hat is tipped to you sir.Just Rip Lips and Keep A Tight Line!By the Way, if there is a place I could send you a couple cans of beans...let me know!!!"
