528882,Mike KS,2003-03-23 09:20:00,18,Careful boys ...Grinder is going to be on Lac Seul in June...And he is one Walleye Fishing machine.
528883,Guest,2003-03-24 15:20:00,0,"huh? who is grinder? since I am going to be on that same trip, I would love to know. Is hop a long coming for sure too?"
528884,Mike KS,2003-03-26 07:57:00,18,Grinder and Hop a Long are one in the same....Doesent hardly seem fair having two Polocks fishing against just six guys. Going to be a helluva whipping....reminds me of Nebraska stomping the Vols.
528885,Guest,2003-03-26 13:07:00,0,Are both of those Polocks going to try to cross the border at the same time. Hope the border crossing Guard can talk slow enough.
528886,Mike KS,2003-03-27 14:21:00,18,"Yes, we both will cross the border at the same time...we have our green cards."
