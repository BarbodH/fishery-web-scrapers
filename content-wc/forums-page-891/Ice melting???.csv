528909,AL,2003-03-24 20:24:00,89,Going to Armstrong for the opener. Any guesses on ice out that far north. How much is still on the smaller fly in lakes? I read it was 47'F there today. Hopefully we don't have a repeat of last years ice out.
528910,redlaker,2003-03-25 06:52:00,0,In red lake we have 40 to 50in. of ice but it is getting warmer the snow is melting fast lots of slush on the lake if it stays warm she'll go fast.
528911,Guest,2003-03-25 07:59:00,0,Armstrong? Brrrrr! I generally stay more south than north for the opener...especially during a cool spring. It made all the difference last year....had a great outing while some buddies who decided to go north froze their nards off. Monitor the weather & forecasts...also ask anyone in the area for ice updates.
528912,AL,2003-03-25 16:15:00,89,"Tom,I went out of Armstrong last year for the opener as well. It was very cold at times with snow and ice, but as far as quality and quantity of fish we've never done better. By far the best year we've had. How did you do farther South for the opener?AL"
528913,Guest,2003-03-26 11:06:00,0,"AlWe slayed them. For only 2 guys fishing, we both managed each about 4 fish over 8 pounds with my biggest at 11 and my buddy got a 12 pounder. Sprinkle in some 6, 7, 8, 9 & 10 pounders for good measure and you get the idea. A few 2-3 pounders came for a visit as well and my buddy took one home for dinner...all the rest went back in the lake (gotta keep that gene pool alive).Suffice it to say, we are going to return to the same lake this spring!Of course, it sounds like you guys did really we too up Armstrong way. The weather is a crap shoot...so let's hope for the best! Tom"
