529154,Pete,2003-03-31 08:51:00,35,"Gentlemen:Myself and 5 others usually plan a walleye trip in Southeastern Ontario or vicinity. Historically, we have gone the week after opening day to Quinte but would like a change of scenery. Would anyone care to recommend a few lakes and lodges we should consider that might be within 2 - 2 1/2 hrs of the 1000 Island bridge? Thank you for your help."
