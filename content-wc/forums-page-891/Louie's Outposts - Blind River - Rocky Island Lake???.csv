528838,Ohio fisherman,2003-03-19 16:10:00,989,"Hi Guys: Does anyone have any information about Louie's Outposts from Blind River, Ontario? They run a boat-in outpost cabin on Rocky Island Lake. I am interested in going there, but would like to know about the fishing and the accomodations. What do you know? Thanks, Ohio Fisherman"
528839,Guest,2003-03-19 16:57:00,0,"I used to fish this lake all the time when moose hunting its a really, really beautiful scenic area and the walleye/pike action is pretty good.Lots of shoals and stumps all over the place so unless you know this lake you need to be extra carefull.I have never stayed in the cabin they refer to so I can help you there but I have seen it. There is also 1 other outfitter on this lake as well so you won't be alone.There is also good lake trout action to be had as this lake is man made and pretty long.I found white/pink jigs worked the best tipped with a worm to be most productive but the water levels go up and down due to the dam on the north western part of the lake that levels Aubrey lake for the power station and it is not uncommon to see a 10 foot drop in water levels within a week."
528840,Wawajake,2003-03-20 20:15:00,413,"I would suggest you do your homework on this lake.This lake was practically drained in August last year. It hit a few papers in Ontario , how greed of Hydro plant owner (new owner) decided to cash in high price of hydro and supply the ""air conditioner "" market at the expense of thousands and thousands of fish that perished in pools that over heated and lacked food etc.Many of the tourist operators were shocked at this companies disregard for natural resource balance. This lake used to only be lowered in mid winter and fish stocks seemed to manage with the only one severe drain. Unfortunately hydro deregualtion will cause other Ontario reservoirs to be abused by private hydro companies as they buy up the formerly government owned dams and reservoirs.Perhaps ask operator how close to normal levels is lake expected to be at be at the time of your trip. (and be prepared for meagre fishing for awhile. (my brother used to fish this lake each summer since he lives close by,)Hopefully the Ministry of natural resources will close regulation loopholes this operator used at resource expense.jake"
