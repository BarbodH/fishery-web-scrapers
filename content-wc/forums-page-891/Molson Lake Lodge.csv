528916,North Of 55,2003-03-25 10:02:00,0,"I fished this lake for years & its a great fishery.The Norway House indian reserve which owns the land around the lake & recently bought the lodge closed the lake off to any anglers that used to drive in.This lake is very beautiful & offers trophy walleye,pike,& laketrout fishing.I had caught trophies in all of these species,the biggest being a 49"" pike!The lake is 45 miles long & at parts about 15 miles wide with very clear water(calm days-can see 15-25' down).June offers some of the best fishing.The average size of walleye was about 18""-24"" & some 27""-30"" not uncommon.The lodge is half decent & in a nice location.I stayed there twice in the winter 3 years ago during ice fishing trips.They have to leave the lodge unlocked during the winters in case of emergency.This lake was one of my favorite lakes to fish before it was closed to the general public & hope they open it again someday.If you get the chance to go do it."

528918,stewart,2003-03-25 19:15:00,100,According to a guide I know who has worked there for a while Max lake is really the outpost for pike.
528919,Northern Manitoban,2003-03-26 13:06:00,195,"Stewart you are right on that one.Max lake. Us white people were allowed to fish Molson 2 weeks ago,the Norway House band had a fishing derby there,and they even gave transportation to the lake from the main road.I would have liked to go but why should i support one of there derbys when i can't fish Molson any other time.FISH ON."
