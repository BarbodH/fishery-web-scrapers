527864,Guest,2003-03-28 11:54:00,0,Just make up some snells using #4 or #6 hooks with a slip sinker.We use leaches and night crawlers no minnows didnt need them.
527865,Guest,2003-03-28 12:54:00,0,"Gleen,you won't need help. There are so many Walleyes in that Lake you will get tired of fishing them. We were there in late July of last year and catching 100+ Walleyes a day was no problem. The bunus is big Northern, ever at that time of the year. But I guess that is another story.Have fun!!!"
527866,proV,2003-03-30 00:25:00,7,"We also are staying at evergreen the same time as you, look for us I'd like to talk to you."
527852,Glenn,2003-02-20 07:58:00,17,Going to lac Seul for the first time. Staying at Evergreen end of June...Any help with tactics for Walleye would be appreciated. We have our own boat with all the goodies.THANKS
527853,Guest,2003-02-20 08:51:00,0,"You will be there at about the beginning of summer patterns and the fish will be moving somewhat deeper than the patterns around opener. Evergreen Lodge, head honcho, Gary will be keyed in on the fish and he will get you headed in the right direction. Some people will be bottom bouncing, some will use jigs and cranks, and the best will use all three."
527854,Guest,2003-02-20 09:20:00,0,"Phil is right...Gary is extremely helpful. I was at Evergreen last year in late June/early July. Our most consistent walleye bite was with a spinner and crawler. Others in camp were doing very well with a spinner/minnow. The best numbers came from 8 to 14 FOW along sandy island shorelines and off rocky points. We found some bigger fish in the 20-foot range in those areas, but not as many. Rocky mid-lake humps were also good, especially in the evening, but watch out because some of them get real shallow in a hurry. I have a mangled prop to prove it."
527855,Guest,2003-03-26 20:05:00,0,i've been to lac seul twice. its about 90% jig fishing i recomnd 1/8 to 3/8oz depends on the wind. Tip it with a minnow is a deadly combo. The fish here hit any bait so you shouldn't have any troubles.
527856,Guest,2003-03-27 07:01:00,0,"It may be about 90% jig fishing for you, but it's 90% bouncing for me. I use the bouncer almost exclusively and do very well thank you."
527857,Big Tim,2003-03-27 08:21:00,63,OK. but what do you drag behind the bouncer?
527858,Guest,2003-03-27 19:50:00,0,i went fishing lac seul and used bottom bounces at first. I had 3 in my boat n we got snagged just as many times as we hooked into fish. I would like to know the reccomend bottom bounces rig to use to keep snagg free.
527859,2 DOGS,2003-03-27 20:41:00,361,"My friend if you are looking for a snag-free experience on Lac Seul you have to cut everything off after the knot in your line. If you aren't getting hung up, you ain't fishin walleye."
527860,Dave,2003-03-27 21:01:00,258,really??? i just want something that doesn't get caught up all the time instead of reg. bullet weights
527861,Guest,2003-03-28 10:06:00,0,"Look in Cabelas for the flex-o-sinkers<-or something like that. They look like little grey works. They have about 6 or 7 small round weights about the size of beads inside and they work GREAT. Bought some 4 years ago and have all but one. Northern hit while trolling and when he got up to the boat started thrashing and cut my main line. Didnt know it and after everyhing was done, re-baited hook and throw it over to watch it sink straight to the bottom.These will get snagged every so often, but give a hard jerk and they pop free. I will try to get back with the page number or a link for them."
