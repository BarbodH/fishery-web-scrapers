528889,Dave,2003-03-24 06:48:00,258,I am looking at a 6' M Cabela's XML spinning rod for jigging. I'd be interested in hearing other's experience and/or opinions on these rods.
528890,2 DOGS,2003-03-24 08:44:00,361,"XML is a fantastic rod, I have 6', 7' and would have to say I enjoy the 7 footer a little more for jigging. Either one is very sensitive and you'll love it. If you buy 2 the third one is free."
528891,Ohio fisherman,2003-03-25 21:02:00,989,"Hi Dave:I just received a new combo from Cabelas. The Prodigy reel with an XML rod. I ordered this combo for bottom bouncing, however, I have used it here at home today and my son used it yesterday and we caught about 35 bass. That is a wonderful combo. The rod is great - and I have been accused of being a G.Loomis snob. This makes me re-think the rod situation. If the other rods in this series are equally as good, I would say it would be great for anything. As posted above, I also like a 7 foot rod for jigging. In fact, I prefer a 7 foot rod for almost everything.Good fishing. O F"
528892,Dave,2003-03-26 07:29:00,258,DOGS & OF:Thanks for your insight. You have me pretty convinced on the XML and have me thinking about a 7' vs. 6'. I am thinking of the XML with a Shimano Symetre. I heard the Owatana store was selling the combo for $130. Dave
528893,bubbalou,2003-03-27 08:47:00,29,"Do you like the medium action or medium heavy. I fish for walleye only with my spinning rigs, northerns are just a part of the deal. I looked up the add in Cabela's Tackle Shop and the price is $150. Still not a bad price when you look at the rod seperately. I have always gotten along good with Shimano. Let me know your thoughts on the medium or medium heavy. :-)"
528894,2 DOGS,2003-03-27 09:53:00,361,"Personal preference is the medium action. Seems stiff enough to handle the ""slimers"" as well as the big lady walleyes. I also prefer the Shimano Spirex but substitute a single handle in place of the double. After a dozen Shimano's, have yet to encounter a failure."
528895,Dave,2003-03-28 06:41:00,258,Bubbalou:Cabela's website listed the XML-Symetre combo for $134.98 item IC-115860. Better than the catalogue but not as good as the store.
