528949,Guest,2003-03-25 20:12:00,0,"You can camp on Lac Seul only if you are a resident of Canada, otherwise rules apply to how far you must be away from Lac Seul. Check with MNR for exact rules. Used to be able to camp in Broad and Sunlight which was accessible to Seul by stream. No longer."

Also if you go to the Local town Ministry/Gov't. you should be able to obtain some sort of permit to camp in the area you want to go. I would try and contact them before heading up the you know eh?
