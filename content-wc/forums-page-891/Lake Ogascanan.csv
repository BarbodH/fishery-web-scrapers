529053,Peekay,2003-03-28 10:18:00,7,"Went there for 5 days just after the opener last year. Due to the very late spring thaw, they were still spawning & the fishing was slow(as it was for this time period in much of Ontario & Quebec...temps were just above freezing at times). On windy days the chop on the main channel can be almost unmanageable. Brad & Ginny are excellent hosts & cabins were basic but clean, but it would be a bit unfair to rate my experience on the lake due to the very late spring. Do a search on the Canada forum using Ogascanan as the keyword and include the archives & you will get many threads about the lake.Email me at [email protected] for more info.Peekay"
