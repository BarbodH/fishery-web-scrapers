520432,Tim,2002-05-17 08:28:00,179,I've been told that leeches are ineffective during the early season because they stay inactive due to the cold weather. Is it worth puchasing them or do most of you stick with minnows and/or crawlers?

520436,Xplorer,2002-05-17 11:42:00,244,Been using leeches here in northern Minn the last week with very good success both jigging and rigging. Water temps have been 43-45 since opener. Xplorer

We keep them in a cooler with a plastic bottle of ice and we cover them with lake water. This helps condition them and keeps them from curling. I also like to hook them through the top of the head so they are upside down. I think that gives them better action. Fish them on the bottom and SLOW....lift your rod and dont let there be any SLACK......Catch and Release
520438,Guest,2002-05-17 18:50:00,0,The only time leeches are bad is when you can't buy them. They are tough to beat right now. - Go for it!
520439,Piscatorian,2002-05-17 21:13:00,12,"Common misconception that they don't work great in cold water, caused by people that don't keep them cold enough. Always keep them colder than the water. Get some nice big cobras, and you'll be glad you did."
