520416,Tom,2002-05-17 07:27:00,1063,The lodges are telling me the first week of June hopefully.
520417,Northern Manitoban,2002-05-17 12:51:00,195,"Well i'm guessing june 1st i hope because i'm suppose to arrive at Reed on the 31st of May until the 6th of June.Was there just over 4 weeks ago and the Laker action was great.There was 33 inches of ice then.I'm going to take a drive out there on the 28th of May to see if the ice will be off,unless i here from someone else that it has cleared.I will post here when i here or see whats developing.Looks like we will be there at the same time,look for a blue 92 jeep Yj white top with a Lund Alaskan,and a burgandy Ford truck.Drop by for a cold one and some fishing stories.Its a great place.FISH ON."
520418,hksbh,2002-05-17 16:08:00,3,Hey NM Thanks for the reply. How are the water levels up there.Im not coming up till the 7th but I will let the group know who to look for.I have always been there the 1st week in june for the past 15 years but had to wait for the schools to let out in the cities because all the kids are coming this year. We decided to make it family year so it looks like I won't get much fishing in.There could be 20 kids up there with us.When were you there last year.
520419,Northern Manitoban,2002-05-18 13:23:00,195,"Hksbh.I was at Reed lake last june,first week around the 4th.I fish this Lake all year.If your bringing alot of kids have you ever thought about Wekusko falls campground its only 45 minutes away from Reed lake.There is alot more to offer for family and kids there.Beach,showers,playground,suspension bridges that cross the grassy river just a quick walk by the campsite."
