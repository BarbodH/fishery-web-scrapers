If not, any recommendations on where to buy leeches in La Rounge?? Know nothing about the town, only assumeing they would be available there.3. Any ideas on how the bugs might be??? Will the late ice out move them back any??"

If you do...Hopefully, the ice is off the lake by then :) You would pay an arm and a leg for leeches in La Ronge and there may not be any up there so, your best bet to get leeches would be in Saskatoon, SK, if possible. Reading the other posting on 'Leeches in Cold Water' will help you out too.On my website, I'm currently posting pictures of the ice situation on Lac La Ronge. A rule of thumb for the area is 'when Lac La Ronge is ice-free, all the lakes in the area will be ice-free,' As of May 17th, Lac La Ronge is about a month behind schedule for ice-out. Usually, the ice is gone by the middle of or beginning of May.Website: http://members.shaw.ca/napatak/Good luck!"
