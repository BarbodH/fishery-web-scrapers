There are plenty of islands that are suitable for camping. The only issue is you need to get a permit through an outfitter (sharon's outfitting) which requires you rent something from her. We would usually rent a tent to get the permit.Long trip to get there, and not nice on trailers, but well worth it once you are on the lake.If there is a campground on the southwest side of the lake, I have not ever known about it. (that goes back to the mid 70's) But then again, one could have been added. If so, please let me know where-about it is...It might be alot better than hauling everthing out onto an islandsteve"
