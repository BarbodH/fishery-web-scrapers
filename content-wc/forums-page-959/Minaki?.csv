520181,brian1785,2002-05-14 13:00:00,1534,I'll be going up theret the second week of June to stay at the Northstar Village. Any patterns/locations at that time I should be aware of?
520183,DonC,2002-05-14 15:39:00,93,"Aaron, the ice is essentially out at Minaki. I talked to the owner of Birch Island Resort today. Big Sand still has ice. I will be up there May 25th for a week, and am concerned about the fishing patterns for smallmouth and crappie with all this cold weather.Don"
520184,Guest,2002-05-15 16:41:00,0,"Aaron, I was up at Pistol Lake last weekend and on Sunday the ice was more like slush and only covered 3/4 of the lake. I guarantee with the wind and sun we have had the past couple days that the ice is gone from this lake. On Saturday there were three or four boats doing their best to break up the ice and slush in the bay in front of the marina. That too will be gone by now.I am going up this weekend and can let you know if conditions are any different than I have stated.Le pic"
520185,Guest,2002-05-15 19:03:00,0,Le Pickerel - If you were near Pistol Lake did you happen to drive by Worth Lake to see if the ice was out?
520182,brian1785,2002-05-16 11:29:00,1534,Can anybody point me in the right direction for Minaki? Any help would be appreciated. Looking for walleyes second week of June. Staying at Northstar Village. Thanks anyone!
520186,Guest,2002-05-16 19:11:00,0,"gerry, I did not check out Worth Lake this past weekend but I did the weekend before last. It was still ice bound but large areas were open and the ice was slushy. I would put good money on it being completely clear by now as most smaller lakes that I saw on my way up there like Catasrtophy and Catherine were clear.If the weather gets any colder than it is today, they might all freeze over.lolLe pic"
