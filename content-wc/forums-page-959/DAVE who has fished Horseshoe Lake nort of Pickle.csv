520251,Dave,2002-05-16 04:48:00,258,Lenray- The name of the lake is Badesdawa but they call it Mud Lake up there. We fished the mouth of the Otoskwin River and had excellent luck. If you go up the Otoskwin River you will come to a twin falls. It would be worth going up there just to see it and a good spot for shore lunch. The lake is about 30 miles up the gravel road. I would stop at the Pickle Lake township office and get a map of the lake.We are headed to Sioux Lookout next week to fish Minnitaki. Good luck.
520249,Guest,2002-05-16 07:29:00,0,Thanks LoboIs the lake you are talking about east and downriver on the Pipestone from Horseshoe????Thanks for the info.len
520252,Guest,2002-05-16 16:34:00,0,Thanks Dave for sharing that info. with me again trusting we all have a very good fishing trip may be some rather cool damp weather but the bugs shouldn't be much of a factor.len
520250,lobo1,2002-05-16 16:38:00,734,"Len,I didn't have time to dig out the maps - I'm scrambling to salvage a spring trip. I can't remember where Horseshoe is in relation to Kinloch.Steve"
