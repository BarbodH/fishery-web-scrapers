Then depending on the situation u have how evey long of snell u want. My self I have used 2 foot right up to 14 foot. Then u can have just a plan hook or maybe two. And a bead or to infront of it or even a float. If you fishing a really snagy area then a lot of times people will go with a float and a lindy no snag. There are all sorts of thing u can do, but there is just a rough outline."
