520105,fishmaster,2002-05-12 14:28:00,209,The wait could be longer than normal when crossing over on Saturday I would suggest crossing over on friday if possible. You might get lucky if you cross over early AM on on saturday but guys like to spend the night in International Falls and cross over early to beat the traffic.Good luck.

520107,Guest,2002-05-18 20:12:00,0,Cross over real early... about 5am if you can. That way you hit the duty free shop when they open at 4am and go right over. The traffic when we came back was over 5 miles long... just waiting to go over. Everyone with a boat attached got flaged over and checked.There is always a hotel close... I would definately get there way ahead of schedule.
