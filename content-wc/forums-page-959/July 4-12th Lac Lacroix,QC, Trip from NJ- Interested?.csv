520445,Guest,2002-05-17 19:30:00,0,"Taking a fly-out trip to Lac Lacroix July 4 - 12th. We have a group of 5 booked but a 6th would put 2 in each boat. Departing from Central NJ on the 4th of July and flying out on the 5th. Return flight scheduled for the 12th. We are in a cabin with hot showers and indoor toilet, propane fridge and lights. Nothing fancy but comfortable for being in the sticks.Total cost per person should be about $1,200(US) with incidentals. If you are from the NJ area and have any interest just drop a line to:[email protected]"
