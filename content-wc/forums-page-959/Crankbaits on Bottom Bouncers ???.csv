520192,Guest,2002-05-14 09:48:00,0,Has anyone ever used crankbaits on bottom bouncers? I have had some luck with these on rivers fishing downstream and retrieving slowly. Has anyone tried this on lake structure? Going to Lac Seul for the first time and want to know if this is a waste of time....Thanks
520193,Toolman,2002-05-14 12:44:00,2570,"Todd,Bottom bouncers work with many different presentations, including cranks. You need to use shallow floating designs to prevent snags. In very clear water you may want to lengthen the lead to 6-8"", if you can. Remember to not drag the bouncer. Make contact occasionally, to stay in the zone (if the fish are right on the bottom). Good luck.Tim"
520194,Iowa Eye,2002-05-15 05:51:00,104,I have had good luck using the clip on style weights that are most often used with planner boards. I let out about 25' of line and then clip on the weight. I feel the long leader allows good action with a shallow crank. When a fish is on just reel in till the clip comes up and quickly release it and continue to play the fish.If using a bottom bouncer I use a slidding weight such as the lindy no snag ahead of a swivel. I feel this sllows the entire line and rod to absord the shock of a strike.
520195,Guest,2002-05-15 06:37:00,0,"Crankbaits will work fine on bottom bouncers for walleye on lac seul, but they will not out-perform crawlers. I have tried crankbaits and crawlers side by side extensively on lac seul and have not noticed any improvements in size or numbers over crawlers. Sometimes it's fun to try. Most of our tackle boxes are probably cluttered with fishless crankbaits; it's kind of fun to put one of those ridiculous lures that we all tend to buy and finally catch something on it! One more thing, this may sound pretty odd, but putting a bright (chartruese, orange, or white) plastic worm or grub with fish attractant in the place of a crawler on a spinner rig can have great results. We discovered this playing around when we ran out of bait one year. The results were 3 fish between 27 and 29 inches in a day. Two of the top fish that year. Luck?-- maybe, but might be worth a go. Hope this helps."
520196,Behle,2002-05-15 08:51:00,51,The twisters on spinner rigs have worked for us as well. We've used both bright colors as well as natural colors that imitate the colors of leeches and crawlers. Both with success.
520197,Guest,2002-05-15 09:20:00,0,"Behle...shouldn't you be teaching or something? What'd I say, maybe we should try a crank or a spoon off of the old bottom bouncer. Anyway, we caught a lot of walleye on bottom bouncers/spinners with leeches/twisters. We also had some significant action on cranks. I'm still torn on how much time I want to spend on any given presentation. BTW, I had to buy two new Yo-zuri Crystal Minnows last night (They were calling my name...don't they always). Have a good one.5 weeks and 2 days!"
520198,Behle,2002-05-15 11:11:00,51,If they only knew how much time you are wasting here instead of working! Hard to concentrate on work when the trip is such a short time away. Have most of the menu planned and am in the middle of figuring out how much to buy of everything. Don't ruin your appetite for fish by eating too much now! You are head cook this year so start brushing up on your skills. Some guys will do anything to get out of cleaning fish.
