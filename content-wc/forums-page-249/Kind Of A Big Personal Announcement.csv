4276586,new hips,2015-10-21 14:46:00,498,Good for You............I certainly wish the best for you. You have been a valuable asset to Walleye Central for a long time.

4276834,Knutson21,2015-10-21 15:59:00,348,"Where can I find subscription info? Thanks, Bryan"
4276946,Mike Borger,2015-10-21 16:37:00,1554,"Thanks Bryan, ultimately the info will be on my website in early November but I'll let everyone know somehow."
4276978,v-bay gord,2015-10-21 16:45:00,3168,"Whether it flies or not may not be the point, but going with something that obviously means a lot to you does. Best of luck (just don't sell the family farm.....) I look forward to seeing the first edition.......more details when available please."

Your mag will be the beginning,television will want you next."

4276226,Mike Borger,2015-10-21 12:13:00,1554,"My uncle who is now passed away was always my biggest supporter. One of the things he always said to me was ""Mike, if you're really passionate about something you will be a success - follow your dream!"" Well, after a lot of years I'm finally taking his advice. In many ways it's the biggest leap of faith I've ever taken and I'm equal parts excited and nervous, but the fact remains there is no reward in life without some kind of risk! I've been a writer for some time now having been published in a number of magazines. It's always been a passion, but it's also a lot of work for very little pay. After thinking long and hard about my future earlier this year I decided to launch my own magazine. More than anything the ability to do precisely what I want in the way that I want means everything.Kind of ironic as the topic of magazines was raised earlier this year on this forum (some good feedback btw):https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=431634Here's a snapshot of of our first cover. Wish me luck"
4276250,ftfarms,2015-10-21 12:19:00,444,Good luck Mike. How would we get this magazine in the states?
4276266,Mike Borger,2015-10-21 12:38:00,1554,Thank you!! You can subscribe to it either digitally or in print and have it mailed to your home. Beyond that I'm looking at distribution Stateside. As soon as I know exactly how/where it'll be available I'll let everyone know.
4276298,tv4fish,2015-10-21 12:42:00,2694,"Best of luck to you, Mike. (Based on the articles that I have read --- I think your mag will do just fine)"
4276370,retire55,2015-10-21 13:07:00,1029,"Hi Mike, Best of luck with your new endeavour. I'm looking forward to some wonderful reading."
4276378,adempsey,2015-10-21 13:18:00,963,Best of luck following your dreams! Not an easy thing to do I am sure. Looking forward to the first issue.
4276386,Pikeslayer8,2015-10-21 13:22:00,1460,"Congrats Solopaddler! Another cool life venture for you and your family and I wish you all the success possible. If there is any way I can help, more than happy to."
4276418,Mike Borger,2015-10-21 13:37:00,1554,"Thanks guys, it means a lot."
4276450,ziggyzag,2015-10-21 13:56:00,125,Mike: Good luck from what I have seen in the past I believe your magazine will be a big hit.
4276538,Bakefish,2015-10-21 14:24:00,1077,"Good luck, it's tough out there in the print world. I prefer printed material (geezer status), but I'm not so sure about the young folk. Speaking for myself though, I just might give your mag a shot."
