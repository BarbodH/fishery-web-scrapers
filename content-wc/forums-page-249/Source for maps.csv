4271602,TIGHTLINER,2015-10-19 06:40:00,223,I have a map that i have had since 1988 took a large 1 gal zip lock baggie and folded the map down so what does not get on one side you flip it over and have the other part of the map right there. Has been through a lot rain sleet and snow storms and still looks as good as the day i put it in.

4362489,adempsey,2015-12-07 00:39:00,963,"Not that I am aware of.However, the Fish ON-Line site shows depth contours for some lakes.The Navionics WebApp is good too."
4270074,Camoclad,2015-10-18 06:00:00,628,"On our fly-in trips we always get a map from our outfitter of the lake we fish. They are sufficient though are not very durable and only show the immediate area of the lake. I am looking for something a bit more detailed and possible printed on waterproof paper. Do any of you bring maps, and if so where do you get them? We are fishing just outside the NW boundary of Wabakimi PP. Thanks."
4270114,h8go4s,2015-10-18 06:29:00,1673,"You can get Ontario topo maps here, but I don't know if that's what you're looking for. You won't find lake contour maps for fly-in lakes anywhere that I know of.http://shop.milwaukeemap.com/ontario"

4270498,Camoclad,2015-10-18 10:45:00,628,"Thanks guys, the Milwaukee maps link is perfect. Just what is was looking for."
4270754,adempsey,2015-10-18 13:50:00,963,"I have been slowly putting up the maps I have on my site. If the lake is not listed, let me know and I can take a look to see if I might have it.http://www.lineonfishing.com/index.p...ake-depth-mapsYou can download the PDF and go get it printed and laminated.The Ontario Gov also has a site to make topo maps for free.https://www.ontario.ca/page/topographic-maps"
4270834,Camoclad,2015-10-18 15:00:00,628,Thanks adempsey. We are going to Coles next summer. I appreciate the information and the links.
4270866,adempsey,2015-10-18 15:29:00,963,"Unfortunately, Coles is a lake I do not have a depth map for."
4270898,pjshorthorn,2015-10-18 15:46:00,5654,CanadaMapSales.com is another good source for maps of Ontario and Manitoba lakes. They offer both paper and waterproof versions of the lakes in their catalog. PjShorthorn.
4270994,Camoclad,2015-10-18 17:31:00,628,"Thanks PJ. You should come with us next summer, we can pick you up at 985 on the way down! We will probably need a biscuit from Rabbittown anyway!"
4271186,pjshorthorn,2015-10-18 19:33:00,5654,"Now that is an offer a fella can't refuse. A ride, biscuits and a fly-in remote trip. PjShorthorn."
