4359713,dhottle,2015-12-05 10:38:00,163,That's what we always used.
4360681,Baseline,2015-12-05 20:46:00,3207,They make suction cups for this. If a suction cup is not made to fit your transducer then I'm with the cheap fix. I used this many times. One old 2 X 1 - one adjustable clamp - attach transducer. Cost $5 or less. Remember to drill a hole in the board to attach a safety lanyard and then tie off on the boat's stern just incase the clamp should loosen up.

4361529,Andre (wallyandre),2015-12-06 11:32:00,2274,I use this one:http://www.titelok.com/product-p/trd-5hs798.htm
4361577,billy weaver,2015-12-06 12:35:00,470,"Bought one a couple of months ago from Bass Pro. It was made by Sully Manufacturing, Inc. Sully Iowa. Its all aluminum and compact. Model 8001 P Its clamp on with all kinds of adjustment."
4362081,adempsey,2015-12-06 17:58:00,963,"I used to use a pre-fab one made by Tite-Lok. I hated it. It moved around too much, was heavy, awkward and clumsy.Now, I use a 2 foot piece of 1x3 with a 3"" C-Clamp. Works like a charm. I usually bring a very thin piece of wood panel to put between the clamp and the boat as well so I can really clamp it down without damaging the boat."
4362249,BornToFish,2015-12-06 19:29:00,1224,I too used the wooden stick and c-clamp for many years. I eventually bought the Cabela's Portable Transducer Bracket that is made of aluminum. I bought the model called Standard Boat Bracket (ca. $45). It continues to work great. Good fishing and tight lines!!
4362281,123chadder,2015-12-06 19:43:00,429,"i use a 1"" x 3"" piece of pine and screw the transducer to the bottom and slide the top through the handle at the back of a tinny....fits nice and snug and easy to move when having to get to another spot"
4365281,MrSimon,2015-12-08 09:06:00,922,This is exactly what I use.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_nfH9brIu4
4357953,Eric.hallagan,2015-12-04 15:59:00,32,"Anybody have a portable transducer mount they use on fly ins? I have a hummingbird unit I need one for and was wondering if anybody had a plan or has made one- I would need obviously no holes or drilling, and be used with a 15 horse wide open - thanks Eric"
4358009,Limeyangler,2015-12-04 16:20:00,563,"I just use a piece of aluminium flat bar and screw the mount to it, then clamp in on the transom with a C clamp. My rig does 27mph, not lost one yet."
4358297,Eric.hallagan,2015-12-04 17:52:00,32,I appreciate it! Just curious how thick would u say your piece of aluminum is?
4358321,Mike Borger,2015-12-04 18:04:00,1554,"A piece of wood with the transducer screwed into it, clamped onto the transom with an oversized c-clamp."

4358745,Ndstallmann,2015-12-04 21:11:00,549,"Bought one at Cabelas 3 years ago, under $50 , used on two trips to Canada. Worked great. Oh buy the way bought an extra transducer also. So I didn't have take the one off my boat."
4359009,ftfarms,2015-12-05 05:00:00,444,The best I've seen is to take a old trolling motor thats junk and use the mount and shaft off it cut the top and bottom off and mount your transducer to it. Now you got tilt and up and down. Works great.
4359073,Ndstallmann,2015-12-05 06:00:00,549,"Here is the Cabelas mouth I use , Item: IK-010095"
