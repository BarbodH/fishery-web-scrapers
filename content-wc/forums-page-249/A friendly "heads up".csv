4369897,phishfearme,2015-12-10 11:34:00,1242,you can't get a license without a valid outdoor card - it's almost an automatic reminder - when the card is up you have to re-up when you get a license. phish
4370257,kzoofisher,2015-12-10 15:32:00,5144,"Also remember that the license is now printed on the card so if you get a one year license you will need to carry paper licenses the last two years, but if you get a three year everything will be on the card until it expires."
4370305,Juls,2015-12-10 15:58:00,13414,Thanks for the reminder. I renewed my card today.
4370441,NARDA 1,2015-12-10 18:28:00,636,Also check the expiration date on your passport.
4371217,Babamel2,2015-12-11 08:14:00,414,"thanks for the reminder on the outdoor card, as a friendly reminder, also check your passport expiration. Keep in mind it will take longer to get a pass port, than a license or outdoor card."
