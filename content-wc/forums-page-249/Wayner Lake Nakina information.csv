Last year I went to 7 lakes wilderness camps in Nakina and fished Marshall lake for a week. It was an excellent trip even though we had the worst weather I have ever experienced in September. I am looking to head back there in 2016 and was thinking about booking a newly acquired (smaller) camp on Wayner lake. I can't seem to find much information on the lake and am reaching out to this forum for a little help. How's the fishing? Cabin? Boats? Any info at all would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your time. Don"
