Does Ontario send them out at a certain time of year, or is based on when an outfitter sends the form in. My trip was in July. Not so much interested in the $, just wondering if the outfitter followed through with what I was told."
4362649,pjshorthorn,2015-12-07 06:14:00,5654,My impression is that the refund timing is based on when the form is submitted. We finished our trip at the end of July and had our refund check by mid October. Our paperwork was filled out and ready for signature when we checked out of camp. Sent the check to our outfitter as part of our trip payment for next year.PjShorthorn.
4362993,port1042,2015-12-07 09:24:00,509,I requested mine in the middle of Oct. and it came about 10 days ago. A while back there was discussion about taking the check to the Dryden Walmart and cashing it there or using it as a store credit and buying groceries. Can anyone comment on this? Do they really cash them at Walmart?
4363097,Shellback,2015-12-07 09:53:00,8083,"So my trip was over July 24th. At that time I believe I signed paper work for the tax refund, and was told they were entering 2 fish we caught that were eligible OFAH awards program. Haven't heard a thing on either. I guess I need to contact the folks."
4363121,pjshorthorn,2015-12-07 10:02:00,5654,"I would follow up. Not that it matters,but I've always entered our fish that qualified for OFAH. A fun way to remember the Bigg' ins and easy to do. PjShorthorn"
4363153,Shellback,2015-12-07 10:22:00,8083,"I entered a fish before myself, but I watched as they filled out the paper work while I was there, so I didn't want to double enter."
4364945,Babamel2,2015-12-08 05:17:00,414,"A few years ago I sent in my request for a refund along with a receipt and it was denied, saying it did not qualify. What needs to be included on the receipt for it to qualify for a refund?"
4365033,BornToFish,2015-12-08 06:52:00,1224,"I too have found getting the HST rebate something akin to rolling the dice. I would sometimes receive the rebate, and other times not. I did a little research on this a while back. I learned that a vacation needs to be viewed as an ""eligible tour package"" that provides an ""eligible service"" in order to receive a rebate for the HST paid. I recollect that eligible services might be fish cleaning or training for boat safety (e.g. how to dock your boat or trim your motor). Thus, the reason that your claim was denied could be as simple as to how your lodge operator worded your invoice (i.e. the paper documentation that you submitted). The owners of the lodges that I fish from have some ""throw in"" type language that addresses the eligible services, such that I am entitled to the rebate. I eventually came to realize that the Canadian government, just like that in the United States, simply hates to part with my money. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4365105,Shellback,2015-12-08 07:33:00,8083,I think I got things straightened out
4365777,MrSimon,2015-12-08 12:37:00,922,"I got my rebate check and deposited into my checking account ..... the fees my bank charged me for processing a foreign check were almost as much as the check itself. Oh well, lesson learned. Something is better than nothing, I guess."
