4320994,GBS,2015-11-14 08:28:00,2271,"This is a drive to: http://www.grassriverlodge.com/ Full day drive straight north from Winnipeg. Make sure your tank is full, few places to stop and fill up. Lots of bear, wolves, caribou, lynx seen along the way and there. Even though Flin Flon is the closest town, it is still almost a full day to get to it and back from the lodge. So lodge is effectively equivalent to a fly-in. Ike and his wife do a fantastic job. Full meals. Great cabins. Emphasis is on big northerns, but huge lakers are available as well as great walleye. My best was a 52"" northern. Ones in the 36-45 range were so common, we started acting like we were catching hammer handles! You'll catch many each day. I did not fish for lakers, but at the appropriate times of the year, they apparently are also a big numbers game. Always caught walleye quickly for a shore lunch. Breakfast and dinners are served in the main lodge. Ike offers one-day fly-ins for those that want to catch huge numbers of big walleye. Only downside is that all fishing is with a lodge provided guide and boat, so cost is higher due to that."
4321554,adempsey,2015-11-14 15:13:00,963,Looks like a great lodge.

4329786,Cil,2015-11-18 20:38:00,10,The place for you group would be a boat in resort with only four cabins and the lake has all the fish you need including trout check it out at www.cedarislandlodge.com. If you looking for a flyin Dave Beaushane out of Nestor Falls has really nice accommodations in the middle of no where both places are only 1 from International Falls border.
4352849,Zac Amoroso,2015-12-02 13:23:00,2,"Check out Kesagmai Wilderness Lodge. It iss a 4 star Lodge and has amazing service and accommodations. The fishing there is both Northern Pike and Walleye. Tons of pike of 40+ inches are caught each year and 100 walleye in the one to four pound range per day are common. You can choose to stay in the lodge rooms or in cabins, both have great beading and accommodations for every age. Boats are 21', 1500 pounds and are specifically molded to fit the waters of Kesagami Lake. Check out the link to the website for more information and great pics of the wildlife, accommodations, and fishing offered at the lodge. http://kesagami.com/"

4304098,bftiger,2015-11-05 14:48:00,21,I believe there are a couple of black bear lodges. Is this the one on red lake?
4304122,sloughboy,2015-11-05 15:01:00,13,"Go to Big North Lodges web site and look under Rogers Lake. We fished it 2 years ago first week of August. The cabin was in excellent condition. We really enjoyed the living room and screened in porch. The bathroom was an outhouse, but did have a flush toilet so top of the line outdoor privy. The lake is predominantly a small mouth fishery. We focused on walleyes and did well I would guess on the average 75 fish per boat per day. Size average was probably around 18-20"" fair number of fish in the mid 20s. Largest was a 27 and a 28. For bass we had two at 19. I think you could easily catch 125 small mouth per day in the 17""range. The lake fishes extremely well in adverse weather. Big North flew in every day to check on us. Big North does have two cabins on the lake (separated) and another outfitter has two other cabins."

We have never hired a guide, lake is easy to fish and you have the English river to explore. Their daily shore lunches are the best I have ever had, not your standard fish, potatoes, beans. If you are looking for a full service lodge I would highly recommend Maynard."

4274498,Nick(Ia),2015-10-20 14:17:00,327,"Hey all, I know this is a broad topic that has been hashed out on these boards many times over the years. However, I don't get on the board alot these days and I haven't been into Canada/Ontario in almost 10 years. I used to go to a couple of drive-ins by Lake of the Woods & up at Sioux Lookout. I've also done a variety of fly/boat/train ins that I really enjoyed. I quit going north for a variety of reasons-some real and some that I probably imagined but I'm ready to put aside my own prejudices for a chance to enjoy some time with old friends. I've been charged with planning and leading a reunion trip for a group of 55-60 year olds and their fathers, sons, grandsons etc. We will have a wide range of ages and a wide range of angling abilities. We could have a group ranging in size from 10-18. They would like to go remote so I believe a fly in/boat in is probably in order. What outfitters/lakes/resorts would you recommend for this undertaking? I think the priority order for picking a destination would be: 1) decent walleye/northern fishing-small mouth & lakers a bonus; 2) cabin/resort that is big enough to accommodate the group with a little bit of luxury...I'm old and so are most of the guys paying for it. I've slept on the ground, in a bag and in enough ""cabins"" with enough ""rustic"" living for my lifetime. Those places were great 20-30 years ago but I think we'd like to get something a little better for this trip. I don't want to say the this is a ""money-no object"" trip but most of these guys can afford to part with a little cash and are willing to do so IF the place is worth it. I know this is asking alot but I appreciate any leads or suggestions. Thanks, in advance, for your help and guidance."

4274690,BornToFish,2015-10-20 15:19:00,1224,"My wife and I fished at Stormer Lake Lodge for two weeks this season. You will find a trip report under a separate thread in this same forum. You will find an advertisement for the Lodge on this website's banner. This Lodge will easily satisfy the requirements that you set forth in your original post. This drive-to lodge is located about fifty miles north of Red Lake, Ontario. It's the only Lodge on two lakes that are connected to one another. Remoteness will not be an issue for you. The Lodge is entirely American Plan. The food is top-notch. Shore lunch is served on the lake every other day. You supply the fish. The other days are a box lunch. The walleye and pike fishing rivaled the best of our approximately one dozen fly-in fishing trips. The lakes were straight forward to figure out in terms of fishing - watch the wind to find the minnows. The walleyes and pike were near-by. Unfortunately, the lakes do not offer musky or lake trout. Send me a private message if you want further information. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

There are plenty of options in other provinces that would fit the bill, but looking strictly at Ontario here are my picks for outposts with an extra level of comfort.1.Nestor Falls Fly In Outpostshttp://nestorfalls.com/2. Thousand Lakes Outposts - Kearns Lakehttp://www.thousandlakesoutposts.com/content/Home/The trip I did myself this past August to Lake St. Joseph with Slate Falls Outposts was easily the most luxurious outpost I've ever visited and the fishing was spectacular.They operate three cabins on Eagle Island in the west end of the lake, each one operated independently of the other and very private. We stayed in the central cabin which was great, but I toured the west cabin and it's the nicest outpost I've ever seen in person. That's the one I'd try and get. Here's a short video tour I did of the west cabin:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvUGjxCDe60If you're interested here's my detailed write up on that trip - as I said the fishing was fantastic. It is however a very large body of water. Personally I love exploring and fishing big water but others don't. If you enjoy big water this would probably be a great fit for your group.http://www.canadafishingguide.net/la...eye-beat-down/"

4276482,sheepman,2015-10-21 14:05:00,98,I've always had good luck at Bull Moose Camp on upper goose lake bullmoosecamp.com No lake trout though. Outstanding walleye and northern fishing with abundant perch
4276546,John N,2015-10-21 14:36:00,362,"Hi Nick. While not a fly-in, several of us from your neck of the woods and beyond have been going to the Old Post on Lake St. Joseph for coming up on 20 years, in groups of 6-12. Due to the size of the body of water and the remoteness of the lake, it will be not unlike fly-in privacy on the water. Very rare to see another boat apart from your own group. The camp is cushy and comfortable, with very good service. The walleye and northern fishing is superb. Staff takes gear down to your boat every morning, meets you at the beach to take any gear back to your cabin after your return. Great shore lunches prepared daily, and very good breakfasts and dinners - if you choose. Might be worth a look.www.oldpost.com John"
