Coldest, windiest trip of my life for the mid/end of August. Weather was really crummy. Fishing was still decent to good. Just average for Lac Seul in August. Our fish numbers were down a little and so was size. Lots of under fish with average numbers of slot and overs. Big fish of the trip was twenty eight with one just under that by a fraction. One twenty seven and decent numbers of overs to 26"". Couple 36-40"" Northerns caught while fishing for walleye. All species of fish we caught were exceptionally rotund! Especially the smallies. They were very ""thick"".Smallmouth were in good form as I picked up a 19"", 18.5"", 18"", 2-17"" and lost a couple in the fifteen inch range. Most were caught trolling spinners for walleye. Otherwise we jigged minnows or leeches. Salted fresh minnows caught as many fish as live minnows. Paddle tailed soft plastic minnow imitators didn't do as well this year as past trips. Fish were a little more tentative and biting light with the unsettled weather.Weather was clearing the morning we left. (figures..) Camp seemed to be full. Lots of really nice boats tied up this year. If I were not so frugal (cheap) I would have had boat envy. Nasty storm dumping seven inches of rain on camp one evening (three hours) nearly swamped some boats without auto bilges. Lighting took out some chargers and trolling motor of the fellows in the cabin next to us. Camp took a lightning strike killing internet and TV. Power stayed on in camp during storm. Just a really bad storm.Mahkwa looks good. Camp was running well and there are all new docks now. The new docks are a fantastic improvement and appreciated by everyone I talked to. Quite a bit of tree/brush clearing which helps get a breeze through the camp when it's hot. Good water pressure all the time. They have added a second fish cleaning house on the House Keeping side. Where the phone used to be is now also a cleaning station.The road in is still in great shape. The washout area from last summer is good. It was a lot bigger washout than I had imagined. I serve on a rural township board and that would have been a major project for us. Just getting a large, long replacement culvert takes time plus all the aggregate and soil to install such a deep and long culvert is a big task in time and equipment.All in all it was a good trip with old friends, too much food and a good camp. But for the weather it was another great trip.Pooch"

4170921,lassh,2015-08-31 14:40:00,553,"Thanks for the report Pooch. Thats a beautiful smallmouth in your picture. I still haven't had the opportunity to fish Lac Seul, but if I did, I think Mahkwa would be high on list."
4177497,CycloneWalleyeHunter,2015-09-02 20:45:00,18,Thanks for the update. We are leaving the 18th for our fall Lac Seul trip. Can't get here soon enough for me.
4177617,Mike Borger,2015-09-02 21:17:00,1554,Sounds like you made the best of it. We battled through the same crap on Lake St. Joe same week. Was a great trip but a testament to perseverence.
4370289,Fisher-man,2015-12-10 15:44:00,422,"Glad to hear the resort is in better shape. We haven't been there in 5-6 years, and it was really going down hill. Screens knocked out of doors and not repaired, cabins smelling moldy, hardly even swept out for our arrival. We always liked and got along with Evelyn (I think that was her name) and Roger. We are planning another trip there September of '16."
4372329,Bill Krejca,2015-12-11 16:09:00,6107,"Love the coloration on the smallmouth you are holding, Pooch. It is interesting that there can be such a wide variation on the fish, even those caught in the same area. Bill"
