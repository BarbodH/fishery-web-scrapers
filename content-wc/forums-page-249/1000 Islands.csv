They are not ready for a fly-in or staying in the bush. I am looking at the 1000 island region of NY/Ontario. Does anyone have any experience with a kid friendly place to stay and rent boats from in this area? There will be at least 6 of us. I want to make this memorable and enjoyable for them. Fishing, swimming, boating, playing...... We would be going in the July/August time frame. Thanks in advance."

Grenadier and Adelaide to be specific. July and August fishing would be for bass, pike and perch which we would cook on the island. Even after many trips into the interior of Canada we still talk of the great family times had there. Caigers resort is in the area and on the water, I'll always remember watching a bowfin herd her young off the docks, and there are other resorts and motels. The area has crystal clear water and can be a challenge but I'm sure you could get some good advice locally. Have a great trip."

There are a lot of great family friendly resorts at a reasonable price. Many lakes have a great population of perch, bluegill, sunfish and crappie which is great for kids. We used to go to Rice Lake every year for a long time. Was great fun.Although, I am sure there are some nice places in the 1000 islands region as well, I just haven't been out that way."

The second one is still operating, it's Misty Isles. They have cottages and boats, but no swimming beach. http://www.mistyisles.ca/ A neighbor stayed at Twin Oaks on Bob's Lake. http://www.twinoakscamp.com/index.html Bob's lake is probably about 50 minutes or so from the bridge. Here's a link for cottages for rent in the area. http://www.cottagelink.com/cottlink/...on5/lon5.shtml"
