We will be staying at TLO cabin #3 and would like any info on this cabin, docks ect. but would be interested in hearing from anyone does not matter where or which cabin or outfitter they used. Thanks in advance for any and all info anyone would be willing to share."
4257682,dosxx,2015-10-11 16:51:00,60,Our group of four fished Abamassagi the first week of July 2015. We had a ball and the fishing was nothing short of excellent in both numbers and size. We targeted walleye only and used artificial lures only. Numbers were nuts a few days! I think the biggest was a 4-5 pound Walter (no scale so it is an estimate). We have been there a few times but never early in the year so I can't comment on the fishing at that time. Have fun!
4258130,ziggyzag,2015-10-11 22:12:00,125,Thanks for the reply any certain colors or type of artificial s proved the best for your group? I assume by July you where fishing a little deeper than we will need to fish at the end of May first of June. Were you fishing mid lake humps and such that time of year?

We also had a great lipless crankbait bite trolling in 10-15 feet of water. The fish were definitely relating to humps at times, but there were also some flats areas and rocky shorelines that yielded quite nicely. The only area we did not do well on is the long arm near TLO camp three. We fished it a couple of times and just did not catch much-- but I know folks have done well back there so maybe it was just a timing issue."

We fished the west and north side mostly. 2 The go to for us and the weeks behind us ( theres a log book in the cabin) was 1/4 oz jighead and 3inch white grub. 3. Theres a bay at the far west end of the lake ( a long ways from your cabin) that we sat in front of for 6 days. our 8 person group caught almost 3800 walleyes from that spot just vertical jigging. 4. Where the kaw river flows OUT we hammered them there too, but found boat positioning hard and easier to fish the bay opening. 5. 7lbs was the biggest eye and 37 "" was the biggest pike. I would love to answer any other questions if you want to pm me and i know Mike Borger on here knows a lot more about the lake than I do im sure."
4359017,Guest,2015-12-05 05:21:00,0,minnow can we bring a boat and follow the owner to the outpost (don't want to fly in) is that and extra charge or part of the $795 package shown on website (plan on calling owner) looks like 100 walleye days are possible any help appreciated probably be our September trip jim wolf Chicago boys how much time to get to outpost following owner ?
4361889,chris.brock,2015-12-06 15:52:00,112,It depends on water level. but there's a couple tricky rapids that have to be navigated to boat in.
