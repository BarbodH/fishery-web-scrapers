4337786,Algoma Guy,2015-11-23 10:12:00,48,I own a small outfitter along 2 sets of tracks. The Algoma Central Railway ACR and Canadas national train VIA come right by my place. I have a facebook page and website just search Ontario North Fishing Adventures. If you would like pm me for more information. Really nice to see people wanting to utilize the train. It is an amazing way to travel.

4338586,jaym,2015-11-23 18:13:00,89,"We have taken the train to Flindtlanding Camp for about the last 5 years. It is a great way to travel and a lot cheaper than by plane. However, be prepared, this year our train was 6 hours late going in and the guys coming in on the day we were leaving were 11 hours late. They said their train sat in Sioux Lookout all day waiting on freight trains."
4338994,Babamel2,2015-11-24 05:56:00,414,We took the train to allanwater a few years ago. We had a good experience fishing the lakes. Just be aware that the train is seldom on time -- often up to 3 - 4 hrs behind schedule.
4339074,Algoma Guy,2015-11-24 06:36:00,48,Thanks Mike!!!! Just recovering from the season and getting back into the swing of things. By the way EXCELLENT work on you're new endeavours!!! I will give you a call soon and we can chat and catch up.
4339306,jfaisten,2015-11-24 08:46:00,1060,Fished Barrington's a couple years ago -- the train ride in was great. The fishing was fine -- the folks running the lodge were outstanding.
4346017,Braggart,2015-11-28 11:25:00,22,"Have done remote train access many times, specifically in N Manitoba. Here's a link to last years trip (another forum). http://www.xtremesportfishing.com/fo...php?f=1&t=1801 It's not for everyone. Trains schedules are impacted by a myriad of factors, as mentioned in previous posts. In addition, remote service isn't always the most glamorous. However, given the right route, it can be an extremely cost effective way to access remote areas. In this case, we opted to take a few of our graduating kids on an end-of-the-year trip that ended up costing less than $10 a head for the train ride (each way), plus a small fee for gear/canoes. Best part...we tell the train where to stop, and then we get off. Nobody around. Train leaves, we are all on our own. Pick up is set via the return schedule, just be there on time, otherwise you're waiting for the next run which could be days away. Try flying a group of 8 into and out of a remote lake with stellar fishing for $250 on the high side give/take (from the staging area of course...cost a lot more in gas to drive there from home)."
4353385,Old Timer,2015-12-02 16:54:00,255,"I've fished the Allanwater three times. Plenty of moving water with hungry walleyes beneath all the rapids. I went in with my Grumman Sportboat and fished from Sesenanaga Lake to the south and Granite Lake to the north. And then up and down the Bright Sand River. My trips required a lot of portaging. But you can train in, stay at a camp and fish the main lakes from a standard rental boat. The train service is less than stellar, as the train came through in the middle of the night, both ways. We waved it down with a Coleman lantern. I can't remember whether it was late or not on my trips, but it probably was. One trip I rode in the locomotive. This was forty-some years ago. I moved on to other river systems because of the unpredictable train and the night service. However, I had no complaints about the quality of fishing. If you portage off the main lakes it's a walleye on every cast."
4354673,jkaup,2015-12-03 08:10:00,56,"Thanks for the reply's. Living in a rural area, we rarely ride the train. We fly to vacation spots 2-3 times a year and that gets mundane after a while. Even if the train is late, it rains for 5 days straight, whatever the case may be...it will be a terrific story to tell one day."
4336522,jkaup,2015-11-22 16:13:00,56,Anyone ever ride the train to get to a good walleye camp? Please share...sounds cool to me!
4336546,Andre (wallyandre),2015-11-22 16:27:00,2274,"Canada, USA?"
4336650,Baseline,2015-11-22 17:33:00,3207,"I'm not sure if Ontario even has remote passenger train. Canada is a big country, so you might be able to do it."
4336706,Andre (wallyandre),2015-11-22 18:05:00,2274,Sure for the province of Quebec and pretty sure there is some in Ontario
4336714,octanehi5,2015-11-22 18:09:00,1104,"Train in Quebec stops in Clova, Air Tamarac one of the best in Quebec"
4336746,Andre (wallyandre),2015-11-22 18:18:00,2274,Agree! There is also some from Parent (just before Clova)
4336762,jkaup,2015-11-22 18:24:00,56,I'm interested in Canada. Don't matter if its Ontario or Quebec. I'll check out air tamarac. Thanks! I know we pass two rail lines when we fly in with Mike at pfo.

4336874,adempsey,2015-11-22 19:26:00,963,Few more that have train-in service. Never been to any of them though.http://www.wildernessisland.com/http://www.lochisland.com/http://www.tatnallcamp.com/http://www.air-ivanhoe.com/fly-in-fi...g-outposts.php
