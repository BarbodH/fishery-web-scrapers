4367689,Aaron-IN,2015-12-09 12:47:00,500,"There are both LCBO and Beer Store in Kenora. Right down town there use to be a good cigar store, not sure what it was called or if it's still open."
4367793,adempsey,2015-12-09 13:52:00,963,"Alcoholic beverages can only be purchased at ""The Beer Store"" (yes that's the official name) or the LCBO stores. The LCBO sells hard liquor, wine and beer in mostly smaller sizes (some have 24s, some don't), while the beer store only sells beer. Both are next to each other in Kenora on Park Street.There are some small brewery's and wineries in Ontario that can sell at their own stores, not sure if Kenora hosts any micro-breweries or not.This place, JD Junction, at 11 and 71 supposedly sells cigars. Might not be on your route though.https://www.google.ca/maps/@48.64408.../data=!3m1!1e3"

What I learned: 1. Before I ever had a Cuban, I thought it was probably mostly hype, due to unavailability. It wasn't. They are so good! There are some great Dominicans too, but there's something more pungent about the Cubans. 2. If you can't afford the big Cubans (I couldn't) you might still be really happy with the small ones (I was). They burn super long. I loved the small Flor de Canos, Quintero and Partagas, and the prices weren't too bad. 3. The store in Kenora had Bances (an old Cuban brand) made in Canada with Cuban short filler tobacco that was a good deal for the money. Tasted Cuban, although not quite as good as the ones I listed above. 4. One of the stores offered to remove the bands and mail a box to a guy I met. They failed to remove the bands and listed ""cigars"" on the customs form. The package was arrived dismantled and re-assembled with ominous looking U.S. Customs tape. Not worth the risk. Have fun!"
