4365905,Bakefish,2015-12-08 13:45:00,1077,"The ""pay up front"" thread got me to thinking. I have been going to Canada at least once a year since the early 70's. Started out fishing Eagle Lake from a private cabin, then switched to a lodge down the lake from that cabin when we decided to move on. As an aside, that lodge was Little Norway(?) Lodge. I think that's now V-Bay Gord's place. Back on track...I think in those many years and many different lodges I can say that I've only been at one place I'd consider ""bad"".I've stayed in places that didn't have electricity, one place had electricity that shut off at 10. I've stayed at places that have had outhouses and mice and ripped up screens during mosquito season. I've gone back to those unluxurious places because something drew me to them. If there was something that wasn't what I expected or could tolerate I just didn't go back. Mostly I moved on because I wanted a new experience.That one place though. Wheeew, it was a doozie. It's still in operation, but under new management and considered one of the better places in the area. It started out that we were to meet the owner in town and he was going to boat us to a portage where we would transfer our gear to a trailer towed by a tractor. Well, the owner was late getting to town and we were beginning to get a little worried. Finally he shows up only to tell us that the tractor had broken down and he couldn't get us across the portage. Our options were to either fly in, or take the train. Since the train was right in town we chose that option.As we were loading our gear onto the baggage car the lodge owner noticed we had brought a 15 hp Johnson with us. He told us to leave it in the vehicle because he had great new motors at the lodge. So we did.The train ride was awesome. We had a few drinks and saw the Canadian woods like we've never seen them before. The conductor told us that our stop was approaching and to go back to the baggage car.The train came to a stop and we climbed down off the train.....in the middle of nowhere. The conductor pointed at a lake through the trees, down a steep hill and told us, ""you'll see her coming to get you in a boat."" We threw our gear on the siding and watched the train pull away. That told me that this wasn't the first time the train had been used instead of the portage. I forgot to mention, train fare was not included in the package.So we packed all of our stuff down the steep hill, which was quite the haul since we don't travel light. It took many trips. It's a good thing most of us were young at the time because it took all we could handle to make it down that slope. But sure enough, off in the distance we see a boat headed our way.We were a big group and needed two cabins. We headquartered out of the first cabin we were shown, and that's where the older guys set up. After loading the food and beer into that cabin we walked down to our second cabin, that for some reason was separated by at least three other empty cabins between our two cabins. It wasn't great, but wasn't horrible either. Plenty big for the three of us that would be staying there. Not bad at all. We found out that there was only one other party at camp that week. Odd for prime season. Should have seen that as a warning.Right outside the lodge owners house was a sawhorse set up with several motors hanging from it. The owner grabs one of the motors and takes it down the hill to the lake and sets it on one of the boats and tells us that's our boat. Didn't look like a new motor to me. Still, not that big of a deal.Since it was late we didn't go out fishing that first day which was a bit of a disappointment. So we ate dinner, had some cocktails and played some cards. It seemed like things were going to turn out OK after all.We called it a night and us youngsters headed to our cabin for some sleep. There were only 3 of us, but there were 8 beds to choose from. All of the double beds were not in real good shape. They were pretty old and lumpy and all were worn flat on the side where you would exit the bed and sit on it to tie your shoes, etc. So I figured I'd just take one of the top bunks because they are usually the least desirable beds and therefore probably in the best shape. I hopped up in the bed and laid down and promptly disappeared from sight as the bed sunk so deep because it had no visible means of support. My two buddies howled like a couple of drunken coyotes at my plight. Scratch the top bunk.The next morning, bright and early, we headed out to fish. Walleye fishing was pretty darn good. Nothing huge, but plenty of fish. The motor however, was not so good. It had a tendency to stall at any time. That afternoon we told the lodge owner of our problems with the motor. He hauled it off the boat, up the hill to the saw horse and starts the motor and starts tinkering with the carburetor adjustments...all without the benefit of water cooling the engine and the water pump. That's when I started getting a bad feeling.The next day things started to get interesting. Apparently the owner had a side job and wouldn't be there, and his wife had to head off to town to go to some type of moose hunting class. So we were left to our own devices. Well, everyone hits the water but us younguns. We were a bit late as we were all nursing hangovers from the previous nights card game. So eventually off we go for more of the great walleye fishing. About 10 minutes from the dock our motor dies. I wasn't overly concerned because it restarted every other time. But remember the lodge owner fixed the motor? Yeah right. We eventually drifted to a sandbar and had to walk through shin deep water to get to shore. And there we sat for a solid 6 hours waiting for another boat to come by. The bear and moose tracks along that shoreline made for an interesting wait though.Finally the boat from the only other guests at the cabin happened by and towed us back in. By the time the lady owner got back to get us a new motor our day was shot.When it was time to leave we decided that rather than haul all of our gear back up that hill, we would fly out. Another extra expense, but none of us had ever been on a float plane up to that point, so it was another unique experience.I could go on and on about other things, but you get the idea. Never went back to that place and I heard they went out of business that year. Not surprised.There are only two of us left from that trip and I can tell you that we rehash that trip every year we are on our annual Canada trip. It is probably the most memorable of all of the trips we've taken. It's odd, but I seem to have the most recollection of all of the incidents from that trip than any other I've ever been on. And it's not a bad thing. We tell each other the same stories and laugh just as much now as we did those many many years ago. It's all what you make of it I suppose."
4365945,v-bay gord,2015-12-08 14:00:00,3168,"Hey Bakefish...great story and the sentiment is right on. What makes some things memorable aren't always the 100 fish days that seem to be so important.......and you're right, Little Norway Camp is what is now referred to as Vermilion Bay Lodge."
4366369,Pooch,2015-12-08 18:54:00,4619,"Because of forums like WC ""bad"" camps can't last too long. That said these online forums can also be a place to slam a camp with and sometimes without good a legit reason. The upside is that others can defend the camp if they feel the camp has been wrongly slammed.Camps are just usually small one family operations and somedays (like any business) anything that can go wrong probably will sooner or later. When that happens, just roll with it. No business owner wants an unhappy customer. I've been in camp when one cabin is just a pain in the butt for the camp owner and other guests. Don't be that turd.Pooch"

4368105,Obabikon,2015-12-09 16:00:00,2370,"Rundown places are only a bad experience if you were expecting a nice place. Some of the best times of my life were being trapped in a cabin, playing cards... and having pots all over the place to catch the water from a leaking roof. We were just waiting long enough to get back out there and fish!!! As some have already mentioned. The worst experiences can bring back the most laughs!!! Enjoy every second up there..."

4368809,Guest,2015-12-09 21:37:00,0,"I'm afraid your outfitter is right. I just looked over the 2015 and 2016 calendar. Folks may have forgot about the calendar shift for 2016 and its also a leap year. Opening weekend is always the 3rd Saturday in May. Well is the Sioux Lookout area. The 3rd Saturday in May 2015 was May 16th. Next year in 2016, opener is May 21st. That would mean for guys like our group, who was booked for opener in 2015, would not get opener in 2016 because we would be a week to early. There would be alot of upset groups out there who would miss out if the outfitters stuck to the date of the month rather than the week of the year for 2016. We have our opener secured, for 10 years now. You will get your May 29th date back again, once the calendar shifts from year to year."

4374009,yoopertrout,2015-12-12 16:05:00,1172,"I've had mostly good luck. I don't mind rustic - don't need a shower or running water (although they are nice), because I spend almost every weekend at my own cabin in Michigan which has neither. What I do need is clean. I have asthma and I'm allergic to mold. Can't stay in musty places. I stayed at a cabin on a trout stream in Montana owned by a well known fly shop. It was fine, except for no screens in the bedroom windows. It was hard to read in bed with sizzling moths falling in my face. :-/I went to one drive in lodge in Canada that advertised big brook trout. We got almost no brook trout in two trips, and two other groups that went at different times had the same luck. Northern and walleye fishing was fair. The cabins were clean and the food was good. The lodge advertised stash boats at other lakes, but only seemed to have one. The website continues to have the same old photos of the same people (including at least one relative of the owner) with dead brook trout. Some of the pictures didn't look like they were even taken on the lake/river the lodge is on, and the owner confided in me that one trout/river photo was from a different river miles away. I really think he and his family hammered the brook trout when the lodge first opened. I don't want to pay good money to fish in water that was good until the owner stuffed his freezer. Last trip was to one of Kabeelo's lakes, and we loved it enough that we are going again next summer - great fishing, clean cabins, and the owners have the business down to a science. Can't wait to get there!So, I guess the three things I demand are: 1. Cleanliness; 2. Window screens; 3. Conservation oriented rules.But, most of my trips have been really good. Make take is that Ontario offers some of the best value in quality fishing anywhere in the world, and the people are very nice. Many of the other Canadian provinces seem to have much higher prices."
4367369,tv4fish,2015-12-09 10:09:00,2694,Yeah - Some of us would hate to deprive you of that...............
4367449,MrSimon,2015-12-09 10:39:00,922,"I feel like in this day and age, it's pretty easy to do your homework on a lodge. Before I drive 20 hours each way and drop almost $2k, I do the following:Search the web for reviews - read forums, check Facebook, ask questions in WC etc etcWatch videos on YouTubeCall the owner and have a long conversationTrack down folks who have been recently and call them tooSpend a lot of time looking at maps and on Google EarthCross reference things by doing research on all the lodges in the area Sure, it takes a month or so of web time, emails, and phone calls .... but we've never had a bad trip. It's worth it! I can't control the weather or the fish ..... but I sure as heck can control where I go, and being well informed goes a LONG way in picking a good place."
4367513,HeHooksHimself,2015-12-09 11:26:00,725,"That is a good point. One person's bad experience may be an adventure to another. Re: the ""is this a trend"" thread where a group of guys went to the camp I mentioned and used that thread to share their bad experience. I know for a fact that they brought some of that on themselves by their expectations and the fact the camp owner let them fend for themselves (something that can be appreciated if done in the right way and right spirit) and did not coddle them. I don't know anyone else that has had a bad experience there. We go consistently to the same place in the spring and ""shop around"" a little more in the fall. I can honestly say, in spite of mediocre fishing, camps in disrepair, bugs, critters, whatever, that I have never had a bad experience. For me, there is much more to Canadian fishing trips than the fishing. In my office is the Aldo Leopold quote, ""there are some that can live without wild things and some that can not."""
4367625,wallydave,2015-12-09 12:19:00,2151,"There is one camp Ill never go to again, rude staff poor cabin nothing seemed to be repaired on a timely basis. But the group came together and we made the best of it! Some of the stories from that trip still bring back good memories! As many have said the fishing is not the only reason to fishing! We do want to catch plenty of fish but making memories that we can treasure is the deal for me!"
4367681,jabecker,2015-12-09 12:44:00,118,For Michigan Walleye Guy There is a new resort that just opened up on Wintering Lake in the last 2 years. Can't remember the name off hand . Drove by it when I went to Press Lake resort last year.
4367761,"6'3""",2015-12-09 13:33:00,47,"Years ago our group always went on our annual fishing trip in May. We stayed in Hornepayne and always drove to a different lake every day. We soon figured out that it must have been quite a run off during spring thaw and that we were the first ones using those particular bush roads since the thaw. We had 6 pickups full of eager fishermen but had to stop in quite a few valleys to ""rebuild"" the road. We would haul logs and brush and a few had shovels. We tossed a lot of rocks into holes and VERY carefully crawled over some nasty spots. It was actually a little dangerous plus we had to cross back after a day of fishing. We did lose some fishing time and did some grumbling about it but deep down it added something to our trip and yet today we talk more about that trip than most others that we have taken"
4367809,Mr. Sauger,2015-12-09 13:55:00,285,"Been going to Canadian cabins (drive to and fly in) for 30 years. Probably go for 30 more despite the surprises/disappointments along the way. Pre-pay? – no way.Our first fly-in was fantastic.Enjoyed the Canadian experience and had the best fishing of our lives. In retrospect the cabin was a dump.I had forts as a kid that were more accommodating. Cabin had no running water so we had to haul 5 gallon buckets uphill to the cabin and then drop bleach in it. Stovetop burner was so lame we mostly cooked on an open fire outside. Boats leaked.Mattresses on a 2x4/plywood bed were kinda gross. The only furniture was a wooden picnic table (no backrest). Sales presentation at the outdoors show might have been a bit misleading (think of Mr. Haney on Green Acres). We didn’t know what we were missing yet had the time of our lives. Fondly remembered that trip but found better outposts in future years. By the way - this outfitter is long gone.Booked the next 5 trips with a new outfitter visiting 2 of his 5 remotes. Wanted to try something different so we selected outpost #3 with him for the next trip. However, he sold that outpost to another outfitter 2 weeks before our trip. This was nowhere as nice as the previous remotes. Boats were swamped upon arrival.We carried tools in the boat to keep the outboards running. Floating dock was damaged so only one person could be on it at a time before it sank. Propane fridge/freezer could not make ice (others did). That was back in the day we packed a cooler of iced beer in the boat. Doors wouldn’t close.He advertised a solar shower which was a plywood outhouse listing hard to port.It was way too rickety to approach.Red Green would have condemned this place.Didn’t mind the shower surprise, but don’t plague me with mosquitos, warm beer and finicky outboards. New outfitter had bought it sight unseen. Bad blood between the buyer and seller. Buyer was having trouble collecting our deposit from the seller. Too bad, we were happy with old outfitter till we got caught in the crossfire.Another year another outfitter. Cabin looked nice yet one room had settled lower than the rest of the floor.Instead of making a step or ramp, they covered the 10” rounded slope with linoleum. Looked like a basketball under a carpet. The second sink never had plumbing installed – not even a j trap. We’d laugh when someone forgot and poured something in that sink (resulting in wet feet and a mess on the floor). We were more amused than disappointed and had a good trip. Come Saturday we packed up our gear and waited on the dock for the 9:00 AM float plane pickup. Extra food was tossed and all gear packed a as instructed. Plane did not arrive until 4:00 PM due to dropping off a load of plywood off at another location. Outfitter gave a free hat but no apology. AMF His outfit is no longer around either.Recent trips to Fishermans Cove at Lac Seul have been fantastic.What a great operation – they have their act together."
4367977,Bakefish,2015-12-09 15:02:00,1077,One time we stayed in a cabin that wasn't exactly level...not even close. The place was a bundle of laughs after a few cocktails.
4368001,123chadder,2015-12-09 15:18:00,429,"i had an issue this week with an outfitter,as soon as we got off the plane last year we rebooked the same week for 2016,in 2015 it was may 29th-june 5th,2016 trip is may 27th-june 3rd,i booked last year as soon as we got back to the air base and then put the dates on my phone,friends of ours go the week after us and booked for june 3rd-10th well i called last week to dicuss a few things with the outfitter and found out i was booked for june 3rd-10th...we argued for a bit,but i was adament i had the dates right...so i call buddy that goes in after us andche confirms his date is june 3rd our group ended up biting the bullet and took may 20th-may 27th(thank god it wasnt booked!) and our friends got to keep the 3rd-10th of june,there is a first group thats been going for 15 years and i think they got our date my bugaboo is what happened if we just showed up,two groups would have been screwed and i would have snapped!thank god the outfitters mistake didnt cost us our trip and a bunch of extra money"
4368081,Mike Borger,2015-12-09 15:44:00,1554,"Overall in my experience Dan is a solid guy, sometimes stuff just happens. I think that's a way better week anyway for the lake you're fishing. Supposed to be a mild winter this year, you'll be fine."
4366921,Sportdog,2015-12-09 07:12:00,6735,"My story did not not take place in Canada (I know, why am I posting then on the Canada forum) but in Northern Michigan. We stayed at a place that some guys from my hometown just raved about and how they went there every year. Well, my fishing partner and I didn't care for it!!! Launch site for the boat was down a huge steep hill with little room for error and the brakes wouldn't even hold at times. Pretty scary, as you can imagine. The cabin looked OK but had an odor that I cannot describe and even with the windows opened it was bad. The place had mouse poop all over and at night you could hear them running around the walls and ceiling. What little sleep we got was with all the lights on to discourage the mice. To top it off the fishing was pretty poor and an under water log put a nice dent in the front of my then brand new boat. Yeah, that place sucked real bad. Lol!!!"
4367081,tv4fish,2015-12-09 08:46:00,2694,"Sport: Your ""experience"" sounds very similar to one that my group had, AND it was in Canada. Good old ""rustic Cabin No. 5"" (I'm not going to name the resort, as it happened a few years ago, and I sure hope the Owners improved it since then). But, we had the same mice scenario - crawling all over the cabin - getting into bags of chips, etc. The generator for the VIP cabin on the site was running all night, the weather for the entire week was rainy, fish weren't biting - the entire trip sucked. If you're guessing we have never been back - you are correct."
4367121,Bill Krejca,2015-12-09 09:00:00,6107,"Interesting story. In trying to make the most of a bad situation, perhaps the moral of the story is to appreciate the many times at the camps that do it right. As in most situations, good stuff doesn't just happen by chance - it happens because the folks there care and understand the needs of those they are serving. Being a country music fan, I occasionally tend to remember the Loretta Lynn song, ""You Never Miss The Water 'til The Well Runs Dry"". Appreciate the water! Bill"
4367137,michigan walleye guy,2015-12-09 09:00:00,95,"In 1984, I was a freshly-minted college graduate, and, to celebrate, went along on a trip to Wintering Lake on Hwy. 599 with some other guys from my hometown. The camp's name was Fisherman's Camp, and run by an older gent named John. It was a drive-to lake, and it was my first experience in Canada. The fishing was very good, but, the accommodations not so much. When somebody flushed the toilet, you could see the septic field bubbling off in the distance, and you sure could smell it. Ovens and stoves were either temperamental at best, or didn't work at all. Mice were constant companions, and the flooring in the cabin was buckled and not exactly level. But--I did go back for several years, because for about $125 per week, we had access to some great Canadian fishing, and after all, we were there for the fishing. We wised up and soon learned to bring our own boats and motors, and so quickly learned just to appreciate the place as a bit of heaven on earth. I do know the camp is not open any more, but I sure would like to hear if anybody has fished Wintering Lake lately. And, as I remember, the best part of the trip was the midnight fish fries--at that age, I sure could pack it away, and be back up at 5 a.m. for more. Someday, I hope to go back, if for nothing else than a sentimental journey."
4367241,AllenW,2015-12-09 09:32:00,11482,I want to thank all those who had a bad experience and failed to mention where. Otherwise I wouldn't have the chance to experience that same lousy time myself. Al
4367337,Bakefish,2015-12-09 09:59:00,1077,"In my case, there's no need to mention the name of the lodge because it is under different ownership and doing just fine. There's no need to bring a name of a lodge into something that happened 30 or so years ago. The current owners had nothing to do with the situation I faced then."
