4374361,Baseline,2015-12-12 20:06:00,3207,We were fishing Crow Lake out of Nestor Falls early in the season. There was about 8 inches of ice. We were jigging for trout when a pressure ridge blew up about 10 feet behind us. It shook the ice and sloshed water out of our hole. I just about had a heart attack over that on. We decided to get out of there.
4374449,WallyWarrior,2015-12-12 20:43:00,2488,I did the exact same thing as the video. I believe there was 6 or more inches of ice when I did it. Definitely gets you movin. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

This winter has broken all previous records for the mild temps. *** I type there is still green grass visible on my lawn…I have been here 9 years and never seen that."
