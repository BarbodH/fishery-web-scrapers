We were set for our trip in June 2016, and had the usual 12:30pm arrival to International Falls. Once we get our bags, we hire a taxi and make our way to the outfitter by mid afternoon or so, fly out to the outpost early next morning. We have done this same routine last 5 or 6 years. Got an email week of Thanksgiving that the 12:30 flight was cancelled and now we arrive at 10:00pm. We will just stay in Int Falls and leave early next morning for the outfitter so no worries about that part, just curious if anyone else has had same issue. Delta was really helpful getting everyone rescheduled, I just have no idea why that flight was cancelled as it was always full (at least in fishing season!)."

Most likely the problem is no pilots available for the regional jets. Delta has had a couple of ""contract"" companies unable to fulfill their contracts due to lack of crews. Believe it or not the this is likiely to get worse for the smaller airports for the next 5-7 years. Glad you could make other arrangements. Good luck. Tx Jig Tyr"
4360113,Camoclad,2015-12-05 14:25:00,628,"Thanks Tx that would explain the change, it was just a bit of a surprise to us since the last several years were fairly predictable. Ideally, in several years, retirement will take the domestic flight out of the equation all together, then we can drive and fish our way there and back!"
4360409,rzep,2015-12-05 17:29:00,1196,"AA did similar to me on Chicago to Miami flight in couple weeks... I called and complained and ended up with better flight schedule than original.... My feeling is that when you book in advance, there are many flight options which later get consolidated if plans do not get filed."
4360433,Camoclad,2015-12-05 17:44:00,628,"True, there were a lot of options for us going Atlanta to Minneapolis but only 2 to Int Falls. They had 5 of us on three different flights from Atlanta with various stops (Washington DC, Detroit, etc). I called too, and they put us all on a direct flight, so that was good. I will say I was dreading the call to get it worked out and the customer service rep was very helpful."
4360553,Golden Eagle,2015-12-05 19:18:00,2642,"A call to a travel agency in International Falls, MN might give you an edge. I've had success working with the travel agent in Red Lake, Ontario. Karen Veal knows all the deals and tricks for flying round trip to Red Lake. A travel agency might have a few discounts to work with. Nice discounts."
4360969,Camoclad,2015-12-06 05:42:00,628,"Thanks Golden Eagle, that may be what we need to do in the future. I know I wouldn't mind letting someone else handle the details!"
