4348402,Sportdog,2015-11-29 23:24:00,6735,"If you were to choose the best time for numbers of Smallmouth on Canadian Shield Lakes, what would it be. I have been doing some on-line reading and I'm seeing everything from the first week of June to the middle of July. As my previous post on this board states we will be going for two weeks. Priorities are #1 Smallmouth, #2 Walleye (eaters preferred) and #3 Northern Pike. I fish smallmouth quite a bit around home but it's a river fishery and I have almost zero experience targeting them in a lake. In the river we fish current breaks and rip rap shorelines with shallow running fat body crank baits and tube jigs (until I grow tired of snagging. ) What type of cover/areas are good on these shield lakes during what particular time of year. Thanks much for the continued help guys."
4348426,Pooch,2015-11-30 02:28:00,4619,"We fish out of Mahkwa on Lac Seul from mid August until Labor Day and while not targeting Smallmouth seem to catch them while fishing for walleye. Mostly jigging plastic or live bait so we are on or near the bottom. Also, catch them (probably more) while trolling spinners for walleye.I know that when we are most likely to pickup incidental smallies is when we are near rock and rubble areas. I've also learned that I catch more smallies intentionally by fishing deeper. Time of year? I don't know. We sometimes stop and fish Little Vermilion (south of Sioux Lookout in the Provincial Park) and the guys that got me started in that area would drive the shoreline and throw anything with limited success. When I started to take my own boat I was always marking fish on the bottom. Dropped a BB and spinner down and caught the crap out of smallmouth while the others were just picking up an occasional fish working shore and shallow rocky areas. Guess where they now fish?Take a few minutes sometime to look at my photos here on WC and in the smallie pictures, look at the back ground in the pictures.I also fish late June out of Lac Seul Lodge and I have yet to catch more that a couple accidental smallmouth in that part of the lake. Though others tell me they have done OK there. Again, fishing away from the shoreline for walleye.I think smallmouth are everywhere, but like most fish prefer rocks or weeds for crayfish and minnow forage when available.Makes sense to fish rocky shorelines, but that's not where I catch the most. As long as rocks are there or close, whatever depth we are marking fish. Walleye or smallmouth. They seem to share the same habitat.Curious to see how it goes on your two week trip. I'm envious....Pooch"
4348705,Bill Krejca,2015-11-30 08:13:00,6107,"A number of factors can be involved in the decision on when to go. On LOW, which I have fished for a very long time ,anywhere from late May through Mid July can be good for shallow water bite. It depends on how fast the water warms in the particular part of the lake you are fishing. Prespawn, and spawn bass are normally in fairly shallow/readily accessible water at this time. I wouldn't be real concerned about catching them during spawn in most lakes, the fish seem to almost overrun a body of water after being established there. Smallmouth were stocked in LOW around 1926, for example, and they are everywhere there now. Rock bottoms can be very good, I prefer football size rocks. Also, small, small bays - just a few feet wide, is an area that one or two will hang out in. Light crappie jigs/rigs can work well. For fun, the use of surface baits can provide some outstanding action, plus maybe a few other surprises. Rather than reeling in at athletic warp speed, like as shown on the TV shows, I prefer a ssllooww retrieve with plenty of pauses - extreme finesse on the surface, if you will. Finally, for something different, I used to really enjoy wading the shallows with a flyrod and surface floaters/poppers. It is rare to see this in north woods country, but can really be a ball. Wear subtle colored clothing, not best color-for-TV colors, keep movement to a minimum and then move slowly. Have fun! Bill"
4348937,Thompmd,2015-11-30 10:42:00,320,"On the trips I take to Canada I have always had smallmouth as my #1 target, followed by whatever. Best time, IMO June for sure. I have only went for 1-week and I have went the 1st to last week in June and timing is big BUT your going for 2-weeks so your almost certain to catch the peak. Personally, if I had 2-weeks I would choose early in the month as pre-spawn fish are much easier to catch than in the post spawn funk + northern fishing is better and walleye are easy either way. small rock as mentioned, I would personally start out on main lake point(s) then continue to move shallow depending on where you find groups of fish. I also think its really important to note that until fish lock onto beds they are like ghosts meaning its not unusual to catch 10-20-30 on a shoreline then go back and they are gone. I would continue to move. I have done well on rock and wood if its available but not so much in weeds. Baits: personally I stay away from jigs/grubs on the bottom only because they want to hang up in the rocks but don't hesitate to swim them just keep them moving. I love little white spinnerbaits(5/16oz), chartreuse grub and #3.5 hammered nickel blade. Don't hesitate to throw crawdad colored rattle traps(1/4 & 1/2oz and actually 3/4 if you already have them). crawdad colored crankbaits that run to 10-12' bounced in the rocks. I like the tiny torpedo in a frog color. I have also had good luck on white senkos at times. I never use a leader on anything(yes you will get bitten off a few times during the week) and one of the best things is these same lures will catch about anything. Time of day or conditions didn't seem to be a big deal, just fish the conditions(ex spinnerbait on windy shorelines). Not sure where your going but in general the clearer the water, the faster you move your lures and the further you need to cast. dirtier water or wind you can stay closer. Bright calm days, faster/further. sorry to ramble, good luck and 2-weeks, I'm jealous. Find broken rocks, keep moving and you will run into them."
4348977,Aaron-IN,2015-11-30 11:05:00,500,"I am a self proclaimed smallmouth fishing crazy person and have been targeting them in NW Ontario going on 30+ years now. I've been keeping records with regards to ice out, weather, water temps etc, etc, etc for about the past 20 years. In my opinion (I base my annual trips around this) if you can get on your respective fishery approximately 37 days after ice out you will be in that ""sweet spot"" of the spring fishing. Disclaimer, I have been fishing the same body of water now for over 30 years so what works for me might not work for you.Also wanted to add that I always target the spawn making sure to quickly release them back. Senkos, #2 Blue Fox minnow spinners, and torpedos are all you need.Good luck on your trip."
4349177,Limeyangler,2015-11-30 13:04:00,563,"I'd have to agree with a lot of what has been said so far. I would say for me spring is the best time simply because I know where they are, shallow. Like the others have said football sized rocks are a sure thing for me also, especially if it is a south facing shore. late september is also great as they really have the feedbag on, but I find them harder to find, but once you do OH BOY! I use topwater poppers, Mepps spinners, jigs and minnows (gulp works fine) and slip bobbers. Cant go wrong in spring .Mid April to end of June ( the April dates obviously depending on ice out) I have been fishing them here for about 6 or 7 years now and have a few videos of the action that I have recorded. Here s the link, I made a compilation playlist of some of my spring bass adventures ENJOY!https://www.youtube.com/playlist?lis...DoqniN7_hkDURt"
4353841,north560,2015-12-02 19:11:00,53,"We have some guys come the week before opening of walleye. This year will be May 14 2016, they always clean up on some great small mouth fishing lots of 3-4 lb but some really nice 5-6 lb.Some time they split the week so that they can fish for the walleye. Mind you bring warm clothes, the last year they came we had to cut a path to return to the dock as the wind shifted and filled the bay with ice. Heres a picture of what can be caught at Gowbushkon.This year looks like the last two weeks of May should be good."
4356841,Sportdog,2015-12-04 07:05:00,6735,"Well the deposit is in the mail for two weeks, May 28 thru June 11. Can't wait until spring. Thanks to everyone for all the helpful information. I will report how the trip went when I return."
4357713,Bill Krejca,2015-12-04 13:54:00,6107,North - That is an absolutely beautiful bass. Just simply outstanding in markings and coloration! Bill
4358001,Hawker,2015-12-04 16:19:00,3967,"Soooo, where ya goin SD?? We ALL wanna know!!"
4358145,Paul H,2015-12-04 17:01:00,1232,"Proud to say - I know where you mean - the back likes are even better as are seem others in the area. Seemingly, few fish for the brown fish up there. I'd guess a little more since one of the major tournaments hits the lake now. (if they still do or not)."
4358593,Sportdog,2015-12-04 19:52:00,6735,"Happy Day Lodge, near Champleau, Ontario. Drive to location, very reasonable rates, my conversation with Sondra Zimmerman, co-owner of the lodge, impressed me very much. The lake has a good reputation and I feel that we will enjoy our stay. By reputation that I have garnered this Algoma area is not as good as NW Ontarion but it is much closer (by about 350 miles one way), cabins are all on the water, and the bass and pike grow large with a healthy whitefish population. I'm stoked!!!"
4359065,kzoofisher,2015-12-05 05:58:00,5144,"Big fan of HDL here. I go at the end of August and fish the opposite side from the lodge but I can tell you that when we target boulder flats we get plenty of smallmouth and some big ones. Same gear we use around here, casting jigs primarily because of bite offs. We catch some good size pike every year without even trying and I'm sure we could do better if we focused on them. Jeff got the big pike of the week last year on an 1/8oz jig and twister tail. Early in the season it should be pretty easy to find gravel flats with breaks to deep water nearby, if the flat holds smaller males the sows will be in the deeper water staging. Blade baits, tubes and paddle tails fished down the break is what works for me in the Traverse area, probably works for you too. The portage lakes have earned their reputation as smallmouth lakes, especially Goldie, but Kathleen is significantly easier to get to an will still produce a few dozen 14""-19"" fish. Well worth doing a day trip or two if you are there two weeks. Early in the year the walleye are on the lodge side for spawning. I imagine you'll have quite a mixed bag most days. The Zimmerman's are great people as you noticed. Best piece of advice I got for the lake came from MrSimon on this site; there is structure everywhere on the lake so note the details of it when you catch fish and you can develop a pattern quickly. First year we found that long points always held fish and the shorter ones (<50 yards) didn't. We skipped anything that dropped to 14' faster than that and had a milk route of spots in no time. Good luck and I look forward to you reports."
4365865,MrSimon,2015-12-08 13:20:00,922,"Yup, I personally think Windermere's smallie fishing is better than it's walleye fishing ..... and the walleye fishing is pretty good, so that's saying something. There is enough hilariously good smallie structure on Windermere to keep a guy busy for a lifetime. You just have to cover water quickly and efficiently to locate the fish, then dial in your pattern and get ready for sore thumbs. Last time I was there I took two buddies who had never been to Canada. They got into a rocky bay with a heavy wind blowing in .... it was insane bass fishing on x-raps for hours. Truly something special. I hope you guys have a great time and look forward to seeing pictures and hearing stories."
4350385,BornToFish,2015-12-01 07:10:00,1224,"I agree with the comments already posted on this thread. However, I will put a slightly different spin on things. I suggest that lake selection might be more important than time of season. Someone wanting to target smallies needs to pick a good lake that is filled with smallies. Once the lake is chosen, the angler can then be fairly confident that the fish will still be in the lake somewhere and that they will eat from time to time. This will go on throughout the entire open water season. The angler is then confronted with the seasonal movements of the fish. These seasonal movements in turn govern the strategies and techniques that will work best at any given point in time. I catch about as many smallies in late May as I do in early July or in September. The strategies and techniques that I use to target smallies changes throughout the season, as the type of water holding fish changes. Thus, the ""best"" time of the year to catch smallies may actually reside in how you like to fish. Do you prefer to cast crankbaits or do you prefer to fish slip bobbers? Remember: the fish will be there and will be eating. How do you want to go after them? In my opinion, it's awfully difficult to pass up an opportunity to cast top-water lures during early July on a shoreline with chunk rock and trees overhanging the water! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4350513,bob888,2015-12-01 08:01:00,244,"For twenty years I've not missed fishing at least one week on Lake of the Woods. Our group fishes almost exclusively for smallies primarily in the first or second week of June. We prefer the second week as it seems the weather conditions are better. No doubt, the first or second week of June is far better than our trips in July and August. The primary baits used (in order of use) are 4"" tubes (not the thin ones), crank baits from shallow runners (1-2' in depth) to deeper cranks. And occasionally, a very lightly weighted (1/32 oz or no weight) on a 5"" soft stick bait. Also will use a spinner bait or a chatter bait if nothing else seems to work . Often areas that we are taking fish in 1-3' of water will also be deeper. If so, the guy in the front of the boat casts ahead with a crank. In the early years on Woods fished a jig with a plastic trailer and had good success. The problem with that lure is they tend to snag easily in the rocks. The 4"" tubes with their larger head compared to a jig avoids snags, and often can swim the bait over the boulders. If the lure does get snagged twanging it off will often get the lure back. We fish tubes with an open 1/8, up to 5/16 oz jig hook inside the tube. And just as often we fish 4"" tubes with an 4/0 EWG hook texposed with an inside weight if we are dropping the bait a lot. If we are pitching tubes to large boulders we pitch behind the bolder and craw the bait over the bolder and drop it. Also, big slab that have cracks in them can hold a smallie in them. After thought--95% of the time we use bait casting rods with 12 or 14# test fluorescent monofilament line."
4351969,Hawker,2015-12-01 21:02:00,3967,"All great info so far! I've been going to that little place I recommended to you for the past 23 years, and with the exception of ""this"" year, have always been there the last week of May/first week of June. Yes, there have been one or two years that due to cold weather hanging on, the smallie bite wasn't top notch and slower than normal, but by and large it is PRIME time for us. Like others have said, football-baskteball size rocky shorelines south facing are usually loaded up with smallmouth. I rarely use anything other than a 3"" Berkley Power Tube in either Camo or Smoke color (perfect color match for the resident crawfish at that time of year. I prefer an 1/8th oz darter head jig inserted inside the tube with only the hook itself protruding from the midst of the tube tentacles. When conditions are right for a topwater bite, a 1/4 Pop-R tossed close close close to shoreline and worked slow will produce some fabulous topwater action. Excellent Walleye and Pike waters very close by as well. The same place also has a fly-in camp (10 minute flight) to Kish which holds loads and loads of BIG smallouth. Only ""bad"" (haha) thing about fishing Kish for smallmouth is you'll also be doing battle on more Muskies than you will believe. Actually the bad part about Kish is that it primarily holds only smallies, muskies and lake trout. One might find a place on the lake that holds crappie (so I've been told) but I've only caught the 3 species listed there. Best day there for smallies was 200 plus smallies (2 people) and dozens of muskies! Only fished the lake trout there thru the ice, but it holds them in the 20+ lb range."
4353105,MrSimon,2015-12-02 14:59:00,922,"I've had excellent smallie fishing in Canada in June, July, August, and September. And I've found them shallow in all those months. Someone said it above, but the most important factor is the lake. I couldn't agree more!!! Once you pick the right lake, the next most important thing is your ability to find them. I think time of year is actually pretty low on the list."
