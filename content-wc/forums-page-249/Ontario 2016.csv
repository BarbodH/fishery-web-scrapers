4294466,Babamel2,2015-10-31 11:19:00,414,"I feel sorry for people whose primary criteria for selecting a camp is based on which currency is the base for charging. I feel there is so much more to life than evaluating vacation decisions primarily on dollars and cents. Most of us have already spent thousands and thousands of dollars on boats, motors, electronics, fishing rods, reels and tackle, then we complain about the difference in exchange rates of the two currencies."
4296266,bthomas3333,2015-11-01 08:58:00,465,------------ Yeah I would think things like the quality of the fishing / accommodations / services would matter more than who takes the currency risk. Yes. It is a risk too. For all of us American that are questing lodges charging CAD rates you are shifting the price risk for your trip from the lodge owner to your own pocketbook. We have 7-10 months before 2016 trips and a lot can happen in the meantime. When an American is charged in USD you are locked in the price and the lodge owner is taking the risk rates will change. When an American is paying CAD in 9 months he is taking the risk on how much his/her trip will cost. Just saying make sure you know what you are doing. Rates are VERY good right now. Who knows in 9 months. BTW...to the comment about interest rate changes by the US FED or CAD Monetary Policy group. If federal rates are raised it tends to bring in investments from external countries. This tends to make the given currency more valuable and the rate vs other currency goes up. AKA if you can get a better rate of return in CAD it will move the exchange rate vs USD up. All those CAD prices wouldn't look quite so good. Of course if the US Fed rates rates they could look even better by next summer. Whatever...still can't believe this is a primary concern. B-
4296554,Downrigger,2015-11-01 12:04:00,60,"Just my 2 cents. There are many great lakes to fish in NW On., and each has some outstanding lodge owners. Everything being equal, once a lake is decided upon why not take advantage of an existing exchange advantage. I have made my reservation for 2016. I have a Canadian bank account and have already transferred funds toward my stay. With that transfer I gained slightly over $500 Canadian, not a small sum. Had the exchange rate been 1:1 I would still be going, so I don't think it is necessarily the deciding factor, but this will pay for some of that fuel and/or a nice dinner at the lodge. Should I have to cancel the trip, I can always transfer the funds back to the US account - at the then existing exchange rate."
4300858,Obabikon,2015-11-03 19:48:00,2370,"Since its the offseason for me at this point... I can stir the pot again. I don't see what the issue with the ""exchange rate"" is at all. You can stay at a resort for... $1000 US or $1300 Canadian Right now, those are the exact same value. If $1000 US or $1300 Canadian is too much for that resort... then the resort is over charging. If it is an amazing super deal... the resort is under charging. The idea is to find a resort that is the best ""value"", right? Resort ""A"" charges in Canadian dollars: Includes: meals, lodging, deluxe boat, island resort (all the bells and whistles) Resort ""B"" charges in US dollars: Includes: meals, lodging, deluxe boat, island resort (all the bells and whistles) If resort ""B"" charges $900 US and resort ""A"" charges $1300 Canadian... the US one is the better deal. Obviously, if they charge the exact same dollar amount... the Canadian charging resort would be a much better deal. However, that's not really the case. There are SO many variables, it just isn't something that is comparable. The only thing people can do is figure out the price, and decide if that resort holds high or low value for them. (each person will have a different opinion on what's valuable). Each resort is different, and has different costs. Another point that has been brought up, if you're booking at a resort that charges in Canadian, I'd suggest transferring money now. The exchange probably isn't going to get any better. If it drops to $1.10-$1.20... you could end up paying nearly 10% more than you would have otherwise. Take advantage of the exchange ASAP and lock in those rates! I guess my point is... decide if what works best for you, for the price you feel good about."
4301146,Shellback,2015-11-04 06:22:00,8083,"Five or ten percent, wouldn't have me looking for another lodge. But we are talking about thirty percent now. I'm not retired comfortably now by leaving 20 to 25 % on the table on purchases thruout my life."
4301170,bthomas3333,2015-11-04 06:54:00,465,"Agreed! #1. Choose the best value for you #2. If you have access to a CAD bank account transfer money now and lock in the excellent rate. #3. If you don't have access to a CAD account and you feel comfortable paying 100% upfront ask the lodge owner if you can pay upfront and pay now. The only argument I have had is when folks are making plans right now based on the future exchange rate when we are talking 8+ months out. I really don't think I would want to gamble 10-30% prince increase on whether the rate will stay this good. B- Another point that has been brought up, if you're booking at a resort that charges in Canadian, I'd suggest transferring money now. The exchange probably isn't going to get any better.

4301394,Mark R,2015-11-04 08:59:00,1538,I see on the internet the exchange rate is $1.00 US get $1.31 Canadian. I go to my local Wells Fargo and they will give me only $1.20 Are they gouging me? Where do you make your exchanges?
4301442,Fisherman Ted,2015-11-04 09:17:00,461,"Ahhhh yes, you have stumbled upon the fun part. What you see on-line is a spot-rate and is almost never given to the local consumer. Those rates are given to companies and big-time traders trading 6 figures if not significantly more. The average Joe will never get close to that rate. So if you are going to go that route and try to compare apples to oranges across different currencies you need to determine what YOU will be getting for a rate first. If you don't do your homework you will be mightily disappointed! As a lodge owner we have more leverage and hence better rates (which will be very close to the spot rate if you are savvy to the business and know where to look). But again, not so for someone exchanging money both infrequently and in very small amounts. Not small to you of course, but insignificant to the global marketplace. The rate the banks charge are incredibly low, especially American banks. First off is try a Canadian bank that does many of these transactions (as compared to their American counterparts) and usually are much more competitive. As someone also said I would also call your credit card company as they are global and deal with billions of dollars and these types of transactions all the time. They often times can give you a pretty good rate (you being the consumer). There are also companies out there that specialize in helping out the consumer's inability to trade currencies like the big boys and can offer extremely competitive rates. One which is very popular now is http://www.knightsbridgefx.com. They really help the little guys. And while they do tier their rates based on transaction size and frequency I have found them to be much better than anything most consumers are privy to. And finally I would talk to your lodge directly. They should be getting the best rate available (certainly better than a consumer will be able to get). For example I am able to get a rate .001 % off of the spot rate. A great lodge owner might be able to help you out and give you the best rate you are ever going to see. Hope this helps. -FT"

4362329,billy weaver,2015-12-06 20:42:00,470,"Much has been posted on how we are going to save because of the favorable exchange rate. Not going to happen for most of us. I have checked over twenty websites in the Canadian Sunset Country area. The ones that have posted their 2016 rates are about the same as last year. Only one posted their rates in Canadian funds. I go housekeeping rates so I don't buy much in Canada. I gas up in International Falls and that usually does me as the camp furnishes 15 gal. of gas in my boat. I do eat a couple of meals in Dryden, buy fishing license and minnows at the camp. In summary my cost is going to be close to last year at best."

4308802,Obabikon,2015-11-07 20:31:00,2370,"I have been an owner since 2007. So, I haven't really experience things like $1.47! However, our resort has been (an still is) less expensive than our similar competitors who charge in Canadian dollars. (and our similar competitors who charge in US dollars). EVEN WITH the exchange rate."
4308850,Obabikon,2015-11-07 20:46:00,2370,The reason not to switch is that our customers would be upset. It isn't fair to jump back and forth. It would be HIGHLY unethical (in my opinion) to switch back and forth simply because one year the exchange rate is in favor and the next it isn't. Another reason not to switch is that my largest bill every year (mortgage) is in US funds.
4314530,Baseline,2015-11-11 05:29:00,3207,I have a question about bringing US dollars spent in CA back into the US. Is there a cost for the resort owner to do this? I'm sure a lot of those US dollars get spent in CA for supplies and other equipment necessary for running the resort. How is the exchange rate handled by CA banks?
4314538,Obabikon,2015-11-11 05:39:00,2370,"Cash isn't used as frequently as it was, so I'm not sure what everyone's policy is now. However, when it is received, I would guess that most owners just keep it until the end of the year, or until the next time they go to the US. You actually get a worse exchange rate with physical cash than you do with a check. However, if you're a US citizen, and you legally report the cash going back into the US... you can carry it. (I believe it is now anything over $5000 has to be declared, it used to be $10,000)"
4314570,Fisherman Ted,2015-11-11 06:03:00,461,Actually its simple. We just have accounts (in Canada) in both currencies. No cash needs to go anywhere and there are no exchange issues. We can deposit cash right at the bank with no fees whatsoever. We don't lose money exchanging currencies and when I need to pay myself I write a check out of the USD account.
4317410,MrSimon,2015-11-12 13:30:00,922,"The concept of an exchange rate means nobody is getting gouged. The fact that the exchange rate CHANGES over time simply means income or expenses will either fluctuate or be consistent depending on which side of the transaction you are on. A Canadian lodge who charges fixed rates in US = US customers see consistent pricing, but Canadian guests and the lodge owner will experience volatility. A Canadian lodge who charges fixed rates in CAD = US customers experience price volatility but Canadian guests and the lodge owner see consistency. Each lodge owner has to decide how they want to do business. If they have a ton of US customers, they might be willing to put up with volatile revenue streams to keep their customers' experience consistent from year to year."
4331778,danforth,2015-11-19 23:23:00,117,"Obabikon, it still is $10,000.00, but this is how it works. it all has to be declared. but for anything over $10,000.00 you have to fill out a Fincen form 105 REPORT OF INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORTATION OF CURRENCY OR MONETARY INSTRUMENTS, there is no charge for this but the gov. wants to know what you are doing with that much cash."
4332002,Obabikon,2015-11-20 06:50:00,2370,"Thanks Dan. Only reason I said it might have been changed, was last time I crossed... I was asked if I had $5k. Which caught me off guard, because the question had always been $10k. Either way, I didn't have that much cash... but made me think it might have changed."

4307562,Fisherman Ted,2015-11-07 08:02:00,461,"I am resigned to the fact that consumers will just not get this concept after the like 20 page thread 8 months ago on this same subject. But I and others will keep trying.If I charge in USD yes I take a huge gamble (so you are right on that point!). And that gamble is not with those yearly rates you just quoted. If you want to see the gamble we take please quote the daily rates. Not an average rate. Let's start there. Last summer ended up very strong for the USD. But it ENDED up that way. And my season didn't start at the end of the summer, it started 18 months before that. That's when we set prices. So we had to look into our magic ball and decide where we thought that rate would be 18 months out. If I could do that I would be an investment banker by the way. If by some miracle it goes above my forecast then great. But only great if my revenues exceed expenses AND that money that is in the black is so at the time my expectations were exceeded. In other words I have to have cash (and lots of it to have any significant value) at exactly the right time and be able to convert it. And boy can it swing the other way and you have a much higher chance of getting killed than making out like a bandit.That's where the daily rate comes into play. And please, please stop quoting some average rate for each year. Lodge owners are beholden to the rate at the time a dollar is earned and subsequently exchanged. Think about that. Our money comes in over a 12 month period. Our major expenses are in a 4 month window. Our personal draws (salary) and family needs are every week. So, for example I had hundreds of thousands of dollars going out in May and June, start-up. I did not get some huge rate. I got the low end of the scale because that's where it stood at that point in time. And between you and me it was less than what I had forecasted. Point being that money comes in and out all year long and any average rate can be thrown out the window. Its good or bad. Plain and simple. And that risk is compounded in a big way.But the other more important point is that we set prices based on our currency. This has been said over and over here. If I charge in Canadian $ my rates will be different than US. But, you say if its in USD and the exchange rate is good then you make all this money. And our response is that one we took that risk and more importantly two if we charged in Canadian it would be more. Again, the currency I charge in is directly proportional to my forecasted exchange rate and my required profit margin. If I charge in USD it will be less than what I charge in Canadian. See that? If the exchange rate is 50% for the USD than my prices will be different. Our rates are constantly being adjusted, they have to be. The currency doesn't matter. Its the value you see in the lodge for that price. If the value is not there that will affect bookings and hence the rate will have to be adjusted (or other factors but you usually start with rates) or a lodge owner will look overpriced compared to a similar operation. To end, right about now (well actually 4 months ago) lodge owners are forecasting their revenue for 2016 and finalizing expenses. And they are doing that (for USD) based on their crystal ball. And hoping they get it right. They will only know this at the end of the season though.One final point. The USD shot up 2% yesterday based on job reports and unemployment figures in the US being stronger than anticipated. Sweet. I will transfer 100k today and make a quick 2 grand! What, I don't have 100k, or my deposits for next year in yet? Well that sucks. I hope when I finally have all that money and it is disposable that rate is still there.One final, final point. When the USD goes up all products made in the US (i.e. boats, motors, kitchen appliances, hot-tubs, you name it) go up right along with it. -FT"

4307706,Downrigger,2015-11-07 08:54:00,60,"Just trying to understand. If you are a Canadian citizen, owning a lodge in Canada, is your profit and loss determined by your revenue and expenses all measured in Canadian dollars and the exchange rate only coming into play if and when any dollars are moved outside of Canada? It seems that the Canadian owner does not rely on the exchange rate to make his profit, as that seems to be the gamble. Like any business, he must control his expenses to match revenue. His prices are not determined by a forecasting the exchange rate. As a US owner of a Canadian lodge, do you not purchase your supplies in Canada and hire local labor payable in Canadian dollars? To be competitive, all else being equal, would not your price also be baaed on your revenue and expenses, without gambling on the exchange rate? If you have to gamble on the rate to meet your profit goal, are your expenses in line? Just wondering."
4307746,Fisherman Ted,2015-11-07 09:05:00,461,"I inherited the lodge that used that pricing model. Also my guests like the fact that they are quoted one price and it won't change. It is what it is. Also, I need to pay myself in USD."
4307770,Fisherman Ted,2015-11-07 09:13:00,461,"- No profits are determined by exchange rates. Like every other business it is your revenue and expenses.

Nearly all marketing expenses are in USD (shows, tv shows, print etc.). Also items that are cheaper in the US (tackle in bulk) and worth the hassle of bringing up. Also, we pay ourselves in USD. My price is indeed based on revenue and expenses. The only difference is my revenue is affected by a global exchange rate. Interestingly enough, even if all revenue was in Canadian $ the global exchange rate still plays a big role as many products are made by non-Canadian companies. Also, for US lodge owners would still have to pay themselves in USD. Bottom line is that the exchange rate comes into play in either scenario and is a part of running a business that relies on American guests and American products."

4305698,Downrigger,2015-11-06 08:55:00,60,"I have stayed at two different lodges on Eagle lake. Each have really great owners, with knowledge and experience on the lake. Each have 1st rate facilities, cabins, warfage with electricity, updated boats for rental, equal in most all respects. One charges $1050 Ca.per week for a 2 bedroom cabin. The other charges $970 US per week for a 2 bedroom cabin. Comparing apples to apples, the $1050 Ca. at today's effective (28%) exchange rate is equal to $820 US, or $150 US per week less than the other. You decide. How important is that $150 US to you?"
4306330,Obabikon,2015-11-06 14:26:00,2370,"That's true... it also works that five years ago, when it was at par. Canadians were spending by the boat load in northern MN. Simply because it was 25% less than they had experienced in years. Many invested their money in US dollars (in a ton of different ways). Now... they are 30% wealthier, plus whatever improvement on investments that were made. You can make money on exchange rates... if you're lucky and study trends. Its just like the stock market. If the US is your ""base"" currency. When you believe the rate is going to go up... you should change currencies. If you believe it is going to go down... you should keep your base currency. I believe it was Warren Buffett who made billions off of exchange rates, and based much of his speculating off of gold values. So, I guess if you want to pay 5 years worth of fishing trips up front, you can play the exchange rate game. My point on all this is that what currency a resort charges in (US or Canadian) has nothing to do with if it is a good buy or a bad one. In fact, it doesn't even mean you're saving money. It just means one charges in Canadian and the other US. The ""deal"" is in the total value of the trip. Trip A is $500 Trip B is $1000 It doesn't matter what currency... trip A is cheaper. A different example... Trip A is $1000 US at a 5 star resort Trip B is $1000 Canadian at a 3 star resort Trip B is cheaper... but does the $247 savings justify the downgraded amenities? That's where ""actual value"" comes to play. The actual value of each resort changes for each person who travels. Some want/need different things. Some people will go to the same resort until they have to sell kidneys to afford it. Simply because that ONE place holds an incredible amount of value to them. I am NOT saying that resorts that charge in Canadian are inferior or superior. I'm saying that it doesn't matter what currency a resort charges in. It matters what the ACTUAL value to each person is. If you're happy with the actual value, then by all mean, have an AMAZING trip!!!"
4306338,Obabikon,2015-11-06 14:28:00,2370,"That's true... if the resorts are identical, you convert and find out which one is the least expensive. If the one that was charging in US dollars was $750 per week... it would be the best value."
4306378,Obabikon,2015-11-06 14:42:00,2370,"Last bit for now... I know a resort on LOTW's that is very similar to Obabikon. I would say that their boats are a little nicer, but mine have GPS. Meals, lodging, remote (we're an island, so that's an advantage)... everything else is a very similar. They charge around $1100 (currently $835 US) Canadian for a 3day/4night package Obabikon currently charges $805 for a 3day/4night package That's not a huge difference. However, just because one charges in Canadian doesn't mean they're less expensive."

4289674,bigcreekdad,2015-10-29 06:22:00,74,"Zeebee....so if we pay in US dollars we are fools? Seems a bit harsh, and unnecessary. What are we supposed to do.....refuse to pay in US$? If we did so, I would guess we would be looking for a new lodge/resort. I try not to let the cost of a trip interfere with where I want to go (within reason). But, of course, I'm kinda foolish."
4289682,port1042,2015-10-29 06:23:00,509,"I mailed my deposit earlier this week. My lodge charges in US Dollars. They don't hide that fact and I'm fine with it. Regardless of the exchange rate, my trip cost exactly what I expect it cost. I suppose I save a couple of bucks on a breakfast on the way in and lunch on the way out, but the rest of my expenses are either incurred in the US or at the lodge. As long as my lodge owner stays up front about how they charge the exchange rate means nothing to me -- up or down."
4289786,kayakmatt,2015-10-29 07:06:00,105,"I'm not going to the same lodge as last year, even though it was great, and the fishing was great. I felt it was high then (USD$), and now it looks really high with the exchange rate when compared to nearby competing lodges charging CAD$. We are talking $500 per person difference. So yes, I agree with Zeebee, but I won't use the gouging term. This lodge will simply has to look at their bookings in 2016 and determine if their pricing is hurting their top line revenue (and resulting bottom line) or are they willing to have less bookings, and likely make the same profit due to lower expenses (less work, same money perspective) Yes, every employee there was Canadian, owners are US citizens. Scanning the web, I've seen some US owned lodges on LOW that have really affordable (competitive) rates that charge in USD$, even compared to CAD$ exchange rate. Perhaps they see that their cost of business is lower and are willing to pass it on in lower prices in order to stay at a high occupancy rate. Yes, some will go to Canada without even considering the exchange rate simply for the love of it and what they perceive as value for services offered. Personally, I think it is well worth taking this significant variable into consideration."
4291234,ziggyzag,2015-10-29 17:52:00,125,"I guess I see it like this if a outfitter charging $1200 Can dollars for a trip and another outfitter in the same region that you are wanting to fish is charging $840 U.S then I guess to all of us Americans its a wash. (30% of 1200 Can = $840 US) Also some outfitters charging U.S have there price including the 13% tax which is also a savings. But whatever the case may be I am going fishing to whatever outfitter who has access to the lakes I want to fish and can provide the services our group requires. With that said, I don't feel an outfitter charging U.S. dollars if gouging anyone or is this point about a American owned outfitter in Canada????? Charging U.S dollars???"
4291650,pjshorthorn,2015-10-29 21:39:00,5654,"I don't think the outfitter's citizenship has any bearing on the topic. I've patronized a lodge owned by a Canadian national that charged in US dollars when the exchange rate favored doing so. I noticed that their 2015 rates were now quoted in CND. I didn't mind spending dollars as it was the type of place I wanted to stay at and the lake that I wanted to fish. I have also patronized a lodge owned by a Canadian national that charges in CND. I go there for the same reasons. In both cases I got what I paid for or more.I agree with you 100%. It is your money so go where you want. I do have to say that I have never seen a lodge's rate structure include the HST rates in the package price. Not saying it doesn't exist, just haven't seen it.Fish on and have fun.PjShorthorn."
4292386,ziggyzag,2015-10-30 09:26:00,125,TLO out of Nakina pricing is with all taxes included and quoted in U.S dollars
4292522,adempsey,2015-10-30 10:02:00,963,Seven Lakes Wilderness Camps and Leuenberger's Wilderness Lodge & Outposts also include the taxes in their rates.
4292858,kenoraite,2015-10-30 11:42:00,2,"Fellow Americans, just a tip, when purchasing items in Canada make the most of your credit cards and reap the benefits when your bill comes in the exchange rate offered by them is better than paying cash as some business offer only very low rates on cash. Save your money for tipping us guides and staff we much appreciate it."
4190649,onetimedave,2015-09-09 09:48:00,502,It is not to early to be considering trip options for 2016. With the dollar conversion rate approx. 30% in favor of the US dollar it makes trips much more reasonable. You can even exchange $$$ now if you think the rate will be more in favor of the Canadian $$$
4190729,bthomas3333,2015-09-09 10:24:00,465,The problem with thinking about 2016 already is I wind up going stir crazy before the May opener. I tell myself every year to just forget about next year until January 2016.B-
4192529,Baseline,2015-09-10 06:13:00,3207,"Like you, I'm already planning on 2016 although I don't make any commitments before March or April. I like to fish new lakes each year or at least visit waters I've fished at other times during the season. I'll be going to the Northwest Sports Show in Minneapolis in late March and usually find a trip or two that interests me. The exchange rate is great, but most of the resorts quote prices in US funds to protect themselves against the weak Canadian dollar , so it may not make that much difference to the bottom line except for travel expenses."
4194209,onetimedave,2015-09-10 16:52:00,502,Most of the time when rates are quoted in US dollars the camp is owned by an American. We go with AWO out of Nakina. They are Canadians and have always quoted us in Canadian $$$$$$. Don't know about 2016 yet but they have not raised rates the last 5 years.
4194921,zeebee,2015-09-11 06:06:00,1144,"If you are going to Canada and are paying USD then you are a fool. The lodge is paying their employees, their bills all in CDN$ and then invoicing in USD,.....DUH."
4194961,octanehi5,2015-09-11 06:43:00,1104,"My trip for the next yr is booked the minute I step off the float plane, It does not matter if the Canadian $ is up or down its about the trip it self. being from the US Its nice to enjoy the 30%differance, Been going north for more than 25 yrs. The outfitters set their rates, If you booked its what you pay. In the past as well as now the US dollar has been a more stable Currency"
4196433,zeebee,2015-09-11 19:08:00,1144,"When comparing only two currencies...in this case USD and CDN$ how can one be stable and one not? Makes no sense. They are either stable vis a vis each other or they are not.The fact is, any lodge owner charging in USD and not adjusting costs downwards to reflect the exchange rate is gouging you."
4196673,BrianinVA,2015-09-11 21:06:00,160,"Resorts owners who price in USD assume the risk of currency fluctuation for the convenience of their customers. It's a business decision that results in currency gains when the Canadian dollar is weak and currency loses when the Canadian dollar is strong. Over the years the gains and loses are pretty much a wash. But it is most certainly not price gouging as the price of the good or service offered has not been changed by the resort owner. If you can find a resort that's priced in Canadian dollars it might be a bargain next year. Just be careful they don't ""gouge"" you when the currency pendulum swings the other way."
4196986,octanehi5,2015-09-12 06:13:00,1104,"This last june my six guys enjoyed a $1200 (In canadian) for $1000 US Fly in float plane trip.All currancies fluctuate with the world market, Right now we enjoy a 30% differance with Canadian Money, = this yrs trip will only cost $900 US.If your trips have been booked to an outfitter that has been Price gouging, I suggest you look for a differant outfitter, make sure your getting what your paying for. In the past 25+yrs I have been taking a fly in float plane trip into northern quebec, 80% of the time I have enjoyed a favored rate to the US$ Making it in my eyes a much more stable currency, Its excepted all over the world"
4289274,adempsey,2015-10-28 19:46:00,963,"I put together a list of Outpost Outfitters in Ontario that are charging in $CDN. There are great savings in some cases, but overall I'd say the biggest benefits are likely going to be on travel expenses like groceries, meals and hotels. http://www.lineonfishing.com/index.p...-strong-dollar"
