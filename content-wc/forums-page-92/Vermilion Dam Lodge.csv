We have 4 adults and 6 kids ranging from 8 to 16 years old. I have never been to vermilion and am looking for advice on where to get started for walleyes!

Talk is that Walleyes were biting pretty good last week. Lindy rig with red hook & a green bead trolling slow in 25-30 feet. off of reefs & around islands. Said the Muskies chase the Walleye out of the shallows around the shorelines. Early morning & evening fishing is best for the Walleye. It is a beautiful lake & is heavily fished & lots of leisure boaters too. It is also true that people fish nearby each other. Good Luck & Enjoy! RBF
