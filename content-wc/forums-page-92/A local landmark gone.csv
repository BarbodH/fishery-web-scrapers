6453546,LoDo,2020-06-18 07:18:00,721,no way! Really hope no one was hurt.
6453564,v-bay gord,2020-06-18 08:04:00,3168,"That is unfortunate. I feel bad for the couple who ran it. At least it wasn't a home, just a business...and nobody was hurt."
6453572,bus33,2020-06-18 08:19:00,289,Dang that's too bad for them. I hope they can rebuild......that is our yearly stop before heading north on 105.
6453582,RichA$1970,2020-06-18 08:49:00,1159,I wonder if we will see any suspect fires based on lack of business n cashing in on insurance like we had in the early 80s with barns being burned on the farms.
6453606,bus33,2020-06-18 10:16:00,289,Hate to say it but that was my first thought.
6453666,v-bay gord,2020-06-18 13:42:00,3168,"It was a real store, run by real people....they would probably appreciate some moral support at this time."
6453690,Blue Lk,2020-06-18 15:27:00,269,"Yes Gord,a very nice young hard working family."
6453736,RichA$1970,2020-06-18 17:45:00,1159,I was not knocking them as in the early 80s around 1/3 of the farms went under in our counties n we were lucky due to several factors. Iâ€™m sure it was an accident n hopefully they had good insurance to rebuild or move on. Our barns never burned but we saw a lot n that held off the auctioneers for some for at least awhile. I hope they open the border so the economy can pick up.
