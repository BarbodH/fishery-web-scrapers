6452350,Mdklauck,2020-06-15 12:05:00,1,"I am going to Lac Seul for the first time next year and staying at an outpost cabin on Sunlight lake. I will be there from August 28 to September 4. I have been reading a lot of old posts on fishing Lac Seul that time of year. However haven't been able to find a lot of info on Sunlight lake outpost cabin or the fishing on Sunlight Lake that time of year. I was also wondering if anyone could answer a few other questions I had. The website says that there is power for lights in the cabin but does anyone know if it is possible to charge a trolling motor battery? About how long of a trip is it from the outpost cabin on Sunlight Lake to Lac Seul? It's hard to get an idea of it by just looking at a map. We get 15 dozen minnows per boat but being so far away from camp is it worth bringing leachs and/or nightcrawlers as a back up or do they work better? I have been fishing in Canada for year on a different part of the English river. I usually fish in June and use a lot of plastics so fishing in Canada with live bait thing is kind of new to me. Lastly, from what I have read I'm looking for wind blow points and main lake structure with deep water near by. My question is, are there any parts of the lake that tend to be better fishing at the end of August/beginning of September? Not looking for any specific spots just help getting pointed in the right direction. Any help and information is greatly appreciated."
6452402,prov1800,2020-06-15 13:49:00,5010,Getting to sunlight lake is around a 30+ mi boat ride.Hope for a calm day.lol.Fishing will be slower in both sunligh and broad then.Most fish leave there for main lake.Tgere will be some.we are fishing it now and its always pretty crazy in there.Be better fishing main lake.15 dozen minnows would last me maybe a day and a half.Lol.If you know the lake.but definately bring more of something else.worms leeches good.You will have to learn main lake a bit to catch fish as they will be deeper to 30 ft.You will have to run the creek from sunlight to get back to main lake or just fishbm where you are at sunlight and broad.
6452406,Carnhzkr,2020-06-15 14:04:00,964,"I've stayed there twice and really enjoyed both trips. It feels like a fly-in trip while you're back on Sunlight, not so much when you move out into LS. I tried Sunlight and Broad both trips but never did much good on them. The best area in the two smaller lakes is probably at the mouth of Broad, where it goes out into the river. Do you have your own boat or using a camp boat? In either case, you'll want a decent depth finder to find mid-lake structure out in the big lake. That part of LS is loaded with reefs that top out around 15 - 20 feet. When you find a reef, you'll likely see walleye hanging off the edges. My first year there we fished the twin islands quite a bit with very good success. That's a popular spot. From the outpost, you're in fairly easy access to popular fishing spots such as Stony Point, Windigo Point, Manitoba Point, Ghost Narrows and the sand banks in MaKenzie Bay. With my 75hp, it's about a 20-25 minute boat ride out to the main part of LS, depending on how fast you move through Manitou Creek.My first trip there, sometimes I'd notice a boat working a particular reef and I'd boat past them, keeping my distance and mark a waypoint, then I'd check that spot later on or the next day. That's an easy way to find reefs, but they're not particularly hard to find. Just watch your depth and you'll be in 50' and pretty soon you'll come up to 20 and if you see fish, give it a try.Definitely take crawlers. I primarily use crawler harnesses, but jigs are great if you can hold over fish. Personally, I'd avoid the plastics, but that's just me. I doubt you'll be able to even find leeches that time of year. Lac Seul Lodge will make a mid-week trip and replenish your minnows.You cannot charge your batteries using the solar system at the camp. They should have a generator available, which is a pain due to the noise, but that's your only option. It's a fun trip, you'll enjoy it."
6452414,Carnhzkr,2020-06-15 14:15:00,964,"Forgot to mention that both times I stayed there was early August, so fish were definitely in their summer areas hanging around mid-lake structure in 25 - 30 feet. As PROV1800 mentioned, this time of year the area where Broad Lake goes out is very productive, but most of the walleye will soon leave the two smaller lakes and head to the big water and their summer patterns."
6452548,flntknp17,2020-06-15 19:10:00,151,"I agree with what was said above. I have fished that part of Lac Seul many times in September, and the fish will definitely be keying on the main lake structure. I'm sure some resident fish will remain in Sunlight and Broad the whole year, but many will head to the big water for fall and winter. Most of these creeks and rivers flowing into LS will have two distinct populations of fish as you may have noted before; a thinner, more golden fish, and a fatter, whiter fish. I think the more streamlined golden walleyes are the ones that stay in the smaller water all the time. There are a couple placed you'll need to be careful of when navigating the creek. There is a large mud bar right at the initial neck down. Much of it is shallow enough to run up on DEPENDING on the pool level of LS at that time. Just go slow where I marked the three parallel lines. The first big curve of the creel also has a large rock reef completely blocking the left side (looking up-current). You'll need to strongly favor the right bank. In 2019, there was still a large tree marking the outside end of the rock and you had to be outside it. The red circle is a spot where someone has a campsite/hunting camp and a boat cache. Good luck! I will be on LS out of Ear Falls starting September 12 assuming the border opens. Matt"
6452582,Lmbkiller,2020-06-15 20:40:00,639,"Those lakes mostly suck, especially late summer, they don't have decent resident populations, they're spawning/nursery areas. I havnt been up there in about 18yrs and I have no plans to get there ever again. If you're looking for solitude I bet it's pretty good late summer"
6452800,Bstar,2020-06-16 11:22:00,564,We used to fish out of Fisherman's Cove and usually the same week that you are going. We would always go to Sunlight for a day and we always caught fish. Around the island is an obvious spot. There is a rocky point on the east side of the north basin and the north shoreline always produced for us. It has a good rocky bottom that drops off into some deeper water. A go to spot if you have a south wind.Take crawlers with you as you will not find leeches at that time. Spinner rigs on bottom bouncers will work well. Jig and a minnow or crawler works well too. It is a nice little picturesque lake where you have the best of both worlds. You can run out to LS in the morning and fish the numerous points and reefs for the big girls and then fish Sunlight in the evening. I would consider Sunlight an average walleye lake that at times can be very fun to fish. We have run out of minnows fishing that lake and we usually have 5 dozen minnows in the bucket when we leave the dock. Good luck and I hope the border is open by then.
6453734,MikeAnkeny,2020-06-18 17:43:00,67,I hit a rock just to the downstream of that double curve. We thought we were in the clear and of course pouring the coals on pushed the stern down.
