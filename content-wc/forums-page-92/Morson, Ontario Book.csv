6448162,Bill Krejca,2020-06-04 06:06:00,6107,"The community of Morson is in the process of producing a book on the history of the community, past and not so past people, and events which have influenced the culture of the area. This is similar to, maybe, similar history publications from other communities in the general area. One of which I have a copy is the excellent publication from Nestor Falls, ""A Collection of Memories"", first printed in 1992. Recently, I have been asked to contribute some of my writings and pictures, particularly centered around the Turtle Portage area. To that end, I have given, without charge, the committee permission to use parts from my copyrighted book and also portions of my yet-to-be-published followup writings on the area. I am not sure when their publication of the Morson book will be completed, it should be an interesting read. From personal experience, I have found that generation and culmination of publications takes much longer than generally anticipated. I am just sharing this information as it may be of some future interest to those of you who travel north. Bill"
6448166,johnboat,2020-06-04 06:37:00,2014,Cool. Most of my many LOTW experiences have been in the Morson area. I really like that area and would definitely enjoy reading more about the history. Kudos to you for your assistance and for bringing this to our attention.

The first part of the book is about the history and the second part is about the people, past and present. I would love to get my hands on a copy of a book about the Nestor Falls and Morson area. Hope you guys have a great day!!!Todd"
6448518,BornToFish,2020-06-05 05:35:00,1224,"Greetings, Bill: You should be proud of contributing to this new book, as it will be a tribute to an amazing place and people. You and your family will be proud of your legacy. Very kindest regards...."
6451214,fldoc1,2020-06-11 16:32:00,69,Sounds like a super idea. I have been going with my wife to Mylies for 4 years now and missed the early June trip this year. Ellen called us to personally pass on the message. My wife really gets along well with Ellen and I enjoy Justin and his wife Krista. I have fallen in love with the trip and area so rescheduled for early September. It would be interesting learning about the history. Randy from Duluth
6451372,fishin779,2020-06-12 05:23:00,63,"Bill, How do I get a copy of the book about the Nestor falls are and get on a list for the book about the Morson area when it becomes available ? Thanks foe being a part of this project !! Todd"
6451394,Bill Krejca,2020-06-12 07:10:00,6107,"Todd - I got my copy of the NF book from Helliars maybe 15 years ago. I'd guess that most of the gift shops, etc in the Nestor Falls community sell the book. Entitled ""A Collection Of Memories Nestor Falls"", it was published by Nestor Falls Historical Committee, General Delivery, Nestor Falls, Ontario,POX 1KO. It is a well done professionally crafted product, having 281 pages. Re: Morson book - [email protected] Bill"
6451588,walleyecheek,2020-06-12 15:13:00,2231,"that Nestorfalls book is quite pricey? 100 bucks on ebay. I didn't call Helliars, but i doubt they have it."
