I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that mom and pop bait shop owners are not wise to the subtle ways to light your place on fire and get away with it."
6454210,The tank,2020-06-20 03:00:00,340,When my house burnt down I was talking with the state fire marshal and he said it almost impossible to prove arson. Unless there some kind of residue left from how they started it. He said mine started in the living room I think it started in the kitchen. I guess we will never know. Hope everything works out for these folks.

6454256,v-bay gord,2020-06-20 07:21:00,3168,Good one!
6454392,Da' Walleye Assassun,2020-06-20 12:58:00,358,I have heard of a professional arsonist who specializes in using candles. He has retired after avenging the death of his dawg. The man's name is JOHN WICK!
6454404,walleyecheek,2020-06-20 13:41:00,2231,yeah i always heard John was burning his candles at both ends ?
6453638,Skywagon,2020-06-18 12:31:00,1106,"The Eagle Junction store burned, information via CKDR https://www.ckdr.net/2020/06/17/eagl...ore-destroyed/"
6453656,stumcfar,2020-06-18 13:12:00,451,"What is the cause of the fires over the last several years? I believe a motel, the corner bait shop and a restaurant in Vermillion Bay have burnt and now this one in Dryden??"
6453660,Skywagon,2020-06-18 13:28:00,1106,Between Dryden and VBay. Gord probably has the current scoop on it.
6453662,v-bay gord,2020-06-18 13:36:00,3168,"Haven't heard. I know that many fires have been caused by faulty electrical, or something plugged in that malfunctions and starts a fire."
6453890,fishin779,2020-06-19 05:36:00,63,There also was the fire at Redden's last year while they were rebuilding.
6454022,reddemon2,2020-06-19 11:33:00,255,Insurance job i'd imagine
6454068,Aspencreek,2020-06-19 13:48:00,2911,"I hope not, because nobody wins in a fire. The technology that can be used today to determine cause is pretty sophisticated and insurance companies at the slightest hint of impropriety will not hesitate to withhold payouts and will prosecute."
6454072,reddemon2,2020-06-19 13:52:00,255,"I've been in the fire industry, Many ways to do it that don't look suspicious, Let's hope that's not the case here, But I'm sure not having any tourism is killing businesses up there"
6454102,walleyecheek,2020-06-19 15:43:00,2231,fire industry ?
6454158,reddemon2,2020-06-19 18:43:00,255,Firefighter Duh
