6451996,prov1800,2020-06-14 10:10:00,5010,Look√®d to be up a ft from last week.pretty close to normal
6451748,prov1800,2020-06-13 06:56:00,5010,"Did a solo trip to Cedar yesterday.Was a cool start at 3c.Crazy weather here so far.Water temps back down to 56 F. Thought it would be tough fishing after the last 4 days of rain,cold temps with tornado warnings but fishing was really good. I stopped in a nice little cove out of the wind and in the sun and caught fish instantly in a couple of ft of water.Stayed real close to Clarks camp and wster is reslly clear there where i could see fish swimming around.Nice to see that.One other spot i tried had fish on 2 diff humps at 9-11 ft coming out of 20 ft so no real pattern.Dont think i burnt a 1/2 gallon of gas yesterday."

6451808,prov1800,2020-06-13 12:06:00,5010,Ron the fish in pics went back.We like the smaller fish.Just wife and i.Dont need much for a meal.Brought home a few good sized perch to.Couple of worms but they come out easy.Buddy of mine makes a fish batter he sells around here and its really good to.Not a shorelunch but did fry them outside.
