6450566,Stringbean,2020-06-10 06:22:00,279,Would anyone care to hazard a guess as to how much the water level in the Lac Seul reservoir will rise due to the remnants of Christoball?
6450592,reddemon2,2020-06-10 07:20:00,255,"Irrelevant , You wont be going to Canada anytime soon"
6450598,Eckohlt,2020-06-10 07:30:00,3685,Come on red give the guy an answer you just might make his day complete
6450614,prov1800,2020-06-10 08:04:00,5010,Well we have had rain now since Sunday and still raining today.iam sure with all tributaries dumping into Lac Seul now we will see a significant rise this week.Lake was down around 4 ft on the weekend
6450632,Stringbean,2020-06-10 08:26:00,279,"Actually, I'm planning for late August or the beginning of September. If the border isn't open by then, we have a real problem."
6450638,prov1800,2020-06-10 08:31:00,5010,Can only hope and wait at this point.Tough deal here.If border opens late iam sure some camps will just stay closed.Be hard to get staff to come back as most will have found other jobs.
6450756,Aspencreek,2020-06-10 12:06:00,2911,"The remnants of what was Christobal went thru here yesterday,no big deal, just widespread rain and not alot of that, some others may have gotten more. Just checked the radar, Christobal is gone, a big nothing burger for those above the border."
