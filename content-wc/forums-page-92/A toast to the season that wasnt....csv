After having thought of the trip/ prepped for who knows how long, the day we set foot once more on that hallowed ground is filled with hopes and expectations, anticipations, enjoyment, exuberance, and premonitions of the days to come, filled with giant fish and good times. Arrival puts a sense of energetic being into even us geezer types, and even more so with the younger friends. If there could be a Fountain Of Youth for a day, that day would pass as such for many of us. Hopefully, when/if the border opens many of us will again experience that feeling yet this year. Bill"

On arrival day we unpack and head out just long enough to catch dinner. Then some Crown and cards. The best part? The smell of potatoes and onions cooking. Smelling that for the first time in a long time is amazing, probably my favorite food smell."

6451322,Guest,2020-06-11 21:04:00,0,"June 21 - Fathers day should have found me flying in for our 10th year annual trip. Guerin Lake on the Attwood River, with our new outfitter Boreal Forest Outfitters, who purchased the camp from Matticce Lake Outfitters. We are a husband/Wife team from New Jersey who really look forward to our Wilderness Vacation. What a kick in the teeth this Spring/ Summer is turning into. Not only for myself and fellow Anglers, but the Outfitters who work so hard to show us Guests a good time. I know this is a tough nut for them, more then a few we have befriended over the years, and one's I don't know. We wish you well. Still holding hope, we get up there. I need my Big, Fat Canadian Walleyes! I need my miles of Pine tree's! I need some ice, Cold Molson's! I need the solitude, I find here, unlike no place other. If it's meant to be, it'll happen. If not, a Man can dream, can't he? Wishing you all a Good, Safe Summer. Beerslayer Kenny"
6451000,bigwalleye1,2020-06-11 07:13:00,2632,"Today would have been my arrival day in camp. Since we can't go, please join me in remembering the good times. Please post up on your arrival day, the camp name, and any first day traditions. June 11 arrival at Frog Rapids for almost a week. We'd unpack, hit the water for a few hours, then come back and offer up a toast before preparing dinner to all the friends that are no longer with us. My plan for the afternoon is to offer a similar toast today, despite not being north of the border."
6451008,LoDo,2020-06-11 07:24:00,721,I'm still holding out hope to get in this year. We've got a private cabin on Red Lake. I believe our only hope is both governments allowing property owners allowed to check on their camp. As far as tourists coming across I think we're in trouble. We always jump off the dock no matter the time of year and weather. There have certainly been yrs where the water temps where below 50. Best of luck to all trying to get in this year!
6451012,eyecatcher1,2020-06-11 07:31:00,323,"MY wife and I would have been arriving Saturday at Red Pine Lodge for two weeks. You probably know that's just a stone's throw from Frog Rapids. We're older now, so our first day we usually just settle in and probably put a steak on the grill for dinner."
6451022,hoosiercanadian,2020-06-11 08:13:00,104,"LoDo , my place is just up the road from you on Coli Lake. My first order of business is to light the propane fridge, kind of a ritual, then get the boat in the water and make sure an outboard that has not been ran since September will start, as well as a generator. Then there is usually a blown down tree or something that i just have to get taken care of , then put some pickeral on the table !"
6451024,BCNeal,2020-06-11 08:15:00,19,"Our group would have been up this week. The only thing making it less painful is that it's been very rainy this week and very cold up near Pickle Lake, ON. High today in low 40s with rain and lows have been in mid 30s."
6451032,Jwendt15,2020-06-11 08:35:00,72,"Would have been checking in at Onaway Lodge Friday, May 29. Goal is to typically arrive sometime between 3-4pm. Head out for a good night of fishing and a late night Friday night fish fry. Play a few games and crawl in bed for some of the best sleep of the year. Looking forward to 2021. My thoughts are with everyone that couldn't make it this year and especially camp owners. We've always said it, but you can never take these trips for granted. Precious memories and times every chance we get up there."
6451054,rockape,2020-06-11 09:58:00,215,"Would have been arriving at Winoga on 6/16. The border closing breaks an 18 year streak of trips to NW Ontario. We would usually arrive as early as allowed (early afternoon), get our food in the fridge, and head out to catch dinner. Come back, clean the fish, drink a ton, and celebrate the week ahead. Then, as someone else said, get the best night's sleep all year!"
6451056,eyecatcher1,2020-06-11 10:10:00,323,28 year streak broken here unless the border opens before it freezes up.
