6452116,The tank,2020-06-14 18:11:00,340,I would probably pull spinners on the mud flats to start with. Worms leeches or minnows. If you find a big school start jigging. Good luck!
6452200,ljcs789,2020-06-15 05:49:00,42,Thanks Tank. I was kind of leaning toward crawlers. What weight/color jigs would you recommend?
6452214,The tank,2020-06-15 06:42:00,340,I like pink the best than gold and chartreuse is always good. If you pull spinners I like pink also and white second and gold 3rd.
6452284,ljcs789,2020-06-15 08:55:00,42,Do we need heavier than 3/8?
6452310,The tank,2020-06-15 10:02:00,340,Jigs I use mostly 3/8.sometimes 1/4. Bottom bouncers we use 3/4 and 1oz.
