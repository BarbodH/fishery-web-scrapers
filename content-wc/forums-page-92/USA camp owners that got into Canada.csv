6450018,port1042,2020-06-08 17:32:00,509,"Ted; Glad to hear your on your way. Good luck with your season -- I hope you can save it. What will your quarantine be like? I assume you'll be at your camp. Can you have employees available and work with them or are you a ""shut in""? Let us know how it's working out. I missed my spring trip to Perrault Falls but I think it's looking good for my trip the end of August. We wish you the best under these tough circumstanaces. Stay well!"
6450302,BIGbmuskies,2020-06-09 11:40:00,9,Hey Ted. Trout fishing has been great. Problem bear in cabin bay. He is not scared of airhorns or people. Good luck.

6449544,Fisherman Ted,2020-06-08 06:10:00,461,"Ontario just opened up the phone lines to the border crossings throughout the province for this situation. As luck would have it I was the first one to call 7:01 CST.The process as explained is as such.You call the border station where you are going to cross.Give the officer your preliminary information, including work permit application #, camp name, location etc.They they send an email to the lodge owner requesting additional documentation. Haven't received it yet. Suspect its the standard stuff we show when we cross like tax returns, employee info, articles of incorporation etc.They review and if its all there schedule a time when you can cross. And since its all pre-approved the wait time at the border is minimal.One item they did mention is not to bring commercial merchandise across with you as that will substantially slow down crossing time. If you have goods they suggested using a broker.-FT"

6449572,Fisherman Ted,2020-06-08 06:56:00,461,yes
6449934,Guest,2020-06-08 15:05:00,0,Today is the first day that they even legally can try. From what I have understood (because my wife needs to cross)... she has to set up an appointment to get her work permit when she crosses. This is going to throw some timing issues into it. It's like getting an appointment with a hairstylist right now... they're going to be completely swamped.
6449944,Fisherman Ted,2020-06-08 15:14:00,461,"My application was quickly approved and I picked my time to cross easily. As I have a 2,000 mile drive I had to pick this Wednesday afternoon to be safe. In 48 hours I will be at the lodge. In quarantine. With no guests. But plenty of booze... -FT"
