This doesn't address the border issue, however: Tour and guide services Indoor and outdoor tour and guide services will be allowed to resume. This includes: resource-based tours (for example, hunting, fishing and similar excursions) tastings and tours for operators of on-site retail stores at manufacturing sites (for example, wineries, breweries and distilleries) trail riding, walking and bike tours motor vehicle and boat tours (for example, for sightseeing) Businesses should consider operating by appointment and/or record each patron's name and contact information for the purpose of contact tracing. Patrons must adhere to physical distancing measures and limits to public gatherings. Equipment may be rented as needed as part of the tours. Equipment should be properly cleaned and disinfected in between rentals. Access to production areas for tours of food and beverage manufacturing sites is permitted, as long as operators can follow workplace guidance and public health advice to ensure quality and cleanliness of products. Eating or drinking can occur in licensed outdoor spaces but is not permitted indoors.[/COLOR]"
