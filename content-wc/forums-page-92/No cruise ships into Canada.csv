6448632,stumcfar,2020-06-05 08:54:00,451,"I have been on several cruises and I love them. We got off a cruise ship in March and it was the last week of cruising before they were all cancelled. With that said, it will be some time before I get back on. Nothing too appealing about being stuck out at sea with no ports that want you to dock!"
6449022,v-bay gord,2020-06-06 08:49:00,3168,"I think cruise lines have a unique opportunity to market trips to the elderly who want to go out with a bang. Packages could include ""burial at sea / swim with the dolphins""....."
6449218,HeHooksHimself,2020-06-07 06:58:00,725,"Too Soon, Gord"
6449234,Baseline,2020-06-07 08:09:00,3207,"Skip the Alaska Cruise, book a flight to Anchorage, rent a car and travel by road. It is the best way to see Alaska."
6449540,tv4fish,2020-06-08 06:05:00,2694,"AMEN to that We have done a few in the past, NONE of them were ""pleasant experiences"" Unruly kids as your dinner ""partners"" (not our choice - assigned seating by the cruise line) - rough seas at nights with many ""announcements"" via the PA to ""let you know of rough seas"" I could go on and on - but yeah, we're done with them........"
6450180,Mojo-NC,2020-06-09 07:15:00,1929,"I took your advice and canceled our September cruise this morning. For some reason I didn't find either of your options for ""excursions"" to be much to my liking... They did not offer a refund but instead gave us a credit towards a future cruise. We'll see how that goes."
6450244,fishron,2020-06-09 09:13:00,317,"Did the Alaska cruise with another couple a few years back in August. Only touched Canada at the end in Vancouver. We flew to Anchorage and did six days on land. Even managed a float trip on the Gulcana river and caught many Sockeye salmon on a fly rod. Never saw so many eagles. They know where the food is. Calm sailing on the inside passage down to Vancouver. Whales, Qrcas, Seals and jumping salmon all the way. Of several cruises it's the one I would repeat."
6448096,Cover Dog,2020-06-03 20:39:00,303,Today we got a message from our cruise line that our Alaska cruise in Sept. has been canceled. Canada is not letting any cruise ships into their waters until the end of October. Hope they open the boarder June 21st.
6448098,RichA$1970,2020-06-03 20:57:00,1159,Cruise ships I think are toast for at least 2020.
6448138,Eckohlt,2020-06-04 03:23:00,3685,"I'll hopefully climb aboard a 16 or 14ft cruise ship with 2 aboard soon stopping at various uncharted spots,"
6448224,Mojo-NC,2020-06-04 09:50:00,1929,"We're booked for a Caribbean cruise supposedly departing the middle of September. Our final payment is due on June 15th and we're currently debating whether to cancel or not, regardless of what the cruise line chooses to do. Our ship leaves out of FL, so the US Government and CDC will decide whether they allow ships to come and go into and out of the US. If we pay in full and the cruise gets canceled, we will be reimbursed. However, if they get the ok to go and we're not comfortable and cancel ourselves, we could lose several thousand dollars. Decisions, decisions..."
6448234,v-bay gord,2020-06-04 09:57:00,3168,You would have to hand cuff and sedate me to get me on a cruise ship.
6448238,Stringbean,2020-06-04 10:12:00,279,"I have an 18 ft, dual windshield boat standing in the garage. Now if it ever warms up so you don't have to dress like an Eskimo, I'll be out there. Sunshine, flat water, no schedule, I have it made. I don't need a cruise ship to ride around on the water."
6448252,Cover Dog,2020-06-04 11:11:00,303,"My wife got this offer from the casino host on the Celebrity Edge, could’ve went a variety of places but we chose Alaska. All we had to pay is the port taxes which were about $380 total. That got us a Veranda State Room for eight nights. Maybe I should be asking her “how much are you spending in the casino” ?Even if we canceled on our own everything was refundable.Mojo-NC If you decide not to go talk to your cruise line, with the current situation I am sure they will be understanding. If they won’t refund you can probably use whatever down payment or payment in full you’ve made on a future cruise."
6448254,Cover Dog,2020-06-04 11:12:00,303,"If I lived in Eagle Lake, Ontario there would be no need to want to go anywhere else."
6448276,walleyecheek,2020-06-04 12:14:00,2231,A yeah i think I'd take a rain ckeck on that thank you !!!
6448292,RichA$1970,2020-06-04 13:18:00,1159,I’d pass on a SS Salmonella cruise any day. Never been in one but looks like being in an airplane terminal gate just getting herded around. 14 or 16’ Lund sounds good to me right now.
