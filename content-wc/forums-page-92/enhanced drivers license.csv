6453496,Guest,2020-06-17 23:50:00,0,"Just got off the phone with the Canadian and US border offices at International Falls and Fort Frances. To enter Canada. The minimum someone needs is a birth certificate and a government issued photo ID like a drivers license or State ID. Going home. A EDL works fine. Both offices told me Iowa DOES NOT issue EDL's. Only some border states can issue EDL's. The US office said you CAN use your expired passport as ID only, you will need to show your birth certificate with it. They said Americans with out any US passport. again, a birth certificate and a government issued photo ID at minimum plus the joy of spending a little time in their office as they go over your details. If you can satisfactory proof you are a US citizen, then will welcome you back to the USA. And there you have it."

Surprisingly i got a reply in less than 2 days. response is below. I would ask your specific question regarding the license.""Thank you for contacting the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Information Center.The Global Entry card can be used to cross the border by land or sea. You may be delayed for a short time because the passport has expired.

6453640,Guest,2020-06-18 12:41:00,0,Hahaha! You would need to claim to be a refugee. Trudeau will gladly accept any refugee if it buys him your vote.
6453658,3M TA3,2020-06-18 13:14:00,2846,And my apologies to all. I was definitely wrong. A Real ID does not provide the same access as an EDL and a REAL ID won't get you back into the US on its own without your being hung up at the border for a spell.
6454146,Guest,2020-06-19 17:59:00,0,I've used my enhanced license for at least five years and take four trips to Ontario each year and have never had a problem.
6454186,Neil Toland,2020-06-19 20:09:00,198,Iowa issues a Real ID Complaint license which I know understand is a far cry from the Enhanced License. That's from the Iowa DOT. It's got a star on it but that's about it..
6454984,Neil Toland,2020-06-22 08:52:00,198,"Thank you for contacting the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Information Center. The Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) can provide information on documents required to enter Canada. Please call CBSA at (506) 636-5064. Air travel to Canada will require a valid passport. Canadian customs (CBSA): https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html United States citizens re-entering by land from Canada are required to present a valid Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) compliant document. WHTI documents include:  U.S. Passport  U.S. Passport Card  Enhanced Driver's License  Trusted Traveler Card (Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, or FAST)  Military Identification Cards (Only for members of the United States armed forces traveling on official orders)  U.S. Merchant Mariner Document (For United States citizens traveling on official maritime business) CBP will not refuse entry to a United States citizen if he or she does not have any of the required travel documents. However, a United States citizen requesting entry without a valid travel document will experience a delay at the port of entry, until the CBP Officer can verify the claim of citizenship. At the very least, United States citizens are advised to carry a valid driver's license and birth certificate to prove citizenship and to assist the admitting CBP Officer with expediting re-entry to the United States.

6452900,Neil Toland,2020-06-16 13:48:00,198,Think I'm convinced. Appreciate the feedback very much.
6453062,pike50plus,2020-06-16 20:03:00,584,"Can you use an enhanced license to get into Canada? Americans with an Enhanced Identification Card (EIC) or Enhanced Drivers License (EDL) from Washington State, Minnesota, South Dakota, Michigan, New York, or Vermont are allowed to travel to Canada without a Passport. In lieu of a passport or Nexus card, a U.S. citizen must provide a government-issued photo ID such as a driver's license and proof of U.S. citizenship such as a birth certificate or naturalization certificate.Oct 20, 2017 The enhanced driver's license is a cost-effective and convenient document that meets driving, identification and border-crossing needs. It is a federally approved document that allows you to re-enter the U.S. when traveling by land or sea from Canada, Mexico, Bermuda and the Caribbean.Jul 18, 2017"
6453140,Neil Toland,2020-06-17 04:50:00,198,"https://www.dhs.gov/real-id-frequently-asked-questions Q. If my state issues an Enhanced Driver's Licenses, is that sufficient for my state to be REAL ID compliant? A. State Enhanced Driver's Licenses (EDL) designated as acceptable border-crossing documents by DHS under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) are acceptable for official Federal purposes (i.e., boarding a commercial aircraft, accessing a Federal facility, or entering a nuclear power plant). However the existence of an EDL is not sufficient to consider the state to be in overall compliance for purpose of determining whether a Federal agency may accept a state's regular driver's license for official purposes. For example, a Federal agency could accept an EDL issued from a state but not be able to accept a standard driver's license from that same state.https://www.dhs.gov/real-id/iowa#:~:...power%20plants. Iowa is compliant with the REAL ID Act. Federal agencies can accept driver's licenses and identification cards from Iowa at Federal facilities and nuclear power plants.https://iowadot.gov/mvd/realid Also, if you have another form of federal identification you can use for these purposes, such as a valid U.S. passport or passport card, you may decide you don't need a REAL ID-marked card. for what ever this is worth. I have written to the IDOT asking for clarification but not holding my breath over a reply."
6453410,3M TA3,2020-06-17 16:38:00,2846,"Neil. If you go get your Driver's License renewed you will very likely wind up with an REAL ID compliant license. No, it is not an Enhanced DL. The Department of Homeland Security made Real ID mandatory to become effective by October 1, 2020. Being Real ID compliant affords the same level of access when traveling by ground or water transportation to Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, and the Caribbean. If you do not have a Real ID you will not be able to travel anywhere by air, including the United States. A passport is considered Real ID compliant. An Enhanced Driver's License was always that way too. So my point is, if you don't plan to travel by air, get yourself an new DL that is Real ID compliant You'll save some money."
6453436,Guest,2020-06-17 18:16:00,0,How about calling the Canadian CBSA office at the border crossing you are planning to cross at. They will tell you what is acceptable documentation.
6453452,3M TA3,2020-06-17 19:04:00,2846,"Mable, the challenge is not getting into Canada but returning to the US."
6453468,Neil Toland,2020-06-17 19:44:00,198,"I have renewed my DL in order to get the Enhanced ID to meet the future requirement for flying. Used my passport at the time as one of the documents required to get it. Everything you say above was my understanding as well until I was PM'd by a person from another state that tried using their Real ID Complaint card and was told by the US border guard that he would not accept it. I have called the International Falls US border guard office and was told as a US citizen I can always re-renter the US with a drivers license. Yet the fellow from another state was told No when passing out of the US. I have called the Canadian side Ft Francis border office and was told that with my enhanced ID (which the Iowa Dept of Transportation refers to as a Real ID Complaint Card) along with my US Birth Certificate I can enter and exit the country. They also asked if my card is machine readable of which I have no idea. I am waiting for some clarification from the Iowa DOT but don't expect much. So much seems left up to an individuals interpretation at any given moment. Maybe I'll get my passport renewed within 3 months but I'm not too optimistic. Anyway, I Appreciate your input."
6453490,Guest,2020-06-17 22:30:00,0,"Ahha, understood. Here is a copy and paste from another thread here on WC To enter Canada at any land border crossing, all you need is proof of citizenship and proof of identity. A birth certificate and government issued photo ID, like a drivers license. Heading home the the USA over a land border port of entry, yes technically you need to provide a passport. However, I spoke directly with a US border agent in International Falls. He told me they would not deny a US citizen entry into the USA IF they can provide proof of citizenship and proof of identity. May take some more time to sort it out rather than with a passport, but you will get home. You can also enter Canada and the US at the land crossing with an Enhanced Driver's License. Available at the following states Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont and Washington. You will not require to have your birth certificate if you have an EDL. You can also use a NEXUS card or a FAST (Free and Secure Trade) card. to cross the border as a form of citizenship and ID If flying into Canada, you must have a passport."
6453492,Guest,2020-06-17 23:03:00,0,"Iowa may have REAL ID compliant DLs but they are NOT an Enhanced Drivers License. An EDL can provide proof on US Citizenship. Almost any resident of any state can usually get a drivers license to allow them to operate a vehicle while they are not a US citizen. Heck a student from Belgium attending an US university for 4 years can get a State drivers license, they can not get a EDL. Found this on USA.gov Arrival From Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative covers travel by land, sea, or air from Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda: American citizens entering the U.S. must show a valid passport, U.S. passport card, a Trusted Traveler Program card (NEXUS, SENTRI, Global Entry or FAST), or an enhanced driver's license. Arrival From Other Countries All travelers entering the United States from all other countries need a passport upon arrival (regardless of their country of citizenship)."
6452376,Neil Toland,2020-06-15 12:59:00,198,I let my passport get to close to expiration - expires in August. I called the boarder crossing office on the US side at International Falls and was told that all I would need to cross and re-enter was an Enhanced Drivers License. Anyone tried this? Hoping at least I can get my October trip in.
6452382,Lmbkiller,2020-06-15 13:16:00,639,"Oh boy, here we go again"
6452384,CI_Guy,2020-06-15 13:21:00,2118,"I don't believe Iowa offers an enhanced driver's license. I know originally they were only offered in MN, MI, Vermont, NY, and WA."
6452392,Neil Toland,2020-06-15 13:27:00,198,"Yes, they do. I've got one. I should just take the border office's word but pretty leery of that."
6452422,eyecatcher1,2020-06-15 14:34:00,323,Our passports expired last year so we went to the enhanced license. We made two trips to Canada without a problem.

6452434,Lovetofish,2020-06-15 15:06:00,458,Maybe it slowed the process but last year we renewed our passport cards and it took 4 weeks through the mail.
6452442,Neil Toland,2020-06-15 15:23:00,198,I'd feel better if I had my passport. From the calls I made today trying to confirm things I was told up to eight months out for new issues and renewals. Time will tell I guess.
