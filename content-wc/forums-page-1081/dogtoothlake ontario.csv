Went later with the family and camped at the rushing river provincial park. Park was full (about 100 sites I think) of which two or three were there for the fishing. The rest are Manitobans who just come to enjoy it without fishing. The thing I learned in my limited time backs up what the resort owner told us: Most big fish (and there are big, big fish) are caught before the end of June. They can be found on the reefs in the summer but when I went in the end of August, it was real slow for everyone. We came back early and hit Rainy and did great. We are going back to the resort in Mid June. Tips: early season fish shallower than you'd think (5-7 feet). use a light split shot rig and pitch toward shore and retrieve or backtroll along the first break. Look for boulder piles and try a slip bobber over any of these rock piles. I picked up some nice ones letting the wind sweep the bobber over boulder piles in mid day at depths that I could see bottom. One other thing, I'm a rapala fan but couldn't get a look at a rapala even though the fish were shallow. use leeches on a slip bobber or split shot rig. Keep it barbless, single hook as according to the regs.As the resort owner told us, it is a lake that takes several years to get to learn. By the time we left, we just felt like we were getting a feel for it. Looking forward to this year. Resort is hard to get a reservation in early season."

Last time fished in mid June and found it to be as exciting as they say it is. Dogtooth Lake Resort is as accommodating a lodge as you will find. Highly recommend. May also want to take a 1 day trip to the English River which they can help you out with. Also, smallmouth bass are a lot of fun at Dogtooth. Can catch some big ones. I am going back again in mid June of this year."
