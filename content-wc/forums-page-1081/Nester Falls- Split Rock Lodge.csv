The walleye's didn't move onto the rock reef's until later in the week. Since I am new to this area of lotw. Is this normal or we we just goofing up earlier in the week. The smallies were hit'n on just about every cast. We were using leaches and minnows but they hit the best on red jigs tipped with leaches. Any tips I can get would be appreciated.Thank you,Mark"
507351,wiggle,2000-03-08 20:58:00,400,"I have fished out of Nestor Falls for a few years now. Early June is a little bit early in the year. The last week or two of June and early July seemed to be better for fishing. We found our walleyes in weeds from 2'-10' of water. Even on calm sunny days. Mr.twisters alone or tipped with minnow, seemed to work the best. Using a Fishing Hotspots map, try Knoche Island about 3/4-7/8 of a mile east and a little south. You'll see some 4'of water with hazards marked. That is where I have done some of my best fishing for 17""-22"" walleye. Also try between the islands straight out from the government boat landing. One Island has an old power pole with on osprey nest on top. There is a saddle between the two islands. Jigging, or trolling Rapalas over the top and down the shelf, 1 1/2 hours before dark till dark is good,good fishing.Hope this helps some, and to others visiting the area..."
507352,Sprinter,2000-03-08 21:35:00,66,"Wiggle,Your suggestions are great! I guess I need to schedule my trips a little later next year.Thank you,Mark"
507353,KnottyBuoy,2000-03-09 11:57:00,110,"Mike, who owns Split Rock , is usually on the walleyes during the year......I think last year the pattern was off a bit but we usually spend a week on the island over the 4th of July and catch lots of walleyes.......If you get bored , throw some big plugs around the exposed rocks for muskies.....usually catch one or 2 a trip within rowing distance of the island......It sure is a great area to fish......"
507357,Dan,2000-03-09 17:17:00,325,"Having fished the area for over thirty years we have found early June to be excellent.We usually dont fish much deeper than 10 foot for our walleyes. We have had alot of 100 fish days ,my wife and I.Just remember to fish the wind and use gold spinners with crawlers and bouncers."
507354,Sprinter,2000-03-09 19:44:00,66,"Knotty Buoy,Mike wasn't available the first part of the week. But when he arrived from Minneapolis he was great help. I really enjoyed my stay.Thanks for your suggestions.Mark"
507358,Sprinter,2000-03-09 19:48:00,66,"Dan, Do you know if their is any limit on the amount of crawlers you are allowed to take into canada? I saw a posting that the crawkers need to be in bedding not dirt but didn't see anything on quanity.Thanks,Mark"
507359,Dan,2000-03-09 21:17:00,325,"No limit that I know of we usually take about 2 flats of crawlers. Be sure they are packed in Buss bedding or they will dump them at customs. If you dont like hauling them in you may be able to get a deal on a flat or two if you call Eastwoods bait at Nestor Falls.We will be there the same week ,hopefully it will be as good as it usually is.If you need more info email me"
507355,KnottyBuoy,2000-03-10 13:03:00,110,What cabin were you staying in?......really like the 2 that are on the water at each end of the island.....those are usually taken by the time we get there.......some of the biggest fish to be caught in that area come from right off the green marker in the channel....the boat traffic going by is a pain but the big fish seem to hug that area.....
507356,Sprinter,2000-03-10 18:06:00,66,"Last year we stayed in the cabin with the Split Rock lodge sign in the front yard. This year I think we have the 2 cabins on the other end of the island. Thanks for the tip about trying close the the bouy. I can use all the help I can get!!Thanks again,Sprinter"
