My question is can they use the US side to travel and then make arrests like they where doing???"
507391,RMB,2000-03-15 20:26:00,251,"Canadiens and U.S. folks are free to boat anywhere they choose on border waters, they can only fish however on the side they are licensed for. It is fair game tactics and they have zero tolerance.Funny thing is, there's just as many good spots to fish on the U.S. side! Watch your blind side !"
