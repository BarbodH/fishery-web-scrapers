507302,Guest,2000-03-06 13:59:00,0,I'm fishing Rainy this July 1-7-and would like to know if any of you out there have any advice/suggestions for me. I imagine I could eventually figure these guys out-but a few suggestions would be very very helpful from you gentlemen that have had on the water experience...I've made this querry before-but figure that asking again can only yield more results-more information-more help. Thanks so much guys!
507303,Guest,2000-03-07 09:54:00,0,"July is a good time to fish Rainy. Rainy is a big lake. Where will you be staying? Also, do you have GPS? Let me know and I can pass along a few spots to get you going. Also, don't forget about the smallmouth bass fishing. TGG"
507304,Guest,2000-03-07 10:33:00,0,"TGG-We are going primarily for the smallies-but walleye will also occupy a lot of our time...we are staying at Camp Narrows Lodge-we will be purchasing a GPS unit prior to the trip. Any help with location-baits-colors-presentations that have worked for you would be greatly appreciated...do you run a camp there? Thanks for the advice!>July is a good time to >fish Rainy.

I have fished McDonalds Inlet and did very well when fishing for W's. The North Arm is Rainy's prime smallmouth water. It's not known for good populations of W's. This area was hit hard by commercial fishing in the past. The smallies seem to have thrived in the absence of the Walleyes, however the W's are making a comeback. I'm sure the resort owners will provide up-to-date info on where to fish. I'm more familiar with the eastern area of Rainy (Swell Bay, Bear Pass, Baseline, Seine Bay and Red Gut) on the Canadian Side. This is prime walleye country as well as a good smallmouth area. These areas are quite a distance from your resort if you travel south down the main lake, but you can access them from McDonalds Inlet which would save many miles of travel. I'll email you with some more detailed information if you think you want to travel into the eastern area of Rainy. So email me and let me know. TGG"
507306,Guest,2000-03-08 09:36:00,0,"Tom, There is an adequate supply of walleye's within a few miles of Camp Narrows. Long boat excursions across Rainy and to other basin's are simply boat excursion's. Concentrate your efforts close to camp and maybe as far out as the islands close to little canoe river. Spend more time fishing and less time boating will put you on them. The 95 year class is real strong and and will weigh close to 4lbs this summer. These fish are easy to catch. ALWAYS fish the windy side of the lake and troll in 4-10' of water. Long line a gold hammered spinner with a crawler and a split shot. A husky jerk will take active fish. There are always shallow weed and structure fish in the wind on Rainy and they are easy to catch. Pay close attention to small isolated boulder islands that are surronded by 8 - 12'. These are magnets for huge schools of walleye's during this time period. I sometimes use a trolled or cast smelt imatator in the fashion of 1/8 asprin jig with a regular fluke not super fluke.The truely huge fish are generally a different beast all together. These fish are generally suspended with brief brushes with structure during the summer. A leach worked on a slip bobber on the inside turns of mainlake reefs will put you on a few big fish. Look in 20-30' deep for a big one. I use planer boards and down riggers to hunt for big open water fish with alot of success. Your host Tom should be able to point out where the walleye's were caught from the last group. Use this knowledge and start at that loction. If no luck move in the direction of the Main Lake (Turkey Narrows)slightly and you should pick up their trail again. With any concentrated effort your group will do wonderful on the Eye's.
