Were going this year the week of July 16. We rent a houseboat, tie on the fishing rigs and head out for a week. Its been great! My library of good walleye reefs is growing. The problem for me has been catching the eater size fish. Most fish have been between 20 - 28 inch class fish. I don't have the GPS Coordinates but I can help with location ref some of the named islands. If you want e-mail me to discuss further."
