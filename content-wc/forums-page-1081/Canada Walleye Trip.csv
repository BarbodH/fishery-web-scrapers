507193,515,2000-02-22 13:29:00,254,I am going to Manitoba or Sask this summer for two weeks. I live in Colorado and want walleyes and smallmouth bass. Please give me some places to check into for this type of fishing. Plan on taking mother-in-law who is my fishing buddy. I would like to show her a trip of a lifetime. Not looking for huge fish more numbers but wouldn't turn down an occassional trophy size. Any information on lodges in the area is also appreciated.Smokey
