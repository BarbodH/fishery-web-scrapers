507343,Guest,2000-03-08 18:55:00,0,"Okay lads time to give it up. This will be my first year fishing in the Winnipeg region and I'm looking for the hot spots. Up until now(coming from the east coast) it's been all flyfishing for trout & salmon, but this walleye thing has really tweeked my interest. Read some articles and talked to the odd local, and Pine Falls seems to be one spot I'll be checking out, as well as the mighty red. Boat no-problem, got me one of them so I'm looking for the kindness of your hearts to help me fine tune my search and point me in the right direction. Oh and the odd tip(jigg'in, troll'in, bait) would be appreciated...Tks....Skyrat"

Pine falls is located near the end of it, but they are found in abundance all the way to lake of the woods, where the river starts. One area that is really good is at the town of pointe du bois, north whiteshell. It's not as fool proof as some places, due to the large area of water and lots of sunken reefs, but if you invest some time into it, gather maps, hire a guide, it can be extremely productive, as well as extremely beautiful. It's also only an 1.75 hour drive.[font size=""4"" color=""green"" font face=""signature""]River eye[/font]"

What area are your accomadations? There are a lot of good drive-to lodges within 3-4 hours of Winnipeg, all offer great action at certain times of the year - If you are bringing your boat and are fishing in the Shield lakes/rivers, do get a guide as the reefs can put an end to a good trip!"

507348,Guest,2000-03-13 20:57:00,0,"Thanks everyone for the advice, I suppose being in a new place the best thing is just load up the boat, tackle box, snacks, and kinda watch the locals. From what I've seen and heard there seems to be no shortage of fishermen(& women) in the Winnipeg area.I expect the usual learning curve, as I mentioned it's gonna be a big change from flyfishing for atlantic salmon. Once again thanks, and if you see someone on the river who looks totally confused, stop me and let me know what I'm doing wrong...Skyrat.."
