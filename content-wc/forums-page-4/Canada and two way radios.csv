6750509,Wallychowder,2023-07-16 06:46:00,1567,All of my years of crossing into Canada i can honestly say I've never been asked if i had any Walkie-talkies ........lol.
6750535,Franco,2023-07-16 08:13:00,107,"This is a esoteric area of law administered and enforced by Industry Canada. I doubt Customs officers are even aware of it. Even if they are, they have no jurisdiction to enforce it. They would literally need to refer the matter to Industry Canada, which would never happen for all sorts of practical reasons.These so-called Administrative Monetary Penalties for unlicensed ham use are issued under administrative law (not criminal or quasi-criminal) and aren’t even enforceable by police officers, and certainly not by MNR. All this so say, I’m pretty sure you’re safe unless you’re being a really inconsiderate jerk on ham frequencies."
6750641,Clairebear,2023-07-17 05:41:00,937,Easily programmed to the 1 to 15 channels that everyone has used with the Motorolla radios. Well explained here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ_sSjPmQ08
6750659,tweedrules,2023-07-17 07:32:00,107,Thanks so much everyone for the info. Very helpful.
6750663,1shooter,2023-07-17 08:26:00,1493,We have tried several 2 way radios and have found this to work the best.https://www.cobra.com/products/mrhh3...39716054827070
6750831,Old Timer,2023-07-18 08:46:00,255,I have an ancient Midland hand-held VHF marine model. It's rechargeable and also can use a AA battery pack. No complaints. I've reached out to camps on Rainy six or seven miles away. Maybe they have towers that allowed that distance. I have no intentions of upgrading to something else. I carry it mostly for an emergency that hasn't happened yet.
6750433,Dukhtr3,2023-07-15 09:45:00,32,X2 on the baofeng uv-5r. They have crazy range. We use them snowmobiling in the mountains and they can reach a long ways. They do require programming but it's very easy to do. Sent from my Pixel 7 Pro using Tapatalk
6750449,Franco,2023-07-15 16:42:00,107,"Those things are 8w…they will definitely have the best range on the market for line-of-sight handhelds. I think you can replace the whip antennas on them too, which would improve your range even more. I should have gotten these."
6750453,Wallychowder,2023-07-15 16:54:00,1567,And there only 20 bucks ! Am i missing something
6750457,Eckohlt,2023-07-15 17:57:00,3685,I think your missing the tax!
6750469,Clairebear,2023-07-15 18:34:00,937,What's happening is that the manufacturer is clearing out all of the uv-5r radios and are launching a new 8r. Awesome deal for anyone that needs a two way. Like I said earlier watch some of the videos explaining them.
6750473,Dukhtr3,2023-07-15 18:54:00,32,U also need a program cable to get the most out of the radio. Sent from my Pixel 7 Pro using Tapatalk
6750499,Paul H,2023-07-16 05:09:00,1232,"What is missing is that in the US they are illegal for anything except Licensed Amateur Radio use. FWIW - there are numerous Chinese radios that will transmit on a LOT of freqs. that they are legally not allowed. I have no idea about legality in Canada, but would guess it is similar."
6750501,Wallychowder,2023-07-16 05:19:00,1567,"Well, Illegal or not for 20 bucks im in for half a dozen of em !!!"
6750505,GBS,2023-07-16 06:18:00,2271,"And...ditto for Canada as far as I can tell - you need their equivalent of a Ham license to operate the radios there. If the ones you have don't have an official sticker as being approved for use in Canada, you might even risk having them taken away when crossing the border. I haven't dug into whether there is reciprocity between the US and Canada to allow US license holders (HAM's) to operate in Canada, or vice versa. Just like not getting a fishing license, you are then open to confiscation, fines, and other punishments in either country. In for a penny, in for a pound - if you plan to use them unlicensed, why bother spending the money on a fishing license, either? (Or boat, drivers, etc....)"
6750507,Dukhtr3,2023-07-16 06:33:00,32,They are only illegal to transmit on the ham frequencies. It's completely legal to listen on them. The ham frequencies are a small band width. There are many other frequencies to use the uv-5r. I also know the uv-5r is very popular up in Canada for snowmobilers because they can use them on logging roads to talk to the truckers to make sure the 1 lain roads are clear to drive on.

6750295,tweedrules,2023-07-14 10:46:00,107,"For our Canada fishing trip this year we are going to a new area. Anyone on the board have good luck with 2 way radios that actually work. (long distances, through brush, etc)"
6750315,Mojo-NC,2023-07-14 11:56:00,1929,"It depends on how far away you are going to be from one another. The lake we've fished the most is 6 miles long with a river leading into it that is another 4 miles up to the falls. Ours didn't work very well on that lake. We used Motorola Walkabout 250 - they were approximately $180 for the pair back when I purchased them. They work pretty well if you are less than 2 miles apart, but otherwise they were kind of a bust."
6750345,Franco,2023-07-14 14:38:00,107,"I’ve had pretty good performance from my Midland GXT1050VP4 radios (5w US version), but I have limited expectations. I get about 3 miles of range out of them from the lake through some bush back to camp, which I think is about the best you can expect from these consumer type two way radios.If you’re communicating mostly across water, you should be able to get 4-5 miles with the midlands."
6750393,Skywagon,2023-07-15 04:50:00,1106,"Get 2 InReach units, you can text to each other from anywhere in the world."
6750395,Camoclad,2023-07-15 04:54:00,628,"Two ways are pretty spotty unless you are pretty close to each other. The inReach idea is great if you have the units and a plan already, otherwise it might be a bit pricey. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6750397,prov1800,2023-07-15 05:03:00,5010,Agree with Skywagon.
6750399,Clairebear,2023-07-15 05:06:00,937,"Baofeng UV-5R Lots of great videos, explaining this little unknown gem. Or the text reply never fails."
6750403,Franco,2023-07-15 05:26:00,107,"That would get very expensive. Inreach messages can also take up to 20 minutes to send each way, and cloud cover impacts transmission, so I don’t think this would be a practical solution."
6750411,Eandjfish,2023-07-15 06:44:00,4,"These suggestions are good. Definitely do it. When one boat finds fish - it is super helpful. Also great for coordinating other things - like head back time, mealtime or just where the f##k are you? They are very helpful to have up there."
6750419,cuamb,2023-07-15 07:15:00,203,Marine band is a good option. They are line of sight so the higher you have your antena the farther they will reach. 10+ miles is possible with a standard 8' antena.
