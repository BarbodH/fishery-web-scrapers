6750079,Eckohlt,2023-07-13 15:56:00,3685,"I'd like to talk to the new owners,and tell them to turn a few cabins into house keeping for us poor folks."
6750087,Franco,2023-07-13 16:20:00,107,"I go to Pine Portage twice a year and they do this - part American Plan, part housekeeping plan. It seems to work well. I have done both and like the variety."
6733813,krazyk711,2023-04-21 08:41:00,26,"Stormer is loaded with 18 to 22 "" eyes but in recent years getting anything over 25"" has been difficult..the days of lots of biggies is over..maybe its in a cycle.. Its got some nice pike but its not a targetable species because there just does not seem to be alot of them ??? For the amount of driving just go to minaki, aka english river/ winnipeg river .. its a great fishery for everything. Try caribou falls or haleys !"
6749897,Steve Comerford,2023-07-13 08:37:00,28,"Franco, I have also heard good things about Stormer, and am trying to book a trip for August of 2024. Because August can traditionally be a slower month for walleye fishing, I'd be very interested to know how your trip goes. If you could, please contact me after the trip. I'd appreciate your advice."
6749901,Franco,2023-07-13 08:47:00,107,"Hi Steve - I will definitely do so, though my trip is not 100% nailed down. I was going to fish a few lakes in the area, including Stormer, but I was going to base myself out of Red Lake. I’ll let you know if it pans out."
6749909,Steve Comerford,2023-07-13 08:58:00,28,"Yes, I was considering the same thing for August 2024; use Red Lake as a base of operations and fish several lakes. One obvious issue is the launch at Stormer Lake. Easy to launch a jon boat there but not sure if a boat my size could be launched. It'd be frustrating to drive all the way up to Stormer from Red Lake, fail to launch, and drive back. Also, looks like you might have to park on the side of the road, with traffic from the First Nations going back and forth. Some issues to consider. Thanks again."
6749921,Steve Comerford,2023-07-13 09:18:00,28,Let's get 10 guys to put up $100K each. I've made several WORSE $100K investments in my day......
6749941,Franco,2023-07-13 10:10:00,107,"Yes, honestly I’m not sure what the launch will look like other than my brother in law, a long-time Red Lake resident telling me it’s doable. I’ll be borrowing a square back canoe and a 6hp outboard to keep things simple so I don’t think I’ll have a problem…but a regular 16 or 18-footer might be tough."
6749991,Eckohlt,2023-07-13 11:41:00,3685,Who do I make the check out to???
6750025,Franco,2023-07-13 13:02:00,107,Just got word about two weeks ago that it sold&#x1f622;
6750043,Steve Comerford,2023-07-13 14:41:00,28,"Good thinking; you can launch anywhere. If I go, I'll be bringing my boat - a 17 foot Lund Pro Sport that is very wide and deep. 90 hp and full windshield. My roller trailer helps a lot, but the big issue is the depth of water and if the bottom is firm or muddy. It'll be an adventure one way or another..........."
6750051,Eckohlt,2023-07-13 14:59:00,3685,"Dam I had the check made out,just needed to write in to whom it goes to!Bummer."
6732877,RichA$1970,2023-04-18 11:27:00,1158,Is Stormer still for sale as I saw it listed along with Camp St Joe?
6732889,Eckohlt,2023-04-18 11:51:00,3685,"I heard great things about the fishing there,But American plan is out of the ? For me."
6732937,Franco,2023-04-18 14:26:00,107,Yep - stormer is for sale. Who wants to go in with me? $950K
6732941,Walleye2242,2023-04-18 14:42:00,263,wow...great place and great fishing. Would love to go in on that.
6732947,Eckohlt,2023-04-18 15:20:00,3685,Buy it Franco and turn it into house keeping plan!
6732949,Franco,2023-04-18 15:26:00,107,Fastest way to being single again that I could think of!
6732975,Eckohlt,2023-04-18 16:57:00,3685,"Single and broke,double whammy!"
6732981,Franco,2023-04-18 17:14:00,107,"Reminds me of my youth…But somehow “young, single and broke” seems better than “old, single and broke”"
6733135,Walleye2242,2023-04-19 07:36:00,263,YES....that is the main reason i have not gone. Like to cook my own food on my schedule. Of course....price would go down as well.
6733187,Eckohlt,2023-04-19 09:17:00,3685,"Yup I wanted to go there many times,but being on a meal schedule I just can't do it,plus ya gotta get out of there on Friday morn instead of sat."
6732147,kvman1959,2023-04-16 07:10:00,45,We are looking for a remote resort(only resort on lake would be great) or a resort that has drive to outpost cabins. There will be 5 to 8 of us possibly. This is for 2024.
6732167,Skyraptor,2023-04-16 07:51:00,291,Have you looked at Ghost River Lodge? They have an outpost about 15 minutes from the main camp. But the best part of it is you boat to the lodge. It is a drive-in with a postage. Worth a look: https://ghostriverlodges.com/
6732487,adempsey2.0,2023-04-17 07:48:00,611,"I assume you are interesting in traveling to Ontario? Nakina area? Savant? Armstrong? or more Northwest like Dryden, Sioux Lookout or Red Lake?"
6732531,kim n indiana,2023-04-17 08:46:00,62,"i'd look at some train in resorts. Some have cabins in middle of nowhere. 3 quick ones are shooting star, flindt landing, allenwater. There is also a place North of Sault St Marie that has like 9 cabins around lake that are boat in. Dogwood ? It just depends on how remote you want to get to get away from others."
6732539,Franco,2023-04-17 08:53:00,107,Stomer Lake Lodge fits the bill. I think it’s about 35 miles north of Red Lake on a good road. Direct access to two lakes. Only lodge on both of the lakes.
6732577,kvman1959,2023-04-17 10:32:00,45,I would be coming via international falls.
6732609,Franco,2023-04-17 11:45:00,107,"International Falls to Red Lake is about 4 and a half hours. Another hour, give or take, and you’re at Stormer Lake. Nungesser is also up there but there are 2-3 lodges on that lake. Now, I haven’t yet fished Stormer (I’m going up this August), but I hear it’s a great walleye fishery."
6732727,Bigtaproot,2023-04-17 19:34:00,900,I suggest old post lodge. Like fishing in the bath tub and nice people
6732739,MN_Moose,2023-04-18 05:30:00,964,"you might consider Jim's Caviar Camp on Caviar / Dogpaw, Southeast of Sioux Narrows."
6732841,trapsht,2023-04-18 09:26:00,28,Stormer is absolutely amazing. You will love it.
