6749443,Eckohlt,2023-07-11 03:31:00,3685,That 4 yr old stayed alittle to long in that border bar.
6749585,Ricky Spanish,2023-07-11 14:14:00,1298,I think my wife has deuced in at least half of those pulp checks. We no longer eat before travelling 502. That doesn't always prevent an e-stop but it's cut them way down.
6749849,turkeyriver,2023-07-13 04:14:00,80,"We usually make a stop at one of these pull offs as well. Has anyone ever been scolded by a cop, trucker, or construction people for using them as a restroom?"
6748993,Big Louie,2023-07-08 11:41:00,22,"Anone recently drive 502 and if so, what is the condition?"
6748997,Spurgery,2023-07-08 12:50:00,79,Was just up and down it last week. Few rough/bumpy spots but overall good.

6749071,walleyenewby,2023-07-09 07:17:00,36,Returned on it yesterday. Thought it was good.
6749111,BCNeal,2023-07-09 10:05:00,19,We were up in June. The 502 is the best it's been for years.
6749147,JDP,2023-07-09 11:49:00,1457,I agree with BCNeal.Just returned last Wednesday.Highway 502 is in the best shape in years!
6749299,Cgillespie,2023-07-10 10:51:00,120,"Was on it a few weeks ago and didn't have any problems. Our flight from Minneapolis to Winnipeg got canceled, so I drove from Minneapolis to Red Lake, trying to get there by dark. I greatly exceeded the speed limit and made some risky passes. Luckily we dodged the OPP and made it to Red Lake in time."
6749301,Lineman8,2023-07-10 11:04:00,3,Drove thru week of 6/24 - 7/1 502 was good overall until your 4 year old son decides to puke half way throughâ€¦ makes for good memories though am i right?? Safe travels everyone
