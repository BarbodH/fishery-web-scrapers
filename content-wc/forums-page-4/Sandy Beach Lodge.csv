6749917,Lip_Yanker,2023-07-13 09:08:00,116,"A couple guys I work with went 2-3 years ago. They said fishing was great on all spots they fished. If I recall, they boated a few 40'+ pike for the week plus several hundred eyes and buckets of perch. I didn't go, it's kind of pricey imo. I worked with one of the lodges owners sons for a few years, but couldn't get a ""friends/co-workers"" discount though."
