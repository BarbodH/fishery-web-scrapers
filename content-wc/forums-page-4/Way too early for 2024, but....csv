6750347,Old Timer,2023-07-14 14:45:00,255,"I have fished Granite, but it's been many years ago. Brennan Falls drops into the lake on the west side. Park your boat and fish the different pools from the rock shoreline. You'll catch plenty right there. Brennan Falls is one of my favorite flows in Ontario. Rusty will mark the map and you'll have good fishing in mid-June. Rusty used to provide their guests with a good-enough meal plan. It worked for me, but then I'm not picky. Maybe they still include the plan, but I don't know. Rusty's Fort Francis air base is right across the border. It's about as close a fly-out as you'll find in NW Ontario. Rusty also has a base in Savant Lake, but that's like another 200 mile drive up the road. Ideally, you're flying out of the FF base. I believe you made a good choice. I suspect you won't be disappointed. Give us a report after your trip."

6749401,SweetD,2023-07-10 18:37:00,243,"Second Slate Falls. No bass but lakes with Pike and Walleye and another lake with Pike Walleye and Trout. Great boats with floors and Honda motors + converting motors over to electric start. Absolutely best on time drop off and pickup we have experienced in our over 30+ years of going North. Camps are super clean with comfortable beds, electric fridge/freezers and generator to run some things including Cpaps if needed. Ryan runs a really organized and high quality operation. Lots of good ones out there I’m sure but for the money Slate Falls woukd be hard to beat. All 7 day trips under $2k.Just as another option and a place I have never been to before but would really like to one day is Kississing Lake outposts in Manitoba. Several multi-species lakes to choose from and prices in that $2-2500k range.Good luckPS - go fly-in and experience the bush if you can!!!! IMO nothing beats the seclusion, beauty and experience that a fly-in can offer!"
6749439,pjshorthorn,2023-07-11 03:10:00,5654,"Look into Vermilion Bay Lodge. I’ve been there many times and have my 2024 trip already planned. Really cool vibe with great cabins. I think the boats are 18 ft with 40 hp and a depth finder with Terrova trolling motor. Eagle Lake - has 8 different species to chase. If you want a change of pace you can take an easy portage into one of the lodges other lakes for awesome SMB ( no walleye) . Short 15 minute hike in. There are more portage lakes to explore if you are adventurous.Town is easy to get to -5 minutes- if you needed anything.A new sauna is now on the dock as well if you enjoy a sweat and then a jump in the lake Take a look at their website vermilionbaylodge.com and check out the blog on the website as well. Give Gord a call and he can give you all the info you would need including pricing and amenities. Note, pricing on website is in Canadian funds unless something has changed since last fall.Have fun researching your trip choices.PjShorthorn"

6749539,MrSimon,2023-07-11 11:10:00,922,"My advice is do a fly-in. As a general rule the fishing on a fly-in is at another level than drive-to lakes. It really is that much better! Personally the appeal of drive-to lakes is that I can take my own boat with all it's speed, electronics, and comforts. If you are renting camp boats, you lose some of that advantage. There is nothing wrong with drive-to places. I go to many and love them. BUT, if you can afford it, do the fly-in. It's such an amazing experience. You can always follow-up later with drive-to adventures, but I always tell people to fly first. You just never know what life will bring so get those memories locked in when you can!"
6750101,kevinvjacobs,2023-07-13 17:17:00,48,"Just want to thank you all for the insights! After our group discussion, we have booked a fly-in to Granite Lake with Rusty Myers, Fort Frances for June 20-24, 2024. If anyone has any intel to share, it would be appreciated! Have a great summer wherever you are! Jake"
6750111,Filthy oar,2023-07-13 17:46:00,8,"Good choice, I fly in with rusty myers on moose hunts in late sept, never fished granite lake so no intel there, Angie runs a great place .with 4 guys weight shouldnt be a big issue because i believe they will fly you in with a 208 caravan. First time i flew in with them i was a little concerned about the food package . My wife has a list in the kitchen junk drawer that we used for yrs on what to bring for food, so this food included thing was new to us. Once we got everything put away in camp, ****, angie sent with more food than we'd pack ourselves. Only thing we brought besides clothes and gear was a tote of snacks. And of course beer . Cabin was roomy and well kept. Boats were new alumarine with new yamaha outboards.. nice fish house solar lights hot showers,, you know,,, like home. Youll have great trip"

6749249,kevinvjacobs,2023-07-10 08:41:00,48,"We sure enjoy reading all the posts on Canadian fishing on here. We are a group of 4 from north central Indiana and are looking to do a Canada trip next year. Mainly interested in walleye, pike, bass, and maybe perch. Maybe June or early July? Not sure if we want do a fly-in or not, open to any suggestions. If not a fly-in we would need boats as well as lodging. It looks like the options are endless; that's why we are asking for opinions here. Thanks for your consideration! Good fishing! Kevin Jacobs"
6749255,adempsey2.0,2023-07-10 08:56:00,611,"How far are you willing to drive? What is your per person budget? Bass aren't found too far north, so if that is important then that will narrow things down a little bit. NW Ontario is generally better overall for fishing, but on average is a bit more expensive and likely a further drive for you compared to fly-ins from Nakina, Wawa, White River and Hornepayne. The Armstrong area has many great fly-in outfitters as well. I don't think it is a shorter drive than the Nestor Falls/Kenora area, but not sure exactly where you are starting."
6749257,ILScott,2023-07-10 08:59:00,139,"Kevin, To narrow it down even more answer these few questions: 1. American or Housekeeping. 2. Drive to, Boat in or fly in 3. Budget per person 4. Distance you would be willing to travel.( I go about 13 hours and I live in Northern Illinois) 5. Cabin conveniences. (running water, bathroom in cabin etc) Each person on here has a favorite place to go. I personally like my place it has all the species of fish you listed plus lake trout. But you have to boat in and go over a portage with all your gear, this is not for everyone. It is housekeeping which means you bring all your food in and no meals provided by the camp. It does not have running water in the cabins or bathrooms in cabins. Outhouses but it does have filtered water you can bring to cabin in buckets and does have a shower house. This camp is Wine Lake Camp and it is my sons and my happiness for a week."
6749265,kevinvjacobs,2023-07-10 09:06:00,48,"Budget +/- $2500 Bass are not #1, or even #2... just be nice for a change from W & NP We are located about an hour north of Indy. Thanks!"
6749271,kevinvjacobs,2023-07-10 09:10:00,48,"1. Housekeeping 2. No real preference 3. +/- $2,500 4. 12 - 15 hrs would be nice, but could do longer if it was worth it 5. Running water, indoor plumbing would be nice 6. Good boats and motors with good seats. Flat floors a bonus. Thanks!"
6749279,DeBo,2023-07-10 09:45:00,211,With some quick google map routing from near Indy it looks like you are a minimum of 12 - 13 hours to the border lakes region around International Falls. Showed 16 hours or so to Lac Seul. Just under 14 for Hearst in the region to the east.If it was me I’d be looking at Lac Seul camps that fit the budget for drive to options. Has the species listed and seems to be a fish factory year after year.For Fly-In the Hearst Air camps seem to have fishing on par with NW Ontario. No bass though. Little shorter drive but flights. Not sure how your group values that. Pym Island always intrigued me. Not sure if they are running that right now.Too many options for sure. Search on here and do some route planning on maps to get your drive distance where you want it.
6749285,7 Mag,2023-07-10 10:14:00,1887,"Kevin, I'm north of you and it takes me 12 hours pulling my boat to get to International Falls, i overnite there and cross the border the next morning. Lac Seul was mentioned, Eagle and Cedar will also have all the fish you've listed, I fish Eagle Lake and it takes me 15 hours to get home."
6749297,Cgillespie,2023-07-10 10:46:00,120,"We've gone to Cat Island Lodge the past couple of years and plan to keep going there. It's a fly-in American Plan lodge on Trout Lake, up 105 north of Lac Seul. No smallmouth, but unbelievable numbers of walleye. It's a trophy northern and trout fishery. I've got two 40 Northerns out of there. About $2500 person, which includes a guide."
