It appears that after Labor Day they no longer run the ferry to Sandusky so we will need to drive around the western end of the lake to Kingsville, Ontario. We will fish around the island, when the wind blows too hard will enjoy some laid back time, and scout around a bit for waterfowl hunting later in the year.If anyone has experience we would greatly appreciate suggestions on where or where not to stay. Likewise for restaurants or anything else. Any other helpful suggestions would be great too.Thanks!"
