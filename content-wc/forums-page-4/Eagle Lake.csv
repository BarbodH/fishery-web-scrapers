6750007,7 Mag,2023-07-13 12:22:00,1887,"Yes, i'll be there the last week of August, can't wait!!"
6750011,7 Mag,2023-07-13 12:28:00,1887,It is a pretty lake! The first time i went through there i was putt putt slow as well but then my graph was showing approx 6 FOW so no more snail speed for me that week.

6749979,7 Mag,2023-07-13 11:15:00,1887,"That's some shallow water, seems like last fall there was plenty of water in Canoe Narrows, i enjoy motoring through there. Thanks for posting John, i'll be there the end of August."
6749983,prov1800,2023-07-13 11:26:00,5010,"I normally go through there wide open but figured I'd better see how deep it was.We could use some rain,by Aug might be bare ground there.Remember you where headed to Eagle.Pine Beach right"
6749985,prov1800,2023-07-13 11:27:00,5010,I'll take a day fishing anytime
6749989,Eckohlt,2023-07-13 11:37:00,3685,Looks like the knife got dirty today.
6749993,Yellowfin123,2023-07-13 11:42:00,2182,"It was putt,putt, low my last time thru there cutting south , eagle is a pretty lake"
6749995,Eckohlt,2023-07-13 11:44:00,3685,"Every lake is pretty up there,,except sandy lake.."
6749997,prov1800,2023-07-13 11:47:00,5010,My knife has been with me 30+ years.Good for many more allthough blade is a lot thinner now.
