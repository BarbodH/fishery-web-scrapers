6750377,Rufous Potoo,2023-07-14 19:50:00,101,That poor lady would die if she even saw that she was supposed to get on a float plane.
6750387,Eckohlt,2023-07-15 03:49:00,3685,I would die if I don't get on a float plane!
6750155,SweetD,2023-07-13 21:06:00,243,"You are on vacation for cripes sakes!!! Coffee, Soda, Beer, Cocktails!!!! Enjoy yourself and you do you!!! I would not be skimping on any of my vices with a 130lb weight limit especially if food is part of the deal. We paid $400 for overweight this year (8 guys)…..$50 per guy. I Always tell my crew do your best and if we are over and have to pay a surcharge so be it……if you can’t come up with an extra $50 probably shouldn’t be traveling 800 miles to the bush for a fishing trip in the first place!I know that sounds gluttonous but after 30+ years of going North just don’t sweat the small stuff anymore!Enjoy your trip!"

6750249,stumcfar,2023-07-14 09:09:00,451,I bought a $5.00 heavy cardboard tube and use it each year to protect my rods. I take the reels off and pack in my clothing bag. Much cheaper than a fancy rod case.

6750293,Rufous Potoo,2023-07-14 10:44:00,101,I did figure one thing out about going on Canada trips. Tell your wife about them all at the same time. She can only be mad for so long. I know everyone else's wife is happy they go out and have fun but I got a Proverbs 21:9 KJV wife so it doesn't work that way for old Rufous Potoo.
6750299,proguidedream,2023-07-14 10:52:00,345,130 pounds is A LOT. ours is 50.

6750311,Peterpikes,2023-07-14 11:36:00,33,"Quality rain gear is a must. Pants and jacket. It can turn from sun to rain in a heartbeat, you want to be comfortable and keep your clothing dry. Even mid July will have colder 50 degree mornings, you want something that will cut the wind and keep you warm."
6749915,adempsey2.0,2023-07-13 09:05:00,611,"130# is a lot. It is probably the highest limit you will see for a fly-in. Especially with American Plan. Typically the limits are 75# to 100#, with food/drink!With American Plan you don't need to worry about weight too much. Most of the weight comes from drink and food. Lodges tend to have well equipped boats as well, so you won't likely need to bring a depth finder either, but always double check that.If you drink pop or beer check to see if you can pre-fly it in. I assume those are not included in the upfront cost and if they are available for sale at the lodge sometimes they charge a hefty fee (but not always, it can be at cost which includes the flying in ""surcharge""). You have to gauge for yourself based on how much you drink if it's worth the effort to bring in your own or not. Still, 130# is probably enough to bring it with you unless you drink a case of beer per day.While I prefer to be under the weight limit, most air services don't charge much for being over the limit. Something like $1 to $1.50 per lb, depends on the air service. Paying an extra $100 is often worth it. The biggest problem here is if there is enough cargo space left. So, it can be a bit of a gamble. An Otter with flying in 8 guests can get pretty full. Especially with us big guys! You don't want to have to charter a second plane to bring in your gear. If you go this route, keep the ""extra"" less important stuff separate so you can just leave it behind. For example, I often bring a case or two of bottled water due to convenience. It is not a necessity with a water filter. Those are the first to go when there is not enough room. Certainly not an issue with American plan.Re-wear your clothes. You don't need 7 sweatshirts and 7 pairs of pants/shorts. I typically bring 2 pairs of pants and/or shorts and 1 or 2 sweatshirts (depends on the time of year). I also own pants that convert into shorts. Those are great! Extra socks and underwear are worth it though.Leave your dirty clothes from the night before the flight in the car. Unless you plan on re-wearing them. Again, this is more useful for weight limits of 75# to 100# (with food!).Bring flip-flops/sandals/slippers.Bring rain gear.Don't bring a giant suitcase, unless that is all you have.Learn to Ranger roll your clothes.As for tackle, that depends on where your are going and what you are fishing for. With 130# and American Plan you should be more than fine. I am sure you will have plenty of weight to work with so you could easily allocate 20# to your tackle, which is probably more than you will ever need. Unless you are jigging for lakers with 3-6oz jigs.....For rod cases, if you have 1 piece rods I like the Flambeau Bazuka (the Plano Airliner or Deluxe Hard Rod case are similar). Also, you may be able to put the rods from your other group members in a single tube. Mine holds at least 10 rods and it isn't even the largest model. Some people make their own with PVC pipes, very viable but they can get heavy. For 2-piece rods, you can just wrap them all up in a bundle without a case and they should be just fine. Wrap a towel or something around them first if you are worried (unless you are flying commercially first, then I would definitely get a hard case). Otherwise, there are smaller cases you can use from Plano/Cabelas for 2-piece rods. Still, I prefer the Bazuka. Just don't hit the plane wing with your case when loading/unloading! The pilots do not like that too much. Reels are removed from the rods first of course. I pack my reels in a soft cooler, but have put them with my clothes or in a separate small Rubbermaid wrapped in cloth. Plenty of options for your reels. Depends on how many you bring.All that being said, you want to be comfortable and have a good time. So don't worry about it too much. You could buy a hand scale to weigh your bags so you at least know where you are at. I do that and slowly remove things (mostly tackle) as needed. You could also stand on a bathroom scale with your bags if you weight under 200 lbs (most scales go to 300lb I think).What are you fishing for?"
6749919,adempsey2.0,2023-07-13 09:14:00,611,That is correct! Hope you found it useful. I probably should update that at some point.
6749931,Rufous Potoo,2023-07-13 09:41:00,101,"Walleyes, Pike, Lakers, in that order. I am planning on buying some cheaper rods for these trips, I'm not risking my usual rods. I'm planning on walleye jigs and plastics, some pike spinner baits and spoons, some tube jigs and spoons for Lakers. With my hygiene level, I can get by with 2 sets of clothes if everyone else can. I go weeks without caffeine or alcohol at home, I can do it on a fishing trip."
6749955,adempsey2.0,2023-07-13 10:30:00,611,"What time of year? I am sure you don't need to worry about drinks too much. AP Lodges are usually good at catering to their guests. I wouldn't be too concerned about bringing your rods. Just get a case for them. Although, I don't own any rods worth more than $200 so I don't worry too much. Unless you are flying commercially. I think every time we had someone with a lost bag/rod tube/tackle bag. Eventually they did get them, but it is annoying. With those styles of fishing, you will be just fine with weight. Several dozen jigs for walleye, handful of spoons and a few spinnerbaits for pike and a dozen or so tube jigs for the lakers. I would bring weights for 3-ways for the lakers as well though, but depends on where you go as trolling may not be necessary. Jigging is often great, but I do like the option to troll. At 130#, you won't likely have to worry too much about packing."

6750053,farmnfish,2023-07-13 15:05:00,130,"I read this thread and was thinking about the weight of my tackle box, and it being fairly large. For walleye downsizing it would be easy, but i've got pike gear that just won't fit into smaller spaces. So I weighed the thing and it was 27lbs. A bit over 1/4 of my personal limit of 100#s.I was thinking, hummm need to downsize this thing. But then it occurred to me, this is tackle for my son also. Saved!!! Wheww that was close."
6750055,Franco,2023-07-13 15:10:00,107,Could also just stuff a bunch of spoons and jigs in your pockets…won’t count towards your gear weight that way&#x1f602;&#x1f602;&#x1f602;
6750073,Eckohlt,2023-07-13 15:49:00,3685,Out of that 27 pounds you might use 3 pounds of it.

6749843,Rufous Potoo,2023-07-12 23:04:00,101,I've never been to Canada but I got invited by one buddy to go next year. I thought my other buddy would want to go so I have two trips scheduled now. I googled tips for packing for fly-in trips but I was wondering if some of you seasoned veterans would have some good ideas. I know how to pack when there is no weight or space limitations but kinda lost about this. Thanks
6749863,Franco,2023-07-13 05:29:00,107,"1. Don’t expect to wear different clothes every day. Take fewer pants/shorts/shirts than you would typically take on a trip. I take a Tide pod with me now in case I run out of clean clothes. I’ll do a quick hand wash and I’m good to go. 2. Don’t pack a massive tackle box. This is the biggest mistake I see people making. You could easily get by with a small “weekender” type box/bag or even just a single big tray and a couple of packs of plastics. 3. Don’t overpack food and drink. This is another huge mistake I see all the time. Most people bring far too much food and drink which just goes wasted. Do the math on how much you actually need and then add a small “safety buffer”. 4. When it comes to extra “gear”, ask yourself if you’re really going to use it. Do you need 4 rods or will 2 rods do? Do you really need an extra 12V battery? How many cans of bug spray are you really going to use? Do you need landing nets and life jackets or are they provided by the outfitter?"

6749879,lassh,2023-07-13 07:27:00,553,Someone on this website has an excellent flyin checklist and a good list of flyin lakes. I think it was ADempsey. I've been doing flyins for45 years and have an excel checklist that I use year to year. If you are interested shoot me a PM and I will send it to you. I also have a food list. The food lists will vary quite a bit depending on the individual tastes of the group.
6749881,Rufous Potoo,2023-07-13 07:28:00,101,I should be more clear. We are doing American plan and we have a 130# limit which sounds like a lot. What rod case should we look at?
6749887,Bigtaproot,2023-07-13 07:39:00,900,Filter your water instead of bringing bottled. Coordinate between all participants so you don't need a sweep double up on things bring whiskey instead of beer.

It was A. Dempsey who was admin of the site. 130# is a lot of weight, especially since you won't be bring food. You should still pack reasonably so you're not hauling crap that you're not going to use."
6749893,Rufous Potoo,2023-07-13 08:03:00,101,Thanks for all the help so far. I'm a big fan of not hauling crap you don't need
6749903,Mojo-NC,2023-07-13 08:50:00,1929,"Our outfitter brought in a bunch of water and beer for us on the preceding Wednesday before our arrival on Saturday at no additional charge. They generally do a mid-week check-in to make sure everything is ok at camp for the group before you and they don't really have weight restrictions on the plane when there are no passengers. Otherwise, we tried to minimize the clothes we brought in and would wear our outer clothes several times. It's not uncommon to wear rain pants over your fishing jeans, so your jeans don't really get dirty at all. Without food, it should be pretty easy to meet your weight restrictions. We transport our fishing rods in a Bazuka rod tube. We have a portable fishfinder unit for every 2 guys in the group and have all switched to LiFePO4 batteries."
