We crossed at Thousand Islands, a large crossing complex with many agent stations. It was a two part crossing. Agents were at a tent for the first inspection of our documents located where your car could easily turn around and head back to the U.S.A. We held our breath at the next station hoping we would not get the dreaded blue box. We didn't but got a form where we were to keep track of people we came in contact with before our return the following Friday. Another hour and we were at our camp. We were the only three vehicles going through on a Sunday afternoon. Never saw that before. No questions about bait. Took about ten minutes for us all to get through. I had more questions asked coming back to the U.S.A. Not complaining. The duty free store that we stopped at on the Canada side had a dozen customers. Usually three times that many. We attempted one morning to get breakfast at the golf course restaurant where we played the day before and had to leave because we all didn't have our inoculation proof with us. Didn't need it to play golf. We were the only group in camp. Few boats on the lake. The usual loons, muskrats, beavers, geese, and a lone swan. In camp, turkeys, deer, and red, black and gray squirrels. In all a great trip. Campfires every night. The weather changed every day. Made it a challenge. Hope all you guys that fished this fall had a good trip."
