6750375,LittleBait,2023-07-14 19:34:00,37,Don't go more than 10 over
6750437,reddemon2,2023-07-15 10:28:00,255,Lol
6750443,biggamefisher,2023-07-15 13:25:00,540,"Most officers typically set a threshold at 15%......totally discretionary upon the officer though. So 100 would be 115, I cruise at 113 and haven't been stopped. It's not 10kph, cause 10 kph over a posted limit of 50 is much more serious than 10 kph over a posted limit of 100! Stay below 115% of the posted limit and you are most likely ok."
6749747,lassh,2023-07-12 09:20:00,553,"We'll be traveling from Winnipeg to Thompson next week. Its a fairly long and boring drive without a lot of traffic and a relatively low speed limit. How often do you see a speed trap on this road and do they typically cut you any slack on the speed limit? Any pointers for this trek? We'll be headed to Campbell Lake, one of the Dunlop's Lodge fly-in camps."
6749755,CincyPike,2023-07-12 10:22:00,9,Made the drive 11 times. Have never seen cops except when you get around grand rapids area. Been pulled over once going home and let us go with a warning. He just said be careful we usually travel in packs. Campbell is awesome. Good luck.
6749761,Skin-Man,2023-07-12 10:34:00,3,We will be making this trek next June.. About how long is that trek?
6749763,reddemon2,2023-07-12 11:02:00,255,"I was just up there in June and i set the cruise at 120 and had no issues, Even passed a few on the way. There was 2 working really hard just south of Gordon when you get on 6 from the loop in Winnie"
6749765,reddemon2,2023-07-12 11:05:00,255,Speed Limit is 110 except thru towns obviously
6750325,proguidedream,2023-07-14 12:36:00,345,"the speed limit is actually 100 KM/H on highway 6. given that, the safe zone for not getting a speeding ticket is normally 10KM/H, so you could do 110 with a fairly low % chance of getting a ticket. 120 is most likely getting pulled over with a ticket or a warning. anything above is probably a gauranteed ticket. its not saving that much time for what its worth pushing the limit that much. yes its when you blow thru towns without slowing down that the cops will normally hammer you."
6750327,proguidedream,2023-07-14 12:40:00,345,"eriksdale , ashern , and grand rapids could be hot spots for speed radar. and past grand rapids your viable to see a moose around any corner, so id think twice if you think you are gonna hit the pedal hard after grand rapids"
6750351,reddemon2,2023-07-14 15:36:00,255,I was just up there 2 mos ago and i swear it was 110
6750361,pjshorthorn,2023-07-14 16:22:00,5654,110 120 Name the movie. PjShorthorn
