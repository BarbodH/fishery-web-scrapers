I'd appreciate information on Twin Lake Outfitter VanPoele Lake camp. I saw one YouTube on the camp but any insight and impressions would be appreciated as well. Thanks in advance!"
6748011,Fishquest,2023-07-02 11:22:00,89,"I'll be in that camp one week from today for the week, hit me up after that for an update. I've fished Kag a couple times and its just a short boat ride to get to it and its a walleye factory. Easy to fish and big enough to never urn out of new water to explore."
6748081,Spartan1,2023-07-02 16:10:00,46,Thank you for the reply. I will be sure to hit you up upon you return. Best of luck with your upcoming trip and I will be anxious to hear what you have to say.
6748351,stukkie,2023-07-04 11:12:00,21,We've been there twice and going in early Aug. Excellent camp as Fishquest said short ride to the Kag for your chance for a triple header with the option of Van Poole if bad weather/wind is a factor. Fishquest I know you will post a report as I'm curious about the large fires to the east. Stay Safe
6748741,Fishquest,2023-07-06 17:16:00,89,"For sure when I return I'll make sure to get back for update. Looks like we are heading into a cool rainy week up there next week, i'm figuring the cold front will make fishing tough but still better than working."
6748823,stukkie,2023-07-07 09:28:00,21,"Sounds good, you know the area so it will be great and better than this heatwave we're having. The choke point 5 min west of camp was double header heaven for a warm up before heading to the Kag last year on Van Poele. Safe trip"
6749943,Spartan1,2023-07-13 10:14:00,46,What dates are going to VanPoele?
6749945,adempsey2.0,2023-07-13 10:17:00,611,"When I went to Kag the first week of July in 2014, the outflow from Van Poele into Kag was on fire! Tons of walleye and a 40"" pike the morning we went there."
6750001,stukkie,2023-07-13 12:11:00,21,"We fly out Aug 7, meal planning in check and started packing. Can't wait to go back. Stay Safe"
6750003,Spartan1,2023-07-13 12:13:00,46,Have a great time and let me know how you did.
