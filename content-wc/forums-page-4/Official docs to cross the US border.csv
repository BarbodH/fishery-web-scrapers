I had my 5 year old daughter with me. I provided a birth certificate only. That's it! They didn't even ask for the permission letter from Michelle, but it's still a good idea to have one. And no, it does not need to be certified as I read in another post."

Know that the rules will be changing next year for sure. Just some heads up for 2020 plans. There are 39 participating state agencies at this time. Here are Land and Sea border crossing for Canada. Here is a list of Canada/US Boarder crossing by land and Sea https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_o...rder_crossings
1326666,Guest,2011-07-06 16:16:00,0,I crossed the border U.S. to Canada and Canada back to the U.S. with just my drivers license two weeks ago...
1326818,danforth,2011-07-07 04:45:00,117,"Yes you can but by law but if they want more they can send you back under the clause, LACK OF DOCS, they can. The goverments have ask everyone to get Passports and/or travel documents but have not gave the officers any teeth to enforce the rules with fines ect. If you are driving 6 to 10 hours to go fishing in Canada I would not take the chance and get turned around after the money spent on the gas and a down payment for the lodge."

Any experience with this from anyone? Thanks"
2369785,Skyraptor,2014-01-21 05:45:00,287,Have read all the reports and the problems that some have while trying to cross the border with DUI's on their record as well as some long searches of people who have no records to speak of. My question and have not seen any posts on is when hunters head up to Canada and have their weapons to declare. I know you have to fill out a form and pay a fee to be allowed to bring your weapon in but have some hunters out ever had a problem bringing a weapon or been subject to longer searches? Going up in October 2014 to hunt moose.

4006810,alanexpup,2015-06-28 21:40:00,278,Hi. I did not know it but now to cross into Canada at international falls you need to show your U.S. Passport! We had it with but it was not handy. When did this new hoop start to get in the last time all we needed was the drivers license!

1110290,CI_Guy,2009-06-02 14:38:00,2114,The card is good for land travel only. If you are flying between the U.S. and Canada or Mexico you will need a full passport.

On the return, 2 of our guys had not yet received their new passports but did have their tracking #'s. The U.S. agent gave them non-compliant brochures and said that if they tried to get into the U.S. again w/ out having their new Passports, they may be subject to an extensive delay as they continue to cross w/ out the proper credentials."

So heads up...order that right off to get it on the road quick, or they soak you for $40 to overnight it when needed."
1304630,pstrohm,2011-05-09 11:00:00,1,My friend would like to join me in Ontario but has a DUI on his driving record in the US from 2007. Is it true that Ontario will not allow people to enter if they have a DUI/DWI on their driving record in the US? Does anyone have the specifics? Like... What if they aren't going to be driving in Canada but will simply be a passenger? Are all province rules like Ontario? Are they banned forever or is it for x years? Is there any way around the ruling?Please advise. Thanks.Paul
1324319,danforth,2011-06-30 03:38:00,117,"For a U.S. citizen to go to Canada with a DUI it is a felony per Canada law. It is not a felony for a Canadian citizen to come to the U.S. with a DUI per U.S. law. (This is why a Canadian can enter the U.S. with a DUI). A person must be charged and convicted for it to be held against you not just arrested and not charged and/or released BBBUUUTTTT hear is the kicker to this, if they want to they can send you back to get your court records if you were not convicted and it shows that there was some form of action taken against you on your record and they donÂ’t believe your story. For the most part only in rare situations will you be sent back to get your court records but it does happen? I hope this helps some of you. Never say never but the big one going to Canada is the DUI."
