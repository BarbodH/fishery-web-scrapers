I've been gone for a while and maybe missed it?I know this subject has been hashed and rehashed, but I've never heard of anyone from our several groups showing a positive on the spot check.Pooch"
6600494,Bill Krejca,2021-10-01 06:58:00,6100,"Yeah, i wondered after the fiasco we had several weeks ago. Since we tested on Sat. and they couldn't find us to pick up the samples until Tuesday, I wondered if the shelf life on the samples was still OK.I think the random tests were more of a political eye wink just to show that the govt was doing all it could to protect the people. With all the extra prep we went through just to get up there, I'd guess the positives found were close to ""0"". Bill"
6600560,guidedfishing,2021-10-01 09:59:00,531,"I tend to agree with Bill, this is all about the perception of doing something even if the something is fairly meaningless. I suspect if results were ever released that were accurate and pragmatically looked at we would find it is statistically insignificant. Also the fact that for those that were tested the length of time in population or where ever would of been no different time wise than those that were not tested. I suspect a honest on biased review would show little to no value was provided. As always follow the money, who has connections to switch health, the Canadian Gov't did not do this for free, Canadian tax dollars where funneled to switch health and its always interesting to see which elected officials have a direct or indirect financial interest in these companies. Bottom line, the perception as misguided or as beneficial as it may of been allowed us to get some fishing time in. Canada is a sovereign nation, you want to visit follow their rules, or don't visit. Pretty simple flow chart."

From what I remember they had just under 59,000 tests performed and had only 112 positive results. The official interviewed for the article acknowledged that the number were extremely low, and that rising Canadian cases were due to local spread and not American tourists."
