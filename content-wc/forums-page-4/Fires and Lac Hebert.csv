6743951,Lktrician,2023-06-12 08:24:00,32,Has anyone been able to flyin to Lac Hebert with Air Tamarac and is it still possible to drive to Clova.
6744357,Peterpikes,2023-06-14 08:34:00,33,"Spoke with Ceasars 3 days ago. They are in Clova too. They are safe for now, but the dirt road is closed. There are also restrictions in place regarding forrest access. They need rain in a bad way to get ahead of some of these fires. Praying they get it soon."
6744383,Freytown,2023-06-14 10:54:00,770,Just heard that the Gouin is reopened for fishing. Good for the outfitters and clients. FT

6746873,fishron,2023-06-26 19:40:00,317,"Freytown, It's a shame you trip was spoiled by the fires in Quebec this year. Our last trip with Air Tamarac as a fly-in service was out of Ste-Anne-du-Lac with Moselle-Natikim Outfitter. Ste-Anne is not as far up as Clova and is accessed on regular roads. They have a private territory that still may be open. Not the unbelievable fishing of lac Hebert but Sand Lake produced good catches for us and walleye to 30 inches. I just mention it as a possibility. They may be in the same situation as Clova."
