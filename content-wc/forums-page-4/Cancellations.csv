6749835,Lktrician,2023-07-12 20:53:00,32,Sorry to say my trip was cancelled. Outfitter offered all possible ways to move us to a different area then asked if we wanted to change the date. Unfortunately my party had all vacations set and could not change. Tamarac outfitter tried to bend over backwards to accommodate us but we couldn't work it out. We agreed to try again next year. Better luck to those who still have dates coming up
6749837,Peterpikes,2023-07-12 21:03:00,33,I’m sorry to hear that. What dates were you supposed to go. It’s to my understanding that the Gouin reservoir is open now
6746517,Lktrician,2023-06-25 11:54:00,32,Just wondering how wide spread cancellations happening now and if your outfitters are giving you
6746519,reddemon2,2023-06-25 12:20:00,255,Why would there be any?
6746539,Lktrician,2023-06-25 13:27:00,32,Sorry I should have stated I wondered about cancellations that are occurring in Quebec because of the fires
6746545,fishron,2023-06-25 13:31:00,317,I think the seriousness of the fires in Quebec have caused cancellations in the northwestern area of Quebec. Some of the footage showing the burning is concerning. So many of the fires are out of control Last week in northern Ontario we had smoke from the Quebec fires every day.
6746665,tweedrules,2023-06-26 05:59:00,107,We were supposed to fish this week at Lac du male on the Gouin. We were cancelled. We rescheduled for 8/21-8/26. We know August fishing can be difficult but we just want to get to the bush. Still concerned August can be cancelled but hoping every day. Lac du male was not available so we are going to East Bay.
6747349,Peterpikes,2023-06-29 05:38:00,33,Spoke to my outfitter yesterday. He told me there are close to 400 outfitters that are being effected by the very limited forrest entry.
6747443,NM_Trout,2023-06-29 14:12:00,1094,"I was at a camp 25miles NNW of Red Lake last week, and when the wind was from the N / NE we got a lot of smoke."
6747635,Obabikon,2023-06-30 11:19:00,2370,"I had one cancellation because of the the fires... I sent him a picture of it being completely clear. I would say NWOntario has less smoke/haze than most of the midwest in the US.I'll add that there were a couple days that the smoke came in reasonably thick, but that's it."
6747641,dhottle,2023-06-30 11:46:00,163,It's all about the direction the wind blows & current weather conditions.
6747881,Cgillespie,2023-07-01 12:52:00,120,"When we were at Cat Island Lodge near Red Lake a couple of weeks back, smoke wasn't too bad. It was far worse in Minneapolis than it was anywhere in Ontario."
