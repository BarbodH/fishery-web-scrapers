6707163,koondegrace,2023-01-16 17:39:00,6,Heading to to Wapeskapek lake at the end of May through Jackson's. Does anyone have any knowledge of this fishery? Thanks!
6707171,Eckohlt,2023-01-16 18:03:00,3685,"I'll say one thing,they have a very good website,sry can't help you on the lake."
6707177,koondegrace,2023-01-16 18:30:00,6,"Yeah, they've been great, and I know people that have gone through them. Not really worried about catching fish, just looking for some ""inside"" information that might lead me to some larger fish. If not, it'll still be a week away from my computer with my son in the boat fishing--the fish are a bonus. --Jeff"
6707181,Eckohlt,2023-01-16 18:44:00,3685,"I recall reading something about black currant lake having big walleyes in it,not sure if you fished that lake or not?"
6707195,koondegrace,2023-01-16 23:19:00,6,"I haven't, this'll be my first fly in Canadian experience. I heard Black Currant, Kathy, and especially Artery are exceptional fisheries."
6750637,koondegrace,2023-07-17 03:49:00,6,"Fantastic trip with Jackson's, unseasonably hot weather but plenty of fish. Crap ton on Northerns, a few over 40 inches, and many over 30. Walleyes were caught 1-2 at a time until we found what holes they were in. As far as walleyes, nothing huge, largest was 21"" caught a bunch of 17 and 18"" which were happy to dine on. Our party didn't have any real fishermen in the party and we weren't fishing really hard. It was a great time, lodgings were excellent, except that our water pump was out--so no showers--but the lake was nice. Looking forward to going back!"
6750681,KSjim,2023-07-17 09:26:00,88,"Black Currant does have big walleyes. Our group of six fished there again this year 6-25 to 7-1. Did not keep as good count as we did last time but the number of walleye 24"" and larger was as many per day if not more than our last 7 day trip where I think the number was 34. Topped by a 28.5"" pig caught by my son. The group before said they caught a 30"" walleye. Small lake, the 6 hp motors will get you anywhere on the lake in 15 minutes. We caught a lot of 30""plus pike while walleye fishing but no real big ones. A lot of reefs, outcroppings, long tapering points for such a small lake but they all seem to hold fish. The cabin, boats etc., was overall in good condition. We did have a motor issue, but Jacksons flew in a replacement. Good outfitter would recommend."

6750737,KSjim,2023-07-17 16:55:00,88,"Jackson's flys out of Lac du Bonnet in Manitoba. Black Currant is about a 150 mile flight, so they are flying further than most NW Ontario outfitters. But as somebody that is not opposed to asking for a discount, this is the first year we paid posted rates. They said their costs had increased too much to allow for discounts even for returning customers. Shawn Jackson is a good guy that runs a good operation. Our group will be back."
6750739,Eckohlt,2023-07-17 17:00:00,3685,Sounds like a Great Lake for above average eyes.
