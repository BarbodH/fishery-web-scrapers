6750009,Tristian5431,2023-07-13 12:27:00,37,Thank you for the well wishes. I also want to thank everyone on this thread. I got my first musky!!! I caught three in one day. All of them were caught on cliff lake. 35 incher 45.5 incher and a juvenile 20 incher or so
6750013,Eckohlt,2023-07-13 12:37:00,3685,"Nice sea monster,you must have told the guide where to go to get those muskies.hahaha"
6750017,emma17,2023-07-13 12:48:00,436,Congratulations- it's an awesome feeling.
6702411,proguidedream,2022-12-20 09:39:00,345,"diy boat in trip could go here, but youd need atleast 2 boats and 6 guys to make it worth it. https://www.unclemarksoutpost.com/ pretty good musky country there is also wileys point, same country.. big lodge with good food and different options for stay. musky opens mid june so dont book to early"
6702713,nitroman,2022-12-22 07:57:00,368,Better check the reg's! 2 guys got popped this last June for targeting Muskies out of season. We did catch 19 of them June of this year trolling small cranks for walleye.
6702717,prov1800,2022-12-22 08:14:00,5010,Lot of guys target them early saying there pike fishing.So legal to throw lures for pike which are in the shallow bays still through June.Ive seen spawning muskies many times in the first few weeks of June and have seen guys throwing lures and pretty sure they were after muskies.Just close the pike season till muskie opens and that will end that problem.
6702721,rockape,2022-12-22 08:28:00,215,All legal here! Usually my stay starts the Saturday musky opener or the following week.
6702737,prov1800,2022-12-22 09:45:00,5010,Legal in a lot of places.Just not here in NWO till 3 rd Saturday in in June.Hard not to catch them not sure how these guys got caught can pike fish at that time of year and they'll take about any lure.Iam ice fishing walleyes and catch them all the time.Just let them go if you get them out of the hole.Cant keep them anyways
6702821,fishin779,2022-12-23 04:00:00,63,I would 2nd the Witch Bay Camp ! Steve And Gail run a top notch camp and the fishing program is they have is fantastic!
6703535,proguidedream,2022-12-28 08:54:00,345,"if you think you can go sling musky baits out of season, and say ""im just pike fishing"" you are in for battle, and if they catch you boat a musky they are gonna stick you with anything they can. if you want to fish pike early season i recommend doing it with non traditional musky baits. use big spoons like the '5 o diamonds' or smaller jerk baits. pike love these baits, and they would not be considered a musky lure. i do not catch very many pike while musky fishing.. i do hoever catch lots of pike with walleye or bass gear. there is really no point to throw musky baits out of season, just asking for trouble."
6703573,prov1900,2022-12-28 14:21:00,544,"Indianhead Lodge on LOW. Great smallie fishing from the docks at camp, all the way to Whitefish Bay. Whitefish to Yellowgirl has tremendous musky fishing. Whitefish probably holds a record class 'Ski. In 2019, a buddy caught his first musky, a bonafide 54"" on a firetiger shad rap lol. We didn't target them last year as we were a week early but we booked the correct week for 2023. The smallies will wear you out there."
6703581,Fisherman Ted,2022-12-28 16:07:00,461,Give Matt Ryberg a call from Crawford's in Sioux Narrows. First class operation. Easy to get to. Great fishing. -FT
6703717,troutwater,2022-12-29 16:41:00,299,If you're not worried about chasing trophy muskie Canyon Lake would be a great choice. Smallmouth fishing is awesome and great for numbers of muskie. The water is also pretty clear if that matters to you.
6701935,IaDave14,2022-12-17 11:48:00,99,Witch Bay Camp on LOW.
6701941,Sylvanboat,2022-12-17 12:14:00,94,I would second kishkutena. Great lake. Plenty of lodges up there.
6702037,Tristian5431,2022-12-17 22:42:00,37,Those smallies are giants!!
6702049,Bill Krejca,2022-12-18 05:26:00,6107,"Yeah, cool, 5 portages in after working all day and driving all night. After setting up tents, we were visited by a fellow who managed a private camp on the lake. The camp was owned by Westinghouse(appliances, etc), and the company, by plane, brought in their best dealers, distributors for some fine fishing. The manager was from Quebec, of all places, a nice guy who shared that there were a few lake trout in the lake, also a very few large walleye, interesting guy. We caught a bunch of bass, along with the musky. Bill"
6702247,rockape,2022-12-19 07:39:00,215,"I've been fishing NWO for 20 years now. One week each June. I love to catch muskies, but I fish for pike, walleye, and SMB too. I'd say Cedar Lake is your best bet. John is the master in the area, and I saw Cedar on his list too. I'd say Musky dominate pike on Cedar. We caught tons of them either targeting them or just jigging and throwing small cranks for walleye. Biggest was 54.5. And there are great spots to catch a ton of smallies. If a friend of mine asked me to help them catch his first Musky, I'd take him to Cedar first, and Lac Seul 2nd. LOTS of skis in Eagle too. On a sad note, a friend of mine wanted to go to Canada with us for his first hardcore fishing trip. Covid hits. We end up going to Lake Vermillion in MN. Not an hour into fishing for skis, he catches a 53.5 incher! We never made it back. He passed away this August. I wish he had more years to enjoy what he accomplished, and tell the story to many others. You will get your first ski in 2023 and catch many others after that!"
6702257,ameoba,2022-12-19 08:04:00,105,"Paradise Cove in Minaki. The smallies are amazing, and the musky fishing is fantastic. Duane is a super nice guy and the rates and reasonable.https://paradisecoveminaki.com"
6702297,Yellowfin123,2022-12-19 11:22:00,2182,"i've seen a video somewhere where 3 guys portaged in with a small boat and outboard, it looked like what you are describing, 2 guys walking with the boat, it was WORK!!! I assume they came in from the north, looked like they hooked up a musky the 3rd cast in a small cove.. the airplane is a little easier and at least a couple outfitters even do day trips where they drop you on a boat cashe and pick you up that evening if you ever get a wild idea of that you want to bushwac back in there count me in, you lead the way, i'll carry the crap"
6702303,prov1800,2022-12-19 12:13:00,5010,Great first paragraph.But sorry to hear about your buddy.That sucks.
6702319,Bill Krejca,2022-12-19 13:44:00,6107,"Hey, Yel - Thanks for the comment/offer. Yeah, we came in thru, I believe Pine Lake, left our vehicles at the camp, one canoe w 3hp motor, and two boats. Since I'm now 84 years young, I'm afraid my portaging days are over, but appreciate the offer! Bill"
6702365,troutwater,2022-12-19 19:46:00,299,"What kind of accommodations are you looking for? Housekeeping or American Plan? Are you wanting drive to, boat in, or fly in? Are you bringing your own boat or do you need to rent one? My apologies if you've already answered this but I didn't see it."
6701815,Tristian5431,2022-12-16 19:10:00,37,"Hello everyone, I still haven't recovered from this https://youtu.be/0e8ht6QLXh8.... losing my first musky right at the rim! I am in the midst of brainstorming for lodges in Ontario in 2023. Where are you sending someone for a good shot at their musky. I really love fishing in Ontario in June because I am primarily a smallmouth nut and I love fishing for them shallow. Anyone have recs on a lodge with good to great small mouth fishing and an honest shot at a first musky. I am dying to get my first musky! thank you"
6701833,Yellowfin123,2022-12-16 22:15:00,2182,"you should look up lake kishkutena, about a 10 minute plane ride from nester falls ont, i think young winderness camp has an outpost cabin there and others do to like nester falls fly in outpost no walleye, just packed with musky and smallmouth, most musky in the 30's to middle 40's"
6701835,pjshorthorn,2022-12-17 01:22:00,5654,Take a look at Eagle Lake in NWO. It is well known for both species. A second body of water to consider is LOTW. I truly feel that Eagle Lake will be the lake that produces the next world record muskie. PjShorthorn
6701851,Bill Krejca,2022-12-17 05:12:00,6107,"I portaged/camped in Kiskutena back in the 1970's(?). At the time, it was loaded with muskie, caught 3 in one day. At the time, and assuming it continues, no pike were in the lake (lots of small mouth, tho). I remember drifting into a bay and seeing those long profiles gliding through the water, some memories just stay with you. Bill"
6701857,Tristian5431,2022-12-17 05:15:00,37,I read somewhere else about the same lake being loaded with them! Thank you !
6701883,prov1800,2022-12-17 07:04:00,5010,About every lake in the western part of NWO has what your looking for.The larger lakes would be tougher to fish if your on your own.I would pick smaller lakes your chances would defiantly increase and those smaller lakes hold large fish also.I always tell muskie guys to pick a small area on a lake wether big or small and work a small area get to know it before moving on.There are muskies all over.Fish the same few spots 2 or 3 times throughout the day for a feeding window.I see guys racing back and forth all day burning fuel for no reason going past spot after spot.Lakes in my area around the Vermilion Bay that have smallies/muskies are EagleIndian Lake ChainCedar/Perreault CliffThese lakes have awesome muskie and smallmouth fishing.
6701893,zenfish,2022-12-17 07:58:00,14,"+1 for Cliff Lake Resorts. I had never caught a musky and I landed 5, lost 5, and saw a bunch more there in July '22. Really reasonable prices, well kept place, and great people. Highly recommend."
6701899,NARDA 1,2022-12-17 08:20:00,636,"Birch Dal.birchdalelodge.com 807-227-5262 My group has been fishing here for 30+ years, while non of us are diehard Musky fisherman we have all caught Muskies, several of us have caught them while jigging for Walleye. The Smallmouth fishing is great also. Fish on the left was caught jigging for Walleye, the one on the right was caught off the dock at the lodge by the young man in the picture."
6701921,Yellowfin123,2022-12-17 10:01:00,2182,"I bet that was cool to portage in and camp there, avg day most of the time is 3-4 musky and 100 smallmouth"
6701933,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2022-12-17 11:47:00,629,"I would second ""pjshorthorn's"" recommendation, particularly the Ontario side of ""Lake of the Woods"". I'm a ""Plugpuller/Longliner"" around the Ontario, Islands, & have caught at least 1-3 various size Muskies over each of the last 20 years + my favorite yearly catch of ""Smallmouth"". Largest Musky has been 54+ inches & multiple 19""-21"" Smallmouth. Mounted 5 of the ""Smallmouth"" back-in the Fall of 2006. The Smallies & Muskies are only getting bigger each season!!
