Also if the wind is from the South, fish the north shore of that bay for walleye. Other than that, just fish any shoreline where the wind is blowing in for walleye. I like to slow troll spinners and minnows. When you find them, pitch some jigs tipped with chartreuse Gulp. The system is loaded with fish, you'll find them. Just watch other boats and copy their technique and you'll do fine."
