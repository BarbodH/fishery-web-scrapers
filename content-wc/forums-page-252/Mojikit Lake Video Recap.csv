We focused on pike most of the time and although we did get some nice ones, it was also a bit of a struggle at times. Can't imagine better walleye fishing though both for sheer numbers and size. Weird thing was fish of different sizes didn't seem to intermingle. You'd either catch fish after fish all 15-18"" or they'd be slightly fewer but much larger.Was a very fun lake to fish but it's BIG water! Personally I loved it but I suspect others might not.Cheershttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3MhwP5a2g"
