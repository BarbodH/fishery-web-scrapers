We leave on the twentieth of September for Wolfe Lake in Southern Ontario for a week of fishing we have been enjoying for over thirty years. If the conditions are right we will have good walleye fishing. Big smallmouth are a bonus and pike have been showing up in greater sizes the last few years. Regardless of the fishing, the camaraderie is priceless and we interject 18 holes of golf on those bright sunny days. Big group this year including the sons of some of our charter members. I'll post a report after the trip. That was an awesome fish Jon caught last June on Herbert. I'll be looking for that one next June. Have a good fall chasing those coyotes."

Fishing is nowhere near Hebert but as you said, the hanging with life-long friends, drinking and eating well, playing pitch, etc. is still fun. And maybe we can pull in an 8-10 lber or two if luck shines on us."
4207954,octanehi5,2015-09-17 05:55:00,1104,"good luck on your trip, Things a finally cooling down around here its time to check out the fall bite. All our plans for Hebert are already made,and my camp is full for 2016. Its one trip I refuse to miss"
