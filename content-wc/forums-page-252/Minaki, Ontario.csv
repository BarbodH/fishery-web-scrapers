4228522,DeBo,2015-09-28 06:47:00,211,Stayed at Paradise many times. The Paradise Park cabins are really nice and close to the water but be aware that there is a lot of boat traffic going by all day long and a few after dark. Paradise 2 is ok. I enjoy staying at Paradise 1 the most. 0 worries of big waves at the docks and it is really quiet back there. Great value for the price. Not really a place where the owners are gonna check in on you throughout the trip if that is important to you. Quality multispecies fishery with everything but lake trout available. You can burn as much or as little gas as you would like. You can do everything from open water troll a large basin over 100+ FOW to fishing boulders with 1-4MPH current in less than 5 FOW. It is really busy most of the fishing season within 5 miles of the railroad bridge. Gets pretty quiet overall in roughrock and you can find quiet water in big sand. Seems to be less fishing traffic south but you will still see boats and there are a fair number of cabins located throughout the system. I only fish for muskies so I can't help you with anything else. There is a special slot limit on walleyes due to years of overharvest. You will get mixed opinions as to whether or not they have made a come back.
