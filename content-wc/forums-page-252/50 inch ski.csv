On the next trip out with your self appointed "" Omnipotent Ruler of All Things Fishing"" you will need to have a coronation fitting of a Supreme Fisherwoman. Much ""sparkly jangly "" stuff along with a tiara and Barbie pole should do the trick. Scratch that.......me thinks that would mean no more homemade pies. Man, you are in a tough spot on this one. The heck with it. Just go with the replica fish mount for Christmas instead. PjShorthorn."

4253458,Karloutdoors,2015-10-08 19:36:00,828,"Now that's a quote.But something tells me the girls will hold on to their ""supremacy"" a bit beyond next spring."
4254074,bobbylfishermon,2015-10-09 07:20:00,241,"Karl, you are sooooo right, but everything is in FUN !! My buddies are Marine's too (old Marines) but like the one said, how lucky are we to have wifes that are as passionate about fishing (and shopping) as we are, and friends that we can share the FUN with!!! Our fishing trips are very special,especially since we're all 62-65years old (the girls claim they're 29), and Lord willing, the trips continue for many more years to come.... Thanks to all,,,, and tight lines..."
4257466,Karloutdoors,2015-10-11 13:20:00,828,Sounds like nothing less than great relationships all the way around. That is the foundation for many great memories.

4244618,bobbylfishermon,2015-10-05 15:40:00,241,"just got back from the Indian lake ""chain"" and as always had a great trip wallys were slow due to the lake turning over, but who cares we were in Canada (vermilion Bay, ON) the jiggers were doing nothing, so I went to plan B and started speed trolling, as fast as my flicker shads would stay down and got some nice wallys on reaction strikes, then the wife got a BIG reaction, a 50in. ski on 8lb. test. What a surprise, but I troll with Med. Heavy rods so she got the big ski to the boat in less than 8minutes and returned to the water safe and healthy!! She was truly a giant and in pristine shape, and is waiting for the next person to get sooooooo lucky... picture is in the albums!!!!"
4244938,wishinfishinmn,2015-10-05 17:18:00,52,Heading to KC's landing in two weekends. Which lake did the monster come out of?
4245042,prov1800,2015-10-05 17:50:00,5010,"Congrats to your wife on her muskie and welcome her to the 50"" club.really dont think the lake is turning over yet.with temps still at around 60f thats not going to happen yet.normally around 40f is when the water gets heavy enough to start sinking.walleye fishing is basically slow everywhere and fish can be anywhere in the water column right now.have been catching them in5-30' as of right now.iam suspecting another week or so depending on the weather which is on the mild side right now and forcasted to stay like that forcanother week."

4251154,bobbylfishermon,2015-10-08 06:15:00,241,"Hey wishin, that's my ""lucky fish'n"" hat, it brings good luck to everyone but this old fart and of course the Huskers, who could use all the luck they can get, that's another story altogether!!!!!!!!!"
4251178,bobbylfishermon,2015-10-08 06:21:00,241,"The wife, (Supreme fisherwoman, as she wants to be called now) wants to Thank you all...... ME, she says the lawn needs mowed, no respect!!!"
4251202,pjshorthorn,2015-10-08 06:30:00,5654,"You could causally let Supreme Fisherwoman know that with the fancy title comes the official duty of running the boat, getting the bait, loading the gear, launching the boat, cleaning the boat out, etc. etc. Then again, there may only be lunch made for one on the next trip if you bring this up. Tough choice........do you say anything or not? BTW......nice fish . PjShorthorn."
4251370,bobbylfishermon,2015-10-08 07:06:00,241,"Yo shorthorn, there's nothing casual about me, told her the same thing as you said, who was your guide, who's boat were you in, etc, etc, all she said, 8lb test mister and headed to the kitchen, I went out and mowed the lawn and to my surprise came into the house a couple hours later and had warm blueberry & rubarb pie waiting for me !! What can I say, she can talk smack all she wants, bring on the pie Honey, she knows how to get to me..... Thanks again...."
