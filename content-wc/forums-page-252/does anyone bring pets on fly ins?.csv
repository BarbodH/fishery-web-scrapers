4232306,ftfarms,2015-09-30 06:13:00,444,I'm interested also. On some info on this place.

4245402,Baseline,2015-10-05 19:29:00,3207,"Personally, I wouldn't go if you or anyone else brought a dog. Dogs are dogs and they like attention. What you think is an awesome dog is someone else's pain in the A$$. I love my dog and she is great entertainment for my family, but when I have guests over I usually put her outside or in another part of the house. Sounds like you or other members of your group aren't compatible. Being that you have a talent for organization, why don't you put together a trip for some guys who want to take a trip and bring their dogs."
4248282,johnboat,2015-10-06 19:23:00,2014,Sounds like the perfect fix to me.

Some people just don't like dogs, and everything that comes with them.But I'm confused, you think you are entitled to bring your dog along just because you do most of the work at camp?? You can still go, just leave the dog at home. And before the trip make sure guys have their roles spelled out. We do, some guys do the dishes, some clean all the fish, some cook, etc. etc.It is confusing to me why some people HAVE to bring their dog everywhere, I leave my wife at home, and my girlfriend too!"

4230946,Guest,2015-09-29 10:59:00,0,When you come to a site with some reasonable & intelligent people the advice you get is what it is whether you agree or not.
4230954,Aspencreek,2015-09-29 11:07:00,2911,"No, not really, this is common sense. You asked the question, and we are offering our opinions. If you don't like our responses then why ask. It is Not any kind of ""thing"", it comes down to the overall feeling of the group, camp owner and their rules, and repercussions if the dog is along. We all understand you love your dog, but it is still a dog, somehow that may have been lost.And lastly, you are saying that you are doing a fly-in, that dog counts toward weight limits and space, meaning everyone else has to do some sacrificing to accommodate your pet, that sound pretty self centered to me.We had several trips where someone else wanted to bring along their dog, we voted against it, and that person still came along."
4231178,123chadder,2015-09-29 13:44:00,429,once again there are zero weight and space limits for the plane! and i pay the motel as a thank you for having the dog along.... like i said the only ones with the problems are some people on this forum....its taken care of in our group....i took all comments into consideration and the group is fine with the dog coming.....OK?lol
4231194,123chadder,2015-09-29 13:53:00,429,"i took everything into consideration,then discussed with group and made a desision.....just like in real life"
4224954,SinOrSwim,2015-09-25 11:52:00,1528,"If it were a family trip, I'd take the dog because he is part of the family. But, if it's our guys trip I would never take the dog because regardless of who does what, those guys are paying for their trips too. It's just as much their vacation as yours. Sort of like what music is played. You try to find a happy medium. What about just going with you and the dog?"
4224962,123chadder,2015-09-25 12:03:00,429,cant do a fly in with one guy
4224970,LOW1,2015-09-25 12:03:00,2828,IMHO that attitude is an invitation to a miserable trip for all.If you are unhappy because you have been doing all the work for years you should fix that problem rather than seeking revenge on your tripmates via the dog.
4225074,123chadder,2015-09-25 13:34:00,429,"i guess i came to the wrong place with this questioni wish you wouldnt put words in my mouth,revenge on my friends?common man,thats sillyi just fixed the problem,i told one guy today that hes not welcome anymore problem solved..... thread over"
4225090,SinOrSwim,2015-09-25 13:38:00,1528,"or the right place to get a bunch of different viewpoints. Ignore the ones that call you out personally. But, you can also see a lot of people on here love their pets but would never take one on a group trip. I took my son on his first trip last year. We stopped a bunch of different places on the way up. Places I never knew were there or never paid attention to for over 20 years. Nobody in our group wants to stop and see the mine in Virginia, MN. But, my son did. I was amazed at the view up htere. Been going past it for over 20 years. Point being, that trip isn't just about me. We sort of do what is good for the group vs the individual."
4225098,ftfarms,2015-09-25 13:40:00,444,Why not just do a drive to lodge with the ones that are ok with the dog. I used to do fly ins kinda like the drive to places better or boat ins.
4225106,123chadder,2015-09-25 13:46:00,429,"its all good guys,the other guys are totally fine with bubba going,the only guy that really did is not going so problem solved!"
4226330,Guest,2015-09-26 15:54:00,0,"123chadder, I always find it funny when someone asks for others opinions, and when the answers are not satisfactory, they say I guess I asked the wrong person (in your case you claim ""I guess I came to the wrong place""). My question to you is, would you have come to the wrong place if everyone agreed with you? I think you are being selfish in having to bring your dog with, when this is really supposed to be a fishing trip for friends. You could take your dog on a camping trip alone by yourself and not have it impose on others you are with, because in the end your dog doesn't know the difference between a wooded area near where you live and a fly in trip to Canada! You won't keep many friends if you put your wants above everyone else and what they might want as a group. Dogs are awesome pets but you don't have to include them in every aspect of your life. I think you came to the right place, but didn't get the answers that you were expecting to get! I wonder if everyone who responded has any angling advice that would be worth a darn also, since we are all wrong on this opinion? Good Luck!"
4226426,dutchboy,2015-09-26 18:12:00,5717,Perfect response.
4227058,123chadder,2015-09-27 09:03:00,429,"like i said problem solved,i took the info i wanted to,if thats not satisfactory then tough titty"
4224058,Mike Borger,2015-09-24 20:06:00,1554,I brought my gsp on our family trip to Lodge 88 on Esnagi Lake this past August. First time ever she's been on a fly in and it was great. Made the trip that much better for everyone...
4224426,tv4fish,2015-09-25 06:36:00,2694,"Outpost owner - Excellent post (and something for dog owners to think about, for sure)."
4224458,dutchboy,2015-09-25 07:10:00,5717,"My opinion is leave the dog home. Not the groups problem if you don't have a girlfriend to care for it. Also keep in mind just because you talk to somebody and they indicate they don't have a problem doesn't mean they like the idea. Many guys won't argue about anything but they don't like things if that makes sense to you. Why don't you just turn over all the trip prep to others and just stay home with the dog? It seems the dog means more to you then the group of guys you go with. Seriously, this shouldn't even be a subject that needs to be discussed in my opinion."
4224506,Mike Borger,2015-09-25 07:30:00,1554,Have to agree with this.
4224594,123chadder,2015-09-25 08:28:00,429,"my dog poops by backing into a bush,he never poops in the open which is a great thing,plus hes a short hair and doesnt shed very much...plus im respectful and cleaned the cabin from top to bottom,hes outside till dark so little time in cabin,only when its raining"

4224826,MassillonBuckeye,2015-09-25 10:20:00,661,"What if everyone wanted to bring their dogs? Maybe you should take the dog somewhere else before or after your trip if the others aren't thrilled about it. Maybe they feel a little animosity because they felt they couldn't bring theirs yet there you are with yours? I like to look at things like ""what if everyone did it"".. Do you really want ""Dog Camp""? Maybe if they were all super well behaved.And the topic does need discussed if he wants to discuss it. Who are we to say what should and shouldn't be discussed on a discussion forum? Pretty rude if you ask me. I think comments like that add zero value and don't have any place here. He wants to discuss it. Others are happy to discuss it with him. If you don't then....... Don't?"

Unless you're being asked to care for the Dog, how could it be an annoyance?If you hate dogs, get in your boat and fish. You won't see the dog until dinner time, in which case, you will be cooking, cleaning fish, prepping sides. After, you will either go back out fishing or drink beer. How can a dog bother you if you are drinking beer?In short, I still think it should be unanimous among the group, but I also think people have sticks up there you know wheres."

4223018,rzep,2015-09-24 09:12:00,1196,"I took my dog twice to Ontario ... problem I had is that dog has strong prey drive and had to watch for him not to run into the woods. Once he locks on the scent is hard to get him off it. One time it was not bad as we were on a small island outfit, on the Eagle Lake. So if he got lost there was no place to go. Other time, was somewhat pain in the ***. On the upside, I was told that the dog is the reason I got my first Musky. Over lunch I had the dog do retrieves from water to burn some energy off around noon time...once we were done I start practicing baitcasting with my new setup , preparing for afternoon trip .... On the second cast , I felted a resistance and pulled 42-44 inch Musky right off the shore... same place the dog was just swimming back and forth. I was told that likely the commotion of the dog in the water drew the Musky in ... the dog was just over 40lbs so Musky likely left it alone ....I still got a pic somewhere of the musky ... need to find it ..."

4223298,btyreprich,2015-09-24 11:37:00,1067,"First of all, the guy that owes you $ should be told under no uncertain terms that he has to pay last year's bill before he even thinks about going in 2016. The other guys on the trip will certainly support you on that statement - unless they want to cover the amount from the other guy. I myself would not bring my dog to Canada and get covered in ticks and other insects. Yet I do understand that you - and the dog - get great satisfaction from being on the trip. Will give you great memories to cherish. I suggest that you only bring the dog if all members of the group are in favor of the pet being there. Just my two cents worth."
4223314,123chadder,2015-09-24 11:52:00,429,"thanx for the advise everyone...i think i have enough to make a fair,logical descision"

4223730,Guest,2015-09-24 17:15:00,0,"As an outpost owner, we always try to accommodate our guests to the best we can. One year, a group of guests asked if the could take their dogs to the fly in outpost. I like dogs and did not see any harm so I said it would be OK. They were medium size dogs, smaller than a Lab. Friendly dogs too. Everything went off without a hitch. Until change over day when I flew the next group in and picked up the the Dog group a week later. That night we got a call from the new group and they voiced their concerns. Dog hair all over the cabin. On the floor, on the sofas and on the beds. Not Cool! One in the group had a light allergy to dogs too. Also, the dog owners let the pooches do as nature intended and poop all over the outpost grounds. We had to fly in the the lake the next day to pick up the group and bring them to another outpost. Apologize immensely. Discount their trip for their inconvenience and not fishing at their preferred lake. They also pointed out, what if someone had a severe allergy. Good point I said Also we flew back to the original outpost to perform a very thorough cleaning In the end to help one group, it costed us and the next group. Lesson learned! No more pets. This year, had a group request to take along their dog. I explained why we now don't allow it. They said fair enough and still came fishing with us. At the end of their trip, they told me it was probably a good thing they left the dog at home. They figure it would have been more trouble than benefit in the end. Just my story. I'm sure others have a different story to tell. Just sharing with the masses. Keep Calm. Fish On!"
4221674,v-bay gord,2015-09-23 14:34:00,3168,I'm getting the impression that the dog isn't really the problem here.............
4221682,123chadder,2015-09-23 14:36:00,429,what do u feel the problem is
4221746,Bakefish,2015-09-23 14:57:00,1077,That thought crossed my mind also.
4221866,123chadder,2015-09-23 15:49:00,429,is it me?
4221882,ftfarms,2015-09-23 15:57:00,444,I would never ask him to go again. Everybody does there share and pays there share. That's how it goes in our group. We all enjoy helping each other.
4221890,123chadder,2015-09-23 16:02:00,429,i love everything about camp life!itsxtruly a great experience
4221970,Guest,2015-09-23 17:00:00,0,"I think the problem is the others don't have the same love for your dog as you do. I totally get where your friends are coming from, I think the things that bother them about your dog whether its him running around or simply being extra baggage that makes their trip less relaxing for them, are things that don't bother you (I don't know) but, I don't think I would want a friend of mine to bring their dog either (and I do love dogs). I think taking a pet with is more of a family trip type of deal. You could always go with just your dog too! In the end it should work out in a way that everyone is happy (unfortunately when you have more than a couple of people involved, its hard to get everyone to see eye to eye). By the way your buddy that does not contribute should not be invited, if he doesn't what to do his share (I wouldn't allow that). I do know this, fishing trips should always be fun, if it isn't, then you have to change what made it not fun the next trip. Good Luck!"
4221994,v-bay gord,2015-09-23 17:10:00,3168,I would suggest trying a trip without the dog and see if it makes things run smoother. I love dogs but they are mine and others may not have the same appreciation. It may be clouding your judgment on some aspects of your trip. That's what I'm thinking......could be wrong of course.
4222586,Ogoki,2015-09-24 04:33:00,291,"My wife and I would not consider a fly in without our two chocolate labs . I would not consider putting them in a kennel while we were gone either . I also would not take them with a group as not everyone likes dogs . I would not even consider going on a fly in if there were small children coming along . In fact am very selective about the adults I go with. One trip somebody asked a fellow to get a bucket of water, while the guy asking was cooking dinner for the group , the guy being asked to get thge water plainly stated that he didn't come up there to work as "" he was on vacation"". Guess what he was asked to go again either."
4222682,SinOrSwim,2015-09-24 06:36:00,1528,"If you do everything for the trip like buy food and do all the arranging and don't go............seems to me they either won't go or they will have to figure out how to put all that together? I'm not sure I'd want someones dog on a fly-in and I love my dog. I see both sides on that. As for that other guy? If he owes you money, don't let him go until he pays up. We have guys that don't drive boats and don't clean fish. Some do dishes, some don't. If I loan gear to someone, I don't expect a lure back. If I felt someone wasn't buying their own stuff because I have mine..........I just wouldn't loan it anymore."

4221106,LOW1,2015-09-23 10:04:00,2828,Only with group approval. And the consensus should be unanamous (sp?) or close to it or you will likely have problems - it's their vacation too. But any group member that feels it appropriate to scare dogs with firecrackers should be excommunicated.
4221426,Mark R,2015-09-23 12:47:00,1538,"I thought firecrackers were illegal in Canada. we have been asked at the boarder before if we had any, we didn't. If a dog comes on a fly in is he part of your weight limit or is it a group deal? I guess I would vote no. Maybe, it depends on the dog & owner."

While you may think ""he doesn't really bug anyone"", he must bug the majority of your group if they voted him off the island. Years ago a friend wanted to bring his springer on a drive in trip to Canada. I didn't mind but the only way he talked the other 2 guys into it was by paying a full share of the trip expenses for the dog as if he was another fisherman. I hardly noticed the dog being there but the 2 who didn't have dogs decided after that trip they never wanted a dog on the trip again."
