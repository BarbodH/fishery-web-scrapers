Got myself an old Savage Arms .410 and brought it along with me in the hope of shooting a few grouse on the way. No luck on the Grouse. It was kinda cool because the camper you see in the video that is parked upo by the lake was none other than the guy who ran the PAL course, we had a good discussion before I headed off. No birds coming in or out, but landed three nice Splake on a #2 Blue Fox spinner. Tried the slip bobber right off the bat but could not get the hook to stay in. Lost a really nice one and saw quite a few follow the bait in. I know this is a walleye site, but Canada to me is sooooo much more than the outstanding walleye fishery it undoubtedly is, wanted to share is all VIDEOhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeT-hcRiPRo"

I did not realize that splake were as colorful as the one in your video. It is one of the few hybrids that can reproduce under some conditions. Are they stocked in your waters?"
4239042,Limeyangler,2015-10-03 08:15:00,563,"Thanks! They are stocked in that lake, quite a few stocked lakes in the area. I never knew that they could reproduce, interesting stuff, thanks for that."
