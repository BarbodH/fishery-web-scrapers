4202178,pattmit,2015-09-14 17:02:00,36,Thanks for all the updates. Looks like another great week ahead. Can't wait
4202434,AllenW,2015-09-14 18:29:00,11482,"We hit Red in late Sept for over 30 years, which meant a trip down the river to Gullrock, small ones were in that 8-12 fow and bigger were almost always deeper, sauger we found in 50 fow but they'd blow up like balloons when brought in, so unless your looking for shore lunch, maybe stay in under 35 fow. Bill I see you beat my buddy Terry, good show, they win quite often, so nice to see ya keeping them working hard. Congrats. Spent many days fishing with them over the years, least till the annual trip died. Gulls a good lake, and this time of year there's usually less people up there. Al"
4238106,tyeegs,2015-10-02 19:22:00,177,So how was the trip???
4241378,Guest,2015-10-04 09:15:00,0,"Got back from Gull rock last night. Fishing was the slowest in last 15 years. Fall is 2 weeks behind. The lake has not turned over as yet. We started the week with water temps at 61 and ended the week with water temps 58. Never had a night below 35. They had a freeze early Sept and then a warm up. The mosquitos were bad at night. We have never had mosquitoes this late. Biggest walleye 26 and 2 Northerns 36. We still caught a lot of fish, but had to work hard for them."
4192089,pattmit,2015-09-09 19:23:00,36,Headed up next weekend to Gullrock. Looking to hear about the water temps and the weather update. Good luck to anyone fishing up there. It can't come soon enough for our group.
4192121,Pat T,2015-09-09 19:51:00,221,"Me to Pattmit. It's the best 8 days of the entire year. And I get to spend it with my Son, and great friends. And the fishing part is pretty cool too."
4192665,strength22,2015-09-10 07:18:00,49,I use to go up in September for quite a few years...fishing was laways great and weather was perfect..chilly..love it. Fall colors rolling out..best time of the year up there. Gullrock use to be a pretty hot topic on this site but have noticed it doesn't seem to come as much as it use too.
4193977,johnboat,2015-09-10 14:49:00,2014,"And that's just the way I like it. Let them go to other lakes, all the better for us. Don't worry, you'll have a great week with plenty of fish. But remember.........shhhhhhhhhhhh."
4194289,Guest,2015-09-10 18:06:00,0,There was a tourney there on sept 5-6 lots of walleye caught.Some pretty big ones.In 29-33 feet of water off humps and points
4194473,bergsh,2015-09-10 19:35:00,183,Mr Spence would know. Congrats on your win
4194721,Guest,2015-09-10 22:08:00,0,thanks
4195009,strength22,2015-09-11 06:59:00,49,Exactly...let them go elsewhere. Gullrock is the best drive in lake I have ever been too up there. Always stay at wright's. Lee and family are the best.
4195937,pattmit,2015-09-11 15:00:00,36,We love the lake and Wrights Camp. Some in our group have been going for 30-40 years. Anyone up there currently or recently that can tell me about water temps and water levels? Less than 1 week!!! Hope ya'll saved some pigs for us. Thanks for any info
4196425,tackleman,2015-09-11 19:06:00,444,"from the looks of your last post, you didn't get the message I sent you. temps have cooled down the past couple days, it was +3 this morning so I am assuming the water temps are dropping fast. 4 days ago it was 66, I haven't been out since then . fish were in 25 to 30 feet and on the points and reefs, it is supposed to war m up for the next couple days so you should get some good days in drive carefully, watch out for the moose."
