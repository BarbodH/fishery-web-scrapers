Funny thing is, they gave you change in Canadian dollars at par. Now, that's how you make a buck! Serious about the fees and change, but joking about you changing your currency."
4236490,itsme,2015-10-02 08:06:00,31,Any one know how long the check is valid? I would like to cash it next Aug on our next trip. I have not received it yet.
4236602,pjshorthorn,2015-10-02 08:43:00,5654,I've stared at our rebate check three different ways till Sunday and I can't find an expiration date on it anywhere. Since it is issued from the Canadian government it should be good until they fold up their tent or run out of Loonies making change for US dollars. PjShorthorn.
4236626,tv4fish,2015-10-02 08:51:00,2694,Something I found:
4236690,pjshorthorn,2015-10-02 08:59:00,5654,Free up to $1500.00 with acceptable ID. Printed on the back of the check. PjShorthorn.
4236778,Hump,2015-10-02 09:41:00,578,I think this is what we used to get at the border store. How do you get it now?
4237074,phishfearme,2015-10-02 12:54:00,1242,"yah, I recall this but I think it was back in the days of the PST rebate which you could get at the border when you return and this is now gone. it's changed to a rebate of half of the HST (Homogenized) which is half of the 13% HST charged in Ontario. to qualify for the rebate you must be a non-resident and have a receipt which shows that you've paid for temporary lodging plus one other service such as air service to a fly in lake. you then fill out a form and send it in. if you pay the HST in US dollars make sure the receipt says this - otherwise you will get Canadian dollars equal to the amount of US dollars you paid with no exchange. some operators allow you to avoid all this and only charge you 6.5% at the time you pay your bill (I think they require at least a 20% deposit also) since the package they provide clearly qualifies - some outfitter don't do this. phish"
4239562,Obabikon,2015-10-03 12:09:00,2370,I also didn't raise my prices when exchange rates reached all time lows.
4244066,Bad Santa,2015-10-05 12:12:00,100,"I took my check to Walmart in Dryden. They took it as long as you spent about 70% in the store. We made our grocery purchase for the trip, and spent the whole thing. No exchange rate BULL, no Bank fee BULL, fresh fruit and vegetables for meals. No other store (beer store, liquor store, bait store, gas station ) will take them."
4235186,mms3rd,2015-10-01 15:35:00,148,"I was so excited when I got the ""found"" money. More husky jerks. Now my bank tells me that it costs a fortune to cash the check since it does not appear to be in US dollars. It says that I can cash it for free in Canada. Not going for a while. Maybe Gord can cash it for me and send me the paper money? So, now what?"
4235282,v-bay gord,2015-10-01 16:00:00,3168,I would be happy to accept it as part of your deposit on your next trip to VBL! The other option is to find a bank that will at least deposit it to your account without a ridiculous fee. I deposit U.S. checks in Canada all the time......even at the Credit Union in V-Bay. .....by the way Bobby's was selling off Husky Jerks for five bucks Canadian! What a deal...I bought a couple dozen....
4235434,HeHooksHimself,2015-10-01 16:55:00,725,"Hmm, I never thought I would see ""Bobbys"" and ""great deal"" in the same sentence."
4235442,Knutson21,2015-10-01 16:57:00,348,"I cashed mine at my bank a month ago. Just received letter from bank on Friday, they adjusted for exchange rate at 73 percent, plus charged me $10 for foriegn check fee. Total money deposited for $149 dollar check was $100. I can't expect $149 when it is only worth $110 American. It only makes sense, doesn't seem worth complaining about."
4235498,Ogoki,2015-10-01 17:20:00,291,I also received a rebate check. I signed mine and turned it over to Mattice Lake Outfitters towards my deposit for next year. My bank gave me a big song and dance and I just told them nevermind.
4235522,mms3rd,2015-10-01 17:30:00,148,I was told to expect about $5 in part because the check was less than $300. Sounds like I need a new bank. I understood the currency rate and the payment of some international fees...not that I would be left with pennies on the dollar. Maybe V-bay should have charged me more.
4235602,v-bay gord,2015-10-01 17:55:00,3168,"The only way I could only get away with charging you more was if I put my rates in U.S. $ ! People just ""love"" knowing how much it will cost them......"
4235706,phishfearme,2015-10-01 18:43:00,1242,"this issue has been debated on this board many times in the past - see for example:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...&highlight=HST it's easiest for the customer/client to only pay half right up front and not go thru what you are experiencing - some outfitters are ok with this and some are not. you may be labeled a ""difficult client"" if you ask for this option. if you get the rebate check - always in Canadian funds - the best bet by far is what Ogoki does (and we do) which is to sign it over to the outfitter for next year's trip - either as a deposit or as part of the final payment. phish"
4236154,Obabikon,2015-10-02 04:55:00,2370,"But you'd need to LOWER your price by 30% right now. Unless you just wanted to raise your price by switching and keeping the exchange rate the same. That wouldn't be very ethical, but some have done it in the past."
4236298,v-bay gord,2015-10-02 06:43:00,3168,"Agreed, it wouldn't be very ethical, and pigs will fly, and camps charging in U.S. $ will lower their rates when the exchange reaches all time highs........"
