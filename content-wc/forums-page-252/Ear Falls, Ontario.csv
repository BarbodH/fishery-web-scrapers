Flow was huge and the wind was blowing 25 to 30 so boat control was tough. The water temp was still in the low 60's so the fall migration was not in full swing. We did manage some very nice fish and once the wind calmed down and one of the 3 gates was closed, the fishing improved nicely. Our biggest walleye was 26 1/2"" but lots of 24-25"" eyes. Big northern was 40"" and 20 lbs. The weather was great other than the wind."
