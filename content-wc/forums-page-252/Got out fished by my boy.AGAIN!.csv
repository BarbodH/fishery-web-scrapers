We ddi not get any but I took our rods and some bait so we could fish too.Fish we did, and my boy put on a shore fishing walleye clinic! Very good feeling to see my boy enjoying his hunting and fishing so much, only a few more years and he will be out with his own buddies, gonna make the most of this time together, pure gold!VIDEOhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhK1gxzq0S4"
