4250674,yoopertrout,2015-10-07 19:26:00,1172,"One thing to keep in mind - brook trout are very easily over-exploited. This is why so many lodges in Labrador require catch and release. Ontario seems to be going more that direction, but slowly. If you see a website with lots of dead brook trout pictures - it may already be too late. My wife and I went to a drive in lodge, and two other groups that we know also went. Lots of big brookie pictures on their website. No one caught big brookies. Most of the photos seem to have been from the first year or two the lodge opened, and I think many of them were the owners' family members. No one has mentioned that lodge, so I won't name it. But, if you are looking for a quality brook trout experience, look for a lodge owner who is committed to catch and release. And, help the cause by releasing your catch. Good luck, and have fun!"
