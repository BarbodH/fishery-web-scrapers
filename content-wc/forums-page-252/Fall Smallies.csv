4252858,prov1800,2015-10-08 14:12:00,5010,As mentioned lots of bass lakes.summer time tactics aint going to cut it this time of the year.if you know the chain lakes and know where the mid lake humps are thats where you will find them right fairly deep 15-20ft.if you find some it will be loaded with them.jig and minnow or a lindy rig.i was on a trout lake early this week and the smallies bit like crazy but we were looking for walleyes.lol.they were tough to find but we found them shallow.the myskies that we saw and caught were mainly in weed beds which were actually pretty green yet.very surprising. Bucktails did not work good.best lures we used were the krave jr and a krane baits worked slowly.good luck.got to keep the little guy entertaint.
