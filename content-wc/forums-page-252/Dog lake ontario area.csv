4203017,danforth,2015-09-14 22:47:00,117,Are the mayflies usually done the end of June in the Dog lake Ontario area and what is the fish pattern like by then? Are they shallow or have they gone for the deeper drop offs and breaks.
4203338,Fisherman Ted,2015-09-15 06:57:00,461,"Not sure where Dog lake is, did you mean Dogtooth lake?Either way, here in NW Ontario (Lake of the Woods/Kenora area) there are multiple hatches in the summer. The largest and first is as you said in mid to late June, more or less. Millions of insects emerge and the fishing is....dynamic.To answer your question the fish are usually still very shallow. All species, walleye, bass, pike etc. This is one of the few and rare times that you can catch a walleye on a fly-rod top-water although last week my guests were catching them with skitter pops and the like which again is rare.The trick with the hatch (for spin and fly fisherman) is to identify the nymphs before they spin and hit the surface. This is tricky but critical for your fishing success. The first sign is the fishing slows considerably sub-surface, at least with conventional lures and the like as the fish are gorging themselves on the nymphs sub-surface. Look for nymphs on rocks coming out of their shells. That means they are coming up and you have a few days before all **** breaks loose on top! The fish should still be shallow so I find beetle spins work great on a spinning rod and wooly buggers on a fly-rod. Then when they erupt it can be crazy fun. Top-water is the key and again is very cool to be able to catch a 30 inch walleye sipping may-flies at night. The walleye will almost always take them after dark while other species all day long.Some fishermen fear the hatch but if you play your cards right, identify it coming and change your approach it can be absolutely killer.-FT"

With the camps having openings then is there somthing im missing or is it a busy time for most people and they are not booking then?"

4242362,[emailÂ protected],2015-10-04 18:10:00,21,"I have been going to ON for many years. Specifically to the Chapleau area the last 18 years. I have found the main mayfly hatch can run from mid June thru early July. I depends a lot on the winter and the spring weather patter. The main hatch is based on water temperature. I used to worry a lot about the weather and mayfly hatches. I've learned to pick a week and go for it. You can't control it. My opinion is you are better off if you luck out and fish about the second week or later after the hatch. If you are there during the hatch you can still catch fish, but you will need to change your approach, and the time you fish. If you are there the following week after the hatch you won't catch much, as they are full! If you are there during the hatch, start fishing mid evening and don't plan on stopping until midnight or so. Although the mayflies come up from the bottom of the lake, you can be extremely successful on the surface. When the surface of the lake looks like it is raining hard I use any 4"" hard bait that runs near or on the surface. Normally you can catch walleye as fast as you can get one off and get the hook back in the water, during this time. Daytime can be a little slow. I've never fished dog lake, but I've fished a lot of lakes in that area. I always do a fly-in with either Park's Fly In Fishing or Canadian Airventures. Good Luck."
