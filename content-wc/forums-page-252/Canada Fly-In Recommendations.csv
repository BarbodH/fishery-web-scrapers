4235106,Chevelle38,2015-10-01 15:09:00,5,I am looking to go on my first fly-in trip next year with my fiancé and have it narrowed down to a few lodges below. I was looking for a lake that provided decent numbers to keep my fiancé entertained but also a lake that is going to provide larger sized walleye- a good balance of the 2. Timeframe is June. I was looking for peoples' recommendations/opinions/experiences? Uchi lake Lodge Booi's Lodge on Trout lake Thunderhook Lodge on Smoothrock lake Bull Moose Camp on Upper Goose Lake Sydney Lake lodge Thanks!

Now that I am 85 years old I had to reduce to once a year. Took my grandson this year and he caught lots of big walleye. Biggest was 29 3/4 inches. I tried ti pull that last quarter inch but it wouldn't give. We also caught several @ 28""...26""...24 etc. Our best day was over 100 boated. Wore me out. But a good wear out. Tom and Shara are super people and they have just replaced all 2 stroke engines with new 4 stroke very quite and easy to use. Good luck on your trip. ITSME"

Cabins are first rate, 2 bathrooms, great accommodations. Boats are very nice. First rate operation.Sportsman's lodge on Little Vermilion is a great lodge to take your fiancee. great fishing for big pike and lots of nice walleyes. Nice cabins and boats. Run by people who know how to run a Canadian lodge.Bauer's Onaman Lake Cabins, The cabins look very nice, I have not stayed in one but have seen them. I have fished Onaman at least 20 times over the years and it is an outstanding lake for walleye, and some fine pike fishing. This lake's walleye size is impressive. These three lakes are very easy to fish with very good numbers and excellent size. The accommodations and operators are first rate. Great trips to take your fiancee."

We basically had a A-frame log home to ourselves. It can get a little expensive if you want to eat all your meals in the lodge. We had them purchase most of our breakfast and lunch items and they were waiting for us in our cabin and ate most of the evening meals in the lodge. We were catching 25"" walleye withing minutes of leaving the dock the first day. The guides go out everyday to cook shore lunch. They will let you know where based on the wind, weather and all you do is show up and drop off a fish if you want to partake. This was a good way to learn the lake, just follow the guides out each morning, it is a large lake."
