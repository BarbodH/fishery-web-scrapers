4250658,bigcreekdad,2015-10-07 19:17:00,74,"Fission Got it. I know what you were looking at. However, the river levels there are controlled by the Chaudiere dams 10+ miles upstream (or east) of Lochaven, not the rapids you were looking at. These dams are the primary control of the Lake Nippissing water levels. The rapids you saw from Crane's, as well as Pine rapids you referred to flowing down a bit closer to Wolesely Bay, are uncontrolled. I completely agree with you on water levels affecting the Crane's area fishery, but, in my experience, it has been high water that really can affect it. I'm basing this on an average of 3 trips a season for the last 11 years. I HATE the high water. I think the water level marks you were seeing are from the pollen lines annually, which usually occur in normally higher water Spring levels. I hope I'm not coming across as even remotely suggesting you don't know what you were talking about, but I can easily see why you would feel the way you did given the one visit. Honestly, I would not write off the Crane's section of the French. Especially if you are after early season BIG walleye. I have been really pumped to see the numbers of large walleye caught there in early season ( opener to mid June) regardless of the water levels. The high water issues, for me, are when they continue later in the summer, and are related more to bass and muskie. On the other hand, maybe I should keep my mouth shut. Oh well, I'll never give out specific spots, but I have no problem promoting a fishery that was, justifiably, maligned over the last 30 years, but is making a nice comeback."
4220538,bigbuckfisher,2015-09-22 22:03:00,6,hey guys and gals me and my father are planning a weekend trip to the French river for some eyes this early oct wondering if you guys can give me some advice on where I should go/stay . lower French ? upper French ? any help would be greatly app . please pm me you'd like
4223626,larry0418,2015-09-24 15:29:00,16,"I did the French River thing a few years ago about mid- Sept and compared to Northwest Ontario, it was a waste of time and money. My wife and I were going through the area working our way east to Niagara Falls. We stayed at Wolseley Lodge and even hired a guide. We failed to catch a single walleye. Only caught a couple very small smallmouth. It was so bad, my wife's first shore lunch in Canada was sausage, potatoes and beans and she still reminds me of it. The cabin we had ranks as one of the top three worse cabins we have ever had. Don't like bad mouthing anyone, but just an FYI."
4223946,bigbuckfisher,2015-09-24 19:04:00,6,I know there is good fishing for eyes there . any more advice guys ? Upper or lower ? What lodging would you recommend I do appreciate the reply
4224378,Mike Borger,2015-09-25 06:18:00,1554,"I have much more experience fishing the lower, it's a very good fishery! Have never stayed there but Cranes Lochaven Lodge is in the right part of the river and I've heard good things about it.I've never fished the upper French but ironically will be for 4 nights in early October. We'll be staying at Chaudiere Lodge. I never book anything without researching it to death first and I've heard great things about this part of the river and the fishery there. Wolseley is downstream from there below the unnavigable Chaudiere dam. The water above the dam connects directly to Nippissing eventually and by all accounts is very pretty with low boat traffic.Have talked directly to people who fish there regularly and the fishing is great for walleye, musky and bass.I'm going to target musky while I'm there but plan on fishing some walleyes as well. fwiw I was told to bring larger minnows along with me for the walleyes. Not surprising for an October bite fishing colder water..."
4224930,bigbuckfisher,2015-09-25 11:47:00,6,Thanks I appreciate the report
4225490,bigcreekdad,2015-09-25 18:22:00,74,Mike is right on about Crane's....awesome place.
4249682,Mikep007,2015-10-07 11:27:00,77,"Been going to Ontario for 15 years, French River Upper and Lower, last 10. My current favorite is Lunge Lodge at www.lungelodge.net. I've heard all the gripes about the fishing quality and how the NW is so much better but when you are in Ohio, going to NW Ontario every year is always a travel challenge. If you are a decent fisherman, you'll catch them on the French - bass, walleye, pike, musky, perch, catfish, drum, suckers lol. Check it out."
4250266,fishron,2015-10-07 15:18:00,317,"I took a large group many years ago to fish Cranes on the French river. The lodge is beautiful and in the fall the river would be free of jet skis and such. The problem we had was that they had just let the river down about three or four feet, evidenced by the water marks on the rocks across from the lodge. The area was very picturesque but after the drawdown we caught few fish above the dam. Toward the end of the week, my buddy and I discovered that the pools below the dam, which we fished on foot, were lousy with walleye. We limited in no time. We never returned due to the realization that the water level fluctuations could ruin the trip. I believe the potential of the area to produce great fishing is there. To me it would depend on the stability of the water level near the lodge. Good luck."
4250418,bigcreekdad,2015-10-07 16:37:00,74,Fishron.....what dam are you referring to in the Crane's area?
4250578,fishron,2015-10-07 18:16:00,317,"As I recall, when we had our meals at Cranes, we looked out at a distant shoreline, several hundred yards where we could see the waterline on the rocks. To the right of that area was the beginning of an area that the river followed that in my memory was able to be adjusted as to the rivers level. I can't say with certainty that that was the case, because we never checked out the method that was used to lower the river. What I am sure of that by some method they had drawn the river down, it was late June, and the result was that the fishing above was challenging to say the least. We beached our boats on that shoreline and found the walleye were stacked in the lower pools. We only made one trip to the area and my opinion is based on the trip we had. In that regard, I can't speak with the knowledge of those that know the area much better than I. As I said, the area had the potential of being a good fishery but for us on that trip, I hold that the limited fishing we had was due to the drawdown. If those that are more familiar with the French, and this drawdown does not occur, disregard my assessment. I'm only one opinion."
