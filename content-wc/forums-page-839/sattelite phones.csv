535581,doc,2003-11-04 06:27:00,143,I was on a trip in northern Sascatchewan and some gut had one. I used it and was very impressed. You need a straight shot to the sothern horizon but the clarity was good. I think he paid $100/week. Fed Ex from some place in Florida.
535584,jcass,2003-11-04 12:52:00,255,I've used them for three years now on canoe trips into QUebec and Ontario. THey did a good job. Never had a problem. A friend in THunder Bay rented them for about $75US a week plus minutes used.
535586,Ivy,2003-11-04 13:43:00,556,I rented one from satphonestore.com this past summer. 305-633-9636 They are located in Miami. I don't know if we got the best deal or not. They fed-x'd the phone to me and we rented it for 2 - weeks. Two weeks was $80.00 plus overnight shipping and insurance. And all calls placed were $1.75 per minute. Took the insurance ( $45.00) because any damage or loss or theft and you owe the Sat store an additional $995.00 for the phone. At the end of the 2 weeks I think I was billed $145.00 including phone calls. And I overnighted the phone back. Phone worked good. I brought it in case of an emergency. Ended up calling home and getting told how much fun I was having and how the kids were driving her crazy. It was a comfort knowing that we had a life line though. Ivy

535657,Guest,2003-11-13 13:46:00,0,We used Outfitter Satellite out of TN. You can find them on the web real easy. The cost for 10 days was around 150 including minutes used. Good deal. Great service. Talking to the wife...sucked. Not the phone's fault;-) Bob
