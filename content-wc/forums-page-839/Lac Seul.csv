535819,MrEyes,2003-12-04 05:06:00,360,"Rich Right now I am leaning towards bringing my rig up there. I am from Southeastern Wisconsin. How long does it take you to get up there? Also if you see a Burgendy 620 with a black motor, that will be me. What do you guys do for food/drinks when you get off the lake? I hear some people go to town and grab a burger and beer? Mark"
535840,2 DOGS,2003-12-04 18:12:00,361,I just go to Rich's cabin!!!! You did catch fish the one day I took you!
535847,Rich J,2003-12-04 22:18:00,65,"Mark I live in central Iowa so I have no idea how long it would take from Wisconsin, possibly some others in your area can help there. We go across at International Falls and it is 4 hours to Ear Falls from there. We mostly do our own cooking and like 2Dogs says we eat well. I have talked to some that say the resturant in the Trillium Motel is good. Talk to Pat and Gary for some other suggestions for places to eat. I just buy my beer at the LCBO and have it at the cabin when we come back in."
535850,MrEyes,2003-12-05 15:45:00,360,"I'll keep an eye out for you guys. Sounds like you'll be coming home when I'm going up. I wish there was a week between our trips, then I would pick you brains for a pattern. I am pumped to go back to Canada, I fished Canada for 4 years with 3 different lodges. I will be bringing a buddy who is a virgin to Canada and I would love to see him enjoy the fishing....or should I say catching!!! Good luck I hope you guys have the best year ever!! Mark"
535851,2 DOGS,2003-12-05 18:25:00,361,"Since you won't be there to drink Rich's beer maybe I can help. Think jig & minnow or jig & leech and SHALLOW! That time of year we have found the best fishing to be in less than 5' of water especially if you're in Sawmill. If the lake is as low as last year, be careful going into Sawmill. You best get a map from Gary and have him mark the route for you, or better yet follow someone that knows the way, or better yet, hire Gary to guide you for a day or two. Even in high water years there are a few places where the water gets a little thin. The Trillium is the best restaurant in town, they serve liquor also, you can get meals at the golf course, (if you have plenty of time). There is a liquor store in town and if I remember right a case of beer was about $26 Canadian. And there is a Mercury dealer 45 miles to the north where you can buy props and lower units. Just kidding! Take it easy and follow the maps. P.S. even the campowner (and others)hits rocks on occasion."
535754,MrEyes,2003-11-26 12:12:00,360,"I am going to Evergreen at the End of May, I was wondering if someone could give some fishing tips. I have a buddy that went there last year and he said to fish (I think) by a water fall or fish sanctuary. Anybody know where this is? He said it was near the lodge with heavy boat traffic! I guess if its by the lodge I would not need to motor my rig to far! Also what about the other lakes in the area, Can I fish these lakes If I bring my own boat....is that leagl? Mark"
535758,Guest,2003-11-26 17:40:00,0,"All you have to do is follow the other 50 boats that are heading to the sanctuary. I'd guess the distance is about 1.5 miles from your camp. During May you can't go beyond the mouth of the Wenasaga River, which is the sanctuary, June 1st,then you can go up the river to the waterfall which your friend was referring to. Jig & minnow or jig & leech is all you'll need. Taking your boat to other lakes is legal, but chances are you won't want to."
535766,MrEyes,2003-11-27 10:19:00,360,"Mr Peeps Thanks for the information. I was under the impression that the fish sanctuary was open after May 15th. I must have been given some false information. When I was asking about other lakes, I thought there was a good Lake Trout/Smallmouth lake in the area. Lake Vermillion maybe..?? Reason being my buddy has never caught a Laker and I figured maybe we would try a little of everything! I have not herd anything about Smallmouth on Lac Seul do they have any of these brutes? Or is the lake a Walleye/Northern lake? Mark"
535767,Guest,2003-11-27 11:34:00,0,"There are smallmouth in Lac Seul, just not many on the western end of the lake. No lakers in Lac Seul. Cliff lake on highway 105, on the way to Ear Falls, is known to have some lakers. Red Lake has lakers. Contact your camp owner and tell him of your wishes and he'll give you plenty of ideas. That end of Lac Seul you're pretty well limited to Northern and walleyes, what a shame, huh!"
535773,MrEyes,2003-11-29 19:11:00,360,"Peeps, Thanks for the information, I look forward to ""only being able to fish for Walleye and Northern"" I hope Lac Seul is as good of lake as I hear. Mark"
535775,Guest,2003-11-29 20:11:00,0,"There are smallies to be taken on that end of the lake. Smallie fishing would be more like fishing at home. About 1 fish p/hour. The last 2 years I have caught quite a few and the largest was 19"" They will hit just about anything from spinner rigs to northern spoons."
535787,Rich J,2003-12-01 20:48:00,65,"MrEyes May 15th is the opener for Walleye in 2004, You cannot go past the signs at the mouth of the river until after May 31st. You said you were going the end of May, depending on the weather the mouth can be slowing down by then. Opening week is usually good there but you may have to contend with 20 to 30 other boats. There are plenty of other places to catch walleye, I would recommend trying Sawmill if the mouth is busy. Gary at Evergreen will give you a map with rocks marked on it. Of course you can find others but these are in the more traveled areas. Talk to him as to where the channel is and what to watch for. Stay in the channel when going out and coming back and go slow in unfamiliar areas and you will be ok. The level of the lake will naturally change things you just have to be carefull until you find where rocks are at. We have dinged a couple of props but never ruined a prop or lower unit. I have hit more rocks on other lakes, maybe I have just been lucky. Gary will also point out some of the better places to fish and has them marked on the map. We have been to Lac Seul twice a year for the last 8 years and the fishing has always been good. If you are taking your own boat and need to charge your trolling battery(s) be sure to take along a 100 ft extension cord. We will be there the 2nd and 3rd weeks of May, we fish for Northern the first week and Walleye the second."
535788,2 DOGS,2003-12-01 22:44:00,361,A real good idea would be to follow a maroon Lund from camp and they'll show you all the good fishing spots. They don't catch alot of fish but they sure can cook a great dinner!
535799,MrEyes,2003-12-02 17:35:00,360,Rich J Thanks GREAT information. I am going to Evergreen for the 1st time next year. I will be at the Lodge May 22-29. I am still a little...so..so...on using my own rig. Do you use your own rig? If so what kind is it? I am looking forward to learning the lake. I hope it's as good as everyone says. Mark
535815,Rich J,2003-12-03 16:04:00,65,"The maroon lund 2Dogs is talking about is us. We do eat well, and if we are able to catch fish anyone can. Also if you see a big Alumicraft with a Opti on the back stay close to him, he likes lots of company."
535727,MrEyes,2003-11-24 17:07:00,360,"I am thinking about taking my own boat to Lac Seul. I have a couple of questions. I will be heading up to Evergreen Lodge. 1) Is there alot of water hazards to worry about? If I take it easy will I be able to safely motor around? 2) What are the conditions of the roads rock/pavement, to get to Lodge? If I forgot something or is there anything else I should be aware of. Thanks Mark"
535729,Guest,2003-11-24 19:49:00,0,"First let's answer the second question. The roads are all asphalt except the last 50 yards into camp, roads are not a problem any more. Now for your first question. Definately take it easy until you become familiar with the lake and one of the camp's maps in your hand. There are lots of rockpiles in Lac Seul and all that I have seen or felt are pretty hard regardless of speed."
535730,Guest,2003-11-24 20:47:00,0,Make sure you have a GPS. There will be many boats from Evergreen and other Lodges near Evergreen and if you have a large enough HP motor just follow them for a ways with your GPS on and use the track back mode when you want to return to the lodge. We went to Lac Seul for our first time last year with 4 of our own boats and never hit any rocks but we went slow but kept on our GPS and then followed our track back and opened up the motors on our return.
535733,MrEyes,2003-11-25 08:00:00,360,"Also, if I am bringing my own boat, is there any other lakes in the area that I can try and fish? Maybe take a day and go smallmouth fishing or go for some Lake trout? Mark"
535734,Guest,2003-11-25 09:20:00,0,You should be able to catch Smallmouth on Lac Seul. They have been a good bonus fish on Lac seul for the last several years. Lac Seul can get pretty rocky. Just be careful and drive slow and enjoy the abundance of Walleye.
535738,Guest,2003-11-25 11:20:00,0,"Lac Suel is French for ""Lake of rock reefs""! It is possible to run the lake w/o hitting rocks but you have to be REAL careful. Your best bet is to able to follow another boat. GPS will help but what is the + - of your unit? maybe 20-30'? I can take you to spots that in that amount or error you will have taken out the lower unit or poked a hole in the boat. You can read the lay of the land to a certian degree but then WAM out in the middle of 40' rocks! LS is not a clear lake so the reefs are even harder to locate. I know in 27+ week of fishing the lake I managed to take out 3 lower units and a couple of props. Every year in camp there are a few boats that end up with motor damage! Be careful and all those reefs.... make for excellent fishing!"
535743,Guest,2003-11-25 17:13:00,0,"I have been there the last 3 years and have yet to hit a rock, though I did bend a prop on a log after a storm stirred up the lake. Best advise is to take a GPS, go slow going in the first time. Then you can go fast over your same track back and forth. Don't let it keep you from going, the fishing is worth it."
535744,Lomdunor,2003-11-25 19:51:00,10,"Does anyone know the address/telephone nr. of Sportsmans Lodge thats on or near Lac Seul? Also, anyone recommend a guide for Lac Seul? Seems there would be a need for one on this lake. Looking to try this lake with 5 friends next spring. Any help is appreciated.[email protected]"

Box 341, Red Lake, Ontario, Canada POV2MO There is some awful good walleye fishing in the Red Lake chain without going to Lac Seul, Gullrock has been awesome the last few years."
