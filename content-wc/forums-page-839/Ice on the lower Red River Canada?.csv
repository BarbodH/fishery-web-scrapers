535723,Backwater Eddy,2003-11-24 08:01:00,3871,"Thanks for the report. Sounds like a good set of cleats are handy about now? I just got a set of Georgia Ice Trekker Boots that have built in removable carbide studs on the bottom. Gore-Tex and 1600 grams of Thinsulate so they are ice ready and nice and comfy. I got them larger so I can also add a 600 gram Gore Tex liner sock for serious cold weather. I think 2200 grams should about do it huh? Pretty darn ""KEWL"" Boot....Eh! My Ol' reliable White Mickey GI Boots finally wore out, I tore the darn lace loops out. I guess 15 years is there life expectancy? ;) I'll miss them too. I added 1/4 sheet metal crews on the lugs for traction. They were like studded snow tires on bare ice. That works great if you use the boots mostly for ice fishing. They get a bit skatie on a tile floor though, so watch out for that if you try it. I bet if Stu is about done tinkering with his new house he will get his ice-palace out soon?
