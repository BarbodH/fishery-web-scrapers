535675,Guest,2003-11-16 20:56:00,0,"We are there the day after you leave, our week starts the 19th. We are from all over, MO, IL, NE KS"
535676,Guest,2003-11-16 20:57:00,0,"yes, just one cabin, but it looks nice."
535451,Guest,2003-10-21 21:31:00,0,I called Cherob 3 weeks ago and talked to Cheryl and she said they have 1 cabin. Not much anyone can say about the place as it is a new fledgling resort. Looked at thier web site and looks fine to me. We booked the cabin for June 12-18 2004.
535454,Guest,2003-10-22 10:57:00,0,We were able to get in at Evergreen. No reason for not booking with Cherob except the fact that one of the guys in our group had stayed there before.
535457,Guest,2003-10-22 19:17:00,0,Boy this is going to be a long winter... Will be up the week after you all.. Something like 240 days to go!
535570,Guest,2003-10-30 21:35:00,0,"Nice to get some good response. I have also talked to the owner at Cherob, very nice but would not lead me to anyone who has stayed there. She did tell me that they just finished their first season and are getting ready to build another cabin. The web site does look good and if I could ever get the other guys in the group to make a decision maybe I could book a week."
535589,Guest,2003-11-05 09:18:00,0,I looked at the Cherob Resort web site a week ago and now this morning I get a window saying the site is not responding. What could this mean about the resort?
535590,Guest,2003-11-05 09:51:00,0,Server problems on either end.
535594,Guest,2003-11-05 12:05:00,0,OH NOOOOOOOOOOO.... Fishman hope you didn't send money What kind of tent did you say you had?? Did it sleep 5? StinkyFinger
535595,eyewitness,2003-11-05 12:50:00,680,Looks like a decent place with a nice cabin and docks. I wonder how far one has to travel to get to some better fishing though? Also curious as to whether the drive in and out via boat is littered with hazards or not. Anyone stay there last season?
535640,Guest,2003-11-11 20:04:00,0,"I have had no problems getting on line and getting the website to come up. I can also tell you that in that general area last year there were the usual stick ups but you had to be careful all over the lake last year with the water being down 8 feet. According to my guide, he saw rocks that had never been seen before. I think if you pay attention, you will be ok. I went ahead and booked the cabin. Can't wait."
535648,Guest,2003-11-12 15:42:00,0,We booked cherob for June 12-18. What week did you book? We are from central Wi. Where you from?
535356,Guest,2003-10-13 19:05:00,0,"I am looking for feedback on a resort in Ear Falls, Ontario called Cherob Resort. Let me know what you thought of the facilities and when you stayed there if possible. Thanks"
535358,Guest,2003-10-13 20:27:00,0,Check your clock on your computer. You are off by about 4 hours unless your from another country. If you book at the resort you will be a day early and leave a day early.
535359,Guest,2003-10-13 20:32:00,0,Woops sorry. How can my post indicate my post as 2:27 AM when it is 9:30 PM? Today is also Oct 13 not Oct 14.
535393,Guest,2003-10-15 20:25:00,0,what the heck does the clock have to do with the subject matter??
535395,Guest,2003-10-15 21:24:00,0,Thank you for that reply flyinonh20. I really didn't understand it either. I thought that I might get some good informaiton instead of somebody telling me my clock is off!
535410,Guest,2003-10-16 20:11:00,0,"Maybe he is on track thinking ""your clock is off""? Might have it checked just to be safe. Friend of yours?? Ex-wife possibly? Drown a chub!"
535411,Guest,2003-10-16 21:52:00,0,Clock is right on the money as far as I can tell. At least it's right for this time zone. Wish I could push it forward a bit toward June though so I could get back north and drown that chub and a few of his best friends.
535424,Guest,2003-10-19 19:21:00,0,You might have better luck typing Lac Suel into the subject matter with Cherob resort. With so many camps in Canada it narrows it down to a specific area. Go fish
535442,Guest,2003-10-21 08:10:00,0,I was looking for a camp for next summer and asked the same question on another site. I had been up in that same area the last two summers and had never heard of Cherob Resort. I was told it was a place where someone had some land and put up a cabin and started renting it out. I was also told that they didn't really have all the correct licenses to run a resort. I don't know how accurate this information is but I quit searching because I am going to another camp. They do have a good web site and their rates look good but it would be nice to talk to someone who has actually stayed there. Good luck.
535450,Guest,2003-10-21 20:21:00,0,Just curious.. What camp did you finally book with? What steered you away from Cherob?
