Has anyone spent the one week on this lake that accommodates 1 cabin two people? Thank you, eh. Atomic Eye (New Mexico) -- ""Gone Fission!"" ~~~<}}}:>"

535709,Atomic Eye,2003-11-19 20:51:00,854,"WillieB, Yes, it is one of the Loonhaunt Outposts. It almost sounds too good to be true - 1 cabin on a lake that you may catch up to (and release) 1,000 walleye in one week with northern pike > 50""!! The cabin has a hot shower, propane fridge and stove, solar lighting. Sounds like a wilderness experience with a very nice amount of creature comforts. You can even pre-order groceries / bait / booze and they'll fly them in before you arrive. I've got 9 months of great vicarious living as I think about this one. Thanks.
