535472,Guest,2003-10-24 11:09:00,0,Is best to book a trip before sport shows or during the shows? Mike
535474,Stillwater,2003-10-24 11:57:00,87,"Hey Mike, Either way is fine, however, if you know what resort you want to go to, and you know which cabin you want to stay in and you know exactly what dates you want to go, then the best thing is to book as early as possible for the best chance of getting exactly what you want. If you haven't made any of those choices yet, then go to the shows and look around until you find what you like best. They book a LOT at those shows so getting there first gives you the most options. We have been going to LOTW for the past 16 years and have stayed at 5 different resorts and we definitly have cabin preferences at each of these resorts, (some cabins have their own dock, some have sofas and recliners). Also, depending on the size of your party (we either go with 6 or 7 guys) sometimes it's better to get 2 small cabins and sometimes its better with 1 big one. The bigger cabins (8 or 10 man) will sometimes have the upholstered furniture but 2 smaller cabins will give you 2 bathrooms. Lots of good things to take into consideration. The one thing we ALWAYS try to do book a much bigger cabin than we need. This year we booked a 10 man cabin for 6 guys. Last year we booked a 6-man (for 4 of us) and a 4-man (for the other 3 guys). Resort cabins are notoriously small and when they say its a 6 man, I always like to check how many beds there are. When we go, I like for every person to have their own bed. Scott"

535575,Guest,2003-11-02 13:05:00,0,I used Just Fish Ontario's Trip Finder as well. Got just what I was looking for.
535588,Guest,2003-11-05 09:00:00,0,I am looking for a Walleye fishing camp in Central Ontario. Our group of 14 guys have been going to Quebec for the past 10 years but want to fish Ontario since we all buy Ontario licences anyway. We live and fish on the St. Lawrence River but are looking for some great drive-in Walleye fishing in Ontario within 5 hours of Ottawa that is more remote than the eastern end of Lake Ontario and the Bay of Quinte. Any suggestions?
535605,Guest,2003-11-06 02:39:00,0,"Sports shows can be confusing with all the camps vying for your business. The outfitters job is to sell you on his camp and he/she will paint a rosy picture, which is understandable. If you are leaning toward a new destination, GET REFERENCES. Ask the oufitter for names of folks in your area who've spent time at their camp. Disgruntled campers will overstate the negatives, so it's wise to contact a half dozen, or so, before reaching a decision. I did this over twenty years ago and have never regretted the decision, having returned at least once a year, every year since."
535694,michric,2003-11-18 17:07:00,46,"Mike. I am also checking out fishing in central Ontario. Couple weeks ago I posted for suggestions in the Canada section for resorts within 3-4 hours of the Sault. Kent has a good suggestion on the just-fish-ontario site but be sure to specify the area. 99% of the replies I received from resort owners came from western Ontario. One thing I am noticing is that the fishing LOOKS much better in the NW Ontario area. Check out the size and numbers of some of the fish in the pictures. Last year we went to Biscotasing (on the Spanish River system) which is a couple hours east of Chapleau. The fishing was ok, not great. The resort, price and area was very nice and the owners were super. Three of us worked pretty hard to get 25-30 fish per day, mostly small walleyes and pike. Biggest walleye we caught was 4 lbs. I've been told by several people that some of these lakes have no real forage base so the fishing is on a different scale than places like LOW and Lac Suel, etc. Check out www.ontariofishinglakes for a partial list by region."
535697,Vitreum,2003-11-18 18:00:00,221,"i booked 1 trip at a sports show about 15 years ago. worst mistake i ever made. some dumpy piece of crap lodge in eastern ontario. best fish all week was a 24"" pike. 2 walleye caught in the entire camp all week. i will never book without references and serious research again."
