535619,Trailerguy,2003-11-09 06:56:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I'm told that only the protected bays are froze over on Wabaskang, the main parts are still open, all though they do have about 4"" of snow in the bush. Since LOTW is a lot bigger I'd suspect it is the same."
535623,Guest,2003-11-10 00:26:00,0,OK thanks. I was just curious. our bird bath has frozen over here in chicago. I am still hoping to get on lake michigan for some perch or lake trout before I have winterize the IO. thanks alan
535627,Guest,2003-11-10 07:12:00,0,Have to agree with trailer guy. The bays and rivers are pretty much frozen but the main part of the larger lakes are still open. Next few days are calling for above freezing temps. during the day so don't expect them to freeze any time soon.Too soon for ice fishing and can't get out by boat. Hate this time of year.

535630,Guest,2003-11-10 16:42:00,0,There is 3 to 4 in on some of the lakes in NW Ontario. I know of at least two guys icefishing already. One has an argo and is familiar with the areas.

Some lakes are frozen over, some only in the bays. Temperatures on Monday/Tuesday were in the +5C range.....ice on our lake was thinning out quickly. Went to Sandy Lake on Tuesday and the lake was still frozen over."
