But, it didn't have anything to do with Jesse Ventura. It goes back a lot further than 1998 (when Jesse was elected Governor), and it is really not a Minnesota/Ontario issue. It really started in the 80's and it was a US/Canada thing. It had to do with U.S. fisherman, staying in U.S. resorts, fishing in Canadian waters. The Canadian government basically said that if you want to fish Canadian water that you should stay in Canada, or, at least, hire a Canadian guide. However, U.S. Immigration law says that you cannot hire a Canadian guide/citizen unless there are no U.S. guides available. It all boils down to a political jerk-off, and the fisherman suffers. But, this problem has been around for years, it's a shame, but Jesse didn't have anything to do with it. Scott"

For years, (in my opinin) Minnesota DNR has ignored Ontario's concern over the regulation of border waters. Oh sure they got together and talked, but never any action on Minnesota's part. Then, right at about Jesse's time, the United States was going to try to strong arm Ontario using the NAFTA Agreement. Here is a partial explanation that was on a previous post. The investigation is on behalf of a coalition of groups in Minnesota, including tourist operators from the Northwest Angle in the state. The U.S. has contended that Ontario's requirement of an overnight stay violates the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the General Agreement on Trade and Services (GATS). The US trade challenge asserts that U.S. tourism operators' business has been damaged by the overnight stay requirement. The U.S. has demanded open and unfettered access to Ontario border waters. The U.S. has steadfastly refused to address Ontario's conservation concerns. To eliminate the threat posed by the trade challenge, and return the focus to the essential issue of conservation, Ontario has a new regulatory approach that removes the requirement for an overnight stay and that sets limits for non-residents that are lower than limits for residents. This allows strictly controlled access to Ontario waters. Yaddy Yaddy Yah! You can read the entire post at:https://www.walleyecentral.com/dc/dcb...ng_type=search"
