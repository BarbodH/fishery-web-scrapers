I am curious how the water level is now compared to how it was in June. Is the lake rising, lowering, or staying about the same? Otts"
535560,PRD1,2003-10-30 11:07:00,458,The LOWT Water control board shows Lac Suel as pretty well recovered and back in the normal range. I have previously seen posts where people do not agree with these level reports but this is a starting point. http://www.lwcb.ca/pdf/LacSeulGraph2003.10.29.pdf
535567,Guest,2003-10-30 21:13:00,0,Water levels now mean nothing. What matters is a wet winter and spring. Pray for precipitation!

535621,Guest,2003-11-09 09:39:00,0,I tried to look up lake level with information you gave with out any succeess any other suggestions?
535622,Trailerguy,2003-11-09 15:28:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Grumbler Try doing it step by step: www.Lwcb.ca then click ""basin data"" then click ""historical graphs page"" that will give you a chance to see what the level has been in the last 50 yrs. Then go back and click on current level. The Basin schematic is pretty cool too. There's more information on that site than a room full of bean counters could digest. :)"
