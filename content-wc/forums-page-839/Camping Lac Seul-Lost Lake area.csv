The site had water and electricity, a community freezer, fish hut and a bathroom/shower to use. Not a bad deal if you ask me. Anyway, we would launch into the straits of Lac Seul and go by boat 6 miles to the Lost Lake area (near a bridge). With a 25hp motor, 6 miles can get long. Anyone know of any other camping up in this area? Ultimately we'd like to be right on Lac Seul and have the boats in the water the whole time. All help is appreciated. Thanks, Wooglin"

Yanks can't camp on most lakes and this was put in so the tourist lodges will not loose to the cheap fellas. It's not to see how much you don't spend, but how much you can spend that can make us all very happy up here. Break loose and part with a few buckaroos."

Camping is allowed on some areas of Canada but not on lac seul because it is hard to enforce laws and if you think about it your not allowed to camp in most state or federal forest with out a permit. There are several camps that allow camping and would be happy to have you as there guest and at a cheaper rate than at other public camping areas. (packwash) etc. Welcome to Canada, and dhope to see you on Lac seul."

535680,Guest,2003-11-17 12:03:00,0,"Thanks for the reply, you know exactly where we are. We camped at Country Camping, launched about 3 miles away (left out of Country Camping), then took the 6 mile trip up to the bridge area, everyday, to max out our fish. Do you know of any other areas closer to the launch site, that offer as good of fishing? The fish were basically jumping into our boat over there. Where is Lost Lake? I was under the impression that Lost Lake is where that bridge is? I am 99% sure I am wrong, so any help you can give me is appreciated.
