535340,Guest,2003-10-13 11:52:00,0,"Planning a trip for next September on Lac Seul. have fished it in the Spring and Summer but never in September. Would love to hear from some of the WC gang that has fished LS in Sept. Baits, presentations, depths and fishing results.....Thanks, Mike"
535348,Guest,2003-10-13 15:33:00,0,You are a traitor Polish master. Who needs you anyway.
535353,Guest,2003-10-13 17:22:00,0,Just trying to get some information for a trip that I was sure you would be a part of. Are you going to pout up just like you do when I out catch you in June or can I expect you to finally take your whippings like a man?
535399,Guest,2003-10-16 09:01:00,0,Have fished Lac Seul several times in September. Had the best luck in deep water 20/35 dragging spinners tipped with crawlers. Some action on minnows and Leechs. Jig fishing is OK but you have to use a slow presentation in the fall.
535409,Guest,2003-10-16 20:08:00,0,Wouldn't drowning a minnow/jig be considered a slow presentation. Pulling a spinner is slow?
535412,Guest,2003-10-17 08:17:00,0,In September we jig while floating or sometimes anchored as opposed to back trolling. Pulling a spinner at 1 to 1.4 mph that time of year helps us locate fish much like dragging a crankbait in the summer. Hopefully after we find them we can jig them up.
535461,Guest,2003-10-23 13:23:00,0,"Was just there in sept around the 13th. Stayed at Fisherman's Cove, Great place. We used minnows pretty much exclusively. 92 dozen to be excact between 4 people. So guess how we did? Anyway spinners with pink or gold seemed to be the hookup. Keep them right near the bottom. We fished the windy side of many islands in the main body of water. Nothing over 28"" however an easy 100 fish per boat per day. Have fun, I will be back next July."
535688,Guest,2003-11-18 12:48:00,0,"I go to Lac Seul in the Spring and fall. I really do not make that many changes. I still jig with a minnow and 1/8-1/4 oz jig and like to toss some crankbaits that run a little deeper (like a Wally Diver or deep diving shad raps). I think the key to fall success is slowing down your presentation and fishing deeper (as many have indicated on this message board). In the fall I always seem to find myself in 15+ feet of water and fishing the wind-blown shorelines. Stick to ""Walleye 101"" in the fall, just be more patient, fish slower, and Lac Seul will cough-up the fish in bunches. I honestly do not catch as many quality-sized fish as I do in the spring, but fall fishing on Lac Suel is better than fishing on 99.9% of Walleye lakes in the world. God, I love this lake!"
535689,eyewitness,2003-11-18 14:32:00,680,"WooWoo, you consider 15+ ft. deep as deeper in the fall? If you drop down and start fishing the 22-35 ft. range you will catch many more quality eyes on Lac Seul. Sept. and Oct. the opportunities for the piggies is the best of the season....."
535692,mwal,2003-11-18 15:29:00,151,Was on the lake the last week of September. Most of the replys are similar to my experinces. Fish deep around 1 mph 25 to 40 ft pulling silver or gold spinners and minnows. Fished the windy side of Islands and steep drops. We avg 100 a day with 3 in boat. 2 of us using minnows outfished the guy using crawlers 2 to 1. I didn't try trolling large crank behind bouncer but will next time as some of the nicer fish had cisoes in their throats and still went for the minnow. Actually caught a couple on ciscoes that were regurgitated up and put on the spinner. Largest fish was 28 inch. Mwal
