535768,Guest,2003-11-27 18:26:00,0,yes there is a boat launch that should suit you fine... fished it about 10 years ago at may opener and did ok... june is the prime time for bouncers and spinners apparently... not a big fish place and not that big of a lake... only canadians can camp on crown land... you would be close to some excellent fishing on the winnipeg river that would suit your boat just fine

Travelling down the Pickerel Lake road (gravel) at about 3 miles you will pass a turn off on your left to Pickerel Lake and then shortly after (again on your left) the road to cottages on the NW side of Pickerel lake. Keep going about 1.5 miles past and watch on your right hand side for a road that heads down a hill to the PelicanPouch landing. At the point where you need to turn right...there will be a small cleared out area for parking cars on the left hand side of the road. The lake is only about 10 seconds down the hill. Some signs that you have gone too far..... You see a big gravel pit on the left hand side of the road. If you come to a big fork in the road (right goes to Malachi & straight goes to 7 Island Lake)...you've gone too far."
