Go up to Ontario every May (Lac Suel), over the last two years I landed 3 Walleyes over 28 inches. All three were caught at almost the exact same time of day, right before the light completely disappeared from the horizon. Probably close to 10PM that time of year. All 3 in different spots. Has anyone had similiar experiences with landing nice fish right before dark? Do the hogs come out to feed at this time? Strange, I've never had any luck at all on Lac Suel once its completely dark."
