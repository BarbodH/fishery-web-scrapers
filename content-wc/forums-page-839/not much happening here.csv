535698,Guest,2003-11-18 18:40:00,0,The comment yankee was tongue in cheek....it's amazing how a few words placed carefully can bring such interesting remarks. Good answer.
535624,Guest,2003-11-10 00:29:00,0,Hi. I guess the excitement about fishing canada has gone way down for the season. When does it pick up again here. it seems like in the spring it really hot. Just my thought. alan
535632,Reels,2003-11-11 06:19:00,2876,"Cabin fever should start in here about the middle of December, and we all get cranky, make fun of each others beer and money, have a four month discusion on DUI's... Not to much fishing talk till the first hint of spring. <{{}}><"
535637,Guest,2003-11-11 14:11:00,0,ROTFLMAO! Sooooooooo true.
535639,fishmaster,2003-11-11 17:05:00,209,Reels put it well that sums it up. Winter time everyone will start to come on again.
535662,Guest,2003-11-14 12:52:00,0,There will be more traffic on the Canada threads as soon as us yanks go to the sportshows. TGG
535665,Guest,2003-11-15 16:41:00,0,"Sport shows suck and they are attended by a lot less lodge owners than ever before. Don't you guys repair tackle or make snells, or lead jigs, or play hide the salami with the old lady. I mean there must be something you can do. I know and it will take you all winter to get it done. Paint the boat."
535681,Guest,2003-11-17 13:07:00,0,"There is a lot of things that I do. But, I do spend a whole 3 or 4 hours at a sportshow once a year. I don't know what shows you have attended, but the Minneapolis show gets more outfitters for trips worldwide every year. TGG"
535683,Guest,2003-11-17 15:10:00,0,And the Americans always start it....usually with why are we inconvenienced with things that are ok in our country and in Canada.......
535686,Guest,2003-11-18 12:04:00,0,"At least the looney is coming up in the exchange rate. Maybe you guys will start coming down to the States more frequently again, like you used to. You are certainly welcome. We need to have some FUN and you guys have great nack for that."
535690,Guest,2003-11-18 15:00:00,0,I've spent lots of time in your country but you're right with the exchange. We holidayed every year in your country but in this last year we stayed in Canada and went to La Belle Provence and had a great time. The rumours we've heard about the French being more arrogant than even the Americans just is not true.
