535711,Guest,2003-11-21 12:55:00,0,Did anyone fish Kabinakagami lake in 2003? How did you do? We fished the first of August and did very well. Rained part of every day but I think we caught more fish this year than last. Nothing real big but lots of them. Any replies would be appreciated. Thanks
535713,Ketchenanny,2003-11-22 03:56:00,38,Fished out of Pine Portage the end of May. Was our best trip ever. Number of fish was unbelivable (nothing real big) and the weather could not have been better. I realy believe that the new slot limit is only going to help this lake get better. Often thought of fishing Kaby late in the year but never tried it. Glad you did well. Who did you stay with?

Have always been told by regulars there that you get bigger pike in the late season, we have caught some nice pike in boot bay in september."
