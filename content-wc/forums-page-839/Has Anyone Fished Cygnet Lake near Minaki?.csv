535726,Larry S,2003-11-24 11:10:00,666,Looking for Info on Cygnet Lake Camp near Minaki. How is the fishing? cabins? accesability?. Any Info would be appreciated Larry S
535731,walleyedude,2003-11-24 21:38:00,34,"Every spring for the last 20 years.I usually drag up my own boat and tent it so I can't say much about the cabins, although they look real nice from the outside.As for acessability the 7 miles between Minaki and the camp access road is rough, the 7 mile access road is rougher but passable unless it rains hard then it will be a little slick in spots.As for the fishing, well you probably won't catch the walleye of a lifetime but you will catch plenty of 14 - 22"" walleyes as well as some of the biggest perch around.Most days we will average around 200 fish between the 3 of us but we have had days over that. The worst day we ever had there was a few years ago when the ice went out only 2 days before we went up and we still managed around 50.Biggest any one in our group ever caught went 28"" but I saw a 30"" one year.Jigs, spinners cranks they all work.If you go 1st weekend in June I may see you there."

Cabins are nice,, nothing fancy. dan and jill just built a new cabin and are doing fix up work on all the others. the fishing can be awesome if 100, 15-20 inch fish a day is what you are after. we always catch a few northern 36+ inches each year. when the smallie bite is on you can catch 20+ a day. there are several nearby lakes that you can get to that offers good fishing also."
535739,Guest,2003-11-25 11:56:00,0,"I have been there when that Dinger fellow has been there. Not sure how that boy ever catches any fish. He always has a Labby Bluelight in one hand and a sandwich in the other. My partner and I catch plenty of Walleyes most in the 14"" to 18"" range. It sure is strange that you don't run into the larger fish with all the fish we catch. I think the lake is somewhat stunted for growth as there are no Ciscos for the larger eyes."
535740,Guest,2003-11-25 12:12:00,0,I dont think I've seen that waldinger dude there but i am pretty sure that i've heard his loud mouth flappin. you can sometimes hear him across the lake!
535747,walleyedude,2003-11-25 20:34:00,34,"Actually Dick, while there are no ciscoes ( tullibees ) there are whitefish.Young whities are just as fattening to a walleye.There are big walleyes in there but they are few and far between, Iv'e oftened wondered if trolling the basin with boards and cranks would uncover some hidden giant eyes?There are so many perch that the small and midsize eyes would eat them in the shallows but the big hogs would be chasing small whites in the deeper water?Something to try next summer. I also ice fish there occasionally and it seems our average size in winter is better than open water, most between 18"" and 24"", and we catch a fair amount of whities too."
535756,Guest,2003-11-26 16:08:00,0,where do you stay when you ice fish there? are there many people on the lake ice fishing always wondered if anybody was brave enough to head down that road in the winter
535761,walleyedude,2003-11-26 19:32:00,34,Actually I live in Winnipeg but grew up in Kenora so we usually stay at my friends place in Kenora and just go up for the day.Sometimes we snowmobile down the roadside but more often we use a trail from Pelicanpouch lake that ends up by the shack out near the channel.We have ice fished there maybe 8 times and have never seen anyone else but we have seen iced over holes so we are not the only ones.
535771,Guest,2003-11-29 07:49:00,0,where is pelicanpauch lake?
535774,walleyedude,2003-11-29 20:04:00,34,"Due south of Cygnet.When you drive up 596 you will pass Trout Lake, it is west of Trout and can be accessed from the Big North road.Pretty decent fishing in Pelicanpouch too but gets pounded harder than Cygnet in the summer."
