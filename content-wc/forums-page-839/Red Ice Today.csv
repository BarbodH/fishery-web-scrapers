535672,Guest,2003-11-16 18:23:00,0,Went for a drive today along the Red. Nobody fishing from Lockport to the airport north of Selkirk. North of the airport before the church there were about a 6 people out on the ice. Didn't go out to talk to them but I could see they had no fish on the ice. Nobody on the ice up to the bridge to nowhere.
