We stay at Georgian Bay Fishing Camp, which is a boat in camp 18 miles out in the Bay. Very close to the mouth of the French River(about a 10-15 min boat ride). Email me if you want further details."

Access is easy, straight shot down the river from the 400 (hwy 69). About 9-10 miles or so. We found that we wouldn't get as many pike as we do at the Lower French River, but they were bigger. We had several go over 20lbs. Big deal there was there were a lot of shoals, and it was nerve racking turning newbies loose..... John"
