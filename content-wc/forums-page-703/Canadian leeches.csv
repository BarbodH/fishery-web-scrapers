557610,Guest,2006-05-24 08:15:00,0,I called Rainy Lake Sports in Fort Frances and they have leeches for now at $38/lb. They suggested calling two weeks in advance phone 807.274.6429
556820,czy42strokes,2006-05-03 08:14:00,419,Evergreen is on our way out to the woman river. But where is D & E located? I would gladly pay more to get the jumbo leeches.
556822,Guest,2006-05-03 08:25:00,0,"IA WALLEYE,, I dont judge all by the actions of a few.. but when 35% of what I read on here are those things mentioned, or worse. It becomes absolutely disgusting! I mean really,, if you got dumped on like we do(Canadians and Canada in general) how quick would you be too give out information about the areas you know about??? im sure you would say pizz on it as well.. I live in a border town(right on the Detroit river).. Ive met several guys from Mich/Ohio that share the same passions I do in the outdoors... we keep each other very well informed on whats going on in the area. For example; monday I was out perch fishing,, got into jumbos like ive never seen before(100 fish = 2.5 - 5 gallon buckets).. I came home sent out emails and made phone calls stating all the info needed to get into them. today I got out of bed checked my emails,, had 2 reports from last night from guys handlining the river,, where, how many and with what... would I give that information out too everybody,, not on my life! but the guys who show me some respect will get in in a heart beat!"
556841,Guest,2006-05-03 19:54:00,0,"D & E minnows is on the same gravel road as Evergreen, it's a right hand turn off Gold Pines Rd. Just go an extra 50 yards past Evergreen to the right and you'll see Dave's bush planes that he uses to get minnows. Get there early, they close around 10 or so am, so they can go out and get more minnows, plus I believe they own a tourist camp now and that takes up some time....... If you have kids, get the kids to get the minnows, you'll get more. If you have CDN currency, you'll get just as many minnows for $20 CDN as you will with 20 dead presidents. Greg"

556851,Guest,2006-05-03 23:37:00,0,"So that's his name........we refer to him a ""puddin head"". Not to his face but everyone in our group only knows him by the nickname."
556860,czy42strokes,2006-05-04 08:26:00,419,His wife Pam actually owns the place. SHe is canadian and Mike is originally from Eau Claire Wi. I think Pam is the brains of the operation.
557585,Guest,2006-05-23 18:40:00,0,Do you have a phone number for Four Seasons?
557601,Pooch,2006-05-24 05:28:00,4619,"I just ordered our leeches for a couple of trips this summer. Four Seasons in Ear Falls was $40 a pound (Canadian I assume) I didn't price the other shops in the area. Vern's Minnows at Ignace was $36 Canadian a pound. I was told by a camp owner that the trapper on the highway, just south of Savant had a good supply. I can't remember his name though. If anyone wants his name I can find it. Pooch"
557608,Guest,2006-05-24 08:08:00,0,Four Seasons Sport Shop phone 807-222-2200
557609,czy42strokes,2006-05-24 08:14:00,419,"Called yesterday and was told the same thing. Bought all the jumbo's he is getting in also. Not sure what the price of the jumbos will be, but you can bet it will be more than $40 a pound canadian."
556790,Guest,2006-05-02 12:56:00,0,"I don't think the leech law has anything to do with Americans going or not going to Canada to fish. So don't use leeches. The fish are hungry in Canada, you can use other stuff. I guess leeches didn't get covered under NAFTa, eh?"
556801,2 DOGS,2006-05-02 17:19:00,361,"I believe D & E Minnows have leeches, also Evergreen Lodge. They are both local there in Ear Falls."
556802,Schief79,2006-05-02 17:57:00,11,"Wow! that is pretty hash keywest! Everyone to their own opinion. I go to Canada ever June and go to a remote fly-in outpost. Each year we go to a different lake with a different outfitter. Nothing like the fishing at the lakes we have been to. Walleye and Northern till our arms get tired of casting and reeling them in. Peace and quiet and beautiful scenery. I have a cottage on one of the Finger Lakes with good fishing but nothing compared to the waters in Canada. As you can see my post up a few dealing with leeches. We have never ever used live bait in Canada. This is my fifth straight year and it won't be my last. My buddy drives up from Florida and picks me up in Georgia and we take our time golfing along the way. We are both retired US Navy and are never in a hurry. I realize that a lot of people do not have that luxury. We travel a lot but Canada is a true vacation for us. Putting up with some of the things I read on here such as ""border crossing"", ""beer prices"", ""cannot bring this or that"". We know that ahead of time and prepare for it."

This is the exact reason so many yester year Canadian regulars from here no longer post here, or will no longer help anyone out anymore... no reason too,, we just get dumped on,, not worth it!"
556806,Guest,2006-05-02 18:50:00,0,"Canadian Hunter, like everything in life, to use the comments or ideas of a few and then generalize about an entire population is wrong. I have been traveling to Canada on fishing trips since I was nine and now my 14 year and 9-year old do the same. I have been going to Canada on business since I started working and that was too long ago. 99.99% of the people I have meet there are great. .01% are not, but that is the same % I find in the US or in any other place I have traveled to in my life. 99.99% of the people that read and post here have a deep appreciation for our friends and neighbors to the north. While I defend the right of every person to have their own opinion, don't judge us all by the comments of any one person. IA Walleye"
556809,Rich J,2006-05-02 20:13:00,65,"2 Dogs Yep, I'll be using some of those leeches real soon. Are you going to wait until after Memorial Day? Rich j"
556812,2 DOGS,2006-05-02 21:37:00,361,"Gonna be there June 5th, leave a couple close in, I'm afraid that old tugboat won't make it out too far on my gas rations. Will you be back up later on?"
556815,Guest,2006-05-03 00:01:00,0,Who is this Mike you are referring too? Is that the guy who runs the 4 seasons sport shop in Ear Falls?
556818,czy42strokes,2006-05-03 08:12:00,419,"Yes, Mike operates 4 seasons. Lives in Wisc in the winter months."
556819,czy42strokes,2006-05-03 08:14:00,419,Evergreen is on our way out to the woman river. But where is D & E located? I would gladly pay more to get the jumbo leeches.
556626,Guest,2006-04-27 08:34:00,0,"It is my understanding that beginning this year that bait shops can only sell Canadian leeches because it is now illegal for dealers to import leeches from the U.S. If this is true, I'm wondering how it will affect the price of leeches? We paid about $25/lb. Canadian in Ear Falls last year."
556630,czy42strokes,2006-04-27 10:02:00,419,Not only will it affect the price but also the quality of the leeches. Mike told me that the price will go up plus those big Mn jumbo leeches will look more like crappie leeches.
556721,Schief79,2006-04-30 08:25:00,11,"I am thinking of trying to catch a few leeches to try. Never have used them and each year we go to a fly in camp and use all artificial plugs and jigs tipped with minnows and catch all the fish we need. Will be going to the Pipestone River area with Pickle Lake Outposts in June. A couple questions, does anyone know if the river or lakes in that area have leeches and is it legal to catch our own. Read on the internet how to go about trying to catch them. Before anyone comes back saying I am cheap and go buy them, again, we are plug and jig fishermen and just want to try it a couple times"
556726,bigfish1965,2006-04-30 09:52:00,3210,"I know non-residents cannot trap minnows, but I can't find any reference to them catching their own leeches."
556742,Guest,2006-05-01 08:22:00,0,"Mike is a poor source of whats really going on. Offered large to jumbo local leeches to him last year and he thumbed his nose at me. Local trappers have access to good leaches; cheap dealers won't pay a fair price to locals when Minn and Wis farmed leeches were so cheap and easy. Leeches, and good ones at that, will be available this year, you may have to shop a bit to find them; some shops may be shut out from local sources from past treatment. Prices of local leeches will be more because we can't farm them and trapping is real work."
556744,Trailerguy,2006-05-01 09:18:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Page 5 of the Ontario fishing regulations summary states, ""Only resident anglers with a valid fishing licence may capture their own leeches for personal use"" Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
556745,Trailerguy,2006-05-01 09:20:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]Do you know which local dealers will be carrying jumbo leeches? I'm sure people would be interested in knowing prior to their arrival. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby

Last season the quaility of the leeches were poor compared to previous years. We always call Mike a month ahead of time and put in our order for 8 pounds of leeches. If you know of a place around Ear Falls where we can purchase the jumbo leeches I would be interested in their phone number. Thanks,"

556778,jigman 2003,2006-05-02 07:05:00,981,"Wow, spelling and grammar are apparently unimportant to some people. If you don't like going to Canada, stay home. The places you mention do indeed have good fishing at times. However, none of them can come close to the remote experience you get in Canada. None of them offer the ease of walleye fishing that Canada does. None of them offer a bush plane experience. Again, I certainly don't care if you don't go to Canada. However, don't insinuate it is a rip off or that the rest of us shouldn't go."
