557584,Capn Hooker,2006-05-23 18:27:00,333,"Have had many fishing trips into Canada. Only been searched once. That was in 1998 while going to LOTW. We got searched at the border going in. They rummaged through the car & the boat & found notta. While on the water, we were boarded by the OPP and they searched us too. Then coming back into the states we got searched again. Don't know why, that was the only trip we were ever looked at."
557593,sidewinder,2006-05-23 21:05:00,96,Got searched 2 years in a row with my 3/4 ton suburban.First time our declarations were over the limit(some guys over bought) so they searched our u-haul.Did not find sheriffs trusty firearm. He never leaves home without it. Next year we confused em with the Texas Truck license plate (expired) in front and TN plates on back. He asked why we had two license plates from two states. I said I have only one legal license plate on rear because TN does not reqiure plates on front of vehicle.He asked me same question three times. I bought the Suburban in Texas and like the Texas Truck plates. Needless to say I took it off the next couple of trips. Someone liked my plate better than me and just plain took em. sidewinder
557597,Guest,2006-05-23 22:03:00,0,"We've only been searched once in all 25+ years we've been going thru Ft. Francis (sometime 2 or 3 trips a year). That was the first year we went up, and we had a 16 year old 'wise acre' in the back seat. We were asked the usualy question, but when asked about how much gas we had, the same time I told them 35 gallons in the boat and 35 in the van, the '16 year older' piped up, ""what do you think we are, a tanker truck?' Needless to say, my partner just looked at me with this sick look--and we were directed to the search area. Although we didn't have anything to worry about, that little remark cost us about 2 hours at the border... Needless to say, the 16 year older was never asked to go back again, and still probably won't (although he's 42 now). ...be polite, no wise remarks, tell all... that's our rules. Chuck"
557616,Guest,2006-05-24 09:14:00,0,"I was checked out for a little over 2 hours last year (December). I was asked if I had any guns, bombs you kinow the rest. And then asked again sometime during questions if I had any guns in the truck or ammo, I said ""nope"" asked a couple more questions and well do you own any guns, I said ""yes"" do you have any of them with you. I said NO. Do you own a hand guns ""yes at home"" in Missouri. The man said ok just pull over here to your left and we will clear your truck. Dam* sure did clear it, took everything out. I was lucky enough after about 10mins to get my coat out of the truck to wear it. And when I asked for it to put it on the Lady said what do you need your coat for???? DHHAAAA????. I was Freezing my U know what off. And had to check it out for a gun I guess before I could put it on. Found a cork screw in the truck glovebox and asked questions about it. Wanted to know what I was going to do with it and why do you carry one in the glovebox. Told her my wife put there I guess. Questions went on and on lot of dumd ones too. Does your wife always put things in the truck with out me knowing it. Better stop or this will be a 2 hour read."

557493,Hump,2006-05-22 08:47:00,578,"I have never been searched at the border, but did get pulled, along with every other vehicle on 105, south of Ear Falls. They were friendly, but claimed it was a fish check. Took about a 1/2 hour. I did make the mistake of packing the wet kitchen towels in a LCBO sack. customs officals on the US side asked alot about that."
557495,Guest,2006-05-22 09:18:00,0,"We've been stopped 4 of the last 5 years going into Canada. Three times we had a full inspection. In each time, we were polite, prepared with our answers, and prepared with our documentation. None of us look like typical suspects, whatever that is, but harmless nonetheless. Last year, we didn't get stopped even though my cousin in law gave the ""No"" answer to ""if everyone was born in the US"". Where were you born?....Suppan Bay....Where's that?....Philipines. Ok. Have a nice trip. No rhyme or reason. He was the only newbie last year so maybe he's good luck."
557496,Hammerhead Herb,2006-05-22 09:22:00,259,"Something that we always do is have a written list of how many people we have in our group, how much & what kind of tobacco we are taking into Canada and how much & what kind of alcohol we are taking into Canada. We hand them the list at the same time that we are giving the agent our ID's. They seem to appreciate it and get the impression that we have all of our 'stuff' in one sock."
557502,Guest,2006-05-22 11:52:00,0,"I have been searched numerous times over the many decades I have been visiting Canada. But almost always the search arises when coming back into the states, by the US agents. The crossings I use, coming out of Montana, don't get much traffic and the agents get bored, so they search more. However, I did encounter one Canadian agent who was very zealous. This individual searched me two trips in a row, in a 3 week span. I had nothing to hide...but it was an inconvenience, so I simply don't cross into Canada at that crossing anymore. There is no reason to fear being searched, but it does slow you down."
557503,Mohleye,2006-05-22 13:56:00,368,"Our group was searched 5 years in a row while entering Canada, all while driving a motorhome. The agents seemed more interested in inspecting the motorhome than our gear. Heard that the motor home is the smuggler's vehicle of choice for booze, cigarettes, etc. and they appeared to mostly be looking for hidden compartments, etc. Never been searched otherwise. Based on that, and the fact that there were always other motorhomes being searched, if you travel in one you had probably better allow a 1/2 hour for a search. Never been checked in any other vehicle. I echo the other advice, have your ducks in a row, and know what you're talking about."
557506,Guest,2006-05-22 15:19:00,0,"Funny story...20years ago i was playing backetball in college (for a comm. college in northern MI) The school had scheduled a weekend series of 2 games against Lakehead University in Thunder Bay. So we end up taking both a van driven by the coach, and another loaner vehicle which was a black late model sedan. I was driving the sedan along with 3 other players. We get to the border at Pigeon Falls and the van goes thru with no problems. We pull up to the border and 2 agents ask us the usual questions (i had assumed that the coach had informed them that we were behind and traveling with them). When the female agent asked us if we had anything to declare, one smartarse in the back seat yells out ""Yea, we need to declare Johnsons's virginity""..............Silence from the guard. Then the dreaded, ""please pull ahead and exit the vehicle"". An hour later we were on our way, and the coach was a little perterbed to say the least. The only other times i have been searched were at the Sprague crossing when we were heading up to the NW Angle to fish. Xplorer"
557507,Guest,2006-05-22 15:50:00,0,Do you still have to declare your virginity? or have you taken care of that matter in the past 20 years?????????

557527,Guest,2006-05-23 07:19:00,0,"Years ago when we crossed the boarder they asked my then 12 year old brother where he was born. Well being young his world still seemed pretty small. He thought they wanted to know which hospital he was born in. He said I don't know, can I call my mom? We still get a chuckle out of that. A few years latter the group of kids was now in their upper teens. The dads crossed in one car no problem but all the teenage kids crossed in another car. They searched the kid's car down to opening the fishing reels and unrolling all their clothing. Of course there was nothing to find, but what a mess, everything unpacked and laid out on the concrete."
557462,Guest,2006-05-21 11:41:00,0,"Last year, one of the drivers in our convoy was a little sleepy when he hit the border. When the guy asked the question about alcohol, he answered that there was one case of beer in the car. Then he corrected himself, and said one case per each person in the car...then he corrected himself again said two cases per person and there also is some vodka bottles. ""Please pull to the left sir, turn off your car, exit the vehicle and unlock all doors."" We were lucky and they only searched for about 15 to 20 minutes and then let us pass. In two weeks, he will not be in the drivers seat when we hit the border. Anyone else get searched? My car did not get searched...only his."
557463,north_alabama,2006-05-21 12:22:00,172,"Last year since we took my Dad's truck, I thought it would be a good idea if he was driving across the border. On the way into Canada, they asked where we were headed. Dad stammered for a minute then looked at me. I told the border person where we were headed. The guy then asked us how long planned to be in Canada. Dad couldn't come up with the answer, so I told the guy we planned to be there 13 days. On the way back to the US we got to the point we were next in line and Dad realized he left his wallet in another pair of pants that he put in the back of the truck, so he had to get out, go round back, and start rummaging around in his stuff. Of course by the the vehicle in front of us drove off so all eyes were on him. Then we pull up and the guy in the booth asked for IDs, then asked us what we we're bringing back. Dad looks at him and said ""Uh, nothing."" In a sense that was true, since we didn't bring anything back we did not take with us. The guy asked us a bunch of questions: we're we fishing, did we catch any, did we have any fish with us? Luckily, Dad must look pretty harmless at 67, so in neither case did they search us or give us any untoward grief. But this year maybe I'll drive across the border and hold his wallet for him."
557464,fourize,2006-05-21 12:30:00,287,"My car was searched 6 years ago, when my wife and I went to Niagara Falls on our wedding anniversary. Really didn't give them any reason to be suspicous of anything. I imagine they just picked us out at random and figured they might get lucky. They checked under the dashboard, under the seats, and just lightly through our luggage in the trunk. They were very polite the whole time and we actually had a nice conversation with them. After they were done, they told us to have a good time and we went on our way. Also, my Dad and I have been going up to Canada fishing for the past 12 years and have never been searched. We are always honest about what we have...we buy our liquor in town before we get to the lodge...and we have never had a problem going into Canada or coming back into the states. We actually came back the Saturday after 9/11 and all they did was open the truck cap door, look inside, and told us to have a safe trip home. We always have crossed at the 1,000 Islands. 28 more days!!!!!!!!!!!!"
557466,Guest,2006-05-21 12:59:00,0,"We had a pop up in trailer our convoy.When we got searched the guard looks in the pop up and finds a bottle that was left there from the guy's son the week before when he went camping-oops! The guard asks if that was all, our guy says it better be, but the guard finds another bottle. Long story short the guards take the booze we pay duty, the guy's son gets his butt kicked when we get back and we learn a big lesson-It helped that we stood around and laughed- the guards realized that it was an honest mistake and let us get on our way THANK YOU"
557468,Catman59,2006-05-21 16:46:00,345,"Thats funny........My family was also searched at Niagara a couple of years ago. Asked if I had any weapons at home !!!!!...I said yes. Must have been all they needed.Had to be checked by a pair of female inspectors.They searched the Suburban for about 2 minutes and said we were clean to have a good day... A pain in the butt , but easy. Been going to Canada for several years fishing and have yet to be checked..... Just luck I suppose , probably about due."
557471,Guest,2006-05-21 18:30:00,0,We had a group of us going through International Falls. We were pulling a U-Haul will all our gear which I guess looked suspicious. They pulled all our crap out of the trailer. Wasted a good hour. That was the only time we have been checked after going up for 20 years. Wingmann
557472,Guest,2006-05-21 19:22:00,0,"I got searched entering Canada about 2 years ago. When the search was over, I asked them why they picked me. They just smiled and pointed at the N.R.A. sticker on my truck. BEST FISHES ! ggg"
557474,Guest,2006-05-21 20:45:00,0,"One guy in our group of cars last year had a couple very old compasses in his car, and apparently they had some sort of radium luminous substance on the needles - enough to set off the very sensitive equipment that detects that sort of thing. Of course, they had to look around through the car for about 20 minutes before they figured out what was setting the thing off.... ;)"
557488,Guest,2006-05-22 08:25:00,0,I've been across the border probably 60 times and have only been searched once. Myself and three others crossed the boarder around 4:00am one morning on our way to Nestor Falls. We were all in our twenties at the time. We were driving a van and they tore it completely apart...all the way down to the sleeping bags. They found nothing because we didn't have anything. It took us about an hour to repack everything and we were on our way.
557489,Knutsy,2006-05-22 08:27:00,9,"Sometime in the middle 1980's my brother and I were driving to meet my father in Perrault Falls, who had spent a week there with his friends and was spending a second week with his sons. The customs agent probably had reason to search us based on how we looked, being in our twenties with long hair, shades, and shoddy attire.I think the kicker was the fact that we told the agent we would be fishing, but had no fishing equipment because our father took it all up the week before. They searched all of our bags and checked the car thoroughly and sent us on our way. A few miles up the road, my brother looked over and proclaimed what a good thing it was that we didn't have to empty our pockets as he pulled out a single-hitter and his stash. Had I known he had that in his pocket, I'm quite sure I would have had a nervous breakdown during the search. I'm not sure how we would have explained that one to dad."
