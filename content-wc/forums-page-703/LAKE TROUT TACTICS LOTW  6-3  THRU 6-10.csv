I used to troll for them with spoons like Williams Wobbler & five of diamonds , but since have change my methods. The most important thing I bring is my vex fish finder, and I jig for them using a white tube jig. The trout should be shallow still , but as lakers go they could be at any depth. That's why I switched to jigging."

557555,Bill Krejca,2006-05-23 11:31:00,6107,"RBR, Yes, belly meat is a very effective lure for trout. That said, if you are fishing in Ontario, the meat had better be sucker meat, or some other kind of baitfish meat that you purchased locally. Unfortunately, some years ago, the ability to use perch bellies, scrap walleye strip, et al, was made illegal, according to a warden whom I asked. If fishing Manitoba, it is OK to use the scrap that results from the filleting process, and really makes a terrific ""tip"" on a jig, for trout and walleye, and pike."

It wasn't LOTW, but it was a large lake and the water was still cold . They should still be in the bays. Most important use your electronics to find the cisco's . I would start off trolling in anywhere from 30'and watch your electronics closely. Look for shores that go deep and if you can find one with a lot of boulders even better. I catch my own suckers, but I'm sure there are bait stores in the area that do sell sucker bellies. For jigging it's hard to beat that. I have also used chicken breast tipped on a jig and results were very good."
