557198,Guest,2006-05-13 13:06:00,0,why not stop being so stingey and stay at a lodge around there???
557469,Guest,2006-05-21 17:00:00,0,"My son and I will have the afternoon and evening to fish this Thursday before heading into Mahkwa Lodge. I am familiar with Deception Bay landing having put in there to access Chamberlain Narrows, but I have never fished close to the landing. Any specific recommendations 10 miles or so from the landing? Is it fairly safe running or are there some hidden rocks to look out for? I would hate to do damage to my boat or motor before even starting our real fishing trip. Thanks. NE Piker"
557470,Guest,2006-05-21 17:05:00,0,"I am not familiar with Hudson Launch. Where is it located and is it a public launch? The folks at Mahkwa told me I should not put in a day early at the landing for their cabins, so I am looking for a good place to fish for the afternoon and evening before going into Mahkwa. Any suggestions of public landings near Sioux Lookout or Hudson will be appreciated. I have put in at Deception Bay. NE Piker"
557490,wooglin,2006-05-22 08:28:00,371,"Take HWY 664 from Sioux Lookout Westbound towards Hudson about 10-15 miles (it's a bit of a drive from Sioux Lookout). On the right hand side (not sure of mileage), you'll see two green launch signs. I believe it's the second launch sign just before some railroad tracks, hang a right there (bumpy gravel road, will cross tracks when you go in). This is a public launch, you'll see a bunch of cars. If you get to Hudson (small city), you've gone too far."
557513,Guest,2006-05-22 18:01:00,0,"Wooglin Thanks for the information. I believe will try that Hudson Landing. Any suggestions on where to go once we put in at that landing? This is my youngest son's first ever Canada trip and I am trying to make it a memorable experience, so that is why I want to make use of every minute. We will have from mid-afternoon to sunset to fish Thursday afternoon and then Friday we put in to go to Mahkwa. Thanks Steve"
557542,wooglin,2006-05-23 09:47:00,371,"You could try Websters Bay, Kewatin Bay, Italian Bay or anywhere in between. Just fish structure that you find, troll rock piles, windy shores/points...etc. You can see these bays on this map:http://crownlanduseatlas.mnr.gov.on....fs/_930500.pdf Websters is the big unmarked bay West of Hudson (through Young Narrows). Kewatin Bay is the big bay North of Italian Bay. Italian Bay is marked."
556723,scar,2006-04-30 08:58:00,196,"looking for some info on fishing spots from either of these two landings, will be up twice this summer and fish on minnitaki but would like to take some day trips on lac seul. those two landings are real close. is anyone willing to share some spots near either landing? i could send some info on good spots on minnitaki for trout,eyes or northern. scar"
556727,Guest,2006-04-30 10:08:00,0,"It is a long haul from Deception Bay, but if you want to experience the best walleye fishing then boat to Chamberlain Narrows and fish 200 yards past Lac Seul Outpost."
556734,Canadian Club,2006-04-30 15:41:00,5,Are you talking 200 yards north of the camp and on the east side??
556747,wooglin,2006-05-01 09:22:00,371,"Websters Bay from Hudson can be quite productive. Anywhere up in the Deception Bay landing too can be good. Fish windy bays, humps, holes - we catch fish withing seeing distance of the Hudson launch...."
556763,Guest,2006-05-01 16:59:00,0,"Yes, but we did just as well on the west side, too."
556814,embke,2006-05-02 22:42:00,3,"My son and son-in-law and there boys are coming up to Lac Seul and staying at Country Cabins on Big Vermilion. Should be up there on the 21st of June. The first time for us on this end of the lake. We have been going to the west side of Lac De Mille Lacs for may years. Also have gone up the Graham road to Brightsands area for probably 9 years and fished Brightsands, Metionga, Harmon and Sparkling. If anyone is interested in that area send me an email. We will be using the Hudson boat landing and wondering if we could get some info and places close to that landing as we don't have large motors to go out more then about 10 or 12 miles for a day. Have a map but, it doesn't have any names of locations. We like to fish for walleyes early and late and cast for northerns mid day. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks, Walt[email protected]"
556817,wooglin,2006-05-03 07:25:00,371,"We stay at Country Cabin's every year, and will be there the same time as you. Will you be in the cabins or camping? Where are you coming from? Check out this map, most are marked. If you can go 10 miles one way, you'll be fine. Websters Bay, Italian Bay, Kewatin Bay (North/NorthWest of Italian), English River area all good. Actually, the whole area out of the main part of Lost Lake is good. Just fish windy points, humps, holes, sandbars...etc.http://crownlanduseatlas.mnr.gov.on....fs/_930500.pdf Good luck, see you there! PS, Big Lake Vermillion is good for smallies and muskie. >My son and son-in-law and there boys are coming up to Lac >Seul and staying at Country Cabins on Big Vermilion.

556848,embke,2006-05-03 21:45:00,3,We will be staying in a cabin. There are six of us. Thanks for the help and hope we can meet up. Will try to check on the address you posted for another map. I have an older 16 ft Lund pike boat with a 25 HP Evinrude. We will probably rent another boat from Country Cabins. Walt.
556849,embke,2006-05-03 21:51:00,3,"Forgot to mention in the last post. I live in Marshfield, WI and our son and his boy live in Eau Claire. Walt"
556868,wooglin,2006-05-04 10:10:00,371,"Great to hear. We'll be camping in the back corner, on the water. Stop on down. We're all from WI as well - Milwaukee, Appleton and Ft. McCoy. One guy is flying up from the Army in AL, so it's quite the hall for him!"
