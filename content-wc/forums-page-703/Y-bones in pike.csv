557631,MoWalleyeguy,2006-05-24 14:31:00,409,"If you have never tried it you should- (pickling disolves all the bones)... hint- use small to med sized pike. Release the big girls. Pickled Pike * 1 cup white vinegar * 3/4 cup white sugar * 3 bay leaves * 4 whole cloves * 1/2 tsp. whole allspice * 1 tsp. whole mustard seed * 1/2 tsp. whole black peppercorns * 1/2 cup sweet white wine * 1 cup pickling salt * 2 qt. cold water * 1 lb. skinless pike, bones removed, cut into 1 inch chunks * 1 1/2 - 2 cups additional white vinegar * 1 medium onion, thinly sliced * 1/2 lemon, thinly sliced First day: Combine 1 cup vinegar, sugar, bay leaves, cloves allspice, mustard seed and peppercorns in a saucepan. Bring ingredients to a boil and reduce heat. Simmer for 5 minutes. Cool. Add wine. Pour into a plastic or glass container. Let pickling syrup sit at room temperature for 4 days. Mix pickling salt with cold water; stir thoroughly to dissolve salt. Pour over cutup skinless fish and refrigerate 48 hours. Third day: Rinse fish with cold water and cover fish chunks with vinegar. Refrigerate for 24 hours. Fourth day: Drain fish and discard vinegar. Loosely layer fish, onion and lemon in glass or plastic containers. Completely cover with pickling syrup and cover tightly. Refrigerate for five days, stirring once or twice during that time. Ninth day: Pickling is done. Pickled pike may be stored covered with the pickling syrup in a closed container in refrigerator for up to 5 weeks. Makes approximately 2 qt."

557635,Knutsy,2006-05-24 15:11:00,9,"A lodge owner by the name of Bob Extence showed me how to fillet a northern boneless and I have done it this way since. First, lay the pike on its stomach. Place your knife on the top of the fish just behind the head and cut straight down about an inch. Turn your knife and cut all the way to the dorsal fin. Take the knife out and cut straight down just in front of the dorsal fin. Remove the piece.On the piece you just removed, cut off the two pieces of meat on either side of the backbone from the skin. This should give you two pieces about 1 inch by 1 inch by 15 inches or more long, depending on how big the fish is. I like to call those the backstraps. By cutting the top off,you have now exposed the y bones on the fish. Proceed by filleting the fish normally, but keep your knife outside the y bones. You should end up with four pieces, the two fillets and the two backstraps.I hope this doesn't confuse you even more."
557641,River_eye,2006-05-24 15:53:00,1486,"Remove the filets the way you would with any other fish, then remove the rib cage, same as any other fish now, with the filet horizontal, and right side up, find the white line in running down the centre line of the fish. take the tip of your knife, and cut into this line in a 45 degree angle away from you (a 90 degree angle would be straight down towards the table). make this cut along the whole length of the white line, and only about a quarter inch deep. Then go along this same cut with a steeper angle (knife a bit flatter) don't press very hard, just hard enough, so you can feel the tip of the knife run along the bones. keep making more cuts, angling your knife flatter and flatter each time. If you don't feel the bones, only flesh, you are cutting too deep, and losing meat. If you only feel bones, and your knife wants to cut through them, rather than under them, then your knife is too flat. Confusing? it's easier to do when you see it."

557653,Guest,2006-05-24 20:41:00,0,Hey MoWalleye I might give yours a try. I used another type of brine not too bad. But yours look better! Any luck with eyes in Missouri? Mo. here also and eyes somtimes can be few and far between. Thanks!
557662,jerry bark,2006-05-25 06:02:00,822,"I do something similar: i filet just like a walleye, then cut crossways into pieces about 3 inches wide. then i cut along the y bones on both sides like the cuts shown on that web site, but with smaller pieces. this work great for me. jerry"
557680,millerltman,2006-05-25 10:58:00,12,Thanks to everyone for the techniques and tips. I will be trying them out June 17 in Red Lake. Thanks again
557685,Guest,2006-05-25 11:52:00,0,The only way I learned it was to try on 5-6 lbs pike. The bones are large and easier to feel. Once you've done a few then move to smaller 3-4 lbs pike. Like anything else it takes lots of practice and practice makes perfect. When I have a fish fry I usually have half northern and half walleye cut in pieces and deep fried. Most folks can't tell the difference if you've Y-boned the pike correctly..
