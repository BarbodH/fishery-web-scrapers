557621,Guest,2006-05-24 12:38:00,0,"I have stayed at the best western in Dryden. It is by no means a 4-Star hotel, but it is clean and reasonably priced. In regards to the safety of your boat, just make sure to get a room with a view of the parking lot. That way you can keep an eye on your boat. Otherwise, the hotel is located on a busy street with lots of traffic and other businesses, so there is always police prescence around."
557634,Catman59,2006-05-24 15:03:00,345,Ive stayed there twice and not had any trouble.......I think I sleep with 1 eye open though !!!!!

557656,Guest,2006-05-24 21:38:00,0,use common sense.. all valuables into the hotel room. parking lot is well lit. they also have a pretty good buffet and the bar is usually full of fishermen drinking and watching the stanley cup. the husky gas station next door serves a pretty decent breakfast too. you can swim (take a bath) in the indoor pool.the morning air may not be too pleasant (paper mill) after a night of many livations but ive stayed there many times with no complaints.. 9 more days lotw big bass and pike hitting.. cant wait jig out
