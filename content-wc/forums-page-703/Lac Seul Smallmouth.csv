557636,Mike Kansas,2006-05-24 15:19:00,1463,I hope that nobody ever keeps one. Throw them all back and eat your Walleye.

Have a long 6 day conference that ends two days before we go, so staying focused during that will be a challenge. travel safe....IA Walleye"

557664,CH47,2006-05-25 07:24:00,29,"We fish the central section of Lac Seul too. I love to try for the smallies in the evenings before we head back to camp for the night. The best luck I've had has been casting right at rocky shorelines in bays. If you bounce your lure off the rocks, all the better. Last year I caught all of my smallmouth on the mimic minnow from Northland and the good old #7 shad rap, silver & black. Biggest was 19 3/4"", smallest was 18"". No one in our group ever keeps smallies. I'm going to break that 21"" mark this year. When back in a bay look and listen for the splashes of the fish surface feeding and cast in that direction. You'll know right away wether you've found them or not. The link below is a picture from last year. Good luck.http://www.justfishontario.com/image...size.cfm?id=59"
557672,Guest,2006-05-25 08:59:00,0,ch47....What Resort do you stay at on Lac Seul????
557682,CH47,2006-05-25 11:11:00,29,"Wow, we stay at Mahkwa and we go in June. Never been disappointed yet, unless I couldn't go. Regards,"
557691,orchard frank,2006-05-25 15:31:00,1900,"Orange or gold rattle traps if they are hot, suspending husky jerks if they're not. In June, evenings will usually be better than mornings, rocky points with some food shelf area, not too steep. Timber and weeds can also be good. Like mentioned earlier, some areas will be packed, others empty, run and gun til you get bit, then work the area over. You might want to consider a light wire or flouro leader, lots of pikies and the occasional muskie waiting to steal your $4 crankbait. If you want to use jigs and plastic they work also, white twisters reeled in steady, not jigged, has been hot for us on occasion, but I like cranks best."
557574,Guest,2006-05-23 13:54:00,0,Will be on Lac Seul first week of June and would like to try for some Smallmouth. I heard that Smallie fishing is getting better there every year. Would appreciate any input from those who fish Smallies there on patterns and lure selection in early June. Thanks Jim Bolinda

557579,Guest,2006-05-23 16:34:00,0,"I fish the middle part of the lake and yes, it is getting better every year. However, I do not target them. I catch them by mistake while tossing for pike and wally's. I have gotten into a few pods and had a blast. Been going there for a long time and it is improving a lot."
557580,Guest,2006-05-23 17:05:00,0,"I also fish the middle part of LS and will be there the second week in June. As to the smallies, my expereince has been pitching crankbaits or jigs to select shorelines. The smallies in the central part of really just getting established so its not like they are everywhere and what makes one strech of shoreline more productive than the next is a bit of mystery to me. We spend most of our time walleye fishing, but a couple of AM's or PM's we will chase the bass if the weather is right. Have never done well on topwater in LS (but have on other waters at the same time of the year). If the spring is warm, the fish will be in shallow at that time so don't be afraid to pitch real close to shore. One year you had to land your crank or jig within a foot of shore to get a hit (or so it seemed). Also, if you can locate some rock humps that top out about 4 - 6 feet down, work those along with the normal rocky windy points. Berrataman, what resort do you go to and will you be there this June?...IA Walleye"

557606,Guest,2006-05-24 07:35:00,0,When is the opener for Small Mouth? I thought I saw posted on a board next to the launch that they open end of June/early July??!!
557612,Guest,2006-05-24 08:39:00,0,"I go to Mahkwa, this will be our 19th year there! Yep, we used to come in via Deception Bay before they built the road. I am pumped to go, we will be fishing June 3-7 this year. I will have computer access on June 9, if you are still here, I could email you how we did."
557622,michigan eyes,2006-05-24 12:46:00,7,Been going up to McKenzie Bay (NW sec. etc.) for 10 yrs. now & no-one ever in our group has ever caught a smally (first week of june) Maybe this will be the year? 9 more days!!!......... ME
557625,Guest,2006-05-24 13:00:00,0,"Most of the Smallies I have caught on Lac Seul have been by accident while I was jigging for Wallies. However, over the past couple of years I have simply brought along some of the lures/baits that I would typically use when I am fishing for largemouths back home. That would include some mid-sized spinner baits, some shorter/rounder lures such as Shad Raps, Bombers and Bagleys. Last year I even caught a couple of nice sized smallies fishing with a texas-rigged Berkely ribbon-tail worm. I can't really pinpoint a specific color for you to use as I have a large variety of colors that all seem to work just fine."
557629,Mike Kansas,2006-05-24 13:33:00,1463,"Been fishing Lac Seul for 17 years mostly for Walleye. We would occasionaly catch a Smallie while jigging or dragging cranks. However Smallie fishing has improved every year for the last six years on Lac Seul. Our numbers of caught Smallie have almost doubled every year. This is in part caused by the fact that we will spend a little more time ( about 10%) every year targeting them. Last year we caught around 100 to 125 Smallie during our six days of fishing with most of them being between 15""/17"". We simply cast smaller crankbait on rocky points or saddles between islands when wind is causing water breakage. It makes a great break from Walleye fishing and just like all fishing ITS FUN."
