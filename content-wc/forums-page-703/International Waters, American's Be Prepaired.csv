The laws that keep americans out of Canada are the same laws that are preventing a member of my fishing crew from crossing the line this year. Also the same laws that are making fishing better every year. I believe every year there is better fishing than the year before. With crazy high gas prices and crazy wack laws like preventing a 4 year bachlor degree graduate Nurse access to a remote area border crossing permit for the reason of careless driving, once two years ago, with a clean record otherwise, i believe its important that I stress, clean record. Ya careless driving not reckless driving. So one of our own will be heading up to our Miller High Life Fish Camp however she may not be headed to the sacred canadian side. I guess she could stay in camp, maybe cook, or clean, how .bout that, amazing how things work out and I figure these great laws... which may someday get the best of me too, but I hope not, Ah, I ramble but getting back...these great laws keep you scumbags on the american side and keep for now, me fishing on the better side, the Canadian side of course. If there is anybody who is fishing the Canadian Side of Rainy Lake but Partying the night away on the good ol American side than to you I am impressed. Congratulations and Good Luck Kids, There isn't many of us maybe 11, or 12. Our fishing team comprises 6, it use to be 7 so I figure there might be 6 of you'ze out there tops. I want to know where the 6 of you have caught walleyes in the days leading up to and past my first visit this spring to Canadian Rainy. This Topic should mark only walleye catchings by detail on the North Shore of Rainy. Benifits of this Topic shall be provided to you in statistical patterning that will ultimately catch the 6 of you Giant Fall Walleyes, Spring Walleyes Next Year, and keep everyone entertained for this one. This Topic hopes to generate communtiy. I like the booyees, the red the green they rope across and down the whole midsection of rainy. The walleye's are out in this sludge. Walleye's will be suspended today out in the midst of the firce international waters. Sincerely, Captain H Oban"
