557586,Guest,2006-05-23 19:13:00,0,"How about a less remote camp? Where we go in Ontario (Lake St. Joseph), you can drive within 3 miles of camp, then boat across to camp. Still very remote, superb fishing. Medical facility in Pickle Lake, 30 clicks down the road from the boat ramp. Rent a SAT phone for the trip, making arrangements ahead so you know who to call for medical services, including float plane, etc., and all the suggestions that Bob P. offered, including making sure that the camp operator is aware and on board. I'm sure there are a number of camps like this one where medical help can be more promptly available if needed. Hope I have somebody that cares enough to take me fishing when I'm an old geezer. Father in law is lucky to have you. Good luck. John"
557587,Guest,2006-05-23 19:17:00,0,"My grandfather went on a fishing trip in the Bahamas several years ago with a group of his friends. On the second day of the trip one of his friends had a heart attack and passed away. It took my grandfather and one of his other close friends on the trip the better part of a week to transport the boby back into the the States. The law enforcement agency down there had to do a criminal investigation and prove he had passed from natural causes and all sorts of paperwork needed to be done in order to clear customs. I personally think one last trip with your father-in-law would be an excellent last chapter in his life, however if he is not able to make it through the trip you and your family need to be prepared to handle the emotional toll of losing a loved one and also dealing with the headache of getting back in the country. I would also inform the outfitter you are using of the situation so they are prepared in case anything should happen. I recommend looking into renting your own satellite phone to have on you at all times."

I have dealt with the death of tourist plenty of times, more than I care to count. Bring the med list bring a brief history, and bring insurance. Have fun and do not worry about the what if's. contact me at [email protected] with any questions. Trust me this is not an unusual occurence."
557591,Guest,2006-05-23 20:31:00,0,We Ice Fish with a gentleman who carries his own defib with him. We are trained in its use. He carries on with his disability the best he can. He is already on borrowed time as we all are. Go fish and enjoy...by the way life is very fleeting ....he may outlive all of us. Best of luck.
557543,czy42strokes,2006-05-23 09:50:00,419,"My father in law has chronic heart failure. He is in the final stage and was given 6 months to live and that expired back around xmas...so my concern is he is determined to fish one last time in canada. We are back in the bush. It takes 2 hours by boat and one hour on gravel to get back to Ear Falls, Ontario...There is a lodge that we can get to that has a sat phone to call the OPP. Anyone experienced this?"
557546,Guest,2006-05-23 10:17:00,0,Should he stay home so he doesn't mess up your trip?
557547,Trailerguy,2006-05-23 10:22:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Well, a few years back a fellow suffered a heart attack while fishing out of a remote camp southwest of Perrault Falls. They used a Sat.phone to call an ambulance out of Dryden. The lodge owner got him into his pickup and went to meet the ambulance at the junction of hwy 105 and Aeurbous Road. The ambulance came part way, turned around and went back because they were lost. By the time it made a second trip, and the OPP got there the fellow had passed. The OPP threated the lodge owner and his pickup as a crime scene until it was proven the fellow passed naturally. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
557550,Guest,2006-05-23 10:40:00,0,My Grandfather went on his last trip to canada with us knowing that he was passing away shortly with Cancer. He had been told he had 3 to 6 months to live and our trip came 2 months after the 6 month period. He made it through the trip and passed about three weeks after we got home. I remember how happy he was with every minute of the trip. He told us all that the only thing he loved more than fishing was his family. I will never forget the happiness that was on his face that week. It is the way I remember him. We knew there was a risk of him passing on the trip but the risk was worth the reward.....To this day every time I fish the spots that I fished with him it brings him and the 30 years that I fished with him clearly into view. And the view is great.
557551,czy42strokes,2006-05-23 10:47:00,419,He spends most of his day in bed only to get up to eat. Every effort on his part wears him down. With only 15 % of his heart left it is hard on him. I guess we will do our best and carry him out to the boats and up to the cabin when needed. He is a proud and tough old bird...I guess we will call the float plane in if needed and let him enjoy his last canadian adventure.
557552,rpieske,2006-05-23 10:50:00,1276,"Well, I can certainly understand your father-in-law's desire to make what may be his final trip to Canada. I would die happy if I passed on while fishing on LOTW. However, there are some compromises he should be willing to make in order to make things easier if he should have a problem. He needs to fish from a location that can easily be reached by ambulance, not a remote location. He needs to have all his medical records along, plus medications so that hospital personnel can properly treat him. He should be aware of the tremendous burden of responsibility he is placing on those fishing with him, the camp owners and all the other guests. If he should die while there, all of them will be affected and disrupted. So, he should try to minimize that impact. Fishing out of a remote location will put a lot of strain on everyone if something happens. Had it happen in our family on a trip through the Panama Canal. My brother-in-law's brother-in-law had a heart attack and died on the boat. It was an ordeal for them to get the body out of the country and back home. Canada is a foreign country and it will complicate matters. Years ago, my father's best friend and Canada fishing partner of 25 years had brain cancer and a couple of surgeries. We knew he was dying and did take him on a final trip to LOTW. We were prepared to take the risk and took resonable steps to reduce what impact it would make on the camp. Fortunately, he didn't die on the trip and it was a great experience for all of us. I hope the same for you and your father-in-law. I urge you to openly discuss this with him and make good choices. Let us know how it turns out. I'll keep you all in my prayers."

We called a funeral home with whom we had discussed the matter prior. They sent the coroner to the site and took him away. The police were given a copy of the death certificate afterwards and had no problems with any of it. If I'm that far along, thats pretty much how I'd want it to end. You will likely have much greater hoops to jump through not being reesidents, but it seems a great and fitting end for someone."
557561,Guest,2006-05-23 12:36:00,0,About 20 years ago our church group did a canoeing trip on the Gunflint Trail in northern Minnesota and one of our adult leaders suffered a heart attack in the middle of nowhere. He would of died on the spot but a passing group just happened to be a campsite over and they were boy scouts who knew CPR. They got him breathing again and we made a huge smokey fire to alert authorities who flew in a plane and took him out. He lives to this day but I think about it all the time that someone was looking over him that day as what are the odds that a group of scouts just happened to be there to save him.
