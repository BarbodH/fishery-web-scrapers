Go to www.stcroixrods.com If you are determined to spend the entire $300 on a rod, then go buy a G.Loomis as those are great rods, but pricey. Nice gift idea. I wish you were my wife"
557041,Guest,2006-05-09 13:40:00,0,"Me thinks Dud still ""Legend In His Own Mind"" Anyfisherman who has ever fished with a Ugly Stick and a sensitive rod will tell you that the Ugly Stick is a good overall rod but it cant compare to a sensitive rod designed for Walleye Fishing. However that doesent mean that you cant catch fish on a Ugly Stick. Most Pros dont use Ugly Sticks ...probably because they like a lighter more sensitive rod. Fishing for a living as opposed to living to fish."
557042,Capn Hooker,2006-05-09 14:41:00,333,Pros don't use ugly sticks ... because Ugly Stick isn't their sponsor. That's the difference between fishing for a living and living to fish.
557043,Guest,2006-05-09 14:46:00,0,Good point....however Ugly Stick probably couldnt get a Pro to use their rods unless they paid him enough to retire on. I do have some Ugly Sticks that I use for Catfishing....strong rods but have the feel of a broomstick.
557044,Capn Hooker,2006-05-09 14:51:00,333,I take it you don't like Ugly Sticks. That's OK. Your choice. I have two which I use strictly for walleye fishing. Strong rods with a sensitive tip. These are the 6 ft. Med. action spinning rods. Great for jigging. The other sizes don't react the same way. Check them out at the store. You'll see what I mean.
557046,Guest,2006-05-09 15:16:00,0,Hooker...I like Ugly Sticks for Cat Fishing....may try the smaller version for Walleye. Thanks for the tip.
557053,River_eye,2006-05-09 17:06:00,1486,"Ugly sticks are meant to be abused. If you can take care of your rods, there is no reason to buy an ugly stick, there isn't much sensativity in an ugly stick. When I worked at Totem lodge, they had a lot of ugly sticks for their guests. Good for this application, as rental rods are often broken, but too often, I had to give my guests my rods so they could start feeling the bites."
557054,jimbo,2006-05-09 18:05:00,223,Why not buy him a one of a kind custom made rod?
557058,Guest,2006-05-09 20:07:00,0,the pole makes a big difference in walleye fishing. you can't skimp on a good pole!
557083,Guest,2006-05-10 07:36:00,0,"Bass pro Walleye signiture series are hard to beat , I got one for bottom bouncin and one for jiggin. lite and sensitive reasonably priced about $ 80-100 depended what u get."
557112,Guest,2006-05-10 19:46:00,0,I don't claim to know everything but while jig fishing I feel bites by my index finger. With your finger on the line you could feel the bite even if your reel was connected to a boat oar. Just my 2 cents
556972,Guest,2006-05-08 13:59:00,0,"Want to get my Husband a new Fishing Pole for his Bday, what kind do you gentleman recommend. He goes to Canada Walleye fishing twice every year and he jig fishes most of the time. I have saved up the money($300) to get him a good one so please help me."
556994,Guest,2006-05-08 16:03:00,0,"G Loomis 6'6"" medium with fast tip. Great jig rod."
556997,fishmaster,2006-05-08 17:11:00,209,"St. Croix or Fenwick 6'6"" med or med light fast action."
556999,Guest,2006-05-08 18:00:00,0,"Both the previous answers are very good poles. Do you want a reel to go with it? If so, I personally like a Shimano the best. Shimano has a number of spinning reels to fit your needs and wallet. ...IA Walleye"
557019,Guest,2006-05-09 08:30:00,0,"Get him a nice 6'6"" or 7' medium, or medium/heavy action Ugly Stick, with a Fluger reel. Spend about $100, use the other $200 on yourself. Boom, you're both happy. No need to spend all your cash, seriously."
557020,Guest,2006-05-09 08:45:00,0,"walleye rod, not pike dud. that would probably make a good carp rig."
557025,Guest,2006-05-09 09:30:00,0,"Great point. Same setup, just light or medium action rod, 5'6"" or 6' rod. Ugly Stick - can't break 'em."
557026,Guest,2006-05-09 09:30:00,0,"Went to Cabelas last night and bought him a Fenwick with a Symentre reel. Could not wait to give it to him so I gave it last night. He loved it and I got a big thank you complete with kiss and hug. thanks for all your help,Happy Wife"
557034,Guest,2006-05-09 10:50:00,0,"If you would have taken Dud's advice, I'm sure he would have pretended that he liked it."
557040,Guest,2006-05-09 13:15:00,0,I guarantee I catch more fish on my ugly stick than you do on your $400 get-up. :0
