557514,River_eye,2006-05-22 19:51:00,1486,"1. A set of text with no source is not proof. I'm guessing the source of that article is the US government, trying to make US farmers feel like they are lucky compared to elsewhere. Those numbers sound suspect to me. 2. there is the Canadian Agricultural Income Stabilization program, but that isn't a subsidy, it's more or less a safety net to keep farmers from going bankrupt due to US and European subsidies. 3. An article about beef farmers would be more appropriate for this topic, there is virtually no wheat growing here. Are you in any way implying that farmers have it easy? BTW, In 2004 (last statistic reported) The net farm income for all of ontario was $423,708 that means there was $423,708 shared between every farmer in Ontario. Source: statistics canada http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/agri02f.htm I think you'd be complaining too if you were a farmer."
557516,Le pickerel,2006-05-22 20:46:00,18,"The poor guy just asked where the best place to buy beef in ""KENORA"", I don't think he asked for a flippin farm debate. He's probably sorry he asked the question and will bring steaks from home. Le pic"
557519,River_eye,2006-05-22 21:22:00,1486,"hahaha:-) Just saying, there are some great local products available here in the Rainy River District, and the retailers and local economy genuinely appreciates your support."
557522,Guest,2006-05-22 22:11:00,0,"thanks for the info, i will be stopping on saturday for some great steaks. i appreciate the help. i do find it interesting the self righteous people that always want to start controversy. maybe next time i will ask 'why dont your share your earnings' and maybe someone will show me a good place for lobster! thanks again Eric"
557535,River_eye,2006-05-23 08:40:00,1486,"haha, that's for sure. I will contact them to make sure they will be there this saturday. Eric"
557538,River_eye,2006-05-23 09:10:00,1486,"Put my foot in my mouth, their steaks are only special order this time of year, so if you'd like to pick some up on Saturday, email them at [email protected]"
557598,River_eye,2006-05-23 22:07:00,1486,"just ate an elk sirloin tonite for the first time, loved it."
557425,dewyg,2006-05-19 07:50:00,1006,Consumer Frosted in Kenora has top notch beef. The farmers market in Fort Frances is a pain to get in with a boat. Frosted has parking acroos the street at shoppers drug mart. I have tried the grub from the farmers market and find no difference plus it is a little pricy.
557426,River_eye,2006-05-19 08:39:00,1486,"1. The parking lot at the market is a complete drive through, no need to turn around, I don't know what market you visited. 2. There is a difference in farmers market food, it hasn't spent days on a transport truck. And you know you are supporting the local community. Agricultural producers are having a tough time in the US and Canada, and farmers markets are a way for them to capture the full market value for their product."
557449,dewyg,2006-05-20 13:47:00,1006,"I take it you have a vested interest in the market. Have you spent much time at the ""drive thru"" parking lot on a weekend, pulling a boat? The place is tight at the best of times and on weekends it is difficult at times to get in with just a vehicle."
557454,River_eye,2006-05-20 21:19:00,1486,"As a matter of fact, I do have a vested interest in the farmers market, and every farmers market in North America. My chosen profession is sustainable agriculture and sustainable rural communities, where I study dynamics between resource, community and economic health. I'm not from Rainy River District and have no business investments here, but I am doing an internship here right now. I take it you probably aren't familiar with the crisis facing North American Farmers right now. PS, if it's the parking lot that's stopping you, there is a very huge canadian tire parking lot right beside the market."
557477,dewyg,2006-05-21 21:07:00,1006,They want more government money!!!!!!!! One word Sibsidized!
557483,Skyraptor,2006-05-22 05:56:00,291,"""I take it you probably aren't familiar with the crisis facing North American Farmers right now."" Yeah when they are doing well they don't share the wealth and when they are doing poorly they whine and complain about how the gov't needs to help them."
557494,dewyg,2006-05-22 08:50:00,1006,Well said Mr. Skyraptor
557510,River_eye,2006-05-22 17:16:00,1486,"You may be interested to learn that Canadian farmers are not subsidized by anything other than their second job. There is legislation against subsidies in Canada. The canadian farmers are protesting in our nations capital on a regular basis because it has been a strugle to break even in the last few years. Their biggest enemy is consumer ignorance, and you have demonstrated that very well thankyou very much."
557511,River_eye,2006-05-22 17:20:00,1486,"I'm not sure what you're saying at all, by farmers not sharing the wealth when they do well. What is doing well? and how does one go about sharing wealth? Are you inferring that farmers don't give as much to charity as you or somthing? Please explain."
557512,dewyg,2006-05-22 17:29:00,1006,"News Releases It sounds like a Prairie complaint. To make the comparison even more complete, the Ontario farm lobby has discovered that American farm subsidies are far higher than Canadian farm subsidies Ontario farmers most heavily subsidized in Canada, study shows For every dollar an Ontario farmer earned over the last decade, federal and provincial governments provided an average of $6.10 in subsidies. June 13/2002 Saskatchewan farmers receive $3 in subsidies for every $1 in profits, study shows July 26/2000 Newfoundland and Ontario Have Canada's Most Heavily Subsidized Farms, New Study Shows June 22/2000 Ontario wheat growers will receive an immediate $15 per tonne increase in their initial payments from the Ontario Wheat Producers Marketing Board to assist with cash flow this spring. The money is an advance on the final payments for wheat sold in the 2001-02 crop year. The advance will total about $10 million. As they say here is the proof."

557356,River_eye,2006-05-17 12:43:00,1486,"Why not try and purchase some local beef from here in the Rainy River District. There is also elk available. Are you coming from Manitoba, or up through rainy river district? There will be a farmers market in Kenora selling local beef starting soon."

557397,Guest,2006-05-18 11:28:00,0,"I would certainly go to Consumer's Frosted Foods on Matheson St. Most of the local restaurants, hotels and resorts purchase from them. I know personally I do..Excellent quality and prices"
557400,River_eye,2006-05-18 13:34:00,1486,"You will be passing directly past Cornell Farms then. You may phone them at (807) 486-3477. Awesome beef! from a very well known farm. If you are passing through on a Saturday, the Clover Valley FArmers Market is open from 9am till 2pm, and it's just behind Canadian tire, they sell products there. I think their email is [email protected] If you are interested in trying some elk products, Kim Cornell's sister, Deb Cornell farms them, their email is [email protected] Try them, you won't regret it! Tell them Eric sent you!"
557401,River_eye,2006-05-18 13:36:00,1486,"You'd be surprised to know that there are over 20,000 head of cattle produced in the Rainy River District in a year, and it's actually excellent forage producing country here."
