557191,Troutbeck,2006-05-13 06:44:00,682,Next year I will be going to Winnepeg in mid-October for a conference. I'd like to add on a short fishing trip if at all possible. Does anyone know what the weather is like and what some fishing possibilities might be? I'll be flying in so I won't have room for much equipment (if any). Maybe a guided trip of some kind? I may be able to rustle up another guy or two if necessary. Thanks much.

Other years cold and damp. I don't keep weather data so it's off the top of my head. Prepare for cold and damp. As for fishing, here in Winnipeg and area, walleye, or greenbacks as they are locally called, are on the run in the Red and Winnipeg river (Pine Falls). As for trout (fly) fishing, I not familiar with it."

It was snowing when we pulled into camp but the weather warmed up and everyone talked about it being Indian summer. Every gas station we stopped at the operator would look at the boat and say: ""You comin up here for the ducks, Aye?"" When we told them we're fishing they all gave us a funny sort of look. Walleye fishing was excellant but pike fishing was unusual. Instead of fishing top water and weed beds, the pike where all hanging low off the points and rocks near deep water. We had to fish them a lot like fishing for walleye but with bigger jigs and terminal gear. Very slow crankbaits and deep trolling worked and we did catch some sizeable fish. Only time I ever caught pike this way and we had a guide teach us how to fish for them like this. Could've left all my Rapala's, spinners and spoons home."

Great town, and greater people...! Steve"

The Greenback run should be in full swing. A search here on WC will give you lots of info. Selkirk is just 20 minutes or so north of Winnipeg, Pine Falls is an hour and a half. I'll be in Pine Falls from Oct 7-15, if it works for you I'm sure we could find room in the boat for a day or two, you wouldn't need to bring anything other than warm clothes. October in this country can bring just about anything for weather. It could be a t-shirt day, or it could be snowing so hard you can't see 50 feet. Generally speaking, you don't want to be the one sticking your hand in the minnow bucket. PM me if your interested. There are quite a few guide options available as well. If it were me, I'd be trying to stay a few extra days to experience the fishing in Mb in October - it's great. Non-Resident, Non-Canadian, licenses are about $30.00."
