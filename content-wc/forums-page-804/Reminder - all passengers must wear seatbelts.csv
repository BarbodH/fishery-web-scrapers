541213,BIGEYEJOHN,2004-06-28 14:52:00,95,"It is State law here in Minnesota that ALL passengers must wear a seat belt, be sure you know the laws before you enter another country or state. Makes sense to me."
541214,Guest,2004-06-28 15:05:00,0,I agree - the law makes sense - didn't state that right
541223,bigfish1965,2004-06-28 22:35:00,3210,That's one of the laws where there is no warning or exceptions. You will get a ticket everytime for no seatbelts.
541225,cast_and_blast,2004-06-29 07:50:00,1098,"Not quite right on the MN law: ""Since 1986, Minnesota has had a mandatory seat belt law. Minn. Stat. 169.686 requires that a fastened seat belt be worn by: 1) the driver; 2) a passenger riding in the front seat; and 3) a passenger riding in any seat of a passenger vehicle who is older than three but younger than 11 years of age.""
