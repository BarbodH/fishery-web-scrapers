541235,Guest,2004-06-29 20:45:00,0,I am taking my family to Eagle lake on the 10th of July. What is the bug situation going to be like? We are camping in our pop-up camper. I seen a post below that a guy was thankful he had his rain suit on while fishing and that his hands were the only thing exposed. Thanks Steve

I & my group started (4 years ago) to take one 250-300mg. tablet of vitamin B1 a day, at least 10 days before the trip & every day there. Lots of people think it's bunk, but 4 years have proved it to us. Others at camp are swattin' & swearing & our group look at each other & say ""guess this stuff DO work!"" 100 tablets cost $3 or $4 at Wal-Mart. Cheap! You may want to check with your doctor, to make sure it will do you no harm, & take some 100% deet, bug net for your head & maybe some light gloves just to be safe. I take mine all summer now & bites are few & far apart. 50 days & counting! Wishin' I was fishin'"
