541154,Guest,2004-06-25 10:46:00,0,I was wondering if anyone has been to the Gullrock recently and how is the fishing? I also would like to know if the may fly hatch has started yet? Thanks Jeff
541171,2746,2004-06-26 08:17:00,3206,Was up during week of 6/12 so don't know if I can help you. Fishing was excellent and most were over the slot. The Mayfly hatch depends on water temp. and it was not yet warm enough when we were there. If it's been as cool there as here this past week I doubt if it's begun but they have to be getting close. Need a response from the Red Lake area on that question.
541184,Guest,2004-06-27 14:52:00,0,Jeff; When are you heading up? Friends of mine were there memorial Day weekend. They got tired of catching walleye. Biggest was 12#'s. One of the guys had never been there and he just rolls hi eyes. They caught them where they had never fished. Hope you have good luck.
541187,Guest,2004-06-27 17:07:00,0,"Just got back from Gullrock for the first time (6/19-6/25). The weather was a significant challenge, with several cold fronts moving through. Winds were 20-40 mph daily for the entire trip. Lodge owner told us that the week set a new record for cold temperatures. It also rained on and off each day. Apparently there was a blocking high pressure center over Ontario that caused all of this. The water temperature was between 54-59 degrees but unfortunatey moved backwards the week we were there. Not ideal conditions for agressive fish or fishing. Having said that, we spent 12-15 hours per day on the water. We did quite well on the walleyes despite the weather, particularly in the a.m. and p.m.. Drifting with Lindy rigs or jigs and minnows was our most productive method. One 2 hour evening we caught about 50 between two guys in 2 hours. Another evening we caught 25 in 2 hours. We also caught them on leeches and crawlers but not as well I would assume due to the cold water. Our top producing areas were the toe and heel of the boot and off of clay banks in 10 to 15' of water. We caught a variety of sizes of walleyes ranging from good eaters to 26"". I was very impressed with the quantity and size of the walleyes caught. Our biggest disappointment was the pike. We did not catch many casting spoons, spinner baits, crankbaits, bucktails, jerkbaits or frozen ciscos on bottom. The relatively few that we did catch were caught incendental to walleyes on minnows. Our lodge owner told us that most pike on Gullrock are caught by walleye fishermen or in May right after ice out when they are spawning in shallow bays. I did manage to catch a 36"" on a Lindy rig and minnow which was a very fun experience. I talked to a group in camp that has fished Gullrock for 4 years and they said it was the worst week for walleye numbers caught they had ever experienced they also said that from there experience, pike are not as common on Gullrock Lake as the lodges promotional materials might have you believe but the ones that are present are very large. Despite the weather I would rate Gullrock Lake as a very good to excellent walleye fishery even though we may not have experienced its best. As far as pike, I know a group that goes each year the week after ice out and catches good numbers and size to 46"". I am confident it is a trophy pike fishery but am uncertain as to the numbers of pike in the lake compared to other Ontario lakes. I think most people fish Gullrock for the walleyes. Good luck to all and I wish you good weather as well."

541195,Guest,2004-06-28 08:26:00,0,We will be going up the week of July 17-24 and will be staying at Five Lakes Lodge. This will be our 6th year for us. Hopefully the may fly hatch will be over. Thank You for the comprehensive report. Jeff
541199,Guest,2004-06-28 08:46:00,0,"Jeff, How have you done on the pike on other trips to Gullrock? Hump1, There was a 10 minute wait entering Canada and 2 hours leaving on Friday at 1:00. Homeland security was quite thorough...the may x-ray your boat. We stayed at Goldenhook and the camp appeared to be fully occupied. What has your experience on the pike in Gullrock been?"
541205,Guest,2004-06-28 10:25:00,0,"Wow - two hour wait on Friday. We normally cross about 11:00 a. m. on Friday, never have had to wait. Guess I better expect it. I normally don't fish pike, just walleye. I have friends that fish strictly northern and do very well hitting the weedlines. they also fish three sisters and Fisherman point every year and get 42' etc. I normally get several a year and of course have ""lost"" the big one many times."
541210,Guest,2004-06-28 12:28:00,0,"I do not fish pike at all except for the one's that hit my bottom bouncers or jigs. I understand that the river between Gullrock and two island is suppose to be good and the Chakuni river entering Keg. Where is fisherman's point, is that the boot? Thanks Jeff"
541218,Guest,2004-06-28 17:52:00,0,Fisherman's Point is the island( point of) across from three sisters
