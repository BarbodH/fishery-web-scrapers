Anything flashy will work. I've caught the biggest pike on the cheapest crap But it works!! Try any big plastics, I like to throw lizzards on jigs and I catch nice Pike. Have fun Tim"

Its on that lure they only sell in canada. its about 10 inches long has a single long stem hook, one 1 inch type leaf on it thats on a wire about 6 inches long that also has a couple of red beads on it. with a minnow on it everthing goes for it. sorry I dont know the name. its about 2 bucks and comes in different colors."

541166,Guest,2004-06-25 17:46:00,0,"thanks guys. i'll pick up a few of the suggested items. by the way, i have some chesapeake bay spoons (4.25"") that i think i'll try. tony acceta pets size 17 in silver and white. my guess is that gators will hit them as fast as a blue or a rock. we'll see. any more ideas would be appreciated."
