I thought about this after we talked about Broad Lake on the dock that day, but I was already up to Ghost Narrows when I realized you might not know about it. Sorry, wish I'd of thought about it sooner. Did it every stop raining? Ron S."

The fishing stayed good for the 2 weeks we were there, caught around 400 eyes while there. Talked to Blair a couple of days ago, he said the weather & water got colder after we left & the fishing slowed a bit. We are going to be up there for 2 weeks again next yr, starting 6/3. Keep in touch."
