We are looking forward to 7 days in the back country and can't wait to get in on some of the fine fishing up north of the border. This will be the first trip to Canada for most of the boys and I'd like to help make it a memorable one for them. We've heard about the great smallmouth fishing but we'd also like to get into some Walleye for shore lunch and camp dinner. Should we be using jigs, cranks, leeches? What's the best way to rig leeches for this type of fishing? Any advice on patterns/presentations/etc for this time of year is appreciated. Thanks!"

541037,Guest,2004-06-22 00:29:00,0,"I did this trip a bunch of years ago in July out of Atikokan. Spent 8 days in the wilderness and never forgot it. Twister tails, power bait or Gulp would be easier and just as effective as live bait. Any place below a rapids was easy pickings for walleyes and smallies with the occasional northern. After camp was set up, we would occasionally troll with #7 shadraps by tucking the rod under your legs and paddling. Some lakes also had lakers. Also any cabbage patch was a guaranteed pike. You'll have a great time camping on the many islands. I still remember the route we took. I still bring out the maps and pictures from time to time. Best of luck. Winneconne"
541039,Guest,2004-06-22 07:04:00,0,"Back in the late 70s, throughout the 80s and early 90s, I did a trip into the Boundary Waters/Quetico at least once a year for a week or more. My fishing buddies and I are getting older and soft, so we do trips to LOTW and other lakes now. However, my canoe trips will always be some of my favorites. I echo what the prior guys said as well. For me, I would have a number of shad raps (SR-7 or even larger sizes) in the silver with black back, perch and crawdad colors. You can catch smallies, walleyes and northern on those. A few floating rapalas (5.25"" in silver w/black back) are great for twitching on the surface for smallies and northern. A few mepps musky killers or No. 5's for northerns (with an occaisional bonus smallie), and for the walleyes I would take 1/8, 1/4 and 3/8 oz. jigs (chartreuse, green, orange or any combo of those colors) and power bait 3"" grub bodies or 4"" or 5"" finesse worms (chartreuse, brown, orange, white, pumpkinseed colors). The same jig and grub or worm combo is also great for smallies. For the smallmouth, look for shorelines with round boulders anywhere from bushel basket size on up. If there are scattered weeds here in there, all the better. If there is a nice drop off in those areas, let the jig fall down off the drop off and often you'll find walleye will hit on the fall. Anywhere you find weeds, you might find northern. For summer walleye fishing, the suggestion to focus on water falls is a good one. However, if you can, think about taking a portable depth finder with you. If you can find some long tapering points, some reefs or rock humps in 15-20 feet of water, you might be able to jig up a shore lunch or dinner in a hurry. Just putting this down on the message board brings back lots of great memories. Have fun, be safe, and good luck."

I have done many trips through Sturgeon, Poobah, Mcree and William just to name a few, I have been doing it since the 70's, don't bother with live bait or salted minnows either, a couple of other things to try are spoons and swimming jigs, the ones that look like a minnow and the Mepps with the rubber minnow on it, that one whacks and stacks alot of fish too. also, just use unpainted jig heads because you will go through alot."

From there I'm not sure how much portaging we'll be doing. Probably camping among the islands and day tripping from there. Thanks for all the tips - sounds like no need for leeches. One of the group that has been to Quetico suggested leeches would make the fishing easier for some of the younger boys. Can't wait - only 4 more weeks! Jacknife"

I also drifted bottom bouncers in a canoe and did well. They are easy to keep alive, and do not take up much space. Keep the leaches in a wide mouth water bottle (Nalgene bottles work well) and change the water twice a day and you can bring have a pound of leachs with you. Do not mistake the Nalgene leach bottle with your water bottle in the dark and you will make the trip more enjoyable."
541242,MK,2004-06-30 08:14:00,322,"I've been in Quetico a few times in the summer and its hard to say where to start. We caught fish on about everything we used. Taking leeches would probably help and I'd just put them on a small jighead, stuck once through the mouth, and toss them around submerged rocks 10-15' deep, for smallies. For anything else, you can troll with shallow diving Rapalas (we always have good luck with the gold/black, shallow diver, 2 1/2 to 3"" size)or other crank baits, Hot n Tots, etc. But at $3-$4 each, you might want to be careful with these with a bunch of Scouts. If I was taking a group, I'd take a sackful of jigs, various color plastics (pumpkinseed, motor oil, white) and some good wire leaders; Lots of pike. We took in a box of crawlers and had good luck. At camp, we always dug a hole about a foot deep and buried the box and they stayed alive all week. Put them on a jig or Erie Dearie and had great luck. We caught lots of pike and walleye on spoons. My favorite was a small 5 of Diamonds, yellow with red diamonds. By the end of the week, the paint was nearly chewed off entirely. Williams Wablers, hammered brass color worked great too. Good Luck and have fun. Just be in your tent by dark, the mosquitoes will carry you away after dark. During the day, they were never a problem. Bug spray was handy on the portages but there are so many buggers after dark that it didn't help much."
