Was up there in May of 02 before the spawn and the fishing for the males was beyond belief--this trip in the middle of June was good fishing but not great IMO. compared to early 02 the water was much higher in 02 where it comes over those falls. We caught plenty of fish to eat never bring any home but it was a little diffferent post spawn compared to pre spawn. That is beautiful country up there and I want to thank our neighbors to the north for your great friendships and for sharing your great lands with us michigan folk. len
