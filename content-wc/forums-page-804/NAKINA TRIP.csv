We kept only what we ate and released the other. Many eyes in the 15 to 22"" size with the largest pike being 42"" and many more over 32"". A week of fishing in very bad weather netted us over 1650 fish. No live bait used. Jigs and spoons with twister tails accounted for the majority of the fish.:-)"
541180,Guest,2004-06-27 11:15:00,0,Which lake did you fish?
541197,Guest,2004-06-28 08:35:00,0,"Fished Melchett Lake. Have fished Makoki, Meta, Kap also. Used this outfitter 9 times with #10 next summer. Need other info, just ask."
541221,Guest,2004-06-28 19:12:00,0,"Used to stay on Kap, sometimes twice a year for about 11 years. Great walleye fishing on both Kap Melchett. Would still be going, but take my grandsons now and that gets a bit pricey, so I go to drive to lake in Armstrong. Great memories though. Just wondering if you have a certain place that you stay before your fly in. We stayed with Remi Levesque at Northern Native Crafts the night before the flight. He had bait for us, a nice place to stay over-night (cheap), and Remi was always helpful. We always flew in with Leuenbergers. but I know AWO has a great reputation. The worst part was always having to wait until the next year to roll around."
541230,Guest,2004-06-29 15:40:00,0,"Just wondering, Bode, where do you drive to now in Armstrong?"
541233,Guest,2004-06-29 19:04:00,0,"We drive to Caribou Lake. It's a 22,000 acre lake that has 3 outfitters on it. We have a friend here that has gone the past 19 years and claimed the fishing was good, but we were doing fly ins at that time and didn't pay much attention. Then this past year we went up in late July and found the fishing very good and not really many people around at all. There are some portage lakes that have boats cached on them that we didn't try last year, but plan to this year. We'll be leaving July 23rd for a week and I'd be glad to let you know how we did. Our friend just got back last week and said he didn't do as well as usual, but I noticed the weather in Ontario was colder than normal and the winds were pretty strong. The lake has pike, walleye, and some lake trout. We target walleye only. I think the fella that owns Twins Lakes Outfitters in Nakina used to own one of the resorts on Caribou. Anyway, we had a good time and I've been going to Canada each year since 1978 and I was pleased with the numbers and size of the fish and the accomodations were fine."
