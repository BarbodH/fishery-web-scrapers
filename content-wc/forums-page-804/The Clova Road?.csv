Also, how hungry have the black flies been? And, oh by the way, has anyone reurned from O'Sullivan (or any other lakes in that neighborhood) and how's the fishing? Thanks in advance."

On the way out it was raining lightly which made things better by keeping down the *%$*&^ dust. Black flies were bad like every year; mosquitoes were worse and we were burning coils in the cabins every night to fight the skeeters. Another group had the mosquito netting inside and slept like babies and I was envious. Stick baits were slow this year (sorry Thunderstick) but jigging, as always, proved sucessful. Have a great trip and say hello to Russell from Andy and Bruce in Philly. Service at the lodge was, as usual excellent and I am always baffled why more people don't know about and go to the lodge at O'Sullivan. It was our 7th straight year and we had an excellent time as always Andy"

All the big ones we got last year were returned and should be bigger this year if we're lucky enough to catch them. Jig, troll, cast...it doesn't matter. Sooner or later the walleyes always hit at O'Sullivan. Glad to hear you had a good trip. This will be year 24 for me. Next stop...The Clova Road and then....."

We were catching 10 per hour at good times on jigs and minnows. Pike fishing good early in morning. We caught 2 10 pounders and many more from 5-7 pounds. Black flies were in peak form. All in all, great trip."
