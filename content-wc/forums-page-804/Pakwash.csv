540948,Guest,2004-06-18 20:56:00,0,Fished there for 15 years only one week each year about June 1st each year. Good Walleye and northern fishing. Where are you staying?
540989,Mo Fisher,2004-06-20 21:37:00,21,"Fished the Southwest end of the lake last July with good success. Lots of northerns, several walleye and enough smallmouth to make it interesting. Will be at the same place 7/18 to 7/25 this year. I would also like to hear if anyone has a resent report. Thanks, Brad"
