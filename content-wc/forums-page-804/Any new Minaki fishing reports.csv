541201,Guest,2004-06-28 09:24:00,0,"I just returned from Minaki Friday 6/25. Weather was bad and fishing was average at best. The water levels were near their all-time high and water temps were in the low 50's. All of the walleyes we caught were deep 20-40 feet. Like others, we caught alot of small fish 10-14 inches and many in the 22-24 inch class. Our biggest was a fat 30 incher caught in big sand. It seems there was a huge gap because we caught very few in the 15-18 inch range, at least we could not find them and I've been fishing Sand lake for 20+ years. We used primarily live bait rigs with leeches and crawlers. Both worked equally well but crawlers had to deal with the perch bite! We did catch good #'s of northerns and several nice muskies 40""+. I think fishing will get alot better as the weather warms and stabilizes. Good luck to all!! Remember CPR, I did!! Insuranceguy"
541202,Guest,2004-06-28 10:02:00,0,Everything 3 of the boats caught were on 3/8 or 1/2 oz. jigs (Chartreuse with orange) and large minnows. Never did get anything on leeches.
541226,Guest,2004-06-29 09:05:00,0,where and how did u catch that 30 incher fishin atournament so i was just wondering.It wouyld be of gret help becuz i hear its tuff to cachthe big ones
540868,Guest,2004-06-16 12:56:00,0,I think that is Minnitaki that you can't have live fish not Minaki.
540870,Guest,2004-06-16 13:11:00,0,"I'm interested to see if anyone has tried the new MaxGap jigs or any of the new items with red hooks up in Minaki yet. Along similar lines as I make some last minute purchases for my trip up next week, I'm interested to hear what you tried that didn't work (i.e. jigs, spinners, trolling with cranks, etc.). Last year I couldn't have enough crawler harnesses and that's the first time I had ever really used them. I've always thought that you have to hit the water up there with all kinds of different techniques and gear, because someone alwasy manages to catch fish up there and it's not always my group. Good luck fishin' Ole"
540875,Guest,2004-06-16 14:19:00,0,"Right on, Danno. :) They all look the same at closing time, eh? Thanks."
540924,Guest,2004-06-17 15:59:00,0,"WAS THERE 5/26-6/1, BAIT RIGS WITH 3/4-1 1/4 OZ 3-5' SNELL, PLAIN OR RED COLORED HOOK, LARGE MINNOW. TRIED SPINNERS AND BEAD COMBOS OF ALL SIZES AND COLORS DID NOT IMPROVE HOOKUPS.DID NOT USE LEACHES OR CRAWLERS. IN THE PAST LEACHES HAVE DONE WELL BUT CRAWLERS HAVE NOT."
540939,Guest,2004-06-18 09:52:00,0,"Fished from 6/12-6/17. Fishing has started to pick up. Fish are scattered, but starting to school up. We fished Little Sand mostly with our best success on crawlers and spinners. Lots of small fish shallow, the bigger fish were deep 30+ feet. Water levels are up, and the current by the bridge is very strong. Roads coming back to Baudette on 6/17 were fine and open."
541119,Guest,2004-06-24 09:49:00,0,"Just got back last night, fished 19th-23rd. Weather was a challenge, windy, wet, cold. Yet still had a good time and caught many wallys-lost count. About 95% were small though (10-12""). Biggest released was 27.5"". Most consistent action was deep in 26-30'. Bigger fish weren't too active due to the extended cold snap. We worked Big Sand(skunked here, except for incidental perch & smallies), Little Sand, Rough Rock, etc, etc. Like a previous report WildEdge produced a few nicer fish. Leeches, crawlers, minnows all worked about same for us overall some better than others depending on location."
541124,Guest,2004-06-24 11:33:00,0,Where did u catch the big one and what depth .Iam fishing there next week.info would help thanx
541128,Guest,2004-06-24 12:33:00,0,"Fished from 6/12 thru 6/17. Had best luck in river currents and deeper than 20 ft. Did well on river in eddies coming off islands. weather was crappy, cold and wet but most of our party averaged 100 walleye days per boat(2 people). Biggest caught and release under power lines in Gun lake was 32+ in. Fish was bigger than measuring trough. Caught her in 35 ft on chartreuse jig and minnow. Most of fish were smaller than last year, but quanity was better once we found fish. Didn't ever have to go up into Big or Little Sand as we were kept busy in Gun and the river (by the house that's submerging just past the trestle)"
541136,Guest,2004-06-24 14:13:00,0,was ther a lot of big fish there fishin a tournament there this weekend
541158,Guest,2004-06-25 12:26:00,0,"Saw about 10 fish over 24"" caught in the 5 days we fished. 4 came from the same spot off the bouy by the power lines."
540707,Guest,2004-06-14 11:59:00,0,"Is there any new Minaki fishing reports from people just returning? I am taking our gropu this weekend and since they do not fish a lot they look to me to point them in the right direction. I would sincerely appreciate any help as far as areas, depths, presentations.... Thanks to all that respond. Slim"
540764,Guest,2004-06-15 11:06:00,0,A group just returned on Sunday and they did not find any fish on Big or Little Sand. They did catch lots of smaller fish in the river at the high lines. Good luck!
540780,Guest,2004-06-15 15:45:00,0,"I heard that the water levels are really coming up fast and there was some talk about the road closing near Nestor Falls? Is there any new info on this? I am leaving for Minaki on Saturday morning and I need to know if I will be able to get through at Nestor Falls. If the road is closed I have to take I-94 to I-29 to Winnipeg and then over to Kenora. I would prefer to cross at Baudette, MN and go that way. Any info on potential road closures would be helpful."

540809,Guest,2004-06-16 10:16:00,0,"I am Leaving Satuday for Minaki as well. Shouldn't be a problem at Nestor. Water levels are stablizing...and might come up a few inches at Minaki. From what I understand, there is still some spawning activity for wallys...although decreasing. Water temp is 55-58f. Should be interesting. Minnows maybe versus leeches?????"

540820,Guest,2004-06-16 12:38:00,0,I returned from Minaki one week ago. We had the worst year as far as numbers but we did catch some big fish. We found enough to eat and to bring home our limits so it was still a success. The fish we caught we all spawned out except for a sauger we caught. Most of the common spots had fish around them but they were not active yet. There was not a specific depth for the fish either. We had them from 35 feet to 5 feet. Only suggestion I have is if you graph fish stay with them.
