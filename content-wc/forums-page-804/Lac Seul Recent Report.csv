541086,tly,2004-06-22 19:53:00,1900,"THis was a checkpoint by the MNR, not the police. These folks could only arrest you for game/fish violations but would bet if the y found any smokeables etc they would radio ahead. There were about 20 officers, 10 or so trucks. THe first officers direected traffic slowing you down and then the next one would point you to a parking place. Once you hit that officer A would collect licenses and ask the where you been/where you going stuff. During that time (after having been asked very politely can we rip your stuff apart) our boat was uncovered, the pickup examined and all coolers, livewells as well as anythjing that could possibly hide fish were looked at. Gotta reiterate, this was done swiftly, professionally. I do not mind this at all. One further item. Besides the long wait at the border, once we got there the U.S. agent was asking basic questions in a somewhat abrasive way (he only had seen 500 cars so far maybe) but then says go around to the left and they will tell you which line to get into ""I have no control over that"" The line was for the video scanning. We did not get that line fortunately. I would not want their job. Ready to do it all over again. Maybe the highlite of the trip is grandson running out to dad asking when he can go!! (He just turned 3) TLY"

541029,tly,2004-06-21 20:13:00,1900,"Just returned from Chamberlain Narrows area but heard similar reports on other areas. - We got few over slot size, biggest was only 24.x"" - Fewer northern than usual but several 38"" (our biggest=42"") - Many, many in slot - if they survive getting caught regularly the next couple years should be fantastic - Water high, old favorite spots did not produce as anticipated - Leeches did not work well at all but did catch some but not big - Copper/maroon little cleo's did well on both eye's and northern - Mimmic minnows also did well, but not as well as real ones, dead or alive - Powerbaits sucked. Did kind of OK last year 0 this year, used many color choices. At least kept the cost of real bait down while using these as well as protected the fish population. Did I mention the weather? Chilly. windy but not much actual rain. Bugs were minimal. We got torn down south of Dryden on 502 and a 2 hr wait to get back into U.S. The MNR was very thorough and very respectful, kept us only 15 minutes from slowdown to leaving. If they get anyone thats great. One officer commented that is was worth their while to do this. Then reading the posts about the 6x over limit + 40 more at hotel make me even a bigger fan of enforcement. 15 minutes is not a big inconvenience. When you go take a kid and camera with you. TLY Ya gotta go!!!"
541033,Guest,2004-06-21 21:29:00,0,We fished the north east section just south of ear falls and 6 of us caught 450 walleye June 12-17. We only caught 10 walleye the first 2 days and then went to town for leeches and slautered them using leeches with a floater jig in about 4 to 12 feet. Biggest 24 1/4 and about 70 percent were under the slot. Was cold and did not start fishing untill about 10 AM every morning and usually back at the cabin at 6 PM for supper. Caught only about 10 northern between the 6 of us and 29 in. being the largest.
541035,Guest,2004-06-21 21:51:00,0,Sorry but I said we fished the Northeast section but should have said we fished the northwest side.
541038,Guest,2004-06-22 06:09:00,0,"Great report, thanks! Can you please go in to detail about 'getting torn down', did you hit one of those checkpoints by the police? I am going to be doing our driving on the U.S. side of things, my pal will finish the trip in Canada - we planned it that way, because I tend to have a much heavier foot than he does."
541042,Guest,2004-06-22 08:40:00,0,Fishing is picking up. Warmer days coming should help.

541064,tly,2004-06-22 19:42:00,1900,"Back in the ""old days"" when we could camp on crown land we spent alot of years at Banana and Taylor islands. Very very good memories and pictures in scrap book to boot. Son was only 10-11 but got into it, got lotsa pics and memories. I also caught my largest Lac Seul walleye in 2' off of the island just north of Taylor (close to where the flat rocks that eat lower units are). Good to hear you had a great time. Where did you stay? I am not familiar with any camps near there except there was a camp of 3 tents 1 blue large and a couple of domes, boats were out. If you have a formula other than citizenship or a resort I woukd like to know. WE intend for some of us to go back yet this year. TLY"
