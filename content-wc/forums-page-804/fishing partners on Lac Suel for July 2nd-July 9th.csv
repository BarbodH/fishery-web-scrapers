I have been going to a resort south of Ear Falls, (Onaway Lodge) for the last 6 years but family members and friends can't go due to different circumstances. The cost is approximately $500/person if 3 fish out of a boat. This does include most gas and minnows for the week although we do quite well with artificials and night crawlers. It is a great resort with great owners with the best dock and fish cleaning house I have seen. The cabin sleeps 4-5 but 3 are needed to get the cabin. I will be pulling my 17' Tournement Pro with 115 Optimax and would sure like it if there is someone who would consider. Let me know if interested...I sure would hate to miss a year on Lac Seul. Good Fishing and Best of Luck[email protected] or call me at 641-585-5184"

I wanted to take my kids to Onaway over the 4th but also neeeded more people. We had great luck on the opener. Tell Blair and Kathy ""HI"" from Mark, Nate and Autry!, 11 of us stayed in their new cabin for the opener. Good luck fishing!!! PS I have been going up for the opener since 1981 and love it! I have only fished up there once over the 4th of July. I fished the bays and points in McKenzie and did very well. I just don't care for the bugs that time of year."
541172,Guest,2004-06-26 13:34:00,0,Thanks for the reply. I wish I could have posted earlier too. I have been going to Lac Seul for 6 years usually the 1st week of June with 2 brother in laws and families. My 1st year to LacSuel was over the 4th and we hammered the big walleye in McIntyre but have also done well in McKenzie. I could not go our usual week but am really looking forward to this coming week. I will tell everybody Hi for ya and good luck at your cabin. Maybe we will meet again at Onaway. Good Fishin! Rod
