540807,Guest,2004-06-16 09:56:00,0,Does anybody know where you can find some maps of the Minaki area online? I've been looking but I haven't had much luck. I don't need a lot of detail just the outline of the water. Thanks in advance.

540819,Guest,2004-06-16 12:32:00,0,I purchased a map with depth from Thorne Bros. They have their maps online to order I believe. It is a good map.

540880,Guest,2004-06-16 15:51:00,0,"Danno, If you are going to be on the water there you will want to get a good map that shows the depths and the rock reefs. There are a lot of unmarked hazards on the Winnipeg River especially when you leave the main channels. We bought our maps from Big North Lodge (the same as the ones at Thorne Bros). I'm sure most of the lodges have them available. One covers Minaki to Kenora and the other Minaki to the Whitedog dam. They are big (3x4 feet) and have very good detail. Since they are a little big to look at while the boat is moving, we made color copies of the sections we frequent and had them laminated. Here is the link to them on the Thorne Bros site: http://www.thornebros.com/muskie/map...rographic.html I'll be up there June 26th for a week. Good Luck! Don't catch them all though!"
