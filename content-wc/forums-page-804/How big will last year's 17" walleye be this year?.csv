Girth is probably a better indicator of the potential of a particular lake and it's fishery. I've caught some 28"" walleyes that only weighed six pounds. That should have been more like eight pounds. Maybe they were spawned out and still recovering. That was in July. I would have thought that they would have recovered by then. Maybe a biologist could help us out with this question. Pooch"
