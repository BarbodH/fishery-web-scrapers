5072233,The tank,2016-08-20 21:54:00,340,Just wondering where did this shadyroost resort come from. One of there guides and boat with 3 guys in it come in and fished with in 25 yards of us in milesbay. Can't say that I seen them around last year and this year there boats were all over. Hope it don't cost much to stay there cause I sure wouldn't have been to happy with that guide.
5072329,Obabikon,2016-08-21 04:46:00,2370,They boat over almost every day from Nestor Falls. Don't fish any narrow channels... because they're not slowing down either.
5072337,The tank,2016-08-21 05:07:00,340,So there's no fish over by nestor falls? I would think that would be a long boat ride to fish milesbay and little traverse.
5072345,Obabikon,2016-08-21 05:15:00,2370,"I've never fished over there. But, I have to assume that the fishing is better over here. Otherwise why make the trip every day? They go by our resort all the time (3-4 boats almost every day all summer long), heading up to Obabikon Lake to fish Northern Pike after fishing humps in Miles Bay."

5075370,gullrockguy,2016-08-22 12:17:00,44,"many years ago when I worked in the nestor falls area , I used to guide occasionally for shady roost. at that time they were owned by a major oil company in the united states, I think they were headquartered in Shrevesport La. they never took regular guest but they used the resort to reward their dealers and distributors. I think I got 25 bucks a day to guide, (shows you how long ago that was). one day I had the wives of the owners of the oil company for my clients and they did really well, they were happier than poop and gave me a 5 dollar tip for the day. then the husband of one of the wives came down to give me a tip. he had a 5 dollar bill in his hand and when I told him the wife had given me 5 bucks he tucked his back in his pocket and walked away,. I kinda figured that he needed that 5 bucks more than I did, maybe his oil company was in dire financial difficulty."
