5058554,Bigredmf,2016-08-14 08:22:00,129,When I was researching Doda and Father years ago it appeared you needed to go to chibougamau and head southWe flew in once with Guy and the fishing was good but it's pretty big water and only one trip made it difficult to figure outYou could see roads coming in but no clue on getting there say through Senettere.Red Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
