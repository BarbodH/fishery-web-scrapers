5065001,wiwalleyefreak,2016-08-17 03:28:00,25,Planning our trip for next summer and we are planing to try the Minaki area. Specifically we are planning to stay at Sunset Point Resort. Does anyone out there have any experience with this resort or comments on the fishing in the Minaki area. All comments are appreciated.

The only downside is the congestion right around Minaki itself. We stay at Big north Lodge. Which is a few miles South of town and MUCH less chaotic than the lodges right in Minaki."

We have been going 22 years. We always stay at Paradise Park. I have seen Sunset Point but don't know anyone that has stayed there."
5065817,strcrsr,2016-08-17 11:33:00,6,Just returned from Barbers resort in Minaki last week. Earlier than normal trip this year.Depends what your fishing for...I fish only walleye.Big sand is fantastic lake to fish with very little or no congestion.
