5073665,BornToFish,2016-08-21 19:45:00,1224,"Greetings, I just returned from two weeks in Ontario and am just now catching up on emails and Walleye Central. It really doesn't matter to me when I fish in Ontario as I know that I will catch fish whenever I am there. I happen to fish on lakes that I believe to be good to great walleye lakes. The fish are there. The fish eat on a regular basis - e.g. daily. The thing that changes throughout the year is HOW I approach fishing for these walleyes. The earlier parts of the season often feature horizontal presentations in a run and gun presentation. The latter parts of the season are often vertical presentations in a finesse mode. To summarize, be sure to pick a good body of water that has the size and numbers of the walleyes that will satisfy your expectations. Then, pick the time of the year that matches your preference for style of fishing and temperament. For example, an angler that prefers to cast cranks or troll might go crazy vertically jigging a rock hump in mid August. Personally, I prefer to fish in August or better yet, September in NW Ontario for many of the reasons cited by others. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5074282,The tank,2016-08-22 06:00:00,340,I like your thinking.
5068817,Ogoki,2016-08-18 22:18:00,291,"To each their own. I can only go by my experience . I like June OR the last ten days of August. The first outfitter I used at Armstrong would only take the two of us in his slow time , which was the last 2 weeks of July or the fisrt two weeks od August. When we switched outfitters and got to go in June , we saw a DRAMATIC difference. Went several times the end of August and saw a REAL BIG difference in late July or early August. Numerous freinds of mine also saw the same and many went at the end of August for years . In fact, a group i know are leaving tonight for Armstrong . . Remember that far north their season is much shorter than ours . Last week , we woke up one morning to 36 degrees."
5068993,wiwalleyefreak,2016-08-19 05:53:00,25,Guys Thanks for all of the good suggestions and information. We are planning to head to Minaki or LOTW. We are some what flexible on dates so Freytown I would appreciate your suggestions.
5069057,Campcountry,2016-08-19 06:41:00,164,"For Minaki there are so many variables (early/late spring, water flows/levels etc.) that can change where the walleye are during the week(s) you are on your trip. Personally, I like late June better than early June. August is usually a good month but many think that is not the case. It may have something to do with the walleye not being in many of the the same spots as they are in June. Depending on when you go in August the heat may chase you off the water during the day"
5069553,v-bay gord,2016-08-19 10:06:00,3168,I agree with Ogoki. From my experience the latter part of June and the latter part of August are some of the most consistent windows for both musky and walleye.
5069577,wmd,2016-08-19 10:19:00,388,Ditto wmd
5069721,515,2016-08-19 11:36:00,254,I would choose July or August anytime as we usually get better weather and fishing has become more stable and predictable. My group are not numbers or size guys for fishing we prefer to have a good relaxing holiday and catch enough fish for a fish fry everyday but we do fish hard from Sun up to Sun down and have fun doing it.
5069753,Mike Borger,2016-08-19 12:08:00,1554,Real curious to know how your latest trip went Mike!
5073377,Lake Of The Woods,2016-08-21 17:57:00,124,"What area will you be fishing?If it is the Kenora area you are thinking of going my advice would be to go in June.I lived in that area for many years and of course fished and hunted this area.In June the water temps will be much lower and the fish more active and predictable in their feeding cycles along with what habitat they will be residing in.Algae blooms will also not be a major factor which due to depleting oxygen levels can shut fishing down for long periods of time.Also,the thermocline which is normally located in the metalimnion layer of thermal water stratification is distinct and easily located.This area is where the highest level of dissolved oxygen is located and thus that is where the fish will be.June is also the best time to locate Muskie as they can be found not too far from the spawning areas.There are more black flies,mosquitoes and black flies present but if you spend most of the time on the water it won't be to much of an issue.I have always found August to be somewhat less productive when fishing as water temps and fall turnover can slow things down for a couple weeks or so,...depending on the year of course.I would apply this approach to most places in northwestern Ontario."
5073481,The tank,2016-08-21 18:52:00,340,I've fished canada since 1991 and 34 weeks now and I would say for walleyes and musky I'll go mid august over june. The fish are not far from where they are in mid July. I like last week in may first week in june for walleye and smallmouth but weather can be bad.
5073553,Golden Eagle,2016-08-21 19:06:00,2642,because after your June trip there's still the possibility of an August trip the same year. Choosing August takes away a June trip until the next year. July 15 - August 20 have provided me with several great fishing trips. It takes really nasty weather conditions to mess up those 35 days. This year I fished NW Ontario May 14 - May 28. Second trip was July 16 - 23. I wasn't cheated.
5067921,wiwalleyefreak,2016-08-18 12:17:00,25,We typically take our annual trip to Canada in mid-July. We can't make it in July this year so we are trying to decide June or August. Our group is mainly walleye fisherman but we have a few interested in musky as well. I thought I would look to this forum on advice.....June or August?Thanks for your thoughts.
5067985,Jimmy Jig,2016-08-18 13:20:00,1905,Always JUNE
5067993,LOW1,2016-08-18 13:34:00,2828,June. Now if you have a mid to late September option it would be much closer.
5068057,jambi,2016-08-18 13:56:00,504,June. less bugs more fish better weather
5068273,johnboat,2016-08-18 15:34:00,2014,"J-U-N-E. If you are unsure, refer to post 2, 3, and 4."
5068329,Freytown,2016-08-18 15:52:00,770,"First, where are you going?? Early June can be too soon for late ice out lakes....especially walleye. Post spawn is a very slow bite. I would choose June too but the week would depend on the area you're going to fish. FT"
5068337,mswope13,2016-08-18 15:53:00,73,"June, except this year with the weather pattern!"
5068369,Mike Borger,2016-08-18 16:34:00,1554,"Okay I'll be the first one to go against the grain. Definitely August it's by far my favorite month to fish in Canada.Weather is stable, not too hot, not too cold. Bugs are pretty much gone and fishing is always excellent especially for walleye.I find August walleye far more predictable and easy to catch than June fish, although if you don't know what you're doing that may not be the case. As they say it's not the arrow it's the indian."
5068417,Obabikon,2016-08-18 16:49:00,2370,"If I wanted numbers... June If I wanted monsters... August Also, August is by FAR the better month for bugs. I'm up here right now, and there are hardly any left. June you run into mosquitoes, may flies, biting flies, pine flies... just about everything."
5068425,Blue Lk,2016-08-18 16:55:00,269,[QUOTE=wiwalleyefreak;5067921but we have a few interested in musky as well. I thought I would look to this forum on advice.....June or August?
