As always I fished with there guide Corey **** for the first day I was there to get a feel for place. Fished mostly in Big Sand Lake, Rough Rock Channel and found some good evening trolling in Gunn Lake. Caught lots of Walleyes up to 29 inches. Lots of small ones too which shows a healthy fishery. Many Smallmouth up to 19 inches and Pike up to 36"". Bait was 2lb of leeches and a flat of Crawlers. Only a few dozen of each left after 30 days of fishing. Trolled with Walleye Bandits and did very well. My fourth year there and am very pleased with it all, cabins, fishing, hosts, area.Details and pictures are on my blog, fisherdee.wordpress.com"
