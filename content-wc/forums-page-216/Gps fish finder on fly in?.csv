4759610,MikeG1,2016-04-21 13:12:00,434,Go to Radio Shack and purchase a plastic battery holder that accommodates 8 D cells. Also purchase 2 connectors that mate to the connectors on your finder and which are also designed for the gauge wire coming from your plastic holder. http://i01.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/352/0...005352_347.JPG Put the new connectors on the wires coming from your plastic holder. Typically one is red (+) and the other black (-). There you have it. I've used this system for years. it costs less than 10.00. D cell = 1.5 V. 1.5V X 8 D cells = 12V. Buy good quality D cells with the idea you MAY have to swap every other day. With my Lowrance unit I start with a fresh set and swap out once / trip. but I have extra cells just in case. If you cant find the holder just search for battery holder 8 D cell....it will show you many. PM me if something here does not make sense. Good luck. Mike

4772410,adempsey,2016-04-25 15:04:00,963,I am guessing 4 sets of 8 D-Cell alkalines for seven days of fishing if you fish 10 hours a day. You might get away with 3 sets of 8 if you're a bit more conservative and turn the unit off when it's not needed.

4758602,Bigredmf,2016-04-21 09:24:00,129,I posted the below in the electronics forum and am curious if anyone has found a suitable battery solution for 3 days in the bush with no electricity?I have a Lowrance LCMs-527I I have taken on Canadian trips previously.This year I am flying into A camp in QC.It is a battery hog drawing .5 - .9 amps.No power to recharge in camp and am curious if anyone has come up with a battery set up that might last 3 days?I am considering using two Duracell Pro Cell 7.5 volt batteries. They are pricey not rechargeable and I hate to drop $75 just to test their longevity.In the past I tried to switch the GPS portion off but it appears to be internally bused with power so I was never able to switch off the GPS portion.The outfitter has new 20 hp Mercs and perhaps there is a way to power through the alternator if there is one.I realize the GPS is a luxury but I am aiming for the best possible experience for my son who has never been fishing in QC before.Kind of wondering if anyone has rigged up a solid state jump box or some other new fangled solid state battery to accomplish this?Any help is greatly appreciated.Thank you!Redhttps://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=541234

4758818,Algoma Guy,2016-04-21 10:07:00,48,Buy a small solar panel and hook it up to your battery. It might be enough juice to power your battery for three days. A few guys I know do this. Maybe someone with experience with this might be able to tell you more about it.
4758946,retire55,2016-04-21 10:30:00,1029,"Obviously, your power requirement will be based on your sonar unit usage (hours per day). There's a big difference between 3 five hour days and 3 ten hour days. You could opt to power your unit with 8 D cell batteries. D cell batteries would be a better solution from both a cost and weight perspective. For 3 five hour days, one set of 8 D cell batteries (18000 mAh) would probably do the job. For 3 ten hours days, you would require an additional set of 8 D cell batteries."
4758994,Bigredmf,2016-04-21 10:43:00,129,Yes the D battery idea is one I plan on testing but I was thinking of using 10 or 12 to get 15v to start as I believe the running voltage of a D battery is 1.22 volts Thanks for the responses please keep me coming!RedSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
4759130,SinOrSwim,2016-04-21 11:10:00,1528,"I used to take my humminbird 595c on a fly in. I used the camp batteries with an inverter to recharge my batteries. The GPS portion of the unit takes a lot of juice. However, I also had a flexible solar panel I hooked to the unit while I was fishing. That allowed me to fish all day with one battery while hte ohter was back at camp charging. Otherwise one gel cell 12v battery would not run the unit all day long. I created a pig tail for the battery so one connection connected to the fishfinder and one to the solar panel. I used the 12volt batter that was hooked to the water pump at the dock. I figured if that solar panel charged the water pump battery during the day as my inverter took the juice out, we would not run out of water or lights in the cabin. So, if there is ANY source of power at the cabin for lights or water pumps, just use that battery and take a small inverter with alligator clips to plug into."
4759138,SinOrSwim,2016-04-21 11:12:00,1528,"also, a small solar panel will more than like NOT recharge even an extra battery during the day. They trickle and just won't put out that kind of juice."
4759146,adempsey,2016-04-21 11:14:00,963,"I believe the D-cell alkalines are 1.54V and the NiMH rechargables are 1.25V. However, the operating voltage of your finder goes up to 15V anyway. So I think a set of 10 D-Cells should last longer than 8, as it would take longer to drop below 10V? Not sure though.Not sure what the best option is. A decent solar panel for recharging won't be cheap. Ideally, you would bring two AGM batteries anyway - one for use while the other is being charged by the solar panel. Although, it is possible to have the panel connected to the battery as the battery is running the sonar.Just keep in mind that being over weight isn't necessarily a big deal. Especially if the air service isn't being chartered. You may pay an extra $1.00 per lb. So, you have to decide if it's worth the extra $60 or whatever to bring in a big battery or generator or whatever. Just make sure to pre-arrange things."
4759234,Golden Eagle,2016-04-21 11:34:00,2642,"On my fly in this May I'll power my sonar/gps with the 12V battery in my boat that starts the 15HP Yamaha. If your motor is not electric start, it might have an alternator which would be easy to hook up to your sonar/gps. Honda OB had this feature many years ago. Pretty sure Tohatsu, which manufactured the 20HP merc, will be keeping up with Honda. A call to your outfitter will let you know if their OB motors are electric start and have a 12V battery."
