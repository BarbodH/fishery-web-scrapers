5068361,eyemike,2016-08-18 16:31:00,233,"Just returned home from a fantastic trip to Brace Lake! My wife and I flew in on the 7th of August. Fishing for pike was tough for the week, I did land one big mama that stretched the tape over 43 inches! I was jigging for walleyes with a med. light St. Croix rod and 1/8th oz. Road Runner jig. 8 lb. Suffix 832 line. It was a rodeo! Most days were 50+ fish days, mostly walleye. There were some dandy pike caught from other groups that were strictly targeting pike. What a fishery this is. Kyle and Teri are two of the friendliest resort owners that I have ever met! They will bend over backwards to make your trip a great one. Kyle is full of stories that he is more than willing to share. They are such a hard working couple! The weather was pretty good, a bit windy on several days with a very large storm on one day. We fished both Brace and Meta and really did well with walleyes on both lakes."

5068905,Juls,2016-08-19 01:44:00,13414,Congrats on your big pike with light tackle! That would be a hoot... We were at Meta Lake Lodge the same week you were at Brace Lake. That storm was a good'n for sure. Lots of lightning bolts in that one.
5068969,pjshorthorn,2016-08-19 05:30:00,5654,"Nice pike !!! Any pictures you can share ? I had a very similar scenario on Red Lake a few years ago catching a 44"" northern. Same action rod,same pound test line, same type lure jigging for walleye after dinner. My experience was more like a frigg'in circus......The fish took a huge run, I'm strongly suggesting to my son that he pull up the anchor that was 30 feet deep;while I watch the majority of my line leaving the reel QUICKLY all the while I'm trying to pull start the motor on the camp boat. Thankfully, I was able to chase the bugger down and land it for a couple of pics before letting her swim away. After the chaos subsided, the son revived me by pouring water on my head PjShorthorn."
5069769,515,2016-08-19 12:13:00,254,Thanks for the report and 50 fish days are pretty good days on the water. Congrats
5070025,Guest,2016-08-19 14:58:00,0,Were you jigging mostly around the deep cabbage weeds? We had heard thats what you do for walleye then.
5070737,eyemike,2016-08-19 20:35:00,233,"Mike, I think My wife and I made an excellent choice in choosing Brace Lake. Reading your trip report on Brace Lake was the clincher.Juls, that was a whopper of a storm! We got back to the cabin just in time! A tree fell on one of the boats and crushed it! One plus is no one got hurt. It was a riot catching such a specimen in such light gear! We got over to Meta but didn't venture past the south end, we found a sweet spot and fished it over about 4 days.Nice story pjshorthorn! I didn't take a lot of fish pictures, none that will top the pike picture! Smokey, I'll take 50 fish days anytime. It was quite enjoyable. Waldorf, most of our walleyes came from drifting into bays the wind was blowing into and snap jigging Road Runners with a twister and a half of a worm. Most of the time we were in 6 to 9 feet of water. If the wind was blowing into it, through it, or on it, we caught walleyes. we did not do well deep or with anything but Road Runners."
5071177,rzep,2016-08-20 06:50:00,1196,MikeCan you describe accomodations ? This is a fly out resort ??? I am looking at places for next year and it is not clear from their website site how is the lodging ..Since they are in CDN.. do they take CC or you need cash ?
5071209,rzep,2016-08-20 06:57:00,1196,Never mind the description .. I found Mike Borger report .... thanks ...
5071233,Mike Borger,2016-08-20 07:02:00,1554,"As I always do I filmed a short video tour of the facilities at Brace when I was there last year. Somewhat crude but it clearly shows what the camp is like. Yes, it's a fly in resort out of Nakina.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9XTm5i0lBU"
