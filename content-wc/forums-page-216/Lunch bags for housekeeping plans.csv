Like the bait shops use to bag minnows with oxygen. They put the fruit, sandwich, bag of chips and cookie in the bag, blow some air in it and tie it in a knot. This keeps things from getting wet in the coolers and the air keeps the chips and things from getting smooshed. Anyone know were I can buy some of these vs using a ziplock type bag? We have a larger group and even if we buy a box of 100 or 250 we can use them for years. We used to all meet up for lunch but are thinking this year, send each both with their own stuff and if they want to meet, fine. If not, that is fine too. Thanks"

I have stayed at a lot of resorts over the years, always doing our own house keeping. I have never heard of a resort that gives a bag lunch. That is done usually at an inclusive plan. You may want to rephrase the question, to get a response."
5073793,adempsey2.0,2016-08-21 20:23:00,612,I think they are goody/favor/treat bags. I've used them for things like candy apples. Try a place that sells wedding stuff.http://www.partycity.ca/product/clea...y+bags+25ct.dohttps://www.walmart.com/ip/Clear-Cel...-30pk/35760942

5074298,btyreprich,2016-08-22 06:06:00,1067,Wholesale bait.com out of Ohio seems to have the bags you are looking for.

5074322,SinOrSwim,2016-08-22 06:16:00,1528,Those are exactly them. Thank you very much. I had looked on Amazon and found similar but not the same as these. Thanks
