We caught several walleyes for the week over 20"" with the biggest at 27"" we caught more peach over 10"" while we was walleye fishing with one over 13"" I had a over 50"" musky on for 30+minutes on a hot n tot and 8lb florocarbon line. Had him by the boat 6 times so we got a good measurement on him but didnt have a net big enough for him finally the snap ring broke on the crank bait. Small mouth fishing was a little slow but caught a few. All and all a great fun week."
