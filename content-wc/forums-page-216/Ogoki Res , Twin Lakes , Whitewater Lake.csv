5057874,Ogoki,2016-08-13 19:56:00,291,"First week of June went to Ogoki Reservoir for 9 day fly in with Mattice Lake Outfitters . Weather was nothing but wind and rain . Walleye didn't mind it at all. Caught big numbers everyday . Made two runs to Moose Crossing and it was like catching fish in a barrel . Used live minnows or various colored twister tails . Lots of 21 to 24 inch fish . Ate our share everyday . No big pike , but we didnt really spend much time after them either . The couple that were with us , sat two consecutive days in the cabin, as they didnt like fighting the wind . Awesome cabins , awesome fish cleaning houses , 16 ft Lund SSV 16 boats with 15hp Yahama motors . Camp attendant did nice job of keeping gas tanks full and normal camp duties . Ted does a good job . First week of June spent 4 days at Upper and Lower Twin Lakes with a freind . Drive in lake . Walleye size were small compared to fly in trips but ate fish everyday and had a nice time . Lower Twin Lake Lodge is a good drive to location . Nice cabins and docks . Fish cleaning house could have been better but it was ok . Last week back to Mattice Lake Outfitters and flew in to Whitewater Lake . Lots of big water to fish . John does a good job taking care of the camp and directing people to fishing spots for newcomers . Walleye were VERY SCATTERED . Took in leeches and crawlers . Caught walleye from 16 to 24 inches . Ate all the walleye we cared to eat . Lost two monster pike and landed two good ones . One at 39 inches and one at 42 inches . Both released of course . Visited the remains of the Beckwith Cabins . Shame to see such cabins go to ruins . Good trip but not the numbers of walleye that we usually catch in June Next trip, 2 weeks of bear hunting and guiding bear hunters . Sleep in my canvas tent , catch walleye at the Jackfish River , pick blueberries for my pancakes , run bear baits everyday and help other hunters hang stands and skin bears . I am having so much fun now, I cant wait until I retire so I can really have some fun . Sept thru Dec I have to work my butt off to pay for next years fun . Might just have to bowhunt deer in between work a little ..............or hunt a lot"

5063705,Mike Borger,2016-08-16 14:30:00,1554,Sounds as though you're keeping busy Keith!
5064337,Ogoki,2016-08-16 18:27:00,291,"Bill, The roof on the largest cabin has caved in. Fireplace is ready to fall over too. I wonder if Wendell ever came up with much,with his research? Some of his items such as notebooks are in a museum in Thunder Bay , from what I have read. I read an account of him that was written by Lakehead University. Was interesting. As far as you fishing Ogoki Res. maybe Mike will take us there sometime . LOLI have only fished Wabakimi Lake from a canoe , but we did real well. Wakakimi, Whitewater, Whiteclay , Ogoki Res. and Mojikit are by far the best I have fish . The Ogoki River is awesome ."
5064553,Mike Borger,2016-08-16 19:34:00,1554,That will never happen and you know it LOL! I'm sure it's a fish factory but the forest of trees lurking below the surface is not for me.
