4959345,billy weaver,2016-06-30 15:54:00,470,"Got back from Peffley's camp on June 25. It was different from years past (my 30th trip). The weather was changing every day, windy and rain one day calm and clear the next. We always go the 5th week of the season and it has been good over the years. They had a early spring and the fishing was more like you would find in July. To show how extreme the changes were my boat caught 109 walleye one day and none the next. The bad day was dead calm and clear skies. The windy days were rough with white caps and big rollers. (My 17ft. by 84"" was not big enough.) Did good in the bay west of Doe island. Used jigs with minnows and nightcrawlers with both doing well at times. Used nightcrawler rigs but not as effective as last year. The older groups in camp all suffered on the bad day. Good luck."

No 50-75 fish days. 10-15 fish days instead. I blame it on the worst mayfly hatch I've ever seen up there and the fish being deeper than we are accustomed to finding them. I can't control the first one but I can the second. We didn't adapt to the deeper fish very well and frankly have limited experience doing so. The eater weedbed fish were simply not there and that's our go to strategy. We did catch some 22""+ fish right before dark trolling stickbaits over deep water. Smallmouth fishing was fantastic with our group of 8 boating 16 fish 17"" or bigger. Lots of weather moved thru and we had two nights in the high 40's. We can usually overcome that but combined with mayflies and fish in deeper water we worked for our fish last week. This is our 7th year fishing the lake and we always fish the last week of June."

5002977,sheepman,2016-07-19 20:40:00,98,any reports since Bill... going in a month and just wondering?
5026153,WallerChief,2016-07-28 14:17:00,83,Where do you catch your Smallies? We've never been able to really get into them in 7 trips. Just the occasional nice one here and there. Going later in the year this year may help.
5041538,UKBDM,2016-08-05 13:18:00,178,Rocky shorelines in the evening using topwater baits like Baby Torpedoes. Find a big boulder out from shoreline in 6-10' of water and you'll hit the mother lode. We also catch a few big ones drifting a nightcrawler on a bare hook anywhere there is current and clear water.
5075322,sheepman,2016-08-22 12:02:00,98,"Just returned from Wabaskang Saturday night after 6 days at Sleepy Dog Cabins. Fishing was good but you really had to work for them. Water temperature was in the mid to low 70's. Most fish were caught on crawler harnesses, some on whistler jigs. Preferred color was orange followed by chartreuse. Silver rattletraps took the smallmouths. Booked next years trip for last week of August."
