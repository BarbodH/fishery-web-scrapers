5060881,pjshorthorn,2016-08-15 11:00:00,5654,"I agree. I didn't mean to infer that your link would provide better fishing spots. My point is that if anyone has spent time on this lake system, there may be a lot more possible fishing spots to investigate based on the MNR's information. PjShorthorn"
5060937,Pooch,2016-08-15 11:40:00,4619,"I'll be back on LS in a few days in the Mahkwa area so I'm really going to try to detect current. Some of the other boats we fish with say the same as you and I've always fofo'd them.Admittedly, the few times I've actually felt there was current was when the wind had created the current. One example would be at Archies Landing under the bridge to Kesick Bay Island. There can be a current there depending on which way the wind is or has been blowing.Before the causeway was built several years ago there was a channel in the middle between Archies Landing and Kesick that was a good night spot for some reason. I always thought there might be a deep current going around the island. But, saw little indication from a jig dropped over the side of the boat. Now that I printed the map of currents or flow in that area, I'm going to spend some time trying to see if I can find detectable current. It looks to me like the flow probably follows contours of the lake bottom from before the dam was built. It would be like wind following the valleys we see all the time. Makes perfect sense to me. Wind blowing also creates currents around islands, but I doubt it is actually a flow of water through the system that creates it. We'll see.I have no doubt that current is very detectable in parts of the lake. Especially near necked down areas. Is there detectable current south of Manitoba Point? Or, off Windigo Point? South of Pine Point there is current as most all of the water flows through there.I'm still a skeptic as far as being in open water on the lake if I can detect current other than wind made current or the above mentioned ""valleys"" under water. Maybe two weeks from now I will come crawling back to this discussion and eating these words. If so, I certainly will!!Pooch"

5060985,Jabs,2016-08-15 11:54:00,24,I always get messed up when going from Deception to bear narrows when the navigation buoys change just north of Taylor island. Especially the red buoy at the island just south of bear narrows
5061001,pjshorthorn,2016-08-15 12:06:00,5654,"Wind blowing also creates currents around islands, but I doubt it is actually a flow of water through the system that creates it. We'll see. To your point, wind will create currents around points and islands as well. I target those current lines as well, where you can see a defined froth on the water, or a pollen line ,or a defined line where there is calm water merging with a chop on the surface. Most of my experience has been that those current lines are created by flats dropping off into deeper channels or off the edges of a large mid lake hump. Have a great trip on LS. PjShorthorn."
5062865,rnnonmt,2016-08-16 08:14:00,992,"Very interesting and deceiving water flow map at least for one of the places I have fished in the last 25 or so trips to Lac Seul. If you look at the south end of the Z in the narrows section it shows water flowing to the south yet every time I have fished that area vertical jigging my jig/line flow to the north. Very strange. Also, as PJShorthorn mentioned, I have always heard and read that the water flow changes directions at Taylor Island as well yet it shows that the directional change is more evident further north around Bear Narrows. How many of you guys went looking directly for your honey hole spot on this map and scratched your head a bit wondering why that spot is so good OR said no wonder why that spot is so good. I had both reactions to a few of my favorite spots. Anyway - thanks for sharing the map. Very cool indeed!"
5063057,pjshorthorn,2016-08-16 09:27:00,5654,"Heading north, you always want to stay left of that red buoy. The reef guarding the entrance to Bear Narrows comes out quite a ways from shore. PjShorthorn."

5064281,btyreprich,2016-08-16 18:07:00,1067,We fished LS last week out of Evergreen Lodge. You really notice the flow when going under the railroad bridge. Granted this is a neck down area and not too far from the dam itself.

5055865,mms3rd,2016-08-12 10:23:00,148,"Does Lac Seul flow from east to (north)west? Does the **** at Ear Falls hold back the water in the lake--control water level? I always like to know if I'm going down stream or up stream! Where Lac Seul connects with the English River on the far east end, is the river flowing into Lac Seul? Pelican Lake flows INTO Lac Seul? Is Lac Seul technically a reservoir? Like our big Army Corps of Engineer projects in the US? In Minnesota we have the Laurentian Divide where the water either flows to Hudson Bay, to Lake Superior or to the Mississippi. I did look this up on Wikipedia and got no help."
5055913,jsmyers,2016-08-12 10:50:00,198,"Lac Seul is a reservoir. I don't know exactly what the head on the dam is, but I believe it is a relatively low dam that slightly raised the level of an original lake, so it isn't like most USACE projects.It does flow out at Ear Falls into the English River. The English River merges with the Winnipeg River (after it leaves Lake of the Woods) which flows through Lake Winnipeg into Hudson Bay via the Nelson River. Lake of the Woods is fed by the Rainy River and other smaller watersheds.This map shows the direction of water flow: The Atlas of Canada - ToporamaThis map doesn't have water flow, but loads much faster: https://mappingsupport.com/p/gmap4.p...1097&z=13&t=t5"
5056073,Pooch,2016-08-12 12:17:00,4619,"The dam that makes LS is at Ear Falls and you drive over it on the main highway. Not a large dam, but appears deep. Interesting.I've never detected much if any current while fishing LS. Maybe there is in some of the necked down areas, but out on the lake? Not so much.There are a lot of smaller streams flowing into LS, but I think the largest source is the English river. I don't know where the main channel used to be prior to the building of the dam at Ear Falls. I'm sure there are folks here on WC that could answer that question. I've had guys tell me that the travel routes marked on some maps are the old channel, but I don't know that to always be the case. Where those travel routes take you does not always make sense to me.Interesting link in the above post showing flow patterns on the lake. I wonder who figured that out or is it just extrapolated data?I'm hoping others chime in as this is interesting.Pooch"
5056097,Stringbean,2016-08-12 12:26:00,279,"If you look at the link here, http://lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html, you will see that the entire outflow of Lake St. Joseph is diverted south to the Rat River in order to maintain the pool level of the Lac Seul reservoir. The water level of Lac Seul is measured in 3 places. Hudson on the east end, Lac Seul Post in the center on the north side and finally at Goldpines about 4 miles upstream from the dam at Ear Falls. When the dam was built in 1928, the water level rose about 18 feet. If you look at the graph, you see that the water on the east end is higher than the west end because it is virtually impossible to raise the water level on a lake that is 150 miles long all at the same time. The water will always be higher where the streams enter the lake. It takes time for the water to disperse. As you motor out on the lake, the red buoys will be on your right as you travel upstream. I wish you well, there are very few years where I didn't have to replaced a prop when fishing Lac Seul."
5059993,Crackback,2016-08-15 06:25:00,257,"The dam at Ear Falls, Ontario is a working hydroelectric power source and it is holding back way more that 18 feet of Lac Seul's water. It has to be at least a 30 to 40 foot drop as you look down while driving over the daam's rode going to Ear Falls. I was there in July 2016. It has fulltime crew of at least 10-15 guys maybe more by the number of all the pick-up truck parked around the site and at their administrative headquarters down the street. I saw 4- 5 guys alone working on the cranes."
5060281,pjshorthorn,2016-08-15 07:59:00,5654,Great map on the water flow on Lac Seul. Thanks for posting I'll be saving it for future reference. PjShorthorn.
5060417,pjshorthorn,2016-08-15 08:36:00,5654,"The overall water flow of Lac Seul has a significant influence from the NE and SE sections of the watershed. From the NE, the Root River, Wapesi River and Vermilion River flow from the NE and E to the south where all three confluences come together just south of Chamberlain Narrows and continue on through Kekabeka Narrows. I have fished this area quite bit anana lot of fishing success has been primarily in the areas where there is significant current........most fish come off of steep breaks where current and slack water meets. From the SE area, the English River travels north to meet up with the rivers coming down from the NE as mentioned above. Every map I have looked at says the current line changes on the south side of Taylor Island. With the posted information, it now looks like the current change may actually be further north by Bear Narrows and then start a WSW journey towards Ear Falls where it eventually exits through the dam. On the SE section,if anyone has fished or boated through Crooked Rapids and Manitou Rapids, you will see and feel the power of the current. Taking a HB though these areas can be pretty interesting to say the least. Pooch, as far as the original channels and navigational routes, my experience is only with the SE and NE sections. I would have to say that most of the nav routes used today would be very close to original channels and current flow on the watershed. I think at one point in the past,you mentioned that you may have the same wall map that I do of Lac Seul made by Navionics. Without having studied the current flow link closely yet, it appears that the main nav routes on that map follow the current flow in the link for the most part. This leads me to believe the nav routes are closely related to original channels. Having said that, channels shift constantly during high water years where current rates can be quite a bit stronger. I agree that this is a really interesting link to pour over this fall and winter. I think there are thousands of new fishing spots to try based on the current flow. PjShorthorn."
5060457,jsmyers,2016-08-15 08:42:00,198,"To be clear, I don't believe that the GIS data says anything about the current flow within a large lake, but rather is a network model of inflows and outflows. Once the water reaches an open expanse, its flow is dictated by too many factors to be predictable."
