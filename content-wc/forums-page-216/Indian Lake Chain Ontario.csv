1209251,JEREDOG,2010-06-11 09:41:00,21,"Gulrock is a great lake but you will pay a lot more not any better quality of fish. if you cant catch a nice fish on the Indian Lake Chain, you just need to try to find the fish. they will usually be on humps in the summer and rocky points or in the weeds and sticks. Moose bay and up in fith and pine bay are the best spots. you will catch a lot of small fish at first, but if you stick to it you will hook into some big ones."
1209352,Bigfish10702,2010-06-11 15:40:00,60,I will have to hit you up before I go to Clarks in the Fall!
1209824,JEREDOG,2010-06-13 19:41:00,21,"you need to talk to Derek and Cassy Becker. They got a fantastic thing goin over at Indian Lake lodge. they are a bit less modern, but a lot cheaper on Boat rental, cabin fees, Boat slip rental, and everything else. there cabins are always kept clean and dry. they dont charge for ice. Derek has minows for sale. your boat is warmed up for you everyday(if you are renting one) and your boat filled up every night. if you want to pay a little extra, you will get the American Plan. Cassy will cook three meals a day for you. Wheather you get that or not, she makes a treat for every cabin during your stay. check out their website or just call Derek. also when you come in off the lake, derek ill clean your fish if you want. it is a shorter trip into town. otherwise, derek has just about everything that you would want."

5063321,Guest,2016-08-16 11:16:00,0,"there are NO walleyes in the chain, except the 29, two 30's and a 32 incher I caught in the last year and a half.... muskies?? only two, a 52incher and a 48 incher, that I caught in the last year and a half, other than that, there are NO FISH in the chain, and would suggest you fish some where else......... By the way Corner and Langston are the same LAKE, DUH ...."
5063641,farmnfish,2016-08-16 13:52:00,130,"Concur, i didn't catch a couple 25s there last week, nor bunches of eaters."
5065121,Guest,2016-08-17 06:23:00,0,"hey farmnfish, thank you for that non-catching fish report, I always enjoy an up to date report on a lake...."
568105,Guest,2007-08-05 21:58:00,0,"Hello, I made my 1st Canadian trip with my son to Gullrock in June. Thanks to a heck of a lot of great info from this website and members, the trip was a big success and we had a blast. Now I am hooked, I have a chance to go up again in early September with a group of guys. We will be going to the Indian Lake Chain and staying at Clarks Camp. i am starting my research now in the hopes of repeating my Gullrock success. Sooo.... Any info on this lake chain would be much appreciated. We will fish Musky and walleye. 2 Canadian trips in one year! I feel like a pig in a feed trough!!!"
568115,Guest,2007-08-06 10:58:00,0,"been too both lakes and you will be bored out of your mind at clarks after gullrock, except for the musky fishing gullrock is FAR superior lake to fish."
568134,Guest,2007-08-06 20:03:00,0,"Ugh, I was afraid I might hear something like that!"
568143,Guest,2007-08-07 08:11:00,0,"You will still have a great time musky fishing as they are plentiful. You will still catch walleye but not the quantity and maybe even the quality at gullrock. Clarks is a great camp and he is an awesome guy. You will still have fun, I mean you are in canada fishing."
568168,Guest,2007-08-07 20:26:00,0,Stayed at Clark's last year. They are fabulous people. Don't miss their fish fry! Fishing was a BIG disappointment. Most of the people in camp were Muskie fishermen. To put it bluntly it is a muskie lake. We fished hard and caught in one week what we would catch in one day in Sen Bay. But it was Canada and we were there to fish and relax and have a good time.
568169,5thsuit,2007-08-07 21:02:00,54,"Took the family there in August 2002, caught lots of walleye once we located them, nothing big. Kids enjoyed their game room. The people running it were great hosts!"
568182,bpetersen,2007-08-08 11:23:00,251,"Hi Never stayed at Clark's but heard good things about it. I have been to the Indian Lake Chain main times. The other information from people is quit correct. It is a muskie lake but there are walleye to be had. I am not sure about Clark's website but the lodge I stay at is Indian Lake Lodge. It is at the first lake (Alexandrea Lake) commonly called Indian Lake from Vermillion bay. In the latter part of the season Alexandrea Lake has small walleye but good muskie. The bigger walleye are at the far end of the chain in Cobble and Little Boulder lakes. Look for the sunken islands with close deep water (Little Boulder). Watch for stumps in the two narrow areas on your way down the chain. There looks like a good boat path but stumps are just under the surface. Try this link. Hope it comes through hot. It has all of the chain of lakes with depths. They print well. Maybe Clark's has something like this. I know the two lodge owner are pretty good friends. http://www.indianlakelodge.com/lakes.htm Here are a couple of gps waypoints of sunken islands if interested. N 49 degrees 52.013 min. W 093 degrees 40.269 min. and also N 49 degrees 52.079 min. W 093 degrees 40.380 min. Any other questions my e-mail is: [email protected] Good luck, Pete"

568719,bpetersen,2007-08-30 22:31:00,251,One more possibility. There are a couple of smaller lakes north of Vermillion Bay on you way to Indian Lake. You can't see the lakes from the road but there is a boat access. The one lake is called Corner and the second in called Langton. Corner is more of a Northern lake and Langton is good for wallery. Be careful going into Langton. Many reefs. Langton actually empties into Indian Lake. I believe Clark's is on Edwards Lake. If you want to try this bay. You will need to go south and a little east into Indian lake. That reminds me of the bay that Langton empties into Indian Lake. If print of maps from the website I sent you ( Indian Lake Lodge ) You will see the bay. It has some very good points in it for walley. If you want to try for some muskie. The small island on your way to the above bay is very good for muskie. On the east side of the island is a good spot to try for walleye. Good drop offs and boulders. This is the link I sent earlier. If it doesn't work. Go to the Indian Lake lodge website and they have pretty good maps to print out. I printed a set with depths and laminated them incase of rain.http://www.indianlakelodge.com/lakes.htm I wish I was going with you. Enjoy the area. One more suggestion. Fish slow. Rigs and jigs.
