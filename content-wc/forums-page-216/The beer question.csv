5060241,farmnfish,2016-08-15 07:57:00,130,"Tried the blueberry ale it was much better than I anticipated, really good. Couldn't find the ipa, tried the sultana gold, ok, but not outstanding. The beer store in dryden acted like i was from mars when i asked for something outside the mainstream. Beers their system said they had in stock they said they'd never heard of. Hate the experience of not being able to just pick it off the shelf. The lcbo in vermillion bay was actually better for finding a beer off the beaten path."
5061017,mms3rd,2016-08-15 12:13:00,148,"Blueberry is for pancakes. What's next, catsup/ketchup on walleyes? Water, yeast, Malt and hops = beer (maybe a little sugar) And eliminate the designated hitter."
5061145,farmnfish,2016-08-15 13:43:00,130,"I agree, which is why i was surprised, it had no taste of blueberry i could discern. As far as i could tell blueberry was just the name."
5061193,v-bay gord,2016-08-15 14:15:00,3168,Expand your horizons........pancakes are for rabbits.
5063473,Shortline,2016-08-16 12:25:00,234,"C'mon Gord........ that rabbit has a waffle on his head, not a pancake. Lego his eggo."
5063489,Jesse-WI,2016-08-16 12:32:00,534,How about this one?
5064945,pjshorthorn,2016-08-16 23:56:00,5654,"Nope, that is truly a pancake......a Canadian pancake....eh? They are made with indentations like a waffle so the gravy stays in place when eating the pancakes. Gravy is a main food group in Canada. I think the most popular pancake receipe in Canada is Pancake Poutine. Of course, the meal is accompanied by a fine local brew called Crystal. PjShorthorn."
5067025,youngknight,2016-08-17 21:32:00,228,I tried bush beer once. It was similar to making love in a canoe . (Effin close to water!). Bringing American beer into Canada seems like someone from Britain bringing their own vodka into Poland or Russia
5067370,v-bay gord,2016-08-18 06:52:00,3168,"Actually the cheese fits in the indentations before adding the gravy. Often referred to as ""panteen""......"
5067618,pjshorthorn,2016-08-18 08:33:00,5654,Yum !! With a little bit of that round Canadian ham.........now that is a meal. PjShorthorn
5030969,Freytown,2016-07-31 17:16:00,770,Cold....ice cold. Just sayin' FT
5031281,Lmbkiller,2016-07-31 19:55:00,639,Lcbo's have very little for variety of beers. Beer stores are where u go to find beer variety. I don't go to lcbo's anymore unless it's for liquor or an emergency
5031409,halfmoon007,2016-07-31 21:14:00,121,My fishing partner and son buy all their beer and smokes at the duty free and 50% of the time when their 2 cases and a carton of smokes over. The Canadian border guard hands the pass ports back and say your good to go. And year after year I shake my head and say I cant believe they did that again. ( crossing at the Soo ) LOL ........Halfmoon
5036713,tjandy,2016-08-03 11:13:00,107,"amen, much cheaper"
5036850,adempsey2.0,2016-08-03 12:32:00,612,Really? Not around here in London. Even the grocery stores that are allowed to carry beer have a surprisingly good variety.
5037530,Lmbkiller,2016-08-03 18:07:00,639,Lcbo's in northwest Ontario suck for beer
5037538,Lmbkiller,2016-08-03 18:10:00,639,"Not much cheaper anymore. $33 Canadian cs of labatts. Throw in exchange rate, and the fact u will pay $13ish per cs in US plus another $12 duty on top of said cs....I'm drinking Canadian beer again"
5037778,Monks75,2016-08-03 20:01:00,11,"Download the ""Beer Store"" app. You can see the various beer store locations and see what they carry in Ontario. Lots of good options to try. The LCBO stores in that neck of the woods do have a limited supply of beer variety as the Beer Store carries most that. As said above Lake of the Woods Brewery has some great pints, and Sleeping Giant Brewery is another local brewery you may find to your liking. Cheers Sent from my iPod touch using Tapatalk"
5038066,ogilville,2016-08-04 05:23:00,262,Just add ice and we are ready to go. We don't need any stinkin' fu fu beer.
5038466,farmnfish,2016-08-04 08:39:00,130,"Sure, that stuff is a fine substitute for water."
5029809,farmnfish,2016-07-30 21:15:00,130,"I can only take a case in, so I've got a 15 of christian morlein ipa and a 6 of a chocolate porter. About what i can get acrossed the border. What can I get at the beer store in dryden is worth drinking? any microbrews or tap rooms in nw ontario to be had?"
5029817,v-bay gord,2016-07-30 21:21:00,3168,Try some of the Lake of the Woods Brewing Company blueberry beer. There's a lot of Ontario micro brewery beer available at the beer store in Dryden.
5029825,Golden Eagle,2016-07-30 21:21:00,2642,Take 2 and pay duty on second.
5029849,farmnfish,2016-07-30 21:32:00,130,"Thanks gord.If someone showed up at your door with a free 6 from the beer store in dryden, what w ould you wish it to be?"
5029881,forgop,2016-07-30 21:56:00,880,"I declared 2 cases. I paid the duty which was about $9 on a $20 declaration. It's discretionary whether they even charge you for it. Coming back from Windsor with my dad a few years ago, i declared a keg. The agent seemed to think it was crazy a man would drive his dad to canada to buy a keg of beer because it isn't available in the US. When your dad has cancer and he wants a keg for a 5 hour road trip each way, it's what you do. He waived us on through. Sadly, my dad never got to drink it because it had metastisized and anything going in was leaking into his abdomen. His dr told him no beer. Sent from my SM-G935V using Tapatalk"
5030041,v-bay gord,2016-07-31 06:23:00,3168,I rather like the 10 Point IPA from Lake of Bays Brewery. http://lakeofbaysbrewing.ca/our-beer/
5030289,Lmbkiller,2016-07-31 09:05:00,639,Ft Francis has beer store also. X2 on the discretionary part. We didn't have to pay duty this yr
5030585,adempsey2.0,2016-07-31 11:59:00,612,"Most micro-brews can be purchased in singles, so just buy a bunch you've never tried. Where's your sense of adventure?You can go to www.lcbo.com and take a look at what they have. Just make sure you check the specific location you are heading to."
5030785,farmnfish,2016-07-31 15:36:00,130,"Thanks for the recommendations, I'll give them a try."
5030881,Bowtech84,2016-07-31 16:33:00,572,Only the good stuff!http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l1...pshetfstas.jpgSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
