Let me just start by saying this was our first fly-in and was a little nervous about the whole thing, especially on what outfitter to chose. We based our decision on information people shared through this sight as well as what I could find on the net and couldn't have chosen a better one. Chad, the owner of TLO, was absolutely great! His customer service was top notch! Our trip up from Akron Ohio (over 900 miles) was absolutely beautiful and flawless, until we hit one of the dirt logging roads by the choice of my stupid GPS and got a flat tire. If you go to TLO ask Chad for the alternate route, a little longer, but trust me, a much smother route that we used on the way back. Just speaking to the customer service side of TLO and my flat tire fiasco, there really aren't to many tire stores up there, but in telling Chad about my situation, he quickly said to just leave the rim and tire with him and when I got back from the lake he would have the tire fixed up for me. Well, he didn't disappoint, he had another tire mounted up and ready to go and waiting when I got back, impressive! In regards to the cabin at Ankcorn, it was top notch also and surpassed what I had envisioned. The float plane flight in and out by Nakina air was one of the coolest things I can remember doing in a long time. Being prior Air Force and flying contour of the earth missions on C-130's, this brought back old memories. Ankcorn lake is relatively small, about 3 miles, but still didn't disappoint for the fishing. I would say though that the Walleye fishing was hit and miss, but the pike fishing was non-stop. The one day after a storm blew through, we got into a school of walleye and were pulling doubles non-stop on .125 ounce white jigs with white mister twisters. The pike hit anything and everything, mostly on the 18""-24"" size, but we did get a couple in the mid 30"" range. We were definitely happy with our choice in using TLO and wouldn't hesitate in using them again, but maybe a little bigger lake. Probably stating the obvious here, but I feel I have to, Canada is one of the most beautiful places on earth! I have done my share of traveling through the US, Europe and South America, but I cant stop replaying the images of our drive up along lake Superior and else ware. Cant wait to go back!"

That's what I got from watching Chad with his customers in Nakina when I was there earlier this year. I have no doubt he runs a first class operation. I think picking a smaller lake for your first fly-in was a good idea, especially for a small group. TLO has a lot of great options though.Any photos?"
