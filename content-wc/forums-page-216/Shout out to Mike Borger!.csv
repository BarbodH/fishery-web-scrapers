We're looking at doing a fly in trip with me, my daughter, father, friend & uncle. When you went with your wife & kids in 2014, did they offer you a kids discount at all? And on your return trip, was it similar or same to your arrival trip where on your return you take a float plane back to Weagamow Lake then the second flight back to Thunder Bay? Just looking to get a little info on costs, durations & timing. Thanks! Eric"

It's a real nice trip for me especially as there's no driving. I fly to Thunder Bay and it's all taken care of from there. Dusty will give you a discount for kids if you either have a large group booking the main facility or alternatively if the main camp is full he'd likely cut you a break for the kids if you stayed in the small cabin. They're great people to deal with, it's probably worth a phone call just to chat. If there's any more info you need don't hesitate to ask!

That story will be published before I leave for Quebec on the 25.As far as Tazin goes there will be no report. It didn't work out quite that well."
5062385,DaBirdman,2016-08-16 03:25:00,164,"Excellent! And maybe I'm not quite understanding correctly how reservations work at NCC's main camp. If, for example, there's a group of 6, and they have a reservation at the main camp, they have the entire main camp to themselves? Or do they fill the other sleeping cabins with other groups? Such as when your family went...was it just the 4 of you at the main camp or were there others there as well? Thanks for the feedback! Eric"
5062993,Mike Borger,2016-08-16 08:54:00,1554,Typically they would never book two different groups at the main camp. I'm honestly not sure what the minimum number is to book the main camp but I think 6 would do it. 8 for sure.When I went with my family it was only the 4 of us staying at the main camp. The other four people in camp stayed in the private cabin off to the side. That was a pretty unusual scenario not likely to be repeated again.
5063129,jambi,2016-08-16 10:04:00,504,What? No report? That stinks. I may have to cancel next year then.
5063665,DaBirdman,2016-08-16 13:59:00,164,"Main camp, single cabin....either would be great! Again, thanks for taking the time to reply! Very much appreciated. I'll contact them with further questions."
5064449,pike50plus,2016-08-16 18:57:00,584,"I was in camp the whole week Mike would have been there. Great fishing Lakers and Pike. Camp mgr rules were too over bearing, At least I had a great guide and we fished hard from 8-5, had to pay extra to go out after dinner, $100 a night. 4 days I caught 100 + lakers, mostly jigging and some flat line trolling. Only fished pike 25-30% of the time. They would not let you fish without guide. If you did not do shore lunch you only got peanut butter and jelly for packed lunches. $4500 is a little over priced for that setup? The guide helped improvise an alternate quick lunch with homemade soup from the kitchen and smoked trout, cream cheese and onion on fresh baked rolls. Camp is nice but not 4-5 star camp, except for being in a nice sandy beach area on a big island. They did have a chef from U of Saskatoon in camp. Boats only 16 ft with 25's, too small for that lake."
