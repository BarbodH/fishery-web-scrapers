Since we won't buy groceries until the day or two before we leave, I've been trying to back into a weight that I can use as a ballpark for all my other stuff, from rods & reels to clothes, and, of course, adult beverages. If you have a 100# weight limit, how much of that do you usually use on food? Please don't include beer or other beverages in your guesstimate -- I can figure that separately. I've read lots on how to keep the weight down ... but I have a tendency to overdo it for my one trip a year, so just because I know I won't need 7 rods or three pairs of boots doesn't mean I won't put them in the pile of stuff to bring. You know how it is. But if the consensus view is that if you can keep your 'everything else' pile to, say, 50% of your total weight, then at least I'll know where I'm at (and we can leave the Super Size jar of Skippy on the shelf). Thanks in advance for your words of wisdom.- Steve"

5028593,halfmoon007,2016-07-29 23:08:00,121,"Just got back from our 5th year of flying in to a Nikina camp.( 6 men, 7 days) I have it down to 27 LBS per man. Don,t go over board, fill them to the gills with fish and potatoes. WE use a turkey type fryer outside so to be safe i bring 5 Quarts of peanut oil and 2 boxes corn flake crumbs and 2 boxes panko, if you run out of breading you crush up any thing you have in camp (pretzels, cereal etc. it all works) and its just wright. Breakfast its toast, or any cookies they bring.Every guy is responsible for his boat snacks.WE come in and eat our big meal at 3:30pm clean up and nap and cocktail and back out fishing about 6 for 3 hrs or so. their not very hungry when they come in just snacks. I take 7 lbs assorted lunch meat and 7 loaves square wheat sandwich bread.(22 slices per loaf). they all pack Sammies for lunch out in the boat and anything left is made for the 16 hr ride home.You need to think small. IE. Spices are 1 table spoon in a 2x3 zip lock, 4 qt. zip locks wit 2 cups flour each. 4 rolls Scott 1000 toilet paper and 3 Giant rolls paper towel. Make them understand its a fly in and they must conserve. For every lb the cook conserves its more booze and beer they can take in. The last day they all meat hunt to fill their license quota and i give them a 16 oz Ribeye steak and baked potato and empty the fridge of every thing left putting it out on the dinner table and its over for the trip. pack up clean the cabin and were flying out 6:30 the next morning Can email you my grocery list for 6 if interested.....Halfmoon"
5028921,wallydave,2016-07-30 09:25:00,2151,"Start with a menu, in the past we have had a big breakfast eggs bacon or sausage, pancakes. Head out for some serious fishing, come in around 3-4 in the afternoon fry up some fillets, taters and some beans, a couple of beers, a little nap, and hit the water again. It depends on the weather too. After the menu is done, weigh the gear and check it against the weight limit. Sort through all of the above and adjust as needed. Have a great trip and post a report!"
5029097,octanehi5,2016-07-30 11:46:00,1104,"I'm calling Beer food. At 18lbs per case of 24 cans.Most guys weigh in at from 65 to 70lbs of gear and clothes,most outfitters allow from 100 to 110 lbs per person. given that 70 lbs of gear one case of beer is 88lbs leaving 22lbs of food to make weight. No wonder we never make weight. I aways plan to have one pasta night as well as two nights with steak,filled in with fish fries , dogs,burgers, brats, Figure 1 dozen eggs per person as well as 1 lb of bacon,pancakes, french toast,home fries make up most breakfasts,coffee ,milk,water,cooking oil,butter,among all the veggies and condiments,TP paper plates napkins. Being over weight is a usual thing with my groups at .75 to $1.00 per pound to fly in the extras is not a bad price to pay.Duplication of items is a big factor in being over weight.Two regular size cans of beans or corn serves 6 guys just fine. I recently had a guy on my trip who did not follow my list on what to bring so he changed things up and failed to bring 10 lbs of potatoes and 10 lbs of onions,instead we had 2 #10 cans of beans and one #10 can of string beans, We opened up a stand on the island and sold them all week. needless to say this guy will never be on one of my trips again. and should not be in charge of any food list on someone else's trip. You just can't fix Stupid. I have been taking guys in on fly ins for more than 15 yrs.I know how much food a man eats in a day.If you plan on being in camp for 7 days you need everything on that list.I have learned one more thing this yr. I buy all the consumable foods for the trip,to make sure that it does not happen again. To most guys a fly in is a trip of a lifetime, I like to make it so."
5029945,hoppy63,2016-07-31 01:26:00,367,"Pack what you want, within reason. Even if your 200-300 lbs over at 50Â¢ a lb, what's another $150 between 4-6 guys. I'm making a long trip, one time a year.....not gonna run out of beer!! That's my take on it anyway."
5030033,wallydave,2016-07-31 06:11:00,2151,"Instead of sweating the details, take a look at Hidden Bay Lodge, they have a meal package included. Food, water and beer that they fly-in as part of the meal plan does not go against your weight limit. It's like an American plan, only you are on your schedule, the best of both worlds."
5068681,psi1229,2016-08-18 19:42:00,7,"We have a group of 6 in our biannual fly-in group, and some in the group have been making these trips since the mid 80's. They say with age comes wisdom, and over the years we've gotten this down to a science. Most places allow each guy 100 lbs. of gear with food included. We tell everyone to keep their personal gear (clothes/equipment/booze) between 65-70 lbs. which isn't hard to do and is pretty generous. We buy our beer, soda and water through the outfitter instead of bringing in our own. Yeah we pay a couple bucks more, but they fly it in for us and it doesn't count against our aggregate weight. As far as food goes, it all begins with a planned menu. We start off each day with a solid breakfast, usually eggs & ham/bacon/sausage. We figure 18 eggs per guy per week, this way we have a few extra for use in fish breading. For lunch we keep it simple, sandwiches for a light lunch, with soup a couple of those days when it's colder. We use dry mix soups which are easy to pack and weigh next to nothing. For dinner we eat fish every night and don't bother with burgers, steaks, etc. When we have a chance to eat fresh Walleye, we take full advantage!! Dry goods, as others before have mentioned, pack them in ziplock bags. The packaging doesn't add much in regards to weight, but it makes packing a lot easier, and anytime you can limit the number of coolers/totes going in, the better. If you keep your food weight at about 25-30 lbs./person you should be fine as wine!"
5068873,potsie225,2016-08-18 23:38:00,41,"I would like your list, I have 8 or 10 for next year fly in,can have 110 # each. ty Doug[email protected]"
5069785,515,2016-08-19 12:16:00,254,"My thoughts exactly, we go as a group once a year and that little bit of extra money spent if overweight is worth it to make the best trip ever."
