The service and hospitality was beyond belief, so good in fact I forgot I was at a fly-in camp at times. The northerns were just starting to turn on. We had such a great time that my wife and I are going back for a week in August. they had propane cookers and pans placed all over the lake for shore lunch with picnic tables at some sites. We had a large group (20) and we have already booked for next year. They have an excellent website if you want to check out their operation"

3896337,stjoeguy,2015-05-22 12:22:00,979,Have a great trip!
3896561,larry0418,2015-05-22 13:34:00,16,"Been there a few times - love it, but 2 years ago we got grounded for 2 days thus lost 2 days fishing - about drove me nuts being stuck at the base camp 2 extra days - I think we drank all our beer waiting to get out. Last 2 years now we been going to remote drive or boat in lakes. Considering Smoothrock again next year. Looks like you will have good fly in weather today - hope you have good weather next Friday for the fly out. Enjoy."
3896609,fish007,2015-05-22 13:43:00,120,The weather flying out does look good ! Did you ever fish Lake trout on Smooth Rock ?
3896817,Ogoki,2015-05-22 15:02:00,291,"Have a friend who use to go there the third or fourth week of September . He went with Armstrong Outposts when they owned the camp that Pipestone now owns . They usually did exceptionally well there, providing the water had cooled down. They caught some over 20 lbs. That camp is on the southwest part of the lake . There was some reefs they found where the trout would spawn. Smoothrock Camp has a deal where you can go in for $995 after September 1. To be blunt my friend was too cheap to go. He can afford to is the sad part . He calls me every few weeks wanting to set up a trip but just talks. Enjoy your trip !"
3896897,fish007,2015-05-22 15:54:00,120,Thanks for the reply . We are staying at Dave Dills place and it looks nice. The trout should still be shallow feeding on spawning minnows so it should be fun!
3897057,larry0418,2015-05-22 17:22:00,16,"No we never fished much for lakers. Tried where the Wabikini comes in at the falls. That is where they are suppose to be early in the year. Saw a couple big fish come in a couple times, but most guys fish for the walleyes or the big northerns. Down by the Pipestone cabin is another deep area with falls. Great place to fish, but don't go w/o a GPS or it'll be a very long day. In fact, either falls it is best to have a GPS. They are both long runs and you will easily get messed up. Talk to Debbie she will tell you where to look."
3897169,fish007,2015-05-22 18:16:00,120,It took me a while but I found a navionics chip with a contour map of the lake that works in my Lowrance hds 7 that I'm bringing. That is going to help us considerably
3920346,fish007,2015-05-30 20:07:00,120,"Just got home from Smooth Rock last night. We had a trip so good that great doesn't do it justice. The hospitality , fishing , everything is top shelf in every way possible. I've fished all over North America including Alaska and it was the best trip I have ever had. I can see why they have a waiting list for people to get in on cancelations. The weather surely didn't hurt a thing as it was close to perfect."
3920625,Mike Borger,2015-05-30 22:36:00,1554,Sounds amazing! What were some of the highlights?
