3935313,dan cardinal,2015-06-04 10:08:00,64,"Hawkfan, To answer your question... yes, this is a boat-in. Once you reach the landing, each of the boats for your group are at the landing. Each group are assigned specific boats. You load your gear in your boat, and with your partner... you motor to the camp. Also a camp attendant is there at the landing with a boat as well to help with additional gear, and also to go over initial motor operation. We take all the gear we want. Everything/all gear/group members have been easily loadable in the boats. The boats are big 18 footers.... very nice... with 40 and 50 HP Yamahas. If in case you had a massage amount of gear... the trip into the camp is only about 5 to 10 minutes....you could make a second trip for gear if needed without any hassle."
3937593,Aspencreek,2015-06-04 21:07:00,2911,"Yeah, I get it, and I also understand there are no fish in the area either. But I have made it into that part of the lake from Onaway but it is a pretty good trip, that's why I wanted to check it out. BTW, When I try and explain the road in to the rest of our group, do I include that those guys ARE the rif-raf they are trying to keep out, or just let them figure it out on their own."
3937617,bigwillies,2015-06-04 21:21:00,515,aspen. not sure what u r tryin to say?
3937777,pjshorthorn,2015-06-05 04:51:00,5654,"Never traveled the road to Williams Bay,but I did drive the 12 mile loggging road into Black Bear Lodge last year. Did it in a small Pontiac 4 door rental car. Got to camp and the lodge owner said, "" You drove that in here ? You know that is a logging road right?"". Yes I knew and that it could be a litle rough in spots. Most of the way we went 45 mph, but we took our time to enjoy the scenery, stopped and took some pictures and enjoyed the ride.......it was like going to find a pot of gold at the end of the road as we had never been to this camp and really didn't know what to expect.One of the best trips I taken in a very long time. Sometimes an adventure requires a little extra effort. I would make that drive in a hearbeat, but that is just me..........PjShorthorn"
3937849,Blades-n-Beads,2015-06-05 05:29:00,484,"Aspen, PM sent your way."
3938305,prov1800,2015-06-05 08:39:00,5010,I used to haul my boat up to williams bay.if you you allowed yourself some extra timemit was a enjoyable trip.have hunted moose on the williams creek and that also is a enjoyable trip.only thing people need to do in canada is relax and enjoy.fishing is just a bonus.goid thing about the creek is that if the lake us rough (and it gets rougher than the road in) lol.there is fish to be had.but the main lake fishing where you come out from the creek is second to none.i do still fish there but its a long trip from the scout bay landing and would pick a calm day to do that.but no matter where you fish in lac seul it will be amazing fishing.
3939265,Limeyangler,2015-06-05 13:55:00,563,I have to agree with that. CHILL! Plenty of time to go 200mph everywhere and everything you do when you return to the cities and towns. So much more to enjoy than just slam min' walleye after walleye but hey thats kinda of fun too .lol.
3939449,Aspencreek,2015-06-05 15:15:00,2911,"Sorry for the confusion, I was being sarcastic about the fishing (like the other posts) and my group amounts to exactly the kind of rif-raf a camp likes to keep out"
3941993,bigwillies,2015-06-06 20:01:00,515,ha.me too. imho that section of lac suel is the best as far as size wise.best day of fishing in my life was in williams bay.the wife and i caught 3 or 4 each over 30inches. plus lots between 26 and 30. wife was complaining her wrists were sore(among other things lol). have a glass boat now so i go from scout bay.extra gas but o well.
2303265,Guest,2013-12-28 14:22:00,0,"I have stayed at the lodge five times, and used suv, van, and car for transporttion it usually takes between 45 minutes to a hour to get to the landing. The road has some rough areas but you can usually go 45mph until the last 20 miles which are rough, go slow and enjoy the fishing."
3928833,bushead11,2015-06-02 12:14:00,151,jim - wondering if you can PM me or respond to the thread with your fishing report from Williams Lake Lodge and if you have gone back since 2013...? We might be looking for a new camp and this one has come up a few times.
3929177,prov1800,2015-06-02 13:53:00,5010,There are camps on lac suel south ofcearfalls that are much cliser to better fishing also.
3930577,Aspencreek,2015-06-02 20:31:00,2911,"Am I understanding this correctly, you need to travel over 40min to an HOUR on a logging road to get to this camp!! I've heard about it and wanted to check it out because it is on a remote part of the lake, but if I need to take that much time off the paved road and need to go to the dentist to get my fillings reset after the drive that would make me reconsider. Maybe I'll just take the time to find it by water then google earth it."
3930953,Pooch,2015-06-03 05:41:00,4619,"A lot of remote camps are more than ""just off the highway"". Keeps the riff raft out!!Really, it's not that unusual to travel active or old logging roads to reach many camps. It's the active logging roads that scare me.It's an adventure....Pooch"
3932209,Blades-n-Beads,2015-06-03 12:12:00,484,"Aspen, buy yourself a mouth guard or an extra dab of denture glue and your good to go. Lol Like Pooch said it's an adventure, take your time and enjoy it. Blades"
3932305,Limeyangler,2015-06-03 12:48:00,563,"Yeah, I would not bother, the fishing is terrible on that part of the lake too."
3932945,bigwillies,2015-06-03 16:19:00,515,u would probably be surprised on the shape of the logging roads(definitly better than the streets of dryden!). but like limey says there r no fish there anyway.
3933097,prov1800,2015-06-03 17:24:00,5010,Thats what i heard to from some freinds fishing williams bay.REAL SLOW.and the road broke there battery straps.just not worth it.
3935145,Hawkfan,2015-06-04 09:26:00,237,"That's a boat in lodge isn't it? Seems like it would be hard to fit much gear on a boat with a somewhat large group. Are you restricted on how much you bring or does it take a long time? We did fly ins for a number of years, but it seems like it would be harder to get our stuff plus us in a boat (s). Is it a long ride to the lodge? Sorry for all the questions, but this lodge is one I've been interested in the last couple years and the biggest concern from our group is it was a boat in outpost camp."
2289858,Guest,2013-12-21 08:23:00,0,fishermen have any of you guys fished williams lake lodge on sw section of lac seul talked to owners seemed like good package on fishing resort on williams lake 20 minutes to lac seul via river;1 hr drive on logging trail out of dryden;fishing 75% walleyes 25% northerns going mid september price range $600-650/week comments appreciated also stokes bay camp on rainy lake boat in to island on canada side seems very remote anyone fished it appreciate reports james wolf chicago boys
2289930,Guest,2013-12-21 09:06:00,0,"The owners Ken and Kathy are good people. The camp is clean and operated with everything a fishermen could need on the water, everything from clean boat rags, coolers for caught fish, all equipment for shorelunch. The only issue would be the boat ride to Lac Seul in the morning for some people, make sure you have everything for the day, bait, ice, coolers, shorelunch gear, toilet paper, etc. The most important thing is the fishing which is great for walleye and pike, expect to catch 50-100 fish each day with half the walleye between 22-27 inches in length."
2290146,Limeyangler,2013-12-21 10:50:00,563,"Awesome fishing in that area(Williams) ..its my local spot. Be warned the road to Dryden can be pretty rough, i would give yourself more than an hour to get in and out .even if you are not bringing your own boat, but well worth the effort!"
2290762,new hips,2013-12-21 18:59:00,498,been there 3 times........not with new owners.PM if you have concerns
2291042,Guest,2013-12-22 04:30:00,0,fishermen thanks for the posts and help on williams lake seems like our kind of place we will just take our time on the logging road not hauling a boat will meet with them at the show jim wolf chicago boys
2291474,wallydave,2013-12-22 09:42:00,2151,This place sounds interesting! Let us know how the trip.goes! Dave
2294682,Guest,2013-12-23 21:05:00,0,dave we will report on black bear camp in may and williams lake camp in september have you or any fishermen gone to stokes bay camp on canada side of rainy river 4 cabins on island very remote and supposely good fishing talked to owner last year seemed well organized and knowlegeable shorter drive which I like jim wolf chicago boys
2301177,wallydave,2013-12-27 14:46:00,2151,"Sorry Jim, no help on LOW camps, been a LS guy for many years, a shorter drive would be nice. WLL sounds interesting, even with the drive to camp, and the boat ride to LS. I like the remoteness, after the traffic jams around Ear Falls."
2301361,ftfarms,2013-12-27 16:13:00,444,Well how long and bad is this road. You all got me intrigued now. I want to try this place we used to pull our boats up to separation lake a 27 mile drive up the loging road it took almost two hours but it was well worth it for the great fishing.
2301465,Blades-n-Beads,2013-12-27 16:48:00,484,"Wolf1931, you will have the time of your life fishing out of WLL LacSeul, walleye candy store. Very remote area. Camp was made by fisherman for fisherman! Enjoy the ride in and take it slow. You will be going back year after year guaranteed."
