3933881,bkw67,2015-06-03 21:36:00,70,My 15 year old daughter starts drivers training on Friday She will have her Illinois permit when we head to Canada in July. I have already checked Wisconsin (she can't drive) and Minnesota (She can drive).But what about Canada? I haven't been able to find anything on the web.
3934289,CI_Guy,2015-06-04 05:45:00,2118,Check with your Ins. agent. When my youngest son had his permit we found out that our insurance would not cover him driving in Canada untill he had a license.
3935129,deadhead1,2015-06-04 09:24:00,193,"I am 95% sure she can not drive in Canada. Must be a full, valid, license."
3935265,bkw67,2015-06-04 09:58:00,70,"Thanks for the info guys!So she can only drive in Illinois and Minnesota on this trip. It is what it is. In Illinois, they have to get 50 hours of drive time with an adult before they can get their license in addition to turning 16. A minimum of 10 of the hours has to be Highway driving.Just trying to give her a chance to knock out a number of hours on the trip."

If there's an accident, things could get complicated. And accidents do happen, even if they're caused by someone else. Maybe I'm over-cautious, but that's my thought."
