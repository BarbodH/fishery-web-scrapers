3930185,mrpiker,2015-06-02 18:29:00,13,"Haha. Thanks for all the comments. I'm 40yrs old, and will be with 3 guys in their late 60s. I plan to bring 2 cases of beer and one bottle of booze. I'll also have one case of NA beer (don't know if they count that our not). We won't roll up looking like a big rowdy party, or step out with our pants sagging to our knees, or covered in piercings. Everything I know, there is no real reason to have concern. I think I just have to find something to worry about. The trip has been a long time in the making and I just want it to go well! Thanks again all"
3930409,Baseline,2015-06-02 19:33:00,3207,"The reason people convicted of DWI in the US are refused entry is because DWI is considered a felony in Canada. If your offenses are not felonies you will be allowed to entry. NOTE: You may take on case of beer or 1 liter of hard stuff or wine and one carton of cigarettes. Buy em at the Duty Free Shop and save a few bucks.ssOne additional comment ---- Convert you US dollars you plan on using in Canada. I've been up there twice this year and the Canadian businesses are have a hard time giving a fair exchange rate on the US dollar. Mostly the smaller businesses like the bait shops , rural gas stations and restaurants. They got used to the ONE for ONE exchange when the US dollar was weak. Now its 20% and they still want to give an AT PAR exchange. Some of them want 5% to take a credit card. The resorts who charge US Dollars raised their prices when the dollar was weak and they haven't rolled them back so they are effectively getting a 20% windfall. I guess if you agree to pay it up front you are stuck with it, but I'm almost tempted to negotiate with the resorts I use. Besides, what kind of currency do they get from the Canadians who stay at their resorts?"
3930561,runnin raps,2015-06-02 20:28:00,104,"------------------------------------ Spend the extra $50 over there and don't be so tight; you're on vacation enjoy it. The Canadian dollar is weak right now anyway so it's not like your taking a killing. As far as the customs agents, they are all pretty good just be polite and courteous. The message above about what to do at the booth is perfectly put. What is your purpose for coming here? Where are you going? How long will you be here? Do you have any alcohol or tobacco? Do you have any weapons in the vehicle? Those were my only questions today :-)"

3932457,dynamite,2015-06-03 13:44:00,20,The quoted exchange rate of $1.25 Canadian to $1.00 US is the international exchange rate. The best I could get at a US travel agency is $1.16 per US Dollar. Still not bad. You cannot expect the Canadian business to do much better than that.
3932505,tv4fish,2015-06-03 13:55:00,2694,"I just did the ""buy Canadian"" dollars today at my local bank. $1.00 US got me $1.19 Canadian."
3933641,MN_Moose,2015-06-03 20:29:00,964,"quite often law enforcement may ask a question such as that to gauge your reaction. They don't care how many guns you may own, they want to see if you answer honestly."
3925801,mrpiker,2015-06-01 16:26:00,13,"Thanks guys. This is all very helpful. Here's an update for what its worth...I called NOTO today and they told me that I will be fine. They then gave me the number for the border services, CBSA. There I talked with an officer who told me I'd be fine since the public intox isn't a criminal offense. He said that I could talk with a border agent if I wanted to, so he transferred me. The border agent said I'd be fine since the public intox was before the theft. He said if it was the other way around, it wouldn't be. That logic didn't make much sense but he was busy and I wasn't going to push it further wasting his time. I guess I should try to stop worrying about it and forge ahead. I spoke with three different people today who all told me I should be ok. The unnerving part is that they gave me three different reasons."
3926225,Nimstug,2015-06-01 18:46:00,2605,"I hope you wrote down their names, time you called, etc."
3927337,SinOrSwim,2015-06-02 06:24:00,1528,"LOL why would the public intox matter whether it was before or after? Plus, if it is not a criminal offense, why should it matter anyway. Better hope you don't get an agent that ""thinks"" it is an issue."
3927497,v-bay gord,2015-06-02 06:58:00,3168,I think the OP has received some reliable advice so no need to make him feel paranoid....
3927521,Shorelunch,2015-06-02 06:59:00,554,"I have similar ""mistakes"" (misdemenors) in my background and cross the border 2x per month and it's never been brought up - even if pulled inside. I would recommend bringing your legal amount of alcohol across to save quite a few bucks. Heck, if I was a Canadian customs agent, I would flag a vehicle with a bunch of guys if they weren't bringing booze across! :-) No worries mate."
3927537,SinOrSwim,2015-06-02 07:05:00,1528,"When you are in our shoes crossing the border with a potential issue, it is hard NOT to feel paranoid. We have been coming up for over 20 years and it is easily the most stressful part of the trip. As a matter of fact, my brother just stated the other day, he is done being the driver of the truck pulling the trailer. Why? Because the driver of our trailer with all the beer/liquor gets treated very poorly. We get told different things from different border officers. I would film it if I could. I crossed last year with my son only one month before I went with our group. I was treated GREAT. They didn't even charge me for the extra beer/liquor I had with me. Was told..........no worries.....have a great day!!! Then, one month later I'm made to feel like a criminal who they have to ""decide"" whether to let through. We paid way more duty because our stuff was in the trailer vs the individual trucks with the people. Yet, we did that based on advice from the previous year. So, we failed to get the free case of beer for about 6 guys. I'm the same person. All my information is the same. But, because I'm with a bunch of guys with beer I get treated very differently. Welcome to Canada!!!Imo, he has every reason to feel uneasy about his crossing."
3927825,MrSimon,2015-06-02 08:12:00,922,"SinOrSwim - not everyone has your level of anxiety issues. For the vast majority of US anglers going to Canada, the border crossing is a non-issue. We just roll with it and go fishing. The OP did a great job asking for advice, researching the laws, speaking with authorities, and is now looking forward to a great vacation. Good for him."
3928993,Shellback,2015-06-02 13:10:00,8083,Crossing at the Thousand islands tomorrow. My biggest stress is if the wait is too long and I have to pee!
3929297,SinOrSwim,2015-06-02 14:38:00,1528,"Good for you. I'm sharing MY opinion and MY experiences. The vast majority of our group have never done anything wrong either. Yet, because we take a lot of beer with us, we get treated like garbage. Not every year, but most. We are a group ranging in age from mid-30's to early 70's. From pharmacists, accountants, business owners etc. Not exactly the types looking for trouble. Yet, we have similar experiences year in and year out. For the record, we have NEVER had anyone turned back either. The OP asked a question and got 3 different answers. All I said was I hope he gets someone who doesn't think it's an issue. Will he get across? Probably. Should he have some anxiety........absolutely. I'm happy you do not Mr Simon. You must have angel wings compared to the rest of us ""hooligans"""
3930129,Da' Walleye Assassun,2015-06-02 18:17:00,358,I once had a female border agent ask how many firearms I owned and did I have a concealed carry permit.
3922969,mrpiker,2015-05-31 19:09:00,13,"Hello all. I am planning my first fishing trip to Canada this summer and am really excited. I've spent a lot of hours in these message boards and have had a ball. Thanks! It had never occurred to me that this may be a potential issue until reading recent posts that I've encountered. I have a two criminal notes on my record from my rowdy college youth years ago. The first is a public intox charge from 1996 which was dismissed. The second is a theft charge from 1998 (stupid prank on a fraternity). I actually thought they were both off of my record until I was recently questioned when applying for a firearm license and I incorrectly stated that I had no arrests on my record. It's odd because I've had several background checks and it's never come up before (at least no one had ever told me that I didn't answer that question correctly). In any case, everything I read, it sounds like I will LIKELY be okay since the charges were over 10 years ago. I will be crossing at International Falls. Is there anything else I can do? It's been many years since I've crossed the border and I'm not sure what to expect. How frequently are they running these checks? Is there a better time of the day to cross? Any words of wisdom for me? I've been looking forward to this trip forever and I don't like that I'm nervous about this now. thanks guys!"
3923089,v-bay gord,2015-05-31 19:48:00,3168,I would find out what is actually on your record. If it is two convictions then you may have a problem.......one over ten years old and you're good to go.
3923129,ftfarms,2015-05-31 20:22:00,444,Firearms license back ground check is though the FBI and so is the Canadian imagination that is running your passport. The ones inside the building that is. Not customs that's asking the questions at the both. And everything you got a ticket or arrested for is on your FBI record even if you were put on court supervision or found not guilty I found this out in 2010. In 2008 I was arrested for a DUI and was found not guilty. In 2010 we got pulled around and the man in side told me all what I just wrote. He run my passport a couple times to make sure it came back as a non conviction with that said you should be good to go. Have a great trip
3923193,mrpiker,2015-05-31 20:37:00,13,Thanks guys. I'll do a little more investigating. How frequently do they pull people inside typically?
3923681,SinOrSwim,2015-06-01 06:45:00,1528,"Good luck. There is no way for anyone to give you an answer because it is all so random. This is exactly what drives me crazy about the process. Here is a guy who wants to go fishing, will take time off his job, will spend a ton of money on gear, will pay a deposit and then spend the time it takes to drive to the border. The anxiety level will be at an all time high because there is no way to know whether he will be denied or not. Based on what you said, you really shouldn't have an issue............but you just never know. I hope all goes well for you."
3924393,MrSimon,2015-06-01 09:32:00,922,"Time of day doesn't really matter - too many variables. Just do everything you can to make things easy on the agent and hope for the best.Don't take alcohol or tobacco across - buy it up thereHave all of your passports in good order and hand them over in a nice neat stackRoll down ALL your windows at the booth and have everyone take off their sunglassesPut your vehicle in park and shut it off if it's loudDon't try to make any jokes - just answer their questions accurately and politelyDon't take eggs, chicken, or anything else that is in question right nowMake sure you know the name, address, and contact info of your lodgeMake sure everyone knows the last time they were in CanadaYou will probably get through .... but know where the nearest bus station is just in case."
3924473,mrpike24,2015-06-01 09:48:00,54,"I would be shocked if you had any problem whatsoever, even if you are brought inside. Being that they are both 10+ years ago and not being a felony or DUI, I think Canada will accept you with open arms. Just relax and enjoy, I know guys who have got checked with much worse records and they were still fishing the following day. Mr. Simon has good advice for what to do at the border, follow that and you'll be in good shape. If you are going up with someone who routinely goes to Canada they will know the drill and will help your cause at the border."
3924881,port1042,2015-06-01 11:26:00,509,"MrSimon's list is excellent advice. I just want to add one more. Unless a passenger is specifically questioned by the officer, let the driver do the talking. Answer all questions honestly and don't offer information that is not requested."
3924897,Mark R,2015-06-01 11:27:00,1538,"I agree with most of what Mr Simmon says. However, regarding beer & spirits and smokes we always buy that in the States and bring it across. The price of beer in Canada is very high and spirits forgetaboutit. Yeah, you will have to pay duty on your overage but I don't think that will have any bearing on the other issues you were worried about. Anyway Good Luck and let us know how you made out."
