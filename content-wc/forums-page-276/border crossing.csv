3940761,TIGHTLINER,2015-06-06 08:03:00,223,Just got back from a fishing trip in the nakina area. We crossed the border about 5:30 am the customs agent was not a happy camper. When i ask him if he knew if the casino was open for a money exchange he said he hoped it would never open. Tried to strike up a few words with him but all failed. He never ask if we had any eggs or chicken or anything pertaining to the same. Never really ask any of the normal questions. Gun smokes beverages. The only thing we could figure he maybe was at the casino the night before and lost a weeks wages. Coming home we pulled right in no waiting got in the line with the young very pretty agent ask what we had to claim told her 10 bottles of crown royal several bottles of perfume she said have a safe trip home.
