I remember how rough of a trip it was the first time I rode on 502 in 1984. Now I embrace the opportunity to see the scenery and being comfortanble with where I am at on a fairly remote road if something doesn't go as planned. Flew into the Peg last year and drove over to V-Bay for the night on the way to Red Lake. Stopped at the Safeway in Kenora and I was really impressed with how nice the store was and the overall selection of products. I bet my son and I spent the better part of an hour just looking for snacky snacks and stuff to nibble on during our 7 day trip adventure. I'd stop there again regardless of the prices on certain items. PjShorthorn"
3934145,btyreprich,2015-06-04 04:17:00,1067,"With regards to my comment on Highway 502 not being safe, I offer these comments: 1. Road is predominantly one lane in both directions. I have seen people drive their cars while pulling a trailer pass groups of other cars that just makes it unsafe for everyone. 2. Far more wildlife on 502 which is a real concern at dusk and dawn hours 3. highway 502 is full of hills, valleys, and turns 4. We were stuck on 502 for like 2 hours due to a very serious accident between a SUV and a logging truck. Medical helicopter flew in to take the seriously injured to the hospital. Terrible and tragic accident. We were one of the first cars to have to stop. I was so concerned with traffic behind us not stopping in time and hitting our car that I sent the two boys to stand far away from the shoulder until enough cars behind us stopped. 5. I have had to change tires twice over the years on 502. Again, as it's basically one lane in each direction changing a flat under these circumstances is scary! 6. Finally, the wife's SUV runs great but has 93k in mileage. While I don't expect any car problems, I'd feel safer on 71 as there are service stations on that route - none on 502 as everyone knows. Sorry it was a long post but my buddy and I did think carefully about this issue."
3934761,LOW1,2015-06-04 07:55:00,2828,"It's called Dalseg's and is a good grocery store. Somewhat limited by its size and like smaller stores everywhere not the broadest selection of fresh items, but more than adequate for essentials. Good meat selection. It also is an LCBO outlet, so you can get beer, etc at the same time as groceries. Parking is convenient if you are pulling something and it is right by Highway 71."
3934817,Bstar,2015-06-04 08:06:00,564,"Thanks LOW1. We will probably stop there on our way up to get some basics like eggs, bread ,etc. We'll probably get our Crawlers at Anglers Pro which I believe is nearby?"
3934825,LOW1,2015-06-04 08:11:00,2828,"Yes, in the same ""strip mall"" type building. It's on the east side of the road. Nestor Falls is somewhat in two parts, a north part and a south part. Dalseg's is in the north part."
3935065,Bill Krejca,2015-06-04 09:10:00,6107,"The first, which was the last time I traveled on 502. I marveled at the number of hills with an immediate curve just after cresting the hill. It really kept me alert, I'll say that. Going back, I enjoyed the drive on 71 immensely more. Another thought on the Emo grocery store - I especially like the large and very fresh selection of the great bread there that we in the U.S can't seem to be able to make. Bill"
3935105,deadhead1,2015-06-04 09:15:00,193,"In Kenora head to the ""mall"" and shop at No Frills. It's not fancy but best prices in town and decent selection. Safeway is nice but way more pricey. If you head thru town it is one block north at the Lake of The Woods Brewing Company which is in the old fire station at Park St. If you turn South on 4th Ave S, which is just west of Park, you will come to Safeway."
3935913,Mark R,2015-06-04 12:31:00,1538,I will agree that there are no shoulders on 502 but sections of are no bargain either. Good luck with the grocery store. We stopped at the Dryden wal mart when we came up 502 and that was the biggest mistake I made in a long time. A true nightmare getting thru the check outs. No one to bag the groceries except the checker and she only used one hand to check & bag. I had to double up the blood pressure meds after spending time in Walmart
3938625,Fisherman Ted,2015-06-05 09:59:00,461,"There is a warehouse club in Kenora that is loaded with plenty of food and produce. Good prices. Also, Consumers (a block from Safeway) has a butcher shop with plenty of great meats and fish."
3939937,spotter,2015-06-05 20:45:00,178,what about keewitan i heard they have very well stocked grocery store there
3932113,btyreprich,2015-06-03 11:46:00,1067,"Based on the numerous posts on poultry and eggs not being allowed into Canada and how Highway 502 is not safe, we have elected to: 1. Buy our eggs & chicken breasts in Canada 2. Take Highway 71 through Kenora on the way to Ear Falls As it has been many years since we have traveled through Kenora, I am asking people for suggestions on nice grocery stores in the town. I see there is a Walmart there - but thought there might be another option. Thanks everyone!"
3932321,RCDuck,2015-06-03 12:51:00,18,"I'm not a Kenora expert, but we were there last summer and there is a Safeway in town right on the water that is pretty nice.400 1st Ave SKenora, ON P9N 4W1"
3932369,LOW1,2015-06-03 13:03:00,2828,"The Kenora Walmart does not have a great grocery selection. As mentioned, Safeway is probably the nicest grocery store and has a quite decent selection. Probably the highest prices also. There are cheaper grocery stores but they are IMHO not as nice as Safeway. You didn't mention beer but some growlers from the LOW Brewery (not far from Safeway) packed in ice could be a nice addition."
3932409,port1042,2015-06-03 13:23:00,509,Leaving Fort Frances and heading west toward 71 you pass through Emo. There is a good supermarket on the east end of town on the right. You'll do well there. I picked up both eggs and chicken there last Friday.
3932569,Bill Krejca,2015-06-03 14:10:00,6107,"I'll second the Emo store, it should have about everything, not too bad on prices, as I remember. Beverage shopping is also conveniently nearby. Bill"
3932753,BRP,2015-06-03 15:05:00,77,Safeway for sure. It is a block south of the route you will take through town. It is as well stocked as most in Winnipeg. Even a Starbucks.
3932785,Bstar,2015-06-03 15:23:00,564,How about the IGA in Nestor Falls? I haven't been there myself. Does anybody have anything on that store?
3932873,Mark R,2015-06-03 15:46:00,1538,Why is 502 unsafe? It was fine two weeks ago
3933225,Larry S,2015-06-03 18:19:00,665,There use to be a Generic Grocery Store right by the Beer and Liquor store.
3933481,Blue Lk,2015-06-03 19:41:00,269,"I have to ask the same question,I talk to several guys every week in the tackle shop in Vermilion Bay who have travelled 502 without issues."
