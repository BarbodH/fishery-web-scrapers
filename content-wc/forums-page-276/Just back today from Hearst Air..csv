3932553,515,2015-06-03 14:07:00,254,"Thanks for the report. I fished there yrs ago in fall though and had alot of fun main lake fishing, definitely some big fish both walleyes and pike in the lake. That was the only lake we had close encounter with a bear on as well in al my year but he was just curious. Appreciate the report Mike"
3932729,Redline,2015-06-03 14:56:00,73,This! I can't even read the first post haha.
3933369,polaris-pete,2015-06-03 19:11:00,343,"Your point? If you don't like the report,then don't read it!"
3933425,forgop,2015-06-03 19:27:00,880,Paragraphs would make it readable. https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/606/01/ Maybe I'll ask my 10 and 12 year old daughters to write our fishing report in a couple of weeks so you can understand the difference on how to do it and how not to do it.
3933505,pjshorthorn,2015-06-03 19:50:00,5654,"What's the diff? This isn't a composition writing or English class. My impression is that the content of the fishing report is what most folks are interested in reading about. The trip report accomplished that aspect. If perfect grammer, spelling and sentence structure were an absolute requirement in order to post something on this forum, the edit option would not be available to posters....they would be expected to do it perfectly or run the risk of being chastised publicly for not doing so......GGGEEEZZZZ.Please travel safe on your trip and look forward to the report on how your daughters enjoyed their adventure with Dad. It should be a very special week for you all.PjShorthorn"
3933609,forgop,2015-06-03 20:25:00,880,I'm not stating it has to meet APA format for a graduate thesis and I'm not spell checking the report. Just a little effort goes a long way though in writing something that everyone can read it without difficulty.
3933721,pjshorthorn,2015-06-03 20:55:00,5654,"As I mentioned, what's the diff ? As I recall, you asked for information on suggestions for your trip this year with your daughters. That is what this forum is all about. If I had sent sent a lengthy reply on suggestions for your trip , without paragraphs, would you have appreciated the information regardless or would you have responded.....Paragraphs ?? My gut says you appreciatedall the information and any other responses, regardless of the format, because it was an important inquiry that you made. PjShorthorn"
3933801,Draco1206,2015-06-03 21:07:00,175,"I believe the op met all of the tenets for a paragraph, albeit an extremely long one. If you're having a hard time reading it just magnify it a few times and you should be ok. Anyways I thank the op for taking the time to post his report and hope others won't be afraid to post their reports for fear of being criticized for their writing style."
3935185,MrSimon,2015-06-04 09:41:00,922,Nice report. Thanks for posting. Hearst Air is top notch. Glad you had fun.
3922425,polaris-pete,2015-05-31 15:37:00,343,"Just back from a 7 day trip with Hearst Air.My reports are not really long but first I just want to Thank Melanie, Owner of Hearst Air and her Brother Mike , our fly-in Pilot and Steve, a new Pilot who flew us out of McLeister Lake.They all did an outstanding job from arrival to departure. Any questions or concerns were quickly addressed.The cabin was spotless and there was firewood all cut and stacked, previously from the 4 Fishermen from Hamilton who have booked this Lake for many many years opening week of walleye. Great bunch of Guys, we helped load the plane with their gear for departure and they in turn helped us carry all our gear up to the cabin. Cabin is all logs and freshly painted floors and enought pots and pans and utensils to supply an Army. Melanie gave us a hugh new coofee pot and frying pan to take in to the cabin. The flight in and out was beautiful and both Pilots conversed the entire trips telling us about the region and the different aircraft they have. They just bought a beautiful Cessna Caravan and it was like flying in a Cadillac. We flew in on this and out on the Beaver.Their operation is 1ST Class. The planes are very well maintained and no issues with them. They now have a fleet of 4 planes to help enlarge the Business.The weather was nothing like the Weather forecasts called for, to say the least.It snowed, rained, thundered and a couple times we think we saw the Sun!!! Boats were all in great condition and motors ran flawlessly.We are not like some that have to count every single fish to tell all but I will truthfully say that at no time did we lack for abuntance of nice walleyes,We did not get a lot in the Lake itself as as we found out later on, they were still up in the creeks and River spawning. Many of the smaller males still had a lot of milk in them when caught. The largest was 26 inches and back in she went. We had 4 nice dinners and any over 16 inches weer released back in the water.We found one honey hole in the Creek where 26 times we trolled thru it we caught 25 fish!!! When the fronts moved in and out of the area the fish shut right down, even the Northern Pike. Northern pike now they are a different story, we caught over 200 or so for the week, maybe more but they were all over the Lake and creeks.The largest was 37 inches and we kept none.They would hit anything in the water, anyone who fishes just for them would have had a blast.We caught the majority of the walleyes in 4-9 ft of water.Worm harnesses did not produce many fish either, We used all floater lures with no weight trolling.We saw so many beavers that we never tried counting them, all over the place.Saw 9 Eagles and the one day a young one and its Mother we think flew right over us in the River, the young one had a wiggling fish in its talons, beautiful sight.We saw no moose while there but 1 on the flight out.One thing I will say is that in my 36 years of doing this type of fishing not once did I have a Bear up close, Well we did this time! The day after we arrived I went to the outhouse and found the front of the door torn and ripped in spots with large claw marks on it. The next night after fishing we approached the dockand there he was, almost on the front porch of the cabin! He was a very large bear and we floated around in front of the cabin to be sure there were no cubs with it, seemed he was alone and was not in the least way concerned we were there.We finall decided to try and make him leave the premises!! After alot of screaming and hollering he ran about 20 ft to the corner of the cabin and stood there watching the 2 idiots screaming at him. Finally he had had enough and took off down the rocky shore never to be seen again.My friend has a device for Emergency use seeing no sat phone or cell service is available that enables you to text a phone or a 911 in an Emergency.He used it to text Melanie at the Base and on Wednesday for our mid-week chck one of the Guys used a self propelled DR Brush Cutter to cut brush all around the perimiter of the cabin so if the Bear did come back at least we could see him further away and didnt surprise him.Saturday morning we woke up to find very foggy conditions and the temp was 37 degrees F.We were sure the fly out would be delayed but at arounf 8 am we heard the Beaver coming in.He flew over the Lake a couple times to check for winds and landed and into the dock he came. Hechatted for a short time, checked the cabin out and in no time off we headed to the Base. Thats about it but in closing, we were so impressed with Mel and Crew, the lakes they have, the nicely kept Cabins that we decided to leave our Deposit for next year.First time I have done this in all those years of fishing!.To all that have not gotten out yet up North on a trip, hope you all have a safe trip."
3922473,Mike Borger,2015-05-31 16:11:00,1554,"Glad to hear things went well Pete. The bear encounter just adds to the story. I'm a big fan of Hearst Air myself, you're right, they're first class!"
3922561,polaris-pete,2015-05-31 16:42:00,343,Thanks Mike. You were very helpful previously in helping us make this decision.Mel did mention your name and in a Good Way!! Glad to see you also had a great trip with your Friend and Boys.
3922705,RickOnt,2015-05-31 17:26:00,217,Pete Glad you had a good trip and some nice Walleye meals!! I have read nothing but good reviews on Hearst Air and yours is another. The Bear encounter just shows ya they are out there and you can never be too careful. Glad it all worked out. Cheers Rick
3922817,phishfearme,2015-05-31 18:18:00,1242,thanks for the detailed report pete - glad you had a nice time - the weather this time of year can indeed be all for seasons in one day. phish
3922825,fishron,2015-05-31 18:18:00,317,Thanks for sharing. It sounds like you had a great trip. Its what we all hope for. Your adventures with the bear bring to mind one time when we were navigating a narrow passage on lake Cabonga. A tiny cub was swimming across the narrow ( maybe 100 ft) connection between two land masses. We could have reached down and sruffed him he was so vulnerable. We knew mom was on the other side although we never saw her. Of course we choose to let him continue without adding to his sense of vulnerability. Just another memory that keeps us going back.
3923241,adempsey,2015-05-31 21:24:00,963,Sounds like the perfect trip to me =)
3924145,polaris-pete,2015-06-01 08:31:00,343,Yes Great trip. I also like your nice website. Lots of helpful info on it for both old and new Fisher people. Have a great Summer.
3924281,Pymbet,2015-06-01 08:53:00,42,"Appreciate your report. Our group of six is going in to McCleister on June 19. It will be our first time there and we are looking forward to a experiencing a new lake. We also look forward to seeing Melanie and the gang at Heart Air again - as everyone said, they are top notch. And I hope that bear kept going in the same direction -away from camp, but we won't leave anything lying around just in case."
3926377,polaris-pete,2015-06-01 19:12:00,343,"anything I can help you with, just ask."
