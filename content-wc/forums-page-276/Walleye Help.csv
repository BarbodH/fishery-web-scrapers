My group has been fishing a system for 5 years now, it has the Turtle River flowing through it before it flows into Rainy lake. This is a lake that is over 6,000 acres. The problem is, for 5 year we have had no problem catching our walleye limit, its just the size that is the issue, 12-14 inches on average. The largest walleye that has been caught in this lake in 5 years by our group is 20 inches. With such a large population of walleye there has to be bigger fish in the lake right? Typically use jig & twister tail, jig & worm, or Lindy rig. Have tried crank baits also. Bottom is mostly sand with lots of islands on the main body. Also, there is a HUGE Smallmouth population in this lake, in size and quantity. Going back up there in late June, wanting to catch some larger walleyes. Any help is much appreciated!!!"
3939345,dan cardinal,2015-06-05 14:13:00,64,I can potentially be of better help provided some more information:1) Average depth and maximum depth of lake?2) Water clarity? Dark? Stained? Clear?3) Do you utilize a fish locator/depth finder? What type?4) What presentations do you mostly utilize? Casting to shore? Trolling? Drifting?5) Average depth you are fishing?6) Is there a map of the lake?

Of course, there may be reasons that keep you going back to the same lake - sounds like the smallmouth fishing is fantastic, but if your goal is quality walleyes, then five years would be four more than it would take for me to look elsewhere. Honestly, 12 - 14"" is pretty tiny. Twenty inches is okay, but that should be a daily occurrence in that part of the country. Your lake is surrounded by quality fisheries. Rainy, LOTWs and Eagle are all nearby and Lac Seul is just a couple hours north.I've asked guides their opinions regarding if you're catching nothing but small walleye, should you stay or move, and I've heard two different answers. Some have told me you should stay where you are because it's a numbers game and if you're catching smaller fish, there are big ones there too. Others have said the opposite and that you should move, probably deeper, to find bigger walleye. I'd say it's likely that your lake probably holds some pigs, but if there were many there, you'd have found them by now."

If your going to concentrate on Walleye. Also The lakes you mention get hit very hard. A fly in trip with an outfitter who has exclucive rights to a lake and can control the pressure that is put on a lake. Slot limits and numbers of fish you can take does alot for the health of a fishery. On the lake I fish The slot is from 14 to 20"" on the walleye you can harvest, Only 4 per day per person, Any fish over or under must be put back in the lake After a nice picture of course"
3940577,Freytown,2015-06-06 07:08:00,770,"Lake Erie has both smallie's and walleye's. No stunting going on in Erie, Erie probably produces the biggest of both species in N.America. Right? Just sayin'. It's been my experiences that the further North you travel walleye size will decrease."
3940681,octanehi5,2015-06-06 07:32:00,1104,"Not going to argue that Frey, Erie and Ontario, Produce big fish, if looking for a trophy size walleye 10+lbs and 30"" + Thats the best place on the planet to catch them. Targeting Walleye And not Smallies, requires fishing out of the Smallies range. I know on Hebert the record walleye is 14 lbs. Average size walleye we catch are 18"" every day.I myself only keep 19 to 20"" fish for the fries,or to bring home, most fish for the $. Catching an averge of 450 to 500 Walleye in a week, Is a trip that most fisherman only dream about. My 11th yr. on Hebert In only 16 days!"
3940801,bigdaddyguns,2015-06-06 08:24:00,608,"Another aspect to consider is the larger walleye in this system may switch to a different forage base as they grow beyond a certain point. If the lake has ciscos or whitefish the larger walleye may be seeking them out as nutritionally they as are more efficient (higher calorie content) food. As previously pointed out in this thread more information about the lake ecosystem will help shorten the time to figure out the potential in this lake. Trial and error over open water a week at a time on a 6000 acre lake will be a tedious approach. The methods and tactics will definitely change over open water as the walleye will be suspended around forage base and won't be bottom oriented. If there is not an open water forage base, this will all be for naught. I would do some more homework on this lake to determine its potential or be content with SMB and 12""-14"" walleye."
3942169,kzoofisher,2015-06-06 20:49:00,5144,"You may have a ""numbers"" lake and not a ""size"" lake. The distinction comes up pretty often in threads where people are looking for recommendations. Some places have both. Some are primarily walleye lakes with some pike or SMB, others are bass lakes with some 'eyes and pike. It can take a while to find the mix you like best but I think you've given your current location plenty of time to get its hooks in you. If you're dissatisfied then pick out the characteristics you like best, post them here and get a hundred recommendations. I've settled on a lake where I get quite a bit of privacy, good walleye fishing with fish over 20"" common but hogs are rare, fair SMB fishing and a few pike. I like the mix. I like that it lends itself to my style of fishing and I like that it isn't a cakewalk. You still have to work a little bit for them but once you identify the days pattern it can be a numbers game. There are portage lakes I can pop over to with great SMB and fair walleye. The lodge also has a camp on a sister lake, it flows into the one I'm on, that is fantastic for SMB and has good numbers of smaller walleye. As the crow flies they aren't a couple miles apart yet they are totally different fisheries. Having said all that, if you are on a lake where everyone else is catching walleye and all you are catching is bass well, the problem ain't the lake. That doesn't sound like your situation at all so I'm guessing your a competent walleye fisherman. Why not make a change and see if you like it better, you can always go back."
