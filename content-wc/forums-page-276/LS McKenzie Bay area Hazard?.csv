3933457,Pooch,2015-06-03 19:40:00,4619,I thought I remember a shallow hazardous area somewhere in the middle of McKenzie Bay about where I have a yellow circle on the attached snapshot of a map. Any one else seen it or know about where it is? It wasn't on any map anywhere.Would like to mark it on my paper map.Pooch

It is probably 500 hundred yards out of the mouth towards Big Sand. If you stay towards the closest shoreline for that distance you will not have any issues. After that shelf you can head directly to Big Sands if that is your destination. That's the only shelf in the middle until you get further down the bay. On my Hot maps chip most of the major reefs and trouble areas are well marked."

N50 28.784 W92 52.853 Sometimes the shelf around that area is decent fishing. It does top out in the 3-6' range. There are some nice size boulders there. Caught smallies and walleyes there.To the east of there is another @ N50 28.822 W 92 53.802 west of the red buoy.The next island to the south/east of Moose island has a hump that tops out in the 1-3' range due north of that island 30 yards"

That would really help all of us avoid grief. Especially if LS water level is down from what everyone is used to.Thanks a big bunch for your help so far. WC is a great place for sharing stuff like this.Pooch"
3934153,fLyInOnH20,2015-06-04 04:34:00,15,If water is low like 5-6 years ago you will see this one heading into McKenzie. This area is only a issue if you head towards the south side of Moose Island. If you stay close to shore exiting Shanty going east and go to the north side of Moose Island you will miss it.GPS coordinate listed in above post> N50 28.784 W92 52.853.Other reef west of red buoy not in your picture.
3936257,Guest,2015-06-04 14:16:00,0,The pool level in the Lac Seul Reservoir is right where it should be this time of year. They must have had a downpour about 2 weeks ago and the inflow from the surrounding lakes is bringing the pool level up nicely.
