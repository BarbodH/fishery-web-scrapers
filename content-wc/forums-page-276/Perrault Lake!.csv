3899250,bearfvr13,2015-05-23 17:23:00,174,I stay at PLC.....its a nice camp. Let the countdown begin.........................
3899578,alanexpup,2015-05-23 20:25:00,278,that's where we are staying too. the manotak dock cam is really good. here it is 7;30 and the its 9;30 and its still bright out.
3921081,port1042,2015-05-31 07:17:00,509,"Got back from a great week on Perrault Lake (Manotak Lodge) last night. The water level is really very good which was a pleasant surprise. Fishing was great. It appears that the walleyes are starting to move out of the rivers and you'll find them all over the lake. Our best was a 27"" but we had lots of fish over 18 and lots under for eating and taking home. 30's are being caught (but not by me). Northerns were very active. I got a 31"", a 33"", and 36"" out of Jackfish (outside the sanctuary) one morning! I'm still looking for my 40"". We were surprised with some very nice perch. Not a lot of them, but we got 16 over 12"" and one over 14"" on a small minnow and jig. If you're staying at Manotak the new owners are doing a great job so don't worry about that. Tight lines!"
3935425,BlueJayBert,2015-06-04 10:32:00,15,Will be on Perrault Lake from June 20-26th..How do you fish for walleye during a Mayfly Hatch? and does it change how you fish for Northern and/or Smallies?
3886209,team walleye,2015-05-19 14:01:00,336,Heading up to Perrault the second weekend of June! Can't wait! Anyone else heading to Perrault or that way?
3886393,teddi,2015-05-19 14:40:00,349,Second week of june you should have very good fishing.
3886817,team walleye,2015-05-19 17:15:00,336,I am sure hoping so!
3886993,revitup,2015-05-19 17:58:00,140,Our group will be on Cedar June 6-13. Don't know if you're considering that the first or second week of June. We get into the Perrault lake area while up there. We stay at keystone lake lodge. Nice set up for us.
3887201,nitroman,2015-05-19 19:01:00,368,Same week as revitup but we stay at Cedar Point Resort.
3887233,mdoehling,2015-05-19 19:08:00,81,our group has been staying on cedar the 3rd/4th week of June for the past several trips and have found the walleye fishing tough. How is Perrault that time of June?
3887321,team walleye,2015-05-19 19:55:00,336,We have always had good luck on Perrault!
3887601,alanexpup,2015-05-19 21:49:00,278,will up there the last 2 weeks of june. hopefully there is NO SNOW!. at Perrault lake camp.
3889153,team walleye,2015-05-20 11:08:00,336,How do you like Perrault Lake Camp? We stay at Rainbow and have stayed at Rocky Shore. Both are very nice. Perrault Lake Camp looks very nice as well!
3889409,alanexpup,2015-05-20 11:54:00,278,HI. this will be our first time. we needed a place that would allow our little snauzer and they would. when we lived Chicago we would either go to lac saul or lake of the woods. now we live in las vegas so it is a drive but hopefully fishing is still as good as it was.
