3922305,geomax,2015-05-31 14:55:00,29,"Many I talked to were saying fishing started a bit slow, but like any year you just need to be on the spot for the time of the season. Most fish still in shallow/fast moving water. If you know Sioux there is plenty of good action at the Iron Bridge, Frog Rapids, the Chutes and anywhere else the water is moving. Water has still been coming up but nowhere near as high as last year that was an anomaly. Will need to know your rocks a bit better this year, last year was a free pass for most people to travel anywhere they pleased."

3934849,redryder,2015-06-04 08:19:00,33,"Been pretty good fishing outside the entrance to Rice river, lots of slot size and enough just under for good eats.Almost always boats fishing below the chutes and sometimes above the chutes, must be catching something. Always somebody fishing atFrog rapids and usually at the iron bridge."
3936929,bearplott,2015-06-04 17:11:00,5,What iron bridge are you referring to?
3938201,rockape,2015-06-05 07:53:00,215,The train bridge by the public ramp on Pelican Lake. Always walleyes there. I've never caught any big ones there though.
3938265,bearplott,2015-06-05 08:16:00,5,Ok. We've never gone into Pelican much past Frog Rapids. Thanks!
