3937569,ftfarms,2015-06-04 20:59:00,444,I believe blue light was under $30 US funds in bottles. And Kokanee was around $36 US funds.

3936185,YellowHead,2015-06-04 14:03:00,4,Leaving tomorrow for Pakwash and was curious what the cost of a case of beer is? Anything along the lines of Blue Light would give me a ball park. Any recent travelers? Thanks.
3936249,wallydave,2015-06-04 14:14:00,2151,Beer is pricy up North! You can bring one case per adult with you without paying a duty.
3936801,YellowHead,2015-06-04 16:32:00,4,I am aware of that but I am going to grab some to take home and was just curious what the prices are.
3936833,BRP,2015-06-04 16:36:00,77,Plan on about $2 cdn per beer up here.
3936841,pjshorthorn,2015-06-04 16:38:00,5654,"As a starting point, double the cost of what you would normally pay in the states. For a case of Blue I'm guessing you'll pay $40 -45 CDN. I'm not sure if the Beer Store publishes prices or not, but it may worth a search. PjShorthorn"

3936897,Golden Eagle,2015-06-04 17:00:00,2642,Pick it up at the Canadian duty free store on the way home. Pretty sure I paid $20 U.S. coming home May 23.
3937145,RickOnt,2015-06-04 18:44:00,217,At the 'Beer Store' 24 cans of Molson's about $36 Canadian funds
3937497,Aspencreek,2015-06-04 20:52:00,2911,"If you are planning on bringing some home hit the duty free shop, and grab a case of Kokanee and a liter of Weisers for me. MMMMMMM!"
