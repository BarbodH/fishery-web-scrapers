3939513,Draco1206,2015-06-05 15:59:00,175,"Not sure you caught on to what Griff and I were trying to point out and that was the hypocrisy of Octanehi5, who recently berated a member for asking a question about smallmouth fishing, saying this is a ""walleye fishing site""but has had several posts talking about pike and replied to this post about pike fishing. I guess if he fishes for pike it's ok for him to talk about it on this ""walleye fishing site"", but not ok for others."
3939569,kzoofisher,2015-06-05 16:55:00,5144,"I enjoyed the posts, almost as much as catching a big smallmouth."
3940329,octanehi5,2015-06-06 05:47:00,1104,"Now your talking about real Canadian shield fishing ,In 25 + yrs. of fishing Canada, On the Gouin or Hebert you Will not be fishing for Smallmouth. And by the way to cover talking about Pike on a walleye site. walleyes are the best bait for pike. Make very good table fair as well as the Walleyes, I really try to stick to a walleye topic on this site, And have helped many members of this site. We are all entiteled to our opinions. So don""t get your Panties in a Bunch Boys"
