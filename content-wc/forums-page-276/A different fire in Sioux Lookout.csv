Don't recall anyone talking about that one. Any word from locals if THAT'S reopened? Never ate there myself, but geez, the options for food in Sioux are becoming limited."
3936265,redryder,2015-06-04 14:17:00,33,"Yes, serious smoke damage at Dick and Nellies. Not sure if they will be reopening, but if they do, I doubt it will be this summer. So ya, if you are coming to Sioux, pack a lunch. We still have, not in any particular order, Chicken Chef, Subway, Tim Horton's, The Wellington (probably the best for full course meals) The Fifth Avenue, The Kowloon. Foxy's at Andersons Lodge. I think the Curling club is now staying open late so that might be an option also. Not going to see anybody starve to death but it isn't culinary nirvana for sure."
3936313,tv4fish,2015-06-04 14:32:00,2694,I think the Wellington better expand ---- I think they are going to be VERY busy........

3938409,redryder,2015-06-05 08:58:00,33,"Not sure if those were my pics of some I took off the Community F/B page. Just tried to get the more intense ones on there. I hear they are going to rebuild, but I can't see it being open this year. Cigarette was the cause i do believe."
3938633,bigwalleye1,2015-06-05 10:00:00,2632,"Thanks, Redryder. Another sad deal, gotta be a big economic hit to the area at an especially bad time. Poor folks out of work at the height of the already short tourist season."
3939385,Bill Krejca,2015-06-05 14:28:00,6107,I believe Knobby's is the place referenced in the great semi-fictional articles in In-Fisherman Magazine. I wonder whether the author will feature a short story based with a slant on the fire? Bill

3941721,Pooch,2015-06-06 17:47:00,4619,"I used to read ""North with Doc"", but dropped the subscription.Liked the ""North with Doc"" series as I could swear that it was written by any one about our group. Probably all groups could read into themselves each months stories. Always well written and a good chuckle.Too bad about both eateries. Usually ate at one or the other when in the area.Pooch"
