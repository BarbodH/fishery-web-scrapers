Many lodges on Eagle Lake have a self imposed rule that no walleye over the slot size (18-23 inches) will be filleted by the lodge. Many fly in operations have similar self imposed rules. No one is above the law, but as a guest you are just that.....a guest."
3555954,Stu,2015-02-18 07:45:00,472,"Wolf1031, Holinshead is a dedicated Conservation Lake. Their website states that they have entered into an agreement with the MNR and no fish are to be taken home. I do not know if this is a self-imposed policy or if there is a specific law prohibiting taking fish from the resort, but I have sent them an email asking for clarification and hope to get an answer for you soon. That being said, I agree that the lake is public waters, however, when you rent a cabin at their resort; you are also entering into an agreement with them that you will abide by all of their rules. If you refuse to accept their terms, while you may not have broken any law, I can assure you that you will not be welcomed back. Greg and Charlene have a wonderful operation and I can attest to the success of their policies. I have caught more and bigger walleyes at Holinshead than anywhere else in Canada and I have been going since 1993. To comment on Whopper's post, they do not offer packaged fillets to take home, but this was not a problem for me or any of my fishing partners."
3556450,Guest,2015-02-18 09:31:00,0,"stu appreciate your comments I guess I just don't like that some people feel they ""own"" public waters Canadians especially I would think would be upset since they pay taxes if every lodge had the same rule they probably eventually have no fishermen if taken to court I am sure the fishermen would have judgement in their favor are they going to personally going to search all your bags and cooler for fish this is personal property and they have no legal right to search your personal property ?? jw"
3556706,Fisherman Ted,2015-02-18 10:27:00,461,"Actually lodge owners do have a legal right to impose certain restrictions if they have entered into a contract with MNR (and not just come up with a ""policy""). All waters are public, sure but as a guest of the resort that has access to those lakes (with boat caches) fishermen need to abide by that policy we have entered into with MNR (via a signed paper contract). Now is this legal, who has the jurisdiction, what trumps what? Who knows. And it doesn't really matter.As a lodge owner myself (and one that does have a contract with MNR on all my lakes that goes a step further to say we are 100% catch and release) I am not going to quibble with my guests. I am very upfront all over my web-site to make sure my fishermen know that and will even recommend another lodge if catching and bringing fish home is a deal breaker. I get it, everyone is looking for something different. However, in the past 7 years this has only happened to me once and indeed. those guests were warned and then asked to never return.As long as the lodge owner is up-front with their policies, whether they are contractual or not I think it is safe to say their guests are required to abide by those rules."

3936809,Bobwanni,2015-06-04 16:35:00,14,"We have reservations at Holinshead Lake Resort for second week of August. Most posts on this lake are old, has anyone a report in last 1-2 years? Lived in Bear country Alaska for many years thought it might be fun to try a fishing trip during bear opener. Also what about preserved minnows, I've looked at several types/sizes, any advise? I've had Great luck on northern MN lake with plastics don't know why they wouldn't work there also....."
3939489,Stu,2015-06-05 15:45:00,472,"We are going to be there the same week! I've never used persevered minnows, but you shouldn't need them, Greg has live minnows and leeches and the lodge. Shoot me an email (sl[email protected]) and I'll answer all of your questions."
3526322,Bobwanni,2015-02-09 20:42:00,14,Taking my grandson to Ontario this late August and wondering if anyone has recent info on Lake Wawang. Great looking web site but read some old posts which spelled disaster. Can you help ?
3526698,Guest,2015-02-10 06:00:00,0,"minnow I would not recommend this resort they do a very slick advertising job but the fishing was the wrost we experienced in 40 years went last week of may some days 4 fishermen fishing 12 hr days 2-3 small walleyes all day there are 2 lakes connected by a channel the lake where the resort was according to owner a northern hot spot we fished the ""hot"" northern bays hard for a week 4-5 small snakes we have been going for 40 years so I think we know what we are doing best day was the portage lake extra charge we were not told until we asked to fish it probably about 50 walleyes for the day good steady action I had the highlight of the week on the main lakes 2 big walleyes 25"" 7# 27"" 9# (my best ever) however I would have traded both for good steady fishing another problem no docks pull boats on shore a pain to launch daily oneday a bad rain during the night boats swamped lost a 1/2 day of fishing trying to drain boats in the water constantly asking for things like can openers basics they did not have seemed like they run on seat of their pants many other good lodges to go to why waste your time here I have attempted to state it as we saw it fished for one week jim wolf Chicago boys also another waste of time black bear camp on red lake motor's from the 70's would not start and keep running"
3527098,Bobwanni,2015-02-10 07:31:00,14,"Thanks, we live on Leech Lake during spring/summer/fall so have caughts numerous big walleyes but I want this to be a special time/place for bonding with my 13 year old granson. It will be his first Canada experience and it needs to be a positive time. Thanks for your input, I appreciate it."
3527146,Mike Borger,2015-02-10 07:40:00,1554,If it's a drive-to you're considering have a look at Holinshead Lake in the same general area. Have only heard positive things about it.http://holinshead.ca/
3528234,Whopper,2015-02-10 12:04:00,340,"I can second Holinshead. Nice place with plenty of walleye and pike. Four of us were looking for an alternate to flyin fishing so we could take our sons, it didn't disappoint. My son didn't like walleye fishing until I took him there. Three of the dads still go every August and I hear good reports every time they return."
3530418,roscoe33,2015-02-10 23:35:00,653,"Have been to wawang many times. Fishing there is always hit and miss. The road into the camp is bad. BAD. Have seen many broken trailers on that road. Dad had a camper there for years, or I wouldn't have gone there. Dad doesn't do Canada any more, and we sold the camper, so I won't go back. Still have relatives that go there. I would suggest moving your trip. Catching walleyes in late August can be awful tough. I've been going to lac des mille lodge for a few years, great people, nice cabins, plenty of fish. But I've never been there in August. Your stay will be about $500 per person with lodging, docking, minnows, and taxes. It's just west of Upsala, on a decent road. Also, they have ""motel rooms"" for just 2 people, with a mini kitchen, stove, sink, fridge, cookware, and dishes. For a larger group, you will need a cabin. They also have several small basic campsites.http://www.lacdesmille.com/index.html"
3548626,Stu,2015-02-16 07:42:00,472,"Wawang was on my short list of places to visit, but I decided that it wasn't worth the risk. I have been going to Holinshead for 4 years now and will be back this summer. The walleye fishing is out of this world. It is a true hundred fish a day lake and we have boated at least one 24 fish (or bigger) every day we fished. My wife and 12 year old son go with me now and they have zero fishing experience and pull in eyes one after another. Greg has a nice pontoon boat and always finds time to take kids out on the lake. The lodge fills up fast and you may not be able to get in this year. If you can't get in, I would suggest trying Press Lake. I have never been there, but it also comes highly recommended. Good luck, let us know how you do - Stu"
3554410,drlee,2015-02-17 18:32:00,409,Stu is right on. Press is a fine numbers lake for walleye and northern; I have fished Press for two weeks every summer for many years. I have not fished Holinshead but have read many great reports and have explored going there. I can tell you that everything is just right to make it a go to destination. Stu has a lot of experience and knows what he is about. Best of luck!
3555106,Guest,2015-02-18 05:05:00,0,"fishermen would appreciate a comment was told the resort on the lake will not allow fishermen to take fish home even though they have license: I assume the lake is public waters and I feel the owner has no legal right to impose this restriction your comments are appreciated jw we are only use conservation license only allowed 2 walleye and 2 northerns we are not greedy we are sporstmans never have ever taken home a ""big"" fish we pay good money to fish once a year and we feel no one is above the law ??"
3555282,Whopper,2015-02-18 05:38:00,340,When our group went we knew up front what the deal was with taking fish out of the lake to transport home so it wasn't a problem. We ate fish every day except one during our stay. I don't know if the current owners do the same thing but the previous owners gave us pre-package filets that were marked if we wanted to take them home. I looked at it like the camp owners were protecting their resource. This is just my opinion and I'll probably catch some flack over it but if bringing home a limit of fish is a deal breaker then you may want to reconsider a trip across border.
