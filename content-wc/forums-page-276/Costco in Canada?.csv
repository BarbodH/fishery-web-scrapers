3928329,Baitslinger,2015-06-02 10:20:00,93,"We are part of a large group (22 people for a family reunion) headed into NW Ontario in late June. As several members have health & diet issues, we will be hauling a lot of fruits and vegetables with us, plus eggs, chicken, hamburger, etc. (Sadly, maybe more healthy food than beer, but who ever said that beer wasn't health food?)Anyways, we will be driving through Winnipeg, and have thought about stopping at Costco there to pick up most of those supplies that cannot be brought across the border, instead of the smaller grocery stores in Dryden or Red Lake. Does anyone have any experience with the Costco stores in Winnipeg or other cities in Canada? I assume they have most of the same food items that we have at our stores in the states, but wanted to check and be sure.Should be quite an experience cooking, travelling and fishing with such a large crowd, but it will also probably be a once in a lifetime trip as a 50th anniversary party with 4 generations, all culminating in a giant shore lunch celebration for my parents. So much better than a cruise or a trip to Disney!!"

3930473,Limeyangler,2015-06-02 19:52:00,563,"Just a heads up, Walmart in Dryden now does fresh produce."
3930537,toula,2015-06-02 20:19:00,54,Safeway and Extra foods in Dryden as well....lots of options
