3926097,sbe2,2015-06-01 18:13:00,63,Any new information?
3932977,East coast,2015-06-03 16:35:00,32,"Just got back. Water level is about 2-3 feet lower than last year. If last year it was 6 feet below full, then 8-10 is a fair guess. Water was cold but that didn't stop too much of the action. Fished mostly Northerns with fish of 45"", 43"", 43"", 40"", 39"" plus numerous mid 30s coming into the boat. Windy points/bays with bottom bouncers were the key for the eyes, fish of 27"", 30"", 7 and 8 lbs respectively also landed. Shallow water was key."
3934073,Freytown,2015-06-04 03:19:00,770,Thxs for the update. Sounds like you had a very good trip. Lower levels make the search easier. What area of the Gouin did you fish???
3934265,TheDFP,2015-06-04 05:37:00,39,Thanks for the update. We leave Friday morning. How was the road going in?
3934953,East coast,2015-06-04 08:33:00,32,"We came from Latuque, roads were good, no washouts, lots of loose gravel from recent grading though. We stayed at the Oasis Du Gouin and fished the middle of the reservoir. Even with the lower water we found we had to work a little harder to find the big girls, but then again it may have been a few cool days driving the fish down lower. For Pike we normally do a lot a of sight fishing but with the lower levels you had to trust some areas and coax them off the bottom. Most productive areas were bays in the 2-5 foot range where you could not not see bottom. No problem finding the eyes, locate the right water temps, fish the wind battered shores with lures close to the bottom and you will be rewarded. To all those yet to go, have fun and enjoy! Wish I was going again already."
3887857,Freytown,2015-05-20 03:25:00,770,Here's a Facebook link to outfitter on Baie du Sud...you decide how far down.https://www.facebook.com/PourvoirieC...type=1&theaterhttps://www.facebook.com/PourvoirieC...type=3&theater
3887897,octanehi5,2015-05-20 04:20:00,1104,If the grass line in the second picture is the high water mark its 5+' low
3890505,whitewatersalvo,2015-05-20 18:30:00,11,"Hey guys, we were fishing in East Saraana Bay, The outfitter that took us out there said it was about 3 feet, but based on the marks on the shore for high water it looked more like 4 feet. Could have been 5, but it didn't look like it, all the back bays were accessible. Anyways that's what I found. We were there after some good rains on the 12th and 13th, so maybe that helped. Tight lines everyone, and be safe on the water."
3896473,Freytown,2015-05-22 13:12:00,770,I was hoping more early birds would report back by now. It's been a week.
3896505,octanehi5,2015-05-22 13:18:00,1104,"Do not worrie Frytown, Talked to Elaine, Waters cold and farely high. The groups are catching fish. Plenty of water for your trip"
3897946,Freytown,2015-05-23 05:03:00,770,"Waters cold, yes. ""farely high"" huh??? not on the Gouin."
3899482,canyon,2015-05-23 19:37:00,37,We will know tomorrow?. We start our trip so when we come out on the 2nd I will post an update on the levels.
3900714,tshea,2015-05-24 10:18:00,36,Just returned from 9 days at Gouin - Mattawa Bay - water went up possibly 2 inches in that time. I would say water level is about 5-6 feet below high water mark and 2-3 feet lower than last fall. All the nasty mine field bays are still accessible but go slow.
3901122,Freytown,2015-05-24 14:19:00,770,Thxs for the update. Down 6ft is not bad at all. Some passages will be blocked but overall fishing should be good. FT
3911962,a3dad,2015-05-28 06:12:00,115,Spoke to Eliane at AT yesterday and she said it's less than six feet down but didn't say how much less! Any other reports? I'm heading up on Saturday.
3875394,octanehi5,2015-05-16 05:48:00,1104,"Right Freytown, A good fisherman will find the fish, electronics are very helpful. I fished in an era when we did not have Fishfinders, Walleyes will be walleyes no matter were you fish, Structure, wind direction,water temps ,amount of light all play into it."
3875434,Freytown,2015-05-16 05:51:00,770,"Ron, when I began fishing the Gouin, our fishfinder was the anchor rope, ha, ha. I don't want to go back to that."
3875442,Guest,2015-05-16 05:54:00,0,"I don't know if you guys can find similar data for the gouin, I looked quickly but couldn't. http://ottawariver.ca/reservoir-levels-discharges.php this link shows the water levels for the Ottawa river and associated reservoirs. What it is showing is that all the different water bodies are within normal range if not slightly towards the upper end of the range. I don't know why the Gouin would be any different. Same basic area, same winter, same spring etc. This link is updated daily, probably reasonable to monitor it and if it is rising here, it's likely to be rising in the Gouin as well."
3875466,Freytown,2015-05-16 05:59:00,770,Dozois is 3 meters / 9ft below capacity. Baskatong is 5 meters / 15ft below capacity
3875810,octanehi5,2015-05-16 07:50:00,1104,"The differance is the gouin is constantly used to make most of the power in Quebec, millions of gallons a day, I have seen the gouin lose over 2""of water in a day.givin the area it covers thats alot of water. major reasone it was built."
3876090,Freytown,2015-05-16 10:55:00,770,"The main reason that these reservoirs were built was to produce electricity sport fishing, hunting and boating are all ancillary benefits of the reservoirs. I think sometimes we sportsmen (me too) think the #1 reason was for recreation .wrong. Just plan accordingly and I do hope no one is high & dry like in 2003. Good fishing. FT"
3884441,whitewatersalvo,2015-05-18 23:07:00,11,"Just got back water level was roughly 3-4 feet lower than full capacity. Fishing was good, lots of fish, couldn't find many monsters though."
3884473,Freytown,2015-05-19 04:02:00,770,Thxs for the report. I'm puzzled as 8-10ft below was told to me by an outfitter.
3884497,octanehi5,2015-05-19 04:41:00,1104,"Thats not bad at all, It will be good level well into june"
3884793,sbe2,2015-05-19 06:17:00,63,"Whew, what a relief, there is still fishability with those water levels. What part of the Gouin were you fishing salvo?"
3870697,Freytown,2015-05-14 15:25:00,770,"In the spring of 2003, the Gouin was down 20ft...I was there. Many baie's were connected by small rivers or bone dry. Down 8-10 feet has happened many times. I've fished the reservoir since 1980 and have see very low and very high water. Believe it."
3870785,Freytown,2015-05-14 15:54:00,770,"https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ad.php?t=71805""Early indications are that this year is possibly the worst low water deal in seventy years. You may have to haul your boat over sand bars in some parts. I'm not sure about the pass out to Lac Du Male but the charts seem to indicate some real shallow water and maybe a blockage."""
3871033,sbe2,2015-05-14 18:11:00,63,All I can hope for is that the water rises in a month
3871129,fishron,2015-05-14 18:36:00,317,The situation on the Gouin reminds me of what caused my group to abandon our trips to Cabonga. We had established areas and methods of fishing them that really paid off for us. When the water level was dropped it wiped out our traditional spots and put us into a search mode. We still caught fish once we had made the adjustment but never in the numbers we had before. The camp owners reasoning was the fish are more concentrated. The reality was they were much harder to find. Good luck to the groups fishing Gouin. It may be a totally different situation on that body of water.
3873625,octanehi5,2015-05-15 13:03:00,1104,"this last yrs snow levels were very low next to normal, Starting out low already ,and with as much water they use to make power.It may be a little challenge to find them. The most I have ever seen Hebert in 11yrs. it was 2 feet low one yr.Its a spring fed lake. Good luck on the Gouin"
3874793,canyon,2015-05-15 20:06:00,37,8 to 10 feet below max level. Last year's water level was about 6 to 8 feet below max if memory serves me right. Don't worry too much.
3875266,octanehi5,2015-05-16 04:33:00,1104,"2' on the Gouin,The lake is the size of a small state, It will impact your fishing. This yrs ice out was earlier than last yr with less snow, means low water to start with,Has not had alot of rain. it will not recover untill they get alot of rain. They produce hydoelectric power 24-7 from the gouin always a stead flow"
3875298,sbe2,2015-05-16 04:54:00,63,"Last year on the west end the water seemed extra high. A well known rock in our group was under two feet of water. Three years ago it was a foot above water, with the water mark exposed a foot in the back bays. It's all a crap shoot to me, until we hopefully get reports back this week."
3875362,Freytown,2015-05-16 05:34:00,770,"Reservoir pool level is down 4-5ft from this time last year. Fishing will be fine, I always did better with lower levels. Problems will be with navigating...some passages will be blocked. Ron's right about the lower snow & spring rains. This happens all the time on the Gouin...just adapt to the changes. Electronics, electronics, electronics!"
3875370,Freytown,2015-05-16 05:38:00,770,Not last year...but the spring of 2013 the Gouin was at capacity. Flooding on the St Lawerance near Montreal cause a stoppage in water releases though out the watershed.
3855513,Freytown,2015-05-10 05:59:00,770,"The water levels on the Gouin are presently about 8-10 feet below full capacity. Just a ""FYI"" for those heading out early...plan accordingly. It takes a long time to raise the levels...let's hope for a lot of rain or some area's will be blocked. Good luck."
3858473,Freytown,2015-05-11 04:31:00,770,Topo maps will be very deceiving. Many islands will be connected to the shore line. Newbie's should carry a compass or GPS as getting lost is a real possibility if traveling far.
3858521,canyon,2015-05-11 05:12:00,37,That's a great point. We have been going up there for 6 years now and last year was the first time we had to use the gps. It got foggy(which seems to be rare there) and navigating by line of site was not an option. Glad the gps was in the bag! Newbies beware as object on the map are not always as they appear...lol
3858849,Freytown,2015-05-11 07:13:00,770,I got caught in that fog last year too. Outfitter got worried because I was alone. The ole Boy scout compass worked just fine....and a very slow speed all the way back.
3859041,sbe2,2015-05-11 07:53:00,63,"O boy, this is not the ice out report I was looking for. Our group loves getting into those back bays!Looks like I have to dust off my rain dance suit."
3864761,Freytown,2015-05-12 15:27:00,770,Ttt
3868601,tshea,2015-05-14 06:35:00,36,Any update on water levels ? I am heading up to mattawa bay tomorrow morning Outfitters must be pissed. Thanks Todd.
3868609,sbe2,2015-05-14 06:36:00,63,"If anyone is going to the Gouin for the opener, a report on water level and conditions would be much appreciated!"
3869937,vteye,2015-05-14 11:59:00,812,"We stayed at Barrage du Gouin outpost camp about 25 miles from the dam. We found a fellow who had been lost overnight. He had not eaten, bitten up by bugs, slept on a small island miserable. Gouinis big and easy to get turned around."
3870665,hugepike0,2015-05-14 15:15:00,28,I dont understand how the water can be down 8-10 feet - I was at a camp on gouin last year and if the water was down that much the camp area and everything within 1/2mile would be bone dry?
