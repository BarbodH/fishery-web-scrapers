Steve"
1061758,Backwater Eddy,2008-10-23 05:14:00,3871,Good hunt'n Reno. Catch a piggy for me too while your at it.
1062297,Reno,2008-10-27 08:06:00,330,"Well, went up thurs, fished Friday in beautiful weather, Sat a few rain drops, wind picked up in afternoon, Sunday didn't even go out, it was very windy and rainy. Now for the fishing, Burr caught a 27""er on Friday cranking, managed a few 22""ers throughout the day, nothing significant on jigs...Sat- nothing cranking, but did ok on jigs mostly fat 22""ers...Sunday was a bust, even the tournament was cancelled. Even though we didn't catch any trophies, had a great time! Steve"
1062476,Burr,2008-10-28 08:19:00,8612,"Backwater, the challenge has been set, when we were at the Falls last week. Stapon is organizing an ice trip the last week of March on Lake Winnipeg. Canada vs USA, FMWU vs WAM, Lund CA vs Lund US.Pigs on ice, ooooolllly moooooolllllly, eh?!Probably even a Hold em game or two. They promised to teach me how to play Hold em. shhhhh......"

1062658,Guest,2008-10-29 13:22:00,0,yep the challenge is on! Lake Winnipeg monsters in march...will be good to get u all up here! we have some pretty hot sticks line up so bring your best!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1062677,Burr,2008-10-29 15:44:00,8612,"lol, that's funny. We know each other here, and we probably know each other at the falls, but we haven't connected the two yet! I think I'm gonna dress up like a canadian so I can be on the winning team. Gotta get used to saying eh, and dropping the huh?'Eh's' better than 'huh' anyhows!Craig, look out, I'm stocking up on the five o diamonds jigging spoons!"
1062702,manitobawalleye,2008-10-29 19:32:00,885,rew is suppose to come up in march as well.... i haven't told him the 5 of diamonds story yet....
1062727,fishncamp,2008-10-29 22:09:00,49,I'll be there with my WAAM hat on too......piggy's on ice! Yahoo!
1062978,Backwater Eddy,2008-11-01 04:42:00,3871,"I'll be there in March, at least once...likely twice. You will have to keep me in the loop on the details of when your crew is set to go and if you plan to stay in Selkirk...ect.I will be on the Red first ice for sure too this year. Big sumo eyes on the Red Eh. Should see ice safe enough to run on sometime around X-mass +/-.Stock up on them #6 Salmo Chubby's in LOD and GMO, and #5 Chubbys in LBD (the Luminescent Blue Dace is a Gander Exclusive color I designed for GM), the Glow Red (CSI/Cabea's/Scheel's color), Firetiger, and some jigs from Patterson's Reel Bait...like the Plain Jain, Cherry Bom, Super Man, Glow Tiger, Lytle's Secret Tail Spinner in Glow Tiger 3/4 oz/ 1 1/2, plus some Reel Bait Red Tail Transparent Series Flasher Jigs in Penguin, and especially Cherry Bom. I recommend an extra box or two of Triple Grip Treble hooks to swap out jig hooks, go 1 size larger than original equipment as they hold heavy eyes better when rigged barbless. Be sure to bring your Vexilar!"
1060255,Hawgeye,2008-10-13 18:42:00,1355,"How did the weekend of the 11th and 12th for Pine Falls? Also, is there a tourney on the weekend of the 25th? I'd like to give it a better shot than my last trip and was hoping things have been improving. I welcome the posts."
1060300,mrwalleye5,2008-10-14 06:26:00,1922,Sounds like the bite is picking up considerably. 63 lbs won the tounament this past weekend. Fishing the lake was the ticket. Water temp is around 50 F. W5
1060440,Backwater Eddy,2008-10-15 04:09:00,3871,"Well the Headwaters and Central Red River basin got heavy-heavy rains all last weekend, and the Red is out of it's banks with the tribs running full and strong yet. So expect a significant increase in flow as well as turbidity in the days to come to the North.How well the river handles it is yet to be seen. Temperature will make a big effect of how quickly the water clears after the main flow slips on bye. The higher water does not concern be as much as the color of the water.http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nd/nwis/rt"
1061064,Hawgeye,2008-10-18 23:41:00,1355,"Whats the latest? Is the bay producing any excitement? Want to go the weekend of the 25th and want to know if any fish are being caught. For some reason, Papertown's website is no longer valid so I cannot get any communication with Laurent....any news! Thanks Mike"
1061082,Reno,2008-10-19 07:33:00,330,"Hi Mike, Burr and I will be up there that weekend...hope to hook up with ya if you go! We will be leaving thurs am from Fargo along with another buddy...staying at the hotel. Looking to catch a monster greenback! Steve"
1061116,Guest,2008-10-19 10:55:00,0,Just returned from pine falls and the morning fishing was great.We caught all the 22 inch plus eyes we wanted pulling raps.
1061153,otis,2008-10-19 17:12:00,20,"Leaving in the morning for Pine Falls,first time there and could use a little help. Tyjohnny what worked best for you guys,baits,locations,depths any help would be very appreciated."
1061165,Reno,2008-10-19 17:56:00,330,"Will chime in here, pulling cranks in the bay, #7,8 or 9's, just remember that the lure should be bouncing on the bottom, either side of the river channel, if you jig, we have found anchoring along the river channel in the bay productive, having jig aprox 6"" off the bottom, and motionless. salted minnows will do the trick. In the river you will need to adjust jig weight by the current. Bottom bouncing can also be productive. A good anchor or anchors is a must. Have a Great Trip, we will be up there thurs pm.. Steve"
1061224,mrwalleye5,2008-10-20 06:32:00,1922,"I was there this past thursday,friday and sunday. Not near the fish population as last year. This year it's called fishing instead of ""catching"" like last year. I've pulled cranks, drifted and anchored. All work equally as good but at different times of the day. Reno in the previous post nailed it right on. I managed a 30"",25"", 24"" and then a number of 19,20, 21""s. Not a large number but your not sleeping in the boat. W5"

1058092,Novo10,2008-09-30 14:58:00,10,"I was out there on monday Oct 29,fishing was slow tried a variety of spots,and presentations.Started off fishing the deeper spots in the river.(forgot to say I was fishing the Red).Then I remembered 2 years ago,the walleye were tighter to shore(5to8ft of water)so we went shallower,8ft and started nailing the eyes.No real giants to speak of but my buddy landed a fat 26"" most of the fish were in the 21 to 24"" range.We ended up with 12 nice fat walleye,all went back to fight another day.I think it is still to early,not cold enough yet water temp was 57 degrees.Heading back to the launch we tried trolling with shad raps and reef runners,nothing to speak of.Like I said still a bit to early,give it 2 more weeks and the big girls should be in the river.Thight Lines Novo10."
1058171,Hawgeye,2008-09-30 22:04:00,1355,"I will be fishing Traverse this weekend through Monday. I'll give a report when I get back. I am more confident then the reports reflect only because we have had success at this time of year many years when reports have been poor. Of course, I am happy with 20 fish a day in the 18-24 inch range. Looks like the forecast is for pretty nice weather and I'll take that. Flows should still be high on the Winnipeg I hope which is usually good. Who knows...need to be optimistic to catch fish, right? Hawgeye"
1058236,mrwalleye5,2008-10-01 06:23:00,1922,"Hawgeye I fished Traverse Sept 21. Three green backs (up to 20"") lots of resident walleye. I was talking to a gentleman that is a local from Pine Falls couple nights ago and told him of my previous trip and he said that the fishing has picked up considerably. Some 10's and 12's being caught. Don't know if these are coming out of the bay or the river. I prefer the bay if the wind allows. River flow is down significantly from a while back, floats the boat at about 1.5 mph, would prefer to see it at double that. Good Luck W5"
1058354,Guest,2008-10-01 15:25:00,0,"My info was that there was 101 boats saturday, stu won with 4.7# roughly. On day 2, only 40 boats roughly. Water was 62 this past weekend. Sounds like what happened is that the locks were opened last week and that's the issue on the Red. The good thing for those going up later is they won't be opened the week of the 13 per norm roughly. Sounded like some big north winds. Those winds will help if they keep up. Best week of the year for me is there. Can't wait. Bring on the Kokanee's, Entertainment and Big Gurls. (By big gurls I mean pickerel, er greenbacks, aka walleye white or green). By entertainment I mean. Well, nothing I can say here"
1058373,sasai,2008-10-01 16:37:00,8,"Your info was a bit off. The derby on Saturday had 103 boats, a lady won with a 9lber (not stu). I can't remember the exact number of people to weigh in fish on Saturday, but it was not a lot that's for sure. Sunday had 30 boats, 4 of which weighed in a total of 8 fish (we were one of those 4 to weigh in fish on Sunday).Temp on Sunday actually dropped a little bit, especially up north by Netley. We were seeing 58.5F that day, so its definitely dropping."
1058810,Reno,2008-10-04 09:12:00,330,Sent you a PM...
1058867,Backwater Eddy,2008-10-04 19:15:00,3871,"Reno drop me a note in my box on your outing if you would please.Thanks,Eddy"
1059116,Guest,2008-10-06 12:32:00,0,"Have been fishing almost daily for the past 3 weeks and the greenbacks are in along with many many river wallys and sauger up to the powerview dam, lots of huge drum which are always arrive before the greenbacks, water temp is now 59 degs in the river and 60 on the bay and they are hitting the cranks aggresively on the bay, lots of fish in the 2 to 8 lb class but we haven,t stuck a big one yet. They stopped dumping water friday before last, 1st time since spring and we a good 2 day norwester that always seems to bring them in."
1059156,jhoeke,2008-10-06 16:53:00,23,"Just got back Sunday. No size yet. Best fish was 27"" lots of 20 to 24's. Water is about 57 in the Red and 59 around Pine Falls. Did catch a 46"" sturgeon and lots of big drum. Fishing should continue to pick us as the water temps drop."
1059786,Backwater Eddy,2008-10-10 06:12:00,3871,Sounds like things are starting to pick up. Temps are dropping but wet weather and cool is headed in.If the rains do not muddy it up too bad next week should be interesting.
1057174,lund115,2008-09-24 16:49:00,698,"Both produce huge greenbacks. The biggest deciding factor is what size of boat you fish in. Pine Falls you are in the bay where a 15 mph wind out of the North creates 3-4 foot waves, and 20+ winds you can't fish the bay. On the Red you will have more company around you. There are not to many days you can't fish the Red. There are just a lot more boats to compete with on the Red. Personally I like Pine Falls, beacuse I'm more by myself, but the last few years I've gone to the Red, for fuel costs. The drive out to the bay at Pine Falls is 7 miles one way by boat."
1057288,Guest,2008-09-25 06:48:00,0,Does anybody make a mapping card for this area?
1057562,lund115,2008-09-26 16:15:00,698,They do not have one for either the Red River or Traverse Bay.
1057568,Backwater Eddy,2008-09-26 16:53:00,3871,"I have been pestering Lakemaster ans Navionics to get a data card for the Winnipeg River and the Red but no luck so far. The more requests they get the more likely they will do it is the feedback I keep getting.....so everyone interested in the chip should drop them a request, or two, so they get on it."
1057820,sasai,2008-09-28 19:46:00,8,"Just as an update - fishing for both the derby on Saturday and tournament on Sunday was POOR. The water's too warm, so the fish simply are not in the water quite yet. Out of 30 boats in the tournament, 4 managed to weigh in walleye (the other 26 didn't catch any). Very tough day fishing."
1057836,Guest,2008-09-28 20:35:00,0,Was the Derby on the Red or at Pine Falls?
1057840,red_river_fisher,2008-09-28 20:44:00,24,"Derby was on the Red. Pine Falls is starting to pick up caught 9 walleyes today, 2 at 23.5 inches and one at 21 inches the rest were about 18 inches and alot of realy small ones. Way better than the Red the last couple of days."
1057843,TKwalleye,2008-09-28 21:15:00,2,"Will another week make a difference? We are heading up in a week and fish Monday through Saturday. Forcast looks like nice weather which probably means lousy fishing. Wish we could push it back another week, but not possible. Maybe driving up to Pine Falls every day would be more productive. What do ya think?"
1057884,Backwater Eddy,2008-09-29 07:31:00,3871,"Are the results from last weekends walleye tournament posted anywhere? If so can somebody please post a link or the info. The water is plenty colored yet, and it is near 59 in temp, so yes I also feel it is a bit early for a run in the Red.Thanks,"
1057922,Roger Benoit,2008-09-29 10:57:00,93,"I was out on Saturday on the Red. The river is very silty.. Too much like chocolate milk. Almost looks like they are doing a draw down. Lots of garbage and debris floating in the river. On a normal year, during draw down, the fishing comes to an abrupt halt. Its not to say that the fish aren't there. They are just not very active. Water temperature on saturday was 61.8degrees. I fished from the miracle mile all the way to the cut by netly lake. Same results all the way up and down the river. From what I've read on other sites, from Saturday's derby, 110 boats, 9 walleyes weighed in with the biggest being 9 pounds. Still early, 2 weeks i'd say... then we should be ROCKIN!"
1054387,Guest,2008-09-10 12:32:00,0,"Can anyone provide any insight to the walleye fishing at these two sites, either around the Lockport area and at Pine Falls? Thanks in advance."
1054459,prov1900,2008-09-10 18:59:00,544,"There was an extensive thread about this recently. Bottom line, either direction you go, i.e. PF or Lockport, you will be happy. Call for updates on the run...Cats on the Red, or the other place...can't remember the name of it."
1054478,Backwater Eddy,2008-09-10 21:24:00,3871,"I just returned from the Red up North (Fishing sumo catfish), and so far no Greenback showing up yet in any numbers in the river. Best guess..2-3 weeks depending on the weather before you start to get some numbers in the lower end of the Red.Check in with Stu McKay at ""Cats on the Red"" for Red River info, or the Papertown Inn at Pine Falls for Winnipeg River info and reports."
1054664,sasai,2008-09-11 19:47:00,8,"A couple smaller greenbacks are being caught here and there, nothing in numbers whatsoever yet. Give it another couple weeks for it to cool down and for them to move in.x2 on checking with Stu"
1056490,Guest,2008-09-21 08:38:00,0,Can you use live bait on these rivers? Any good places to stay?
1056496,fishncamp,2008-09-21 09:18:00,49,Selkirk and Pine Falls have some accomadations.....many prefer to stay in Winnipeg and trailer to the launch. Selkirk less than 1/2 hour drive and PF just over an hour. No problem using live minnows. As mentioned earlier wait a couple more weeks with cooler temps and north winds things should heat up. There is a new resort hotel at the South Beach Casino by Scanterbury pretty much right between PF and Selkirk may be a good choice. You should probaly find it with a google search. See you on the water!
1056744,Backwater Eddy,2008-09-22 18:21:00,3871,"Just returned from yet another catfish trip on the Red, cats are going very strong. The water is swift and dark, darker than it should be for right now as well as faster.No Greenbacks to speak of in the river. If they are they are not sight feeding well. Talked to many locals and the bite is not at all on the go yet.The tournament this weekend should be a tough go but who finds the fish will place high."
1057011,Guest,2008-09-23 21:49:00,0,for a simpleton american what is a greenback? Is cash t me. Just want to know so I don't feel stupid
1057044,Backwater Eddy,2008-09-24 06:35:00,3871,"""Greenback"" is the nickname given to the Lake Run walleyes that frequent the Red River, Winnipeg Rivers, Lake Winnipeg, and other various associated rivers of the Lake Winnipeg basin system.Due to the iridescent coloration gained by the walleye out in the lake, due to limestone dissolved in the waters of the big lake, they gain a very unique and gorgeous coloration. Hence the nickname...Greenback.Hope this helps."
1057048,mrwalleye5,2008-09-24 06:45:00,1922,"Greenbacks are Lake Winnipeg walleye. I may be wrong but the walleye take on a emerald green colour by living in the north basin of the lake for the summer. The north basin has a primarly limestone bottom and the water is a turqouis (spelling) colour, thus the fish take on the colour of their surroundings. The walleye migrate up to 200 miles from the noth basin to the south basin in the fall. They follow the forage base and come into the bays and rivers in large numbers. Some years are better then others, all depends on river flows and the forage. These fish have been feeding like pigs all summer and are heavy weights. 30"" fish are common. Last year was the best year I have seen for fish numbers although large fish were a little scarce. Maybe it was becasue the smaller fish wouldn't give the larger fish an opportunity to bite. Noraml day last year was 50 -70 fish a day of 20 t0 25 inch fish. The 20-21 "" fish would consistantly weight 4.5 to 5lbs. Little head and big thick bodies.. Hope this answers your question. W5"
