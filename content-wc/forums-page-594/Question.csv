Ontario Fishing License and Border Crossing Permit on line, didn't want to have to cross over into Canada just to get these??? Thanks"

The reason for this is they will want to have a copy of a U.S. government issued photo i.d. such as a drivers license or passport. Ours took about three weeks to process this past June. The permits are good for a year.NimstugOutside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog, it is too dark to read.-G. Marx"
