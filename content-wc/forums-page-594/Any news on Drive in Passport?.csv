1064911,Guest,2008-11-18 12:38:00,0,"June 1, 2009 is the hard date. Check into getting the passport card if you are only going to be driving in and out of the country. You can get the passport card for a lot less money and it will let you come back in to the USA via land crossing."
1064965,Guest,2008-11-18 18:45:00,0,need help how to get one and where
1064969,rather-be-fishin,2008-11-18 18:58:00,429,Go to your local post office.
1064970,Jimmy Jig,2008-11-18 19:09:00,1905,I think it starts at the County Recorders Office.
1064989,joeman79,2008-11-18 20:36:00,417,"Our County Courthouse quit doing passports last year. I am in Kansas, but any decent sized U.S. Post Office you can have it all done in a few minutes if you have your application filled out, your Birth Cert. and Drivers License and Passport photo 1X1 I believe. Ours only took 3 weeks to get back last spring."
1064990,bpetersen,2008-11-18 20:50:00,251,"Call you local post office to see if they do passports. Not all post offices do this. Also, ask if they take pictures, my post office does."
1064997,Hawkfan,2008-11-18 21:46:00,237,"This website has all the info you'd need. You can search where the closest site is and if they do pictures or not. Probably less expensive to go to a Walgreens, etc. and have them do the photo.http://travel.state.gov/passport/passport_1738.html"
1065011,Backwater Eddy,2008-11-19 06:43:00,3871,"Thanks for the update guys. I best stop dragging my feet and get it done before May so I have it by June 1, 2009. (I see they say 4 weeks even for the card)Post offices have been doing Passport Days where if you have your documentation complete and ready it is a streamlined one stop affair. It still takes 4 weeks as I understand it to get it back, but you get everything done quickly. I'll have to check and see when they plan another passport blitz near me at the local Post Office and get it done.Thanks,"
1065025,lenray,2008-11-19 07:50:00,467,GETERDONE Eddy Me and momma got the passport card at our local post office. It took 5 months for ours to get back to us. Thinking it is much quicker if done now. We did ours last fall when it was first coming out--before they started printing them. Fishing nord of Pickle Lake Ont.
