1063749,Ruddiger,2008-11-08 11:50:00,649,"Howdy, I would like to get some information on the fishing opportunities in Georgian Bay, specifically in the delta areas of the French, Key and Pickerel river regions. I would like to know about pike, walleye, muskie, and smallmouth opportunities from early May until late October. Some of my questions include: How pressured is the water? How is the fishing on a month by month basis for each species? Do the fish go so deep in the summer that it is a waste of time casting? Is it more of a casting or trolling type of fishery? Is there much weed growth or is it all rock fishing? Is it a true wilderness setting? Can you explore into areas that see little to no pressure? What is the potential for numbers of fish? What is the potential for trophy fish? How dangerous are the boating conditions? Are there any reputable lodges in the area that you would recommend? Would you take your own boat there? How does the fishing compare to other areas in Ontario? I know that this is a lot to ask, but any information you can offer would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance, Ruddiger"
1063758,rebs,2008-11-08 14:10:00,7587,"all I can say is I went there about 20 years ago and stayed at Moose Dear Lodge which was located on an island about 23 miles from the launch. It was a great time with plenty of northern pike, bass, crappy and muskie we fished rock, weeds and fallen timber, just about any type fishing you want to do can be done there we stayed a week and had a blast, it was in July I believe"
1063846,Lucky Eddy,2008-11-09 18:06:00,39,"We stayed at Diamond Key resort for about fifteen years. Always in early June when the walleye are moving back down the channels toward the bay after spawning. We would have ten to fifteen guys in our group. Fishing was always good and the stories told during the week were just great. Dave and Maggie run the camp and are just great people to stay with. Also their camp is seven miles down the Key River just to the left when you reach the bay. Being out on the bay there are no black flies to worry about. You can use my name [John Eddy] if you want, but it will get you no special favors as everyone is treated the same. This is their site. http://www.diamondkeylodge.com/"
1064124,10lbeye,2008-11-11 21:46:00,61,"Ruddinger: I've fished geo bay for 35 years now. We stay at georgian bay fishing camp, which is an 18 mi boat ride from the marina at Britt. Very secluded. I'll try to answer your questions as follows: How pressured is the water? Not very at all. So many bays and points that it never gets crowded. How is the fishing on a month by month basis for each species? May, June, and early to mid July are best for pike, walleyes, and smallies. The length of the season depends upon how cool or hot the spring/early summer is. Do the fish go so deep in the summer that it is a waste of time casting? I usually go in June and the fish are shallow--5 to 25 ft. Is it more of a casting or trolling type of fishery? Drifting with jigs and bait rigs works best for me, though trolling rapalas works well too Is there much weed growth or is it all rock fishing? Mostly rock and structure, though the shallow bays are weedy. Is it a true wilderness setting? Yes-fantastically beautiful Can you explore into areas that see little to no pressure? Most definitely. What is the potential for numbers of fish? Mostly, it's a place for huge fish. In certain years we have run into good numbers, but more often than not, we get size over numbers. It can be a tough place to fish if you're not familiar w/ the water. What is the potential for trophy fish? Chances are, somebody in your group will land a 10 lb eye or a 20 lb class pike. we always manage a 4-5 lb smallie too by accident. How dangerous are the boating conditions? Can be VERY dangerous. Lots and lots of rocks and shoals. Polarized glasses are a MUST. Are there any reputable lodges in the area that you would recommend? I would recommend GBFC (www.georgianbayfishing.com). It's rustic, but reasonably priced and it has what we're looking for. I've gone there so many years that I know what I need(and don't need much) Would you take your own boat there? Many people do, but I don't. The camp has 18 ft boats w/ 10 hp motors and they do the trick. It's a long ride (18 mi) if you go out of Britt and a few mi less if you go via the Key River. Most people who bring their own boats use the Key .A much straighter shot. IF you use camp boats the owner will pick you up and bring you back. Approx a 35 min ride. How does the fishing compare to other areas in Ontario? Don't go there expecting big numbers. Like I said, we have had yrs of good numbers, but we've learned to trade numbers for size. Last few yrs we've caught lots of small fish, which leads me to believe the last few years had a good hatch. I'll be happy to answer any more questions you have"
1064147,Ruddiger,2008-11-12 07:47:00,649,"10lbeye, Thank you for the reply. You replied to a similar question I posted last year as well. I will try to send you a PM so that we can talk in greater detail. I have some additional questions that I would like to ask. When you say low numbers, specifically, how low? I spend a lot of time fishing muskies in the summer and don't mind going hours without a fish. Usually, in the course of a week, I catch 6-10 muskies in the mid 30-mid 40 inch class. This is usually supplemeted with the occasional walleye or bass to keep me interested. My point is that if I went to the Bay and targeted pike and muskie, could I produce similar results? By similar results I mean pike and muskie combined (ie 6-10 good fish in aggregate, not 6-10 muskies as I know their numbers are much lower on the Bay)? As far as the seasons go I would like to go in May, July, August, September & October. Do you have any experience with August and beyond? I try to stretch out the season as much as possible and have historically done well in the later months but, again, on different water. As far as boating conditions go, is GPS mapping software available for that area? If so does it make exploration possible without sinking your boat (common sense and seamanship applies of course)? What are the paper charts/maps like? Aside from changing water levels are they acurate and reliable? How close is the nearest house, cottage, or resort to GBFC? If I go exploring how far do you have to go to find really unpressured areas? I am mostly a weed fisherman. Even on fly-in lakes I have done best in weed areas. I am a bit concerned that the Bay, and its endless rocks and deep water options, will make fishing weeds really tough as the season progresses. I am also worried that there wont be that many areas to fish in that rocky environment. Is this the case? As far as the fishing goes, do you fish mostly in protected bays, the rivers, or in the Bay itself? Do you mostly cast or troll for pike and muskies? I ask this because I love casting and hate trolling unless I HAVE to do it. Are there any panfishing opportunities for an easy lunch or to provide a refresher of quick action? If I bring my own boat, is the docking protected and are there places I can plug in a battery charger? By seeing more small fish, how small are you talking about? I know that the reports on the area have been poor on this site. I am a bit concerned with it's fished out reputaion. How well deserved is that rap? I appreciate any additonal information you can provide. Thanks, Ruddiger"
1065292,Guest,2008-11-20 20:56:00,0,"Ruddiger: I too have been to Diamond Key....also been a while now. Dave and Maggie actually sold the place from what I understand, but are staying on to run it for the new owners. I've been going up in May since the mid 70's with my father's group, and now my own. We have spent the majority of the trips the last 10 years at the French River Lodge in the lower river, which has limited access to the bay itself. Pike fishing can be very good at that time of year, not a lot of big guys but plenty in the 15-22"" range. Diamond Key was quite a bit different. A lot less weeds for the most part, and LOTS more shoals than the river. We found we did not get as many fish, but what we did get was generally bigger. We had several over 20lbs the one time. John"
