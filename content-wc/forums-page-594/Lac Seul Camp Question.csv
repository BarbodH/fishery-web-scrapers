I've been going to Lac Seul for the past 5 years and would like to know if anyone has experienced Evergreen Lodge, in Ear Falls. We have been staying at outposts on the east side of the lake, but the economy has me searching for something a bit more affordable. Any help with lodges would be greatly appreciated.Is there any difference in fishing success, walleye, pike, and smallies, from the east side to the NW side of lake? https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...c/progress.gif"

Location to conveniences(town) are great, cabins are clean and nice. wireless, internet, top-notch fish cleaning. The boats are outstanding. Bait, ice all provided. I personally don't think you can go wrong. Feel free to e-mail with questions. [email protected]"
1064915,Guest,2008-11-18 13:14:00,0,"Wife and I have fished LS 13 weeks in the past 12 years. We've stayed 7 times at Evergreen and 6 times at Whitewing. Don't think you could go wrong at either camp. Both are modern, clean, friendly and very well maintained. We fish the NW and SW sections of LS and never leave disappointed. Have never fished the NE or SE so I have nothing to compare. Good luck!"
1064943,2746,2008-11-18 16:38:00,3206,Have never stayed at Evergreen but Pat and Gary post here and I have heard nothing but good things about the camp. I have fished LS a number of times but always out of Lac Seul Lodge which is about 20 miles south of Ear Falls and Evergreen. Dan does an excellent job also and we like the camp. Fishing that side of the Lake has been outstanding. A little further north is Gullrock which also has excellent fishing and some very affordable camps. It's a smaller lake but with fishing that has been as good for us as LS.

1066149,Steve of Madison,2008-11-26 18:35:00,230,"I have stayed at Onaway Lodge on lac Seul for the last 8 years, Blair and kathy are great hosts, the cabins are full housekeeping, clean and comfortable, and the boats and docking facilities are second to none (Lund Outfitters w/ Honda 50 hp 4 strokes, tilt and trim and electronics). The nice thing about Onaway is it's relationship with the best spots on the Northwest section of the lake. No long boat ride to McKenzie from the far north end!!! Plus South islet, Manitoba pt, and all the spots along the way are within an easy boat ride. Onaway phone number is 1-888-662-9291 and the have a website, just search Lac Suel Onaway Lodge."
1066305,JDP,2008-11-28 08:59:00,1457,"I have been fishing Lac Seul for over 20 years. The top 3 resorts for me on the west side are (in no particular order): Evergreen Lodge - great resort, awesome people, location close to the town of Ear Falls that may be a plus to some or less desireable to others. Onaway Lodge - great resort, solid people, equipment, nice location as mentioned for fishing the more central portion of the lake. Fisherman's Cove - great resort,facilities, boats, motors, owners work extremely hard to please and run a resort with impeccable dock service. Location is very close to Onaway - outstanding. Other very good resorts; potenetially even better for certain people depending upon personal taste are Lac Seul Lodge and White Wing Lodge.
