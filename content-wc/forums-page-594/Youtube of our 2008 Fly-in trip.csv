1064458,Lovetofish,2008-11-14 08:51:00,458,Nice job and thanks for sharing.
1064484,Moondog,2008-11-14 11:43:00,362,Great video.......my mouth is watering. What was that tune?
1064533,1shooter,2008-11-14 18:25:00,1493,Liked it! I make it up past the border twice a year and wish I could do more. If you ever get in jam for a fill in let me know. I could show you how you really clean fish and you could throw that electric knife away.
1065625,Guest,2008-11-24 04:43:00,0,joe man - you always been with the beer police?
1065669,joeman79,2008-11-24 10:11:00,417,"Let me tell you about beer on our last fly-in. I or We were so jacked up about going. That we FORGOT to buy beer before we got to Northern Wilderness Outfitters. We had everything packed and put in the carts ready to go on the plane and a light came on in my head. WE FORGOT TO BUY BEER!!!!!!!!! I was panicing as we were scheduled to fly out in 20 minutes and we were 10 minutes from town. Thank God they had Labatts Blue there at the office. So we bought 4 cases and put them on the plane. THen another Brain fart when we got up in the air. We forgot the CROWN in the pickup. Maybe it was because we had to many beers the night before. Anyway we did not bring near enough beer, but we managed and survived. I watched the video again and I am ready for summer ""09"""

1065824,SinOrSwim,2008-11-25 03:12:00,1528,"Thanks for the kind remarks. Much appreciated.We had 6 in our group and yes, we might have drinking problems by the time we return. Late nights playing poker.....what can we say. PowerClown: The rapids shots are from the Birch River that comes into the lake right by the North Cabin. We are going to try Root Bay at some point but it hasn't been open the times we've been able to go. 1shooter: LOL very funny on the knife comment. I have tried the other way to clean a fish and let's just say, I'm not horribly successful. This way is much faster and speed has won out. As for the knife, I LOVE that knife. It burns through batteries faster than I'd like but a couple batteries and the 12v charger to hook up to the house battery has worked great. I don't use that knife to do the ribs though. Just the main part.The song was indeed Higher by Creed. Thanks again! Oh wait, another case of beer on the deck to drink..... Is it September yet???????"
1066049,Guest,2008-11-26 07:00:00,0,Do you use the same breading for the onion rings as you do for the fish?
1066199,SinOrSwim,2008-11-27 05:36:00,1528,"No, we use more of a pancake type batter for the onion rings. Pretty much a plain old beer batter. We have tried many different fish batters over the years including the pancake type batter, to shore lunch, andys red, panko etc etc and by far the favorite of the group is Zatarains Seasoned Fish Fri. It's got some spice to it, doesn't soak up oil and can be used wet or dry. We use wet. Mix a box with beer and then use some dry to ""flour"" the fish and then dip. Funny part in that video is we ended up taking the wrong onions that day. We normally use the white/yellow onion rather than the red onion. My brother is the chef of sorts. Some of our included menu items are:Cajun Seafood PastaWalleye Chimis (my personal favorite)Walleye Chowder (not much better on a cold day/night)Baja walleye tacosDifferent types of walleye/seafood pizza(a favorite of mine: predone pizza crust, ranch, top with walleye, diced oninon, bacon bits, tomato and cheese) mmmmmmWe also do one ""steak"" night. We like the strip loin (NY strip) but not in steaks, use a whole loin and grill it or cook it like a prime rib along with fish. That is our surf and turf night.I know that goes a little deeper than your original question but the food gets on my brain when I talk about our trip.We've come along way from the standard fried walleye and potatoes."
1066731,515,2008-12-01 17:20:00,254,Nice work on the video and now I can't wait for next summer. Thanks for posting it.

1064278,dibling,2008-11-13 05:42:00,53,Makes me really want to have a shore lunch. It has been three years not going to Canada. Maybe in 2009! Thanks for sharing this.
