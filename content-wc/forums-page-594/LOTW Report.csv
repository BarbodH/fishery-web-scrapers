Caught plenty of walleye in the usual fall spots. Went as far west as Sabaskosing one day with PJM and his group and did very well on numbers and size. Spent some time trolling the rocky shorelines with 10' Jakes and got a couple low-mid 40s muskies and lost another at the boat. We didn't fish for crappie but heard they were biting at the Elbow and at Hay Island. Spent one day last week trolling around North, Skiff and Fish Islands in Little Traverse. Didn't catch any that day but it was a perfect fall day and we didn't see another boat for hours. That's really a beautiful part of the lake. The aspen and birch were at peak with brilliant yellow colors. Weather was typical for early October. A couple beautiful fall days, a few cold, rainy and overcast days, and one day and night of gale force winds with 3' rollers and white caps in Miles Bay. This was one of the few trips we didn't see any snow, so I guess it was a little warmer than average. I got Bill Krejca's book just before we drove up and brought it with me. Read it on the couch in front of the woodstove on a couple of those cold, rainy mornings when it took a little extra motivation to walk down to the dock. It's a fascinating account of his father's trips to northern Minnesota and LOTW starting in the 1920s. Very interesting reading how the lake was back then and how it's changed, and how it hasn't changed. It's also very touching on a personal level for someone who loves the northwoods fishing experience and cherishes each trip. Possibly back up in three weeks for some late season muskie trolling."

1060436,PJM,2008-10-14 22:48:00,3516,"Rockpt Yes it was a great trip and the weather was outstanding. I hope you had enough minnows to hold you over for a couple of hours and it was nice to see you, Julie and Brutus. The boat was pick up on Monday and they took it to Arkansas and it feels weird not to have it my garage. I will give you a call..........."
1060537,Bill Krejca,2008-10-15 15:30:00,6107,"Rockpt, Looks like you had another good trip. It isn't difficult , considering where you were. It took a long time for the leaves to turn this year, almost felt like August where I was up almost a month ago. Thanks for the kind words on the book; glad you enjoyed it. Be sure to give us another report if you get up there again this fall. My latest seasonal trip was camping the last week in October, which was around 1966. I remember bringing back the same ice in my cooler that I took up at the start of the trip. Bill Krejca"

The fish weren't in there fall patterns yet but we still managed to catch alot of walleyes though but had to sort through the small ones. We also managed to catch 48"" muskie in obabikon. We have been going to LOTW for years but this was the first time we went in th fall. It was our second trip of the year. Needless to say we will now be going twice ayear."
1062867,Guest,2008-10-31 05:38:00,0,"we were staying in miles bay oct 18-25. mostly bluebill hunting which was spotty at best. not many bills this week. fishing was great. lots of walleye, perch and crappie. we saw a wolf pack one day while motoring out of obabikon toward rabbit island. 6 rather healthy looking animals. very cool. unusually warm weather, the water was still over 50 degrees. water is higher than last year. the eagles gave us a run to see who could retrieve our ducks the quickest. we lost a couple in boggy bay. saw an eagle chase a goose and knock it out of the air and then go into the water to try to disable it. last we saw the eagle was in a tree watching the goose in the water. don't know if the goose was dying or what. wasn't sure how the eagle would retrieve a goose from the water to eat it. they can barely fly away with a duck. i don't see the sport in running deer on the islands with dogs and boats. seems like a poor way to hunt to me. i guess it's legal but. lot's of guys do it . moving on to lake st clair for the bills now. they are there and all we need is a little wind. cheers, br"
