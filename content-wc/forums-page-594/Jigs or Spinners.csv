From what I have researched here except for summer of ""08"" sounds like fish will be deep on humps and reefs. My question is what do you have better luck with spinners or jigs or something else. Also with spinners do you do better with bottom bouncers or walking sinkers? Any tips secrets or techniques would be great. Thanks, Joe"

Fish generally hook themselves. A novice with a 3/8 jig = snags For the seasoned fishermen, I would prefer jigs. Better feel for the bottom, and if you know what you are doing, you will definately get more fish. If i am under 20 feet, I like a 1/4 ounce jig and minnow or leach. If I am 20 to 25 feet, I prefer a bigger jig, up to 1/2 ounce. If fish are really on, a jig and Gulp Grub work great. Bring plenty spinners and jigs with you on the water. Some days spinners work better, some days jigs. If you are going to be on the west side of Lac Seul, go to Four Seasons Sporting Goods for your spinners. I prefer to use bead chain sinkers with my spinners. Four Seasons stocks everything you will need and have really nice owners. THey stock these reflecto tape spinners by Klass tackle that work great. Here is the website for Klass. You actually buy them cheaper at Four Seasons then on the website, but here is the site if you are not going to be near Ear Falls.http://www.klasstackle.com/index.php...emart&Itemid=1"
