1062648,2746,2008-10-29 12:10:00,3206,"Exhaust fan!!?? Now that would be uptown livin. What am I going to do with all that pine scented spray we've accumulated over the years? What are we going to razz each other about? No, as I think about it, an exhaust fan might be just to much."
1062688,joeman79,2008-10-29 17:06:00,417,2 bathrooms-2 sinks-2showers- 2 stools- no tubs- 2 exhaust fans they are cheap.
1062707,Pooch,2008-10-29 19:54:00,4619,"One camp we stay at usually has an empty cabin close so some of our guys use it when the one flusher is busy. They still step around the corner to pee sometimes. Like dog's marking their territory... On our last trip of '08 we were in a cabin with two full (but small) three piece bathrooms. That was kind of nice when everyone one headed for the latrine at once! But, not a big deal. If it were an easy add on to a new cabin I'd be tempted to do it if only to make it more appealing to couples or several couples staying together. Good luck. Pooch"
1062712,Golden Eagle,2008-10-29 20:08:00,2642,"Most of my guys don't require indoor plumbing when fishing fishing productive water, but having plenty of bathrooms is a good move from a business viewpoint because it provides the potential to attract more women, which can double the size of some fishing parties."
1063092,Moondog,2008-11-02 09:47:00,362,"If we were looking for a place to take our daughter, s-i-l, and gkids.......we would instantly eliminate a resort that had cabins with only one bathroom. We go to fish, not wait endlessly just to S.S.S. As cheap as it would be upfront to put in even a toilet and sink, I believe it would payoff especially with families of mixed ages and genders."
1062215,Guest,2008-10-26 16:08:00,0,The outhouse is a great idea for overflow. At our cottage in NW Ontario we commonly have more than 10. We have 1 full bathroom and an outside outhouse. It works well.
1062261,Guest,2008-10-26 20:58:00,0,We have 2 big cabins (13 and 16 beds) that we added an extra bathroom to. Our others sleep 6 - 12 with one bathroom. We do have a showerhouse with flush toilets for campers and lots of bush though. BUT - I have a perfectly adequate bathroom at our house in town and the snow is still yellow all winter from my teenage son's friends. To men the world is their bathroom and no offense intended. I'm just jealous!
1062280,2Labs,2008-10-27 06:23:00,685,"8 people?2 bathrooms, each with a stool, sink, and shower. No tub.And, like the prior post says, it is cheaper and easier to do it during construction than to add later.Your guests will thank you!"
1062325,Obabikon,2008-10-27 11:50:00,2370,"Rose, If you and John are disagreeing about it, why not do something like this... put in one bathroom for now, however, set it up so that there's a large closet/small bedroom that could be converted to a bathroom when/if it's decided 2 is needed. 6ft x 5ft is large enough for a bathroom with everything in it. You could make it a walk in closet type so that people could hangup/store all their gear. Anyhow, point is, make sure if you go with one bathroom, you leave yourself the option of a second without too much hassle."
1062404,Guest,2008-10-27 17:51:00,0,"Hi Rose, Love your post dear! We usually travel with 6-8 people and 1 or 2 of those are daughters, spouse or some sort of female of the species. Definitely go with a full for the obvious and 1/2 for those of us that drink adult beverages and pee standing up. Craig"
1062419,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-10-27 19:50:00,116,"I look at the whole thing as more is better, thus 2 bathrooms. However my husband thinks like a guy, you know, the yellow snow, off the back porch, etc. His other comments are like, ""these guys come up fishing, they don't give a crap, [pardon the pun] if there's 2 bathrooms. That's why I was looking for random answers and I thank you for them. Yes this is the bush but if your building from scratch, as Jared said, you only need 5' x 6' and there's your 2nd bath, why not just do it."
1062451,stinkycat,2008-10-28 05:33:00,2018,"Just another thought.... if you are building from scratch deffinently use pex tubing for your water supply lines. Easier to instal...less money than copper... and if it does freeze should not break. We have used pex ""Wirsbo brand"" for at least 7 years and will not go back to copper for the reasons stated above. IMHO"
1062528,Guest,2008-10-28 15:34:00,0,"If i were a resort owner or in the business of rentals. I would want any advantage i could have over the competition. I think 2 full bathrooms would be a huge plus when 8 guys are sitting around trying to make a decision on where to stay if the fishing etc was about the same. Next to fishing, the accomodations are pretty darn important and I would want every angle I could get to sway the guests my way. Just my two cents."
1062532,Bill Krejca,2008-10-28 16:01:00,6107,"Having been a number of places where we could have as many ""bathrooms"" as we could dig, I'd say for this fisherman, being there in the wilderness and enjoying the water, the land, the sky, and the fishing were the reason for being there. All the more recent years when I stayed in a cabin, I don't believe anyone that I enticed to go with ever made the decision to go (fishing, that is) based upon (or even asked) how many bathrooms the cabin had. Last year the cabin we stayed at near Nakina had one facility for 8 guys. No one even thought about not going again based upon one bathroom. Rose, I do think, however, if I were building from scratch (no pun intended), I would have 1-1/2 baths to accommodate 8 guys. Bill Krejca"
1062604,Guest,2008-10-29 07:33:00,0,"I'd go with at least 1 1/2 and if you're doing that, you might as well add an extra shower and get 2 full baths. 1 bathroom for 8 people is not enough if there is mixed company. Even if its all guys, the line in the morning for the one bath takes up too much fishing time. And put in a high power exhaust fan."
1062090,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-10-25 12:50:00,116,"Here's a question for all of you. When is it time to put 2 bathrooms in a cabin? I mean how many people would it take to justify a second bath? Without cots, we really only have 4 person cabins and the next new one, I want it to sleep up to 8. My husband and I disagree on this this subject, so I'm turning the question over to my W.C. friends. You guys always give me good advise, so thanks in adavance...Rose"
1062098,dewyg,2008-10-25 14:10:00,1006,An 8 person cabin definitly needs 2 bathrooms.
1062102,2746,2008-10-25 15:01:00,3206,We can mange in a one bathroom unit with up to 6 guys but on the trips where there are 8 we look for 2 bathrooms. If you don't you'll have guys peeing off the deck or behind the cabin. Been there!
1062103,2746,2008-10-25 15:03:00,3206,P.S. Only one bathrrom needs a shower but you'll want two toilets.
1062115,stinkycat,2008-10-25 16:25:00,2018,How many people? 2 if you both really have to go. I would go with one full bath and one half bath if you are building this cabin or if you are renting I would go two. Off the deck? Ben there done that to. IMHO
1062118,Golden Eagle,2008-10-25 17:08:00,2642,One bathroom will do for eight men.Need two bathrooms for 7 men and one girlyman.Need lots of bathrooms for four couples.
1062141,Obabikon,2008-10-25 20:23:00,2370,"Rose, We have one cabin that sleeps 6 with just a single bathroom. Probably one of the biggest complaints we have. I almost never put 6 people in it anymore. I think you really need two."
1062158,Guest,2008-10-26 06:18:00,0,"Wherre I go we have to use outhouses! No need for bathrooms in the cabin be an adventurist. Yes people go to the bathroom outside but that will happen if you have 1 or 2 bathrooms. So I don't see the need for 2, just more expense on your side. Lets be real how many hours do you really spend in the cabin?"
1062165,Bill Krejca,2008-10-26 08:05:00,6107,"Rose, One bathroom for 8 guys seems to work, and does not appear to be an insurmountable problem. Another would be great, but not necessary. If you decide to add another, etc, just a toilet and sink would be sufficient. Most of us, unlike in our other life, seem to not shower every day when we are up there, anyway. Bill Krejca"
1062195,v-bay gord,2008-10-26 12:51:00,3168,"It is easier to add the extra bathroom during constuction rather than try and do it at a later time. Just keep all the plumbing in the same part of the cabin to make it simple. I would probably go with the half bath deal if you had the room and extra $. Probably not big deal for a bunch of guys, but it might be for 3 or 4 couples in that cabin."
