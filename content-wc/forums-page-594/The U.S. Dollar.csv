1062423,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-10-27 20:09:00,116,Today the dollar was at 1.29
1062619,Mike Kansas,2008-10-29 09:31:00,1463,"I don't care if they charge in US,Canadian or Pesos...I just want to go someplace that my arm gets tired from catching too many fish. We call it ""Walleye Elbow"""
1062679,prov1900,2008-10-29 16:11:00,544,"I am with you on that. I called my outfitter and reserved for next year. They asked if the ""state of the economy"" was going to affect us coming. I told him that we would beg, borrow, and steal if need be. I am planning already and jacked to go!"
1062755,Jimmy Jig,2008-10-30 08:23:00,1905,Now if the dollar stays in this area until May I'm sure the camp prices will be 29% lower if they are charging US funds.
1062835,Guest,2008-10-30 17:55:00,0,"I dont think the resorts will give the americans a break, after all most of the resorts are owned by americans."
1063327,Tony Shirley,2008-11-04 07:15:00,211,the dollar is going up.Canadian dollar that is
1063356,Obabikon,2008-11-04 10:18:00,2370,"Also... most camps didn't raise 15+% last year either. The good thing is, there shouldn't be much price raising this year. (hopefully)"
1060706,Crede,2008-10-16 14:27:00,134,"I live in Ohio and book a trip to Canada every year. Size of the group varies from 4 - 14 as some go yearly, some every other year, and some go as their schedule allows. I have been to places which charge in $US and places which charge in $CD. Other things being equal, I prefer a place which charges in $US. I book 10-12 months in advance. One of the first things each person asks me as I put these trips together is, ""How much is it going to cost?"" I can give a much more accurate answer if the price is in $US and avoid any ""confusion"" later. I do not see this as subterfuge. I see it as the camp owner making things simpler for his clients by taking the exchange rate ""risk"", such as it is, onto himself. Obviously by doing this he sometimes benefits and sometimes loses from the exchange fluctuations, but he takes that risk, not the guest. If the majority of the guests come from Canada, this does not apply. For those places which attract most of their business from the US, I see charging in $US as a service to their guests. If most of their business comes from Europe, then charging in Euros would likely be best for them."
1060713,v-bay gord,2008-10-16 15:21:00,3168,"I would agree with Crede that there is no subterfuge in charging in US dollars.....and the reasons for doing so are as he describes. It is very convenient for the US guest. The lodge owner is the one that takes the risk of either taking a loss (and looking like a good guy) or reaping a bonus ( and looking like a pirate, in some eyes). Usually by the end of the season it tends to balance out.......not sure about this year though."
1060715,Obabikon,2008-10-16 15:40:00,2370,"I'm a Canadian... born in Ontario. I charge in US funds. I bank in Canada, and have to exchange 100% of checks, cash, travelers checks from US$ to Canadian$. If I were to charge in Canadian, it wouldn't affect me. I pay my bills in Canadian, and would charge apropriately. It's not like camps that charge in Canadian charge $100 and camps that charge in US charge $100... then yes, the ones charging in US would be making more. However, that's stupid, and isn't the way things have worked... now or in the past. Camps that charged in Canadian charged more than those in US. Because Candian $ was valued less... the only way it benefits the camp owner, is if he switches back and forth according to which has more value. Right now, a strong US dollar will allow me to charge less. I'm hoping that it stays around 1.10 for next year, and I'll price accordingly."
1060771,Guest,2008-10-16 21:30:00,0,"This is crazy! What are you guys getting all hepped up about? All my guests are American. I charge in US funds. They pay me in US funds. When I have a crowd of guys at the counter on Friday night, I do not have to convert their total from Canadian to US while they wait. With my math skills that makes them happy. Since I do not know what the exchange rate at my bank will be whenever I get there to exchange the funds, I am happy. They can bring US dollars instead of buying Canadian at their home bank (there is a charge for that here and, according to my guests, in the US as well). I set my rates with all the exactitude of a US or Canadian economist. Unfortunately I have no hope of a bailout but I, like other operators I know, give it my best guess. I am not brain dead. If Canadian money was suddenly worth WAY more than yours I would adjust the price. I don't know any operators who are flying off to sunny locales for a winter vacation. The ones I know are like me - looking for winter work. We have good camps and we work hard but it's not a great living - just a great lifestyle. And this big whine about Can vs US funds floors me. A trip is worth $X. If it is too many $$ for you, go somewhere else - but why on earth do you care if the operator is making it easy for herself by using US $$ or going the Canadian conversion route?"
1060824,Guest,2008-10-17 08:43:00,0,"I agree, this seems like much ado about nothing. It is plainly easier for guests not to have to deal with the exchange rates, but if the currency fluctuations were to the point where my campowner decided he had to charge in Canadian funds, it wouldn't be that big a deal. I think if you check out resorts in places like the Caribbean or Mexico you will find that many other countries also quote prices in US funds."
1060989,lcwhit,2008-10-18 09:32:00,104,"i've stayed at 3 camps on lac seul. all were owned by canadians (one had dual citizenship, i believe). all charged in us funds. i have never seen a canadian in camp. i've only seen a hand full of canada registered boats on the lake. these operators know their business. give it a break. it's not about national pride. its about convenience for the customer."
1061003,joeman79,2008-10-18 10:26:00,417,"There are just a bunch of people in the world that like to ***** and complain, especially when it has no freaking effect on themselves. WHO CARES!!! Let it die."
1061030,Guest,2008-10-18 14:23:00,0,Interesting thread. Curious as to how you collect GST and PST and do your remittances at the end of each period. Taxes in Canada are paid in Canadian Dollars. With a fluctuating exchange rate (daily) it must be tough if you were ever audited. Maybe an outfitter can explain how this is done.
1061039,Guest,2008-10-18 17:27:00,0,I would love to know how other people do it. What I do is average the exchange rate I get at the bank each week for my reporting period (every 3 months) and use that figure to convert my US$ sales to Canadian$ for payment to our government.
1061076,Obabikon,2008-10-19 07:08:00,2370,"When I do my GST/PST I use the current exchange rate. However, this topic is actually going to make me consider using an average... (seems safer)."
1060549,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-10-15 17:13:00,116,I thought I'd pass this on. The dollar is at 1.18 today! Lets hope it will remain strong for next season to help offset some costs?
1060617,Guest,2008-10-16 06:30:00,0,"We're excited about the US dollar gaining strength because it will be like giving a discount on already reasonable rates. It's nice to be able to bring down the cost of a trip for our US guests and charging in Canadian Funds all the time is the only way to do that. There is still time for a fall trip with a stronger US dollar more than taking care of all the taxes on your trip again. Please try to support as many lodges that charge in Canadian Funds as possible. They didn't take advantage of the premium years ago (as long as they were giving a fair exchange rate) and they won't be doing it now. If the US dollar rises more this winter, do you think the places charging US Funds will drop their rates? We can't give exactly the rate stated by the market report because the banks buy and sell currency to make money. For example, if you stood at the teller window and exchanged $100 back and forth between US and Canadian funds all day long, you would end up with nothing because the banks buys and sells for different prices. If the bank is giving us $1.18 for a US dollar, we will set our exchange rate at $1.15 or $1.16 to give us a slight cushion in case the rate goes the other way before we can get to the bank within 1 to 2 weeks. When the US dollar was weaker than the Canadian dollar this summer, we were calling the bank info line multiple times a day and making sure we made deposits every week so we could give almost exactly the rate we were getting. It's all about doing our best to give our US guests the best value we can. I would love to be able to give our US guests $1.20 or $1.25 for every dollar they spend again. For the small amount of time we can spend in the US each year, we'll suck up a weaker Canadian dollar on our US trips for the sake of better value for all the US guests still showing us great support. Thanks to all those US anglers that keep coming to Canada. We really do appreciate you spending your valuable time and hard earned money up here."
1060642,Obabikon,2008-10-16 08:49:00,2370,"I charge in US dollars. Those comments about resorts that charge in US dollars are kind of shady man. I didn't raise my rates when the US dollar went to crap, I won't raise my rates if the Canadian dollar turns around. The reason I charge in US, is when I get a booking 6 months in advance... they want to know how much they're going to pay. However, at camps that charge in Canadian... they have no clue. It could be $1000 or it could be $1200..."
1060647,Guest,2008-10-16 09:28:00,0,I've always wondered about Canadians charging in U.S. funds. How do you figure what you need to charge when you don't know what the exchange rate will be?
1060654,Jimmy Jig,2008-10-16 10:03:00,1905,"Resort Guy's got it right! All camps should charge Canadian money, the exchange rate then wouldn't have anything to do with it. The camp I go to has charged Canadian rates since l939. Has anyone from Canada ever seen a US store charge anything other than US rate??? Not knowing the rate in January that will be in effect in June doesn't seem to bother anyone. If the rate goes up or down it usally is slow in doing so, It took quit a few years to drop to even from 40%."
1060666,v-bay gord,2008-10-16 10:38:00,3168,In these weird economic times I really don't see how any lodge can make a prediction on next years exchange rate and be committed to it on their rate sheets. Good luck to you if your crystal ball is that accurate! I prefer the Canadian dollar rates myself.......so do the suppliers that send their bills in my direction far too frequently!
1060676,Golden Eagle,2008-10-16 11:29:00,2642,Canadian camp owners should list rates in Canadian currency when half or more of their customers are Canadians who carry Canadian currency. Any idea on when that will happen? Locals who sometimes complain about docking charges aren't about to ante up for a fishing trip. Camp owners cater to those who pay the their way. Why complicate the trip by making them convert currency?
1060677,Guest,2008-10-16 11:38:00,0,"If the collect U.S. currency and pay their employees and supliers in canadian currency, how can they come close to predicting what their rates need to be to make a living?"
1060690,Guest,2008-10-16 12:50:00,0,"HI. Do you ever see things in the U.S. charged in candian funds or swiss funds or anything other than US funds? it should be the same thing in canada. they should only charge in their countries funds, Oh I forgot most of the places that charge in US funds are owned by americans and THEY dont want to be bothered having to deal with the exchange rate. Dont tell me you are charging in US funds for the ease of your customers. We stayed in a place that charged in US funds and got screwed royaly. No after that we only stayed in places that were proud enough of their own country to use their own currency. You can try to justify it however you want but most people see through the subterfuge."
1060702,Golden Eagle,2008-10-16 14:23:00,2642,I'm not Canadian.I always stay in camps owned by Canadians.They price trips in U.S. currency.I pay in U.S. currency.I get good value for my dollars spent.It's none of my business how any camp owner lists his prices. Whatever anybody thinks about it is none of my business or is any of my concern. We all need to deal with people who make us happy. We have the power to make ourselves happy.
