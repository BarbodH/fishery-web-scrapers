Do fellow guests share hotspots with new guests or are they secretive? When we went to Cedar Lake for years, everyone was great about sharing, but I've heard some things to the contrary and I'm curious."
1062434,bpetersen,2008-10-27 21:14:00,251,"Hi Rose, Long time no write too. I have seen all types of people in camps. Some people are a little stuck on themselves about sharing. I have found most people will start sharing spots after a camp gathering. It seems the older people are, the more they will share spots. Most people will, I think, share spots if they see people in camp are not having as much success or new to the lake. There are always exceptions to the rule. I have had people help me and I will extend the same to others. I think a big key is getting people to know each other in camp early. As far as maps, most resorts I have been to, about a dozen or so, issue just a basic map with some depths and various fishing spots marked and can purchase a better one from the resort. One of these days I will find the maps I collected of Cliff and Ord. When I do, I will ship them off to you. Keep asking those questions."
1062445,Moondog,2008-10-27 23:07:00,362,The camp we go to gives out nice maps when you get your fishing license. As for willingness to share? Depends.
1062467,Catman59,2008-10-28 06:50:00,345,"We get a very nice lake map. I also have the Navionics chip now and was taken on a lake tour by the camp owners and marked off LOTS of spots. As far as other guests sharing ----- some protect their spots and others are more than happy to share honeyholes. It seems that once you become a regular , it helps get in on the hiotspots by other guests."
1062519,dutchboy,2008-10-28 14:45:00,5717,The last camp I was at the owner had everyone meet at the dock at 3 pm on the first afternoon. He then had anyone who wanted to go follow him out onto the Lake. He drove around and dropped a camera down and gave you a thumbs up if there was Walleye down below. This was nice in that it allowed you a chance to see portions of the lake and mark a few spots if you wanted to. He also was more then willing to share during the week if you were having trouble locating fish or if you had questions. Very helpfull people. Any camp owner unwilling to help their guests should be looking for new guests year after year. IMHO
1064226,Steve of Madison,2008-11-12 15:52:00,230,"Rose.......the first time I went to LS (1994) the ""former"" owners were about as helpful as....well you know why they are now former owners....they sold us a small photocopied map and set us on our way. The next day was spent figuring out how to get back to camp and how we got so turned around. From that day forward I purchased the best survey maps of the area I could, and bought a GPS and learned how to use it. But I copy my original map at Kinko's and bring a dozen or so for the rest of the newbies that are at our camp every year. Sending out a first timer on LS borders on criminal if they don't have a GPS or a good map. My original purchase cost me about $10, I cut a pasted the 4 maps together to create one that I could use and copying it cost me about $40/yr. But the friends I've made from handing them out and the new spots they discover and let me in on is a very inexpensive investment. The one I carry has been marked with spots from every year and laminated, just in case it gets washed by rain.If you are considering creating a good map for your guests, for navigation and fishing spots, I guarantee they will be very appreciative!"
