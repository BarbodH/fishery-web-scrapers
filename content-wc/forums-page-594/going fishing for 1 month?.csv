1060390,Guest,2008-10-14 17:05:00,0,I fish in Canada in the spring and again in the fall for one week each. My question is what is it like to stay for one month or more to fish? Stay at one camp or move around to others? Do you take the wife or go alone?
1060392,2Labs,2008-10-14 17:12:00,685,"PLUS --I have always wondered about how people pay their bills from your Canada location if they arrive at your mailbox back at home?Do they use online bills for most things like cable, cell phone, public utilities, etc? BUT what about municipal bills like water/sewer -- they come from the municipality and not many of them have online billing available to their customers."

She pretty much knows what will be do and sets up the checks, and all they have to do is to send them. On the ones that she doesn't know the exact total they fill in the numbers. Works real slick."

Put all bills that you can on ""auto-pay"" with your bank. That means they are automatically deducted from your checking account. You can set up on-line banking to download your bank statements and all charges so you can keep your checkbook in balance. You can pre-pay municipal bills, estimated taxes, etc. They won't mind getting the check early. Get a post office box in a US city on the border, like International Falls. Have all your mail forwarded to the PO Box. You can also pay your bill through on-line banking if you are computer savvy. Have a neighbor check your front porch and mailbox for deliveries that slip through. That covers the basics. As far as where to stay... That depends on your intentions. There are places you can rent homes for extended periods. You can move from camp to camp concentrating on specific species of fish in each lake. Fish the ""best of the best."" What ever works for you. I elected to rent a house by the year on LOTW. That way I can leave all my ""stuff"" there and not have to haul it back and forth. It also helps get you established in the community and provides friendships that make extended stays a lot more fun. I suggest getting involved with a local church. You will meet nice folks, who, like you, are on extended vacations or are summer residents. Both they and the locals make excellent resources for your fishing quest. If you have any questions, send me a private message and I'll try to fill in the gaps."

1062696,Golden Eagle,2008-10-29 18:28:00,2642,"My wife and I went north in 1960, traveling in an Austin Healey Sprite. We were gone 7 weeks, 49 days and nights of camping & fishing. One day, without much of a thought, we left Desbarats, Ontario and ended up at Benton Harbor, MI for two nights, then up to Ludington, MI for more camping and riding dune buggies. We stopped at Traverse City, MI on our way to a couple of nights of camping on the UP. Then back up to Chapleau before ending our 7 weeks and arriving back in Oxford, OH for the second semester of graduate school. We subrented our $50 a month house and paid ahead on our $60 a month Sprite payment. If there were any problems we weren't smart enough to worry about them. We spent every night on the ground except for one night in a carpenter's woodshop and a second night in a native commercial fisherman's house at $5 for a nice, soft bed. We meant to get up early and go fishing, but somehow slept until noon.Total out of pocket was under $300."
1062899,rpieske,2008-10-31 11:32:00,1276,"I don't know what you mean by a law about 6 weeks. There are tons of summer residents on LOTW. It is seamless making the transition. The hard part is finding the right place to rent on the right water. If you have any other questions I might help you with, just send me a PM."
