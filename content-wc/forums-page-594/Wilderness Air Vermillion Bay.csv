1063934,tackleman,2008-11-10 14:37:00,444,Where I go on Eagle Lake the tourist camp next door stopped using their own plane for their guests this year and went to using wilderness air. The camp is a 5 star rated camp and I don't think they would use anything less than a safety oriented carrier for their guests.
