I've been there before a caught a lot of nice Smallmouth, Walleye and Pike, but never tried the perch. It's said to be loaded with them. It's a large, deep (anywhere from flats of 5 foot to 210 feet), rocky lake with a lot of radical contour changes and some nice weed beds in varying depths. It follows an old river bed, so it winds around from narrows to large bays for 8 or so miles. Any ideas or suggestions on going after some Perch? I'm a bass and walleye guy (occasionally crappie), so I need specifics on rods, line, bait, location, presentation, etc. Thanks, Brad"

I like a snelled hook (#6) tied to about 6# test (in case you get something bigger) and a split shot just above the knot. The split shot should be heavy enough to get the rig to the bottom but not too heavy. Later in summer minnows seem to be best. Before that we use pc's of crawler or worms or an occasional leech. Just drop the rig over the side of the boat in an area w/a few weeds on the bottom, raise the split shot up about 4-6"" and just watch your rod tip. I'd start in about 20' of water. If you don't get anything in 5-10"" move, either deeper or shallower. Many times, once the fish get a 'bite on' they can go hot and heavy for a while then stop and then start again. If it is rough, set it so your split shot just taps the bottom w/the rocking of the boat. I mainly watch the rod tip as you can use 3 rods in WI. You can tell anything 'unusual' happening to the rod if you watch close and practice. In MN, I hold onto the rod and feel for the tell-tale taptap or watch too. Hope this helps some. GOOD LUCK. PS, some people like to use little jigs but I think they interfere w/the minnow action. Some like slip bobbers but you HAVE to be on the bottom and it's hard to tell w/those if you are or aren't."
