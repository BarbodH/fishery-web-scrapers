549547,Reels,2005-06-21 09:31:00,2876,Last I heard there is/was suppose to be a hearing to decide if the contactors or the owner would get the first proceeds from the sale. There is a lot of money owed to the people that rebuilt it that was never paid. <{{}}><
549552,Guest,2005-06-21 09:57:00,0,"Last I heard they were still investigating the source of the fire. I don't know if they can settle the property until they formally close the investigation. We did a casual 'walk-about' over there last year, just to look at the old place. What hasn't burned was already in a poor state of repair... Too bad it burnt down, it was a very nice place to visit, especially the restraunt on the river and the library in the lodge... Chuck"
