549550,Guest,2005-06-21 09:53:00,0,"We've never had a question or raised eyebrow when bringing tomatoes thru Fr. Francis or Rainy River crossings. As long as they are for your own consumption, I doubt that you will. Of course, don't even attempt to bring fresh potatoes, plan on getting them in Canada, or even take frozen french fries... Chuck"
