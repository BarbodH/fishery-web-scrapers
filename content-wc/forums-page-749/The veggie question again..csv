NO -- I will not be bringing in potatoes, however we will be coming in the last week of July and our veggie garden will be in full production. I would like to bring in some of the tomatoes and peppers that we have an abundance of for our vittle package. All the other produce will be purchased in Canada by our outfitter. I've read the publication ""RC4161 Customs Information for Visitors to Canada and Seasonal Residents"" found at this website http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/E/pub/cp/...tml#P192_11966 and other info posted on the Canada Border Services Agency website and can't find anything specific."

The only fruit/vegitable we ever had a problem with was potatoes, the year before they actually started banning them. We could see the handwriting on the wall, so never have taken raw potatoes after that. We've also taken corn, tomatoes, green beans, peas, peppers, squash, onions, etc. and have never had a problem. I don't think you will get much grief, as long as it is for your own consumption. Chuck from IL"

Much stronger than U.S. onions. And they were good. The potatoes, too. And by the way, try a beer called Kokanee. Good stuff. It's our camp favorite. Bander6"
