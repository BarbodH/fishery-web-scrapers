549564,Guest,2005-06-21 12:15:00,0,"We crossed at Pigeon River at about 11:30AM Friday, June 10th, and again coming back Friday, June 17th, about 7 or 8PM. Smooth sailing both ways, and almost no back-ups. Each direction we waited only about 8-10 minutes, and the line going the other way was about the same. As far as ID, they only asked for our driver's license from everyone in the group, about a 2-minute stop. We had a problem negotiating between Duluth and Two Harbors along the lakeshore coming back on Saturday. Some big marathon race and lots of spectators & detours. Slow going. But get a load of this, going up on the 10th, we stopped for gas in Two Harbors, MN at a Holiday station. Everywhere else gas was about $2.05.9 or higher. At this place it was $1.95.9 Couldn't believe our eyes. Even asked the clerk if that was correct. By the time we came back, though, and with the marathon and all, they were right back up there with everybody else. Bander6"
