I have yet to get over the 29"" mark. Heading to Lac Seul one week from today. Any suggestions on a couple spots to try and break the 29"" mark would be greatly appreciated. What depths are the walleyes at this week? Presentatio...jigs or trolling live bait rigs??? Thanks in advance. Can't wait to get there!"
549465,Guest,2005-06-19 21:32:00,0,"Our group of 4 will be there the same time. I love South Inlet. But I have my own ""Honey Hole"". Last year we had a stong SW wind and got between 2 islands in 15-20' and boated 7 29"" and 8 28"" with many more going down before running out of sunlight and minnows. Good spot is along the west shoreline around the mouth of the small river that flows in, also straight across from there on the east side in among the islands. There are also 2 points that come out on the east side, they will be under water this year with the water up and should be HOT. I will be out of Onaway, give us a wave, we should be in there at least 2-3 days during the week."
549473,Guest,2005-06-20 07:52:00,0,"We will be fishing out of Scout Lake Camp. How do you like Onaway? WE drove up the road last year and checked it out. Looked like a nice camp! We will be sure to give you a wave. Are you talking about the inflow about at the end of the first bay in the South Inlet, and not all the way back towards the falls? Are far into the South Inlet are the two islands you were talking about? Have you ever tried to target larger pike in these areas? If so, were at? We have tried, and have caught some 36-38"", but it also seems like you catch just as many while walleye fishing. Good Luck! See you on the water."
549517,Guest,2005-06-20 21:38:00,0,"Onaway is great. Come on over, the beer will be cold. Or we can toast the day with a Weiser's whiskey. The islands I was talking about are the one's opposite the small river. I have fished down at the islands at the bottom by the falls but that is hit and miss some days, depends on the wind. The east side after you come thru Hungry Narrows there are several islands, the water goes from 50' to 20' and shallower. Our guide several years ago called this the refriderator, because that is where the big ones go to eat. He was not wrong."
549518,Two Tex,2005-06-20 21:43:00,8,"Well I SEE YOU FOUND ONE OF THE MANY FINE SPOTS ON LAC SUEL,THIS IS A GREAT AREA,THE DEEPER WATER NEAR THE SHANTY NARROWS,HOLES SOME BIG FISH, BUT THE NETS GOT SOME THE WINTER BEFORE LAST.IFISH FOR THE BIG FISH, BUT I AM LATE THIS YEAR GOING UP FOR THE SUMMER. YOU SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM OF THE LAKE.GREAT THING,THERE ARE MANY FINE REPLYS TO GUESTIONS ASKED ON THE WALLEYE CENTRAL. MY TYPING IS VERY POOR, BUT I WOULD LIKE HELP WHERE I CAN,I FIRST FISH THE LAKE IN 1962.THIS IS ONE GREAT FISHING LAKE BETTER NOW THAN BEFORE. WELL I HAVE HUNT AND PECK ENOUGH ON THE KEY PAD. I JUST HAD TO SAY YALL DO A GREAT JOB HELPING OTHERS TO FISH THE GREATLAKE."
549534,Guest,2005-06-21 07:52:00,0,"If I can round up the troops, maybe we will swing by Onaway one night. Hopefully we can toast some big fish. Nothing better than a day on the water followed up with cold beer and fried walleye. If we don't make it over....good luck! Have a great trip, and we can swap some stories the following week. Hopefully will see you on the water. We will be fishing from a Scout Lake Camp boat. Other guys in our group are bringing their own boats."
549546,Guest,2005-06-21 09:17:00,0,I will be going to Lac Seul (Scout Lake area)the week of July 9. Will you guys (Steve of Madison and KC Dave) please post a fishing report when you guys get back? I will be interested in depths and tactics. We usually spend a couple of days in South Inlet. Will be interested in spots there and anywhere else you catch them. Maybe they will be waiting in the same spots when we get there. WE always release over the slot only keeping a few smaller ones to eat. Good luck to you both. Can hardly wait for our trip.
549548,Guest,2005-06-21 09:33:00,0,"Hey Dave from Kc, I can only assume that your from the Kansas City area? I'm also from Kansas city & will be at Scout Lake Resort the week of June 25th. I will be taking my 7 year old son up for the first time this year & he's excited!! We stay in the small cabin down by the fish house. If you get a chance come by & say hi & maybe we can swap fish stories! Eric"
549566,Two Tex,2005-06-21 12:47:00,8,"I was reading the artical on walleye central spread out on the flats.This is the right thing on Lc. But leave the boards at home.Ihave caught big fish doing how they are telling everyone.I use big blades, big hooks,5/0, 3/0on on 2 and 3 foot leaders. With minnows ,white tails,big minnows,10 to 15 beads,try to make them bait color in the spread,back trolling along the flats near the deep water, 80 feet deep water . The deep water holes have white fish and bait fish the wind moves the bait fish food to the flats and rock humps. this is not a numbers game, but it is fun when you hit the log and it moves. the wind is the key as many of you point out. I have also left the flats and keeping the same depth move to the deep water and had luck.I might add copper blades bright days, glow beads and glow floats on darker days. I hope this helps, its just another way.I also have used the lures in perch pattern ."
549568,Guest,2005-06-21 13:13:00,0,"Eric: Yep...from Kansas City...Olathe specifically. We have a group of 8, not sure what cabin we are in but will be sure to say hi and trade some stories. I have been going up to Scout Lake with my Dad, cousins, uncles, about every other year for the last 16 years. I am sure your son will love it. The first two lakes near camp are good northern action...and can catch nice walleyes too. Every year I see a 23-25"" walleye caught right off the dock. My first trip up there was when I was about 12 or 13. Have a safe trip up. See you there!"
