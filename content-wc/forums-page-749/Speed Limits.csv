Is Canada as liberal with the speed laws? Are US citizens treated differently than Canadians? My son-in-law will be driving and he sometimes has a heavy foot, should I warn him to not exceed the posted limits, or is there some leeway? Ron"
549174,rockpt,2005-06-13 19:23:00,589,"In my experience the speed limits in NW Ontario are rather strictly enforced compared to most US states. I got dinged about three years ago outside Morson when I was about 15 mph over (and I'm not complaining about it). Seems to be more cops out also, compared to Minnesota. I wouldn't go any more than 10 mph over the max, if that. Also, don't get caught with a radar detector in Ontario, they're illegal."
549175,Guest,2005-06-13 19:27:00,0,Make use of the either the 10 percent rule or the 10 Km/h rule - both will get you no Speeding tickets. 100 km/h go no faster than 110 km/h 90 km/h go no faster than 99 km/h and so on. 10 Mph is pushing it. If you want another rule of thumb give yourself 6 Mph (10 Km/h). These are safe rates of speed that the police will give you the benefit of the doubt.
549176,Trailerguy,2005-06-13 19:29:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]There are OPP Posts at Fort Francis,Kenora, Dryden, Soiux Narrows, Ear Falls and Red Lake. Most of the rookies, just out of the acadamey start out in the more remote posts. They have to do something to impress the brass to get assigned to a decent sized town. 10 kph is 6 mph, beyond that it's a lottery in my experience. And would you ticket somebody who pays taxes and votes for officials or somebody you will never see again?"
549466,Guest,2005-06-19 21:52:00,0,"Trailerguy, you are right on the money. Leave ""leadfoot"" in the back seat. 10mph will get you dinged. Besides....what's the hurry?"
549468,bubbalou,2005-06-20 05:59:00,29,"I got nailed just outside of Fort Francis last fall. I saw a 55 kph sign and i hadn't switched over my brain to that way of thinking and I got nailed. I was only ten over, on my way to 20 mph, over and he was sitting right on the edge of town. He knew exactly what he was doing. I'll bet he has nailed hundreds of people doing the same exact thing. He was a real prick!!!!!!!! I tried to be nice and said I was sorry as I had just driven 10 hours and hadn't adjusted to where I was at yet, he couldn't care less, seem to make him even madder. Wrote me a ticket that cost me $100 Canadian. It had to be in the form of a money order. It was a pain in the butt. I drove the speed limit the rest of the way in Canada and got passed like I was standing still. I will be much more alert when I head up this summer."

549555,MoWalleyeguy,2005-06-21 10:34:00,409,"If your concerned about having more fishing time then just leave earlier. If you get stopped then instead of having more fishing time you will end up having less along with having less money for bait! If everyone out there would respect the laws of the States and the laws of other Countrys then the world would be a safer place. Travel in some of the areas of Ontario should be done carefully anyways with the amount of wildlife that is out there. Moose, bear, deer, etc can be major hazards and has killed more then just a few eagar fisherman. Every year I read about someone else dieing on there way to there hot fishing hole. Good luck and be safe!"
