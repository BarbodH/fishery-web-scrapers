549504,WIPP,2005-06-20 17:57:00,75,When are you going? We will be there July 9-13. This will be our 5th year there. Fishing is very good using minnows or powerbaits. Lots of spots to explore. What kind of info are you interested in?
549508,Guest,2005-06-20 19:59:00,0,"We will be there for the tenth straight year from July 1st-10th. So that you know what to expect, I will try to lay it out for you. Ken and/or his staff will meet you at Deception Landing load all your stuff up if you don't have your own boat and bring you to camp by boat about a 60 minute ride. When you arrive the staff will unload your gear and bring it to your cabin, while you settle in. The cabins are nothing special, if you got a VIP you will have a shower and toilet, if not you will use the ""public"" facilities. The camp photos are on their website. Once you get settled in they will give you an orientation on the lodge and markup a map of good fishing spots. If you don't like to travel far some of the best fishing is right around the camp. The dock produces several 30""+ walleyes every year and some nice pike. If you like to explore I recommend going to Wapesi Bay or Scaler Lake. As for bait, jigheads and minnows are all you really need. Worms and leeches work well too. They have a bait shop onsite, each morning Brenda will be waiting to fill your minnow bucket (for a small fee of course). If you are there the first week of July stop by are cabin. We occupy both sides of the duplex unit, we would be happy to point you to some good spots or swap stories."

The one time we went in early July it seemed like leeches outfished minnows for the guys that use bait. I usually just stick to power baits now. It is easy to fish without a guide if you have some basic walleye fishing knowledge. You can catch them on jigs, spinner/crawler harnesses, cranks. Light colors like chartreuse and white have worked for us. I bring my own boat and gas in ( it is understandably expensive there as they have to bring it in by boat.) Using a depthfinder, if it looks like it would hold fish it probably does. The water is stained and it is a good day-fishing lake. Seems like the fish don't get going until about mid-morning, but then you can catch fish until dark. Every cabin has a fish deep fryer on the porch - we have fried fish every night. We have had good experiences with the staff."

Have never been there before but have fished several other resorts on Lac Seul over the last 20 years. We have heard a lot of good tales about the fishing there and are looking forward to it. The couple that is going with us has never been to Canada and it should be a special treat for them. Any other suggestions you guys have that would help our fishing would be appreciatted. Thanks, Mike Kansas"
549545,WIPP,2005-06-21 09:16:00,75,"If you use jigs, bring lots. We use mostly 1/4 or 3/8 oz. I use our GPS the whole time. Go slow when you explore - there are some hazards though we have never hit one - and then you can go fast when you back-track. Bring a cooler in the boat for the fish you want to eat- they need to be killed right away. I snap their neck and put them on ice. They have plenty of ice for you. Don't put any beer in it - no alcohol allowed in the boat when fishing. Other things needed in boat include a waterproof flashlight and a throwable rope with a float attached. I have never been checked for these things, but I have talked to others in camp who have been pinched by the MNR for having live fish in the boat. I think they said the fine was something like $50 per person plus $50 per fish if I recall correctly. Get a good map. I got mine from fishingmap.com, though I notice they sell the same one at the lodge in camp. I also took my fish ruler and put a piece of tape covering the slot lengths for both walleyes and northerns on it. If you bring your own boat, bring a long extension cord for your battery charger. I go through about 50 gallons of gas in 4 days of fishing with my 90hp 4 stroke."
