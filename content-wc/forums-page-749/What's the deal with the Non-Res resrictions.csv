548630,Hammerhead Herb,2005-05-31 18:47:00,259,This topic was also covered quite extensively in the following Walleye Central posting.https://www.walleyecentral.com/dc/dcb...ng_type=search
548635,Guest,2005-05-31 20:51:00,0,"It's been 2 per day /4 total for the last several years on Lake of the Woods on regular license. We griped when the regs went from 6 to 4 total and then with the new law 2 and 4 plus some size restrictions. All I know is this will be my 16th year fishing north LOTW and the walleye keep getting bigger and bigger. The first few years if somebody caught a 5 pounder it was rare, now a 5 pounder is common while lots more bigger than that. I am willing to sacrifice a liitle quanitiy for quality. Those 7 pounders are more fun to catch than those 14 inchers."
548639,Guest,2005-05-31 21:15:00,0,"I think this is a BAD idea! If the fishery is in trouble, then yes cut back the limit BUT make it for both res and non res, that is fair. You can argue, it's their resource but ask them if they would rather have a 4 fish limit or loose revenue from non-res fisherman. Let's face it, both sides benefit from the tourist dollars coming into the area. The second question I have is, is there any comercial fishing in the area? If so, was their quota also dropped? The resort that is selling fish to take home is a joke. The real kicker would be if the fish being sold by the resort was caught from the same waters. And for the people that call the non res meathunters, get real, what meat hunter in his right mind would go all the way to Canada for 4 fish? The people that go now are fisherman not meat hunters. This rule is unfair to the non res and I hope the area looses revenue because of it. Not because of the limit, but because it is slanted against the non res. We'll see how many res will say non res stay home when thier taxes go up to pay for the lost revenue. The big loosers in this will be the resorts."
548640,Guest,2005-05-31 21:34:00,0,"This is all very interesting, but why stop at two for non-residents only if we are truly interested in developing or protecting quality fisheries? Why not some kind of sliding scale where the down on his luck zebco fisherman in a rusty tin can gets to put some meat on the table to feed his poor family, while those with fancy fishing boats with motors exceeding 100hp only get to keep fish two or three days per year, as it is obvious that they spend way too much time on the water and would otherwise put too much pressure on the fishery. Seriously I would like to see some kind of tag system where only one or two over slot trophy fish could be kept per license for the year. This kind of system has been successfully used for large redfish in Texas. I also like the idea of some waters being managed as trophy catch and release fisheries while others are managed for those that like to keep a few fish. Lac Seul would be perfect for a two shore lunch limit of eater size fish for the year to insure that it continues to be the mecca of walleye fishing."
548645,Brax,2005-06-01 05:22:00,52,"This is the way I understand the regs for Lac Seul. A resort owner explained it this way. The limit is 4 possession. So if you have 2 fish in the freezer at camp and you catch and eat 2 fish for shore lunch, you can not keep another fish that day. You have to skip shore lunch the last day to fill out your 4 for home."
548648,jigman 2003,2005-06-01 06:08:00,981,"This may already have been stated, but I believe the reason for the 2 fish in possession in boundary waters areas is that Minnesota anglers were crossing the border, catching their four fish, and returning home. They were not helping to financially support resort owners, restaurants, grocery stores, etc. in Canada. Therefore, Ontario changed the daily possesion limit in those areas near the border. You can still have four fish, it just takes two days or more to ""accumulate"" them. As another poster stated; the number of fish taken home should not be the sole reason to go fishing. If you want a bunch of fish, stop at the grocery store, they are cheaper to buy than catch. I believe you can purchase all the fresh walleye fillets you want from the First Nation in Canada. Stop and get a couple hundred pounds if you want."
548739,Guest,2005-06-02 11:39:00,0,No fish over 18in. can be eaten on the Gullrock chain. That's why we don't have a 2 fish limit for non residents.
548756,Guest,2005-06-02 19:05:00,0,"You saw someone with an 8 inch walleye??????? You really want us to believe that?? If you are going to go on endlessly, at least put something believeable. I did go to Minaki last year, and I posted when I got home from the trip that I caught a lot of walleye under 16 inches, and a lot over 21 inches. We barely found any in between 16 and 21. I feel that there is definately a problem. I just think that it is a slap in the face for Canada to add higher restrictions to out of towners, who contribute a tremendous amount of money to the local economies. The out of towners fish maybe a week or two a year. The locals can be on the water almost daily taking out 4 fish. Restrictions should be consistant."
548762,Skylane,2005-06-02 20:33:00,101,"Here is my vote for you Local Yokel, you are right on. I can not believe people are so worried about keeping fish and are not able to see the big picture. The lake my cabin is on (in N-W Ontario) is a prime example of what can happen when too many fish with no slot are taken out. I pray for stiffer rules and hope the time comes when no fish will be allowed to cross the border! If it is all about meat then maybe it would be better for those to stay home and fish for carp. It is a privelege to fish in Canada, it is their country, let us abide by their rules and not cry."
548766,Guest,2005-06-03 07:15:00,0,"I do not think that people are complaining about tougher restrictions. The title of this post is Non-Res restrictions, and how that has caused hard feelings. The economy in that area of Ontario counts on American tourists coming up there during a three month window and spending a lot of money. These Non-Res restrictions cause hard feelings so people might go elsewhere. I read on a different page in WC about how Minnesota and one of the Dakotas are in a huge dispute because one of the states put a much higher hunting restriction/fee for non-residents, and state legislaters are getting involved in tit for tat fueds. It is not just a Canada issue, but something that creates hard feeling everywhere."
548781,IaCraig,2005-06-03 13:53:00,434,"I read all the posts on this and I have a couple comments. Merc - For me that slot size keeps getting harde to find at Minaki, I expect to eat a couple grass snakes or smallies for shore lunch in 2005. Have you ever tried South Dakota? I'm a rookie to much of Minnesota, but it has been very hit & miss so I plan to try SD first. TrailerGuy - Nice link. I didn't realize some of the DWI's people were getting fined for at the border dated back 20+ years. That is silly. Local - How come when I come to Canada I am never met with any anti-americanism attitudes like yours? You guys only seem to troll on web sites like this one. In-Aaron - Nice to hear from you again, I hope to have a beer with you someday on a visit to Minaki. Like you I don't see much of a change for me caused by the MNR regs, but unlike you I don't completely buy into the MNR report regarding their regulations. Also I think it would be cool to have a cabin on Big Sand, but right now I am glad I can be more mobile so I am more likely a couple new systems in 2006. My opinionof the new regs - The MNR can pass any laws they want, that won't keep me away as long as I am welcome. However they are sending me 2 messages - #1 - Walleye fishing is better almost everywhere else in Ontario, so I'd be a fool to limit my scope to Minaki. #2 - I think it is great they are trying to remedy a problem before it is too late, even if I feel they are in denial about the impact resident's anglers and netters make. Later anglers IaCraig"
548783,Guest,2005-06-03 14:01:00,0,"Craig...let me know when your going to be at Minaki again...I'm heading up on the 16th. With regards to the regs...it really doesn't matter to me what they do about the walleye regs as I don't walleye fish....usually catch them by accident fishing for smallies. The rest of my family does and everyone seems to agree with the new regs...I for one am happy with the slot...I think we shall see the results in about five years from now. What poeple fail to realize is that system is subject to much more stress on spawning and such caused by the drastic change in water levels that takes place what seems like every year. And for anyone who tries to convince me that locals catch and take more walleye out of that system than nonresidents.....well, I can only laugh. Good fishing."
548784,Guest,2005-06-03 14:12:00,0,"Aaron-in If you own a cabin on the lake, are you considered a resident, and therefor can keep 4 walleye? If so do you get the conservation license that allows you just the 2? I personally save the $15 and always bought the conservation. I had an idea years ago, and I still feel it would work if ALL lodge owners got together and adopted it. Everyone that stays at a resort gets a free conservation license. If everyone does it, then it should not have a negative effect on any resort, and all of the resorts would absorb the cost in the price of the cabin. If all lodges give a conservation free, then people would then have to pay about $35 more for a regular license for just two fish extra. I believe that not many would pay that extra $35 for two fish."
548785,fourize,2005-06-03 14:44:00,287,"If you think that a 2 fish, 13.8 to 17.7 slot limit for non-residents is going to keep my Dad and I from coming up to Canada...you're crazy!!! See you in September."
548787,Guest,2005-06-03 15:33:00,0,"Bor........don't quote me but I believe you have to live in Canada for so many months before your considered a ""resident"" and can buy a residents liscense. I only buy the nonresident conservation annual every year as I don't keep many fish anyway."
549610,Trailerguy,2005-06-22 08:10:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]If the Canadian tourist market was untapped then Canadian run resorts would exploit it. Most Canadian residents would refuse to pay for a fishing trip that they can have for free. They can camp and fish anywhere, on virtually any lake in NWO without paying. Non-residents on the other hand aren't allowed to camp or leave a boat overnight on most Crown land, forcing them to pay resorts or not fish. It's like the moose hunters coming from Tronto in the fall. You see an old school bus pulling a trailer with all means of gear (1/2 of which you see left in the bush),or at most they want to spend $100 cnd to stay in a camp for the week. The resorts haven't run out of US tourists yet,and it isn't likely to happen anytime soon, as much as we like to grumble about it. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
549621,phishfearme,2005-06-22 12:09:00,1242,"trailorguy - i'm confused by your response. i was under the impression that non-residents could indeed camp anywhere on crown land and bring a boat anywhere without using an outfitter as long as they paid for the non-resident camping permit for their stay. have the laws changed? regrettably, your example of a schoolbus trucking up from toronto for moose also applies for fishing. i have observed residents hauling all forms of gear into the bush - to save a few bucks - and simply leaving it behind. i guess there's slobs everywhere but the reason residents don't use the lodges and fly-ins is still not clear to me. phish"
549623,Guest,2005-06-22 12:21:00,0,"As a resident of Ontario, resorts that charge their rates in American funds is a sore spot with me. Some have actually requested payment in U.S. funds. I'd like to see the response a resort in the States would get if it insisted on Canadian funds. A lot of camps are simply alienating potential Canadian customers with these practices."
549624,Trailerguy,2005-06-22 12:56:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]There are areas that a permit allows non-residents to camp, such as the islands on Wabaskang Lake. There is much more crown land that camping by non-residents is not allowed, it may or may not be posted that way. As an example there are a number of lakes SW of Wabby that are posted ""no camping by non-residents with-in 3/4 of a kilometer of lake xxx"". Since the lakes are closer than that together, it effectivly means the entire block of forest has no camping allowed, but residents can camp right on the lake shore. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
549629,phishfearme,2005-06-22 14:45:00,1242,i think the example you give is an small exception to the general rule permitting camping on crown land by non-residents. i've done it lots and have never had or seen any restrictions. - phish
549639,bigfish1965,2005-06-22 19:24:00,3210,"Some points to clarify... First the MNR doesn't LET the natives fish with gillnets. The natives were given that right by treaty and disputes are federal and not provincial so the MNR has no jurisdiction over them. Second, any company doing business internationally and using the internet as a sales tool charges in US funds. My web design site, while based in Canada, does about 50% of business with Americans. My charges are displayed in US$."
548879,Guest,2005-06-06 14:50:00,0,"I have been reading this topic and was wondering to everyone how many fish do you need to keep? I think 2 eyes per guy is more then enough for the shore lunch..think about it if you have a group of 8, that 16 fish, plus your sides..more then enough meat. Are you complaining about how many you can take home?? I have to question what is wrong with the walleye in your lakes??? You come to Canada to enjoy the good fishing, friends, family and the wilderness experience. But here is a question..if you everybody (res and non-res) was only allowed to keep 1 walleye a day not allowed to bring any home, would you still come up? Tight Lines Pike Man"
548880,Guest,2005-06-06 14:54:00,0,"I would. I can't remember ever bringing fish back to the States from Canada, but I'm sure I'm the exception."
548884,IaCraig,2005-06-06 16:29:00,434,"Pikeman2, I don't disagree with your sentiment. However why shouldn't I try a new lake with fewer restrictions? Reasons why I plan to: 1. We expect the walleye fishing to be even better 2. We get to explore new lakes 3. I can let my 9 & 11 year old kids keep a fish over 18 instead of letting them all go. (yes, they understand C&R, but they are still kids) 4. If we get a floater, I don't have to let the gulls peck it's eyes out 5. Since the MNR feels the walleye population in the Winnipeg River system is under stress the most conservation minded thing I can do is not fish it for a few years. IaCraig"

549594,Guest,2005-06-21 22:43:00,0,"1-IF the walleye fishing in the River is not as good as it once was, how come they still let the natives commercial it.?? Or even for personal consuption. Same with LOTW. They are selling the fish at a fish plant IN Kenora. 2-Two walleye for a shore lunch should be more than enough given you have fries, beans and the rest of the goodies. Anyone that can eat more than that should go on a diet. 3-Fishing has gotten better on LOTW as I see it since most camps now go catch and release, and in most cases, nothing really even goes home. I can knock off at least 4 resorts who's fish cleaning shacks are not even used from opening until well into July. Only fish kept are those for shorelunch purposes. Plus guys, a northern pike (cleaned right) is just as good if not better, than any walleye anyway. Try learning how to clean them right and see for yourself. 4-Most meat hunters by the way are the locals...I know people IN Kenora who go fishing today, keep their limits, and go out again tomorrow. This goes on week after week, all summer. Not always on LOTW, or the River, but many smaller lakes around here are getting clobbered. 5-I cannot see how the U.S. Tourists are keeping more fish, than locals. They are only here as you all say for what 1 or two weeks a yr. 6-Most Mb. residents I call them locals, They ""might"" (probably do) take more than any U.S. tourist period. 7-IF you want to go fishing in the Wiley Point/Crow Rock areas of LOTW this time of year, better get to a spot early. Like 7am IF you want one. You will have to take a number anytime after that as one or two resorts have the spots tied up for the better part of the day. One boat grabs the good spots, and radio's another just before he is leaving. Cruise around the see that one for yourself. It's fact!! 8-I do not own a boat anymore. Therefore, renting one, then buying gas, bait etc.etc. I am better to buy it at a store for sure. Or heck, go to this fish plant and buy LOTW or River walleye from them. I bet it winds up cheaper in the end. At $1,200US up to $1,600 US at some places, I cannot understand why an American would pay the price anyway. Thats per person American Plan. Mr thinks, that many resorts on LOTW are priceing themselves out of the market, and I can tell you now, more people are going into the Red Lake area than Kenora. and that has been happening for years. sit at the the Junction of 71/11 and count. bye bye"
549595,Guest,2005-06-21 22:55:00,0,"I'll add one more comment, and most lodges will not like this one. You are in Canada. I believe then all lodges, resorts should be charging IN Canadian funds. I know of one lodge on LOTW that even if ""I"" go their as a Kenora resident for dinner, I get charged in U.S. funds. I do not consider then right. Therefore, I will not go, and suggest to many of my friend not to either. Nothing but a rip of on that lodges part. As I say, I really believe that many facilities here on LOTW are coming very very close to pricing themself out of the market. I have checked many sites and price lists, and feel they are way out of line. and yes ladies and gents, I happen to know what it costs to operate a resorts. Right down to the price of nails, 12 in spikes if dock building or cabin building. All resorts here pay their staff IN Canadian, buy supplies IN Canadian, therefore, rates, should be IN Canadian. I bet if they start doing that, you just might see MORE out of province visitors too. I only refer to LOTW here not others in Red Lake or those areas, I do not ave the time to start checking ever web site/price list. Granted many are reasonable, but IF prices are in U. S . Funds, I believe it is all wrong. I mentioned this to Ontario's Sunset Country once and believe it or not, they even agreed. But as they put it, they have no control over prices places change. Just trying to get tourists here into this area. bye bye again."
549600,Trailerguy,2005-06-22 04:37:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Aside from Canadians (who are the minority of customers) feeling offended because resorts charge in US funds, what difference does it make? If the resorts charged Canadian funds they would maintain the same profit margins. They like any other business (oil companys come to mind) charge what the trafic will bear. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
549603,Guest,2005-06-22 06:54:00,0,"The only reason Canadians are the minority, is very few resorts cater to them. I know of only a handful of resorts who go to sport shows IN Canada. Just how many NEW customers do they think they can get from the US yearly. Few Canadian even know where Kenora is or other areas up here for that matter. A market that is highly untapped by our tourism sectors, not only the resorts, but organizations. They might hit a show or two in Mb. but seldom think of Sask, or Alta. If it was not for ""repeat"" U.S customers, 1/2 the resorts would go under."
549604,Guest,2005-06-22 07:03:00,0,"WHO CARE ABOUT THE LIMIT. I DO NOT BRING FISH HOME ANYWAY, EAT THEM UP THERE.

(staying at Northstar) Local - My doubts of accuracy of MNR fish harvest statistics are based on my not been checked even 1 time since I started coming up about 15 years ago. No survey, no creel checks, nothing. If they are not checking me (a foreigner) I doubt if they are checking locals either. Also I'm sure the netting I hear about is exagerated but I've heard some terrible reports of numbers and lack of regulation. Lastly, I might understand your feelings better than you expect. In Iowa our fishing never has been great, but I can relate it to the Iowa Deer hunting. After years of deer management the lean years in Iowa are over and in the last 5-10 the word of our sucess has gotten out that Iowa has trophy bucks. Areas I've hunted most my life have now been purchased by hunt clubs, or are leased hunting only. Scrub timber ground that used to be under $500 per acre is now $1500 - $3000 per acre. We have more poachers than our DNR can possibly catch. I worry about the future of the sport for my sons. Sorry for the rant, but I can relate. Good fishing to all IaCraig"
548791,Guest,2005-06-03 18:14:00,0,"local yokel, You can quote all the stats you want but the bottom line, from my point of view as a resident is that the so-called problem needs to be addressed by all users......res and non-res alike. The idea of different limits for different users is not constructive if the idea of a Tourism Industry has any validity. I, for one, appreciate the american fisherman coming up to NWO to spend some money......I think when the lumber and paper companies finally pull the plug up here, the locals will only be able to fondly remember the benefits the tourism industry ""once had"". You may get your wish....the fishing will be great....no crowds...but you won't be able to afford the gas for your boat. Just my 2 cents."

548834,Guest,2005-06-05 08:14:00,0,"Aaron and Craig, I'll be heading to Minaki on the 23rd. I don't have any major problem with the walleye regs, because I spend 99% of the time on smallies, northern and musky, and we release everything we catch. Unfortunately, that is not the case with others in our groups. For the past 15 years, I've spent two weeks at Minaki, one week with one group of guys and the following week with a different group. However, this year the 2nd group of guys have decided not to go to Minaki any longer, so I'll be meeting them on the Minnesota side of Rainy Lake for that week. The walleye fishing reg change at Minaki was the last straw with these guys, given the other problems, delays and hassles of crossing the border. I'm not really 'thrilled' about being singled out because I'm a non-resident. Because if that logic continues, in another 15 years non-residents might not be able to fish for smallies any more at Minaki, yet residents will. ...makes perfect sense to me! Chuck"
548860,Guest,2005-06-06 07:40:00,0,"Local, when they put higher restrictions on visitors, it becomes a U.S. vs Canada issue. The fishing in Canada is incredible. But it is a hassle to get there with border crossing issues that are constantly brought up on this site. I personally have never been stopped, but there is always that nervous feeling as you approach that this could be a five minute stop, or a 3 hour stop. Beer, leeches, gas, and lodging costs are high and getting higher. And it is not all just the US dollar issues. These prices have gone up for years. I guarantee that the US visitors contribute a substantial amount to that area's economy. We need each other. We want to fish, and you want our money. To make laws to make us feel unwanted, and less will come. Someone will post an intelligent response like ""don't come we don't want you"", but that misses the point. I am certain that the lodge owners, and the hotel owners, and the bait shops... will not want that. I will be up there in a few months. And I will enjoy the trip. But I cannot get my guys to go on a June trip to Canada for the reasons above. We will end up on the second trip in the states. Less fish, but less hassle and cost. All of these responses talk about the local surveys, and how brilliant these scientists are that are managing the lakes. If they are so smart, why is there such a huge issue at Minaki. Should they have not noticed this issue a few years ago?"
548864,Guest,2005-06-06 08:32:00,0,"This issue has been noticed in Minaki for a few years now but the politics of the situation kept getting in the way....the lodge owners pissed and moaned about it until even they began to see the light. It's gotten to this point because something wasn't done sooner. Again, I applaud the decision and am sure it won't prevent anyone from having a great time up there."
548868,IaCraig,2005-06-06 12:10:00,434,"At first the diff between res & non-res possesion limits kind of irked me, but the more I think about it the important thing is that the primary spawning sizes are protected from everyone. (which they are, if you count only recreational anglers) I still interpret these regs as a hint that the fishing is better elsewhere in Ontario, so I plan to broaden my horizens a bit these next few years. IaCraig"
548870,Guest,2005-06-06 13:50:00,0,"Craig....if you only fish for Walleye there are much better places to go up there. Most poeple don't realize how good the smallmouth, pike and musky fishing is on that system though. I'm a die hard smally fisherman and it just gets better every year."
548873,IaCraig,2005-06-06 14:17:00,434,"Good point Aaron, the area does have good variety. I see more muskie fishermen there every year. I target Walleye 95% of the time. But we have fun with pike and smallies too. Since this year isn't a ""guys"" trip, I expect to spend the majority of my time letting my family cast for pike to keep their interest up. Maybe I need to put some bass lures too like bettle spins. This year the focus will be on the kids having fun, so I know casting will get more votes than bottom bouncing. ;) IaCraig"
548788,Guest,2005-06-03 15:39:00,0,"First of all, this is not a Canadian vs. American issue like many want to believe. This is all about user groups and their harvest. Americans happen to be the largest harvest group. Canadians and Americans fish well together and many Americans and Canadians have long lasting relationships and hopefully it will stay this way. So forget this angle of attack! Fish stocks were taken a beaten up here and something had to be done. It's a major contentious issue up here believe me. Years ago, the Ontario government wanted to enter an agreement to control the number of resorts and tourist facilities on Rainy but the Minn. DNR did not want anything to do with it and thumbed their noses at us. The Minnesota side resort usage boomed. We then implemented strategies to control the largest user group because that is where it makes the most difference. Restrictions on having to stay in Ontario were installed to control the heavy nonresident take and from the constant *****ing from the tourist industry. It became apparent that it was against the NAFTA agreement. The lowered limits for non-residents AND residents, along with slot limits, came into effect. The local residents argued in their favor that they were not the cause of the lousy fish stocks. The data proves this. We took cuts and we took slot limits and we watch ever so carefully to what's happening. We have a flourishing fishery once again, imagine that. This will be the way of the future and take a look around how you all are beginning to handle the non-resident situations for hunting and fishing where you live. In North Western Ontario we want to have fish for the future and make that true gold medal stuff. In regards to the border issues. I agree the border sucks, but since the two governments have lumped the border with trade issues we the people who cross the border will suffer from fighting amongst the two sides. The problem is that the unaccountable government systems in place seem to be accelerating the battles so I think we may suffer greatly in the border issues. The world is changing and we are flowing along with lousy relations in this regard. Now to the fish surveys: The surveys we refer to are creel census related and the data is available for most areas that the local MNR have worked on. The example I will give is from the latest data I have on the border waters and the birthplace of the new limits and slots. This data is a compilation from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and the Ontario Ministries of Natural Resources. July 1998. Here is the breakdown of walleye HARVEST on LOTW's excluding Shoal Lake and Buffalo Bay due to no data being available. Total Lake walleye harvest: 816,000 lbs. Nonresident harvest 590,123 lbs or 72.3%: Commercial harvest 173,147 lbs or 21.1%: Native subsistence harvest 36,752 lbs or 4.5%: Ontario Resident 15,298 lbs or 1.9%. Here is a breakdown of walleye Harvest on Rainy Lake. Total Lake walleye harvest: 77,800 lbs. Nonresident harvest 53,213 lbs or 68%: Native subsistence harvest 10,315 lbs or 13%: Ontario Resident harvest 8,918 lbs or 11%: Commercial harvest 8,918 lbs or 7%. Here is a breakdown of walleye Harvest on Namakan and Sand Point Lakes. Total Lake walleye harvest: 32,000 lbs. Nonresident harvest 25,600 lbs or 79.8%: Commercial harvest 6,410 lbs or 19.9%: Ontario Resident harvest 90 lbs or .2%. The interior lakes are somewhat worse because tourism has claimed all the good lakes up here. The amount of Ontario residents is a paltry nothing compared to the Non residents that use the remote areas. Most Ontario residents do not use fly inn outposts. Another growing problem is the increase of private individuals buying and leasing up cabins and so called cloaked tourism. These are usually rich dudes like your past senator Bob Lessard that build giant lodges where small low usage outpost cabins once stood and they are using them heavily to cater to their buddies and customers. What really makes this worse is that these kind of individuals are the most vocal at insisting that majors controls to block the local usage which is negligible to start with to non existent. This kind of behavior has festered up where many establishments are flaunting money to control all access to the interior water bodies. It's a disgusting trend for a resident. On top of that situations like the moose tag lottery system which was designed for a 10 % non resident harvest has being quietly readjusted where in areas close by have between twenty and thirty per cent of the tags now given to the tourism industry. This is unacceptable and is a frightening trend. Now devour all that, and close your eyes and imagine you are a long resident that lived here because it was your lifestyle and it has been for generations for your family. You hunt and fish and that's why you live here. Everywhere you look are non-residents. They are taking over most of the good turf and lakes up here because you guys have some serious money, which we do not have. We know the four lanner is coming to International Falls and we know what that will mean. We are already being forced into the towns because the property valves are out of control. None of our kids want to stay here anymore. They all leave for somewhere else. Tourism acts and broadcasts that they are the most important industry up here, buts it's an inflated lie. Tourism does not keep our kids with us at all. Quite the contrary. It's the major supporter of low minimum wages and most of the money does not reach the people. It's a lie. Keep thos eyes closed for a while and thin about how you would feel about this if you were us. Come up and enjoy our fishing and hopefully bond with a local. Eat your fish and even leave with a few especially if you stay here for a few days, because you can build your limit to the same possession limit of four like us. Just remember that you are a foreigner here and we have to control your overwhelming harvest on the resource and mostly, enjoy yourself. Local Yokel"

548704,Guest,2005-06-02 05:38:00,0,"The survey says "" 65 to 95 per cent"" of the fisherman in North Western Ontario are non-resident anglers. Why should we locals take drastic cuts in our limits, when it is the non-residents which are depleteing the stocks. With attitudes like feed the coons, and smuggle fish, I hope we get smarter and introduce the aggregate bag limit of two fish TOTAL per day soon. I know it's coming and it will bring a smile to my face once we have it secured and in place. By the way our fines are rising dramactiaclly and soon if we catch you blatantly disobeying our rules, you will forfiet everything you have and we will drop you off at the border empty handed with a huge fine to boot. Is that simple enough! Some think they can come here and act like they own the place. Not anymore bud. If you don't like our methods to control the largest user groups definately don't come here. The regular locals could care less including me. Fish pigs stay home! Conservation minded anglers we welcome thee! local yocal."

548707,Guest,2005-06-02 07:20:00,0,"Local....I agree 100%. I know several of the lodge owners up on the Winnipeg River system are not happy about these new regs (and one even thinks his resort is the reason for the rules...what an ego..LOL) but what they fail to realize is that the better the fishery the more poeople will want to come there to fish...heck, next thing you know they might be able to charge more than $35/night to get people to come stay with them. I can rememeber a time when that system was as productive as LS."
548711,Matches,2005-06-02 07:48:00,236,"How soon they forget. The regulations all had to do with the NAFTA Agreement in 1999 when the US was complaining about Canada's requirement of staying overnight to be able to keep a limit of fish. If they didn't have the two a day limit, you would have many crossing the border for just the day, taking a limit of fish, and going back to the US.

548732,Hammerhead Herb,2005-06-02 10:35:00,259,"When I see people use data like  survey says 65 to 95 per cent' of the fisherman , I recall the old saying about Figures don't lie, however liars do figure. When MNR sez that the reason for imposing a limit because 65% of the people fishing in Ontario are from the US, that to me is so close to 50-50 that both residents and non-residents have the same effect on the fishery and all fishermen should be required to go to a 2 fish limit. To say that 95% of the fishermen in Ontario are from the US, you are saying that 19 out of 20 people in the rivers, lakes, streams, etc are from the US; I'm don't believe that is what you see in the real world. Even if you say that is the case, a person in the 95% non-resident population (for one week) would have less of an effect on the fishery that a peron in the 5% population (for 20 weeks - May-Sept). You can't legitimately base data and make decisions on numbers that give a span of '65% to 95%'. My beef is not with the conservation aspect of the lowered limit, but with the MNR politicians' hypocrisy and lack of backbone on this issue; a real demonstration of backbone would be if MNR reduced the possession limit for residents and nonresidents alike - but that would upset the voters (i.e. lack of backbone). I take exception to the hypocrisy of limiting the non-resident 'meathogs' but letting the resident 'meathogs' stay at the trough. With your 4-5 months of fishing, logic would dictate that locals would have a greater effect on the fishery than an out of state/province fisherman who takes 4 walleye instead of 2 across the border If the fishery is actually hurting and the politicians want to hose the tourist, raise the price of the non-resident license and use those extra monies to build a fish hatchery. That is what normally done to 1. improve the fishery and 2. hose the tourist in other states or provinces."
548733,Guest,2005-06-02 10:56:00,0,Newsflash! Rumor has it a group of 7 just came back from your sewer pit and kept and cleaned over 100 fish and pitched the little ones in the bush so they wouldnt have stunted growth Your biased rules are not working.
548653,Guest,2005-06-01 07:33:00,0,"Agree with these new regs for the Winnipeg river system or not it's clear that the MNR believes there is a problem there. Having been a cabin owner up there for 15 years now I've seen this fishery get worse every year with regards to the quality of walleye fishing (although the smallmouth bass and musky seem to be getting better every year). It deosn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that it's the nonresident fisherman's (including me) daily catch limit that needs to be restricted as I'm more than certain that the yearly consumption of walleye on that system comes mostly from nonresidents. Yes, I to wish it was the good old days when you could keep six fish a day and bring enough home to feed your family and friends for a few weeks but we are talking about saving a fishery for future generations to enjoy. If it takes making that system strictly catch and release to get us back to the good old days I'm all for it. ""New regulations restricting size and catch limits for walleye anglers on the Winnipeg River have been approved and will go into effect beginning Jan. 1. The Ministry of Natural Resources wants anglers to be well aware of the upcoming rule changes as they begin ice fishing on the river this winter. In addition to a media advertisement blitz beginning this week, conservation officers will also be out on the ice talking to Winnipeg River fishermen and providing them with education material on the changes. There's a real need to let people know of the regulation change that is coming up, said MNR biologist for the Kenora west area, Scott McAughey. It's going to have a fairly significant impact in terms of fish anglers can keep. The new regulations, which apply to both residents and non-residents, includes a slot size allowing anglers to keep only walleye 35 to 45 centimetres long as well as one over 70 cm. The catch and possession limits remain unchanged for residents, who can continue to take home a combination of four walleye or sauger on a sport licence, or two on a conservation licence. For non-residents, the catch and possession limit has been reduced to two walleye or sauger for a sport licence and one on a conservation licence. That's something that will impact both resident and non-resident anglers, said McAughey of the size restrictions. He stressed only the catch and possession limits will apply to saugers, not the slot size restrictions. Like the current regulations, anglers will be able to keep all sizes of saugers with only one allowed over 46 cm. McAughey said he is not worried about local anglers making the determinations between the two species but non-resident anglers may require further education. It's going to be a bit of a learning experience for people, said McAughey. A 2002 creel survey done by the MNR showed most saugers on the Winnipeg River are less than 35 cm in length and, as a result, over 75 per cent would have to released if following the same size restrictions as walleye. McAughey also noted that the new regulations apply to the entire Winnipeg River system from the outflow of the Lake of the Woods to the Manitoba border including the following lakes: Middle, Gun, Pistol, Lost, Hidden, Little Sand, Big Sand, Roughrock, Swan, Tetu and Eaglenest. People may not be aware that all of those water bodies are part of the Winnipeg River, said McAughey. And these regulation changes apply to all of those water bodies. The new regulations are the result of a two-year study by the Winnipeg River Fisheries Advisory Committee  a committee composed of representatives of the river's user groups including the tourism industry, local First Nations, resident anglers, cottagers and commercial anglers -- indicating walleye harvest levels on the river were unsustainable. In addition, a 2003 netting survey indicated that the walleye population was showing signs of stress as a single year class of young two-year-old fish made up more than 50 per cent of the total catch. McAughey said while the catch rates were still reasonable on the river, the average size was quite small with many anglers keeping walleye as small as eight inches in length. When the fishing gets poor, anglers keep smaller and smaller fish, said McAughey. Seeing eight-inch walleyes in an angler's live well is a pretty good indication that something is amiss. McAughey said the new slot size of 35-45 cm was the size most anglers wanted and would prevent them from harvesting mature spawning females, needed for sustainability of the fishery. He said while ensuring the sustainability of the fishery is the main concern, the MNR must also weigh the impact management decisions might have on the local economy due to its effects to the tourism industry on the Winnipeg River. At the end of the day if you can improve the fishery and still allow (non-residents) to catch and eat fish while they are here, they will go home happy, said McAughey. We think (the new rules) will be palatable, but at the same time it will prevent anglers from keeping mature female walleyes."

(for all species) is this what you are refering to?? What waters are you discussing?? FYI the ODNR never checks Canadian boats here only ones with MI. tags. Oh well, our DNR most likley treats the Canadians the same when they fish our waters."
548607,MJ,2005-05-31 13:51:00,11,What about Gull Rock? Any restrictions?

548610,Guest,2005-05-31 14:26:00,0,"Are you referring to a ""conservation"" license versus a regular sportfishing license? In general a conservation lic has about 1/2 the posession limit of a sportfishing license(e.g., 2 walleye/day versus 4). I've never seen any differentiation between resident and non-resident except the fee. I thought possession limits were the same and a function of license type not residency. Has this changed for '05?"
548619,Reels,2005-05-31 16:13:00,2876,"No, Minaki has special regs that started this season. Merc, I understand what your saying, but don't let two fish ruin your trip. Your talking about another $10 at the grocery store if you want to buy two more walleyes. Paradise cove states in their news letter they will have walleye for sale for those wanting to take more home purchased from a commercial seller. Not sure I agree with that, but it is an option. <{{}}><"
548620,fishmaster,2005-05-31 17:00:00,209,I agree with Trailerguy you can keep 4 fish with a reg license and 2 with a conservation license. I have seen the fishing get better over the years and if this what it takes where ever you fish so be it. I would rather go and catch 50-100 fish and only be able to keep 2 or 4 than go and catch 10 fish all day. The fish are also getting bigger with the slot size in Canada. I myself hope they keep it the way they have it as of now. Works for me!!!!
548623,Reels,2005-05-31 17:06:00,2876,"In Minaki it is now 2 fish max for non resident. 1 for conservation. Now if you have two at the upper limit of the slot, no biggie, but you have two 14"" dinks, you might be a little hungry after shore lunch. Also, a dad taking his 12 year old son, will have to now buy a liscence for his son, if they want enough to eat for lunch. Some people think that you can still keep 4 for shore lunch. I can not find anything supporting that and our resort owner says, no, only two a day. If someone has something showing we can keep 3 or for for lunch, please let us know. Would like to have that option. So, yeah, it kinda stinks. But if the fishery gets better, than thats ok by me. <{{}}><"
548566,Guest,2005-05-31 08:37:00,0,2 walleye for non-res 13.8 to 17.7 ...hope those slots ar biting to get some shore lunch or dinner...looks like the reorts want to protect their tournament fishing...time to look in Minnesota
548567,Trailerguy,2005-05-31 08:41:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]Could you be a little more specific? It's hard to follow.
548569,Guest,2005-05-31 08:46:00,0,"Well it has more to do with Ministry of Natural resources who do fish counts in areas to see if they need to impliment restrictions like that to protect the fish stalks as well improve them for the future.There is not a whole lot of walleye tournaments up here, more bass, so I do not think that this is the reason.And for me its more about how many fish I caught not killed, when I go out."
548570,Guest,2005-05-31 09:14:00,0,It's called protecting the fishery.....good luck in Minnesota.
548577,Guest,2005-05-31 10:17:00,0,You mean saving fish for the netters?

548584,Guest,2005-05-31 11:18:00,0,"Unlike some people, I don't get to fish every day. And as fishing for sport, I think it is a good idea...But when you work for a living and want to go go out for some relaxation of fishing, and enjoyment of friends and family...I just think it's a little ridiculous to have Non-res at 2 and Res at 4 (for walleye) ....Shame on me for not checking earlier, yes it's my fault...but I will make the best of it. I dont't catch fish just to catch fish, I also enjoy eating fish...I dont waste them, or catch over my limit...If I'm driving all that way, with gas prices the way they are, and spending alot of money in Canada, which helps out their economy... I just don't like it...and that just is my opinion....and I know that it is very good for the Sport fisherman who get to go out almost everyday....but I work all year just for a trip like this, and I don't think a river system that big will get depleted of walleye....but maybe I'm wrong....anyway, I'm going to stay in Minnesota after this year and start saving for Alaska....I have really enjoyed fishing Canada, and I love it there....Good luck to everyone....and Happy Fishing"
548586,Guest,2005-05-31 11:27:00,0,I agree with merc - For people who get 1 or 2 trips a year this restriction is a joke - Thats why there is no limit on shore lunches and how many you can sneak across the border or simply throw in the brush for the racoons to eat
548587,Guest,2005-05-31 11:32:00,0,For crying outload people....there is no restriction on the number of fish you are allowed to catch. You aren't going to eat more than 2 walleye a day anyway. If you can't live by the rules than by all means just stay home. Trust me....with a two fish limit per day you aren't going to go hungry and the fish don't know there are limits so it won't have any impact on your ability to catch fish and have a good time.
