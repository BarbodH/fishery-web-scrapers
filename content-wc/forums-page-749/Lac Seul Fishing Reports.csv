549612,Guest,2005-06-22 08:42:00,0,I have been going to Lac Seul the past few years (leaving July 8) and always enjoyed reading the weekly fishing reports from Mike at Silver Water Wheel and Gary at Evergreen. For some reason I haven't seen any reports from either of these guys this year on any of my usual web sites. Are either of these guys still putting out a weekly or biweekly fishing report? If so where can I veiw the report. Does anyone else publish a weekly or biweekly report on Lac Seul? Thanks for any information.

The best bite is in 8 to 12 ft water on jig/minnow. Leechs and worms have been OK. Water temp is rising fast and fish may slip deeper with the sunlight. The bottom Bouncer bite in deeper water should pick up soon. The early warm wheather has the fish spread out and has affected their transistion to main lake. Fish slow and work drops on windy points. Fish seem to be holding best on small rock and sandy areas while big rock has been spotty.
