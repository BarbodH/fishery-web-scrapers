549642,1shooter,2005-06-22 20:18:00,1493,Blake where were you fishing out of?
549509,1shooter,2005-06-20 20:22:00,1493,Last year when we were fishing out the of Morson area. The resort we were at had very small minnows (kind of like crappie minnows). I heard it was due to something but don't remember. Anyone been up to that area recently and recall if they had decent size minnows for bait???
549510,Trailerguy,2005-06-20 20:30:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]The size of the minnows usually changes as the summer progresses. Shortly after ice out minnows are very small, but plentiful. By fall they are much larger but fewer in number."
549513,1shooter,2005-06-20 21:12:00,1493,So what about now? We will be going up in a couple of weeks.
549514,Guest,2005-06-20 21:20:00,0,Last week we had small to medium sizes. Didn't matter as we still got tons of 23-28 inchers. Have a great time.
549526,Guest,2005-06-21 06:24:00,0,"Hey Shooter1, Where are you going in the Morrison area? We used to go to Moonlite Bay for a week each summer. I guess maybe 7 years in all. That owner always supplied smaller minnows--more plentiful and cheaper he said. We always had great walleye and crappie fishing with the smaller ones, but I have to admit that my boat partner and I would periodically argue about who always got the bigger minnows out of the bucket. We always took leeches with us, even though the owner provided minnows. We found that sometimes leeches would outcatch the walleye 3 to 1, especially those years when it was extremely hot and calmer. Chuck"
549530,1shooter,2005-06-21 07:22:00,1493,Were going to Grassy Narrows Lodge. This will be our 2nd year. The owners are great and so our the accommodations.http://www.morsonoutfitters.com/grassy/ I had heard last year the minnows were small due to some of the ponds that they catch them in washing out. Not sure if that's true or not. Were going up 7/8.
549532,Guest,2005-06-21 07:35:00,0,"Morisson is a great area to fish. Nice walleye, northern, smallies and musky. I remember one early July when it was extremely hot, the big walleye were committing suicide on crawdad colored shadrap cast into 1 to 2' of water. We couldn't believe it--we had to jerk the raps away from the smaller eyes so the big boys had a chance to hit. However, after 3 days of loosing lots of raps, but catching tons of nice big walleye, the bid price for a shad rap in camp hit $10(US). [Everyone at the resort thought we were crazy for offering to buy them for that price. However, little did they know what we were doing....] I don't think we even used 5 dozen minnows or leeches that whole trip! Chuck"
549565,1shooter,2005-06-21 12:33:00,1493,Do you know of any bait shops close to there that might have a better selection of minnows versus the resort we are staying at?
549574,Guest,2005-06-21 14:37:00,0,"The store on the way to the government dock used to have minnows out back. I don't know what size they typically have however. There was also a baitshop just southwest of where the bay from the government dock opens into the big bay, It had a concrete pad out front where the float planes would sometimes stop and get minnows. Cruise along the shoreline and you'll see it. Chuck"
549575,rockpt,2005-06-21 15:09:00,589,Are you referring to Buena Vista? That's where Grassy gets their minnows.
