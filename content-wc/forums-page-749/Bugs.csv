Next time you head north, smear your entire body with bear grease, wear a necklace of garlic and be sure to have a crucifix and a mallet & wooden stake handy, just in case they get REAL ornery. And don't wash the bear grease off until you get home. They'll sometimes track you back south, then it's all over. Another trick is to bring a brother-in-law or some other pain-in-the butt, strip him and tie him to a tree as a sacrifice. (Old guide trick.)"

We now have started to call them ""Langoliers"", referencing a Stephen King novel by that name where there were unknown, unseen creatures that gobbled up all of reality with their voracious appetites.

This year we went last week (we just got back Saturday) AND 2 years ago I went this same week (got bit then too). BOY. When I was putting the cover on my boat I got nailed. I just stopped itching today. They only hurt at first but a day or 2 later they itch like HE77. I have probably 150 bites on my legs and some on my arms. They didn't get me through my clothes (too small I guess). I would bet DEET would stop them.
549592,rebelrn2001,2005-06-21 22:00:00,1563,"Did a search...this is what I found. WHAT IS A NO-SEE-UM? No-see-ums are tiny biting flies that often live near water. You often see many of themswarming together in a cloud. Keep your mouth shut or you might breathe some in or swallow them! (It won't hurt you, but it will probably make you cough.) Biting midges are called no-see-ums because they're so tiny that it is hard to see um. No-see-ums are less than ¼ of an inch long. WHERE DO NO-SEE-UMS LIVE? They often stay in shrubs or the thick layer of dead leaves that naturally covers the ground. Scrubbing your feet around in the leaves is a good way to get them stirred up. Don't do it! Most no-see-ums never fly more than 350 feet from their breeding area, so if they're bothering you, you might be able to get away from them by moving a few yards WHY DO NO-SEE-UMS BITE? Only the females bite and suck blood. They need the protein in this blood to make their eggs. No-see-ums will take blood from mammals, birds, and reptiles. Male no-see-ums are nectar feeders and do not bite. While the bite is not painful, it becomes very itchy. Some people get a red spot 1-2 inches wide! Try not to scratch the bites; it makes them itch longer and can make the bites get infected. No-see-um larvae (babies) can be found in water, mud, or moist dead leaves. They especially like to live in the dying plants along the edge of a salt marsh. The larvae eat dead plant and animal matter. HOW CAN YOU AVOID NO-SEE-UM BITES? The best way to avoid getting bitten by no-see-ums is to wear insect repellent when you are outside in the spring, summer, and fall. Also, move quickly away from the areas where they're swarming. If you get far enough away, they won't follow you."
