549559,Guest,2005-06-21 10:51:00,0,"We don't change our walleye fishing tactics when fishing in Canada except in extreme cases. It is not uncommon for 2, 3 or more 'mild' fronts to pass thru an area in Canada, during a full day of fishing, and the walleye seem to be accustomed to it. However, after a very-very severe front(accompanied by a major change in wind direction and strong winds, heavy rains, rapid drop in temps, severe lightning, etc.) you will often find walleye have moved to deeper water and will be reluctant to bite (especially the next day if there are bright blue skies). What we do then is fish the river and larger feeder streams for our walleye for a day or so -- they don't seem to be as nearly affected. If you are looking for smallies after a very severe front moves thru, check the first or second noticable drop-off on the shorelines you had been previously fishing. Use heavier tube jigs and deeper diving crankbaits to find active smallies. Jig vertically in deeper water on the points with smaller twister tails and lighter jigs. Slow down presentions and focus more on triggering reaction type strikes, by periodically lightly-twitching your rod tip--but still maintain a slow retrieve. Sometimes a light 4"" worm rigged on a lighter jig will be deadly at these times--cast it out and let it fall slowly and as horizontal as possible. We haven't noticed much of a change in northern patterns due to cold fronts. They will often still be fairly active in the same locations as before, so stay with the same presentation and lures.
