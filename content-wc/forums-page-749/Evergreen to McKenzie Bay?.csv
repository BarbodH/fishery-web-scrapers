549493,Guest,2005-06-20 15:06:00,0,Sawmill is 15 minutes on good water McKenzie is 45 to an hour. We've been going to Evergreen for 10 years and never found the need to go to Mckenzie. But it might just be great down there.
549495,Guest,2005-06-20 15:20:00,0,Do you make a regular visit to Sawmill?

549597,Guest,2005-06-21 23:58:00,0,"Hi. when we went to LS we went to sawmill almost everyday that and the fals area. saw mill was about a 40 minute ride in the lodge type boat. Of course on the way home the waves were never co-operative. inside you would think the weather and waves were fine but once you got back out on the lake things could be ""bad"". Mckenzie is half way down the lake. before I would go there I would go below the dam. lots of gooooooooood fishing there. and I dont think they have a slot limit there either. good luck."
549609,Guest,2005-06-22 07:55:00,0,We stayed at Evergreen last week an with the 50HP motors and good water I would say it is still 15 to 20 minutes to the mouth of Sawmill. We did not go into Sawmill this year as we did do much up in there last year. I wouldn't go up there at all after the 2 or 3rd week in June. Water temps were in the low to mid 60's and spinners will be going soon if not already. Got lots of 10 to 12 inch fish with a few in and over the slot. 16 to 18 inch fish were very hard to find. Good Luck and say HI to Pat & Gary.
