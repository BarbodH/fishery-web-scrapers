548968,Larry S,2005-06-08 21:02:00,666,"Went to Dearden the last 2 years did great. Ryan put in a new portage to Springer Lake last year.We helped him put it in,and fished it 3 times. Caught hundreds of eyes and pike. Got 3 pike over 40 inches on Dearden two years ago. We were going to go to Ryans new lake at Blackbirch,but need 6 people and we only could get 4. Planning on going there next year.Going to a new outfitter,Wesley Outposts out of Pickle Lake June 17th this year Larry S"

549632,Guest,2005-06-22 16:28:00,0,"Just got back from fishing Dearden out of Northern Outposts. As usual, Ryan and Kathy Brady had everything in terrific shape. We had really tough walleye conditions. Bluebird skies every day. The first part of the week was cool and very windy (from Northeast). Second half was hot (90 degrees) with no wind. It didn't matter. Our group of eight caught hundreds of walleyes. The number over 20"" was too many to count. Biggest walleye was just under 26"". Dozens 23-25"". Never fished for pike, but got 2 - 40"", 2 in the upper 30's, and several 30-35"". The best part about fishing Dearden (besides the size and number of walleyes)is that you get very few snake northerns. I'd love to head back up there today!"
