545571,Guest,2005-02-05 13:35:00,0,Looking for fishing reports from Press Lake (north of Ignace) the last few years. We are considering making a trip there and would like some help deciding when the best fishing time of the summer would be. Any info on the walleye/northern fishing would be greatly appreciated and maybe help us decide. Thanks again.

I was never there mid-season, but with the lake being part of the Enlish River system, the fishing should not suffer mid-summer. I know some guys, fishing buddies on a different trip, that go up to Press at least once each year. They will go to Press before any place else."
