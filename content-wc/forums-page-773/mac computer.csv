Basically I'm computer illiterate and would be using the future machine for email, putting out a newsletter occasionally, dabling with digital photography....possibly other small business uses that will occur to me later. To say I am frustrated with the present setup....ad cr*p and viruses is an understatement....a wireless setup would also be good as I've come close to firing the whole thing out the window for silly things like the mouse wire getting tangled (I did say I was frustrated right?). I'm spending way to much time trying to get this pile of cr*p to work....or trying to remember how to do things on it that I do infrequently. I've briefly looked at the Imac g5 or I thought the mac mini seemed interesting as well....a lot of options for each though which has me confused....combo drive vs. ? etc. Any suggestions out there would be greatly appreciated. Don't want this to become a Mac vs pc thread....I think I would buy a typewriter before buying another pc. Thanks in advance. Benny D."

Of course, Windose has stolen most of the look and feel of the Mac over the years, so many PC users look at a Mac and can't see what the big hubbub is about. I just prefer them, period. And as far as the virus' and spyware etc., it does see that the Mac isn't really a priority for the hacker crowd....Microsoft is enemy #1. In 10 years of Mac ownership, I've had one little virus called Garfield, and I disposed of it in about 5 minutes. You can get a new iMac for about a grand Canadian....sounds like a good deal to me."

I was a die-hard PC guy until I started organizing my digital pictures and working with video. Mac does it much, much better and much, much easier. If you're looking for a desktop, the G5 is the way to go. It's expandable like a PC (RAM, drives, cards, etc) but it's still a Mac. If you're looking for a laptop then go with the PowerBook (not the iBook). They come in various sizes (12"", 15"", 17""). You'll want a ""superdrive"" that will burn CD's and DVD's. You'll want a minimum of 512mb of RAM. If you get the G5 tower I recommend about 2gb of RAM. Hard-drive space is at a premium for a laptop, you can always buy a huge hard-drive that hooks up via USB 2.0 or Firewire. Check out Amazon.com, they have nice rebates on their laptops right now which is about the only way you'll get them for less $$. Good luck! Scott"
