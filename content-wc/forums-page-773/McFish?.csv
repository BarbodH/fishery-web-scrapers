545421,Guest,2005-01-28 10:43:00,0,Why even bother trying something like that? Seems to be not worth the hassle or the expense. Very Uncool.

Why wou you think we would condem a whole state population for the actions of a few individuals? Most other folks don't put too much importance on which state someone is from."

545831,GR8WTHUNTER,2005-02-19 18:01:00,618,"Stupidity only begins to describe it. Over the years, there have been many guys I went north with that wanted to bring back scores of filets. I always tell them that it is not worth the trouble and that I wasn't planning to bring any back. From the time we pack the truck until it is unloaded in the driveway, 22 hours or more for us, they are thawed. I would have fresh fillets."
