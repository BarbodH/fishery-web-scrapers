What camp is the best place to stay,what fish species are available.Any comments appreciated.Thanks SARG"

Back then it had no slot limit, not sure if it does today or not. We caught alot of walleyes but nothing of any size. We stayed at Cedar Point Resort and liked it. I think it has new owners since then. Keystone Resort also looked nice. Just my .02."

It is a good drive to lake, and there are several other smaller lakes close by if you catch a windy day. Obviously it's not as hot as Lac Suel, but it certianly has it's days. Resorts have varying accomadations and proximity to favorite spots, depending on what your needs are."

One of the cleanest, well maintained camps I have ever seen, GREAT PEOPLE, however the fishing was so/so. We were up the last week of June, just as the weather was calming down. Lots of 12-14"" smallies. Walleye's were hard to find, the largest our group of 10 caught was 20"". Granted, it's hard fishing a new lake and we are not pros, but we expected to catch more fish. The rest of the guests had pretty much the same luck from what we could tell. Our next trip will probably be back to Lac Suel. JMHO......"
545959,Guest,2005-02-26 11:43:00,0,"Cedar lake is a fantastic lake, and can be very productive. The walleye, northern and Muskie fishing is fantastic in the spring and muskie picks up again in early fall. Ive stayed at cedar point resort when Roger and Carrol owned it. (i think they sold it recently) and we had a great time. Its a small lake, compared to Eagle or LOTW or Lac Seul. but can be very productive. If you go and stay on that side of the lake, e-mail me before, we have some spots, not on any hot-spot map that produce nice fish consistantly. [email protected] Danny"
545967,Guest,2005-02-27 01:05:00,0,Have been to Cedar Lake three times. Has very good smallmouth fishing on west side of lake. Have never had a lot of luck with walleye or pike there but am not a pro. I do know that it's very well known for above average muskie fishing but have never pursued them...don't have the patience. You will catch fish there but will have to work at it. Have stayed at Jerrie and Ellie's Cedar Lake Camp and it is the cleanest camp I've come across. You will run across other boats on lake but I don't think it's overcrowded.
545990,nitroman,2005-02-28 20:58:00,368,"our everchanging group is going up for our 11th season at cedar lake this year(my 6th year). There are alot of walleye there once you find them we have a few holes mapped that have been consistant producers for us every year. I caught my first trophy musky there last year(50 incher) and our group has caught alot of musky and large northern there as well. Most walleye run in the 14""-20"" range with some 23""-30"" every now and then. It's probably and average lake compared to some but i like it and i know it so i will continue to go there we stay at cedar point resort and roger did sell it last year to ray and kathi peiffer they are nice couple and they are doing a good job. they have upgraded all the boats and motors for this year to 2005 models. can't wait to see them again only 94 more days woohoo!"
