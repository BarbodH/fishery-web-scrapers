He stopped guiding after suffering a coronary. The heart attack didn't prevent him from walking out of the hospital before being officially discharged so that he and another guide could head out into the forest and chop white pine by hand and then go about constructing a log cabin for his mother. We shared a few cocktails over the years with Harold who has since passed on. Meanwhile, one year I was driving out with Ernie on the Clova Rd. My truck broke down (and I ended up spending a month in Maniwaki one weekend). Ernie hitched a ride into town, secured a tow truck for me and got me out. I still have his hat. I think we'll stop for fries next time through."
545975,Guest,2005-02-28 08:08:00,0,Does anyone tow a boat in like an 18' Lund Fisherman to O'Sullivan?
546012,Guest,2005-03-01 16:42:00,0,"oh yeah, you just need to have your trailer ""tricked-out"" with all the necessary safeguards. a couple of years ago a 4-some from montreal pulled in with 2 beautiful lunds w/huge motors and they had custome trailers with ""gas shocks"", re-inforced everything, springs, etc. we were amazed, and they made it into camp as fast as one would make with just a 4-wheel drive vehicle, i.e., 2.5 hours. they said they go places most every weekend and ""can't let tough roads get in their way""!!! it was amazing."
545858,JBfishdog,2005-02-21 15:16:00,9,"Can somebody give me an idea of the changes that have been made at O'Sullivan Lake ? I have not been there since '96 or '97 and have heard that the new owners have done some great things at the lake. I have a trip planned for June 11th this year and just would like to get some idea of what might be different. Cabin Fever is killing me, I need to daydream. John"
545902,Guest,2005-02-23 12:24:00,0,"you'll be pleased with the changes to name a few: russell has increased the walleye minimum size twice since you were there. now at 17 inches, the lake is full of them and larger. my buddy caught a 34-inch 10 lb. 10oz. prize 2 years ago. the cabins are well maintained, and the docks have been replaced as well. there is now also a jeep forever parked at the north end of the lake to take you to armentier for trophy pike fishing instead of the former canoe trip required. the motors are new each year and the overall service is impeccable!! its a great place and we can't wait to get there either. in fact we'll be there the same week beginning 11 june, cabins 1 and 2. stop in and say hello!!"
545910,Guest,2005-02-23 18:22:00,0,"I second the sentiment on O'Sullivan. Since '97, I've seen a steady increase in average size and quantity of walleye each year. Pike and trout, especially the former up in Klatouche and Armentier seem to have improved as well. Several years ago, to get out and fish earlier, we started eating breakfast in the Lodge. It's cheap (5 American), good and quick. Russell upgraded most of the cabins. Service is always great: two years ago, I broke a trailer spring on the Clova Road on the way in 25 miles shy of camp. Russell fetched the boat with us and fixed it that week (while I fished) using two new springs he brought in from Maniwaki and charged me only for the parts. I'll see you there the same week, with Bruce and loud crew in 1 and 2. Come by. If this sounds like an advertisement, it's not, so to any ""monitors"" reading, just go relax. Andy"
545916,Guest,2005-02-24 04:43:00,0,"The important changes have been in the way the lake is managed. It is, after all, an ideal habitat for big walleye and big pike. The numbers are outstanding, as well. The facilities are well-maintained and you can't beat the service. The beds are a bit more comfortable, the cabins are in better shape and the over-all camp management seems to be better. That said, it's the fishing that brings us back year after year and the days when meat hunters would pack the coolers full of fillets have been curtailed. Policies that discourage the killing of big pike along with the encouraged use of circle hooks and dead bait and catch-and-release give every angler the opportunity to have a photo snapped alongside a 20 lb plus northern. In the 25 years I've fished O'Sullivan, I can say that the best fishing days I've ever experienced have come in the last five years including my biggest pike ever and the most walleye boated in one day. My only complaint is that one week is way too short."
545931,Guest,2005-02-24 11:57:00,0,"jbfishdog, some pretty good reports eh? i know thunderstick is a regular as he stated and andy and my comments are genuine as well. incidently, andy is who caught the prize walleye mentioned above. we love the place and again can't wait to pull into camp and get out on that beautiful lake!! see you in june!!"
545936,Guest,2005-02-24 15:32:00,0,"Thank you very much for the feed back, you guys sound pumped up! I will stop by, thanks for the invite. Not sure if we will be in Saturday or if we are going to spend the night in Maniwaki and Drive in early Sunday. I think I'm in Cabin 5, Russell and I were having a bit of a communication problem. One more question : Is Ernie Davis still Guiding up there ? Had some pretty interesting times with him."
545942,Guest,2005-02-25 10:07:00,0,"Would you guy be discussing the O Sullivan Lake north of Aroland and Nakina? I fished there last summer and stayed at O Sullivan Lake Lodge. I thought that there were only two lodges on the lake, Osullivan Lake Lodge and O sullivan Rainbow Lake Lodge?? Fishing for walleye was great. It certainly was not the Hilton though."
545944,JBfishdog,2005-02-25 13:15:00,9,"No the one we are speaking about is in Quebec, north of Maniwaki. John"
545955,Guest,2005-02-26 08:40:00,0,Thanks for the reply. Your O Sullivan sounds like a bit nicer accomodations. The Ontario O Sullivan has some great walleye fishing. I understand the lake trout is good also. Pike were many as well. Good luck next summer! Sounds like a nice vacation.
545965,Guest,2005-02-26 16:45:00,0,"JBFISHDOG: Bad news on the Ernie front; he does not guide there anymore, but you can catch him selling burgers and fries out of a short Blue School Bus (really) on the left as you head through Maniwaki. He is still a great guy to talk fishing with and a good friend. I bet we had the same good times with him that you did. Good Old Ernie. See you at cabin 1 or 2. And yes...we are PUMPED to get on the Lake. Just 106 days to go..."
