I have been to Canada every year for the past 10 years, but have always gone the middle to the end of June. How does the fishing compare? Do you catch as many fish? how about size? techniqes? locations?. Any information will be greatly appreciated. Thanks"

545994,Guest,2005-03-01 05:15:00,0,"Briar, We fish late May in to early June at Minaki. If the water temp is normal i.e. upper 50's, then the fishing is great for all species. If there is a cooler than normal spring, then the smallmouth will not be up shallow much. Walleye fishing is good regardless. They will be shallow to 30 feet deep. Pike fishing is also good regardless of water temp. My favorite scenario is stable weather and 3-4 degrees F warmer than normal air temp, with water temp pushing 60, with about 1 foot higher than normal water flow. We use tubes and cranks for the smallmouth mainly. Good luck, Don"
