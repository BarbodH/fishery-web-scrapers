545901,Guest,2005-02-23 11:56:00,0,I am trying to locate Todd in Wisconsin. He is a school principal and he gave me info. on the Pipestone River and Horseshoe Lake. He fished it in I think 2001 and shared some info. with me. Just wanted to touch bases with him as he was a great source of info. and I appreciated it very much.
