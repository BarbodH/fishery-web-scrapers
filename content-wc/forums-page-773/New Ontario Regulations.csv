545829,Guest,2005-02-19 07:42:00,0,"It should have been done years ago...although you will notice an improvement in the quality of fishing within 2 years! Life span of walleye is the key here and the more breeders that are available the better. Small ones are always best for eating and NO ONE Should eat frozen fish anyway...except those people that don't fish! If you want feed all those people that don't go with you on your annual trips go to the store and buy the fish...lots cheaper and they will not know the difference! As a lifetime fisherman, past lodge owner, and now an OLD man...I hope to take my grand children back to places I have been and the fishing be better than it was when I was a kid. Amen.

I have lived on both sides of the border and have spent a considerable amount of time fishing NWO lakes. I would have to say that I have not experienced the same prejudicial treatment by the MNR that you have. And... with the exception of weekends I hardly ever see resident fishermen on the lake. I would think that the creel survey's are probably fairly accurate in there ratios. I also would hope that the MNR realizes how important non-resident's are to the local economy and would not go out of their way to intentially target or harrass. Regards."
545850,Guest,2005-02-21 09:44:00,0,"Hi. the few times someone has stopped by us either dnr or police in canada no one has asked for a license or counted fish. they just ask how we are doing and if we need any help. they even gave helpful advice on where the fish were biting better. they were stopping at all the boats we could see too. even the roadside stop the officer was most friendly. their useof some words was a little strange though. after finishing with us he said ""you can go that way to escape"""
545871,Guest,2005-02-22 14:14:00,0,As someone who owns property on the Winnipeg River system all I have to say about the slot limit and daily limit is....... IT'S ABOUT #$%^ING TIME!
545880,Johnny_Canuck,2005-02-22 19:17:00,21,I totally agree. I couldn't have said it better.
545807,Hammerhead Herb,2005-02-18 07:32:00,259,"I totally agree with restricitng the limits where needed. My legitimate concern is if the locals are allowed to take a higher limit out of the waters while the tourists are prohibited. With your 4-5 months of fishing, I would think that you have a greater effect on the fishery than an out of state/province fisherman who takes 4 walleye instead of 2 across the border. My complaint is with the authorities who set it up this way in order to avoid heat from the locals and this applies to any state/province who has these spineless laws -- not just Ontario."
545809,bigfish1965,2005-02-18 07:43:00,3210,You may find these laws are politically motivated since neighbouring states were also passing similar laws that had different regs for residents and non-residents.
545814,Guest,2005-02-18 13:25:00,0,"Herb, The ratio of non-residents to residents on the most popular water systems in Northern Ontario is approx. 90:10 on any given day. This data clearly shows that the biggest impact will be had in targeting the non-residents vs residents. Albeit, like most things governed, there may be some political underlying motive present as well. Regards."
545816,Johnny_Canuck,2005-02-18 17:19:00,21,"Canada is a sovereign country. So why shouldn't their citizens have preferential treatment. It happens in the US all the time --BSE, softwood lumber, etc."
545818,Guest,2005-02-18 17:41:00,0,"Well, J.C., I guess to me it boils down to whats best for the fishery. If you think your doing your part to make things better by just continuing on with the status quo while others (who are contributing in a big way to the local economy) need to cut back, then I guess we can disagree. The border issues that you hold up are not relevant."
545819,Johnny_Canuck,2005-02-18 18:02:00,21,"Please read Herb's posting and the quote below. That's the essence of the problem -- too many out of province anglers taking too many fish. ""In May, the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Winnipeg River Fisheries Advisory Committee presented the results of a two-year study to improve the state of the Winnipeg River walleye fishery at an open house in Kenora. The study determined that 80 per cent of the walleye harvested by sport fishermen are caught by American sport anglers with Manitobans and locals responsible for the remaining 20 per cent.""http://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.c....php?id=114902http://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.c....php?id=134976 **"
545822,Guest,2005-02-18 20:23:00,0,"It would seem to me that the fish do not know or care who is catching them. Whether you are part of the 80% or part of the 20%, you are still part of the problem. All anglers should be part of the solution. If you think it somehow makes sense to allocate the blame and therefor the fishery in this manner then you should be prepared to comply when the local Indian band wishes to claim its ""share""."

545247,MN_Moose,2005-01-20 15:18:00,965,"I've been following this thread for a long time. My thoughts are: How many of the people that say they like the new restrcitions actually fish the Winnipeg River? Those that are fishing the Winnipeg, is the majority fishing on Big Sand and Gun? I fish the Winnipeg River from the Highway 17 to the Dalles. The fishery appears to be in good shape. We catch more and bigger fish each year."
545294,Guest,2005-01-22 14:52:00,0,brettF. where do you catch fish like that. been going to LOTW for last 5 years and end up at yellow girl from sioux narrows and the walleyes are not that big. I can deal with short limits if I can catch some fish. thanks alan
545405,IaCraig,2005-01-27 10:04:00,434,"Yes, I fish the Winnipeg River system in Ontario, and yes 80% of my fishing is north of Minaki. 2004 was a little disappointing for us, but all the prior years we caught lots of good fish so I believe 2004 was weather related. (very cold and rainy the week we were there). I concur with the spirit of the majority here, that I am all for new regulations to keep the sport fishery healthy. However I ditto Reel's concern about if tighter regulation on recreational fishing will have the desired impact when netting is still going on? Here are my concerns. 1. The Winnipeg River has been my only Ontario trip each year since 1988. Does this tighter regulation mean I could fish almost any other waters in Ontario and experience better fishing? 2. For the last few years, the age class of 15  17 inch eyes have been hard to find and the 20  25 inch ones much more plentiful. I don't want to eat rock bass for shore lunch, and I don't like that if we get a 20+ inch floater we have to let the gulls have it. (not common but it does happen) 3. I really like my resort owners, I hope their business isn't negatively impacted too bad. 4. If US recreational fishermen bringing home 4 walleyes each is truly the biggest factor of poor walleye populations, are they going to wipe out the smallies and northerns to try to fill their freezers? I am still taking my 1 week Minaki fishing trip in 2005, but if the little woman lets me, I might also try a 2nd trip to another Ontario location for a change. Change is usually for the better, IaCraig"
545406,Reels,2005-01-27 11:23:00,2876,"I hear you. I usually go twice also. This year it will be two fathers, and two thirteen year boys are going. I don't care if I take fish home, but now I will have to buy a liscence for my son if we want more than one fish a piece to eat for shorelunch. I have been going since 88 i think too. Maybe it is time to try Lac Seul. <{{}}><"
545408,Guest,2005-01-27 14:48:00,0,"I have no problem with new regs, I think its a great idea. What I think is bad is different limits for residents and nonresidents. Whats up with that?

545744,Guest,2005-02-13 11:24:00,0,"Its pretty sad that in this day and age, the only thing most groups of fisherman can think of is how many walleye's one can take home. Sure, Ontario MNR could let you take a few hundred fish home with you every trip out... but in a couple years, what do you have? A big beautiful River System with NO FISH. Minaki Walleye's are on shaky ground... errr turbulent water and action needed to be taken now, not in 5 years.. NOW. Last year was piss poor, and it wasn't the weather cause even Lake of the Woods was GOOD. Its a combination of Over Harvest, 2 Walleye Tournaments in the warm water months and neglect. I'm lucky enough to fish there 4-5 months out of every year and the last 2 years have been pretty scary as far as numbers and sizes go. When you fish all day and all your catching is 9-10"" and 21-22"" walleyes and not many of them, you know something is wrong... especially if you are fishing in Minaki. People please get your heads out of your @$$ and realize that there is a problem, and it needs to be addressed. Remember, while you can only take 2 fish back to the U.S.A. you can still catch and release all the fish you want, and thats the fun part anyway."
545794,Guest,2005-02-16 20:42:00,0,There are new regulations for Big Vermilion Lake - slot size and bait restrictions. Check out the government web site for the new regulations. (www.mnr/gov.on.ca ... free publications ... 2005 Fishing regulations...information section). I usually check this out before going.
545800,Guest,2005-02-17 10:26:00,0,"I sent a post in late August or early September talking about my disappointment with Minaki last year. It was a very strange year fishing Minaki, as my only other Canada experiences are on Lac Seul. We caught a lot of 13 to 14 inch fish, and we caught a lot of 21-25 inch fish. We barely saw any fish in the 16 to 20 inch range. I think that one way to correct this is if all resorts got together and offered a FREE CONSERVATION LICENSE. Right now, people look at the cost and figure that it is only 15 or so bucks more for the full license. If people got a free Conservation license, then they might not want to pay an extra $35 for two fish. The resorts could just add the cost to the price of the cabin. I have seen on the web where resorts do this and think it is brilliant. If they all started to do this, then it would work. Something needs to be done to correct this."

My Dad and I would continue to go on our annual Canada trip, even if we weren't allowed to bring home any fish at all. Some people just don't get it. See ya in May!"
545205,Hammerhead Herb,2005-01-19 13:06:00,259,"I'm not sure how much backbone was exhibited. If I read it right, the residents can still keep the 4 fish limit. A real demonstration of backbone would be if MNR reduced the possession limit for residents and nonresidents alike - but that would upset the voters (i.e. lack of backbone). If there is a real concern for protecting the fishery, why didn't MNR reduce the limit for residents also, who would take their 4 fish limit out of the river on a weekly basis as opposed to the non-resident who just has his one week up north. I don't have a problem with the reduction in the limit - it might very well be justified, just the hypocrisy. Anyway, everyone should be happy, MNR reduced the limit and the angler who initiated this post sez that his group of 10 won't be coming back and spend their money."

It still allows you to fish all day, laugh and joke all you want with your buddies and you can still have a fish fry in camp or a shore lunch.

What is distasteful about these regulations are that they are targeting ONE user group while another does as they want with no regulation. For the person who gave the 80% number, give me a break. Numbers can be easily spun to support any side of an argument, the govermenent does it all the time on the issue of the day, read or watch your news lately? How can anyone give a number on a group who doesn't count their take? How many pounds of fish do you need to feed your families? How many fish are being sold for profit? Sold under the table, etc, etc? Sorry people this whole thing stinks like rotting fish! And for Pat, I think it is time to stir the pot before it is too late. It's called being pro-active instead of re-active. Sure for now it's the Winnipeg River, but how long before more waters are listed as stressed? The dramatic netting increases on LOTW is telling me that this waterway is next! Should I wait to speak up after the damage is done and it is in the state as the Winnipeg River??!!?

544709,Guest,2004-12-21 07:54:00,0,"Thank you very much for the answer, I will continue to enjoy Lac Seul - I am amazed each year I go up there, how beautiful it is, how quiet and simple life can be and how much I hate city living. I will be bringing my brother with me this year, his first time to Canada, so I am sure it will be a great time! Thanks!"
544724,Guest,2004-12-21 20:22:00,0,"A few years back I talked with a DNR officer in Wisonsin who informed me that the best thing to happen to the fishing in Wisconsin was the Casino's. He advised that by allowing the Casino's, it gave the Indians a source of income besides selling Walleye to restaurants. The indian nations learned that if the fishing is bad, people will not go to their lakes, and then there are no customers at the Casino's. If they stopped spearing, and the fishing got better, more people came, they were not mad about the spear fishing, and spent more money at the Casino. Many of the Nations now allow very little spear fishing because the Casino is what is most important. Now there are far more people in Wisconsin on the lakes, and the fishing will never compare to lets say Lac Seul, but the officer advised there are more walleye per acre now than there were 12 years ago because there is not the netting and spear fishing going on. I do not know the full laws in Canada, but if they started to run Casino's, and realized that the draw for fisherman was the walleye, maybe they would follow the lead and spear less."
544730,Guest,2004-12-22 10:59:00,0,If your whole group feels like you do then I am glad all of you don't go back. I only wish we could keep you off the lakes in the states too! I like to think I release fish in order to save some for my kids and grand kids to come. The limits that are set work good for me and I still get fish to eat now and then. Good luck... maybe you should take up a new sport.
544733,Guest,2004-12-22 15:37:00,0,Wondering what reg's the Canadians have on Lake Erie?
544754,Guest,2004-12-23 19:31:00,0,"My group fishes on Lake of the Woods and that has been the regulations for several years now. I have been going there for 15 years. When I started going you were lucky to catch a 5 pounder once or twice in a week,, now you catch those everyday and throw in a few 6,7,8,9,10 pounders during the week. The fish size has gone up greatly. I would much rather catch bigger fish that get to take a couple more home."
544773,Guest,2004-12-24 14:19:00,0,"Please don't lay any of the blame for the deterioting conditions on the Winnipeg River on the aborginals. The MNR determined that 80% of the reason for the deterioating conditions can be blamed on none Canadian sport anglers. I am a longtime angler who has fished a lot on the Winnipeg River, Big Sand, etc. out of Minaki. I have also fished numerous Paradise Cove Tournaments. It is disgusting the way some anglers treat such a precious resource. I knew this was eventually going to happen. Anglers who just come up here to harvest as much as they can should stay home."
544776,Guest,2004-12-24 20:52:00,0,"Our guide on the Whinnepeg River told us that since the weather was so cold this year, the planktan level (food for just hatched walleye) was very low, and the walleyes spawned late. For these two reason, they were afraid that this years spawn would not make it through the winter because they would be too small. He advised that there have been other years like this recently. There are other reasons, even mother nature, that can explain a decline in walleye. There do not always have to be fingers pointed."
544777,retire55,2004-12-25 06:36:00,1029,Rob: You can review the 2005 Ontario fishing regulations for Lake Erie at the following web reference. Lake Erie is Division 2. Daily catch limit as well as possession limit is 6 walleye. There is no size limit. There are some exceptions (page 17 of reference) of which one has to be aware.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/fi...p_A_fr2005.pdf
544812,Guest,2004-12-29 10:25:00,0,"I think everyone here is missing the point. There are alot of things that stress the fishery and EVERYONE should be doing all they can to protect it! What is distasteful about these regulations are that they are targeting ONE user group while another does as they want with no regulation. For the person who gave the 80% number, give me a break. Numbers can be easily spun to support any side of an argument, the govermenent does it all the time on the issue of the day, read or watch your news lately? How can anyone give a number on a group who doesn't count their take? How many pounds of fish do you need to feed your families? How many fish are being sold for profit? Sold under the table, etc, etc? Sorry people this whole thing stinks like rotting fish! And for Pat, I think it is time to stir the pot before it is too late. It's called being pro-active instead of re-active. Sure for now it's the Winnipeg River, but how long before more waters are listed as stressed? The dramatic netting increases on LOTW is telling me that this waterway is next! Should I wait to speak up after the damage is done and it is in the state as the Winnipeg River??!!? I guess you feel safe since it's not yet your lake being subject to the nets!"
544669,Guest,2004-12-18 02:00:00,0,GREAT ! we don't want you back !
544676,Trophymuskie,2004-12-18 12:29:00,254,The MNR are doing these new regulations to improve the fisheries and from what I can tell they really know what they are doing. If you can't handle better fishing then stay home. Keep releasing them all Richard Collin Ottawa River Trophy Muskie Charters A Walleye Central Sponsor Look for my listing in the Business Directory
544682,Guest,2004-12-19 02:37:00,0,"NO changes to Lac Seul or Big lake Vermillion. People put miss information on this board and get things stirred up. Again, welcome to Canada and enjoy our wonder pristine waters and an excellent walleye fishery. Pat Winnipeg river system only!!!!!!!!!"
544685,fishmaster,2004-12-19 10:24:00,209,Well put Pat I fish Eagle Lake and from what I have been told there is no change for the 2005 season there.
544690,Guest,2004-12-19 23:12:00,0,35 cm to 45 cm is walleyes from 14 to 18 inches..In my opinion the best eaters with the 17 and 18s having a good size fillet..Sounds like a good plan to me..
544698,Reels,2004-12-20 16:40:00,2876,"This is hard to say, because I don't want to open a big can of worms, and I don't understand it. So, maybe someone can explain and educate me. Please don't let it turn ugly though. How can you manage a fishery when another group has no limit on it's harvest? Can this really be done? <{{}}><"
544700,fishmaster,2004-12-20 18:52:00,209,"Reels Going to be a tough question for someone to answer. Don't know much about it but I would say yes it can be done and if someone can do it the right way I think the Canadians can, I just wish they could come up with something in Wisconsin that would make most happy. You have differant limits differant lakes and differant size limits. It is being done, you as a fisherman just have to know what the rules are in the county or lake that you fish that day. Will be an interesting subject and will be fun to see some of the answers that come up on this."
544702,bigfish1965,2004-12-20 19:50:00,3210,"All you can do...is what you can. The situation is never going to change with Aboriginals unless they themselves change it. All we can do is try and keep lines of communication open and hope we can agree on some common goals. Just because someone else may not being doing their part, does not remove us from the obligation to do our part."
544704,Reels,2004-12-20 20:13:00,2876,"I agree, we just can't give up and say F### it. I wonder though if it really makes a difference though. <{{}}><"
544706,Guest,2004-12-20 20:31:00,0,"The problem with regulations, is that the people that follow the regulations are generally the people that do not need regulations. While the people that are out there killing everything that tugs on a line rarely get caught. I would rather see more enforcement officer's out there checking everyone, and less restrictions. One bad cabin full of guys can take hundreds of walleye out of the lake in a week. While my cabin of 8 might take only 20 - 30 for a few shore lunches."
544641,Rich4Walleyes,2004-12-17 06:06:00,38,The new Ontario Regulations have been posted. They are what we thought they were going to be all the time. This is the reason that our group of 10 will not be going back.http://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.c....php?id=132674
544642,Pooch,2004-12-17 07:30:00,4619,If that is what it takes to keep Canada from looking like Minnesota then I support it everywhere in Canada. Our grandkids will never get to see the kind of fishing that all of us have enjoyed if Canada continues to allow coolers full of fish being removed from most lakes and rivers. Netting included. It is extremely short sighted and selfish for us to not protect a limited resource for the next generation. I'm not getting on any one's case here. Just trying to do what is right. Pooch
544644,retire55,2004-12-17 08:13:00,1029,"Yes, new regulations impacting catch and size limits were announced for the Winnipeg River system - to sustain the resource. Additionally, the Winnipeg River system is but a small part of Ontario. Catch and size limits in Ontario can vary according to the Division being fished."
544645,Guest,2004-12-17 08:41:00,0,i respect the decision and the new regulations... we all enjoy these precious resources for our fishing addictions and we should take care of them. i want my boys to enjoy BETTER fishing than what we are currently enjoying. my hat is off for the foresight of the powers who be in ontario.
544646,Guest,2004-12-17 09:12:00,0,"So your title indicates ""New Ontario Regulations"", but the story indicates Winnepeg River System only. So, I just need to know, do these regulations affect Lac Seul and Big Lake Vermillion? Thanks! >The new Ontario Regulations have been posted. They are what >we thought they were going to be all the time. This is the >reason that our group of 10 will not be going back. > >http://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.c....php?id=132674"
544647,Guest,2004-12-17 09:16:00,0,"right on, ontario. good work. guys, these decisions aren't come to lightly. it's a difficult balancing act necessary to maintain the fishery and not be so onerous as to destroy the tourism industry. i catch and release, so they don't impact me much. but the operative word there is ""catch"". i'd like to be able to continue doing that. i lived in maryland when they had a 5 year moratorium on the rockfish (stripers). no fun. that's what can happen when commercial and sport fishermen make hogs of themselves. if you want meat, go to the butcher or go catch a mess of bluegills. good eating and a lot cheaper than a canada trip."
544648,VMS,2004-12-17 12:04:00,1103,"O.k...so let me get this straight... You are allowed to keep fish that are from 14"" - 17"" inches in length and keep one trophy each. You still get your same limit of fish, but you don't get to keep a bunch of the largest ones...the ones that when they get larger than say 23 inches start to lose their taste (some...not much). You can have your shore lunches and it does not count against your posession limit for your trip and you are upset and not going.... And we wonder why so many lakes lose their trophy class fish? complaining that there are no big fish left in the waters to catch...that catch of a lifetime... My honest perspective on this change...is its the best thing they could do to help promote a better fishery!! Heck...if you and your group choose to stay home, well...you just miss out on great fishing opportunities for the rest of us to enjoy. Bringing home the males is the RIGHT thing to do in order to promote the species, since the big females (that it seems you are complaining about not being able to bring home) are what supply the reproductive means (eggs) for propogation. Feel free....stay home and the rest of us can enjoy!! :-) Steve"
544663,Dano,2004-12-17 17:50:00,83,"""This is the reason that our group of 10 will not be going back."" Perfect, its working already...."
544665,Guest,2004-12-17 18:21:00,0,"We have had that exact slot on Rainy Lake for about 6 or 7 yrs now. It is only one fish/day. The possession limit is 4. The fishing on Rainy is now excellent. Our average size for a walleye is now about 20"". Considering you could barely catch one 15 years ago. That slot is probably going to be used on many lakes in the future. The biologist are amazed as to how fast and big the recovery is on Rainy. Personally, I would not complain about a slot. I would rather catch alot of big fish and eat a few small ones, than catch a few fish and eat the big ones. Rainy is the poster lake for slot sizes."
544666,2746,2004-12-17 18:35:00,3206,"A good change and one that won't affect our group at all. I am wondering, however, why the difference between residents and non residents? Don't even know what the number of non residents compared to residents would be but would think if you lived there the need for a higher possesion limit would be minimal. On the other hand, the resources do belong to them. Just a thought."
