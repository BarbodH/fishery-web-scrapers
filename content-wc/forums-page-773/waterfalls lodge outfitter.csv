I can say the accomodations were good, the hosts were great. Fishing for us was tough.....but realize I was with a 12 year old and 9 year old and I am used to fishing 12-14 hrs per day. The walleye fishing was thin that week. We caught lots of small pike, some bass and rock bass. I think that the cold front that went through affect the walleye fishing. I think we caught about 10 walleye all week but the regulars that had been there before were doing better. Nevertheless the boys still had a great time. If you are looking to have some fun and decent fishing then you will enjoy it. Have fun"

With that development came all the non-fishing activity you see with development.The lodge is comfortable but the lakes are now ""multi-use"".It is not a wilderness experience.I fished there for several years and visited the lakes in 04. It was sad."
545853,Guest,2005-02-21 12:33:00,0,"That does sound bad, did you go on the guided outpost trips with the four wheelers or the drive back?"
545854,chuck c c,2005-02-21 13:10:00,34,"We used to go on the four wheelers to the Serpent River chain for some wonderful small mouth fishing. I have not been to that chain in 10 years. When I last saw the lodge in 2004, I just went to the areas of Tube Lake and Kecil Lake that were easily accessable by road. The road around Tube and Kecil are new since I stayed at the lodge and have really opened the lake and added tremendously to the number of cottages.I've met Bob and Marilou several times since they bought the lodge some years ago.I think (and have been told) they run a good camp. All I can say is that it isn't much of a wilderness experience and the fishing is, reportedly, just a ghost of what it was."
