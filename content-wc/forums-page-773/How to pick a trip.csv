If you are looking for a good fishing resort have the outfitter send you the names and telephone numbers of the people who stayed there the same week last year that you are booking for next year. This will eliminate you talking to the Resort Owners ""Good Old Boys"" and let you talk to those who can tell you first hand what it is like. Mother Nature can be about the only thing that can Monkey Wrench you with this approach. We have used this method many times and it hasnt failed us yet. If the owner wont give you the info...mark him off your list of choices. Checking with others on Walleye Central prior to booking or for some of their favorite spots seems to have excellent results also."
