545820,Guest,2005-02-18 19:53:00,0,"Been there once. Never again!!The lake has a lot of residents on it. Also a public boat launch. Oh, and watch out for the jet-ski's. Some of the best fishing spots turn into a parking lot. If you like crowd's, go for it.If I was offered a pass for a free week of fishing for life, I wouldn't take it..."

Biggest problem I had on Klotz was keeping the perch off the bait. Other than that, a good trip. Didn't make it into Flint Lake however. I had my own boat and it was a little to big to run through the rapids in the Flint River. While I was there I met several groups that had been coming up for years. One group of 9 for over 30 years. They indicated that a trip into Flint Lake is well worth the effort if you are after large pike. I recommend you become adventurous and try some of the other lakes in the area. There was one called Kissigamminie or some such name like that that we (2 of us)fished one day and caught over 80 walleye from about 8 inches to 28 inches. Had a blast. Will definitely go back again. Stayed at Klotz Lake Camp. The owners are great people and prices are very reasonalbe. I think the key to having a great time here is to be willing to try other lakes and different stategies in your quest. Sure, there are better places to go but I think you won't regret your decision if you choose to try this place out. Good Luck and have a blast."

I would not hesitate to book a trip with them... and I am their competition in the area. Have a good trip, and enjoy yourself. It really is a good area to fish, with a wide variety of lakes giving you different experiences. We also use bush lakes mentioned above, such as Kassagimini. It really is a good walleye lake. Have a great time this summer! All the best, Agate"
545904,Guest,2005-02-23 15:30:00,0,"The thing I noticed about the last 2 replies was that they gave no mention of anything I posted about.If you want a wilderness atmosphere as the name of the camp applies, I would say this is far from it.Sure the owners are nice and caring people,most camp operators are. Seeing the highway from your cabin with semi's roaring down the road all day and night is not wilderness to me,sorry. Also, the best fishing we found was where Klotz lake emptied over the rapids to Flint.Seems this is also a hot spot for the locals as every evening like I said before it was like a parking lot.Made you sorta feel guilty pulling in there to fish with so many people already there. Heck, we had to limit our casting so as to not snag up with everyone there.You know how it is, you travel all those miles with high spirits about how great this is going to be only to find out different.Real different!!I'll stick with the fly-out outposts from now on. Pure solitude is what it is all about for us. One more thing, sometimes brochures can be a little deceiving! Fishy66"
545908,Guest,2005-02-23 17:21:00,0,"Hey Fish, I respect that Flint was not for you, and that you prefer fly-ins. If that is what you like to do, there is nothing wrong with that. An important aspect of this is for people to ask questions. I was on the phone with a customer for nearly an hour yesterday. He had many questions about our camp, the lakes, remoteness (we are 4 miles from the nearest highway), and even got to questions about fishing. We are always very honest about what we tell customers or prospective customers. I'd rather have customers coming into camp knowing what to expect, then to oversell just to get a sale. (I'm not saying Flint oversold either... I don't know what transpired between the two parties). Some people are very happy with drive-in lodges, others like yourself prefer fly-ins. Thats why there are so many different lodge choices. We each fill a nitch. From the lodge owner side of things, it is very hard to defend yourself in a forum like this. Over years of customers, any lodge is bound to have a week where a group is unhappy. Many things are out of your control, from the weather, to fish just being a tough bite. The only thing you do control is service. Most of the good lodges will do their best to make customers happy. Because we do want them back! Hope you have a great trip this summer. All the best, Agate"
545935,Guest,2005-02-24 15:08:00,0,"Agate, I understand what your saying and respect that. The one thing we didn't do was ask enough questions regarding the surroundings and the lake itself. For sure a lesson learned, but to late for us at the time. I'm sure there would be plenty of fish folks that would find the camp to their liking, it's all personal preference.Makes me wonder how many repeat visitors they have? Our trips will be fly-outs from now on but if there ever was a reason to do a drive in camp again I guarentee you I know now the questions I would ask that would be of most important to me. Thanks for wishing me a good trip this year, no problem there. Have yourself a great year also. Fishy66"
