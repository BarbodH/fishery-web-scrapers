Anyway I noticed he was at the bow of the boat and had the finder and trolling motor in the camera vision. every once in a while the camera would pan a little to the left and there mounted on the side was what looked like a light bulb fixture for a halogen bulb. the kind that are about 500 watts. they had it in the picture enough that I know I was not imaging it. why would have this very bright light on the edge of the gunnel pointed into the water? It was not to light up the boat, definitly pointed to the water. I think he was in minnesota. Why? Is this something used for night fishing by ""In fisherman""?"
545886,mwal,2005-02-23 06:03:00,151,I have light attached to my front navigation light. I use it to navigate a narrow channel at night and docking at my cabin in WI. Its like the headlight on your car. It's easier to use than a q-beam hand held light. I'm sure he is using it for the same purpose. Cabelas sells them. MWal

I used to guide fishermen for Kokanee salmon (landlocked sockeye) in Montana and lights were tremendously effective. I had Coleman lanterns hanging above the boat from racks I'd built...for interior lights...but I had two submersible Halogen (like a million candle power each) that I hung over the side of the boat just under the surface. We'd tie off shore..move off shore to the correct depth, then drop another anchor, off the other end of the boat, to keep the boat from moving. Then we'd put the lights in and commence vertical jigging with phosphorescent 1/16th oz. jigs on 4lb mono. We tipped the jigs with white (shoe peg) corn. Or maggots (either worked). Let it down to the bottom... reel up about a foot and then slowly move the rod tip up and down. Any thing we felt, we'd set the hook.......and it would be either a Kokanee or a rainbow trout. It would start out slowly...but the lights attracted daphnia and other small forms of life...this inturn attacted the kokanee and trout. The action would get faster and faster and faster as the more ""feed"" got attracted... the more fish came. And the more we caught. Hooking 3 lb Kokanee straight down only 15 feet made for some wild action! Sometimes they'd jump and land inside the boat :) :) It was a BALL!"
545897,Guest,2005-02-23 11:02:00,0,OK thanks. Its just that with all the boats i have seen never saw one with a light like that. thanks alan
