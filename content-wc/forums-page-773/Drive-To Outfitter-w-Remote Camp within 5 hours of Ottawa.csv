544178,Guest,2004-11-16 05:45:00,0,"you can get a fairly quick reply from the poutrincourt website on prices. believe me they are nicely priced. excellent management. a few replies back said 50-60 w's per day? didnt fish very hard. try 600-800 per week. sure you get your share of weenies but it shows a healthy population. we had pike eat our walleyes on the way up. place is loaded, big lake, boats are a trifle small but they do the job, the equipment is good, no guides needed, nothing exotic tacklewise, a fishing heaven"

544190,retire55,2004-11-16 17:37:00,1029,"The requirement was for ""decent walleye fishing"". Its very questionable whether Lake Nipissing can qualify. Slot limits prohibit the harvesting of any walleye between 15.7 inches and 23.6 inches (during the soft water season). A sizable commercial ice fishing operation (slot limits don't apply for ice fishing) and a big native fishery put far too much pressure on the walleye population."

544242,Seanik,2004-11-23 10:54:00,218,Walleyechieftian I am curious as to how the drive is to Poutrincourt from Ottawa via Senneterre. How much of the road is gravel and what was it's condition when you were on it. Thanks
545974,Guest,2005-02-28 05:27:00,0,"from the last night stay (st. felicien) you have a 70 mile or so drive on a paved, 2 lane excellent highway. the turnoff is a lumber road, hard-packed sand-i wouldnt say gravel. the road is 12 miles, with ups and downs and you take it somewhat slow so it takes an hour or so. ive done it in mercury sable type vehicles with no problem unless it rains and then it can be interesting. otherwise its a piece of cake. we leave st.fel at 5:30am and are there by 7:30am. the place wakes up around 8. be early, registration is painfully slow, especially if its a crowded week and a lot of folks are staying away from the main lodge. but for ease of travel you cant beat this place. and the rewards are the best walleye fishing you ever experience. p"

544108,Guest,2004-11-09 05:44:00,0,"I will second the vote for O'Sullivan Lake. Top shelf, all the way. We'll start with the accommodations: Clean, well kept cabins with hot water, showers, indoor toilet facilities, electricity, refrigerators and comfortable beds. They are situated right on the water and the camp is located in a central point which seperates the north and south sections of the lake. The fishing is super for lots of walleye (and there are big ones in this lake...how does a 16 pounder sound?) Big pike (up to 30lbs) finicky lake trout and lots of places to fish. I've been going to O'Sullivan for over 20 years and I will continue this trip until I'm convinced there's someplace better. This lake is managed for trophy fish and I have not seen a declinein size or numbers since I first fished there back in the early eighties. Google their website for more info."

544112,Guest,2004-11-09 14:39:00,0,"Domaine Poutrincourt near Chibougamau is pretty incredible. Used to be fly-in only access, but they recently opened a road to the lake. They're the only outfitter on the lake (it's massive), and the fishing is awesome."
544113,retire55,2004-11-09 18:05:00,1029,"Tripper: I checked out the Domaine Poutrincourt web site http://www.poutrincourt.qc.ca/. Unfortunately, the references are dated with most being from the mid 90's. The web site could be a much better advertisement for the outfitter if the information were current. Apparently the lake is 15 miles long by 5 miles wide. Consequently, were 10 HP motors adequate for such water from your experience? What size would you estimate the average sized walleye caught to be - 12 inches, 14 inches, 16 inches?"
544114,Guest,2004-11-09 19:13:00,0,"Fished Poutrincourt in July of 2002 with my wife, based on the recomendation of a friend in Rouyn Noranda (about 6 hrs. sw of Poutrincourt). We had no problem averaging 40-50 fish a day with many in the 18-22"" class. My wife landed the largest at 26"". Large pike eluded us, but we didn't target them. I think it's a great place. Actually there's one more place I thought of and it's even closer. Adventure Joncas in La Verendrye park (www.aventurejoncas.com). My friend in Rouyn has fished here several times (he's actually driving SOUTH to this lake). I've seen his photo album and you wouldn't believe the number of huge walleyes in this lake. A 10 is almost guaranteed. Definitely a trophy fishery. The only reason I havn't tried it is because it's a little pricey. A truly 5 star operation though. The website is kind of lame, but check out the photos in their gallery. If you enjoy catching trophy walleye and like to be pampered you might want to check it out. (plus it's a really easy drive)."
544115,retire55,2004-11-09 21:38:00,1029,"Tripper: Thanks for the updated information. As much as our group of retired guys doesn't target just trophy walleyes, by the same token, we aren't keen on a fishing trip where all the walleyes are less than 1.5 lbs. I'd have to agree that Poutrincourt affords great walleye fishing if 30 % of your catch is in the 18-22 inch class. Our Sep 04 trip into Lake Kipawa resulted in about 30% greater than 16"" and 70% less. Biggest was 24 inches. Thanks as well for the reference to Adventure Joncas - certainly some great pictures of walleyes. I have catch statistics for the 2003 season for La Verendrye Park. Lake Joncas averaged about 3 walleyes per fishing day while Original Lake averaged about 4 walleyes per fishing day. I guess when they say access to over 150 lakes, they mean all the lakes within the park. Actually these lakes ar not that far east of the Club Trout Lake lakes."
544116,Guest,2004-11-10 06:39:00,0,"Thanks for the info Tripper and Retiree55. Tripper, do you have a ball park $$$ amount or cost(American or candian $$$) per day @ Poutrincourt? Seems strange that the website does not show this.....only available if you ask.....I realize prices do change year to year. Makes me kinda twitchy, kinda like going to a resturant and seeing no prices on the menu.......Thanks!"
544145,Guest,2004-11-11 17:17:00,0,"This must be near Lake Obatagamau. It is a drive-in lake about 20 miles long south of Chibougama. We have caught over 200 Walleye per boat a day in that lake with many in the 18""-22"", so many that you actually do get tired after awhile and go off to hunt the giant pike in there, which are 48""+. I know there is a lodge there called Lake Obatagamau Lodge but they don't seem to advertise anywhere but by searching you can find the number. It is a little longer than 5 hour drive, but not too bad."
544029,Guest,2004-11-02 11:52:00,0,"Our gang of 8 are making plans for next summers trip to Canada....either Quebec or Ontario, makes no difference. We've been doing our trip many times now, we're putz's in our 50s and are hooked on the idea of the Remote Camp. Low finances for all (could it be time for a change here in the USA??) dictates that this year's trip cannot be a fly-in....too expensive with the fuel prices driving the costs way high. We have gathered info on a couple of places that provide what we're looking for, but thought it never hurts to ask for a little more input from our fellow fishermen. Here's what we'd like: 1. Location within 5 hours of Ottawa. 2. A remote camp that you can boat to.....at least a mile away from any other camp....we are not interested in the ""campground experience""....we don't want to bother anyone else on their vacation and we don't want to be bothered by anyone else either. 3. Remote Camp to accomodate 8 guys, gas lights/fridge/water heater .....shower would be nice but not absolutely necessary. 4. Decent walleye fishing. Anybody have a place in mind that fits? Thanks!"
544030,Guest,2004-11-02 15:30:00,0,I know you said you wanted to stay within 5 hours of Ottawa but if you are interested in Norwest Ontario I go to a place called wine lake camp.

We went to Sasseginaga 2 trips ago....it's on the short list already. The thing that sticks in my mind is that, when you hit the back roads as you near your destination on our past trips, you invariably pass by other outfitters. We're intent on our destination and don't waste time shopping....we want to hit the water after a long trip. There's gotta be other places that we've never heard about. Any help much appreciated!!!"

I have not been to either location but have talked to satisfied fishermen who have. Ten Mile Lodge (remote camps on Lake Dumoine) almost fits your travel requirements perfectly while Club Trout Lake (very remote camps on Lake Winawiash and Lake Bay) is entered via Senneterre (north of Temiscaming, Quebec). I have included web maps to help evaluate.http://www.tenmilelodge.com/http://toporama.cits.rncan.gc.ca/ima.../03/031k13.gifhttp://www.clubtroutlake.com/index.htmlhttp://toporama.cits.rncan.gc.ca/ima.../03/031m08.gif"
