I picked up some tie-able Titanium leader material (Knot2Kinky brand). I was wondering what guys out there are using it and what knots they are tying with it?? On the back of the pack they suggest the ""perfection loop"". I tried it and while it isn't too bad to work with and tie, it will take some getting used to. I am a little leary about the fact that the knot doesn't cinch tight too. It will take some getting used to looking at a knot that has gaps in it, as the wire won't let it bind nice and tight. Anyway, just thought there might be some advice out there, or some reviews."

I use the tie-able leader for fly fishing for pike, but still haven't landed anything too big so can't provide a complete review for you.TyGer suggests: Uni, Palomar, Shearer Spider Hook, Rapala, Riffling Hitch, Simplified Blood, Extension Blood, Improved Blood, Dropper Snell, Improved Clinch, Double Improved Clinch, Albright, End Loop, Simple Loop Connection, Rhode Loop, Surgeon, Surgeon Loop, Single Over Hand Loop, Trilene, Homer's, Offshore Swivel, Crawford, World Fair or the TyGer 2 Turn Clinch Knot.Cortland says ""Conventional knots work fine"".So I assume you can use pretty much any knot."
