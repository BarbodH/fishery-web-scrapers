Don't be a woos,they are alot of fun to watch. We are not talking about grizzlies here there black bears.You can do what ever you like,we have been fishing the Canadian shield lakes for many yrs.and always feed the dead fish to the bears at a safe distance. never had a problem. Its your fishing trip make it an adventure"
1467597,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-29 08:27:00,1460,"If you have bears hanging around your camp, yes, they are there for a reason. And the thing is, they will be destroyed because your outfitter doesn't want to rebuild his camp week after week. I have even heard of outfitters placing anti-freeze cocktails behind there cabins to kill those somewhat domesticated bears. Ultimately, A Fed Bear is a Dead Bear! Often, the next group into camp has to deal with a problem which you may have created. When these bears don't get there massive calorie allotment, what do ya think they do? Well, I'd hate to be in that cabin as a big hungry bear comes in through the front door or breaks in through the floor. Makes for a tough nights sleep doncha think?"
1467625,octanehi5,2012-07-29 09:21:00,1104,"Pikeslayer, I do not believe in your fed bear is a dead bear . I did say if you are have problems with bears how to get them away from your camp by feeding them at a safe distance. If you have any type of food in the woods you will attract bears. My method has worked for yrs. never had to kill a bear. and never worried about one coming in the cabin, If you feed a bear thats visiting your camp at a safe distance.everyone has an opinion on this and this is mine weather you do it or not. I do not care. Choose not to take Bear spray. Good luck with the bears Read what I said not what you think I said.Slushfish Have a good trip. I'm outa this one"
1467814,castnblast,2012-07-29 18:34:00,111,"...live in a zoo. There are many bears on highway 527 toward Armstrong that have lost all fear of humans because of traveling anglers stopping to throw food at them, in hopes of snapping a close range photo from the safety of their vehicle. Black bears are instinctively wary of people - when they lose there inhibitions, they become nuisance bears - and that is when they become a threat to humans and themselves. It really is best not to feed bears - they fend for themselves just fine In my experience fish guts on the shore, 200 yards down the beach will guarantee one thing - and that's a half dozen squawking gulls screaming at first light. If the fish guts do happen to attract a bear.....well, now you have a new neighbour in camp. Bandit, we camp in tents in remote areas of Northwestern Ontario spring, summer and fall. A bear in camp is rare but it does happen. Most of our encounters include the rumaging sound of a cooler or a plastic tote getting banged around first thing in the morning. A banger will usually get them to saunter off, but better yet is an air horn with a sustained annoyance factor. Keep a clean camp and don't sleep with a bag of cheesies under the pillow and you should not have a problem. IMO, and in my experience, there are two things to avoid. Don't get caught between a mother and cubs.....and do your best not to startle or spook a bear at close range. That is the time they will make an impulse decision to run for cover or take a stand and charge to defend themselves. These things usually happens on the trail or portage - not in camp - and that is when you want the spray (or a pump 12 full of slugs) anyway, back to the original post.... If a can of bear spray provides your partner piece of mind, it's $40 well spent. Have a great trip, and enjoy! Cnb"
1466144,dog2,2012-07-25 12:52:00,198,"might have been just my group but the last 3x's customs has ask ,Do you have any mace or bear spray. they are basicaly one and the same just a little less capsain in one. take a small air horn $8.00 @walley world . they are legal ."
1466145,Hawkfan,2012-07-25 12:52:00,237,Check with your outfitter too. They can tell you if bears have ever been a problem where you are going and if they may already have a can at the cabin. I seem to remember seeing a can of bear spray at an outpost we went to a while back.
1466149,Slushfish,2012-07-25 12:57:00,263,"I understand the laws but I can tell you this: the last and only time I tried to take a can of UDAP bear spray containing "" O.C."", they confiscated it at the border. I guess I didn't need it for that moose hunt anyway. Slushfish"
1466191,10point,2012-07-25 14:42:00,102,I have a couple of old cans from bow hunting deer in beer areas and I took some across in June. The border guard told me it was illegal to bring in but let me go with it anyways.
1466872,pegasis0066,2012-07-27 06:08:00,64,Tell your friend to grow a pair.
1466952,a3dad,2012-07-27 09:28:00,115,if you don't know how to deal with bears maybe you shouldn't be out in the wilderness after all.
1466955,Bandit81,2012-07-27 09:34:00,8,"Again, we know how to deal with bears and live around bears. It's just about the extra precaution. After all, you aren't driving distance to the nearest hospital if something were to happen. My post wasn't stating that ""I don't know anything about bears and I'm scared, please help"" I was merely asking thoughts on buying a can of bear spray as a last resort or not."
1467001,Ogoki,2012-07-27 10:43:00,291,"I have got to tell this one as some of you will get a chuckle from it . I had a customer of mine who would frequent the same fly-in outpost camp that I did . He came in to the shop after one trip and asked if we ever had bear problems at that camp . I told him never . He had been there several times and said not every trip but several times they had a bear in camp . I asked about double bagging trash and of course not leave trash or anything on the cabin deck . He said they were very clean at camp and just could not understand it as other people told him they never had bears in camp either . He said every morning after breakfast they always burn the bacon grease on the camp fire to get ""RID"" of it . I about died laughing when he told me this . He just did not realize he was actually luring the bears in . If you don't know you just don't know I guess . I knew this long before I started bear hunting ."
1467375,octanehi5,2012-07-28 11:25:00,1104,"Remember something you are a visitor in there turf, If you are careful not to attract them.iF YOU DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM ,SAVE YOUR FISH CARCASSES, and put them on a shore about 200 yards from your camp, you can watch them and take some nice pics. The bears are just looking for something to eat. Feed them the right way and they will not bother you. Your are in there world if you can not deaL with it maybe you should not go."
1467399,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-28 12:36:00,1460,"First, don't leave your fishguts on the same shore as your camp. That is asking for trouble. Take your guts to an island off in the lake. The gulls will love ya for it. Second, Do not feed the bears!"
1466085,Bandit81,2012-07-25 10:42:00,8,"Ok gents, Question for you all. We are heading for our first fly-in fishing trip in mid-August into the Ontario Wilderness. Our group has had the discussion about bear spray and one guy in particular is worried about getting attacked by a black bear. Obviously the odds of seeing one are one thing, and actually having one attack you is another. I know all the proper precautions to avoid a bear since we are from northern MN. So my question is do you recommend buying a $40 can of bear spray to bring with? Of course if you use it and it saves your life, it could be the best $40 you ever spent. But I don't think it's needed and that it can be an expense spared...thoughts on this? Thanks in advance for all your responses!!"
1466088,birddogger,2012-07-25 10:54:00,43,Split the cost. Cheap peace of mind. I have one myself.
1466094,Hillbiehle,2012-07-25 11:14:00,66,Save your money....buy a case of beer.
1466101,JayM5209,2012-07-25 11:30:00,1050,"I don't think you need it. Keep a clean camp. If you decide you need it, you'll need to get it in Canada. You cannot take it across the border."
1466106,Bandit81,2012-07-25 11:43:00,8,"Well that's the concern too is that who knows what the guys before us left in the woods etc. They might have been morons and thrown their fish guts next to the outhouse. Hopefully that's not the case but that would be my worry. But as far as bringing bear spray across the border I think you can. I think it has to be bear spray and not pepper spray. I've read mixed discussions about this, but most people say you just have to declare that you have bear spray at the border? No?"
1466107,Slushfish,2012-07-25 11:44:00,263,"I didn't want to spend $80 on my UDAP pepper spay for bowhunting elk either, but, after being charged by a bear and spraying her at 8ft I was glad I spent the doe. Of course that was a grizzly. I chase alot of bear with hounds and spend plenty of time in the bush, never felt the need to have it for black bear. If you do get the urge to carry it, remember you can't cross the border with it, and don't WASTE your money on the dog spray that marketers try to sell as bear spray. Good Luck and have fun."
1466114,Larry Mac,2012-07-25 11:56:00,530,"Hi Bandit81, I do agree with JayM5209. The fly in's we have been on we were told no bear spray is allowed on the float plane (it would not be good if the can got damaged or went off accidently) I believe they told us it was a law. We have seen many a bear, even mothers with cubs and we respect their space. We have never had a problem yet. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1466119,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-25 12:05:00,235,"9 fly in trips and have never seen a bear at the lake. Have never heard a story of someone attacked by a bear while at an outpost cabin. Anything is possible I suppose, but very remote odds here. You'll mostly be in and around the cabin or out in a boat most of the time. For the guy in your group who wants it, tell him he can buy it and if it gets used you will then pay him five times the cost of it."
1466141,Bandit81,2012-07-25 12:44:00,8,"Here is what I found on the Canada customs website that talks about Pepper Spray/Bear spray. Looks like bear spray is ok, but then again there's the issue of whether or not you can fly with it in a float plane.....doubtful. ""(c) Any other spray designed to be used against humans (e.g., ""pepper spray"") – These are chemical agents, often packaged in the form of aerosol sprays, made with the active ingredient capsaicin. Pepper spray is also known as OC (oleoresin capsicum) spray or OC gas. It is used to cause temporary incapacitation through irritation of eyes, skin, mucous membranes, and/or respiratory system, sometimes causing temporary blindness. In addition, some devices labelled as ""pepper spray"" may also contain Mace and/or tear gas. Exception: Aerosol or similar dispensers that contain substances capable of repelling or subduing animals (e.g. dog or bear repellent) are not considered prohibited weapons if: (i) the label of the container indicates specifically that it is for use against animals only; and (ii) the provisions of the Pest Control Products Act are met. (iii) In order for a device or dispenser to be considered to meet the above criteria, it must be apparent that the device was designed exclusively for the control or use against animals."
1466143,Fishoil,2012-07-25 12:50:00,1277,"You can take bear spray across the border into Ontario. I just did 3 weeks ago at the insistance of my wife. I informed the border guard that I had it and was told it was OK to bring. What your outfitter allows on their floatplanes may be another story. Personally I would not spend the money on it. Your chances of seeing a black bear close enough for an ""encounter"" are extremely slim. The chance of that bear attacking you is even less. If we were talking grizzlies I wouldn't leave home without it, but black bears won't be a problem."
