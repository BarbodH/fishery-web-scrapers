1454422,Guest,2012-06-26 14:55:00,0,"""Nice report. And how did you go about finding them? Electronics?"" Yes we used electronics to find fish and scout for depths, reefs and humps. We did a lot of trolling with harnesses so a lot of time we would just pick a general area that looked good and start trolling to help pin point them...after we got a few we might stop in that area and jig and/or cast perch rapallas....or troll through again. Wind blown bays were our first targets...2nd was rocky points and third was submerged islands near deeper water. One morning we searched for a couple hours and only had two fish in the boat...I casted a perch rapala near a rocky shore and picked up a nice 2lber. I tried it again and got a 3lber....in a matter of 30 min I landed two over 4lbs several 3lbers...and lost two giants all in the same spot with a perch rapala...that spot never produced the rest of the week."

1443265,Guest,2012-05-31 15:45:00,0,I leave in seven days...how has the early spring effected the bite? This will be year three for me should I plan to fish any different because the spring is way ahead this year?

1443956,Guest,2012-06-02 15:42:00,0,This will be our third year...People usually do not have a lot of good things to say about Dog Lake on here and I am sure there are a lot better lakes in Ontario but the lake is HUGE and we have traditionally done pretty well. We have no idea what we are doing (two seasons's of walleye fishing experience) and we catch lots of fish..we have never gone hungry and when the weather cooperates we do really well with tons of fish. I am wondering about the different weather this year...and I wouldn't mind doing just as good or better then we have the last two years.
1444030,Rich B,2012-06-02 19:31:00,1081,Be sure to post a report on how your group did up north on Dog Lake......hope it's a great week for you and your friends.....safe travels. Rich B
1453446,Guest,2012-06-24 15:35:00,0,"Been back for a week and decided I would post a report from Dog Lake Number of fish ended up being higher then last year and sizes were bigger BUT we did have a couple slow days and the days we were catching 50+ fish per guy the fish seemed really small. We caught less pike then last year. The fish were scattered and un-predictable. We would spend hours looking for them...find them...catch one after another...then repeat the process the next day because the fish were not in the same spots as the day before. (I don't mind working to find them...I find that fun...but some days we had to work hard) We had a couple 50 fish per guy days and a few 10 fish per day per guy days. I think we had two 8lbers and a few 4-6 lbers and a decent amount of 2-3 lbers....which overall I thought wasn't bad for size. The first day we tried all the spots that worked good last year but only caught a few fish...we had to adjust because the weather and season had the fish acting like it was later in the spring then usual....the camp manager suggested we fish deeper, which was an adjustment for us because we usually get them in 7-15ft of water that time of year. Three of the six days we had a crazy May Fly hatch which did not help the fishing. May Fly's and larva were every where! I had a 22"" pike on and a complete MONSTER pike swam up, grabbed it, jumped out of the water with it and then let go if it...it was HUGE! We had success jigging, trolling harnesses and casting perch rapalas at rocks and reefs. Overall it was a good trip...we did better then last year so that is a good thing."
