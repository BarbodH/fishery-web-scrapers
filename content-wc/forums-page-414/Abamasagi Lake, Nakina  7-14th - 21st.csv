1467956,gmattbruin,2012-07-30 06:49:00,174,looks like it was a great trip. I cant believe how low the water levels are. When we were there at Howards in mid-june all that dock was at water level. I assume your stay with Howard was a good one? Also did Howard get a new bbq? Most of the fish were caught in deeper water on structure?
1468064,corvette1,2012-07-30 10:31:00,243,yes he got a new bbq. find a hump you cought fish 18-24ft saw the water line on the rocks it was low still great fishing
