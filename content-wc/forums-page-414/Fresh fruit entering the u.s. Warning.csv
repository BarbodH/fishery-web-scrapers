1465730,Bobbajig,2012-07-24 15:49:00,24,Got stopped at Intl Falls last year after a great trip to Lac Seul. U.S.border guard wanted to make sure we were not bringing any citrus back into the states. I was really worried he was going to ask if I was bringing any Cuban cigars back for my buddies at work!!
1465915,gobblestopper,2012-07-25 04:48:00,36,"Got the shakedown last year because I had an apple in the cup holder when I pulled up to the American Window coming home. She asked for the ""sticker""...of course the absolute stupid look on my face must have given me away. Wow, was she NOT happy when she dug through our stuff and found 2 oranges in the bottom of the cooler. She was equally NOT impressed when I stopped her mid lecture and asked if she was joking. Allowed us to pass with a STERN warning. Funny now, PIA then."
1466005,Walley Guide,2012-07-25 08:18:00,67,"I found the following from the CBP web site....it could shed a little light on the subject. Happy Fishin' Walley (Fruits and Vegetables Bringing fruits and vegetables depends on a number of factors. For instance, consider the apple you bought in the foreign airport just before boarding and then did not eat. Whether or not CBP will allow the apple into the United States depends on where you got it and where you are going after you arrive in the United States. The same would be true for Mediterranean tomatoes. Such factors are important because fresh fruits and vegetables can introduce plant pests or diseases into the United States. One good example of problems imported fruits and vegetables can cause is the Mediterranean fruit fly outbreak during the 1980s. The outbreak cost the state of California and the federal government approximately $100 million to get rid of this pest. The cause of the outbreak was one traveler who brought home one contaminated piece of fruit. It is best not to bring fresh fruits or vegetables into the United States.)"
1465427,Moondog,2012-07-23 21:43:00,362,"BTW........reasonable or not nobody asked about firearms, fish, booze, smokes......NOTHING. I told them we had tomatoes, apples, onions, lemons, bananas, AND nobody looked for anything BUT those **** tomatoes. I am not happy. They took lemons from our friends......so appears there is nothing consistent about the fruit/vegetable cavity search except for that our US customs does it consistently. Makes me feel safe."
1465455,onetimedave,2012-07-24 03:45:00,502,Been going to Canada yearly since the mid 60's and have never been asked that question. Must be something new.
1465458,Sidge61,2012-07-24 04:26:00,59,"Crossed the border at noon last Saturday and had a 5 minute wait and the border gal was very nice and asked if we had anything else besides fish from Canada. Said hats and shirts, she smiled and waved us through. In 40+ years of crossing I never had a problem either way."
1465459,F250,2012-07-24 04:28:00,75,"Depends on the type of fruit or vegetable. I have been crossing into Quebec ( I live one mile from the border) for the past several weeks and buying fresh corn, blueberries and rasberries. No problem importing them back home."
1465479,Shellback,2012-07-24 05:50:00,8083,"I believe Canada has fruit and vegetable restrictions also. When I visited our friends in Ontario last August, I brought some PA corn with us for a fish fry. They asked me where I had bought the corn, as they informed me it was illegal to bring it into Canada. They have had a number of American friends have their fruit and vegetables taken at the border. Keep in mind that produce you bought might not necessarily have originated in Canada. We share a border, but each country may have different laws on the importation of goods. If the US accepts fruit and vegetables from China, and they are carrying a pest, I doubt Canada wants a US citizen bringing it into their country. Vice versus with the US. I think both countries have enough foreign pests. Maybe foreign people too. LOL!"
1465517,Lovetofish,2012-07-24 07:49:00,458,I too bumped into the Deputy Director of Fresh Fruit at Grand Portage coming back the 13th. I didn't have any fresh fruit yet he still gave me the $300 scolding. Really had to bite my lip. He pulled me aside and looked through my coolers and totes in my tow vehicle. It didn't take long but I thought the cavity check was coming.
1465518,tv4fish,2012-07-24 07:54:00,2694,"You guys are reminding me -- When we came back into the U.S. on July 7th - we were ""randomly selected"" for a complete inspection. As the U.S. custom agents were going through our vehicle - the 3 of us were instructed to go inside and we were asked a number of questions - the ONLY fruit they asked us about was -- kiwi ???"
1465567,Moondog,2012-07-24 09:34:00,362,"As big deals go it is not a big deal. The people getting ""juiced"" are those profiled for having campers with refrigerators and those with obvious coolers. My point was how inconsistently restrictions are enforced and how many are not even asked and this has been re-enforced by other postings. No this is not new. Has been going on for at least the last 5 years and before that they took beef, dog food, potatoes......the list goes on. Right now it is those darn 3rd world countries Fruit de jour. On the other side of the coin, seems Canadian customs at For Francis have been told to stop harassing fishermen. I only know of one person that had to pay extra duty on booze........most told to have a nice time fishing. At Emerson when we crossed they even wanted to see the bottle to be sure it wasn't over one liter. So I say....glad you enjoyed my tomatoes, son."
1465712,Bobbajig,2012-07-24 15:03:00,24,Is it legal to bring potatos into Ontario or is it still forbidden. Going to Eagle Lake in 31 days and was wondering if I have to buy them in Dryden.
1465715,Lovetofish,2012-07-24 15:07:00,458,"I brought them, along with a couple onions. Think as long as they have commercial packaging your fine. But, you have been warned about the fresh fruit coming back. lol."
1465350,Rivratz,2012-07-23 19:18:00,105,"DO NOT stop at any roadside fruit stands in Canada on your return trip home. The U.S. Customs are confiscating all fruit and vegetables coming in. It would be a shame to blow even a penny on fresh fruit from Canada to bring home, and the U.S. customs confiscate it and throw it away. They took lemons from me that I purchased in the U.S. that I didn't use, and was bringing back home. There must be some type of pest that they had found somewhere in Canada. Our farmers are having a nightmare summer with the drought nationwide. They don't need any new pests to start dealing with. We have plenty of farm fresh produce right here."
1465355,v-bay gord,2012-07-23 19:27:00,3168,"Yes, nothing worse than the U.S. agricultural agent coming out with his rubber gloves to inspect your fruit. Is it national security or job security?"
1465356,wallydave,2012-07-23 19:28:00,2151,Is it ok to bring fresh blueberries into Canada? I hit Ontario in June before the berries are ready up North. No problem if its a no! I can always bring frozen ones for blueberry pancakes! I am taking my wife next year! I want to make the trip wife friendly! !
1465359,Rivratz,2012-07-23 19:40:00,105,"No problem entering Canada with fresh fruit. Problem is entering back in the U.S. with fresh fruit. Can't say what next year's rules or changes might be. Love those BB pancakes! Made correctly, you don' need syrup."
1465362,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-23 19:43:00,1460,"I had somewhat, the same experience. When crossing back into the US, I had the strangest border experience. Being that it was so late in the day we did not want a border shakedown. When I pulled up to the border officer gal, I was expecting to answer the same ole questions as where we from, where we been, how long etc. Instead, she asked me if I'm taking any fruit across. Wow, I packed the cooler with the left over fruit salad from camp. I tell her, ""yup, I got fruit, mostly bought in Canada"". We go back and forth about this fruit salad and now I'm fully expecting to get the pull over and bend over while we inspect your vehicle's contents. Instead, she just waves me through."
1465374,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-07-23 20:00:00,84,Must be something new. Didn't ask that question in June. KiNda silly either way. What if it was a banana? Don't see a lot of banana trees on Lake of the Woods.
1465388,Planocat,2012-07-23 20:20:00,473,Our experience paralleled what Rivratz encountered. We came back in on July 9th and encountered 2 jerks at the US border crossing. Agent took all the fruit and vegetables even though I'm diabetic and travel with fruit all the time. We also had items bought in the US and still wearing the US produce designation. Didn't matter.......... and then threatened us with a $300 fine for not disclosing we had a lime and a lemon (both purchased in the US). We told him we had apples and oranges but didn't itemize the 2 citrus items.It's something new coming back to the US every year............. the only thing that remains consistent is that you can count on them being real jerks to the Americans.
1465391,Walley Guide,2012-07-23 20:29:00,67,"I have been asked the past few years if I had any fruit heading back into the states. Last year I had some apples left over from the trip....the border folks ask to see them, spent a few minutes digging them out. All they said was since the apples had ""U.S. stickers"" on them it was no problem. Happy Fishin' Walley"
1465409,JayM5209,2012-07-23 20:58:00,1050,"It is not something new. I've traveled out of and back into the U.S. for more than 30 years. The import of almost all agricultural products, including fruits and vegetables, is prohibited, and by law the items must be declared. The purpose of the rules is to protect U.S. agriculture from plant diseases and pests that flourish in other parts of the globe.Seems quite reasonable to me."
1465425,Moondog,2012-07-23 21:35:00,362,"Rest peacefully.........the USA is safe from my 2 tomatoes purchased at Sobeys in Red Lake. I told the US agent that he was really screwing up my planned BLT for dinner and he said, ""I get paid to enforce these laws."" ..........bad part was he was not smiling or joking. ......... neither was I."
