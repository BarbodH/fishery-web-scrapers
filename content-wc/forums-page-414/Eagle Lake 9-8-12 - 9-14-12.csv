1467874,Bobbajig,2012-07-29 20:11:00,24,Narda My wife and I will be at Eagle Lake Aug. 25 to 29. Are there any tips you could give us for finding some walleye. I wish we were staying at Birchdale but my current wife said I can't take her to a resort where I had taken my 1st wife. I stayed at Birchdale 4 times from 1996-1999. one of my best memories is my 5 year old son catching a 30 inch northern off the dock at Birchdale. Ernie Bruetsch was great. I hope the new owners will do as well. Any tips will be greatly appreciated.
