I guess the lake is only 4-5 miles North of the flyout camp in Dryden. It's their closest outpost. About the time you get in the air, you will be coming right back down. I've never flown with Pickerel Arm or been to Kabikwabik. Didn't know if anyone had some tips for that lake. Mainly looking for Walleye and Northern but was curious about smallmouth. I would take an afternoon off of Walleye/Northern if there were large smallies to be had. Any info would be appreciated. Thanks."
1462530,p0007,2012-07-17 09:09:00,78,"Not sure about that lake, but we use Pickerel Arm Camp and stay at another outpost every year and their service to us has been great! Good luck on your trip"
1462630,Cash,2012-07-17 11:22:00,73,We just got back from a week at PAC. Years ago we used to portage into Kabi. We didn't catch any smallies but the walleyes were outstanding. Ask about Eagle Point. Good Luck!

1462800,remmy,2012-07-17 18:26:00,6,"I've been to Kabi numerous times with PAC. Great lake and the group at PAC are too. Pickerel Arm Camp is just outside of Sioux Lookout, not Dryden. Just find the structure or outside the weedbeds for the walleye. You can print off the map of the lake from PAC's website and it even has a few hot spots marked on it. The first time I ever fished Kabi (also first time I had been back to Canada fishing in many years) my first fish of the trip was a 28"" walleye that I still have not been able to top....5yrs later.Can't answer your question on the smallmouths, I've never fished for them, sorry. Enjoy your trip!"
1466339,TroyMansfield,2012-07-25 20:50:00,92,"I have fished there lots in the winter and it is awesome then, I have never heard of any smallies coming out of there, but that doesnt mean there not there"
1466605,BennieS,2012-07-26 12:42:00,108,"A dozen guys from where I work were there second week of June. Their understanding was there weren't any there. They didn't catch any by accident either and for a change of pace, a few guys tossed plastics in lilely smallmouth areas while others were walleye fishing. Didn't catch any."
1466623,WAGGON,2012-07-26 13:11:00,3,"Thanks for the update. Sounds like no smallies. That's fine by me, more walleye for the pan. Yeah sorry, for my lack of knowledge on even the location of the lake. I'm going with a crew that I've never even met and they are planning the whole thing. I'm just showing up and going along for the ride!"
1466723,Red Pine J,2012-07-26 16:28:00,44,It's a short ride!!! Good luck!!!!!!!
