1467542,Guest,2012-07-29 01:22:00,0,"Joe, sorry to here about the poor fishing. We use to stay at Scout Lake Resort but have now been going to Fishermans cove for about the last 5-6 years. Great resort but hard to get into. We have always caught fish on LS. Like someone else said, I would get a guide for at least one day. We did that our first time on the lake and it helped. Since then we have found our own spots and have never been disappointed. What type of rig were you using? We always use bottom bouncers and spinners with worms or minnows."
1467619,IA JOE,2012-07-29 09:04:00,35,"Kino, Glad to hear that you had a great trip. Seems to be my story ""you shoulda been here this week"". I have lost any faith/hope I had left in the far NW end. In my three trips to the NW most guys talk about boating 30 minutes to Steamboat or an hour down to Mckinze Bay for the ""good fishing"". Why not move closer to those areas. I may have hit three slow weeks over the three trips. My stays at the timberlane lodge were great the boat, dock, cabin, service, people and price all met my expectations. I'm sure alot of folks have had great trips like yours but after three ho hum trips for me the ""Honeymoon"" is over for that area of Lac Seul. Possibly I just bite the big one as a walleye angler."
1467654,wallydave,2012-07-29 11:02:00,2151,"Ia Joe, I have always fished the NW end of Lac Suel We have been there from late May and early July.Usaully we have had fantastic luck. The earlier the better! To be honest the last couple of trips in mid June have not found great fishing, but we haven't adapted to the later patterns. Lac Seul is a great lake for walleye it's just a matter of trying different depths and techniques. I'm going again next June and hope to try some different methods. Fishing is about trial and error. There are plenty of lakes and each one will have it's own pattern. Good luck in finding the lake that works for your group!"
1467898,IA JOE,2012-07-29 21:45:00,35,"Wallydave, My three trips were 2006 early Sept., 2011 mid August and 2012 mid July. How early is early for you if mid June isn't it? The walleye opener is on the 15th."
1467930,wallydave,2012-07-30 05:17:00,2151,"The season opens the third weekend in May. Back in the day, the Sanctuary or the Wenasaga River would open June 1st. My boat and cabin buddies birthday! Now he is a school teacher and his boys are old enough to make the trip, we wait for school to get out. Plus the Sanctuary opens June 15th now."
1464967,IA JOE,2012-07-22 22:32:00,35,"Got on a few fish late on the 14 and 15. The 4 "" rain helped cool things down a little. The main lake was 78 degrees. Only found fish three times after that and the bite lasted about an hour each time. Only caught one walleye the last day and the morning of the 21st. What fish I could find were in 14 to 27 FOW except at the falls in 9 FOW(after the rain event). A few of the days at least one of the 6-7 boats in camp would return without hooking a single walleye. Best colors were white or pink. This is my third trip and it seems the fishing is getting worse each year. Is anyone with more years than I seeing/feeling this same trend on the NW end? To make it worse I stopped at the Four Seasons on the way home so the wife could pickup a gift and ran into a group coming from Woman River that had caught fish at every point they fished all week long. After having driven 900 miles and spent 6 days working hard to find fish it was pretty hard to take. Just a short 35 miles up the road. Seems to be the story of my fishing life. While the fishing was less than par the rest of the trip was great. It was the first trip for my wife and son. Both are hoping for a return trip next year. Not so sure it will be to Lac Seul. I'm thinking of a two camp/split trip but could only spend 3 to 4 days at each camp. Might be to much work for a relaxing vacation."

1465076,IA JOE,2012-07-23 08:36:00,35,A report on WRC would be great. Anyone have a report on WRC for last week? Our best day last week on the NW end of Lac Seul was 25 fish per boat of three anglers all caught off one location in about 1 hour. I was on the WRC web site and found maps/views of the portage lakes but none on the waters off the dock.
1465205,Guest,2012-07-23 13:42:00,0,"IW JOE i did my research and my buddy an I plan to fish 3 portage lakes snakewood, spot, and narrow have a good gps narrow is about 1 hr by boat and 10 minute walk in according to owner his favorite walleye lake 13 miles long the website from woman river lodge north of wrc states the best walleye lake on chain we plan to go once early in week and if that great will return later in week again;spot only about 6 miles from camp and a trophy northern lake (that is what I want and will troll and cast all day will report on trip if its as good as they say will make our annual last of may trip next year jim wolf chicago boys plan to rest the rest of days on chain little woman little bear etc"
1465358,Rivratz,2012-07-23 19:33:00,105,"What a Bummer week! Have you ever invested in a local guide the first or second day of your trip. They know where all the active spots are, usually. I know it costs, but, if they can put you on a half dozen or so active spots, should pay off for the rest of the fishing week. You should be slamming fish at Lac Seul."
1465380,rather-be-fishin,2012-07-23 20:08:00,429,IA JOE- sorry to hear about your bad luck fishing LS. Where did you stay? What areas did you fish? What lures/baits did you use. Did you fish McKenzie or Bay of Islands at all? Getting a guide is always a good idea on LS for the first or second day. We're headed up there Saturday & sure hope the bite turns around for us.
1465401,IA JOE,2012-07-23 20:52:00,35,"Stayed at Timberlane. The camp manager sent me to several spots two of which did produce fish for a very short time. I did make it down to McKinzie Bay but the wind was to much for the 17' Lund Outfitter. I did find fish off a point in East Shanty Narrows, at the falls and the Island west of Cox. Must have been some fish at Steamboat Narrows and the Wall as everytime I went it was covered by three to four boats and I moved on. We fished spinners, spinnerbait, buzzbaits, cranks, jigs, bobbers, minnows, leeches and crawlers. When we did find fish 3"" white twister tails or pink on 1/4 or 5/16 bubble gun jig heads tipped with a minnow worked best. One boat in camp found an 18' hump that dropped off into 25' that produced every morning and the fish hit minnows, leeches and crawlers. It seemed to be a top secret location and was not shared. A lot of boats moving around all day. Pretty sure none of the camp baots went to Mckinze the east and south winds made travel pretty rough. The west wind on Friday kept most in camp except before 7 am and after 7 pm. Most of the time at Timbelane one can hook all the walleyes you need off the dock but not this trip. If I was headed to the NW end of Lac Seul and the lake temp is still over 74 degrees start looking in 20-25 FOW. Good Luck and let us know how great your trip was."
1466771,J.Iverson,2012-07-26 19:09:00,64,"Joe, we were on Lac Seul the same week as you, I was with my wife and 2 daughters 30 miles east of you guys. I was up where you were last year (golden eagle) in warm water and found a 35 mile boat ride east was what it took to get into fish out in the deeper cooler water of the big lake, so this year we found lodging down that way. You are right that the boat ride can be rough, that is why we sought lodging further east for this trip to shorten our boat rides by 60-70 %. You may want to look into that for next year if you plan to fish mid-late July in the heat. Guys at camp were typically having 40+ fish days, some 100+ walleye days."
1467110,IA JOE,2012-07-27 15:02:00,35,"J. I., Thank you for the post. I'm currently looking at camps/lodges around the Scout Bay Area and possibly Woman River Camp. I talked with someone last year at the four seasons that was headed to Slate or Slave Lake?. He said it was plum full 15-17"" walleyes. Any info on slate lake would be great."
1467133,Kino,2012-07-27 16:43:00,101,"Joe, I was up there last week for the first time ever and had a WONDERFULL trip. Had a few days where you could catch as many as you wanted. Our last day there my partner and me boated two 27"" and at least 3 25""s. We literally could have caught all you wanted. I was with a great friend of mine with about 25 years of experiance on Lac Seul and he knows where to find the fish for sure. I will definately be back there next year! We stayed at Gold Pines camp and I can't say enough good about them! Don't give up just look in other places cause the fish is there!!"
