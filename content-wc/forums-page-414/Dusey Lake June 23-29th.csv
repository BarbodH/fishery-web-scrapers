Unfortunately, partly due to the short notice and partly to my logistic inadequacies, we had almost zero gear to try for the Brook trout which Dusey is most noted for. We did make the long ride up the river and down the river to the rapids at either end sans waders and with only standard walleye fare for lures. We caught a few walleye in the brookie areas. The four guys that came in after us were fully equipped and e-mailed me yesterday (they were on a short 4 day trip) that they caught quite a few very nice brook trout. The trip to either rapids is almost an hour with the camp boats and motors so we only did it once during the week. The camp is nice and I loved the layout of the cabin. Lots of room and although Brad's website claims it will sleep 10 there better be 4 guys that are REAL friendly as two of the 8 bunks are double beds. Nice hot shower in the utility cabin as a plus but the electric fridge was anything but an upgrade over propane. Brad has a generator which runs the fridge and lights but without solar battery backup you must keep the generator running too long. He said he will probably go back to propane for that outpost next year. Boats were dry and stable and I loved the Yamaha engines. Although not new they were well maintained. A couple other issues that bothered me- the website claims max of 22"" depth but we failed to find anywhere in the main lake over 9 feet. In fact a tall man might be able to walk across some areas. Also the site says it is 55 minutes north of Nakina. We flew in on a 182 and it took around 25 minutes. The point being I thought it would be a bit farther north.....The guys that followed agreed they could not find a deep spot on the main lake. The pike fishing was pretty good. I had a 39 and a few in the mid 30's and they were accidents while walleye hunting. The walleye fishing was dissapointing. We would catch 3-4 and that would be the end of it. Again the group following us had the same results. Shallow bowl shaped lake with weeds all the way out to the middle in places. Overall- nice lake, good facilities, very good trout fishing in the rapids. I think this is one of those lakes that must be hit early in the year for truly great fishing. Feel free to PM with any questions. Joe T"

Was really looking into Dusey Lake as a possible option for our group for 2014 after we head to Eddie North's in 2013, but this report has me a little weary now."
1467066,tooski,2012-07-27 13:26:00,393,Rag on me? Not sure what you are saying here. I posted exactly how the trip went. I even waited a week for the guys behind us to contact me in case we just caught a bad week. They pretty much confirmed what I wrote. Keep in mind that Mike was there almost a month ahead of me. Could (and probably did) make a big difference. Don't mean to rag on you but I think you meant leery and not weary. I'd rather not get into a public feud over one lake. I will always answer PM's.
1467072,rocko0305,2012-07-27 13:33:00,138,"I think I mistakenly used two words I shouldn't have (rag and weary). I only started off the post by saying I don't mean to rag on you because I wanted to make it clear that from your report and solo's report there were some differences that made me ""leery"" on going after initially reading his post about Dusey. Ends up that by saying that I got off on the wrong foot and that wasn't my intent at all. I completely understand you were just stating exactly how the trip went, and I also completely agree that the month difference probably resulted in a different experience."
