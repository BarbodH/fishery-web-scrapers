1467344,fisher_i_am,2012-07-28 09:43:00,498,"returned last week...eyes were at normal pattern on humps and points. only fished walleyes with leeches and crawlers on lindy rig with single hook trolling with electric anwhyere from 0.6 to 0.9 mph. biggest eye was 26"". A few also caught casting for pike and smallies. Pike were good trolling the points and bars after walleye fishing, biggest was 40""... with several 36-38"". Only snakes casting 5 of diamonds in the bays. Water was slightly above normal and water temp hovered in mid 70's. Finally completed one of my goals up there and got a laker on minnitaki. Trolling sutton spoons on three way with 6oz dropper. About 3 hours of trolling and one in the boat and another lost at the boat... nothing huge. Had a monster on last year and have had the itch since. Tried fishing smallies a bit more this year, caught a few but never got a pattern on them."

Hoping you reply to a few questions 1. How deep were you trolling with the linty rigs 2. how much weight and were you using bottom bouncers? 3) how deep were you jigging for eyes on humps and points/ Thanks!"
1467398,fisher_i_am,2012-07-28 12:35:00,498,1) any mid lake hump or extended point in water that is 15-25ft that's adjacent to deep 40+ft water 2)- 3/8-5/8oz walking weight 3)did not use a single jig.
1467419,scar,2012-07-28 13:41:00,196,Thanks a bunch fisher I am! Is a walking weight just a slip weight or is it attached to a straight piece of wire similar to a bottom bouncer? I love to troll and we have great success with spinner rigs in June when eyes are concentrated and in 8-12 feet of water. I have not had much success trolling in July/August as bottom bouncer rigs seem to always snag and not worth the hassle. Thats why I'm interested to hear your description of what a walking weight is. Thanks and I will send you a report on our 5 day trip.
1467423,scar,2012-07-28 13:47:00,196,"Forgot to compliment Fisher I am on the Lake trout. That is an accomplishment on Minnitaki in July. I have been on the lake ten years now and although I have little time trying for Lakers, Have not been able to hook one yet. May try Laker fishing by Lyons bay area this trip if the eyes are slow. Great pics of I assume your son, very nice walleye and northern."
1467427,SinOrSwim,2012-07-28 13:58:00,1528,walking sinker is any sinker that you use when using a bait rig I believe. Here is a link to cabelas secion of walking sinkers. I have never had good luck with those bell looking sinkers. I always use the no snagg style. More expensive but waaayyyy less snags. This is almost all we use when we go up. Usually minnow and sometimes worms. http://www.cabelas.com/bottom-bounce...-sinkers.shtml
