1466917,cma14,2012-07-27 08:03:00,6,"after a summer drought, it looks as if some rain is in the forecast for my first trip to Canada (Lac Seul)i'm wondering if anyone has some tips for me as to how best to fish in the rain? Do the fish go deeper? Do they become less active?All tips are apprecaited.CMA"
1466939,Golden Eagle,2012-07-27 09:03:00,2642,Wind direction might determine where you'll find fish.Best advice is to get off the water when lightning is a threat.
1466954,Bigfishhunter,2012-07-27 09:32:00,803,"when I used to guide people asked me this question all of the time. What I told them was this, ""it's not like fish get wet, rain has very little to do with it, pressure and temperature affect them more than anything."" I have found that this year with the hot and dry weather we have been having everywhere, the days that allow a change like rain and wind as well as temp drops have been good fishing. Actually I had a group of guys come up to fish with me the other day, and it was raining pouring and windy. This after a really long hot dry spell. Well they had their best day of fishing in that rain, the fish were biting and they got a lot of fish and some big ones too. As far as locating fish, use your electronics and fish smart, use proven techniques in proven locations, and if that isn't working, start changing things systematically. I change locations before I change techniques, and go from there."

1467086,houndog,2012-07-27 14:09:00,365,"I have to echo Golden Eagles warning. I've been catching walleye's like crazy, they were really biting during this warm Canadian Rain. After landing a nice one I looked at my son and noticed his hair standing up, his line hovering above the water and guess what? We got the he** out of there! Lightening isn't something to mess with especially if your the highest point around. Remember when searching for cover that trees get hit as well. I once saw three generations of the same family standing under the same tree. Save the gene pool from extermination use common sense, what you were told in grade school and spread out. houndog"
1467103,reconssd,2012-07-27 14:42:00,147,"Rain has almost always been highly productive. Especially if you can be on the water as the front is approaching. Always good to have quality rain gear. Wind swept points are great areas to hit. And as Golden Eagle has mentioned, if there is lightning in the area, get off the lake."
1467193,Hewhocookstomuch,2012-07-27 20:38:00,66,"If it is not to windy head to your favorite rock pile and catch fish. Once you see lightning or even hear thunder. Pack the rod away, start the motor and get yourself back to camp fast. Remember you are just a lightning rod waiting to catch a bolt. I have my best luck with walleyes fishing in the rain around rock piles."
1467313,lcwhit,2012-07-28 08:29:00,104,"rain, no problem. just fish. thunder and lightning, head for camp for both safety and it seems to give the walleye lockjaw."
1467346,Wyn,2012-07-28 09:49:00,112,An approaching storm.....check nearby weeds. Rain can bring current to certain areas so be mindful of that. Where you were catching them without rain though would be the first place to start.
1467366,octanehi5,2012-07-28 11:00:00,1104,"Rain and wind you will find very productive,in an approching cold front, after it goes by the fish will go deeper. during the day and come cruising shallow at evening time."
