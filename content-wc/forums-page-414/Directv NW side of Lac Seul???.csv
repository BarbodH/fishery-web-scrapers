1465379,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-07-23 20:07:00,84,I tried to Skype on our resorts wifi in June and it was to slow to work. The BTN app is pretty good but to stream 3 or 4 hours of video will be a pretty tall order unless the Internet connection is better than what we had at our camp. Worked well to check sports scores and news but that was about it. I sell Dish Network and I doubt you will have the correct spot beam to pick up local channels from Iowa. Might be able to bet BTN though.

1465492,NWwalleye,2012-07-24 06:38:00,223,"An American or Canadian, who is traveling in a different country, can call their service provider [ DirecTv, Dishnet, Bel lExpressVu or Shaw Direct ( StarChoice )] .. State that they would like to travel and use their Sat box , their Sat provider will set up a pkg fro them that can be used while traveling ..I know several people that winter in the USA and several the summer in Canada, who bring their Sat boxes from home. Set them up and watch TV, without notifying their respected Sat providers ( this is Illegal ).. But, none of them have ever been charged by the "" TV Police "".. At most their provider might do a check and shut down their Sat boxes ..Hopefully this is more clear ...PS. US Satellite providers use spot beam for their local channel line ups. DirecTV and Dishnet will not get any local channels ( CBS, NBC, CBS, FOX or affiliates channels ) ."
1465516,SinOrSwim,2012-07-24 07:41:00,1528,"We actually will be arriving late afternoon/early evening to our camp and we don't fish til the next morning. We usually take that time to get evrything unpacked, food put away etc and then sit around and drink beer and walk around the camp. So, we will have some time to set stuff up. The hope would be to have this tested and ready to go other than finding a spot for the dish and running some cable along the ground. There is an outside chance we would be able to set it on the deck right outside the door anyway. I think pointing it is going to be the challenge. I do know an installer and have been playing phone tag with him to get his help.We will certainly let you all know how it works, IF it works."
1465679,Guest,2012-07-24 13:50:00,0,Is 2 Iowa teams playing football really constitute a football game?
1465888,unclepaully,2012-07-24 21:46:00,112,"Iowa vs. Iowa St, what is that, like division 3 football? You might get lucky and find it on public access tv.GO BLUE!"
1465911,spikeidji,2012-07-25 01:11:00,10,"I do not know how they did it, but. Back a couple of years I was at Cliff Lake and the guys in the next cabin were from St. Louis and were die hard Card's fans. They fished till game time and raced back to the dock so they could cook and watch the games. Kind of crazy, but then they were bass fishermen. If I remember right one of the guys was a Direct TV installer or otherwise employed by Direct. Spike"
1466039,SinOrSwim,2012-07-25 09:10:00,1528,"I talked to the guy I know who is an installer and he said it can be done. He will be able to point the dish where it needs to be and then I just have to make sure it's perfectly plumb and level. Then, might need to make some minor adjustments. But, he is going to set me up with all the equipment I need for the SWM etc."
1466110,NWwalleye,2012-07-25 11:47:00,223,"What day and where are you staying . I might be able to help you, if you can't get it done ."

1464840,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-22 17:38:00,1460,"Sin, Way too much hassle to haul up all that crap. And Teddi is right, I'd hate for ya to have to hide out from the ""Royal Canadian Satellite Signal Police"" all week. Get a Slingbox.http://www.slingbox.com/go/slingbox"
1464855,Hawkfan,2012-07-22 18:00:00,237,"Not arguing the validity of it, but just wondering the reasoning...why is it illegal? If someone has paid for the components and the signal, why is it illegal to use that signal once you move to a different place on the planet? It's not like the signal is being pirated. Is it illegal to listen to satellite radio in your car once you cross the border? The same reasoning would make it illegal to use your phone in another country. And yes, I know asking why a government decides something is like asking a baby why its crying, but I'm just wondering."
1464956,Hawkfan,2012-07-22 21:35:00,237,"It looks like the BTN has an app that may solve our problem too. If not, that slingbox looks like a pretty sweet system. Thanks Slayer! Do you have one? Or has anyone else used a slingbox? Does it stream pretty well with little interruption as long as you have a decnt connection? User friendly?"
1464963,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-22 22:08:00,235,"As an Iowa alum, I just want to say I applaud this idea and that I hope you all find a way to incorporate the game into your trip."
1465052,SinOrSwim,2012-07-23 08:03:00,1528,I don't think the slingbox will work. The internet connection would have to be extremely solid and fast. We had wifi in the cabin last year but it was very spotty and if I remember correctly the one person who logged on with their laptop to check baseball scores said it was extremely slow as well. That is why I think the dish has the best chance of success. It would only be Saturday and SUnday. Unless MorganMan has a say. He will probably come in from fishign to watch Days of Our Lives and Dancing with the Stars.
1465061,Aaron-IN,2012-07-23 08:10:00,500,"I have a place on an Island North of Minaki, I've never done what you are proposing but one of my neighbors on the Island takes his DirectTV stuff up there every summer and uses it just fine. He has been doing this for about 15 years now."
1465062,NWwalleye,2012-07-23 08:11:00,223,DirecTV is not illegal in Canada.. Your service provider (DirecTV or Dishnet ) just doesn't like any Sat box not being in the residence that it is subscribed for .No one ( TV cops ;-p )will come and charge you for having it set up .Bring it and enjoy the game ..
1465348,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-23 19:17:00,1460,"Hawkfan, I don't have any experience at all with a slingbox. Just hear the commercials on the radio. As a diehard Hawkeye myself, I certainly understand your predicament. Go Hawks! Quote: Originally Posted by SinOrSwimI don't think the slingbox will work.

You very well may be right on the slingbox and the iffy internet connection. I just envision myself in your shoes when arriving at fishcamp. The very last thing I would want to do is screw around with trying to set up a dish and have it pointed correctly. I know for certain you guys want to get on the water as soon as possible or don't want to give up valuabe fishing time playing ""The Cable Guy"". Probably same scenario as slingbox but check out Direct TV's new ""Everywhere"".http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/conten...ctv_everywhere Cover all your bases. Talk with the Direct TV service guys, maybe it'll work. Just want you guys focusing more on your fabulous Walleye Tacos and less on the camp setup."
1464681,SinOrSwim,2012-07-22 09:26:00,1528,"This will probably get blasted by the die hard fisherman that want to leave all technology behind but we mistakenly scheduled our trip for the weekend of the Iowa/Iowa St football game. We were thinking of taking along a satellite dish and using a DVR to record the game so we can watch it when we get done fishing for the day.So, has anyone ever done this? Is there a place to find the settings on where to point the dish? THe plan is to take along a 5 gal bucket with a post in it. Fillt he bucket with a quick mix concrete and mount the dish to the post. Run some coax into the cabin and bring along a small flat screen. Or even better, fry up some walleye and sit on the deck with a cold beer and watch a football game. Some very smart and resourceful people on here, so I thought I'd ask."
1464684,Superfishman186,2012-07-22 09:44:00,383,Wow.
1464706,Jesse-WI,2012-07-22 10:52:00,534,"While I leave the tv at home, I have seen it more than once. Go do a search on ""directv tripod"""
1464719,SinOrSwim,2012-07-22 11:25:00,1528,"Just to be clear, we want to watch A football game. Not sit and watch tv all day long. Some may not understand it but I have no interest in fishing from dawn til midnight. Been going up for 17 years and have fished at night probably twice. We enjoy football a lot and I can't imagine much better than enjoying a fresh walleye dinner, a cold beer and a good football game. To each their own."
1464767,Hawkfan,2012-07-22 14:30:00,237,"If we can't be at the game, there isn't a better way to spend the day. Pregame fishing on Lac Seul for the day and one heck of a tailgate dinner while we fire up the tv. And there won't be anyone to spoil it by letting the final score slip before we watch it. Sounds like a pretty kick *** day to me."
1464788,81Saluki,2012-07-22 15:09:00,97,"I don't want to throw cold water on your idea and wish you a LOT of luck. Sincerely. You sure don't want to miss that game!But to make a long story short (from experience), it's HARD to get the dish pointed at the right (tiny) spot in the sky. There are 3 things you have to get right:Azimuth: compass directionElevation: above the horizonSkew: rotation of the dishTry using www.dishpointer.com to get the numbers. Find and then enter latitude & longitude of your camp site, then choose the type of dish you have (e.g. DirecTV 3 LNB).If you're off by 1 degree on any one of those, you might get all channels but the picture pixelates, or some channels might be clear as a bell while others don't come in at all. If you're REALLY LUCKY, you might get it pointed correctly in 15 minutes. On the other hand, it might take you hours of tinkering. This assumes the game is on ESPN or the Big Ten Network. You won't get your local channels up there!You also have a clear view of the southern sky, e.g. no trees in the area in the direction you need to point it. Elevation is low that far north (30 degrees or less) so you'll need lots of space, like open water, between you and the southern sky.Then there's the wind. I don't know how stable the dish will be in a 5-gal bucket filled with concrete. Any wind/gusts could cause the channel to go in and out or pixelate.And lastly, were you thinking of taking your dish off your house to use? If so, just remember that you'll need to get it pointed correctly again when you get back home!Hope that makes sense and doesn't scare you off from trying. PM me if you want to know more.Good luck!!81Saluki (in Des Moines)"
1464790,djk50164,2012-07-22 15:16:00,370,The problem you will have is trying to get the transponder for your local channels for the game. You will probably get some channels but the way the transponders are set for local channels its a spot broadcast. When you travel north your angle to the satellite will change most likely making the transponder unable to be found. I hope this makes sense.
1464794,SinOrSwim,2012-07-22 15:33:00,1528,"I have a second dish from when we moved last year. both identical. I also found a ""portable"" 5lnb dish with tripod for under $200. So, don't have to worry about re-pointing it. No need for local channels. The game we want is on Big Ten Network and the one NFL game, I have NFL ticket. The hope was to DVR the game while we are fishing and watch at night. I appreciate the help. Father in law is going and hasn't missed being AT one of these games in over 30 years. Was sort of surprised he even agreed to go with us."
1464805,teddi,2012-07-22 16:14:00,349,it is illegal to recieve us tv [dish or direct] in canada. if you get caught it could be very costly.
1464823,SinOrSwim,2012-07-22 16:59:00,1528,"Well, you had to go bring the law into this. Out of curiosity, who would catch me........I mean Hawkfan since this is ALL HIS IDEA? lol Directv? I can't imagine anybody in canada would???And by costly, how costly? We talking Hawkfan and MorganMan taking a 2nd mortgage out?? Because, AGAIN this is THEIR project. LOL"
