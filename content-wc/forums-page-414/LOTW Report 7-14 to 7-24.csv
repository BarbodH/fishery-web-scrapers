1467220,muskyman73,2012-07-27 22:40:00,402,"We used a 1/4 oz jighead or 1/8 fishing anywhere from 4-10 feet deep, fishing the weed edge and the lanes and pockets, the fish were shallow in overcast conditions and when the sun was up and high, they were often buried in the weeds. We used spinner blade arms, sorta like beetle spins, the key was gold blades, size 2 I believe. We used red watermelon flake yamamoto grubs, 3-4 inches and yum grubs too. Same set up year after year. Red crawdad rattle traps, 3/8 oz, reel and let them fall, reel and fall, gotta let them flutter and be prepared to loose some baits. The smallies all came on chunck rock shorelines, football size rocks are best, and the walleye are always mixed in there from time to time. Wind blown pockets with all the above mentioned were dynamite - all a stones throw away from obabikon , Jared lives in paradise on that rock !"
1467360,Slushfish,2012-07-28 10:35:00,263,"Thanks Guys, Like I said, its not like we weren't catching fish but, I can catch 10-15fish per day in the 18-24"" range any day at home, its tough to spend the time and money and not do much better up there. I agree Nestor Falls gets alot of pressure. We did fish Stevens and Portage a few times and saw alot of musky. Did well in Miles Bay but that's $120a trip and close to an hour each way. Maybe your right about changingt location. It would make it alot easier to get to the less pressured areas. I love that area and hate to throw in the towel. Ill look around. Slushfish"
1466126,Slushfish,2012-07-25 12:24:00,263,"Fished for a wk and a half out of Nestor Falls. Spent most of our time after eyes and a couple hours per day chasing musky. An average day we spent 6-7 hrs/ day and boated 2-3 dozen fish between two people. Most 12-14"" biggest 20"". Jigged reefs and bottom bounced shorelines and weeds mostly. LOTW is a fabulous area but if I'm going to travel that far I'm looking for more better quality fish. Third yr there, each being about the same. Enough fish to keep you busy. We did see a bunch of musky and landed two. Had great trips and great people all three trips but, for the time and money involved I think it's time to look for a new destination. Thinking about Lake Suel next yr. Looking for input. Looking for housekeeping plan using my boat. Thanks for the help, Slushfish"

1466318,1700SS,2012-07-25 20:20:00,104,"Do not give up on LOTW. I stay at Red Wing lodge. Middle of Saboskong bay and do real well. July through September. You can fish Miles, Sabaskong, Obabikon or little traverse. Housekeeping all the way, give Jared a call at Obabikon bay resort or Mike at Red Wing out of Morson.."
1466432,Gunner_Fletch,2012-07-26 06:58:00,74,Agree with last post.....you are obviously fishing in the wrong places on LOTW. I know...I live here.
1466506,srj,2012-07-26 09:29:00,971,"Slush, as others said, maybe the wrong area. Head west a bit and try the Morson area. Nice resorts and lots of fish, big fish included. Some days we are pleased to get a few in the 14 - 15"" class for supper. Most fish are bigger. Walleyes over 30"" are not common, of course, but not unusual either. Or head up the road to the Sioux Narrows area for a change of scenery (and water). Very clear water with fewer fish but they average very nice. Lakers, pike, musky, bass are good too. I'm sure you would like Lac Suel also. I've fished Lac Suel many times for many years (I'm getting old) and it is an awesome fishery. A good bit further but a great destination. Lots of fish including big fish. I haven't been there for a few years now mostly because L-O-W and Rainy have become world class. Tweak your location a bit and your catching will change a bunch. Good luck"
1466545,tv4fish,2012-07-26 10:54:00,2694,"We fish Lac Seul - we stay at The Red Pine (which is just south of Sioux Lookout) and do the housekeeping plan and we use my boat. Has worked well for us for a number of years now. If you're looking for more ""quality"" fish - here is a link to our trip this year:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...hlight=tv4fish"
1466689,jason brunner,2012-07-26 14:48:00,3,Your in the wrong area. Head north more into the Yellow Girl/Sunset Channel area and you'll do much better. If we don't boat 30 to 50 a day per man we had a bad day and each day usually brings in a bonus fish or two in the upper 20 inch range. We don't catch a lot of 15 inchers.......most range from 17 to 21 inches.
1466756,Guest,2012-07-26 18:15:00,0,"If I was to stay on LOW again, I would move north to Yellowgirl area as well. Good fishing. I Also LOVE Lac Seul and would definitely recommend trying it"
1466889,muskyman73,2012-07-27 07:10:00,402,"Our group use to stay in Nestor Falls and make the run to stony every day, now that was good fishing, a long reef dodging run, but stony portage is good in early spring, anything junish or late june and it's weed chocked.As for Nestor Falls, the pressure that area recieves it what makes it that way, however, that being said, there are still some really big muskies in that area that have gotten schooled becuase of it.Our group stays on Jared's Rock, Obabikon. You can fish all around the island without ever turning on your big engine. Year after year the fishing is amazing and very very few boaters at all. The amount of muskies and walleye compared to Nestor Falls is ten fold. The remoteness is great and the protected areas out of the wind are endless. On another note, our group does not use live bait up where we stay now, never have to. We use rattle traps, jig-n-spinner blades and eat our fair share of walleye, biggest this trip was 27 inches and a few more over 25And the muskies were going off on topwater too. And the smallmouth, OMG, the biggest I have ever seen in a while. It was a great trip this year."
1466962,Shorelunch,2012-07-27 09:48:00,554,"Two questions for you: 1) can you further describe a jig-n-spinner blades, and 2) what type of structure and lures were you catching the smallies on? Thanks!"
