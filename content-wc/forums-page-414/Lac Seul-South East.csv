We were in a meeting and someone said, these guys will be mentally checked out next week and my owner said, next week! They have been checked out for two months.Staying in the Banana Island / Taylor Island area. Would love to hear any recent fishing reports or spots people like. This will be our second year, first year was great, but would love to add some new spots. Thinking about some of the different narrows-Macleans, Windy, Bear. We fish walleye, smallies and pike. Thanks."

1467609,wintomatic1,2012-07-29 08:48:00,1,"We were there on a houseboat (""Faulkner? bay"") parked pretty close to Taylor Island. Very good bite. Had to change the reel handle daily from left to right side to let my wrists recover. We moved around a lot the first few days. The most consistent bite seemed to be in 17 to 27 FOW in low to medium chop. Also shallower in higher winds on windward shorelines. The toughest bite was a hot sunny day with no wind---dead calm waters. They were not biting on jig heads well at all, then one of us tried a small floating jig head about 6"" off the bottom and he started hammering them. Best fishing of all was at edges dropping into deeper water at 18 to 24 FOW. Boat control/ trolling motor was very important because most of the time they would be stacked up together and if you could hold over them it was go time. Don't get to focused on one spot, as the fish would move with changing weather conditions. I hope this helps you. ----Mistakes we made; 1) No leeches- the resort boats had no leeches available, 2) Minnows all died ($80 worth) so you need system to keep them alive. (Fortunately they bit well on jigs and crawlers/ or 1/2 crawlers + tail)"
