1214939,polaris-pete,2010-06-30 15:54:00,343,"They said they left because the generator only ran when the owner wanted to.They said sometimes it was shut off pretty early and supposedly their food spolied when the fridge got below temp. Not sure, just what the talk was at camp.I do hear the fishing there is really good in the river at times.We thought about driving up just to check the place out but after this fella came in decided that Pasha was just fine."
1467104,sek2691,2012-07-27 14:45:00,15,I ad 12 guys are headed to pasha lake cabins for the first time next week Aug. 4th. Wondering which lakes you suggest and would fish first again. Thanks!
1467507,eyemike,2012-07-28 20:42:00,233,"Lake Onaman is one fabulous lake! I fished it one year 6 days in a row. The walleyes are big and plentiful. It is a factory. I always want to start with Onaman, it just starts the week out right. It can really spoil you."
1467509,sek2691,2012-07-28 20:50:00,15,Thanks.
1467512,eyemike,2012-07-28 21:08:00,233,"There are so many lakes in this area that are so quality. Northwind is a good one but it gets its name for a reason. Ombabica bay is very good on Nipigon. There is a few rivers that are great fishing in the area. The owner of Pasha is a fisherman, he is very good at what he does from what I have been told and the waters that he sends you to are going to be very productive."
1200943,polaris-pete,2010-05-16 15:28:00,343,I will do this when we get back. You to!! Good fishing and watch out for the bears.
1214604,polaris-pete,2010-06-29 17:44:00,343,"Just back from Pasha Lake. All I can say is the 16 hour trip there was well worth the drive.The cabinns were very nice and clean, the boats and motors were all in good running condition and the walleye fishing was OUTSTANDING, to say the least. We only fished 4 different portage lakes and midweek we quit counting fish caught at over 300!! The possession limit up there is 1 fish over 18.1 inches and 3 of any size undwer this. We had our limits early everyday and I have never been to a place where you threw back constantly fish over 20 inches!!! The largest walleye was 26 inches and it was released. We caught many blue walleyes at 1 lake and sqaw many bears and moose. The water temp was 70-73 and seeing the fish had already spawned and went back into deeper waters because of the early Spring, some said the fishing was a little harder than last year same time but we had no problems.Some were in 16 ft. and some were in 4 ft. of water. The weather the entire week was very hot and bright sun ( not good for walleye fishing) but the same story, we caught them all over in all weather. No rain and laes were at times pretty rough and windy. There are something like 50 lakes in the area to fish and everyday you could go to a different one if you wanted to. The bugs were pretty bad also but you had to endure them if you wanted to fish. The bugsuits and reppellents worked great. If anyone has the chance to fish this area, do it. You will not regret it. The owner Chad is a very knowledgeable young man and went out of his way a couple times to ensure we had a great fishing trip. We will be back next year."
1214636,dcraven,2010-06-29 18:42:00,47,"For those of you that have been there, how good are those lakes for lakers (Beatty and Pasha, itself)? Decent size fish? Five or six fish per morning's fishing, or what?That has to be Onaman Lake on that clip. I've fished it out of Onaman River Resort and that looks like Onaman.Thanks,Dan"
1214681,eyemike,2010-06-29 20:23:00,233,"Pete, I am glad that you had a good trip to Pasha. That area is a hidden gem for sure. Good to read your report. It is amazing the quality of fishing in the lakes in that area. I thought of you and your group all week. dcraven Beatty is an excellent lake for lakers, real quality fish come out in the spring and winter. I have not fished it for lakers there past early June though so I don't know the summer pattern. Just down the road from Beatty is Paint Lake which is also very good for Lakers early in the spring. Beatty is excellent through the ice. ."
1214685,polaris-pete,2010-06-29 20:36:00,343,"Eyemike- yes we will be going back in the future.Thanks for all your earlier help.We still can't beleive how many walleyes are in these tiny lakes.One lake we fished you could see around the entire lake and we caught one fish after another. This lake is the one we caught a bunch of heavy blue walleyes. We released just about all the fish we caught just keeping a few for dineers.Funny my friend called last nite asking me if I wanted a 22 inch walleye for dinner. He and his friend had been out for 6 hours on Lake Erie and they caught this ONE fish. I told him thanks but I am kind of tired of eating walleyes for awhile.We met a bunch of great guys from all over the USA while up there. Guys from Iowa. Kentucky, Ohio, NY, Minnesota, Wisconsin. They couldnt beleive that we would drive almost 1000 miles 1 way to fish this area but at weeks end, we said we would do it again tomorrow!!"
1214691,polaris-pete,2010-06-29 20:42:00,343,Dan- the 2 clips they did was one on the Jackfish river jetboat trip and the other was not Onaman but a small lake 2 hours from camp. We talked to a guy that was at the Onaman River Resort and after 2 days left.Said he would never go back. He wanted to come stay at Pasha Lake cabins the rest of the week but they were all full.
1214694,eyemike,2010-06-29 20:47:00,233,I have told guys back in Iowa about the fish we caught in a weeks time and they almost look at you like you are lying. I just smile because once you have been there you will know. My Dad and I fished a lake called Clist that had blue walleyes. We only caught a few but they were sure pretty. Some of the lakes in the area are so dark in color that the walleyes a a beautiful deep gold. I could talk about that area all day!!!
1214725,bpetersen,2010-06-29 22:44:00,251,"Is Pasha producing any walleye at all? 25 years ago, it was dead for walleye, only lakers and white fish."
1214800,Fishing Traveler,2010-06-30 07:58:00,19,Pasha Lake itself does not have walleye but the surrounding lakes do. I'll be up there in August for some first hand sampling. Chris
1214912,dcraven,2010-06-30 13:59:00,47,"Northwind has blue walleyes (walleyes with blue coloration to the slime - not a blue pike) too. In fact, it has black, gold and blue walleyes. I wonder why the folks left Onaman River Resort? I was there with my wife, son and another couple of guys. If the place is good enough for my wife, it is good enough for anyone - she's picky when it comes to cleanliness and such. We stayed a week.The five of us caught roughly 1,500 walleyes in the six nights there, we figure...; plus brookies to 6.5 lbs and pike to 45 inches. DC"
1199588,Muskeez,2010-05-12 10:30:00,229,"Anyone ever been to Pasha Lake, ON ? I understand there is good fishing on the portage lakes around it, but how is the fishing on Pasha and lakes that you can get to from Pasha by boat? Thank you for any help."
1199690,polaris-pete,2010-05-12 14:36:00,343,"Hello- Cannot answer your question as this is my first trip there.We are going mid-June. From many others whom I have talked to, its a great place. Alittle far for me ( 900 miles) but the fishing hopefully will make up for it. A good fella here ( EYEMIKE) will probably answer you. He and his Dad have fished up there for many, many years."
1199757,eyemike,2010-05-12 17:10:00,233,"I spent many years fishing the area around Pasha. I have never fished Pasha but have one of the lakes in that chain called Beatty. It has got some great pike and lake trout fishing.The whole area is made up of small size lakes accessed by small boats off logging roads, it is an awesome area for walleye, pike, and lake trout. I stayed at the resort just down the road from Pasha. From my understanding, the owner of Pasha has done a real good job at his place. He is a fisherman and has boats at some very good lakes. If you are one that likes to take your own boat and it is a larger boat I would suggest that you leave it at home and use the resorts boats. A big boat will limit where and how you can fish these small waters. A trip into Lake Onaman Is a must! There is few lakes like it. Lake Nipigon is good for day charters for lakers and big brookies. From all that I have heard,listen to the owner of Pasha he is a straight shooter who will strive to put you on fish. I hope I have been some help. If you have any questions p.m me. Mike"
1200301,adempsey,2010-05-13 21:39:00,963,Fish'n'Canada did an episode on Pasha Lake. http://www.myoutdoortv.com/show-micr...hn-canada.htmlScroll down the list to find the episode.I believe they also listed it as one of their favorite walleye lakes (http://articles.outdoorcanada.ca/Hom...n258334p3.html).
1200577,bpetersen,2010-05-14 21:54:00,251,"There has to be more than one Pasha Lake in Ontario. The one I fished Northest of Thunderbay wasn't a very big lake and walleye fishing was zip but has some lake trout and white fish. There was a very small resort with only about 6 cabins. That was about 30 years ago, however."
1200579,polaris-pete,2010-05-14 22:14:00,343,"Same lake, same cabins. Walleyes are not found in Pasha lake itself. Only lakers, whitefish, and pike. Its the other 97 surrounding lakes that have the large populations of walleyes."
1200925,eyemike,2010-05-16 14:00:00,233,"I can not say for sure but, I would almost bet that the video was filmed on Lake Onaman. Its the one lake in that area that I know of that produces both the size and numbers that are shown in that clip."
1200928,MidWestFishman,2010-05-16 14:19:00,44,"The website looks really great for Pasha. Does anyone know if these are self guided lakes that they access to from Pasha? The rates are not listed on the website, possibly because they have so many trips to pick from. Does anyone know the price range at Pasha?"
1200930,polaris-pete,2010-05-16 14:30:00,343,Best way to find out Chad's rates are to call him. Very personable owner.I can't really say what my pricing is but its very reasonable. I do know he is booked SOLID for the week of June 19th-26th as that is the week we are going.
1200942,Guest,2010-05-16 15:24:00,0,"thanks guys. I kinda thought the same thing, that the best fishing wasn't necessarily on the lake where the resort is ? Very cool website that is obviously working well at drumming up business. He was full the week that I wanted to go so I bokked a cabin at a different resort in the area. Pete, please let us know how your trip goes. good Luck!"
