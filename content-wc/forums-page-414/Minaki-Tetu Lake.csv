1464937,Campcountry,2012-07-22 20:52:00,164,I haven't been up that far past Minaki but the fishing has been good and summer patterns prevail on the Winnipeg River sysyem. Right now the ankle biting stable flies and deer flies are out in full force and they laugh at regular insect repellent. Bring 95% or 100% deet with you as you can't buy it in Canada. Or wear long pants and two pairs of socks as they bite right through just one pair!
1465651,tilldawg,2012-07-24 12:45:00,55,I was up that way the first week of July (English River) and could not believe the black flies or deer flies or whatever they are called. You had to wear long pants and boots. Those suckers were drawing blood from us.
1466918,Slashorn,2012-07-27 08:03:00,19,"there last week in Minaki (both North (up to Rough Rock) and south (Duck bay)). Walleye fishing was a little slow but otherwise okay (much better in rough Rock). The muskies were not as aggressive yet, but should be picking up this week. I caught 3 30inch pikes. My recommendation is to throw #7 bucktails during the day and maybe larger in morning and in dusk as the larger ones were not working in the day. That said, have several large (45+) follows. Water level down a little but otherwise pretty good. Mosquitos very bad in the morning and at dusk. Flies were not that bad as long as you use ~50% deet"
