Pullen's Nagagami Lodge is also in operation, I believe, but can't speak to their accommodations. No matter where you stay, the fishing is great."

Kabinakagami was good too, but for us, the size of the fish weren't like that at Nagagami. I just assumed the OP was looking for outposts, not lodges.I am toying with the idea of trying either PK Resorts on Granite Hill or Buck/Bingwood on Obakamiga next year, if we don't fly out of Nakina.You'll probably have good fishing pretty much anywhere you fly in to from there."

Outfitter said he has boats on many , many of the small lakes in the area . The drive to this bear hunt is 8 hours closer than where we have been going . Plan on two fly-ins next summer so Nagagami or a trip flying from Hornepayne might be the ticket. Any info on the other fly-in lakes in that area will be appreciated !!"
