3609090,Pooch,2015-03-03 19:47:00,4619,That wasn't you on O'Sullivan about fifteen years ago was it? We were leaving camp one morning when a man and wife came paddling into the docks with a camp boat. They had paddled ALL night long when the engine failed the evening before. Felt really bad for them.Pooch
3609146,Blades-n-Beads,2015-03-03 20:01:00,484,"Pooch, that last reply of yours should be your eye opener. Could be you this year without your back up plan in place. Electric/gas it don't matter you just need one. Good luck."
3610570,green&orange,2015-03-04 08:46:00,28,"No - that wasn't me. This happened a couple of years ago on a backcountry camping trip. We donated the paint from my truck to the Canadian bush (I like to call it wilderness pinstriping) trying to get back to this remote lake/river system. That was an adventure in itself (driving through a flooded pond, over a hand made log bridge , overgrown vegetation, etc.) We finally made it to our destination and went fishing the next morning. Got way away from camp and the Johnson 6 Sea Horse died. My buddy tore up his thumb trying to start it with the cowling off. To make matters worse - the mayfly hatch was going full bore and the fishing was slow. Didn't help having to row everywhere either! Just a tough trip overall. We learned some valuable lessons that trip."
3610650,bigwalleye1,2015-03-04 09:00:00,2632,"10-4, but why does it always seem it's somebody else's character in need of building??? Where's that dang stir the pot icon when I need it??"
3610842,dutchboy,2015-03-04 09:36:00,5717,"Even on Rainy I have matches, newspaper and some dry kindling in a zip lock baggie in the boat. Remember, you don't need a cord of wood to start a fire, you just need something dry. I carry shims you get at the lumber yard. Small, dry & you can split them with about anything. Giant leaf garbage bags have also made it into my boat. But, in Canada or a remote situation I agree a back-up motor is good if you aren't traveling with another boat."
3610986,roscoe33,2015-03-04 10:07:00,653,"So, in this situation, who would you have called on the sat phone ?"
3611418,green&orange,2015-03-04 11:12:00,28,We have a friend that lives in the nearest community. 40-50 miles away- but still better than nothing. The sat. phone serves multiple purposes. It allows us to keep in contact with the families at home via text and gives us a way to contact the MNR/OPP if we had a real emergency.
3604066,AMPHIB206,2015-03-02 13:36:00,191,"I predominately fish lake of the woods out of Clearwater Bay. It's a large body of water. I'm anywhere from 2-12 miles from the launch. Because I fish with my 2 young daughter, I recently just purchased a 1991 4hp 2 stroke Yamaha as a back up. I will mount it to my transom this spring. That will be huge peace of mind for me. Even though I have a 24V Minnkota, I'm not sure that has 6 miles of trolling in it. In the winter I will never ice fish alone. I always want to have another snowmobile with me in case of a mechanical breakdown. Can't wait for the summer; the 4 hp has opened up a lot more water for me."
3604138,fergiefish,2015-03-02 13:50:00,197,"We fish Lac Seul every year and make two to three trips to Mackenzie. Always fish with a buddy, but I have a 9.9 HP kicker to alleviate most of my fears. Almost had to go back on the kicker one year. After a hectic day of fishing, I went to start the main motor and it would not fire. Looked under the motor cover to see if the fuel filter was clogged, cleaned plugs, and still no spark. The safety clip got knocked off and was buried under some clothes and I did not notice this until I started organizing the boat and saw the lanyard under a sweat shirt. Bad out of me for not seeing this right away, but I believe I am not the first one or the last one to have this happen to them at some point in their fishing career. A little embarrassing and I did receive the appropriate amount of grief from my ""buddies""."
3604482,johnboat,2015-03-02 15:08:00,2014,Big rocks and Wing Dams are my Achilles heel. Bad fuel.....I wish!
3604706,Blades-n-Beads,2015-03-02 16:29:00,484,"I was once told a 80lb thrust 24v trolling motor with full battery charge should move your boat at 5mph average, so if your using this as a back up plan in case your main dies you should not venture out more than 10 miles from your camp as you will only get 2hrs of full run time on your battery's. At full power. Granted there is a lot of variables here like wind you will be bucking, boat size and weight. But on average this will give you something to go by. This is based off a standard 4"" electric prop and your thrust sizing based off 2lbs per 100lbs of boat weight. Blades"
3604810,Bowtech84,2015-03-02 16:50:00,572,If you don't want to carry a small 4stroke motor for a back up plan because you are worried about the oil problems why couldn't you just drain the oil before you store the motor in your boat and bring a quart of oil with ya?Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
3604818,Carnhzkr,2015-03-02 16:53:00,964,Or why not just keep it on the transom tilted up?
3604978,brochet,2015-03-02 17:36:00,88,"its so simple its hard to believe it works so well.you really don't need anything to hold them together,the speed keeps them strait,and you can turn by just turning one motor.am talking tillers of course."
3605122,Pooch,2015-03-02 18:35:00,4619,"I've seen guys hang two camp motors on a camp boat and it worked fine. First time I saw it I thought ""what the.."". Then realized that it's not that bad of an idea in a remote area. Especially if moose hunting and having to bring a moose back to camp with a 9.9 or 15 hp camp engine.Pooch"
3608706,green&orange,2015-03-03 17:49:00,28,Oars. One day our motor died and we were a good distance from camp. Rowed back. We figured out it was over 6 miles. No fun. That trip was a total disaster from the get go. Now we always have a satellite phone with us in the boat - along with the oars.

3595450,NWwalleye,2015-02-28 07:06:00,223,"First of all ... Have a plan of attack for the day and stick to it .. Give as many details as to your location based on wind for the day.. We all know that wind is the major factor in fishing on LS .. Then , let someone know your locations and plans ..At least they will have an idea where to start. Might be a long wait though ..Second ... Buddy system !!Or do like I do .. Satellite phone ... Expensive... Yes !!! But, it is worth the cost when or if you get in the situation you are talking about .."

I knew that sooner or later you would offer to come and get me when I got into too much trouble, but I can't imagine how many years it would take for me to live it down. I suppose you'd bring Barry or Enrique with a camera, too.Hope I never need to take you up on the offer!! Good thinking idea of a small two stroke vs a four stroke. I was looking at a Yamaha F6 and wasn't yet convinced.How much ice do you have on the lake? It surely must be warm up there since all of YOUR cold air is down here in the flatlands.Pooch"
3596522,Guest,2015-02-28 12:37:00,0,isn't the 6 a noisy single 4 stroke???
3597522,Pooch,2015-02-28 17:04:00,4619,"I've read that it is noisy because the exhaust is not underwater, BUT... if I lost my main engine I doubt any noise would bother me as long as it got us back to camp.I thought I could justify (to myself anyway) looking at the F6 for use on small lakes around home that have HP limits, but the noise thing was a turn off. I still like Skywagon's suggestion of staying with a two stroke.Still thinking.Pooch"

3598314,roscoe33,2015-02-28 22:43:00,653,"Main motors go down for 2 main reasons.Bad fuel/clogged fuel system, and overheating caused by interrupted water flow to powerhead. Can happen to any motor, at any time.A 5 hp kicker is a lot smaller and will stow in your boat easier than you think.Gave my pops a 5 hp merc about 10 years ago, and it has been used to get him home twice. Both times he was 65 miles up the logging road, then 3-5 miles down a river.A text or phone call would have been no help at all, until at least the next day, maybe longer."
3598698,Skywagon,2015-03-01 06:48:00,1106,"I have an F4 Yamaha (4 stroke) hardly used, sitting in the shed that has let me down a couple of times because of the oil issue (long drive, then no outboard to use). Even after being laid on the correct side, oil still sloshed around getting into the intake. It is just the nature of the beast. I will only use 2 strokes now if the motor needs to be laid down, if they can stay upright, different story. Lots of ice here on our walleye lake, had to put the extension on my ice auger for use in the ice shack. The trout lakes I have fished this winter probably have 2 foot of ice, but that is not official, I have not measured. The weather looks a lot better in the extended forecast (no more -51 wind chills like last Sunday), so we should get in all the fishing we can bare from now until the fun ends in April."

3604042,MrSimon,2015-03-02 13:28:00,922,Do you have any pics of your set-up?
3593642,phishfearme,2015-02-27 17:01:00,1242,"for flyin single cabin outpost lakes with 4 guys (two boats) - pretty much what we do exclusively - we have a two prong approach. first, we discuss which section of the lake we plan to fish and agree to be back at the cabin by 5pm for happy hour and dinner. if one boat does not show up by 5pm we go to the second approach. second - we each carry longer range walkie talkies - can usually get a solid 5 miles and maybe longer and for the single cabin lakes this is pretty much all you need. if no boat back at camp by 5pm, turn on the radio and call. if no answer by 6pm, head out to the general vicinity they were supposed to be fishing and call on the radio again. (it helps if you are stuck to get into the open as best you can and stay there.) have had a few issues over the many years but never stuck over night. phish"
3593690,Baseline,2015-02-27 17:14:00,3207,"You don't say how old your rig is, but most newer and well maintained older motors are reliable. I've been stopped twice out on the open water. One was prop which I damaged and the other one was fuel. The ball cracked next to the clamp. The first one I had a spare prop, so no problem. The fuel bulb was unfixable, but I had a bow mount and a 24 v set of batteries. The bow mount carried us about 6 miles until a boat came by and offered to give us a tow. As a bonus we caught some fish while we trolled. I would get an electric motor and good battery. I always carry a spare prop, extra plugs, wire, clamps, fuses, oil, nuts & bolts, electrical tape, duct tape, insulated wire connectors, tools, etc. I've never used most of the stuff, but I've handed it out to other boaters. I always leave a day plan with the resort I'm staying at."
3593994,Pooch,2015-02-27 18:30:00,4619,"I've pretty well got all the bases covered as far as late model engine (40 yamaha four years old) spare props, tools, extra 2 gallon container of fuel, etc.. Our boat is an older Lund Rebel so space and carrying capacity is somewhat limited.I think my biggest concern is tearing up a lower unit and being disabled with no other means of propulsion.For the price of owning a satellite telephone, a person can nearly justify a small four stroke in the four to six hp range. Then not have to rely on anyone else more or less.We do pretty much what everyone has suggested about letting others know where we will be fishing that day. Usually leave a note on the kitchen table as to our area of fishing that day. Have done that only to have to move away from that area because of wind or conditions.On trips when we are with other boats we let each other know where we will be. If traveling a long way we try to run in pairs then fish separately when we get to where we are going. I think everyone that's responded has a similar system.My main concern is when my wife and I are on a trip alone. Spending a night on an island with a buddy would have a whole different outcome than stranding my wife and I on that same island!Thanks for the responses. Always looking for a better system.Pooch"
3594650,bigwalleye1,2015-02-27 20:31:00,2632,"Gary, I don't think I'd be able to find a big enough island either."
3594658,Blades-n-Beads,2015-02-27 20:32:00,484,"Pooch, by all means you need the additional two items for back up, just as you need rod and reel. Small gas kicker or 24v electric, and rented sat phone. It will take that bad thought out of your mind ""what if my main outboard goes down"" Blades"
3594994,Thompmd,2015-02-28 04:04:00,320,The only thing I would add is adding any medication(s) for not only yourself but your partners as well. My father is diabetic so we keep his meds in the boat with us.
3595114,TNtroller,2015-02-28 05:32:00,525,"Text messages will go thru with less or weaker signals than a voice call will, so you could text someone that you are stranded, have them acknowledge they rec'd your text and then they call the camp office (assuming they have a land line) and notify them of your situation. Flares/air horn in the boat would be good, possibly a starters pistol (fires blanks and if legal in your area), fire off 3 quick rounds which is a recognized distress call."
3595170,3M TA3,2015-02-28 05:53:00,2846,"Well one should always have an emergency kit on board at all times. It that kit should be medication for at least 24 hours. Your kit should also have emergency signaling devices such as flares, mirror, flashlight. A reliable means to start a fire is needed as well. There a numerous things that can go into the kit to help keep you comfortable. The more you have I suppose the more comfortable you'll be if something should happen. At a minimum be prepared for 24 hours without creature comforts. And above all else, let someone know where you're going and when you plan on returning, especially when going out alone. Oh, and don't forget the paddle."
3595202,tv4fish,2015-02-28 05:57:00,2694,"That's the main reason why I would NOT just rely on telling the resort owner. That happens a lot, especially if you decide to try a new spot."
3595250,Skywagon,2015-02-28 06:13:00,1106,"Just a thought for those thinking in the same terms as Pooch. A small backup outboard may not be a bad idea, but what you need too keep in mind, is the 4 stroke outboards, if not stored in the right position, or jostled around too much can leak oil out the intake. It makes a mess and they can then be very difficult to start if that happens. My vote would be go with a two stroke to stow in the front, they are lighter in weight, no oil leakage concerns and they will start. Yes, there are a lot of people running around on Lac Seul, but flagging someone down on one of those really rough/windy days may not be as easy as you would hope, don't think they would every hear your whistle or horn. Cell phone and text coverage can be spotty, depending on where you are at. Gary, rent a phone. You have a friend with a plane if the worst happens, but keep in mind, any rescue calls after the cocktail hour may cost you dearly."
3592130,Pooch,2015-02-27 11:48:00,4619,"Since my boat usually fishes Lac Seul alone and have only the main motor for propulsion I've always been concerned about what I'd do if I lost the main engine. I have no trolling motor or kicker.Most camps have this same basic rig for rent.I have a fixed Marine Band radio, but is there anyone who monitors any channel for emergency broadcasts on LS?I've thought about buying a satellite phone, but have not, yet. I have also considered buying a small four or five HP engine and keeping it stored up front, ""just in case"".Fishing with another boat nearby is great if there is one, but a lone boat appears ""on his own"" if there is a problem.Seems on the larger bodies of water in Canada this could be a potential problem someday for guys like me or those who use camp boats.Thoughts?Pooch"
3592218,tv4fish,2015-02-27 12:12:00,2694,"Pooch: We also fish Lac Seul alone, but the routes that we travel to get to our favorite spots are some routes that are fairly well traveled by ""others"" so we aren't that far off the beaten path. Is your situation similar or could you not get anywhere near a regularly traveled route?IMO: THAT might be your best bet (plus, do you do any trolling? as that would/could help you also)"
3592226,ftfarms,2015-02-27 12:16:00,444,I'm sure it's happened. I rescued a small flat bottom boat on lac suel one late afternoon. It was to windy for them to cross the lake so I got in front of them and broke the waves for them. I have a ternova trolling motor that I can troll for miles. I couldn't fish with out it. I've thought about renting a satellite phone for the week it fairlly inexpensive just a pain to go rent and take back. I think thay told me around $40 for the week. If you use it I believe it was .90 cents a minute.
3592266,MrSimon,2015-02-27 12:23:00,922,"Great question. I have a very simple rule that I never break. Never fish large remote waters with less than two boats. No exceptions. If we only want to fish out of one boat, we go somewhere more populated or with cell coverage. Having extra motors, fuel, batteries etc etc is definitely a good idea and will help in most situations .... but not all. I once towed my buddy in one evening after his big motor, kicker, and trolling motor all crapped out. If not for our buddy rule, he would have been stranded."
3592330,tuiflies,2015-02-27 12:39:00,158,Get a Personal Locator Beacon or Satellite Messenger and always bring appropriate gear to spend the night if needed.
3592482,Mike Borger,2015-02-27 13:04:00,1554,I handle this one of two ways.a. On really big water I'll throw an extra outboard in the bow of the boat.b. I always have a Delorme inReach satellite communcation device with me at all times when off the grid.
3592538,johnboat,2015-02-27 13:19:00,2014,"Nice thread btw, Pooch, The best plan might not be mechanical. I have an I/O. Yes I have the spare belts, props, 36 volt I pilot, Radio, complete tool box, etc, that most carry, which might all help at some time. But maybe the best plan is to cut to the chase and just have, water, blankets, plastic, etc...... You never know. I know I have saved some peoples butts out there on the big water WITH working equipment, and I'm not out there near as much as most."
3592546,Carnhzkr,2015-02-27 13:20:00,964,"If you're fishing out of Lac Seul Lodge, Onaway, or any of the lodges nearer to Ear Falls, there's hardly a time when you can't spot another boat. I don't know what the traffic is like around Mahakwa. I understand the concern, but unless you intentionally tried to find an area where you could be on your own, I think all you'd need would be some type of signaling device such as an air horn or loud whistle. One of those flair guns might be nice, but they're a little spendy. If I ever did find myself in a pickle on LS, one thing I'd try is see if I could get any bars on my cell phone. I wouldn't count on it, but I know I've received texts and emails while my phone was in my pocket out on that lake so there must be some reception somewhere.We rescued a boat that ran out of gas our first year on LS. We were fishing Steamboat Bay, along with a dozen other boats, and a boat from Evergreen waved us down. We made a run back to our lodge and the owner called Evergreen. They were none too happy."
3592642,bigwalleye1,2015-02-27 13:39:00,2632,"Iagree with some of the other posters, in that it's about layers of coverage. 1. Be prepared and able to perform minor repairs 2. I run a 9.9 kicker as well as the main motor. It's slow, but it'll get me home. 3. A set of jumpers 4. Travel the main routes, and esp. on long hauls or distant water, 2 boats together 5. Cell phone/marine radio/basic walkie talkie 6. basic equipment to stay the night."
3592746,btyreprich,2015-02-27 14:05:00,1067,"We always tell the lodge owner where we will be fishing that day. Hopefully he remembers!! I always have a supply of ""fresh"" road flares in the boat. these are stored in a case use to store welders brazing rods. Air & water tight. Flares are good to attract attention from far away or start a fire should you have to spend the night on the lake. I like the idea about a satellite phone though. Might have to look into this for our trip."
