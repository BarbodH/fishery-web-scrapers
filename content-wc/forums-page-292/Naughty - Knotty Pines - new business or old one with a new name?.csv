3580410,5ofDiamonds,2015-02-24 18:07:00,5,"I'm thinking about fishing on the lower English River near Ear Falls, ON. I heard about a camp called Naughty Pines but online I can only find one called Knotty Pines. Does anyone know about this camp?"
3581314,teddi,2015-02-25 04:02:00,349,Same camp new owner . Rebuilt after the fire.
3581322,ftfarms,2015-02-25 04:12:00,444,Is that called Anderson's manitou falls camp now?
3581570,Bakefish,2015-02-25 06:42:00,1077,Negative. Knotty Pines is a boat in lodge down current from Anderson's.
3583330,DanM57,2015-02-25 14:10:00,135,It is down stream from Anderson's and is now Knottty Pines Lodge. 2015 will be the 1st year under new ownership.
3584642,5ofDiamonds,2015-02-25 19:23:00,5,I booked for opening weekend. New owner seems eager to please.I'll let you know how it is.

I guess he didn't want disappointed customers that expected an orgy every night. Each summer I host a neighborhood golf tournament I call The Naughty Pines Invitational. Grab your balls and play a round at Naughty Pines."

I wasn't impressed then, but now, looking back i'd say I was as much to blame for the lack of fish as the place was. I knew absolutely nothing about Canada walleye fishing back then. Cool resort though. Good Luck!"

Lol.We did run into some other hunters who were doing good and said the system doesn't have much pressure.If you can't catch fish on this river, maybe you need a lesson! Simplest fishing spot I've seen in a while."
