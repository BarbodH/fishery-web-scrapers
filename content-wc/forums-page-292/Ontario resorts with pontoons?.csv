3594634,bode,2015-02-27 20:19:00,39,"Bear Paw Lodge on Caribou Lake near Armstrong rents a pontoon. Have never stayed there but fished Caribou Lake the last 11-12 years. I stay at Caribou Lake Lodge, but have seen Bear Paw's website and know they have a pontoon available."

3602530,MrSimon,2015-03-02 07:44:00,922,"I'm a HUGE fan of pontoons for fishing .... IF they are set up properly for fishing. Trying to fish from a pleasure pontoon can be terrible. When renting, make sure ahead of time how the boat is set up. Fishing chairs at all four corners is almost a must. An open floor plan is better than lots of couches. Two anchors is important as the wind can really push pontoons around. A good powerful trolling motor is nice, but not necessary. Under-powered pontoons can be slow and cumbersome, but with the proper motor they can move along quite well. And most pontoons 20' or longer are surprisingly stable in choppy water. I like them so much I bought one of my own over the winter. I'm rigging it up exactly how I want it and can't wait for open water to try it out!"
3591658,Herkyhawk00,2015-02-27 10:30:00,36,"Hi, I am wanting to take my 3 children to a great fishing lake in Ontario. Ideally, a pontoon would be great as it offers them a little more comfort and ability to be on the lake longer. I haven't been very successful in finding one. Any help would be great."
3591730,Obabikon,2015-02-27 10:35:00,2370,"Unfortunately, I'm unaware of any. However, purchasing one has been something I've been tossing around for quite a while. Seems like it would allow people to be wheel chair/handicap capable. Anyhow, sorry I couldn't help, just thought I'd comment."
3591786,Fisherman Ted,2015-02-27 10:43:00,461,Send me a PM. We have one for guest use. -FT
3591834,LOW1,2015-02-27 10:51:00,2828,"http://www.whitefishbaycamp.com/rateshttp://www.tomahawkresort.com/info.cfm A pontoon may not be the sort of thing that is advertised on a website, so others may have them even though they aren't shown. So email a few resorts which you are interested in and see what they have. I certainly have seen an increased number of pontoons over the last few years."
3592010,Herkyhawk00,2015-02-27 11:17:00,36,This is a GREAT site. Will probably get me fired one day as it takes up too much of my time at work. lol Thanks for the quick responses.
3592154,adempsey,2015-02-27 11:56:00,963,I know plenty in Southern Ontario. Where do you plan on heading?
3592906,Carnhzkr,2015-02-27 14:36:00,964,"Qlake Lodge is in Manitoba, about 3 hours north of Winnipeg, so may not be where you had in mind. Dynamite walleye and smallmouth, though. They have a pontoon. I always wondered why anyone would want to rent the toon since they're fairly expensive and wouldn't be nearly as good to fish out of compared to a Lund Outfitter, but I think Obabikon makes a good point about being handicap accessible. Hadn't thought of that."
3593074,Fisherman Ted,2015-02-27 15:05:00,461,"A pontoon boat is actually super cool. Never thought I would say that. It's like saying a mini-van rocks. But in all seriousness it does. A nice pontoon boat can be sweet. With a bimini top you keep the sun off on a hot day, or the rain out when it's raining. Very comfortable to relax in if you or the kids get tired. They have live-wells and rod holders just like a Lund. And tons of room. Captains chairs for fishing out of. If you have kids they can have a blast, jump in and swim if its slow (there are swim ladders).Plus they have a nice radio and are pretty stable in crappy weather. They even have changing rooms and mini-bars.Trust me, I am the last person I thought would say this, but I have guests that love them and grab that over a $20,000 bass boat. I can see why.-FT"
3593202,Herkyhawk00,2015-02-27 15:27:00,36,"Adempsey, I think Red Lake would be about as far as I would want to travel North into Ontario. I probably wouldn't inquire about the pontoon if I wasn't wanting to improve the experience for my kids. Sitting in a boat for long periods can be a nightmare for a kid and doing this allows them to walk around the boat, and allows me to provide easier access to help them with their lines and netting fish. Comfort is the big thing for accommodating my three kids and making the experience a lot more fun. Like Ted mentioned, though you sacrifice speed and maneuverability with a pontoon, it's a pretty darn good option to have for a resort."
3593314,prov1800,2015-02-27 15:38:00,5010,"Stanleys west arm camp on eagle lake offers the use of a pontoon boat.i have guided bigger parties on them snd are fin but catching fish is another story.very hard to maneuver,even worse when its windy.thats why hardly anybody uses them.iam sure theres more camps where they are available but i suspect they would be for just a day of touring."
