That said, those who would have interest just don't have the financial means or the sack to just tell wife he's going fishing with the guys for a week (who here would have been granted ""permission"" asking on advance?) Anyway, I'm considering a 2nd trip if I can't pull off 2 separate trips myself between friends and family. Personally, I'd like to go to Schewabic Lake through Air Ivanhoe. This lake was my first fly in trip in September 2013 and I've learned a lot since then. I think I'd fare a lot better knowing what I know now. http://www.air-ivanhoe.com/fly-in-fi...-schewabic.phpI'm not locked in to a certain week or even a specific month. it's a nice cabin with indoor shower, generator/solar system, pretty much all the luxuries you'd need to be comfy. George runs a pretty top notch operation and flies their own aircraft. Air base is in Foleyet. So, would anyone under similar circumstamces be game for a trip? Need a minimum of 4 people with a max of 8.Anyone have interest?"
