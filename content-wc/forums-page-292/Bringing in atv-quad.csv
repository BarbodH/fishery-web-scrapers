We were crossing at Piegeon Falls several years ago with 4 Atv's on a large trailer for a combo bear hunt and fishing trip. My hardheaded friend who did not have his serial number for his gun was upset that the female border guard who went to get the serial number dropped some of his equipment out of his gun case when she examined his gun in the parking lot. He told her to watch what she was doing. The next thing about 4 agents begin looking over our trailer and told us we could not come in to the country until every bit of mud was off the Atv's. We turned around and spent 3 hours unpacking the trailer and washing them with a garden hose at Ryden's store. We got back to the Canadian border crossing and I pulled up and told the same lady who inspected us the first time that the Atv's were clean and ready for inspection. She replied with a smile ""I don't need to see them"" A great example of there I showed you! My friend who caused the issue was mad but the rest of us told him it was his fault. Moral of the story be polite, only answer what they ask you and do not give them a reason to show you what they can do to you."

3596602,fishead,2015-02-28 13:10:00,41,"I bring mine across all the time , but I cross in Detroit. Never been asked for anything. But I bring proof of ownership."
3596914,roscoe33,2015-02-28 14:40:00,653,"Taken several across, multiple times.Make sure it is clean, no mud, etc., as CBC has been known to turn you back at the border.Its the whole contaminated soil issue. Have seen guys turned back, had to wash their quads at the closest gas station with a hose."
3596946,cummins80,2015-02-28 14:47:00,4,If your importing it has become a bit of a hassle as the US border require use of a broker.
3597018,BornToFish,2015-02-28 15:16:00,1224,"The folks that already posted offered excellent suggestions. My buddy routinely takes snowmobiles and ATVs across the border into Canada. He cleans his machines before leaving to make sure they are presentable - especially no mud. The Border Services personnel are regularly on the watch for stolen machines. Thieves have been taking their stolen machines into Canada and selling them for cash. You will want proof of ownership with you should they be watching for a stolen machine that resembles your machine. Hopefully they won't ask for proof of ownership, but if they do you will be glad that you have it with you. Safe travels..."
3598682,fsz,2015-03-01 06:35:00,144,Thanks guys. The no mud thing makes sense. The title could be a problem since its my Father-in-laws machine I was going to borrow.
3598874,BornToFish,2015-03-01 07:43:00,1224,"My wife and I went to a fishing lodge in NW Ontario a couple of years ago. We fished together for one week, and then she needed to return home for work. My best friend drove her car to the lodge and fished with me for the second week. My wife then drove her car home the next day. I prepared a letter for my friend to keep with him when he crossed the border. I had a lot of information in the letter, such as follows: VIN number, my wife's name and address, his name and address, the dates of travel to and from Canada, where the car will be staying in Canada (i.e. the lodge's name and phone number), why my friend was driving her car, etc.. My wife and I then had the letter notarized. I attached a copy of the vehicle title (stamped COPY). Without prompting, the Border Service agent asked my friend why he was driving my wife's car. He produced the letter. The agent read the letter and said he was good to go. Hopefully, you won't be asked about the ATV you are bringing into Canada. If you are asked, you will be very glad to have some documentation backing you up. Be prepared for a very long day if asked and you don't have the documentation. I hope you make some great memories in Canada!!"

3599330,BornToFish,2015-03-01 09:25:00,1224,"PlumberJoe,Thanks for the update. I'm pretty sure that you are spot on correct with both of your comments. I understand that Ontario law requires everyone in our group of fishermen to wear a helmet when we are on snow machines. I wouldn't be surprised about the same law for ATVs. My buddy does carry with him proof of insurance for his ATVs and snow machines. In fact, my buddy now has me doing the same thing for my auto insurance. I get a ""yellow card"" from my auto insurance carrier (no cost for this) for proof of auto insurance. I understand that the proof of auto insurance isn't required by Ontario law, but will great simplify things if there is an auto mishap. Kindest regards....."
3599698,fsz,2015-03-01 11:27:00,144,Thanks for reminding on the The helmet and insurance. Those won't be a problem. The notorized letter should handle the ownship issue I hope.Thanks for the ideas guys!
