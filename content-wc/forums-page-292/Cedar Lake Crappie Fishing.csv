3594866,Guest,2015-02-27 22:47:00,0,guys I still had a good time because I love the outdoors and we all want to catch fish but as in life it does not always work out seems like july and august were much better months and you guys probably have better equipment and better techniques than us we fished mainly in 10-12 ft per owner's instructions it seems like sept ther normally deeper( have done over 35 trips to Canada) going the last week of may to last resort on English river about an hour north of kenora run by the Indians who we know from the past (every reliable) built 3 new cabins on a peninsula using their boats with 20 hp miles of water to fish plus 2 smaller lakes dumpy and scotty about a 45 minute ride that 90% of time high enough water to boat in the lakes contain lake trout and are very shallow that time of year a few years ago 4 fishermen caught 20 lake trout only made the trip 2 days largest 17 # great smallmouth water $555/week /man for housekeeping and camp boats plus 6 gallons of gas/day per wc recommendation o'sullivan rainbow resort north of nikina mid sept almost completely sold out for season unbelievable jim wolf Chicago boys
3595850,1jigfish2,2015-02-28 08:24:00,110,"Wolf1931, Glad that you still enjoyed it. A trip, be it fishing, hunting, or traveling can throw conditions and things at us that are not always great. It is up to the individual to make the best of every situation to make it a memory. Cedar is an unbelievable body of water, you just hit it wrong. It is too bad that the lodge owner told you to fish that depth. We catch most of our fish in 25' plus, at that time of the year. If you are fishing an area that does not produce fish, change tactics, then location. We fish everything from 6'- 42' almost every time we go. We hit our ""hot spots"" first, if not great success, we move. If no success, we go hunting different depths. We find the fish, then fish that depth all over. It has worked very well for us. I wish you luck on your trip this summer. iIt is fun to go up, every time, and experiance nature. Remember, if you are not having success, change tactics, then depth. At that time of the year, fish are everywhere and all depths. We also go up opening week, and catch fish from 6' - 42'. To me, there is nothing better than jig and minnow (we get free bait at our camp), at a deep depth, absolutely love it."
3596162,eyeboom,2015-02-28 10:17:00,940,"We fished Cedar the third week in August last year and did well. Could have anchored up and jigged or slip bobber for all the 10""-13"" crappie we wanted but since this wasn't a ""meat"" trip we mainly fished walleye. We caught the crappie in 10'-15' of water in the Bald Rock and south Grassy Bay area. Biggest walleye was 27"" and was really impressed by how hard ALL sizes of walleye fought. CPR'd the walleye and kept crappie for lunch.As mentioned before, we had to hunt to find the aggressive fish, depth, presentation and location. Stayed at Cedar Lake Lodge and hit a couple of spots on the west side that were recommended. After 2 hours and 2 12"" eyes we started hunting them down the rest of the day, made the move over the east side and had them pretty well dialed in by the end of the second day. Bringing our own boat made making the longer runs feasible.Phil"
3598530,Guest,2015-03-01 04:56:00,0,"fishermen thanks for all your help will definitely fish 20 ft + in sept for walleyes we really never fished that deep probably our problem jim wolf Chicago boys purchased a fly rod and takeing free lessons at bass pro in fort Lauderdale plan to fish for smallies on the surface at our English river trip last week of may fly rod definitely more difficult than spin cast a real art learning it but after a 1000 casts its coming around; hard getting use to such ""light line"" without ""heavier"" plug and all the excess line by your left foot the flies and small plugs are so very light"
3609306,nitroman,2015-03-03 20:45:00,368,All the crappie are gone now and the walleye population is nearly gone as well. Might as well drive right by Cedar and head to Lac Suel I hear its a regular walleye factory up there. I do enjoy my week of looking at scenery around Cedar though. Prolly leave the rods and tackle home this year no need for them since there are no fish left in that lake
3609338,1jigfish2,2015-03-03 20:55:00,110,"Nitroman, that one tree by the shore on the west side looks really nice. That is what we go to see, catching fish does not matter."
3582762,Andyeye,2015-02-25 11:25:00,179,"I'm sitting at my desk today with a bad case of fishing fever watching it snow. We are going back to Cedar Point Resort August 8th this year. Last year we had a great trip catching walleyes and smallmouths. Our biggest walleye's were 26"" and smallie's around 17"" hope to improve but no complaints. I know that there is some good crappie fishing and guys there last year the week after we left in August did well on crappies. I was hoping someone might have some tips on where to try for some crappies and what techniques worked for them at that time of the year. Thanks"
3582834,troutwater,2015-02-25 11:37:00,299,"My cousin and uncle got into them once up in Nelson around some lillypads, but that was the only time in that lake in probably a dozen times fishing it, and they were fishing for perch. What I've heard most is that the old blown up bridge in the river is the best spot to try, but never chased after them myself. Sorry probably not much help, but hopefully some others can be."
3585146,1jigfish2,2015-02-25 21:47:00,110,"Troutwater is correct, that is the location. We do well back there for them. The ones that we caught were 10""-13"". We get them whenever we go there, but we only fish spring and fall, not summer."
3586250,troutwater,2015-02-26 08:38:00,299,"Good point on the time of year. Our group got into them in the middle of the summer, but like I said it was just merely by chance. They still pulled out some hogs though!"
3589618,Bill Krejca,2015-02-26 19:31:00,6107,"If you go in the fall, generally up north the crappies will be congregated in the deepest water in the lake. This almost always holds true, except in the really deep trout waters. Going in August, you might still try the deeper water in the area, there can be a few hanging out there. Bill"
3590202,Guest,2015-02-27 04:30:00,0,"andyeye we fished cedar point resort on cedar lake last mid sept the resort was great along with owners the lake is horseshoe with the resort at the top of the shoe walleye fishing 10 hrs/day just average at best some days 3 fishermen 10 walleyes all day I caught 8 crappies mostly in shallow areas near shore under branches over hanging the shore line (per owner instructions) highlight of trip 2 other fishermen in group casting all day 2 muskies 45"" and 47"" 25# very close to camp I personally would not fish cedar lake again jim wolf Chicago boys"
3590474,Andyeye,2015-02-27 06:31:00,179,"Jim, I'm sorry to hear about your luck at Cedar Lake. We were there the 2nd week of August last year and my fishing partner and I caught over 100 fish a day 3 of the days and around 70 the other days except the last one when a thunderstorm came in and we went in after we had boated almost 40. There were four of us altogether the other 2 guys were doing about the same all week. We caught a total of 16 I think over 22"". I had a trip to Lake of the Woods years ago in 4 days we boated 2 snake northerns 3 smallies and 2 walleyes. This was in the Sabaskong Bay area and that trip soured me on that place. When we got to Cedar Lake last year fellow WC member Rich and his group gave us some tips that put us on fish right away. Ray told us of some other spots that were pretty productive as well. We fished only the east part of Cedar Lake and it sure seemed like a lot of boats came over to that part of the lake from the west. We only caught 1 small Muskie all week and no crappies. We all thought it was a very good trip and booked for this year. I hope we can at least match last years trip but I know they call it fishing for a reason."
3590690,ftfarms,2015-02-27 07:22:00,444,I fished cedar in mid sept and hit a cold front and didn't do very well but I've fished it in July and first part of August and I averaged 100 walleyes a day and 30 smallmouth. I think it's one of the best small lakes up there. I haven't tried for crappies yet so maybe next time. We fished for musksy that week in September and had a mid 40s at the boat and a 50 at the boat but didn't get either in the cradle. Don't judge a lake by fishing it once because it was the September week that was my first on cedar. If I didn't go back the next year in mid July I wouldn't have found out how great of lake cedar is. I also stay with ray at cedar point.
3593002,revitup,2015-02-27 14:52:00,140,"I fish Cedar in June each year and I personally hope everybody takes Jim Wolfe's advice and doesn't even consider Cedar. No crappie, no walleye, no musky, no smallies (wink, wink) I just can't figure out why we go back each year. Must be the scenery."
3594730,1jigfish2,2015-02-27 21:00:00,110,"Revitup, Awesome reply, I love it. That way we will have to suffer alone. The lake is surrounded by some beautiful trees. It would be nice to just get something for dinner once, instead of having to go to town to a restaurant."
