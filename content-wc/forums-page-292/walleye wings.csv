3592978,revitup,2015-02-27 14:45:00,140,"never had heard of this before, but you guys got me hooked. I'll be making wings next year and have decided it's worth it to do the cheeks on all our keepers."

There is no doubt that is much easier to do this on a larger walleye, as there is more flesh to deal with. Thanks Bobby, that's the 3rd or 4th time I've heard someone suggest sharpening a spoon and gouging the cheeks out so that sounds like something worth trying. Otherwise I'll have to start keeping those larger 25""-32"" walleyes to practice on instead of our normal 16""-17"" that we normally keep for meals. You know what kind of a Brou-ha-ha that would have started, and you know how I hate confrontation, so I'll use your suggestion."
3604266,Rock Hound,2015-03-02 14:16:00,51,"I only had them once, and they were on decent sized fish (16 - 18 inches), and I thought they were OK . . . I didn't think there was much meat on them and I didn't think they were worth the hassle. I do LOVE cheeks though, and like the thought of utilizing more of the fish with the wings, but the one time I did try them I really wasn't very impressed. I may try it again after reading this, but I usually do like to eat those 15 and 16 inch fish and just don't see much meat there."
3606154,Consigliere,2015-03-03 07:40:00,132,Anyone ever done this with other fish? I assume something like a northern would be good too?
3587890,bcmss396,2015-02-26 13:42:00,296,Just looking at the pics make me hungry. Definitely a new part of the cleaning routine from now on. I bet a bag of those is a nice snack. Thanks for the tip guys! Blair

Makes my mouth water just talking about them!! Come on May !!!"
3591034,troutwater,2015-02-27 08:28:00,299,"I must admit, I have never heard of ""walleye wings"" before. Now I'm curious and may try them next time I get a walleye, thanks."

3591866,deadhead1,2015-02-27 10:57:00,193,"I learned how to do ""wings"" and cheeks a long time ago but I just don't bother with them now. Next summer I am going to have to start again. The wings are best meat on a walleye. I just fry in butter and garlic, no breading at all."
3591938,Steve Ediger,2015-02-27 11:08:00,97,"Our group calls the wings ""Poor Mans Shrimp"". We take the wings and, using a knife, usually heavier than a fillet knife, split the wings into two equal pieces. When you deep fry them you can use the fin as a handle, like the tail of a shrimp. The meat will slide right off into your mouth leaving the fin and bone in your hand. Very tasty and fun to eat."

3586578,bigwalleye1,2015-02-26 09:30:00,2632,"10-4!! I save all the wings and cheeks and those are for football halftime in the winter, or an appie for a planning session for Canada."
3586626,Algoma Guy,2015-02-26 09:35:00,48,By wings I'm assuming you are talkin about the two fins under the belly of the walleye? I've had some american clients do this they swore it was awesome. Keeping cheeks is a must! If you don't have enough at the end of the day just save them up for the week and have a big feast! I cook them like I would cook a scallop or I wrap them in bacon. Then again anything wrapped in bacon is good!

3587690,tooski,2015-02-26 12:56:00,393,"TV, Great photo. It says beware of the bones however. Can the wings be boned prior to frying or eat around them like trout?"
3587762,tv4fish,2015-02-26 13:15:00,2694,"I think it best to ""eat around them"". (Personally I STILL prefer the cheeks). Otherwise, eat these like shrimp with the tail still on."
