3599018,Blades-n-Beads,2015-03-01 08:21:00,484,What's the report from the great north on snow cover this year guys? Last year it was brutal snow depth at this time. Two years in a row with late ice out and not so good roads. Just wondering on your currant snow levels compared to past couple of years. Blades
3599082,bigwillies,2015-03-01 08:35:00,515,no where close to what we had last year.my guess would be around 2 feet total.
3599394,Skywagon,2015-03-01 09:41:00,1106,"It depends on where you are as to snow depth, but most of the un-traveled trails have slightly over 2 feet of snow right now. Not near as much as last year where it was over waist deep (I am 6'3""), but still enough in places to get stuck with a snow machine if you are breaking trail and make a misbobble."

I know there can be some big snow storms moving through in the Month of March but hopefully they will move way south like most of the way this year has gone. Some good freinds of ours live in Kenora right on the lake and there dock was under water last year until August. Thanks"
3608106,tswoboda,2015-03-03 15:36:00,12,"Snow Depth Map 2015Snow Depth Map 2014According to this map there's a foot to foot and a half around Kenora and around 2 feet in Dryden. Same time last year, both areas were around 4 feet. I will echo your comments about last year being terrible travel conditions on the lakes and 2013 wasn't much better... I'm really looking forward to a break from that this year."
