Plastic swimbaits can be rigged sideways on the hook giving them three times the life. Continue the retrieve after a missed hit. Many times the fish will hit again because the soft plastic feels real."

1108213,Guest,2009-05-26 13:23:00,0,"I have viewed on In-Fisherman, and been reading a lot, regarding using swim baits for large walleyes. Has anyone tried this? If so, what techniques do you use? Do you cast and retrieve, jig? I don't know if it is similiar to using Gulp! with a jig or if it is more like using a crank bait. If you have had any success with this technique, please share. Also, do you find that you can catch bigger walleyes with them, or do you catch all sizes? Thanks!"

On my first cast I had a strike but missed it, when I reeled in the bait the tail was gone. I bought them a couple of years ago but I seem to remember them being quite expensive. My personal experience was the fish liked them but they don't hold up very well. A guy could go thru alot of them if he used them all day. I had a 5 pack of them and when they were gone I was done, about an hour of fishing time-0 walleyes. I am sure there is a time and place for them, just don't expect to much from them."
1108555,Ralfeee,2009-05-27 16:39:00,33,"I like to use swimbaits. I use the Big Hammer bait most of the time, but I have and still do use the Berkly SwimBait used by the In-Fisherman staff, and they are soft and have a great swimming action. I have not had the problem of them being destroyed quickly, but they can be beaten up. I prefer a 4"" or 5"" bait. I cast the lure and swim it back to the boat. It is a blast to catch walleye on swimbaits. Don't worry about the bait being to big, even smaller walleye will hit and eat a 5"" bait."
1108718,Guest,2009-05-28 08:14:00,0,"Ralfeee, Do you retrieve the swim bait like a crankbait, or do you retrieve it off of the bottom more like dragging a jig? What types of retrieves should I try if I am just getting into using a swim bait? Also, what is it like when you get a strike . . . is it subtle or agressive? Any suggestions are greatly appreciated."
1108751,thatvoodoothatyoudo,2009-05-28 09:56:00,79,"I have had my best results using them when the fish are actively feeding.. We use them as a first option when fishing windward shorelines that have been getting waves for several days. When some heavy chop is pounding into bays with rocky shorelines, the aggresive fish really nail the big swimbaits. We use 1/2 to 3/4 oz lead heads/ big hooks and 5"" sassy shads or any other good paddle tail swimbaits- just cast out and keep a steady retrieve - the fish will find them. - best regards, JBP"
1116892,Ralfeee,2009-06-27 20:58:00,33,"Just got back from Nungesser Lake, and used swimbaits on the last couple of days. The fishing early in the week wanted a slow, and I mean slow presentation, but when the wind picked up they started hitting swim baits. I had the best luck on 4"" Big Hammer in Red Calico Hunter. They lasted quite a long time, and caught 10-15 walleye on 1 bait, and then changed because it kept coming down the hook, but the bait still worked just fine. I changed because of I didn't have the patience to push the bait back up the shank of the hook, Lazy i guess.Casting them out and swimming them back with a little pause did the trick. Caught several pike on the baits as well, but they didn't destroy them. The baits still worked with several cuts and gashes in them.It is so much fun to catch fish on swimbaits, and you can catch walleye or northerns on them."
1117739,Guest,2009-07-01 10:37:00,0,put a drop of fishin' glue or super glue on the shank when you place the swimbait. Bait lasts a long time and swims the same as compared to being loose or pulled back.
3614274,Guest,2015-03-05 02:17:00,0,"You'll find the rhythm that's works best for you. 5"" gander jerkbaits, zoom super flukes, and Yamamoto d shads... I like the zoom paddle tails and also melt my own swim baits... My theory is that big lures catch big fish.... Like I said, pounded the eyes on bigger plastics..."
3614874,packpro,2015-03-05 06:53:00,695,"I love the Berkley Paddletail for our Canadian Trips. I still do not think it is as effective as live bait........however it is very versatile in the following ways. 1) It catches all species that we will target for the week, walleye, pike, and smallmouth. 2) After awhile vertical jigging gets boring. 3) The bite is completely different. As opposed to nibbling or just sucking in the bait, the swimbait is viciously attacked. The ferocity almost rips the rod out of your hand. Very exhilarating 4) It seems to select for bigger fish. 5) By varying the retrieve you can yo-yo the path back to the boat and cover more of the water column. I picked up some Impulse to try on this trip. Not sure if manufacturer is as important as the action and the profile. It is definitely worth a 1/2 day experiment. I also learned how to throw a bait caster with this lure. Very nice weight for a bait caster novice."
