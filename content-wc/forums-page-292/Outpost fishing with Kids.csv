3607842,SinOrSwim,2015-03-03 15:07:00,1528,"I would have handed him some sinkers, told him to grab onto the rope and jump in. Anchor us so we don't lose our spot. kidding. Obviously I would have tied the rope to him. LOL That was a big fear of mine when I took my 9 year old on his first trip last year. I know it sounds well and good to listen to them and do what they want but at the same time you spend a lot of money to fish. There has to be a balance. What that balance is, nobody really knows. Not sure there is a right or wrong answer. Depends on the day, depends on weather, depends on what you have done that day. So many things. But, I'd be ticked too if I took them out and they wanted to go back in an hour later. There has to be some compromise on both sides. Because if they don't like it, I'm not forcing them to do it and I'm not spending the money to take them up there. All depends on the kid."
3608034,billy weaver,2015-03-03 15:29:00,470,He will remember if you force him. Years later he will decline to go and you will be disappointed. I have a grandson who is 13 years old and has went to Canada with me since he was 6. I know how fast they can lose interest. I make sure he has his boat box with his I-Pod and tablet with him when we go out. If you do it right years from now it will be you that is ready to go cabin instead of him.
3608498,Draco1206,2015-03-03 17:16:00,175,"Whether the boy was out for 2 hours or 12 hours it really makes no difference. I don't see any ""up side"" to forcing him to stay out when he is no longer interested in fishing. But, there is a huge potential ""down side"", in that he may not want to go fishing anymore. You're trying to build something for the future. I took my son on his first remote fly-in trip when he was 11 years old. I structured our days so he wouldn't get bored, lots of breaks. When he wanted to sleep in in the morning, I would fish around the cabin until he was ready to go. We caught tons of fish but when he was done or bored we moved on and explored or changed species, lures, techniques, etc. I know he has fond memories of that trip and it may be the time that he got ""hooked on fishing"" for life. He is 28 years old now and he goes fishing more than I do now, and he is constantly teaching me new things. We still do a fly-in trip every year together."
3609418,Bayou,2015-03-03 21:17:00,52,"In the past it has always been a guys fly in fishing trip but this year I'm going to do another fly in with the family. It will be their first fishing trip let alone fly in to their your own lake. It will be a roller coaster and not cheap, I know this going in but I will take every chance to hook them for life so we can spend time together. Will it be aggravating when they want to go in after an hour after we have driven so far and spent so much money, you bet but I've yet to see a hearse with a trailer hitch. I've been non stop planning and thinking of ideas on what to do with them to keep them busy so they don't get bored. I hate to say it but I'm going to let them bring some electronics, mainly for the evening before bed. I hate to do it but it is what it is nowadays. We will go in after an hour if they want to but I plan on keeping them as busy as possible, exploring and letting them go where they want. I've been building them up all last year to prepare for this and I hope it pays off, as little or as much time as they want."
3610450,MrSimon,2015-03-04 08:14:00,922,"Every kid and situation is different so I can't really comment on the OPs decision. But with my kids, I always try to find a balance between accommodating their wishes, and not letting them wuss out on something that I know they will enjoy. Sometimes I get it right, and sometimes I get it wrong. That's parenting. I have learned though .... on a fishing trip, if the kids get some notion to do something that seems ridiculously stupid and useless, letting them do it almost always results in fun, laughter and awesome stories to tell mom when you get home. For example, I had my two older kids out on a local lake one evening fishing for blue gills. It was a beautiful evening with a gorgeous sunset. They wanted to stay out on the water until the sun set completely and go in after dark. I was wearing my prescription sunglasses and didn't have my regular glasses. I was blind as a bat on the ride in (electric motors only on this lake) and the kids howled with laughter as they told me where to steer, spinning us in circles and running all over the lake before literally running into the dock. That ride in the dark was more fun than catching a whole mess of gills."
3611618,Coyoteman,2015-03-04 12:03:00,209,I'm lucky. My 11 year old daughter will never quit if the fish are biting. If they aren't she reads books until we start catching. That kid would live in the boat and it's not pretty if I go without her.
3612514,btyreprich,2015-03-04 15:20:00,1067,"My experience has taught me that if you want to have your son or daughter come up on future trips, let them have a say in when it's time to call it a day. This is especially true when the weather is bad or the waves are just too rough. Now I did tell me kids that on fishing trips, we fish from like 7;30 am to say 5:00 pm. Sure we get out of the boat for shore lunch and possible a swim on the shore but then it's back to fishing. I myself have no problem in staying back in the cabin after dinner and playing cards or another game with them. Remember - it's their vacation too. We always make a big fuss over the kids' first fishing trip and any size fish they catch. Cannot tell you how many times I'd hook a fish and quietly hand the rod over to my kids under the excuse my arms hurt."
3607378,bthomas3333,2015-03-03 13:10:00,465,"Some of the other threads got me to thinking about fishing with my son. Couple of years ago we were on our annual fly in trip and we got into an amazing bite. From about 7p to 8p we boated better than 80 walleyes. We literally couldn't get the jig down (10ft) before they would hit the jig. We would drop the jig. Reel in the slack and set the hook. OVER and OVER and OVER. After about an hour my 12 y/o son says ""I am getting tired of this"". It is 8p and we are 30 mins each way back to the lodge. Oh and I also had promised my wife I wouldn't make him sit in the boat if he didn't want to be there. WHAT WOULD YOU DO? For better or worse. I said ""buddy I know you are tired of this but I need you to give me about about an hour. Either the bite will stop or it will start to get dark around 1000p and we will go in"". Obviously a no win situation but how many guys would pack it in for the night in the middle of an epic bite. B-"
3607538,Draco1206,2015-03-03 13:51:00,175,"I have to agree with your son. I would have been bored also after catching 80 fish in an hour. Time to move on and do something else with your son or take him back to the cabin so you could go on fishing. As far as it being ""a no win situation"", you're wrong. You were on a fly in fishing trip with your family and were enjoying a great time fishing with your son. The only thing that could ruin that would be to make your son continue to fish or sit and watch you fish when he obviously had enough. The last thing you want is to turn him off to fishing. Maybe you could have started casting crank baits or trolling. Maybe you wouldn't have caught as many fish but you would have kept his interest. Moving, trying and teaching him new methods or doing something he wanted to do would have all been better choices than making him stay and do what he didn't want to do. Besides you promised your wife you wouldn't do that so I've got to believe you knew this might happen."
3607586,tv4fish,2015-03-03 14:07:00,2694,"In that situation (with my Son) - Yup, I would have honored his request and ""bunched it""."
3607626,camp chef,2015-03-03 14:22:00,915,By 7 oclock. I am fished out for the day.Much more fun to have my feet up at the cabin having an adult beverage with my friends while we cook dinner on the grill. The fishing has never been good enough to overshadow cocktail hour.
3607706,Carnhzkr,2015-03-03 14:44:00,964,"I think Draco really hit this one on the head. When you're fishing with your kids, you have to be prepared to sacrifice to make sure they have a great time and want to come back. I remember how long some of those days got when I was very young. By the end of the day, I'd had enough and wanted to get back to camp and throw rocks and run around. Those early marathon days in the boat turned my brother off to the point that once he hit 15, he had no interest in fishing at all and stayed home while we mad our annual trip north. He's never had a fishing rod in his hands since. When I began taking my own family of four (2 boys), I made a very conscious effort to let them dictate when we were ready to call it a day. It's an investment in the future. Maybe one thing you could have done to milk the incredible bite for a few more minutes is make a game out of who can catch five the quickest. Loser has to dry the dishes or something like that."
3607714,Carnhzkr,2015-03-03 14:46:00,964,Here! Here! I'll drink to that.
3607730,bthomas3333,2015-03-03 14:48:00,465,I probably should've said we had gone out to fish at 6p. He was NOT tortured in the boat for 12 hours or something.B-
3607738,Freytown,2015-03-03 14:50:00,770,How old was your son at the time??
3607770,Freytown,2015-03-03 14:55:00,770,"""After about an hour my 12 y/o son says"" opps I missed that. Not a baby at 12yo. Hard to say w/o knowing your boy...but I do see your point."
3607778,Carnhzkr,2015-03-03 14:55:00,964,Gotcha! That makes sense. I'll bet most people reading your OP assumed you'd been out all day.
