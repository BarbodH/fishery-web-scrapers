3620082,Mike Borger,2015-03-06 09:58:00,1554,How many in one day?
3620146,Fishoil,2015-03-06 10:16:00,1277,I've taken ~50 Ontario trips and had more 100+ fish days than I'll ever remember. There have only been a few times when I actually counted but many others when 100 was easily surpassed. Most of the time when I'm catching that many fish I get bored with it after an hour or two and look elsewhere for excitement (unless I have a rookie along).
3607594,new hips,2015-03-03 14:17:00,498,"Numerous 100 fish days not that uncommon..........my best was 27 walleye on consecutive casts with a jig and twister tail, on a fly in lake.This was sitting in front of a small incoming creek...emptying into a small bay. Lasted all week if you wanted to fish like that. The longest drought was maybe 15-20 minutes. When your favorite crank bait has no paint left on it, I got a good feeling you've caught a lot of fish for the week. Really bad days 15-20 fish can happen, especially after a bad cold front."
3609082,northernbite,2015-03-03 19:45:00,1186,You wouldn't believe me if I told you! I know this much when my cousin says he has had enough we've caught a whole lot of walleye. Paul
3609410,P&y only,2015-03-03 21:13:00,133,"I fish late May. I EXPECT to catch 100 a day and they are not under 15"". It took me several years to find where and WHEN this can happen. The timing is everything."
3610074,maddogg,2015-03-04 06:51:00,178,You can tell me I enjoy a good fishing story.
3610162,tv4fish,2015-03-04 07:09:00,2694,"You KNOW with a handle like ""Whopper"" it's going to be a good one..........."
3610490,41jims,2015-03-04 08:26:00,30,"Those all sound great, We caught 115 in 6hrs at Eagle lake one day. There was 3 of us in the boat and it was just unreal."
3612706,jWN,2015-03-04 15:51:00,62,"Well I wish I had a ststs book as Sprix does but I do not.(some thing to think about) I will say this I have had many days over a hundred and size was not squeaekers. All my fantastic trips have either been in Manitoba or Sascachawan, but am sue at the right time Onterio can produce simaliar. Most of my adventures are on this fourm somewhere and I am not an exagerator nor lier. I have been going to Canada since 1984 and my dad since 1968 so there is a long history of fishing Canada(mainly Manitoba). I will also say this that is easy to forget about the bad years which I have had and easy to rememer the good years(this is where a log book would help). I will also say we try to target as close to ice out as we can, but with that we sometiimes end up in a bad trip due to weather and 1 time frozen lakes. My suggestion is venture farther then the norm and adventure so what if you drive another 10hrs for 4 to 10 times the fish."
3615010,SeulAreaWalleye,2015-03-05 07:13:00,100,"Net, Bait,Tie......Net, Measure, Photo, Release.....Net, Measure, Kill, Keep.....Net, Tie, Bait...repeatMany legit over 100 days on Lac Seul for my trips and many others that fish it, like already posted. It seems more so on calmer weather days and always with live bait. I literally run when the frenzy goes off just to get my guest's back in the water quickly just and crank those numbers high! Walleye fishing to me is actually great exercise most days! Want to build a great fishery like Lac Seul? Impose a slot of 18""- 21"" released, and just watch that population climb every year."
3615082,tv4fish,2015-03-05 07:21:00,2694,"AMEN brother --- You are so right - My group has seen the benefits of that through the years that we have fished Lac Seul. The numbers have increased since you guys instituted that, as has the size. I've said it before - if ONLY some people ""in control"" in Minnesota would listen/learn from you guys."
3616490,rockape,2015-03-05 11:53:00,215,"I know everyone in my crew has had 100+ fish days. We only counted one time. My partner and I said we would count for an hour. We caught 56. And they weren't right under the boat either. NW Ontario like most others. It was rocky, so I bet both of us had to tie on a new jig or two during the hour. But like others have said, it does take time to bait, cast, set hook, retrieve, release, and repeat. Fishing isn't a race to us. We like to enjoy the entire experience, so we don't tend to speed fish. I use tactics for larger fish, and am always casting for gators around large schools of small walleyes!"
3603362,Guest,2015-03-02 11:05:00,0,I really don't know. Fish for both pike and walleye at the same time and never count. Doubt I've caught more than 50 in a day.
3603418,tv4fish,2015-03-02 11:20:00,2694,"That IS being pretty efficient. My story (on Lac Seul). I have 2 buddies that fish with me. We have been going to Lac Seul since 1985 AND we have found some good spots over those years. Between the 3 of us, yes, we have had more than a few ""over 100"" walleye days. We document what we catch by having counters (the push button lap counters) attached to the side of my boat. One counter is for ""under slot"", one is ""in slot"" and one is ""over slot"". Each fish is quickly counted by just hitting one of the clickers. I should also say that we don't put in that long of a day actually ""fishing"" as we do have to boat a ways to our spots. We probably are actually fishing from 9:00 a.m to 3:00 p.m with a break for lunch. Also - we do not just ""fish for numbers"" but go after quality fish. When the weather has been good out on the water and you can have one of those days - it is absolutely great!"
3603770,maddogg,2015-03-02 12:33:00,178,When we go with our wives my buddy and I go fishing before breakfast. When breakfast is ready the girls bang in a pot and we go in to eat.One morning I caught 46 walleyes with 46 casts. My friend was doing almost as well but I had the consecutive cast record. We didn't keep track of how many we caught before we went in to eat but it had to be well over 100.
3604226,Rock Hound,2015-03-02 14:07:00,51,"I have made 15 trips to NW Ontario in the last 19 years. I believe out of almost 90 days on the water in the last two decades (always in June), I have had over 100 fish a day in at least 15 of those days. I have had three days in which I must have been in the 200 fish a day range. Don't get me wrong, there have been a few days where I could say the number of fish were counted on just one hand, but the numbers in Ontario can be incredible. I will point out that when we go we are on the water about 12 hours a days, so we are fishing hard."
3604994,Travis Schallock,2015-03-02 17:45:00,37,"[QUOTE=SinOrSwim;3602306]I have a very tough time believing someone has time to bait, drop line, catch, reel in, take fish off hook, release, bait in ONE minute. Plus, if you are counting you either have an unbelievable memory or add the time it takes to click a counter in that time.QUOTE]I should have said that is between 2 guys, not each person. Not that hard fishing vertical in 15 FOW or so, and your hook rarely stays near bottom for any longer than 5 seconds without getting bit, if it even gets to bottom."
3605290,NP4ME,2015-03-02 19:21:00,378,This is exactly what I thought! And to do that non-stop for how long?
3605562,sptrix,2015-03-02 20:33:00,175,"I have records of every fish we've caught on our trips to Canada going back to about 1994. We count, one by one, every day. We keep track of certain stats, such as Master Anglers (of course), walleyes over 26"", pike over 38"", trout over 32"", etc. It's a pain sometimes, but it's fun to look back at the journal, and it also keeps us honest."
3605578,GBS,2015-03-02 20:43:00,2271,"On my Ontario fly-in a few years ago, we held the boat right at the mouth where the main stream entered the lake. By this time in our trip, all the minnows had died. I took a handfull of dead minnows and put them on the board seat next to me. Use a 1/4 jig, no barb. Had about 5 feet of line out. The routine was:Lower jig.StrikeLift walleye out of water.Grab jig by the head, and twist fish off, allowing to fall back into water.Hit the clicker.Grab new minnow (if required) and put on jig.Drop jig back into water.Three boats, 2 guys per boat. We stayed 2 1/2 hours, making sure that each individual guy had made their 100 fish. I was somewhere north of 130 - forgot to click several times. Fish ranged from 15 to 18"". No reeling or netting, except for the one big one that was 30"" caught by one of the other guys."
3606730,Whopper,2015-03-03 09:43:00,340,"I've had my fair share of 100 fish days, all on flyins. Walleye opener 2008 was a magical day, you wouldn't believe if I told you"
3607122,MrSimon,2015-03-03 11:38:00,922,"So many times I've said, ""I'm gonna keep count today"" ..... just to give up around 30."
3602138,Travis Schallock,2015-03-02 05:18:00,37,"2 guys in a boat, using live bait, we'll catch 70-80 per hour. We've tried to beat our 'record', 83, but allways end up in the 70's. Most fish in the 15""-18"" range from 10""-24"" on average. I think it is pretty tough to get more just with the time it takes to unhook, re-bait, and get back down near bottom. How many in a day? I'm not sure because to be honest it gets boring pretty quick. Now that's not typical all year, but for a week or to, post-spawn in a river mouth as fish are headed back to the lake. Most of the year, 2 people, 15-20 an hour, or so, is average, good bites are still an easy 50/hr."
3602306,SinOrSwim,2015-03-02 06:55:00,1528,"I have a very tough time believing someone has time to bait, drop line, catch, reel in, take fish off hook, release, bait in ONE minute. Plus, if you are counting you either have an unbelievable memory or add the time it takes to click a counter in that time. Granted, we go in the fall so have never experienced fishing like that. The closest I ever came was when we had a tangle on a fly in. As we were untangling our lines, we drifted toward a very small island. We basically ended up on shore. We got the lines untangled and one went over the side. Literally in 3 feet of water. BOOM! Fish on. We just in 3 feet of water with one side of the boat against the rocks and fished off the water side. Just dip in, catch fish, pull it out. But, still not even close to 1 per minute. This lasted about 15 to 20 minutes and was amazing. I would suggest to the OP to possibly ease up on the expectations. Also, determine whether you want to catch huge numbers of fish with almost all of them being small or very good numbers with some big fish mixed in. Either way, you will have a blast. If you like to fish I'm not sure there is anything better than these remote Canada lodges."
3602562,adempsey,2015-03-02 07:57:00,963,"As they say on Mythbusters, CONFIRMED. It's all about time and place. For example, as Travis mentioned, post-spawn river mouths moving into the lake is prime time for large numbers. Not necessarily small fish either. Last trip ours were fish from 16"" to 25"", not to mention some nice pike too.If your goal is to have one of those 100 fish days, just plan your trip around that goal and there's a good chance it will happen."
3602650,Mike Kansas,2015-03-02 08:12:00,1463,"100 fish days are not an uncommon experience on Lac Seul I have been fishing there for 33 years and our group has had many days that one person will catch over 100 walleye a day. These are days that we are on the water 9 to 10 hours and have been on trips in June, July. August and September. The highest fish counts I have ever experienced came one year in Manitoba on the Pidgeon River. The resort we stayed at was a fly in and the water was about 10' low which caused the walleye to move out of the adjoining lakes into the river. They were stacked in holes in the river and you could literally catch a fish every cast. We would anchor on the edge of the holes and pitch jigs with salted minnows into the holes. On our first day my boat partner caught a walleye every cast for his first 39 casts. He finally did not hook one and he looked at me and said. ""Lets move Mike this hole is dryed up"". A bonus that week was the Pike that were sitting outside the holes in anticapation of a walleye lunch. Three were many times that a Pike would attack the walleye we had hooked and a real tussel was on. The Pike would usally release the eyes at the boat but it was a blast and a real bonus to not only see it but have it happen. During that 6 day trip we figured that eight of us caught over 10,000 walleye plus a fair amount of sauger. The eyes were in the 19"" to 22"" range. I know that it sounds hard to believe but it happened and believe me it was hard to believe for us too. Mike Kansas"
3602730,Herkyhawk00,2015-03-02 08:30:00,36,"Matt, Absolutely! I am wanting to take my kids to Ontario this summer and fish. I know nothing is a given when it comes to fishing, but would love for them to have that success. I wouldn't even care if I couldn't fish because I was taking their fish off the whole time. Would be great to experience seeing them reel in fish at that rate."
3602778,Herkyhawk00,2015-03-02 08:33:00,36,"Adempsey, would that be early June?"
3603034,Stu,2015-03-02 09:31:00,472,"My personal best is probably around 50 in one day at Holinshead. However, I was with my son and wife and only fished a few hours. I am sure I could double that if I left first thing in the morning and fished all day."
3603066,Carnhzkr,2015-03-02 09:38:00,964,"I've fished Ontario for a lot of years but I've only experienced the 100 fish per person per day thing twice that I can remember. The first time was maybe 20 years ago on the English River north of Kenora with three in the boat. The smaller walleye were hungry that particular trip so we decided to count one day and quit counting after we got to 330. We caught fish every place we went that trip. Last year, I flew in to Onaman Lake with my son. For the most part, I would have considered the fishing average, as far as numbers, but four days into the trip I found one particular bay where they were stacked up and it was game on. I have no doubt that if our goal would have been to see how many we could catch in a day, we could have landed 300 between the two of us. Most were 16"" or so, but there were a few nice ones and some nice pike thrown in. As someone said earlier, it does get boring pretty fast. We'd fish that spot for a couple of hours, try some different tactics, then ultimately move on for a different challenge. Those days do occur, but I wouldn't count on it or set your expectations so high. A realistic average is more in the line of 20 - 30 pp/pd, especially a relative beginner fishing unfamiliar water."
3603098,Carnhzkr,2015-03-02 09:42:00,964,"It's the classic bell curve. There are rare days when you can catch 100 pp/pd, but on the opposite side of that curve are days when you might catch 0 - 5 pp/pd. At the peak of the curve you might have 20 - 25."
3603146,jambi,2015-03-02 09:52:00,504,"Dad and I did our annual hike to a portage lake, always loads of crappies. We decided to count one time. Fished from 8:30am to 4:00pm. Count was 285. I'd say 85% crappie (12-15""), 13% smallmouth and 2% pike. Cherrington Lake last year cold front came in we were going to try to fish weeds for pike. Each hit walleyes on spinnerbaits on our first casts. New spot, never tried there before. Dropped the anchor didnt want to fight the wind, Switched to jigs. Got the counter out. Fished three hours and hit 100 total mark. Went and ate lunch and came back. They were gone. Our buddies were 50 yards away and they did the same. Awesome day."
3600874,Herkyhawk00,2015-03-01 17:07:00,36,"Honest question and honest answers, please. Though I have a huge love an interest for fishing, admittedly, I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to finding them. I've read stories on here of people catching 100-200 fish in a day which for me, would be the most incredible experience I have ever had, especially when you are mixing in big ones. It just seems surreal to me that those days exist. I'm just curious how many people have experienced days like this and what lakes you may have experienced it on? Did you have a guide? Were you familiar with the lake? I hope to one day experience a day such as that and God willing, experience it with my children or my dad. I would be interested in hearing your stories. Thanks."
3600962,roscoe33,2015-03-01 17:31:00,653,"I too have wondered about the 100 fish days.I often question the person only to find it was 100 fish, 6 guys, 12 hour day, 90% of fish under 15"".I personally have caught 32 walleyes in 4 hours on the Fox River (Green Bay), spring spawn, yes all were released.Nephew put 26 northerns in the boat in 4 hours while I operated the motor-net- and managed to bring in 12 of my own.Dad and I caught our 8 walleye limit in 10 minutes, all while brother-in-law was trying to rig his line. This location has become known as humiliation point. We took our fish in, then I took BiL and mom out, and they too were able to get their limit in about 30 minutes while I guided-netted, and baited hooks.Most days we are exploring new waters and not working very hard, and average 1-2 fish per hour, per person."
3600970,Blades-n-Beads,2015-03-01 17:33:00,484,"Herky, your going to hear this to be a common occurance for many on this site on Ontario waters. For me personally I have had days on LacSeul with two others in my boat 300+ walleyes boated. Typically any time in the Month of June has been the best bite for us. We have had days we could not catch any eater size fish, ( 17"" fish or smaller) , 300 walleye in a solid day and everything was 20+"". Crazy as it sounds it has happened more than once. , an absolute treat and honor to be able to fish there, I have and always will treat Ontario and its people with the utmost respect! Blades"
3601058,Herkyhawk00,2015-03-01 17:51:00,36,"Roscoe and Blades, pretty awesome, man. I have taken my boys out where Bluegill were biting that well in a farm pond, lol. I realize I have to experience Ontario, and more than once, in order to believe it, but it just would be a great experience. Though I have such a love for the sport, I guess I would be better described as a catcherman than a fisherman, as I lack a lot of the knowledge and experience needed On those bigger lakes. Lac Seul is a lake that is talked greatly on here, but also is mentioned that a guide is strongly recommended? That's some pretty awesome stuff."
3601114,spurs101,2015-03-01 18:01:00,635,"I have experienced this many times in early June. This is not an exaggeration. 27 years on the same lake in Quebec. Yes we knew the lake. It was a walleye factory. We had a self imposed slot limit of keepers between 19 and 21 inches for take home fish. In the fall ..early September, we targeted the trophy catch and release and never had a 100 fish day. I think you will find many experienced Canada fisherman who had these days."
3601338,Herkyhawk00,2015-03-01 18:38:00,36,"Yeah, I believed it is not an exaggeration. It's just hard to imagine when never having experienced it before."
3601586,ftfarms,2015-03-01 19:32:00,444,My best was on cedar lake I caught 102 walleyes and 39 smallmouth bass. My best just walleye day was on lac Saul was 128 That's mine not sure how many my wife caught them days. Cedar lake was 2013 and lac suel was 1993. Last year I only caught 139 walleyes for the week. never know I guess
3601770,dukntz,2015-03-01 20:11:00,11,"One spring I caught 24 walleyes on 24 consecutive casts while drifting into the back of a shallow bay. We were in less than 5'of water. Couple years later, 3 of us in one boat one evening boated over 200 in about an hour in a half, all on jigs and white twister tails. Mayflies were hatching and the fish were really stacked on that point........Those are the memories that make you ready to go back before the truck is even unpacked!"
3601842,sptrix,2015-03-01 20:21:00,175,"Best in Ontario was 274 in a day. We started off with 100 in the first 100 minutes. It was September and they were in about 20' of water, otherwise, who knows how many we could have caught. In Manitoba, our best was 235 in 5 hours. All stats are reflective of 2 guys fishing out of one boat."
3601922,flntknp17,2015-03-01 20:49:00,151,"I was curious two falls ago fall so I brought a clicker to keep track. Two guys, one boat, on Lac Seul. Started about noon on Saturday and I quit clicking at 400 on Monday afternoon so essentially 4 person-days of fishing. My son and I got 45 in just under 90 minutes within sight of the dock at Gold Pines last July.....that's the best way to get a kid interested in fishing! Matt"
