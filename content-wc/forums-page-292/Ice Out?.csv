3601354,bigwillies,2015-03-01 18:40:00,515,"kinda surprised it was only 35"". the whole month of febuary was COLD.thought it would have made more ice than that.defenitly too cold to go look for myself."
3539442,BenBeattie,2015-02-13 09:32:00,232,"Let me try to clarify what I meant . someone mentioned that since there was less snow this year that there would be more ice. Last year we had 12 feet of snow and 3-feet of ice. This year we do have less snow but there will still be 3-feet of ice, give or take a bit. Amount of snow doesn't have that big of an effect on ice thickness. Both factors, amount of snow and ice have minimal effect on ice out date. Like I said it's all about the temperatures in March and especially April. Ice out last year was so late because it stayed cold for so long . not because of how much snow/ice we had. Obviously your cooler experiment will hold true you're talking about 5x more ice in one cooler. From one year to another we will never have 5x more ice to melt on the lakes. I'm saying the amount of ice here from year to year varies minimally, no matter how much snow we have, and therefore has little effect on ice out date. If we have 36"" of ice or 40"" of ice the ice out date won't change much based on that. Ice out date is all about the temperatures in March and April (which no one can predict), it's just common sense."
3549722,jWN,2015-02-16 13:27:00,62,Agreed on snow will not make much diffrence on thickness of ice in canada but snow make a big diffrence on water flow throu the systems when it starts to warm up. Take an ice cube out of the freezer and let it sit then take on and run water over it. Which one melts faster. I know this is extrem diffrences but water flow melts ice.
3558786,prov1800,2015-02-18 21:52:00,5010,That might be true on rivers and creeks.on lakes you dont get a lot of flowing watet.its like ben said its temperature that melts.thecrocks on the on the shorelines heat up and start thecwhole process.we can still ice fish as long ascwe can get on the ice.personally i dont get to wound up about ice out.it happens when it happens.
3559202,octanehi5,2015-02-19 06:24:00,1104,"Lakes are formed by collecting water that has been damed up ,naturally or man made, The water that flows into these lake is a higher temp , all lakes have a flow, springs what ever The water coming from a spring is 50 degrees, The temps and snow fall amount effect how much water flow there is into and out of a lake. You take our target fish Walleye They can start to spawn in a river that has 50 Plus degree water flowing into the lake and the lake can still be frozen. Last yr with the late ice outs many guys as well as outfitters had to cancel some of there opening season trips and plans. As cold as it has been we need to start to moderate in the next few months, seeing we are in the same pattern"
3559210,123chadder,2015-02-19 06:26:00,429,i agree march and april are the determining months
3560882,BornToFish,2015-02-19 12:13:00,1224,"I would like to build on the previous post. I happened to be in NW Ontario during the last several seasons during late April and May. During 2013 and 2014, it appeared to many of us that the ice would likely go out at any time. We thought this for several consecutive weeks. The ice just lingered until mid-May. Ice went out five days after the opener last season. We needed some warm rain, followed by sun and wind to finish off the ice. This much needed weather to finish off the ice just never materialized. I completely agree that the weather in late March and April is important to get the ice ready to go out on lakes. The weather in early May can be just as important to complete the ice-out. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3582602,123chadder,2015-02-25 10:55:00,429,"i dont think it will be much earlier this year,in my area anyways"
3598586,octanehi5,2015-03-01 05:28:00,1104,In the 14 day outlook in northern Quebec The Temps are starting to moderate It would be nice if ice out is about 10 days earlier than last yr
3600690,Skywagon,2015-03-01 15:56:00,1106,"I measured the ice depth today in front of our house (we are on a walleye lake). I have kept the snow somewhat cleared off in that area most of the season, the ice measured 35 inches. The lakes are not done making ice yet and the quality has been good. At this point it looks like there is a lot of good ice fishing ahead, too early to figure ice out."
3600794,Freytown,2015-03-01 16:30:00,770,"This winter hasn't been the same over the USA like last year. But in the NE section, including Canada it's been colder than last year. The broad snow pack will reflect spring radiation until the snow cover is gone. As Mar 1st is still too early to predict ice out...ice WILL go out."
3525602,Pikeslayer8,2015-02-09 16:45:00,1460,Ice out will happen when it happens......... But that right there is dang funny
3525770,prov1800,2015-02-09 17:37:00,5010,Iam with ben on this.i will say it will earlier than last year.pretty sure anyways.lol.
3526690,octanehi5,2015-02-10 05:59:00,1104,"The late ice out greatly affected the bite on the lake that I fish, our #'s were cut in half, that was the last week in June. Ice out was May 15th, The eye's did not spawn until the first weeks in June By the end of the month they started to put on the feed bag. Hopefully Ice out will be at least 2 weeks sooner"
3526714,Obabikon,2015-02-10 06:04:00,2370,"I'll go ahead and guess. Our ice is thinner than usual, and less snow fall. Plus warmer temps. April 23rd the ice will be off in the Morson area."
3526938,Algoma Guy,2015-02-10 07:01:00,48,"""Definately not the winter that we had last year. The problem last year was below normal temps and then winter really lingered around and we never really got that fast spring thaw. It appears that Febuary is going to remain cold with below normal temps. It will depend what happens in March and April. If I had to bet I would say ice will be completely out a week to 10 days earlier than last year in my area. ( just south of Hearst) Which is still a little later that normal."
3527770,123chadder,2015-02-10 10:29:00,429,it all depends how long winter lasts.....
3528602,Whopper,2015-02-10 13:41:00,340,"Ah the voice of reason When this thread started that's exactly what I was thinking, way to early. I hope your having a good winter Ben"

3537362,Manitou,2015-02-12 17:59:00,125,"You can always keep an eye on this site:https://icepatrol.wordpress.com/2014/It was the end of May last year, unprecedented I think.I have been out to my camp as early as mid April in the past."
3538458,octanehi5,2015-02-13 05:54:00,1104,"I had a few conversations with a few outfitters at the Harrisbug outdoors show, They are thinking that this winter has been not as cold as last and ice out should be a week to 10 days earlier than last yr. one can only hope. I disagree with the amount of snow and ice has nothing to do with ice out, Very large lakes like the great lakes were 98% frozen last yr. the water temps never recovered to normal levels. The larger the body of water takes longer to change temps. Its why some of your local ponds freeze up a month before the larger ones or some that never freeze. The weather witch we have no control over will do its job.once temperatures moderate. But you can not tell me a foot of snow will melt as quick as 4 feet of snow, The same thing applies to ice thickness. If you do not believe that do a little experiment Fill a cooler with 2"" of water ,freeze it solid, Fill another cooler with10"" of water Freeze it solid now put them both in a controled temp environment about 70 F time how long it takes to turn back to 100% liquid, Its just physics"
3523418,octanehi5,2015-02-09 07:28:00,1104,I was hoping the great north got alot of snow so the ice did not get as thick as last yr? hopefully ice out will be two weeks sooner. lets hear your thoughts?
3523434,Obabikon,2015-02-09 07:35:00,2370,"Not a lot of snow, but not extremely cold either. Should be a relatively early ice out."
3523666,v-bay gord,2015-02-09 08:19:00,3168,May 5th.
3524146,LoDo,2015-02-09 09:59:00,721,Late Ice out really screwed over the fisherman that booked the opener last year. Especially those that booked the far north. I'm included. We definitely caught fish but nothing close to previous years. All the fish were in the same hole. I like fishing when there are several spots throughout the lake. Last year we had two. Not to mention the lake temps were all over the place and the water was so high throughout the lake. It was difficult to get to and from the inlets/outlets due to the high water/flooding. I live in CO and can't imagine having late ice out. Played golf Fri and Sat. Sunny n 60s here all week.
3524202,Shellback,2015-02-09 10:20:00,8083,Am or PM? LOL!
3524490,v-bay gord,2015-02-09 11:59:00,3168,I didn't predict which year.....
3525010,BenBeattie,2015-02-09 14:05:00,232,"Waaaay to early to predict. A lot can happen and change in the coming months. It's all about the temperatures in March and especially April. Also, we had 12.5 feet of snow last winter and as always there was 3-feet of ice. The amount of snow, and depth of ice have little, if any, effect on ice-out date."
3525050,Golden Eagle,2015-02-09 14:29:00,2642,I'll check with Junior Gore. Pretty sure he'll say there's no ice now. Anywhere.
3525418,Freytown,2015-02-09 15:57:00,770,I predict that ice will be gone when the temps stay above 32 degrees long enough to melt it....just like ever year.
3525514,Blue Lk,2015-02-09 16:23:00,269,Canadian ice need's temps over 0 degrees C to melt
