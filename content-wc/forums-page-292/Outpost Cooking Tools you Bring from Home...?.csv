3613226,CI_Guy,2015-03-04 17:58:00,2118,I use paint strainers to filter cooking oil. Any place that sells paint will have them in 1 gallon and 5 gallon sizes. The 1 gal ones that I use come in a pack of 5 for around $2. The oil strains through them faster than coffee filters.
3613346,Carnhzkr,2015-03-04 18:25:00,964,Thanks. I'll check into that. Sounds like a good idea.
3613842,port1042,2015-03-04 20:08:00,509,I take 2 special items along -- but we do have electricity. One is an electric frying pan. I can easily control temperature and I always use it to fry fish. Easy to clean and my favorite tool for frying. New this year -- a 4 slice toaster. They were on sale at Fleet Farm the other day ($20.00) and as soon as I saw it I knew it would be a real time saver. We should be on the lake 15 minutes sooner with the 4 slice option!
3614082,dutchboy,2015-03-04 21:14:00,5717,I had to giggle when I saw the toaster. This year I took a fly in and did toast with one or those wire things that sit over the open burner on the stove. I thought it was cool but I wasn't doing a lot of toast either. Funny how we get use to our modern tools.
3614658,bigwalleye1,2015-03-05 06:07:00,2632,"Dutch, I'd provide a link to the ""toast"" thread, but I think you know where it is.... I'd point out that we are NOT barbarians..... Toast may be one of the things that separates us from the savages..."
3614738,SinOrSwim,2015-03-05 06:19:00,1528,"Our cabin doesn't have a microwave so the last 2 years we have taken a microwave with us. We (read MorganMan) makes a bunch of breakfast sandwiches and breakfast burritos and wraps in wax paper. Freeze them and then when we get up there we put them all in the frig. In the morning eveyrone can grab a breakfast sandwich like a bagel, cheese, sausage and egg or a breakfast burrito, pop one in the microwave and breakfast to go. Nice calm morning with a chill in the air. On the water with a hot cup of coffee and a breakfast burrito. Mmmmmmmmm"

3605946,Guest,2015-03-03 06:40:00,0,As a camp owner I see some things that I should add to the cabin cooking supplies.Better check out those frying pans and knives.It seems that everyone is getting more adventurous in their cooking every year.Some times I am amazed at what people bring.
3607266,smallcal,2015-03-03 12:36:00,119,"We went away from the fried walleye as well (of course now we need to try the wings!) but we bake as simple as it gets.Butter a baking pan or cover a nasty one with aluminum foil and coat the top of the foil with butterPut walleye fillets on the pan, put pads of butter on top of filletsSeason with your choice (we use Old Bay, Mrs. Dash lemon-pepper, etc. or mix some together). We usually squeeze some lemon over the fillets as well.Bake at 400 F for 20 minutes.Very simple, very tasty and no complaints as you get the full taste of the Walleye, light on the spices, easy cleanup.One overlooked item is, to us, the most important: At least two bottle openers per man, we always seem to lose at least one!"
3607386,Bill Krejca,2015-03-03 13:11:00,6107,"Wow, That looks good!2 pair of small hinged ""tongs"" - 1 to put the fish in the mix, another to take out of the mix and put in and take out of the fry pan. The ones with angled tips are ergonomically friendly.A large antique spoon that holds just enough pancake mix for one medium size pancake.Ice cube trays if staying in a cabin. Leave there and bring several new ones each year.A lot of stuff already mentioned.Bill"
3608210,Carnhzkr,2015-03-03 16:00:00,964,What's a spider strainer? I've been looking for a good way to strain my oil.
3609586,Hewhocookstomuch,2015-03-03 22:07:00,66,"Over the years we have lost food that gets warm in the refrigerator, because people keeping getting beverages out and putting warm ones to replace. Coolers were set aside for said beverage, however we could not make enough ice with ice trays and milk jugs filled with ice do not transfer the cold as good as plain ice. Last year I carried some two quart square food storage containers. We have two freezers for our fish so made ice in said container, then thawed just enough to remove ice and place in cooler. The repeat process each day. One problem some one busted up one container trying to get ice for the boat, only needed to run water over it, not attack with hammer."

3611378,Carnhzkr,2015-03-04 11:03:00,964,I see. I thought it may be a way to filter your oil.
3611434,big popi,2015-03-04 11:14:00,635,I do have a one of the large funnels that holds what is effectively a large coffee filter to filter the oil. I don't really use it now as we use the oil 2-3 times and then replace with fresh oil. I buy the large vegetable oil containers from Sams and this will last for the entire trip & then some.
3611770,bigwalleye1,2015-03-04 12:43:00,2632,"...and a real, honest to goodness, metal spoon, restaurant sized. The plastic ones in lots of camps are pretty wimpy."
3603666,Mike Borger,2015-03-02 12:12:00,1554,"Not really cooking, more eating, but I always bring paper plates and bowls. I hate doing dishes."
3603898,bushead11,2015-03-02 12:56:00,151,Guys - Thanks for the recommendations. I think I might just send a link or two to the lodge owner. He asked us for any suggestions.... Jay - Not to derail the topic but can you PM me some simple recipes for baked walleye that your group likes. We have gone away from doing deep fried breaded fish every night and did a bunch of pan fried last year that most of our group liked better. Baking would be even less hassle.
3603930,oldfart,2015-03-02 13:00:00,21,"Stainless steel coffee pot, deep fryer for fish, large cookie sheet for oven potatoes, and Northland plastic fish cleaning boards...they fold up and avoid the ""usually"" gross cleaning stations at Fly-ins"
3603954,Mike Kansas,2015-03-02 13:03:00,1463,I always take a good can opener. Seems like the outpost ones either are gone or don't work.
3604002,SinOrSwim,2015-03-02 13:10:00,1528,"Take a muffin pan with you. PUt a strip of aluminum foil across the hole. Spray with Pam. Put walleye in there and make a circle so the walleye is running around the edge of the muffin tin. Fill the middle with a mixture of wild rice, mushrooms and maybe some italian sausage. Bake. If you let them cool, you should be able to lift out the fish with the aluminum foil strip. Then mix some sriracha with some sour cream or some mayo to mellow it out. Drizzle on the plate or over the top. We haven't taken this to canada because we still go the unhealthy route but I have tried it at home. See if this picture shows how it looks."
3604114,bushead11,2015-03-02 13:45:00,151,Sin - That looks awesome! So the list looks like this: Muffin Pan 2-Cookie Sheets Metal Strainer Steak Knives Sharp Kitchen Knife Cutting Board My potato slicer... Any other suggestions. Keep it going...!
3604914,retire55,2015-03-02 17:17:00,1029,"For over 40 years, our group has always taken a covered plastic container with us on all our trips (fishing or hunting) that contained our kitchen stuff.

3605018,dutchboy,2015-03-02 17:52:00,5717,I'd buy SinOrSwim a ticket and bring him with to be the cook! Man that looks good.
3605378,Live to jig,2015-03-02 19:38:00,159,"To save a lot of room and because I love to cook, I seal up all my spices and everything I need to flavor my food. Everything pretty much fits in a gallon bag rather than bunch of containers of spices. Even liquids like Balsamic Glaze, vanilla, olive oil and sesame seed oil for my famous Orange Walleye over rice"
3605594,btyreprich,2015-03-02 20:56:00,1067,"Here is what I bring on every trip: Empty coffee can to hold grease from bacon and other fryer items Supply of Target or Menards plastic shopping bags. These bags are much thicker than standard grocery bags and are therefore ideal to hold fish Breading at shore lunch Butcher string - we wrap almost all of our grilled meats with a slice or two of bacon and the string holds the bacon in place while on the grill. Toothpicks will work, but can allow the natural juices to escape the meat while cooking. Empty plastic containers & jars. Great way to hold left overs in the frig and not have them dry out. I like to use plastic jars with a screw on lid for shorelunch breading as it stays dry no matter the weather. Welder's gloves are the best for handling hot fry pans. Final suggestion to the chefs - I buy new spices each and every year. There IS a difference in the taste of the meal when using new spices. We use a salt grinder which adds a slightly different taste to items seasoned with salt. Try some this season."
3602426,bushead11,2015-03-02 07:30:00,151,For all the Chefs out there. I am wondering what items you know your outpost does not have that you bring from home to make your food prep quicker or make the meal just a bit better.If you could please post a link so that other Chefs can grab your recommendation for their group. Our outpost does not have outlets so most of our time after a day of fishing is spent on food prep. Our group loves potatoes but hates cutting them cause they always turn out too thin or thick and it takes forever. Last year we brought a slicer and really helped streamline the process and cut down the fry time...http://www.amazon.com/Super-Slicer-P...ndoline+slicerLet me know what your secret weapon is...Can't wait till spring!
3602554,MrSimon,2015-03-02 07:54:00,922,"My group are anything but chefs. We do everything in our power to minimize food prep. All our meals but fish are pre-cooked and frozen ahead of time. But, with that in mind, we get a lot of use out of a flexible plastic 5 gallon water bladder. We fill it up with lake water, treat it with tablets, and set it on the counter. Boom. Instant running water. Great for washing hands/dishes, rinsing fish fillets, brushing teeth, making coffee etc etc. Usually only refill it once during the week."
3602570,bigwalleye1,2015-03-02 08:00:00,2632,"I bring my own steak knives, tongs, basting brush, a couple extension cords, some nice pint glasses for the freezer, my one of a kind, custom bent, black and tan spoon, a couple of the long-reach butane lighters, and a can of the bathroom Orange spray from Walmart. That baby has saved more than one trip. This year, I'm gonna add a plug in light light for the bathroom. Nothing like going in there in the dark and turning on 6 75 watt incandescents. Leave there and stub your foot on everything...."
3602594,adempsey,2015-03-02 08:03:00,963,"If I brought a Mandoline on a fishing trip I would be thrown out of the plane! :PA good sharp chef (and fillet!) knife goes a long way though. Sometimes you only have one of those small cutting boards too, so I often bring a flexible cutting board with me."
3602626,SinOrSwim,2015-03-02 08:11:00,1528,"We take tongs to turn/fry fish. You just never know what you will get and we like a certain style. That and long turkey fryer thermometers. We like to keep our oil at specific temps and since we cook outside, wind etc factors in. Speeds up cooking since we don't wonder about temps all th e time. Consistent fish"

3603170,Pikeslayer8,2015-03-02 10:02:00,1460,"In my camp, we have an assortment of warped pots and pans and lids and more lids. I swear that there are 4 lids for every pot which becomes useful for a wakeup alarm for the ones who arn't up yet. The first things I remember bringing up and leaving were a Tupperware marinator and a couple of steak platters. They both made it a good 20 years or so of outpost camp use. Now I bring those disposable aluminum pans, very handy for fish prep and tons of other uses. Also bring a few aluminum bread pans...... Pop a frozen bread dough in them in the morning and when ya come in for the day, pop theme in the oven. Easy peezy! We also bring along an Ice Pick for choppin up block ice."
3603250,Lovetofish,2015-03-02 10:32:00,458,A couple items from my list is a slicer to cut uniform sized spuds and a good kitchen knife. We also bring plastic containers with lids for leftovers and to pack sandwiches for the cooler. Nothing worse than having a soggy sandwich for lunch. Then we pack sandwiches for the drive up and back as well.
3603602,JayM5209,2015-03-02 12:00:00,1050,"My group - and my solo trips - are to drive to camps and they are very well equipped, usually including three or four well seasoned cast iron skillets. I always bring:1. A fish turner/spatula ($10 or less)2. A large cast aluminum roaster/dutch oven for chowder night. An eBay acquisition some years ago and well worth hauling along. Thin aluminum or stainless pots just don't cut it. Of course, not recommended for fly-ins!3. Always have spuds with dinner, but haven't taken them in the bag for years - canned is the way to go, either sliced or diced. No peeling or slicing and they fry up very well. Again, too much weight for fly-ins. 4. Two large edged baking sheets. We rarely fry fish anymore and do a variety of baked styles instead. Less fuss and muss, no oil, just as tasty."
