3597154,dutchboy,2015-02-28 16:05:00,5717,Spring is around the corner and open water fishing is coming to mind. Can anybody comment on LaBelles camp on Rainy Lake? Also if the rate is advertised as $1300 cd what does that convert to US funds. Last....if I reserve a place on May 1 and the conversion rate is X and my stay and final bill payment is Sept and the rate has changed what do I pay? The date I reserved or the date I actually stayed? Thank you.

Can't speak for the resort, but as one who charges in Canadian $, the price in September will be $1300 Canadian....what you pay depends on the exchange rate at that time. If you want the rate at the time you book, then I would suggest you pay the balance at that time."
