2843673,octanehi5,2014-05-29 04:03:00,1104,"The limit per is 110 out of Clova, Big thing is not to duplcate,Plan everydays menu, At that weight we try to keep it to one case of beer per, anything over that we pay for its about $ 18 a case to fly in. Have them send your water in ahead of time. You can restock mid week fly in. Good luck we leave in 21 days for Hebert"
2888897,NY Walleye,2014-06-11 16:08:00,78,Need to repost link. A Dempsey put together the best site on packing.http://www.lineonfishing.com/index.p...30-how-to-pack
2889233,Jack77,2014-06-11 18:42:00,168,I was impressed with his article. I forwared to everyone going on our trip. I have it on my favorite list so I can go back and reference it once in ahwile. A very comprehensive article on packing.
2889329,adempsey,2014-06-11 19:12:00,963,"Thanks guys, glad you enjoyed it. I do try to update it every now and then. Trying to work in a few other small articles as well, but keep getting sidetracked =)"

3623970,NY Walleye,2015-03-07 12:29:00,78,Thought I would bump this back up. Check out the link adempsey posted. Very good fly in information.
1621721,michigan walleye guy,2013-03-31 18:45:00,95,"Great thread, and lots of interesting reading! How much live bait do some of you fly in? 80 or 90 dozen minnows can weigh up to 75+ pounds (with water).Personally, I always try to fly in the Labatts/Molson's, Coke/Mountain Dew, ahead of time, and pay the $52 case price for beer, and $27 for soda. That alleviates some of the problem.I've been on about 14 fly-in trips, and I don't think my group has ever been under the 100 pounds/person limit--we usually let Dave at Nestor Falls Outposts know we will probably be about 100-200+ pounds overweight, and pay the extra cost.But I do know that all that live bait contributes greatly to the overlimit. But I don't want to spend all that time and effort getting to my favorite place on earth, only to get cheap with the bait. Gulp does not outfish live bait--not even close, IMO."
1621897,octanehi5,2013-03-31 19:49:00,1104,"For every 2 guys I bring 500 night crawlers, the gulp and trigger X . The trigger X works better than gulp. nothing ever beats live bait,we also bring salted minnows. To plan the whole trip then not spend the money to fly in the things that you need is crazy.YOU HAVE WAITED ALL YR TO TAKE THIS TRIP AND you may not have enough beer.for the $1 a pound its well worth flying in all you need"
1622953,Mike Borger,2013-04-01 08:24:00,1554,"I totally agree with eliminating the problem by simply paying the overweight charge. However many outfitters don't own their own planes and are chartering the flights for their guests. In these cases there is no overweight charge you generally must adhere to the weight limit.Couple things I've done over the years when necessary. Assuming the camp is occupied before you come in and the fridge is cold. I'll freeze all perishables then just before the flight transfer them from the cooler to light cardboard boxes. No issues at all with food spoiling and dramatically lighter.For the last few years I've always brought a small water filter/pump made by MSR. It pumps about a liter a minute, takes all the nasty bacteria out of the water and even takes out the tannin stain. It's just like drinking springwater.http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/Member...ter-filter.jspThat combined with a bunch of drink crystals (I prefer ice tea) makes your non alcoholic drinking needs ultralight. Lots more ideas, I may add to this post later.Cheers"
1646081,NY Walleye,2013-04-07 16:55:00,78,Some really good info on here. Keep the ideas coming.
2358266,NY Walleye,2014-01-16 18:25:00,78,Any new ideas going into 2104. Couple of the links and ideas have been a big help. Please share.
2359954,MrSimon,2014-01-17 09:41:00,922,"This is an awesome little charging device. You put the metal fin in a fire, it heats up some water, and the heat exchange is transferred into electricity to charge cameras, batteries, phones etc etc. Solar chargers are nice, but this one can be used anytime there is a heat source (campfire, propane stove, gas grill)http://www.flamestower.com/"
2360290,adempsey,2014-01-17 12:05:00,963,"That's pretty neat. There are a lot of very cool USB chargers on the market now using heat [from boiled water/coffee cups and even your hands/feet], wind power [natural and pumped], solar energy and kinetic movement. I even saw one that's a soccer ball that stores energy as you kick it around! They are designed to charge USB devices though. I've been meaning to look into portable battery chargers some more as I am very curious about that subject. Especially for the 12V AGM batteries."
2361402,lassh,2014-01-17 18:21:00,553,Very nice Adempsey! Best packing article i've seen. I also bring a good water filter- Katadyn. It has similar filtering specs as Mike B's but there is still a little tannic tint to the water after pumping through the filter. Mike- does your water come out crystal clear even if it goes in tea colored?
2362042,Mike Borger,2014-01-18 06:34:00,1554,It does come out clear. It's not a big deal but when I'm using the pump a lot in tannin stained water you have to clean the filter with the little brush they provide at least once a day or it gets clogged.We always bring a ton of empty 1L nalgene bottles. The pump hose is fitted to the lids of these bottles and they screw right on so that when you're pumping the water there's zero chance of spillage.First thing we do when we get into camp is spend half an hour and fill a bunch of water bottles for the fridge.I always have the pump and a couple of empty nalgenes in the boat with me too.
2362218,MrSimon,2014-01-18 08:26:00,922,Have you ever considered using one of those large collapsible water bladders? They fold down pretty small for transport.
1577642,Larry Mac,2013-03-20 12:39:00,530,"Hi ademsey, We have been Blessed to have experienced many Canadian Wilderness Adventures over many years. We pride ourselves in managing our weight. With that said I must say this is by far the BEST article I have ever read on packing for a Fly in Fishing Adventure. Like it was stated earlier it is a ""Must Read"". Thank you very much for writing this. It is truly amazing. Have a great Year and Thank you again!!!!Thank you,Larry Mac"
1580033,pikeman14,2013-03-20 20:40:00,144,"I would go so far to vote Adempsy's article as a permanent ""sticky"". Many fisherman search all of walleye central for bits and pieces of this info."
1580257,KSlivin,2013-03-20 21:47:00,36,I second the motion to make Adempsy's article a permanent sticky. Great read and info!!
1580290,BennieS,2013-03-20 22:05:00,108,X3. I think they call this idea a no brainer.
1582474,labsrus,2013-03-21 11:17:00,557,Excellent link and a great article Already sent it to a few of our regulars on our fly in for planning purposes A large part of the fun is the trip planning and looking at past trip pictures and reviewing last years trip
1583970,RickOnt,2013-03-21 17:03:00,217,PikeSlayerThat's 5 Doz eggs for how many guys?Rick
1584194,Pikeslayer8,2013-03-21 18:18:00,1460,"My group is typically 8, thus the Pikeslayer8. There have been times where we have had 10, but the cabin we stay in gets tight with that many snoring bodies. Lol"
1594450,keek,2013-03-24 20:34:00,1003,Spent a week on Hebert this past July. I could have easily gotten by with 1/4 of the tackle I flew in. Bring 100' of cheap light-weight nylon rope for the anchor in the boat. Bring some fresh veggies. Have fun!
1594514,keek,2013-03-24 20:50:00,1003,People look for years to find and collect all that good information and that article lays it right out. Well done Adempsy!f
1600185,octanehi5,2013-03-26 07:58:00,1104,"If you are flying out of Clova the weight is 110 lbs per person.Giving that a case of beer weights 18 lbs.if you run out of beer on the lake it costs $60 a case on the lake, Its far less money to fly in all you need than to buy anything there on the lake.Its hard to make that weight ,but it can be done.To alot of fisherman its a trip of a lifetime,Plan good meals,proper gear, eat lots of fish. This July will be my ninth time on this lake.Your trip is what you make it. Its about your quality of live. Bacon eggs and homefries for breakfast, hambergers and hot dogs for lunch,beer battered fried walleye and pike whenever, pasta, and filet migon for dinner,add good friends,fishing,beer, wine and a good camp fire, cigars.Whats not to enjoy"
1571730,JayM5209,2013-03-19 06:19:00,1050,"In addition to Nathan's good comments on reducing the amount of tackle, the single most effective way to cope with the weight limitations is to leave all the beer and bottled liquor at home. Powdered drink mixes weigh next to nothing and work just fine for a week. Good Lord, it is only a week.(Written by someone who once in awhile likes a beer with his fish dinner, and enjoys having Old Grandad along on a fishing trip.)"
1572202,bigtimeelectric,2013-03-19 08:45:00,174,Thats a bit ironic. A drunkin scony telling us to leave the beer home. Haha. ps. Your gonna miss Greg Jennings this year as the vikes are heading to the meadowlands!!!!!On a serious note I have been on a few fly inns and we could prebuy our grocerys and beverages and they would fly them in ahead of time.
1572266,SinOrSwim,2013-03-19 09:02:00,1528,"Uhhhh, no! Judge much? Part of the fun is to sit in the cabin, drink beer, play poker etc. It's a GUYS trip. Beer is part of that."
1572786,bigtimeelectric,2013-03-19 11:01:00,174,SIN OR SWIM I THINK HE WAS JUST KIDDING..
1574978,pikeman14,2013-03-19 19:48:00,144,Adempsey...thank you for posting a great article. The list was very helpful and touched on all the important tips that we are all thinking about. A must read. Thanks againpikeman14
1575138,NY Walleye,2013-03-19 20:12:00,78,"Adempsey,Very impressive website. I will be printing and using for sure. Thank you for sharing."
1575242,unclejoe,2013-03-19 20:39:00,22,"Best tip to manage weight without skimping is to have your outfitter fly your beer/ beverages up a week or so before your trip. Some offer this service especially for big groups of 8 plus. They just throw your order on a less than full flight with another group. Most bring too much food, too many changes of clothes. I never skimp on tackle or beer but that is me."
1576682,RickOnt,2013-03-20 08:57:00,217,adempseyGreat info Very informative Thanks for postingRick
1577330,Pikeslayer8,2013-03-20 11:13:00,1460,"That is one spectacular blog! Best cumulative pre-trip article I've ever seen. Thanks for sharing that with us. I will make sure that everyone in my crew will see this. I've only 2 comments. First, the Walleye Eggs Benedict idea for breakfast is a great one and I think we will give er a try. Second, as quartermaster of my crew, if I showed up to fishcamp with a bag of crumpets, I'd never hear the end of it. Lol As far as the weight limits go, the only thing that I can add is that you should bring your food list into camp with you so you can make notes on what worked well and everyone enjoyed as well as narrowing you list down a bit sharper. For instance, we brought 5 dozen eggs last year but only used 4 as we have gone to lighter breakfast meals. Go through thoroughly what food stuffs are left over and sharpen your list for next year."
1577386,adempsey,2013-03-20 11:18:00,963,Thanks for the positive comments! I am happy that you all found it useful =).I also happen to like crumpets! Lol.
1526806,NY Walleye,2013-01-21 18:38:00,78,Planning a fly in fishing trip in July. Searched and read through a lot of the packing suggestions. Some of the posts were fantastic. Looking for any new ideas or common misses that have come up over the years. Heading to Lac Hebert Quebec with Air Tamarac.
1526884,SinOrSwim,2013-01-21 20:29:00,1528,"My first advice is pack light but take what YOU want to take. It's a vacation. If they charge extra, pay the extra. I've never understood paying $1000 for a fly in and fretting an extra $100 or whatever it may be in overages. But, that's just me. Our outfitter nevr charged us extra and we did fly-ins for 17 years. They just flew in extra stuff like beer, soda, ice on a later fliight or check flight.But, you can drop some weight by slimming down your tackle box. Most of us take way too much stuff. I also didn't ever pack pants. And, we go in August or September. I always wore/wear shorts with my rain gear/bibs over the top. That way when it's cold in the morning, I'm comfortable and can shed the rain gear when it gets hot and I'm not stuck in pants. There are many more ideas others will have too but to me it still comes down to take what you think you will need to enjoy your vacation."
1526931,GOBIG,2013-01-22 02:42:00,126,"Make a list, share it with who is going. If you really want something take it, it is your vacation, ENJOY"
1527085,SinOrSwim,2013-01-22 10:10:00,1528,"Yes, not everyone needs to take huge bottles of advil or soap etc. Now, I wouldn't share soap but you can take travel size. The other thing, take extra containers. Boxes, totes or bags whatever. You will always stop and get things, there will be loose gear from the trip up, groceries etc. You need empty containers to put them in. Our first few years we had random single things going onto the plane and you could tell the guys loading were laughing at us. doh. lol Bread/buns are tough but can use plastic totes so they don't squish. We also took a bunch of tortillas. They lay flat, no refrig etc and we make tacos and wraps with our fish for shore lunch. Have one person in charge of all kitchen/cooking stuff. Make a menu and stick to it. We also put X dollars into a kitty for the trip up. That pays for gas, border crossings and any other random fees and it makes it fair. Just be sure to yell NOT IT when deciding who is responsible for the kitty. Booze. Figure out what you will want/need and then take extra. You can't go to the general store for more and believe me, it stinks to run out of beer."
1527133,TIGHTLINER,2013-01-22 11:13:00,223,"Send a menu out of what you are looking at having have the other guys reply if something is on the list they do not or can not eat. After 3 weeks if no one replies go for it. Several things go to the grocery store walk the isles look at things you will need look for things that you need to mix water with. Look for the instant items that are staples. Noodles,rice,taters,crystal lite,koolaid,stove top dressing,soups,cornbread mixes,powdered milk. Frozen veggies are lighter than canned. Cook your meats and zip lock them. Eggbeaters will do for a week. Oatmeal for a breakfast meal. Everyone likes cinn a bun for a breakfast. You will be surpised how well things will pack that are in zips,or envelops. Use your imagaination remember you are only going to be in the bush for a week. Boil the water for 10 or 15 min when mixed with crystal lite it will be like drinking water from home. ( more room for beer ). One person get the groceries if someone wants to bring along something from home like a sheet cake,pie,banna bread fine. Buy smaller bottles or cans remember you have to bring everything out of the bush. If you know who you are going to fish with share a tackle box. When it comes to cloths. Fresh fruit of the looms daily a t shirt also. Shirts can be changed every 2 oe 3 days pack warm cloths you can always layer. Rain gear is usually light."
1527141,NathanH,2013-01-22 11:28:00,697,I would say for a lot of folks they take way too much tackle. My last trip we didnt fly in it took me two trips to get all me tackle into the cabin. I asked my dad what he brought? He showed me a small Plano box with 10 cankbaits in it. His favorites some doubles of coarse. I said well what about jigs ect. He said when he saw me loading up he took his stuff out. As I recall i used about 10 crankbaits the whole trip brought maybe 300. We lost a totale of 6 jigs during the trip. I had planned for more. I think i had 300 plus jigs with me. You never know how many jigs you will go through. I had a trip with my dad where we burned through 150. Those were the mono years. Needless to say my next trip I wont bother with all the gear.
1527193,dollure,2013-01-22 13:03:00,71,A few years ago on a fly-in I decided not to wear pants. The pilot would not let me on the plane. lol dollure
1527276,CSH Kucinski,2013-01-22 15:09:00,1340,Just PM you on this
1570161,Kmanster,2013-03-18 16:28:00,26,"Regarding our Fly-in trips.....Over the yrs. I learned it's just easier to tell everyone that they are responsible for their own snacks that way they buy what they want and don't eat yours. It's inevitable that you will have extra chips, crackers, etc. Same for lunches and most breakfasts. Most of us are small bkfast eaters anyways. Dinners are more coordinated and those meals/grociers are purchased by one of us before. We always buy our meat in Canada to save space and keep it frozen or close to it. As for tackle, we stick to the basics, jigs, cranks and spoons. We bring 1 - 2 gallon jugs of water each and boil water and use crystal light or similar to save room for beer. Some will bring juice boxes instead of soda(myself). We use buns for our bread as it's more hardy than loaf bread. We also bring some old tshirts and pants to wear and burn them the last night. We each keep a clean set of clothes back at the car for the ride home. If you take the time to sit down and remember your past fishing trips, you will know how much food, drink, clothes and tackle you actually went through or used in the past. Just my 2 cents Tight Lines my friends."
1571258,adempsey,2013-03-18 22:14:00,963,Here's an article I put together for my blogsite [still a work in progress]:http://www.lineonfishing.com/index.p...30-how-to-packHopefully it's OK to post the link here. I apologize if not.
