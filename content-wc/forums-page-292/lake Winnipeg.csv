3601314,BigEye,2015-03-01 18:31:00,223,A guy tells us to go to eagles nest. We have no idea where its at. We're staying at south beach casino. So far we've caught some little ones but need ideas where to go for bigger eyes. Anyone help?
3601418,Bandit,2015-03-01 18:51:00,140,Head West to the East side of Main Channel in 13-15 Flow below the ice. That's about 1 mile out from shore. I fish this spot Saturday & lots of big fish. Eagles Nest is another couple miles passed along the shore line between Main Channel & West Channel. Fishing can be on & off at times at Eagle Nest. I heard today fishing has been good at Prudens 2 miles down west Shore Line in 8 flow?

The nests are located near the mouth of the Red River. It's over 12 miles across the ice from Balsam Bay to the mouth of the Red. Find Prudens creek on google earth, and head north from there. 2-3 miles."

One more day then back home till next year. We'll be up to fish the soft water in late summer near Minaki.You guys are great
