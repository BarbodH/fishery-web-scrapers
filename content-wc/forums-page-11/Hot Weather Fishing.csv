6741927,Nimitz,2023-05-31 14:58:00,20,We are heading out tomorrow for Trout River Lodge to fish Lake Pakwash . This week has been standing reservation for 13 years and we will be dealing with the heat. Unusual for us. Any reports or tips on how the walleyes are reacting to this early heat would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
6742027,theweb,2023-06-01 07:00:00,7,"We are heading up this week as well.. Pakwash Lake for my 45th time.. (****, I'm getting old..) From the groups i know who have been up there last week and this week.. Opening week, the north end was hot.. most people got all the fish they wanted or needed right in Trout River and Highline bay.. Im sure there are still fish around there.. But I am also sure that the biggest groups of walleyes will have dispersed into the main lake by now.. Lots of big fish opening week. To find the walleyes now will be more interesting.. Usually, find the bigger bays and fish the wind blown sides.. I would also be looking deeper, but again deep on this lake early is more like 10-12' with the stained water.. We will be at Pakwash Lake Camp up by the beach.. The beach can get very good this time of year if the shiners start to run.. I will be in a big red Ranger.. if you happen to see me come by and say hey. Hope this helps. Theweb"
