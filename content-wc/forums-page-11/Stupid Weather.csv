6740919,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2023-05-25 13:19:00,240,"Up here in Michigan's UP, we had a lot of snow still on the ground a month ago, and also experienced flooding here on the western end, forcing residents to boil water and, in some cases, use sandbags to protect their homes and property. Flash forward 4 weeks, the water levels have dropped considerably, everything is blooming, and rumblings of dry weather and fire dangers up here, with above average temps. and no rain forecast for the next 7 days. Saw a mayfly on my windshield today, so seasonal changes are in fast forward right now. Hoping for rain and cooler temps. No one needs to deal with fire danger this early, especially the outfitters."
6740955,Pooch,2023-05-25 18:29:00,4618,"Speaking of box fans.... Two owners ago on Savant at Wildewood we used to always bring a new box fan and just leave it for the next group. They were and still are cheap. I think some of those fans are still in some of the cabins, but looking kind of tough now. Pooch"

6741015,Old Timer,2023-05-26 06:17:00,255,"You can hit a stretch of bad weather just about anytime in Ontario. I've been snake bit several times where it was impossible to fish nearly the entire trip. And on a few occasions I just paid the bill and drove home early. Anymore, I prefer a modern drive-in cabin with good-enough fishing in the lake. Whatever creature comforts ProV1800 has at home is what I prefer to rent. No book says you have to go primitive while chasing walleyes. Outposts? That's a different program."
6741023,Eckohlt,2023-05-26 07:01:00,3685,"At a outpost the only thing that keeps me off the water is killer waves n lighting,other than that sunrise to sunset it's a pounding."
6741117,Old Timer,2023-05-26 15:28:00,255,"Years ago a group of us flew into the Larus beach cabin during a hot spell. This was over June 15th and we figured the temps had to be in the 90s. The cabin was a broaster oven and outside the sand fleas ate you alive. So mid-day we took the plastic table chairs and sat in the lake up to our chests. We only fished early and then late into the dark. Surprising, the catching was pretty good. On that trip we caught four 30s and several over 28. Woulda fooled me, even for Larus."
6741355,Franco,2023-05-28 18:05:00,107,"Heading up to the Wawa area this week and it looks like it’s getting to 30 with high humidity… in late May/early June!!!! I’ve never fished for long in that kind of weather, though I’m hoping it only stays hot for a few hours. The nights still look cool…below 10 anyways. Bugs will be bad!"
6741393,kzoofisher,2023-05-29 04:11:00,5144,Yesterday the high at my cabin was 85 (29) and the temp this morning is 34 (1). Forecast high today is 86 (30). That's a serious wardrobe change at lunchtime.
6741399,prov1800,2023-05-29 05:07:00,5010,Only wardrobe change yesterday was take of sweatshirt.
6741405,Fisherman1792,2023-05-29 05:17:00,927,"All you guys complaining about the heat we are getting already, I'll trade you places. You can come down 3000 feet underground and deal with the heat and humidity. LOL! I havent even had a chance to drop a line in the water yet. Fisherman 1792"
6740765,SweetD,2023-05-24 21:45:00,243,"I swore I would never go back in mid-July due to the heat we experienced last year and now appears we are going to get a repeat of mid 80’s but at the end of May! %}}<^^}},, f’er!!!!I know the fishing will still be good but really enjoy a crispy cool morning with a fire to warm up the cabin. Instead we will be packing 2 box fans along so we can breathe and sleep in the cabins!!!!Oh well, we march on and will help make a strong case for a second September trip this year!!!!Good luck all"
6740771,Eckohlt,2023-05-25 04:26:00,3685,"It could be much worse,7 straight days of rain really sucks,I'm a cold weather guy,but I'll take 80 and no humidity any day."
6740803,eyecatcher1,2023-05-25 06:28:00,323,Our group stopped going for opener after lots of wind and snow on opening day four years in a row.
6740825,Pooch,2023-05-25 07:14:00,4618,"Fifteen days in camp late July, cold rain all day everyday and a fire in the wood burner 24-7. Fishing was OK at best, but a long trip with good friends and constantly drying out rain suits at night made for a trip we all remember for sure. This was Lake Savant. Canada weather can play tricks on you. The above trip was followed a month later same year by a shorts and t-shirts trip over Labor Day to Lac Seul. I'd rather carry some extra layers and not use them than be wet and cold the entire trip. Canadian weather can be a trickster for those of us leaving hot humid weather south of the border. Pooch"
6740827,chscwi,2023-05-25 07:14:00,6,"In my experience the best fishing days have been these really hot/sunny stretches early in the season. The water is warming fast and the fish get really aggressive. One year in late May, around 2010, we were casting for northerns mid day with lil cleos and we couldn't keep the walleyes off them right on shore. And the northerns chased/bite our walleyes on several occasions."
6740853,Eckohlt,2023-05-25 09:11:00,3685,"I hear ya pooch,I've had long john's on more than once in late July,but rain everyday gets dam old,fishing in Ont is a crap shoot with the weather.the most important item in your bag is really good rain gear and for me I never leave the muck boots home.Neck gators really help from water running down your neck also."
6740857,bthomas3333,2023-05-25 09:28:00,465,Any fishing is good fishing but I hear you. The extremes can def mess with the fishing not to mention the comfort of the fishermen.Brett
6740883,kim n indiana,2023-05-25 11:05:00,62,LMAO..... I told you a week ago to pack the box fans. Now you are taking 2 of them. Only thing saving you is they don't weigh much for flight in/out. Just go catch bunch walleye will ya ...
6740903,Walleye2242,2023-05-25 12:14:00,263,"We did a fly in about 20 years ago. It was a big heat stretch for that time of the year. 90's everyday and being in a cabin with no electricty that is tucked back in the woods made for some hot nights. warm beer and warm water. We had a huge throw net...we packed it full off beer and water and sunk it in 70 feet of water hoping it would get cold...no luck. Found a small, cool spring that fed in...so we tried that...the moose stomped the crap put of it. It was nice on the lake but the cabin at night was a rough go. Been in snow storms in may and in late sept. My fave time is like the 2nd of sept...maybe the 3rd. But in reality....just the way it goes."
6740907,Eckohlt,2023-05-25 12:24:00,3685,It ain't easy being a fisherman!
