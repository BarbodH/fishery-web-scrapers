6741909,MrSimon,2023-05-31 13:27:00,922,"I've always found the pike to move out of the shallow spawning grounds pretty quick, spend some time in the fresh green weed beds, before moving deep for the summer. So mid-June is usually transition time. I'd start with some green cabbage in 2-8 FOW. If the big ones aren't there, slide deeper. Also, follow the walleye. The big pike aren't usually too far away."
6741915,prov1800,2023-05-31 13:35:00,5010,As far as Eagle goes and for that matter any lake in NWO by mid June the larger pike are enjoying the cooler waters around 30 ft or deeper.The commercial fisherman on the east end of Eagle has his Whitefish nets set at anywhere from 60-80 ft and catches pike in them as well as other species.So hopefully that answers your question.For me we fish humps and other structures quit a bit shallower and if your lucky to be catching walleye tgere are good chances of a feeding pike on that structure coming up shallower.

If the temps are getting into the high 60s and 70s: Neckdowns with wind blowing through and weeds all the better. 10-20 ft deep Mouth of bays with weeds in 8-18ft near deep water Current areas where you can fish the edges or riffles Worst case troll lures that will run around 20ft but for me blind trolling is really giving up. You will catch some fish but I have never caught numbers of big pike this way. Brett
