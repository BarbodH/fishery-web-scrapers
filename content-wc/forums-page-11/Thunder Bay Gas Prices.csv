6741685,wallguy1992,2023-05-30 10:26:00,19,Yes they donâ€™t have to pay as much tax selling gas on the reservation.
6741687,gmattbruin,2023-05-30 10:38:00,174,Native gas stations are certainly regulated by Provincial govt as all stations are. The big difference is gas is sold to these native owned stations with limited taxes. The owners then pass that savings onto the customers. Of course youll see an even cheaper $$ for natives as even more tax savings are on their pumps.
6741689,prov1800,2023-05-30 10:40:00,5010,On reserves there's no taxes put on gas.You will get it cheaper like I do at the reserve but if your a native you will pay a lot less.
