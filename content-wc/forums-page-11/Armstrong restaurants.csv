6740211,bode,2023-05-22 13:15:00,39,Anyone know if any restaurants have opened in Armstrong. All were closed last year except the gas station sold Chester Chicken. Gails was closed and E and J appeared to be a boarding house. Thanks for any input.
6740321,Bfgilly,2023-05-23 04:30:00,18,I was there last year in both June & August. The restaurant was open each time. You must have hit a day off for them.
6740667,bode,2023-05-24 08:29:00,39,Thanks. I was there August 15th. They may have the same problem with staffing like here in the states. You must like the area too since you went twice. We've been going since 2003.

Started going to Caribou Lake Lodge and have returned there every but one when we went to Lac Seul. Partner turned 81 this year and says this it for him so might be my last also. Definitely nothing like Ontario."
