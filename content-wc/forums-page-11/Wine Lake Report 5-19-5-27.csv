The nice thing about opening week is that we can come into camp a day early and do a little scouting. Sure enough Anishinabi Falls seemed to be the hot spot! We caught a variety of fish but of course that night was burger night since opening day is Saturday We were surprised how low the water was, an unbelievable 7 feet difference from the flooding last year. The low water prevented entry into Mud Lake and exposed rocks on the other lake entrances and the Cedar River access to Wine Lake. The beaver population seems to have exploded and there were new huts and dams all over the place. It seems like we were just at the end of the walleye spawn since the walleye were rather slow and random for the first few days but things quickly got back to what we expect from these waters. Walleye fishing was rather slow on Saturday, but we found a hole on Sunday in Beaver Lake that produced for us for the whole week. Whenever we needed walleye we knew we could depend on this whole to provide. We caught hundreds of walleye through the week but nothing was huge with our largest being only 26 1/2"" for the week, caught by my son, Nate. We drifted a lot and really only anchored at ""The Hole"" and as the driver on Sunday we were drifting a rock face and I was in the deeper water with an Electric Chicken walleye assassin plastic (google it, the most productive for me other than minnows this year). While drifting I hooked a rock which is not unusual, or was it? Giving me a little give I then assumed it was a log or a stick, but all of a sudden it kicked and a light tackle battle ensued. After a ten minute fight I got it to the boat and it took Dock about another ten minutes to net it while my son Nate recorded it all. Miraculously the knot held and the 8 pound test was adequate to keep the 33 1/2 inch lake trout at the end of my pole. It seems like Dock was trying to knock this brute off of the line as the boat drifted into the shore line rocks during the fight. Finally we got it into the net for a picture and a release. We all were wondering what that lake trout was doing in a lake that is only 30 feet deep, but that happens in May! Throughout the week we continued to fish for trout in the evenings the more traditional way of trolling x raps in some of our favorite spots. It was somewhat slow as the water was still only about 50 degrees but we managed to catch four others 28-31 inches. We had several other hits that did not hook but I imagine the trout bite will we shallow and hot through June. As far as pike go, there were more small notherns than ever this year. Those hammer handles were everywhere! We never target pike but I managed to pull up the biggest one for the week at 40"" while walleye fishing. Between us we caught 8 pike over 30"" with the second biggest at 35"". Smallies are also everywhere but we never caught a huge one with my 18 incher holding out as the biggest. We caught about 10 over 17 and a few little guys. We love the fight of them but seldom target them. We know where they are and usually throw a chicken at them when we are in their territory. It was a good thing I had 3 money fish because I had a horrible week at poker! Dock had no money fish but had a wonderful week at poker. As usual, our week was fantastic. No rain and actual heat late in the week. The crew at Wine Lake Camp is phenomenal and the camp is our paradise. The Moose cabin, our home for the week, is one of the older cabins, but it has a charm that we appreciate. The other campers were all great people and we enjoyed meeting them. We booked our trip for next year and lucky to find an opening in June. Can't wait! Hooks"

6741817,Bill Krejca,2023-05-31 06:34:00,6107,Nice report. Re: trout - wonder if there is an underwater spring nearby. Bill
6741823,HeHooksHimself,2023-05-31 07:10:00,725,"Bill, I am not sure but I doubt it. There is access to this lake through a small shallow channel. My guess is the she swam in as she was going shallow for the spring feed. We have caught a few trout in this lake in previous years and in a few other connected lakes so it is not unheard of. Hooks"
