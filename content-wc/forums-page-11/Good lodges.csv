6741697,eyeman_1,2023-05-30 12:33:00,690,This is one of the Totem lodges and you boat to this outpost lodge. Great fishing and nice lodge.
6741699,valley366,2023-05-30 12:34:00,193,Tons of options up there. May help to narrow down what you are looking for in fishing. Looking for numbers of Walleye? Big Walleye? Trophy Northern? Smallmouth action?Or maybe narrow it down by how far north you desire to go. Saw the one post that listed the Sunset Country Website. Have used that site numerous times to narrow down the search.I personally go to Five Lakes Lodge on Gullrock. Can bring your own boat. I also had a great trip into Woman River Camp last year. Again can bring your own boat.May want to look at how long the drive is on gravel when taking your own boat. Five Lakes it is just the length of the driveway on gravel. Woman River is about 30 miles.Also going into decision is do you want to cook your own meals or have them cooked for you? Are you looking for 5 star accommodations or just basic cabins.A lot of choices out there.
