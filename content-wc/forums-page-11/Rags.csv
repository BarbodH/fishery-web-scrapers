6740359,Ranger319,2023-05-23 07:02:00,166,Anyone go through the Rags yet? Curious if one can blow through or if youâ€™ll need to idle. Thanks!
6740513,Hunts1,2023-05-23 18:15:00,123,"We are going first week of June. Last year water was high, so no problem. This year looks average. If you are familiar you are probably good through the rags at good speed. I use this website for water levels. Maybe not completely accurate but some intel:https://lwcb.ca/pdf/LacSeul.pdfBest wishes,Mike"
6740559,prov1800,2023-05-23 19:54:00,5010,Just messaged my buddy.Colin guides at moosehorn in Sioux said it's down 2 1/2 ft there.He runs it wide open but if you don't know the channel then better slow down.
6740601,pjshorthorn,2023-05-24 04:34:00,5654,I doubt the houseboats are running the rags this spring unless they have a big set of brass sinkers. LOL I've been running the rags since 1990 and I would take it with caution this year . The other option is to to take the longer route around Devil's Elbow. PjShorthorn
6740615,prov1800,2023-05-24 05:38:00,5010,You would be coming from Hudson right PJ.So not much further really coming around island.
6740811,pjshorthorn,2023-05-25 06:52:00,5654,Yep .coming from Hudson if in a HB. Roughy an hour extra going around Devil's Elbow in a HB. Lot less in a regular boat. PjShorthorn
6741183,David Anderson,2023-05-26 21:50:00,2073,"Just came through the Rags yesterday with my 620 with 250HP. Maintained plane, maybe 30 mph. Lac Seul Outposts have been running through daily now. Friend went up a week ago Tuesday and had to run Devil's Elbow but Ken at camp said the water level has gone up 18 inches in 2 weeks."
6741227,jimirjr,2023-05-27 12:13:00,1149,"I assume the ""Ken"" you spoke about was Ken Jr ?"
6741239,David Anderson,2023-05-27 15:33:00,2073,Yes
