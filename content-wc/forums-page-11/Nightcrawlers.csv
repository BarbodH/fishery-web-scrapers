6741171,Pooch,2023-05-26 20:18:00,4618,"https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=481169 Just north of the turnoff to the town of Savant Lake. Exact location I don't remember. On the right side of the road (easy to miss) a hundred feet off the highway. They have a different name now, but I don't remember what. It's between the Savant lake town and the Wildewood parking lot. Someone here will know. Also, https://www.facebook.com/thefallsbait/ in Kakabeka Falls. Pooch"
6741247,phishfearme,2023-05-27 18:47:00,1242,Vern's Minnow in Ignace - just across the street from the Subway. They've been in business for decades. phish
6741353,Franco,2023-05-28 17:59:00,107,Good to know about the relocation…I would have driven right by it!! And sorry to hear about Larry. I remember him quite well.
6742115,drlee,2023-06-01 15:30:00,409,"Did not know the old ""Larry's"" had moved across the street. Thanks. Will be stopping there on June 16 for crawlers. Best. The ""Minnow Shed"" north of Silver $$ off 599 has leeches, minnows, and crawlers. Good prices, very nice people. They fly their plane to a variety of spots and collect bait. Not sure their crawlers live up to Larry's. I know a couple of camps in the area get their minnows from the Shed, as well as leeches. Silver $$ newer owners are super nice. We have skipped staying in Ignace because of the unknowns since covid and lack of places to eat. Silver $$ has good accommodations and fixes a nice breakfast to order. Liquor outlet is also a nice last minute spot. Then off to Austin's Wilderness Fishing Lodge on the 17th. Fished out of there too many years to count. Later, off to Press Lake Camp, July/August for two weeks. Another go to place...first class!"
6740965,daman4799,2023-05-25 19:13:00,4,Whereis a good place to get night crawlers on the way to Ignace? Thanks Daman
6740973,Franco,2023-05-25 20:12:00,107,Where are you coming from?
6740979,drlee,2023-05-25 21:12:00,409,"My camp owners get their crawlers in Kakabeka Falls on the left side of the road next to the liquor store and a gas station. Cannot recall the name of the place, since they have changed ownership. I have used them for years and they are the very best. NO NOT get you crawlers in Ignace."
6740989,Franco,2023-05-26 01:57:00,107,That’s Larry’s Bait Shop. It changed names recently (I guess Larry sold). Best bait shop around that area.
6740993,daman4799,2023-05-26 03:41:00,4,Coming from Grand portage.
6740995,daman4799,2023-05-26 03:43:00,4,Does Ignace have a good bait shop?
6741025,lawson2343,2023-05-26 07:05:00,459,"If you are going north on 599 out of Ignace, Moose Creek Bait (north of the Silver Dollar) has crawlers and minnows. I've been very happy with his crawlers."
6741093,Eckohlt,2023-05-26 12:47:00,3685,"I'm gonna try silver minnow bait shop,north of Thunder Bay for the first time for crawlers."
6741131,elway12,2023-05-26 17:39:00,335,Larry's Bait is now The Falls Bait & Tackle in Kakabeka Falls just west of T.B. They just moved there whole building across the street from where they were originally located! We always buy our leeches and a few crawlers from there. Larry sold the bait store a few years ago and passed away last May.
6741135,RichA$1970,2023-05-26 17:42:00,1159,"We had breakfast there last September as we had time to kill, nice people. There’s also a bait show past Savant Lake on 599."
