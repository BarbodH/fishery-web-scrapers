6741477,kettyspanky,2023-05-29 13:42:00,271,So going across the bong bridge is the way to go ? That's good to know. I believe we had to come across it on the way back last year. Can anyone give a update on hwy 61 ?
6742369,kona77,2023-06-03 08:17:00,236,"Just returned home from our trip. Driving up from a couple different points in Wisc. (Minocqua, Green Bay etc) and while there are some detours on 53 in Duluth due to bridge work it was really no big deal. Just added a few minutes to our trip."
6740455,camp chef,2023-05-23 13:38:00,915,There appears to be a detour in Duluth on the way up to International Falls. Check Minn DOT for details...It looks like the detour also involves 61 North.
6740457,Walleye2242,2023-05-23 13:45:00,263,Seems as if this detour has been going for about 10 years now. not that i care...i am heading to Canada.
6740459,camp chef,2023-05-23 13:47:00,915,This will be the first year that we have to take the Bong Bridge across the river.
6741033,NARDA 1,2023-05-26 07:25:00,636,Bong Bridge is the way to go. I get on the 2 in Superior to 35/2 to Midway Rd. which takes you back to 53 near Pike Lake MN.
6741067,N_of_Quibell,2023-05-26 10:03:00,151,"I just came back earlier this week. Going south on 53, I recommend 13 (Midway Rd?) to 2, then 2/35, and across on the Bong, eventually back to 53 via 2. Going N, I recommend just the reverse. Lots of work (lane closures) in WI on 53, none in MN that I saw."
6741071,7 Mag,2023-05-26 10:31:00,1887,"Thanks for posting that! How is 53 thru Wisconsin, lots of construction last year?"
6741095,N_of_Quibell,2023-05-26 12:56:00,151,"53 through WI had lots of work going on; several lane closures, shoulder work, in at least one case two-way single lane traffic. If I recall correctly, 94 had some work too, but not alot. I was in no rush, and tried to take it easy. Watch for deer, and be safe."

6741169,btyreprich,2023-05-26 20:09:00,1067,"Reading these posts with great interest as we leave early next Friday for our Canadian trip. Hoping someone who has just made this drive will respond to this post. I live in Rhinelander and was thinking of driving over to Minong to get on Highway 53 there. I realize there is a detour in Superior / Duluth on the bridge and will have to take the Bong Bridge. I'm OK with this - like I have a choice! Question I have is if there is any road construction on Highway 53 from Minong north to Superior. Visited the DOT web sites for both WI and MN, but could not determine what if any construction there is on this stretch of the highway."
6741185,Shane Denotter,2023-05-27 04:30:00,39,Btyre. Single lane around Solon Springs are for about 5 miles. slows you down to 55 is all.
