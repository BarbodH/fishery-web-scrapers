6741607,prov1800,2023-05-30 06:32:00,5010,I have mine paired to my cell phone and defiantly so much easier to hit keypad.It also has pre written messages that don't cost anything to send out.Another bonus is that the mapping appears much better on my phone screen to and can lay way points on it for guys without GPS.
6741679,N_of_Quibell,2023-05-30 10:02:00,151,"Also, I really like the flexibility with which Inreach plans can be managed. I can turn service on when I need it, but most of the year I suspend my plan. And no, I don't have any financial interest in the company...."
6741681,prov1800,2023-05-30 10:15:00,5010,Run mine all year since I travell a lot in winter on snowmobile.Sometimes out of cell range but have used mine on plenty of flyout moose hunts.my pkg cheap monthly but beef it up for flyouts to unlimited texting.
6740837,phishfearme,2023-05-25 08:15:00,1242,"We haven't looked into renting a satellite phone for years but plan to get one for this year's trip. The way technology changes it wouldn't surprise me if things are quite a bit different now. So - does anyone have some recent experience? who to rent from? are the capabilities the same? charges for use in addition to rental? recommendations? many thanks, phish"
6740855,bthomas3333,2023-05-25 09:12:00,465,"Well good news the prices are down in recent years. The bad news is the reliability still isnt great. Sometimes it takes a couple tries to get the call to go through. If the call is longer than a few minutes it drops and requires a redial. Im hoping maybe the Starlink will be the go to for more lodges.Also there aren't really any great options to pass data without completely breaking the bank which is sad. If they could work on the data issue for even a very thin band of data - voice over the internet / internet calling is the way to go. If a lodge or camp offers any internet at all I just use apple FaceTime voice only and it is free, but such is the state of the game.I use Outfitter Satellite out of TN. The phone has always shown up on time and ready to go. I probably should price shop and rethink if there is a better option but they are saved in my favorites and I just go that way. They know me and save me some of the paperwork.Brett"
6740865,N_of_Quibell,2023-05-25 10:01:00,151,"I too used to use Outfitters - they seemed quite dependable. However, the past few years I have relied entirely on my Garmin Inreach, which if fine if texting is sufficient, which it is for me."
6740885,staker1875,2023-05-25 11:25:00,13,I would look at the newest iphone. Believe it has satellite SOS texting. Maybe you are in the market for a new phone anyways. Also Garmin Inreach is another way to communicate without having to purchase a phone.
6740915,prov1800,2023-05-25 13:02:00,5010,r services.my personal Depends where you are staying.Drive ins usually have cell reception and wifi.Some flyouts have both cell and wifi.I have a my garmin expedition for my own personal use in case of emergencies.
6740923,bthomas3333,2023-05-25 13:39:00,465,Yes. I have the Inreach too. But when the wife needs to chat I need the phone. I get away a lot so if I dont have WIFI to talk I need the phone on top of the in reach but if you can get away with only texting it is by far the best deal. Brett
6740925,SweetD,2023-05-25 14:10:00,243,Oleo $150 at REI. Requires a service plan.
6740957,N_of_Quibell,2023-05-25 18:40:00,151,"I'll grant that texting on the Inreach along is a pain because of a lack of a decent keypad. However, if you pair it with say an andriod tablet via the Earthmate app it isn't too bad."
6740991,Franco,2023-05-26 02:03:00,107,I got a used Iridium 9500 on eBay for $350…a sat phone is a sat phone is a sat phone. I would get a used one and then buy the “Northern Lights” card…$460 Canadian for 200 minutes / 6 months in Canada and Alaska.
6740997,Skywagon,2023-05-26 04:38:00,1106,"I have a friend in Illinois that is going to sell a 9575 Iridium (top of the line) that he bought new last summer if anyone is interested. He is selling it because he just bought a Starlink internet system for his camp and won't be needing it anymore. If anyone is interested I will send you his phone number. Communications gets talked about frequently on Walleye Central, here are my thoughts again. For sat phones you definitely want to use an Iridium phone, Global Star does not work nearly as well up here, I use a 9575 Iridium. For a communicator it is the same thing, get one that uses Iridium satellites which the Garmin Inreach does (that is what I use), stay away from Spot, it uses Global Star satellites, they have poorer coverage then Irdium does in these latitudes. Communicators of any sort are line of site, for best results walk out to the end of the dock to minimize interference from the trees."
