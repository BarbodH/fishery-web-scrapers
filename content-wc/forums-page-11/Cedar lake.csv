6741855,prov1800,2023-05-31 08:55:00,5010,West end Bill
6741901,Bill Krejca,2023-05-31 13:10:00,6107,"I am most familiar with the southern end of Whitefish. Oh, you mean the west part of Cedar, yeah, much clearer water there, makes sense.Bill"
6741917,prov1800,2023-05-31 13:38:00,5010,Fairly clean water and much quieter there as most go to east end.Thats a bonus for me.
6741337,7 Mag,2023-05-28 16:21:00,1887,"Looks like a great time, thanks for the pics."
6741341,prov1800,2023-05-28 16:31:00,5010,Spring is time of plenty.Water Temps will rise with the heat wave and push them down bit deeper
6741351,Franco,2023-05-28 17:56:00,107,Beautiful fish! Is Cedar Lake the one that’s just off the highway between Dryden and Ear Falls?
6741357,prov1800,2023-05-28 18:32:00,5010,Yup hwy 105.
6741739,prov1800,2023-05-30 15:53:00,5010,So here is the muskie the guys caught on a walleye last was released real fast after prying its mouth open to get walleye out pictured in other pic.
6741743,Eckohlt,2023-05-30 16:10:00,3685,"Start jigging walleyes to catch muskies,what size do they eat john??"
6741775,7 Mag,2023-05-30 19:24:00,1887,That's a great picture!
6741777,prov1800,2023-05-30 19:31:00,5010,"It sure is.That muskie was 47 "".brought in on a walleye rod.Just had to share it"
6741787,RichA$1970,2023-05-30 20:47:00,1159,That’s an awesome picture!
6741815,Bill Krejca,2023-05-31 06:30:00,6107,"Great before and after pic, many memories of similar follows from the clear waters of LOW Whitefish Bay. Bill"
6741237,prov1800,2023-05-27 14:39:00,5010,"So this past week had 6 guys staying at Clarks Norther Lights resort like they always do on opener and come back first week of Sept.These guys like to keep track of what they catch.They got in on last Friday night and got to fish 7 days.The cooler water Temps had walleyes biting like crazy and very shallow.Everyone of them was hauling in fish after fish.Had a couple walleye dinners and nobtake home fish.2 are staying another week with families coming in today for round 2.Only click for walleyes and came up with 1708 walleye for the week.Pretty good I'd say.Lots of average and some better with a 28 1/2"" for big fish.can only put 5 pics here so one guy will be put on here later.Few good pike caught also and a big muskie on a walleye."
6741259,RichA$1970,2023-05-27 20:35:00,1159,Nice catches and hope they’re biting in 1 more week to go!
6741265,prov1800,2023-05-27 21:20:00,5010,They'll be biting.
6741283,Eckohlt,2023-05-28 06:18:00,3685,"Bunch of nice eaters in those pictures,they must let the big ones go."
6741303,kzoofisher,2023-05-28 08:42:00,5144,If you're fishing for numbers you should focus on the ones you can boat flip.
6741317,prov1800,2023-05-28 14:19:00,5010,They don't keep any only few they ate during week.
6741319,prov1800,2023-05-28 14:29:00,5010,Met up with new crew on lake this morning.Staying another week.Great bite this morning.I burned through my 5 dozen minnows again around noon.Used my crank bait after on some smallies and still caught walleyes on it to.Lost the crank to a muskie so good thing I bought spares.Had another muskies hit a pretty good walleye earlier but she let go.water temp up to 62f this morning.Going to warm up fast now with the 30c Temps all this week.
6741321,Eckohlt,2023-05-28 14:31:00,3685,"Long skinny eyes after spawned out,there hungry devils."
