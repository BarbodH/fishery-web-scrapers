6741701,orchard frank,2023-05-30 12:45:00,1900,"Make a ton of them down here in Florida. Got a tip from a chef. Put some olive oil and an envelope of McCormick taco seasoning in a zip lock, toss in the fish filets, cut into smaller pieces if large fish. Let it marinate in the fridge for a while, 2-3-4 hours best. longer ok. Move the bag around some to make sure everything gets coated well. Cooked on a hot cast iron or skillet, will crust up slightly, cook fast, depending on thickness. They will spoil you for fish tacos, make the tacos with anything to your taste, the fish will be the star of the show. I sometimes do a large batch for gatherings, neighbors, etc. use a gallon zip lock, plenty of olive oil, 2 packs of seasoning, lots of fish, snappers usually, and dump the bag onto my Blackstone flat top, toss em, chop em, done quick."
6741745,Terwalleye,2023-05-30 16:33:00,166,We love shredded cabbage oin the freshly fried walleye strips. Add to the cabbge mix ANYTHING. Ranch and bacon bits. Ranch and Thai sweet chili sauce (bang bang Fish tacos) Love Taco bell Border sauce. This year using a Costco Avacodo Lime sauce for the baae and then drizziling varoius hot suauces. Really love the Buffalo Wild Wings Spicy Garlic! Cant go wrong Just need a fresh tortilla and walleye strip. Mouth is watering thinking about it
6741869,grindstone,2023-05-31 09:14:00,201,"so shells. We buy burrito sixed tortillas from Costco. They do enough volume that the tortillas are fresh. We construct wraps / walleye burritos rather than traditionial tacos tortillas. One guy using a big steel pan crisps up the tortillas (like 30-45 seconds per side) and lays them out to be assembled by the individuals from assorted fixings. We bake our walleye. Everyone enjoys a couple of lard free days. Also Costco a big bag of chihuahua cheese both for the ""tacos"" and we make a couple of cheese quesadillas as apps. Take a big hand full of cheese directly into hot pan a minuet later lay the shell on that cheese. Melt / brown the cheese lift and turn the cheese up it releases trust me throw another shell on top minuet or so on each side remove cut and serve. Always a hit. Heading up for a week in two weeks"

6741087,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-05-26 12:08:00,358,"I am going to make fish tacos for the first time this year. I am looking for advice on ingredients, taco shells, and any other help. Thank you."
6741139,dosxx,2023-05-26 17:47:00,60,"We use fresh walleye fillets and give them a quick dip in Frank’s Red Hot and roll them in Andy’s red or Louisiana fish fry mix and fry as usual. Sometimes the combo makes it a bit salty so I’ll mix seasoned and unseasoned mix together.The key to me is the toppings. We make up a batch of vinegar based coleslaw and some fresh pico de gallo and make our tacos with flour tortillas. I prefer corn but flour is a bit easier to do and actually holds up a little better (and it’s preferred by my buddy who has a mild corn allergy). If I use corn, quality tortillas are important and I double them up and fry them in a little oil for a bit of crispiness.If you’re interested in the recipe for pico or the slaw feel free to contact me via PM and I’ll send you a copy.Cheers"

6741157,lmoore,2023-05-26 18:51:00,40,Typically I keep it pretty simple with a standard mayo based slaw and some shredded cheddar on a flour tortilla. I like a little kick so I add a few dashes of a mango habenero hot sauce.
6741165,muskyman73,2023-05-26 19:57:00,401,"We blacken the walleye on the bbq using the bbq matt with holes in them, this way the fish gets blackened but will not fall through. The slaw is key. There are some chopped salads in the bag pre-made that work pretty good too. Pico is good too for those who like it. Corn tortillas and flour too."
6741181,bfish,2023-05-26 21:26:00,1096,"Breaded fried fish (I like 3 rivers cornmeal (white cornmeal flour mixture)), napa cabbage thinly sliced, and a spiced crema (adobe, chipotle, hot sauce, etc) makes the base of a good fish taco,,,, Then good sides obviously lime, cilantro, but also pico de gallo, avocado, cojito cheese, pickled red onion, diced tomatoes, jalapenos, hot sauce/salsa (green, brown and red), etc. Personally I would rather have them small and eat 5 of them vs 2 large ones."
6741309,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-05-28 11:35:00,358,I appreciate the great ideas. This is a wonderful forum for getting advice.
6741325,fergiefish,2023-05-28 14:44:00,197,"We typically have fish tacos once or twice a trip. They are made for shore lunch so not as elaborate as some may do at the cabin. We take regular shore lunch of some sort and add taco seasoning from Schillings. We have some that like more seasoning than others, so it's always a little different each time. We dip our fillets in egg then roll it in the seasoned mix and pan fry them. We use soft flour tortillas and add shredded lettuce, shredded cheese, sour cream, and home made salsa. They are a great treat out on the lake."
6741385,Live to jig,2023-05-28 20:36:00,159,Fry your walleye in strips and build it any way you want we use the soft shell taco boats and don't forget the Spanish rice
6741389,RCDuck,2023-05-28 22:15:00,18,"I always fry the fish as I would normally, and make the following Chipotle Mayo, and top with shredded cabbage. Chipotle Mayo for Fish Tacos 1 cup mayo 1/2 cup cilantro Juice of 1/2 lime 2 teaspoons honey 1 chipotle pepper from a can of chipotle in adobo (Chopped) 1 garlic clove (Chopped)"
