6741099,N_of_Quibell,2023-05-26 13:08:00,151,"Glad to hear it was good for you! Sat. it was way too windy for me to put the Sportboat into Cliff, so I thought I'd give Mystery a try. Apparently other people had the same idea - 3 trucks at the launch; I turned around and went back to camp. Then went west to a spot I think you know and fished from shore. By evening; there where 4 boats stacked in there - I saw nary a fish caught. But the trout fishing the previous week had been pretty good, and I went home happy."
6741233,Fisherman1792,2023-05-27 13:31:00,927,We've had 3 or 4 fires pop up in the last couple of days. Apparently there are fires burning east and west of White river and the highway is closed. I would not be surprised that they put a no fire restriction on starting today. Checked the weather forcast and no rain in sight for the next week anyways. Fisherman 1792
6741235,prov1800,2023-05-27 14:23:00,5010,Looks hot and dry.Iam surprised there are ni fire restrictions yet.Just asking for trouble as usual and then it becomes to late.As far as iam concerned we should have a fire restriction from May on.
6741711,Deer Lake 1,2023-05-30 13:05:00,12,Canada fire map shows a fire on an island on Eagle. Possibly near Midway? Any news on that?

6739815,Chequamegon,2023-05-20 09:40:00,112,"Yes, right after snow melt is one of the times of year with greatest risk for forest and grass fires. In the north country temperatures tend to be on the cool side, often below freezing at night, and ground temperatures are still too cold for vegetation to start greening up. Leaf and grass litter from last year is brown and dry and fires start easily until it warms up enough for vegetation to start greening up."
6739881,C&K,2023-05-20 18:14:00,492,"I read on the ""news"" that's it's caused by Climate Change and it's going to get worse. They can't control thunderstorms and fires and hurricanes and that kind of thing. But if everybody gets electric trucks and electric boats right away they can control the climate and cap the temperature rise at 1 to 2 degrees, which will fix it.https://globalnews.ca/news/9705916/c...treme-weather/"
6739885,Eckohlt,2023-05-20 18:29:00,3685,"I'm gonna go right after church tomorrow and get a electric truck n electric boat,that should bring the temp down,my wife's temp might rise though!"
6739897,C&K,2023-05-20 19:46:00,492,"There's a direct correlation in the timeline of when these big fires started and mass produced automobiles first appeared with infernal combustion engines. Henry Ford introduced the Model T in 1908. Them Model T's didn't have catalytic converters and EGR valves and it launched a Climate Change event virtually overnight. By 1910 the whole west was on fire.A number of factors contributed to the destruction caused by the Great Fire of 1910. The wildfire season started early that year because the winter of 1909Â–1910 and the spring and summer of 1910 were extremely dry, and the summer sufficiently hot to have been described as ""like no others.""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Fire_of_1910 Any climate change scientist can tell you this."
6740777,Skywagon,2023-05-25 04:51:00,1106,"I flew up to the cabin (between Sioux Lookout and Pickle Lake) on Monday for a couple of days to open up the cabin, I had no idea until I got home yesterday that there was a small fire going on less than 2 miles away. It turns out the fire had been burning for a week, there had been 50 fire fighter involved at one time. I had flown in from the other direction, had not noticed smoke coming in and since the fire was downwind from the cabin I never smelled the smoke either once I was on the ground. I had heard a helicopters but assumed it was mineral exploration, I didn't have a clue. The moral of the story is that it has been extremely dry since the snow melted, if we don't get some rain the bush will only get dryer, be careful if cooking shore lunch."
6740871,N_of_Quibell,2023-05-25 10:25:00,151,"I was fishing for lake trout last week on a lake between VB and Kenora. A plane came over fairly low - I don't know my planes, but it was of the style of vintage ""Flying Boxcars"" - no central fuselage back to the tail, but two skinny supports. It was clearly flying a grid search pattern, I guessed it was a smoke spotter? After about 20 minutes or so, they disappeared."
6740999,Skywagon,2023-05-26 05:00:00,1106,"It was a Cessna bird dog (front and rear engine), they were used extensively in Viet Nam, the bird dog is used here as fire spotters. The main base for the fire spotters is at Dryden where there is a maintenance facility, from here they send mechanics and birds out to different areas of Ontario in the summer. I am surprised you have not noticed them before, they fly continually here in fire season."
6741017,N_of_Quibell,2023-05-26 06:21:00,151,"Thanks for the lead. When I looked it up just now, I believe it was a Cessna O-2 Skymaster. Boy, the bush planes sure were busy last weekend!"
6741039,Skywagon,2023-05-26 08:01:00,1106,You identified the plane correctly! You were probably hearing/seeing a lot of aircraft out of Wilderness Air and possibly some from Clarks. I imagine a lot of walleye lost their lives last weekend.
6739471,Pooch,2023-05-18 07:17:00,4618,Isn't it kind of early for the Ontario fire season to be starting? Here in Central Illinois there are lot's of evening and morning high haze from fires north of the border. Pooch
6739475,wmd,2023-05-18 07:21:00,388,We had smoke roll in yesterday afternoon from wild fires in Alberta. The wind switched coming from the NW bringing in a cold front and the smoke. I am on the Missouri River by Mobridge. wmd
6739483,@Lunker,2023-05-18 07:56:00,835,"Once snow cover is off the ground, I would think any exposed vegetation is susceptible to fire at any time depending on how dry it's been."
6739499,Yellowfin123,2023-05-18 08:58:00,2182,"makes ya wonder do they burn fields and pasture ground in SE alberta and lower sasketchewan like they do in the midwest, timing seems right with about a month or so behind farther south around here"
6739521,NETim1187,2023-05-18 09:49:00,166,Lots and lots of smoke in the air this AM here in central Nebraska.
6739557,spoonchucker,2023-05-18 11:34:00,82,My lodge owner in Saskatchewan had to post pone fly in to camp because of fires and smoke. Don't know if they made it yet.
6739559,RichA$1970,2023-05-18 11:59:00,1159,Probably all the gun shot smoke from Chicago drifting down
6739563,Eckohlt,2023-05-18 12:18:00,3685,They shooting muzzle loaders now in Chicago?
6739573,prov1800,2023-05-18 13:28:00,5010,The smoke is mainly coming from Alberta and Saskatchewan we have 2 fires by red lake but small.Ground dried up fast here this spring.not much snow.not good for fire season.not to early they can happen anytime.some rain in our forecast so that will help here
6739583,Lmbkiller,2023-05-18 14:58:00,639,Given the right conditions fires can smolder underground all winter then fire rite back up in spring. Pun intended
