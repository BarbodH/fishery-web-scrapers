Brent and Kathie are keeping Evergreen Lodge so nice, they're excellent lodge owners and hosts. 6 of us made the adventure north, the roads were smooth but we did run into quite the line at the border. It took us a little over an hour to get through which was not bad considering. Most of our days we would spend time chasing Smallmouth and Northerns and at night we would switch over to targeting Walleye. It was hard to leave the very cooperative and hungry fish each night so we spent 10-12hours on the lake each day it seemed. We had our best luck in 4-8FOW for waleyes, 1/8-1/4 jighead and minnow was the best producer. They were biting light a lot of days and this set up seemed to outfish leeches or jigs with plastics. Biggest walleye was 26"" and we caught 4 of them. The Northerns were all very thick and were hanging in or around feeder creeks and shallow muddy bays. Top producer was 4-5"" soft swimbaits in chartreuse, the storm GT360. On Sunday I caught a 39.5"" Northern weighing in at 18.2lbs! I caught 3 over 10lbs on this day. My brother and boat mate caught is PB at 41"" 16.12lbs and my Nephew caught his PB 35.5 10.8lbs. My buddy on the other boat also boated a 41"" 14.75lb PB- great trip for quality and quanity of Northerns! We had a handful of spots that were putting out so many Smallies, I know most of you guys don't like them but I LOVE them. It's such an untapped resource right now it seems. My best 5 on the last day went 18lbs and my biggest of the trip was 4.2lbs. So many 3 pounders to be caught. Firetiger and craw color crankbaits, 3"" swimbaits and texas rigged tubes were the main producers! Our Group caught 888 total fish! 431 Walleyes, 107 Smallmouths, 217 Northerns, 26 Perch and 1 Whitefish!"
