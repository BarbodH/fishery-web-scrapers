549656,wooglin,2005-06-23 07:22:00,371,"I will be leaving for Sioux Lookout tomorrow at 0600, 6/24. Seven of us targeting walleye/pike and the occasional musky and small mouth. We are staying at Country Camping, www.countrycamping.net and will mainly fish out of Hudson and maybe Deception Landing. I will post a report when I return. Wish us luck!"
549658,JohnAB,2005-06-23 07:55:00,49,"Good luck wooglin. Hopefully you have a safe and bountiful trip! I leave at 1430 hours on June 28 for Sioux Lookout. Plan to fish around Sioux for 4 or so days, then fly out for 21 or 22 days at the cabin on Kawaweogama for some awesome walleye fishing. Know August 2 will come all to soon as that will be my first day back at work."
549660,wooglin,2005-06-23 08:13:00,371,"JohnAB, Thanks man, we can't wait. Sitting at work today is KILLING me. PS, thanks for raining on my parade man - your trip sounds AWESOME! I wish I could take that much vacation. Enjoy! :)"
549662,Guest,2005-06-23 08:27:00,0,"I am leaving for Kawaweogama exactly 720 hours from right now. Can somebody tell me how to keep my job between now and then - Canada is all I can think about. JohnAB, we'll be fishing the afternoon of the 24th - we'll stop by to see how the fishing has been."
549663,Guest,2005-06-23 08:33:00,0,"JohnAB, I've considered taking the train from Winnipeg to Allanwater, and paddling/fishing/camping Kawaweogama for what seems like years. Never got around to it though. If you could fill me in on some basic details, it'd be great. What's the general type of shoreline over the majority of the lake (high/low rock; low sloping clay, reeds, mud; broken rock and sand; etc.)? Are there many beaches? The dream trip, of course, is to head into Seseganaga; how many portages are necessary? I assume that some must exist? I believe that Seseganaga flows INTO Kawaweogama, so no free ride into the former, I guess? Is Seseganaga generally similar to Kawaweogama? Anyway, any info you'd care to share would be most useful. It looks like one could easily paddle and fish all the arms for weeks. Thanks!!"
549686,wooglin,2005-06-24 04:11:00,371,"30 minutes people! ha, just wanted to post that, so that when I get home and read it, I'll be depressed and have to wait another full year to go."
549694,JohnAB,2005-06-24 07:46:00,49,"Canoeist, I have been to my wife's family cabin on Star Island a grand total of one time which was last year. I will get the wife to respond to your email with all the particulars on getting into the other lake etc as she was born and raised there and knows the area extremely well. GaryL, will see you on the 24th. Not promising you a cold one but will try and ration the beverages so I have some left for that day! LOL After 20 days out there, rations may be a bit low, especially if it has been hot out. Mind you, I can always get the pilot to fly out, on a mission of mercy, some more bubblies for then!"
549739,Guest,2005-06-26 00:35:00,0,Hi this is Mary.. Johns wife..I understand your heading out for a canoe trip. Awesome..Where can I start to tell you about this area. There is so much to tell.. If your taking a train. I guess you know it only runs so many times a week and you would be getting off the train fairly late at nite into Allanwater..Two things you can do. One is get off at Allanwater BRIDGE from there you can walk through the bush to get to ABOVE the rapids to get to Kawaweogama Lake. Or you can put in below the rapids and navigate up.( but I really dont think you would want to attemp this in the dark. .Or get off the train at Allanwater STATION. From there is a trail to an old gov dock. Not a far walk providing the train crew puts you off at the right spot..this way you wont have to run any rapids to get onto Kawaweogama lake . Another way is to get off Alllanwter Bridge and go up McQwen River from there are portages. The best way to show you would be a map. as it hard to place these spots for you..I do know that most of the canoest do use the Mcqwen Portages to get to Kawaweogama Lake There is canoe outfitters across the lake from where we are. As for the lakes..LOL I cannot stress how rocky Kawaweogama Lake is..in fact my grandmother told me that is why it is called what it is. It means round lake with lots of rocks..as for beaches. yes there are beaches in both Kawaweogama and Seseanaga.Lots of muskegs and rocky shorelines. Many islands. Very very pretty scenery all along the way. Now that river that goes into into Seseganaga from Kawaweogama is a awesome beautiful run.. but there are main portages for sure..Trout Rapids and Frog Rapids These CANNOT be run. You HAVE to portage..Down at the far end of Sesegaga is some really good lake trout fishing as well as some Indian paintings on rocks. Our custom is to leave tobacco at this site for respect.. I wish you well on this trip.. flies will be bad so be prepared..Lots of rocks so have patching for your canoe as well. what kind of canoe are you using..anyone going with you? I really need a map to show you the routes etc..do you have a map you can fax to me..(780)795-3965 Attn Mary & John that way I can mark it out for you and and some of the points of interest.. I think there is some information on canoe routes as well. Probably with Parks Canada. Be sure to stop in and visit us at Star Island. Tea pot will be on.
549743,Guest,2005-06-26 07:31:00,0,"Thanks very much Mary!! You're right about the train times being less than ideal, and I think that it heads back west ~0730; it's the old ""sleep in the train station"" trick, I guess. Thought I left that behind me in my earlier years. Is there actually a station building with an enclosed waiting area, or is it just a siding with a sign saying, ""Allanwater""? Sounds like the Station to the Gov. dock is perhaps the best ""no muss-no fuss"" option. I guess that Trout and Frog Rapids are the two portages I remember from a map I saw a few years back. Is the river current coming from Seseganaga a non-factor other than these two rapids area? Are the two portages in good shape, with decent landings and launches? Short, or long (there's no medium, is there?)? :) Do you know the name of the Canoe Outfitter across the lake; I might be able to get route maps from them? I'll either go in alone in my Wenonah solo, this year or next, or in an Old Town tandem with my daughter's boyfriend (who recently told my daughter he ""wanted to go on a wilderness canoe trip with (her) Dad""). The risk here is twofold: he may hate it, and run for the hills, for which my daughter will blame me forever; or he'll love it, and try to take my daughter canoeing again, for which I will be punished forever. Either way, I might just be a dead duck. :) :) If this year, I might go in alone late-August/early-September; I guess the weather starts to get a bit chilly at night, but fewer bugs, I guess? That's the problem with fall fishing; it's great from a cabin, but a different kettle of fish when doing the minimalist canoe thing. If you've an e-mail address you'd wish to share, I could scan map sections that I locate and e-mail them to you for ""marking,"" as well as take the discussion off Walleye Central. Or perhaps I could just mail a couple of photocopies of sections of the 1:50,000 maps? Probably easier. I appreciate your help very much, but didn't ask yet about the fishing! Just kidding, I'm sure it's worth the trip overall, and no doubt the run into Seseganaga as well; it sure has a heck of a lot of shoreline! Is Star Island close to the bridge? Thanks again, for your kind assistance!!"
549798,Guest,2005-06-27 12:26:00,0,Thanks very much Mary; I'll be in touch via e-mail. Have a great trip!
549806,Guest,2005-06-27 16:12:00,0,Yes we will Im sure have a geat trip..a bit concerned about the weather though. Talked to my mom again this morning and they are sure having some brutal wind storms and hail every other day..Hope our cabin is still there. Well if I dont hear from you in 20:00 hours ( CN talk lol ) will have to catch ya when I get back.. remember..no internet out at Star Island. Mary
549773,Guest,2005-06-27 00:14:00,0,Hi again I dont know if I can be of much help to you here now as were leaving day after tomorrow. But will answer as many of your questions as I can. Train station : there really isnt a train station there anymore. Just a sign and an old broken down building with no doors or windows left in it..sad...the other thing is with the trains now is... gone are the days when we could just flag the train down. now one has to have reservation and all..geesh sure doesnt do much for the few people that still travel by train. I remember very well as kid waiting and wating for that passenger train with my parents..( train was late ) and I was drinking orange juice from a Donald Duck can. The train went right by..never stopped..that was just one of my many train trips. My dad and brothers all worked for CN. One brother is ready for early retirement come November. any ways back to the topic here. The gov dock is a good place to launch.. but even with going up the McEwen River and making one really short portage ( so short you can see the other side) you can access Kawaweogma quite easily. I wish I remembered the name of that canoe outfitter but I dont. I looked in my books and dont have it. but they are only there a few times each summer. They have a camp and take kids that are troubled on canoe trips. Yes the bugs will be bad but then that is norhern ontario. and with all this rain we had this year. I know I wouldnt hesitate to take along one of those little screen tents. It would be great for eating in and a nice break from the bugs and there are so many on the market now. They even have some that just open and pop up. Not heavy at all. That is just one of my ideas. I love the outdoors and all but I guess that would be my one luxury now a days. A nice 8x8 screen tent A nice dry place to store gear and fire wood. On the topic of bugs. My friend eamiled me to tell me that Vicks works very very well at keeping the bugs at bay..Now I have to to out and buy a jar of this stuff and try it.. I found just part a map of our lake and will try to enlarge it and send it on to you but will need a fax number if possible. Unfortunatly this one doesnt show Sesegana Lake..One good thing with the water so high the rive will be a cinch to run. I was told last summer that that portage on this river are still there below those two big rapids. Star Island is about 5- 6 miles out on the lake from Allanwater Bridge. I hope your trip works out for you and you can go. Try to find someone to go with you. I guess im not one for trying an adventure on my own. Its nice to have company and nice to have help when you need it.. Fishing is good in both lakes.. My email addy is [email protected]
