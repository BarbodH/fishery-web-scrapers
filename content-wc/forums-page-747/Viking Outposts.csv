549741,bugsy,2005-06-26 06:46:00,49,"Huffman, Sorry, I meant the portage lake to the WEST. Believe it's referred to as the Annex on their website map. Flooded Lake looks interesting also, but with a fairly long portage. Thanks, again! Bugsy."

The biggest pike was 46 incheslong caught and cuaght by my son at the mouth of the river that runs into Orono, but most pike lots smaller 24-30 inch range. For walleye just fish any reef on long point. For the pike, besides the river, look for downed trees that in are in some water with a little depth, walleyes will be there too."
