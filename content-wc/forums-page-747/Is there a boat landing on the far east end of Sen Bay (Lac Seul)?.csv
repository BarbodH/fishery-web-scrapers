Wondering if the road leads to a boat landing? I thought I read on this message board that there is some kind of a landing back there. Thanks.

Not a formalized landing but can be done without too much problem. Here are the rough directions: To get to Sen Bay you follow Highway 516 (to Savant Lake) for approximately 20 km and turn on to the Vermilion River Road. You proceed approximately 3 km along this road and turn left onto the road that goes to where you fished last year. There are no other direct access options to Sen Bay, all other places to launch a boat that give you access to Sen Bay all require you to navigate a portion of Lac Seul before you get to Sen Bay. For this you would need to purchase a map for navigation purposes and could require anywhere from a 1/2 hour to an hour of boating to reach Sen Bay depending on the size of your boat and motor. Hope this helps."
