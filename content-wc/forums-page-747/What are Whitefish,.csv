549782,Trailerguy,2005-06-27 09:00:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Lake Whitefish inhabit the Great Lakes and deep cold watered inland lakes across Ontario. They typically grow up to 26"" long and smaller ones may be confused with Cisco's. The upper jaw of a Whitefish protrudes over it's mouth, which is small. They have somewhat large scales and are thinner and flatter than a Walleye, but are excellent eating. Because of their small mouth, a small spoon or small hook and minnow, is required to catch them. Like Lake trout they spend warm weather in deep water, coming to the top layer in the fall as the water cools, to spawn in the same areas that Walleye use in the spring. They spawn at night and feed heavily in the daytime, which makes them easy to net in the absence of other species. They move throughout the lake in winter and return to the spawning beds in early spring to feed voraciously on Walleye and Northern Pike spawn before the warming water forces them to the deep water again. Walleye fishermen catch a few in the spring, but in the summer you need a still day, and a small hook in deep water to catch them. 5 day until I'll be fish'in on Wabby"

As I write this, the mayfly hatch has begun, and the whitefish have moved into bays, and my end of the lake to feed heavily on them. In the evening when it is quiet you will see them hitting the surface to feed. Fly fishing is a great way to pursue them this time of year. If you are not into fly fishing, you can do the same thing by using a mayfly fly, and attach a float for weight. Throw it out and let it sit. As trailerguy mentioned, whitefish is a great fish to eat, and if you catch some they are well worth cleaning and having for dinner. All the best, Agate"
