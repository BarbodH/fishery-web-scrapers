549664,Guest,2005-06-23 08:57:00,0,"thunderstick, i believe you are about to depart for your week at o'sullivan? i am envious. we had another great week ourselves 11 - 18 june. the first 4 days however were 90 degrees plus and we went swimming every day.......and we don't go there to swim. the fishing was still great even w/the hot temps. we tried some of your recommended locations, e.g., outflow from candy lake to no avail, but it was fun none the less. also, we never had the easterly blow to try the sand bar on the upper northwestern shore, but there is always next year. anyway, have a great trip and say hello to russell, ruby, helen, wilson, bill!!"
549685,Guest,2005-06-24 00:56:00,0,Hope you left a few. Our week begins on July 2. How was the Clova Rd? Did you manage to get to Clatouche? Any big ones? We're ready to roll. Thanks for the report.
549704,Guest,2005-06-24 10:26:00,0,"t-stick, actually we didn't get up to clatouche at all and i really wanted to. we had four of our own boats, 2 to big to go up, so we simply hit the main lake all week. next year we will spend some time up there. the clova was the worst its been in years on the way in (3.5 hours towing our own boats). one trailer lost both fenders and both tail lights, although that is somewhat standard. if you remember the former guides gaston and mike, they visited one day (they are brothers-in-law now), we hadn't seen them in approximately 10 years and it was obviously good to reunite. anyway, gaston even remarked about the clova, and he said when it is so hot and dry the fine sands get bumped, blown off the road making the washboard even worse. it was interesting to hear that answer. anyway, our week concluded with some great heavy rains (we love fishing in that weather)and the road seemed much better on the way out. also, they may have graded some during our week as well. have a great trip. hope you don't have the heat we did......"
549706,Guest,2005-06-24 10:39:00,0,"oh the big ones were; walleye 2 - 24-inch, and pike 1 - 15 lber. caught the pike in the southern basin right in front of the center island as your heading for the narrows. a northerly blow was pounding that island, we stopped, i picked up an eye and then mr. big bit my jig. i thought i was snagged so i throw it in reverse and start trying to follow my line directly into the wind. well, were making ground and i ask andy, ""why is my drag singing when i'm moving toward my line"".........:-) well, it wasn't a snag. andy took the helm and we followed that hog around for about 10 minutes with my ultra-light rig and 6lb test. it was a blast, and he was released to fight another day. i love o'sullivan."
549714,Guest,2005-06-24 15:53:00,0,"Sounds like you guys had a typical (outstanding) week at OSLL. I haven't seen Gaston in a long time. I still can picture him walking out of the guide shack, always with a Bleu in his hand. We depart on Friday night and can't wait. Maybe we should cool the talk about this great lake and keep the secret to ourselves. A report will follow."
549715,Guest,2005-06-24 16:00:00,0,have good fishing and good travels.
549728,JBfishdog,2005-06-25 14:32:00,9,"If I can Budge into your conversation, We did get into Clatouche. First time in probably caught 40 + pike most 24"" or less, one 36"". Second time in, my partner caught his thumb and we had to go back and let Russell pull it out. Good news for you Thunderstick, Russell got some practice extracting hooks; that was the second one of the week for the same guy. Biggest pike and Walleye in our group came from Armitier 43"" pike 29"" Walleye both released. Bigget walleye I heard in the camp was a 31"" from cabin 5 also released, it was caught in the North End of the Main lake not sure where though. Bruce it was good talking with you up there, you have a great group of guys. Maybe we will se you again in a few years , I like to check and learn some new water then get back to a few favorite lakes every 3rd or 4th trip. Clova road for us wasn't to bad 1:45, 40 MPH the first half and the second half had just been graded and that was a quite a bit faster. That was Saturday the 18th. JOHN"
549830,Guest,2005-06-28 07:02:00,0,"T-Stick: Yes, we had a blast and the Pike Bruce hooked was the biggest I've ever seen up there. The hot weather was stupefying (spelling?) this year--leaving us in a fog for the first four days, but it cooled after that. canada weather is always a crapshoot, I guess. Henceforth, we need a code for the Lake like OSLL to keep the crowds out. Also, we got stopped in the Southern basin by Quebec Conservation Officers--they had come in the road in their truck and used one of the Lodge boats. They ticketed us for not having our licenses with us--we had bought them day one but kept them in the cabin because I didn't want to get it wet--186 bucks Canadian for not having a license that cost 54 US. They seemed to enjoy it. I told Russell I was responsible but that he ought to sell those little license holders with the paper. Have a great trip and hit 'em hard"
549841,Guest,2005-06-28 10:24:00,0,"I'm surprised they ticketed you, they're usually so friendly and I love their sense of humor. Did you at least offer them a Bleu?"
