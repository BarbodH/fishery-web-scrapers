549712,Guest,2005-06-24 14:28:00,0,"I couldn't agree more. The first year I went up north, I broke my leg very badly and had to fly home for surgery. The ""hospital"" at Kenora is great at removing hooks, but they can't handle a compound fracture. What an ordeal. I have been every year since and I look forward to going back as soon as I get home. To me it's about leaving all the bs at home and fishing/catching up with my brother and uncles."
549716,rebelrn2001,2005-06-24 16:02:00,1563,I want more than a hug...that's why I take my wife.
549717,rebelrn2001,2005-06-24 16:08:00,1563,I'd like to ask WHERE you went? I have been going to Canada for the past 6 years (same place) and have yet to catch 50-75 fish per day and I STILL LOOK FORWARD TO IT EACH YEAR.
549724,Guest,2005-06-25 13:15:00,0,"Gotta agree with the above posts. Usually great fishing, spending time with family, forgetting about reality for a week, and the new stories each year. This years story, which has been and will be retold many times, involves my brother standing a foot away from a bear half way through the screen door. I have to air my one complaint though from our trip to Lac Seul this year. We were bombared my many inconsiderate boaters. We'd be trolling an area and boats would just come and anchor on both sides of us. We'd move, then the same thing would happen. Two days straight, we'd be fishing, people would barge in, we'd move, then the same two boats followed us and anchored on both sides of us. We like to move around, explore and find new spots, but that was vary irratating and rude. With thousands of spots to fish, why do poeple do that? (I can probably answer my own question) Sorry for the rant, but I had to get that off my chest. It really stressed part of our vacation that we look forward to all year."
549725,Guest,2005-06-25 13:56:00,0,"CodpieceXL, I want to pick up on your comments. A couple questions . . . Did you speak to the people in these boats after the first few instances? How close were they? Were they locals or not? (You can usually tell by the boat or boat#) Were they guided or not? (This is particularly interesting if they were guided) Were both them and you catching fish? When you moved to a different spot, was it other places with the same pattern or a different fishing pattern? What part of Lac Seul were you on? (I am particularly interested in this one) If you could answer these here, or even better answer and copy the details and your opinions in a new topic and post it so it can be debated. It should draw some decent interest and debate. Thank You NWO Fishing Bum"
549678,Guest,2005-06-23 19:42:00,0,perhaps i went to the wrong place walleye 10-14 in lake trout 22in northern 18-30 1n lots fish 50 to 75 a day per person was disapointed in the quailty of fish as my bro-in-law says i want to catch fish i can't catch in mo. we had a good time lots fun after we adapted to the country. saw lot of game caught lots fish brought home limits. so what am i upset about. i think the resort owner led us astray about the quality of fishing he was going on the quanity of fish. i have a bad knee and rotar cuff and told him that before we left. first day . go get that 9.9 merc and gas tank put in your truck \your going to XXXXXXlake. that motor and tank weighs more than i do. F____U{{{{ we spent most of the week fishing out in front of camp on lake in front of camp sorry i am so bitter but i had never been there and had heard lots stories about the wounderful hospitality and great fishing. you guys a canada treated me well but i will take a seconed thought before i come back pedad
549681,Guest,2005-06-23 21:53:00,0,"50-75 fish per day? Sounds like a pretty good trip to me. It sounds trite, but as far as big fish go; thats why they call it fishing and not catching. If you are having trouble catching big fish- change what you are doing. No offense brother but, I am having a hard time feeling bad for you. Poke"
549687,Hawker,2005-06-24 04:54:00,3967,"I gotta agree with Poke, I'm having a pretty hard time feeling bad for you. Canada is a very large country with more lakes than you can fish in two lifetimes. You went one time to one lake to one lodge caught lots of fish but not the fish of your dreams so now your badmouthing. Someone else was right, stay home in MO and fish. As for me, I'll keep on making the trips up there year after year as long as I'm able from Oklahoma and love every minute of it and all I'll bring back from there are good pics and great memories. Have fun in MO! Hawker"
549688,Trailerguy,2005-06-24 05:43:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Some years back when I was still going to a resort, I remember a party that brought along a fellow with his leg in a fresh cast and crutches. They tried to drag him along to remote lakes and the guy couldn't even set in a boat for more than a couple of hours comfortably. By the end of the week they were all complaining about not catching fish, and blaming the resort owner. We fished some of the same lakes and did fine. Perhaps if you had brought up your infirmaties in your initial contact, instead of when you arrived in camp, he'd have recomended another resort that fishes on larger water, like LOTW or Lac Suel, where you wouldn't have to lug the gear. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
549692,Guest,2005-06-24 07:14:00,0,Tell your brother in law to go deep sea fishing if he wants to catch fish he can't catch in MO. As far as the camp owner leading you astray well I bought a used car once that wasn't quite as nice as the salesman said it would be. If you hit this forum at all you see plenty of guys checking out camps and asking questions BEFORE they book a date. If you had a good time like you say write it off a nice vacation and next year save the $$$$ and fish in your home state. Lake of the Ozark is beautiful this time of year and there is hardly any boat traffic. At least that is what the resort owner said when I talked to him.
549693,Guest,2005-06-24 07:35:00,0,I went to Canada and didnt catch the fish of my dreams. I went to Canada and didnt catch enough fish every day. I went to Canada and didnt have any fun. I went to Canada and the outfitter didnt bait my hook. I went to Canada and nobody gave me a hug.
549696,Mike Kansas,2005-06-24 08:20:00,1463,"Sorry to hear it every time someone has a trip to Canada that didnt meet their expectations. Others who are thinking of going to Canada for the first time or those of us who try different Resorts need to make sure that they do proper research. Lodge Owners like all business men believe that they can meet the needs of the sportsman. However each of us has our own special needs and in order to meet them you need to talk to the Lodge Owner and his past customers and you must ask the proper questions. One method of inquirey that works the best for us is to get the names of the people who have stayed at the Resort during the same weeks in the past that you want to go. This means that you are not talking to the owners buddys but instead may be talking to someone who can share an unbiased opinion with you. Also WC is a great source for finding information about what you can expect at a resort. This year is my 50th anniversary year for fishing in Canada. My first trip was in 1955 at the age of 10. My Father took me the first time and even though I havent gone every year since than there have been many years when I have gone two, three or four times to multiple resorts. I guess I have been in Canada fishing on 80 or more trips for a week at a time. I have only had a couple of times that the accomadations or fishing wasnt up to my expectations....but I still had a good time. Canada Fishing is a great experience and a wonderful way to spend time with loved ones and friends. It is what you make of it and for me and many others on WC it is our annual dream and helps shorten our winters. THANK GOD FOR CANADA and all those Resort Owners who give us the trips that build memories that last a lifetime.."
549697,AL,2005-06-24 08:24:00,89,I got a hug in Canada this year!
549698,Frankm,2005-06-24 08:38:00,154,"Like others said you need to do your research. I've been going for 11 years straight. My grandpa went since 1954. We've become good friends with the owner. Cabins are dated but clean. I look forward to going all year. You still have to fish. Some years are better than others. Alot of newbies expect the fish to jump in the boat. To me the trip is the whole package. Relaxing with family and friends. The laughs at the kitchen table. The taste of the fresh fish. The smell of the air. The scenery. Not thinking about work, bills, wives, etc. To me the fishing is a bonus. Last year we nailed the big Pike. We caught several 37-40"" one after the another. This year we only caught a couple bigger Pike. Most of all about the trip is the stories. There is always something unplanned unique event that happens. Oh yeah that was the year with all the big pike, or the year so so caught his big Walleye, or the year we saw the Bear in the tree, and the 38"" Pike on jig, the guys from cabin 3 catching 12 dogfish off the dock. I could go on and on. Lots of great memories."
549711,Guest,2005-06-24 13:57:00,0,"If I would have let my first experience to Canada be the guide post for all other trips I should have never gone back. Not what I expected either. But I am glad or I would not have seen the anguish on my uncle's face at the beginning of the week for having to throw back a 24 inch walleye. Nor would I have seen the great joy he had in releasing a 30 incher at the end of the week. We only caught 30 or so fish all week, but who could expect only 4 of them to be under 23 inches?"
