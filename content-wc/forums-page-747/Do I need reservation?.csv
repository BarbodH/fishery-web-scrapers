549765,dutchboy,2005-06-26 19:01:00,5717,I'm thinking of just driving up for a few day's to get away. Possibly the Kenora area. Do you think I'll need reservations or is there a chance I'll find a motel room? I know most of the resorts will be full but I don't have to have a resort. Thanks for your help.

I'm not sure on the status of all the places, and certainly much of the rest of the year I would say no, you could probably find something without a reservation, BUT if you're considering it for this weekend, I would call ahead and make sure."

Not all camps are likely to be full either, I know several in the Perrault Falls area that likely would have openings. 5 days until I'll be fish'in on Wabby"
