549751,Wisconeye,2005-06-26 13:57:00,79,"We got back late last night from Ogoki Reservoir with Mattice Lake Outfitters. Fishing was different than the last few years but still fantastic. The reservoir was at normal water levels rather than the higher water of the past few years. About 60 miles from the Nipigon fire which I heard was 125 sq/km. We could see the smoke plumes for days. Also heard of bad weather at LOTW, Kenora, Dryden and Vermillion Bay on Thursday. We had some lightning and thunder and some wind but not the 126 km/hr reported on LOTW. Hopefully no one was hurt, just got bits and pieces of the news. Next year we are going to consider a smallmouth trip. Any suggestions. Looking for a fly-in known for quality smallmouth and some walleyes and northerns, but the target will be large smallmouth. Any help from anyone would be appreciated. Only another year or so to get ready, got to start soon! Thanks"

It's a good sized body of water with some beautiful smallies, the only thing is there are not any walleyes. There are northern & lakers to chase instead. We had a great trip there and would recommend it. www.lmflyin.com Hope you find what you're looking for."
549767,Guest,2005-06-26 19:55:00,0,A great smallmouth and musky fly-in lake would be Kishkutena just outside of Nester Falls. Tinkers place has a nice cabin on that lake.....unbelievable smallmouth (some largemouth) and musky fishing...no walleye though. Another great fly in for smallmouth is Rex Lake up by Minaki.....you could contact River air but it's not easy to get into that lake without booking well in advance.

What depth did you have the most success in? Any BIG ones (walleye or pike)? Was it as snaggy as I've heard? Thanks in advance for any information!!!"
549805,Wisconeye,2005-06-27 15:06:00,79,"I had good luck using Berkely Gulp 3"" Twister. The color of the week was white tail, red jig head. Others had success on chartreuse. Minnows seemed to work well. It is snaggy and I would recommend 3/8 to 1/2 oz. jigs, and 14 lb. fire line so you can straighten out the hooks on jigs rather than break off. 14 lb. fireline is a small diameter so jigging this heavier jig works well. You should be able to bend the hooks back and sharpen them a bit and get right back into them. 10-15 ft of water in the morning and evening. During the day the weeds and weedline edges with a suspending crankbait produced walleyes and northerns. Trolling jointed Rapala's produced walleye and northern as well as trolling silver minnows or casting silver minnows right into the weeds. A set up that will also work good for those larger northerns in the weeds is a medium jawbreaker spoon. Jerk it across the top foot of water and hang on. One northern about 15 lbs and a few walleyes in the 7 lb range. The water is at a normal level."

549845,Guest,2005-06-28 10:50:00,0,I just returned from Georgian Bay Fishing Camp (A boat in lodge some 18 mi out in the Bay at the mouth of the French River--about 4 hrs north of Toronto just north of Parry Sound)) and we caught(by accident) some of the biggest smallies I've ever seen. 3 were at least 5 lbs and others were nice as well. The season there opens the last Sat in June. I only shudder to think how many nice ones we'd catch if we were actually targeting them. There are literally thousands of shoals/dropoffs that are prime smallie hangouts. End June-early july would be ideal time there I think. Let me know if you want/need more info.
