Although it is early, we'd appreciate any assistance, tips, or information that anyone would be willing to share - primarily fishing reports. We are interested in fishing Minnitaki, Pelican, and/or Lac Seul - numbers are important, size is important... whatever information you would share/can give would be appreciated as we get closer to that date. Thank you."

549738,Guest,2005-06-25 23:33:00,0,Thank you for the information. Please post when you return... we leave on August 9th. Is that before you go or after?
