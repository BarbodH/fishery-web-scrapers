Best day was when we went to Sen Bay. Good numbers and nice size. Fish were still in shallow by the sand and weeds. Tried the reefs up there but not a lot of luck. Crawlers and leeches were the main bait. Fished the island on Abrams one evening and did ok. Fished by the chute for about an hour and pulled fish from there also. We never fish Minitaki but heard that the fish were biting on the Rice River. One of these years we will venture into Minitaki. Have a good trip. Water temps were about 68 degrees. Take care, Otts"
