549719,rockpt,2005-06-24 22:18:00,589,"Except for the NW Angle, the US side is open, big water. Canadian side is the typical shield experience with more structure. Need a bigger boat to fish out of Baudette, and if you're a muskie guy you will fish out of the Angle or one of the Canadian ports, eh?"
