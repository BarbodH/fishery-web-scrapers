549588,tly,2005-06-21 20:05:00,1900,"We keep spreadsheets of each year of ALL expenses. Divide by persons, conver currency and we average $750-850 USD FOR EVERTHING. We go to Chamberlain Narrows. We stay at motel before going out, eat well on way up/back. Some of us are retired so a buck means something but we feel we get value for what we spend. You never know when the last trip will be. (I am part of another gtoup that is now down to 3!!!) Do what you can live with, do not over extend so the trip becomes a lingering nightmare. TLY"
549589,Guest,2005-06-21 20:32:00,0,"We were just on LacSuel last week (Houseboat) and fished the NE corner (Wapesi and Birch Narrows) and then spent a day in Sen Bay area. Our largest fish was just over 29"" with several others in the 26-27"" range. Numbers were down a bit over last year but, it is the best place in the country to ""eyes"". I have done this trip now for 15 years and still get excited... We had leeches, worms and salted minnows and they all worked good with a bright colored jig. Can't wait till next year......"
549795,Guest,2005-06-27 11:53:00,0,Just returned from fishing SE section of Lac Seul out of Hudson/Lost Lake area. Weather and fishing were fantastic. Water temps in high 60's to low 70's in smaller bays. Leeches and crawlers proved best for walleyes as we boated about 400 walleyes during the weeklong stay. Fished mostly with jigs and slip bobbers. Did some trolling with spinner blades and harnesses. Many fish in the 22-25 inch range although we did get two 27 inch walleyes. Found fish in shallow water (7-11 feet) but had indications later in the week that fish were heading out to deeper waters. Can't beat Lac Seul (anywhere you fish)! It continues to be one of the best walleye lakes anywhere. Can't wait until next year!!!
549810,Guest,2005-06-27 17:31:00,0,"Lac Seul is a great lake, no question about it. Like all good things there are variety of resorts on the lake. Each has its own unique characteristics and charms. If somebody favors one by going to it, lets not run a place down or insuate that ""real men don't go there."" I have gone to SWWL a number of times, taking my children with me and they and I have had a blast and been treated terrifically. Are there other great resorts on the lake, you bet. SWWL has carved out its own niche and its a hard camp to get into, so they must be doing something right. Like everything in life, its not for everybody and that is OK. We fished LS June 13 - 20 and had a great time. Biggest walleye in the boat that week was just a bit over 29"" The fish seemed just a bit more scattered than other years, but it was still no problem to have a great day on the water. We book again for for 2006 before we left. Now I just have to wait 11 months and 9 days, but who is counting Not saying one thing bad about any resort, especially those I have never been to. Enough said.....IA Walleye"
549503,Guest,2005-06-20 17:44:00,0,"Al, if I read SWW's website right, the rate per person for a week was over $1700.00 for 2 anglers per boat w/guide. How can an average working class individual justify paying this much money to catch fish? I love fishing and get out as often as possible but with a mortgage payment, 2 kids in college, plus everyday living expenses how does someone ""sell"" this vacation to the Mrs.? Are there other ""nice"" resorts on Lac Seul that offer clean cabins, good equipment, the proximity to the awesome fishing you had, and kind, caring staff who treat you like they WANT YOU TO COME BACK? without having to eat mac & cheese for the next 6 months to pay for the trip? Sounds like a great trip, maybe I'll just have to wait until the kids are thru college and treat myself then. Leave a few for me !! :-)"
549505,phishfearme,2005-06-20 18:04:00,1242,"spartan - let me suggest that for christmas and/or birthday, you ask everyone that gets you ""what you need"" to all throw in for ""what you want"". i'll bet it'll work and EVERYBODY will be happy! - phish"
549506,WIPP,2005-06-20 18:36:00,75,"I have heard that is a great place to go (SWW) but there are cheaper ways to fish Lac Seul. I have friends that camp near Sioux Lookout and boat in each day. If you don't need guides or someone to cook your meals for you there are resorts that are cheaper as well. Iam going back for the 5th year on my annual ""once in a lifetime"" trip (that is what my wife constantly reminds me that we called it the first year)."
549507,Guest,2005-06-20 19:34:00,0,"Fishing Lac Seul is actually very reasonable compared to a lot of other fishing trips. Going to Alaska will cost $3000-6000 plus airfare. Most saltwater trips are on the order of $400-500 a day. Even flyfishing in the lower 48 costs $2500-4000 for a week. If you are on a budget go to a place where you can bring/cook your own food. There is no need to hire a guide to catch fish on Lac Seul, I am sure the lodge staff can mark up a map and put you on fish. Although, I don't recommend it (unless you really know the lake) you can bring your own boat to avoid the cost of renting one from the camp. When we use to go to Kesagami we would tip the guides and staff with cartons of cigarettes (this was like gold to them), it is kind of risky these days since it seems that fewer people are hooked. Think about this if you can manage to save $33 a week for a whole year you should not have a problem going to SWW. Quit smoking and that will pay for the trip every year (that is if you smoke)."
549516,Guest,2005-06-20 21:24:00,0,"It costs you what? Holy Smoke. My entire trip comming up this next week is going to cost me approx $800, groceries, fuel for the drive and even some souveniers for the kids. The 4 of us will cook our own meals in well maintained and clean housekeeping cabins and includes 17' Lund Outfitters with all the electronics, 50 hp 4 strokes, 30 gal of gas and 30 dz minnows per man, all included. For $1700 they had better cook, do my laundry and supply the beer, maybe even remove the hooks from my catch. Everybody has there own idea of creature comforts and what they will pay for them (see Totem Lodge, Yellowbird). Our group wants a fishing camp, if I want some one to cook and clean for me I can stay home and listen to my wife complain."
549522,Guest,2005-06-21 04:24:00,0,"Our group doesn't need someone to cook the meals, we have always done a housekeeping plan, but we probably would consider a guide on new water especially to avoid water hazards so we don't ruin a motor. I don't smoke so no savings there."
549523,Brax,2005-06-21 05:38:00,52,"Spartan, I take my son to LS every year, this our 3rd year. (used to fish LOTW) We go to the earfalls area. I live in SE Wisconsin and drive up pulling my boat. The entire trip costs $1500 for the both of us, Door to Door. There are many good resorts in the area that are reasonably priced. We stayed at Goose Bay last year, nothing fancy but a great fishing camp. This year we will be a little farther south at Lac Seul Lodge. We leave on Friday, hope the weather and fish cooperate."
549576,Guest,2005-06-21 15:43:00,0,"I fished Lac Seul for 5 days this June. It was our 18th year. We have 6 guys and fish some of the same areas as the SWW. Our cost? $450 per person from my driveway to my driveway. We fished out of our own boats....much, much better than any lodge's...and cooked our own meals. We didn't, however, get a mint on our pillow."
549578,Guest,2005-06-21 15:53:00,0,"Heading up to Lac Seul today. Fishing out of Lost Island Lodge Thur-Sat, any tips??"
549580,Guest,2005-06-21 17:29:00,0,"Brax, I too would want to bring my son along which would mean $3400+ without gas & food on the way up & back and licenses. If there are other ""nice"" resorts in the area, how can SWW stay competitive with the other resorts, when SWW charges so much more? I'm glad others have posted about their experiences and advice on resorts, it gives me more options to experience the ""GREAT LAC SEUL FISHING"" that has so many of you guys ""fired up"" about your trips!! Thanks to all who posted with advice, now let's get back to reading more reports for the lucky anglers who are heading up there!!:-) Spartan Pride"
549441,Guest,2005-06-18 15:08:00,0,"Fished Lac Seul from the 13-16th. NW area, Ear Falls. Quite a few fish, but mostly very small. All caught in under 10 ft of water, minnows outperformed crawlers. Color did not matter much. Water temp around 60 degrees (Fahrenheit, obviously) Tried Sawmill Bay, Lunker Point, mouth of the Wenasage sanctuary, around Goose Island; nothing but 10-16 inch walleye. Our party had a couple 21-23 inchers, 1 26-28 incher that got off at the boat. A rather large pike took hold of a 14 incher at the boat and peeled off a lot of line for the excitement of the week. Ok fishing I guess. The locals were saying that they were all small this year. Bigger fish were in about 20 feet of water but harder to catch. I'd be interested to hear what the sizes are at the other end of Lac Seul, around Sioux?"
549443,Mike Kansas,2005-06-18 15:49:00,1463,"Got home today from 6 days on South Central part of Lac Seul. Have fished this area of lake for 19 years and this trip would have to considered below average for numbers of fish and size. Our group boated around 900 Walleye, 70 Smallmouth and scattered Pike. Walleye size was also down a little, 40% were slot and above but the biggest fish was only 27 1/2"". We did catch one nice Pike 41"". Had three bluebird days that slowed the fish down but still had a great time and love Lac Seul."
549449,Guest,2005-06-18 22:17:00,0,"we had about the same to report. we only got out one day on the big lake through pelican rapdids but picked up about 30 fish with two in and one over the slot. they were deep 20 to 25 feet. also hit a couple nice pike and lost a muskie as big as my 5 year old at the boat. i think the key was deep, slow, and bigger baits for crooked and manitou rapids as well as bear skin bay."
549451,tly,2005-06-19 05:09:00,1900,"Spent 6/11-6/16 in NE section, primarily Bear Narrows, Scaler Lake. Lots of fish of all sizes. Seem to have run larger than last year overall but largest was only 26"" altho a person from another group we know got a 33"". We continually had northern & an occasional muskie grab walleyes. One we netted cuz it just wouldn't let go. We used primarily salted frozen minnows (used salt/borax formula we picked up on WC earlier--Thanks guys!!) and generally some form of chartreus jig or spinner. Other colors worked but not quite as well. Depth seemed to make no difference except that larger fish seemed to be shallower and in the grass Weather was either hot/mugfgy or rain/wind/cold. Ready to go again. TLY"
549452,rebelrn2001,2005-06-19 06:26:00,1563,"We fished for the day last Monday w/my cousins and their group in Sunlight and then in the main lake for a while. It was cloudy/some rain and windy. Between our 4 boats we probably only caught 100 walleyes. Nothing much over 24"" either."
549458,Jackel,2005-06-19 18:01:00,2,"Hey guys new here today, I just had to jump in and provide a report on our trip last week. All I can say is the fishing was the best I have seen on the lake in years. Bring plenty of leeches and several ""Swim Wizz"". The past week by far produced more large walleye then any other lake. 90% of our catches ranged in the 20"" plus range with the top at 28 1/2"". Our 2 boats did catch several of the small fish, but so many hit the 24"" slot that it just seemed crazy. I netted prolly 50 fish over 22 inches. The fush were healthy and very colorfull....so pretty to haul in the boat. We actually had a hard time getting fish to fit under the 18"" slot to bring home, they were either waaay to small or way too big! Remember, we always turn the big girls Loose!! Let stay and bring home a few friers. Fish were on the move last week as they are moving from their spring time locations into the summer locations. Locations: McKenzie Bay, absolute great numbers of fish, work the points and also work the back water bays by the creeks. Our boats knocked the heck out of the big walleys casting for pike in the shallow water grasses. Serious, no bull...the big girls were layin in the shallow weeds and hitting the Swim Wizz like pike, not one of these fish were under 24 inches. The other main way for a great catch, work the rocks points, locate the fish and use a slip bobber with a leech. We had boats next to us practically cryin because they didn't have proper set ups to catch the fish. They were using bottom bouncers and spinners and the fish wanted a leech on a jig. Plain and simple, we nailed the eyes last week! Also, for first time visitors, get a guide, well worth the hundred bucks for the day. They will put you on fish, but not the big ones, they want to keep the big girls in the lake. Depends on the fisherman you are.... fishing more massive numbers below the slot, or fishing the numbers over the slot. A guide will reveal his secrets when he sees you throw the big girls back in the lake, if you don't throw the big girls back, don't expect much help in finding them! Good luck and don't sit in one spot too long, work the shore lines to find the fish. When you find them, you will find large numbers. Take a picture of the big girls and throw them back so they can produce millions of eggs the next spring!!!!"
549460,Guest,2005-06-19 19:31:00,0,"Hey tly(Tom)....good to see you made it up on Lac Seul this spring. My son and I were there the second week of opener. Our last day in, we caught 150 fish in less than four hours up at Scaler. Lot of smaller fish, but several in slot and over. I'm the guy you gave some location to about a year or two ago. Still work those areas you mentioned. Do you still use ""little cleo's""? We have got hooked on some bass assassin plastics that do a really good job, although jig and minnow is still my favorite. Good seeing your post...by the way, I live in MO. eyesnatcher"
549464,LUCKWI,2005-06-19 21:14:00,13,Fished Lac Seul near Mahkwa lodge on June 1oth thru 17th. Lots of fish with a great number at or over the slot. Fish seemed to be right at the weed edges in about 12 to 14 feet of water.Salted minnows on jigs with no rubber bodies did very well. Made the trip into vaughn lake on June 15th.Fishing was excellent 200 fish in our boat in 8 hours.Once again fish were near the weed edges. Caught several fish around the 25 inch range but an awful lot in the 13 to 15 inch size. Great trip Cant wait for next year
549469,tly,2005-06-20 06:17:00,1900,"Yup, still have a good supply of Cleo's altho this year the salted minnows were terrific. Maybe it's age or compassion, but I like treble hooks less and less. From the description I would guess you were at the 2nd bend below the Expanse Lake rapids just as it enters into Scalar. We saw lots of boats there but hit it during stormy times when smart people were sitting in front of the fire. Some of the spots from past years have changed due to higher water and the ice having rearranged habitat. Good to see you still make the trip. TLY"
549487,Guest,2005-06-20 13:45:00,0,"Four of us just got back from fishing Silver Water Wheel. Fishing was awesome. Had several fish in 28"" zone and many above slot. Most of our fish were caught in 6' to 10' of water on jig/minnow. People at Lodge treated us great and I plan on going back next year."
