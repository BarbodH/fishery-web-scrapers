However, on each trip had only one or two keepers (over slot), with all the rest in the slot. None were under slot. From conversation in camp this experience seems to be the norm. Wondering why not more over slot, and where are the under slot? Are lake trout native to the lake or are they stocked? Also, as an aside, why are there no walleye in Big Vermillon. Thanks much for any info. We are just curious."

The slot was put in place to protect the majority of the trout in the lake. One theory about small (under slot) lake trout is that they stay deep to avoid predation. The other theory is that the lake trout aren't reproducing very well in that lake. Why not more over slots?? Well, when the MNR put the slot in place it was designed to protect most of the fish. That lake isn't known for producing big big lakers. There are plenty of lakers over the slot up to about 30"" after that they are pretty rare. I know of a handful of upper 30-inch class fish caught but like I said, they are rare. Also, IMO, there really isn't a point in keeping an under slot lake trout anyways. They are so small there's not much meat there and I feel their value is in the lake, not on a plate."
