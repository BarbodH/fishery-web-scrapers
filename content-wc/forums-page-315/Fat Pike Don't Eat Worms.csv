I've always maintained that one works as well as the other, and I prove this to myself each trip when I start off using minnows then switch to crawlers and see no noticeable drop in production. However, I saw something last week that I thought was interesting. At Lac Seul Lodge, they have four ""pet"" northerns that live at the dock where they keep their cache of minnows. A couple of them are pretty good size - maybe 10 pounds. It's fun to watch the dock hands toss them a dead minnow and see the pike swarm like hungry piranha. The interesting part was one day I tossed a half a crawler to them. One of the larger pike went for the bait, but after that, they just watched the crawlers slowly sink right in front of their noses. It could be that pike just don't like crawlers that well. Or it could be that what these four fat pike are used to eating is minnows, so that's what their brain is programmed for. Or it could be that they're just spoiled and not too hungry, so they only eat their favorite."

2975969,Aaron-IN,2014-07-08 12:10:00,500,"Not sure if they like crawlers but they like Senkos, I've caught many pike and muskie using Senkos while smallmouth fishing."
2975977,MrSimon,2014-07-08 12:12:00,922,"Some monster pike have been caught pulling bouncers and crawler harnesses. But I agree, much much more research is certainly required."
2978209,UKBDM,2014-07-09 06:21:00,178,"I hate to be too serious but ... they are conditioned to eating the minnows. I'm pretty sure if they were hungry, the worms would be gobbled up as well."
2986265,Aspencreek,2014-07-11 10:32:00,2911,"The same thing goes on under the boathouse at Onaway. The pike and walleyes prefer the minnows, because they get fed them regularly. Enticing them with a couple fat juicy nightcrawlers was met with indignation. But....more research is needed to confirm the findings."
