Get the account is setup and you can add all the vehicles that will use the transponder on their web page. Once a vehicle that is on the account and has no transponder goes through the toll a video toll is created and the license plate is searched in their database and just charged the normal toll fee. This works great for groups traveling together and only one person has an ipass, no splitting up or waiting for each other because one has to stop and pay. Also if you are an ipass holder and get a toll violation notice don't panic at the $50 fine, one call to the helpline and they just charge the normal fee and void the violation. I have even had new vehicles not get entered into the system and got violations sent two minutes on the phone and all is taken care of, great customer service."
2987609,Guest,2014-07-11 20:11:00,0,"If you order the I-Pass online, it takes about 7 days to process the order. As mentioned before, you will pay $10 to lease the transponder. The other $40 goes into your escrow account. You will need to back up the escrow account with a credit card for replenishment. Once you have the rental vehicle, go to the website to add that vehicle using the 7 questions on the site. It takes 15 minutes to update following the entries. Since you are using it on a rental vehicle, do not take the plastic off the velcro strips on the back of the unit. Just keep it in the center console or glove compartment till you need it. Then just hold it up to the top of the windshield as you pass through the curved arch on the tollway. Besides, in summer when the windshield gets hot from the sunlight, the glue lets go and it winds up on the floor of the vehicle. When not in use, its out of sight from slippery fingers looking for a 5 finger discount."

2988121,NARDA 1,2014-07-12 07:10:00,636,The OP had questions about using the IPass system to pay tolls on the way to Canada.
2989081,Aspencreek,2014-07-12 16:16:00,2911,"You can register the transponder for your everyday vehicle and move it to any vehicle you want, just leave it sitting on the top of the dash. I have one registered for my wife's car and I use it in my car and my daughters use the same one for their cars when they ""have"" to make that shopping trip to Chicago. My son used it in his car when he drove to FLA this spring. It worked in every toll in FLA too."
2989193,Nimstug,2014-07-12 16:59:00,2605,Thanks for sharing the Florida info. We have occasion to travel around central Florida. Now I just need to remember to bring it...
3003162,Aspencreek,2014-07-16 14:44:00,2911,"So far the thing has worked at every toll road we have ever travelled, IL OH, IN and FL. At least I haven't gotten something in the mail telling me I owe, yet."

3003810,Bad Santa,2014-07-16 18:43:00,100,"This thing is both a money saver and a time saver. I live in WI, and my son played college football in IN. At first it took 4.5 hrs + to get to his home games. Once we got the I-PASS, the time went to 3.25 to 3.75 hrs, depending on Chi traffic."
3003874,IL-Rebel,2014-07-16 18:49:00,349,"Also works in West Virginia, but not in Kansas."
3005018,tooski,2014-07-17 07:14:00,393,"Thanks to all- here are the states it is valid for-- Current E-ZPass States: Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. They do require a license and vehicle ident but extra transponders are only a buck each so switching vehicles shouldn't be an issue. Thanks again, it will certainly cut time off the Ohio to International Falls journey."
2985249,Pezman38,2014-07-11 06:49:00,3196,"Illinois won't care if you don't have the plate information on your account. If you have the Ipass or EzPass it will deduct the fees automatically license plate or not.I have the Ipass and use it when traveling to Lake Erie each year, if the Ohio and Indiana roads could become more like Illinois that would be great. Slowing to 5mph to wait for the gate to go up is still a pain, but it is nice not fumbling for my wallet."
2985505,tooski,2014-07-11 07:58:00,393,"Pezman, I understand how the EZPass works in Ohio as my son has one. From your response I am guessing in Illinois you don't even have to pull over at the gates, it will pick up your module as you drive through normally?"
2985689,Pezman38,2014-07-11 08:30:00,3196,"That is correct you will drive right below them, I think you do slow down to 50."
2986337,Nimstug,2014-07-11 10:57:00,2605,The main tollway has lanes where you don't slow down. Where you get off the tollway to main arterial roads do not have gates but you are supposed to slow down to some speed I can't remember what it is because... never mind. The only toll gates are at the cash toll booth lanes.
2986465,Derrski,2014-07-11 12:07:00,6,"as others have said, YES get the iPass. It's worth the time savings and toll savings."
2986473,Hot Runr Guy,2014-07-11 12:12:00,16061,"Of course, trying to drag a 102"" wide trailer thru those lanes can cause a bit of a pucker,,,,,, HRG"

To sort of highjack this thread has anyone else seen the toll taker at the west bound O'Hare / Des Plaines toll booth whose other gig has to be as an Elvis impersonator. Got the black hair and big sideburns to match. My son and I will put away our transponders and pay the higher rate just to spot him. We only see him at night. We fully expect him to say. ""Thank you... thank you very much"" when we pay. Back to the thread in progress..."

2983497,tooski,2014-07-10 13:12:00,393,"Looking for advice on getting a ""Pass"" for the Chicago turnpike on the I-90 stretch. Usually I take the north of Superior route to western Ontario even though it is about 1/2 hour longer just to avoid the Chicago insanity. This year there were numerous bridges under repair and we got hit with 3 hours of 30 MPH type fog so I think I will bite the bullett for the vet trip in early August and do I-90. My question is - --- is it worth it to buy an easy pass or whatever they are called in Illinois? Thanks to anyone who has knowledge on the cost and wisdom of getting one....."
2983593,Hot Runr Guy,2014-07-10 13:38:00,16061,"I have one. There's a $10 deposit for the unit, then you put a certain amount of $$ in a re-chargeable account that the tolls get drawn from. I believe the non-electronic tolls are double the I-Pass ones, so it doesn't take a lot of trips to make it worth having. Plus, other states now accept the I-Pass, so it can be used in more than just Illinois. HRG do you have an E-Z Pass now? it will work in IL. http://www.illinoistollway.com/tolls...r-toll-systems"
2983993,NARDA 1,2014-07-10 15:32:00,636,"I90 is under construction from Elgin to Rockford, 45 mph all the way. Might want to look at a different route, maybe I80 to 39 north. 39 merges into I90 at Rockford where the construction ends. Another route would be I80 to 355 North to 88 West to 39 North."
2984033,new hips,2014-07-10 15:45:00,498,"Got mine last year, it was $40 total. Tolls are 1/2 price and well worth the hassle of stopping at every toll. They keep $30 in your account and you get your $10 back on the transponder when you quit. If stopping at each toll, it gets quite dangerous, merging 3-4 lanes to exit then merging back 2-3 lanes getting back on with cars flying through those tolls at 70mph. I have them for both my vehicles."
2984049,Bakefish,2014-07-10 15:55:00,1077,"^^^^ This ^^^^Going to I39 route sends you through 2 tolls (one on I80 just after leaving Indiana) and one on I90, and it eliminates almost all of the city traffic."
2984153,tooski,2014-07-10 16:32:00,393,"Thanks Hips. The money is not the issue, it is the constant stop and go to pay tolls that I would like to avoid. $40.00 seems very reasonable..So we will have a 12 pass rental van, no issue with putting the transponder in it? Obviously I won't have a plate number until it's the day we leave.... Narda, I came back last week along that route and the traffic in the construction zone wasn't real bad. We did come through at around 2 AM though. I am going to trust you on this as you were right on re: the Rye and Dry....."
2984217,NARDA 1,2014-07-10 17:41:00,636,"So we will have a 12 pass rental van, no issue with putting the transponder in it? Obviously I won't have a plate number until it's the day we leave....You can access your Ipass account on line ( http://www.illinoistollway.com/tolls...i-pass-account ) enter the license number of the van and put the transponder in the windshield and you're good to go."
2984273,Richard B,2014-07-10 18:03:00,735,"The transponder goes under the rear view mirror. No issues. The ez pass works in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Used it for the first time last year and man was it great. Never having to stop and pay the toll from Ohio to Canada and back. I figure it saved us about 45 minutes and a bunch of headaches going through the tolls and then merging back into traffic, especially with towing the boats."
2985025,Nimstug,2014-07-10 23:02:00,2605,"Now that's a good question. I'd call the tollway people if you can't find something on line. Maybe the rental company has some suggestions. I'd like to think the rental place would know the actual vehicle you will rent the day before. I do know that within about a half hour of tieing the transponder to the plate, you are good to pay and pay and pay."
2985161,Jatar,2014-07-11 05:38:00,169,"You can go through the I pass lanes without an account, however, if you don't pay up within the grace period, you will be hit with a large fine. Here is the link for paying up.http://www.illinoistollway.com/tolls...s/unpaid-tolls"
