2969897,Habitual Eyer,2014-07-06 18:02:00,144,Anyone know of any Lowrance compatible map chip that has Lake Windermere (Ontario) on it? My Navionics Canada chip has a big uncoverage hole around the Wawa/Chapleau area. Thanks!!!
2972121,kzoofisher,2014-07-07 12:56:00,5144,I'm not aware of any. You can get a paper map for orientation and use your GPS to mark spots where you do well.
2972569,MrSimon,2014-07-07 14:47:00,922,Happy day lodge has very good contour maps for sale. They might even mail you one ahead of time if you call and ask. I found the map to be very accurate .... but huge and cumbersome in the boat.
2973161,kzoofisher,2014-07-07 17:16:00,5144,"You can also get a map here http://www.fishingmapsplus.com/ontario/sudburydist.htm The map comes in four laminated sections and it is complicated to lay out the whole lake at once. I'd love it if the lake was on a chip somewhere, even just something I could load on a tablet to take with me. Better yet would be if fisherman could get as little as an outline and start to build contours and share them. The shoreline is on topo maps and the contour map exists but you can't get it on a chip. I've heard stories that some lakes are kept unavailable but I've never heard a from a credible source why that would be. Maybe it will be available the next time new lakes are released."
2973305,quickster2,2014-07-07 17:50:00,41,I ordered the set of laminated maps from Fishing Maps Plus. Very detailed maps and I also have a map reserved form Happy day Lodge for my trip on the 26th of this month. The laminated maps are stiff. I plan to make copies and utilize those for the boat and use the 1 from the lodge for planning over a cold one.I searched and searched and could not find any electronic maps. My older Lowrance has a hard drive with 1000's of lakes but not Windermere.
2999234,Habitual Eyer,2014-07-15 15:35:00,144,Navionics just got back to me. They have Windermere on a chip. Kind of confusing info with pdf's attached. I can forward e-mail directly on if anyone is interested....but yes Navionics has Windermere on their Hotmaps Premium and Platnum North.
2999714,quickster2,2014-07-15 17:38:00,41,Just confirming this is Windermere/Happy Day Lodge not Windermere BC? I could not find the Lake listed on the website PDF.
3005754,Habitual Eyer,2014-07-17 10:22:00,144,Confirmed...only map of Windermere that Navionics has is the one in B.C.
3010457,adempsey,2014-07-18 17:59:00,963,I put together some maps for my last trip. You can find them on my site here:http://lineonfishing.com/images/Wind...-Section01.pdfhttp://lineonfishing.com/images/Wind...-Section02.pdfhttp://lineonfishing.com/images/Wind...-Section03.pdfhttp://lineonfishing.com/images/Wind...-Section04.pdf
