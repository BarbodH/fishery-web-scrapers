3004866,Guest,2014-07-17 06:37:00,0,walleye central fishermen I would appreciate any information on st joe camp on st joseph lake in nw Ontario thinking on going next year seems very remote with reg 27 rules (non residents of Canada cannot fish the lake unless the camp has reg 27 which this camp has does seems like it limits the amount of fishing pressure) if any of you guys have fished the lake or stayed at resort:I have heard positive things about lake st joseph:we have a group of 5 going to cedar point resort the 1st week of September will issue a trip report jim wolf the Chicago boys will be driving from Chicago to cedar lake
3005138,Fred_G,2014-07-17 07:38:00,908,Can't tell you anything about Camp Lake St Joseph. I've been staying at The Old Post for 18 years. Fishing on St Joe is excellent and seems to get better each year. Maybe it's just me enjoying the time there more.Do you plan to bring your own boat? I know the camp boats are 14' Lund's with 15hp motors. Can take quite a while to get anywhere on a big lake like St Joe. Do you plan to hire a guide for a few days? It's a big lake and there are lots of hazards so I would highly recommend it.You may also want to look at the Winoga Lodge outpost on Lake St Joe. The outpost id right in the heart of some of the best fishing on the lake.http://www.winoga.com/outpost-locations/lake-st-joseph/Fred
3006074,stjoeguy,2014-07-17 11:44:00,979,"As my name implies, I love the lake. You're right about tag required to fish the lake. It results in very little fishing pressure on the lake. After you leave the camp you'll see very few other boats. It's a walleye/northern lake. No bass, musky, or lake trout, but the numbers are great. 30 walleye per day is a bad day. The size seems to getting bigger each year with about a 17-19"" average this year. Our group got a 31.5"" walleye this year, but that's the biggest I've seen from St. Joe. Prior to this year our largest was 28"". Here's a link to Fred G's recent 46"" northern:https://www.facebook.com/oldpostlodg...type=1&theater We used to stay at Camp Lake St. Joseph, but it's been a few years. We now stay 25 miles down the lake at the Winoga Lodge outpost cabin. Merle, Doug & Shelley that run Camp Lake St. Joseph are great people. The fish are just about everywhere in the lake, but Doug can point out some spots for you. The basic tips about wind-swept shores, points and humps apply. You could fish off the dock for a week and have a good time. The cabins are a little rustic, but comfortable with indoor bathrooms with showers. Check with the camp about electricity if anyone needs an outlet for CPAP etc. When we were there they added solar power and electric lights in the cabins but the power was shut off around 10 PM. We fished primarily pitching 3/8 oz jigs with Gulp or twister tails. Occasionally, someone would try leeches but it's not necessary. Rocks. They're everywhere and unmarked. Doug will point out Boulder City and the marks on the shore to help you get around that, but I always travel with one eye glued to the depth finder. You'll have a great time. Feel free to PM me with any questions."

3006346,SinOrSwim,2014-07-17 13:14:00,1528,Never been to St. Joe but Slate Falls Outposts has cabins on that lake and Verne is probably the best outfitter we have had in over 20 years of annual trips.
