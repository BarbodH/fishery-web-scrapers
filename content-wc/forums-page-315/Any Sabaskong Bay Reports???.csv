2989425,Slushfish,2014-07-12 18:00:00,263,Heading up to Nestor Falls the 16th-27th. Getting pretty excited. I was wondering if anyone has any reports from Nestor Falls to Miles Bay? I've heard water levels are still high. Not sure about the upcoming cold front. Any info appreciated.
2989481,Yamagator,2014-07-12 18:16:00,28,We are heading up on July 19th - 26th. Staying at Buena Vista in Morson. I talked to the resort owner who said the water is high and the fishing has been good. I also heard there is some debris floating around so pay attention out there.
2989737,Guest,2014-07-12 20:20:00,0,"Three weeks ago we stayed at a resort on Sabaskong for a 4 day musky/walleye hunt. The weather was overall very good, partly cloudy, and hi temps in the upper 70's. Water temp varied from 63-64 degrees in some of the deeper areas, split rock etc. to 67-68 degrees in the back bays. The musky hunt was a bit more difficult than past years due to the lack of weed development, higher water, and the turbid, darker color of the water. Areas that normally had good weed structure either had no weeds, or they were just starting to emerge. My son had one shoreline hit, and I had two follows that revealed themselves boat side. We tried the usual small bays that normally have weeds, shorelines, rock reefs with deep water near by, and some trolling as well. No catches, but still a great time was had. Our lack of musky success was more than compensated by the numbers of walleyes that came out to play. Trolling cranks was our primary weapon. My son started out using a #7 blue tiger flicker shad, and had immediate action. I switched over to the same crank, and we basically had those welded to the snaps. 150-160 feet back at around 2.3 mph worked well. We would average 20-30 walleyes per day between the two of us. The largest were two 27"" that my son caught, his personal best, and fish in the 22-25"" range. The rest were in the 12-14"" range. There was a definite lack of walleyes in the 14-19"" range though. We were trying to figure out the reason for that.... We didn't see many pike this year due to the weed issues, but we did get some mid to upper 20s pike, and a 37"" that my son caught that was his personal best while trolling for walleyes. The water was 4-5 feet higher than normal, probably higher by now, and did contain a lot of floating, and partially submerged debris. So do be careful with that. Have a great time, and good luck!!!"

Did you fish Stevens bay or as far as Miles bay? It's nice when you don't have to go that far to find fish. Save a lot of time and gas. Thanks for the info."
2990553,Redwood,2014-07-13 08:18:00,80,"Slush, The challenge of figuring out patterns up there is part of the fun. Like you said, every year is different. We only fished Stevens on part of the first day, chasing muskies, so not sure how the walleyes are doing there. Some of the other gents in the resort fished pock piles, and did ok around reefs with jigs, and either leaches or minnows. I think they were down around the Blueberry isl. area. We've never been up to Miles as that is quite a hike from where we stay."
2991305,Slushfish,2014-07-13 12:15:00,263,"Thanks Redwood. Every year can be a challenge. That's why we try to stay as long as possible. If your only there for 5 days, and it takes you 3 or 4 days to figure them out, it doesn't leave much time to pound 'em. We've had years where we wound up going to Miles to get good fish. That's got to be close to 30Mi. each way. There's a lot of water in between but, we wound up making a trip up there and got into fish. After you start catching, it's tough to leave fish to find fish. We mix it up between walleye and musky. Whichever seems to be active."
2995290,PJM,2014-07-14 16:12:00,3516,"Yamagator The Mayfly hatch seem to be over on Saturday the 12th but it was bad Wednesday and yes the lake is up. The minnow shack at and the dock at Buena Vista are under water and all the rocks that were out of the water that you navigate by are under water, so be carefull. Fishing overall was good with most of the fish being caught in the afternoon between 17 and 30 feet off the sides of the reefs."
2996154,Slushfish,2014-07-14 19:47:00,263,Appreciate guys. One day to go. Will post a report the 28th.
3010609,Yamagator,2014-07-18 19:36:00,28,Thanks for the reply's We have tracks from prior years so hopefully will stay out of the rocks! Heading up in the morning - haven't slept much the past couple of nights. Hoping for stable weather.
