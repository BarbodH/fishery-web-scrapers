2985657,Larry S,2014-07-11 08:27:00,665,"Mike an Awesome report on North Caribou. Since I fished it in 2007 it's only getting Better. 17 Trophy pike for One person is just Amazing. It was also Great to meet you and your family at the Valhalla Inn in Thunder Bay the night before we flew into are trip on Kearns Lake. You have a very wonderful family, I can see from all your past postings that your kids are developing a Love for fishing, especially your son. Have a great time on your latest trip to the Asheweig River, as I told you I almost went their around 2003,so enjoy, tell me what I missed ,and catch a Huge brook trout for me. Take Care, Larry S"
3016562,515,2014-07-21 09:31:00,254,Hmmm your getting pretty spoiled lately with all the trips........... Thanks again and another in the books for your family. Thanks for posting it. Mike
2970353,pike50plus,2014-07-06 20:32:00,584,"So glad your family got to share that lake with you, very fitting for such a generous poster on this forum! Class Act! Sam"
2970649,Mike Borger,2014-07-07 03:57:00,1554,I'm a rank amateur when it comes to the videos. This year I'm using a Gopro which has both pros and cons. I did find a great source for soundtrack music! I'm now using a Mac and the iMovie program is pretty intuitive and quite good. I'll get better with more experience.Have a great time on your trip!!
2970657,Mike Borger,2014-07-07 03:58:00,1554,"Thanks to all, very glad you enjoyed the write up.Very kind words Sam, thanks."
2974761,turtle chain,2014-07-08 07:24:00,1398,Mike did you take a look at the other outpost on the lake pickle lake out fitters? did you see the fishermen from that camp and compare notes about there cabins and such thanks
2974913,Mike Borger,2014-07-08 07:41:00,1554,"Pete Johnson's camp is in the far northwest corner right at the rivers outlet. It was the only section of the lake I didn't cover, so no I didn't see it.I'm sure it's a great camp. Only problem is its location as it would be a grossly long run from that spot to some of the areas I fished. North Caribou Camp is right in the middle of the lake with pretty much equal access to any part of it."
2975569,Pikeslayer8,2014-07-08 10:26:00,1460,"Northern Ontario, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Solopaddler. Its 5-year mission: to explore strange new lakes, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. Have a great trip Captain! This area looks like one crazy-assed adventure........"
2975729,Mike Borger,2014-07-08 11:05:00,1554,LOL!Will be a very cool adventure I'm sure. We fly into the remote native community of Kasabonika Lake Saturday morning then we travel by boat 70km's east through the vast expanse of Shibogama Lake. Shibogama has never been fished seriously for pike by anyone...ever. Can't wait to see what some educated pressure produces! From there we head to the lakes outlet which happens to be the Asheweig River and an outpost camp that was built by the natives in 2002. They put a handful of groups through that camp but no one's used it since 2005. The river has giant brook trout which we're hoping to fly fish for. Of course the entire system teems with walleye but we'll probably only fish for them for food.To say I'm stoked is an understatement.
2975897,MrSimon,2014-07-08 11:41:00,922,Holy cow. The boat ride across Kasa and Shibo lakes looks to be THE most confusing ride in all of Canada. Take some extra batteries for your GPS!
2976185,Mike Borger,2014-07-08 13:15:00,1554,A native from Kasabonika will be guiding us. However we will have a GPS as well.I actually paddled the entire Asheweig by myself in my younger days navigating solely by map.
2976769,Draco1206,2014-07-08 17:17:00,175,Totally enjoyed your trip report Mile. Incredible monster pike. I've been going to NWO for nearly 25 years and can count the 40 inch pike I've caught on two hands still. To catch 17 yourself in one week is incredible. We're happy if our group gets a couple per trip. You've set the bar way too high for the rest of us. Nice to see your family along with you and your son is turning into a great angler in his own right. Thanks for giving me something to look forward to some day.
2967969,Knoxabilly,2014-07-05 23:16:00,225,"Amazing trip and report, I always look forward to them. Another fly in spot to put on the bucket list!"
2968105,10lbeye,2014-07-06 05:09:00,61,There is a direct correlation between Mike's trip reports and my bucket list! fantastic report Mike and thanks for sharing.
2968145,Mike Borger,2014-07-06 05:54:00,1554,Glad you enjoyed guys!Cheers
2968201,NY Walleye,2014-07-06 06:12:00,78,"Mike- you do a fantastic job with the videos. Might need to get someh pointers from you. My family is heading to a similar lake this week in northern quebec. The fishing is fantastic, boats are lunds with new motors, camps are similar to the out post camp you showed in video. Again, nice job. I'll poat when I return. We leave Wednesday."
2968241,new hips,2014-07-06 06:55:00,498,Another epic report...........another one to put on my bucket list.Thanks Mike......Great job !!!!!!!!
2968441,turtle chain,2014-07-06 08:36:00,1398,Very nice but not $$ and a 70lb weight limit with a family how did you do that? great report
2968505,Mike Borger,2014-07-06 09:00:00,1554,"It's a bit more money than my usual fly in trip out of Nakina for example, but with the flight to Thunder Bay free with air miles the extra cost was almost offset by the savings in gas.Plus you get a large portion of your food covered in the price of the package as well as a free night in the Valhalla before you fly in.Weight was easy to manage. As mentioned they supply an enormous amount of staple food which is there waiting for you at camp. In addition they have canned soda and beer at the camp which you can purchase when you're there. Yes it's a bit more than buying it yourself, but it's totally worth it as beverages are always a huge part of the weight dilemma. We were provided with bottled drinking water while were there as well at no charge.So we filled a soft cooler with all the various meat, cheese, eggs and other perishables that we needed in Thunder Bay and as I mentioned in my report the Valhalla put the entire thing in a giant walk in cooler/freezer for us. We flew into camp the next morning on Wasaya and there were zero issues with weight. We had all the tackle, food and gear we needed, in fact I probably brought too much. Just my opinion, but this lake offers Manitoba quality fishing at a much cheaper price. It's a great trip and a very good value when you factor in everything you're getting."
2968633,PRO-V1,2014-07-06 10:01:00,142,"Flying out of TBay is convenient, once you hit the border, depending whether you are going to Red Lake, Pickle Lake, Nakina it's going to be a 4-7 hour drive one way and again depending which boarder you cross, road construction, and weather. When you finish your week of fishing and land in TBay you are only 35 mins from the boarder. and on your way home.Mike"
2968785,turtle chain,2014-07-06 11:05:00,1398,I will put this one on the bucket list
2970033,walleye IA,2014-07-06 18:50:00,129,"Mike, thanks for sharing. I love the video and the sound track, it fit perfectly! What a special place. I liked seeing you and your whole family together laughing, smiling and enjoy each other company."
2967401,Mike Borger,2014-07-05 19:10:00,1554,"I'll cut to the chase: This was easily the best fly in trip I've ever done, bar none! Factoring in the size and beauty of the lake, the quality of the fishery, the camp, the boats and motors and the logistics to get there it's not even close.They used to fly out of Pickle Lake which made it impossible for me as it's too far on a tight schedule. This year they started flying out of Thunder Bay and their price included a free nights stay at the Valhalla the night before we flew in.We flew from Toronto to Thunder Bay on Air Miles so we had zero driving. Honestly it was a pure joy.I fished North Caribou Lake June 21-28 with my family (wife and 2 young kids) and words cannot describe how good it was.Fishing wise according to the owner Rob Brodhagen I set a camp record for the number of 40"" pike caught by one angler in a week (17). My 7 year old son caught 4 over 40 and my wife caught 2, so the total number for my boat was 23.Walleye fishing if anything was even better. Almost all of our fish were incidental catches casting for pike and we caught hundreds. I honestly don't know how many? Amazing thing was the numbers, they were insane. Numbers walleye lakes are pretty common, but you're typically catching 16-17"" fish. These fish were thick and fat and an honest 20-22"" average size! Many many fish were caught in the mid to high 20's (24-26"") with half a dozen 28's. Bear in mind we weren't even fishing walleye. There is no limit on the number of walleye you might catch in a day on this lake, seriously.In any case I've put together a detailed trip report with numerous photos and embedded video clips if you'd like to have a look!http://www.canadafishingguide.net/no...-pike-walleye/Cheers, Mike"
2967481,dog2,2014-07-05 19:40:00,198,wow ..just like years ago... Great report!
2967489,PRO-V1,2014-07-05 19:45:00,142,"I lived in Pickle for few years and fished North Caribou only a couple of times, but like your report says it is a fish factory, and is well worth the trip. We flew in with Pete, when you did fly out of Pickle did you fly in with Pete.? ..by the way thats me with the Molson six-pack in the first picture. Mike"
2967521,Kwags,2014-07-05 20:07:00,48,"Yeah, geesh. That's all i can say. Well, one more thing. You have cost me more money than anyone on this site on lures. Last trip, you caught probably 10000 walleye on Northalnd Impusle minnows. Now I have to shopping again! Great report ,"
2967617,Pikeslayer8,2014-07-05 20:26:00,1460,"Incredible report! Never seen anything like it. Now, I suppose that somewhere, somehow their have been 4 grizzled fishermen who have had a trip of this magnitude. It's feasible, but I doubt it, but a family trip with a mom and 2 small kids to lay such a whoopass leaves me speechless! Well done. Truly a trip of a lifetime, yet I believe Solo and Brendan (Joanne & Riley too) will continue to give it their best shot as trips roll on. You have set a very high bar my friend!"
2967705,Mike Borger,2014-07-05 20:50:00,1554,"Hey Mike as mentioned I never fished North Caribou out of Pickle Lake, it's too far for me to drive. I only just considered it as an option this year when they started flying out of Thunder Bay."
2967713,Mike Borger,2014-07-05 20:51:00,1554,HAHAHA! Awesome.!
2967729,Mike Borger,2014-07-05 20:54:00,1554,"Very kind words bud, thanks. I'm going to try my best to top it myself very soon. I leave for the Asheweig River Friday this week. Will definitely be going back to North Caribou though, already looking forward to it."
2967761,Rich B,2014-07-05 20:59:00,1081,"Mike,An ""outstanding"" review of your family's trip to the North Caribou camp....thanks for sharing the video and photos....Rich"
2967865,forgop,2014-07-05 21:45:00,880,Remind me to stay clear of anywhere Mike fishes. I want to be sure there's something left for me when I go.
