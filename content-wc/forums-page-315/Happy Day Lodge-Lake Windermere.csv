2954713,MrSimon,2014-07-01 07:10:00,922,"I guess technically you are right .... but it certainly isn't hurting. I'm guessing here, but I imagine there are thousands of 18+ fish every season that get released at Happy Day that would have been killed at other lodges. I got my biggest walleye ever there last year .... and to be honest, if not for the regulation, I might have kept it. I also think this lake benefits from incredibly low fishing pressure. Happy Day is the only lodge on Windermere and there are only a handful of private cottages. Its a HUGE lake. The camp owners shut down their ramps to the locals, so only camp guests fish the lake. Maybe two dozen boats per week. That is essentially zero pressure. Now if only they would get rid of the annoying generator. The campsites (we were in an RV) are right next to it and the constant hum was so annoying that we won't go back. I now have a policy that I will never go to camps that run 24/7 generators. I don't know why Bob won't pony up and have electric run to the camp .... lodges only a few miles down the road have electric run to them so it shouldn't be that much to extend the lines. He pays a pretty penny to truck in fuel to run that darn thing all summer too."
2961378,Guest,2014-07-03 05:26:00,0,"Jordan, We had some guests alert us about your special request for electric lines being brought to our camp. So I thought it would be appropriate to respond to your request. I'm basing my figures on a letter that I received from Canada Bell, around 2005. They were asking if I would be interested in having a land line for our phone bought to our camp. This line would need to run for about 10 miles to our camp, same as electric lines (not just a couple of miles). The total cost for the phone line would be $1,000,000.00 (this was an actual letter send to us). We needed 20% down ($200,000) before construction would start and we would have 12 months interest free for the balance due. Our payments would have been $8988.28 per month for 15 yrs. For a total (180 payments) of $1,617,890.89. Now even if we could get a bank to entertain my loan application for this type of loan, this would be a miracle in itself. We can't imagine what the current cost would be to bring back hydro (electricity) 10 miles back to our camp today. As for our generator, we are sorry about your nightmare of a trip and that you will never be back. Unfortunately during this time we let everyone know at the time of their arrival that our main generator was temporarily down and we were waiting on our parts to arrive any day. Also, we apologized to the guests that we were currently on our older 3 cycle air cooled generator which meant that we needed to let the back doors open (facing the bush, not the camp) to keep the motor running efficiently without overheating. Unfortunately the parts that were needed for our newer (water cooled) generator had to be ordered from England (Lister Peter - generator/motor). In reference to the generator, we are sorry that your trip with us was so disappointing, but we did the best we could under the circumstances. We were just thankful that we had a backup generator that worked and kept our power going in our time of need. Yes, our newer generator is up and running now and our old but trusty back up generator will be there when and if we need it again. Now maybe I could be wrong, but if you would have arrived at our camp and the circumstances were reversed and we informed you on your arrival that you would have no power/lights and no water, we might be hearing a much different report about our camp then what you just posted! We think most of our guests did appreciate our backup generator (during our break down). At least they did not have to worry about the lights NOT being on when they came in at night and there was power and water for everyone. This was one of the few times that we have ever had a generator break down on us in the 13 years that we have been running the camp. Once again, we are sorry that it happened during the time that you stayed with us. It does take a very strong knit family to operate a camp in a northern location in Canada and we face difficult decisions on a regular basis. Please at least give us credit that we did have the forethought to keep a DEPENDABLE backup generator in working order when needed and we had power and water during your stay. With this all being said, we feel our rates starting at $250 a week (6 nights) per person offers our guests a great value for the type of fishery and camp that we have. If we had to borrow additional $1,000,000 plus to have power lines to the camp, I'm sure our prices would be MUCH HIGHER than we are today! We know we are not the best camp and fishery but we do our best in offering our guests everything we can so they can have a memorable getaway and vacation with their family and friends. As far as our launch being shut down to the locals, this was only temporary due to an open letter threat to us. We do not deny anyone from launching at our facility. We do have special requests for those who choose to use our facility. We do, however, have a fee for launching. We believe there can be a balance approach for everyone as long as the needs of the lake are the first priority for everyone. This is just our thought.

2961762,wallydave,2014-07-03 07:51:00,2151,"Bob, your reply is very educational to say the least! I like the fact that you want to offer a good value and experiance to your guests. There are things that come up, weather, mechanical issues and travel problems that happen, that no one can prevent. When it takes time to make plans for a trip, we all hope things go well so we can have the perfect trip. Those expectations are hard tp live up to. Some of my favorite stories come from trips that didnt go as planned, overcoming those things can make for some great memories! Keep up the good work!"
2962290,Golden Eagle,2014-07-03 10:06:00,2642,"I take ear plugs with me on fishing trips, not to use every night, but they're great when needed. Ear plugs trump noise from generators and fishing partners who snore. Bob, good move to have a back up generator. I've been in a camp when we had no power for 3 days. I've also been in camp several times when underground water lines were frozen. There were no complaints. Guests understood the situation. Jordan, I hope you can return to Windermere for several more years. It seems that you've figured out the catching."
2963658,youngcanadianguide,2014-07-03 21:21:00,60,"Hey Golden Eagle Just wanted to let you know we caught our first 50+ inch pike this year. our guest apologized for not having a great website photo for us but my dad said ""A perfect release IS more important than the perfect picture."" A couple years ago he caught a 48 inch pike and thought it would be the biggest pike he would ever catch but our lake gave him an even bigger fish to brag about. It was an even bigger miracle that he got to hold the fish because his rod only had 6 lb line and his brother couldn't even lift the fish out of the water for him. That fish is now back in the lake to be caught again and to make more big one like her. This is why catch and release is so important to a healthy fishery it gives you the chance to catch a bigger fish next year. Thank you John for your catch and release.Thanks to everyone for the positive comments above. It's been a good fishing year so far. We have had better quality and bigger fish this season. Everyone have a great Canada Day and 4th of July and stay safe(but not too safe that's no fun haha)"
2971513,MrSimon,2014-07-07 09:40:00,922,"Bob, Thanks for the info. We didn't have a nightmare trip ... it was a great trip. We just had a loud generator running 24/7 20 yards from our campsite. Its just how things go. I absolutely love your camp, your lake, and the way your family runs things. Your outpost is the best I've ever been to. As long as I don't have to sleep next to something that sounds like a diesel truck running all night, I'd come back in a heartbeat."
2972353,Golden Eagle,2014-07-07 14:04:00,2642,Sounds like a winner.
3003882,quickster2,2014-07-16 18:54:00,41,Any new reports heading there the 26th for a week. New place for us looking forward to the trip.
2937081,quickster2,2014-06-25 17:41:00,41,Any reports this year. Heading there for a week the 26th of July for a 1st time visit. Understand conditions will change in 1 month just trying to get some intel in advance. Thanks
2938721,Krisco,2014-06-26 08:58:00,12,"We were up May 30th - Jun 6th so this info will not be of much help for you. We have been going there for 5 years now, alway end of May or beginning of Jun. This trip by far was the best fishing we have had, timing is everything and we hit it just right, spawn had just ended a week prior so they were putting on the feed bags.Water temps were 57 at start of trip rising to 62 degs when we left. Conditions were warm, 75 and sunny but quickly changed on day two to cool and wet, had 3 solid days of rain and lots of it, by late in the week back to 75 and sunny. Over the course of that time we found no difference in feeding patterns which is unusual. They were hitting in the morning, mid day and evening, really didn't matter, no ill effects based on weather pattern so it made things easy for us and fun was had by all.All fish caught between 4 and 10 ft of water, primarily jigs and minnow and shallow running cranks, shad raps, Rapalas and such. Many doubles in the boat through the week, was by far the most fun we have had.We have noticed over the 5 years that the size has really increased, seeing many more fish over 18"" than we saw back in the earlier years. Biggest of the week was 25"". We did not target pike as we were having to much fun with the eyes but we did pick up a few on jigs including on very thick 36"" which is unusual for that lake, most are very lean and of the small size.In July you will have to travel further to the deep waters on the west side of the narrows, we were fortunate to be able to stay close to home for most of our fish.This body of water is very underated as far as I am concerned, lots of eyes in there, just need to find them.Good luck and enjoy your trip, beautiful BIG lake to explore, if you get the chance make a trip to the falls at Grazing, if nothing else it is one of the prettiest sites on the lake."
2940017,quickster2,2014-06-26 16:17:00,41,Thanks for the reply. Looking forward to the trip it is a lot closer than our usual trip to Namaken Lake. We'll definitely explore the falls and the sites. Used to traveling long distances on the water during the Crane Lake -- Namaken -- Kettle Falls jaunts.
2940449,kzoofisher,2014-06-26 18:16:00,5144,"Do you think the 18"" max limit is the reason? Seems like they went to that limit about 5 years ago but I don't really remember. I'm headed there in August and really looking forward to it since the peak everything season is winding down here. I take it you stayed at the lodge? Bring your own boat?"
2941369,adempsey,2014-06-27 04:24:00,963,"Nice lake but be prepared to do some traveling. If you are renting a boat get the boat with the biggest engine. It will be worth it, believe me!"
2947369,quickster2,2014-06-29 06:06:00,41,My friend is going also. Our family's both have truck campers and our own boats. His goes Lund goes 55MPH and my Sea Nymph goes 45. We'll be buying lots of gas. Should be a fun week. Thanks for the replies.
2950257,MuskyMaster,2014-06-29 22:38:00,79,"The resort owner (bob I believe) is very knowledgeable on the lake and will tell you right where to go. He knows that lake better than anyone else and put us on the fish everytime. We tried out Prairie Bee the week after the opener this year. Our water was in the mid 50's and even 60's in shallow bay areas, but he said windermere was in the low mid 40's at the same time. Even a year it was 100 degrees everyday we still caught an equal number of walleyes. Bob will tell you what to do. I was probably 16 and 10+ miles from camp when I had a MONSTER pike grab a smallie I was reeling in. Happened at dusk and we stayed out there for hours afterwards and I found out even at a young age I was a master navigator....This pike was in the upper 40's, closer to 50 than 45 lol. There has to be a decent amount up hogs in there because there are millions of eyes. goodluck and post your report and pics."
2950657,MrSimon,2014-06-30 06:50:00,922,"I fished Windermere in late July last year. One of posts above was right that the majority of the walleye will have moved to deeper water in the big basins on the other side of the narrows. They key to Windermere is to move around a bunch at first trying different types of structure at different depths. Once you find them, it will be very easy to repeat the pattern - there is so much structure in that lake its mind boggling. Windermere is the classic ""90% of the fish are in 10% of the water"" type of lake. I also agree that this lake is PACKED with walleye .... and the conservation measures taken by the owners are working. The average size will just keep going up as the years pass. I honestly don't think this lake gets that much pressure, and the fact that ALL fish over 18"" have to go back is awesome!!! The smallmouth fishing is very good, but the pike fishing is mediocre at best. There are certainly some monster pike in there, but pike numbers seem really low."
2953289,Krisco,2014-06-30 18:13:00,12,"Have a great trip and post a report when you return, will be looking forward to hearing how you made out."
2953353,Krisco,2014-06-30 18:27:00,12,"I would like to think that the camp imposed 18"" limit has helped out but in all honesty none of us can say that for sure as there are other factors that come into play. They have been operating with 18"" guide for the last 8 years under the guidance of the local MNR biologist. Regardless of true data I think the important factor is that they are trying to improve the fishery for long term viability and that is what really matter, great camp operators as far as I am concerned.And yes we did stay at the main camp and brought up one boat, also rented one for the camp."
