I have googled all the different outfitters and have some ideas but thought I would ask a bunch of guys that have been there for their thoughts. So, two questions: 1. What's your preferred outfitter? On our end we'll be bringing our own food so the American plan cooking is not as interesting. We're more interested in decent facilities to cook the food and most importantly decent boats. 2. Looks like we can pull off a week in either September or June. Any thoughts on which is the better time of year to head up there? I appreciate any thoughts you have. thanks"
3014769,Freytown,2014-07-20 16:22:00,770,La Pointe aux Dor√©s Outfitter is my favorite in Quebec. The good weeks get booked fast and June is the best IMO. Sept can also be outstanding when you locate them....very few bugs too. Email is returned quickly. Give them a look. http://www.pointe-aux-dores.com/en/apropos.shtml http://www.facebook.com/pages/Pourvo...82897828401728
