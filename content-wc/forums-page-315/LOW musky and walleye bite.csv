3010849,stillangling,2014-07-18 21:23:00,149,Fished yesterday and the fish were on fire. Muskies were on wind swept island points with pencil reeds and phragmites in combination with rock. Nothing on main land points that looked similar. Walleye were in 19 to 21 ft on mainland points. Awesome day. Fished in the area south of the Barrier Islands and on the west side of the lake.
