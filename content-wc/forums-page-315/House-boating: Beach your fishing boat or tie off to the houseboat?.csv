I always thought that everyone beached their boats overnight but as I was reading some old houseboat posts some fellow referenced tying off his boat to the houseboat, so it got me thinking as to what other people do who have bigger boats like mine. I have a19 foot Skeeter w/200 Yamaha."
3004666,Knutson21,2014-07-17 04:42:00,348,We tie off like its a dock
3004698,popi,2014-07-17 05:46:00,593,"Last time I tied off, one of the house boat lines came loose in the middle of the night and the houseboat drifted against my boat and the beach.woke up to find my kicker motor mounts broke.Freak accident? I don't know but after that I beached my boat and tied it to a tree about a 100 feet from the houseboat.I also tied the houseboat up myself every time after that.Lake Cumberland KY"
3004722,Skywagon,2014-07-17 05:56:00,1106,"No chance of boat rash if you tie up to shore. Most of the places I see where they tie up the houseboats, it is a sand beach, trees are not that far away to tie too, just make sure you take a long rope."
3004874,Knutson21,2014-07-17 06:39:00,348,"I guess by every ones responses, when I stay at a resort I should beach the boat too. That way no worries of dock rash. If you are smart and do it right its the same as a dock. Also most of the places we park our houseboat on Lake of the Woods it is rocky, not a beach. The one beach we use I wouldn't put my boat on, because if the waves come up they will just go over the transom and swamp the boat. Everyone has their way and that is fine. I am just giving my opinion."
3004930,SinOrSwim,2014-07-17 06:47:00,1528,"I have always wondered how much more work a houseboat is? I have owned a houseboat on our local lake for many years. But, in Canada with that many guys it always seems space would be tight? Plus, the worry about somethign happening with storms overnight etc. Never thought about boats, but that seems like another worry? If you are beaching it are you walking through the bush to get to the houseboat?"
3006146,Bakefish,2014-07-17 12:02:00,1077,"When we had a big crew that would go up we would occasionally rent a houseboat. It was a gas. A bit crowded, but that seemed to add to the fun. The nice part was you could move your ""cabin"" close to where the good fishing was. We would find the good fishing in our fishing boats and then move the houseboat to that general location. Sometimes we would only move the houseboat a couple times a week."
3006730,NCESI,2014-07-17 16:00:00,249,I have a glass boat and tie up to the line running from the back of the houseboat to the shore tie off point. it works great. Just tie off from each cleat to the line and you are set.
3007882,Lazy Fisherman,2014-07-18 04:42:00,276,"We always tied off to the houseboat. That way, when we ran the generator, we could recharge our trolling motor batteries. Just bring plenty of boat fender/bumpers and you are good to go."
3017018,cuamb,2014-07-21 11:59:00,203,We have pulling up to the beach for many years. Not an issue other than you pick up a lot sand (both in your boat and the houseboat). If you were in a calm bay it might be nice to tie up to the houseboat. Maybe when my boat gets a little older and I won't worry about the rash. It would be nice for unloading and charging batteries.
