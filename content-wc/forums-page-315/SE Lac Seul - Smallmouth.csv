I will be heading up in a little under a month, fishing out of the deception bay landing, focusing primarily on walleyes. I was thinking of exploring the Zig-Zag, Sen Bay area as I have never had a chance to fish that part of the lake and was wondering if this area holds a decent population of smallmouth? I had a blast catching them up in the boundary waters on top water and was hoping to maybe try it one evening on Lac Seul for a change of pace. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Matt"
