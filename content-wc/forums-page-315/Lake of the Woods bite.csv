3008090,deadhead1,2014-07-18 06:20:00,193,Thanks for the heads up about humps starting again. Our part of the lake (Bigstone Bay) is usually slower to pick up than further south. We fished a hump thursday evening and they were there but not very agressive. I hope to head down south of East Allie closer to Big Narrows on Saturday. We usually get bigger fish down there and a more consistent bite.
3003130,deadhead1,2014-07-16 14:34:00,193,"We are on the north east side of Lake of The Woods east of Kenora. The walleye seem to have turned off. July 5th weekend they were biting every place we tried. Now I can't find them. Tried the summer humps and not there, tried the spring spots and not there, Anyone willing to give me some hints?"
3003218,emma17,2014-07-16 14:57:00,436,What are you using? Have you tried crawler harness?
3003234,deadhead1,2014-07-16 15:00:00,193,mostly just jigging with leeches. Might have to try night crawlers on spinners.
3003602,Blades-n-Beads,2014-07-16 17:20:00,484,"Hey deadhead what you seeing on the water level there, I'm headed up in 2weeks. Hopefully water levels coming down? Blades"
3003690,KM1,2014-07-16 17:58:00,374,the bite changed from leeches to crawlers big time. The second week of our trip was that first week of July. Our big fish came off Lindy Rigs with leeches...then...the second week...leeches died and they wanted a faster presentation. Went to bouncers with death hooks and smiley blades. Trolled .08 to 1.0 mph...that was the ticket. See this post:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=365569
3004362,muskyman73,2014-07-16 21:11:00,402,"We ended up our trip doing well on 1/2 oz jigheads with safety pin style arms with gold blades, small blades size 2 or 3. And we did really well on the 3 inch gulp minnows on wind blown shorelines with steep drop offs."
3004690,deadhead1,2014-07-17 05:38:00,193,Water is still high. really hasn't come down much since the high a few weeks ago. There was a corner of my dock showing yesterday but this morning it is back to being covered. They are forecasting to drop a few inches over next 7 days but at least mid August before it returns to normal.
3004762,Obabikon,2014-07-17 06:08:00,2370,They moved completely off the humps/points to weed beds 4 or 5 days ago. (right on the edges of weed beds). Good luck!
3005234,Shorelunch,2014-07-17 08:00:00,554,"Obabikon - assuming the warmer weather forecast holds, do you think our walleye friends will move back to the humps/reefs? We fished the reefs/islands/humps out from Dawson Channel/Gooseneck two weekends ago and did OK. Tried Sunset Channel points, too and nothing."
3005946,patricktjms,2014-07-17 11:08:00,67,"We were up there until the 12th and we found all kinds of walleye in 8' of water on cranks. Not 12, not 10, not 6. They would not hit a jig with anything on it. Orange was the color, 1.5-1.6 mph. Jointed rapalas, shad raps. They werent on the humps, they werent in the weeds. When we found perch, we found walleye."
