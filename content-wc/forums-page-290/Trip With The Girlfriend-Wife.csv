Regarding the wife and girlfriend, I'd suggest just making 2 trips out of it - one trip with each! Bill"
3660090,Aspencreek,2015-03-17 13:18:00,2911,"I never took my wife to Canada for 2 simple reasons: 1. she didn't want to go. 2. I didn't want her to go.My best fishing partner made the fatal mistake of taking his wife almost 8 yrs ago, now he CAN'T GO unless she goes along. He is not my best partner anymore, if fact we haven't been in the same boat since.For all you guys that take your wives and girlfriends, I tip my cap to you. I simply need and relish the time away. When I walk into the bathroom in a camp cabin and there is hair dryers, smelly shampoo, hair spray, make-up, curling irons, etc., etc taking up the precious space for my toothbrush and comb, I get a bit testy. And the Glade orchid air freshener makes me sneeze. Maybe it's because I lived in a testosterone free zone for most of my life, 3 daughters and a wife, and the moon cycle theory IS REAL!!!"
3666594,Thumpr50,2015-03-19 08:02:00,139,"I started taking my then girlfriend to Canada with me in 1995, she is now my wife and has gone with me for a week every year since. It has become her favorite vacation, just the other day as I was pan frying some walleye fillets she asked ""how long before we go to Canada again?"" She enjoys the fishing part but enjoys the piece & quiet, beauty of the Canadian wilderness even more. Look at some resort websites there are several resorts on LOTW, Eagle Lake and Lac Seul (to name a few) that have modern cabins that most of the ladies would view acceptable."
3667106,ftfarms,2015-03-19 09:13:00,444,I would go to lotws out of morson Ontario. Boat to milesbay or Tamarac island. We've stayed at milesbay camp and grassy narrows. Both are nice camps with great owners. Walleye and smallmouth fishing is awesome. Crappie fishing last may- june was great off the dock. We didn't fish for musky but had a couple follows . One was big. Almost got a tape on him he sat next to my boat so long. haven't stayed at Tamarac but have a friend that does every year with his group. Musky fishing in that area is some of the best I've heard of.

3656714,stingernd,2015-03-16 17:45:00,25,I'd take the girlfriend
3656786,Jeler,2015-03-16 18:14:00,92,"I agree, taking my wife up to a lake via MLO in August. This will be her first Fly-in and she's excited to go! I'll post after our return to the States and some photos!Between you and me I'm excited she's so thrilled with the idea and hopefully we can follow up with trips every year!"
3656858,Draco1206,2015-03-16 18:27:00,175,"Leave the wife at home and take the girlfriend. If the girlfriend has your dinner ready when you get back from fishing and can fillet a mess of walleyes, keep the girlfriend and get rid of the wife."
3658346,DeBo,2015-03-17 06:39:00,211,Thanks for all the thoughts and PMs. Got a few extra suggestions I hadn't thought of.Anyone have any favorite female friendly camps on Whitefish Bay LOTW? The timing will be later in August so I would like to avoid any bloom concerns etc. I know that is a solid time of year for Whitefish bay and that clear water would work very well with short trips at prime times throughout the day. I asked her thoughts about muddy/algae water areas and I think she is expecting clean clear water so trout water lakes fit that bill.Any one stay at Whitefish Bay Camp recently? Any good camps on Crow (Kakagi)? Outposts on Pipestone?
3658386,Obabikon,2015-03-17 06:42:00,2370,"I haven't stayed there, but Bob and Peg at Whitefish Bay are wonderful people."
3658418,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2015-03-17 06:51:00,629,"I have stayed there & I 2nd ""Obabikon's"" suggestion for ""Whitefish Bay Camp"" on Culverts Island/LOTW."
3658618,bigwalleye1,2015-03-17 07:26:00,2632,"Would you please post pictures, clearly identified, of both the wife and the girlfriend? It will help us help you. Also, if you have any photos of either of them with a boat or holding fish, it will help. Once we're able to evaluate photos, the clearest answer is to only take one, if it's going to be the girlfriend, I'd rocommend somewhere where no one knows you."
3658802,DeBo,2015-03-17 08:08:00,211,LOL! These responses made me chuckle! Probably should have worded the title better but wanted to find places that are femal friendly and get input from people who take wives and people who take girlfriends.One is enough of a challenge......
3659002,bigwalleye1,2015-03-17 08:55:00,2632,"Roger that. Sometimes MORE than enough, but that's a different thread....."
3646810,DeBo,2015-03-13 14:32:00,211,"My girlfriend wants to go on a NW Ontario trip with me this summer to see what I am always yammering about. I don't care much at all about facilities but she will require a nice clean cabin. Drive in or boat in with my own boat. No Fly-ins.Other criteria in no particular order3 hours or so from Baudette, I-falls, or I guess the NW Angle of LOTW would be a possibilityGood musky waterScenic water and a solid wilderness feel. I go to Minaki every year and that can be found but it's a long way from town.Good fishing near camp. I see this trip being a head out for 2-3 hours at a time 2 or 3 times a day. Want her to enjoy it and I think that sounds like a nice vacation.Housekeeping and cooking our own mealsThoughts? I'm thinking an island camp in Sabaskong bay, Sanctuary Resort in Whitefish bay, or Century Lodge in Osbourne bay on Eagle lake are the front runners. I camped at Sanctuary one night and can't remember how nice the cabins were."
3646874,Obabikon,2015-03-13 15:02:00,2370,PM sent. Glad to make additional recommendations if you need.
3646914,BornToFish,2015-03-13 15:20:00,1224,"It sounds as though you are pretty zeroed into the places you want to fish. I thought of three other things to think about when going for the first time with your girlfriend. One is to consider late July or the first three weeks of August. This time span is when the most stable weather tends to happen in NW Ontario. One more reason to consider this time span is that the bugs tend to be favorable at this time of the year. Finally, carefully choose your lodge as not all lodges in Canada are friendly to women or families. You only get one chance to make a first impression upon her. She likely won't go back if she has a bad time. My wife fishes with me for the first two weeks of August. As you mentioned, we make three outings onto the lake each day. Each outing goes about three to four hours. We fish from first light to about 8:30 or so when the walleye bite tends to slow. We come in for breakfast and to relax. We go out in the middle part of the day for about four hours to fish for whatever she wants to fish for (typically pike, perch or bass). We come in and relax for a while and then have dinner. We go out after dinner and fish walleyes until dark. Go out of your way to please her and you just might have her saying ""can we come for two weeks next year?"". Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3648034,F250,2015-03-14 04:42:00,75,I would recommend Obabikon.
3648770,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2015-03-14 08:47:00,5533,You take her once and she'll probably want to keep going on your trips. Just saying.
3649138,pale ryder,2015-03-14 11:05:00,1937,"Clark's Northern Lights Resort on Cedar Lake.Big enough that you don't have to keep fishing the same spots, but protected enough that you can fish in almost any wind. Big Muskies, Walleye, SMB, Perch, and Crappie.Easy drive to, black top until the last few miles.Free bait.Nice rental boats.Get one of the deluxe cabins. Dishwasher, microwave, sat. TV.http://clarksresorts.com/pages/view/...-lights-resort"
3649242,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2015-03-14 11:41:00,629,"DeBo:I would recommend that you look-up: ""Grassy Narrows Lodge/Morson Outfitters"" website out of the Miles Bay area of LOTW. From Hanson Bay to ""Grassy"" is about 14 miles by camp launch or private boat. Good Musky waters locally or near by along with Walleye, Sauger, Perch, Crappie, Smallmouth Bass, N. Pike etc. LOTW has all kinds of ""Wildlife"" to see as well. Sheltered enough that weather & wind will not spoil your day. American Plan & Housekeeping packages are both offered. Wayne Schoen & Dale Horton are your hosts. Set the hook, CRJohn H."

3649474,Obabikon,2015-03-14 13:58:00,2370,I had typed out the full moon is July 31st this year... then I realized what you were talking about. :S
3649490,Carnhzkr,2015-03-14 14:00:00,964,"I do know what you mean, and I don't think it has anything to do with the fish bite. You gotta go when you can go and can't always wait until the moon is in the seventh house and Jupiter is aligned with Mars. I started taking my wife about ten years ago. A fishing trip to Ontario is definitely not her top choice, but she has learned to enjoy it and looks forward to our trip each year, and I enjoy watching her catch fish. Oddly, it does seem as though the moon is always in the wrong phase when we go, if you know what I mean."
