Odds are they lift the ban before the season kicks off, but probably a good idea to leave at home until we hear different. Also remember, Canada likes all things to be ""factory packaged"" when it comes to food. Things like potatoes, onions, veggies. Bulk stuff"
3670258,btyreprich,2015-03-19 19:59:00,1067,Sure hope this ban is reversed in time for the start of the fishing season. I love my scrambled eggs and bacon for breakfast. We switch off between eggs with bacon and pancakes with breakfast sausages. So the posts would have me believe that whole uncooked chicken would also be prohibited but packages of frozen chicken breasts are OK.
3670370,1jigfish2,2015-03-19 20:29:00,110,"I believe that I read that this ban is only from certain states. I think there are about 6 states involved. I think Minnesota is one of them, Wisconsin is not."
3670994,TIGHTLINER,2015-03-20 04:33:00,223,Last couple years we been taking egg beaters into camp. Will have to wait till the last minute to see if they lift the ban on chicken and eggs.
3671034,Tonyo,2015-03-20 05:29:00,212,"Just a quick thought, they sell eggs in Canada. Is this really a. Big deal?"
3672586,davenathe,2015-03-20 11:23:00,113,"Exactly, always plan to pick up a few things in Dryden grocery store. Prices are very similar to states, may being changing with exchange rate, wait that could make items in Canada less expensive!!!"
3673434,quickster2,2015-03-20 17:00:00,41,Egg beaters??? Horrible.
3673842,btyreprich,2015-03-20 18:48:00,1067,"Yes you can buy eggs and chicken in Canada. Might have to this year! There are two issues for our group and why we buy groceries at home: 1. Having to stop at the time we are in the Dryden area - grocery stores might not be poem. 2. The cost of groceries in Canada. Now with the exchange rate at its current rate, the groceries might be comparable to here in the Chicago area. In the years past, the prices even at the Walmart in Dryden were considerably higher than back home."
3675010,rnnonmt,2015-03-21 08:38:00,992,Free range chicken eggs for sale in Phoenix AZ. 4 bucks a dozen... $99.99 for shipping. Free delivery to Lac Seul 2nd week of June only....
3675170,downriverbob,2015-03-21 09:19:00,880,"I am at Lake of the Woods today, traveled through International Falls/Fort Francis three days ago never was asked if we had these items. Had/have both chicken and eggs. A friend who is a resort owner stated the same thing that others had said. If the ban doesn't cover your state, just bring a receipt from where you bought chicken/eggs. BOB"
