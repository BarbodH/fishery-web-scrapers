3665602,Aspencreek,2015-03-18 20:34:00,2911,"HAHAHA, the map provided for free is worth exactly that!"
3667570,Pooch,2015-03-19 10:41:00,4619,"Aspencreek you're too cynical, but somewhat correct! Some camps have a poor map they hand out while others have great maps. One camp we fish uses Red Lake Digital's maps and gives them to new customers or old customers when they ask. Fantastic maps. Accurate and waterproof.Ask ahead of time for a camp map before you head north. If it's a little ""shy"" of what you want, look around. Many lakes are mapped and copies are available if you search for them.Pooch"
3667994,Carnhzkr,2015-03-19 11:46:00,964,"I guess the value of the map depends on what you're looking for. The maps I've gotten from LS lodges work just fine for navigation. They're large enough to show necessary detail, work well for someone to mark up hotspots, and they're waterproof. I'm sure you could buy larger maps that show even more detail, but if you want to get to the reef off of Deer Island, these maps will get you there and back. If you want a map that has accurate depth contours, good luck, cuz it doesn't exist for LS. So HAHAHA right back."
3670466,Aspencreek,2015-03-19 20:50:00,2911,"OK, you guys go right ahead and use those. But I'll bet you have a GPS and graphs too. I can get just about anywhere I want on LS now after 15 yrs of trips, but for newbies???? There are some underwater land mines out there that can ruin your trip if you are not using proper travel routes. You guys know as well as anyone that these are not ""soup bowl lakes"", and I have dragged in 2 (so far) that thought they could drive anywhere they wanted because it was wet on top. 1 was a Ranger with ALL of the electronics and a 200hp opti, his lower unit is now structure and a fish crib. If camps are supplying GOOD maps now that is a smart decision, and probably saves on props and lower units, BUT they should also be marked with proper travel routes. Shanty Narrows area, the Bay of Islands, and many others have reefs that can come up to less than 2' and those maps do not show them, even the ones WITH depth contours. You may be surprised what you find if they draw down the water level like it was in 2002, when it was almost 6' below normal levels the hold at now. I was there that year, that's how I discovered the mid lake humps I fish now."
3671274,CamoHunter,2015-03-20 06:28:00,363,"He's right on the money. It doesn't exist, unless you make your own. I've made my own for the areas we fish, and safe travel routes we've used. Over time, I will expand on these areas each year and eventually have a darn nice map! Even sooner if I get a few guys to share mapping."
3673930,Aspencreek,2015-03-20 19:03:00,2911,"While driving around today for work I also remembered an incident in 2004 or 2005. My partner and I noticed a camp boat from Scout Lake camp motoring around looking for something. They then decided to come over to where we were fishing and asked for directions. They were hopelessly LOST!!! They had one of those maps that were shown earlier in the thread, but they could not even tell me where they were on the map, or where they thought they were. They were so far wrong, it was embarrassing. We pulled up on shore and got them squared away as to where we were and gave them one of the maps I had put together from Fishers Maps. But these guys were so spooked that they just asked if we minded if they fished by us until we were ready to go in. Since we were at Onaway, and Scout Lake is close we just took them all the way to Scout lake. Moral of the story is simple: 1)even a good map is useless unless you are making notes/marks, or leaving a bread trail. 2) Know how to read a map, it is unbelievable how many people have no idea how that is done. 3) It is way to easy to drive around out there, go around a couple islands, get turned around and just like that you are lost. And spending the night on an island with those blood sucking insects is not something I would wish on anyone, if unprepared."
3639074,Pooch,2015-03-11 13:44:00,4619,"Here is a very small sample of the hand drawn maps of Savant that I had a chance to copy years ago. I have no idea who did it or when. The maps when laid next to each other covered a pool table. I had them scanned at our local blue print shop. They are as accurate as any I have encountered.I have to wonder that the original map maker would ever even dreamt that his maps would be converted to an electronic form and passed around someday. My question is why? Savant is 90,000 acres and was only commercial fished a year or two before an accident busted the enterprise. Or at least that's the story I got years ago.Kind of cool in a historical sort of way. Obviously I've added some names to the maps.Pooch"
3639354,adempsey,2015-03-11 15:09:00,963,"Not to ruin the intrigue, but I have to tell you, that map is from the Ontario MNR."
3639914,Pooch,2015-03-11 17:46:00,4619,"I had my hands on what sure seemed to be the originals. They were on large almost onion skin like paper or a thinner paper that had really yellowed. There were no markings of any kind on them so I still (want!!) to believe they were original or first generation copies.I know the maps you are talking about and they do have the same ""look"". Like I said earlier, they appear more accurate than other maps of the same lake from Red Lake digital. I would have thought that (Gary?) at Red Lake Digital would have used the MNR maps to make his. Which are really top shelf and very nice maps.I like your reasoning though Dempsy. Makes the most sense to me.Any idea of when and how they might have been made?Pooch"
3639930,pjshorthorn,2015-03-11 17:52:00,5654,"I would agree with adempsy. Looks like a tracing of the MNR map outlining the Savant Lake surveys they conducted back in the day. Lac Seul surveys were conducted between 1968 - 1969. If in fact it is a tracing of Savant, that is a huge amount of work done by someone. Attached are pictures of the SE section of Lac Seul. This copy of the map belonged to my grandfather and it would be from the 70s. We used it to navigate from Deception Bay out of Sioux Lookout up to Taylor Island in our own boats using this map. My first trip was '84 and the map was well worn by that time. Wish I had original copies of the other three sections of Lac Seul. I noticed in adempsy's picture of the NE section ,in his first post, that there was a handwritten note..."" last copy, do not give out"". Looked like the note was dated 10-3-1991. All things considered, these original maps from the DNR are pretty accurate on the significant hazards .....just my opinion. There is no way to note every deadhead, lone rock or reef. The biggest education I got fishing familiar waters on the NE section one year was all of the hazards we found when the lake level was down 6 ft. In many cases we had blown right over those submerged hazards never knowing or caring...... ""Note to self"" took hold that trip and the map was marked accordingly for future reference. We also shared what we found with the outfitter so they knew for future reference. When I go back and look at areas I've fished on Lac Seul, the contours on the MNR maps get a fella pretty close to fishy areas. We didn't have electronics back then so we used the contoursn the map to figure out the transitions off of points, shorelines and islands. If a reef was noted on the map and we wanted to fish it, we just went that way and took caution while finding out if it was an exposed hazard or just a ""sleeper' right under the surface. I wouldn't give up all those days of figuring stuff out with a Lac Seul map in hand. The chips of today are cool.....they will get you to an area of interest ( point A to point B) after that the electronics take over nowadays on where the fish are really at. I've learned to respect Lac Seul as much as any other body of water that I've fished including the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Just my $1.25 PjShorthorn"
3640162,Pooch,2015-03-11 19:18:00,4619,"I agree with you guys in that what I had copied was maybe a tracing of the MNR maps. That's the logical conclusion since I don't know where they came from or where they are at now. Wish I had them simply because they were cool.I agree that LS demands respect, especially as fast as today's boats can go. Hitting a rock at ten to fifteen mph has a lot better outcome than hitting that same rock at thirty or forty.I'd still like to know how they mapped lakes before GPS was available. Those guys must have had a good eye.Pooch"
3640986,Fish Finder,2015-03-12 06:20:00,13,"Another option for those who own a ipad, is to download the app Navionics. You can purchase the ability to download the whole United States and Canada for $14.99. You can use the GPS off of your ipad to navigate with or if it is a older ipad, purchase a separate GPS antenna to Bluetooth to link the two. I also have used this and have found to be a very helpful tool. This app is very versatile with a option to overlay google maps, it has distant measuring, mapping, fish marking, etc. Once downloaded, you get the govt. charts or sonar charts as well. Hope this helps. P.S. It also works with a iPhone but you will lose detail due to the size. You can turn the cellular portion of your phone off and just use the GPS for navigation."
3645738,SinOrSwim,2015-03-13 09:12:00,1528,Question. Are these marks from spring/early summer fishing? I don't see any reefs in the middle so am assuming these marks are for the the points and areas in 10 to 15 feet of water vs maybe 25+?
3646418,bushy,2015-03-13 12:06:00,17,This would be for summer fishing when the walleyes are back out in the main lake. Not too many mid lake reefs. Most of them come out of the water as small islands. I don't usually do any good in July or August north of Steamboat.

3635002,Mike Kansas,2015-03-10 13:58:00,1463,TrakMap has a good product for Lac Seul. Been useing them for years and has really helped us catch more fish. Mike Kansas
3635106,CamoHunter,2015-03-10 14:30:00,363,"Mike Kansas, I bought that program too. It's not accurate."
3635130,Mike Kansas,2015-03-10 14:38:00,1463,Did you buy the Chart or the Map? I have always got the Chart and have been pleased with the results it has given us. I would agree that they are not 100% accurate but with the size of the lake and the tendency for winds to move sand around I wouldn't expect 100% accuracy. They do give enough info to help fish new areas and with the aid of a depth finder the maps are a asset. Mike Kansas
3635154,CamoHunter,2015-03-10 14:41:00,363,"I bought the chart with depth contours for my Garmin gps. Like I showed, I'm better off creating my own maps for the areas we fish. Trakmaps, nor any of the other products I've spent money on have showed any points, humps, submerged islands, dropoffs, etc. I can provide several examples where things are WAY off."
3635218,Mike Kansas,2015-03-10 14:54:00,1463,"You might be right. To each his own. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
3637946,Pooch,2015-03-11 08:11:00,4619,"""I've spent money on have showed any points, humps, submerged islands, dropoffs, etc.""If store bought maps were that accurate then EVERYONE would know the good spots with little or no effort on their part. I just want a good navigation map with the islands and landmarks pretty close to where they are actually located. Marked hazards are a big plus.Pooch"
3638234,CamoHunter,2015-03-11 09:38:00,363,"Pooch, THAT'S WHAT A DEPTH MAP IS FOR! If a depth map doesn't show accurate depth data, that a person can look at and locate some areas with structure that might be worth fishing, then basically all it is good for is navigation!Most people looking for a good depth map for a lake, want to see accurate depth data to be able to identify good fishing structure (points, humps, submerged islands, dropoffs, etc.)I was pointing out the fact that none of the commercial map products available for Lac Seul are good enough to identify good fishing structure. They're basically only good for navigation and knowing where you're at. SOME hazards are marked, but there are also many that aren't marked on these maps. (I own both a Navionics chip, and TRAK maps)"
3638522,bushy,2015-03-11 10:41:00,17,Here are a couple marked up for you. Green fishing spots. Red are hazards.
3638626,Pooch,2015-03-11 11:14:00,4619,"CamohunterI've yet to find any map for a Canadian lake accurate as far as depth. They all are very general in nature. Lac Seul is probably the most elusive probably because of it's sheer size. I have several full maps of the lake and none are very close.Years ago I was privy to a hand drawn set of maps for Lake Savant. Those were as close as I've encountered over the years.Like you, I've mapped some areas we like to fish myself. It's time consuming, but worth the effort. I did learn that what I thought I knew about a ""spot"" was all wrong once it was mapped and I looked at it on the computer.Pooch"
3638642,CamoHunter,2015-03-11 11:19:00,363,"Thanks Pooch, I guess that's what I was trying to get across. That most lakes up there are unmapped by any company, so you're not going to find a good depth map for Lac Seul. I'm betting it would take several years of non stop boating, to map a lake as large as Lac Seul. Thus, the reason it may never be mapped accurately. That's why I took it upon myself to start saving data and just map the areas that we fish regularly when we go there. I don't take any extra time to map the areas, just that while fishing I'm recording depth data, and then import that into a map later on."
3630658,sauvain,2015-03-09 12:09:00,63,Best place to get a map for the northwest area of Lac Seul...will be fishing out of Ear Falls.

3631610,SinOrSwim,2015-03-09 16:16:00,1528,Is there a reason Lac Seul doesn't have a decent map that has more detail? The map chips have detail but it makes me wonder how accurate that really is?
3632610,Fish Finder,2015-03-09 20:40:00,13,"Dave at Whitewing Resort had some real nice ones made and printed on canvass, I believe he still has some in some PVC holders as well. They hold up great to the weather and banging around in boats. They are fairly big and good detail. I think they were around $25 with case and $10 paper copy but don't quote me on that. We bought ours five or six years ago. Very durable."

3634130,CamoHunter,2015-03-10 10:33:00,363,"It is a HUGE lake. No company has surveyed the lake yet, and probably won't for a long time because of size, cost to survey that large of body of water. Even though some consumer demand is there, it probably doesn't warrant the cost involved for a company to survey such a large body of water, and the limited number of maps they'd sell.And all the maps that are available, are basically worthless for depths because they're so inaccurate. They're only good for navigation and knowing where you're at. I'm making my own map of areas we fish, with Humminbird's AutoChart program."
