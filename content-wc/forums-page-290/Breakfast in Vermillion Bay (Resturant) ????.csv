3662482,HeHooksHimself,2015-03-18 08:04:00,725,"The coffee shop (Middle of Nowhere Coffee) has a bakery. They have great sticky buns and some fancy egg stuff. I have heard that the fort has a breakfast option but we have never tried it. This year we get to go in on Friday night, so we will only worry about breakfast on the way out. At that time we will get our coffee and baked goods and then make it to I Falls for a late breakfast. The story at Buster's is that their breakfast cook came from Dryden and it wasn't profitable We miss the Village Corner too. It was awesome. VBay is different without Jiggers and Allen manning the station at Bobby's. Although he occasionally makes a guest appearance and if you ask he will yell at you and try to humiliate you. A great experience for the rookies!"

On way back we try to leave at 0600 which puts us in Dryden at a perfect breakfast time. That stretch of road from Vbay to Dryden stinks if it isn't cloudy. That sun comes up right in front of you.

We typically hit the Shorelunch about 10:30-11: a.m. on a Saturday.Last year we stopped at the Vermilion Bay bakery and it was really slim pickings. Would be hard to make a breakfast out of what was available and we moved on. I do not know if that was just an unusual day.
