There's more than one big N flag flying around here on fall game days, so I'm not the only one. Although I've lived in CR since '96, I still don't have many black & gold shirts, but will need to pick one up (and maybe a red & gold one too) so I can watch the NCAA tourney."
3665562,Aspencreek,2015-03-18 20:28:00,2911,"I understand your point.......BUT, that's where I go. Personally I love it for a couple reasons. 1) yes I leave Madison on thurs morning, so I am taking 1 extra day off work, but I always have extra days of vacation anyway, and the day before you leave is a blowoff day anyway. 2) Because you are waiting in line to get across the border on sat morning I have LS to myself on Saturday, and I can get to camp by 1-2pm on Friday so I get an extra half day of fishing in. And when I cross on thurs night the lonest line I have been in was at 5pm and there was 2 cars in front of me. 3) Crossing back into the US on Friday morning is almost the same. 4) If you stay overnight in the IF or FF area on Friday night it is required to make reservations a yr in advance, getting a reservation on thurs night is not that way. 5) The traffic up on Fridays and Sat is ridiculous compared to going up on thurs. I could keep going!!! I don't understand why more camps don't do Fri to Fri. I asked Blair at Onaway why he does Fr to Fri and he told me his first year he asked the guys at camp what they would prefer, he got his answer."
3641874,Carnhzkr,2015-03-12 09:42:00,964,"There's one lodge in particular that I've always wanted to try, but when I compare it with the other lodges in the area, I always rule out. I'll go ahead and name it - Onaway on Lac Seul. Onaway gets great reviews on this site and it looks top notch, from what I can tell. But what always turns me off about it is they book from Friday to Friday, instead of Saturday to Saturday. That would cost me an extra day off work. I'd need to drive up Thursday so I'd have to take off seven work days, as opposed to six for a Saturday to Saturday lodge. I wonder why they do that. I'd think that would alienate more potential clients than it would attract."
3641962,Larry S,2015-03-12 10:19:00,665,If you really would like to go there call them and tell them your situation maybe something can be arranged
3642050,Carnhzkr,2015-03-12 10:35:00,964,"I was really just curious about why a lodge would choose to run Friday to Friday, and wondering if anyone else felt the same way I do. I've stayed at Lac Seul Lodge the past two years and will be at Fisherman's Cove in June and LSL in August. Each year I call Onaway, but settle on one of the other lodges in the area due to their schedule, plus they're priced a little higher than the others when you factor in kids rates. It's all the same water."
3642082,Mike Borger,2015-03-12 10:46:00,1554,Personally I much prefer Friday to Friday as it works best with my work schedule. I understand what you're saying though.
3643498,luv2fishcanada,2015-03-12 17:39:00,41,"I think several have switched to Friday to Friday. I have gone to GoldenHook Camp on Gullrock for thirty years. Hears how they do it. Check in is technically Sat. morning at 0700 and checkout is the following Friday at 0800-0900. They allow us to arrive Friday night preferably after 8:00PM. Positives 1) Drive during daylight hours Friday. 12 hrs. for me. 2) Hardly any border wait. 3) No problem seeing moose 4) Good nights sleep 5) Fishing by 0800 Saturday morning Negatives 1) Extra day off work 2) Chances are you are leaving Friday after the day of work you try to save. Drive in dark, Can't see moose. I will gladly burn one more day of vacation to drive during the day at a moderate pace and get a good nights sleep before a great week of fishing."
3645914,camp chef,2015-03-13 09:37:00,915,We always pick a place that lets us come Friday to Friday. It just works out better for our group.
3654178,bigwillies,2015-03-15 22:02:00,515,"arent't holidays,holidays?.book youre time off and it is what it is.why can't u book those days from work?"
3654506,John N,2015-03-16 06:39:00,362,"Now how can you be a Carnhzkr from Cedar Rapids?? Been going to The Old Post Lodge for many years on Lake St. Joseph, their prearranged trip arrival times never quite linked up with what we wanted. So.... we asked about arriving on Sunday afternoon, departing the following Saturday morning. No problem, they've been glad to accommodate. If you haven't done so already, might be worth checking to see if a lodge will rearrange dates to fit your schedule. John p.s. - Also enjoy watching Nebraska's success, except when they play the Hawks. There was a time when Tom Osborne could have been President of the Universe."
3654754,Gregking,2015-03-16 08:03:00,2658,I do a lot of Friday to Friday at witchbay camps on LOTW
3664202,Carnhzkr,2015-03-18 15:09:00,964,"Sorry, I don't understand your point. All I'm saying is, there are four lodges in this corner of Lac Seul, all within about a driver and an eight iron from each other: Scout Bay, Onaway, Fisherman's Cove, Lac Seul Lodge. They're all nice lodges and pretty comparable to one another, but each has its subtle advantages and disadvantages that set it apart from the others. With the exception of Onaway, they all book from Sat to Sat. So when I'm trip planning and get out my spreadsheet and make checks in the Pro or Con column for each, right off the bat I have to give Onaway a bold check in the Con column. My point is that since the majority (though not all) of potential clients work a traditional M - F work week, those people would need to sacrifice an additional day of their precious vacation to choose Onaway over the others. Could I take an additional day? Sure, I have 25 to use, but why should I? I can just choose one of the other fine lodges instead. I guess that's why Baskin Robbins has 32 flavors of ice cream. Not everyone likes vanilla and not everyone prefers to book from Sat - Sat. It must work for them, since they're booked pretty solid all year."
