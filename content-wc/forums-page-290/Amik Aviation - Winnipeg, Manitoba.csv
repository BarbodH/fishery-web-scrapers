3668154,LoDo,2015-03-19 12:11:00,721,Chimo Air. We have always had good luck with them.
3669754,lassh,2015-03-19 17:35:00,553,"I've flown 3 times with Blue Waters out of Bissett and have nothing bad to say about them. They are organized, they hustle and they keep you informed. Bissett is about 3 hours from Winnipeg. If they fly out of Pine Falls/Powerview, thats about an hour and a half out of Winnipeg. From Bissett, its a 30 minute flight or less to Woodland Caribou area. Good luck!"
3657154,zeebee,2015-03-16 19:20:00,1144,"Suppose I might pose the question differently..... are you trying to achieve the quickest route , the most cost/time effective or simply the least expensive?I am not a plane enthusiast by any definition....just lived/fished/hunted up here a while."
3657178,LoDo,2015-03-16 19:22:00,721,After looking into both planes I have a hard time believing we'll be flying on the amphibian.
3657210,zeebee,2015-03-16 19:26:00,1144,yeah....why fly a frog when there are Beavers out there.... as Canadians wee we be eccentric in our honesty....you Americans are too trepidation
3657322,Blue Lk,2015-03-16 19:48:00,269,Have you considered flying to I falls then driving north?
3657450,LoDo,2015-03-16 20:15:00,721,"Quote: Originally Posted by Blue LkHave you considered flying to I falls then driving north?We have done that before. Getting there is easy. 5hrs of driving through nice country. The problem is we can't get back to Int Falls in time for their last flight that would get us back to Denver. Honestly, this Winnipeg idea is only $350 more added to the trip with zero driving. Door to door fly-in trip from Denver to Woodland Caribou in less than 7hrs. Thats pretty good!"
3657610,pjshorthorn,2015-03-16 20:54:00,5654,"That's a wrap in my book. A rental vehicle would be at least $350.00 and most likely more for the week. But then again, it isn't my money to spend. PjShorthorn."
3661522,Skywagon,2015-03-17 19:41:00,1106,"Just flew out of Denver this morning, that $350 probably isn't much more than the cost of the toll road to the airport"
3666066,Mike Borger,2015-03-19 05:20:00,1554,"My suggestion would be to find a suitable outfitter who flies direct out of Winnipeg if you want to cut your travel time down.There's all kinds of outfitters, everything from 5 star far north lodges to basic outpost camps.These guys might be a good option, I've heard great things about their outpost camps and their airbase is 10 mins north of Winnipeg airport. You could easily get a cab or airport shuttle to the jump off point.http://www.saslodge.com/index.php/our-lakes/apisko-lake"
3666490,spoonchucker,2015-03-19 07:33:00,82,Mike makes sense. The most incredible pike trip I ever had was Edmund lake Manitoba - the outpost for Elk Island Lodge. Take a commercial flight to Winnipeg and then you are set. Here is the website that details our trip as reported in the magazine article.http://www.onthewater.com/canadian-d...-pike-fishing/ If that link does not work just google Canadian Dream Pike fishing. I have also flown in to Winnipeg many times and rented a Van and driven to Silver Falls or Pine Dock and flown in to some great walleye/Pike lakes.

3655898,LoDo,2015-03-16 14:26:00,721,"Anyone ever used this float plane outfitter out of Winnipeg? Our lake is within Woodland Caribou Prov Park. In the past we have always flown to Minneapolis, drive to Red Lake and use Chimo to get to our lake. We are seriously contemplating using Amik out of Winnipeg. This option replaces our Minneapolis to Red Lake drive. HUGE! Any experience, recommendations, etc.. regarding Amik would be greatly appreciated."
3656082,zeebee,2015-03-16 14:49:00,1144,"I reside in Winnipeg but to be frank, this is the first time the outfit has been brought to my attention. They appear to cater largely to the 1st Nations community however do offer charter services with both pontoon and amphibious aircraft...you already know this tho. All air services are Federally regulated and are under strict guidelines likely similar to standards you would find in the US. and likely to higher standards than those imposed on outfitters.Do the math and factor in the convenience then decide. Im sure they are a professional operation.By the way, if you have room for one more.....i might be quite easily courted...how else are you gonna get grub/beverages for the trip.......just sayin."
3656226,LoDo,2015-03-16 15:28:00,721,"ha! Love where your head is. We'll see if we can squeeze one more within the group. Question, do you have a list of other floatplane outfitters with good feedback that you would recommend? Thanks again!!"
3656242,zeebee,2015-03-16 15:32:00,1144,"There are a couple outta Riverton, Lac du Bonnet, Bisset and Grand Rapids Ive used.....give me a day or two and i'll PM you. I can arrange group transport to either venue from Wpg International too...just sayin How large a group and whats the name of the lake so I can approximate air miles."

3656338,zeebee,2015-03-16 16:07:00,1144,Jackson Outpost aka as Adventure Air. Flown with them once outta Lac du Bonnett which is 1.5 hrs hr east of Wpg.Blue Water Aviation out of Bissett and Pine Falls. Flown 2x with them.Both operations fleet Otters on float which would readily accommodate your group size and are within an hour and a half drive heading NE which is the direction you want to be going anyways.Either base would eliminate about 300 air miles (based on two round trips) in expense.http://jacksonslodge.com/adv_air.htmlhttp://www.virtualnorth.net/bwateraviation/
3656666,bthomas3333,2015-03-16 17:39:00,465,Do you have any idea what the charter would cost you? I am very interested in saving the same drive.
3656698,zeebee,2015-03-16 17:45:00,1144,"You pay on a per air mile basis x2 so that the planes return trip is covered. The rate varies based on the size of the plane required.A Cessna 172 will take in 3; a 185 4; Beaver 6; Otter....10+ depending if single or twin.Gear weight is a factor as is distance since the latter translates into more fuel and less weight allowance for gear/passengers.Best to contact the above outfitters.We use to do a lot of moose hunts on this basis.........paying only for the flights and setting upa tent camp. Canoe was lashed onto the pontoon struts. Saved a bundle eliminating an outfitter from the equation. Great experience.You can charter a plane onto any lake deemed by the pilot as safe to land/takeoff.The Cdn charters have an incredible safety record...you risk more driving to work every day or, getting married."
3657026,LoDo,2015-03-16 18:52:00,721,"I was quoted $4594.80 roundtrip for 6 fisherman, 464 total miles. Price was quoted in Canadian currency. The plane is a 9 passenger caravan Amphibian."
