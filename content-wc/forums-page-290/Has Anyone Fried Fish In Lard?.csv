I use it once in awhile to change up, it does have a better flavor for fried chicken, pie crust, sweet rolls, have never used for fish. It is available in grocery stores, I find it around the meat section. Wal-Mart has it in the baking section where I live. I have had chicken fried by Lard around the PA/Ohio/WV region over the years, and that was their specialty."
3661546,MikeinMN,2015-03-17 19:58:00,190,"I guess I didn't know lard was used so often in eastern European cooking (Polish and Lithuanian in this post). It is available in a green and white plastic bucket at most Wal-Mart stores and made by Armour Foods. Look near the cooking oils or in the Mexican foods aisle, likely on the bottom shelf. Manteca is the Hispanic term for lard. Slow fried pork carnitas using lard as mentioned earlier are incredibly good. I've never finished them on the grill, I slow fry for about an hour then turn up the heat. It's a very different cooking process. Don't really know if fish are that much better in lard, but pie crust definitely is."

3651402,kzoofisher,2015-03-15 07:31:00,5144,"As others have said, lard has many wonderful uses. Recent studies have revealed that a low fat, high carb diet is as bad or worse than a high fat diet so use moderation in both directions. I use lard to make carnitas, pork slow cooked in lard. Traditionally it is done with cuts that are difficult to work with otherwise; I just use a shoulder. Seasoned with Mexican spices like cumin or achiote, plenty of garlic and onion, no chiles. Or I'll leave off the Mexican flavors and do it with rosemary. Pull the meat and drain thoroughly before finishing on the grill. Let the height of the flames be your guide for draining, over 18"" and you didn't drain enough. If you want to be very fancy and European do something similar with duck or goose and call it confit. Lard is a great addition to beans (baked or refried), pastries (in place of butter), roasted root vegetables and as a starter for frying fatty items. Keeps forever in the fridge but spoils quickly after use. Available everywhere around here. Often labeled manteca on one side."

Here are the facts. First of all the lard was not, as I expected, in the refrigerated section. It was over on the shelves with the cooking oils. The package says ""store in a cool, dry, place"". It was packaged in a one pound box, like butter, and had a ""sell by date"" of Nov. 2015. It cost of $1.87 per pound which I think is pretty competitive with the other options. The package contains a one pound block of lard not 4 quarters like butter. Here are the nutrition facts from a bottle of Canola Oil, Butter, and Lard. I'm not a doctor or nutritionist, but it doesn't look like one is much better or worse than the other. Calories from fat, per serving: Lard: 120 Butter: 100 Canola: 120 Total fat: Lard: 13g - 20% Saturated Fat 5g Butter: 11g - 17% Saturated Fat 7g Canola: 14g - 22% Saturated Fat 1g Cholesterol: Lard: 10mg 3% Butter: 30mg 10% Canola: 0mg 0% Sodium: Lard: 0mg 0% Butter: 90mg 4% Canola: 0mg 0%"

I found that the ""smoking temperature"" of the lard seemed to be a little lower than the canola oil I normally use. I cook in an electric fry pan set at 360. I found the lard was smoking at that setting and turned it down to 350. It also seemed to spatter more than canola oil. I tried to do everything the way I would with canola and it seems to be a little messy when I cleaned up and it did spatter more as the fillets were added. All in all, I don't see that the lard made a big difference, but it didn't hurt anything either. I'm out of walleye fillets, but I think the gills were a fair test."

The staples included lard which we used initially to fry our daily meals of fish, and it did taste great. Maybe our constitutions were not used to the grease as the gut would rumble most of the evening. I do have to say the lard did make some of the best popcorn I ever had. And that was without butter."

3648450,zeebee,2015-03-14 07:26:00,1144,"You're Cdn and you havent fried fish in lard???? By far the best medium for frying. Key is to get it nice and hot...just at smoking point then, turn the heat down slightly after the fish is introduced. Rest on paper towels if you prefer to absorb some of the grease. Had my in laws visit when I was 1st married and took them fishing. They had never been fishing before but loved to eat fish. Was my first posting as a banker in a glorious place called Manitoulin Island..North Channel of Georgian Bay We caught a mess of nice perch and when I fried them up, it was in lard. They declared it was the best fish they had ever had and asked me how I prepared it. Didnt tell them it was lard.....they were Jewish and it wouldn't have gone well."

So, once I find someone selling pure lard that has not been hydrogenated (which is available at Amazon) how much do you use to fry fish? Normally I like to avoid the hassle of flipping the fish so I usually have the oil deep enough to drop the fish and or fries into. That said I have no idea how much lard is needed to do this. I assume it melts to the same volume as regular oil but am not really sure. Any advise would be greatly appreciated.Take care,Ruddiger"
3648778,zeebee,2015-03-14 08:47:00,1144,Use it as you would any other oil...just make sure its good and hot before laying in the fillets and dont put too many pieces in at once.....do small batches.

That's why major restaurant chains stopped using lard. For our group, we do one shore lunch with lard. I buy a small container of lard at a local Mexican theme grocery store as there I can get the size container I want. Price per pound versus vegetable shortening is quite similar I'm thinking. As our group gets older, we are now trying to eat a bit healthier. As such, we are now trying shorelunch eps with extra virgin olive oil in the fry pan."

I'm convinced it will taste better. Lard sandwich recipe: Smear lard on two slices of bread. Eat.

I think a case was 24 1-pound packages. My grandfather was told not to come home without the Tenderflake lard or it would be his last trip to Canada My grandmother used Tenderflake for pie crusts and it was ""sworn"" to be the reason that the crusts came out so flaky. To date, my wife uses the same lard ( when we can get it )and pie crust receipe. I would think that fish would be outstanding as well.

3645706,Algoma Guy,2015-03-13 09:04:00,48,Mike I believe you are right. In my experience I have found if lard is at the right temperature it does not soak into the fillets like other oils.

The guides said years ago that most oils are ""fizzy"", whatever that means. Lard isn't the healthiest thing to use, but we only do three or so shore lunches each season. We use canola oil at home when making fried fish. The guides that taught me to do shore lunches typically had the lard fairly deep in the pan. They would put the coated fish into the lard with the skin side down. This keeps the fillet straight, rather than curling. They gently rocked the pan back and forth, such that the hot lard would go over the top of the fish and cook it from the top as well as the bottom. The fish was done when the coating was golden and the fillet would stay intact when stuck and lifted with a big fork.Just writing the previous paragraph has me anxious for my next shore lunch!
