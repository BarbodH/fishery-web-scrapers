3672266,dog2,2015-03-20 10:13:00,198,"3 years ago water level was way low ,we had trouble moving from the river up to Ogoki.We had company on the river from the the other cabin 1 maybe2 times during the week mainly on the evening bite at inflow to Kaydeon.But during the week we had the lower river to ourselves.Last July the water was lapping at the cabin door. I have Kaydeon on my return list!"
3663850,vteye,2015-03-18 13:39:00,812,Wondering if one time dave is still active? I have not heard back from AWO left a couple messages and no response to emails. I presume they are some place warm this time of year. Anyone been in touch with Christine lately? Thanks
3664034,Mike Borger,2015-03-18 14:29:00,1554,"All I can tell you is they recently sold Hebner and another camp to another outfitter.Beyond that it's show season right now, that probably why they're hard to reach."
3664242,vteye,2015-03-18 15:22:00,812,Our first Ont. trip was to Kayedon 2013 and looking forward to the return.
3664826,rocko0305,2015-03-18 18:12:00,138,"Not trying to hijack your thread, but since you mentioned Kayedon, I was wondering if you saw any other boats during the week on Kayedon or Ogoki? I know Leuenberger's has an outpost a mile or so away from the Kayedon AWO outpost, and there are a few on Ogoki as well. Just curious...Thanks in advance."
3665794,chris.brock,2015-03-18 21:38:00,112,"not to hijack, but I've been to Ogoki twice. There's at least 4 outposts and 1 private camp on Ogoki, and 2 outposts on Kaydon. That said, it's still a huge lake. We saw the odd boat cruise by at a distance, but never felt crowded at all. Great lake. I would recommend it and I would love to go back."
3665874,dog2,2015-03-18 21:57:00,198,"talked to Remi last week said it was vacation time for his family returning next week sometime,hope this helps you."
3666322,rocko0305,2015-03-19 06:55:00,138,Much appreciated Chris! Our group has always been interested in Kayedon.
3666482,onetimedave,2015-03-19 07:31:00,502,"Christine and Remi (AWO) are downsizing and in the retirement stage. They have kept only two camps, Melchett and Kayedon. Sold the rest. At this time they are not in Nakina but back the first part of April. Talked with them this past Monday. Said bookings very good. Exchange rate has helped. They also have not raised their rates for 2015."
3666762,vteye,2015-03-19 08:24:00,812,Thank you - glad they got out of Nakina for a couple weeks. 2nd Chris - Ogoki and kayedon are fishable from any of the camps. Big watershed with a lot of differrent types of fishing available. We fished next to one other boat for an hour and other than seeing another boat 5 miles away felt like we had the place to ourselves.
3671834,onetimedave,2015-03-20 08:22:00,502,"If ""U"" are considering Kayedon don't go in the late summer as water might be down. This makes travel very dangerous. My brother was there in late summer and he said they had a tough time. Our group was there in late May and water was OK."
