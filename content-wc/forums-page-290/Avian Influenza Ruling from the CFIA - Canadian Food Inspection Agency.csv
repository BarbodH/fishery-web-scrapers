The states include Kansas, California, Oregon ,Idaho, Arkansas, Missouri, Washington and Minnesota.The link is:www.inspection.gc.ca/animalsI won't even bring up for discussion how it could be viewed if a live chicken flew all the way from Minnesota and landed in Canadian waters for a well deserved rest. Could that be considered a new AIS ( Avian Influenza Situation ) issue ....In all seriousness, thought I would pass this info along for all of you egg and poultry lovers who may be planning on transporting those products for your pilgramage to the fishing promised land this year.PjShorthorn"
3661026,zeebee,2015-03-17 17:22:00,1144,No different than the USA banning all Canadian beef/bison for two years after a single cow was diagnosed with mad cow disease in Alberta. What if that cow had flown back with the chicken?Yup took two years for the CDN beef farmers to finally get the US courts to overrule the ban....it was initially upheld by a judge in Montana....go figure.During that time not a single life was lost to mad cow but 20000 were killed by handguns...
