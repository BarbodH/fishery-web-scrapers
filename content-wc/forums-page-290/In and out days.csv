How many folks go to a lodge/resort/camp that provides the ability to stay shorter on longer periods? Say you want to arrive on a Thursday, have the rest of that week and all of the next and leave on a Saturday? Do you choose or seek camps that will do that or do you just take this week or that week? I stay at a camp and arrive on a Thursday and leave on a Tuesday. Seems like it allows me to take advantage of the weekend off work, have a shorter week on both ends while AT work, and doesn't leave me hanging at home with nothing to do as I would in a Saturday to Saturday week. What say you?"
3668034,LoDo,2015-03-19 11:52:00,721,"We do a private camp and do Wed to Wed. Its a fly-in and allows us to miss the weekend crowds. We are able to depart Chimo Air out of Red Lake by 10a, no questions! I've done fly-ins Sat to Sat and didn't get into camp until 5-6p at night."

3669786,maddogg,2015-03-19 17:40:00,178,"Check with the outfitter some times they give you a deal if the party in before you goes out mid week. It's cheaper for him to fly you in when he takes the other guys out, than to make two trips."
3670162,Walleye_Guru,2015-03-19 19:31:00,62,"In our case, we run Saturday to Saturday so we try to book between Sats. If you come in on a Thursday and leave on a Monday, it impacts two weeks and makes the scheduling almost impossible. This wasn't our design, it's just worked that way over the years so we haven't touched it. We do, from time to time, have guests leave early or arrive late. In that case, we are always looking to fill partials and can offer a discount if the situation is right. Another thing to think about is a post Labor Day excursion. Fishing is as good as it gets, but industry wide there is a slow down. There can be a lot of flexibility among lodges during this time frame."
3670210,AllenW,2015-03-19 19:45:00,11482,"Our trips to Red Lake were always late Sept and for many years we stayed at a camp site and there were sometimes one or two other groups. Many times we were the only ones, so we could pick our days, usually 7 or 10 days, even when we went to resorts in later years, time of year made picking days easier than during the tourist season. al"
3670386,Aspencreek,2015-03-19 20:29:00,2911,"There are camps that will allow you to that as long as they don't have the cabin already booked. I was able to do a short week with my grandson a few years ago before he had to go off to school. BUT, I was able to do it only because the camp had an empty cabin that week. But what you are asking, arriving a day or two early and then extending it a couple days would mean that they have the cabin open both the week ahead and after the week you are reserving, for camps that aren't that busy it may work. Another reason I was able to do it was because it was one of the last weeks of the season and had the open cabin, AND the whole trip was put together in about 2 weeks, so the camp owner was pretty sure they were not going to book it.If your camping it might be a different story, but the thing you have to remember, they DEFINATELY want to book by the full week, not partials. The season is short for camp owners and they are running a camp not a hotel. If you want a hotel book one of those."
