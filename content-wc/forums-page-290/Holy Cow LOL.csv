3655690,MrSimon,2015-03-16 13:44:00,922,That's insane. I'll take my $10k used Suburban 2500 any day of the week .... thing pulls like a mule and nothing ever goes wrong with it.

A good friend of mine with a small hobby-farm in MI had not 1 but TWO Lincoln Navigators as farm vehicles,,,,,,,, Such an abuse of the tax laws. HRG"
