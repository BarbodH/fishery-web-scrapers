3664642,55walleyes,2015-03-18 17:15:00,131,i am thinking about trying a drift sock. How big a hassle are they? Do they get in the way? Anybody really like them or dislike them?
3664722,retire55,2015-03-18 17:31:00,1029,"Our fishing group does most of it walleye fishing using camp tiller boats at outfitters. I personally prefer to back troll and when I want to present a slower presentation, I ask my fishing partner to deploy my drift sock off the bow. My drift sock can usually reduce my speed by at least 0.5 mph and its no trouble to use in this configuration."
3665058,guidedfishing,2015-03-18 18:57:00,531,"Depends on what you want to use it for. If its to slow a drift then off one of the front cleats. If its to slow your trolling speed then the only safe place is from the bow as mentioned. Never put your drift sock off a back cleat that is a guarantee untangle or worse job. If you use it to troll understand that your boat will be very sluggish to respond to helm, the sock will deploy under the boat if going forward and out the front if back trolling. I really not sure why you would need a drift sock to back troll, but know that steer takes on a new meaning with a drift sock out. Most folks use them when they don't have a kicker or trolling motor and they just want to slow down the speed on the main motor. Other things that can help as well if you don't want to use a drift sock. Is lower the front anchor a few feet, or put your electric trolling motor down and turn it side ways, or trim up your trolling motor. All this items will gain you a few 1/10ths of a mph. good luck, Its always handy to have a drift sock stowed in the front of the boat."

3666034,BornToFish,2015-03-19 04:50:00,1224,"Guidedfishing made me chuckle when he said ""steer takes on a whole new meaning"" or something like that. He hit the nail square on the head. I always have a drift sock in the boat, but quite honestly don't use it that often. Backtrolling for walleyes is far easier and less complicated than using the drift sock - at least for me. I do use the drift sock from time to time, but most always when targeting pike or muskies. The netman has to be on top of his game in terms of knowing when to bring the drift sock into the boat, such that it doesn't interfere with bringing the fish to the net. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3666450,Thumpr50,2015-03-19 07:23:00,139,"Have 3 of them in the boat, different sizes for different situations, can save alot of frustration when dealing with the wind. Have used them for live bait presentations for walleyes and on drifts casting for muskies. Takes a little time to learn to be efficient with them, but worth it. View them as a valuable tool in my boat."
3666666,bigwalleye1,2015-03-19 08:15:00,2632,"They take up so little room, and can be an invaluable asset when the wind is blowing. I've got the lightweight nylon ones with sinkers on one side and floaters in the other side of the opening. Drift Control brand. The rope almost takes up more room. Deploy off the bow. I bring my own boat, so I have stern and bow electrics as well, but on a fly-in, this would be a definite go."
3667754,last chance,2015-03-19 11:17:00,3262,"I do most of my trolling on erie and used a trolling plate to slow me down for many yrs. then a couple of yrs ago I found a set of 36"" trolling bags laying in the middle of the road. I tried to find the owner but had no luck. so one day I decided to try them. they are a little more trouble to put out than using my trolling plate. I use both bags 1 on each side of the bow. I think they are better than a trolling plate. you have better boat control and if the wind is blowing they help keep your speed constant. if your trolling I recommend 2 bags 1 off each side. using 1 bag will keep pulling you to one side and would really make steering a pain. if you are back trolling I see no reason to use a bag. more trouble than it would be worth. if your trolling forward and you need to slow down then contact amish outfitters and give them your set up and speed you want to run and they can recommend the size bags you need. im using the 36"" bags on my 21' cobia open bow which makes it easy to deploy the bags. then we let them back to under our rod holders and they never get in our way fishing off the back of the boat. keep us posted on what you do and how it works for you."
3667962,sptrix,2015-03-19 11:44:00,175,"I would be in a boat without one. We use 1, sometimes 2, regularly to slow drift over deep water for lake trout. They're super easy to use, take up next-to-no room and are quickly deployed."
