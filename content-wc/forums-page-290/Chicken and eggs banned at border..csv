I caught more and better fish from the dock those years than I did all week in that remote lake. Then I asked myself ""Why am I flying off the premier walleye water in north America to spend a week in a ""rustic"" cabin, driving a smoking 15hp rowboat, across the lake into the wind both ways (at least it seemed that way) and paying more for the honor of it."" Now I drive to the door of the cabin, cabins are nicer than most houses I go into, Lund outfitters with 50hp Hondas and electronics, bait, hot showers and flush toilets and a million dollar view from the screen front porch, and after 10 yrs. I'm still paying less than that 1st trip cost me."

3655730,plumberjoe,2015-03-16 13:54:00,54,"From the CBC on March 12th. Canadian cross-border shoppers are being warned to watch what they put in their grocery basket, after the federal government issued a ban on raw poultry products and live birds from six American states due to concerns over avian flu. Avian flu detected in Fraser Valley backyard chicken coop B.C. avian flu virus has Asian origin new to North America The restriction extends to any poultry products or by-products that are not fully cooked, including eggs and raw pet foods if they were sourced, processed or packaged in, or shipped from Minnesota, Missouri, California, Idaho, Oregon or Washington. Canadians returning from the U.S. are prohibited from bringing these items into Canada. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has issued the restrictions to protect Canadian poultry from an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry populations in those states. Examples of items under the restriction include: Live birds and hatching eggs. Eggs. Yolks. Egg whites (albumen). Poultry meat (other than fully cooked, canned, commercially sterile meat products). Raw pet foods containing poultry products. Feathers. Poultry manure and litter. Laboratory material containing poultry products/by-products. Live pet birds may be brought into Canada with official certification from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Commercial imports of live poultry, birds and raw or untreated avian products are restricted from the specific quarantine zones within the six states until further notice."

3658610,Mark R,2015-03-17 07:25:00,1538,which was banned 1st the chicken or the egg?

3660042,Aspencreek,2015-03-17 12:58:00,2911,"We have been doing that for the last 10 yrs. Nice place, good selection, great bakery, and reasonable. And the groceries only take up space in the vehicles on the way up to camp, instead of all the way from home. Added bonus: If you pay with a CC you get the better exchange rate."
3660386,SinOrSwim,2015-03-17 14:10:00,1528,"Just make sure you plan for space and containers to put your food in. Pain in the neck having plastic shopping bags flying around and spilling. Also, when unloading the truck. I remember when we flew in. We would stop and buy groceries up there. First couple years a random plastic safeway bag was coming off the plane. LOL You could see the dock guys roll their eyes. LOL"
