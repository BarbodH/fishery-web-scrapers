I can customize packages based on pretty much any customer preferences like boat, gas, bait, shore lunch etc. My goal is to provide a fishing experience tailored to your wishes."
3642258,MOfish,2015-03-12 11:41:00,39,"I was wondering if anyone had a guide referral for a day on Lac Seul. We will be fishing out of Onaway beginning Saturday, July 25th. Blair and Kathy commented they have a hard time finding a decent guide for just a day. We were just wanting someone to get us started on a fishing pattern early in the week. We could then fish on our own after we learned from the guide."
3643218,Whopper,2015-03-12 15:28:00,340,I don't know where Onaway is but hands down I would contact Ben Beatty
3643234,SinOrSwim,2015-03-12 15:32:00,1528,Wrong side of the lake. He and Colin do not go to the west side. I tried.
3643578,Whopper,2015-03-12 18:02:00,340,Good to know I would love to spend a day in Ben's boat. If I ever get to Lac Seul it will happen
3643682,rather-be-fishin,2015-03-12 18:49:00,429,Try searching Prov1800 on this site or call 1-807-227-2438. According to other post APRIL 2014 he guides on Lac Seul NW Ear Falls end. It is a very good idea to get a guide early in the trip to learn safe travel routes to avoid hazards & also fishing techniques & areas where they are biting. Then the rest of your week will be a blast! Our group will be up there at the same time staying at Fishermans Cove resort in Scout Bay just around the point from Onaway. See you on the water! RBF
3644802,SinOrSwim,2015-03-13 06:16:00,1528,"Also, since the lodge does not provide guides, even though the site says they do, you will likely have to hire a private guide for more than one day. When you contact them, I would try to get 2 to 3 days and I think you will have better luck finding someone. Good advice to contact Prov1800. He was a great help to us answering questions and giving some options."
3644850,Mike Borger,2015-03-13 06:24:00,1554,"Was going to suggest Ben, but you guys beat me to it.Fishing with Ben on Lac Seul is on my own personal bucket list. I had the chance to take him steelheading for a day several years back and he's a heck of a nice guy and a great angler to boot."
3646858,BenBeattie,2015-03-13 14:58:00,232,"Thanks for the kind words guys. I would also endorse ProV1800 - I've met him and he knows the west end of the lake.This will be my 11th season on LS and I've never been to Either end of the lake (Ear Falls or Adamhay). That's how big it is. For guides in June/July and August, you'd better book early. I have nothing available in those months. FYI - I've got some awesome dates in May and that's when we catch the Big girls on this part of LS. Send me a message or visit benbeattieoutdoors.com for more info. Thanks!"
3647954,rnnonmt,2015-03-13 22:19:00,992,"Ben, where can we find your rates? What does it cover? Daily, weekly, time of season? Your boat or customers boat? Love the musky video with Johnny Cash's ""when the man comes around"" by the way!"
3648114,prov1800,2015-03-14 05:29:00,5010,Thx for the recommendation guys.phone number has changed.anyone needing to get a hold of me can do so at. 1-807-220-0860.
