3663586,slimedart,2015-03-18 12:13:00,55,I am going to be up there the middle to end of June. My dad has never caught a lake trout he is a hard core walleye guy. I am not very experienced for lake trout either. Can someone here help me out as to where to start an what I should be looking for to get him into one. I am not looking for spots just general tips to point me in the right direction. Also are there lake trout in White Otter?
3664730,Skywagon,2015-03-18 17:33:00,1106,"There are many ways to fish for trout in open water, downriggers, lead line, jigging, ect. You might want to research it and ask the camp owner what is most popular there. Yes, White Otter has some nice trout, have fished it in the winter, but never in open water. The trip between the two lakes looks interesting, but I have only seen it from the air."
3664898,Beer King,2015-03-18 18:34:00,146,"Have not fished Clearwater but lots of experience on White Otter that time of the year- Yes, it does have very good lake trout fishing. I would expect the pattern on both lakes is much the same. You are probably staying at Browns - I'm sure they can provide better info than me but will offer the following. That time of year we fish trout down 30-40ft using down riggers and a variety of spoons. You will mark fish throughout the water column but that depth always seems best. Usually fishing over 60-100ft plus depths. Maybe 50' of line behind down rigger ball and troll 2-2.5mph - vary speed and make periodic S turns to trigger hits. Its a pretty simple process and a lot of fun. Fish are usually pretty cooperative. You may want to run around a bit to mark some fish before you drop lines but its often just a matter of covering water until you do. Lake trout are in all areas of the lake - you are never far from deep water. There are other ways to get spoons too that depth but its easy with down riggers. Another option is to use electronics to find fish (or baitfish clouds - fish will be in the area) and vertical jig with 1-2oz bucktail jigs, tube baits, sonic blade baits, etc. A piece of meat on buck tail or tube usually helpful. Whites and yellows are good colors. Often fishing a specific fish or group of them - need jigs heavy enough to get down in mostly vertical fashion. Then pronounced snap jigging. Don't need big tackle - a medium to medium heavy bait caster works well. Its a fun a way to get em - but not easy to do if there is too much wind. You're gonna love it there - to die for scenery, crystal clear water and many beautiful sand beaches. Hope his helps. Dan"
3668402,slimedart,2015-03-19 13:03:00,55,I do have access to downriggers but have not used them for trout. Any spoons you would recommend?
3668530,Beer King,2015-03-19 13:26:00,146,"Sorry, tackle stored away with boat and I can't recall specific spoons. Don't need anything special - have caught many on cheap yellow/red dot daredevil knock offs. Silver with blue, and watermelon kinds of colors also good. Don't need big/heavy spoons. Retailer should be able to point you to popular trout spoons. Good Luck Dan"
