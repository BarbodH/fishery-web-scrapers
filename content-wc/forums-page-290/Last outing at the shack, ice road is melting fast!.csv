This will be the last time as it is coming off tomorrow, the ice road is deteriorating quickly, tomorrow and the next day its forecast to be +14C. All catch and release but its good to get jack practising using the fish finder and setting the hook. We got a bunch of small ones and Jack got a beauty 19""er as we were just about to shut up shop. It was a 'pyjama day' at school, so thats what Jack is wearing out on the ice, PJ ice fishing, love it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAC6dLsZT-0"
