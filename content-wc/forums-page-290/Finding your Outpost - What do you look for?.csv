3645690,adempsey,2015-03-13 09:02:00,963,"I am curious, when you are looking for a new lake to spend a week on, what are the most important things you look for?I assume outfitter reputation, fish species, price and location are the given things. Are there any other features that make or break a particular outpost?Size of the lake?Number of Portages?Within a Provincial Park?On a river system?Virgin waters? Repeat guest?Trophy potential vs. numbers?Other camps/lodge on the lake?Distance from the air base?""Remoteness"" or location?Person capacity/size of the cabin?Electricity?Running water?Toilet?Boat/motors?Bunks vs. standalone beds?Guides?Food included?My preference would be for a remote and isolated outpost, on a larger sized lake or a lake on a river system with reliable boats and motors (of the appropriate size for the lake). I can easily live without the amenities like running water and electricity as long as the fishing makes up for it. My father on the other hand, won't go anywhere without a real toilet, lol!"
3645858,Mike Borger,2015-03-13 09:27:00,1554,My criteria if I have a choice are:-Large body of water-Quality of the fishery - I prefer a lake with trophy potential-Single cabin outpost - I prefer being alone.-Quality of the camp and boats - a nice cabin and good equipment is a plus.If I can find a camp that meets or exceeds those criteria I'm a happy man.
3645970,oleJoe,2015-03-13 09:45:00,114,"Lake 4000 acres only cabin with running water, pump is fine and a shower is a real bonus. Boats that don't leak and good running motors. But first there better be good fishing. Everything else we can make do."
3646138,chris.brock,2015-03-13 10:13:00,112,I like a large body of water where I can explore new water everyday. Things I would consider a bonus- other species like lakers or especially brookies portage lakes or the possibility to create our own portage lakes with a canoe or lining a boat around rapids
3646154,SinOrSwim,2015-03-13 10:25:00,1528,"Doesn't a large body of water have its pros and cons. Most outposts have smaller boats and motors. Getting to spots takes forever. Plus, tough in rough conditions. Personally, we look at accomodations. We want indoor toilets, shower, solar, frig/freezer and running water. I'll sacrifice some fishing success to not ""rough it"". Within reason of course. Still has to be a good fishery. Now a days it seems like almost everyone has the amenities because they are keeping up with the competition. Also, as a group that always went up in August or September, rock guards for the motor was important. We had good motors and props when we got there vs having them all dinged up."
3646226,rocko0305,2015-03-13 10:42:00,138,"For the most part, these are our group's preferences:Large lake (to us, this means 2,500+ acres I'd say. Although recently, the past few lakes we have been on have been 5,000+ acres). Not only for exploration and so we aren't fishing the same spots over and over, but a larger lake gives the best chance at multiple trophies in my opinionOnly cabin on the lakePrice under $1,500 CAD (seems like there are a lot of camps that are just slightly out of our preferred price range once you add taxes)Walleyes in quantity (personally, I'd rather have quality though)Pike in quality (I'm trophy huntin')This is more of a personal preference that's important to me, but I want a lake that has interesting features...lots of bays, narrows, islands, points, rock faces, etc. Half the fun to me is looking at the maps before and during the trip, and figuring out a game plan for finding a ton of fish or where the trophies would beMinimum of 9.9 HP motors on the boatsA decent cabin that doesn't leak or is infested with critters. Lack of running water, a shower, and lights are not deal breakers, but they are much preferredSaturday to Saturday trip is preferred, although Sunday to Sunday works as well. Friday to Friday might be an issue.As others have said, an additional species such as brook trout, perch, whitefish, or lake trout would make the lake that much more appealing, and would be a nice bonus.Portage lakes would be another bonus, but not something we specifically look for in a camp.To address some of the other questions that the OP posed:On a river system? Doesn't need to be on river system, but the majority of the places we go are. If on a river system, then we'd prefer to not be there the first 2 weeks due to likely high water in most yearsVirgin waters? NoRepeat guest? NoDistance from the air base? No concern for this really. Farthest we have done is coming up this year to Windsor Lake. In my opinion, when you're about to spend a week on a lake, who cares if the flight is an extra half hour or hour longer than some other lakes.Person capacity/size of the cabin? At least room for 6, but 8 or more would be preferableToilet? Outhouse is fine by usBoat/motors? I mentioned the motors already, but for boats, 14 foot minimum, and 16 foot is preferred. Seats are a nice addition, but we have all recently bought the sitback canoe/stadium seats for camps that don't have seats in the boat. They are light in weight, and work great.Bunks vs. standalone beds? All the camps we've ever been to have had bunks, but standalone beds would be fine tooGuides? No thank youFood included? No thank you. Maybe one day when we go to Kag we will do the Modified plan, but we like bringing and cooking our own mealsBy the way Adam, your website is great. Even though most of the info I already have ingrained in my head, I still like reading it from time to time."
3646322,lassh,2015-03-13 11:27:00,553,"I've been on more than 35 fly-ins over the years since 1978 so based on that experience, I will try to pull together some thoughts. Its kind of hard to list specifics since many of them integrate into the fishing, the comfort, the setting, the cost, the departure location, the species, the equipment and the variety. Its all more or less intuitive now after all those years. There are trade offs among all of these factors, no matter what outpost you go to. The current outpost we go to doesn't have all the characteristics I list but its the overall balance that one has to look at. Large walleye potential and decent action, Trophy pike potential (lake trout availability is a plus but not a major factor) (a kick-*** smallie/musky lake with access to eyes would work as well or trophy laker/pike w eye or grayling) Larger Fly-in lake- This is directly related to large fish potential. Also it should have a variety of structure/habitat so all fish aren't on the same pattern at the same time and there are new areas to explore. Trade-off is often privacy. Flows in and out of lake. Privacy/limited access to others- this competes with the larger lake criterion as large lakes with good fish potential usually have more cabins/boats/outfitters. Functional equipment/comfort-  DC or propane lights (Generator nice but not necessary)  Hot water and shower (don't care about flush toilet)  Refrigerator/freezer capacity (2 propane fridges nice)  Sleeping area separate from eating/kitchen area (separated bedrooms nice to have)  Adequate, good gasoline and propane for week and pilots that check  Functional motors with spare, (props checked by pilot and replacement available)  Boats in excellent repair, backs on seats, good nets, emergency kits  Propane grill  Fish cleaning area (ideal with screened area, water and fridge)  Satellite phone a bonus (in not factor in renting one)  Bug resistant structure- screened openings (vents, windows, doors)  Path to cabin from lake not in swamp or mudhole  Easy docking for boats Fly out location within around 5 hours of Int. Falls, Pigeon River, Pembina. Fast hi capacity planes/short flight (cost factor) Early, predictable departure/pick up times (weather permitting) Cost preferably < 1500 US (again this is related to other factors) Pre-fly beer/water, pre stock potatoes etc. No nickel diming from outfitter"
3648706,SinOrSwim,2015-03-14 08:36:00,1528,"LOL Have you ever found one with thick walls? Or, even walls that go all the way to the ceiling? My brothers father in law snores like crazy and my brother HawkFan talks in his sleep. One here he woke me up yelling..............NICE FISH........OHHhhhhhh That's a nice fish!!!!!! ahhahahaha"
3649682,Draco1206,2015-03-14 15:34:00,175,"I think we had one camp where the separating wall was a log wall, but most are just plywood and don't go all the way to the ceiling. Best year we had a screened porch and he slept out there."
3649690,chris.brock,2015-03-14 15:42:00,112,"I sleep with ear plugs. I know some people find it uncomfortable though. Once they're in, I'm in my own little world and can sleep like a baby and snore like a chainsaw. Hahaha"
3649778,Draco1206,2015-03-14 16:11:00,175,Yeah I sleep with ear plugs in also. And a few adult pops help a lot too.
3651506,SinOrSwim,2015-03-15 07:42:00,1528,We had a bear come onto a screened in porch one year. You would NOT catch me sleeping on a screened in porch. LOL Not a chance!!!! You want to see 6 grown men move like lightning???? Have a bear come in the screen door. Cracks me up just thinking about it. We all ended up in one bedroom huddled together like W T F do we do????
3651618,MrSimon,2015-03-15 08:11:00,922,x2 Ear plugs are on my packing list ABOVE fishing rods.
3651850,Draco1206,2015-03-15 08:53:00,175,"Believe me, no bear would come into our cabin when my brother is snoring. Unless it's a female and she wants to mate with him."
3653434,adempsey,2015-03-15 17:57:00,963,"Thanks, I appreciate that =) Quote: Originally Posted by phishfearme before we went to springpole lake (just south of Birch Lake) we asked the outfitter the first question -answer: there's one other outfitter outpost cabin but it's about 25 miles away on the other side of the lake. a true answer.but what did we find? no less that a dozen private cabins on the lake - people were coming in and out regularly.

An honest outfitter goes a long way if you ask me, and not providing all the information because you don't ask a specific enough question is just as bad as lying.Where are the other camps on Springpole? I think I could see some in the northern basin but couldn't see much else. Aerial photos of that area aren't that great though.I also bring ear plugs. Although, my brother is rather entertaining. He often screams out and has some strangely violent dreams. Lol. He's always cursing at someone."
3646402,Draco1206,2015-03-13 12:02:00,175,I don't have much to add to Rocko's list except thick walls between the bedrooms. My brother snores like a freight train and sometimes carries on a conversation with himself when he's sleeping.
3646530,MrSimon,2015-03-13 13:01:00,922,"Like most, we like to be alone on a good sized lake with great fishing and properly working equipment. That's a given. Other than that, we think long and hard about the ""feel"" of the outpost. Things we look for: Unobstructed panoramic views of the lake Windows that look out on the water Relatively flat ground without too many trees right around the cabin Open space around the cabin with short grass and trimmed weeds if possible A good location for the fire pit It's hard to describe, but we know it when we see it. I won't book a trip to a place unless I can find a fairly recent picture."
3647154,phishfearme,2015-03-13 16:40:00,1242,"we do single cabin outposts for typically 4 guys and like other posters want privacy. so, we ask outfitters if there are any other outfitters on the lake - this is the wrong question. the correct question? are there any other outfitters AND PRIVATE CABINS ON THE LAKE? before we went to springpole lake (just south of Birch Lake) we asked the outfitter the first question -answer: there's one other outfitter outpost cabin but it's about 25 miles away on the other side of the lake. a true answer. but what did we find? no less that a dozen private cabins on the lake - people were coming in and out regularly.
