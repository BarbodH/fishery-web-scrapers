Sandy Beach has a great location and is reasonable. I fished out of Boois and Jim and Traci and that camp are awesome. Bought our own private camp with some buddies near Sioux Lookout so do all my fishing there now. Trout lake will always be my favorite though. 28 +"" eyes, 40+'' Northerns and tons of 8-10 lb lakers on medium tackle(burn up your reels) are the rule here."
