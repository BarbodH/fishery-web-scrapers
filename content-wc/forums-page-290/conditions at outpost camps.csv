3649362,pete kraft,2015-03-14 12:46:00,28,"About ten years age I flew into Kississing's Hassett Lake outpost for fall Lake Trout with my 2 brothers. That was the last trip without mice traps.The place was overrun with the critters and they would snuggle up with us in the bunk at night. Not a good way to wake up with a mouse walking on your face. After dinner for sport we would cut a toothpick in half, prop up a jar on the counter with a piece of cookie under it and tie a piece of fishing line to the toothpick.Didn't bag more than a half dozen or so, but it was great entertainment."

3653026,Golden Eagle,2015-03-15 15:53:00,2642,"An outpost I used had lots of mice. Skunks moved in. Mice left, either eaten or escaped being eaten. Skunks were no problem for us."

3655890,forgop,2015-03-16 14:26:00,880,"Contemplating doing this on all trips from now on. I've read where you can fill the bucket with water to drown them, but perhaps the better way to go is leave it dry and throw them in the lake and see if you get any nice action off the dock. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSk79YcuIRQ"
3656282,unclepaully,2015-03-16 15:50:00,112,Eddie had one of those buckets up at Beteau lake. There would be at least 3 dead mice every morning.
3656290,forgop,2015-03-16 15:53:00,880,Much better than listening to traps.snapping and then the flopping. I awoke to a trap last August and threw it outside.
3656322,pjshorthorn,2015-03-16 16:05:00,5654,Northern bait Bass like a mouse pattern also. The trick is to make sure the mice can swim so as to have a topwater presentation . PjShorthorn
3657570,youngknight,2015-03-16 20:36:00,228,"Have done the mice thing..nothing like waking up with a mouse under your tshirt on your chest. However, here's an experience at a private camp...early spring, go in camp and open cookstove lid to start a fire...two dozen or snakes come - well snaking out- of grooves between burner lids as well as draft...crawling over floor. Garter snakes...but still...then later while lying in bunks with the propane lights on and the cabin warm, snakes sticking their heads out of holes in old logs and chinking. One of the guys would only sleep on the kitchen table. On the plus side...mice were not an issue. In another camp my buddy was with a friend who was very afraid of snakes...open rafters in the camp. My buddy was making supper while his friend was sitting in a chair...open rafters and he kept on feeling a slap on his shoulders. He finally looked around and came face to face with a 4 foot long - although quite harmless - fox snake...that was trying to extend its body to move to the next rafter but kept falling short with the result of its head falling down to hit the friend on his shoulder. Got the snake out of the cabin but when you are deathly afraid of snakes, doesn't make for a good nights sleep."
3646330,Ogoki,2015-03-13 11:30:00,291,"My wife has been on 28 fly in trips with me plus numerous canoe trips. She can handle it a "" little"" rough. She definetly prefers a cabin to tenting but will tent. One lake we went to on a fly in had a rustic log cabin . Not the new machined logs. First night there as soon as the lights went out , we could hear mice . She wasn't happy to say the least. Sounded like they were everywhere. Lights on they got quiet again. Lights off , here they come . Now she can hear them cutting plastic or something. We get up and they were trying to get into the Oreo cookies. We had two plastic tubs with lids for our food , so everything back in the tubs . Lids in place and tubs sitting on the table . Lights off , hear they come again. Lights on and I get the mouse traps out . Learned early on to bring traps . Before the night was over I had caught 17 mice . That trip was a split trip where as we were stying 5 days on one lake and moving for 5 days on another lake . All day , all I heard was about the mice . That evening I get on the radio and next morning we moved to the other lake . ......Just for the record that trip was prior to using Mattice Lake Outfitters ."
3646338,Golden Eagle,2015-03-13 11:36:00,2642,"Mice are coming in for food. Give them a few slices of bread outside the cabin. Move their meal a little further from cabin each day. Pretty soon, no mice in the cabin."
3646722,Ogoki,2015-03-13 14:02:00,291,"Seriously I believe these mice were in the knot holes and cracks in the walls , as we could hear them running the logs . I hear you on the food outside trick . Neverhad mice issues with the cabins belonging to MLO. I will keep the bread idea in mind for the future. Golden , I enjoy reading your posts . You do keep some good company as one of your fellow fishermen lives about 20 miles to the west of me ."
3647274,Bill Krejca,2015-03-13 18:15:00,6107,"Nothing more nostalgic than the sound of wildlife marching in step on the other side of the cabin ceiling while laying in bed. I remember once thinking how easy would it be for the entire ceiling to cave in due to the mass weight of an army of those nasty little bas.. buggers. Sometimes the bad conditions are the ones you remember best. At another outpost just after entering, I remember pulling back the blankets on a bunk only to find I disturbed momma and daddy mouse in their neatly made nest; did they take off!. It may have had something to do with us finding the cabin door having been left open about a foot when we arrived. What good times! Bill"
3647762,Pooch,2015-03-13 21:09:00,4619,"Mice in the cabin and the ongoing battle for who will get to eat our food supplies is part of the fishing trip. Plastic tubs are the only effective way to keep your food yours.We always bring several traps and just run the ""trap line"" each morning. After the first few days you can really thin the herd. Keeping the cabin clean is a big help. Not ever leaving anything edible to a mouse out is paramount. We will never win this battle so just mouse proof everything and go fishing.I do like the mouse bingo thing though.Pooch"
3647938,rnnonmt,2015-03-13 22:13:00,992,Oh Man! Great stories guys. Thank goodness I don't have any to top yours with! Thanks for the laughs.

3643250,Draco1206,2015-03-12 15:47:00,175,"Reading some other posts and trip reports about the conditions of some the outpost camps they have stayed at reminded me of a camp we stayed at awhile ago. The camp was on Grassy/Teabeau and was run by Leuenbergers at the time. When we arrived the camp was a disaster to say the least, but we were used to rustic camps and we were determined to carry on and not let it bother us or ruin our trip. There was trash everywhere, along the shore and in the woods. There were seines and gill nets, piles of goose down 5 feet high, and all kinds of other rubbish up and down the lake shore. It was obvious to us that Natives had spent the winter and spring there, hunting, fishing (gill netting), and trapping. They just left it all behind. We had similar experience at Percy lake also, though not with the cabin. Natives had camped on the shore at one end of the lake and the same thing. Garbage everywhere, clothes, bottles, cans, tarps, etc. Not what you expect to see on a remote fly-in. To Luenbergers credit they gave us a big discount on our next years trip when we complained about the conditions at Grassy/Teabeau, and later decided not to use that camp anymore. Just wondering, has anyone else experienced problems with the conditions at their fly-in outposts?"
3643626,Carnhzkr,2015-03-12 18:24:00,964,"The worst outpost conditions I've ever had was on a lake trout trip, must have been '97 or '98. Just getting to the outpost was quite an odyssey. My dad and I flew commercial to Winnipeg, then rented a car and drove to Thompson, MB where we overnighted. The next morning, we flew in a prop plane to Rankin Inlet along the Hudson Bay for refuel, then hopped west to Ferguson Lake Lodge. From there, we floated in a helicopter to our ultimate destination on a river just north of Yathkeyd Lake. Crazy what someone will do to catch a fish, isn't it? Anyway, when we arrived at our outpost, it was either an old rail car or a storage shed that had been converted into a kitchen area. There was a dirt floor extension attached to that with four bunks. The kitchen had a small propane chest freezer and a burner. The freezer was supposed to have been filled with meat, but evidently the group before us had eaten all of the steaks and chops and left us the hamburger. There was an outhouse, of course, with three sides and no door, and let me tell you, you did not want to take the Sunday paper with you for a relaxing dump because this place had the worst mosquitos I've ever experienced. It was spray, spray, do your business and run back. Before the helicopter pilot left us, he handed us a loaded rifle and said there'd been a barren land grizzly spotted in the area, so this is just in case. I laid in bed that first night and wondered how I was going to survive six more nights. Looking back, I wouldn't trade a minute of it for a week at Budd's Gunisao."
3643778,Draco1206,2015-03-12 19:09:00,175,"Wow! Hard to beat that Carnhzkr. I'm puzzled by ""we floated in a helicopter "" to your camp. Is that just a mid print? Or did you actually use the helicopter as a boat?"
3643866,Carnhzkr,2015-03-12 19:25:00,964,"Float like a butterfly, not like a canoe."
3643882,Mike Borger,2015-03-12 19:26:00,1554,"A number of years back I fished a small fly in brook trout lake with my dad and uncle in the Algoma region with Batchawana Bay Air Service. It was an old log trappers cabin built in the 1950's.All the chinking was long gone and there were gaps between every log to the outside - there was a LOT of mosquitos! The cabin interior was an absolute pig stye. Every surface had a sticky film on it and it smelled like something had died underneath the floor.Worst part was the mice - there were hundreds. First night my uncle yells in the middle of the night, jumps up, kicks open the cabin door and runs outside. Scared the **** out of me and my dad LOL! He awoke with a mouse gnawing on his thumb, it grabbed his digit with both little paws and mowed down HAHA! Actually drew blood.For the rest of the trip I was so paranoid I wore these huge snowmobile mitts I'd brought with me to bed every night. On the last night it poured rain and the entire roof leaked, there wasn't a dry spot anywhere in the cabin and we got soaked.On the plus side the trout fishing was incredible and to this day it's one of my most memorable trips."
3643922,Draco1206,2015-03-12 19:42:00,175,"Oh, Dah! Now I feel stupid for asking."
3643994,Draco1206,2015-03-12 19:54:00,175,"Nothing worse than being kept awake by all those little pitter pattering feet all night. I remember at one camp the mice were everywhere. Cabinets, oven, and we didn't have any mouse traps so we baited a minnow trap we had and caught them that way. Seems like when you're the first ones into the camp after ice out you have to deal with a few more problems than those that go later in the year."
3645850,maddogg,2015-03-13 09:24:00,178,"To solve the mouse problem we would each take a mouse trap along to camp.In the evening once the traps were appropriately marked with the owners name. The game would start. A mutually agreed upon bet was placed on the table. Traps were baited with a bait of your choice. Traps were placed where you thought was the best spot. Lights go out until the first SNAP. If a mouse is dispatched the bet is collected and you start over. It helps if a little libation is invoved.I can't take credit for the game I heard about it from the camp attendent at St Joes. He said one cabin kept cheering and turning the lights off then turned the lights on and cheered again,. Finally he had to go and see what was going on. Mouse Bingo"
3645922,SinOrSwim,2015-03-13 09:38:00,1528,"LOL That is funny. THe first fly in we ever did was a BEAUTIFUL cabin. Google Mandi's Dream at Walsten Outposts. Anyway, the mice were EVERYWHERE!!!! One night we sat at the table, 6 of us, put a mouse trap in the middle of the kitchen floor, all the lights on and watched. Sure enough, mouse comes out.....SNAP!!!! lol I have never seen anything like it. This was a long time ago so who knows whether that has changed or not? I can't remember but another place had cats around the property. It was awesome. No mice problems at all."
3646066,Lovetofish,2015-03-13 09:59:00,458,"Mouse Bingo, now that's funny. I bring a new 4-pack of traps every year. Our cabins aren't crawling with them but we do catch a few each trip. Your game just made my list. Thanks."
