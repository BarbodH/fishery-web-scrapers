My wife and I started taking our grandson with us to Whitewing 3 years ago when he was 13. He has since become a Lac Seul fanatic. Hopefully your son will have the same positive experiences. I have 3 trips planned this summer and one is the same week as yours. I'm taking my son-in-law from Colorado on his first Canada fishing trip. I will be more than happy to hook up with you and mark maps and/or let you follow us down the lake. Will you have your own boat or will you be using camp equipment? If you are interested, pm me and we can start working on the details."
3643394,Hawkfan,2015-03-12 16:56:00,237,Is this bar open to people not staying at the resort? And have satellite tv? Say for a possible football game in the fall if the weather isn't nice...or if it is?
3651362,Fish Finder,2015-03-15 07:25:00,13,"Hawkfan, Whitewing's bar is open to the public but there is no big screen tv sports bar atmosphere like I think your looking for. It is a big log cabin lodge atmosphere. you can have a drink inside at the bar or outside on the deck, very relaxing place! http://0201.nccdn.net/1_2/000/000/11...e1image556.png"
3531818,Fish Finder,2015-02-11 10:13:00,13,"Fairly new to this message board but have heard about it for years. Cannot believe all the knowledge and information on here by experienced anglers. I have been fishing Lac Suel since 1981 and found Whitewing Resort a few years back. I love the resort because it is family built and operated. It has always been clean with good equipment and great cabins. Dave and Bobbie have always been good to our group over the years. Food has always been outstanding and could always go and have a beer or drink at the lodge. Correct me if I am wrong, but Whitewing is the only resort in the area that has a bar, right? Personally, I love the fishing on Lac Suel and would not want to fish any other lake, I now know the lake pretty good now and where to fish and when. Always could find fish within five miles of the resort or run down the lake 30 miles and fish the big water, never have had a problem catching all sizes of fish on Lac Suel. I was just curious to know what the rest of the Walleye Central folks think of Whitewing Resort? Looking for the good, the bad and the ugly? Could always pass along commendations, recommendations or suggestions. I currently have two trips planned for the 2015 fishing season in June and July, so I can't wait for the ice to melt and clock to tick. Happy fishing!"
3532074,WalleyeWally28,2015-02-11 10:48:00,298,"Completely agree. We have fished Lac Seul out of Whitewing for the past 12 years and have never had a complaint. Have 3 trips planned to Whitewing this coming summer - June, July and August. Lac Seul fishing and Whitewing are both awesome."
3532194,ftfarms,2015-02-11 11:03:00,444,There are two camps that Weve stayed at and will always remember the hospitality from the owners. They are whitewing and snakefalls camp on pakwash. Bobbie was nothing short of awesome both years we stayed and rob and nancy at snakefalls are just the best. Never been to a camp so clean and well run We just elect not to drive that far no more.
3534786,btyreprich,2015-02-12 04:31:00,1067,"Our group discovered Whitewing Resort a good 12+ years ago while fishing out of another camp. Had run out of 2 cycle oil while on the lake and made an emergency stop at Whitewing for oil. We were sold on Whitewing within 2 minutes of walking up to the main lodge. Dave and Bobbie are great folks and their equipment is first rate. I cannot find one negative thing to say about them or their camp. To be sure there are cheaper places to stay in the area, but we never wanted to chance it over a few dollars. I'd rather watch the grocery bill for the trip to save $ versus going to another lodge."
3629753,Fish Finder,2015-03-09 08:25:00,13,Thanks for the input. I felt the same way just wanted to see what or if there was any other opinions out there to pass along. Always have had a good time and caught many fish. Good luck this year and Happy Fishing!
3631346,BChris,2015-03-09 15:32:00,11,"We were there for the first time early last September. Loved it, and are going back this September. We didn't go any farther than Steamboat Bay area for our fish, as size and numbers were there, and we were hesitant to run the channel to McKenzie. I'm curious; do all of you launch your boats at the resort, or elsewhere? We had to have almost the whole truck in the water to get the boat on and off, as we have bunk trailers. That's the only downside I can think of about staying there."
3631626,WalleyeWally28,2015-03-09 16:19:00,298,"We've always launched at the resort in the area over towards the fish cleaning house. Did you launch there or straight down the drive next to the main dock? The water level can make a difference and, at times, you may have to run your truck in deeper. If it is a major problem, talk to Dave and he will help you with his truck or loader."
3632458,btyreprich,2015-03-09 20:09:00,1067,We launch our boat at the resort near the fish cleaning house and there is a section of the beach that is more gravel than sand. I would launch the boat using a Honda mini van and had no problem providing I stayed on the gravel area. Got stuck the year before because I went on the sandy part of the beach area. Dave had to come to my rescue with his front end loader tractor. Don't worry about launching at the resort - you'll be fine. Great resort so enjoy yourself!
3632562,Fish Finder,2015-03-09 20:34:00,13,"We have always launched on the fish house side as well. In all the years, only had problems twice and it was due to the water level. There was always a piece of equipment around to help if needed. Water level can make big differences in boating and the fishing on Lac Suel!"
3641474,sauvain,2015-03-12 08:27:00,63,"We are going to be staying at Kay Air...which I believe is close to Whitewing. We always fly-in to Birch with Peter Kay...however this year my dad and I are taking my 14 year old son on his first trip and we decided to fish out of Peter's camp and fish Lac Seul. Would appreciate any help on spots to fish, etc. We will be there the week of July 18th...."
