528479,lunker99,2003-03-09 22:44:00,236,"Fish will spawn pretty close to same time each year late ice or not. Spawn tied in to length of day. Cold water temps might push it back a few days, but not as much as one would guess when dealing with late ice."
528480,Guest,2003-03-11 19:06:00,0,Nobody has a clue about ice out other than it's not going to be out in the next 2 weeks. The forcast for Red lake is 50s the beginning of next week so even though we have thick ice nowdoesn't mean we'll have a late ice out this spring.The last post says ice out doesn't impact the timing of the spawnbut when we have late ice out it does affect the Walleye bite.Anyway you will not have to worry about ice when you are going and you are going up at an excellent time to catch the best Eye fishingof the early season. Post later about ice out predictions.Good Luck
528481,Guest,2003-03-11 19:36:00,0,has anyone had an experience the 3rd week in May. Wondering what we can expect with the eyes and pikers at that time.
528482,Guest,2003-03-12 04:12:00,0,Third week of May can be hit or miss for eyes depending on ice out.With a normal ice out or a week early the Walleye bite should be good.If late ice out you may catch mostly male eyes but the Northern fishing should at its peak in shallow bays.Depends on what part of Canada you're going to.Normal ice out in the Ear Falls area is about the first week of may.Where are you going?Joe
528484,scar,2003-03-12 11:52:00,196,fished siou lookout (minnitaki) last year for canadian opener.WE HAD TO DRIVE UP FROM NORTHERN WISCONSIN AND ALMOST CANCELLED OUR TRIP. WE CALLED UP TO SIOU LOOKOUT ON THE THURSDAY PRIOR TO THE SAT OPENER AND MINNITAKI WAS STILL CLOSED. THE ICE DID GO OUT ON FRIDAY SO WE DID GO UP.THE FISHING FOR EYES WAS EXCELLENT. WHERE EVER A CRICK OR MOVING WATER CAME IN WE FOUND BIG FEMALES STACKED UP. ABOUT 1/2 OF THEM HAD SPAWNED BUT THE FISHING WAS FANTASTIC. WE WERE USING JIGS AND MINNOWS AND JUST BARELY MOVING THEM BECAUSE OF THE COLD WATER. WE EVEN RAN OUT OF MINNOWS AND WERE FORCED TO USE PIECES OF CRAWLER BUT THEY WORKED JUST AS WELL. THE LOCALS SAID THEY HAD NEVER SEEN THE ICE GO OUT SO LATE.WE WILL BE GOING UP AGAIN THIS YEAR FOR THE OPENER BUT HARD TO PREDICT WHEN THE ICE WILL GO. AS OF NOW THERE IS MORE ICE ON THE LAKES THAN THERE WAS LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME BUT LAST YEAR WE HAD NO WARM SPRING WEATHER AND LITTLE RAIN-THERFORE RECORD LATE ICE OUT.IF WE GET A NORMAL SPRING ICE SHOOULD BE OUT NEAR SIOU LOOKOUT ANY WHERE FROM 1 TO 2 WEEKS BEFORE THE MAY 17 OPNER.
