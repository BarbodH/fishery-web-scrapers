528438,greg,2003-03-09 15:04:00,107,Tetu Lake looks like a great place to fish. I can not afford Tetu Lodge though. Anyone have any comments on the fishing at Tetu Lake and staying at Caribou Falls Lodge? Many thanks.
528439,River_eye,2003-03-09 23:54:00,1486,"Funny you should bring it up, I just sent an e-mail to both places today asking for part-time guide work.I have guided at Eagle Nest lodge, about a half hour boatride downriver from Tetu lake. Great fishing for the money. The water flow is so enormous that it creates an incredibly diverse fishery with great fishing most of the year. It does get a bit more technical than a small lake full of fish though, and for that reason, guides are a must. Oh yeah, I go by Caribou falls camp once and a while and commonly see tetu boats trolling for walleyes right in front of their camp.If you want another lodge to compare, check out www.eaglenest.mb.ca"
528440,Guest,2003-03-10 13:54:00,0,CHECK OUT KCR CAMP LOCATED ON THE SAME WATER. NICE PLACE LOTS OF FISH AND GOOD FOOD. NOT EXPENSIVE AT ALL.

528443,greg,2003-03-10 19:14:00,107,thanks Gary-do you know how to reach kcr camp?

528445,Guest,2003-03-11 14:16:00,0,"Greg, My group stayed at Caribou Falls Lodge a few years back. Owners Ed and Donna are GREAT HOSTS !!! You will be fishing the same water, my friend guided at TETU ( old owners) and he did fish alot in front of Caribou Falls as noted in one of the other posts. GOOD LUCK !!"
528446,Guest,2003-03-11 19:54:00,0,"Went to Caribou Falls twice in the past 7 years. Fishing is excellant and you never have to go far. Best fishing is within a mile or two of camp. Fast moving water bring alot of heavier jigs, becouse you will lose them. A kiker motor helps boat control can be difficult at times. Looked at KCR but talked to some people who stayed there and said Caribou falls was better. Did not have to travel far to fish or boat in. If you go to tetu you will not regret your choice.Any questions email me at [email protected]"
528447,TEK,2003-03-12 07:23:00,23,Good fishing (Pike and Eyes) Good people and Bad boat landing!! Getting in and out is a problem. I would go back.
528441,River_eye,2003-03-12 11:21:00,1486,"KCR is a really nice camp, or so it looks from the water and the fishing is great around there. The reason why it's so cheap is because it's overshadowed by a fairly big indian reserve."
