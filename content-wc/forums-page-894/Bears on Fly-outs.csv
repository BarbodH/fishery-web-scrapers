528516,River_eye,2003-03-11 17:36:00,1486,No grizzlies in Ontario or Manitoba I'm afraid.
528522,pnnylfr,2003-03-11 17:39:00,114,"Have had bear in camp in the past. Keep your camp clean, and hope that those before you were neat and clean.I take a can of Gaurd Alaska bear repellent. Got it through Cabela's. I keep it in a holster, right up front when I cross the border, and make it a point to tell them that I have it. Have never had a problem.Kurt"
528517,Guest,2003-03-11 18:45:00,0,I beg to differ there River Eye. I've met lots of Americans who have witnesses them here in the bush of NW Ontario. Tracks like snowshoes and 12 to 14ft tall and thems just the small ones. It must be true because when the stories get told and told again around the camp fire their eyes still get as big as saucers.
528523,Guest,2003-03-14 14:57:00,0,"I've had a few encounters with bears in Ontario and Manitoba. Different situations called for different reactions. True Story #1 (what mostly happens) While canoeing and camping in the Boundary waters, black bears would occasionally visit our campsite (especially on stormy nights). He pokes around a while, gives up on getting to our food pack that was strung over a limb, sniffs & snorts at the corner of the tent and mosies on his way. A no-problem encounter. Good thing for him cause I had my Swiss army knife. True story #2 (what can and does happen)We're four days into a fly in trip in by the English River, Manitoba. It's around 11:00pm and we're pounding a few Blues and playing poker. Something rips into the screened in porch and starts rummaging around. Mind you, there was no food in the porch. Whatever it was, it certainly could hear & smell us. We would pound on the steel door attempting to shoo the critter away. Through the side window we could see two cinnamon colored black bears (about 500 and 300 pounds). Five more freakin visits that night. They showed little fear of us. That explained the vertical rips in the cabin window screens that were 8' off the ground. The next morning we made an emergency radio call to our outfitter. We were on our own until tomorrow. In a pathetic attempt to prepare our defense, fillet knives were tied to the end of oars and axes were sharpened to a razor's edge. We started talking like Cage, Kirby and Little John. If the bear attached, we would stay in formation (how lame). Now its sunset and we'd like to get back into the cabin, but who wants to be the first one to walk in through the porch? Wouldn't want to accidentally corner a 500-pound bear, so lets prop the screen door open and toss a few sticks in to flush it out. A few tosses later we hear a grunt coming from the bushes 20 yards behind us! Eight nanoseconds later we're in the boats in the middle of the lake swatting mosquitoes. That bast&%d took our cabin and I don't want to sleep in a 14' boat. Our second attempt allowed us in the cabin. That night, while going outside to answer call of nature, one hoped nature does not call back. Oh yeah, they visited us a few more times that night. Fear turns to anger. Look out the window and see that huge head looking back. OK, back to being scared sh##less. Next morning the sweet sound of a floatplane announced the arrival of our outfitter and Don whom guides and traps and brought a 444 Winchester. Our reports of the Ursus invasion were met with a casual Oh, they're back. Don tracked the bears for about an hour, but couldn't find them. As they were getting ready to leave we asked, Where ya goin with that rifle? Outfitter responded, What would you do if you saw the bear?Frank the cop replied, Blow his freakin head off.Good answer And with that he handed us the rifle. Now, the tables were turned, we could move about freely again. Granted, one needed an armed escort to the outhouse, but The next day we saw the bears, but were never offered a clear shot. The week ended in a stalemate.As we were loading our gear into the floatplane, we were surprised by the 300 pounder who was rummaging through a garbage bag of empty beverage cans. She was only 30 yards from us - yikes! Don took the rifle. Hey Don here are the shells. He took only one bullet.Don't ya want any more bullets? We asked.He looked at us puzzled, There's only one bear. And with that he loaded, readied, scraped his foot until the bear looked up, and fired. Right between the eyes. This was a dangerous situation. It was the first year a cabin had been on this lake. Not enough time for bears to habituate to man, yet they showed no fear. Maybe some group before us made food available, setting man and bear on a collision course. No one knows. This city boy now better understands a nuisance wild animal can be dangerous. Coexistence was not an option. True Story #3Staying at a popular resort at Loc Seul. Black bear walks into camp around 2:00pm. Knocks over garbage can. Resort owner scared him off. Camp dog sounds the alarm again at 4:00. Owner plugs the 600 lb. bear in right in the middle of camp.Back to your question, Has anyone had any problems with Bears on a fly-out. In the past have you brought up a weapon for protection? Yes, we have had problems. Yes, we have brought guns to very remote fly-ins. Don't anymore. Not sure why. While the risk of a bear encounter may be significant, the risk of an unprovoked bear attack in Manitoba/Ontario seems be slight to nil."
528515,GR8WTHUNTER,2003-03-14 22:09:00,618,"Yep. thats it. You don't need to outrun the bear, just the other guy your with. Rich"
528502,Karl,2003-03-11 12:12:00,63,"I called the Ontario MNR on the pepper spray question at the border because the Ontario MNR's own web site recommends pepper spray.He told me the difference is the ""legal"" kind comes in a quart-sized can, is carried in a visible holster, and specifically says ""Bear Spray"" in big letters. The ""illegal"" kind is the concealable tiny purse-sized stuff they sell in the States to prevent muggings.It's for your own benefit because the legal kind sprays a stream about 30 feet, stopping the bear BEFORE it gets to you. Those tiny U.S. canisters spray a mist about 5 feet. Bear's got you by then."
528503,Guest,2003-03-11 12:20:00,0,Good info....thanks. Is Bear Spray available in the U.S. or is that something you'd have to buy after crossing the border? My son and a couple of his buddies are considering a camping/fishing trip this summer. His mom would no doubt feel better about her baby being in the wilderness if he had a can of that stuff.
528511,Dave,2003-03-11 12:35:00,258,"As long as the parties ahead of you take care of their trash you should be OK. We fly out of Red Lake (100 miles NW)and had to shoot a bear in Sept. 1999. The owner sent us in with a bush rifle because he had word of a nuisance bear. The bear came into the cabin on the when we were out, the sliding window near the stove was left open. In any case, the one shooter in the group discovered the trashed cabin and grabed the rifle. After trying to scare the bear away with some Stevie Ray, a chain saw and two warning shots he took it out as it was about to go back in through the kitchen window. One memebr of our party was inside and the only door was next to the window. We did take it on a one-way cruise to an island which showed no signs of the remains the following year."
528504,Karl,2003-03-11 13:57:00,63,"I couldn't find an 800 number, but I would call Ontario MNR office to be absolutely sure. Phone numbers can be found at:http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/csb/mes...nroffices.htmlThe official MNR quote about pepper spray for bears is located at the following web site:http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/bears/Last sentence (last resort?) in section titled:WHAT TO DO IF YOU ENCOUNTER A BEAR"
528512,walleyedude,2003-03-11 14:25:00,34,"Try Bear Bangers.They are available in Sporting goods stores all over Canada.We use firecrackers ourselves,nothing sends a bear packing like a cherry bomb exploding in Blackies face!"
528513,Guest,2003-03-11 15:08:00,0,"Actually, You don't have to worry to much about the black bear, it is the grizzly you have to worry about. They are much more unpredictable.When walking in the bush, you should have small bells attached to your shirt and carry pepper spray. If you happen to find dung on the ground, you should make sure, actually what bear it came from before you panic. Black bear dung has grass and berries in it. Grizzly bear dung has small bells and smells like pepper. LOL.P.S. banging pots and pans together is just as effective as a 30-30."
528518,Guest,2003-03-11 15:15:00,0,"It's against the law to have a gun in the bush in the summer as there is no open season for anything. As well if there is an open season for bear and you have a gun, shells and no license you'll be talking to the judge. You will also need a permit to take out a nuisance bear or at least phone the Ministry. Laymen taking out bears is frowned upon here. If every American brought a gun for bear protection the whole bush would be armed in the summer. Look after your garbage and if your outfitter is any good he'll police the previous guys. Drop your fish scraps for the gulls on an island somewhere and burn your garbage. This isn't the wild west....."
528514,Ivy,2003-03-11 15:15:00,556,O.K. O.K. Ask a serious question....I guess I just need to stay in shape and bring my tennis shoes. As long as I can out-run Bigfish I should be fine.Ivy
528519,Guest,2003-03-11 15:37:00,0,IvyMaybe you forgot the fact that I was on the High School wrestling team and was 3rd at the City Championships. I'm more worried about falling asleep with your type in the cabin.Bigfish
528520,Ivy,2003-03-11 15:50:00,556,"Bigfish,I remember ""Hulk Hogan"". I should have sent you a bill for all those years of Chiro-treatments after you wrenched my neck into the ground.But hey, I figured that 20 years of beers and hard live'n might have slowed you down. But if I'm wrong, I know I can out run Dad and Uncle Ed. Send me some sales!Ivy"
528498,Ivy,2003-03-11 07:23:00,556,"A few years ago when my father and I went on a fly out in September, my Father wanted to bring up my slug gun. Which we did. We were asked at the border if we had a weapon and said yes. I told them it was for Bear protection and there wasn't any problem.But that was before the new regulations. We didn't have any problems with bears so I think it was much ado about nothing. Has anyone had any problems with Bears on a fly-out. In the past have you brought up a weapon for protection?Ivy"
528499,Thumper,2003-03-11 07:46:00,133,"I'm doing my first fly-in this year, so I'm not an expert, but I have a few thoughts. I do some remote camping in Northern MN where there are a fair number of blackies. Only had a few issues with them that I've learned from.Bears aren't stupid. They want to live their lives in relative peace. They want food easily. In the mid-late summer, there are plenty of natural food sources around for them. I think that the only reason for them to be near people during that time is when people are doing a poor job of waste disposal. Fish guts, last nights left over lasagne, the bottom bit of jelly in a far... all these things are tastee morsels to Ursus Major. Make sure that you get rid of these things on the other side of the lake.I don't know if your fly-in lake has portages to other lakes. Mine does. And, animals, like humans, want to take the easiest route to where they're going. Don't be too surprised to see some critters on the portage path. If you're going in the Autumn, then moose may be a problem, too. Moose get pretty fiesty in September!Instead of a 12 gauge, you might want to bring some pepper spray. Aim for the nose and eyes. When in the woods, make some noise to give the critters time to get away from you. When you run into a bear, act like your the baddest M.F.er in the woods unless you're between a sow and her cubs. And, if all of that fails and you're looking at a 500-lb'er claiming his territory, remember, you can always catch more fish so just get out of there."
528500,Thumper,2003-03-11 07:47:00,133,"And also, hope that the party who had the cabin before you was diligent about their waste disposal, too."
528505,IaDave,2003-03-11 07:50:00,476,"Several years ago on a fly in trip out of Pickle Lake we had to kill a bear that was in our camp. The outfitter flew in a 30/30 with us because the bear had been ripping into a empty cabin the week before we got there. He told us to shoot him behind the 3rd rib and he would go off and die. Well the 2nd morning there I was taking a leak off the deck and wouldn't you know there was that bear about 10' from me on the ground. He saw me and just turned around and walked back up the trail. I calmly finished what I was doing and walked back in the cabin. Yeah right. I told the guys that their bear was out there and they scrambled from bed. By the time they got up the bear came back down the trail and one of the guys shot him thru the screen while he was in his underwear. Instead of shooting him so the bear would go off and die he dropped him right there. I will never forget the death moan. Well these great white hunters decided the best way to get rid of him was to dump him in the middle of the lake. You all know what happened, the next morning the bear was floating about 50' from our dock. They took him across the lake and drug him on shore. I never laughed so hard. Sorry for the long post but I love to tell the story."
528501,Guest,2003-03-11 08:27:00,0,"Unless they have changed the rules in the past two years, pepper spray can not be legally taken across the border into Canada. Two summers ago I was with a group and one guy's wife was worried about us running into a bear. She stuck a can of pepper spray into her husband's jacket pocket when she kissed him good-bye. He had no idea it was illegal and at the border he casually showed it to the guards. They immediately took it from him, asked many questions and searched the car. When he asked if he could get the pepper spray back when he left the country a week later he was told, ""No, it is now property of the crown."""
528506,Ivy,2003-03-11 08:48:00,556,"Hawgman,You made coffee shoot out of my nose. LOL.The camp owner said he would fly in a 30-30 if one was around. But I'm thinking about the having it and needing it/ needing it and not having it thing.By the way. I think you can rest assured that none of your crew would make it in the Maffia. Ya gotta believe that Fredo never saw the light of day after he got popped out in the lake. Ivy"
528507,Guest,2003-03-11 09:18:00,0,"Geez fellas, we are talking about black bears. I've been going up there for 20+ years and never had a problem with them. Ya, they might come nosing around camp looking for an easy meal but they aren't gonna maul you or anything. They are very curious but can easily be scared away. C'mon your on their turf, cut em some slack.Now having said that, if you ever find yourself between a sow and her cubs or anywhere near her cubs you should be very carefull and get the heck out of dodge fast, the sow will do anything if she thinks her cubs are in danger."
528508,Guest,2003-03-11 09:30:00,0,"I agree with Aaron, thousands of people go to Canada every year and do just fine without guns. If your that scared there are plenty of farm ponds in the midwest you can fish. Your going to there home, act like the guest you are. If you want to shot a bear buy a tag."
528509,IaDave,2003-03-11 10:01:00,476,"Let me try to explain something. We did not shoot the bear because we were afraid for our lives. The outfitter asked us to shoot the bear because it was a NUISANCE BEAR. It was tearing up his personal property. I would not have shot it, it looked like a big dog to me but eventually somebody had to. That is why they should bring back the spring bear hunt- to help clear out the nuisance bears. Here in Iowa we have nuisance deer."
528510,Guest,2003-03-11 11:23:00,0,I have heard it all now. A friend of mine has only went to one fly-in camp and stated that evertime he went there they had bear problems. He asked if we had bear problems as we had went to the same camp on different occasions. I told him that we had never but that we kept a very clean camp and even cleaned fish away from the general area of the cabin and boats. He stated that they do the same and go so far as BURN the bacon grease every morning before going fishing.Ha Ha I asked if he thought that they might attract bears with the burnt grease and he said he never gave that a thought. He doesn't burn grease anymore.!!
