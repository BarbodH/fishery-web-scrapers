528606,Guest,2003-03-13 17:31:00,0,Has anyone been ice fishing lately on Whitemouth Lake in southeast Manitoba. I did awesome up there two years ago in March but didn't hear much about it last year. I am going up to Lake of the Woods this weekend and was just wondering if anyone had a report. Thanks

I know that there was some really bad ice conditions there earlier. You could also check the fishing reports on the fishing hole website.Where are you located? If it is walleye that you are after, the Red hasn't been too bad this year. Might be worth your while, and it is a shorter drive. If you are near wpg.Hope this helps.Fish ON!!"
