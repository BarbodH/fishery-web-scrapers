528547,Stevie B,2003-03-11 11:39:00,157,"Big Eye,Nothing to worry about, Alumamarie is the same as any other aluminum boat. I worked at a fishing lodge with one of these boats and used it for 3 summers. Infact this boat had a 9.9hp and our Lunds had 15hp and this boat would easily keep up. No worries!Fish ON!!"
528548,Guest,2003-03-11 12:21:00,0,I have fished out of Aluamarines and can tell you they are great!For some pictures of the boats go to these two websites:www.scottlakelodge.comwww.ganglers.comGreat Boats!!
528549,River_eye,2003-03-11 12:25:00,1486,"Many lodges have switched to alumarine boats from lunds, because they are less expensive (because of the name), and just as durable, if not more. I guided out of them at the lodge I worked at and they were always a ##### to lift and move around because they're made of thick aluminum. May I ask which lodge you're going to?"
