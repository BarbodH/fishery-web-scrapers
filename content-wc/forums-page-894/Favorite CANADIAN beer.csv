528287,Roadhog,2003-03-10 18:50:00,17,"In my opinion, there really isn't a bad Canadian beer. The best beer is the nice cold one you have at the end of great day of fishing with your friends. There's nothing better than sitting outside listening to the loons calling to each other and swapping ""lies"" at the end of the day. If I have to choose...give me a Blue!"

528262,Guest,2003-03-06 10:49:00,0,"Since it is pretty boring today I thought I would start a discussion that everyone probably has an opinion on. What is your favorite Canadian beer when in the great White North?I prefer Crystal but let me hear what you enjoy.I just love ejoying a cold one while on the lake taking in mother nature and catching several 'eyes for supper. PS ,, ,I dont need anybody telling me the evils of drinking on the water and the legality behing it,,,"

528267,Ivy,2003-03-06 14:22:00,556,Nothing better than an ice cold Blue. Except when Bigfish buys the beer cause he lost the big fish contest to yours truly!!Ivy
528271,Guest,2003-03-06 14:34:00,0,IvyI figured it wouldn't take you long to respond to this thread. The only reason you won the biggest fish contest is I was to busy workin on the Blue. We all have our priorities. How big was that Dogfish?Bigfish
528272,Ivy,2003-03-06 14:54:00,556,"Bigfish,Green is not your color.Put away that petty jealousy and lets just try to get along.If not for me, how about for old Herm Johnson. He is the old boy that taught us how to fish.,remember or did you forget him already.Remember what old Herm used to say; "" Boys, it's not how many fish you catch.........it's uh.....it's uh...oh never mind, hand me another beer.
