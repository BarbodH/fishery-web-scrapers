Taking the Wife on her first Ontario vacation, wouldn't care for any unpleasent surprises. The second is a fly-in with HALLEYS CAMPS, they use RIVER AIR for transportation. Are there any comments, good, bad, or indifferent regarding either of these faciities. THANKS. Vern"

528540,RCKC,2003-03-11 13:07:00,14,"Howdy,You're making me feel better already! The Halleys fly-in is to Bee Lake, about 80 miles North of Minaki, in mid September...yup, will bring along the long johns too. Interested primarily in Smallies. I'm always a bit leary of those outfitters who don't have their own aircraft, but these guys have apparantly been around for some time. Thanks...vhv"

Used an indian guide named jimmy who was very good. The road leading to the lodge was a bit rough. Good experince would go back sometime."
528543,roscoe,2003-03-11 21:00:00,38,Fished Big North Lodge 3 years ago with my wife. We thought the accommodations were excellent and the fishing and equipment the same.Would definitely recommend it. We were there over Memorial weekend and fished for 3 days. That was our first time in this area and we were well satisfied.
528544,RCKC,2003-03-12 14:46:00,14,I'm back and I logged in this time. We fished Rex lake and the smallie action was awesome. We are thinking of doing a full week to this lake in the future.
528541,fishinguy74,2003-03-12 15:50:00,1,Gene Halley has at least 8 of his own float planes ranging from little Cubs to Turbo Otters. I think he operates his air service as a seperate entity for financial reasons. I'm a camp owner/operator in Manitoba and I've heard nothing but good things about Gene's operation. Have a great trip!
