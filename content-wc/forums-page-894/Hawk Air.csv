528426,Guest,2003-03-09 10:16:00,0,We fished Little Miss 6 times in the late 80's and early 90's. Each year it seemed like we had to go farther south on the lake to catch walleye. My cousin continues to go there but has had to use live minnows to get any numbers. My wifes largest pike to date was taken there. A 25 lb 44 incher. I would take plenty of live bait. I have been on 26 fly-in trips to date and Little Miss rates at the top as far as wildlife sightings and beauty. I plan on doing a canoe trip thru there sometime.

Last year one of the guys counted the fish for his boat for the week (2 guys)-709 walleye. Most of the walleye were in the slot-very few below and only 6 above. Many of the fish came from the first big bay to the right of the cabin. Stump Bay and the large opening at the end of the lake always produced fish. We didn't fish for pike much but did catch some while chasing walleye. According to Kelly, the owner, it's the best lake he has. Ontario Wilderness Vacations has a cabin there also. Get back if you need more info."
528428,Guest,2003-03-13 12:15:00,0,ChuckThanks for the reply sounds like the fishing is good. Was wondering do you bring in live bait and what type? Do you have enough for the whole week? I was thinking leeches or crawlers would be the best.ThanksJeff
528429,chuck c c,2003-03-14 05:38:00,34,"Jeff; We get a flat of crawlers from Wawa Live Bait and the 500 crawlers last six of us for the week. I've never tried leeches there. We also catch walleye casting with Rapalas (SR7-clown color) When we locate a bunch trolling, we start casting. A good jigging spot is at the base of the falls. If the water is high enough, try to get to the trout lake-there are some nice lake trout to be had."
