528568,Guest,2003-03-12 14:55:00,0,"Sometimes, when I want to sit back, relax and drink some of grampas cough medicine, I will put on a slip bobber with a slit shot. Hook the minnow just under the dorsal fin and set your depth so that the minnow is 6-12"" off of the bottom. There is no techniques to master and no special time. If they are there or cruzing the flats you will nail them."
