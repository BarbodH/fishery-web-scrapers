528375,dlhomes,2003-03-06 20:40:00,62,Looking for a MNR (Ont.)sight to get fishing license and gun permit. Thanks!
528376,Guest,2003-03-07 04:49:00,0,"Here's the MNR web page www.mnr.gov.on.ca but I don't think you can get licenses over the internet, just the regulations booklets, which are free. For your gun permit you need to go to Canada Customs site. http://canadaonline.about.com/cs/customs/index_2.htm this explains about the permits required and where to get them.Hope this helps,Jim"
