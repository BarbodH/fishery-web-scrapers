528209,Guest,2003-03-12 16:48:00,0,to Know the area and others that dogged my comments about a flyin:take a challenge--your lake. we will go out in seperate boats. you bring in more fish--i pay for your trip. I bring in more than you pay for me!!!! that is how confisent I am. Let me know.
528203,Dan,2003-03-03 11:57:00,325,Has anyone fished out of Gold Arrow Camp just south of Perrault Falls? Seems to be just what I was looking for. Can anyone help?
528204,Guest,2003-03-03 12:03:00,0,been to manatok which is on perrault lake. i have been going to canada for 20 years(since I was 7 years old) this is by far the worst fishing I have ever had. We usually fly in and the fishing is superb. we tried something different and paid for it. ended up calling the guy that flys us in and left manotak early and flew in for the rest of the trip. I am sure you will hear good things about it but I just know what my experience was. Al always it depends on the weather for that week and other factors but it was the worst fishing i have ever had. Good luck.
528212,Trailerguy,2003-03-03 17:19:00,1407,"Gold Arrow has boats on a number of smaller lakes, as well as Cliff, and Ord Lakes. We fished out of that camp for 20+ years before we bought a cottage. Don and Sharon have been running Gold Arrow for 30 years and they know what makes a sucessful stay. You'd have a hard time finding a better place to fish. They usually fill up early due to alot of repeat business."

528205,Guest,2003-03-04 15:35:00,0,"To Mr. Been to Manatok. That was a very interesting story of your fly-in experience and your fishing at Perrault Lake but what exactly does that have to do with Gold Arrow Camp which is located on Jackfish Lake. We have also flown in and had good and bad fishing but sounds to me like you can't see the forest for the trees, are only interested in catching and killing fish and can only catch one if you're in a barrel of them. You not only need to keep flying in but polish up your fishing technique and geography. Just for the record, this will be our tenth year at Gold Arrow and we are new kids on the block."
528206,Guest,2003-03-05 10:16:00,0,"Know the area---you are piece of work. i like the comment about killing fish. how would you know what I do??? I happen to catch and release---if we are eating shore lunch i will keep one and that is all. We go to canada to be with friends and catching fish is secondary. However, we still want to catch fish and if you say different then your a liar too. I said opions would vary about this area but you seem to take it personally??? Are you from Iowa???? If you are---get away from my boat!!!!!!(personal Joke) Believe me when I say---our group never gets out fished at camps in canada. The fishing in that area is not good and if you think it is then you need to look into other places or you are not that good of a fishermen. That area of canada has to much access to the lakes and they do not fish well. Keep bringing in the buckets of 9 inchers and clean em out---i have seen it from that area. perrault or jackfish or whatever lake is close by."
528207,Trailerguy,2003-03-05 19:40:00,1407,"Talk about a peice of work? The pot calls the kettle black! You are obviously not familiar with the lakes in this area. You can choose from a lake you can drive to, (like Perrault) or a lake so far out you have to drag a canoe in with you, (like Front, a so called fly-in). It all depends on what YOU are capable of, and of course whether YOU can catch fish. Many of the fly-in lakes are acessable from portage, ATV or simply going up a creek. All a fly-in tells me is the guy is too lazy figure out how to get there on his own. I'll be the guy in the canoe at your fly-in next summer, lol."
528208,Guest,2003-03-05 21:23:00,0,"Mr. Been To Manatok, OH GREAT ONE, I am sorry I signed on as ""Know The Area"". I only thought I did and hereby relinquish the name to one who does but you shouldn't be upset at me. After all, you're the one who has to fly in to catch fish but I know your type - you go out in a boat by yourself and still get out fished. I'll bet the only shore lunch you've ever had was a baloney sandwich because you seem to be full of it. I rest my case. Touche' and Goodby."
528210,Guest,2003-03-05 21:57:00,0,"From what I have heard, Gold Arrow Camp is a well run business that has a large repeat clientel. For ""walleye"" to dismiss the lake and the camp because the one time he happened to be there the fishing was not up to his standard is regretable. In my experience most people who want to have a change of pace from their normal fly-in trip should not expect the same type of fishing. Fly-in lakes generally offer the experience of catching a bunch of fish...usually not large..with little or no fishing skill needed. If the goal of your trip is to catch as many walleye as possible then you would be better off going to North Dakota or Lake Erie....both offer better walleye fishing than will be found on most NW Ontario lakes. The call of the loon and the whine of the walleye-challenged angler do not mix well.....stick to your fly in trips in the future."
528211,Guest,2003-03-06 10:54:00,0,You must not know how to fish and need them to be real easy huh??
