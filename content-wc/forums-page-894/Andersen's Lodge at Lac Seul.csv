Those are all guides from Andersens Lodge. If they can't find fish - there aren't any left.The diffence between Lac Suel and Minnitaki is basically you don't stand much of a chance to catch a ten pounder on Minnitaki. 7's & 8's are common though. The other difference is your back won't hurt near as much by the end of the week. (Lac Suel can be real mean and nasty with any amount of wind.)"
528330,Guest,2003-03-07 21:55:00,0,In july I would be very surprised if they take you walleye fishing in Minnitaki. I would bet they take you up to LS. They might take you to Red Pine Bay but that is also a long way. You and your wife will enjoy the camp and the resturant attached. I will look forward to your post after you get back
528331,Karl,2003-03-08 18:47:00,63,"The first two weeks of July 2002 were fantastic for walleye on Minnitaki. Most fish and biggest average in 10 years. That's not my point here though. You rarely see Andersen guided boats as far as Redpine Bay. Reason is there are just as many walleye on all the small rock humps and bars in Northeast Bay in summer (and especially in fall), which is considered to far and to dangerous for non-guided boats, but is really close to Abram Chutes and Andersen's camp."
528332,Guest,2003-03-10 10:57:00,0,"Sounds good. Sounds like some one you know the camp and area well. So, sounds like we'll be able to catch nice fish without having to travel great distances. For some of you who know the area, what is the smallmouth and lake trout fishing like that time of year. Thought we'd spend some time fishing for those along with the walleyes.Thanks for the help."
528333,Karl,2003-03-10 20:09:00,63,"Forget about lake trout that time of year. They're suspended at 80ft in water 100ft or more. Boring.........Minnitaki has smallmouth and they bite real good that timeframe. However, ask Andersen's guide to take you for a day on Little Vermilion Lake (about a 5 minute drive from camp). They routinely do it for guests, so it's no big deal for them. It's a small lake, so no long boat rides and it has the highest per-acre smb population anywhere. High wind is the only reason not to catch 70 smallies on that lake, especially if you're being guided."
528334,Guest,2003-03-11 08:48:00,0,"Thanks for the advice Karl. How do the smallies run up there? Any chances of 4 or 5 pounders? I love walleyes, but smallies are a close second. Catch smallies on topwaters and its a riot.Thanks!"
528335,Karl,2003-03-11 11:57:00,63,"On a decent day weather-wise, you shouldn't have any problem catching a half-dozen or so 4 pounders. There are many 5's, but I haven't been that lucky yet. On Little Vermilion Lake the average size is 12-13 inches, but you will catch your share of 16-18 inchers also. Every year a couple dozen 20 inchers are caught (and released, I hope!). My lure of choice is an Excalibur Pop'R in Bream color. Tried out most other kinds, but the Excalibur outproduces them time after time.Also, ask your guide to try Bass Island on Minnitaki Lake. It's not guaranteed like LV Lake, but worth trying. Again, weather permitting, the smb fishing can be super. Difference is the average size is 16-19 inches and you won't catch as many in total. But, if that doesn't work, you're a stones throw away from some of the best walleye locations."
528336,Guest,2003-03-11 12:40:00,0,"Thanks for the good info. Karl. I'm excited for the trip and look forward to catching some of those big smallies along with the walleyes. I love catching them on tubes but I'll have to pick up some Excaliburs. And, yes, all smallies go back. Too sporty of a fish to take out of the lake. Replicas look just as good! Thanks!"
528337,tly,2003-03-12 19:57:00,1900,"Several years we have used Andersons, mainly for fly-in. They are very very professional and helpful. The lodge/restaurant is very good and the facilities are clean, modern and well kept up. What we do is drive up, spend 1st nite at motel along with excellent dinner and fly out at o:dark:30 to the outpost. Depending on time of year there may/may not be ice left at the cabins (for cocktails, not on lake).We began years ago when we could camp on crown land and camped essentially where our favorite flyin spot is (Kekkebeca Narrows) and have really cleaned up on fish. We are also catch/release execpt for hunger pang. I don't think the quality of fishing has decreased in the last 10+ years in that area. Of course we become more familiar also.I am sitting here with this year's promo rag just wishing but am losing fishing partners rapidly. It aint me, its cancer, heart and other things that hit way too soon.Dick & Folks will take care of you and you will have a great time.TLY"
528319,Guest,2003-03-06 13:07:00,0,I'm fishing out of Andersen's Lodge on Lac Seul in mid-july this upcoming summer. I was wondering if anyone has been to that lodge and what can I expect for fishing Lac Seul in mid-July. Any patterns or pointers will be appreciated. Thanks!
528320,red2,2003-03-06 16:00:00,16,"They are not on lac seul, but they will take you there. I went to one of their outpost on lac seul and liked it very much but did not fish out of their main camp. Nice people and looked like a nice camp, good resturant there also. Tim"
528321,Guest,2003-03-06 19:21:00,0,"Andersons is an excellent camp. Very expensive but high in customer service. However, it is very far from LS. It is locked on Abrams Lake and about a 45 min. boat ride to LS with their cruise boats. The problem for real fisherman is that you are a long way from prime fishing at that time of year."
528322,Guest,2003-03-07 09:56:00,0,"Will one be able to experience good walleye fishing fishing out of Andersen's lodge? Judging from the previous reply, we may need to travel some distance to get to the walleyes. Has anyone fished the lakes close to Andersen's lodge? I've heard they have all good fishing. Thanks!"
528323,IaDave,2003-03-07 10:06:00,476,"Minnitaki Lake is a great fishery. We have been going the last 3 years and never even wanted to travel to Lac Suel. Maybe we are missing something by not going to Lac Suel but if you are happy catching 25-50 walleye a day per person in the slot or larger no need to travel. You won't have a lot of luck at Abrams Lake that time of year,it is better in the spring. We have always gone in the spring or fall never in July so I guess I can't say you will catch that may fish, but it wouldn't surprise me."
528324,Guest,2003-03-07 11:07:00,0,"Thanks for the response IaDave. Where is Minnitaki from Andersen's lodge. We have guides for the week so I'm trusting they will know where the fish are. By the way, what is the slot there? Also, have you fished the smallmouth bass or lake trout? We are considering taking a day and doing that as well. I guessing you can catch pike probably about anywhere. Thanks!"
528325,IaDave,2003-03-07 11:33:00,476,Minnitaki Lake is about a 5-10 min boat ride from Anderson's with a small motor. You will enter Minnitaki thru the Abrams Chute. That is always fun the first time thru. Minnitaki flows into Abrams lake and it is about a 7' drop from one lake to the other. Obviously not all at once. You just have to hug the south bank and keep your boat on plane and no problems. Since you have a guide you will have no problems going thru or catching fish. Like I said we have never been there in July so I really can't be much help on hotspots. There is a Walley Center member named Karl who goes up there alot. Hopefully he will see your post. We have fished smallmouth in the spring at mineshaft narrows. Get a Minnitaki map thru Red Lake Digital/Alex Coldstream.Just do a search on the net to get their phone #. Any more questions feel free to e-mail.
528326,IaDave,2003-03-07 11:34:00,476,"I forgot the slot is 18-21"" walleyes. You can keep 4 under or 1 over & 3 under."
528328,BLUEJEANS,2003-03-07 11:53:00,2,Please let us know how you did when you get back. My son and I are planning on going to Anderson's next year if all goes well.
528329,Guest,2003-03-07 12:05:00,0,Thanks for the information. I'm taking my wife up there and from what I read it sounded like a good place to go. Never been there before so we have a guide for the week. I'll post the results when we get back.
