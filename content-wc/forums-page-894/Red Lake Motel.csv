528460,Guest,2003-03-10 12:27:00,0,Great Choice. Viking is a great outfit. I've been with them multiple times over the last 16 years of going up. Which lake are you flying in to. I can give advice on a couple of their outposts.Bob
528461,Thumper,2003-03-10 22:27:00,133,"Hi, BobWe'll be going to Optic Lake the last week of May. It's just downstream from Telescope in the park. If you have any experience there, I'm all ears! (they should have a smiley for that, I think I'll make up my own :8) :-))- Rick"
528462,Guest,2003-03-11 14:18:00,0,"While in Red Lake shoot over to the Snake Pit for a few Beers. My buddy had a knife pulled on him there. But, If your not loud and obnoxious you should be ok."
528463,Thumper,2003-03-11 19:52:00,133,"Uh, gee, thanks... for the warning! ;)"
528464,Fisher,2003-03-12 08:10:00,35,I remember many years ago (when Red Lake still had dirt roads running through it) that I saw my first stripper in a bar in Red Lake. I was at the young age of 6. Good times.
528450,Guest,2003-03-12 14:19:00,0,"Red Lake Inn. Just watch out for the drunk indians in the Snake Pit. They can get a little bit out of hand. Plus, they can panhandle for money in front of the place."
528451,Thumper,2003-03-12 17:43:00,133,"Thanks, Fly Boy :)Actually, doesn't sound like the kind of place I want to leave any of my gear at night. I'll opt for some place quieter, but maybe stop by the 'Pit for a snort."
528465,Roadhog,2003-03-13 08:10:00,17,"About 20 years ago we were staying at the Red Lake Hotel. Staying there takes you back to the days of yesteryear. We stayed on the top floor of the hotel. The ""fire escape"" was a knotted rope you threw out the window!Another interesting experience I had there was in the Snake Pit, the basement bar. I was sitting in the bar on a Friday evening enjoying my favorite Canadian Beer and listening to the entertainers on the stage. I believe it was a duo, a guitar player and a singer. All of a sudden the music stopped....the singing duo was replaced by two other guys fist fighting up on the stage! I thought I was in the Wild West!"
528448,Thumper,2003-03-09 16:03:00,133,We're doing a fly-in out of Red Lake in May and the flight time is 6am on Saturday. I'm figuring we'd want to stay in or close to Red Lake on Friday night. Anyone have any suggestions for the cheapest place to stay? A bed and a toilet are about all we'd need for 11pm Friday to 5am Saturday.- Rick
528449,Fisher,2003-03-09 16:39:00,35,Try Red Dog Inn. What outfit are you fishing with up there?
528452,WillieB,2003-03-09 17:13:00,292,"Great area!!We flew out of there last fall. Watch out for moose on the drive to Red Lake.Like Fisher asked, what outfit are you using?"
528453,Thumper,2003-03-09 19:45:00,133,"Yeah, we've seen moose a few times on 105. Heckava site!We're flying in with Viking Outposts. My first time using them, but I've been talking to them for the last year and a half (it's been a long time coming). 10 weeks and 5 days...I tried to look up Red Dog Inn but only found motels of that name in Kenora and Ft. Francais. Any contact info for the one in Red Lake? or other suggestions?- Rick"
528454,pnnylfr,2003-03-09 20:07:00,114,Here is a list of places in Red Lake. It's a little dated but should help.Howey Bay Motel 807-727-3419Red Lake Inn 807-727-2161Norseman Inn 807-727-2858The Waterfront 807-727-1171We stayed at the Red Lake Inn last year. Should be just what your looking for. Restaurant and bar right next door. Viking Outpost just down the street. Cabin fever is killing me. We dont go till August.Kurt
528455,River_eye,2003-03-09 23:45:00,1486,"If you see Hughs daughter Harriet, tell her Eric said hi, that'll freak her out.You picked a good operation. Their Norseman airplane is a real beauty. Really good people."
528458,Dave,2003-03-10 05:41:00,258,"The Howey Bay motel has been good for us, plus they have a bar with pool tables and the restaurant serves a good breakfast. 800-263-4693"
528456,Thumper,2003-03-10 07:23:00,133,"I don't know if ""freakin' out"" Hugh's daughter is such a good idea - Hugh is pretty much a Huge guy! I just saw him briefly once last year and he must've gone 6'8"" 350lbs. :7"
528459,Thumper,2003-03-10 07:25:00,133,"Beds, Food, Pool tables _AND_ a Bar... we have a front-runner here!:9 I called and they have rooms - double occupancy would run about $30 a head. Not too bad, I suppose it'll be hard to get anything cheaper during fishing season."
528457,River_eye,2003-03-10 09:14:00,1486,"Well, it wouldn't freak her out, we're good friends, but you're right, you wouldn't want to get on Hughs bad side, I can tell you that."
