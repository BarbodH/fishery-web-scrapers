528570,Guest,2003-03-12 14:11:00,0,Anyone know what the primary forage species is on that system?
528571,DonC,2003-03-12 18:09:00,93,"The fish you will catch mainly is walleye, sauger, smallmouth bass, pike and muskie. There is also some black crappie, and the prolific perch. If you are not careful, you might hook a 200 pound sturgeon.Don C"
528572,Bobby,2003-03-12 19:36:00,211,Lots of ciscos (spelling?) at Big Sand. I'm pretty sure they're the primary forage species for the walleyes there.
528573,brian1785,2003-03-12 21:32:00,1534,Been up there the last two years and I think you are correct about the ciscos.
528574,Thumper,2003-03-13 06:41:00,133,"What's a good artificial bait to imitate Ciscoes? And, are Ciscoes available as live bait anywhere?"
528575,IaCraig,2003-03-13 14:51:00,434,"Thumper, I am not sure what artificial baits best immitate ciscoes, and besides there are not any fish at Minaki anyway so Id suggest you should check out the English River. Just kidding. What kind of fishing you want to do? If you want to jig/cast plastics I'd recommend a larger silver minnow shaped Berkley PowerBait. If you are trolling with crankbaits in the summer, #9 Deep Shadraps are very popular on BigSand. It seems on a given week different colors produce better than others, but consistent local favorites seem to be clown & pearly white. Personally I bottom bounce with leaches most the time. But early morning or late evenings I'll troll and experiment with Shadraps, reef runners, deep thundersticks or Mann's Stretch 15+ or 20+ to see what is working. Once in a while a shallow lure like a traditional rapala is the ticket. As far as color I like either perch or anything with a silver/white belly and a touch of red or orange on the front.Good fishing.IaCraig"
