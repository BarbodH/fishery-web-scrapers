With the combination of fish you are looking at I would try the Pipestone Chain of lakes. You can try Pipestone lodge or Happy Landing Lodge, Happy Landing has plummbing and running water as Pipestone Lodge has composting toilets and they are about 8 miles from each other."

Atikwa is one of the best lake Trout lakes in Ontario especially for numbers. It is also a great Pike lake. The walleyes are a food source for the trout and pike in the main lake, but we have found a couple of patterns that work(most of the walleyes in the main lake are big), or the portage lakes have good populations of walleyes. As for the cabins being dirty and not maintained the lodge was under new ownership 7 years ago and it was a little run down when it was bought. Since that time there has been constant work fixing things. I think for the most part the cabins are in pretty good shape now. I always thought that the cabins were pretty clean, but you do have to remember that this is a fly-in camp and not a five star hotel. I really don't want to sound like a resort owner pushing their camp, so I would be more than happy to go more in depth and answer any of your questions by email. If you know what time of year you are going to be there I can give you an idea of what to bring and some of the techniques that work well as well as a couple of spots to try. My email is [email protected]"

The lake was netted and it really hurt the walleyes but understand they are coming back, what is there is big as in most oligotrophic lakes. Few, but giants. Really beautiful country."
