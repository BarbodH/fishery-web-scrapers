510291,Guest,2000-12-01 17:49:00,0,"Hi,My cousin and I are going up ice fishing at Christmas time and we are new to it. Can anybody recommend a cottage resort on a specific lake they enjoyed and had good luck. I was thinking about going to The bay of Quinte (Hay Bay) but am kind of worried since it is so overfished. Any help would be greatly appreciated. By the way the lake should be within 2 hours of Toronto. Thanks"
510292,Frank from TBay,2000-12-01 18:13:00,312,I grew up in Southern Ontario and the Perch and Walleye fishing on Lake St Clair is excellant. You are about three hours from there +/-.

We do very well at lake Simcoe about 1 1/2 hours north of Toronto.Here's a link that if you go to the message board, you'll know when the ice is safe:www.fishinglakesimcoe.com/Don't take ANY chances on thin ice, not a good way to go."
510295,Guest,2000-12-03 11:39:00,0,"Yeah those places sound good. THis will be the first time going ice fishing for both of us. We're not really experts at all. We've been on two fishing trips together one to the port severn/mouth of Georgian bay area where the was few bass, had a pike or muskey on then lost him and many panfish that were fun. Then in the fall we went to Doe Lake up north and I swear there must have been a severe cold front because nobody was catching anything. Even the experts of the lake. Not even a trace of panfish either. All we got was three bites between us and one walleye. I'm just hoping to find a cheap decent lodge or resort on a lake that has many fish even if they arent giants. Thanks for the help."

510299,Guest,2000-12-19 21:39:00,0,"Go to http://www.quintefishing.com/. Bayview bait & tackle is the most help I've found. The first time there best to spend the money on someone that knows the water. They can set you up with a hotel reasonably priced in Bellville. This site has a great discussion board with tactics and locations. Stay away from Fosters, heard lots of disaster stories. FishFinder charters is also good. Dave Chatterton seems to catch lots of fish and supplies everything you need except clothes and license. Hope this helps."
