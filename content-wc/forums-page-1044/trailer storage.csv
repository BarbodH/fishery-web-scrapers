510351,Guest,2000-12-15 14:48:00,0,I bought my first big boat rig. I am wondering about storage. Is it necessary to put the trailer on jack stands? I pull the battery and have a minimal amount of gas in the tank. Will the bearings flat spot over the course of December thru February?I would appreciate all suggestions.Thanks

I was told by a mechanic that a full tank will prevent water condensation from forming. Makes sence to me. I always use Sta-bil gas additive and a full tank and never have had a problem.
510353,Guest,2000-12-15 22:58:00,0,"yeah, make sure you have some gasoline stabilizer in the fuel tank so you don't get the varnish build up.your bearings should be fine with only a couple of months layover, I think the flat bearing scenario only kicks in when a unit is stored over a quite long period of time. good luck!"

I leave it on its wheels with fresh bearing grease and gasoline stabilizer in both tanks. After my last trip to the Red in late Oct/Nov, I inject storage seal into the cylinder heads and replace the lower end grease. I have had trouble-free starting every spring. Only the battery and other small removable objects come out of the boat before I wrap it in tarps for the winter. Trailer still has its original bearings which I repack at least twice a year because I trailer it 4-7 thousand kms every summer. Hope this helps."
510355,BD,2000-12-19 16:43:00,739,A bearing condition known as false brinneling can occur if the wheels do not turn and the trailer/car is rocked by the wind etc. If the trailer is stored inside there should be no problem. If it is stored outside it should be on jacks or the trailer should be moved back and forth every couple of weeks to work the grease around the bearing components.
