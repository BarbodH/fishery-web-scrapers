510378,Guest,2000-12-25 22:29:00,0,I was wondering how the ice on the Red River at Selkirk was doing. Can it be driven on with in a vehicle? I've been outta town but santa just brought me a 3hp Jiffy 10-inch Auger and a Mustang Survival Suit so I need some serious ice time or the missus will take them back.Thanks in advance.

There is a concern of safety, because the water level is dropping underneath the formed ice. Best call local authorities for ice conditions, there is concern that the ice will be unsafe for the entire winter.Don't mean to put a damper on things as I would like to give ice fishing a crack this year."
