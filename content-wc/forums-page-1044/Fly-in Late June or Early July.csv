I don't think it makes any difference ,but what do you think? They think the mayfly hatch will be on last of June with a better chance of better fishing first week of July."
509763,Guest,2000-09-13 08:21:00,0,"It depends on how far north you go. May flys are in the lakes in mid-June on the Canadian Border lakes. The LacSuel area will have them in late June. Further north can have the them into the third week of July. I think that the best time for any Canadian fishing trip, fly or drive in, is from the third week of August until the third week in September. There are usually no bugs in the air or water, and the weather is stable with the fish firmly entrenched on the reefs and the large main channel points. Northern Pike and Muskie are also on the move. If you can arrange your schedules, late summer or early fall is a prime time to do the Canadian trip."
509764,Beeg,2000-09-13 12:05:00,9,North of Armstrong. We are going on two trips. Second one in August.
509765,Guest,2000-09-13 17:00:00,0,"I agree with Angler1, If you can swing it September is the best. I have flown in to lakes in May, June, July, August and September and have found that with no bugs and great scenery with the colour changes in the trees and the cool clear nights which are great for sitting around the fire late September is a great time of the year in Northern Ontario. P.S. and the fishing has been good also.Steve."
509766,River_eye,2000-09-13 17:15:00,1486,"If you can only chose between the two, I'd reccomend the last week of June. It just gets too hot in July, which isn't good for walleye fishing up here.River eye"
509767,BD,2000-10-04 06:25:00,739,Good luck on your trip. For those of us who hate to fly or want to drive in to fly in type fishing check out www.presslake.on.ca It's the only camp on a good size lake (part of the English River system) north of Ignace.
509768,Go_Fish,2000-10-17 14:01:00,28,"Beeg,In my humble opinion, I think that August is the best. The bugs aren't too bad, the water is warm and nicely stratified, the eyes and trout are on the reefs, and the days are longer than in September. I'm taking my wife up to a fly in for our 1-year anniversary, and that's when I think that it is the best. Good luck on your decision.Go_Fish"
509769,onetimedave,2000-12-21 18:48:00,502,Try Artic Watershed Outposts out of Nakina in June. Six lakes and all are great and price is reasonable. Web site nakina.lakeheadu.ca/~nakib/awo/main.html. These are great people.
