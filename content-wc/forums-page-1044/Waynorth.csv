510199,BGunn,2000-11-16 17:21:00,880,"Duffy d,Is that camp still owned by Deborah, and Kevin? My wife and I went there some years back, and had the time of our lives. Good food, super fishing, and the guides were the best. I have a good promotional film from that camp from when they use to have that T V show. My wife still thinks it was the best vacation we ever went on. Is Mark still the camp pilot?"
510200,Guest,2000-11-20 07:35:00,0,BGunnYes it is. However Kevin and Debrah split up about 4 years ago. Kevin sold the camp last year to the owner of Red lake airways. I am good friends with Kevin and when I go to way north this year (JUNE) he will come with us and guide us. He is willing to guide people at the camp on special request. Although the weather was terrible last June we still managed 11 Northerns over 20 lbs between four of us in one week. As you know for that place that's a bit below average. The walleye fishing was very good. Me and my buddy managed 186 eyes in 10 hours of fishing one day on Lemonade lake. Kevin also showed us a mid lake hump on south trout that produced many eyes over 7lbs including one that was around 13lbs!!! Are you thinking of heading back up there? Duffy.
510201,BGunn,2000-11-21 04:01:00,880,"Duffyd,Man, I would love to go back up there, but I just bought a new Lund boat (hasn't even been in the water yet!)so my ""mad money"" funds are quite low at the moment. What a trip you should have with Kevin as a guide! I have a couple of his tapes on catching northerns, and the guide we had when we were up there (his name was Glen) told me that nobody can catch northerns like Kevin. I can't tell you how much fun we had at that camp, the fishing was super, the guides were really great, everything was the best, and if the new ouners keep it the same, I would very highly recommend it to anyone. Sorry to hear that Kevin, and Deborah split. (I wonder if she needs a new fishing partner,Huuummmm, na, my wife wouldn't understand!)We went to a seminar that she put on at a sportsmens show one year. She's quite a Lady, and had quite a life growing up in the woods of Canada. Bill"
