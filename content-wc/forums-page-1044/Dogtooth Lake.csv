510306,Guest,2000-12-05 13:14:00,0,I have heard people refer to Dogtooth as great walleye fishery.I would appreciate any information you would care to give me about the lake. I am seriously considering going there next year.Are there any resorts on the lake? I have heard rumors of lake trout also. Is this true?I have searched the internet to find resort info on the lake and have not been able to find any.Thanks in advance.

My fishing buddies and I go up about the 2nd or 3rd week in June. Last year was a very good year for us, with the biggest going 31.5"". This lake is a great lake, but it is not a lake where you catch one right after another. First year up there, I fished 4-12hr days, with two walleyes in the boat. 10.5# and an 8#. Nice wieght average, but the numbers weren't there. lol. Now, we know the lake fairly well, and the numbers are coming along nicely. After all, the chase is as much fun as the catch to me. Anyway, if you would like more specific info, feel free to email me, and I will try to help ya out. Good fishing to ya."

A few years ago a friend I was fishing with caught a 20# northern on the lake. They also have some large smallies. Not a lake to put fish after fish into the boat, but a great lake to catch a trophy. Good luck. I have fished the lake 4 years."
