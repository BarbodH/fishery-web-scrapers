513925,Guest,2001-07-24 16:44:00,0,Onfri 13th my young daughters 8&14 went on a walleye charter out of lorain.The gent was utterly amazing in his skill and attention to our needs.The 8hr trip was 300. Our tip was what we could afford being on vacation.30dollars.I kinda feel like we robbed him.God bless the capt. of One track mind. Julio
513915,Guest,2001-07-15 14:08:00,0,Say the day costs 150 how much do you tip thanks
513916,Guest,2001-07-16 02:22:00,0,"Too many variables to give a fixed amount. Some rare occasions, nothing. With adequate (fair) performance -- including willingness to teach, open to explain and discuss, and attitude of concern, another $25. For excellent performance, all of the above and more, $50. It is not a question of fish caught, it is a question of good, gracious, and concerned service. Not all good outings will produce lots of fish -- as all fishermen surely know."
513917,Moose_MI,2001-07-16 04:24:00,31,"Just my opinion... If I spent $150 for a guide for a day and there expecting a $25-50 tip....we darn sure better catch some fish! I don't care if sunshine glows from his backside...if I aint catchin fish I don't feel obligated to kick in another 25-50 bucks for his beeming personality. If I want fellowship, I'll go to the potluck after Church on Sunday. :)"
513918,Guest,2001-07-16 04:48:00,0,I've been a guide for a few years This is the standard for Manitoba20$ us/day/person30-50$ us /trophy
513919,Guest,2001-07-16 05:49:00,0,"Moose -- Are you saying you would not tip a muskie guide if the guy worked his donkey off, shared info, made observations you would have missed, but failed to boat a muskie? I've had some multiple fish outings ruined by obnoxious, arrogant, and inconsiderate guides. I've had great outings when we failed to boat a fish. The guide's personality is part of his baggage. I tip for good baggage."
513920,Moose_MI,2001-07-16 06:21:00,31,"Cisco, I'll assume that anyone specifically fishing and acquiring a guide for MUSKIE are not going to boat 10 or 15 fish. There realistic expectation maybe to boat 1-5, and see several follows...its the nature of the fish. So, I guess if I were to get a Muskie guide I'd tip accordingly...even if I didnt catch one...as long as I at least saw several follows. If I dont see follows I'm holding the guide responsible...thats why they call him ""the guide"". I'm already out 150 bucks...for 0 follows...under these circumstances I dont feel compelled to tip. For the record, I don't Muskie fish much and would never get a guide so I'm having to be a bit hypothetical here."
513921,kevin,2001-07-16 08:08:00,74,"I just spent two days on Saganaga with a guide. He put me on hawg walleyeas, shared info, and had some great conversations. I tipped him $100 for two days......worth every penny."
513922,Karl,2001-07-16 20:13:00,63,"I asked whether he preferred cash or lures for a tip. He chose lures. Anyone who has seen prices of lures in NW Ontario knows that they're outrageously costly. So $30-$40 (U.S.) worth of lures is greatly appreciated for an outstanding day of fishing with a good guide. It helps that I spend all fall and winter buying a couple of lures every week knowing that whatever I don't buy is going to be the hot bait the following summer. There is no such thing as ""too many"" lures, just need a larger vehicle to carry all the tackle boxes."
513923,Backwater Eddy,2001-07-17 03:12:00,3871,"A Tip is just that, a tip, not a guarantee in my book and I am a guide.If the person has made your day fun and your a bit wiser for the trip a tip may be in order?EH 50%-60% sounds about right, but I may be a bit prejudiced?LOL!:)"
513924,Guest,2001-07-24 03:20:00,0,On a seven day trip I gave 250 for trophy fishing.Plus my parntner chipped in 200.Thats about 65 a day for a 10 hour day.My guide did not stop working from the time he got in the boat till we got out.I would liked to have gave more but you have to draw a line somewhere.
