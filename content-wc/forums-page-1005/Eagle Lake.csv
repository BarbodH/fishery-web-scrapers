Obviously, Osbourne bay is good but check other mainlake areas like Lake points, the reefs around and past Temple Bay, deep water basin-side edge of islands and the entrances of bays like Froghead, Boulder, Spring,etc... I've always done well trolling livebait spinner rigs/minnows when the weather cooperates. In crummy weather the fishing slows and we do better jigging."
