514029,Guest,2001-07-22 21:37:00,0,Heading to Black Sturgeon in early Aug. and was wondering how the fishing is and what the eyes want for food. We usually bring crawlers with spinner rigs. Any suggestions as to where to find them. Were always in the mood for the winnipeg river if it is possible. Help me out.
514030,Guest,2001-07-24 12:34:00,0,"Was up there last weekend, specifically upper Black Sturgeon. The water is very warm and the algae bloom is starting. Managed to get several eyes' however not near the numbers caught and released about a month ago. Spinners, jigs with frozen minnows were used.Speak to the locals on the water...they will help you."
514031,Guest,2001-07-24 14:27:00,0,"Was on Black Sturgeon for the first two weeks of July. Had best luck with jigs, tipped both with crawlers and minnows. Really started heating up temp wise the second week and the fishing slowed. The second week we were catching most off long tapering points in about 18' to 22' of water. Wasn't doing much on mid-lake humps then, but they may have improved by now. Caught a couple of 5 lbers. trolling larger Thundersticks and Bombers, fish were suspended from 7' to 14' over about 25' to 30' of water. Might want to visit with Carl Snow, the owner of Black Sturgeon Camp if your in the area, he can give you the latest."
514032,Guest,2001-07-25 14:40:00,0,Thanks for the info. We are going to Snows so it should be a good trip. We were trying to find and buy a map of the Upper Black Sturgeon but we were unable to find one with depths. Any good areas on the upper would be appreciated. Thanks again.Steph

I have some old hand drawn maps of the lake boundary that I've ""jotted"" locations on over the years. Send me an e-mail and maybe we can find a way to get you some the info."
