514019,Guest,2001-07-23 09:37:00,0,Fished Wakima lake twice two years ago. Walleye are large but go deep and get finicky in the heat. Fished July and August with little sucess. Rest of the camp had the same result. Locals sais early spring late fall the lake is well harvested as the walleye head for the river channel.
