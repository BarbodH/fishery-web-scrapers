514022,Guest,2001-07-24 15:25:00,0,"Stayed there a couple of years ago for a long weekend over Memorial Day. Went after lake trout on Arrow. We also fished Iron Range, Northern Lights and Whitefish in the evenings. Did OK at all. As for the resort it seemed quite pricey... We had a large group and filled two cabins don't remember the cost but per person seemed to be a little high in comparison with other places I've been. Aside from that every thing seemed good, nice fish cleaning building, very shallow landing and dock area, cabins were nice and did allow primitive camping. Hope this helps, Doc"
