513944,Guest,2001-07-17 10:38:00,0,"Howdy all,Got back Saturday from our first trip to Minaki and the Winnipeg river system..Fishing was still a little tough with the water still high and FINALLY starting to drop a bit..Caught some decent ""eaters"" rigging and bottom bouncing with leaches but the guy I saw cleaning up was a guy from northern Iowa who was pulling cranks..He was running Reef Runners 250 feet back with no weight and slamming some big eyes..9's 10's and up!!Didn't have any trolling outfits with but tried anyhow to no avail..He generally stayed right under the railroad bridge or slightly upstream and I mean he was catching some great big ol' good uns'!!!Fishing should be picking up as the water tries to get back more to a normal level..Also did OK near Harbour Island atop a hump that came up to about 17' or so and near Raspberry Island where someone in our group stumbled into a 9 lber..Debris was fairly light, but still there with a few prop busters still floating around..Good Luck and stop by North Star Village and say HI to Farley for me!!Tight Lines to All,buzzer IA"

Trolling under the bridge huh? wow, never would have thought, especialy how the current is. When you say down stream, north or south of the bridge? Do any fishing on Big Sand? Tight Lines,Reels"
513946,Guest,2001-07-19 13:26:00,0,"Returned from the Kenora/Minaki area last Sunday also. Was on Black Sturgeion Lake, but dropped down through the rapids and spend two days on the Winnipeg just up-stream from Minaki. First day jig fishing was pretty good, second day much slower. Can confirm the report on the Reef Runner trolling, this method was bagging some big walleyes. I wasn't set up to particapte unfortuantely , but will be the next time! Just rpior to leaving I talked with one of my guide friends there and he said they were just killing big 'eyes trolling Reef Runners about 30' deep with 200 yards of line our, just ticking the bottom. Sounds the the hot technique for the Winnipeg now!"
513947,Guest,2001-07-20 19:44:00,0,"Buzzer, I'm glad to hear that you did well. My wife and I are heading up next week and I was wondering if you knew what color of Reef Runners that guy was using. Any input would be greatly appreciated. I'll give everyone an update when we get back. Thanks."
513948,Guest,2001-07-21 10:52:00,0,"Hey CLM,I snuck a peak in his Crestliner and saw that he had a wide array of colors laying out..At $9.95 Canadian I only bought one and it was in the yellow perch with lots of red and orange on it, but I repeat, he had several colors laying out..It was real sunny out while we were there, but I would imagine that the colors would change if it were overcast..Water there is tea colored to clear if that helps with your color selection at all..Go catch a big 'en!!buzzer IA"
513949,Kurt,2001-07-21 12:55:00,47,"I'm going up there in 11 days.Going to try bouncers and spinners. What colors work best there? Is the water level getting close to normal yet?Thanx,Kurt"
513950,Reels,2001-07-22 12:04:00,2876,"Try hammered copper of brass. It has allways been the best for me, by far."
513951,Guest,2001-07-23 19:34:00,0,"BUZZER, THE FISHING REPORT WAS GREAT, BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IS KNOWING THAT ALL IS WELL WITH YOU AGAIN. In 96-97 we fished the Winnipeg River about 5 miles N of LOTW..."
