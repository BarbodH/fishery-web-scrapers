513894,Guest,2001-07-21 22:02:00,0,"We fished the river out of Pellow's Cottages a couple years ago. The river was relatively shallow. Caught a bunch of pike trolling shad raps and husky jerks (use shallow running baits). Caught walleyes with jigs and crawlers in the neck down areas with current on the current breaks. Caught perch with crawlers in the shallows in the weed/reed beds. Had a great time, only wish there had been smallmouths in the river. Don't venture out after dark, the mosquitoes were as big as birds! Good luck."
