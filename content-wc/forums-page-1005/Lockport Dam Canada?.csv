513903,Northern Manitoban,2001-07-15 06:37:00,195,"Backwater Eddy.I was there at the locks on thursday afternoon in the extreme heat,they told me at cats on the Red before i launched my boat that things had slowed down since the Mayfly hatch.I wasted 4 hours fishing the current at the locks then around 6:00 everyone was launching and heading down river,so i followed.Behind lower Fort Garry is where we counted 17 boats,along with the two guide boats.Alot of nothing was happening there for the hour or so i stayed there,we caught small 6 inch cats.Alot of boats were coming and going and moving around that area.We could'nt take the heat anymore so we headed back to the launch as we were zig zagging through all the boats we did see one fellow bring in a cat that looked around 12 pounds or so.I should have fished the morning or evening it was just to hot that day.My friend from Winnipeg caught a 34 incher there on wednesday straight across from the launch.I wish i could have fished another day but i'll be back.So if your heading there you will notice hardly anyone fishing the dam everyone is heading down river.FISH ON."
