513877,Frank from TBay,2001-07-16 17:16:00,312,The license was held by two brothers. The one brother passed away and the other is still fishing however not to the same level as the other brother. OMNR is attempting to buy out the license as we speak. The fishermans last name is Chevrier. I believe his first name is Jack. Great guy.
513874,Guest,2001-07-22 18:06:00,0,In you post you said that if we wanted more information we sould let you know. Well I am going Saturday the 28th to Pine Point. This is the first time I've been there and am asking for some information as soon as possible. If you could email or send me a copy of a map of the lake (hopefully it would get here before I leave) with some hot spots marked i would be very thankfull!!!!!!!!. Even without that any info would be great!thanx
513866,Byron,2001-07-12 14:36:00,42,"Planning trip for next year. Can anyone share experiences about LdML? I have fished Lac Suel, and really enjoyed it, however due to health reasons, this year it has become evident that I can no longer do a 2 day car trip up and back. I'm thinking about flying to Thunderbay then rent a car and drive to the lake. After Lac Suel, how disapointed will I be?Also, has anyone been to Savanne River Resort at5 LdML."
513867,Frank from TBay,2001-07-12 18:21:00,312,Savanne is OK but Pine Point is a lot better. At Pine Point you are also in the central portion of the lake. The fishing at Lac has been outstanding this year. Buddy got one a little over 12 a few weeks ago. Good Luck
513868,Tim,2001-07-12 18:47:00,179,"Byron I fished there at the end of may. Fishing was really good, but we did not catch anything big. Lots of walleyes in the 15 to 19 inch range, lots of fun! Stayed at savanne river its ok the people are really nice, stayed in the motel units they have small frigs and 3 burner stove. Also t.v's in them. Boats were fine 20hp mercs and 10 gal of gas comes with package. Ran 2 boats all day and I don't think we used much more than 20gals in the five days we fished. But savanne is not remote at all, its right on the hyway. So if your looking for a more wilderness setting I would look at pine point or other resorts on the lake. Good luck Tim"
513869,Guest,2001-07-13 01:08:00,0,"I was at savanne river resort over the 4th. The resort conditions are a little rundown from what I experienced elsewhere, also it isn't remote at all. It was windy when my wife and I were there and the boat ride wasn't very much fun for her. We didn't get to fish very far into the lake. Caught a lot of small fish."
513870,Byron,2001-07-13 08:22:00,42,"Does anyone know if Pine Point has a web site, e address, or their tlephone #?"
513871,srj,2001-07-13 10:25:00,971,from a about 5 years ago--800-465-1300. sorry if it is now unused. pine point is in a great location-the fish will be on the humps by now and easy to target. a jig/leech or jig/half crawler will work well. in 3 days i think we only found three reefs w/o walleyes. and there are some monster gators in the lake. lac suel is better but lac des millelacs is not bad.
513873,Wenty,2001-07-13 11:38:00,15,"Byron,I fish LDML almost exclusively, roughly since birth. I've put 25 days on the water thus far and will put in some more days yet this fall. You do catch alot of 15"" to 19"" walleyes as one post indicated and 22""-27"" are not uncommon. Several walleyes of 29+"" have been caught this year which is a testament to the slot limit. I agree with one post that the Savanne Resort is a little dumpy. It's not a bad spot if the ice goes out late because you'll want to fish the river. Pine Point is fine with the only real drawback being it's location, It's the open part on the lake and when the wind catches it, it catches it. I'd recommend staying at the Thunderbird on Cushing Lake. It's quick access now to Maze Bay on LDML since they have plucked the rocks out of the channel. This part of the lake is really cut up with islands. Seldom do you get blown off from this part of the lake, and it's not that much of a boat ride to Pine Point and further east when you go through the blow-out. I tend to think that the walleyes run bigger on this part of the lake.I have taken several groups to this lake, many of whom have fished Lac Seul. Generally they tell me that the fishing is comprable, but that you have a better chance of catching a 30"" fish at Lac Seul. Hope it helps. If you want more info, let me know."

513875,Guest,2001-07-16 05:17:00,0,"Heading up to pinepoint in about two weeks can any one pass along a few tips on spots that might produce this time of year.Also what bait to use,minnows,nitrcrawlers,leaches,etc. Are the northens found everywhere or do you have to work certain areas of the lake for them.Will they be shallow in the weeds or cruising deeper waters. Anyone with aroad constrution report for north of Duluth to pinepoint? Any advice would be great. Thanks"
513876,Shawn,2001-07-16 09:19:00,33,"Don't be fooled about the size of the 'Eyes in LDML, 3 years back I went out with the commercial fisherman that works the lake in the fall (He has passed away now and I don't think the licence was renewed)and we netted several Large 'Eyes that would have been 30"" or more, and I bet that 1 in 20 would have been over 24"". It was a great experience, and I was amazed at conservation the man showed. Every fish was measured and recorded, given that he could only catch a certain number during the 4 weeks he was allowed to fish. I can't comment on locations as I am not that familiar with the lake names, but all fish came from sunkem islands or point extending from islands. I also saw several pike that would have been over 25 lb. in the nets and all were released.Shawnwww,fishingxcanada.com"
