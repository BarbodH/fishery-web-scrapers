We were up at the end of June and the walleyes were still pretty shallow. Have they moved onto the reefs yet? Any info would be appreciated. Has the water level dropped back to normal?"

I called our lodge last week, and the fishing has been fantastic all summer. The fish are on the rock reefs now. I go out in the center of the lake North of Big Island on the Canadian side, but I would expect the pattern to be the same at Sioux Narrows. They should be on the rock reefs and points, dying for a crawler or leech, if the weather holds. Good luck, and save me a few for August."
