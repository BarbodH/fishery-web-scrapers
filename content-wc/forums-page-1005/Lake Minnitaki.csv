513986,Guest,2001-07-23 04:50:00,0,"Just got back from Pickerel Arm saturday. Spent two wonderful weeks there. Assuming you'll be going to Red Pine Bay, I went there one day and everybody was trolling for Walleyes as usual. I started throwing a 6"" Rapala (perch color) jerkbait. I was using 30# fireline and a 12"" steel leader fishing for Northern Pike. Caught nothing but Walleye's in the 4 and 5lb range. Fish in about 14 to 18' of water just jerkin' like you would for bass. Boated 20 to 30 eyes in about 3 hrs. Give it a try, hope you get the same results I did. Tell Lee ""The Great Bozini"" said Hi, he'll understand."
