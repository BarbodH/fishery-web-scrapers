514055,Ray,2001-07-24 01:30:00,96,Heading up to McKenzie Bay to the Scout Lake Resort's outpost camp the week of Aug 3-10. Saw some early summer reports of some high water and pretty hot action for 'eyes. Anybody have any recent reports?Do walleyes typically move to deeper water later in the summer?This is my first attempt at walleye fishing so any advice is appreciated!
514056,jeff,2001-07-24 11:54:00,99,"We just returned from Lac Suel on Sat. We fished the area you're looking at. We landed 2 28.5,1 27.75 4,26 and several other very nice fish. We also landed somewere around 300-400 walleyes and close to that many northern pike. We caught most of the fish in 6to8 feet of water using crawler harness,s or minnow rigs set up the same. Seemed like it didn't take very long for the pike to shorten up the harness's for use with minnows. We tie our own rigs and soon realized you won't scare the walleyes off very easy. I would suggest you use at least 20lb line if you tie your own rigs and if you don't run down the tackle store and pick up another 20 rigs. The 4 of us went through over 80 rigs. To help with the pike we tried some erie dearies and that seemed to help. Other than the evening misquito or two we had no bugs at all. Alls I can say is I wish I could go again. Best of luck."

It also helped to use longer snells 60-72 inches that way the bait seemed to float up off the bottom a few inches. About half the rigs we tied we use a small float on them. The float size verried with the blade size, don't be shy about using larger sized blades. jeff"
