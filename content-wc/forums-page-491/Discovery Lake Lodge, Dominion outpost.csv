1260088,Guest,2011-01-06 19:13:00,0,Dominion is fantastic. Great owners and a gorgous cabin. I have gone there the past two years and have been very pleased. I am planning an ice fishing trip to the main lodge right now. cmbiehle at yahoo dot com if you need additional information.
1260372,SteveJ715,2011-01-08 12:12:00,59,"Hillbiehle,Sounds like you're the resident expert on Discovery/Dominion. I'm very interested/curious about these as well. Can you share some general info about your experiences there, such as:1) When did you go?2) What level of interaction did you have with the owner(s)? And a related question, how does it work for gas with the boats? Do they come mid-week and check and see how you're doing if you're on an outpost or what? 3) How was the fishing in terms of size and quantity? If you had 2 or 3 guys in a boat, what would be an average day...20 fish? 50 fish? 100? etc? Mostly 17-19"", or 20+ average, etc.? What's the biggest you caught on the lake(s)?4) Did you explore any of the other portage or nearby lakes? What were your experiences like there?5) I didn't get a good sense for how it works to get to Discovery/Dominion. Do you drive in to a lodge or something and take a boat from a main lodge to the outposts...? I checked out the website but I've only done fly-ins, so the boat-in idea is a bit fuzzy to me.6) Have you fished on other lakes in the region or Ontario in general, and how do those experiences compare to Discovery/Dominion?Thanks in advance for whatever info and insights you can share. And if anyone else has any input, please feel free to share!"
1260518,Guest,2011-01-09 13:26:00,0,"1) When did you go? 1st time was in 2009 over July 4th. Last year I was there around June 17th or so (came home on father day). Each time I took my parents/stepparents who are elderly. I chose this place due to the remoteness of a fly in, but still have access to my car if an emergency would occur and I heard the fishing was fantastic. Also, the mobility was key. Flat ground, no rugged portaging as I simply can't be at a 100% attention all the time and moniotr slip/falls with my folks. 2) What level of interaction did you have with the owner(s)? And a related question, how does it work for gas with the boats? Do they come mid-week and check and see how you're doing if you're on an outpost or what? All the gas you need is available at not extra charge. I arranged with Paul that my dliema was myself, my wife and my mother and father and that I would be ""guiding"". At no additioanl charge he upgraded me to a 16' with a 15hp so the four of us could fish together and I could help them retie, net, etc. (I was very busy). Thankfully my wife was a big help as my folks can't see very well. We arrived at the main camp, Paul had a cold beer waiting for us. We paid our money showed us around the main camp and then gave me a flat of crawlers (included) and then we drove 20 miles though the bush following paul and cheryl as they led the way. At the time the logging road was rough but has since been smoothed over. We then took three boats from the landing loaded up the gear and Paul and Cheryl helped us unload all of our gear and carry up to the gorgous cabin. They showed me the mechanics in case anything should happen and advised that they would come by in two days as they would be mowing the grass, etc.. and would check up on us. 3) How was the fishing in terms of size and quantity? If you had 2 or 3 guys in a boat, what would be an average day...20 fish? 50 fish? 100? etc? Mostly 17-19"", or 20+ average, etc.? What's the biggest you caught on the lake(s)? Biggest walleye was probably 26"" or so with another 20 fishing over 21"" I'd say. 2 or 3 guys should have no problem catching 100+ a day. Domion consists of thee main parts, while I was there, fishing was consistent and predictable everywhere. 2 of the 3 areas consistenently produced bigger fish, (Upper Dominion in particular did not produce one walleye less than 17""). I am unsure of the total numbers but you don't have to worry about the fishing. Due to 4 people in the boat, we did nothing but vertical jigging and didn't do much pike fishing unless it was just my wife and I. There are some big pike in there. The biggest pike I caught was about 39"" caught while jigging. The lake is a bit smaller than many lakes that I have fished over the years, but the fishing is better than any place that I've been. I would guess the lake is about 2,000 to 2,500 acres total. 4) Did you explore any of the other portage or nearby lakes? What were your experiences like there? The second year on father's day I went stayed at the main camp and fished the various lakes just to compare. Fishing was good every day. Bowden was my favorite for numbers. Each day we would find a hole and pull out 100 to 150 walleyes by simply backtrolling and staying on the fish over a course of several hours. 5) I didn't get a good sense for how it works to get to Discovery/Dominion. Do you drive in to a lodge or something and take a boat from a main lodge to the outposts...? I checked out the website but I've only done fly-ins, so the boat-in idea is a bit fuzzy to me. I've only done flyins as well or boat in lodges until Discovery. You have a bit more independence and it's quite different from other places that I've been. You are treated like family and it's much more relaxed and genuine. As mentioned before, I drove my car to the lodge, and if you go to Dominion you will follow Cheryl or Paul. If you stay at the main lodge, you have a 1/4 mile or 1/2 mile easy drive to a lake of your choice and a boat with full gas will be waiting for you. Traditionally they will follow you there just to make sure that boat doesn't need bailed etc and that there is plenty of gas (particuarly if you are new and unsure). 6) Have you fished on other lakes in the region or Ontario in general, and how do those experiences compare to Discovery/Dominion? This was the first area that I fished near Sioux Lookout. However I have fished all over Ontario and have been to many resorts, fly ins, and lodges. It all depends on what you are looking for. If you like to be on your own and don't need hand holding (although they certanly will help you out), fishing at a very affordable price then I think you will find that it is a very good value and be pleased. The cabins are absolutley gorgous too. Lastly, I'm from Minnesota and spend alot of time fishing walleyes. I am not looking to be pampered and I like to fish on my schedule. If you go here, you can simply take a small box of jigs, buzz baits and spinnerbaits for pike and you're set. These are not complicated lake to fish and it's not necessary to overwhelm yourself with lindy rigs, slip bobbers and all the other crap. PS: if you like to drink beer, this is the place for you. Paul doesn't really advertis as he doesn't need to due to the repeat business. I always wonder why fishing resorts have to go to trade shows 1,000 miles away if the repeat business is so good... (makes you think, huh?)"
1261041,SteveJ715,2011-01-11 17:56:00,59,"Thanks so much for sharing your experiences. I'm trying to plan a trip to Ontario the first week of the season (around May 21) with my old man, and I think we're going to try Discovery. Dominion was booked solid through mid-July, but I guess that can happen pretty easily when it's the only cabin on the lake. I hope the cabins on Discovery are as nice as the one pictured (not sure if that's the new cabin or if they're all like that.)Are you heading up there this year? Or elsewhere in Canada?Thanks again for taking the time to answer my questions. Sounds like we just need to hope for decent weather, which always seems to be the case when we go up early. We've always gone up around that same week you mentioned (coming back around Father's Day). So I'll be expecting cooler temps, but as long as the fish are biting, I'm sure we won't notice the weather.- Steve"

1310273,Guest,2011-05-23 10:15:00,0,"We arrived at Dominion in early July and the walleye fishing was slow the first 2 days. Spent part of day 2 & most of day 3 pike fishing & had a ball. Hit upper Dominion (a round dished out shallow lake with a hump in the northern side) day 4 & had much better luck. We fished most of the rest of the week there. Fish on both lakes were somewhat smaller than other lakes we've fished but the action was good (after the first 2 days). The 2 lakes are connected by a shallow stream you drag boats through. There are leaches to remove from your ankles afterwards. Compared to other Canadian fishing experiences: The cabin & location is STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL. Only issue was intermittent hot water. Boats were basic aluminum with clamp-on seats. Unlimited fuel but no trolling motors or oars. Owners were friendly, helpful & great hosts. We took a portable fish-finder/depth-finder unit THAT DIDN'T WORK. I would have paid a huge premium to have a unit that worked. This caused us to waste some time. (I'll never make that mistake again!) My wife insisted on going to town mid-week. It was about 90 minutes each way. She never made that demand again. It's doable, but why?"
