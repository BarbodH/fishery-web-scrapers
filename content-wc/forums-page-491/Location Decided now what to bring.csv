1310169,DennyDawg,2011-05-23 06:03:00,23,"After looking around and doing some research (And through PM's) I've decided to take my son (12 y.o.) to Anjigaming Lake with Parks Fly In. The question I have now is about lures, rod/reels, and portable fish finder. My son has had very limited fishing experience, but hoping that jigging/back trolling will be the ticket. I have tons of gear from 30 yrs of fishing, but have not been to Canada for almost 20. I'll bring my Shad Raps, Husky Jerks, and some other crank baits....but I'm looking for size and color suggestions. I'm in Iraq and we head our on our trip 2 days after I get home, so I'd like to have as much of this taken care of ahead of time. We'll be there from the 6th to the 13th...any suggestions would be appreciated.Jigs: Sizes/colors.Cranks: type/size/colorsFishing Rods: for both walleye and PikeTake the portable fish finder or not? Humminbird 140Crawler harness's or not?Thanks again....DD"

BTW, I assume you are serving and I thank you deeply for your service.Jigs: Sizes/colors.I like 3/16 oz jigs but most people us 1/4. Chartreuse is good anywhere but I have a lot of luck with orange. For dark waters I like to use some bump- flashers or propellers. White twister tails usually work anywhere but we find walleye assassins (shad color, twister tail) the most consistent artificial. Sometimes you just have to use minnows, though. We go twice a year, but we find crawlers not so great in the spring and better in the fall.Cranks: type/size/colorsHusky Jerks work great for walleye and northerns (of course northerns eat anything that moves) perch colors are usually great for Lake trout (shallow in the spring if you are on a lake that supports them). Blue #12 husky jerk with gold bottom is my ""go to"" crank baitFishing Rods: for both walleye and PikeI am not a picky with rods. Most breakdown rods work for me since the fish are bigger and sensitivity is not a bigger issue than portability. however, we have some purists in our group that would not think of a breakdown rod.Take the portable fish finder or not? Humminbird 140I am also not too keen on fish finders, i like the sport of hunting them down, but some guys in our group think I am weirdCrawler harness's or not?I never use them, but why not?Again, you will have many opinions. the great thing is no matter what your approach, Canadian fishing is so good you will have a great time with many stories. Have a great time!"

Happy fishermen, mean repeat business, with the economy the way it is, they will want to have repeat business. I have looked at this camp too, Let us know how your trip was! Good Luck!"
1310259,DennyDawg,2011-05-23 09:48:00,23,"I'll be sure to take any current medications, as well as some for stomach issues if they come about.I am currently not serving in the Military, I retired from active duty in 2009 after 21 years. I'm working over here as a contract Fire Chief until I can find something back in Michigan....or until it drives me crazy. But I will pass your thanks as well as my own to the Army folkes I work every day.Yes I will be staying in touch with the Hosts/owners about bait/lures and anything else I can think of....but after finally deciding where we were going I wanted to give them a break from all my email traffic....thought I'd ask some of you guys instead!!Thanks again, and if anyone has any more suggestions, I'd appreciate hearing them.DD"

Start with what your hosts recommended & add whatever sounds interesting to you for where you will be fishing. It may open your hosts eyes to what else is possible. One Canadian trip we had TERRIBLE weather, 45Â° with horizontal rain much of the week. Everyone else was skunked so I scrapped everything we had been told & went to DEEP trolling where I thought fish might be hiding. We hit pay-dirt & now that's a favorite location on that lake. For trolling in stained water, fire-tiger is the best color. White is normally not recommended for stained water, but I've had great luck with white on some stained lakes. The more erratic & noisy a lure the better in the area you are fishing."
