1308594,BenBeattie,2011-05-18 12:45:00,232,Should be a great year for Big walleye early season with the late(r) ice out we had this year. C'mon opener!!!!!
1308761,KTroller,2011-05-18 19:22:00,237,"Teddi, how about by Iran Creek in Bannatyne Bay? KT"
1308789,lunker99,2011-05-18 20:15:00,236,"29.5"" walleye last year on jig and 1/2 crawler. 42"" northern the year before on chub and slip bobber. Both in August off different island points."
1309708,lacseul810,2011-05-21 10:50:00,22,"27.75"" walleye trolling bottom bouncer and silver spinner with a leech, 40.5"" Northern fishing a secret mepps that they dont make anymore, and a 58"" Musky... Lac Seul is an unbelievable fishery can't wait to head up there at the end of July. Will be my 11th year in a row headin up!! Look forward to it everyday of the year"
1309811,chock,2011-05-21 19:46:00,19,"one thing that stands out is that everyone is all over the board for the time of year their big fish was caught. I know that the majority of people take vacations in June, July, and August and that is probably the reason why the big fish reports come from those months. I thought that the fall yielded the biggest fish. I have heard that its hard to catch a keeper in the fall."
1308241,thatvoodoothatyoudo,2011-05-17 18:34:00,79,"Best year for size was opening week in 1999 at Birch narrows- our group caught nine over 32 with the largest being a 35- all spawned out females resting at the point edge of a sandbar that dropped from 7' down to 12' & down to the channel. All lethargic & no sport, but long gals regardless. I'd rather catch chunky, active mid summer fish- but just goes to show that the east side holds some real trophies."
1308248,teddi,2011-05-17 18:48:00,349,this thread is about the west end of lac seul . there are threads about the east end. look for them. i was born and raised in sioux lookout and know about that end of the lake and prefer the ear falls end.
1308262,teddi,2011-05-17 19:15:00,349,yes it is turkey creek. at some of the best fishing i have ever seen. sawmill bay can be as good if you know where to go. both are very good and you may pick up the bigest of your trip there.
1308263,Ranger319,2011-05-17 19:28:00,166,And after making comments like that I bet the east end of the lake is happy you moved....
1308265,KTroller,2011-05-17 19:30:00,237,"Thanks for the info Teddi! Are ther a lot of hazards getting up to Holiday Inn from the last island? Been near there but never gone that far. Thanks again, KT"
1308270,thatvoodoothatyoudo,2011-05-17 19:53:00,79,OP never specified the west end ???
1308273,teddi,2011-05-17 19:59:00,349,on lac seul it doesn.t matter were you fish it is all good. i prefer the west end but the east end is good as well. it is what works for you. as far as turkey creek there is nothing to worry about getting there. if you have a map follow it if not just stick to the middle of mckenzie bay and you will not have a problem.
1308279,KTroller,2011-05-17 20:08:00,237,Yep i have it on my map. The camp manager where we stayed actually marked it for me a couple years back but marked some others down there as well and we never made it there. Definitely need to try it this year ....18 days!
1308285,Weby13,2011-05-17 20:18:00,57,"Our group of 10 goes to Onaway Lodge. My buddy got a very sick looking greyish 31""eye on the west side of Scout Lk. My father got a 30.5"" eye at the mouth of Broad Lake on the last dead minnow in the bucket trolling a Erie dearie. My brother has a 42.5"" pike on his wall that he got on a hammered orange and copper spoon in a bay just west of Scout lk. We are trying something different this year and will be flying into Vaughn Lk. Hopefully there will be more of the same great fishing we have experienced while we have stayed on the western side of LS!!!"
1308392,chock,2011-05-18 07:10:00,19,"If you have a GPS I would highly recommend getting the map chip that includes Lac Seul. They mark the main channel and you can follow it right up to McKenzie with no problems. I dont know how many times we probably would have hit a shoal but moved away because it was marked on the GPS. Teddi, the old log shack is not there anymore? A couple of years ago the other boat in our group made it up that way and said they were fishing by an old cabin. They did very well over there. We tried to get up there but we never ended up finding it. Gravelrash30, do you mind saying what time of year it was that you caught those nice fish by Goose Island? We have fished next to that island a few times with not much success. Is it a later in the year bite?"
1308109,teddi,2011-05-17 13:51:00,349,far end of sawmill bay right where the creek comes in would be a good spot to look this year. another good spot would be at the far end of mckenzie bay right by the old holiday inn site.
1308112,Knoxabilly,2011-05-17 13:56:00,225,"We pulled about 8 32-38'' northerns from that spot, not too many eyes though. That's a spot we hit about everyday though."
1308113,chock,2011-05-17 13:57:00,19,We fish all the usual spots I guess. We almost always stop for a minute at Lunker Point and Herbs Point to the entrance of Sawmill. Three years ago we nailed waleye all day right on Lunker Point. The conditions were just right there that year. We will usually drift the sanctuary opening and pick up a few eaters but never anything nice. We always hit the railroad bridge on our way back in a few times. We spend most of the time at Mckenzie. It is kind of a long trip but definately worth it. We have for sure caught are biggest fish and highest numbers over there. Two years ago we hit this spot in Byzantine(sp?) Bay and caught real nice pike almost every cast all day long. I have no idea what made it so special that year. The weather/timing were just right I guess. We hit it last year and there was still some there but very small.
1308116,teddi,2011-05-17 13:59:00,349,i have fished lac seul for over 40 years and you just have to know where to go on different years. ice out makes a big difference from year to year. SAT HELLO TO ANDREA FOR ME. FROM ROD
1308138,teddi,2011-05-17 14:35:00,349,"it,s going to be a killer year for big fish on the west end of lac seul this tyear. a normal spring,low water,late ice out should make for a lot of very big walleye next week and for 3 or 4 weeks. hope everyone who is coming has a great time."
1308166,KTroller,2011-05-17 15:08:00,237,Teddi - Holiday Inn site? Never heard of that before is that way up on the east end of McK past the last island?
1308175,teddi,2011-05-17 15:14:00,349,The far end on the right there used to be an old log shack. We called it the holiday inn. Right where the creeks come in and meet before they become mckenzie bay.

1308010,chock,2011-05-17 11:24:00,19,"I saw a topic posted about less chatter this year about Lac Seul. We will be up there the week of June 11th - 17th. This will be our 6th year in a row. I figured I would post something to create some chatter and hopefully get people fired up about going. What is everyones biggest Walleye and Pike caught on Lac Seul? Feel free to give as much details as willing such as location, depth, time of year, bait, etc. I guess our biggest walleye was a 27 incher we caught at the little sands in Mckenzie. It was during the same time in June that we always go. Caught on minnow and jig about 17 fow. Biggest Pike was 36 inches on big sands in Mckenzie with jig and minnow. Still hoping for that 30 inch walleye and plus 40 inch Pike. Cant wait to get up there."
1308029,Knoxabilly,2011-05-17 11:53:00,225,"My groups biggest, my brother caught a 30'' walleye on white jig and minnow, it was last week of May in Sawmill Bay in a spot that I've only really seen us fish. We have named it Shorelunch. Biggest Northern first year in 96, My Uncle caught a 42 Northern on a dead minnow and bobber! Also in Sawmill Bay. Can't wait to get up there..10 days!"
1308035,wallydave,2011-05-17 11:56:00,2151,"I have fished the Ear Falls section of LS, usually late May up to mid-June. My biggest walleyes, jig and minnow,are 30 in, and two 29.5 inchers. My biggest pike, on a rer eyed wiggler is 34 in. I have seen bigger pike, but I haven't caught one yet, maybe because I fish mostly for eyes. It is fun to hook a pike on my ultra-lite or light rig while jigging!"
1308038,Mike Kansas,2011-05-17 11:59:00,1463,"Big Walleye 31 1/2"" caught by my wife trolling a Shadski (Perch) first week of July at Bear Narrows. Biggest Pike 45"" caught on a jig/minnow in Canoe Bay in July."
1308045,wallydave,2011-05-17 12:12:00,2151,My group will be hitting the water in 18 days! I hope you have a good trip! Keep the rest of us who have to wait informed on how the fishing was! Where you fishing out of?
1308074,chock,2011-05-17 12:49:00,19,"We stay at Evergreen Lodge in the Ear Falls section. There are a lot of 30 incher club members so far. We caught some nice fish up in Sawmill one year but never really got into them since. It seems like there are a lot of eaters in there but have always been skeptical about catching anything with size. It seems it is pretty shallow and have always felt weird about fising in that shaloow of water and catching big walleye. We need to get over that mentality fishing Lac Seul, though, as they can be up very shallow even on warm sunny days."
1308091,Knoxabilly,2011-05-17 13:13:00,225,"@Dave.. I'll be fishing out of Evergreen Lodge. I will gladly keep you guys updated! We have had some of our best luck in 4 ft of water...Lac Seul in Early Spring is diffrent fishing. I've never fished deeper then 12ft up there. It is strange when you get a bite, set the hook and your jig flies out of the water! I love it!"
1308094,Knoxabilly,2011-05-17 13:22:00,225,What spots or areas do you frequent Chock?
1308101,teddi,2011-05-17 13:30:00,349,A 34.5 incher last year. Biggest so far out of lac seul early in the year for me.
1308105,Knoxabilly,2011-05-17 13:39:00,225,That is a huge Walleye Teddi! Details?
