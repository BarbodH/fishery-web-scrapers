1309054,kansasity,2011-05-19 14:17:00,80,What do you guys think of getting a collapsable minnow trap? Light weight and possibly catch our own minnows?
1309062,midwest,2011-05-19 14:32:00,25,Make sure you check the regs where you are fishing. It would not be legal in many places.
1309064,Northern Exposure,2011-05-19 14:34:00,29,"I also thought about that because we camp by a creek, but I don't think it is legal for non-residents to catch minnows. I am not 100 percent sure on that rule, it was years ago when I thought about doing and checked into it. You might want to check the regs."
1309067,Jig Man,2011-05-19 14:36:00,95,It is illegal for non residents.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_165361.html

Back in the 50's in Ontario, both minnow traps and 4' drop nets were legal for nonresidents. I remember those juicy shiny, silver shiners I used to get out of Turtle Portage, LOW- almost had to hide behind a tree so your hand wouldn't get bit by a game fish, just baiting up. Well, almost!

1309564,Baitslinger,2011-05-20 20:02:00,93,"My 11 year old son has a folding trap, and hangs it off the dock at camp. He has a field guide, and tries to identify the minnows he catches (he wants to be a biologist someday), then dumps them back in or feeds them to the camp northerns at the dock. The camp owner thinks its great that he does it, and he encouraged us to bring up the trap when I asked him about it a few years ago. Now we just leave it in camp all year so we don't have to haul it. We looked in the regs and saw it was technically illegal, but the owner also said if the camp was ever checked, it would be his trap.We do not use the minnows he traps for bait though. We buy our bait from camp, so no one loses- my son gets his ichthyology lessons, the pike get fed, and the camp still sells us plenty of bait.Its fun for him to play with, and the collapsable trap works great. English muffins have proven to be the best bait for him."
