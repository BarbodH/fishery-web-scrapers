1309386,JohnnyV12,2011-05-20 11:02:00,9,Spending the week around the Vermilion Bay Area June 18th-25th. Looking at expanding some smallmouth fishing on Eagle / surrounding Lakes. Anyone know of a reputable guide in the area that can help us cut the learning curve a bit. Our boat or guides. Any Info. would be much appreciated. Thanks Guys John

They really seem to know the local waters real well and are nice enough. We have never used them but read their glowing testimonials once a year. For what it is worth. Good luck!
