1309693,horserider,2011-05-21 10:21:00,3,Looking for some advise on a lodge that would rent to a solo fisherman in NW Ontario.
1309699,KTroller,2011-05-21 10:39:00,237,You could try Timberlane. One year I know there was a guy there by himself. I suspect it would be based on if they have openings that are in the near term that might be tough to fill. Good folks though so worth a shot.KT
1309702,kgeary,2011-05-21 10:41:00,88,We would be happy to have you visit. solo is not a problem what time of year are you thinking? Kgeary Anglers Kingdom
1309728,jiggster,2011-05-21 12:21:00,183,The resort I go usually has space for a solo with a couple of options. In the Ear Falls area. If interested send a P.M.
1309729,@Lunker,2011-05-21 12:42:00,835,"You could check out witchbay.com on LOTW. If they have a cabin available, they have no problem renting to solos."
1309769,horserider,2011-05-21 15:53:00,3,I was thinking the last week of June or Aug. into Sept.. Short notice is OK with me.

1310039,drlee,2011-05-22 17:20:00,409,"I have fished solo at a couple of different camps over the years. I have never been told ""no"", but the big problem is that many camps have a minimum charge per cabin, often based on as many as 4 people. So, I pay a premium if I want to stay alone. Camps that typically fill up are adverse to offering discounts on their cabins, which I fully understand. If they rent the cabin to me as a solo for $300 for the week, and could, with some patience, rent it to four people at say, $300 per week per person, they would be crazy to give me a huge discount. Kind of a tough deal for the solo fisherman."
1310042,polaris-pete,2011-05-22 17:25:00,343,"I would think that your $300 or whatever the rate is you would be paying is still better than having a vacant cabin.I myself once or twice had to solo it and even at a Camp that I thought would be filled all Season, had a couple openings and took me with no problem.Just never know, especially with the economy the way it is now."
1310081,horserider,2011-05-22 19:11:00,3,Thanks for all the info. I found a camp and made a reservation.
