565590,Guest,2007-05-25 08:52:00,0,We have a group going up to Loganberry lake in Ontario the second week of June. Has anyone fished or can anyone give me some insight into fishing this lake? I would appreciate any information I could get.

From looking at your post it sounds like we will be the next group at Loganberry after you. We will be at the cabin on June 23rd.I'm looking for info on Loganberry as well. Let me know if you hear anything and I'll do the same ! Good Luck.Mark
