1308846,DennyDawg,2011-05-19 03:54:00,23,"Hey all...looking for a little help, and some suggestions if you have the time. I'll be taking my 12 yr old son on his first trip to Canada for a fishing trip and was wondering if anyone could give me a little help deciding where to go. We'll be heading from the Thumb of Michigan and I'm trying to keep the travel distance to under 10 hours. I've been to Chapleau, and Nakina (that's just a bit too far) but was hoping to find an ""Easy"" lake to fish with my son so I can teach him as we go. Walleye/Pike/Perch.... Sorry this is so lenghty, just wanted to make sure I had all the bases covered. We'll be going around the 6th of July.Thanks"
1308854,Mike Borger,2011-05-19 05:26:00,1554,"Park's Fly In Fishing out of Hawk Junction is a good option. I called Martin (the owner) earlier this winter looking for a rate for my family this summer (kids are 4 and 7) and his prices were absolutely the best, no one even came close. We're booked for August. I've fished his lakes before and all have been the great. The cabins are spartan, but comfortable.http://www.outpostcamps.com/"
1308858,TIGHTLINER,2011-05-19 05:40:00,223,TRY LOOKING AT RAYS CAMPS ON RAMSEY LAKE. FOOD IS INCLUDED YOU DO YOUR OWN COOKING. GOOD FISHING FOR WALLEYE AND NORTHERN PIKE. NOT SURE WHERE YOU ARE LOCATED ME BEING FROM OHIO IT TAKES ANYWHERE FROM 12 TO 14 HOURS DRIVING TIME DEPENDING ON WEATHER CUSTOMS TRAFFIC. WWW.RAYSCAMPS.COM PM ME IF YOU NEED MORE INFO. NEW OWNERS YOUNG AND VERY EAGER TO HELP WHERE EVER THEY CAN. BEEN GOING THERE FOR 20+ YEARS..
1308876,DennyDawg,2011-05-19 06:39:00,23,"Thank you guys, I'll check both of those places out. I haven't been to Canada for several years, but we had really good success the further Northwest we went, but would love to find someplace closer and start a yearly trip with my son/family.CMD"

1309322,hawks_rule,2011-05-20 08:56:00,115,O'Sullivan's Rainbow would be a great place for you and your family. Not sure if this would be to far for you to drive.
1309613,DennyDawg,2011-05-21 02:45:00,23,"After some more research I've decided on Parks on lake Anjigaming, I sent you an email Solopaddler and am looking forward to your feedback. (July 6-13...I hope) I'm still working out the details and to finish up the reservation process.Thanks for all the suggestions guys!!DD"
