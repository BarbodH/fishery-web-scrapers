1309468,northernbite,2011-05-20 14:30:00,1186,"That's why I don't bring any fish home it is not worth the hassle, they don't taste good and it is just easier. ""How many fish do you have?"" ""None"" I say. And then they want to know why.Paul"
1309486,HeHooksHimself,2011-05-20 15:36:00,725,"Ha Ha, my son was 30 then (last year), but he still depends of Bank of Dad from time to time, its the way it is these days. My wife can't understand why we don't bring a cooler full back. She can't comprehend management. And, they still do taste pretty good."
1309687,eyemike,2011-05-21 09:33:00,233,"When my daughter was 9 she wanted to bring back a couple of large painted turtles. My Canadian friend said that it was illegal to take these turtles out of the country so I told her no. Well, knowing my daughter, I searched the van and lo and behold, there was a 5 gal. bucket with two turtles. I let the turtles go and off for home we went. Between Beardmore and Nipigon we were stop by 2 MNR officers who took everything out of the van. I just looked at my daughter without saying a thing. She knew. Mike..."
1310047,downriverbob,2011-05-22 17:47:00,880,"We always have a tote sheet with name and species, and gthen placecheck mark for number of each. Then when we pack we verify totals. If you had a vaccum sealer your fish would taste good for up to a year. The first year we went to Lake of the Woods we released all our pike. The next year at lunch we had fish, I stated how good the walleye was to find out that I was pike. After that we bring home a few pike, to me they eat as goods as any walleye. BOB"
1310170,GOBIG,2011-05-23 06:06:00,126,"A few years ago, we got stopped and like many people we are always legal, however the two guys doing the search walked all over our stuff in the back of the truck and broke 2 boxes. We did not say anything then, but now i do not look forward to getting stopped."
1309387,HeHooksHimself,2011-05-20 11:15:00,725,"I wanted to make sure to mention this story. We had been stopped before at MNR checkpoints so we were not surprised to see one on the way out on HWY 11 ten or so miles east of FF. No problem, we knew we were legal so we looked at it as an opportunity to have a last cigar in Canada. There were four of us and we had been tracking our fish very tightly all week as we are fans of the rules since we know it results in great fishing every year. We don't mess with northerns so we had four walleye (right at 18"") each and 2 smallies each, our limit. The MNR officer was nice and we were joking with him some, but I noticed he counted our fish several times. ""I keep coming up with 17 walleyes,"" he said and I replied, ""No way, I have counted those things a dozen time. ""Here, count them with me,"" he said and sure enough there were 17. What had once been what we thought were 16 walleye when frozen solid turned out to be 17 as they were thawing. I assured him it was a mistake but we knew he had to do something since there were at least 15 officers there, probably some of them his supervisors. He told us if we were five over he would take everything we owned but in this case it would just be like a traffic ticket. It ended up costing me $240 (the other guys said they would share the cost, but we overestimated our tax refund so i got stuck with most of it). The moral of the story- Make real sure that you double check your count!"
1309390,Knoxabilly,2011-05-20 11:20:00,225,That's a bummer :/ Sounds like the officer was nice enough probablly realizing it was a mistake but that he couldn't let you slide in this scenario. I'm guessing they had walleye for dinner that night
1309392,tv4fish,2011-05-20 11:24:00,2694,That's a real bummer - How did the fine end up being $240? In other words - is that $240 per fish or ??? We ALWAYS put 1 fish in each baggy and label it with our cabin No. I don't think we have ever seen a check station in that location before - we always find one just south of Dryden.edit: Was the checkpoint west of the turn-off to Dryden (502 north) ?
1309394,scgibby11,2011-05-20 11:28:00,109,"I understand counting the number of fillets. I understand keeping a portion of skin on the fillet for species ID. I'm not so sure, though, how you can clearly show the size of the fish once the fillets are removed.It must just be a close estimate for them if the tail and head are removed, in terms of knowing the exact size of the fish before the fillets were removed....?Did they hassle you at all about size?Scott"
1309398,HeHooksHimself,2011-05-20 11:32:00,725,"Well, perhaps it is an issue for some things, yuk yuk, but in this stop they did not question the size. I was just emphasizing that we were careful to get as much as we could but still be legal. By the way, they only took my walleye stash since I took the rap. He took four and not five. Let's just say that I enjoyed that walleye immensely for what I paid for it!"
1309401,HeHooksHimself,2011-05-20 11:41:00,725,"they just gave me a ticket and I had to mail the payment when I got home. A total of $240. We got stopped in one of these before in 03 or so and a guy there was getting his boat and truck and all his stuff taken, so they don't mess around, I guess we got off easy."
1309412,Mark R,2011-05-20 12:04:00,1538,who decided you were the one at fault? Why not one of the other guys?
1309417,Walley Guide,2011-05-20 12:21:00,67,"Each member in our group packs their walleye in individual ziplock bags. When we depart, we use a two gallon ziplock bag with your name on it and you place your individual walleye bags in that bigger bag. It is your responsibility to make sure you are not over the limit. Takes care of the nice guy needing to take the hit for the mistake. Been checked multiple times over the years, never had anyone in the group make the mistake yet. Really could care less if I take any home. They never taste as good as they do the day they are caught anyway! Happy Fishin' Walley"
1309429,HeHooksHimself,2011-05-20 12:43:00,725,Its interesting that when it became obvious that there was an issue how one of the guys (my son) became quite interested in the dandelion growth 30-40ft. from the truck. The officer asked who wanted to take the hit and during the dead silence that followed I decided it would be me. I like walleye's suggestion and we will definitely do it that way this time.
1309444,tv4fish,2011-05-20 13:26:00,2694,LOL --- NOW we need to know how old your Son is --- I would have quite a different view if he's 9 vs 29
