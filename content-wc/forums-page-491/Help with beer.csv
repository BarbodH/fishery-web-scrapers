1306702,oleJoe,2011-05-14 08:48:00,114,"We always like Labatt Blue but what ever you get, make sure your outfitter brings it in AFTER you go in. Unloaded the Walleye Wanders 22 cases of beer and other over load one year before they came in. Not the way to start home. Have fun."
1306841,bucont,2011-05-14 16:55:00,375,All this beer talk is making me thirsty. brb gotta get a cold Miller lite.
1309307,Guest,2011-05-20 08:25:00,0,O.V. the best beer in Canada
1309313,wallydave,2011-05-20 08:33:00,2151,"I saw a segment of Real Ontario Outdoors recently about planing a fishing trip to Ontario. Part of the segment included a Border guard explaining the rules going into Canada, which included adult beverage info.http://www.pursuitchannel.com/ShowDetail.asp?ShowID=120 Heres the video link, scroll down to the Sunset Country Fishing segment."
1309321,Thunderbucket,2011-05-20 08:55:00,323,"If you think olde v..... is good beer, have your friends recently recommended that you need help?"
1304213,davenathe,2011-05-08 08:29:00,113,back to subject COLD and WET beer works for me. Kokanee is a favorite can now by locally in the states.
1304755,NARDA 1,2011-05-09 15:46:00,636,"Didn't know that, where are you buying it?"
1304937,MorganMan,2011-05-09 22:15:00,341,We can buy in MN for the last several years. Check with your local chain liquor stores as to availability.
1305090,Hawkfan,2011-05-10 10:33:00,237,"Where are you from? I have seen it in MN, but not yet in Iowa. I know a liquor store owner and could talk him into getting some though if it was available here."
1305108,hawg,2011-05-10 10:59:00,2008,The closest I've found to American beer is Labatts Crystal if they still make it. It's been 3 years since I've been there though. Labatts Blue is a pretty good beer also. It's suprising how much you get used to it after the first case of the day. And remember-YOU CAN'T DRINK ALL DAY IF YOU DON'T START IN THE MORNING!
1305110,Jack77,2011-05-10 11:05:00,168,"Best thing in the world for coffee breath is a nice cold beer. Rememer that beer drinking is a marathon, not a sprint."
1305168,Shellback,2011-05-10 13:07:00,8083,"I enjoy vacationing and fishing in Canada, but your booze prices are outta site! I buy 30 packs of Coors light for $20 at home, I think they are about $35 for a 24 pack in Gan. I do buy a bottle of Scotch local for a neighbor where I dock my boat for a week. I think it's about $35.00. I'll be up in 3 weeks!! Looking forward to it!"
1305613,Mark R,2011-05-11 12:14:00,1538,$53.00 for a liter of Captain last year
1305698,Leeches,2011-05-11 15:36:00,106,Does anyone know what the duty or tax you pay on extra booze or beer above what your allowed in? I'm just guessing it's cheaper to buy extra up there.
1306282,wallydave,2011-05-12 21:24:00,2151,"Jack77, I guess you really meant to chase that morning cup with a cold one! What ever floats your boat eh! I like that ice cold beer to balance the fresh hot walleye! You have to cleanse your palate between the walleye, taters and beans!"
1303083,Terwalleye,2011-05-04 21:48:00,166,"We keep kidding around about setting up a website to sell t-shirts, hats and membership ID's. Heck, Maybe I could even pay for my Canada trip. lol"
1303350,djcoop52,2011-05-05 16:45:00,1411,Drink bud light at home but LaBatts is excellent never had the LaBatts light though. Best bet is to take all you can cross with with you canadian beer prices are high.
1303387,Guest,2011-05-05 18:32:00,0,"being on a harvesting crew in the us have drank a few barley pops down thier, if u enjoy bud light u will enjoy a coors light up here once again diff brewery and flavour up here second will offer up the kokanee and labb lite"
1303393,MorganMan,2011-05-05 18:43:00,341,"The point here is to be sure that you DO drink while you are on your fishin trip. Lotta people say they go to fish, just fish, and think the rest of us are idiots. You can do both an not be a loser. Fish hard, then cook up the feast, and drink harder after the feast. Oh, and don't be afraid to have a beer in the boat. Everyone does it and those who don't, don't throw stones!"
1303401,Bjz23,2011-05-05 18:57:00,4,Couldn't agree more Morganman......have a beer.....and a cigar.....be responsible....and enjoy yourself.....
1303403,Jack77,2011-05-05 19:01:00,168,Agreed.
1303461,Hawkfan,2011-05-05 21:11:00,237,"It sounds like your outfitter just wants to get things to your cabin as he has time/room and you won't really have the opportunity to try anything before buying. I guess I would first ask for a list of what he can get. I haven't been to that area but it sounds like it might be hard to get some things. But I agree with most others, Kokanee or Blue are the way to go. I also agree with MorganMan, have a fun trip."
1303540,wallydave,2011-05-06 07:02:00,2151,"I like a beer as much as the next guy, at times maybe even more! Several trips ago, several members of our party were caught with beer in thier boats, I'm talking about 2 beers per person, and they were fined, quite heavily by the OPP. We were in the Ear Falls section of Lac Seul, we heard that every camp or lodge, had one boat caught and fined, myself and my boat partner, had to pour out all of our beer, two bottles in total! So I would offer a warning, that if you have beer in the boat, be aware of the possibility of a fine."
1303896,Leeches,2011-05-07 00:21:00,106,"Sleemans is a good choice, I liked the flavor. I can tell you this, when your on a fishing trip with a bunch of beer drinkers make sure to buy plenty, even with the high price, treat yourself.Be safe guys!"
1304108,walleye88ia,2011-05-07 21:50:00,35,"drinking more than a boat driver can handle is stupid. sometimes when weather is cold,i might drink 0-2 beers. when the weather is warm,many of us like to party,fish,be nice to others,operate our boats away from others. if americans keep getting pissed about this crap, many lodges can kiss their a**es good bye. nice job canadian government. you will lose millions of us dollars."
1302875,vteye,2011-05-04 10:24:00,812,"I agree with Bigwalleye immerse yourself in experience and try the Canadian beer plus the bud light is different that the local brew you are accustomed too. My favorites beers in CA but not necessarily in order,Molson, Molson ice, Molson light, Blue, Blue 6%, Blue 7%, Blue 8%, Blue 10%, Blue light, Carling, Keith, Kokanee, etc you get the point."
1302877,Duckjunkie194,2011-05-04 10:29:00,351,"Last year when we crossed the border for a visit when we were in Int'l Falls, I picked up a couple cases of Kokanee.....Love it!!! I'm down to my last 6 pack and have to ration it carefully. I put a big dent in it watching playoff hockey with the neighbors. You'll be a fan of the Kokanee for sure."
1302891,earll16,2011-05-04 11:10:00,5,"I used to be a budlight ONLY drinker too, but have learned to love PBR as much or more these days......in Canada the last several times it's been Blue only. i think this year we might have to add in some Kokanee to try out....also, always grabbing some cases on way back for those fish frys @ home is very important. when eating the fresh eyes/perch, you always need that reminder of where they came from"
1302902,tv4fish,2011-05-04 12:02:00,2694,What the heck is wrong with Windsor CANADIAN or Crown Royal (We always pick up a liter of Crown Royal at the duty free shop right before we cross the border)
1302930,Lovetofish,2011-05-04 14:06:00,458,When I go up through Dryden I buy Labatts Maximum Ice and Blue. When I go up through Pigeon River it's just Blue because they don't sell Max there. I've bought other brands through the years and I've never been disappointed but the Labatts brands are my favorite. Does anybody know of a place between Pigeon River and Ignace where I can buy Max Ice?
1302938,camp chef,2011-05-04 14:20:00,915,There is a store in Upsala that might carry it. We used to stop there for licenses and beer on our way to Ignace.Right hand side if the road.
1302977,Blue Lk,2011-05-04 16:46:00,269,"I stated this on WC before & will state this again.40 Creek Barrel Select is the best Canadian Whiskey IMHO.Try it,you will not be dissapointed."
1302993,NARDA 1,2011-05-04 18:05:00,636,Never said there was anything wrong with either of those. The Special Old just happens to be my favorite.
1303034,Terwalleye,2011-05-04 19:48:00,166,"Awwww Heck, I ran a grabbed my forsted mug 'cuz I though someone had a keg they thought might spoil. For the lighter Beer fans I can say my Bro-in-law is a big Lite beer guy and really enjoyed the Canadian Molson. We did not buy Labatts Light or any other lights; but good ol' Blue and Molson are easy to find and bring back lots of good memories."
1303039,Jack77,2011-05-04 19:54:00,168,President and Co-Founder of the Society for the Preservation of Sport Fishing and Beer Drinking in America (a.k.a. S.F.T.P.O.S.F.A.B.D.I.A.) Where do I join?
1302663,jow,2011-05-03 18:47:00,20,First find out whats available.I doubt the stock in Nakina is as good as a bigger towns beer store.Carling for me if its available
1302674,bigwalleye1,2011-05-03 19:12:00,2632,"Just saw this thread and thought it was like the radio call from the cop that has more donuts than he can eat! Now that I'm over that initial disappointment, my advice is to drink something in Canada you can't get in the US. Bringing beer to Canada is like bringing your own bourbon to Kentucky. While I'm not a ""Blue"" guy, I do like Kokanee, or good Canadian Rye Whiskey. Immerse yourself in the whole Canadian experience!"
1302718,smackthewalleyes,2011-05-03 21:09:00,9,"We are having our guy fly us in a case of blue, molsen Canadian, and kokanee.....also, he is going to have a bottle of captain Morgan waiting for us with some coke! We are bringing some of our usa favorites across the border as well (1 case each). Should be enough for two guys! Ha ha. We have never had any of these beers mentioned above, but we are doing the whole Canadian experience and are looking forward to some new tasting beers! Can't wait for July!"
1302736,MorganMan,2011-05-03 22:10:00,341,"Here Here for Kokanee. We have tried many, many Canadian beers and Kokanee is our favorite. Blue Light close second...til we tried Kokanee. Beer is good, but we tend to like the lighter side like these...maybe we don't get the beer thing."
1302754,walleye88ia,2011-05-03 22:55:00,35,I agree with MorganMan
1302775,ed08walleye,2011-05-04 05:25:00,27,"mmmmmmm, beer!"
1302805,wallydave,2011-05-04 07:19:00,2151,"Help with beer, I was hoping you could just a few in the cabin for the next guys!!!!!!"
1302818,slobco,2011-05-04 07:55:00,19,Blue for sure
1302830,IowaDave,2011-05-04 08:20:00,69,"At home I drink Bud Light and only Bud Light- can't stand anything else. When I'm in Canada I drink Labatts Blue and only Labatts Blue- very, very good beer!!"
1302853,NARDA 1,2011-05-04 09:19:00,636,"Skip the Captain Morgan and have him bring you a bottle of Hiram Walker Special Old Rye Whiskey, it goes great with coke, water or on the rocks."
1302598,GOBIG,2011-05-03 16:02:00,126,"I am going on a fly in an the outfitter asked me for a list or amount of beer that i would want in camp, of course i am paying. I usually drink mich. Ultra or bud light cans, but love killians on draft. What canadian beer is similar to those. I have not had many canadian beers to any suggestions would be great. I am going on a trip out of nakina june 3, so i will try some canadian beer while up there. Thank you in advance."
1302599,camp chef,2011-05-03 16:09:00,915,You are soon to be inundated with beer opinions.....I'll go first. Labatts Blue or Kokanee
1302602,Jack77,2011-05-03 16:15:00,168,"I saw "" Beer Help"" and I thought man this is right down my alley. I always drink Bud Light myself and our outfitter is getting that for us but I understand your desire to want to step out of your comfort zone. I would get a 15 pack of a couple of different brands. I have had Molson and labatts in Canada and liked them both. I am not much of an adventurer when it comes to beer. Just a suggestion that your fishing trip out in the bush might not be the best time to get crazy with beer selections. You are stuck with what you have. I would stick to the basics and leave the taste testing to the bar in Nakina the night before you get on the plane. That's just me. I am getting 4 cases of Bud Light, I know what I am getting and will not be disappointed."
1302618,NARDA 1,2011-05-03 16:52:00,636,"I agree with Camp chef, Kokanee or Labatts Blue."
1302619,midwest,2011-05-03 17:00:00,25,"Just so you know, the Bud Light in Canada will taste nothing like the Bud Light you are used to in the US. Same can, but brewed at a different brewery and it will be a higher % alcohol. Still a safe selection if that is what you normally drink, but just don't expect it to be the same."
1302621,Jack77,2011-05-03 17:05:00,168,Yeah we now that there is a difference but like you said it is close and something that we can live with.
1302629,Outfitter17,2011-05-03 17:32:00,127,"Bud Light in Canada is Excellent. I usually drink that at home in the Us and enjoy it, but the CA bud light is a bit different as people have already mentioned and I really like it."
1302631,digjig,2011-05-03 17:38:00,146,Now that we have opened Pandora's keg so to speak... My vote simply cannot be contained to a single flavor. 1. Sleemans 2. Molson Canadian 3. Blue 4. Kokanee That rounds out my top 4. A case of each and you are good to go. -DJ
1302637,joeman79,2011-05-03 17:57:00,417,"Beer the nectar of the gods. If you like Bud Light you will like Kokanee, a delicious B.C. Brew. Alexander Kieths IPA is a very smooth Beer also. LaBatts Blue Light is going to be on my to try list this time. And a few others W.C ers have suggested"
1302650,Lazy Fisherman,2011-05-03 18:25:00,276,Kokanee. You won't be disappointed.
