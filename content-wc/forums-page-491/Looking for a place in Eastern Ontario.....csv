1282532,JinxCanada,2011-03-15 07:47:00,1306,LOL!!! Now that's just funny.
1283862,Superdad,2011-03-18 13:18:00,64,"About an hour and a half west of the 1000 Bridge is the Bay of Quinte, which has some of the best walleye and bass fishing in eastern Ontario and you won't have to drive another 12 hours to fish. Do a google search for quintefishing.com and you can find the camps and all the info that you'll need."
1306676,lund_prosport,2011-05-14 06:34:00,44,"Hey flocknocker, I'm in Berks county near ""the big city"" lol. We go to Nordlaw Lodge on Bob's Lake, in the general area you mention. It is a great place with comfortable accomodations, great food (American plan), dockage for your boat, fuel and oil (if needed) for your boat, and great fishing. It is a mixed largemouth/smallmouth water, with perch and walleye also. The Stewart family owns and operates the lodge, and they make you feel at home and welcome. I highly recommend it. www.nordlawlodge.com"
1308841,DennyDawg,2011-05-19 00:15:00,23,"Hello all....it looks like we've finally decided on a Lake....now just hoping for some information or opinions on some of the available places. It looks like we'll be heading to Lady Evelyn Lake: Staying at either Island 10 or Garden Island I think, unless anyone knows of any places we're forgetting to look into. I would like to hear some of your opinions on these places if you've stayed or fish in or around this area.ThanksDDUpdate: After some more research I've decided on Parks on lake Anjigaming. (July 6-13...I hope) I'm still working out the details and to finish up the reservation process."
1308863,micropterus,2011-05-19 05:46:00,450,Staying at Garden Island at the end of June. Prefer that end of the lake.
1309007,adempsey,2011-05-19 12:24:00,963,"There are two other camps on the lake you can check out for comparison:Red Pine Wilderness Lodge andEllen Island CampRed Pine has an American plan and I have read some good reports about the resort. I like that you get your own private dock too. Ellen Island is a housekeeping camp. Smaller and more cost-effective. I talked with the owners at a show last year. They seem quite nice.I have not stayed at either of these places, but I don't see any reason why I wouldn't. I have stayed at Garden Island and Island 10 though.Both places have really nice boats, good staff and a lot of food. The owner of Island 10 is a pilot and there is a plane on site if you have any concerns about medical emergencies and whatnot. Island 10 turns off the power on the island at 11pm (the generator on the island is kinda noisy, but not terrible - depends where you are in relation to it). I am pretty sure the power is on 24 hours at Garden Island.Personally, I prefer Garden Island for minor reasons (location on the lake - although bad weather would probably be more of an issue here than at Island 10), central lodge is nicer), but it's hard to beat the prices of Island 10 for a similar experience (it's about $300 cheaper per person). Island 10 might be booked up by now though.I had good fishing in the areas surrounding both lodges. If you are the type that likes to explore around a lot, Garden Island is more central and is a good starting point to hit all sides of the lake. However, Island 10 is really only about a <15 minute boat ride east of Garden Island. I don't think you'll be disappointed with whatever you choose."
1274652,flocknocker,2011-02-24 08:53:00,33,I am looking for any information on some good places to hit in Eastern Ontario. I am looking for nice walleye and smallmouth fishing. Looking to be up for 5 days and will be bringing our own boat. I would like the place to provide the american plan and decent cottages. We will be crossing into ontario at the thousand island bridge. I have checked alot of places out at the outdoor show and some on other sites but would like some input from others than the references they have on the sheets. Here is one place I am looking at www.aragainlodge.com . It seems to be a decent place right down the road from where I stayed the last time I was up there over 20 years ago. Thanks for any input......
1274721,doubleheader,2011-02-24 11:56:00,2652,You might try Memquisit Lodge. It's on Nipissing's west arm. The smallmouth fishing is quite good and the walleye fishing can be anything from fair to very good. We go there every year and take our boats. Depending on the cabin you can have a private dock. http://www.memquisitlodge.net/
1274791,captnzero,2011-02-24 15:21:00,15,Try auld reekie lodge. You won't regret staying with them. Pm me if you need any more info. www.auldreekielodge.com
1274878,adempsey,2011-02-24 18:53:00,963,"I would suggest looking at a place on Lady Evelyn Lake:http://www.island10.com/http://www.garden-island.com/http://www.redpinelodge.com/They are all boat-ins, but I am fairly certain you can bring your own boat [they will have to trailer it up to the top of a **** though - I think it costs like $10-$20 or something]. I have stayed at both Island 10 and Garden-Island. I would recommend both places. I have not stayed at Red Pine, but I know many people recommend that lodge as well.The lake is primarily a walleye fishery, but there are some nice bass in it too (I caught plenty).Elephant Lake is supposed to have good bass fishing, but never been.You could try out the noto.net trip builder as well for some more suggestions. There are a lot of places in Quebec too. It's worth some looking into in my opinion if you want to stay further east."
1275651,flocknocker,2011-02-26 20:36:00,33,Thanks guys for the info. I will be checking into all of them.
1279710,OutfitterJoe,2011-03-08 16:10:00,27,"If your looking for a affordable drive in, and you don't mind a bit longer drive, check out Horwood Lake Lodge west of Timmins, Ont. Good walleye, northern population. do a search to get web info"
1279767,ohiojmj,2011-03-08 17:54:00,1262,"From 1000 islands bridge, I'd check out Gouin. Immense lake system and remote."
1280070,JinxCanada,2011-03-09 08:49:00,1306,"um curious..but WTF is the ""american plan""???"
1280083,Jack77,2011-03-09 09:07:00,168,Meals are prepared for you and typically your cabin is cleaned every day.
1282329,mickr,2011-03-14 17:56:00,74,aragain lodge is on kashwakamak lake - the fishing is not what it used to beif you are going earlier inthe season it is actually pretty good if you can identify a few spots and get on some patternsif you are going in the summer - fishing is not so hot
