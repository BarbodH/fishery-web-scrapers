1308988,Northern Exposure,2011-05-19 11:21:00,29,I will be up the road a little further for a week starting June 4th and thought about coming back and fishing here for a day. There is a boat launch on the north end of outlet bay. Anyone ever fish that part of the lake. If I go there I will post a report.
