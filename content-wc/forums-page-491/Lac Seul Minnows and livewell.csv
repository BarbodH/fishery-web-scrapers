My plan has been to put them on ice (the few we'll keep) in a cooler.I had thought about using my livewell for keeping minnows--they do keep very well in there, as it is large volume, and the minnows don't get banged around as much as in a bucket.Then I ran across this in the MNR bait regulations:No Release of BaitIt is illegal to release any live bait or dump the contents of a bait bucket, including the water, into any waters or within 30 m of any waters.Obviously the livewell would be continually circulating the bait's water. Would this be illegal?Scott"
1309330,midwest,2011-05-20 09:07:00,25,"Never heard of that before, but every baitwell circulates water, and most every lodge gives you a minnow bucket that hangs over the side of the boat...the water is contsantly circulating in that."
1309331,JDP,2011-05-20 09:07:00,1457,"You are legal.You can use the livewell for minnows.If you concerned about the water in an oxygen packed plastic bag from a bait shop, simply scoop the minnows into your livewell containing lake water and dump the plastic bag on shore.The law is the same for example in the state of Minnesota.You cannot dump your minnow bucket into the lake."
