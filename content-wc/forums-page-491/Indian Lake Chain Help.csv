1308558,JohnnyV12,2011-05-18 11:28:00,9,"Anyone fish the Indian Lake Chain (Edward, Indian, Forrest and Boulder Lakes). Booked on the Muskie Opener this year. Thought it would be a good (muskie) starter lake for my 2 sons. Also looking for good smallmouth water near by. Any insights to the Indian Lake Chain: Lure Choice, Color structure to key in on. Thanks GuysJohnny V"

Or Forest Lake Lodge?I can't really help with lures/colors since we always go for walleye ... perhaps someone else can help with that. I will only say that we generally only fish the Cobble, Whitney & Forest lakes and it is unusual if we DON'T catch a muskie while jigging for walleye.They can be found ... and there are definitely some big ones out there!!! :-)Good Luck!!!"
1309273,JohnnyV12,2011-05-20 07:28:00,9,"Mr. Bolen,Great to hear from you. As I have done some web research on the Indian Lake Chain. I have enjoyed your web site and video's (all). Beautiful place you have up there on Forrest. We are staying at a private rental cabin on Edward (June 18th-25th). Might be poor timing with the may flies and walleyes. What jig colors, style produce most of your eyes? Tipped with minnow (fathead?) or leech ? I have looked at your marked up lake map too. I appreciate the public knowledge you have shared. Are there smallmouth in cobble or are there other lakes around (corner, blue or canyon) that we could trailer too for good smallmouth action.Thanks John V"
1309615,81Saluki,2011-05-21 03:58:00,97,"Glad to hear you found my web site and enjoyed the maps & video! :-)Muskie follow-up -- Since you will be staying on Edwards Lake, you're pretty much centrally located within a short ride to the major hot spots on the chain. If I remember correctly, there is a place along the north side of Edwards called Muskie Bay should be good if the name is any indication of what you can find there. :-)RE: Walleye -- We usually start off with an unpainted jighead with a chartreuse or red twister tail, tipped with half a night crawler. If that doesn't work, we'll experiment with various jighead/tail/color/size combinations before going into town and buying leeches or minnows. But that's just us. Some people swear by leeches while others prefer minnows.RE: Smallies -- Sorry, but I can't help you here. We fish exclusively within the chain and catch a smallie from time-to-time ""by accident"". I know there are people who come to the chain for the smallies, but I don't have a clue as to the ""whats, wheres, & hows"" to catch them. Hopefully your recent additional post will get you some good leads. Forest Lake Lodge used to offer drive-to (guided only?) trips nearby for smallies but I don't know if they're still available. Give Blair a call to see if they still offer smallmouth outings. Best Wishes!"
1309632,Blue Lk,2011-05-21 07:01:00,269,"V12,there are smallmouths in Blue Lk.They can be found on the nest untill about July 1.The lake is so clear you can easily see them in up to 10/12 ft of water on a calm day.The nests are easy to spot,a depression in the sand 18/20 inchs in diameter allways around some sort of structure(dead tree,submerged log).You spot a nest the bass is not far away.I don't fish them because I don't think it is very sporting,they are very aggressive at this time & will attack any intruder into the area.I allways get 1 under my dock & he will come out & give you a bump if you get too close while swimming.Enjoy your trip to this area,IMHO it is 1 the prettiest areas in Sunset Country.BTW,the evening walleye bite in Corner Lk can be excellent."
1309834,bpetersen,2011-05-21 21:08:00,251,Just fish for walleye and you will have musky contact all the time.
1309914,81Saluki,2011-05-22 07:30:00,97,"Agreed ... This happens often here. Last year Dad caught a decent walleye and, as he got it to the surface, a nice muskie appeared with jaws wide open and Dad saw it nail the walleye broadside. A brief fight ensued until the muskie finally let go. That's not entirely unusual as we get such hits from time-to-time each trip. But the rest was unique ...I didn't get my line out of the water fast enough during the tug-of-war and when Dad finally got the walleye into the boat, my jig was wrapped around his line. Fortunately it wasn't too bad and he untangled it fairly quickly and tossed my jig back into the water. A few seconds later, my line went tight and went under the boat. I tightened up and then a big fish jumped out of the water on the other side of the boat! It was (we assume) the same muskie. I worked it back to my side of the boat and brought it to the surface long enough for a good look at its size ... around 36"". Then it took off again and grabbed some air a couple more times before shaking the jig loose.What fun!!81Saluki"
