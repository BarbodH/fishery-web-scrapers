1309120,sault eyes,2011-05-19 16:47:00,268,"The reason that brookies are not as numerous in the around lake of the woods is because the MNR doesn't stock that many around there. In the Algoma district, Wawa, Hornepayne, Sudbury area almost all lakes with brook trout are stocked and never had any kind of fish in them at all (except minnows). Also if a lake has perch in it, brook trout will not fare well. That is why they plant splake in those lakes. Splake can co habitate with perch. Around lake of the woods most lakes around there have walleye/perch in them and the MNR generally do not stock over natural populations."
1309147,Mike Borger,2011-05-19 18:41:00,1554,I'm a retard. Could you copy and paste it and send it to the original poster? I'd do it myself but I'm leaving for Nakina in 5 minutes.
1309203,clearis,2011-05-19 22:20:00,47,Pasha Lake Cabins is in the Nipigon watershed and many of the streams and some lakes have outstanding brook trout fishing. The resort is a drive to. The fishing is 20 to 90 minutes from the resort depending on targeted fish. Very reasonably priced. See www.pashalake.com
1309327,sault eyes,2011-05-20 09:01:00,268,My #1 choice for big brookies is in the Hornepayne area. Underfished and monster brookies everywhere. Most lakes are drive to.
1307942,jigpig50,2011-05-17 08:54:00,9,I am looking for a lodge preferably a drive in to fish brook trout. Wondering if anyone has been to a place that provides that opportunity and would share their experineces. Thanks in advance.
1307986,fishman10,2011-05-17 10:32:00,226,"nipigon area has world class brookies. quebec lodge is located in red rock. not on the lake. royal windsor lodge is on the lake. rustic cabins, i have not stayed at either. 22 inch size restriction has helped the fishery greatly."
1308049,Mike Borger,2011-05-17 12:21:00,1554,"I can help, but where are you located, how far are you willing to drive and what's your price range?Also what are your expectations? If it's numbers of trophy fish 5lb's and greater you're looking at big $$$$.If it's quality fishing for fish in the 15-20"" range there's plenty of cheaper options."
1308551,Guest,2011-05-18 11:18:00,0,"Does anyone know the biological. climate, or other reason why brook trout are not present in the Lake of the Woods area?"
1308617,jigpig50,2011-05-18 13:48:00,9,"Solo looking for a week of fishing brookie streams first, brookie lakes second with walleye an option. would like the 15"" and up. not into the 5lb.ers. coming from wis. dont need tajmah hall but would like a decent place with not much pressure. appreciate any info"
1308626,Bill Krejca,2011-05-18 13:56:00,6107,"It is my understanding that they are quite susceptible to warm water and will not handle pollutants in the water. They, seemingly, are also relatively easy to catch, can get fished out pretty easy. Most authorities on them say that, like the buffalo, their range was once wide spread, and they were slowly exterminated from most cool temperature waters as civilization crept west/north. Occasionally, someone will catch one in O'Sullivan Lake, near Nakina, where I go, which has a number of brookie streams running into it. There seems to be numerous brook trout water in northern Canadian waters. Bill"
1308645,fishman10,2011-05-18 14:31:00,226,there is also a 22 inch size restriction in all lake superior tribs up to the first barrier.
