1151007,Nimstug,2009-11-30 12:45:00,2605,"Hi,This is somewhat related to the Fishing with Strangers thread. All my Canada trips have been done with my son or my wife. My bass fishing partner has finally gotten the hint, after sharing numerous stories and photos, and he's kicking around a group trip. The invitees would be some of the guys at our church. My partner spoke to one other guy at church that has fished in Canada and he has expressed interest. Right now it's all very informal. We don't know when and we haven't decided where. We're at four. I am the only one with a boat. From what I've read here, I think I have enough information on stuff like division of labor, pooling money to share expenses. How do you decide on a trip date? Set a time frame or have everyone check their calendars or have everyone list the weeks they are not available to find common time.Do you always try to keep and even number participants? I would prefer to not to have three. My boat is big enough for three and I've fished with three but I don't think I'd like to do that for a week. To me 5 and 7 are better odd numbers. Would you ask say the 5th guy who wants to go to find a 6th?How do you handle someone having to drop out after deposits and arrangements are done? (I would think you have to set your budget for a trip based on one less than you think you will have.)What is your idea good group number?. Any other problems you run into the first time you organized a group trip?I've talked to my partner about some of the places I've fished and options such as fly-in, boat-ins and drive to. Have you had problems reaching a consensus on destination? Any thoughts about organizing a first time group trip are welcome. I'm not sure I even know the questions to ask.Thanks,NimstugDuty on alcohol is not an issue in this situation....."
1151032,Mohleye,2009-11-30 13:49:00,368,"If you have a group of four right now who are pretty committed to going, and you feel this is a good core group that would make for a fun trip regardless of whether anyone else goes, I wouldn't approach anyone else until the four of you have decided on a week and a destination. It can really be hard to find a week that will work for everyone if the group gets too big, and too much input on where to go can be overwhelming. Once you know where and when, it should be fairly easy to at least put together a rough estimate of the total trip cost. Then the four of you can decide whether it makes sense to invite others. It's a lot easier to say: We're going to this camp on this week, and we think the total cost will be roughly this amount, if you're interested, let us know by Jan 1. You'll also have some basic information as far as the distance, travel time, type of fishing, what you'll need to bring, etc. All this info makes it a lot easier for others to decide whether or not they're really interested. You'll have to reach a consensus as a group how you want to handle a cancellation. Most camps require a non-refundable deposit. If someone needs to back out after they've paid their deposit, you'll need to decide whether they are responsible for finding a replacement, the group will look for a replacement, or whether he simply loses his deposit. The problem with having that person find a replacement is that he may find someone who isn't very compatible with the rest of the group. This is an area where you can really have some problems and hard feelings, so make your decision early on and stick to it. I've made over thirty trips, with groups from 2 to 14, and they've all been good. About 5 years ago, the core group of four decided to keep the trip smaller in size mainly because it was getting to be too much hassle dealing with these issues."
1151043,Guest,2009-11-30 14:48:00,0,"My pals and I have been organizing fishing trips to Canada for about 25 year (fly in, drive to and camping). Here are few things we learned along the way:  Rule # 1  All star lineup. You'll be more that fishing with these guys for a week. You will also be sharing chores, meals, money and living with each other. One slacker can upset the mood for all. Sometimes is it a pleasure to help out a friend. Other times you don't feel like being den mother telling someone it is their turn for the dishes, etc.  Try to align expectations: My group likes to spend a lot of time on the water and not in the cabin (no naps, no early dinners). In the morning we get dressed, pack boat bag, pack cooler, reload shore lunch box, gas boat and go. We're usually underway before 8AM. Breakfast might be bagels in the boat or a hot breakfast in the cabin if it is nasty out. Lunch is on shore or sammiches in the boat. Back at the dock after 7PM, dinner around 8. Your group may like something different. It's nice to be on the same schedule.  Where to go - Search the archives for fly in vs. drive to. Availability, cost, required gear, etc. You can try to pick a spot at the All Canada Show (Rosemont show has gotten pretty lame). If you can pick an outfitter before January, you might be able to snag a primo week from a cancellation. You already know the drill.  When to go: We like to go late June/early July (NW Ontario). The few regulars who commit get to pick the place and time. We then announce it to the other candidates. These are the guys who are great on trips but don't want to commit with a deposit until 2 months before the trip (excuses include; money, work vacation, matrimonial harmony). Tough love time. First four guys with a deposit get to go (OK that is the bluff). Most years a few of us stick our necks out and make deposits and the stragglers get to procrastinate. If someone gets serious, then he gets a vote.  Our favorite number of participants is four. Two per boat. Makes the day interesting sharing fishing information. Anything more than 5 and you have a crowd. Harder to coordinate larger meals, keeping everybody on the same schedule, etc.  Meals  We used to meet for a pre-dinner and plan the week's menu & grocery list. Now we just revise the old grocery spreadsheet (originally created with Lotus1-2-3).  Consensus - When we first started going on these trips we would discuss our criteria before going to the All Canada (or Rosemont) show. We were lucky that we all pretty much wanted the same thing. At first we remoteness and fishing action (Fly in), Next we wanted more fish and improved accommodations (Fly in). Then we all wanted bigger fish and the luxury of our own boats (drive in). The hardest part of organizing the trip is getting the interested to commit. Many times making and announcing decisions is easier than presenting choices and trying to get a decision by committee. You might be concerned that you have sound like mr bossypants, but others are delighted with the trip and relieved that they did not have to make tough decisions. However, I dunno what your group will be like. The logistics usually work their way out:  When are we leaving?  Who is driving?  Any compensation for the boat owner (usually no)  Keep receipts and square up at the end of the trip  Who is doing the grocery shopping?  Who is bringing community gear (shore lunch kit, walkie talkies, thermos, etc,) FWIW  my group usually has three regulars and the fourth or fifth guy usually comes from a pool of five candidates."
1151189,IRISHATTACK,2009-12-01 06:47:00,44,"OH, YES START A ""KITTY"". One guy head up getting all the meals for the trip. If that guy is good, get together and set up a meal plan. Then get one guy who wants to organize the food. That way everyone going has a say. Put some money in a Kitty, and put one person is charge of it. Always go alittle higher to avoid asking for more money. I personally like even number of fishermen. Two to a boat, in most cases works the best. One bad slaker can really ruin the trip, best to talk of things to do each day to avoid one person getting stuck doing all the crap jobs. It take a little effort to make a group trip go well. If all parties are willing, then the trip will be fine."
1151226,jokerjim,2009-12-01 09:25:00,473,"Alot depends on where you are going to eat. If you eat at the resort dining room, then the number of guys could be more. If you are eating in your cabin, then less guys is better. Getting more than six guys to agree on meals is going to be hard. You also have to have guys who ""play well with others"". The more guys involved the harder it is to have them all get along and agree on the many things that are involved in a successful trip. Also be sure if you have a smoker in your group the other members of your party are ""cool"" with that. When my buddy and I started going fishing with my Uncles group we did alot of extra stuff( dishes, loading boats, fish cleaning etc.) because we were the ""new guys"". Be sure everyone helps out with the chores. There always seems to be at least one guy who figures he's on vacation and shouldn't have to help out. Needless to say this guy wasn't invited the next trip."
1151228,johnboat,2009-12-01 09:37:00,2014,"I'd stick with a cash kitty. Credit card recipts, Canadian conversions, and computer spreadsheets..........OH MY!! Just reach into the cash kitty and done. Then with the lodge bill you'll just have to divide by the number of people there. DONE! 5 seconds. We did the conversion-recipt-seprate gas thing the first year and it was a mathamatical nightmare of mammoth proportions! (of course none of use claim to be the shinniest lure in the tacklebox) Correct with the snacks. Everybody is on their own. One man's Twinkie is another mans Little Debbie. (or Hostess peach fruit pie in my case) Same with the pop. I love to obsess and plan the trip out each year to try to better it. But don't I sweat it if a minor detail is forgotten. After all it is VA CA TION away from everything. Sometimes tho that one little thing you bring along that you take for granted means the most. Like................................. John B.O.A.T."
1151238,Golden Eagle,2009-12-01 10:37:00,2642,"I had two different groups for a week each last May. Food bill was $32 each, except for a nine year old who paid less. Guys bring their own drinks and boat snacks. Total fishermen was 12. We had food left over. Bought 35 pounds of peanut oil at Sam's Club and left about 2 gallons with the camp owner.I strained the oil after each use. We go with two meals a day. How does this compare with others?"
1151256,Guest,2009-12-01 12:44:00,0,"I have been the planner for lots of trips. A few thoughts: 1. Make sure everyone on board has a clean record or has been ""rehabilitated"" by the Canadian Government. We had a guy turned back at 3 AM because of a DWI from 1980. Caused a lot of chaos and put a damper on the trip. 2. Use even #s of people...2 per boat. 3. We like our food....many great cooks in our group. Have an individual buy and plan for an entire meal. On your arrival, everyone checks in with what they spent for food, add it up, divide by the # of participants. 4. Split up the incidental stuff. Have a meeting where you set up who is bringing what...ie: Toilet paper, dish soap, paper plates, munchies, crisco, catsup , potatoes etc. etc. Each guy keeps track of what he spends. 5. When you have the amount per guy, get it settled on day one. We have a guy that comes all the way up from New Orleans...he brings no groceries obviously. So he owes the full amount. Maybe I spent $20 more than the amount....I get $20 back. Not hard to do and fair to all. 6. Try your best to get compatible folks lined up. No need for hassles while on a great vacation. No mean drunks! 7. Our core group decides where and when we go. Throw the date and location out and SET A DEADLINE for others to either go or stay. There's always next year if a guy can't make it. 8. All the places we have been to require a deposit. If someone backs out at the last minute, it's his problem, not the groups. Been doing this for almost 20 years now and love every trip. Can't wait till the next one. Have fun!"
1151279,Riceburner,2009-12-01 15:04:00,436,"How do you guys handle this?: Every year, the same guy drives his large dependable vehicle full of group groceries and pulls his boat. Some guys in the group never drive or don't have a boat. Another issue to think about is a major mechanical issue on a pulling vehicle, or (hope not) an accident involving insurance.... Boat seats, tires, repairs, etc. aren't cheap now days.....or is that too picky ???"
1151295,Nimstug,2009-12-01 16:36:00,2605,"I'll jump in here for a minute and hope this keeps going. Extremely informative.My opinion, it's picky.If our trip happens, I'll be the one pulling the only boat. So what? Yeah, I may have a little more stuff in my boat. I plan on going anyway with my son, so how much more can it cost to haul some extra stuff. In reality I think the total cost of the trip to me will be less, because it will be divided 4 or ? instead of 2. I'll just make sure I'm not overloaded.Nimstug...and I don't have to fish out of a camp boat."
1151305,Steve of Madison,2009-12-01 17:37:00,230,"Here's what I do....I set the date, place (same since 2000), and invite the guests. Sometimes the group is as large as 10 as few as 3, depending on what is going on in the world. When a guy is invited I give them a drop dead date for confirmation, and a deposit must be made to me by that date, if not too bad, if they have to drop out later they lose the deposit, again too bad. That deposit is sent to the Camp we stay at.I ask for any special dietary requirements but the menu has been set over the last several years, I do the groceries and beer/booze from a second deposit. Travel gas is also paid for from the second deposit. Any other shared items are added up and split evenly.I have had many experiences with different types of guests, and they are guests! Our core group consists of 4-5 of us and newbies are made to understand the rules of our trip. They share the workload, ie cooking, cleaning dishes, etc. We have left a guy in the cabin and went fishing without him all day when he couldn't get up in the morning because of a hang-over, he was pissed, but he didn't do that again. We have also informed another guy that he does the dishes for the last 4 days or he finds another way home. Needless to say they have not been invited back. Our group goes up to fish, and spend some really special time together, a bad guest can ruin the trip faster than bad fishing. CLUE...if they ask how much beer/booze they can bring along, or if they can drink in the boat, I uninvite them. Don't get me wrong, I am in lust with Kokanee, but fishing comes first. I don't have to go to Canada to drink!There have been some really good suggestions already posted, everybody does it a little different. Just have fun doing it!"
1151589,bpetersen,2009-12-02 22:12:00,251,"Many good suggestions on this thread. I have been going to Canada for 25 years with groups from 3 to 12. Here are some things we do. 1. One kitty with $x included up front by each person. We go a little economical and put in $650 each. 2. One person is in charge of paying the bills. 3. The last few years, I have people not furnishing vehicles for travel, plan and furnish food for one evening meal. It has really worked well. People try to out do each other and we get some fantastic meals. The number of people supplying an evening meal depends on how many nights of fish you are planning on having. It does help cut expenses a little because the people not furnishing a vehicle will have the cost of at least one meal."
1152364,sptrix,2009-12-05 20:52:00,175,"Great thread. It's interesting reading everyone's recommendations.I've been going to Canada for 20 years (I'm 38) with groups from 2 - 10. Personally, I've found smaller groups are easier to deal with. But those trips with larger groups that have made things easier typically had a few common threads:* A kitty (everyone throws in a certain amount up front and remaining expenses are divided equally on the last day); or* One person pays for everything and everyone reimburses that person. This is typically what we do. I've never had issues with anyone not paying me, and I enjoy getting the extra points on my Cabelas card.I agree with those who've said that offering too many options is problematic. I put together the food for all my trips, including a trip I was invited on by my father-in-law this fall with his group, which was celebrating their 20th anniversary trip. I circulate an email with about twice a many meals as we plan to have and ask people to eliminate anything they don't want. Typically I'm left with more than enough options.Also, I agree with what others have said about snacks: everyone for themselves. Much easier this way. But I can tell you that it's easy to see trends.Finally, I do have a recommendation for everyone . . . take notes. A couple years ago I started writing down what the group ate every single day in order to get a better idea of what we REALLY needed, since we seemed to always have twice as much food as we needed. This is one of the best things we've ever done because it saves space (and some guys appreciate the financial savings as well).Tight lines.SP"
1152404,tly,2009-12-06 04:32:00,1900,"Been at this since early 80's and processes have evolved. Have been very fortunate, with only a couple or three clinkers, mainly drinking or forgetting to pay. Have two long term core groups so history is good. The posts so far are all pretty much right on. with group circumstances dictating what may be best. In our world we have very few variables because of history and record keeping. What works for us is: - We select a time frame and use it as a basis each year. Few surprises. If ya can't go so be it - As a group we select destination, prioritizing in event primary camp is full or whatever - Assign 1 person to make contact, manage the deposit and all communication - Determine whose boat, who drives (no allowance for compensating those folks ever) - Working from a master list of equipment assign responsibilities (drift socks, coolers, first aid, stoves etc) - Use a check list of personal items, it is a real plus for rookies (sunblock, bug stuff, apparel...) - Agree in principle what the menu is to be (be aware of food allergies too) including plan for few fish - Make one person responsible for all meal planning. For us this is three lists 1) stuff to prepare/freeze, 2) items we buy locally to take, 3) list of items to buy at destination - we like to support locals - For preplanned stuff we volunteer for whatever, locally one person buys and packs it all - At destination we hand out lists by category, several people & carts charging around so we can get in/out. We have totes or coolers reserved for what we think the bulk we buy will be - We do not operate on a kitty basis. Lodging, licenses, snacks/pop, meals enroute are individual responsibility - gas, bait, or any items not covered above are recorded on a log (who, how much, what, currency) the log begins with deposits and groceries/supplies prior to leaving and then all expenses are entered - At the final stop we top off tanks, do final update on log. Then break out the laptop and enter the log into a spreadsheet. This spreadseet results in total $, share/person then backs off what has been paid resulting in what each person owes. This is maybe a 10 minute job tops. Risk is that someone may not have $$ at end. They call em deadbeats and former participants. We have only been stiffed once and we changed the participant count, recalculated and each took a bigger hit - Divide up remaining stuff. That which is reusable for next trip (foil, dish soap ...) is stored in a tote by someone. Otherwise folks just grab what they think they may be able to use. We plan pretty tight so there is generally not alot left to pick from - Finally, we inventory what came back so the net result is a guideline for next trip. We were surprised in early years how much mileage some stuff got on round trip/unused as well as the expense This doesn't do much good for a first trip planning but should provide some processes for that trip as well as a basis for subsequent trips. As previously mentioned, the planning and anticipation are a large part of the experience. If anyone wants logs or spreadsheets (Excel/Open Office) PM me."
1152723,Guest,2009-12-07 15:10:00,0,Great tip on keeping notes and refining your lists. One beat up can of cream corn has made 12 trips so far - we bring it along just for tradition.
1152738,AllenW,2009-12-07 16:21:00,11482,"Good stuff so far.In our groups we found 4 was the best number, 6 usually worked and after that its hard to get that many people to work together.I used to be a cook so that's what I volunteered to do.Premake everything you can, we freeze things like eggs and milk, the eggs we freeze in plastic milk cartons and just pour out for meals.Same for anything else you can premake.A little work and few questions and you can find what most people will eat.Make a list of things to do and find people to do it.Don't depend on fish for meals, I've hit Red and got blown off it two days in a row, you can always bring the canned and dry goods home.Deposits are non refundable unless you or your family dies.Nothing worse than the ""oh I can't go because the wife says...""Pick a date most can go, the more people the harder it is to find a date everybody can live with.Set up ground rules for fishing, We fish Red and that lake is easy to get lost on, we like to keep the newbies close at hand, besides if something happens, you have help.Unless you get a deal on bait, have each boat buy there own, bait is expensive in Canada.If you get a cabin, make sure you get one big enough that that rainy lightning day you can't go out, you have room to spend the day in the cabin without crowding each other.Make sure all know if your gonna keep fish or not, you stick a totally catch and release guy in with a bunch looking for shore lunch you could have problems.For your first trip, take more stuff than you need, and less people, 4 was mentioned and I'd think 4 would be about right, 6 max in three boats.And above all, have patience, not everybody thinks like you and a bit of compromise goes a long ways.Have fun.Al"
1153135,Steve of Madison,2009-12-09 11:21:00,230,I've got the traditional can of PEAS!!!!Great stuff here....I'm definately taking notes!
1156057,Mich_Fisherman,2009-12-25 09:57:00,292,"We've been doing trips to Canada for nearly 10 years with the same group. The group has been as large at 12 and as small as 4. We have refined the trip list and ""do's and don't do's"" year after year. We start our ""meetings"" as early as April, once a month over breakfast talking about the menu, who is bringing what and lying about fish stories. We don't have a kitty per se, but we all take turns buying groceries, gas, bridge tolls, crawlers, hotel and the dinner the night before. Usually 2 nights prior to the trip we show up at Costco and do half of our shopping there.... (can't forget the tenderloin). Then we follow up with a stop at Meijer picking up the rest of the groceries. We usually buy crawlers in Wawa or the Soo and that gets split evenly. Some thing we don't spilt the cost on is beer, liquor, pop, mixers and all other meals on the road (with an exception to the night prior to flying in). We balance ""who buys"" with who might be low on the running tab. At the end of the trip, one person rarely owes more than $25. We bring lunch meat, Costco ham trimmed and vacuumed sealed and hotdogs should we not be able to get onto the lake because of weather or wind. Our biggest challenge was last year as we switched from a drive in to a fly in. Keeping the weight at 100 lbs per person (including food) was a challenge. We've learned some from last year (TOO MUCH GEAR!!) and hopefully this year will be less of a challenge. We share the driving both ways. The rule in camp is, if you don't cook, you clean up. Luckily our group hasn't had too much of a problem. Another rule is, if you invite someone to the trip, you are responisble for their actions. If there is a problem, you talk to them and get it resolved. If they are not holding their weight, you are responsible for letting them know. The group decides whether he will be asked back the following year...have not had that problem. With all of the preparing, planning, grocery shopping and the retail therapy buying gear and tackle is just as fun as the trip."
1307845,GOBIG,2011-05-17 05:13:00,126,"This is a great post, i am sure this will help get people to agree on more things.."
1307861,Guest,2011-05-17 06:09:00,0,"I did not read all the posts, don't have time, but i will put in my 2 cents. I have been leading a church group of guys into Canada for several years. We have between 13 and 16 men and boys. This year I am taking a second group because there was another church group who wanted to go and we couldn't fit them all into one. We camp on an island and rough it, cooking on campstoves and sleeping in tents. I say I lead it and I do because I feel it is important to have a leader. As soon as the deposits are paid I put together a list and have a random draw for teams of cookers and clean-up. Team one for example may do the cocoking for day 2 breakfast and clean-up for day three dinner. We do eat quite a bit of fish and one night is steak night where we have ribeyes we cook over the fire. This goes very smoothly and I allow them to decide about getting everyone in a boat and how many vehicles, We just have a couple meetings after church the weeks before the trip to make sure everyone has a seat in a boat, a tent to sleep in and a ride up and back. We encourage the guys who do not drive or have a boat to pay for for some of the gas of those they are with and we have neve had a problem. We have 3-4 teenage boys who go along like this and we charge them a flat $100, which pays for their food and some gas for whoever they ride with. THis is a really fun trip and it is quite a tradition. I would encourage you to do it. But I think it is important to have a leader for a trip like this some someone makes the final decisions on things. It has worked out well for us."
1307893,NemegosendaRiver,2011-05-17 07:18:00,66,"I have learned quite a few things on my 25+ trips. No one thing you trim down on is going to save anyone a ton of money. Don't quibble over 2 lbs of salami vs 1.5 lbs. 3 flats of worms vs 2. etc. There needs to be some expectations set up front. If the cabin needs swept, sweep it. Don't wait around on someone else to do the dishes, just start doing them. You had better know how to clean a fish before you go. People who don't pull their weight on our trip are seldom invited back.Everything is split evenly, regardless of whether you used any of the peanut butter or not. Don't try to split the cost of gas at each stop. Just have everyone put in 100 bucks at the beginning of the trip and have one guy go in and pay when you are done pumping. Something to consider when going with 4 guys...once you add one more person, you probably add another vehicle. Now 5 people are paying for two vehicles instead of 4 people paying for 1.You will be astounded at the amount of stuff you bring on your first trip that you don't touch; clothes, tackle, food, etc. Number 1 Rule - You are not getting a ride to go fishing in Canada. You are part of a trip that is only successful if everyone does their part. Be a part of the group and it will be a trip you will want to make every year for the rest of your life."
1307909,wallydave,2011-05-17 07:55:00,2151,"Wow an A-Team flashback! It is an intersting study, to see how group dynamics play out in the context of a fishing trip! When we had larger groups, 2-3 cabins with 3-4 boats, some people just went along for the ride, they added some fish to the meals, but not much else. Now that we have a smaller group, 2 cabins and 2 boats, the roles have become more defined. When one guy breaks out his electic fillet knife, the rest get the beans and potatoes cooking, when breakfast is being made, the rest of the crew, can check the weather, and wipe down the seats on the boats. As long as everyone pitches in, and tries to get along and have some fun, that is just as important, as the great fishing!"
1308007,Danbear,2011-05-17 11:16:00,72,"My buddy and I have been friends since 2nd grade so after 45 years we pretty much get along. We have our trip all planned on excel spread sheets with seperate packing lists for the truck, boat, clothes, food etc.We try to get other old friends to go every year last year 2 went along, one flew in from Virginia to go. We don't have a kitty just take turns paying for gas and we alternate paying for our hotel every year. We do have mutiple planning meeting through out the year or so we tell the wives. We pack the boat and truck with as much as possible on Thursday and then hit the road bright and early on Friday so we can have a nice relaxed drive to I-Falls sometimes we even stop at Leinie's in Chippewa Falls for a new fishing hat or drinking glass for the week. We then have a nice meal and adult refreshments at the hotel on Friday night sleep till we wake up,breakfast, gas and cross the border, in Dryden by noon to shop for our perishables off to Birchdale Lodge on Eagle lake, unpack and start fishing by 5:00 pm. 115 days to go !"
1308652,IA Nate,2011-05-18 14:46:00,12,"Before planning anything I would first settle on a number of guys that you actually WANT to be with for a week. If you just start grabbing people for the purpose of filling a group, chances are pretty good you'll end up with that ""one guy"" nobody can stand. Then what do you do? Your stuck with him. Go for quality fishing partners before quantity of fishing partners. Once you decide who you want to spend a full week with, you'll have a better idea of where and when to go."

I guess then you could just take one vehicle with 4 guys and all gear.The only draw backs to fly ins are rental boats, bringing depth sounders if you choose and probably not bringing an anchor or trolling motor.I missed the electric trolling motor the most, the little motors troll down pretty well on the rentals though.Have fun!"

Each driver gets one so gassing up is easy and there is an automatic record of everything plus you automatically get the correct exchange rate. They have worked great for us for several years now.
1308705,WalleyeCrazy2,2011-05-18 17:28:00,29,"We have a pretty large group this year we are going to have 20 guys, 6 boats and 3 or 4 motorhomes. We have basically had the same group going for 14 years now. There have been a few additions and a few that have come once and never again. We all have pretty thick skin and seem to enjoy our week together more and more each year. We all pitch in with whatever needs to be done. Most of the time the same guys cook, the same guys wash dishes and the same guys clean fish. After all of these years we know who does what best without even discussing it. Some are beer drinkers, some are not. We all get along wether we are drunk or sober. We help with repairs on rods, boat motors or campers that need it. We chop wood, build fires and basically just get-r-don. I work all year for this week with these guys. Have patience, try to keep the conversation light, have a couple laughs. You will shake out the ones that dont fit. Just pitch in and have respect for others and it will be a trip of a lifetime. Dont be afraid to tell the others that you dont know how to do something, they will show you. We split everything except alcohol. All guys pay the same. If you want to share your beer, you share it. But you pay for your own supply. Most of us have sons going along now, so I have my twins, myself, my brother, my dad and father-in-law in the group. We even have a website for the trip... http://www.walleyecrazy.com"
1308764,Larry Mac,2011-05-18 19:25:00,530,"Hi WalleyeCrazy2, All I can say is Amazing. I am truly impressed with your group. I visited your website and I am amazed. It appears you have several generations in attendance and looking through your photo albums everyone is having a great time. I am sure you can offer great advice to anyone planning a larger group trip. I am impressed. What a great job. If I was looking at joining a group for that type of adventure I would certainly be contacting you. P.S. you guys catch some nice fish also LOL. Have a great year as I know you will.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1308803,keek,2011-05-18 20:40:00,1003,I gotta echo Larry Mac - Walleyecrazy2 you and your crew are pulling off a class act. Well done and enjoy the next one.
1153317,Guest,2009-12-10 07:42:00,0,"I am the leader of our group...here's what we've come up with over time.... We currently try to have a group of 6. Will fit in the cabin we have, without needing to go to a second cabin. All guys have beds. I send out a request for deposits on Dec. 15 each year. I'm looking for deposit $$ to confirm my group size, so I can get the cabin set in January. I take the prior years cabin rental amount per guy, and divide that by three. Deposits are due Jan 1, Feb. 1 and Mar 1. So by March 1 each guy has basically already paid his cabin share. I don't worry so much about a food deposit, because if someone doesn't go, we can adjust that when we shop. All deposits are NON-refundable. The only caveat is that if someone doesn't end up going, it is up to those that still go to decide on the trip if a refund is in order, depending on why that person didn't go. We have had a couple we did not refund, and some we did. We are all technologically literate, so we have many running email loops about food, and settle on 1 big meal per day, which we now have mid-afternoon to take a break. Works out great. We have something ""lesser"" once we are done fishing. I do all the shopping based upon that. Everyone is expected to help out, which with our group is currently a no-brainer. We have 2 guys that love to grill, they cover that. 1 guy loves to have big breakfasts, he covers that. I usually do prep stuff, like slice onions, etc. The other 2 guys jump in as needed. As an example, we went for 4 days last May. Mid day meals were big burgers with loads of toppings and fries (day we got there); spaghetti/meatballs; steak and roast pork in a crockpot. Dinners were grilled cheese, tacos, hotdogs and crockpot sausage. Plus the usual assortments of chips, nuts, cookies etc..... John"
1153320,jokerjim,2009-12-10 08:04:00,473,"I think if the same guy supplies the boat and tow vehicle all the time then he should get a break on the gas bills for the boat and the tow vehicle. Of course if he choses to be included in the gas cost, that is his call."
1155821,nitroman,2009-12-23 16:46:00,368,Over the years I have kept every note taken and list made from food to gear and it has made it easy now if we have newbies. You can give them a good list of exactly what to bring and expect. Our grocery's are handled by myself and another and is now spot on. Every individual brings misc snacks to themselves and to share. The kitty is golden assures you that there will be gas money to get home and the balance is divided among drivers at the end regardless of the overage. Each person is responsible for at least one meal and a breakfast depending on group size. All left overs are divided at the end unless it can be used next year. Participation in daily fishing contests are manditory @ $1 a day it doesnt cost much but is great for smack talk through the years! And practical jokes are to be expected!
1155988,2746,2009-12-24 15:25:00,3206,Have been going with the same group of 6 for 10+ years now and do 2 trips per year. In our group if you provide a tow vehicle you don't buy any gas (split among the other four) and for the two of us that provide a boat the other four kick in $100 each. That means as a provider of a truck and boat I don't buy truck gas and pick up $200 for providing a boat. The group had that agreement in place before I joined them but is a reasonable way of trying to reimburse the guys with the equipment.
1151395,Glenman12,2009-12-02 07:11:00,762,"We've been going to Canada now for over 25 years..our group started out as 4 and there has been as many as 16..the only constants have been myself and my fishing partner..as our kids got older they started going..as they grew more and matured we started letting them have imput into things..now that they are in their early 30's we pretty much have passed the baton to them and they run things now..they have made a few changes, mostly in travel and they have worked out great. Our core group now stands at 6 and we have a lock on the 12 man cabin at our lodge..due to our length of time going to this lodge, the owner doesnt make us give a deposit which is nice...we have never had a problem with guys backing out (knock on wood)..as things stand now we have 9 confirmed and are looking for 1 more to even it out.. Luckily we have had only two problem children over the years..one guy, a newbie, didnt bring enough money to pay the lodge..he wasnt asked back..the other was a guy who had been going for about 5 years..that last year he brought his son and there was a mayfly hatch..the fishing was very slow..he decided to leave a day early and wanted the lodge owner at the time to prorate his fee, which he woulndt do..he reluctantly wrote him a check that ended up bouncing...wrote him another check and that one bounced too. finally made good on the 3rd one..he was then kicked out..that was difficult because he later became the father in law of my fishing partners son.."
1151408,LIKEWALLEYE,2009-12-02 08:27:00,70,"Our group has 3 envolpes ( kittys) 1 for gas , most of the times its a $100.00 per person. A. The leftovers get divided to vehicle owners and boat owners. Wear and tear, oil changes. And cleaning expenses. 1 cabin expenses. We know excactly how much each person has to paywith canadian taxes included. 1 food bill, we plan on 2 breakfast, 2 supper. Usally turns out about $25.00 per person. Each person brings there own favorite snacks, pop, booze or beer. Works out perfectly. Been doing it for many years. We do alot of maintance on our boats and vehicles before we leave. None of us wants to be stuck in the middle of 502 with problems. Knock on wood no problems yet!!!!"
1151058,keek,2009-11-30 15:47:00,1003,"Great thread! I'd love to hear more. It's my first time organizing a fishing trip but I've organized and led over 150 other back-country trips/expeditions and I'm trying to transfer that experience. We'll see how it goes.One thing I'm trying is to have each guy bring or be responsible for one or two dinners depending on our final numbers. This includes prep/clean-up/etc. Grabbing thier boat partner if they need help with the little stuff. Easy meals like meatball subs, pre-cooked and frozen ziti, spagetti, pre-cooked and frozen chili, etc.I'm planning on quick and simple breakfast and lunches outside of the shore lunches we cook. We'll split the costs of these meals.I've interested 4 guys (all good friends of mine) who all own boats and then offered them the ability to find a partner. That way only 2 to a boat and everybody has at least one good buddy in the group.If the actual trip is even half the fun of the anticipation it's going to be an amazing experience!"
1151065,Larry Mac,2009-11-30 16:00:00,530,"Hi Mr. Sauger, I have been organizing trips to Canada for many years now, usually 2 to 3 a year. We have 10 people going up in June and 8 in August. We have experienced fly in, drive to and boat and portage in. There is usually a new person or two including children, with a core group of four. I am amazed how accurate your list is. You have spoken out of true experience. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1151073,Mr Ranger,2009-11-30 16:28:00,272,"Keek, our personal experience has been it is much easier for one camp leader to organize all meals. We have a consensus (only four of us) of what meals everyone wants and then the leader gets all the food and makes up the lists. We usually do three to four non fish meals to break it up and try to pre cook and freeze those items. The problem with having each plan a couple of meals is you will find that you have twice as many of some items and have totally forgotten others. Although we have a pre planned menu we will move meals around depending on weather and the fishing. Persoally I love the planning as much as the trip itself. Good luck"
1151079,keek,2009-11-30 16:53:00,1003,Good thought Mr. Ranger.
1151155,johnboat,2009-11-30 21:50:00,2014,"I organize an 11 man trip, 7 years in. Two Words...................Community Kitty!!! It pays for the gas, the deposit, the groceries, motel if needed, toll bridge fee, crawlers, etc.... That way everybody is in the same dollar wise. When you get to camp start a tab. All ice, minnows, boat gas, lodge bill get added up and divide by 11. That is the amount due from each person. Not sure you will make it home with the gas kitty money left? Everybody throws in what ever you think you will need. You will have a good idea on the amount by keeping track of your gas $$ on the way up. Some left over? Draw straws for the remainder or split it up. Somebody whinning about so and so using more minnows than he did........you've obviously invited the wrong person to go with you. Stick to the grocery list. Our first year everyone brought steaks, brats, pork chops, loins, etc on their own as a special treat and we had enough food left over to where the camp owner didn't have to buy groceries for a month! It's a little overwhelming at first but by year two you'll be a pro. Keep'er on the bottom! John B.O.A.T."
1151180,Bill Krejca,2009-12-01 06:00:00,6107,"Gotta agree with Mr. Ranger - he knows his food! It is predictable that an enormous amount of food will be left over if everyone brings. Much better if one person plans the menu and folks stick to it. My only deviation to this is that everyone bring their own ""boat snacks"", if desired, as some prefer to snack more than others. Bill Krejca"
1151187,Gary from Iowa,2009-12-01 06:44:00,74,"When I first started going to Canada (other than a as a kid) the payers would contribute equal amounts to the kitty and replenish it as necessary. Now when we buy gas, food, bait, etc., we write our first name on the back of the credit card or debit card slip. We also bring cash to pay the lodge. We have records of cash contributed and the credit slips. We total each individual's contribution, total all the contributions and find the amount that each should contribute and make adjustments from there. The calculations can be made on a sheet of paper or on a computer spreadsheet. (Last year we even had columns for US and Canadian currency and an adjustment for the exchange rate. We just picked an arbitrary adjustment for the exchange rate since it fluctuates daily. I fish with my brothers, so we like to get reasonably close to what we each owe but don't obsess with getting the contribution to the last penny. Remember its a vacation, not a bank loan!Gary"
