563714,Nickolai,2007-03-04 10:53:00,12,Headed to Esnagami Lake in mid-late May. (Esnagami.com) Anyone have past stories or tips I would love them all! I have heard the Walleye is excellent there and am really excited.
563715,Guest,2007-03-04 14:11:00,0,"I was there 15 years ago at that same time of year. My brother has been there several times (once with me). The owners have a loyal customer base. It is a great place to fish. The camp folks took good care of us. Food was great. Service was also. I haven't been back -- only because I bought a boat and now go only to drive-in fishing camps. I assume Esnagami is still a fly-in from Nakina. I have thought about going back, however, just to fish it again. We hit some very unusual weather -- it was 85 degrees most of our trip which SHOULD have been just after ice-out!! The spring spots that SHOULD have been producing at that time of year were not. I would take along a locator and a hand-held GPS (I always take a compass). The map of the area was marginal and there were no contour maps (at least not at that time). For the locator I would buy a portable or if you already have a locator, take along a 12-volt lawn tractor battery (these are small, light, deep cycle, and meant for lots of recharging), a clamp bracket for putting the locator puck on the transom, a tool box rigged to hold all this for travel and carrying from the cabin to the boat, and a 12 volt charger for the battery. This would have helped us immensely. There are deep holes -- take along bottom bouncers, jigs, weights, or cranksbaits that are capable of fishing 30 feet deep. But if the weather holds, the typical more shallow ""spring spots"" will work well."

Shows depths, islands, structure, tons of stuff. Cost was $12.99. I also find a handheld GPS to be the cornerstone of any trip to an unknown. So between that, my map, and hopefully decent weather, I will be good. Thanks for responding. All others please continue to respond about ESNAGAMI LAKE. I am ALWAYS looking for the inside edge against my fishing partners."
563774,Fishoil,2007-03-08 19:26:00,1277,I'm interested in the map you bought. When I go to fishingmaps.com it redirects me to the Fishing Hot Spot Maps site and I don't see your map listed. Am I looking in the wrong place? I'd like to see what other Canadian maps they carry.
