Some I put Red dot eyes on with finger nail polish, others I stick on holograpic eyes I buy at any tackle place. Heres some information. Back in a spawning bay I fish some years,white jig and white Twister tail and minnow is best by far there. Some fisherman,one in my boat, only like plain lead, they feel it distracts from their bait. My friend and his partner took my jigs on one of their many trips to Canada. Found fish on that trip perfered plain, spent week scraping off the paint. 20 yr later he's in my boat and still only uses my plain ones and does well.I only use color. Like being Republican or Democract. We call the Jig, Indian Joes, after an old Indian that used them on Lake Of Woods 30 years ago."

If I had used those exclusively on the Ogoki last year, I would have spent over $65 in jigs alone! hawkeye-ever try putting a coat of clear glitter on those plain lead heads? I've had pretty good luck using that color. I get a lot of ""experienced"" guys in my shop who are just looking for plain leadheads."

The key was a fast jigging retrieve. Slow down, forget it. Fast twitch... a constant bite. Greg Bolinski Agate Bay Lodgewww.agatebaylodge.com NPAA #944"
