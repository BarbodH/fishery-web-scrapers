563901,Guest,2007-03-14 18:45:00,0,Yea they said it was a 3 hour drive on the dirt road.they also have a place to be picked up by plane if u want to pay the extra fee.should be interesting for sure. thanks for the info

They did real well for walleye and pike last year. I know we're driving to a particulat pick-up point and then flying to an outpost lake. I think it's Lac Simard. the price seems fairly reasonable and I think this will be their third or fouth trip there. Hope this helps. Lou"

If you drive, then be sure to take a four wheel drive and if you trailer a boat then you must take the time to really service your trailer, check bearings and think about spare tires, etc. When the govt grades the road, it's 35-40 miles per hour even with a trailer. The road can be handled with preparation and just takes time; the end result is really worth the effort. Good luck"
563999,beagle22b07,2007-03-19 11:06:00,34,"Daryl Retire 55 and andy are right. Don't underestimate the Clova Road. It can be absolutely brutal if the conditions are right. I've been to Caesars a couple of times, but have always flown in from St. Veronique. Do a search of this site and you'll find several posts relating to Caesars. Good Luck Larry"
