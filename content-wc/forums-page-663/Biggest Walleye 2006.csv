561637,Guest,2006-10-17 01:13:00,0,"i just got back from a 6 day trip to red river, for me the trip wasnt my best but had a great time. my biggest this year was only 29 1/2"" on a jig with salty. also caught two 28"" fish on cranks. buddy only caught 1 green back, it happened to be on the last day but it was 32 1/2"" and 14 1/2# on a crank. another in our party caught his biggest ever at 30 1/2"" on a crank along with a couple others in the 28"" range. and the last guy in our party caught 4 in the 28"" - 30"" range. all in all it was a pretty good trip for us, even though the tipical jiggin on the red didnt really work for us this year. the cranks we had the best luck with were clown, and anything mostly white in shad rap #9, and a red/white big wally diver. lost alot of cranks most of which they have discontinued the color, but thats fishin."

Don introduced me to the bay Of Quinte, Wow what a great fishery, so far this year i have picked up a 11.5 pound 31.5 inch giant. this big girl was caught about 20 feet down over deep water, using leadcore line,pulling a firetiger replala.My largest Walleye to date was a 14.5 pound monster (picture in the ten pound club) also caught in the Bay Of Quinte. So Much Water , So Little time"
561663,Guest,2006-10-19 14:14:00,0,"Mike, Don't be so bashful. We all know that you currently hold the state record in 3 staes for big Walleye and we also have read the many articles written about you in ""Walleye Monster"" Magazine. It is well known that you are the Michael Jordan of Walleye fishing. Keep up the good work and dont you ever stop helping the non Walleye catching population of Vol Land."

560386,Guest,2006-08-16 11:50:00,0,"Fishing an outpost out of Anderson's Lodge on Lac Suel. 28 1/2"" - only weighed a little over 6lb. Caught her the second week of the season so probably explains the light weight. Jig and minnow. The toughest thing: Anderson's have a master angler program with walleye 27 1/2"" or bigger being a master. I was by myself and no one around to witness the catch and I wasn't about to drag her back to the cabin. Oh well!"
