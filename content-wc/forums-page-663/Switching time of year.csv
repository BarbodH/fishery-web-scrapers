Also, just to make things interesting, we'll be trying a new (for us) lake. Normally, we fish sometime between late June to mid August, when fish are pretty-well established for the summer. This year we'll be fishing from June 6-13. The lake is relatively small (~3 mi. x 1 mi) and shallow (30 ft max). We'll be just a little north of Thunder Bay latitude-wise, and a good ways west. For someone used to starting off using spinner rigs and cranks (trolled) to find fish, what might be the best fish locating strategy given a typical spring on a similar unfamiliar water body?"

If there are any incoming rivers, check those. If it is windy, fish the shoreline the wind is blowing into. I think your spinner rig or cranks will work fine. I usually use jigs and rigs, but if I could pick a time to go, you got it. Good luck!"

This is kind of a transitional time of year, if the spring is real early the fish may already be starting to disperse to the typical summer spots. But typically they're more concentrated, and shallower. When you find fish, you'll usually find a lot of them."

Key on feeder creeks, rivers, etc. You should find fish easily on a small lake like that one. Look for midlake rock humps, reefs, structure on your electronis and drop jigs down on them. Minnows, leeches and crawlers will work. Spinners and cranks will catch fish but you will prolly catch many more on the jig."

I recommend jigging with a minnow or nightcrawler. It has been my experience (especially as early as we go) that when they are biting they will hammer crawlers or minnows, however if you get into a slow period they do seem to take minnows better. If the bottom allows my favorite approach is to throw out a 2 or 3 hook lindy rig and slowly retrieve it along the bottom. I have had times when I catch twice as many walleyes on the lindy rig as others in the boat using jigs. We fish almost entirely with crawlers because they are cheap, so I take 500 with me packed for Canada. Good luck -- I am getting the itch. NE Piker"
