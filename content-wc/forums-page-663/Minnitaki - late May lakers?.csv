Do I need to hook it up for that time of year, or will I find those things shallow enough for standard trolling/jigging?"
564014,Guest,2007-03-19 20:54:00,0,"Exactly when in late May you coming?? Depends on the spring weather too and ice out. If you dont want to bother with the down riggers, can jig for them after they go down in depth too."
564023,Mohleye,2007-03-20 09:55:00,368,"You may as well bring the downrigger. Even if the lakers are shallow, there are times you can't beat being able to control your depth precisely. You could start without it, and if you're marking lots of fish at a particular depth, start using the downrigger."
564029,prov1900,2007-03-20 16:46:00,544,"May 26th thru June 2. I used to fish for them out of a canoe, up in the Quetico during my college summers. With no depth finder and no bait, we still caught them. Didn't learn anything from it because I could never tell at what depth they were at. Just curious as to where, in a typical year, they might be during May/June. Thanks for the help in advance."
564033,Lips,2007-03-20 19:18:00,8,Can anyone who has actually caught some lakers on Minnitaki give some advise on how and where to catch them. I have heard Lyons Bay and around some of the islands in the main lake is a good place but I really haven't tried much - just haven't been willing to put in the time. Maybe if I had a better method of targeting them it would make it worth the effort. Thanks
564040,Mohleye,2007-03-21 15:20:00,368,"My first two trips to Canada were to Minitaki, over 20 years ago, in the last week of May time period. I joined a group who'd been going there for years. They did ""shore lunch"" lake trout fishing. By that I mean we would have a shore lunch on an island in Lyons Bay, and trout fish from shore while we ate and relaxed. We did this using frozen ciscoe on a rig we devised, with a one ounce egg sinker. We then set the rods down with the bails open, line wrapped around an empty can or bottle, and went about our lunch or had a card game, and when a can or bottle tipped over, all h_ll would break loose. We always caught lakers this way, including a 22lb'er my buddy put on his wall. We left Minnitaki to find better walleye fishing and smaller crowds, but returned once for a couples trip around 10 years ago. This was in late July, and the lakers were deep, but we still caught 2 in one afternoon's fishing. These we trolled for with downriggers, and caught them on shad raps, again in Lyons Bay. If I went back to Minnitaki I would definitely fish for them. The consistency of catching was as good in Lyons Bay as anywhere else I've been in Canada. I am far from the world's most experienced laker fisherman, but when it comes to methods we've had success trolling shad raps, flutter spoons, five-of-diamonds, and many other spoons, as well as ciscoe using a strip-on; also jigging and shore lunch fishing. Something might really produce one day, and you can't even get a strike with it the next. The trick seems to be fishing good water (like Lyons Bay), figuring out the depth, and keep trying different lures and methods until you find what they like that day. It can be a nice change of pace, and if they're not biting, you can always go back to the walleyes."
564060,Guest,2007-03-22 12:59:00,0,"I haven't fished that lake myself, but I have fished many lake in the area for lakers so I don't have tips for area. But for things to try . In late may the trout should still be shallow. We generally troll for lakers unless we see an area really holding fish. Then we switch to jigs for a bit. Trout this time of year have no trouble coming up from the deeper water to hit, so we run our lines usally shallow. For lures everybody has their fav, and they all work I'm sure very well, but our family all time fav is a large Gibbs teaspoon and a live minnow. For us day in and out has put more fish in the boat then anything else for us. What I find to be most key is boat control, I don't like going in straight lines very far. I don't know if it's the lure getting away from behind the boat as much as the lure speed and depth changes. Because I like cutting in very close to deep shores and point I don't use boards or dippsy divers My 11 year old daughter who fishes 1/2 the time, does everything wrong yet puts more then her share of trout in the boat. As somebody else said cast out during shore lunch. That is one of the most productive way to fish for lakers."
