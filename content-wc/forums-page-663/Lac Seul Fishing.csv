564007,Guest,2007-03-19 18:47:00,0,"300 walleyes in 4 hours. wow. i'm not sure that's physically possible. 200 per day is common. wow. i never had a 200 walleye/boat day on lac seul. maybe i need to check this lake out. i wonder if mrs forrest lodge would be willing to provide the names and phone numbers of the folks that do this kind of fishing. sounds like the kind of bs you hear at sports shows. then when you get there, it's the old shoulda been here last week."
564012,Guest,2007-03-19 20:27:00,0,I had to chuckle after reading that statement too. Too funny.
564015,JDP,2007-03-19 21:43:00,1457,"According to Forrest Lodge ""300 walleyes in 4 hours"". That equates to: for 2 people, a walleye caught,unhooked and released every 96 seconds for 4 people,a walleye caught,unhooked and released every 192 seconds If this does happen, it would most likely be the rare exception rather than the rule. A similar promtional claim would be... Come to ""Fill in the Blank"" Lodge and see Haley's Comet. That happens to come by earth every 76 years or so. I will abstain from any further remarks. I think we, now I, have beaten a dead horse. I apologize for that!"

563369,Hump,2007-02-13 14:05:00,578,"I have stayed at Evergreen, near Ear Falls , the past two years. We have been very happy with our fishing. Depends on the day, some days, tons of 15-17 inch walleyes and other days 18-24. Some days tons of both."
563373,180FH,2007-02-13 16:44:00,444,I'm glad that none of you guys fish for Muskies....that's good. Leave 'em all for me.
563375,Guest,2007-02-13 18:09:00,0,"I have been fishing the Northeast part of Lac Suel for 10 years now and all the posts above are dead on. I use to fish in the morning for walleye and the afternoon for pike, but over the past several years I have come to the realization that I do much better pike fishing when I fish for walleye. Like someone mentioned before the large pike hang out near deep water structure (at least in July). Last year all but a couple days I had at least one pike nail a walleye I was reeling in. No matter the conditions on that lake if you are not boating at least 20 walleye a day you are doing something wrong. As for typical walleye size, it seems to change day to day, but I have found the following to be fairly realistic: 15"" and less - 20% 16"" to 21"" - 60% 22"" to 27"" - 20% 28""+ - not an everyday event, but not uncommon. As for pike you can catch all the hammer-handles you want throwing a johnson's spoon in the shallow weed bays, but the big ones are on deep structure. If you want a shot at a muskie the Northeast section of the lake is probably one of the best areas in North America."

563380,orchard frank,2007-02-13 21:48:00,1900,"Spent a lot of time up there, one thing I would suggest is to just keep a big rod rigged with a large lure, big spinnerbait for instance, maybe firetiger, and while you are fishing walleyes or whatever, every once in a while fling it out a few times, over the reef, off the deep edge, burn it shallow, let it sink deep. You will be amazed at what you bring in. I'm convinced that fishing activity attracts the big predators, and if a pike or musky grabs one of your walleyes, you'll be ready to throw something at him. The biggest smallie I ever caught up there (6# class) was on a red-head Super Shad Rap I was throwing at a sunning musky, that never did bite. Good Luck"
563385,dave10,2007-02-14 11:50:00,342,"Scott, I would say most were under 18 inches - we probably averaged 16 or 17 inches overall, if you added them all up. As to where to stay, others know much better than I. We stayed at Evergreen in Ear Falls and liked it a lot, but never took the trek too far south of Fisherman's Island (that's the Steamboat narrows area, I think?). People who went farther south (to MacKenzie, maybe?) reported bigger fish. However, we were having fun and lots of action where we were, so we followed the old guide's adage: ""Never leave fish to find fish."" I have a friend who makes a day trip each year up from Eagle and fishes the Perrault Falls area. He has caught much bigger fish - slot after slot, he says. I think you can't go wrong, wherever you go. Good luck. Dave"
563392,Guest,2007-02-15 07:51:00,0,"Been to lac Seul several times. Seems to me that the South central part of the lake yields better size Walleye on a more consistant basis. Have been on the NW,NE sections and while fishing is good all over the South Central has less fisherman and better size."
563431,Guest,2007-02-16 14:31:00,0,"Hey Scott Welcome to Lac Seul. 100+ walleyes a day are completely feasible for two or three people. 40""+ pike are also feasible there with a little luck. You may even be lucky enough to latch onto a 50"" muskie. It is also not unheard of to land 50 or more bass for two people on an early June day up to 20"". If you can find the right offshoot from Lac Seul, you may even be lucky enough to land a 9lb. lake trout or two. I have experienced all of the previous myself. However, not all in one day, or even in one week. Muskie season doesn't open until the third Saturday in June and by then you've usually missed the big number bass days. But you can always go to Big or Little Vermillion Lakes and get your fill of bass there. The lake trout spots are tough to find, but if you get bored of striking out on Lac Seul, you can always go for Lake Trout on Big Vermillion in the morning, then go for Musky, Pike or Bass in the afternoon. Or, you can spend a day or two on Minnitaki lake and get yourself a 30 lb. lake trout, a boat full of walleye, your fair share of big pike and a healthy dose of smallmouth. This advice is for the Southeast section of Lac Seul coming from the Sioux Lookout area. Big and Little Vermillion and Minnitaki lakes are all located within minutes of Lac Seul. If you want to experience great success now in these endeavours, get yourself a guide or group up with someone that has been fishing the area for a while. Or, get your feet wet and learn the waters yourself. Either way, I wish you luck in your fishing. Just be safe. Good to see interest in Lac Seul. dragon"

563953,Guest,2007-03-16 18:18:00,0,"Mr Forrest, You may want to try some positive advertising. Putting down one of the best walleye lakes in NW Ontario probably isn't going to sell too many packages.."
563341,Guest,2007-02-12 17:16:00,0,"Just curious on a couple of things. I see post all the time on here on how great this lake is and I don't disagree. I have a couple of questions for all of the Lac Seul fisherman. I haven't been there and just wonder a couple of things for future consideration. 1) Do you mainly fish for walleye all day or do you target other fish? I never see post about notherns, lake trout, or smallies. 2) How common is the 100 fish per boat day? How many people are in the boat? 3)What are the sizes of fish you catch? What percent is under 18, 18-25, and 25+ I like to target walleye early, then go for lake trout and northern during the day. Would Lac Seul satisfy my needs. Scott"
563342,JDP,2007-02-12 17:48:00,1457,"Personally I fish Lac Seul as follows: 85% Walleye 15% Smallmouth 0% Northern Pike (I'm not a Pike Guy) There is not a fishable Lake Trout population in Lac Seul. Sure there was a nice fish caught a couple years ago. But, that is the only Laker I have seen caught in almost 20 years. I have had 100 fish (walleye) days for 2 people. Size can really vary depending upon the time of year, where you are fishing, etc. However, there are days where it is difficult to catch Walleyes under 18"". I have caught Walleyes to 29 1/2"", Smallmouth to 19"", Northerns (while Walleye fishing) to 42"". Hope this helps! :cheers:"
563344,prov1900,2007-02-12 17:51:00,544,"One, and correct me if I am wrong, but you will spend your entire week if you are going to try to catch lakers. They are there, but very very rare. (IMO) 100 walleye days are not uncommon, but shouldn't be your goal. I mean, do you have any lakes in Illinois where you can consistently catch 20 per day, or even 10? I don't in Nebraska. We caught anywhere from 30-40 a day, apiece, with three in the boat. Some people do better, some worse. If you really want or need that many, which is totally cool, plan on doing some traveling, away from the crowds. For me, the smallies and northerns came as bonus fish during the walleye fishing. I think Lac Seul is becoming a better smallie lake, but if you specifically try to target them, you will catch lots of walleyes and pike, depending on the season. We had guys that specifically targeted pike and did quite well. They still caught kicker walleyes. The highest percentage of fish are in the slot, naturally. Again depending on the time of year, you will fill your limit with the ones you need/want everyday. It is easy to catch fish here, depending on your skill. I took a guy who had never caught a walleye in his life, showed him the ropes, and he ended up catching 30 to 40 a day as well. If your walleye skills need to be honed, hire a guide. The tough part is navigation and paying for the gas. Enjoy this resource. Leave some (lots) for the next time as well."
563349,Guest,2007-02-12 19:35:00,0,"We've been going up to Lac Seul for about 6 years now.We fish half the day for walleye the other half for northern. I to, like the pike action, we fish the south central part of the lake, it is difficult to find a lot of weeds. We only have a few small areas, that don't hold a lot of pike.Average days with 2 guys in the boat we catch 30 walleye,and probally 10 pike or so.Our best days, 100 walleye and we have had 50 pike in the afternoon. The biggest northern come off the drops and rocks. To date, the largest being 29in walleye and a 42 in northern.Most fish are over the 18in mark, but never have trouble getting the smaller ones to eat. If your looking for the 17 i/2 in walleye good luck, we'll catch about 4-5 in a week.We've had some days I swear the average size is 24-25 in, those slobs stick together.We always go in September."
563350,Guest,2007-02-12 19:36:00,0,"I fished Lac Seul in the Ear Falls area 2 years ago. There was a group composed of six fishermen in camp. They fished all week and caught almost 1800 walleyes. They carry golf stroke clickers on their belt to count fish. I think we had a 100 fish day too. I can't be certain, maybe we quit counting at 75 fish and they kept hitting. The size of the fish depends on where you are on the lake."
563356,Guest,2007-02-13 06:58:00,0,"Have fished LS for about 7 years now, all at the same resort in the central part of the lake. 1. While you will hear a story or two of Lake Trout, there really is no fishable population. 2. Walleyes are the stars of this lake, but there are other great fish populations. To some degree it depends on what part of the lake you are at. Muskies are found in the eastern end of the lake. Where we are there are no muskies. In the central part of the lake, the bass population has been growing for the past 7 years and now we take a half a day a couple of times a week to fish for them (there in June). The bass population has really come on and all the fish are niced sized 15"" with my biggest a bit over 19"". We have targeted pike in the past, and there are some very nice ones, but we don't target them. We do catch nice ones in fishing for walleye. 3. Walleyes are indeed the main fish on this lake and boy you do catch nice ones. Our groups biggest is a 30 1/4 inch fish and every year we catch one 28"" or better. You can easily catch 30 fish a day and if you hit the feed just right, way better. Cheers,,, IA Walleye"
563358,Guest,2007-02-13 09:01:00,0,"Been on Lac Seul for about 20 years and the Walleye fishing is as good today as it ever was. 100+++ fish a day,2 man boat,8 hours fishing are not uncommon. Have had more days better than 100 than days less than 100. Biggest Walleye 32"" lots of slot fish.We fish in early June and late August with numbers being better in June and chance for bigger fish better in August. Biggest Bonus is June Smallie fishing getting better every year for the last 7/8 years. 17"" to 19"" Smallie is normal. In June our group will catch 100 Smallie or so in a week and we only target them a limited amount of time. Pike are a big surprise on a jig/minnow and it seems we will get a couple of 40""++ every year without fishing for them. Never caught or seen a Lake Trout on Lac Seul."
563360,dave10,2007-02-13 10:00:00,342,"We fished the Ear Falls area last year in mid-July. It was strictly walleye action - we caught maybe ten pike the whole week among the three of us, and no smallies. We averaged at least 100 walleyes in the boat per day total, every day except the first, when we got about 80 as we were feeling our way around. On our best day, numbers-wise, we had 100 by lunch. We did not get into much in the way of size. Biggest for the week was 26, we each had a 25, and only about ten percent total were in the slot, in my estimation. It was a blast - good luck! Dave"
563363,Mike Kansas,2007-02-13 10:20:00,1463,"I agree with the Walleye numbers that have been posted . We fish the the Central part of the lake and the Smallie fishing is definitly getting better each year. We target rocky points and shallow drops in June for Smallies and have good luck with small cranks, rat L traps and small spinner baits along with flipping tubes. Best colors seem to be fire tiger, chrome, blue and red. Tubes colors are smoke, black and any darker color with a little metal flake on a 1/8 oz tube jig. Seems the most important ingredient for catching Smallies is good structure with wind on it. These same spots will of course yield Walleye and an occasional toothy critter. It's all great fun, fish slow and work each spot hard...especially after catching one. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
563368,Guest,2007-02-13 13:20:00,0,"Dave Just wondering if most of the walleye you caught were under 18"" and what was the average size. Also, what part of the lake would you suggest in staying. I would like Ear Falls because I would make it a 2 week trip. Because the first week would be on an outpost close to Ear Falls. Scott"
