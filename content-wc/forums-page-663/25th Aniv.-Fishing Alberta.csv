563434,Guest,2007-02-16 23:56:00,0,"Greetings Alberta Friends, We have our 25th wedding aniv. coming up in August. I travel 200+ days a year as a medical professional. I could go any place in the world with my milage plan but I would like to keep this event simple. I am looking for a ""Very Plush"" resort north of Edmonton to take my bride and 18 my foot Smokercraft Ultima to. Don't worry Canadian friends, I don't plan on eating your walleye. I am a catch and release fisherman. I love to fish but I enjoy Angus prime rib just as much. My wife is not a whimp in the wilderness but a 25th Aniv. does not come along every day. I have been stranded with no food on a caribou hunt in the Yukon (actualy had boiled meat for 5 days) , chased by a wounded Kodiak brown bear , endured a hurricane in the Virgin Islands, evacuated for a tidal wave in Hawaii, rode the wave of 10 or more earthquakes in Alaska along with 6+inches inches of volcanic ash in Alaska and several of blizzards in Montana. As you can see, I have ""been round"". I am looking for a nice place where money is not an object and comfort is king (aka hot tub on the deck overlooking the lake). Thanks for your input Northman Montana"

Thanks for the input. I really don't want to go to the spots I have been like Hawaii, Mexico, Australia, Alaska or the Caribbean. I would like a low stress and no airport line place to go. Northman Montana"

564042,zzlaw,2007-03-21 16:40:00,34,There are great fly-in lodges that are upscale in Alberta - places like Andrew Lake Lodge - Alberta is sort of an odd place for walleye - there are some absoluttely amazing fisheries like Pigeon Lake which is very close to Edmonton but most who fish it have their own boats - there just is limited development for visitors - Pigeon Lake has been a C&R lake and is chock full of huge walleye - Lesser Slave also has great walleye fishing with lots of places to stay but nothing luxurious - there is some guided fishing with accomodations for both places but they aren't upscale - of course you could stay at the Hotel Mcdonald in Edmonton along the river - it looks like a castle inside and out and then travel to fish - along the same lines you could go to the Banff Springs Hotel or the Hotel Lake Louise and arrange fishing around staying at these amazing hotels - or you might just choose to go to Aitken's Lake in Manitoba which has great accomodations and great walleye fishing - I have fished all over - feel free to send me a private message if you want to know more - Larry

The place you descibe is plummers and you'd be fishing lakers and BIG pike. However, that is fly in and like the pike, BIG bucks. There is a drive to place with great walleye fishing and okay cabin accomodations. They do offer a full service dining room, but nothing first class. There is a hot tub too. It is Winnefred lake halfway between Ft Mac and Edmonton. See what you think. Be prepared for a crappy road though..........it is an old oil lease road with basic upkeep for 75kms. If it rains, you might be staying an extra day or two."

It used to be our favorite place but 2 years ago Alberta decided to grant Metis the same fishing rights as Aboriginals.Since the Metis town of Conklin is nearby they have been in there 24-7-365 hauling out everything they can. Last year we were hard pressed to catch anyhthing decent and the lodge was considering closing. There is fantastic walleye fishing just north of the Montana border in all of the reservoirs. We fish Macgregor,Crawling Valley Sheberne, Travers and St. Mary's. The only drawback is there is nothing to see except bald-a$$ prairie The best place I can think of is the Columbia river at Castlegar in British Columbia. You can get Walleye up to 10 ib. all day long in a short stretch below the Keenlyside dam.(Average 4-5 lb.) There are also lots of Rainbows and Whitefish. For something different you can go up the lock on the dam into Arrow Lake and catch Bull Trout,Gerard Rainbow and jumbo Kocanee. There is great accomadation in Castlegar,Nelson Nakusp and others. There are lots of hot springs,spas,rafting,heli tours etc. as well. Alberta just doesn't have a lot of drive to places you're looking for."
