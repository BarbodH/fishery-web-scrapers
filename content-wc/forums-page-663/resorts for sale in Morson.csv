563797,Guest,2007-03-09 15:51:00,0,I'm hoping to purchase a resort in the Morson area. I've heard some have been for sale recently. Can anyone tell me for certain which places might really be on the market? I would rather have a place that has been taken care of well and not have to spend too much time and money fixing a place up. Any info woudl be appreciated. Thank you. Looking

The place always looks nice on the outside. I wonder if it's the same inside. I would rather not be on an island if I could help it. I dont want the hassle. Mainland would be my first choice. Lookin"
563825,Guest,2007-03-10 15:13:00,0,The folks that run the place we spend our time at in Morson have been thinking about selling in the near future. It's on the mainland and would be worth more than any of the island places. I'm not sure I should say the name over the web like this yet. I could check with them or you could email them or something perhaps. I don't want to talk out of town in case they aren't ready to sell yet. You can bet that there will be a lot of interest if the word gets out though. I wish I had a pile of money to give them. I would scoop it up before it even hit the market. They have done nothing but spend money improving it since before we even started going there 10 years ago. Eye Master

He sometimes has listings that are not put on the website or he might know of another and can line it up. His name is Terry Halvorsen of Borderland Realty - www.borderlandrealty.com"

Falsely posting a place for sale would be a bad deal IMHO. A quick phone call should get you the info you are looking for. Good luck, let us know how it turns out.

They said they are ready to puruse selling the property and have in intereted party they are talking to. So they asked not to say anything officially yet. They also said if it doesnt work out with the interested party, they may be listing with a realtor or doing some ads or things of that nature. Good luck in your search. I would keep a close eye on things if I was serious about buying."
