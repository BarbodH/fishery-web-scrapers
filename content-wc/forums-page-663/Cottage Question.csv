Does anyone know of any websites, books, or any other information that gives designs, plans or ideas as for things we can do? I have had poor luck in finding any. Any help would be appreciated."

Check out the site, call or email and ask for Shaun. He's the man. I've seen their work in the Morson area of Lake of the Woods. Places I never thought I would see a dock and/boat lift. Sheer rock walls, deep water, etc."
