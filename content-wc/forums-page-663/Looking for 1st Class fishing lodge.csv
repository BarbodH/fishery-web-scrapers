563495,Jigger1,2007-02-20 20:21:00,234,"Of course we had a good time. No giants in 06 4-27's topped the scales, but volume was solid, not as great as 05, but solid. Our group boated nearly 600 slot or larger fish in five days. My son came along and he caught one of the 27's. We are totally spoiled but hope to get back on the MA trail this year!"

563512,Guest,2007-02-21 16:58:00,0,"I would second the suggestion for Tetu Island Lodge. The best in Canada as far as I'm concerned. Amazing fishing, food, cabins, and service. I'll be there twice in '07---hope to see you there! tetuislandlodge.com"
563515,Guest,2007-02-21 21:43:00,0,My group has fished at happy landing twice in the early spring. The fishing has been great as well as the cabins and the service. I can't wait until our next trip.

563660,Guest,2007-02-26 19:10:00,0,"I think you just did. My question for you is why would you feel this way ? I guide there & do know that our guests always have a great trip. I also know that whenever anyone gets into trouble on the lake , Totem guides (and management) are always one of the first to respond. I don't know why y'all still hate us....... I would say that the list offered to you here is a impressive one and I'm positive that you will have a great time - wherever you choose to go ! You just can't go wrong fishing here in God's Country ! Good Fishen Rob"

563946,Guest,2007-03-16 13:43:00,0,Take a look at Buena Vista Resort on Lake of the Woods in Morson. Morson is at the center of Lake of the Woods and the resort has a good restaurant and clean room and guides who will do shorelunch and 21 ft Barons. It 45 miles from the Baudette border crossing and at the most 7 hours from Minneapolis. The website is: buenavistaresort.com
563472,bigbuck,2007-02-20 06:23:00,69,"The old Knee Lake resort north of Winnipeg. I believe it's called Northstar Resort now (under new ownership). My in-laws went there a couple of times and said that was the best fishing resort they had ever been to (my father-in-law spent the 70's and 80's fishing everywhere and anywhere in Northern Manitoba and Northern Ontario).www.northstarresort.ca Also, check out Witch Bay and also Smith Camps on LOTW. I know that Smith Camps has a pretty good restaurant and pub on site. We go every year when visiting the in-laws."
563474,thunderatwork,2007-02-20 07:06:00,79,"used to be called grassy narrows, now i think its called dream catcher lodge. A boat resort on the english river. located northeast of kenora 45 miles(allow a hour plus). this meets all of your criteria, however the guides vary. Try to get an older guide,at least thats my experience. Excellent walleye on some of the best waters in ontario. Not quite as commercialized as some of the llake of the woods places."

563477,Guest,2007-02-20 08:12:00,0,"Before selecting a facility, check with the lodge and outfitters association for that jurisdiction.....they can be of assistance. For facilities in Manitoba (seven hours away), visit www.mloa.com. There are even some good deals for some fishing and huntings trips on the main page of the site."

563489,Mully,2007-02-20 13:29:00,145,"I second Silver Water Wheel Lodge. Even I havn't been there, I feel confident in my recommendation. Someone who I have gotten to know over the years has been fishing Canada for 30 years. He swears by Silver Water Wheel. They had missed only one year and now his group has difficulty in getting reservations. There is a waiting list. He claimed the fishing and the service were second to none and while I have only been to a couple of resorts on Eagle Lake myself, I know he know what he is talking about. I liked my experiences on Eagle Lake but none would compare to SWWR. Good luck"
563456,mr ducks,2007-02-19 09:54:00,1459,"I want to go to a really nice place that has great fishing--I know, I know, so does everybody else. What I want is a lodge with american plan, good guides that do shorelunch and clean accomodations. Would prefer to have it within a days drive of Minneapolis--say 8-10 hours! Appreciate your suggestions"
563458,Roger Benoit,2007-02-19 10:24:00,93,"Check out www.pineislandlodge.com Its a little further than 8-10hrs, but not by much and well worth it. You can contact Brian Burgess @ 204-837-6804 Roger"
563460,rather-be-fishin,2007-02-19 11:54:00,429,"Try Silver Water Wheel on Lac Seul Lake. They have a waiting list, but are a 1st class place and you will catch lots of awesome walleyes! :) If you don't want to be on a waiting list, try Fisherman's Cove, Evergreen Resort, Onaway Lodge all on Lac Seul. Good luck and happy fishing! :-)"

563463,Guest,2007-02-19 15:12:00,0,"Try Tetu Island Lodge. It's nine hours from the Twin Cities, and is exactly what you are looking for. Much better than Totem. The cabins, guides, food, and fishing are outstanding, and the service is second to none.www.tetuislandlodge.com"
563464,Guest,2007-02-19 17:21:00,0,"Try Happy Lanidng Lodge. It's 6.5 hours from the Twin Cities, and is exactly what you are looking for. They limit the nubmer of guests to 24 people at a time. The cabins, guides, food, fishing and service are outstanding. Plus unlike may other resorts you can fish for walleye, smallmouth bass, muskie, lake trout, northern, and largemouth bass.www.happylandingfishing.com"
563466,tly,2007-02-19 19:14:00,1900,"Anderson's at Sioux Lookout has excellent accomdations, great restaurant and provides fishing at Lec Seul and other waters. We have used them as flyins in the past and also meet their guide boats on Lac seul. Not sure about current pricing but they were not out of line when we wnet there."
563467,Jigger1,2007-02-19 20:16:00,234,"If walleye is your target, in my humble opinion, there is no other choice than Silver Water Wheel Lodge on Lac Seul. This is year eight for my group and if I can pull it off, will be booked there for the rest of my life. Tremendous walleye fishery and Mike runs a fabulous first class lodge."
563468,MN_Moose,2007-02-19 21:14:00,965,Might be a nice place but their web site is lacking. There is no location information.
