563984,Guest,2007-03-18 20:18:00,0,"> Hello - I am the current owner of Pasha Lake. A guest of ours informed me about this post and directed me to it. Cap't Bob is no longer with us, he has since retired as is living the high life somewhere. If I can answer any questions about us or the area, please don't hesitate to give me a call. Thanks Chad Watch out for the charter cap't Bob. He's a real nut job. He >runs the jet boat charter and was a big contributor to the >demise of the central part of the lake Nipigon lake trout."

563552,515,2007-02-23 09:48:00,254,Hey Toby. I curious and maybe you can explain how one person can lead to the demise of the lake trout in such a huge lake?

563627,toby,2007-02-24 09:59:00,49,"As I stated he was a contributor. For years I watched his charter boat return to the dock daily with coolers full of 30 to 50lb. lake trout. One of his more memorable quotes: ""Its the catch and release fisherman from Minnesota that are ruining this lake"". Now the flatlander area of the lake is is almost void of trophies and he was a big contributor to this demise."

563638,Guest,2007-02-25 16:40:00,0,Went to Pasha many years ago. There were no Walleye in the lake then and I read a post last year there still are no Walleye. That is why if you want Walleye you have to portage to a different lake or haul the boat.
