563760,Guest,2007-03-07 16:58:00,0,"I bought the unit and chip last year and could not be happier. I didn't think the batteries were that big of an issue, once I got to where I was going I would typically turn it off. Just carry some extra batteries and you will be fine. On a body of water that is the size of Lac Seul, the chip is extremely valueable. Yes, it might not locate every hazard to the nearest foot, but it will get you back to camp if you get lost. Maps are great if you know how to read them and know where you are on it. We have helped several people in the ten years we have been there find their way back to camp even though they had a well marked map."

You can get them cheaper there as well. hey, that $99 price, is that for the 06 or the 07. i already have the 06 but need to update to 07 as a lake i fish alot (minitakki) is not on the 06 but is on the 07. the chip is awsome. it got me safely and quickly to spots on lac seul it would have taken me hours to find on my own with just a paper map. i'm a big time believer and i heard the 07 version of lac seul is even better. scar"
563811,schick,2007-03-10 05:17:00,35,"I have the Lowrance 334C and the Navionics chip. It worked great on Lac Seul last year. The chip is very accurate. I previously owned 2 Lowrance 332C with the external antenna and had problems with both, but each time Scheels and/or Lowrance took them back and eventually replace it with the 334C. This spring the sonar stopped working on the 334c, but Lowrance is going to fix it or replace it and extend my warranty for another 6 months. So, while I have had problems I have been very satisfied with Lowrance's service. The color GPS is great. NE Piker"
563816,Guest,2007-03-10 07:46:00,0,"I have both, I use the chip in my FishStrike 1000C and carry the H2O handheld as a backup unit or to use if I am not in my own boat. The chip is great, would recommend a good paper map to use in conjunction with it. I really like the H2O as well, easy to use, the color is easier to read but I understand it is harder on batteries. I think you would be quite happy with both."
563820,scar,2007-03-10 10:08:00,196,anyone know of a better price than $269.99? thats what reeds and bass pro have them for right now. scar
563861,Catman59,2007-03-12 13:30:00,345,"I upgraded just a little further and went with the Expedition C. Barometer and compass in those.Also give weather warnings when they are issued. Its $30 more , but a heck of a GPS.....and BTW it has a built in MP-3 player too."
563909,Guest,2007-03-15 09:47:00,0,Check on e-bay. I have seen a number of them for sale in the $200.00 range.
563959,Guest,2007-03-17 09:24:00,0,"I bought mine from tigergps.com they are selling them for $219 and could not be happier. I bought this unit because my x-15 will not run the latest chips. I need the back light on to read the unit but since I use the cigarette lighter plug the battery thing does not bother me. I also bought a ram mount system for it. A little pricey but now it mounts on the boat and I use it in the car also, great on trips. How is Navionic's 07 chip for Lac Seul? I fish the NW side and from what I have seen on the 06 chip, it does not give you very good detail."

They will ship anywhere. Go to www.gpscentral.com and click on Lowrance. It's a great unit at a great price and includes a 12 volt cigarette adaptor.

I think the detail is about the same. I used the 06 chip (in 06) and thought the chip was brilliant. Not bad for a wild place."
563731,Guest,2007-03-05 20:13:00,0,what do you think of this gps unit. bass pro has the big sale going on now. also what do you think of the navionics premium hot maps for canada ( $ 99.00 ) i looked at alot of gps this on seems to be the best one for price and ease of use. will be at evergreen lodge end of june thanks for your help wayne
563732,prov1900,2007-03-05 20:44:00,544,"Good unit, great chip. I don't have the unit, but hear great things about it, although I hear the color one eats batteries. Regardless, IMO, you need a gps for that lake and the chip is a must. Lowrance has good customer service. People complain about the long waits on hold, but they are much better than the other companies in my opinion. I would like to have one for ice fishing. Someday. When my better half isn't looking."
563738,Mark R,2007-03-06 14:55:00,1538,We took one up last year and it worked Ok except going thru Shanty Narrows. When you get to camp Gary will give you a well marked map has all the hazards on it. I would trust his map before I would trust the chip. Which isn't to say that's all you use the GPS for
563740,2 DOGS,2007-03-06 18:06:00,361,"Ah yes, Shanty claimed one (at least) to the tune of $3500 last year. There is a right side and wrong side to those buoys!!"
563742,prov1900,2007-03-06 18:59:00,544,"Well, the way I saw it, the buoys were wrong and the chip was right. Going east, at that one island by the buoys, we followed the chip to the letter, all week long and never hit anything. My buddy, who didn't have the chip, followed the buoys and wacked his lower unit. I love that chip....no damage in two trips to Lac Seul."
563743,hawkeye,2007-03-06 19:32:00,112,"I have a black and white I-Finder pro. Doesn't need to be back-lighted, Have had it damaged by letting it get wet. Also have the waterproof color H2o c. For by eyes I cannot use the screen with out the backlight. I love it but only use when external battery available. I am surprised for what you can buy one for, could it be possiable a new version on the horizon?"
