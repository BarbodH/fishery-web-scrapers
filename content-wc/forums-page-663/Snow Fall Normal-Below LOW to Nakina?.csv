563886,Bill Krejca,2007-03-14 09:39:00,6107,I'm guessing the snow has been less than normal over most of the area. Is this a fair assumption? And that we can expect low lake levels unless there are some heavy spring rains?

Unless we get a couple big blasts of snow, or the heavy spring rains, water will continue to be down. If things don't improve, it might make for a bad spawning season this year.

563957,ONE TIME DAVE,2007-03-17 07:53:00,110,My outfitter (Arctic Watershed Outposts) in Nakina reports that this winter has been mild with minimal snow and same for rain in the fall. Will need a VERY wet spring or all lakes will be low. This makes for difficult landing for float planes along with difficult fishing.
