I'm planning on going in 2008 but the week I'm looking at is a week before a full moon. Last year we where there during a full moon and did great. Does it matter? What does everyone think?"

My experience is that this seems to apply more on lakes than on rivers such as the Red River during the fall greenback run.
563981,Guest,2007-03-18 18:45:00,0,I have not been able to pick many trips according to Lunar tables (I am pretty much tied into a date for my trip to Canada). But by my experience I would say the tables are pretty accurate for a good bite if you get decent weather. I do definately plan my day trips back home around the tables. I think there really is something to it!
