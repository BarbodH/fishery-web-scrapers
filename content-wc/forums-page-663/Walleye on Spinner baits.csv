563937,Guest,2007-03-16 09:31:00,0,I have been told that a great tactic for Walleye is casting shorelines with Spinner baits just like bass Fishing. Anybody do that????
563941,jigman 2003,2007-03-16 09:59:00,981,I've done it in the late spring on flowages here in WI. Any emerging weeds would hold fish. Sometimes I'd catch them in 2' of water or less. It is an aggressive bite when the conditions are right.
563942,Guest,2007-03-16 10:58:00,0,"I've had some luck, but only with smaller sized spinnerbaits, much smaller than the size typically used for bass (largemouth, anyway), and with slower retrieves that tick the bottom. From the size of a beetle spin up to something about ""twice"" the size of a beetle spin is what I mean by smaller. I also like to use plastics more than skirts with walleyes, and the single blade type. But that's just my experience."

563947,Burr,2007-03-16 14:05:00,8612,"I've not tried it, but there is an article in the most recent issue of In-Fish dedicated to catching walleye on Spinner baits. I'm thinking I may have to put on a disguise and go shopping in the bass isles... Hope nobody sees me."

563965,mcdee,2007-03-18 08:50:00,276,Jigs and spinners are deadly! Put the two together and you get a spinner bait. :rock-on:
