534269,Guest,2003-08-10 15:46:00,0,I have booked a trip the last week of August at the Little Moose Lodge on the Pipstone chain of lakes and was wondering if you can tell me how the fishing is here and what we can expect. What type of fish can we expect to catch on this lake and how many?? Any info would be greatly appreciated as this is my first trip to Canada and would like to know what I am getting into... Thanx Again Jason
