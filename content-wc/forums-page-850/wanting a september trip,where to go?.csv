534265,Guest,2003-08-10 11:07:00,0,"You certainly should look into Lake of the Woods Lodge, Nestor Falls. Offers excellent accommodations for either AP or HK. Good boats, motors, guides if needed. Superb meals. Not only that, the fishing in the immediate area close to the resort is outta this world. I am at the place now. Leaving later today and going to regret having to leave too.http://www.lakeofthewoodslodge.com Ron"

Reasonable prices. Great fishing. This is a fisherman's camp run by a couple who cater to serious (and not-so-serious) fisherman and who are very customer oriented.www.witchbay.com is their website and it provides a lot of information about the camp. You might look in the section called ""Gabbin' With Gail"" for customer feedback given to them. I have made a lot of friends (fellow customers) in that camp over the past 10 years and MOST of the customers are repeat business. That says a lot about the camp."
