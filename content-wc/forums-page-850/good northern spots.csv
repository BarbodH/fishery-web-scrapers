534273,Guest,2003-08-10 19:10:00,0,"I guess you would have to define prime. When the sauger start coming up the red, jacks do follow them and are caught in the red. Having said that, if I was seriously interested in pursuing large northerns in october, I would look at the winnipeg above some of the dams. Point du bois, Lac du Bonnet, bird lake are within 2 hours of Selkirk or Pine Falls. Big Whites#### could be another option same approximate travel time. http://members3.boardhost.comfishmanitoba/ is a site where you could probably get a lot of useful information, depending on who bothers to respond. Check to see if you can find chrism who visits this site as well, he seems to have a good grasp on things in manitoba"
