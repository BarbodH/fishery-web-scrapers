Based on all the posts I have read on this message board, I am very much looking forward to fishing Lac Seul for the first time.I will be using a camp boat. Thanks"

IF YOU WANT EATERS, GO TO MOUTH OF WENASAGA, STEAMBOAT, OR REALLY CLOSE TO CAMP UNDER "" THE BRIDGE "". NOW IF YOU WANT A CHANCE AT A MONSTER, GO TO McKENZIE BAY, IT'S A LITTLE DRIVE, BUT WORH IT. AS FAR AS COLORS, ANYTHING WILL WORK. HAMMERED NICKLE HAS BEEN MY BEST. GOOD LUCK."
