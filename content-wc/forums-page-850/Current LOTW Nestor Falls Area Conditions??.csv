I had the pleasure of stay at Lake of the Woods Lodge http://www.lakeofthewoodslodge.com The water is down yes, the alge was just starting to clear up and bottom at the docks was visable, fishing however was absolutely great. Walleye were hitting, the perch (for the kids) were very accommodating, and the odd muskie was seen following the lures. What we need is a little more cooler weather, and maybe one good storm to get things turned on a bit better. Outside of that, I had a spectacular time. IF you are looking for a place to hunt or fish, I strongly suggest LOTW Lodge. It is rustic but modern. Cabins, staff, and new owners are fantastic people. I rate this facility a a solid Four Stars, out of Five. That is saying something. Ron Thompsonhttp://www.kenoraontario.net"

It was the best I've seen in the 4 years I've been going there. You have to work for the fiah but I never came in empty. I was using Crawlers with #5 Gold blades. The Bass fisherman were very happy, Northerns were biting too. The camp didn't have a musky caught the week I was there. I did pick up three Lake Trout - a first for me. The water was ~3 feet low which made it harder to launch the boat but I didn't have trouble with the rocks in the lake. Watch your map and you will be OK. Good Luck!"
