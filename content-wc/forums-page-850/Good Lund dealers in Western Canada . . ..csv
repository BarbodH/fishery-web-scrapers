I've tried e-mailing some of the dealers listed on the Lund site, but all but one have not contacted me back. Is this normal?"

534262,Guest,2003-08-09 23:27:00,0,Thanks for the info guys. It's amazing how many people will not even contact you after you send them an e-mail saying that you are interested in buying in the next 6-8 months.
