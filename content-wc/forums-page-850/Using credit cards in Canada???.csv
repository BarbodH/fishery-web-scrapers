When we checked out and settled up our bill, the owner was not present, one of her helpers was. Let me just say that all prices are listed in Canadian funds, which is fine. He tallies up the bill and it comes to $520 canadian, he converts it to US funds using a 30% exchange ($400 US) At the time we did not know the exchange was up to 40%. He writes the $400 on the credit card slips. We think nothing of it assuming that the credit card company will apply the exchange when it is tallied. With 40% exchange it would have been approx $370 US. We all just recieved our CC bills and the total was $400 US. I don't mean to sound like a tight butt, but they made almost $200 US by not applying the correct exchange. Do you have any suggestions???"

She may also point out some things that you did not know that were happening and the $400 may be correct. The point is, give her a chance to make it good. Are you sure the exchange rate was 40%? That doesn't sound right to me. I DO know that the dollar has been weakened over the past several months. If I recall correctly last year $1.00 U.S. got $1.35 Canadian. In July, if memory serves me right, that same $1.00 U.S. got only $1.25 Canadian. I cannot figure out where it ever was 40%. You might call your card-issuing bank or do some online research to find out what the rate was."
534292,Vitreum,2003-08-11 17:57:00,221,http://www.forecasts.org/exchange-ra...hange-rate.htm looks like the current rate is about 40%. this sounds really strange to me. i would think that the owner could have charged you in canadian funds and the credit card company would have done the proper exchange. did not realize that a canadian vendor could process credit cards in us dollars.

534307,E_Fish_N_See,2003-08-12 06:17:00,26,You will always get the best market rate for exchange using your Credit Card and purchasing it the host currency. That way you are not relying on the user screwing you with the exchange rate they think is the right one.
534310,Guest,2003-08-12 07:47:00,0,"I think some camps use a standard exchange rate rather than checking to see what it is. Of course they use an exchange rate that they are sure will work in their favor. However, like others have said, if you use a credit card they should charge the canadian price and get the bank exchange rate. I have had canadina camps that charge in US rates need to change to canadian before running a credit card but not the other way around."
