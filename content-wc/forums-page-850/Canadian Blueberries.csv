They are most common in a relatively new clear cut area. They begin to show up about year 4 or 5 and continue until they are shaded out by the new tree growth. They get ripe most years in late July and carry into September if conditions are faverable. They were dead ripe and very plentiful last weekend around Perrault Falls. They are clustered this year like grapes and very sweet. My wife just brought fresh muffins out of the oven.... so I thought I'd share her recipe: 4 eggs 1 cup melted margrine 2 cups sugar 2 cup sour cream 4 cups flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 2 cups Canadain blueberrys Mix the first four ingredents, then add the dry ingredents. Spoon into muffin cups. Bake at 375 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes. If I'm lucky she'll bake a blueberry pie one of these first days, and I'll ""borrow"" that recipe too. :)"

When I was young, it was a treat in the summer to visit my grandparents and eat all the fresh blueberry pies, muffins & pancakes imaginable. By the way, an easy way to freeze and transport the berries is to put them in empty 2 qt.paper milk containers, seal the containers with tape and then freeze them overnight in a freezer before transporting them back home. Enjoy a muffin for me with extra butter."

534343,Guest,2003-08-13 01:57:00,0,"Thanks for the info on the blueberries. My wife and I are heading up Minaki way this coming week and she just loves blueberries. Although it will cut into my valuable fishing time, taking a break now and then to hunt some berries will make her happy. If we manage to pick a few do you think we can legally bring them back across the border?"
534346,Guest,2003-08-13 06:33:00,0,"Just returned from Gull Rock Lake. I take a few days away from husband and kids to go berry picking and bring home a tasty gift for friends. Brought home six gallons of berries this year, it was a great year for picking! About the return trip with berries, we have mentioned in past years that we had berries at the border and nothing was said. Also when stopped for a fish check on return trip MNR guy said nothing about the fact that I had about five gallons that year. So I assume it's okay. I heard last night that about another week of berry picking is all you might expect. However you can stop at Dutchies and they sell them fresh and frozen for about $12 a gallon. A recipe to share that's easy and quite tasty! BLUEBERRY CAKE CUPS 1/4 c. flour 1/4 c. sugar 1/2 tsp. baking powder 1/4 tsp. cinnamon pinch of salt 1/4 c. milk 1 T. melted butter 1 c. bluberries Mix dry ingrediants, add milk and butter. Put half the berries into two greased 10 oz. custard cups. Pour batter on top, place remaining berries on top of the batter. Bake at 375 for 25-30 minutes. This is great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I imagine the antioxidants in the berries counteract the fat in the ice cream?! I also like more of the cake, so I double the amount of cake batter for the amount of berries."
