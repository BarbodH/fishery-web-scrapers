I know it's early but is the water down, up, anything more with buying out the netting rights???? What's the mood guys? By the way, you are really missing out if you never eat at the Manitou Lodge in the evening there in Pine Falls. The focaccia bread, pizza, scallops - everything is good and they cook it all in a wood burning oven. Todd Yup, got her... oh yeah... feel that head shake!"

534226,Backwater Eddy,2003-08-07 22:44:00,3871,"What I do know so far Todd is there is a good hatch of baitfish in the rivers already, lots of chow. Sauger action is very good now up yonder. The catfish action has been almost nonstop all summer. Lots of chubby fish in the system. I would venture to say it looks optimistic for fall 2003. No new word on nets?

534244,Guest,2003-08-08 15:31:00,0,"Todd, We have been going up to Pine Falls on and off for the last 18 years. Our group is considering going else where this year. It seems like the last several years that the fishing for the greenbacks has been really slow. I have been reading the comments about nets what do you think?? I know that the Winnipeg river up around Minaki is low and there is very little current, way less than usual, a buddy just got back. I will be up in Minaki over Labor Day. It seems like the last several years that they have not been releasing the water that they used to, and I believe that this also has hurt the fishing. Heck when we first started going up we almost always got into the pigs I miss those days. Are you from Nebraska?? I live south of Papillion, it would be fun to get together and compare notes.

534264,Guest,2003-08-10 10:04:00,0,"For what it's worth I'll throw in my two cents worth on how I feel the fall of 2003 will play out on the Winnipeg and Red Rivers. First off I feel that unless there's a signifcant increase in water flow on the 'peg, sadly it will be a right off. LOTW is extremely low this summer and there's very little flow coming down the 'peg river.....no flow spells no fall migration into the river this fall. The Red however is a different story. Although levels on the Red are a couple of feet below average, the flow rates are reasonable. Presently the Red is literally infested with emerald shiners, I'm talking bank to bank full! If this pattern continues into the ""fall"", you'd better make sure those hooks are sharp for ""ol marble 'eyes is going to be on the prowl, big time! Over the past couple of weeks or since the shiners have been filling the river, the sauger were quick to follow their primary food source in to the river as well. In all honesty we can't say for sure how the ""fall run"" will play out, we'll just have to keep our fingers crossed! Fish ""Hard"" Forever!"
534282,Todd_NE,2003-08-11 08:32:00,1330,"A who's who on here! Sorry guys, I started the thread and then was gone at a tourney. I'd heard the water may be down, I hope it rebounds for the fall! We'll definitely head to the Red if we need too. The place we stay is the Manitou Lodge at the north end of Pine Falls, very nice place. I live in West Point, Nebraska. Personally, I detest the nets simply because the fishing is good enough for sustenance if that was what someone was after. Netting is not necessary to put up a larder of fish. OR if the nets were in for a few days I could live with that, but for weeks and weeks, nope I don't buy that argument. As I'm not a Canadian resident, I don't have too much to say about what that government does and doesn't allow. I do, however, have a choice about where my group goes and the money we spend. While I'm sure many ""locals"" would prefer that less fisherman are on the water I suspect the local economies in Pine Falls and Selkirk are far more dependent on tourism dollars than is realized. With the conservative limits (which are great) I also don't think the fisherman are damaging the fishery. That said, my favorite week of the year is going to Manitoba and I hope that continues for a long time. We've made great friends and love the area, but the bottomline is we come to fish (Ok, a few other things too Carlson :) ). Without great fishing, it's just as easy to drive 11 hours somewhere else (Erie, Bay De Noc, Ft. Peck, Mille Lacs, Devil's Lake, etc.). We've had some great years, but the last few have been flat for us. Is it the weather, the nets, our fishing skills, our timing? I'm not sure, but it is easy to point a finger at the nets. I can't even see how the fish get through them to be honest they cover so much of the mouth of the Winnipeg. Todd Yup, got her... oh yeah... feel that head shake!"
