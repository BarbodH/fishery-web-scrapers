534187,Mahumba,2003-08-06 08:47:00,345,How many of you guys have seen other people use their Bushnel fish finders? I swear that they are just scanning the lake until they see one person catch a fish and motor over to them and crowd them out. Happened to me and I just left. It was big water and there were other places to fish. But as soon as I hooked into another fish here comes the armada again. So I went to another spot and faked catching a fish. And here they came again! I'm not talking one boat there were 6 of them!!! I moved again and faked another one. They followed. Now I was starting to have fun!!! I went to a small reef but to the other side of it. I faked catching a fish. I saw these boats comming and then I started feeling bad as I was about to set them up into ripping over this unmarked reef. But guess what? They knew it was there and I thought.........they know this lake as well as I do!!!! This is when I started feeling angry. They know this lake and wait for others to do the work. I packed up and went home. Anyone else have stuff like this happen? And what did you do about it? Roger Mayer.

Last week we went to a reef and there was not a boat in sight, and soon we caught 2 nice eyes and before you know it here comes another boat at WOT. I made a joke to my partner that if I ever have motor trouble that faking catching fish will draw more attention than shooting up distress flares. As it ended up, I think it was just a coincidence. It was a large reef and the boat that came in was very courteous and never tried to push us off the spot, even after we caught another 2 fish. I too have binocs in my boat, but I use them to see wildlife, or check if that boat in the distance is someone I know. IaCraig"

My wife and I were in one boat and friends of ours were in a 2nd boat. We had looked all morning to find fish and finally got on a sizable school and were vertical jigging. We had been there about 20 minutes when a boat with local registration pulled along side of us. The 2 occupants never talked to anyone in either of our boats. One of those occupants said to the other ""Where do we want to fish?"" The other said ""Their marker buoy is over there."" At that point, the guy in the bow put down their trolling motor and moved over to our marker and they both started to vertical jig around it. I got fed up with them and pretended to be looking down at the water while moving our boat right at theirs with our trolling motor. They decided to move around me and came at our marker from the other side. I repeated the tactic. They repeated their response. I repeated the tactic again. By then they had caught one small walleye. The guy in the bow said to his partner (who had been on his cell phone doing business for much of the 15 minutes this was all going on) ""Do you need to go back in?"" The partner with the cell phone said ""Yah, this cannot wait. Besides we have enough for lunch."" They powered up and left. They never did say a word. Oh well."
534258,Guest,2003-08-09 10:05:00,0,can you tell if these are local people or visitors to canda? been going up for many years and dont recall this happening to us although we are not the best at catching fish. We do have a way of attracting the dnr or police.
534263,Guest,2003-08-10 09:30:00,0,"Years ago we had a lot of fun with a big rubber fish,..you could make it look pretty real by shaking it,..far enough away to fool them and caught that same fish a number of times,..word got out that it was the hottest spot in the lake. Day after day there was a crowd there."
534294,Guest,2003-08-11 18:01:00,0,"ex-pup, I am guessing your question was directed at me. My best guess was this was an Ontario local, probably from Kenora. That is the direction the boat went as it was headed ""back home"". His phone conversations seemed to imply that he was going to meet someone personally for business as soon as he got off the water. As we never had conversation with him, I did not ask where he was from. Both of the men in that boat did have a Canadian accent, so my conclusion is logical. However, that is not a blanket condemnation of Canadian fishermen. I have met locals who were very polite and very sportsman like in their pursuit of outdoor fun. Some of the people in the Ontario camp I go to have become close friends of mine. I like Canada and I like Canadians. This is merely one instance in 15 years of fishing Canada where we ran into a real lout. I would have liked to spray the guy with a water cannon. So would the people in the other boat who accompanied us to that spot. We could not believe how rude that guy was."
