Modern cabins, all with inside facilities, diningroom, etc. You have an option at this lodge which many do not offer. Portage Lakes. Eight of them. Most contain good catches of smallmouth bass and northern pike. One has very nice walleye, bass and pike. In the general area of the lodge on Lake of the Woods you will find excellent walleye fishing, and believe me superb Muskie fishing if that is what you are looking for. In the early years, it was called. Crow Rock Muskie Camp or something to that nature. Muskie are in the area and in neat size too. If you wisht to contact me personally [email protected] is fine with me. Ronhttp://www.kenoraontario.net You cannot miss on this place. It is great."
