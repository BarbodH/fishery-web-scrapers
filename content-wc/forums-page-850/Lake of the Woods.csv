Doubtful about next too, unless we get a lot of rain this fall, and snow during the winter. Low water certainly has not hurt the fishing whatsoever. In fact in the long term this low water could very well help in the years to come. Believe me on that one. Not sure where you are thinking of going, but I was at Lake of the Woods Lodge in Nestor Falls a week ago. http://www.lakeofthewoodslodge.com and had a fantastic time, as did the others in the lodge. They offer both HK and AP. Great fishing, great people, great food too. Ron"
533979,Guest,2003-07-30 17:57:00,0,My cousin and I are discussing our upcoming trip to Lake of the Woods in late October. He's all in a panic hearing that the water is low and also may be waaay low in October. Any truth to this? Is lotw lower now than last year at this time? I would appreciate any info. Thanks!
533982,Guest,2003-07-30 19:08:00,0,I was on the Woods in June and it was about 4 feet low. I can't say what it is now but I have heard it is still pretty low. Didn't really effect my fishing much. They were pretty mush in the same place as always.
533983,Guest,2003-07-30 19:38:00,0,"As of mid-July, LOTW was three feet low. Don't know what's happened since then; haven't been following rainfall, weather reports, etc. As for what the conditions will be in October, I'm sure you understand that's difficult to forecast as of now. Even so, we didn't have any problems navigating or fishing. Just use a good quality map and a great deal of COMMON SENSE when navigating. Amplify the rules you should normally follow: never pass between two bodies of land close together; always go wide around points; always approach shore perpendicularly rather than angling in; and when you are traveling parallel and close to shore, make sure you're doing it on your trolling motor, not your outboard. Good luck and have a blast. Lunk"

At first I was panicky because the boat launch area was so low, but the camp crew walked my boat off the trailer and guided it to slightly deeper water before they let me start it up. Then I was concerned because of all the rocks I could see. But the more I fished it, I found that it was a benefit to see those rocks. I had known they were there all along so I knew where to be careful, but seeing them let me analyze why I was catching fish in them when the water was at normal height. Get a good map. Learn how to identify shallow spots and rock hazards if you do not already know. Be careful. I was fine and you should be also. By the second day I was careful but no longer concerned. You KNOW where the deep water is. Try to stay in it while you are traveling. My mapping GPS was a big help because I could follow along on the marked travel routes which I knew were absolutely safe ... that is why they were marked as travel routes on the map!!"

It will probably stay this way until next spring(if they get snow) I would not cancel any plans or future trips. Just watch the lake a little closer, its not that bad as some make it sound. I am actually leaving this afternoon for another trip to the NW Angle. Good Luck"
534010,River_eye,2003-07-31 11:09:00,1486,"Everybody is telling you that it is 3-4 ft low, but it's not really that low, it's just that the last 5 years have been higher than average."
534011,Guest,2003-07-31 11:18:00,0,"I was up last week and River Eye is right, it's more like 2 feet low, may be 2 1/2. No big deal just be careful."
534013,balsl6,2003-07-31 11:58:00,426,Rivereye is right I am going by last year when I say 3-4 feet. It really is not that big of deal.
534015,Guest,2003-07-31 13:13:00,0,"Per the LOTW water control board, the water is at 1057.9 ft. above sea level and is at its lowest level for this time of year since 1988. From a review of the historical data, it looks like normal for this time of year is about 1059.9, give or take a few inches, so currently down about two feet from normal. Also, in 1988 the level was almost back to 1060 by October, apparently due to a wet Sept., so things can still turn around this year but that could slow the fishing down which has been pretty good all season."
