Great seeing so many of the familiar faces of the CIFC and getting to meet a lot of the new blood that the CIFC is starting to attract. Thanks also to the many sponsors of the CIFC, including our main supporters Sorel/Columbia and the Town of Georgina. Jamie at Captain Morbids Bait and Tackle did a great job of making sure the participants had their bait and tackle needs looked after. Thanks to Ward 4 Councilor Ken Hackenbook for all his help on the stage and his continued support of the CIFC. Thanks go out as well to Larry(The Ice Boss) and all our controllers Rob, Mark, Zack, Adam, Jamie, Andre and Cory for all their hard work, from getting the hall set up and taken down, to their work out on the ice, getting the zone set up, inspecting equipment and scoring the fish. Ted from Top Bass did and awesome job at the weigh in on Saturday. We scored and released 68 teams worth of fish, in under an hour. Thanks for your help Ted. Our appreciation also goes out to John and Chett Newbrough from www.dryicemachines.net for their demonstrations with the WILCRAFT and for helping with our taxi service. It was by far the best couple of days I've ever seen weather wise for the tournament. Congratulations to all the teams for being such great sportsman and best of luck to everyone next year at the 2009 CIFC. Like Ryan said time to start practicing!!
