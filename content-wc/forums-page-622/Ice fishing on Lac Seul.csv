571626,Guest,2008-02-24 23:11:00,0,Planning on doing some ice fishing on Lac Seul. Anyone been out to the Sawmill Bay area lately. Just wondering if its still too early or have they moved in already and I am missing some fun.
571635,Guest,2008-02-25 09:41:00,0,"Sawmill Bay? Did you mean Lac Des Mille Lacs or Lac Seul? Regardless, fishing on LDML has been fair to slow most of the winter and I think it will be another month before that good late-ice bite starts really going. As for Lac Seul, compared to summer, it's slow in winter, but inevitably you'll find some fish. NWO Fishing Bum"

571642,Guest,2008-02-25 20:05:00,0,"Oh really...some friends tried the Manitoba Point area late last-March but didn't do overly well. Other attempts made further south/east from there have been the same though they came more mid-winter (like now). When you say you did well last year, do you care to expand at all? The thing I hate about ice fishing is the inability or difficulty to cover water...on a lake like Lac Seul (or Lac Des Mille Lacs for that matter) I find that effect magnified. So you end up trying everything: mid-lake reefs, drop-offs, mega-sand structure, where they were late in the fall, where you find them at ice-out/opener, pre-spawn, current....you're always second-guessing yourself, but unlike on soft water, it's a pain in the toockus (sp?) to cover all those possibilities.

571673,Guest,2008-02-26 17:15:00,0,I agree. I went out this past weekend fished like a demon and caught nothing. I went back to buddies camp and drilled a few holes out front. Several nice walleyes and 2 pike. You never know.
