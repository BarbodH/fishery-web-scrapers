571304,Matches,2008-02-09 17:17:00,236,"You're right. They call it an advance payment. Even the Irs site does not explain it very well. I guess, as the saying goes, nothing in this world is free.http://www.irs.gov/irs/article/0,,id=177937,00.html"

571545,Guest,2008-02-20 10:18:00,0,lol and I'll be saving it in my savings account. hehe
571617,scott791,2008-02-23 15:25:00,7,Not me paying off John deere Lawn Mover worth every penny by the way. Will just go the proven route of saving a little each week. Wife and kids get to go full week this year and I get to go for half a week still better then not going.
571619,fourize,2008-02-24 06:47:00,287,"The first thing I thought when I heard about getting the rebate was ""That $600 is going towards my fishing trip to Canada"". Thanks GW."
571659,Guest,2008-02-26 10:50:00,0,Thats not a lot of cash anymore. The loonie flies high above the eagle. The eagle has been eating too much oriental food especially chinese......
571660,Guest,2008-02-26 11:26:00,0,"Agreed, This is the Ontario stimulus plan in my book."
571270,Matches,2008-02-08 08:54:00,236,"Congress approved the Tax Rebate. Average couple will be receiving around $600. I will save my Tax Rebate and spend 100% of it in Canada, and feel like the Govenment is paying for my fishing vacation... (...if my wife lets me)."
571271,Guest,2008-02-08 09:01:00,0,I thought couples get $1200
571273,Obabikon,2008-02-08 09:04:00,2370,It ranges from 300-600 per person. Depending on how much you make (i believe)

571275,Guest,2008-02-08 10:05:00,0,Me too. LOL
571276,Guest,2008-02-08 12:07:00,0,That is UN American. This money is suppose to be used to stimulate the US economy. Spend the money on a Penn reel and St Croix rod both made in the USA. You should have enough left over to buy a good pair of Danner boots also made in the USA. You can't have enough good equipment on your trip to Canada. That's what I'm going to do. I'll spend my welfare money in Canada
571277,Guest,2008-02-08 12:10:00,0,Sorry about the previous post I ment to say the unemployment check would be spent in Canada not the welfare check.
571278,Guest,2008-02-08 12:13:00,0,Suppose I could give it to Hillary. Sounds like she needs the money.
571279,Guest,2008-02-08 13:22:00,0,I already buy all the Blue I can drink and all the nightcrawlers the walleye can eat. I'm not sure how I will spend more.
571291,Jimmy Jig,2008-02-08 19:41:00,1905,I was going to Canada anyway so maybe I'll use the extra $1200 for something else. Saved me and the wife $200 bucks by not buying passports too! Good thing I didn't jump in and buy one before the government disided to forget this passport thing for another year or so. Maybe in 2009 will need a passport card for half the cost.
