This is the best solution to any of the issues that have come up in this thread. I would expect that if my K-9 didn't live up to the expectations of the camp owner that I be told and would respect that decision. If it came down to that, then I failed as an owner and would be working on the K-9 behavior!"
571646,1shooter,2008-02-25 21:01:00,1493,Our dog has made the trip to canada a few times. We usually bring her if the weather looks good. If there is a lot of rain in the forecast she stays home. Nothing worse than a wet stinky dog. Keep in mind she doesn't bark and doesn't jump on people. She usualy is right by us or sitting in the boat worried she might get left behind. I agree with the other post about barking dogs or people who dont pick up after them. Nothing worse.
571650,v-bay gord,2008-02-26 07:38:00,3168,"Rose.....as a lodge owner there are two sides to the dog issue you need to consider. As has been pointed out there are people that will not come to your camp unless they can bring their dog. On the flip side there are people who likely will not come, or return, if they have a bad experience involving others pets....this can range from fear, noise, or allergies. Just an observation, everyone will claim their dog is small, well behaved, always picked up after, and on and on. In their minds this may be true, but my experience has proven otherwise. It is amazingly difficult to remove dog hair from a Hudsons Bay wool blanket....also amazingly irritating to have to repair the screen door on a cabin, or to step on a ""land mine"", or to intervene in a dog fight between the four legged members of the family. There was some mention of drunks or children having the potential to be more of a problem.....maybe, but the drunks or children don't often bite other guests (or other guests pets...or your pet). You also have to consider the problems associated with multiple pets in camp.....friendly dogs can be aggressive around other dogs, regardless what the owner tells you in advance. We love dogs, and have two at camp, but have long ago decided to have a no pet policy."
571651,Guest,2008-02-26 07:58:00,0,I do look forward to there being a Camp Dog in Camp.This is completely different than guest's pets. Camp Dogs have a personality all their own.I hope to came back as one in a future life.

571655,Obabikon,2008-02-26 09:49:00,2370,"It really is tough to beat the life of a camp dog. Infact, when we brought our dog home last fall, he moped around the house for about a month! Spoiled brat!"
571657,2746,2008-02-26 10:17:00,3206,"Sounds like a mixed bag so I'll add my 2 cents worth and further confuse the issue. First of all I love dogs and have owned and trained springers most of my life and grew up with working livestock dogs. I can't imagine life without dogs but as Pooch said earlier, they have their place. We don't travel with them and I would no more expect my friends, motels or fishing camps to welcome my dogs into their homes than I would accept your dog into mine. Most folks will say their dogs are well mannered and obedient and many are right but a large percentage are not. I've learned that the hard way by being a landlord. In 40 trips to Canada I've never stayed in a camp where pets are allowed, other than the camp dog. It's not something I've even checked into....just turned out that way, but if I found the camp allowed dogs I would not return. Like I said I love dogs But I don't want to live with someone elses pet or stay in a cabin with lingering dog/cat hair. (As someone else mentioned, I do love the camp labs however.....they have the life!)"
571666,Juls,2008-02-26 14:04:00,13414,I'm one of those people that would not patronize an establishment that did not allow dogs. Dogs Rule! :rock-on: Juls
571667,Ogoki,2008-02-26 14:10:00,291,"If anyone read my post on another thread I said I would be taking my two labs to an outpost where there is not another person on the lake except my wife , myself and the two dogs . That way I am not bothering anyone else and no one else bothering me . I probably would not ask to bring my dogs if I was going to a camp with other people around . Heck -that is the reason I go - to get away from it ALL. I don't think anyone should want to go on a vacation and be a bother to anyone or vise-versa . After spend the past 35 years in the service industry ( electric motors, controls etc) I am just sick of dealing with people . Most are good but the few really try my nerves anymore . Kind like............"

I betting that you keep track of your dog when they're outside and your dogs causes no problems, but unfortunately many don't. It doesn't take to many turned over garbage cans, frighten children or upset adults to make a resort owner ban dogs and customers not return to a place that allows them to run free. I don't think dogs or kids for that matter are the problem, its the owners/parents lack of responsibility that makes it hard for those who are responsible...imho That would work for irresponsible drunks too...:) Al"
571733,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-02-27 16:44:00,116,"Thank you everyone for the feedback. So far, none of our guests are bringing dogs. For the people who have asked, I told them that I'm worried about wolves. One fellow camp owner, just 12 miles up the road, had their dog attacked on the porch in broad day light. The owner happened to be right there. He grabbed a board and beat on the wolf who finally did let go of the dog. They spent hundreds of dollars at the vet, but the dog did make it. So when people ask, I tell them of my ""wolf"" concern. Some said they would not chance it, others said they would keep them leashed. Last year our dog ,black lab, took off and was gone for about 2 hrs. My husband went out in the boat, after tracking on land, and found her about 1 mile from camp. She ran down the hill, jumped in the boat, and shook for a couple of hours. Who knows what she encountered. To conclude, I have said yes, let's give it a try, there's good dogs, good kids, and happy drunks that go to bed early. If there's a problem, your dog/you/kids are not welcomed back. We can weed them out. For anyone that has been bothered, I can only try and make your stay better by getting on top of the issues RIGHT AWAY! I'm not shy, so I think we can nip it in the butt before it's out of hand. Again thank you and keep your thoughts coming...Rose"
571612,BK,2008-02-23 12:14:00,30,"I wouldn't go to a camp that didn't allow either kids or dogs. Just like with men, women, camp owners and everyone else, there are most good and some bad."
571613,Flip Silverlake,2008-02-23 12:32:00,645,Dogs are ok in camp as long as they are leashed and you take them with you everywhere you go. Don't leave a barking dog in a cabin all day when your out fishing or golfing or catching rays on the dock. If i want to listen to a barking dog I can stay home. I have a dog. She was leashed all the time and was with us every minute of the day. If we were fishing she was in the boat. If we went to town she was in the car.
571615,Guest,2008-02-23 13:28:00,0,">Here again, I have another question, does your resort owner >allow you to bring a dog to camp? > >We love dogs, and have a black lab, but what are other resort >owners doing? In the literature I've checked into, some state >no pets, but some don't mention it. We have been going to the same camp since 1993. We have 2 Labs. We don't go to places that don't allow us to take our dogs. Period. Our dogs are our family. We do clean up after them. They are not on leashes, but have been very well trained. We get TONS of compliments every where we go on how well behaved they are. I can understand someone not liking dogs or being afraid of big dogs. On the other hand, like the prior posts said, drunks and kids cause darn near all of the problems that we have seen in camp. In the 25 (yup, 25!) trips I have made to that camp in the past 15 years, I have never seen a problem caused by a dog. I have seen plenty of problems caused by 2-legged curs, big and small."
571618,skindzier,2008-02-23 16:33:00,137,I wouldn't go to a camp that didn't allow dogs. We're responsible in regard to the dogs & they have as much fun as we do. (We sat at a rather rustic launch on Eagle watching them chase frogs for half an hour once - it was an absolute hoot!)
571620,Guest,2008-02-24 07:52:00,0,Watched the dog a few cabins down from ours take a sh-t in the volleyball court every morning as its owner watched and never made an effort to take the dog out back or clean up after it. You make the call.You could set your watch by it.

Don't tar and feather all dog owners because one dog owner was irresponsible."
571631,Guest,2008-02-25 08:23:00,0,"Rose: As a new camp owner, I would recommend that you allow pets. Maybe with the stipulation they be on a leash and kenneled at night. I am not a dog owner, but i can guarantee you this....there are a h**l of lot people out there that do and consider their dog not as a pet, but family! And would not consider going to a resort that does not allow bringing lassie along. My observation has been that 99% of dogs people bring to camp are very well mannered and highly trained. Remember most sane people are not going to drive 15 hours with a whinning, barking dog and if they do, take lassie for a boat ride and a couple hundred yard from shore put the dog nicely in the water and leave, it will enjoy the swim back to camp and sleep like a baby."
571633,Guest,2008-02-25 08:38:00,0,"Nothing against dogs or kids,but we look for camps that are unlikely to have either.In fact we come to canada either early in the season or at the end of September to try to limit our exposure to other people in general. The seclusion,or fantasy of such is why we come to Canada."
571640,AllenW,2008-02-25 15:02:00,11482,"I would rather not see either, I've had kids jump into my boat, come into my tent and cabin and run around screaming, I've had to walk around dog do, listen to them bark at all hours of the night and wonder if that dog running up to me was gonna bite or jump on me with muddy paws. Drunks aren't any better either, but I used to be one so I'm a little more tolerant, but very little..:) Little tongue in cheek here btw...:) Yes I know there's lots of good ones out there, but I'd hate to drive for 12 hours to find the one bad one. If I owned a resort I wouldn't care if any of the above showed up, but they'd be there with the fact that if they're little Bobby or Spike continues to bother people, you can pack up and leave. Same for the drunks, 10-10:30 is late enough, after that no more. I don't have kids, but the dog gets to put up with my SIL who stays at the house when we're gone, its only a week and I'd rather not take the chance that someone would find our hyper German Short hair anoying...which they prob would. :) Try it for a year Rose and see what happens, I'd make sure everybody knew there were rules to follow though. Al"
571641,Goldeneagle,2008-02-25 18:57:00,78,Drunks don't add anything to camp. Dogs keep bears away.
571596,Guest,2008-02-22 22:23:00,0,"Here again, I have another question, does your resort owner allow you to bring a dog to camp?

Thank you in advance for your comments."
571598,Guest,2008-02-23 05:48:00,0,"My opinion is that camp guests should leave their dogs at home or if they must bring them to camp, that they are on a leash or in their kennel all of the time. For a person who does not like dogs, it scares me when a big dog comes running at me. Of course the dog owner says that their dog would never bite me, but it scares me anyway. I do not like to always be looking over my shoulder to see if the dogs are around and loose."
571599,Obabikon,2008-02-23 06:21:00,2370,"I have a chocolate lab and a cavapoo... pets are definately welcome. It's convenient being on an island, because they don't have to worry about getting lost. If your dog is overly energetic or has some type of behavior problem... he/she will need to stay in the cabin or leashed."
571600,Ogoki,2008-02-23 06:28:00,291,"As ususal the majority rule. Many people do not keep there dogs quiet, their dog on a leash , pick up after their dog, and from chewing on things. I have been in a camp once where I would have rather been around a dog than kids. Screaming , yelling , running up on our porch after we has went to bed , throwing things , leaving bikes in the driveway to the cabins etc. So it can be both ways ........We were not priviledged in life to have kids so we have labs. The one lab has been on 6 trips to Cananda. She is always on a leash at camp, I carry plastic grocery bags for her nature calls , and she is never left in the cabin alone to destroy anything. The only time she is loose is in the boat or on an uninhabited island . It can be good and bad to have kids or dogs in camp . We have seen it both ways ."
571601,Jimmy Jig,2008-02-23 08:12:00,1905,"My dog goes to Canada camp every year. I wouldn't stay in a camp that didn't allow dogs. Camp owner has a black lab and likes dogs. Several others also have dogs. Never had a problem with any of them. That being said, most of the problems in fish camp is fishermen, drunk, up half the night drinking and making alot of noise. Camp rules should read: DOGS WELCOME, DRUNKS NOT ALLOWED."
571602,Obabikon,2008-02-23 08:31:00,2370,">Camp rules should read: DOGS WELCOME, >DRUNKS NOT ALLOWED. How would we make a living? haha j/k You're both right, kids and drinkers can both be bigger problems than dogs. I also see it the other way... some guests may not like ""big dogs"". They have a fear just like some people don't like rock climbing. Either way, the camp owner needs to make this perfectly clear upfront. With no ""rule bending""."
571604,Pooch,2008-02-23 09:31:00,4619,"We used to fish a fly-in camp that we really liked until a guy gets off of the float plane with his two dogs. We left the cabin as they were coming in. His dogs immediately jumped onto the bunk I had used. The dog's owner said ""he always uses that bunk"". I was incredulous! Since this was a fly-in and new guests arrive on the planes that are taking the old guests out, there is little chance for the camp caretaker to check cabins. We had came into a really trashed cabin that trip and this was the last straw. The camp doesn't stay on top of leaving guests by making sure the cabin is clean and ready for the next group. A cleaning deposit would have helped them keep our group (actually groups, as we sometimes made two trips a year) for many more years. Spending the first couple hours of a trip cleaning dishes, fridge, sinks, stool and digging all of the non-burnable garbage out of the wood burner is not a great way to start a vacation. I made one more trip to that camp with my wife and that was it. Our group of eight switched camps and will never return because the camp owner and this self-centered pet owner thinks that is OK. Probably all camps have something that is distasteful if other guests only knew of what was happening in the cabins. Be it unwashed flatwear, bowls, drunks hurling and whatever else people do when they think nobody will see. I suppose that its not really different from motel rooms! Just a quick thought or rant depending on your point of view. I'm sure that camp owners are aware of these problems and I don't know the answer for them. So I guess my answer is ""no guest's dogs"" in camp. Most camps have a camp dog and most are quite territorial. The camp dog is usually a working dog keeping bears and other critters out of camp. Don't put the camp owner in a spot that he has to keep his dog in a cabin so you can bring your puppy with you. Yes, I'm a dog person, albeit one who thinks that a dog has it's place. Hope I've not messed up this thread. Pooch"
571607,Guest,2008-02-23 10:48:00,0,"My wife and I have no children and our dog is that replacement. The dog goes where we go period. We take our business and plan our vacations where the dog is welcomed. Yes, there are unresponsible dog owners just as there are unresponsible parents. We clean up after his nature calls, keep him on a leash and sweep out the cabin when we leave. Can guarantee that my dog is smarter and more obiedent than most childern we run into at camp not to mention the few drunks! We have never had any complaints from any business owners or guests. Fishing alone is boring and the dog NEVER complains!"
571608,Ogoki,2008-02-23 11:12:00,291,"This is real sick and a little off the topic of the thread subject. Since someone mentioned drunks in camp here goes. I just arrived at a camp and a group was leaving . As we stood on the porch of the cabin talking about fishing spots I noticed a plastic drink pitcher sitting on the picnic table. The fellow I was speaking with said "" oh by the way don't use this pitcher as our drunks in the group use it to whiz in so they don't have to go out the door and let bugs in while they are up all night drinking and playing cards "" . I have since never used a pitcher while at an outpost and of course always wash all the dishes and utinsels we plan to use ."
571610,rockpt,2008-02-23 11:20:00,589,"My dog made 18 trips to Canada with us until she died last fall. I wouldn't consider a camp that doesn't allow dogs. I agree that other guests or their kids can sometimes be far more obnoxious than any dog. There are camps that don't allow dogs and camps that do, and to each his own. I choose to be around dogs and people who like them."
