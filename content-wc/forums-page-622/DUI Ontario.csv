571584,Guest,2008-02-22 13:03:00,0,sounds like a good law. Our country could use some updating of penaltys.

The device prompts you to pull over and blow and it measures your alcohol content. If you are over it disables the vehicle. If you injure someone completely different story......"

571630,Guest,2008-02-25 08:11:00,0,There are still some that do not get the message. Our young OPP officers who are up and coming are of the new generation where drinking and driving was not OK . You will get no sympathy nor do you deserve any......

There is no tolerance any longer and there should not be. Just today, a 15 year old girl was killed by a drunk 17 year old driver. Good lord, 17 and drunk, driving a car!! That kid will never be the same and my heart goes out to the family of the victim."
