571549,jerry bark,2008-02-20 15:32:00,822,"the owner of the camp where i go will often take family groups out fishing in the evening on his pontoon boat, especially if they are not catching much. he also took one of my buddies to explore a portage lake he had not been to before. its got to be tough to find the time to do all the work, be on call 24/7 and take the guests fishing. how much can one guy, or gal, do?? i am happy that he keeps everything working and clean, i can find the fish on my own or be satisfied that i tried my best and the walleyes won that day. cheers, jerry"

By their own admission we most likely know the lakes and river system better than they do (at least for fishing the time period that we are there).To take them away from the work they need to accomplish would be counter productive for us both since they probably wouldn't be able to show us anything we don't all ready know"
571554,Guest,2008-02-21 06:52:00,0,I have asked several times but have never had an owner go out with us. Last year at a camp there was a cabin of newbys who were not catching antything. The owner jumped in their boat to put them on some fish. Classy. I personally do not think owning a resort would be that much fun....unless you are a workaholic.
571557,Bill Krejca,2008-02-21 08:00:00,6107,"At several resorts I've stayed at, we had one guy (not the same guy at both places)who maybe didn't do as well as the rest. In both cases, the owner took him out in the evening to give a little TLC. I thought it was a class act for the owner, and will be remembered for a long time by those in our party. Many owners seem to be pretty busy people who have limited time for anything other than camp maintenance, unless they have a large staff."
571530,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-02-19 16:43:00,116,"When we stayed on Cedar Lake, we made it a point to get the owners out on the Lake at least once. They really enjoyed it and we liked hearing their stories. Just curious...Rose"
571531,Oldschool,2008-02-19 17:09:00,163,"Yes, we did once. Most always they are so busy that they just can't get away. Other times, I think it takes a familiarity that develops over some time to get them to be comfortable in the presence of guests. It can be difficult for some people to deal professionally with guests if they have a personal association. I am not saying that this should happen, but one camp owner told me that it can be hard to show some perceived 'favoritism' to one set of guests without giving the same attention to the others. I don't think it's that big an issue, but they were concerned. So I can see both sides. From the guest standpoint, I would love to spend some time with the owners. I very much enjoy the Canadian relationship and learn a great deal from the simple, relaxed fishing conversation."
571532,Guest,2008-02-19 17:26:00,0,"We've never taken the resort owner fishing,though he does find time to get out several times during the season..One day during the trip we have an in-cabin fish fry for our group of 16..we always invite the owners, their daughter and the two dock kids to join us and they always do..this is also on Cedar Lake"
571537,freespoolin,2008-02-19 21:41:00,472,No we don't take them fishing but bring them some fish which they appreciate.
571539,Obabikon,2008-02-20 07:16:00,2370,"I'll guide every now and then. But, as stated before, it can be tough/impossible to get away."
571541,AllenW,2008-02-20 08:30:00,11482,"We've asked but most refuse, not enough time is the reason we hear mostly. Did have one go with us years ago at Eagle Lake when fishing was very poor, July, no wind, no clouds, very high humid and close to if not over a 100 degree's temp, nothing was biting. Give him credit, we tried for over 4 hours with little success and he was willing to go longer, we told him a cold beer sounded better and went in, he wouldn't even take the tip we offered, nice guy. We did leave him a good sized tip at the end of our stay, tipping someone like that is a pleasure. Al"
571542,Pooch,2008-02-20 08:35:00,4619,"The caretaker at one camp we fish has his grandson with him all summer. When we are in camp I really enjoy fishing several evenings with the grandson. He is an excellent jig fisherman and I like to troll, so we both learn something. Grandpa is usually too busy around camp to get out a lot. Grandpa and grandson are great outdoors man and have a lot to share with us part timers. What a great way for a young man to spend his summers.https://www.walleyecentral.com/photop...&ppuser=104366 Pooch"
571543,Guest,2008-02-20 08:40:00,0,"Allen Had a similar experience on Cedar Lake in Perrault Falls about 15 yrs ago..the lodge owner at the time was in his 60's..we had the same type of weather conditions you mentioned but it was in June..nothing was biting on the lake at all. The owner said he would take us to a lake that can only be accessed thru a narrow river system..we headed out the next morning with him in the lead..I had a trip odometer on the locater I had at the time..it seemed like we would never get there..about half way thru, it started pouring rain and I mean pouring..but he didnt turn back..he got us to this little lake after what turned into a 32 mile trip...the walleye fishing was great..nothing big but we all had limits, (12 of us) in a matter of an hour..it had stopped raining so we stayed and fished more and he headed back...there are new owners now at the lodge and unfortunately the old guy has since passed away but Ill never forget how he went out of his way to get us on fish that day.."
571544,AllenW,2008-02-20 10:14:00,11482,"Glenman12, what impressed us was we didn't say anything bad about our fishing or complain, we came in for lunch and as we walked by he asked how it was going, we replied slow..very slow, and mentioned the weather wasn't helping. After we got done with lunch, we were headed back out and he came down and asked if he could go out with us. He really tried to get us some fish, poor guy felt bad about it. THAT was a resort owner that cared, we had never been there before and his business seemed busy enough so he wasn't trying to drum up more business...always a pleasure to stay at places like that. Al"
571546,JDP,2008-02-20 11:40:00,1457,"Rose, Last October I had the opportunity to fish with my camp owner in my boat. Sure it helps to have someone in the boat with intimate knowledge of the lake, but the highlight for me was I thoroughly enjoyed his company and companionship. I hope to be able to do it again! JDP :cheers:"
