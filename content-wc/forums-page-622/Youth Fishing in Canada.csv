571533,Guest,2008-02-19 19:13:00,0,"I am one of the owners of Silsby lake Lodge in Manitoba 500 miles north of Winnipeg. I run the US office and only go up twice a year (my partner runs the operational side of the business) and I started taking my son up two years ago at the age of 11. He has fallen in love with the whole concept and can't wait to go every year. The time we spend together is absolutely priceless. He will remember these trips all of his life and so will I. I have taught him to run the boat, fillet fish, make sure luch, gas boats etc etc...I have been so inspired seeing him do this that I created a father son week and will take kids under 16 for $300.00 full American plan (Normal cost is $2900.00 for 1 week) if they come with two adults and fish in one 18 foot boat with the guide. As lodge operators I feel we have a responsibility to promote fishing with our youth and I take that responsibility very seriously. It gets them out of the house and away from video games and teaches them so much. Please take your kids at an early age up north to any lodge and you will find that they and you will have the greatest times of your lives!!! If any other lodge operators read this, please do what you can to make it possible for your guests to do this. You will feel so good to have the kids in your camp!!! They are our future."
571535,Matches,2008-02-19 19:22:00,236,"The Headline of the Sunday St. Paul Pioneer Press had an article about this very subject. Studies show an increasing segment of Minnesotans - those ages 19 to 44 - no longer get outdoors to enjoy state parks or trails. They don't go fishing or hiking. And they are not introducing their children to those outdoor activities. The reason? Young adults and their children lead strictly scheduled lives where other activities - sports, computer games and electronic gadgets - dominate their leisure time. Also, a new study shows a segment of young Minnesotans don't have basic outdoors skills, like setting up a tent, and they're scared of being in the woods. Here's the link to the whole story http://www.twincities.com//ci_828037...twincities.com"
571559,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-02-21 10:32:00,116,"duffydog I feel the same, that's why I posted this. I'm not sure how other camp owners feel and I would like to hear from more of them on this subject. We did 8 shows so far this year and at the second, I started asking people if they are bringing kids and to those that said Yes, I offered a large discount. I'm glad to hear you're doing the same. The youth are our future!!!"
571565,Catman59,2008-02-21 17:22:00,345,"As I have stated before , my Canada trip is a family trip. My kids look forward to it as much as I do. My girls are 17 and 15 , my son is 12. Over the last 6 years they have become very good friends with the ""camp kids"".With the internet they talk nearly everyday. They look forward to the trip as much as I do. The camp is geared towards families and also has a family plan that is tough to beat. The girls fish when they feel like it and just hang out the rest of the time. My son fishes the whole day , sometimes 12 -15 hrs with me. He is a heck of an angler and continues to kick my butt. He finally got his Ontario Angler award last year for a Northern , so now he has to outdo himself.My wife also puts in a lot of time with me . My Dad always seemed too busy to fish , and I guess that is why I will continue to take my family until we can no longer make it work."
571627,Chris K,2008-02-25 01:06:00,278,"This is a little bit off topic, but if you do take your kids on trips to Canada, and are interested in sharing a very unique experience with them check out the following website:www.angleryoungangler.com It's a pretty neat concept where one adult fishes with two youths 17 and under in a one day fishing tournament, and introduces them to competitive sportfishing. There are close to 20 events accross Canada and the US Midwest. Check out the website and see what events are close to you. Chris K"
571375,Guest,2008-02-13 14:44:00,0,"Babamel2: I think the needed documentation is the same I take more kids, even though I am there father. Both my kids have a passport (not needed but the Border Patrol like to see it and what they like, I like) and a notorized letter from my wife (or the kids parents) stating where we will be staying, for what duration, and that I have permission. If you were the grandparent, I would have both the child's parents sign the letter and the have it notorized (sp?). Cheers... IA Walleye"
571376,Guest,2008-02-13 15:13:00,0,"We are taking my fishing partners 14 year old son with us this spring for his 1st trip.Both his father and I went on Western hunting trips with our dads (together...they were best friends too.) when we were 14.He loves to hunt and will sit in a deer blind longer than anyone in camp,so he has earned the opportunity to see what a week in Canada is all about. The first trip is on Dad and uncle Chef.Hopefully he will enjoy it as much as his dad and I have for the past 30 years.Hopefully we will have exposed him to enough outdoor adventures that he feels compelled to bring us along as he hits his prime and we are in need of a helping hand."
571383,Guest,2008-02-13 16:21:00,0,"Rose, good to hear from you again. I am definately bringing up my grandson later this summer after his baseball is done. I will stop in when I am up there in July. I decided that as soon as he was old enough to be able to drive the boat he was old enough to sit all day and fish, and I was right. Last year he did great and wanted more, precisely what I was going for. But I wanted him to realize that this trip was a privaledge, not a birthright, just like I did with his father. This makes the trip very special for us, can't wait for the water to soften."
571392,Guest,2008-02-13 18:36:00,0,"Started taking my son when he was 9. Have gone at least once a year since. He is now 15. When our week comes, all sports and summer jobs get put aside and we go with our group, no questions asked.....When he quits going...I quit going. Life's to short. JohnB.O.A.T."
571402,Tonyo,2008-02-14 06:13:00,212,"I have 3 boys 19, 18, and 8. I have taken the 2 oldest boys a few time when they were 12 and 13 and again a year later. They both have enjoyed the trips but are busy with work and basketball and would rather stay home. The youngest will join us next year for his first trip. He will have no trouble fishing for a week. He and I fish now and he has no trouble sitting in the boat and I have no trouble baiting, taking fish off or motoring in to get his snags out. I can't wait until next year when he will go with us."
571404,Guest,2008-02-14 07:04:00,0,"Tonyo. Better make sure you tell your little guy about the slippery rocks and to be carefull getting out of the boat during shore lunch. I once saw this guy get out of his boat, and hit his A$$ on this huge rock like a sack of patoes!..............Oh, wait, you were there too.... See you the end of May! I'll have the beer cold. JohnB.O.A.T."
571410,Guest,2008-02-14 12:05:00,0,"Rose, This year will be the tenth year I have taken my son to Canada. He will be fifteen in August, so he started at an early age. I wondered if he was too young the first year until he cried when it was time to come home, then I knew he was ready for more. The first two or three years we went for a week at a time but that didn't seem to be enough so we switched to two week stays. For the last couple of years (and this coming year) we have added a one week trip in August. I really think every kid is different, some aren't ready at fifteen and some may never enjoy the trip. I am lucky in the fact that my wife also goes on the trip. If my son wants to sleep late a morning or two, no problem, I come back to camp for lunch and we all go out in the afternoon. I remember the first few years we actually planned which camp we went to by whether or not they offered reduced plans for kids. That really makes a difference when the price for three people is coming from one income. So Rose, I would say cost really does come into play when clients are planning trips with their children or grandchildren. The cost of a typical weeks stay at a camp is lot to spend if you are not sure the youngster will enjoy the trip. Where I am from (central Kansas), I know there are a lot of people that would love to take their family on a fishing trip to Canada but, unfortunately, they simply can't afford it. As I have learned over the past ten years, you can put a price on a Canadian fishing trip but you can't put a value on it! Steve"
571411,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-02-14 12:56:00,116,"Steve, I was wondering if the number 1 reason was cost or lack of interest. I'm sure it's a bit of both, but what a shame if cost is the main factor. If you wouldn't mind, I have an off the air question and would appreciate it if you would send me an e-mail. I'm concerned about the people who can't afford taking the kids. [email protected]"
571438,jerry bark,2008-02-16 06:22:00,822,"Rose, i'll respond to cost. My friend and i took our boys last year for the first time. the cost at our camp for a child under 16 was $112.50. so i doubt the cost of taking one child is an issue. However the cost of the whole trip may be. I also feel that fishing interest is declining amongst young people. there are so many sports and other kids activities that compete for a child's time these days that finding time for fishing with dad is not like it was when i was a kid. cheers jerry"
571480,bpetersen,2008-02-17 21:48:00,251,"Hi Rose, Glad to see you on-line again. Did you get over your illness o.k.? Omaha must have been tough on you. Here is something to consider with your new camp. When I felt my kids were old enough to stay in a boat all day. I looked for camps that offered a discount in price for kids. I know there are many people that don't think the cost is an issue but for this family man, it was. The trouble is some parents are clueless about putting kids in a boat for 8 to 12 hours or more. I started taking the kids when they were going to start Junior High School. When they graduated from high school. It was up to them to start paying for there own way. My kids have to pay for their own college. They have to decide if they can afford to miss summer work for a week and pay for the trip. So far, they have made the right choice. They will go again when they graduate. Sorry, a little off the subject. Try to have something in camp for the family such as free popcorn, pool (not swimming), darts, movie and book library. I know you have a great beach area. Put one of those floating islands off shore. Fishing tournament for the kids each week. Just brainstorming here, maybe a little message on your website to educate parents that don't have a clue about putting there kid in a boat all day. It would have to be put gracefully to have dad do shore lunches to break up the day, bring a video game, put small tarp in the boat so the little anglers can take naps on a dry surface. I have been to many camps with many families in camp. Sorry, this is very random. Hope you get the idea. Let me know if you try the Cliff Lake Beans on your clients. Pete"
571354,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-02-12 22:10:00,116,I'm just curious how many groups are taking young teens fishing? After doing many shows I've noticed that the general age is not young adults and teens. Are the young adults and teens just not interested? Is it too expensive to take them? Should we be taking steps to entice them? I would really like to hear your thoughts on this question because the future of Canada fishing is depending on future generations. Any feedback would be appreciated...Rose
571355,Guest,2008-02-13 01:08:00,0,"I grew up in Chicago,my dad would take me fishing,perch,smelt,coho on the lake catfish,carp in the rivers panfish in the forest preserves.We went fishing whenever we could for what ever was biteing.Now my son plays basketball Tues. Thurs. Sat.Sun. Wed. he has practice for his travel league baseball. 35 games mininum during the summer not counting tournements in Wisc. Mich. and Mrytle Beach.We are to busy with sports comitments to go on weekend get aways.He will be going to Canada with us next year(15 years old is the youngest we will take with us).He hears the stories and sees the pictures and is dying to go ""with the guys"".I hope he will get the Canadian fever like his old man and has his own stories to tell.But for now it's sports and girls. Terry"
571356,Skylane,2008-02-13 04:59:00,101,"Rose, I would guess that with less fishing pressure from future generations, the fishing would only get better. The difference would probably be more noticed by those in the tourist trade."
571357,REG,2008-02-13 05:20:00,445,"Rose I've been taking my oldest 2 (girl and boy) to Canada every year since they were (I think) 10 and 12. This year they will be 16 and 18. But I also go with another guy who brings his kids who are about the same age. My parents took my brother and I every year since we were born on our trips to N Wisconsin. And when we were around 10-12, we started making the trip with some of our cousins who were about our age - I think it helps to have other kids along. I really believe that you're missing out on some great years if you wait until they're teens to bring them. They've always looked forward to the trip to Canada. We bring the TV/DVD player for the car time and for the cabin when weather is bad or when they need a break. I don't go out and stay out like when it was just the guys fishing but we still catch plenty of fish. We alter the menu a little bit for them and sleep later in the morning but it's worth changing our routine so they'll have a good time. I thought 10 was a little young, but last year we took my youngest girl who turned 8 the week we were up and she did great - she'll tell you that she caught 5 walleyes the first afternoon. She is looking forward to going again this year. You'll need some extra patience that week - they can't go a whole week without a few moods - and your fishing time will suffer because you will be doing a lot more baiting and taking fish off and getting snags out, etc. - especially when they're younger. But overall I'm always glad that I've taken them and it gives us all something to look forward to every spring. Rich"
571358,Guest,2008-02-13 06:16:00,0,"I have two kids (12 and 15), every year one of them gets to go to Canada, with myself and their grandfather. We don't take both because (a) the cost; (b) four people in a boat is one too many (including the guide); and (c) they fight. They have been going since they were nine. One is a boy and the other is a girl and they both love Canada. Hopefully they will take me when I am older and need of a stronger hand to help in the boat. Cheers...IA Walleye"
571359,Obabikon,2008-02-13 06:18:00,2370,"Last year, I had a group that brought up an 8 year old boy. His name was AJ, and he was dedicated. Had no problem fishing 8 hours, and still wanted more. Never stopped fishing, and sat in the bottom of the boat. The most impressive thing was he used a baitcaster."
571360,Guest,2008-02-13 07:38:00,0,I've noticed the same. I started taking my son when he was 13 and this will be his fifth year. He plays tournament baseball and has summer football comitments but I just said enough and we decided to miss a weekend tournament to get a trip in. Other parents thought I was crazy to do it but he or I would not give it up for anything. He also has friends who have fathers that tourney fish often. I have tried to get them to come with us on a trip but they are too wrapped up in the tourney fishing. The boys are the ones that suffer. I spoke to the owner of my camp about this and he warned me about this saying he had a group of fathers and sons come up one year. The fathers who were fishing buddies would go out together and leave the sons back at camp most of the time. I guess some people are not cut out to be parents.
571363,Guest,2008-02-13 09:50:00,0,"I have been taking fishing vacation as long as I can remember as a child and now go with my father. I have grandchildren that I have not taken yet,but will. I have a 3yr old that LOVES to fish on the pond but his attention span is a couple hours tops. We have taken our grandkids on trips(non fishing) since they were old enough to walk and they work best(for us)because when we take them the trip is about them and not us. I think the same would apply to taking them on a Canadian trip as well. Is cost a factor,of course and available time off of work is a factor too. The other thing I ""worry"" about in taking them to Canada is how to keep them interested when not fishing as there is not much else in the area? Maybe kids week or some type of program that involves them the week they are there(biggest fish wins a hat) or posting their pics in camp or on the website? Somehow though we must keep them involved."
571365,Guest,2008-02-13 10:01:00,0,"Have any of you taken your grandkids along to Canada (without the parents). If so, what kind of documentation is needed and what was your experience at the boarder?"
571369,itry,2008-02-13 11:32:00,78,Took my oldest up 3 times. He loves it. Unfortunately it spoiled him for fishing around here. He thinks you're supposed to catch fish constantly like we do in Canada. I will take my youngest as soon as I can. Unfortunately my cost of living has gone up more than my wages have so it will have to wait a year or two.
