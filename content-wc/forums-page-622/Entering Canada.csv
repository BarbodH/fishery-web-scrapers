571705,Guest,2008-02-26 10:56:00,0,"First off it is a wet careless, pretty big difference in the eyes of the law. Secondly, it's not really called a wet anything it is just referred that way. As a seasoned vet who went through the process you get to know the rules pretty quickly. There are two sides to a DWI or a Wet Careless. First, you have the criminal part which is pretty self explanatory. Secondly, there is the civil side in which they decide your penalty for your driving privileges. What happened in my case is I lost my Civil suit, but got my criminal reduced to careless driving. So if you run my criminal record it just shows a careless driving. However, if you run my driving record it shows that it was alcohol related. Pretty complicated, but that is the long and short of it. I'm really surprised that someone hasn't actually responded who went through the process. I heard a rumor, and it may just be a rumor, but when they had the PWT up there last year they waved some of this crap because there were too many guys who had DWI's. If true, I find that kind of funny."

571706,Guest,2008-02-26 14:50:00,0,It'll be real easy in a year or so to track DUIs. You guys need passports to get back to your country. Our Canadian guys swipe a passport and the strip gives all the information. It can then be easilly checked. As well with our strong dollar and low US border traffic the guards have lots of time. For us Canadians the fishing just keeps getting better......

571707,Guest,2008-02-26 15:54:00,0,"So with a weak dollar the ""guards have plenty of time"". I never got the impression they were in a hurry no matter how many cars were backed up on either side. May be if they were paid by the car that instead of by the hour things would be speedier."

571696,Guest,2008-02-25 11:12:00,0,"Anyone know the laws for entering Canada with a DWI. I've heard all kinds of different angles from you can't enter period, to it costs some money and heartache, to it's not a big problem. Also, I don't personally have a DWI, but a careless driving that was alcohol related. My understanding is that a DWI is a felony and that is why you can't enter, but that a wet careless is not a felony so is not a problem. Anyone have any experience with this or insight?"
571697,Guest,2008-02-25 11:20:00,0,Nope thats never been discussed here. I would really be interested in what you hear about this new topic. And while your at it how about potatoes?
571698,jigman 2003,2008-02-25 13:44:00,981,"Haven't heard of such a rule. If I had a DUI I'd just go to Canada and lie to the border guards. They'd never know anyway. Stupid foreign country should just follow our rules. Who do they think they are anyway? Go to the ""Canada, Eh?"" forum and do a search. You'll get all the info. you ever wanted and more."
571700,Dacotah Eye,2008-02-25 13:44:00,2722,"http://www.tiac-aitc.ca/english/customsandborders.asp This should answer questions about crossing with a DUI and other subjects if ya don't mind a bit so surfing. I don't think a wet careless would affect you as it isn't a DUI conviction. The last I heard, raw potatoes are a no no when crossing the border. We used to boil ours for hashbrowns and they were ok. I hear it's best to buy raw potatoes in Canada. :cheers:"
571701,Guest,2008-02-25 14:31:00,0,"Yeah, I've read all of the stuff posted under Canada, as well as surfed the web, but wanted to hear from someone who maybe has experienced actually crossing the border to see what they did. It seems according to all these websites you have to jump through 72 hoops to get there. As much as I like monster bucks and pig walleyes it just doesn't seem worth some of the hassle. However, if someone has some insight to what they did to get across that may make it easier I am all ears. Drinking and Driving is a stupid mistake, but seriously on some of the things they say you have to do. It's ridiculous! If getting court documents, files, and letters is what I have to do to cross then I guess I'll take my money elsewhere, where it's appreciated. Instead of punishing someone to the nth degree for a past mistake that they've learned from why not make a law that says you will spend a year in jail if busted while your in there country or something. I think that would be a lot more effective yet get more tourists to visit. Let's face it, a lot of people in this world have DWI's, especially outdoorsmen who like to have a few cocktails after a day on the water or in the woods. Most of us learn from these mistakes, and don't need to be repeatedly punished for them. Wow, sorry for the rambling, but just my $.02"

More than one DWI can get to be a real mess and I would stay home. You will find out on the ""Canada eh?"" part of the forum that the Canadian people jump through just as many hoops when they come down here as we do going up there. I didn't realize this until I read some of their posts."
