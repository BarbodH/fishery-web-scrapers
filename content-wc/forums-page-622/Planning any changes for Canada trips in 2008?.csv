571571,Ogoki,2008-02-22 07:54:00,291,"Jigman , Going to try something a little different this year . Been to Ogoki 9 times so we are going to Auger this year . Also we are taking both labs (Ogoki and Mojikit ,labs names) so we thought might be better to be away from other people as not all people like dogs at camp. We took both of them last year on the bear hunt and they did great in the boat. You better try a bear hunt with us some year . Fish and pick blueberries in the mornings and bear hunt in the evenings . We go with a first class bear guide . He also works some for MLO. Keep in touch !"
571628,jigman 2003,2008-02-25 07:10:00,981,"Sounds great, I'd love to have a bear rug. Doubt if the wife would agree though ;-) I agree with you 100% on the dogs vs. kids. Dogs (like kids I suppose) are a product of their enviroment. If the owners (parents?) are lax in training, the result is not good. Let me know how Auger is. Someday I'd like to do Auger, Bellsmith, and Guerin. I'm going with a buddy to Blackbirch with Northern Outposts this year. My groups completely fell apart so I was lucky to find a group to hook up with."
571658,Guest,2008-02-26 10:46:00,0,Our group is doing the same thing. Fishing Kabby. Been 30yrs since I fished Kabby and Nama.Reports I've gotten tells me that both lakes have vast improvement in catch. Feel sorry for some of the Canadian camp owners as the financial impact has got to hurt. US and Canadian customs have also become a headache. However necessary.:cheers:
571663,thunderatwork,2008-02-26 13:33:00,79,"for the last two years it was two father-son couples as my group. this year my 19 year old son decided he would not go, He would rather chase girls. so keeping up with the father son deal, my 79 yearold dad is going with. we are still two father son couples. It will be fun fishing with my dad. However i'm sure their will be some challenges as he is older. At least he will pay his own way as opposed to me paying my son's way. Other changes- more gulp, less minnows.they all die after three days anyway."
571427,EricS,2008-02-15 12:16:00,20,I am going off on a new adventure this year.......instead of flying out of Sioux Lookout to Gull Lake on the cat river chain we are flying out to Root Bay on the west end of Lake St. Joesph.......last week in sept.
571430,JDP,2008-02-15 15:43:00,1457,"Pooch, Here is what I do: For our annual trip consisting of 8-9 guys I have created a process that seems to work: 1) In September I send letters with pertinent information regarding next year's trip (dates,resort info,estimated cost, etc) to anyone who has participated in the past or who has shown even casual interest. I encourage guys to bring along others that may be interested. I indicate an October meeting will be held (of about 1-2 hours at a local watering hole) where we will review the information. I also indicate that those that participated last year have the ""first right of refusal"" and are ""penciled in"" and will be asked to inform the group of their intentions at the meeting. If someone is unable to attend the meeting they can call me regarding their intentions to participate. Before the meeting, I can guarantee returning participants a spot. But I cannot guarantee a spot a new participant before the meeting. 2) At the meeting I confirm the decisions of the guys with the ""right of first refusal"". Then work to fill out the group. I inform everyone that a $200 deposit per person is required by December 1st. The depossit is necessary to show committment. The deposit can be refunded only due to serious issues like health, employment status, etc.--- I have yet to refund a deposit. 4) After the meeting I again e-mail everyone and provide a status of the trip. Again I state the requirement for the $200 deposit by December 1st. 3) Should a deposit not be recieved by December 1st, it is understood that a replacement will be sought for that spot. 4) The goal is to have all deposits for the group in place by Jan.1. then I make the deposit at the All Canada Show in early Jan. 5) I also hold a meeting in April for menu planning, driving itenarary, cabin responsibilities, etc. This has worked very well for our group. JDP :cheers:"
571439,Guest,2008-02-16 07:00:00,0,"Hey JDP, Sounds like you have a pretty good system in place and looks like it works well for you. We too have a good size group that goes up to Canada every other year. Anywhere from 8-15 people. Luckily the camp we go to works hard to accomidate our group no matter the size. Of course we give them plenty of notice (usually Sept of the prior year) We work together to insure dates will work out. We let everyone know about our intensions for the upcoming trip to get a feel for who might want to go and let them know they can feel free to bring a guest(s) if they like. As usual, there are new guests who say they want to go and us old timers get a smile on our faces, since we know that 90% of these newbees will cop out once we ask for the deposit. Deposits are required in December so they can be given to the Camp by January. Every trip someone for one reason or another can't go so the group may shrink or grow depending on newbees. We always welcome back anyone who has gone with us in the past (as long as they didn't cause a major problem). Luckily that only happend one time over the 30 years we have been going. All in all, it's worth the headaches since we have a great place we go to every year. One person mentioned it's world class fishing and we are lucky to also get world class service. Have a great fishing season everyone! Wingmann17"
571502,Guest,2008-02-18 15:42:00,0,"Chiming in on the thread. I am making a fundamental change in our canada trip this year. I have been going to the winnipeg river chain for about 8 years now and have enjoyed every second of every trip.I have taken my father, brother and uncles on this trip over the years. My two sons are now getting to the age where i will be taking them soon and hence the change. The change is i am trying this year for the first year a housekeeping package instead of the full american plan. I can see clearly that i cannot afford the future paying for my family on the american plan. Im trying it on my father and brother this year and trying to set in motion the process for i hope years to come. we did choose to switch camps which im alittle nervous about because ""my"" lodge for the last years has been awesome to me but the finances wont let me keep going there and when i looked into what was offered nearby i have to take the plunge this year and check it out. Dad's a little askeeert that he wont get enough to eat and brothers worried about who does the dishes buti reiterated that its the same thing we do a deer camp!! after i said that it did occur to me that i pretty much do the cooking and dishes!! if i didnt make the plane reservations, lodge reservations, etc etc i dont think they would but sure do appreciate it while they are reeling in those awesome fish..and by the way, i do take off all their fish too!!!!! good fishing and wish us good luck!"

571553,fourize,2008-02-21 06:36:00,287,My Dad and I are going to the same place we've been going to the last 14 years. The only change is we're going July 12th thru the 26th instead of beginning of June. Owners son is getting married July 19th and we're invited to the wedding. Our first Canadian wedding...still trying to talk them into getting married at the outpost camp...lol!
571568,Ogoki,2008-02-22 05:34:00,291,"I have two trips planned with my wife for this summer . One is a fly-in with Mattice Lake Outfitter and I could not do without my bear hunt either . Don't get me wrong I really enjoy going with my wife . I use to do a trip with the guys and one with my wife . The trip the guys fell apart because of the cost . Kids in college , one guy divorced and he has too much going out and not enough for a trip anymore , etc. etc. ..........I ran into a fellow from church and he said none of his group was going anymore either. He said in his case he has $2000 a month pension and he could not spend $1200 to $1400 of it on one trip for him and leave his wife at home. In the early 90's there were over 50 people from our town going to Armstrong every year . As far as I know now there is only my wife and myself...... Most of the guys that I know are not going because of the money . Many of them are going to Boundry Waters and canoing and camping. Many are on pensions and can't afford it. Like one outfitter told me since the 90's many changes have accured in is customer base . At one time he had a strong farmer clientel now that has changed . He said the vast majority of his customers were from 45 to 65 years old . Many self-employed and the majority two income families that were doing well. Not many young people either except a few that came with their fathers.Things change."

571391,Guest,2008-02-13 18:36:00,0,"yeah. probably the last one. age, can't get younger trippers ($$) this year ?? gas up getting off the wall exchange rate ? wipes us out from the last year 2001. been up since 1960. guess this is the end - a sad thing taxes taxes taxes...........it may pay CA's health care but it'll stop us in the future. like it or not.......taxes will always destroy business. simple fact as i listen to this far waddling business suited woman candidate i see very clearly that my canada days are done. but its been fun. its been a fishing romance. i cant believe it's over. if you're an old or moderate lodge owner...sell. hope we have a good trip this summer ss"
571409,Guest,2008-02-14 11:43:00,0,"Unfortunately I won't be going this year after almost 10 years in a row. Can not get anyone to go anymore. To much money, getting older, general success on Lac Seul seems to be changing. I'll truely miss going and do hope last year wasn't the last time. I can certainly still afford to go, but the trip has become a little like lobster to me! I love lobster but I just don't buy it even though I can afford to do so because I just can't justify it in my somewhat oldfasioned conservative mind. May all of you that are going have a wonderful and succesful trip!!!"
571412,jigman 2003,2008-02-14 13:18:00,981,"Yep, I was almost in that boat too loco. My groups continually fall apart. Fortunately I was able to hook up with another group and didn't have to break my streak. I was about resigned to not going until this opportunity came up. Sorry to hear it and hope you get a functional group back together for next year."

571416,Ruddiger,2008-02-14 18:45:00,649,"Gentlemen, I know what you mean about having problems keeping a group together on a trip. I spend six weeks a year in Canada (Pigeon Lake in the Kawarthas) and spend the majority of that time fishing alone. Sometimes I can get my brother or wife to go (as well as a couple of friends on and off) but for the most part I fish alone for at least half of my trips. Thank God for my dog Sadie keeping me company, although it would be more fun if she barked less when I hook up with a good fish, and paid her share when it came time for a fill-up on gas. Take Care, Ruddiger"
571417,prov1900,2008-02-14 18:56:00,544,"Yeah, my dog is coming this trip too. For the first time in (too) many years, we have room for her."
571418,Guest,2008-02-14 19:11:00,0,sorry.
571421,Pooch,2008-02-15 06:23:00,4619,"Hopefully I'm not really changing the subject of this post, but you guys reminded me of something. I can relate to some of these different replies. Keeping a larger (more than four) group together can be a chore. Every year there is usually one guy or another that has a conflict and has to bail out. As long as they do it early and let the rest know it isn't a big deal. We seem to always have another guy who would like to join in. Then the question becomes, which one of these fellows has first call on that spot next year? The truly easiest trip each year is just my wife and myself. Although she did dump our Canadian trip in 2008 for a trip to NY with her old college room-mates. I then contacted part of an old original group for an extra ""boys"" trip that week. Everyone is happy. Not going because of money is a problem, but compared to wife's NY trip the fishing trip is a bargain. Another thought is that our group has lost several guys (not old geezers either!) over the years to death and that alone has truly made the rest of us aware that each trip we go on could also be our own last trip. Make every trip with your friend's count as we just don't know what's next. Leaving on the annual trip without one of your old friends is profoundly sobering. Good luck to everyone this year. Pooch"
571422,Guest,2008-02-15 06:56:00,0,"Pooch I was the originator of our trip to Cedar Lake in Perrault Falls some 22 years ago..it has grown from 4 guys all the way to 16 ..4 of those are a father, two sons and an uncle..they are pretty much on their own and just go up when we do..the other 12 has been somewhat of a problem in years past but we've been lucky..in 2005 we had 12..for 2006, we had two of the 12 back out but we were able to replace them..in 2007 only one of the 12 backed out and he was replaced..this year we had 3 back out and again we were able to replace them..at dinner on our last night I tell everyone that if they want, they are in for the following year..if you back out then you are out..I cant go by ifs or maybes..I dont always know the reason that guys back out but Ive never heard yet that it was due to money or the trip being too expensive. Usually its family contstraints that are non financial."
571308,Guest,2008-02-10 16:30:00,0,"Going with a group of 6 in early July to LS. All 6 piling into 1 vehicle and towing a trailer to save on fuel so 5 split the costs. Going lighter on the Steaks, more chicken and fish. Also bringing a flat of nightcrawlers and reducing the leech purchase. Then planning on taking my grandson back up in Aug for a long weekend, just the two of us. His grandmother was invited but she still thinks she will get stuck sitting in a boat all day and then have to cook and clean-up after. We'll let her believe that. HEhehehe"

After spending a week icefishing in the boonies of South Dakota this winter , I thought maybe we should take our family vacation out there instead. That was definitely a big NOT :badidea: when I brought it up. So off went the reservation to Canada and I am now counting down. It will cost more , but there is still no place that compares ...and even though the girls dont fish much , its obvious that its still our family vacation spot."

We aren't taking boats this year because the outfitter supplies them and the gas for only $30 per man per week. Have 4 new guys going on the trip because some of our older guys just can't make it this year. Looking forward to seeing those new faces light up on their first canadian adventure.
571345,Guest,2008-02-12 15:28:00,0,"we're in. but realistically one of the reasons we're going is that this will probably be it. been up since 1960 with dad. he passed years ago but i kept going taking up groups. but like the doors `this is the end' it's probably it. thought i had another 10 years in me but the cost just prevents younger go'ers from going. disney's a better deal. canada has priced itself out of the market. last time 2001 we got 1.45 on the dollar. there weren't rolling add-on taxes. there wasn't a 6% automatic price increase each year. yeah i understand. and then there's gas prices..................windmills dont get us up there sadly, end to a great fishing romance. hope it's a good one this summer ss"

571298,Goldeneagle,2008-02-09 08:39:00,78,Flying in May 16 and out May 31 or a couple of days later if there's a plane with an extra seat. Spending a week with a friend on LOTW later and then back up the last Saturday in July. Will do the annual fly-in in October to say my usual goodbye until the next spring. I'm more concerned with the out of control spending by my government and the Ponzi Scheme they're running as Social Security than I am with the rising cost of fishing in Ontario. 31 days on the water for me in 2007 in NW Ontario and expect to do more in 2008.
