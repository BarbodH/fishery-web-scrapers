G&S Marina at Rowan's Ravine is a great starting point. The easiest thing to do is just to go where all the shacks are! Seriously, they are there for a reason. It's been a while since I've done any ice fishing there, but in the past, jigging spoons or jigs tipped with worms or minnows were effective for walleye. Very light jigs with meal worms worked on the perch. Waxy"

But go to fishingsaskatchewan.ca and check out there froums lots of info there.I dont think G$Marine does ant Ice stuff. But could be wrong.
