571098,jigman 2003,2008-01-30 06:52:00,981,"I can give you info about MLO. Don, Annette, Yolanda, Jason and Austin run a top notch operation. I fished Vick, Pringle (3 years) and the Ogoki Reservoir (2 years) with them. I have nothing but good things to say about them, the fishing, and the accomodations. They are hands down the best outfitter I've used. I am no expert, but I do know what a ""bad"" outfitter is and how it can ruin your trip. Rest assured MLO will make your trip an enjoyable, worry free experience. I'd be happy to discuss the lakes I've fished with them or any further info. you'd like. Just email me. [email protected]"

571136,lobo1,2008-02-01 06:32:00,734,Went with MLO one time and they did a great job - I would go there again if I was considering a fly-in.
571145,deputy dog,2008-02-01 14:15:00,305,how was the fishing? any size to the pike if you caught any? any negatives? tryin to get as much info from guys who have been there. thanks!
571151,Stauff,2008-02-01 15:52:00,110,"We were there the week following July 4th. Unusually warm, and only one day of rain. Walleye AVERAGED 18 to 20"". A few were caught in the 25"" range, virtually all on either jigs or floating heads behind a 3/8 ounce sinker. Pike were mostly in the two to five pound range, but evening provided the largest fish. We would troll across a large point after dinner pulling bass cranks (that's all we had) and catch a few walleye & northerns everytime we crossed the point. My youngest son caught the largest (42"") on a chrome/black Big O crank - thought he was snagged at first!! Bring plenty of jigs, cause if you're not losing any, you're not fishing in the right place."
571152,lobo1,2008-02-01 15:58:00,734,"We went to Whitewater and the fishing was just average. Also there were more people using the lake than we are used to. This was our first try at going someplace where we weren't the only cabin and we didn't like it. Nothing against the outfitter tho - the service, camp, facilities, air, communications, billing and info - all top notch I would not hesitate to go to one of their private lakes - I have read and heard good things about them."
571780,NJDSO,2008-02-29 17:57:00,17,"I am Jim Saari, president and owner of Bushland Adventures. I own the permits on Lake Evans now. The previous negative posts were removed by Walleye central because the bankrupt owner of Bushman Outfitters/North American Bushman posted them to undermine my business. In fact they have used the trade names that I own in their websites only to post negative info about me. Sad but true. We are filing litigation proceedings against this gentleman. I believe Mirage Outfitters are also. I also run the Lac Clarkie and Kamwak camps in the Eastmain area as well as all of the Mirage Outfitters fishing,LG4, Roz, Rosee, Rossignol. I am also part owner of a caribou co. I have been in the business for over 30 years . I have countless ligitimate references. My website is : bushlandadventures.com.
