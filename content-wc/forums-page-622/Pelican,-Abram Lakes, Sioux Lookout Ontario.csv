571548,Guest,2008-02-20 13:50:00,0,We always stay in Sioux Lookout and trailer to Lac Seul (Deception Bay) each day of our stay. I heard some good reports regarding the fishing on Pelican last summer and I am wondering if it might be worth a try? Does anybody have any experience on these lakes and how the walleye fishing might compare to Lac Seul?

On bad weather days I can still guide my guests to a great day close to home. The local mnr has tagged fish in the english river(Minnitaki), and recorded them being caught not so long later way up Lac Seul. Fish constantly travel the entire system. In my life, I have never been skunked on the local lakes."

Have had good success on Deception Lake (little lake across from the Deception Bay turnoff), Minnitaki (caught a big ole burbot there one night jigging for walleyes)up by the narrows the best for walleyes that I found, Little Vermilion and Big Vermilion ( walleye scarce and non existent in Little Vermilion but good smallmouth bass and have caught lakers in big Vermilion along with decent pike). Also Sen Bay on Lac Seul, good walleye fishing there as well. Lots of lakes there to explore with good fishing."

571590,Guest,2008-02-22 14:56:00,0,Don't let Minnitaki turn into bumper boat fishing.
571595,prov1900,2008-02-22 21:07:00,544,"You are right, I made up the whole thing. Everyone go to Lac Seul, preferably the NE side."
571616,Guest,2008-02-23 15:25:00,0,"It is a hassle, but it saves us a lot of money. It is far cheaper to stay in Sioux Lookout than it is to stay at a lodge on Lac Seul."
571625,Guest,2008-02-24 18:08:00,0,"Fished this area for three years straight back in the early 90's. Had good success with Walleyes & Pike on the pickerel arm of Minnitaki in and around Butterfly and Lyonns Bay as well.Caught and Released my largest Northern 42""on Abrams just west of the chute. Also fished on Little Vermilion & connected lakes Maskinonge,Hooch & Cedarbough.It's an excellent SM Bass fishery for both numbers and size,large Northerns but fewer numbers and some Musky as well.We fished up on Pelican a couple times caught some ""eater size"" Walleyes and Northern.We've been up on Lac Suel the last few seasons north of Chamberlain Narrows and have done pretty well."
