571519,lacseulwalleyeguide,2008-02-19 12:22:00,32,"I just thought that i would remark on the various different thoughts on this issue. My experience and comments are based on the east side of Lac Seul, and a lot of time put into it. I also do know for a fact that this side has a lot less fishing pressure, more tributaries, wind protected areas, and spawning grounds. I do change my patterns from year to year based on water levels. The only difference is the fish in general spend a lot more time deeper than shallow. This could be due to the forage base such as increasing smelt populations as well. All in all, I do not see the future of Lac seul going downhill in any way. Even if the numbers of anglers increase, there still are tight regulations, and alot more catch and release fisherman these days, than there used to be. It would be nice to get more anglers targeting the insane population of whitefish(which consume walleye eggs), and take their numbers down a bit. Please bring your 25 whitefish home with you...feed the neighborhood...lol"

571522,Goldeneagle,2008-02-19 13:22:00,78,A good whitey population makes for lots of fat pike. I fried a whitefish once. Once was enough. Keep the nets away and walleye fishing will stay excellent in NW Ontario. Spent 31 days on the water up there in 2007 and will probably beat that in 2008. Weather conditions have messed with fishing the past 2 or 3 years. Can't blame lakes for that. The fish are still there.

571538,Guest,2008-02-19 22:43:00,0,"You try and have a serious conversation and there is always a joker or two.......very funny stuff tho. My boat partner caught what I believe was a Whitefish by accident a couple years ago. Got the thing in the boat and it crapped all over everything as it flopped around in the net. Man what a stink! It attracted every fly within a mile, spent the next hour on shore washing down the inside of the boat, my clothes, and gear. After all that, I wish I had known you could smoke the #### thing, I was out of cigars."
571567,Guest,2008-02-22 05:01:00,0,"I'll say right up front that I've never fished Lac Seul, but I was intrigued at the perception that fishing has declined recently...whether valid or not. My two cents is this: I beleive that when a slot limit is implemented, there is an increase in the amount of predator or gamefish in the system determined in part by the growth rate of the fish. Ie..if it takes seven years for a fish to grow up to 20"", then seven-to-ten years after the slot limit takes effect, there will be an abundance of 20"" fish. This may stress the system due to limited biomass in the prey population, making the fish very easy to catch. Eventually, the population reaches equilibration; this may involve the fish changing patterns to accomodate new food sources. Often, this phase is perceived as a decline in fishing success. That having been said, I'm not an expert, I don't know the growth rate of fish in Lac Seul, I don't even know when the slot limit went into effect. But I've seen enough instances of similar circumstances following implementation of a slot (which, by the way, I think is one of the best conservation measures going) that I figured I'd chime in here (with my uneducated opinion). Maybe it's overfishing, maybe there's some disease in the system (we're dealing with VHS now in New York), but maybe the fish have just reached a sustainable level and changed their patterns somewhat. Maybe. Gator PS. I'll be there for the first time in June. Leave some fish for me, please :)"

571243,Northern Eye,2008-02-06 20:10:00,22,"I would have to agree that something is changing in Lac Seul. I have only been fishing Lac Seul for 5 years but usually spend about 3-4 weeks a year on the Lake. 1-2 weeks of that is guiding and the other 1-2 weeks is fishing pretty hard 8-10 hours a day depending on weather. I normally fish the Ear Falls area but head down as far as Stony point with much time spent on Mackenzie Bay. What I have noticed: The first two years the fishing was incredible some of the best fishing I have had in my life, good numbers and good size. Then three years ago things started to slow down. We still caught good size fish but the numbers were decreasing. Now the last two years have shown noticeable decreases in numbers of all sizes, with last year being the toughest I have seen. Now we still caught fish and the biggest was 29 inches but definitely slower. I would be interested to hear other opinions but I think part may be due to increased pressure in certain areas and maybe had something to do with poor spawning about 5-6 years ago. Maybe some can remember the year that it warmed up then before May long, then we went into a deep freeze and ice returned to creeks when they were well on their way to spring freshet levels. This may have reduced successful spawning and we may now be seeing the results?? My two cents"
571255,Guest,2008-02-07 13:48:00,0,"I would like to echo Northern Eyes observations, it is exactly what we have experianced over the last 5 years. The only differance is that we have been fishing the Chamberland Narrows area of the lake. For the first time last year we took a short 3 day trip to the Ear Falls area around September 6-8. Never having fished this area we hired a guide for the first two days, who kept saying he was seeing lots of fish on the locator but they just weren't biting. Between the 3 of us we didn't catch a dozen walleyes all day. The second day with the guide also fishing we caught 25 to 30. The last day we again caught no more than a dozen. Five years ago and before 100 to 200 days were more the norm. Since then the fish in general seem to be more scattered and less concentrated in larger schools. Being that we fished a totally different area of the lake it certainly appears that whatever has happened affected the whole lake. You might also factor in the fishing pressure which in general is less in the Chamberlain area. Many ?????"
571281,Guest,2008-02-08 14:46:00,0,"i haven't had a really good trip since 2004. in fairness, i had 2 really hot weeks and 1 really cold one. could be just the luck of the draw, but i too believe something has happened. in all three of those weeks, i would have sporatic 4 hour periods similar to years gone by, but nothing consistant. in 2004, i would pick up and leave when i got into a large group of 16-17 inch fish because they were too small. i'm not really a very good walleye fisherman, but i seem to outperform most boats in camp pretty consistantly. like i said, it could just be my weeks, but i don't think so. our group isn't going up this year for the first time in about 10 years."
571284,Jigger1,2008-02-08 17:16:00,234,"My group has been fishing LacSeul the same week for the last eight years. I would categorize myself as the annual vacationer mentioned above who probably doesn't have enough information to make an educated post, however I do have my own opinion and I'm a data freak. The only thing our group has seen in the last two years that would indicate a change would be a possible decline in top end size. Our group who historically has been very fortunate to catch a good number of big fish has not had a good track record over the last two years. In fact our largest over the past two years is 27 which by most standards is still an awesome walleye. However we've not seen a decline in volume and with the exception of the two spectacular volume years of 2003 & 2005, the last two years have been rock solid. In fact 2007 ranks third and 2006 fourth behind 03 & 05 on a per person basis of walleye's landed over 18. My vacationer's viewpoint is that LacSeul continues to be a walleye factory with no slow down in sight. 132 days and counting!"
571306,Guest,2008-02-09 20:14:00,0,"Lac Seul is a great walleye fishery. Any of you Canadians heard of the band, RUSH! Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and the Professor on drums, Neil Pert, blow away Tom Petty any day of the week! Rush has been touring for months and if they come to a town near you,GO! Like Canadian fishing, Rush is the Lac Seul of any mega rock band! I'm from Chi. town and was fortunate to see them in Sept. 07, and have tickets for June 7,08. Then I'm off to Canada fishing. Can't wait for both! RR"
571503,Guest,2008-02-18 15:46:00,0,"18 years of fishing Lac Seul, always the first week in June. Without question the fishing is going down hill. Don't know whats better out there but after 18 years straight were going to try something new."
571513,Guest,2008-02-19 07:54:00,0,"Been fishing Lac Seul for 18 years. During that period we have seen a decline in Pike numbers but an increase in Pike size. Each of the last 4 years we have got Pike 41""/45"" range. Walleye fishing is still great for us. Numbers have been good and I would estimate that 40% of our Walleye are over the slot with 28""/29"" being caught every year. We go the second week of June and have had a few days in the last 5 years that the wind has made fishing difficult but overall Lac Seul is a awesome Walleye fishery. Our biggest bonus is the steady increase the last 7 years of the Smallmouth fishing. We Smallmouth fish some every day and the numbers and size have increased every year. Last year our biggest Smallmouth was 20"" with the majority being in the 15""/17"" range. We fish at a outpost camp and the area does not have as much pressure as the west shore. I do believe that has something to do with our success plus 18 years in the same area allows us to make informed decisions on areas to fish and methods to employ. Nothing like experience. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
571518,Guest,2008-02-19 09:44:00,0,"I wonder if the results that show a decline in the fishing on LS is due to groups fishing the same waters every year. I am refering to the groups that hit the Sand Banks in McKenzie, everyday for a week, or sit on Manitoba Pt or Stoney Pt all day everyday. Or any other ""insert spot here"". I know that this may be a comfort zone for people, but LS is an incredible place to explore, find new spots, discover that out of the way spot. I go up every year with a mission to find at least 2 spots that I have never been too, and find fish. My main map is marked with spots that are hot one year and not the next, but may be hot this comming year. Why, because of water temps, wind, falling lake levels, rising lake levels, weed growth, forage, hot air temps, cold fronts, bright sun, overcast and on and on and on. Sometimes we forget that these are all contributors to the equations. ""Idiocy"" is doing the same thing over and over expecting different results, if one thing isn't working it is time for a change, that may be location it may be tactics. For me solving the equation is a big part of the fun of the trip, we need to remember that's why we all call it ""FISHING' not ""Catching""."
569787,JDP,2007-11-12 08:30:00,1457,"I was only able to get up there once this season (in May). So I feel a little deprived versus other years. I'm not asking for specifics on tactics, locations, etc. How was the bite after the lake level rose in late May -early June? Just seeking your thoughts on the state of the walleye and smallmouth populations, any other thoughts you would like to share. Thanks! JDP"
569788,Guest,2007-11-12 13:03:00,0,"I too am interested in getting Bum's opinion on the past season. Nothing better than an opinion from someone as knowledgeable as Bum. My personal experience this past season; easily not up to my normal standards. Lake was either glass calm or VERY windy and big waves. Fish seemed to be much deeper than in past years 20-30' and the ones we did find on the points and flats in 10-15' were smack in the middle of the slot. It was easily the hardest year, but I am still looking forward to next years trip. This lake never ceases to entertain though, a cow moose and calf taking a dip and snacking within 100 yds, a bear swimming between islands ignoring the parade of boats that followed, the dozens of Bald Eagles, particularly the one that came within 30 yds to pick up the dead perch we left for it."
569789,Guest,2007-11-12 15:20:00,0,"While I am not in the same league (or even close) to NWO, I will offer my two cents. Second week in June, is the time frame. This was our 8th or 9th year on the lake at that time of the year, and this was our best year or tied for best year, in terms of quantity of fish and we did very well on large walleyes. Three of us fished 6 days (my 15 year old son, my 78 year old father and myself). This was the first year I can say my son fished pretty hard. He enjoys catching a lot more than fishing and when the bite wanes, so too does his attention. In the six days our top fish were a 30 1/2 walleye and two 29"" each walleyes. The latter two came back to back for my son and were not the same fish. We caught in excess of 400 walleyes bigger than 18"" for the trip (the guide keeps track) and we put over 1000 walleyes in the boat for the week. While the quantity and quality were outstanding, it was perhaps the most challenging week as well. We would get on a spot and it seemed the same in every spot. The fish would hit very strong for a period (5 - 15 minutes) and then it would die. If you ran to find fish, you wasted time, but if you stayed on the spot, then within 15 - 20 minutes, another surge of fish would happen. We too fished in a couple of days when the waves were pounding the boat pretty good and I was glad our guide was standing in the rear of the boat as he was up to his calfs in water and both bilge pumps were running non-stop. But those were our best fishing days as well. Smallmouth fishing was good but not great like the year before. We could catch them with effort, but the winds really put a damper on the topwater bite and for me, its just not as much fun to catch smallies on jigs/tubes. Then I would rather walleye fish because I can catch nice smallies in IA or Wis, but not walleyes of size (unless you fish Superior or Michigan). As to northerns, well the warm spring seemed to push the big fish into deeper cooler water. In a week of hard walleye fishing, we never had one walleye whacked by a northern on the way to the boat or even saw one flash at the surface when a walleye was coming out of the water. That had always happended in the past and usually 2 - 5 times per trip, and those have always been very nice northerns. The lack of seeing any big pike lead us not to even try for them, so I am not sure my theory is correct, but the only northerns we caught in a week were smaller fish than normal. They are still there, so I suspect they had drifted deeper than where we were fishing. 2007 was a great trip for us and we are looking forward to another great trip in 2008. Cheers...IA Walleye"

I now find every shape and size in >all of my favourite holes. lacseulwalleyeguide I would disagree to some extent, but in fairness, I really need some time to outline why, in a thoughtful, accurate write-up. Overall trends are certainly changing on Lac Seul. I have received a couple personal messages from other interested anglers asking for my thoughts on some of their observations over time. I must say their anecdotal evidence matches much the same as what myself and many others have observed. I have also debated the merits of contentions made by other individuals on this issue, some of whom or some of which I agree with, and some that I don't or feel only partially explains the observed changes. The real debate here ultimately rests with those who are on LS much of the season and have been for several years, because, with due respect for those annual vacationers, a person needs that much exposure over time to see strong evidence of changes to the population. (Just as somebody studying climate change doesn't say 'Well, it's hot right here right now', rather it's observation of average changes over time.) That said, I do have a personal opinion on what I perceive to be the changes on Lac Seul and possible explanation for why, but I need to formulate those thoughts concisely and accuarately before posting them on a public forum (and right now, I don't have the time, maybe next weekend). I hope we see a good game on Sunday....I just saw that tickets go on sale for Tom Petty's recently-announced summer tour on Monday!! Hmmm, interesting timing...must be just coincidence, :) NWO Fishing Bum"
571159,JDP,2008-02-02 07:40:00,1457,"The Petty tour ticket release timing is marketing ---- just as NWOFB slyly pointed out. I'm surprised we have not heard of a new album, but then again maybe that also will be announced. As I asked before, I really would appreciate NWOFB's thought out opinions on Lac Seul. 'Til then, I'll get my popcorn ready for the SuperBowl and for reading the opinions of "" A Great Lac Seul Mind"" NWOFB. :popcorn: JDP"
