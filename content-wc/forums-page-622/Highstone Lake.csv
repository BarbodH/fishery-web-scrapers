571564,Guest,2008-02-21 17:11:00,0,Has anybody ever fished Highstone Lake with Hidden Bay Lodge? I am fishing it in the end of June with some buddies. One of the buddies lined it up. I am trusting his judgement. Just looking to see if anybody has any experience with Hidden Bay or fished the lake. Thanks for any input. cnem

We found another outfitter that had a much nicer cabin on the same lake system and have used them since. We did visit the cabin HB had on Gage Lake this year when we were fishing a neighboring lake. They did have new cabin built but, the dock was underwater. The place looked like it had not been used in a couple weeks. When our outfitter picked us up we asked about the cabin on Gage. The outfitter told us Hidden bay had taken a couple of steps back the past couple of years. Too bad if this is true. We liked everything about them except the old cabin. I believe Highstone has a newer cabin."

Nice cabin, however not sure how long it will be nice as its already falling off the foundation since it was built in a swamp. I liked the lake for fishing and with the other post, the neighboring lake is fun too, Roadhouse of Knobby's. Ive fished many lakes in the Sioux Lookout area, never fished Highstone though. All the lakes Ive fished in that area have been good, some better than others but overall a very productive area. Hidden Bay is good place, by the other post mentioning they may have taken acouple steps back, may be because Rick spends most of his time in the Caribean during the summer months while his mother runs the buissness. Let us know how your trip goes when you return."
571581,clemento,2008-02-22 10:57:00,48,I have been flying in to Hooker Lake with Hidden Bay for 20 years. Love the lake and know the lake very well. It is a great walleye fishery. If not for this I would maybe be looking for another outfitter. I have not been treated poorly. I would consider my service as average. I believe they are good people. Prices are slightly higher than competitors and I don't appreciate the fuel surcharge that is added on. Just my two cents. I must be satisfied I keep going back. Going to Hooker last week of June into the first week of July.
571585,Guest,2008-02-22 13:10:00,0,"I liked Hooker too, good lake. Been there about 5-6 years ago. I usually fish a lake a year or 2 years at most then move onto new waters.. Bounce around outfitters depending what is open when Im able to go fishing. Have used Slate Falls, Knobby's, L & M, and Hidden Bay as they all have cabins in that basic area. All are basically good outfitters, each do there own way of things and each have there own personality."
571606,tyeeguy,2008-02-23 10:07:00,111,I fished it 18 years ago. Nice lake with decent walleye fishing. I did run into a group camping on the lake. They said it was accessable from a logging road and a portage up a river. Also Knobbys fly-in Service had a cabin on the lake. So you might not be the only boat on the lake.
571632,Guest,2008-02-25 08:26:00,0,I checked knobbys web site and they dont offer Highstone as one of there lakes. Mabey another outfitter is now running cabin or the 2nd cabin might not be in use?www.knobbys.on.ca They also dont charge a fuel surcharge. L & M or Slate Falls dont charge the fuel surcharges either. L & M even posts it right on there home page about not charging it.www.lmflyin.com
