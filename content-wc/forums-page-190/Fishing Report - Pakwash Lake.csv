The first two days we were catching plenty of walleye in front of beaches in 3-8 ft of water. The fish seemed to be scattered and just staged, waiting for the mayfly hatch. None were really in concentrated groups. The wind for the week was really blowing hard for the entire week. We ended up getting tired of fishing the same structures which was basically mud/sand flats and we decided to move on to other areas. We did catch quite a few in other areas of the lake as well. The last few days nobody was catching in camp except us and 1 other group. It was in 6-14 ft of water for us in areas that transitioned from mud/weeds to rocks, or from one bottom size of rocks to another. These fish seemed to be more concentrated. If we caught one, we usually got 4-5 in that spot. Best combination for us was white or gold jigs with a minnow. We tried all different color options and night crawlers too. One of the days, there was a really light bite and it took us a bit to boat the first one. The next morning the bite was still really faint, so we threw stinger hooks on and just slayed them. This upped our perch count by triple. Anyways, we did not boat any really large ones, but caught a lot and overall, it was a fun trip!"
