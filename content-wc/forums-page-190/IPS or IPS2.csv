One has IPS and the other has IPS2 any noticeable difference between them? Anyone running a Pro guide that would suggest it being set up a certain way from your own personal trial and error. I will be mostly fishing bigger water for Lakers in central Manitoba. Thanks in advance for any feedback!! Rod"

5614665,Wall-i-Lama,2017-06-16 20:35:00,1524,"The 1675 is IPS, The 1775, 1875 and 2075 are all IPS2."
