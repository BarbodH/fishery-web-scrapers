Then batter, fry and eat. Try to deep fry fish outside before dark, but using a flashlight works for me."
5524114,wmd,2017-05-05 09:38:00,388,"We go win September so daylight hours are shorter. We get up 6-6:30 have breakfast and load our gear and are on the water 7:30-8. We have shore lunch most days as 2 of us are in our 60's and its nice to get out of the boat for an hour or so. We get back to the lodge between 5:30-6:30 clean up and grill something in the Gazebo every night, we are usually thin camp the last week or two they are open so the owners and crew are decompressing from a long summer and are often in the Gazebo having cocktails and we have gotten to know them quite well over the years. In bed by 10 and start all over the next day. I am going with a new group in June so it will be interesting to see their routine, I will nom with the flow. wmd"
5610569,Further North,2017-06-14 17:36:00,2008,"A long time ago in an often misspent youth, three friends and I took a canoeing/fishing trip to the Boundary Waters.We left the weekend after fathers day, June 22nd (that'll be important in a minute), drove through the night from SE WI, Hit Ely about 4:00 AM< got breakfast, picked up licenses and bait, and drove out to the parking lot...we loaded up the canoes (Jeez we were stupid...we took, way, way too much stuff) paddled and portaged in until about 3:00 PM and set up camp. At some point on the way up, we'd decided that since we were on vacation, we didn't need no steekin' watches, so we made a little ceremony out of taking them off and tossing them in our duffel bags.Then ate and went fishing until it got dark...sat round the campfire and BS'd for a few hours then went to bed.Our tents were facing east...so we woke up just after sunrise, ate breakfast, canoed up to the next lake and went fishing. Fished all day with about an hour for lunch, back to camp at dark, ate, BS'd a fe hours, went to bed...got up at sunrise and repeated...By Wednesday...we were beat. Couldn't figure out why. We were in shape, eating well, relaxed, having fun...We staggered through the day, determined to fish until it gat dark again, but...we fished a lot closer to camp...Got back to camp, made dinner and were BS'ing around the campfire when we got into a discussion about what fish we could/couldn't keep...so I went into the tent to grab the regs. Manged to dump my watch on the floor while was getting the booklet...it was just a little shy of 1:30 AM. I'm thinkin'...no way, we just finished eating and cleaning up an hour ago...That's when science reared it ugly head...Were just past summer solstice...sunup was about 5:00 AM, sunset was about 10 after 9:00 PM...and as we all know, it's not full dark up there until pushing 10 PM.We'd been running on 3 hours sleep, fishing 17 hours, and staying up until 2:30, 3:00 AM for5 days...and we'd started with an overnight drive after working all day...Good thing we were young...We slept in the next day..."

While waiting for the wife, I can always fish off the shore or on the docks. Coffee, breakfast, ice runs and boat and bait maintenance keep me busy until she is ready."

5519754,Mojo-NC,2017-05-03 12:25:00,1929,"We used to get up, make breakfast, clean up, and then head out fishing around 8:00ish or so. I personally felt like I was wasting time doing that because I tend to get up really early. Waiting for the other guys to get up and then do the breakfast thing wasn't working for me. We finally decided to fish as soon as we got up and then come back to camp at 9:00 or 9:30 for breakfast. Whoever is in charge of cooking that day would have to come in a little earlier to get the food going. That has worked out much better for everyone in our group. The lake we fish has good spots close to camp so the change seems to be working well. It also gives us a chance to pick up some groceries or run an errand before heading back out after breakfast without sacrificing much valuable fishing time."
5519850,walleye22,2017-05-03 13:15:00,59,"long ago when we first started going up with my dad and an older group food was a huge deal..big breakfast/shore lunch and big dinner. i loved all that but as i got older i didnt want to eat that much and wanted to fish more. seemed we sent more time cooking, eating, and cleaning up then we did fishing. i loved all of that and all the memories. times have past and guys have passed as well. group is only like 4 guys now but we barely eat...we fish so much more. quick breakfast of whatever we want...quick lunch and whatever for dinner. food goes around fishing now not fishing around food. plus i dont put on 20 pounds in a week anymore. ha we still eat just fine..just not a priority like it use to be."
5519946,camp chef,2017-05-03 13:54:00,915,"We travel with a gourmet menu,good wine,excellent after dinner whiskey and copious amounts of beer.The last few years our group has numbered 4 and it is the perfect size to accomodate everyones needs, We have two boats so each pair of fishing partners can sleep and fish at their own pace. Meals are loosely scheduled but from time to time one boat may eat lunch before or after the other. We do enjoy our cocktail time and sitting on the deck with appetizers before dinner. If I fish 8 hrs on any given day I have had my fill.Starting out really early in the morning would put me on the deck enjoying cold beer too early in the afternoon"
5520122,Freytown,2017-05-03 15:17:00,770,"Good question. Been heading to Quebec for over 40 years and imo, the time of the year has an effect on the bite. I go now mostly in mid-June and during this time frame I have day light from 5am to 10pm, so only about 7 hours of night (twilight mixed in). We all know that fish donâ€™t eat 24/7, so with a limited dark time fish will feed with the day light. I fished right at dawn only to see the walleye get really active around 8:30am.Patterns will vary dependent on location, so I let the fish tell me when to start fishing. Cheer! FT"
5520194,Rich B,2017-05-03 15:48:00,1081,"Have had groups do both the pre-dawn ritual as well as breakfast and hit the water by 7 or 8 at the latest....can't say there has been a hot early daylight walleye bite that I remember. Now more than once the mid to late morning as well as early afternoon walleye bite turned red hot....so it's more of an early wake-up and breakfast; and then to the docks around 7 to 8. Most of my friends are early risers, and no one (well, most anyway) are not looking to turn our fishing trip into work week hours....so we go at our own pace and catch plenty of fish for our fish fry's and excitement. As several guys have mentioned, when you're fishing mid-June, you have about 18-19 hours of daylight and a few of those trips (in my younger days) I would try and fish them all....ha....it does catch up with you about mid-week, along with the sunburn and windburn. While I love to get on a hot bite, or catch a trophy; these trips north of the border are now more about family time and friendships....along with catching fish for fish fry's and having time to enjoy a cold beverage or two, with an occasional great cigar overlooking a beautiful lake. If you are able to be with your loved ones or good friends up north making great memories, it doesn't get much better than that....no matter the time of day. Rich"
5521290,BornToFish,2017-05-04 06:18:00,1224,"Greetings,Experience on one particular lake in NW Ontario has shown me that the ""best"" bite changes throughout the season. This body of water has fairly clear water, but not gin clear. In the opening weeks, my best walleye bite is often during the middle of the day, possibly coinciding with daytime high water temperatures.As the season progresses, my best walleye bite is normally in the early morning and again as dusk approaches. The last ninety minutes of daylight are normally like money in the bank. There are days when I happen into a good walleye bite during mid-day, but nothing that I can depend on.More recently, I've been fishing another body of that is fairly stained - like a cup of tea. It just doesn't seem to matter to the fish as to when they bite. Mornings, mid-day and evenings are pretty much all the same to the walleyes. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5521354,That Minnesota guy,2017-05-04 06:34:00,8293,"This thread tells me to sleep as long as I like the fish will be there. Also as a society eating habits have changed. Many people no longer eat a meal at a given time. They snack 18 hours a day. So, get up at 9, wolf down a Twinkie, wash it down with a soda and hit the water!!"
5521426,ogilville,2017-05-04 07:03:00,262,My buddy and I always try to get up and hit the water early. Our lodge owner notices which cabins are the first ones out during the week. We are usually the first or second ones out all week. There are guys in camp that fish until dusk and sleep in and get going mid morning or so. One of the guys was teasing us about getting up early instead of sleeping in. He said they don't even get out of bed until 8:30 or 9:00 AM. My buddy's comment was that we have caught 30 Walleyes by that time. Sometimes but not always is that an exaggeration. It does seem that on many days once it gets to mid morning and we start seeing other boats the bite has slowed down. Of course we are there in June when there are lots of daylight hours and we choose to use the early ones. The other guys will be cleaning fish at 10:30 PM and I will already be sleeping with dreams of Walleyes yet to be caught by the dawns' early light.
5521506,SterlingArcher,2017-05-04 07:23:00,92,"I am always an early riser on our trip, and there are a few others who also hit the lake at dawn. Over the years, we have learned to split the denizens of the cabins between the early risers and the not so early crew. I have had some of my absolute best fishing for big walleyes first thing in the morning in very shallow water. But the reason I get up early is similar to what some others have mentioned - gorgeous sunrises, steam on the water, absolute peace and quiet, chance at seeing more wildlife...the whole wilderness experience. If I get tired, I can find an island and take a nap"
5521658,jambi,2017-05-04 07:59:00,504,This. That. and That. We do what we want; only thing set is time for dinner. Three weeks out!
5519202,Bakefish,2017-05-03 07:49:00,1077,Who among you get on the water at the break of dawn or before while in Canada? I've been going to Canada since the early 70's or so and have done it a few times. Not in many years though.I've noticed that very few people are away from the dock until 7 or 8. Even most guides don't start until 8.The times that I have gotten out very early I haven't noticed a vast improvement in the fishing...in fact just the opposite. It's always later that we get into them.
5519210,Wedge,2017-05-03 07:52:00,270,"Personally, I am an early riser anyways. If I am up there and awake, I want to be fishing. Sometimes I smallmouth fish those first couple of hours with top water baits on rock shelfsSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"
5519322,skindzier,2017-05-03 08:48:00,137,"I love getting on the water early. Depending on where I'm staying and what the plan is for the day, sometimes we'll be on the water at dawn, come in for lunch and a nap, then go back out & fish till dark. The thing I love about being out early isn't so much the fishing as it is just experiencing it. Fog, or steam rolling off the water, wildlife, water flat as glass. While musky fishing in quiet bays at first light, I've seen deer, moose, beavers, otters, bears and even a couple wolves - certainly more than midday or even later in the morning. Also something pretty exhilarating about having a 4 foot log chase your topwater with steam coming off the water..."
5519482,billy weaver,2017-05-03 09:43:00,470,We have been going to Canada for 30 years and have taken to fishing late rather than early. We have had better luck fishing late rather than early. It seems to me that the hour before sunset (dark) is a hot time on the lake. I think the walleye are coming out of deep water to feed. We anchor on the edge of deep water and slow jig. We usually don't get to bed before 11:00 to 12:00 PM. The only time I see sunrise is on my way to the bathroom. We go the 5th week of the season so it might be different in May.
5519522,mjayn,2017-05-03 10:27:00,1188,"I am an early riser but I am also one that will go back to bed if given the opportunity. That being said my first trip to Canada was a bit tiring the first few days. I almost always fish until dusk, no major breaks. The excitement of being in Canada fishing for the first time got me up early and we were out at dawn the first 2 days. Well in Mid-June that meant we fished from 5:30-6am until about 10:30-11pm. Somehow my partner and I woke up about 11am the 3rd day and were surprised we hadn't noticed that fishing all day, a few beers at the fire and dinner left us about 3 hours of sleeptime and we were exhausted. The resort owner was laughing at us strolling into the main lodge at noon, he was like I was wondering when it was going to catchup with you guys you fished dam near 35 hours in the first 2 days. We noticed the best fishing was in the late afternoon so we started adjusting our times and coming back to the cabin for a few hours during mid day. Now I tend to fish semi early, but not dawn and like to get off the water a little earlier then dusk. I will still go Dawn to dusk once in a while(when the fish are biting) but 8am to dusk is much more likely."
5519602,prov1800,2017-05-03 11:06:00,5010,Being a guide i usually leave the dock between 7:30-8:30.depends on the fisherman i get in the boat.plus the camp i guide at a number of weeks through out the summer (northshore lidge)has the american plan and nobody is ever in a rush from what i gather.i have gone earlier if some guests have asked for it but would say fishing isnt any better in my book.we always do well as we go but seems that 10-2 is some of the best.sometimes we have our shorelunch later as it seems just before lunch it can really turn on.evening fishing on eagle isxreally good for big fish but can only fish for them to just before dark as there is no night fishing allowed but well worth it that last hour.
5519650,Pooch,2017-05-03 11:43:00,4618,"Never felt we gained anything (other than watching the world wake up) by being out before or at sunrise. It is pretty out in the mornings and I used to be an early riser, but have out grown that habit as I age. We used to make our fishing trip ""a job"" in order to cram every minute on the water we could. It eventually became a job instead of a vacation. No longer...Like others have said I like the evening bite the best and like Prov said there is many times a late morning bite that one should pay attention to. Not always, but more often than a casual observer might realize.Pooch"
5519666,bigwalleye1,2017-05-03 11:50:00,2632,"This. It's about the experience as well as the fishing. That said, on long runs, even if you leave the dock at 7, it may be 45 minutes before you're at your target location with lines in the water. I've found that a lot of days, they're smacking baits when we get there, so I started going earlier, with the thought that if it dies off in mid afternoon, go back for a nap/shower/cocktail/appetizer. I'm willing to trade a couple hours in the afternoon that may be a tougher bite for what I've found to be a better bite in the early morning. YMMV."

5519722,clawman,2017-05-03 12:06:00,2078,"Most awesome time of the entire day is sunrise. Whether you are listening to turkeys flying down, watching the changing light creating different scenery or the first fish jumping of the morning I never get tired of the beauty of nature."
