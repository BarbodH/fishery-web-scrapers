The full story with text and photos is forthcoming, but I pieced together this 33 minute video which I think is awesome all things considered. Have always wanted to fish Napken so it was nice to finally experience it. Bugs were FEROCIOUS, the worst I've seen in a long time. The camp quite frankly was nicer than I expected which was a pleasant surprise.We fished it pretty hard and caught a total of 12 trophy sized pike in excess of 40"" for the week. A couple were true giants. Walleye were super abundant and easy to catch, although as expected they do run small in Napken. If you wanted to you could catch them all day long though.Anyhow, check out the video!Cheers https://youtu.be/LViVgQBGI4k?t=1s"

5610217,adempsey2.0,2017-06-14 15:05:00,612,"Well. There were solar panels in the screend in porch. Once those are up, I imagine adding a water pump to a gravity tower wouldnt be too much of a stretch. Sent from my SM-G903W using Tapatalk"
5610433,Mike Borger,2017-06-14 16:29:00,1554,"Yes, like Adam said plans are in the works for solar lighting and running water at Napken. There's already a shower stall in the screen porch. I MacGyver'd a bucket with a tap and filled it with hot water I warmed up on the stove for a shower.Not sure about the other camps, but that seems to be the plan for Napken."

5613225,BrianE,2017-06-15 21:35:00,98,"Thanks again for sharing Mike, nothing like a Father & Son trip, a lifetime of memories. Yeah those bugs lol they sure keep you on your toes. Speaking of bugs will never forget the time when our group went to Attwood lake (back when the Massauro's owned it), we arrived to their house in the am hours, just as it was starting to get light....we excitedly hopped out of our vehicles to stretch a little and literally got chased right back in! and try as hard as we could to catch a little sleep until Kelly & Maureen opened their doors that morning. The bugs were so terrible on that one particular trip that we wore head nets whenever we were on or near shore. Thankfully have never encountered that again."
5613337,Mike Borger,2017-06-16 04:14:00,1554,"Hi John, was really great chatting with you that night! Will most definitely try to take you up on your offer if at all possible.

Brian, precisely which one of 3 reprobates who joined me at Napken do you think is my son?"
