5612337,walleye22,2017-06-15 12:24:00,59,why is it so hard to do follow rules and laws and doing the right thing and having respect for mother nature.
5612361,LOW1,2017-06-15 12:31:00,2828,"Wow, I'm glad they got them.Not having a license before you shoot a moose is about as egregious as you can get.And I am glad for the $10k fine - that's far more than a violator would get around here."
5612497,bowtech840,2017-06-15 13:24:00,111,Not defending them but it doesn't surprise me. The cost of hunts is getting outrageous. Not talking just in Canada. The odds of getting tags are getting higher. What would a bull moose hunt cost a guy up there? Tag and outfitter I'm sure it would be close to 10k. It's a gamble that I'm sure a lot of ppl get away with. With the rising cost of these hunts I think it's in the COs best interest to raise the fines even higher. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

I heard about the incident this fall, the yahoo's that shot the moose got their pickup stuck while trying to retrieve the moose, they flagged down a local fellow that was moose hunting to pull them out, they gave him enough information to hang themselves, instead of pulling them out he called the tip hotline. I am glad they got an unusually big fine, but cannot understand why they don't ban them from Ontario for life!"

5613185,martinbns,2017-06-15 21:17:00,1520,"A two year ban for a non-resident is ridiculous. $10,000 Ban for life from getting an Outdoor card in Ontario of any kind."
5613737,LOW1,2017-06-16 08:17:00,2828,"I am glad that it was a hefty fine.But perhaps 30 days in a lake view cell at the Kenora jail may be a better option. After all, if the Minnesota hunters are wealthy, $10,000 may only amount to an expensive roadtrip for them."
5614289,btyreprich,2017-06-16 15:01:00,1067,In my opinion the ban should been for many more years or even a lifetime ban on hunting in Ontario. The dollar amount of the fine is surprising and sends a message not to violate hunting laws in the province
5614601,IAWally,2017-06-16 19:37:00,38,I agree the 2 year ban is extremely light. 20 years or Lifetime would be more in order.
