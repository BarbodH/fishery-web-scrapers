PM, me if you wouldn't mind...Love to pick your brain, as it seems we fish a lot of the same areas. We'll be up the week after you."

5567874,Limeyangler,2017-05-24 17:53:00,563,"Hi all,Well....I think my expectations and excitement of walleye opener were too high, caught fish, but its been a cold spring and the fish were all over the place, some big ones deep already, but they had lockjaw, only fish feeding seemed to be in 5' to 3' FOW in the wind....LOTS OF PIKE! There was still ice on some north facing shores and average water temps were sub 50F. Still awesome to get out and fish this lake, its where I feel most at peace.VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/jhpCHEOMaW0"

I've watched almost all your open water footage. I usually don't watch ice fishing, probably because I personally don't like it. Anyway, thanks for the early report. I will be there with my dad and brother in 2 weeks. I hope the nights stay cold and you don't go crazy with the warm days until June 6. It would be nice to hit the tail end of walleye spawn."
