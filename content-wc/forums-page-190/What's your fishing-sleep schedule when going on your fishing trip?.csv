After dinner is usually the outing that everyone is gung ho for - so typically its a quick meal, beer and then coffee and whatever your poison is for the session Keep in mind we have mainly been on small lakes (less than 2400 acres) - on a bigger lake I think we would opt for sandwiches or shore lunches more and avoid heading back to camp for lunch Last summer I was at a full service lodge where for most of the group the vibe was more about relaxation and drinking - I had a great time but found myself fishing alone a lot and wishing there was someone who was as keen as me Cheers Gordy"
5609801,Sportdog,2017-06-14 11:54:00,6735,No schedule unless dictated by weather conditions. Only eat twice a day and most likely only once at the cabin. Sandwiches and such on the water usually. Typical day of fishing is to catch walleye for dinner first and then spend the rest of the day chasing Pike and Smallmouth. This years trip will be different as my two grandsons aren't wild about eating fish and are crazy for Pike. Of course I'll have to sneak in a fish fry for me though for sure!
5610801,bigdaddyguns,2017-06-14 18:54:00,608,"Great topic and very interesting to read the varying perspectives on the matter. Get up around 7 make a pot of coffee and go over previous days fishing info; waypoints, sonar recordings, underwater camera, etc. Look at weather and put together a few ideas to try for the day. Usually on the water by 9am and we fish till 1-2pm. Either shore lunch or come back in eat and relax. My boys like to have a few adult beverages and smoke a cigar sitting out in the shade relaxing while taking in the wonders of the Canadian Wilderness. We hit the water around 5pm or so and fish into twilight. Have a light meal at the end of the day and perhaps a few adult beverages while sharing time together chewing the fat or watching a movie. When the sky conditions are clear we like to go out on the docks and star gaze. Philosophical points and lessons learned: 1. No real clock watching, get enough of that during the year it's nice to just go with the flow as long as everyone is kind of in the same rhythm. 2. Eat the big meal mid day. No fun starting to cook dinner at 11PM then eating a big meal with cleanup thereafter. For us better done mid day. 3. As others have mentioned, I have not had much better success with an early morning bite than at 12PM. So I have no motivation to fish real early. 4. Usually do two shore lunches during the week. Three or more and my crew tends to lose motivation."
5610833,bigdaddyguns,2017-06-14 19:02:00,608,Mike is this schedule for a week trip or longer? I can see this pace for a couple of days but an entire week would be grueling for me. Just being out in the sun from 1-4pm without activity can really be draining in summer.

5611361,UKBDM,2017-06-15 05:41:00,178,We have a mixed group of 10-12 ... 4-5 adults and 7-8 teens. Adults get up early (6:00-6:30) eat a quick breakfast and on the water by 7:00. Fish until 10:00 or so and then come back to camp to get boys who stayed up until 2:00 doing whatever boys do.Fish until 1:00 or so and return to camp for nap. Boys may go out on their own at this point. I get up around 4:00 and start the evening meal. Boys come in and devour everything in sight around 5:00 and then everyone is back on the water by 6:30-7:00 and we fish until dark (10:00-10:30)Go to bed for 5-6 hours of sleep and do it all over again.That afternoon nap is critical for me. Have to have it!

It's when I get up almost every day without any alarm. Second, I'm waiting for enough light to go out fishing! So I'm usually up early, leave the dock around 6:00-ish, fish until 9:00. Come back for breakfast with my wife & kids, and head back out around 10:00 for 3-4 hours. Come back in around 1:00 for lunch and back out around 2:00 until 6:00 or so to clean fish, fire up the grills, drink some beer. Eat around 8:00 or 9:00. Play cards & games until 10:00 or 11:00. Rinse & repeat the next day! üòÑ This is typically how each day goes on our family Canadian vacation. We always have 1 or 2 afternoons of swimming, skiing and tubing. I'll take one day where I nap for an hour or two, but otherwise I'm up there to fish as much and as long as I can. It's what I enjoy most...being out on the water enjoying nature and hopefully doing battle with the fishy part of nature! My wife loves to relax & read books in the boat, and fish a little. My daughter loves to fish and do a little book reading. My son likes to talk movies, eat snacks and reel in a fish or two on my line. If it were a guys-only trip, I'd prefer to be leaving the dock between 7:00 and 8:00, eat lunch in the boat and come back around 6:00 or 7:00. üëçüèª"

5609489,walleye22,2017-06-14 09:29:00,59,"been going for about 40 years and been through different groups. when i first started going up with dad and gramps the group was older...i was young....the group was big and everything was scheduled. breakfast, lunch, dinner, fishing, hotels....was very scheduled. seemed everything revolved around food and we ate very well. Big breakfast, big lunch, big dinner and everyone was expected to be there. as i got older i felt the trip was about eating and not fishing. I enjoyed the trips but also wanted freedom to fish as long as i wanted too and not get yelled at if i didnt make lunch. As that group passed on it went to a smaller group and much more relaxed...fish as long as we wanted, wake up when you wanted, went to bed when you wanted...much more casual and i enjoyed that...now that same group seems enjoy drinking more than fishing...i feel my fishing trip interrrupts their drinking trip so i get a boat to myself. they like to go out and drink till 3am and sleep in and things like that...which is fine...its their trip too....i just fish alot by myself which i enjoy."

If I could only fish four hours a day I would start at dawn. Now when I fish somewhere that it is a long haul back in ill pack a lunch and stay all day. We'll probably have a couple of those this year because we want to make some longer exploring runs. Nothing set in stone, just when we feel like it."

5608001,Mojo-NC,2017-06-13 17:47:00,1929,"We used to get up and make a group breakfast. Everyone would eat together, and then we'd hit the lake. I generally wake up pretty early, basically as soon as it gets light outside (uh yeah, 4:30-5:00ish). I found myself messing around waiting for the rest of the guys in the group to get up. It wasn't working. A few days a couple of us early risers would just fish early and then come back and eat. That seemed to work out pretty well, so that's exactly what we do now. We have a set fishing rotation. We decide with our fishing partner for the day what time we're going to hit the water each morning, which species we're going to chase, and where we're going to go to get 'em. The cooks come back early, the rest of us come back at 9:30 for breakfast, clean up the dishes and hit the water again. We have a rotation of cooks assigned for each day, our breakfast menu is decided in advance, and someone is assigned clean-up duty. Everyone is on their own for lunch every day (sandwiches, leftovers, or whatever they can find), and we have a set dinner time and menu. That schedule seems to work well. We have a few drinks after dinner, maybe play some cards or smoke a cigar, and hit the rack. Repeat next day."
5608057,kzoofisher,2017-06-13 18:21:00,5144,"Weather plays a big role in daily routine but this is the standard. I wake up usually a little before first light and make coffee. We bumble around a bit and head out between 6 and 6:30. We'll plan on cleaning fish and decide whether we want an afternoon or evening fish fry around noon unless we are hammering them. If you are on a great bite it is expected that you will radio the other guys and give them a heads up. An afternoon fry means heading back out at 4 or 5 and fishing til dark. A light lunch means either a fry at 5 and fish til dark or a dinner after dark. I'm not of fan of a big meal and straight to bed but the majority rules and I get my preference as often as not. We usually take an afternoon mid week for extended clean up, tackle reorganization, exploring or whatever meets our fancy. I get back the Friday of Memorial Day weekend so recuperation time is never a worry."

Back out at 6 till hour after dark. 6 hours of sleep and back at it. By day 3, that nap is needed and no problem falling asleep. Refresh and back at it. It's all about lure time in the water.

5608201,Wall-i-Lama,2017-06-13 19:22:00,1524,"Not at all a stupid question. We fish LOTW, and after many years haven't really seen any benefit of fishing real early or late. We get up, have breakfast and hit the lake at about 9:00. Always pack a small lunch and drinks. Stay out till 5 or 6. That gives us about 8 full hours of fishing. Some days we catch our fill of numbers and size and we come in at 3 or 4. Then back to docks, clean fish (infrequent, as mostly catch release) have dinner and pop in a DVD. I gave up early and late fishing years ago as that seems to be peak mosquito time. Also, we fish out a long ways from camp, so coming in and out is a waste of time and gas. It comes down to whatever works for you. Have a good summer, regardless of what schedule you use!"

There is nothing like going to a place you truly love and being completely disconnected from the rigors of daily life at home and work. On my trips , there is no schedule at all. The trip just unfolds each day and I go with it. If the fish are biting....that is just a bonus for me. Many years ago I opted to not go out one afternoon and the rest of the group thought I was nuts. Little did they know I was looking for a few hours of complete peace and quiet where I could go explore the island we were tied up to. Catching fish off the back of the houseboat was a bonus , but I had a great time just wandering around and exploring another slice of wilderness in the north woods. I never planned the moment, but I said to myself, why not ? Off the grid is a very good thing for myself and I'm very fortunate that my wife understands this aspect.

5607289,bthomas3333,2017-06-13 12:56:00,465,"I am more of a late night fisherman. I just find more big eyes late than really early, so I tend to fish later than earlier. This is one of those topics that always scares me when I fish with a new group or invite newbies with us. I think it is important to level set when folks like to fish for pairing up boat partners. I typically find that in January everyone is a 17 hr a day fisherman, but come day 2 or 3 of a trip they have dialed it way back. I am usually good for a lot of hours but more like 12-14 vs 18 kinda guys. If you find yourself with a new boat partner and you aren't in sync it make for an UNCOMFORTABLE week.Brett"
5607385,Ricky Spanish,2017-06-13 13:11:00,1298,"Most of my weekends are spent camping, hunting or fishing, and we DIY everything. When I go up to Canada, we prefer to do a housekeeping plan now, so breakfast and dinner are during set times, but we have no meals to prep or clean up after either, unless we do shore lunch(mandatory at least once on each trip). Get up about 5-5:30AM, hit the main lodge for coffee and a big breakfast. Go out fishing until I feel like coming back, sometimes for a midday nap, sometimes staying out until 5 for dinner. Lunch is a bag of sandwiches or a DIY shore lunch on your own schedule. We usually do a few shore lunches during our stay and bag lunches the other days. There are days where we skip lunch because breakfast and dinners are filling enough. Dinner usually starts being served around 5, and we eat a great meal, (steak, 1/2 chicken, bacon wrapped pork chop, etc.) then back fishing until dark. Dark = bar time at Eagle Lake, so we drink and BS there until midnight some days. Wake up 5-5:30 and repeat.A vacation, to me, isn't for sitting around relaxing. Making the best of my paid time off of work has to be doing some of my favorite things. You couldn't pay me enough to ""waste"" my PTO sitting on a beach or a cruise ship. I can sit around reading at home. I do read in bed on a fishing trip, but mainly so my wife can fall asleep first, before I fire up the chainsaw sounds of my snoring.

Make coffee, grab a breakfast bar and fish until 10:30/11 or so. Eat a lunch, cleanup, drink a beer and make a plan for the afternoon. Head back out at 1 and fish (usually northerns) until 4:30 or 5. Eat a big fish dinner. Head out about 6:30 and fish walleyes until dark. Drink beer around the campfire. Cook up a late night snack if needed."
5607697,Lake Wisconsin,2017-06-13 14:52:00,1960,"Usually up around 7 pm, good breakfast and hit the water. Lunch on the boat - usually pretty light. Then back in around 3-5 pm, clean fish and make dinner. Head back out between 5-7 till dark or better. Repeat. I find it is tough to soar with the eagles and hoot with the owls, so we hoot with the owls."
5606449,clegg,2017-06-13 09:50:00,38,"Might sound like a stupid question but I'm curious how you guys do it. . . We went up a couple of years ago and the same thing always happens (3d time going up). We're so excited to fish that we fish as much as we can, get exhausted on the second day and by the end of it we need another vacation from our vacation. We're going to Lac Hebert mid july so we were thinking of getting a little more structured: -5:00 am on the boat until +-11:30, - go back to cabin, lunch and nap. - 5:00 pm get up, have supper and go back out by 6:30 until sundown (or a little later), filet, (possibly eat again), and sleep. That way we would get about 5 hours at night and 4 hours in the day.. What's your fishing/sleep/fileting schedule when going up that works for you ?"
5606481,The tank,2017-06-13 10:00:00,340,Don't really have one. I'm not only fishing I'm not working. For me it depends on time of year. Opening week we don't get out to early but stay out all day. When it's hot I like to take a break from 2-5 or so. I wI'll some times take a break and pull up on a sand beach and get out and walk around some.
5606665,ogilville,2017-06-13 10:35:00,262,"My buddy and I set the alarm for 5:00 AM. We get up and start the coffee pot, do our morning moving around, drink some coffee, cook and eat breakfast, get dressed for fishing and head to the boat. Usually get our bait and in the boat heading out between 6:30 and 7:00 AM. It depends on how good the fishing is on what time we come in for lunch. We come in cook and eat lunch and usually relax for a little while then head back out for the afternoon/evening fishing. Normally we come back to the cabin, clean fish, cook and eat supper, hang out until bedtime. My eyes usually refuse to stay open by around 9:00 PM or so. Set the alarm, go to bed, get up the next morning and do it again."
5606729,That Minnesota guy,2017-06-13 10:50:00,8293,I can get tired and catch fish staying home. This is suppose to be a break from life and enjoyable. I go out when I feel like it. Come in when I feel like it. I've been known to send the boat out without me while I sit on the deck and read a boat or just chill out. Schedules are for at home and at work.
5606745,Seanik,2017-06-13 10:57:00,218,"I sleep when I'm tired and fish when I want too. Schedules on a Canada fishing trip is not what a vacation is about, go with the flow and relax. Seanik"
5606777,ogilville,2017-06-13 11:06:00,262,"I agree with you if I am on a beach or family vacation. I do like to do things as I get around to them and not worry about when I get started or finished. But going to Canada fishing for one week a year is something I look forward to all year and I want to try and maximize my time doing it. I love fishing at home but the fishing doesn't compare. I don't live in a state with 10,000 lakes and I have to share the resources with a lot of other fisherman and boaters. So, my time spent fishing while I'm in Canada is as enjoyable as it gets for me. I can rest when I get home and look forward to doing it again next year."
5606793,SterlingArcher,2017-06-13 11:09:00,92,"I usually get up about 5, on the water by 5:30 or 6, fish til noon or 1, find an island to eat lunch on, fish til about 7, come back to camp to make & eat supper, then fish til dark. Lather, rinse, repeat."
5607025,walleye22,2017-06-13 12:01:00,59,No schedule really...get up kind of early..7ish...coffee...light breakfast...head to boat...go fish...coe back in whenever we want too....might take a nap...might not...eat a small lunch..back out...fish...back in for an easy dinner then backout till dark or until we cant fight the bugs anymore...back in..couple drinks..bed.
5607113,HeHooksHimself,2017-06-13 12:18:00,725,"While I resist schedules, we find ourselves exhibiting similar behaviors every day in Canada. We get on the water about 8 after breakfast (usually cereal, but sometimes more). We come off the water about 2:00, clean fish, eat our big meal, visit the outhouse and clean up and then get back on the water around 5 or 6 and fish until dark. This seems to work pretty well for us. However, if someone has hit the honey hole, we might deviate. FISH ON! Hooks"
