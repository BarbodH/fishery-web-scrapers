Our party netted several large 24-26"" eyes, couple 27"" and the big was 28"". All big fish for the most part were caught in and around little sands, big sands and Ghost Narrows. We'd troll a bit faster than normal with bottom bouncers and lindy / spinners. Need to be sure the spinners are actually spinning. Jigging spinners isnt affective. The islands to the north of little sands produced quantity and quality too. White / Pearl is the hot color for jigs which were very productive. Definitely worth taking a day or two and hitting the north (left side) of the entrance to Broad lake. The rock pile in Broad was highly affective. Highly recommend getting to the north side of the largest island all the way to the back of Sunlight. The river from the main to Broad is 6-10' with one spot to watch. Hug the right side when going in, left when coming out. I bent the **** out of a prop. We didn't get much in South Bay near the north river entrance or anything down by the waterfall. The weather was in the 50s n 60s with rain most days. One of the better midwest storms Ive been apart of took place on Thursday mid evening. Powerful rain, hail, etc.... I've got great video. The 3-4ft rollers on the boat ride to and from MacKenzie was the worst. Big swells, wet clothes all week, serious back issues each night, etc.... I'm not one to wear a PFD in the boat and I wore it a bit throughout the week. Best of luck!! PM for spots and more info."
