As mentioned earlier all in all it was a good one, with the notable exception being the ferocious bugs and the stifling heat. Lots of big fish though, lots of laughs, and a nice camp.More importantly the D-Man, Adam Dempsey discovered a bizarre new pattern and also caught an absolutely gigantic pike, the biggest fish of his life. There's a really great story surrounding this catch and new ""pattern"" which I'm sure you'll get a kick out of. Check it out, Cheers, Mike http://www.canadafishingguide.net/na...-pike-walleye/"
