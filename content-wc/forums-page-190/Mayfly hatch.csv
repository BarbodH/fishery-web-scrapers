5617857,troutwater,2017-06-19 06:43:00,299,Was up on Cedar in August a few years ago. The mayfly catch was so bad there it clogged the water pump pickup for a guy in camp's boat! That was a first for us.
5573105,Bill Krejca,2017-05-27 05:40:00,6107,"Pooch, ha! If you think the mayflies to be a pest, try spending a week tent camping when the army worms decide it is time to set up housekeeping at the same site you normally stay. The sudden sound of increased sizzling in the frying pan isn't just from the fish. Doesn't hurt the taste any, though! Bill"
5573241,pjshorthorn,2017-05-27 07:41:00,5654,"Years ago we hit a pretty heavy hatch in early June on Lac Seul.Every fish we caught was gorged on mayflies . After dinner one evening, my uncle got out his fly tying gear he brought along and tied up a few flies to try and match the mayfly pattern. We used them the next day with a small minnow and had decent success. Last June on LOTW we ran into a hatch as well. It didn't seem to effect fishing too much, but it was my first trip there and had no baseline on how good walleye fishing was supposed to be. We targeted areas that did not have as many bugs on top of the water and caught fish . The downside that is small pocket bays where the wind had blown dead mayflies there was quite a stench. Of course, in one particular bay was quite ripe and we had to pass it to and from camp. PjShorthorn"
5573641,Pooch,2017-05-27 12:10:00,4618,Already done that last year! Couldn't go for an evening or after lunch walk out to the road as they were dropping like leaves in the fall all over us.Couple of our guys claim that leeches aren't all that bad fried up using Andy's batter. Wonder how those Army worms would cook up? You go first and let me know.Pooch
5573705,prov1800,2017-05-27 14:26:00,5010,theres nothing that eats them things.so that might tell you something.lol.
5573721,prov1800,2017-05-27 14:32:00,5010,been through a few seasons of the worms in our camping days but we would always camp on a island and wouldn't be bothered by them.but at least they don't bite.lol.
5574057,Bill Krejca,2017-05-27 21:55:00,6107,"They don't bite, but they make a heck of a sound when they hit the hot grease. It also makes for a fun time around the campfire, as, if you sit very long in one place, they inch their way all over you. After a while, you just get used to it. Bill"
5575249,adempsey2.0,2017-05-28 19:26:00,612,Ive hit them first week of july a couple times. Sometimes it finished the week before sometimes during or started toward the end of the week. Not every year but I dont go to the same lake either. Look up mayfly rig. A small spinner harness with a smaller presentation. Slip bobbers worked for me too. Nice time to get some whitefish as well.Sent from my SM-G903W using Tapatalk
5593209,walleyehunt13,2017-06-06 07:23:00,10,What is the timing of the Mayfly hatch looking like this year around Vermilion Bay?
5613769,prov1800,2017-06-16 08:25:00,5010,fished east end last week and saw mayflies in a few bays coming up.s time is here cold weather we are having might stop it a bit but its going to happen when temps rise again.
5614401,Bill Krejca,2017-06-16 16:00:00,6107,"There are a number of variety's and sizes and colors of mayflies, and it is not unusual to see some type hatching almost every month that one might up there fishing. Certain kinds seem to be more in abundance, and these are the ones which become most noticeable. The larger yellow ones, called ""Yellow Sallys"" by some (others call them other names) seem to be the ones which influence the bite the most. Different parts of the lake and streams can have hatches of the same type at slightly different times, due to conditions. (Just like fish bite at different places, etc.)Bill"
5569817,Mojo-NC,2017-05-25 12:08:00,1929,"We experienced a mayfly hatch the last time we went to Canada during the first week of June. We switched to a black jig with a dark brown 3"" grub and had decent success. I don't think the bite was as good as normal, but we did catch fish. Give that a try the next time."
5569841,Ricky Spanish,2017-05-25 12:19:00,1298,Slow trolling a spinner rig/minnow with no weight helped us get back on the action last time we were in the midst of the hatch.
5569849,Ver88,2017-05-25 12:20:00,114,"I agree with prov, I like fishing during a mayfly hatch. Th fish are usually very aggressive and easy to catch once you figure out where they are feeding."
5569897,Guest,2017-05-25 12:44:00,0,"I have run into the hatch twice in Perrault Falls on Wabaskang. Once was the first week of July and the other was the forth week of June. As already mentioned, it shut down the walleye overnight. You could still get a few but not good numbers of what you expect when going to Canada. As also mentioned, sometimes they are on one side of the lake or a bay and few in another section. The smallmouth and northern always cooperated during the hatch so we stayed busy during the day and just hit the walleye the last two hours of the day. A dark jig under a bobber might work as the fish were on the surface slurping up the bugs. Best of luck."
5570233,Bstar,2017-05-25 15:08:00,564,I've only experienced the mayfly hatch once many years ago on Leech Lake before I knew anything about walleye fishing. We annihilated them using a minnow on a plain hook with a small split shot under a slip bobber set between 2-4 ft deep. It was the only time I have ever seen walleye feeding on the surface like trout. They were gorging themselves on the mayflys but couldn't resist the easy meal that our minnows offered. It was a lot of fun.
5570441,prov1800,2017-05-25 17:03:00,5010,"easiest way to explain is not to fish where you usually do.mayflys come out of mud bottoms.i usually find the contour lines heading into bays and follow them.i put waypoints along these drops.usually around 10 ft if it starts to drop is a good place to start but I do a lot of zig zagging along these contour lines.nowadays you can buy some good looking mayfly larvae from most of the compamnies making them.you can jig vertically or put them on a slip bobber.dont be afraid to venture shallower and back out.evenings seem the best especially if you see fish coming to the surface.usually the first few days is the best but then action can slow down,they do really gorge if youve ever fillet one.some are about ready to explode.best to have a number of these areas as they can all be diff in action.then if it doesnt seem very good go to some colder water and rocks.take eagle lake.osborne bay warms up real fast and could have the hatch going there when there is still ice patches on the main lake.really need to know where and when.when ever you get a curve thrown in and makes fishing tougher iam all for it.always love a challenge,unless your only up one week.lol."
5571561,wmd,2017-05-26 08:20:00,388,pro Thans much for the information. We will be in Sioux Lookout 2 weeks from today and spend the night before going on to Lake St Joeseph for a week. We will most likely eat at the Forest Inn around 7 PM and would gladly buy you a refreshment or 2 of your choice. We will be a group of 8 with at least 5 other W/C members and would like to meet you if it works. Thanks again wmd
5571937,prov1800,2017-05-26 11:17:00,5010,appreciate the offer but iam not from Sioux lookout.i live in vermilion bay.get up there at times and fish with some friends.good luck on your trip.
5572801,wmd,2017-05-26 20:16:00,388,Well if I had looked I would have seen that. I remember reading a post of yours where Sioux was mentioned and got on my head that was where you lived. Thanks wmd
5572873,Pooch,2017-05-26 20:29:00,4618,"I've only brushed up against the Mayfly hatch a couple times. I thought it really changed fishing, but we still caught fish away from the hatching areas. I tried a light brown (or tan might be abetter color name) small (1/8 -1/16) jig and small leech and caught some fish when the Mayflys were just emerging and breaking water.Not sure it was what I was fishing with, but a few fish still seemed cooperative. I don't like the hatch as they can really be a pest when out walking around camp. I sure wouldn't stay home just because of a big hatch, but I would be a lot less talkative and not a mouth breather.....Pooch"
5566954,eyegator,2017-05-24 12:18:00,29,"I know this is definitely an in-exact science- but in an average year, when is the mayfly hatch in the Ear Falls area?"
5567098,Jwendt15,2017-05-24 13:01:00,72,We were at Onaway two years ago during the 2nd week in June. Ran into some really warm weather and they hatched towards the end of the week. Bite changed overnight on us. I don't have as much experience up there as others so I'll be interested to see what everyone else thinks. Sent from my SM-G935P using Tapatalk
5567122,Mojo-NC,2017-05-24 13:15:00,1929,"I think around the first week of June in the Ear Falls area would be a safe bet, depending on the weather any given year. When the water temps reach the low-mid 60's F."
5567330,Golden Eagle,2017-05-24 14:18:00,2642,"They hatch at different times on different parts of the lake. They follow nature's calendar, not the calendar on the wall.Are you wanting to fish the hatch or avoid fishing the hatch?"
5567394,eyegator,2017-05-24 14:44:00,29,I have only fished in early July- so I've been after the hatch. I'd rather avoid the hatch- but would be curious what others think.I'd love to book an early June trip- but is it safe to assume you stand a good chance of running into the hatch?If you do- what are some methods people use during that time?
5567458,Golden Eagle,2017-05-24 15:27:00,2642,"Don't think fishing is either better or worse, but different. It's a time when you need to move around, make changes until you find what works.This year I'm fishing the July 15 week. I expect pike and walleyes to be turning on. I'll find walleyes in deeper water off humps and will find pike in slightly shallower water. Pike eat lots of walleyes during this time. During my stay the pike will hit my walleye several times when I'm bringing one in. It's not unusual to find big pike in pods. Miss one, catch another. Catch one, catch another. They hang around.Somebody will shoot down my thinking and maybe come up with a good suggestion. .................................................. .................................................. ......Back to the hatch. Walleyes and whitefish will find the hatch. Huge pike will find walleyes and whitefish. Pike will gorge themselves and take off a few days after the hatch. They might be hugging a soft bottom, burping and allowing leaches to attach to their belly. Lakes with an abundance of fat whitefish will usually hold big pike. Whitefish are great food for pike.Fishing for numbers of walleyes and lots of big pike has been good, for me, from around July 15 to August 25. It's my favorite time to fish, along with May, June, September and first 3 weeks of October."
5569081,prov1800,2017-05-25 08:36:00,5010,the hatch is a good thing not a bad thing.if your scared of it go find colder water.wont be any flies there.some of the best fishing is in the mayfly hatch just have to fish a bit diff.but they are hungry and aggressive.need to take advantage of that situation.
5569105,wmd,2017-05-25 08:45:00,388,Unless it's giving away trade secrets how do you fish wall eyes during the hatch? I have experienced it once and didn't get it figured out. Thanks prov1800 I enjoy reading your posts. wmd
5569113,Fisher-man,2017-05-25 08:46:00,422,"Prov...mind sharing what ""a bit diff"" is? I have run into that !X#$%W#$!!!..ing hatch too many times and it has always made fishing really tough. I won't fish the shield lakes the first two weeks of June because of it. I love that time of year, but we have not enjoyed that experience. The walleye you do catch are puking buckets of bug larvae, and it feels like they took your bait only because it hit them on the nose! And I certainly haven't found the fish aggressive during that 4-5 days that the hatch lasts."
5569401,eyegator,2017-05-25 10:12:00,29,"That scenario is exactly my fear. Prov- I'd be interested in hearing your tips and tactics as well.Between that, and how much everyone loves fall trips- I might just go up in September next year."
