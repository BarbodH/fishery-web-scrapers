5611417,rzep,2017-06-15 05:58:00,1196,Are double hook spinners or single with trailing one legal in Ontario.. ? Recall reading something while back ..
5611633,deadhead1,2017-06-15 07:31:00,193,"I use trailers on a jig for walleye when they are stealing minnows so I hope the are legal! As far as I know you are allowed two or maybe even three hooks per rig, same as two hooks that would be on a plug."
5611641,Ricky Spanish,2017-06-15 07:33:00,1298,"You can have up to three hooks on one lure/line in the Kenora area of ON. It may be different elsewhere. Double ten buck tails usually have two treble hooks, and large cranks usually have three trebles, so I don't think a trailer hook or a stinger would be any different."

As far as I know you are allowed two or maybe even three hooks per rig, same as two hooks that would be on a plug. Update----Ontario regs say ""A fishing lure must not have more than four four hooks attached"""

5612385,rzep,2017-06-15 12:47:00,1196,Follow up..... When would you use single trailing hook as opposed to treble one? Just personal preference or more to it?
5617617,The tank,2017-06-19 03:41:00,340,Not sure how old my book is but it reads 4 hooks on one line in Ontario. We haven't used trailing hooks for 20 years but when we did we had a small treble on jigs and minnow and single #4 on worm harness when using worms. Now days I don't use any. If I buy a spinner harness with 2 hooks I cut the back one off and save it. If you don't cut it off a snot rockets going to bite it off sooner or later.
