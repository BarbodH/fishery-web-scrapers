From Pennsylvania, I would have to drive many hours north to get into walleye fishing that, from what I read here, doesn't compare to NW ONTARIO. I find some reasonably priced flights from Pittsburgh to Thunder Bay, and would probably rent a car there and drive - in. I'm interested in numbers of walleye, and a comfortable cabin/ boat. Any suggestions welcome. Sent from my SM-J727V using Tapatalk"

They also have beautiful cabins and they maintain their boats very well. It is a conservation lake, so you can only keep 2 walleyes a day to eat and no fish can be taken home. Give them a call and I promise you won't be disappointed. http://www.holinshead.ca/"
