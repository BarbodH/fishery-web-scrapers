5610945,adventureIII,2017-06-14 19:50:00,25,I'm thinking about going to Manitoba with a pickup camper and my boat for a couple of weeks. Any suggestions on places to go from Minot ND.

5611089,h8go4s,2017-06-14 20:59:00,1673,"Reed Lake. Provincial park campground on the lake with 2-lane boat ramp and nice fish cleaning house. Pit toilets, solar shower (brrrr), solar powered well. We used to go the first week in June, when the pike were in the shallow bays. We caught pike, walleyes, lakers and whitefish all in the same areas at times.Pike in the 40""+ range are common. My biggest in 4 trips was 47-1/2. Unfortunately that group fell apart due to illnesses. We talked to groups who had been going there for years, even some from NoDak.http://www.gov.mb.ca/sd/parks/pdf/ma...campground.pdfIf you scroll through this forum, there are some old posts on Reed that will get your blood pumping:http://www.xtremesportfishing.com/fo...wforum.php?f=1Save"

5611473,GBS,2017-06-15 06:16:00,2271,"+2 on Reed Lake - we stayed at the lodge right next to the park (Grass River Lodge). Several mid-40's northern every day, my best was a 52 incher (!) Walleyes were easy for shore lunch. Great roads all the way. Note that it is pretty far from any services, so keep your gas tank full. You might even want to stop by the Lodge and ask Ike, the owner, if he can add you to one of his daily fly-outs to a remote lake, if you need to have a 50-100 walleye day."

5611585,eyegator,2017-06-15 06:59:00,29,"Also- further up the road near Flin Flon- there are some nice places along Amisk Lake to camp-- very nice Pike fishing in that lake- great walleye fishing too, I just haven't gotten around to trying other than for shore lunch.If you cross just into the Saskatchewan side- I have stayed at T&D Amisk cabins on Amisk. It's about 45 min drive south of Flin Flon down a well maintained gravel road. There is a river that feeds into the lake right there."

5620170,FishinRod,2017-06-20 06:36:00,10,"I live in Manitoba and you cant go wrong with any of those places, I like the Reed lake choice as it is dead center of some amazing Fishing within driving distance. Clearwater Lake to the south is absolutely stunning lake to be on with water clarity in the 25-30 foot range. Kississing lake to the north. If I were you I would stop at Assessippi provincial park on Lake of the prairies for some walleye fishing then drive the 4 hours north to clearwater for some Lakers. Another 1.5 hours to Reed and go from there.. Rod"
