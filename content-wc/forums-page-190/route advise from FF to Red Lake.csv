Plus there are towns you drive through in case of car trouble. The way people drive on 502 - which is already a road requiring complete concentration on driving - just scares us. Just our opinion. PS - would not advise taking 502 at night. The amount of moose we used to see at night was an eye opener!"

There have been the occasional small construction projects,but nothing of significance in terms of delays. The 105 up to Red Lake is also a good road all the way. If you have a few moments, pull over at the Wabigoon River and take some pictures. It is only 20-30 minutes north on 105 after you turn off of 17 in Vermilion Bay. Pretty cool sight. There is a pull off on the southbound side of 105. PjShorthorn"
5615953,The tank,2017-06-17 20:38:00,340,I like to take trans Canada 71. I think it 28 miles farther and 15-20 minutes longer. With construction on 502 it's probably faster now.
5616161,Wedge,2017-06-18 05:45:00,270,"Just drove down 502 yesterday from Dryden to FF. The construction crews were out on our trip up and it might have slowed us a total of 10 minutes on the trip. On the way home, they werent even out there. We were driving on 502 from 7:30 - 9:30ish. They are replacing culverts in the road,so there is a rough patch every so often for about a 10 mile stretch. If you slow down for em, they arent bad. There is another post about how bad it is on here, and people losing trailers, etc. I went up thinking it was going to be bad, but it really wasnt a big deal. If you are looking for a scenic route to kill time, I guess you can take the long way around. For me, I would rather spend that extra half each way fishing..."

The road is in great condition, very minimal slow downs for construction and the road from Vermillion Bay to Ear Falls is in great shape. You will see some moose depending on time of day and we also saw a bear."
