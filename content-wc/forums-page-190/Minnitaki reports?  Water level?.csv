Due to the cooler temps, we caught a lot of fish in 12' or less. Water levels seemed fine to me, but I am no expert. I have not been to Butterfly Lake, so I can't comment on that. We usually stay in the arm and go to Lyons Bay and surrounding areas. We were too early to go to Red Pine and Southwest Bays this year.Hope this helps!Sportfisher"
