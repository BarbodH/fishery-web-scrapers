You can also use berkley powertubes on 1/2 to 1 oz jigheads. Get yourself some shiners and salt them down for bait and your set to go. Where are you headed up to? We usually go up to the Atikokan, Ontario area tho had a good outing on lower manitou in january. Good Luck, they can get addicting, they can really fight!! Xplorer"
