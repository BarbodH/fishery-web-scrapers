I've spent quite a few hours with him surfing the internet and various forums to help us make a choice. Some considerations were: American plan or at least evening meal plan, cost (around $600 for American plan for 6 days or $700 for 7 days based on this year prices), a fishing lodge (no waterskiers, etc), hot water and showers in cabin, and quality fishing. We have currently narrowed our choices to South Shore Lodge on Eagle Lake, KCR Camp on Winnipeg River near junction with English river, Timberlane Lodge on Lac Seul, and Wawang Lake Resort on Wawang Lake. I would appreciate any advice, suggestions, or recommendations that anyone could give me on these or similar lodges. Thank you."

511622,Guest,2001-03-22 12:16:00,0,"We'll predominantly be walleye fishing. I will probably convince my dad to do a day or day and a half of northern or muskie fishing. He likes crappie fishing which we do a lot of in WI. There aren't many places in Canada that seem to have them although I do know some people that caught some while at KCR last year. If a place doesn't have crappies, it isn't that big of a deal. They would only be a bonus."
