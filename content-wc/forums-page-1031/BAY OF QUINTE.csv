510934,Guest,2001-02-04 15:29:00,0,I WENT TO A SPORT SHOW THIS WEEKEND AND TALKED TO A FEW CANADAIN OUTFITTERS AND THEY COULD NOT ANSWER MY QUESTION ABOUT THE BAY . WE HAVE HEARD THAT THE INDAINS LEFT THEIR NETS IN THE WATER AND THEY FROOZE IN PLACE . SO THE WALLEYES CAN NOT COME IN FROM LAKE ONTARIO TO SPAWN IN THE SPRING.IS THIS TRUE?IF SO WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT GOING TO DO. IF THE WALLEYES CANT GET IN TO SPAWN THEY WILL GO SOME WHERE ELSE TO SPAWN. MAYBE IN THE U.S.OR HAY BAY. LIKE TO HEAR FROM SOME OF THE CANADAINS UP IN THE BAY . USED TO COME UP TO YOUR BUITFULL COUNTRY TO PLAY HOCKEY AND STAY WITH THE PEOPLE IN YOUR COUNTRY. THANKS

Any how there are not any areas where you could string a net accross shore to shore. It's a great place to live, i can see hay bay 200 yds. away. Opening day is only less than 90 DAYS AWAY!! Keep up on all the latest at www.quintefishing.com Check out the discussion board....larry"

This winter netting draws a great deal of concern and often of some vicious comments.There's nothing to indicate that nets will prevent fish from spawning. As Hay Bay Larry mentioned, go to www.quintefishing.comand check out the discussion board, it's been quite active of late.80 percent of the fish that spawn in Quinte don't spawn in rivers, they use points and rock shores.Hope that helps.David aka superdad"
510937,Guest,2001-02-06 16:45:00,0,"THANKS LARRY AND SUPERDAD FOR YOUR TIME AND INFORMATION. THE OUTFITTER WE TALKED TO SAID THERE WAS AN AREA THAT THE INDAINS OWN THAT IS SMALL ENOUGH TO PUT NETS IN . I PERSONALLY DONT KNOW , IT IS WHAT I WAS TOLD .WE LIVE IN NY (SYRACUSE) AND HOPE TO MAKE A COUPLE OF TRIPS THIS YEAR TO THE BAY.I AM GLAD TO HEAR FROM THE BOTH OF YOUS. WE HOPE THE FISHEN IS GOOD .THANK YOU AGAIN"
510938,Guest,2001-03-10 14:15:00,0,"I have given up on spring fishing the bay of Quinte.After 3 disapointing trips we have moved on to other areas.Overfishing,native netting and spearing spawning fish plus zeba mussels havetaken a toll.I watched natives spearing spawning walleye as the gamewardens stood by.This was on the Toronto news.Three bait andtackle shops closed in Bellville.I will miss the great days we had on the bay."
510939,fishhead,2001-03-22 16:54:00,48,"You peaple have to be kidding. If you think that a few natives are responsible for the fishing problems in the bay your nuts!!!You have to remember something there are more white guys poaching than there are natives all together. remeber just a few years back the comercial fishery operation that was wrongfully catching fish and selling them to the states and in turn back to us. This poaching is not my point. The fact still remains that the past three years the spawn was over or not large due to the lack of water on opening day. Not the metion of all the fish kill due to somehting else. I saw dead fish everywhere last spring. Bass large and small, pike, pics ,perch ,white bass minnows, carp ,catfish. All these fish didnt die in a net or on the end of a spear it was obviously something else. But what i dont know i think someone isnt telling the whole truth"
