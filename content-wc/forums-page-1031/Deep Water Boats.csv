511579,Guest,2001-03-20 10:30:00,0,Has anyone heard of Deep Water Boats. If so what are they suppose to be like. The Alumacraft dealer where I am has a 1684 side console with a 115 yamaha on it for sale I'm considering. He claims a couple of guys from the Lund factory in Stienbach started this company a couple of years ago
511580,River_eye,2001-03-21 14:31:00,1486,"The brand was bought out by lund a couple years ago. I've never heard anything bad about them. Their hull quality is good, although I think they lack the fit and finish of some other brands. If it's the type of boat you're looking for, and it looks good, and the price is right, go for it. Although, don't expect to see many of them around.River eye"
