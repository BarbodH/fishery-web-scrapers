511598,Guest,2001-03-21 08:42:00,0,While at the Sportsmans show recently I picked up a boating guide/regulations pamphlet for Canada (1999 version) in which I noticed two items people should be aware of.1. The requirement for a rope with a floating device on the end which is a specific length based on the length of your boat. I think for a typical fishing boat it was 15M. I have not seen these in US stores but will be on the lookout or pick one up in Ontario.2. The requirement for a manual bailing device for fishing boats which is either a bailing device (clorox bottle with the bottom cut our type) or a manual bilge pump. The bottle is OK only for boats without floors so this indicates we need to have a manual bilge pump on board of the typical fishing boat.Can our friends from north of the boarder comment on these or any other items we should be aware of which are not the law in the US?Thanks

This is off the top of my head, can't find the info right now to confirm.a paddle, (2 is better), manual bailer, casting rope with floation, a horn/sound device, life jackets for each person.I also believe that charts have to be carried for the waters your in, especially on rivers, and a survival kit consisting of fresh water, matches and I think blankets.The rules keep changing, the people at the local boat show indicated that getting a operators card may get more expensive pretty soon. With something likw 6.5 million watercraft in Canada(population 30 million or so)I think our gov't is seeing a cash cow.I'm not sure if the regs affect visiting boats, but it never hurts to be prepared."
511600,Guest,2001-03-21 23:49:00,0,"The law in Ontario and the rest of Canada is that your boat has to meet your States Boating regulations from where it is registered and not the Canadian regulations. Life jackets are mandatory to have in your boat and they must be the proper size for the occupants. Check out the Canadian Coast Guard site at www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca for the complete regulations. This is an excerpt from their web page;MINIMUM EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR PLEASURECRAFTApplication16. (1) Subject to subsection (2), this Part applies in respect of every pleasure craft that is operated in Canada.(2) This Part does not apply in respect of a pleasure craft that is operated in Canada if it is ordinarily kept in a country other than Canada and it complies with any licensing, registration and equipment requirements of that country. I hope this helps and enjoy your trip to Canada!"
