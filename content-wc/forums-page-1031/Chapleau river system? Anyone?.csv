We had a good week of fishing...when the weather was stable, the fish cooperated. We caught walleye...the largest was 20"" but certainly enough quantity for a couple a shoremeals, plenty of small n.p. ...nothing over 3#, got into some jumbo perch (up to 14"") toward the end of the week. Be sure to find out about the rock hazards before you venture out...I'm glad we rented a boat & motor. Would go back again. Good Luck!"
