510870,Guest,2001-02-08 18:15:00,0,Yes.
510871,Guest,2001-02-11 10:50:00,0,We can only count to 12 here in Saskatchewan here so i guess thats why our case is only 12 ;) My mistake.
510872,Guest,2001-02-12 13:51:00,0,"Sometimes when I reflect back on all the beer I drink, I feel ashamed. Then I look into the glass and think about the workers in the brewery and all of their hopes and dreams. If I did not drink this beer, they might be out of work and their dreams would be shattered. Then I say to myself,""It is better that I drink this beer and let their dreams come true than be selfish and worry about my liver."""
510873,Guest,2001-02-12 13:57:00,0,"The remark about the Maximum beer inducing ill side effects reminds me of another quote a wise man once said. It was, ""I feel sorry for people who do not drink. When they wake up in the morning that is as good as they are going to feel all day.""I before E except in Budweiser........Cheers!"
510874,Guest,2001-02-12 14:15:00,0,Thats one of Homer Simpsons sayings. He is a very wise man.
510875,IaCraig,2001-02-12 15:40:00,434,"I think Homer Simpson may have stole that saying from W.C. Fields. While both these characters do make me chuckle, Wise men I think they are not! Winston Churchill was known for similar quotes. One I recall was a reply he made to some high society lady who criticised him for drinking excessively 1 night. While not verbatim, it went something like this: ""Madam, it is true that tonight I have been drinking, however I shall be sober in the morning. While you on the otherhand will still be an ugly snob"" Cabin fever go away!IaCraig"
510876,Guest,2001-02-12 16:57:00,0,"No it was Frank Sinatra that made that quote before Homer Simpson. Winston Churchill made a quote that went,""Always remember that I have taken more out of alcohol than alcohol has taken out of me."" W.C. Fields made some famous quotes like,""A woman drove me to drink and I didn't even have the decency to thank her."" I believe he also said,""What contemptible scoundrel has stolen the cork to my lunch? ""Heck what else do we have to do? Might as well cite some other famous quotes.""When we drink, we get drunk. When we get drunk, we fall asleep. When we fall asleep, we commit no sin. When we commit no sin, we go to heaven. Sooooo, let's all get drunk and go to heaven!"" -- Brian O'RourkeBen Franklin once said,""Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy.""Henny Youngman said,""When I read about the evils of drinking, I gave up reading."" I think that is enough for now.....well maybe one more anonymous quote,""Reality is an illusion that occurs due to lack of alcohol.""I have more but I need something to do tomorrow too.Beer me."
510877,Guest,2001-02-12 17:51:00,0,Everything in Moderation does a wise man make. Very good quotes there Buck.
510878,Guest,2001-02-14 09:25:00,0,"Here's one for today. ""24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case. Coincidence? I think not!"" -- Pepe SotoAnd forgot yesterday's,""If you ever reach total enlightenment while drinking beer, I bet itmakes beer shoot out your nose.""--Jack HandyI before E except in Budweiser................."
510863,Swede,2001-03-20 23:20:00,17,"jvfisherman is right: it's a loooong winter. We can't take beer where we go, so settle on the next best thing - Irish Mist in Nalgene bottles. Oh, the sacrifices we endure!One of my college buddies used to tell me that he never drank a little beer, but a whole bunch at once."
510859,Guest,2001-02-02 19:29:00,0,"Is there such as thing as Blue Light? I swear I had some years ago in Canada but folks tell me there is no such thing. I don't think it was ""light - less calories"". I think it was ""light - less alcohol content"" ???"

510865,Scott,2001-02-06 08:17:00,385,"I have a family member who now resides in Guelph, Ontario. There is a small family owned brewery located ther by the name of Sleeman's. They have the best tasting Canadian Beer I have ever had. The price I can not tell you, but it is worth it. The Honey Amber is my top choice."
510866,Guest,2001-02-07 12:59:00,0,Beer in sask is $15.50 thats for one dozen. I dont know where everybody is getting $30/ case of beer ouch!!!
510867,IaCraig,2001-02-07 15:34:00,434,"Well, to me a carton of beer/soda 12 cans, Case of beer/soda 24 cans. Your price comes to an OUCH too! ;-)IaCraig;-)"
510868,Guest,2001-02-07 16:03:00,0,We get 24 in a case in Ontario. In Reform Land I understand a case is 12.
510861,Guest,2001-02-08 15:49:00,0,Yes there is a light and it is less alcohol content stick with blue
510869,Wild Bill,2001-02-08 18:03:00,64,Question:DO THEY STILL MAKE LABATT'S 50 ALE?
510849,Guest,2001-01-31 17:58:00,0,Planning my budget for my summer trip. Anyone have a quick price on a case of say Labatt's over the border?Thanks
510850,BD,2001-01-31 19:34:00,739,"I can't remember the exact price we paid but if you want Blue buy it at the exchange shop at the border. It's a lot cheaper there. You will need to declare it when going through the checkpoint but you can get in with one case duty free just like U.S. suds. Don't try to sneak any extra over the border. If you get checked, CONFISCATION! Then you can buy replacements and every time you cross over after that you will be torn down. No this is not from personal experience! One guy I fish with got caught years ago and has been good ever since. He still gets torn down every time he crosses the border.""An angler is a man who spends rainy days sitting around on the muddy banks of rivers doing nothing because his wife won't let him do it at home."" --- Irish saying"
510851,River_eye,2001-01-31 20:57:00,1486,"Cases are around $32, can.River eye"
510852,Guest,2001-02-01 12:41:00,0,"Yes, I wouldn't plan on buying too much beer in Canada, it is pretty expensive around $30 or more. Try some Labatt's Maximum Ice (7.7% alc.) then you won't have to buy so much!!"
510854,Guest,2001-02-01 13:14:00,0,A word of the wise to our southern neighbours.........Don't buy your beer at the border. They sell all the old stuff us good guys and gees don't want there. Get the good stuff from a brewers retail. You'll save a few bucks at the border but you're drinking our second rate stuff.
510853,Guest,2001-02-01 13:18:00,0,Maximum Ice is not beer. Blue or Canadian is beer. All the drunks at the lake have one thing in common with their ice beer. Read up on beer brewing and you'll find that the additional percentage induces esters and fusil oils into the beer. That gives you the headaches. Get a good clean 4 or 5% and have another beer if you so wish. Stay away from the head banger stuff. Yuck!!!!!!!
510855,hoghunter,2001-02-01 17:16:00,159,It's all good.
510856,Guest,2001-02-01 19:34:00,0,BRING YOUR OWN BEER PAY THE DUTY AND DRINK REAL BEER LIKE THE KING OF BEERS BUDWEISER THIS NORTHERN IS FOR YOU.
510857,eyedoktr,2001-02-02 04:20:00,2426,"I don't care if it is ""old"" beer, it's still better than what we get here in the states. I have found it significantly cheaper to buy as much as you want at the border and pay the duty on anything over a case, than it is to buy it at the ""Beer Store"". I have done this a number of times and occasionally they have let me go through without the duty fees if I'll be in Canada a while."
510858,IaCraig,2001-02-02 10:07:00,434,"Hey Big-K, Buy at the border, I think last year it was $12.00 duty free per case. (the year before I know it was on special for 9:00) Just curious Big-K. If you have to budget for beer, does that mean your budget is real tight???? Or do you plan to drink bunches & bunches of beer????IaCraig"
