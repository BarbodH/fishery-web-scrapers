511669,BGunn,2001-03-25 01:32:00,880,"Most likely because you don't know what else is in the water with your minnows. Parasites, zebra mussels, or one of the ""minnows"" could be other than what you think it is. That happends allot more than you would think.Same Law in Ontario."

By and large, live minnows are taboo, even if you should happen to catch your bait in the same lake in which you fish. From what I understand, the objective is to reduce the mortality rate of released fish. Catch and release is strongly urged and it looks like possession limits will eventually be adjusted downward, as well. Bring lures and a camera!"

If things haven't changed I believe they are allowed in some places such as St Lawrence though. Just check the regs if you come.The official reason is, as mentionned, to stop the spread of undesirables. However, I think the hidden reason is so we don't catch as many fish. I have never seen anyone else release a walleye longer than 10"" here."
