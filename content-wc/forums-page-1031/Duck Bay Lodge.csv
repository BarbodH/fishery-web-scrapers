I am interested in any comments about the lodge and especially the fishing in the area during this time of year. I am especially interested in the walleye action and the size of the fish in the area. Thanks, Carey"

Good luck"

They really know what your trip is all about, and make sure you are prepared and have a good time. Lots of knowledge of where they are biting. Duck Bay is near lots of big water and a ton of structure and shoreline to fish. I've caught eaters to about 7 lbs. Structure to fish varies on how the weather has been. usually around 12ft that time of the year."
