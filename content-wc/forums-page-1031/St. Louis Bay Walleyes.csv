How do they fish it, is it fishable from shore, any other species there ie. loopers, coho? Are the fish edible? any info would be appreciated. Thanks"
511588,Guest,2001-03-20 19:18:00,0,Dano oh you betcha. Fishing can be real good. Just watch the weather it can get rough this time of year. I hear the best fishing is determined by the barometer. Fishing anytime though is good. Don't know to much about these other species you mention. Sounds unlikely. Well Dano good luck.Viva la Carp Lon

511591,hoghunter,2001-03-22 09:22:00,159,"Hey Porter, Yes there is wonderfull walleye fishing on the river. I put many hours down there in the spring and early summer months. I like to drift with floaters w/crawlers or leeches. Also when the bite gets aggressive, I use bottom bouncers and spinners w/crawlers and leeches. There are spots along the river to fish, and produce well also, using an egg sinker and floater. The spots are located mostly from Gary on up to the dam. Two poles are allowed on the river being that is boundry waters. I have had many great outings out there. You cannot keep anything under 15"" and only two in possesion. I strictly catch and release all fish. There is an advisory like so many other bodies of water, but I would not hesitate eating any fish under 2lbs. There are also big sturgeon and muskies as well as northern in the river. Crappies and smallies also. Carp, and many other roughfish. Not to mention river ruffies, lol. If you have a boat to take, look where the boats are. If not, find a spot on the river and throw out a hook. Any questions, just ask. Good luck."
511592,Xplorer,2001-03-22 10:30:00,244,"Porterlover, Ditto to what hoghunter said. I started fishing it about 4 years ago and still have alot to learn. Boy Scout landing is popular but very busy. There are quite a few areas along Hwy 23 to fish from shore. Also right below the 23 bridge there are a couple of residential streets that run along the river that folks bank fish from, and can be good early in the season. Egg sinker and floater are standard fair. I have had alot of success by boat the last 2 years pulling shallow plugs in the river, even in May. Last year tried some little rippers with good sucess. Expect to catch a northern or smallie once in awhile. You won't find any coho or loopers in the river, if you want to cast for coho try the end of the canal park breakwall (on the park point side)starting the end of this month. Loopers are hitting right now at the french,lester and stony point. The river is a great multi-species fishery, never know what will be at the end of your line!! Have a good one. Xplorer"
