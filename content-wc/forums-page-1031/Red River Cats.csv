For now I would say the Red is the undisputed channel cat fishery on the world. All of the Red, not just the cat's that say ""EH"". :)Backwater Eddy"

Wow is the only thing I can say.Wish I had that in my backyard. Don't you hate it when your fishing partner won't blow off some dumb 'prior engagement' to stay out there when they're biting?"
511541,Backwater Eddy,2001-03-25 04:13:00,3871,Yup you know your into serous catfish when your partner needs to lay down on the front deck for a nap by noon because he is too wore out from cranking in the piggie's!:) Backwater Eddy
511528,Guest,2001-03-18 11:43:00,0,"I am looking at heading up to the Red by Winnipeg, can you guys give me some good places to stay in the area. Also where is most of the catfishing done. What is the best time of the year to come up there for numbers and big ones? Do they bite all day and night? Also is there a walleye run in the spring like in the fall or not? Thanks for your help."
511529,Guest,2001-03-18 12:57:00,0,"The best time to hit for cats is the mid-may to end of June. Mid June being the best time, usually. Having said that it all depends on water flow etc. The rest of the summer is also good, but the best time is June. No there isn't really a spring run on walleyes, they are normally back out into the lake by the time our season re-opens. All of the ""hot"" cat action is from the locks in Lockport Mb. then heading north on the river. The locks are great, so is the mouth where the floodway enters the river. Again, all depends on water etc. Bring some good gear, these fish are tackle busters ! Also bring a camera & please release all them biggies ! Good place to stay, about 10 mins south of Lockport is the Rivercrest Motel. Safe,secure,quiet,beverage room. Their # is (204)339-7968.Good FishenRiver Dudethanks to rtmg for letting me use his 'puter......"
511530,Guest,2001-03-19 08:39:00,0,"Best time for size and numbers I have found is the entire month of June. I would still consider July and early August to be great...but if I had to pick a month it would be June.Best spots are located close to the Lockport Dam so I would suggest to launch at Cats on the Red which is only 30 seconds to 1 minute away from the most popular cat holes.In my experience - early morning and 5pm till dusk are my most productive times....just have to worry about he mosquitos finding you if you want to push it past dusk.Accomodations can be found at Cats on the Red in Lockport and a number of Hotels/Motels in the town of Selkirk. If you launch in Selkirk it is a 10minute boat ride to Lockport.Bait - Frozen Chicken Livers, Frozen Shrimp (Jumbo's) and cutbait if you can get out for some evening goldeye."
511531,gofish,2001-03-19 17:52:00,24,"I remember as a kid how people, my father included, used to think any fish with whiskers was nothing but trash....something to be left on the bank to rot. As I got older, and started fishing on my own, I used to catch these monsters without even tryin' to, often while fishing for saugers on light tackle. Boy, what a rush!! That was in the early eighties. It was at that time people started thinking differently about our resources. I imagine, magazines like In-Fisherman helped start this trend. Thankfully, Manitoba has some of the most progressive fishing laws in the entire North American continent. Having said that, all channel catfish in Manitoba exceeding 24 inches in length must be released back into the water unharmed. If you fish from a boat (although bank fisherman do very well)its impossible to not catch channel cats in the 18 - 25 lb class. I'm not kidding, the fishing is really that good. The carpin"" ain't bad either!"
511532,Backwater Eddy,2001-03-20 03:59:00,3871,"The Red from the headwaters region to Canada has great catfishing all season, not just June. Starting in May the headwaters end of the Red is hot for 5-20 lb cats and then it rolls up the red as a hot bite. The water temp and forage is the key.The quantity of huge channel cats on the Lockport end of the Red is unbelievable tell you fish it! June & August is my best times to head North to play piggy tag with the 20-30's. The catfishing is fairly consistent with the exception of the spawning period, that is a tough bite time. The best catfish for eating come from the headwaters region and it's tributaries into the Red. Less contaminants and higher water quality make for a better meal. Unfortunately the farther up the Red you go the more the contaminants build in the fatty tissues of all fish and precautions must be made while cleaning and preparing them. The levels are low but still there. From Wahpeton USA to Lockport Canada there are a lot of catfish & walleye.Backwater Eddy"
511533,Guest,2001-03-20 15:45:00,0,This sounds great guys. Now I have a few more questions. What time of year/ water temp do the cats spawn at up there. Also are the cats in the same spots all summer? Do you guys ussualy fish the holes? How deep? Do you fish in the holes or above the holes? Also what about these carp. I love carp fishing. Are they in the same spots as the cats. How about size? Thanks again and keep the comments comming
511534,Guest,2001-03-20 16:02:00,0,"Studies have done that the cats spawn in the shallow lakes/ponds south of Lake Winnipeg. The fishing season up here is closed from 1 April to 15 May(or there abouts).I believe that the ""Cats on the Red"" fishing derby is 16-18 of Aug. Saw an ad for it, usually the derby is in Sept. entry fee is $250 Cdn(or so it was) per boat max of 2 rods per boat and open to about 100 boats I believe. Something to keep in mind I guess.Have caught the odd carp, on a pickeral rig no less, but I don't specifically fish for them. Fair size too. Mind you a 24"" inch fresh water drum can snap your rod over pretty good."
511536,Guest,2001-03-20 18:00:00,0,"John,lake Mille Lacs has much better carp fishing than the Red, but if you are looking for big cats then I recommend Rainy lake, not the numbers you would expect but definately huge ones if you can catch them.good luck"
511537,gofish,2001-03-20 18:08:00,24,"You've got to kidding.....right? Hey Eddy, back me up on this one!"
511538,Guest,2001-03-21 07:14:00,0,"The poster must be suffering spring fever. Tough to beat the Red River. Ask yourself this question ""Why does In-Fish always shoot programs on the Red, & never these other mentioned places ? "" (for cats & carp of course...)Good FishenRiver Dude"
