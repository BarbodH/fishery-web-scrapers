511604,Guest,2001-03-21 19:28:00,0,I rec. a free fishing package to naughty pines from the MN-Walleye expo. Just wondering if anyone has fished this resort and your thoughts. It is located on the english river- and encompasses 7 lakes. any reports good or bad would be greatly appreciated. If you would rather e-mail me feel free. They havent booked up for the year yet so thought that was a little suspect. Looking forward to your responses and thanks in advance.

511606,Guest,2001-03-22 09:35:00,0,"I must admit I was taken in by the ""two for one offer"" for Naughty Pines. Even with their offer the cost for one was comparable with the cost for two elsewhere. That being said I had a great time at Naughty Pines. It might be because it was my sons first trip to Canada with me but I think not. We caught a good amount of fish, fished some good water and the experience was alot of fun. I took a nice 42"" musky off Samatha's rock. Good fishing!"
511607,Guest,2001-03-22 16:03:00,0,"I recieved the same free offer and it cost me 700 dollars and I left after one night. Poor cabin, 8 dollar bags of ice, lousy food, no radio phone for emergencies, no docks for your boats, no electric hookup.Do your self a favor and skip this one.Seriously,Mack"
511608,ggg,2001-03-22 17:50:00,115,I talk to a lot of fishermen and they all won a trip to thisplace. Some other lodge owners and fishermen told me a lotof people are boycotting this place due to disceptiveadvertising practices. I know I won't go there even thoughmy son and I each won a (FREE ? ) trip.
