565741,FishTwentyFourSeven,2007-05-31 11:37:00,38,FishTwentyFourSeven I will be up there in a few weeks and am writing to see if anyone has heard of or has first hand knowledge of how the fishing and water levels have been in this area. thanks in advance.
565745,Guest,2007-05-31 12:49:00,0,"I've fished just east of that area on the English river around 25 times. The fishing is excellent. There are a lot of islands and it's easy to get turned around, if you don't have a guide, I'd recommend bringing a GPS with. As far as the fishing goes, depending on when you are going, it seems like anywhere there is cabbage weed you'll find fish. Also anywhere with current, a waterfall or a stream flowing in have historically been very good spots. Walleyes are abundant with an ample supply of big eyes. We mainly jig and back troll for eyes, but catch at least five to ten 35 plus inch northern every year by accident. You should have a lot of fun. Last year was one of our slowest years because of a huge mayfly hatch and we still caught 50 or more fish/day/boat."
565747,FishTwentyFourSeven,2007-05-31 13:00:00,38,"FishTwentyFourSeven we usually go in July but are forced to go in June this year. How do the two months compare? What is the norm for big eyes in these waters? We usually max out around 25"" but not much over that. Should I be expecting bigger walleye around these parts?"
565767,Guest,2007-06-01 06:24:00,0,"In a typical year our group will catch multiple walleye over 25 inches. That part of the English River holds some very big walleye and northern. Of course it's fishign and we've had years for whatever reason we didn't catch as many big ones, like last year, but most years have been good to great fishing. From my experience on this water June is a better month than July. I've fished in both months multiple times and June is a more consistent bite. I'll be up there June 20th this year but as I mentioned we fish a little east of where you'll be."

566033,garslayer,2007-06-06 22:52:00,3,Jebwi-am coming up from Wisconsin in a week and am staying at Sep Lake lodge. Fished upstream in Oak Lake at an outpost last year and did well. Question is: how bad are the rocks in Separation or Lount? I'm trying to decide if it's worthwhile buying insurance from the lodge. Had no problems last year. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Good luck when you go! - Garslayer
