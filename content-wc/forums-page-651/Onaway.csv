565889,Heff,2007-06-03 18:51:00,102,My group is heading to Onaway on 6-14. Has anyone been there this year? Any fishing reports?
565897,Guest,2007-06-03 21:37:00,0,"Have not been up yet, but talked to Blair last week. Water was down but on it's way up due to the recent rains. He also said the fishing has been very good, despite the weather. From opening day blizzards to days that have hit the 80's it's been a wierd spring but it hasn't effected the fishing much. Good Luck and leave some for me, I will be there July 13, packed and ready to go."
565930,Guest,2007-06-04 12:32:00,0,Did blair say what their catching them on?
565934,NateW,2007-06-04 14:25:00,96,"Onaway is a great lodge, you will enjoy yourselves. There are plenty of posts here about what is being caught, where and with what. I think 90% of the walleyes on LS are caught on jigs and/or spinners. Chartruese has always been a good color for us although I am sure somebody will step up to say they do better on something else. Be sure to ask if you can help feed the fish. They'll know what you mean and you'll be glad you asked. Steve, we'll be there the same week as you, July 13 - 21."
565985,Guest,2007-06-05 15:22:00,0,Nate...we will be in the new cabin where the old 2 man used to sit. I will have some Kokanee on ice. I can't hardly stand the wait. 38 days and counting.
565987,Heff,2007-06-05 15:53:00,102,"Steve, What is Kokanee?"
565988,joeman79,2007-06-05 15:55:00,417,BEER!! MMMMMM Good Beer
565992,waleht,2007-06-05 18:14:00,132,I will 2nd that!!!! Great beer made in BC. You can pick up a case or two at the LCBO in Vermillion bay or Dutchies on 105. I was at wabaskang last week and paid $37.25 (cdn) for a case. FYI the LCBO in Vermillion has the beer in a walk in cooler. Most of the case beer at Dutchies is warm. Brent
565997,NateW,2007-06-05 19:20:00,96,"Hm. Kokanee. You know, I've never been a big fan of Kokanee I'm more of a Molson guy. (Actually I prefer Capital's Wisconsin Amber--which I bet you are familiar with!) Not sure which cabin we'll be in this year, we keep getting moved around. Last year we were on the end next to the really big cabin. We'll be the gthe cabin with the pirate flag flying out front. (Pirate flag = long story.) There will be four of us. I'll be the guy at the controls of a Red Tracker tiller."
