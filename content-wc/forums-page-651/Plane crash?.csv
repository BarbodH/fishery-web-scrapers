566008,Guest,2007-06-06 06:03:00,0,"Billy, how's the fishing on Gullrock? It's a Alumacraft 185 with a 150hp Yamaha 4 stroke. Firt boat with a streering wheel in 13 years. Have you heard from Mike and Carol lately? It's not my boat it's Malinda's boat"
566016,Guest,2007-06-06 12:02:00,0,"sounds like a dandy boat for the guiding business. I'll keep an eye out for you whenever I get mine in the water. I've heard the fishing is great, haven't had a chance to go yet, bummer eh! No messages from mikey, just the odd joke on the email side of the computer, but I've heard they have a couple weddings coming up in their family so I suppose they are busy with those."
565608,2746,2007-05-26 21:15:00,3206,While at Gullrock this past week we heard second handed that a floatplane out of Red Lake went down killing the pilot and one passenger. Anyone know anything about it or was it just a rumor?
565609,Guest,2007-05-26 22:31:00,0,"Yes, a plane owned by Chimo Air crashed in Miller Lake on its way to roderick lake. the pilot, a 22 year old kid was killed and the passenger who was a tourist from Germany was injured. I understand that the search and rescue unit from the armed forces parachuted in to rescue the survivor. A second plane crashed on the same weekend in McGregor Lake just south of eagle lake in vermillion bay. the plane in this incident was a pa12 piper cub and both occupants spent a night in the bush but were unharmed. They were rescued in the morning after the crash by a local tourist camp owner and his son when the search started at 6:30 in the morning after they went missing."
565611,Skylane,2007-05-27 06:44:00,101,"Tackleman, I heard on the radio about a Piper out of Eagle Lake went down but no one was injured, they did not say it was a Super Cub. Were they local? What happened? Thanks. Steve"
565614,515,2007-05-27 09:35:00,254,"I was reading the article on the cbc site and the first accident with the pilot being killed happened at 12 midnight. I didn't think they flew in the dark and made water landings. Here is the article on that one from the CBC site: 1 killed, 1 injured in Ontario plane crash One person has died and another received serious injuries when a small plane crashed in northern Ontario Thursday night, prompting a dramatic rescue mission out of Winnipeg. The Cessna 180 float plane was on its way to a northern camp near Woodland Caribou Provincial Park when it went down near Red Lake around midnight. A Winnipeg-based transport and rescue squadron was alerted shortly after the plane crashed. But a thunderstorm delayed the rescue operation, forcing the crew to return to Winnipeg for a helicopter. When the search resumed, the float plane was found around 5 a.m. near Miller Lake. When rescuers arrived on the scene, they did not expect to find anyone alive, Warrant Officer Bryan Pierce said Friday, but one man, the plane's passenger, did survive ""It took us three hours just to get him out of the airplane. We had to cut the fuselage away and peel the seat back,"" Pierce said. ""It was not an easy job to get him out, but the will to survive was there. He'd been on the ground a long time. A very strong, strong gentleman."" The survivor, a 37-year-old German man, was airlifted to Winnipeg for treatment. The pilot, 22-year-old Kyle Knobelsdorf of Huntsville, Ont., died. here is a sort article on the other crash that both survived from a Kenora website"" 2 Men Rescued After Float Plane Crash Wednesday May 23 07 The occupants of a piper float plane have been found uninjured after going missing monday. The 2 failed to return from a trip near Eagle Lake. The men were spotted Tuesday morning on the shore of Mcgregor Lake southwest of Vermilion Bay. The plane had difficulties during takeoff and crashed into the lake. The men were able to swim ashore, where they spent the night."
565617,Guest,2007-05-27 14:42:00,0,The guys that crashed at eagle lake were from the US. one of them has a cabin on the west arm and his passenger was from Texas. Don't know which state the pilot is from.
565618,2746,2007-05-27 16:57:00,3206,Thanks for the reply. A tough way to start the season!
565620,fishmaster,2007-05-27 18:40:00,209,"Seen the plane that was crashed on McGregor Lake when we portaged in on Tuesday, checked it out to see if anyone was around but no sign and after fishing about an hour seen another float plane land and they began to dismantle the plane and then air lifted it out in pieces by chopper. Was glad to see no one was killed in the crash on take off, heard they were guest of Stanley's camp."
565625,Guest,2007-05-27 21:49:00,0,"I met the pilot from the 180 crash on Wed. he helped load the plane I took out to Roderick,and was going to catch a ride back to Red Lake with him on Thursday afternoon, We still don't know why the plane went down. He seemed like a good kid, I was looking foward to working with him this summer at Chimo Air. LarryM sorry we missed you guys on Friday, Malinda and I took the new boat down to Gullrock for some eyes. I hope Dakota treated you guy OK last week."
565627,2746,2007-05-27 22:17:00,3206,"Bud, your neighbor said you were out fishing.....catch you the next time around. Dakota did a great job. stopped by our cabin each evening for a visit. Talks a bunch more than he used to.....turning into quite a young man. Also had a good visit with the Mn. guys you fished with on Red. Sounds like you found some big eyes. Was good to see Malinda! Linda wants to come up when you get the B&B done."
565956,Guest,2007-06-04 21:47:00,0,"LarryM, we finally got the B&B done and we have are first guest tomarrow.I'll email you some info and a pic. or 2 in a couple days.
