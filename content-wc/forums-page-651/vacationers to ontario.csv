565806,Guest,2007-05-31 19:33:00,0,Hi. just wonder if the folks going to ontario notice less americans traveling up there? Just read on the CKDR radio website and news outlet that according to someone up there that is counting 2002 was the peak year for americans and the numbers have been declining every year since. they are working on trying to get the numbers back up. it could be that besides the price of gas that that was the year the rebates stopped on the gst and other tax they have. also the baby boomers are moving south and giving up there trip after moving to the sun belt. We always went to canada but last year moved to nevada. thats 2 people with 2 trips that wont be going anymore. this year we are going to give saschachawan a try though and see how it goes. the couple of drawbacks are the long drive and the choice of fishing licenses is 3 day or 1 year and thats 80 bucks each canadian. maybe they dont want americans coming up there either. I dont know maybe 80 bucks is a deal now days.

565761,Guest,2007-05-31 21:15:00,0,You need to buy a 3 day permit and then buy another permit for the next 3 days. Then you have a 6 day permit. Or is the 3 day permit $40.00 ?

565769,Guest,2007-06-01 06:28:00,0,"yes i should have mentioned that. the 3 day is 40, there is no coming out ahead unless you spend many weeks up there. you would think they would have a variety like ontario. I would think a 7 day is what most people would want. and the year is not like from the date you bought it, its the season."

If the government is interested in promoting the sport fishing industry, they cannot allow indiscriminate netting and expect tourists to enthusiastically swarm over those areas where such practices are allowed and even considerably subsidised. I don't have a solution, other than providing some other type of employment for those needing work. There is a tough balance between the netting and the tourist industry, and the pendulum continues to swing, depending on the times and various influences."
