565907,Guest,2007-06-04 08:30:00,0,"They will be required soon enough. This is taken directly from US Government site on travel. New Requirements for Travelers Between the United States and Canada: Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) Effective January 23, 2007, all U.S. citizens traveling by air to and from Canada are required to have a valid passport to enter the United States. As early as January 1, 2008, U.S. citizens traveling between the United States and Canada by land or sea (including ferries), may be required to present a valid U.S. passport or other documents as determined by the Department of Homeland Security. Ample advance notice will be provided to enable the public to obtain passports or passport cards for land/sea entries. American citizen travelers are encouraged to apply for a U.S. passport or the passport card when it becomes available, well in advance of anticipated travel. American citizens can visit travel.state.gov or call 1-877-4USA-PPT (1-877-487-2778) for information on applying for a passport. Current Requirements for Entry Into Canada Visas are not required for U.S. citizens entering Canada from the U.S. You will, however, need: proof of your U.S. citizenship such as your U.S. passport (For information on obtaining a U.S. passport, check with one of the regional passport agencies located throughout the U.S.) or certified copy of your birth certificate issued by the city, county or state in the U.S. where you were born. If you are a naturalized U.S. citizen and do not have a passport, you should travel with your naturalization certificate. A driver's license, voter's registration card or Social Security card is NOT valid proof of citizenship. photo identification, such as a current, valid driver's license. All U.S. citizens entering Canada from a third country must have a valid passport. Alien permanent residents of the U.S. must present their Alien Registration Card, commonly called a Green Card. If you are a dual U.S./Canadian citizen you should always present yourself as a Canadian citizen when entering Canada. However, U.S. citizens should use their U.S. passports when entering or leaving the United States. Due to international concern over child abduction, single parents, grandparents, or guardians traveling with children often need proof of custody or notarized letters from the other parent authorizing travel. (This is in addition to proof of citizenship as explained above.) Any person under the age of 18 and traveling alone should carry a letter from his/her parent or guardian authorizing the trip. Travelers without such documentation may experience delays at the port of entry. For further information, including information on student or business travel, visitors can contact the Embassy of Canada at 501 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Washington, DC 20001, (202) 682-1740, see their Internet home page at http://www.canadianembassy.org or contact the nearest Canadian consulate. (A list of Canadian consulates is at the end of this brochure.)"
565909,Guest,2007-06-04 08:46:00,0,"I think the key word relating to passports and 2008 is ""may"" be required. Does anyone know what they are referring to as the passport card? For what it's worth, 2 guys in my party brought their passports last year on our Canada trip. At the border, they handed them to the Canadian customs agent. He handed them back, saying, "" I don't need these. I need your drivers licenses."" If you feel you may need a passport for other travel in the near future, go ahead and get one. If your only border crossings are to and from Canada by ground, I would wait and see before spending the $ on a passport. I get the feeling the 2008 requirement is not a done deal."
565912,wooglin,2007-06-04 09:01:00,371,"I feel the same way. Law states today that ID is needed. I show up with my drivers license and a birth cert. Until a passport is mandatory, I won't be getting one."
565915,jigman 2003,2007-06-04 09:38:00,981,"Sooner or later we'll need a passport or possibly the ""passport card"". If it's a passport that's required, you can pretty much assume the cost of one will be going up. By getting one now, you'll avoid the backlog of people getting them, and probably save a few bucks."
565946,Guest,2007-06-04 17:32:00,0,The Canadians are not requiring the use of passports for Americans. The American government is making this request to reenter the country. The Canadians are more concerned about nightcrawlers and potatoes.
565949,phishfearme,2007-06-04 18:59:00,1242,ever since this thread came onto the board i've been watching the government boarder wait times at:http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/general/times/menu-e.html and have only rarely seen anything more than 15 minutes. who should i beleive? phish
566001,rpieske,2007-06-05 20:58:00,1276,"Believe the guys who are posting what they have experienced. Saturday and Sundays can be horrible at International Falls. I am a summer resident of Nestor FAlls, ON and refuse to go to the Falls on the weekends."
566005,trucky9754,2007-06-05 22:13:00,2,"I went into Canada on 5-23-07 and we only had 1 car in front of us. Of course this was like 4:00am. The border officer took our passports without question. No other ID was necessary. Asked the basic questions about liquor and tobacco. No problems and got right through. Anytime after like 6:00am will be very busy. I've seen lines at International Falls that appeared to be several miles long. Coming back from Canada last weekend into the US was very painless. Several questions about bringing items back for people not in the vehicle. How many fish each person has and amount of alcohol. As for the passport / passport card. The passport card is in the works and will be used for non-international travel. Going into Canada, Mexico, or the southern vacation islands can use the passport card. It will resemble something like a drivers license. The basic passport must be used for places over the big pond. Good luck fishing. We had 6"" of rain in 2 days which basically shut down the fishing."
565794,Guest,2007-06-01 15:07:00,0,"Canada Bound is right on the money. Have your passports ready, answer your questions WITHOUT AN ATTITUDE, and claim what you are bringing across. Better yet, don't be over on the booze, tobacco products, no potatoes or Onions. Smile and don't be a jerk. Lines will start forming on Sat mornings by 6am, by 8 the line is about a mile, by 10, good luck seeing the Canada side by noon. But that's why I stay at a camp that is Friday to Friday. Saturdays fishing is always best because most of you guys are waiting in line. Good Luck! Enjoy the trip"

565788,Crappie Kid,2007-06-01 12:18:00,1581,Ditto on 4:00 am. This time of the season by 6:00 am lines start to form. Also make sure you have plenty of fuel before you get within 30 miles of I-Falls. Lines form at the gas stations too.

565792,Guest,2007-06-01 13:42:00,0,"We crossed between 4 and 430am two weeks, no waiting. The return trip we waited about 45 minutes around noon but there was not a line going in last Friday around noon. Steady traffic but I doubt the wait was 5 minutes. The return trip they asked us several questions in addition to the normal and I thought sure we were in for a search but after a long look at each of the 4 of us all he said was have a nice trip. We were in a mini van towing a small enclosed trailer. I think it helped we all had passports and clean records."
