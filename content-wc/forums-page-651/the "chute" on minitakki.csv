565631,Guest,2007-05-28 08:52:00,0,Where is donut bay? I have fished out of Donnellys a few times but c/n recall that spot? Thanks Terry
565656,scar,2007-05-29 05:57:00,196,"guys, the chute is now navigable. i was up over memorial day weekend and we all took our boats through and no one hit anything. our smallest motor is a 115. it is scary though. as a previous post said stay so close to the shore line you can touch it and then don't pass between the red and green markers but head to the right of the red marker and then go straight out. weather was bad the 4 days we fished and a real bad cold front went through on friday but we still caught some nice fish. small mouth were every where and quite big. a 20'' and several 17 - 18''. the donut is up on the north east end. scar"
565719,Guest,2007-05-30 16:19:00,0,Any more reports???
565911,Guest,2007-06-04 08:56:00,0,The water rose 2 feet last week while we were there. The chute is easily navigatible. The water is higher when we left than it was when we were there in 2003 the first week of June. I always go between the red and green markers. Isn't that why they are there?
565916,smallieman53,2007-06-04 09:41:00,11,So the big guestion for you New Guy is how did you do fishing? What worked and did not work? We are leaving this week and would love to hear from some of the folks that have been up there. Thanks for any info Chad
565918,Guest,2007-06-04 10:27:00,0,"Killed the smallies on a white spinnerbait. Used the same lure for 7 straight days. Other people tried other lures but kept coming back to a white spinnerbait. Silver willow blade. Biggest was 19.5 inches, 4.3 lbs. Between 6 people over 50 smallies easily and almost half were over 17 inches. Caught a 13 lb northern as well on the same spinnerbait."
565953,Guest,2007-06-04 21:01:00,0,Where are you folks staying up there? Always looking for a new area to fish and stay. Terry
564943,Guest,2007-05-04 10:40:00,0,"Pull a boat through the chute? If all three of the people in my boat were NFL linebackers, I still don't think we could ever pull a boat through there by hand. That water moves way to fast for that. We would stand a better chance carrying it accross shore by hand. I sure hope it is navigatable. I'll be there in 3 weeks!"
564954,Sutsgold,2007-05-04 20:22:00,219,"Actually pulling a boat would be feasible. The water was so low in october that there was just a slight current as compared to its normal fast current. It's definetly possible, although it would be an awkward pull."
565347,Guest,2007-05-16 20:15:00,0,Any word on the latest water level conditions on Minnitaki??
565348,scar,2007-05-16 20:30:00,196,we have six boats heading for our cabin on neepawa next wednesday and all of us are using the landings at donnelly's or pickeral arm camp. haven't heard anything new but i can't imagine since last week things improved enough to take some of our large boats through the chute. scar
565373,Guest,2007-05-17 11:50:00,0,"we used donelly's a few years back. $10 a day for parking and i think $8 in addition to launch. the chutes are walkable if water is down. current is just a trickle. we pulled up a aluminum bottom boat years ago with about 15 cases of beer in it. it was a slow pull, but possible. i went back up last summer after water levels went down and snorkeled a lot of that and english river and you could easily swim upstream. if the water is down from that, it would be even less of a challenge. with the water that low, i am more concerned about where the fish are going to hide. i also called up there last week to find out it was 90 degrees outside, record high tempatures and half the countryside was in fire."
565376,scar,2007-05-17 11:59:00,196,WILDCATT- ou snorkelled the chute area and the english!!??? what did you all see down there? i have thought about doing that my self but the water is never warm enough in may and june when i go> please share more about the snorkelling. scar
565404,Guest,2007-05-18 07:09:00,0,"I still can't picture the water being that slow through the chute. In 2003 when the water level was low, the water was still very fast through the chute. Maybe some of the recent rains are helping the situation. Does anyone have any current info? I leave a week from today!!!"
565406,Guest,2007-05-18 08:02:00,0,"i think it was 96 when the water was that low and slow in the spring. last summer was close to the same way. both spots had more jig heads in the rocks than bass pro does during the holiday season. the english had a lot more to snorkel, the water was low and warm 72degrees. I pulled my kids along in the boat with me and they would spot the lures and i would go down and get them. most of the upper english was 3 to 7 feet deep. 7 year old said it was better than disney. saw a lot of the terrian we fish and it looked perfect in english. the chutes on the shallow side looked the same. just like of one of linders shows where he send the camera down. saw a lot of small perch and walleyes, no toothy critters though. i think they recognized me from the spring and split."
565521,Guest,2007-05-23 10:14:00,0,Any word on this?
565616,Guest,2007-05-27 13:31:00,0,"Navigated the chute four (4) times last week. Running a Lund 17' Pro Angler with 50 HP Merc. nudged a rock one time. Very low water level. Stay really, really close to shore line. We were in shallow drive, just down enough to have boat control. Fishing Minnitaki was fantastic. Dougnut bay excelent. Got limit of walleye on day two (seven guys). Trolled spinner rigs with copper blade from rock point on south side to island in middle."
564766,scar,2007-04-26 20:02:00,196,heard the water is so low that the chute from abram to minitakki is not navigable this spring. any other ways to get to minitakki? anyone know if the resort owners on the pickeral arm would let us land our boats and keep our trucks there for a price? scar
564767,Guest,2007-04-27 06:58:00,0,Say it ain't so!?
564778,Sutsgold,2007-04-27 12:51:00,219,Was at the chutes in late october. Not a chance to get up from abrahms with a 50 on the back. Donnelly's lodge on the minnitaki arm may be able to help you out. Lets hope for a lot of rain.
564783,Guest,2007-04-27 17:56:00,0,I heard that Donnely's bought a dredger so they could get in & out. Anyone know anything about that?
564903,Guest,2007-05-02 16:18:00,0,Any updates on this?
564905,scar,2007-05-02 19:43:00,196,"donnelys contacted me after i emailed them. they said boats could get walked up the chute. can load at their resort-$10 in, $8/day for truck with trailer and $10 to take out. pray for rain! scar"
564916,Guest,2007-05-03 13:07:00,0,">heard the water is so low that the chute from abram to >minitakki is not navigable this spring. any other ways to get >to minitakki? anyone know if the resort owners on the >pickeral arm would let us land our boats and keep our trucks >there for a price? >scar I am concerned about getting from Butterfly Lake thru the channel into Lyons Bay. We could barely make it last July! If Donnelly's bought a dredger, maybe the guy at Timber Edge should rent it and dig the channel out."
564917,Guest,2007-05-03 13:41:00,0,"What do you mean by ""walked up the chute""?"
564925,scar,2007-05-03 17:25:00,196,think that might be a rumor about a dredger at donnellys. walking up the chute means drive the boats to the chute and get out and pull the boats through by hand from shore. scar
564928,Jimmy Jig,2007-05-03 19:32:00,1905,I believe that the walk-way was removed afew years ago. Good luck trying to pull a boat up the chutes by hand.
