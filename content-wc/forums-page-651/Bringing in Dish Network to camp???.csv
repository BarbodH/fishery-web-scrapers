565967,smallieman53,2007-06-05 09:18:00,11,As stated before we were planning on bringing up our mobile Dish Network setup as my dad is somewhat handicap and really cannot spend the entire day fishing. He wants to go just to hang out and get away for awhile but having some TV would help him spend his time while alone. Does anyone bring up their Dish Network? Can you cross the border with it? Will it work up there? Thanks again for any feedback Chad
