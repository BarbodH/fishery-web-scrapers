I believe Moosehorn is on the south east side. Can you please tell me where to go from there (spots which hold pike and big pike) and also for that time of year do we troll, throw, or what and what should we be fishing with at that time of year...thanks in advance for all your help...csuram"
565904,rockape,2007-06-04 07:08:00,215,Great choice on staying at Moosehorn. Just ask the people there. They are more than willing to help you out and tell you where the fish are and what to use.

You'll find Pike and Pike will find you. >Hi guys we will be going up to Moosehorn Lodge end of July >for six days...we really want to do some serious pike fishing >on Lac Seul.

It's hard to beat a traditional spoon for big pike but a lot of lures will work. Vary your presentation and color until you start to hook up. I like to position the boat upwind of big weed bed and slowly drift across it.
