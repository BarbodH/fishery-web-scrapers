Insurance agent says homeowners will not pay if we hit a rock or worse. Anybody have any suggestions or ideas?? Having to pay for a $2000 lower unit could put a damper on a great trip. Thanks! Dk"

The camp insurance covered the rest but came after me for restitution. I turned it over to my homeowners and they hashed it out. But....if there is in fact a policy that I can purchase that will cover me as driver of a rented boat (AS PART OF A PACKAGE DEAL FROM A CAMP) that will cover any deductables or repairs in the off-chance I have an accident or hit an underwater obstacle, I am a willing buyer, and I'm sure I am not alone. This is a good time for eveybody to check your insurance coverages, just in case. Nobody plans on having an accident, but when you do it ruins your entire trip, believe me."
565991,Guest,2007-06-05 16:46:00,0,I thought the insurance that we buy from the camp covered all damage. Apparently not. what does it cover?
566017,Guest,2007-06-06 12:05:00,0,"Depends upon the camp, and their insurance carrier. The insurance carried by the camps cover the boats against certain damages, but not all. Like lower units, they can cost up to $1300 to replace or repair, some camps do not insure for them because of the extreme premium costs. So you are responsible for them if you take one out. You are also responsible for any of the deductables. I just called my agent to find out if she can find a surpluses carrier that will provide a policy that will provide coverage. I told her that I bet there would be plenty of guys who would purchase that policy."
