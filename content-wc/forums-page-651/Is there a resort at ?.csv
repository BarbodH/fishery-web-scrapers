566021,Guest,2007-06-06 16:05:00,0,"Is there a resort that's open to the public on Cuttle Lake just north of Fort Frances? Last year, I fished there and the gate to what looked like a resort was chained shut. This year, the gate was opened and it looked like people might be using the place but I never had a chance to investigate further. I've enjoyed my fishing there and would like to stay at and fish Cuttle and the connected lakes but I've always stayed closer to Fort and drove to the boat ramp at Cuttle in the past. The extra mileage back and forth detracts from my fishing time so if there's an affordable resort close by, that would be great. Anyone have any information? Thanks. The F-7"

I'd say you're on your own for fishing, since it looks like they don't even promote fishing - looks like they cater to more of the hiking/watersports/outdoorsy crowd... Upon further review I saw this - I didn't know most resorts up there were doing well enough to turn away a segment of business... ""Please note that we are a non resource-based resort. If you are looking for a hunting and fishing experience, please visit one of the many other resource-based resorts in the area."""

566028,Guest,2007-06-06 19:16:00,0,Any other places to stay close by? Doesn't sound like that resort will work. I've stayed at Taylor's Cove a couple of times. Not a bad drive from there. Thanks. The F-7

566041,skindzier,2007-06-07 08:29:00,137,I think this place is in the neighborhood - I pass it on 502 going toward Eagle. Know nothing about it - can't see enough of it from the road to really give an opinion on appearance. Timber Wolf Lodge/Mallard's Nest (Fort Frances) 807-599-2716
