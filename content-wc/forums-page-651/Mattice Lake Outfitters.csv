One thing I can say is the trip to Armstrong is definitely better than the trip to Red Lake. Better roads and far fewer hassles at the border. If you're going with MLO, say ""hi"" to the folks there for me. You couldn't pick a better outfitter."

566043,Guest,2007-06-07 09:04:00,0,Fished Guerin in Aug of 2004. Guerin was decent but not great. Best Walleye Fishing was on portage lake for both numbers and size. On Guerin walleye count avergaged 40 per man a day in 6 hrs fishing. Outfitter was awsome. When we return with Mattice it will be to Ogocki and would skip the smaller lakes. Do a search for Mattice and you will get lots of info.
