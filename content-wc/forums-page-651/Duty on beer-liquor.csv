565850,Guest,2007-06-01 21:46:00,0,You are allowed to bring 1 bottle of Crown Royal into the U.S. duty free. Why do you think they call it the Duty-Free shop? Duh. Buy in AFTER you go into Canada. The price of a 750ml bottle of Crown royal in any U.S. store is double as what you pay at the Duty Free store.
565856,Guest,2007-06-02 11:36:00,0,"I have my doubts about a $10.00 bottle of Crown. However, I will certainly check it out next fishing trip. I would like someone to comment on the duty-free shops. Knowing you get either 1 case of beer or 1 bottle at the crossing; if you take both, you pay duty on 1 of them. Duty on beer is cheaper, so it makes sense to claim the bottle & pay duty on beer. It seems I've compared prices at retail in the US and that of the duty-free...does not appear to be that great of a difference, especially if you buy the booze on sale. One benefit of duty-free, I guess, is buying close to the border so you don't have to haul it as far. However, you still have to pay duty on anything over the limit into Canada, regardless if you buy it at a store in hometown USA or at the duty-free shop. By the way, I love this board, can learn a lot from everyone. Thanks in advance for any additional input."
565857,Guest,2007-06-02 12:56:00,0,Hi. Are we talking about the duty free shop in the US or the one in canada?
565860,Guest,2007-06-02 13:05:00,0,My assumption was the shop on the U.S. side.
565871,Illini Bob,2007-06-02 21:32:00,16,Where in the US can you buy LaBatts Blue for $14.00 a case(including taxes)? And it's 5% Too.
565877,Guest,2007-06-03 09:23:00,0,"In Canada. Come to think of it,ALL Duty free shops are always in Canada."
566002,Guest,2007-06-05 21:25:00,0,"I'm not sure about the $14.00/case...but I sell my beer cheaper to the Americans, as they are true conniseuer's of fine beer. The cannuck's...now there another story. Also, remember...duty free shops are a marketing gimmick."
565693,Guest,2007-05-29 21:25:00,0,"Had a pleasant surprise crossing the border opening weekend. In addition to our our 4 bottles of Crown our group of 4 was claiming, we advised the border agent that we had 2 more bottles of Crown & 4 cases of beer to pay duty. We went in to pay the bill and they said that they will just disregard the bill. That saved us a good chunk of money and certainly increased the goodwill with the border folks. I understand that they are on a customer service kick right now after complaints from last year. Works with me."
565804,Sean,2007-05-31 18:34:00,160,Where did you cross at? I will keep my fingers crossed.

565762,Guest,2007-05-31 21:40:00,0,Fort Frances. I'm not sure if others have had the same luck or not. We needed all the extra beer & crown to warm up...that opening Saturday was COLD.

565779,Guest,2007-06-01 08:00:00,0,Why would you take crown Royal INTO Canada? It is cheaper to buy the stuff in the duty free shop. The stuff is dirt cheap as compared to U.S. prices.

565783,Guest,2007-06-01 10:38:00,0,We ran into the same situation last June at the crossing just north of Warroad. We were over and want in to pay duty and they said to foget about it. They few years before that we paid. We will see what happens this Sunday at that same border crossing!

565845,Guest,2007-06-01 18:47:00,0,"For the 750ml size, I can buy on sale around $19.00-$20.00 American. Duty on that is about $9.00/bottle. It seems the Canadian prices across the border were much higher..even after the duty assessed on the American purchased bottles. Plus, buying at the duty-free shop may have decent prices, but my experience is that you still have to pay duty on those when you cross the border. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Not sure of the purpose of the duty free shops. Sounds like one big marketing ploy."
