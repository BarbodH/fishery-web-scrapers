565961,mata,2007-06-05 06:10:00,78,Just wondering what to expect to pay for gas this trip?
565963,bigfish1965,2007-06-05 07:59:00,3210,Depends on what part of Ontario...prices are between 1.05 and 1.19 per litre. US dollar is about 5% ahead still.... There are 3.8 l in a US gallon...so it is the equivalent of $3.79 per gallon and up.
565969,Guest,2007-06-05 10:13:00,0,Our dollar almost at par with yours can be factored in as well. I predict by next spring our dollar will surpass yours.
565970,jigman 2003,2007-06-05 10:26:00,981,If that happens we'll see a big change in how Americans pay for their Canadian trips.
565971,Guest,2007-06-05 10:49:00,0,"As a commodities broker,and investor I can tell you that the chances are slim that the Canadian Dollar will surpass the US dollar. However if it does it is going to put a hurt on the Canadian business sector. I personally don't see it happening. Just an opinion."
565973,Guest,2007-06-05 11:21:00,0,"It's so close now, what's the difference? A few years ago it was $1.50."
566007,Guest,2007-06-06 01:07:00,0,"Last year when gas was 3.29 US per gallon in Sault ST Marie Michigan, gas was 5.00 US per gallon in WAWA Ontario. I'm not buying somebodies figures."
566036,Guest,2007-06-07 07:17:00,0,"Do you think that because the US is paying higher gas prices, and Canada's prices are very similar (not much more), that less people will be filling gas cans and bringing them across the border? Has anyone actually checked with their resort to see what they're charging, or local gas statins in Ear Falls/Sioux Lookout? If so, please post what you're hearing...."
