565270,Sutsgold,2007-05-15 10:05:00,219,"Odd question. Ill let you determine if it has to do with fishing or not. Anyone ever been in to PI's for the ""dancers""? I am heading up north with a group and was curious as to whether or not this would be a worthwhile adventure away from the cottage for an evening. what nights do the ""dances"" take place?"
565274,NWO Fishing Bum,2007-05-15 11:46:00,23,"Monday-Wednesday I believe, though I haven't been in over a year now. Give them a call and they'll tell you! NWO Fishing Bum"
565276,Skylane,2007-05-15 12:38:00,101,"Sutsgold, I just called and they said they are there from 5:30 to 1:00 Monday through Wednesday. If you go I would not recomend the restaurant. I have not been in the bar. Ellen and I are headed up to the cottage on Thursday. I still have not done anything about my floatplane dock, did you buy one? Have fun on Eagle. Steve"
565277,Sutsgold,2007-05-15 12:54:00,219,"Hi Steve, I have not done anything about a dock this year, however, I am leaning towards a couple of roll ins. It may give us the best options when we close up for winter. We head up next Wed to open things up and do a few days of fishing. Plan on hitting eagle along with some smaller lakes if possible. If you get back before next wednesday drop me a note as to how the lake levels are. Brad"

The ""talent"" can vary from year to year, but when all you see for a week are your buddies, fish, bear, and moose, anything else looks good! The food isn't anything to get jazzed about, but the beer is cold! It can get crazy in there too. About 5 years ago, some college girls home from the summer showed up, and started getting into the act!!! As the guy before me said, don't go anywhere with anyone. I've heard some crazy stuff happening."
