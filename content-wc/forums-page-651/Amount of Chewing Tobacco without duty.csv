I have read the information related to bringing tobacco into Canada, but can't get a clear statement on how much chewing tobacco is allowed in without having to pay a duty. I know that one person is allowed 1 carton of cigarettes or 50 cigars, but how much chewing tobacco is allowed? There is a referece to loose tobacco, but I was not sure if this was more geared towards pipe tobacco. Thank you."

565979,back357,2007-06-05 12:54:00,106,Yikes. The chewers really get the short end on that one. Thanks for the info.
565980,Guest,2007-06-05 13:29:00,0,Actually it's 5.83 tins of Cope. You could have one open can and 5 sealed.

Here's my little ""bit"". 7 years ago, about 6 weeks before my Canada trip I went to the dentist for a routine check up. At the time I was chewing about a tin of Kodiak a day and smoking a half pack of cigs. As usual, I had the little white patch on my gums and inner lip where I usually kept my chew. As usual, the dental hygienist took a brush and collected some skin to send in for a routine exam (not a biopsy, kind of a pre-biopsy). About a month later I get the results, abnormal cells. Told me to schedule a biopsy. Couldn't get an appointment to do that before Canada, so I had to go not knowing. Needless to say, I quit chewing and smoking the day they told me ""abnormal cells"". Came back from Canada, went to my biopsy appointment. The Dr. says, there's nothing to biopsy. The area where I had chewed had cleared up and there was no area to ""cut"". Since then, I always keep an eye on the area and have my dentist do the same. I know, nobody likes to get preached at. I sure didn't when I was chewing and smoking. Just an FYI for those people out there who may be looking for the impetus to quit."

566003,Guest,2007-06-05 21:43:00,0,Here was the link that covers that.http://www.tcnj.edu/~fox2/smoking/mo...p_image005.jpg
566006,trucky9754,2007-06-05 22:19:00,2,I have always taken a roll (5pack) with me into Canada and have never had a problem. I can't remember if they ask me how many cans but I think I tell them a roll.

My lip was about to fall off on the drive back from Canada in years past. Even put dip in my upper lip because the lower one hurt so bad. I haven't put that #$@% in my lip in 465 days, and couldn't feel better. Everyone has their time to quit, so I am not going to preach either. We all just hope its not at the point where it is too late. If you are going to chew, bring as much as you can, and divide it up between others that don't use tobacco. The tins up there are smaller than here in the USA and they don't have Kodiak or anything else except Skoal and Cope."
