563814,Guest,2007-03-10 06:48:00,0,"NE Piker: Congrats on your son's graduation, med school is a long, tough hike. My wife of 20 years will graduate this Aug with her PhD in audiology, so I have had my taste of what that is like. Good luck in Texas and enjoy the time, but like you said, nothing beats NWO and Lac Seul. This year my son is going, taking his sister's place (we alternate), so he is eager to show the old man how to catch fish. Willams Wanne-Be Last year was not the best year for us in the big fish category at LS, with the biggest in the boat for the week was a 29"" walleye, which is still a darn good fish. From everything I have read, that year class of fish which had the big mommas of 30""+ is coming to an end. What is really fun is that the class of fish that is 24 - 25"" right now appears to be huge. That is not to say they will be at the 30"" length this year or even next as the growth rate is pretty slow in LS comparaed to warmer waters back in the US. However, what is wrong with catching 100+ walleyes a day where 50% are in that range. Also take into consideration that we now we spend at least two half days targetng smallies, which we never did a few years ago. The smallies have really come on both in numbers and size. As much as I love walleyes, there is something about a smallie blowing up a top-water bait that is awesome! Last year, during one evening fishing, I was throwing a top-water for bass on 6 lb line, when a 40"" northern blew it up. Had it on for a few minutes before the line popped, but that was blast. The big fish are there, but I suspect in slightly fewer numbers that perhaps a couple of years ago. However, with that said, I can go a year in WI and IA and not put a 27"" walleye in the boat (other than from Lake Michigan) so LS remains a great lake for both numbers and size. Cheers,,,,IA Walleye"
