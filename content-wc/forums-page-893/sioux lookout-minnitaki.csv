Season openers are designed to be in the post spawn so fish will be gradually moving out to seek fresh supplies of food. They will be going into the bays from there. I have fished that lake and found in the bays, especially if there is a creek running into it. On the edges of old weeds or coon tails is good. Beetle Spins really worked good there. I know, I know, a Beetle Spin ===========but they really work."
