The particular cabin they had was not all that large, but it served their purpose.The boat ramp is not too bad, and you may have to unhook your trailer and leave it down by the landing (if you are pulling your own rig)The owners are really nice!! They will stop by and see how you are doing, ask how the fishing has been etc. Very easy to talk to!!As for the fishing: Figure that you will have to work for them a bit. We ended up travelling about 12 miles one way to find some decent walleyes, but we had to work for them. Found they were particulary biased toward leeches.Smallies are pretty decent. Found them along with the walleyes in areas of current.Tried for some muskies on Clearwater, managed to see one surface, but that was it. Northerns are catchable, but again, you have to work for them.One bad aspect about the whole chain of lakes is that there is not a good map out there. Not even a Topo map. If you go, you will recieve a map from them, but it will show no detail about what areas would be best to check. The owners will try to get you in the right direction, though...Portaging is fun between the lakes...you will enjoy that if you go, but definitely watch the rocks as you motor down the channel to the southeast on clearwater...couple of prop eaters there if your not careful.Steve"

Lots of fish if you know where to go and what to use."
