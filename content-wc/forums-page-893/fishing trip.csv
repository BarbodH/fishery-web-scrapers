I want to fish the area about 25 east of Fort Francis and am having trouble finding a resort with a reasonble price (~$100/night).I found Coppen's Resort on the web but they want a 6 night mininum stay. We can only stay 5. Also found Taylor's Cove but their full. Anything else in this area?Thanks,Whitetail"

528764,Guest,2003-03-18 12:30:00,0,"Go to the following message board:http://www.justfishontario.comIt has a trip finder where you enter in the number days, time of year, size of party, etc., the resorts follow up and contact you.Other thoughts: search Google for Fort Frances Ontario fishing or Atikokan Ontario Fishing or look up noto (Northern Ontario Tourism Organization. Noto's web site allows you to search a particuliar area of Ontario for lodges. I believe there is another site Virtual North that lists resorts by area but I am not too familiar with it.For your information there are resorts on Rainy Lake that you boat in or fly-in-some have daily rates. I have fished at Cascade Camp that charges by the day but it is a strictly fishing and an older basic fishing camp and is most likely quite busy during June. I consider it more of a bunch of guys who like to fish place than a family resort. It's at the north end of the north arm of Rainy Lake-northwest of Fort Frances. Winter: Jo Becker, 525 So.

528766,Guest,2003-03-18 14:27:00,0,I forgot to mention Mine Centre. It is located between Fort Frances and Atikokan. There are resorts on Manion Lake and other lakes. I found a listing of resorts after searching on Google.
528765,BD,2003-03-18 16:00:00,739,"I agree the ""justfishontario"" site is the place to start. Under ""resorts with housekeeping cabins"" you will find Finlayson Resort. It is about 15 miles north of Atikokan. Finlayson lake can have decent walleye fishing along with some nice lakers. Marmion has fantastic northern fishing. Dasshua has walleye, northern and great laker fishing. The Seine River has fantastic walleye fishing. You can find smallmouth fishing on all of these waters. Finlayson doesn't have much for family entertainment yet but the new owners are making upgrades which should benefit families as well as fishermen."
