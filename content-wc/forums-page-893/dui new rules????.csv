528666,Guest,2003-03-14 14:25:00,0,I was in the same boat as he was a few years ago. Yes he has a very good chance as long as he is not driving! I went last year and drove my self with my last one being 8-9 yrs ago and went through like the wind. Just be polite answer their questions and good luck fishing!!

That may be the only certain way across but my experience has been that if you are not driving you won't have any problems. Not a guarantee, as they can turn you back even if your not driving....it's just that they almost never ask and if it's not your car they won't have access to the records from your plate numbers."
