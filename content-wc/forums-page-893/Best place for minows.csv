528531,Guest,2003-03-14 06:56:00,0,"Easy there big boy, I guess I struck a nerve over a few minnows. Are those the same NATURAL RESOURCE LAWS, that allow the unlimited spearing and netting of walleyes while allowing sportfisherman to only keep 4 fish? Protect the minnows, slaughter the walleyes!!Go Canada!"
528532,Guest,2003-03-15 06:20:00,0,"Listen Dick, The walleye spearing and netting is an issue of indian treaty. I don't like it anymore than the next guy but the Supreme Court Of Canada has granted them this right not you or I."
528537,Newby,2003-03-15 17:38:00,148,"It couldnt hurt to take along a few crawlers. We take up crawlers every year we go, and they seem to outproduce the minnows. At least for us. Just dont pack them in dirt. Have a good time in Canada, and catch one for me, Newby"
528524,Guest,2003-03-11 07:59:00,0,"I am looking for the best place to get minnows between Ft. Frances and Kenora. I am looking for quality minnows as well as good price.When I buy a dozen, I dont want 11 live ones and 1 dead to constitute a dozen. I will be along this path durring the day so all places should be open."
528525,RCKC,2003-03-11 12:21:00,14,Where are you fishing?
528526,Guest,2003-03-11 13:17:00,0,near minaki on cygnet lake
528527,Guest,2003-03-11 14:16:00,0,Why don't you try and trap some yourself? Just bait them with a piece of bread.
528533,walleyedude,2003-03-11 14:20:00,34,"The best bait in Kenora is Charlebois Minnows on Doner Ave.He is always ready to bargain with.....but in 15 years of fishing at Cygnet (every May long weekend,occasionally July long weekend)I have found Berkley Power grubs and Power leeches to be just as effective as minnows.Last year we tried nitecrawlers with just as much sucess.On spinner rigs,those Power nitecrawlers worked excellently.You should have an excellent time,the worst day we ever had at Cygnet we still landed around 40 walleyes between 2 of us.An average day is closer to 100.Have a ball!And if you run into Bill and Sandy(former owners of the camp,still have a trailer there)tell em' Denis from Winnipeg says hi."
528534,Guest,2003-03-11 21:05:00,0,I will say hi to Bill and Sam for ya. I live only 3 miles away from them and see them quite often in the winter. Never tried the Berkley stuff before cause we have so much luck with minnows and leaches. if you are at the resort in may this year we will be there too.. last week. me and my beer stealing buddies. look us up and i'll give you one too...
528528,Big Tim,2003-03-12 17:21:00,63,Check the regs. It's illeagle for non residents to trap live bait in canada.
528535,walleyedude,2003-03-12 20:09:00,34,"I most likely will be there at that time.End of May,you really won't need minnows.As a resident of Canada,I can trap my own,but never even bother too.How will I know who you are? I will be driving a Ford Windstar pulling a 16 foot Lund/35 hp Johnson.See you there!"
528529,Guest,2003-03-13 06:40:00,0,"What could the penalty be for taking a few dozen minnows? I purchased a license to fish and now I'm fishing, for minnows."

The penalty is the same as being caught fishing out of season and will cost you your fishing license and up to a few thousand dollars in fines.If your going to fish in Ontario where I live OBEY OUR NATURAL RESOURCE LAWS OR STAY HOME!!"
