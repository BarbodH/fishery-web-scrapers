Other years they have been aerating at this end of the lake. But apperantly the person that does this ""forgot"" to turn on the pumps. Becasue of the lack of oxygen there are no fish alive. I talked with some of the locals and they have been catching no fish lately. Which is sad becasue Pelican has always been a great fishery, summer and winter. Now I wonder if there will be any fishing there come summer. Has anybody heard what the whole story is there or have heard of any similar happenings in your area?Fish ON!!(maybe)"

I know that last year or the year before they took out 3-4 truck loads of dead fish that washed up on shore. The had to get a small front end loader to take the fish of the beach."
