528579,Larry S,2003-03-13 07:14:00,666,I use Vados Bait they sell bulk crawlers and other baits You can reach them at 1 888-584-3474

Don't have to transport then and they'll be waiting for you when you get there."
528581,Guest,2003-03-14 11:17:00,0,You can buy 500 from Cabelas or BPS for $39.99. They get to you in about 7-9 days. They are always big and lively
528582,Guest,2003-03-14 21:36:00,0,"If your going north on I-35, stop at Cabelas' in Owatona and pick em up on your way by. Probably won't be any less expensive but they'll be alot fresher."
528583,2746,2003-03-15 19:48:00,3206,"Always use Cabelas as well. Worms are big, lively and fresh when I receive them. One problem however, they come in soil bedding and you can't take soil across the border. They must be re-packed in worm bedding. Don't know how you would do that if picking them up at Cabelas on the way up. I've asked if they could or would pack in bedding and have been told no."
528584,Guest,2003-03-16 08:38:00,0,"larrym,You are correct. Didn't think about the soil issue. Probably be a pain in the a$$ to mix bedding in the parking lot."
528585,Larry S,2003-03-16 08:59:00,666,If you order from Vados Bait you get great crawlers packed in bedding and a container that you can take the way it is to Canada. They sell in all numbers and are priced comparable to Cabelas.
528586,2746,2003-03-16 11:27:00,3206,"Thanks...haven't tried them but think I will this year. Scooping handsfull of worms out of dirt and moving to bedding is a job I wouldn't miss. Would even pay extra to avoid it. By the way, if you don't need 500 worms for the Canada trip they keep well into the season if you have access to refrigeration.....other than the family fridge!"
