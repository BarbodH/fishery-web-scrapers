528609,JoeUpnorth,2003-03-14 07:42:00,17,"We have used the 502 the last couple of years with no problems. There was a little construction last summer when we went through in July, but nothing major."
528610,Guest,2003-03-14 08:22:00,0,"Its all paved now, from what i remembered old timers would say it was just a long gravel road in the past.Here's last year's spring pic of 502 towards Dryden.http://members.tripod.com/meanz28/ea...2/P1010011.jpg"
528611,scar,2003-03-14 12:04:00,196,"last june because of severe flooding, 502 was so bad it was closed for almost a week.i went up and back 3 times after it reopened and i have never seen it so bad.(15 years of experience) there is so much construction during the day that it seems to be stop and go every 15 miles or so. even with all the construction they can not keep up with all the heaving and washouts that occure.last year we had one of our rigs break a trailer axle in august. we go to sioux lookout and unfortunately the only other route adds almost 2 hours to our trip."
528612,2746,2003-03-14 15:14:00,3206,Went up in August last year and there was substantial repiar work taking place but no stop and go driving. Wasn't perfect but not as bad as I've seen it. Would be interested to know what work has taken place since as we plan to go back up on opening week.Sorry to hear about the broken axel! We did not encounter anything that bad in Aug.
528613,Guest,2003-03-14 20:31:00,0,"We were at Ear Falls when the big storm hit and washed out a lot of highway 502. We were trying to find a way out of Ear Falls the second weekend of June, and ended up going west out of Vermilion Bay and heading down through Kenora and then east to Fort Francis. Actually, that's a nice road even though we had a slight detour where there was still water over the road. At least the road was open during daylight hours, and we made it out just fine. We're heading up again this year on the 6th of June, and I'd be interested in finding out how 502 is this spring. If anyone could comment later on this spring, I'd like to hear from you."
528614,Karl,2003-03-14 21:06:00,63,"The short answer is yes and no.The long answer is that while they have been repaving about 50 kilometers a year (which is good), they (Ontario gov.) have still got the same guy with a small bucket of asphalt occasionally patching the horrendous potholes on a completely random schedule.So, the odds that 502 is in good shape are about the same as winning a jackpot on your first $20 bill. Good luck!"
528615,Guest,2003-03-15 07:32:00,0,"traveled that road about three weeks ago. There was some snow on the road but did not think that the condition was that bad, from an Illnois farm boys perspective. Moose tracks were all over in the snow but only saw two animals and they were just East of Dryden on highway 17. Hope to check the road out again when the ice is out."
528616,Newby,2003-03-15 17:42:00,148,"Went that way last July and it was okay. A few holes to dodge, but otherwise fine. I would be intrested in the conditions when you get back. I will be going that way June 10"
528617,fishnutbob,2003-03-16 08:13:00,633,"Just returned from Ear Falls Ont. March 12th Trout Fishing 502 road has good spots and alot of rough road lost our 10"" auger bit off the back of truck. The best way is go over to 71 up to Kenora then north at Vermillion Bay the road is smooth and time wise just about the same. Hold on with both Hands!! Fish on !!"
