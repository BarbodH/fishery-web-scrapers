Now my wife wants a 5th wheel and pull the boat behind the 5th wheel which is legal here in the Midwest but I am not sure about the law in Ontario.Can anybody help. My total length would be 59 feet.I have checked that I would be legal in IN, IL, WI and Mn but am concerned that I might not get across the border."

528761,2 DOGS,2003-03-17 21:20:00,361,"Per my previous post, I only assumed it was legal because he has never been bothered. I don't see how it would be any different than semi's pulling doubles and lordy do you ever see alot of those in Canada."
