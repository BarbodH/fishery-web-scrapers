528305,Guest,2003-03-07 16:02:00,0,"Steve I haven't really thougt about, it but I'm sure it would be comparable to the places that do it south of here.I'm sure the price would depend on how far out we go which could range 8-75mi. I just started this post to see if guys would come this far and what type of services they would expect."
528306,Guest,2003-03-07 21:26:00,0,"Bud, I guess you might get a few to come up, but would it be worth you're trouble, I own a cottage on Coli and I don't plan on making the 1200 mile trip till at least the first of June. I just checked the weather up there and its -35 , after this long winter, even down here, the thought of driving that far north this time of year doesn't appeal to me. I'm sure you get some beautiful days on the ice just above freezing, with no wind, but the timing of the trip and the timing of mother nature would be tough. Also fuel prices are a factor, If i'm spending that much to get there, I want a decent chance at reasonable weather. Just my opinion."
528307,Steve,2003-03-08 06:46:00,259,"I was up that way about three weeks ago, and yes it was a might chilly. All the locals were complaining about the unusally long cold spell, what wimps! Was curious where Coli is located and what part of Hoosier-lottery state you were from. I live just across the line to the West, and recently bought a place near Denorik. Don't mind the cold and would like to spend some time there in the winter. What Bud has in mind may not be for everyone but there are a few of us crazy people that like to get out and enjoy winter. Bud you still have my vote."
528309,Guest,2003-03-08 09:18:00,0,"Hey BudThis is Jeff Jasinski, did you get my email about our reservation change? By the way was open water fishing here in Wisconsin on Friday river fishing. Caught 30 walleyes, but definateley looking for to our trip to your camp this summer.Jeff"
528310,Guest,2003-03-08 12:24:00,0,"Got your message, sorry to hear some of the guys can't make.open water I forgot what that looks like we got 44in.of ice on Gullrock last time I was out caught everything on a rattling spoon nothing on live bait."
528308,Guest,2003-03-08 20:10:00,0,"Steve, Coli lake is about 25 miles north of Red Lake, up the Nungessar road, and i'm from Madison, In. right on the mighty Ohio River."
528311,Guest,2003-03-10 16:35:00,0,Hey Bud do you think the ice will hold any more icefishing shacks?Last I heard it looked like a small city on Gull Rock in the winter.
528312,Guest,2003-03-17 19:21:00,0,Don't know where you got your info but there's 10 shacks on the lake including mine not to bad for a 16mi. long lake?PS just got back from a sprot show in IA. wanted thanks the guys that stopped by to see me.
528313,VANT,2003-03-17 19:57:00,68,"BUD, GLAD TO KNOW YOU MADE IT BACK SAFELY. IT WAS NICE MEETING AND TALKING TO YOU. WILL TRY TO SEE YOU THIS SUMMER. BARNEY"
528295,Guest,2003-03-06 11:14:00,0,"I'm a camp owner up here and I'm thinking about starting a ice fishing bussiness in the Red Lake area. I would like some input from you guys some of my ? are, do you think it's to far to drive, will it be to cold up here And what kind of accomadations would be expected any other input would be appreciated."
528296,Guest,2003-03-06 12:24:00,0,"Bud- Could you fill us in on how cold it does get, amount of snow, road conditions during winter and what to expect with the fishing."
528297,Guest,2003-03-06 14:25:00,0,"Depending on the month -30c to +30f the road condition up here would be fair to excellent depending on the weather at the time, they do keep the roads cleared at all times. As far as fishing :Lake Trout, fairly easy :walleye & sauger depending on the lake you fish20-30 a day."
528298,Guest,2003-03-06 15:33:00,0,Lake Trout in Gullrock? I've heard of some in early spring by the river. I would like to get into those. what size do they run? Do you fish the normal summer spots?
528299,Guest,2003-03-06 18:21:00,0,I wouldn't be fishing lakers on gullrock. I'd be fishing trout lakes in the area. althought I've seen lakers caught thru the ice on Gullrock 12-24 lbs
528300,Guest,2003-03-06 22:25:00,0,"Bud, why would someone drive the extra couple hours to ice fish the Red Lake area for trout when they can already do this in the Atikokan area (a lodge that I will not mention)....great fishing by the way. Something to also consider Bud, how would you feel about a motel, for example from Red Lake, starting an ice fishing business on Gull Rock. Maybe you should stick to the lake your camp is on for any future business expansion."
528301,Guest,2003-03-06 22:38:00,0,"Geez Gordo, lighten up.Sounds fun to me Bud. 3 other guys and myself would be interested if you provide the shack. We would bring our own sleds. Maybe not for a full week, however 4 or 5 days would be about right."
528302,Guest,2003-03-07 07:52:00,0,"Yea, sorry, must be the friggin weather that is putting me on edge. Time for an attitude adjustment....heading to Mexico...that should help.;-)"
528303,Guest,2003-03-07 08:39:00,0,Poke-eye I'm just trying to see if it would be fecible to do something like this . it is a untaped resourse.I'm getting bored up here in the winter(no deer or turkeys to hunt). I'm sure as you can see by gordo post I'd ruffel some feathers up here. If gordo ever fished Gullrock he'd see the boats that come down from Red Lake camps and motels to fish I have no problem with that as long as they resect the fish policy on the the lake. Poke-eye if you ever want to come up and fish (no charge)give me a call you will need sled I'll get you set up with a motel in town. PS I'm not after Mike's business I just like to fish
528304,Steve,2003-03-07 15:48:00,259,"Bud, Yes it is a long ways but sounds interesting. I had wondered if people were making that service available. Any thoughts to what something like that might cost?"
