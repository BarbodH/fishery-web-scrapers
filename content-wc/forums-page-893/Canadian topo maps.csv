528712,McQ,2003-03-17 10:26:00,615,"Here is the government sitehttp://www.fedpubs.com/maps.htmYou may want to give some of the other members a chance to respond. I know there are other map sources out there, just don't have the sites handy."

Any additional help would sure be appreciated. thanks, m"

528718,Guest,2003-03-20 10:21:00,0,"Thanks, folks, got my hot spot map today. Now, I need to orient myself to where the lodge is, put in point, etc. and do some serious highlighting of the navigational hazards shown. I'd like to keep my outboard's lower unit intact throughout the trip! I may also get a regular USGS-type topo map just so I can plot points, but after further study of the Hot Spot map that may not be necessary. One last question - are we there, yet? happy fishing, m"
