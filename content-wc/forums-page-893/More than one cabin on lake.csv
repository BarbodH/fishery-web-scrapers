Only camp on the lake is a requirement when we look for a new location. Not that we are anti-social - it's just a special thing to be ""the only ones"" there.If I booked a trip advertised as only camp on the lake and found another outfit there I would be pissed!! Of course checking with references and posting on sites like this should prevent that from ever happening."
528637,Guest,2003-03-14 13:18:00,0,"Our group booked an annual fly-in on a new lake for us. The outfitter (nameless) insinuated that their cabin was the only one on this lake. Well, last week, a buddy was at an outdoor sports show and happened to see another outfitter offering trips to the same lake. Upon further inquiry, the outfitter we booked with admitted that there is a second cabin on the lake, but stated that the other outfitter doesn't keep it up well and rarely uses it. While it is not the end of the world to have other people on a fly-in lake, we prefer to not have other people working the same honey holes as our group. Given this, should we:1) Let it go and chalk it up to buyer beware, or 2) Make a reservation with the other outfitter and then cancel on our original outfitter at the last minute as punishment for not being completely honest (we'd eat ~$200 deposit going this route)."
528638,zinger_79,2003-03-14 13:42:00,76,"Not sure why you'd want to cancel and lose your deposit in light of:1) You're fishing the same body of water.2) The other cabin is not kept up as well.Doesn't make sense to me. Besides, life's too short to be vindictive.If you want to get rid of your $200, you can send it to me!"
528639,Guest,2003-03-14 14:31:00,0,Just think of it as one giant group fishing the same lake. How many acres of lake are we talking here? I am sure you will be fine...If not bring your business elsewere the following year !!
528640,Pooch,2003-03-14 17:12:00,4619,"If the lake is of any size at all I can't see a problem. Plus there is always the chance that the other cabin will not be occupied during your stay.Sometimes visiting with fellows from another camp on the lake is a very pleasant part of the trip. Some of these fellows have fished the same lake for years really have the lake ""dialed in"" and may be a gold mine of information.Just my thoughts.Pooch"
528641,River Rat,2003-03-14 17:30:00,43,"I'd go to the camp you booked. If you have a good trip, what difference does it make if there is another cabin on the lake?If, as the outfitter said, the other cabin is poor and vacant, so much the better. If you find the Taj Mahal loaded with a gross of fisheremen across the lake, boycott the outfitter. Let him know that his dishonesty is not appreciated."
528642,Guest,2003-03-15 14:11:00,0,"Know how you feel. Our group was led to believe that we'd be the only ones on the lake because he had the only cabin. True enough about the one cabin, but come to find out that even though he flew us in, there was a rough road that was frequently used by guides. Every morning we'd see about a half a dozen boats flying by.It bothered us at first and then we just followed the guides to their favorite spots and fished there, after they left. The cabin was great so we went back about 3 years and then moved on for other reasons. Caught some good fish and mostly never saw the other groups. The lake was about 15 miles long with lots of islands."
528643,Guest,2003-03-15 17:41:00,0,"Maybe the other cabin will have the swedish Bikini team , or the budweiser chicks staying at it. could be a good thing?"
528644,Guest,2003-03-16 07:05:00,0,"Thanks for the replies. I never thought of the Swedish bikini team aspect, but with our luck it would be the Wisconsin beer drinking, boat racing team.By the way, we would never cancel the trip just to spite the outfitter. But I know a lot of outfitters monitor this page, so if they get the hint for next time, thats all I was looking for."
528645,Guest,2003-03-16 11:16:00,0,I bet you are one of those guys that never tells anyone about a secret spot. I've been fishing up North for ten years and I always help people out in fishing camp. I never keep a spot or a honey hole to myself. I always help people out to catch fish. I know you are going to a remote lake and that you were lied to. I'm sure you guys will have a good time regardless of who is up there.
528646,Guest,2003-03-17 07:11:00,0,"Don't assume that just because we don't like seeing other groups on a small fly-in lake that we don't share info with the groups coming in after us. I firmly believe that the fifteen minutes on the dock with one group going in and one going out is the best time to get some good reconaissance. We are always forthcoming with what we know (we never go back to the same lake anyway). Sometimes you get a pretty tightlipped group which is a little frustrating, but that's their perogative.I have even e-mailed some pretty specific information to people seeking the best spots on a fly-in lake that we have been to in the past. I draw the line on drive in lakes, however (if we find a good one in the bush, that is a secret that we keep to the grave)."
