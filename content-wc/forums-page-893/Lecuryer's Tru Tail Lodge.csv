528687,Guest,2003-03-16 05:26:00,0,I stayed there once back in 1986. The cabins were old and small but very clean. I'm sure Dan has rebuilt them all since then. Dan's a nice guy and the dock service was excellent. It was a respectable resort back then as I'm sure it is today. I doubt you'll get any unwanted surprises. I only stayed there one year because I grew up at Arrowhead down the street and got in there the following year. Bo
