536903,Guest,2004-01-27 11:36:00,0,We use both bottom bouncers and lindy rigs in the middle of june. We have our best luck with minnows and some plastics. Use just enough weight so you can feel the bottom and back troll slow. Flats close to deep water and some times we move from deeper water up into shallow flats so we can cover depths better.
536914,Guest,2004-01-27 18:04:00,0,"Have fished Lac Seul in early June for about 6 years running. The two best ways to catch them at that time of the year I have found are: (a) pitching jigs with white curly tails (3 inch) shallow (2 - 6 feet) or working a bottom bouncer with a spinner in 7 - 12 feet. In terms of spinners, single hook with a minnow seems to do best in early June. Later when the fish go deeper it seems to be a better worm bite on spinners. As far as spinners go, hammered brass/gold or chautruse seem to work best for me. Don't need long leaders, 20 - 30 inch is fine. You can pitch or troll cranks, that seems to catch more larger fish, but less smalls and mids. Don't do too much of that but it can be fun. LS is a terrific fishery, but its lots of water. Its definately a place for a guide or a great map with spots marked. Lots of places look fishy and maybe they do hold fish, but there are definately places that seem to hold the fish better. Good luck and enjoy....IA Walleye"
