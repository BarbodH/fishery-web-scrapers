537110,Guest,2004-02-03 09:49:00,0,"I read more than I post on this site but this is a perfect example of how awesome this site is. The great info shared here is why I am out here every couple days. Thanks for all the info. Eyeman, If you do not mind, I will look you up again as the trip gets a bit closer to reality. It's still almost 6 months away (unfortunately)"
537119,1shooter,2004-02-03 17:23:00,1493,I've been to Wiley Point 3 times and once to Totem. Wileys hands down is a first class operation and I'm sure you will not regret going there. The only thing I was not impressed with was that when we got tired of catching one walleye after another and wanted to switch to pike. We had to travel a fare ways to do so and even then we were not that succesful. Tons of walleyes though!!!!!!!!!!
537120,eyeman_1,2004-02-03 18:12:00,690,"FIB, Sounds good to me. At the time of year your going it will be eye after eye and if you fish bouncers w/spinners or rigs or jigs you will get bored of catching eye's. NOT! You can also cast cranks up shallow which is a hoot or troll cranks and that's fun too. Heck you just never know what you'll catch next trolling. Talk to you later. Start by getting the map for the NW section of LOTW. I also go the Hot Spots map for my handheld GPS the first time I went up and it was a real plus. Okay now I need to go out to the boat and start tying some spinners."

Can you tell me which hadheld you choose/why and what you think of the hotspots map of LOTW. I will be in the Nestor Falls area in late June(19-26). Any information is appreciated. Thanks hoosier"
537150,eyeman_1,2004-02-05 06:31:00,690,"Hoosier, I think you were referring to me in your post so I'll answer your question. When I bought my Lowrance X15 they had an offer for a free Global Map 100. That is the unit that I have. It works fine for me. I keep it in the car and use it around the country on trips. The background map is adequate but I'll download more detailed info for the locations I'm going. I think it has two one meg compartments for info. (not sure on the size though - I'd have to go find the instructions) Anyway, the maps that I looked at for LOTW were the NW and NE sections. I choose the NW section as it covers the area near and around the resort pretty well. I also have both of the hard copy FHS maps for that area."
537157,River_eye,2004-02-05 13:55:00,1486,"The FHS map you have, I assume it's compatible with only Lowrance units? Any idea how much memory is needed to fit at least half the lake on the GPS? I have a Garmin venture, and recently won a Lowrance ifinder through work. The venture doesn't take maps, and the ifinder doesn't support the navionics chips, only general map chips and I'd really like that LOTW contour map, so I'm trying to decide what to do."
537162,eyeman_1,2004-02-05 16:26:00,690,You are correct about the compatibility. If I recall correctly I had to send FHS my serial number and they sent the map to me in an email. It's only downloadable to that unit. I have a friend that has an Ifinder. I'll ask him what kind of memory he can hold on the unit if I get a chance. I think you could also go to the Lowrance sight or your manual and find out what they hold. Then you could check out FHS and find out what size the maps are. Just a thought? Might want to post this question on the Strictly Fishing board. I'm sure there will be guys that have the Ifinder that will know way more then I. I know that isn't a ton of info but I hope that helps.
537163,River_eye,2004-02-05 17:37:00,1486,"I know it has the available memory, 8 mb plus cards up to 128 mb, but I'm wondering the size of the map itself. Guess I'll email the companies, thanks for the reply."
537235,Guest,2004-02-09 03:27:00,0,"Being a former guide on Lake of the Woods, I know most of the lodges and resorts in the area. 1-The Totem Lodge operations are excellent to be sure. Service, meals, guides, equipment etc.. 2-Wiley to me is a walleye and muskie fishing lodge/area. If you are seeking smallmouth bass in any quanity/quality be prepared to a boat ride of a good 30 min. then some. Same goes for Northern Pike fishing as they will no doubt head over to Shoal Lake/Shoal Lake Narrows where these species are more prominent. 3-The boat ride to that area (Shoal Lake/Shoal Lake Narrows) is nice for sure, but cuts into your fishing time, and remember if the weather turns mean (and it can) you have a miserable time getting back to the lodge. 4-There are excellent lodges in the area that offer portage lakes for superb bass fishing if that is what you desire. One only a short distance from Wiley Point too. Eight remote lakes. 5-There are also a few facilities available in the Shoal Lake Narrows/Ash Rapids area that offer excellent bass fishing too, but the walleye fishing is not all that great. 6-Walleye fishing in the Shoal Lake/Shoal Lake Narrows has been closed for over 15 years. Please remember this..It is ""illegal to even attempt to fish for them on ""purpose"". The MNR rules state that if you catch a walleye in the Shoal Lake area it must be released immediately. If you continue to catch them, you should move. Period. Not just sit their and keep catching them... 7-This has been an on going battle on LOTW for years for that area. Fantastic walleye fishing, but closed.. 8-IF it is your first time at any lodge as I see it on LOTW..I would hire a guide for two days as has been mentioned here in previous posts. There are more submerged rocks on this body of water than one can imagine. Even the best of guides hit them too. If you want info for NW Ontario look into http://www.kenoraontario.net or e-mail me personally at [email protected] I will be more than pleased to help you with your fishing at ANY facility on this lake. Ron"
537255,Guest,2004-02-09 12:40:00,0,"Ron, Very helpful info. I fish Miles Bay, Sabaskong, Little Traverse, etc. Have never heard about Shoal Lake being closed for walleye. Can you tell us a little about the reasons?"
537313,Guest,2004-02-10 21:05:00,0,"Shoal Lake has been closed to walleye fishing for well over 15 years. due to over fishing by the commercial fisheries. Each blame each other in a way. Sport fisherman, who in the old days took everything and anything, and the commercial both native/non native. At one time ( a few yrs before I arrived here to guide) I understand it was like a maze out on Shoal Lake for nets. The natives (so I hear) still do some even today but for ""personal comsumption"" whatever that means. 6 or 600 fish. There are extremely large walleye in that area. I know. I have hit them while fishing smallmouth bass with leeches. Others do tend to try and nail them today, by passing themselves off fishing Northern Pike as there are super pike in that area also. Same goes for nice muskie. The MNR has tried to control the situation, but as I say some people do attempt to grab a walleye or two. Not to keep, but to take photo's of. The rules are explicet. NO FISHING on purpose for them at all. If you catch a walleye you are to change the method. Lure... If you catch another, you are to move..Period. But some still go their as I say and IF they get stopped by the MNR they are fishing Pike. so they claim. We (fisherman) know better in most cases, as I know the main walleye holes from the old days. Shoal Lake/Shoal Lake Narrows/The Labrynith Bays in my estimation is the last bastion on LOTW for exceptional fishing. Smallmouth can and do weigh in at close to 5+. Pike - try 18-+. Muskie well. lets just say good fishing exists period. I would like to see it opened to anglers on a trophy basis, as I personally believe that these big walleye are nothing but eating machines. They not only eat the bait fish, but also no doubt their own species. There is to a certain extent a good come back in the past years of smaller fish. This too I know, as they are around the Labrynith Bays. Smallmer walleye in the 2-3 lb bracket. The new fisheries exists. No so says the MNR... However, I also understand that if it is opened to sportsmen, the natives want to commercial it again and that would no doubt just start the process of depleateing it all over down the road. Who knows what will happen. It's a catch-22 situation. There is also a new resort opening in Shoal Lake sometime next fall I understand. How that will work I do not know. I only hope, that they respect the laws and do not fish the walleye. If it is closed for one, it is closed for all. More than once the MNR has pulled raids. and more than once they have seized boats, motors, and passed out fines. They (MNR) sit right at the entrance (Ash Rapids) Only one way in unless they come in by Clytie Bay with their own boat and motor. That too they can control. If the MNR ever reads this stuff. I suggest they open Shoal Lake to sport fishing. Not only would it be nice, but also create on #### of a walleye hot spot..Like I mean hot spot Not many places I know of where I know 100% I can catch a trophy walleye of 10plus regularly. I have hear of natives having 16lb. plus in their personal consuption nets.. I also frown on anyone who goes down their to saying they are fishing Pike, and using over-sized ""7"" Rapalas with 3 sets of trebles."" Trolling... If they catch a walleye with those, it is instant death. I even say make Shoal Lake barbless, and single barbless at that for all species. That might create a problem to some. Not me. I know how to handle that one too. Ron Thompson Also...NO LIVE Bait fish are allowed below the rapids at Ash Rapids. Leeches worms are ok...Just no LIVE minnows. Bass fishing, pike muskie and crappie are all open. Only the walleye is closed... Sabaskong Bay is nice too. I go their myself to Lake of the Woods Lodge."
537314,Guest,2004-02-10 21:12:00,0,"One more thing about Shoal Lake. There is no map of that area of LOTW. They ran out of money or something. I strongly suggest hiring a guide for sure if you want to venture out on it. There are a pile of submerged reefs some only a few inches below the surface and they have black tops. You cannot see them. There is a marked (bouys) trail to parts of shoal, not all. It can also turn on you fast. watch you back. Getting stuck on the far side of Shoal Lake when the weather has screwed up ain't no fun. Like being in the middle of Big Traverse. in a storm. Not nice. I know. Been their done that. hehe.. RT"

537236,Guest,2004-02-09 04:36:00,0,"Here is a list of the major lodges and resorts located on the Western Peninsula of Lake of the Woods. I do not refer to the Eastern Penninsula, just The Wiley Point/Crow Rock Island/Shoal Lake area of this lake. Wiley Point to be sure is the largest facility on the lake. It is a five star rated lodge. No doubt on that. The ""immediate"" area waters are excellent for walleye, muskie, and to a certain extent pike. But they do travel a good 30++ min. to be in smallmouth bass fishing. The Shoal Lake Narrows/Shoal Lake section of LOTW.. As I mentioned, walleye fishing is closed in that section of this lake. Wiley offers excellent accommodations, meals, and certainly equipment and guides. Crow Rock Lodge - http://www.crowrock.com is located on Crow Rock Island not far actually, from Wiley Point..Their immediate area waters are excellent for walleye, muskie and once again to a certain extent northern pike. They offer Eight Portage Lakes for those wishing smallmouth bass and pike in both quality and quantity. An American Plan, boat in facility also. Superb accommodations, meals, guides, and equipment here also. A good 4 star ""++"" rated in my estimation. Ash Rapids Lodge - http://www.ashrapidslodge.com is located on the Western Peninsula at the entrance to Ash Rapids/Shoal Lake Narrows/Shoal Lake itself. They are in the heart of some of the finest smallmouth bass waters on LOTW. Excellent muskie, northern pike is also here along with lakers, and crappie ...An American Plan faciltiy and offers Housekeeping cabins too. A boat in facility. Walleye fishing is available close by in other sections of the lake without going having to even use the Narrows/Shoal Lake at all. Excellent accommodation, meals, guides and equipment here also. 4 Star rated. North West Outfitters and Outpost Camp - http://lakeofthewoodsoutfitters.com/ is located just down from Ash Rapids IN Shoal Lake Narrows. Superb smallmouth, northern pike, and muskie is right at their doorstep. It is a small facility great for groups of 6 or more. Worth a look for sure. and NO I do not work for any of the above or involved with same."
537038,Guest,2004-01-30 14:22:00,0,Anyone been here? Any feedback would be appreciated. I may have an opportunity to go in late July. It looks like the accomodations are really nice. How about the fishing? Big Walleyes? Pike? I usually go to Lac Suel in the spring but cannot make it this year. I have never been to LOTW. Is the fishing of the same caliber as LS? Thanks in advance for your info!
537043,Guest,2004-01-30 16:54:00,0,"I have never stayed a Wiley but have seen alot about it. They are part of the Wiley/Yellow Bird/Totem lodges. All are upper class fishing resorts and from what I hear, take good care of their guests. They have good fishing and you should take a guide for at least one day to help you find some fish. I believe Lac Seul has better walleye fishing but you should be able to catch alot of fish here. Good luck!"
537046,River_eye,2004-01-30 17:54:00,1486,"I started guiding at Totem last spring, and did a couple days at Wiley towards the fall. The walleye, bass, musky fishing around the lake are very impressive, big pike are there, but hard to find somtimes. The boats are all nice, the camp is fairly spotless and all the details taken care of. It's a good size lodge, so things are a little busier around the place than some typical smaller resorts. But overall, top notch service and excellent remote fishing for a fairly reasonable price."
537048,wiggle,2004-01-30 19:44:00,400,"I have never stayed at Wiley Point. I have fished all around there though. Wiley Point is in the heart of LOTW. In the heart of great walleye fishing. Go, it'll be a great time..."
537056,Guest,2004-01-31 10:08:00,0,"Stayed at their other Property Totem Lodge the last three years. The owners Son, Eric runs Wiley, and we have shore lunch twice a week. Great accomodations and service. I caught a 39"" Pike close to Wiley last year. The fishing around the lodge is excellent. Have a great time!!"
537058,eyeman_1,2004-01-31 15:03:00,690,"FIB, I have to say that Wiley is fantastic! My wife and I went on our honeymoon and went back the next year with 16 of our friends! Where do I start? You know when you read a brouchure or talk to the resort owner's and they tell you this and that about their place and you find it hard to believe? Well by and large it's true, not just with Wiley but with all of Totem's resorts! They treated us like Kings and Queens. Now understand that Wiley is 35 miles out into LOW. It's a scenic boat ride of about an hour and it's worth the trip! Lodging is nice, food is fantastic and equipment is unbelivable for such a remote place. If you want to know more send me an email ([email protected]). I'd be glad to talk to you. July is a great time there! Regards,"
537090,Guest,2004-02-02 10:14:00,0,"I have never used a guide, not that I have a problem with it at all, just never really had the opportunity. Do I just let him know what species I am after and he tries to put me on fish? Or do you try a little bit of everything? Does the time of year come into play? Can a reasonable fisherman find fish out there by simply locating good structure or is the lake so massive that you could spend 2 days driving all over and come up empty? (because that would be bad.) Thanks for your first response, and thanks to all that responded."

Thanks for your first response, >and thanks to all that responded. > > I have fished LOW for 12 years now ... sometimes several times a year. We stay at WitchBayCamp, which is close to Wiley, but is a drive-in camp so we can take our own boat without worrying about leaving the truck and trailer parked in an area away from camp. I am not knocking the boat-in thing, just telling you why we don't stay at Wiley. I have heard only good things about Wiley. The fishing in that area is excellent. In the spring, the shallows with sand and mud bottom have a lot of walleyes. They are a little harder to find than later in the year because one's locator is not good in the shallows. In late May and early June, the walleyes are scattering out of the shallows and are spread out over the lake, usually on the first humps near those shallows. By late June and through July and August and early September the walleyes are on the underwater humps and are easy to find with a mapping GPS and a locator. The humps can be hard to find if you do not have a GPS with pre-loaded maps or pre-loaded coordinates. We have found those late-summer walleyes on feeding shelves, however, as shallow as 3 feet on some days, so the humps are not the only places to try. The shallows are harder, however, for the same reason the early season bite is harder ... your locator is usually not very helpful. As far as a guide, my recommendation is that even if you are new to an area, spending a couple of days with a guide is very helpful. It will help get you acclimated to the maps you will need, show you the patterns that are active at the time you are in camp, and give you some peace of mind. Yes, they add cost. But they may save your trip if you are not used to reading maps, seeing lots of islands that all look the same when viewed 3 feet off the water, and looking for underwater hazards. That area is rich in hazards. On the other hand if you are a veteran at such tasks, then you can skip the guide. I would err on the side of booking the guide for at least a day. I have personally seen a half-dozen motors lose their lower unit during the years I have been on that lake. Some of these were friends of mine who are pretty experienced on the lake. They said later ... I got turned around and should have looked at my map but I just didn't think I needed to. Hope this helps. Good luck with your trip."
537098,Guest,2004-02-02 14:38:00,0,"FIB, Yes you can fish this area without a guide. However, I'd get one the first day there. What you'll find is that all the islands look alike and there are some nasty things to hit if the water is high or low. I've fished out of Wiley twice and it's a breeze. Great fishing from in front of the camp within minutes to 15 min boat ride. You'll catch eyes to your hearts content, as well as smallies, pike and if dedicated musky. As I mentioned before contact me ([email protected]) if you want more info. I love chatting about the area. By the way you can also drive your boat to Wiley. They will be glad to have you follow the group out. I'm considering that the next time I go. Jim Bello eyeman_1"
537102,River_eye,2004-02-02 17:57:00,1486,"A good guide will try to match the day to your desires, but will also tell you if what you're after is unreasonable given the current season or situation out on the lake. A lot of people just tell me to take them wherever the fish are, don't care what, and some prefer one species to another. If you plan on targeting muskies, tell them that on booking so they can get you a musky guide. I would reccomend a guide for at least the first day, so at least you will know the type of structure and depth to look for. If you are good at reading a map, then you should do just fine. The walleyes are all over the place in that lake and if it looks good on a map, there are usually fish there. As far as taking your own boat to wiley, lots of people do it, and there is safe and secure parking on site at totem, with round the clock security. But once again, you would want to be good at reading maps, or sacrafice a bottom end."
