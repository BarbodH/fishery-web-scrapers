Someone told me the other day to get chubs. A place that I live near has smoked chubs, but will sell them fresh for half the cost of suckers. Can someone tell me if chubs are good for deadbaiting or can someone recommend something else? Thanks"

537226,Ruddiger,2004-02-08 14:59:00,649,"I agree on the smelt. While I am sure chubs would work (I used to buy frozen 4-6 inch suckers and use them on jigs) the smelt really shines, especialy under a bobber where there is no real motion to attract the pike. If you are planning to cast them or put them on a jig or spinner-rig than I think most anything is ok. If you have a hard time finding the smelt like I do (live in Ohio) try Sue at Pastikas Bait Shop in Wisconsin. She is great and will mail them out to you in the spring. Call her around mid April if your interested. Ruddiger"
537227,Guest,2004-02-08 16:01:00,0,be careful - there's some regions of ontario where smelt are illegal - dead or alive. - phish
537228,Guest,2004-02-08 16:23:00,0,Does anyone know if smelt or herring are legal in the Minaki/Winnepeg river area on quick strike rigs? Jim
537229,Reels,2004-02-08 17:03:00,2876,"Oh yeah, one more thing, make sure you keep them cold. We left some smelt in the cabin one night, next to the heater, I tell you, I still have nightmares from the smell. Worse than rotten worms. <{{}}><"
537232,Guest,2004-02-08 19:51:00,0,"Yes, it is leagal to use herring. I like to use the herring that I buy at a local portugeuse fish shop. Nice & oily, little shine to them. The best part is if the fishing sucks, you can fry these up ! They are certainly tasty ! Price wise, 4 bucks for a bag is also a good point."
537241,Guest,2004-02-09 07:28:00,0,I appreciate the replies so far. Unfortunately where we go you can't use smelt. Suckers are not that cheap. I can't seem to find herring in my area. I was wondering if anyone had used chubs or if I should just stick with suckers. Thanks Bumde
537244,Reels,2004-02-09 08:11:00,2876,"I think it is worth a try... I would pack them in salt to give it a bit extra zing. Maybe try some salted, some plain. <{{}}><"
