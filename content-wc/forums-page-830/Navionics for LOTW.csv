537316,PJM,2004-02-10 21:28:00,3516,brian1785 I run the Navionics map of Lake of the Woods and all I can say is they are right on. I run them in my LMS 1600 Lowrance which is a couple of years old but the unit is accurate. I also run a X-15 with the Hot Spots and they are not as accurate at times. What I mean it wll show me running over an island where the Navionics will show me going arounf an island. I do have the Navionics for my X-15 also but the reason I have the Hot spots is because they were on sale a couple of years ago and were cheap. Good investment.........
