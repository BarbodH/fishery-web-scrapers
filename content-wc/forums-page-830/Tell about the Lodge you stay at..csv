It is located on the Winnipeg River north of Lake of the Woods, at Minaki. It is a drive-to, about 3 hours from Winnipeg, which we fly into from Tennessee, St Louis, North Carolina and Detroit. The fishing is good, with lots a big Musky, excellent smallmouth, above average walleye and plenty of pesky pike. Also some crappie. The lodge is outstanding. We love the boathouse. They have 17 foot Lunds with 50 HP 4-stroke Yamaha's. Wendy and Mike are great. My wife even likes it, and she doesn't fish, just relaxes. Goes shopping around the area with other wives and daughters, and on lunch criuses on MS Kenora on Lake of the Woods. Check out their website or our group's website.http://www.birchislandresort.com/www.teamcorrell.com Don"

Very handy layout and not alot of hills to climb. 16.5' boats with swivel seats and 40 hp 4-stroke motors. They give you a generous count on your bait too. Great fish cleaning facility and friendly accomodating hosts. Have lots of fun there."

537243,Guest,2004-02-09 08:01:00,0,We stay at Skunk Bay resort and drink beer from 7:00am to 10:00pm on the boat.The lodge provides the kegger and plastic cups for the boat. It makes the fish look alot bigger once your hammered by 11:00 am and you hook into the 3 LB Pike or the 13 inch walleye.Lot's of fun.
537245,Guest,2004-02-09 08:35:00,0,"poppy, What lake is Skunk Bay Resort on? Probably full all the time with service like that. Me and a couple of my alcoholic fishing buddys would love to give it a shot. We might even take our fishing poles if we can sneak through customs with our DUI problems. What week do you go? Maybe we can book at the same time and puke together."
537360,Guest,2004-02-12 08:17:00,0,"Our party stays at the Bung Hole Inn. Great service lots of clean toilets and the fishing is wonderful. The lake is loaded with carp catfish and digfish. A proven method is chickenlivers, hotdogs and cheesenuts. After a day in the 90 degree heat, you will have enough cheesenuts for the whole week."
