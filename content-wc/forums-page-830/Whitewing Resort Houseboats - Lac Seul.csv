They have been going there several years now. http://www.siouxfloatinglodges.com/ I know your question was about Lac Seul but I have also been houseboating 15 times on LOTW and can recommend Lake of the Woods Houseboats out of Reed Narrows. http://www.lowhouseboats.com"
537072,Guest,2004-02-01 18:05:00,0,"We have had the pleasure of fishing out of Whitewings houseboats for the past 3 summers. They run a good operation with top quality equipment. The only complaint I have is that they seem to be the KINGS of hidden charges. This past summer we returned to settle up with them at the end of the trip and were informed of a surcharge of $300, because of the strong canadian dollar,even though they advertise their rates and charge in US dollars. Also seems they charge extra for every little thing they do for you. I guess that is the price you pay for a top quality trip. Also this year I think they forgot to empty the holding tank completely because after 4 days the tank was full."

537079,Guest,2004-02-01 20:34:00,0,Leecher: Can a person expect a refund then if the Canadian dollar is weaker the next time? Don't know how they can get away with the surcharge without losing alot of customers. Would question the legality of advertising their rates at one level then after the stay levy an additional fee because they had set their rates too low. Are you going back?
537083,BuckeyeWilly,2004-02-02 06:56:00,41,"Leecher, thanks for replying. This $300 surcharge happened in 2003? What week were you there? We stayed at one of their cabins in June and there was no charge like this on our bill. They did try to charge us for more gas than we used. When we questioned them on this they agreed to remove the additional charges. I to feel they run a first class operation. Their cabins are the best I have ever stayed in Canada and we are all looking forward to a houseboat trip in 2005. We did fish in McKenzie Bay (little sand banks) and also around ghost narrows, but never made it any further south. Any info or tips you could give us concerning the houseboats and in general the fishing around that area would be greatly appreciated. I will certainly be asking them about this ""surcharge."" Thanks again Willie"
537113,Guest,2004-02-03 11:12:00,0,"The walleye fishing was excellent along with the accomodations on the houseboat. What was upsetting was the hidden charges when we paid our bill. The surcharge of an additional $300.00+ for the gasoline was a real shocker. Needless to say, this caused some hard feelings. If I remember correctly, we were told that the price of gasoline would be $4.00/gallon equivalent. We paid $5.00/ gallon."
537160,Guest,2004-02-05 14:53:00,0,"We have been going up to Whitewing Resort and renting the houseboats for about 10 years. IN 2003 we too had a ""$300"" surcharge when we went to settle up. When I questioned them about it they said that when they printed their brochures in October that the American Dollar was stronger back then and they would have lost a lot of money if they hadn't charged us the surcharge. So I asked if the tables were turned would we get a discount and Dave said Yes Definately, but I highly doubt we would ever see a discount. They definately are the King of surcharges....we have also had an incident with the gas too. Be sure and check the gas tanks on both sides of the boat to make sure they are full or they will fill them to the brim when you come back and you will get charged for gas you didn't use. We keep track of how much gas we pull out of the tanks for use in our boats and the generators. We had gone to another Houseboat Rental Place out of Hudson on the south side of Lac Seul one year called Lac Seul Floating Lodges and Irene and her husband were great hosts, they were so helpful in helping us decide where to dock the boat and they have a radio system where you can radio if you need help and they come out and check mid week to make sure everything is OK and see if you need anything. We loved the hopsitality, the only problem was there was so much pressure on the fish over there, that we weren't catching the big fish like we do on the Whitewing side. So we came back to Whitewing. Where they park the boats there are so many places you can go fish that aren't a long haul and the fishing is excellent. We just are more cautious and aware of things like full tanks of gas on the houseboat and other charges. We examine our bill when we get it. Also new in 2003 was that we had to leave the houseboat the Firday night we get back into shore where we used to be able to stay overnight and leave before 7am on saturday. Which means after a week of fishing hard we are tired, but we have to drive as far as we can and get a hotel room on the way back home too. YOu just need to weigh the pros and the cons. TO us paying extra attention to what we are being charged is owrht it cause the fishing is Excellent."

537223,Guest,2004-02-08 12:34:00,0,"We were also victims of a $300 surcharge this past summer, we thought that it was rather tacky to be made aware of this surcharge after we had come back in, and not before. We also had some questions on what we were charged for gas. We had a great trip, the equipment was well cared for, and the fishing was superb."
536557,BuckeyeWilly,2004-01-13 19:32:00,41,"Was just wondering if anybody has done one of these trips? It looks like they anchor them in prime fishing area. Would you recommend it? We stayed at Whitewing last year and had a great trip but that sure is a long boat ride down to McKenzie Bay. Even longer going back as it always seemed to be rougher at that time. Lac Seul is a tremendous fishery, but must be respected. Appreciate any info. Willie"
536619,Guest,2004-01-15 09:50:00,0,Dont have any personal experience with this houseboat supplier. Have been on others and the only thing I didnt like was the restriction on where we could move the houseboat to.....we couldnt move it at all.
536636,BuckeyeWilly,2004-01-15 17:23:00,41,"Thats the same deal here, Luv 2 fish. But they do park the house boat in a bay at the mouth of Altimeter Creek which leads into Broad and Sunlight lakes. This is prime area without all the traveling back to the lodge each night. Last year with the water down like it was, that was a treacherous trip for Lac Seul rookies like us. Thanks for replying."
536638,Guest,2004-01-15 19:13:00,0,If that is where they park the houseboat it had better be before June 10th. The fishing in Broad and Sunlight is not near as good after 6/10 as it is before 6/10. Broad and Sunlight areheavy spawn lakes and the girls are on move in june. There is much better fishing after 6/10 at transistion points and main lake.
536643,BuckeyeWilly,2004-01-15 20:54:00,41,"Thanks for the info, will definitely keep that in mind. We are looking at doing this in 2005. In doing different searches I read where some good smallmouth fishing can be had in the South Inlet. I love catching walleyes but must confess that smallies are my favorite. We didn't make it that direction last June so I was just wondering if you knew anything about this area? We did our best (for eyes) on Little Sand Banks and also Ghost Narrows and this was around June 15th. It was fantastic fishing but one long boat ride from camp."
536655,Guest,2004-01-16 08:36:00,0,"Not familiar with the term ""South Inlet"". We fish in the south central part of the lake in the Aldous Bay area. Have fished that area of the lake for years and have been catching more Smallmouth every year. We just fish for Walleye and the Smallies are a bonus fish for us. I would imagine that a real Smallmouth fisherman applying smallmouth techniques would be able to well in that section of the lake."
536848,BuckeyeWilly,2004-01-22 18:05:00,41,Sorry to bump this back to the top but still looking for pros and cons on a houseboat trip like this. We stayed with Whitewing in 2003 and I would go back anytime to the main camp. Beautiful cabins and outstanding food at the lodge. I've tried to think of some disadvantages of houseboating for the week but really can't think of any. Appreciate any help guys!!
536851,Guest,2004-01-22 19:38:00,0,"You've already listed 2 of the disadvantages that I could think of, the cabins and Bobbie's great food. You'll be a whole lot closer to the spots you fished last year. Don't know how much fuel they send along for the boats when you do the houseboat thing, that might be a limiting factor, but you've certainly got alot of good fishing grounds around there. Much closer to McKenzie Bay. South Inlet would still be a haul for you from where they park the houseboat."
536876,Guest,2004-01-25 13:43:00,0,If you are really into fantastic smallie fishing and love the houseboat try Ontario Wilderness Houseboats on Lake of the Woods. Smallies are catch and release in June but we catch hundreds of them a week. We have been with them for 15 years. They just got a new 54' boat we took for the past 2 summers. Works great for our group of 8.
536880,BuckeyeWilly,2004-01-25 20:12:00,41,Thanks Frankie for the info. Will keep it in mind. This trip we are planning is for 2005 and we are definite on Lac Seul. Really enjoyed it this past year. But hopefully theres always the next year and the year after that . . .
