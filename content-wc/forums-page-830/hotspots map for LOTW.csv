The good news is that last year Garmin came out with their better Blue Water chart for LOTW and Rainy Lake. I have not tried it on the lakes yet (didn't get it till the water was hard), but looking at it on the computer, it looks very close to the paper hydrographic maps that Canada publishes and much more accurate than the Hot Spots. This is probably the way to go. I purchased mine from http://www.gpsdiscount.com and have always had fast, reliable service from them."

537220,Guest,2004-02-08 10:51:00,0,">hey Hoosier ,we also stay at Canadian haven what cant you >figure out on the bottom bouncer thing. Dr888: basically what are the generic sizes and colors that work well on LOTW. I was unsure when to use the in-line ones vs. the ""r""-bend ones and why? How about a couple of pointers. Have you had good experiences at Canadian Haven and the Nestor Falls areas. Back to the bottom bouncers, do they carry them at the local bait shops? Thanks for the input. hoosier"
537233,Dr888,2004-02-08 20:40:00,39,last year was our first at Canadian haven. great people we will be back this year.you must have been there later in june after us. we left Brian some bouncers and spinners when we left.I use the 3/4 and 1oz r bend bouncers with hammered gold or siver spinners.Those we will fish from 5ft to 25ft just make sure to pull them fast enough to turn the blade.

Dr888: June 2004 will be our 1st trip to Lotw and we are looking forward to it. Thanks for the tips on the bouncers we will give them a try. Good Luck and please send a report when you get back. hoosier
537177,Guest,2004-02-06 12:35:00,0,"All: Has anyone used the fishing hotspots map for LOTW. If so what is your opinion of the map. I am going to purchase a Garmin map76 next week and would like eeryones opinion. Also, who has the best price(s) on the map76 and the software. Thanks in advance."
537189,Guest,2004-02-06 20:15:00,0,"Marine general in Duluth has a web site that has great prices also try the garmin store. I have some lat and longs for LOTW if your interested, Most of them are around the nestor falls area 76s is awesome"
537191,Guest,2004-02-07 00:33:00,0,"The fishing hot spots map is CRRRRRRRRRRAP. Although better in the last reprint I saw, it still does not compare at all with the Hydrographic maps you can buy. Especially for LOW. The new hydro map is the only way to go. Use your hotspots map for marking spots in the cabin, but not for out in the boat navigating. Just one man's opinion."

We re looking forward to our trip. I will look at Marine General,thanks for the tip. We are staying at Canadian Haven resort. I think I have a fairly good idea on what should catch fish up there the only thing I am struggling with is the bottom bouncer thing. Have you tried this and had any success? Thanks for the response. hoosier"

Fishing nut: Does the hydrographic map work in a Garmin GPS? Do you know if they have a website. The only paper map I have was a map from canada map sales and is #6214(if I remember the number). I also assume when you are referring to them as crap you are talking about the GPS map and not the paper map?? Thanks for the reply so I can research a little more. fyi: the GPS is primarily for navigation although it will definitely be used for marking spots we find and I was hoping for some good map software to load into the GPS.hoosier"
537197,Cooker,2004-02-07 08:56:00,164,"I don't think the Canadian Hydro maps are available in eletronic form to work in the Garmin (or any other LCR). The Hotmaps are created from Fishing HotSpots hard maps. I have found out the hard way that there are errors on the Hot Spots/HotMaps. I bumped a reef that the Hot Spots said had 6 feet of water over it. The hydro map showed it correctly at 1 foot deep. I also noticed an island that the Hot Spots map did not even show. You should be able to find a hard copy version of the hydro map once you get to Canada. I would strongly recommend getting one and using it to confirm what the HotMaps is showing you. The HotMaps are very good for general reference but DO NOT trust them 100%. Additionally, I have found that the electonics HotMaps can be off by up to 200 feet E/W/N or S. In other words, don't go zipping by just off the edge of structure. The HotMaps may show that you will miss it but you may be headed right at it. Inspite of the problems with the electronic maps, I would not want to be on LOTW without them. Great for knowing where you are at on the lake."
537198,Cooker,2004-02-07 08:59:00,164,"The hydro map being refered to is the map that you say you already have. If you put that map down next to a Hot Spots map, you will see diferences."

Cooker: Thanks for the help. I plan on using the paper map(#6214)to find potential spots and to navigate around and after I make a trip to/from areas I should be able to create my own route(s) to run with some degree of safety. I actually met a person online who is going to be at the same resort with a large group of friends/relatives and they are going to show us some safe routes they have learned in nearly 20yrs of going to this area. One of the purposes of the GPS is so if we see/hear of places that are a long run from the resort then I will be able to go and not worry about all of the islands ""looking alike"". One of the interesting things the resort owner told me is that since the lake has been down they have had more damage done by people who have been to the lake many times and not compensated for the low water levels,they were just running to places they have always ran to and got in trouble. Thanks for the tip(s). hoosier"
