537094,orchard frank,2004-02-02 12:20:00,1900,"I think there is an access off 516, but I cant swear to it, I put in at Hudson. There is lots of room in the bay, is bigger than it looks on map. When you are at the Deception navigation light where the water goes up to the north, there is a good reef right in front of the light. You will also be looking at 3 small islands to the north. One of my favorite ""secret spots"" is a saddle that goes between the middle and right island. Also there is a green can in the lake to the SE of the light, another good reef especially on the deep side (north).I have been going to Lac Seul many years and still find new spots every time. Just about anywhere that looks like it should be good usually is. I like bottom bouncers to minimize snagging, spinner or plain snell. 4"" tubes on light jigs are killer too, I think better than twisters. Good luck, start planning future trips, you'll be back."

This is where many a lot of poeple put in. The parking area holds a lot of rigs here. We then head west on Deception Bay for 7 miles and then turn north (I'm not sure if this is the same place the other guy turns north or not)for about 1-2 miles. We go past a ""monument"" that is on displayed on a small island. Just north of it we fish an area called Manituo Rapids(sp). We have very good luck fishing right off of the point there. Otts"

Just before you approach a large the island there will be the Deception light on the right. It is hard to spot before you get to it but plenty of time for correction so is hard to miss. Go north between the islands, head west past the island with the tribute and the channel markers will be visible. Follow the channel north (watch the rock markers) and it will head east through a long narrow channel about a mile, then hooks north into Manitou rapids. This is very fast water, and OK fishing. There is a small bay just past the rapids to the west which has coughed up some good northern and some walleye. Continuing west from there is alot of water but have not really fished much there since it is enroute to Wapeisi and other spots we prefer. There are always a fair # of boats with Ontario numbers between the ramp and Manitou so assume they know something. I would suggest asking bait shop for more details but whatever, enjoy it. TLY"
537238,Guest,2004-02-09 06:48:00,0,"TLY, What is the area like around Wapeisi? Is it rock or are there areas of sand to fish. I have always fished late June and early July with my wife and friends. We do well around Manitou. But your right the current is fast and tough fishing for my wife. We can go through a lot of tackle there. Just before you go through the narrow channel to get to Manitou, we head left for about a half mile and then go between a small opening that brings us in to a larger bay that has a nice shore lunch area to eat at. Just before we go through the opening there is a large underwater rock pile that produces a lot of fish for us. This year I am heading up earlier in June and am looking for the shallower sand for walleyes. Do yo have any suggestions? Josh G"
