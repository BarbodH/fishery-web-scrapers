535989,lenray,2003-12-16 07:36:00,467,Hi Mid--- LOBO 17 FOR 17 i BELIEVE that like I believe the sun comes up in the east but there are MANY out there and I believe MANY who have never seen anything like that. T o find that kind of fishing takes work --work to get into portages etc. or work at home to save up the coins to be able to fly into these waters. For those of us who have experienced this type of action it is ALL worth it. I really enjoy hearing these HOT STOVE talks about the north. take care len
536026,IaDave,2003-12-18 06:21:00,476,"Lenray- There is a guy who is from here that spends almost his entire summer up there camping and fishing mostly by himself. I know of him because he is related to my fishing partner. He used to camp on an island on Horseshoe Lake. Now he camps at Mud(badesha)Lake. It has been about 5 yrs since I have been up there. Mud Lake is a great lake to fish. Also there is lake just west of Pickle Lake,not the town. I think the name is Kapkashe. Phish- I'm the guy was talking to you about Albany River Outfitters. I'm going to Bow Lake this year the first week of June. I have been to Otaskwin Lake and we trekked doen to Froats Lake. Is it easy to find the trail to Froats from Bow Lake? I understand there are not many large pike in Bow but lots of walleyes."

536094,lenray,2003-12-21 15:17:00,467,Hello IaDave Good to hear from you--I thinkk it was you who shared some info on Horseshoe a couple years ago. Why did the fella go to Mud--closer to town better fishing etc. I realize it is farther to Horseshoe. Any chance we could talk to your friend on the net here. Thanks for sharing. len
536103,IaDave,2003-12-22 10:03:00,476,"Lenray- The guy is a brother-in-law to one of my fishing partners. I don't believe he gets on the net as I don't know him personally. I have been on the Pipestone with his brother-in-law. I think he is somewhat of a hermit but he is married with all the kids grown. I think he is fishing Mud Lake now because he is closer to town. I heard that last year he was there camping from opening week all the way till July sometime. He did tell my fishing buddy that the he thought the fishing was very good. I will probably run into him at some sport shows this winter. I spent 2 days on Mud Lake and once we found the fish it was very good,would have like to spent more time but we were up there in the fall and the wind blew us off the last 2 days. I think it is a shallow lake and it didn't take much to get the waves a rolling."
536113,Guest,2003-12-22 16:18:00,0,"IaDave, I have stayed and fished from the Mud Lake Camground for the last 3 years in the beginning of June. This was the first year that I have met your friend there (Marvin). I enjoyed talking with him about his life and his many experiences on Horseshoe lake. He is a very interesting man and showed us some of his favorite fishing spots on the lake where we could catch 50 fish an hour easily. I believe he still planned on going to Horseshoe Lake some time during his stay. He told me he stays up in that area from the beginning of May (staying in a tent in the snow) until August and splits his time between Mud Lake and Horseshoe. He told me he retired from a place in Cedar Rapids that makes road paving equipment and now when I see road construction going on I look to see if it came from his former company. Marvin is a true sportsman and I enjoyed his visits and conversations around the campgrounds. I learned a lot about the area and the lake from him. If you see him down there tell him Hellow from Al and hope to run into him again this summer."
536124,IaDave,2003-12-23 11:16:00,476,"From what I understand Marvin use to spend a lot of time in Canada for Cedarapids Inc when he was working for them. I'm not sure if he trained people on the machines or what but it sure looks like he fell in love with Canada. I know I couldn't spend that much time up there like he does. First of all I think I'm an outdoorsman but in reality I'm a Cabelas outdoorsman. There is a big differences. I have been up there by myself for 4 days with my dog and by the 3rd day I swear my dog was talking to me. If I see him this winter I will say hello for you. How were the bears at Mud Lake campground? I know one time we were taking our boat out at dusk and they were all over. Also, did he have you fish at the mouth of the Otaskwin River- we had good luck there."
536144,Guest,2003-12-24 19:31:00,0,"Marvin took us North from the campsite to some points sticking out into the main channel. He was trolling in 2 ft of water with a jig and minnow right alongside his boat with about 5 ft of line out from the end of his pole and catching one walleye after another and a few about 5 lbs. His bait couldn't have been more than 3 ft from his boat and running motor. My nephew and I tried the mouth of the river and up by the rapids but didn't have much luck. The bears were not a problem in the camp which is somewhat of a surprise considering the locals have a garbage dump a couple hundred yards up the road from the campground. Marvin carried a can of pepper spray on his belt whenever he walked around camp, but said he had lots of problems on Horseshoe lake over the years ruining his tent 4 out of the last 5 years even though he was careful with food and garbage. I have not seen a bear in Mud Lake Campground in the last 3 years I have camped there."
537368,Guest,2004-02-12 09:50:00,0,Hey Len an others who have fished horseshoe lake. We fished the lake a number of years ago (3) and had pretty good luck. I spent a lot of time talking to Len about the fishing and camping. Our other group went up earlier in the summer that year and did phenominal. They easily caught over 1200 walleyes in a week with 4 guys. We ran into a group on the lake from Missouri and the guy that was with them spends alot of time on the lake. He had a Lund Alaskan and was friends with the mayor of Pickle Lake Had bear problems on the last night we were there. A huge black bear swam out to our island and raided our fish chowder that was simmering on the fire. When we came back for the night he swam back to the shore and growled and popped his teeth for over a half hour. Needless to say he was ****ed we had interupted his supper. End of fishing trip!!! We packed up and motored back to the landing. Any other info. about the lake or others in the area I would enjoy hearing about. I know there are portage trails into other lakes from horsehoe but they are hard to find and Len said they were really grown over
535610,lenray,2003-11-07 07:33:00,467,I would like to hear from you fishermem who have fished this area--we fished Horseshoe Lake in the spring of 02 but didn't make it back this past year. Was wondering also how the fishing is in the summer months say July and August. Beautiful area but a 1200 mile one way trip from here in central Michigan. thanks len
535671,lenray,2003-11-16 17:25:00,467,Don't any of you fishermen go that far north-driving anyway or just don't want to talk about it.
535677,Fred_G,2003-11-17 11:16:00,908,"Len, We fish Lake St. Joseph every year during the first week of August. It's about 20 miles south of Pickle Lake. We do very well every year. Storms can chase you off the lake rather quickly, but don't usually last too long. Since it's such a big lake wind can also be a problem, but mostly just in getting from one spot to another. There's usually plenty of protected areas to fish. We have only experienced three days that were so hot as to be almost unbearable. That was two years ago, and we'd just take a swimevery once in a while to cool down. I have often wondered about the fishing north of Pickle Lake. Just haven't been adventerous enough to try it yet. Fred"
535716,lobo1,2003-11-23 00:26:00,734,"Len, Call up to Northstar Air in Pickle Lake. They do most of the flying up there and can either put you in touch with many of the outfitters or most likely answer your questions themselves. If you cant find a number - let me know I have it somewhere. Also There is a guy by the name of Tom Grey who owns three camps and a small lodge up there and has a website where you will find his email and phone number. He is native to the area and if you ask the right way - no doubt he has all the answers you are looking for. Website is : http://www.catriver.com/index.html I might have a little more info if this doesn't get it for ya. Hope all is well. Lobo1"
535736,Guest,2003-11-25 10:18:00,0,"len - go to the search engine within walleyecentral and enter ""bow lake albany"" and click on my trip report and the threads associated with it. lots of good details about the otoswin and attawapiskat river areas which are just south of pipestone. - phish"

535841,lenray,2003-12-04 18:37:00,467,"Helloo LOBO down the road 30 miles from me and hi to Fred and Phish it was very good to hear from you fellas. That part of Ontario is just out of the realm of the average person let alone fisherman. You tell folks who claim to be fisherman and they bring in 4-5 --eyes-- out of Houghton Lake or just name a lake and that is a good days fishing and you tell them that you and an old man put 52 in the boat not using a net trying to get them to fall of the hook and you can do that hour after hour but that you keep track for one hour they look at you like you are the biggest liar fishermanm they have ever seen. You lucky ones who can drive that far I thought 1150 miles one way wqs a trip but from Pittsburg--area Phish that is a trip. I have a pic. of one of the guyus who went in with me to the Pipestone in the last of May 02 actually May 25th. and the snow was near knee deep would like to put that pic on this site. Don't know if pics can be put here. Take care fells and if you have other memories of this area please share them help us all ,make it thru this coming winter. len at clare, mi."
535842,lobo1,2003-12-04 19:35:00,734,"Len, the end of the road is always a good place to start !!!!!! makes you want to just have a sandwhich when fishing locally - eh ? Steve"
535982,lenray,2003-12-15 19:56:00,467,TTT
535984,lobo1,2003-12-16 00:28:00,734,"Len, We got into one of those typical bunches of fish like you say and the four of us ran a contest to see who could catch the most fish on consecutive casts - 17 won it !! 17 fish 17 casts. We had to take some video (differant trip) so folks would believe us; while I was filming fish after fish we got an enormous northern on lite gear that swiped our walleye. I need to sell my boat and get back up there ! lobo1"
