537352,River_eye,2004-02-11 23:39:00,1486,"Guides perspective: The other posts covered most of it. Make sure the setup you will be using for Pike is smooth operating and good quality. Closed face spin cast reels suck, and will most likely jam up when you least want them to. Also make sure the drag on your reel is working smoothly. All it takes is a good run by a big fish, and a crappy drag to snap your line. Baitcasters are the best, but an expensive fishing trip is not the place to be learning how to use one. Backlashes cost you fishing time, and short casts due to anti-backlash mechanisms cost you fish. Braided line is tougher, but it's zero stretch characteristics give the fish extra leverage when trying to spit the hook. I love superlines and never use mono anymore, but if you aren't used to them, or don't have the right rod, stick to Mono, at least 12 lb, I prefer 15-20 in mono. Only other big equipment problem I see is using a jigging rod that is too heavy, too cheap or wrong action. Make sure you have a light enough rod to feel the bites, but heavy enough to get those hawgs in the boat, or even a Northern that bites on your jig. Good luck."
537356,Guest,2004-02-12 07:16:00,0,"Don't forget 6"" steel leaders to prevent the pike from cutting the line. I sometime use 4"" ones for walleye, if in pike infested waters. Have fun!"
537362,Guest,2004-02-12 08:48:00,0,"Thanks for all the post. I have plenty of baitcasting reels (Shamino Chronarch & Calcutta's) which is what I use 95% of the time. My spinning reel's are Shamino Stradic's. I like Fireline, use it all the time, but also use a Florocarbon leader as these fish are also line wary. Any reason not to use this setup for Walleye? All of my rods are 7' All Star Titanium which are excellent for fish up to 10lbs, more than that if not much cover. Again thanks for all the comments. What type of artificial baits do you use?"
537363,Toolman,2004-02-12 08:57:00,2570,"jellyworm, You might want to step up to 14 lb Fireline for the Pike on your baitcasters. For 'eyes a med-lite 6'spinning rod works well, but your 7' will be ok as long as it's not too stiff. The fireline w/floro leader works great for jiging-at least for me. Tim"
537370,jigman 2003,2004-02-12 10:00:00,981,"First and most important, a QUALITY set of rain gear. It sucks to fish for a week in the rain with an old set of PVC gear. I personally take about 10 lbs. of jigs in weights from 1/16 to 1/2 oz. and every color under the rainbow. Then a bunch of cranks for various depths, a handful of big spoons, and boat load of plastic grubs, minnows, tubes, etc. Medium action spinning rods (my favorite is a 5'9"" walleye rod from Bass Pro, heavy and medium heavy action baitcasters, and one or two medium light action spinning setups for slip bobbers. Of course my outfitter is pretty lenient when it comes to weight :)"
537386,Atlanta Dave,2004-02-12 16:17:00,323,"Jellyworm We fish lake Athabasca every year strickly for trout and pike.Have many 20lb pike to 26lbs and trout up to 42lbs in our group. I would suggest for these two spedcies a Loomis MBR 6'6"" heavy action will handle all your needs for thses two fish without over powering them. Coupled with a Shimano 250 or 300 te is a great combo. As far as lures use whatever you want on pike as long as it is a spoon 1zo daredevils and len thompsons are deadly as well as Dr. spooons, and mepps cyclops. Plastics have there place at times and some glide baits and top water are good at times, But always remember the spoons they probably out fish the others 2 to 1, in my opinion. Good luck and have a good trip. Atlanta dave."
537422,Guest,2004-02-14 07:40:00,0,I'll give you the best tip yet. Ask for Kenny to guide your boat. You won't be dissapointed.
537425,Guest,2004-02-14 11:58:00,0,"I imagine Pike is your target. That time of year, bring your muskie stuff. Fish 'em just like you'd fish Muskies in Mn or Wisco."
537426,Atlanta Dave,2004-02-14 12:06:00,323,You will find you do not want to fish stuff as big as you do for muskies. Also you will not need that heavy; a rod or line. Atlanta Dave
537321,Guest,2004-02-11 08:18:00,0,"8 of us are going to Wollaston Lake Lodge, Saskatchewan, Canada the last week of July and have no clue as to the type of spinning tackle, line size, or lures to take. Any recommendations would be appreciated. We are good fishermen who fish for bass, Redfish and Trout (saltwater), but have never fished for Walleye, Northerns, or Grayling. I use 10 lb Fireline on most of my fishing down here. Please help!!"

537332,Guest,2004-02-11 08:22:00,0,"First of all get rid of the fireline...these walleyes are quite line shy. Try berkley xl 8# or 6#, I use ande's 6 # and it works great!!"
537334,Guest,2004-02-11 08:32:00,0,jellyworm: Try justfisontario.com and they have a list of equipment. Good Luck.
537335,Gary_IA,2004-02-11 08:41:00,144,"Many of the lodges and outpost operators will have suggested tackle lists to bring along. The outfitter listed below has a ""Planner"" that includes such a list as well as a overview of such subjects of food care and bears, insects and what to do about them, boat safety, drinking, dealing with law enforcement and customs. I suggest that the planner is good information for anyone going fishing in Canada even if you are not going to stay at Slate Falls Outposts. www.slatefallsoutposts.com"
537337,Guest,2004-02-11 09:30:00,0,"Hmmm... From what I know of this place pike is the main attraction. By late July the pike won't be in the shallow bays for the most part so I'll take a guess that they'll likely be in cabbage weeds close to deep water in depths of 5-10'. Medium heavy baitcasting tackle will probably serve you well. Spoons, spinnerbaits, and some big cranks like the Salmo Whitefish, or the Shallow Raider should work. Big plastics on jigs can be a really good backup. Grayling I've never fished for, but from what I've heard they like river areas, and light spinning tackle with spinners, tiny jigs and the like work. Or flies. For walleyes spinning tackle and jigs. Bring a selection of sizes from 1/8 to 3/8. Bait is best, but plastic grubs work too. Berkley makes excellent products. When you're there listen to your guide!"
537339,orchard frank,2004-02-11 12:29:00,1900,"I fished Wolloston that same week several years ago. Super Shad Raps absolutly killed the northerns and seemed to target the larger ones. I would recommend a heavier outfit than 10# not that you couldn't get them in but heavier allows a more efficient fight,easier on the fish, and get back in the water for another. The walleyes did not run real big, you are getting to the northern edge of their range. Definitely nice ones and scrappy, for us about 5# tops. Jigs and plastic worked well on spinning/mono gear. We also did well on lakers with jigs and spoons on 3-ways, especially big Red-Eyes. Good luck you have about 21 hours of daylight to fish, check to see if you can use the boats after the guided day is done."
537343,Larry S,2004-02-11 18:52:00,666,"Either call the Lodge at 1-800-328-0628 or e-mail them at [email protected]. Tell them you are going to their lodge,the dates you are going, and ask them to tell you what kind of tackle,line and lures to take on your trip. They will know what you need to take Larry S"
537345,Guest,2004-02-11 19:36:00,0,Coming to Canada heh. Locally and in the fly in post around here we use jigs and lots of them. You will be fishing a canadian shield lake and late in July Walleye will be 15-20 ft. 1/4 oz jigs are good for this. Flurocarbon line is best. Use frozen or live bait ( minnows) Early morning and just as the sun hits the trees is the best time for walleye. Welcome to Canada !!!
537346,Guest,2004-02-11 19:38:00,0,In addition to last. Use a ultra-light rod /reel and 6lb line.
