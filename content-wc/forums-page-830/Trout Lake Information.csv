537225,Scaup,2004-02-08 14:41:00,9,Looking for information about Trout Lake. We are going to be staying at Trout Lake Lodge and have never fished this lake before. Could anyone give us an idea as to where to start out our first day. We are going on the June 6th week. Which bays are typically producing Walleye at that time of year? Any info on lake trout fishing would be very helpfull. Thanks

537276,Guest,2004-02-10 05:57:00,0,"yea sorry about the the mix up on what lodge you were staying at. We stay at Catisland Lodge which is on the other end of the lake. We normally boat all the way up past were you will be staying and fish long channel, kesic bay and right accros the lake we fish joyce bay. We always go up the last week of May or the first week of June and do really well on walleyes northern and lake trout. That time of year the trout are still up so we cast lil cleos or troll with flutter spoons weighted down with rubber core sinkers. good luck and just ask if you want more help"
537288,Scaup,2004-02-10 09:48:00,9,"Thanks for the help... Right now I am trying get information on baits are used. What artifical lures where used, and if any other bait was used, such as cisco's, crawlers, or minnows. If you could help that would be great. Thanks,"
537290,scar,2004-02-10 10:12:00,196,"scaup, call me wednesday night.you will need crawlers only. use spin n glows or jigs for eyes and blue sr9 shad raps or spoons for trout. northerns will pound anything. pack light as there are some spots for walleyes where you can take any lure in your tackle box that you have never used or caught a fish on and the walleyes will inhale it! scar"
537293,Scaup,2004-02-10 11:06:00,9,"Scar - Will do, I'll call Wednesday. Thanks"
