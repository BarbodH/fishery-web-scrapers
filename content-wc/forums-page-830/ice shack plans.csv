It would be easy to haul by hand on the ice and would fit in most car trunks. Once you get out of the wind it is quite comfortable. Just a zipper for a door would be adequate. You can use the old ""roll of toilet paper soaked in alcohol inside a tabacco tin"" heater if you want to warm your hands."
