We have owned ours for some time now and we have ours insured with a local N.Ontario company, they keep hastling us about the exchange rate.Our home owners here in the states won't insure outside the country(Allstate) Do you know of other companys that insure up there? Not a really big problem of coarse, just wish I could spend more time up there !!! thanks"

So I have an account with a canadian bank, which gets me the best exchange rate and allows automatic withdrawals for the phone and hydro as well. I looked at Farm Buerau insurance down here,as they would insure the cottage, but the rate was badly inflated by comparision."

Yes, the bank account sounds like the way to go, Thanks"
537397,Guest,2004-02-13 05:59:00,0,"Our place is on Dinorwic-Wabigoon lake, 25 miles east of Dryden. The fishing's not bad and we are 1 hour from Lac Seul and pretty close to a lot of other good water. Wish I were there now!"
