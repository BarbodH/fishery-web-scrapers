Lots of rocks between Deception and the Zigzag-suggest getting a map. A bridge was built on a new logging road over Loon Rapids last year. Really made it ugly and changed the flow somewhat."

Look at map, Loon Rapids is way before Deception Light, shortly after leaving Deception boat launch you turn hard right to North then left to the North East to Loon Rapids on the way to Sen Bay. You will be going North East and you must go North East as far as you can in this bay, it is a narrow opening and you have to be right there to see it. hard to find. Never had a GPS years ago. The Zig Zag is also on the way to Sen Bay. Look to the East end of Sen Bay you will see a river like arm heading south follow down the water way makes a Z about three miles long.Keep following on this arm South and you will come to Loon Rapids they should be marked on all maps. Great fishing in Sen Bay. Hawkeye"
