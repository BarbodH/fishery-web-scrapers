537221,Guest,2004-02-08 11:24:00,0,"We were up at Williams Lake Lodge around 5 years ago. We stayed in their outpost cabin and had a great time. The outpost cabin is around a 10 min boat ride to the main camp. We would head into camp for bait, supplies, and a hot shower. The camp is clean but not fancy. The boats were in great shape, motors new if I recall. Prices were very reasonable and Pete and his staff were very helpfull with any of our requests. I had taken with me a fish locator and it stopped working on the second day and Pete loaned me one of his at no charge.(Class Act) Fishing for walleyes was nothing short of fantastic. Only problem we had was catching slot fish small enough to keep. Beautiful area and boat ride through the channel from Williams Lake to Lac Seul. Only tough part of the trip was the logging road into camp. You might consider the outpost cabin if you like piece and quiet with the exception of the loons singing to you. With that said good luck"
537248,Guest,2004-02-09 10:17:00,0,We went up two years ago and had a great time. Cabins were nice and brand new boats and motors. The walleye fishing was great if you like to catch the big ones. We went up to broadcast lake and caught tons of smaller walleyes that we took back. The norhtern fishing was awesome. Took me and my pal five minutes to get to our favorite spot. Caught two 40+ inchers and many fish in the mid to high 30s. we will be going up this year in late june.
537249,Guest,2004-02-09 11:41:00,0,"THIS WILL BE MY 6TH YEAR COMING UP THAT I'VE STAYED AT OUTPOST. FISHING IS ALWAYS FANTASTIC, THE PIECE AND QUIET OF THE OUTPOST ARE A BIG PLUS FOR ME, WE LIKE TO LET OUR HAIR DOWN AND TIP A FEW AT NIGHT AND DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANYONE COMPLAINING EXCEPT THOSE THAT GO TO BED EARLY. HAVE FOUND FANTASTIC WALLEYE SPOTS THAT PRODUCE YEAR AFTER YEAR. IF YOU END UP GOING, LET ME KNOW AND I'LL HELP YOU WITH A FEW SPOTS. GOOD LUCK"
537256,Guest,2004-02-09 12:44:00,0,where would these spots be... our favorite spot for northern is on williams lake at the inlet into the channel. for walleye we fished mainly the shore by the rangers cabin.
