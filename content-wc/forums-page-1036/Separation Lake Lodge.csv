511101,DaveIN,2001-02-14 19:09:00,191,I made a reservation for the last week of August for the campground based on some of the recent posts.Can any one tell me how many miles of gravel road I will have getting there.Always did fly-ins before.Also is there anything else that I should know.DaveIN
511102,Guest,2001-02-14 20:23:00,0,"Dave, You'll go north off Hwy. Bypass 17 up Redditt Road (Ontario Route 658) 15 miles PAVED then just before the Town of Redditt you turn left at the fork and continue up to Seperation Lake 30 miles UNPAVED. The last stretch is pretty dusty but not to rough. Watch out for the logging trucks coming down the opposite direction their flying! Good Fishing. Post when you get back."
511103,Jeremy,2001-02-15 11:38:00,76,Dave the 30 miles of gravel road can be very rough at times last year when we drove into the campground it was raining so it wasent very dusty but took about 1 hour and 15 minutes when we left it was dry and the road had gotten a lot worst and took almost 2 hours we were pulling fiberglass boats so we took our time. If you are going to be pulling a boat make sure you have some kind of rock protection. If your not pulling a boat it wont be to bad. You need to watch out for the logging trucks. I will be their the last week of August.
511104,DaveIN,2001-02-17 16:41:00,191,I will also be there the last week of August. Look for pickup camper from Indiana and a Crestliner.Look forward to meeting youDave DietrichLafayette IN
511105,Brian,2001-02-17 17:01:00,140,"Dave, we have been up there the last two years. The first year it was dry so the road was VERY dusty. Use a boat cover if you have one. The road was also very bumpy. Had to retighten some screws when I got back home. Last year it had rained alot when we went so obviously no dust but the roads were still muddy and rough. Slow going both times. We will be up there August 20-25th. Its a great place!!Brian"
