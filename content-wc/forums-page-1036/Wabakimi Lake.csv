I fished this lake last year in July. But used a different outfitter.This lake is very big.I didn't have good luck down by your cabin.There is some pretty` deep water . Down by our cabin we aught some 27"" walleye. There are some rapids by our cabin tha was ver productive. We would pull in and drift back out.Several 5#lb taken that way. We caugh 1 40"" northern but not on purpose. We just fished for Walleye . Seen alot of big northern in the grass beds. Troll right next to the rocky banks on south side between the cabins. Depth finder is a must. It will put you right on them. E-mail if you need more info. GoodLuck!! Jimmy"

Best fishing advice is to really pick the brains of the people you are replacing as to where they found fish and how they got them. If you need info on the outfit, just let me know.Kurt"

We caught fish right where they said."
