510822,TangledAngler,2001-02-16 06:55:00,65,Thanks for the info guys. I spend most of my time fishing around the mouth of the French. Someone recommended Woolsely Bay. Can I get there without portage from the lake. Just curious.
510823,Guest,2001-02-23 09:35:00,0,"Woleseley Bay is below Chaudier Dam and Five Fingers Rapids. You can drive to it, but I don't think there's a water route from the lake."
510812,Guest,2001-01-30 09:56:00,0,I am interested in the walleye and musky fishing in the Upper French River from lake Nippissing down past Dokis. Any information on the fishing in this area would be appreciated.
510813,Guest,2001-02-02 09:45:00,0,Anybody have any information at all?
510814,Guest,2001-02-02 22:35:00,0,"Bob, I have fished the upper French since 1991 out of Chaudiere Lodge, which is an outstanding lodge. There is huge musky is the river and lake, but not as numerous as the Winnipeg River. The smallmouth fishing is pretty good. The walleye fishing is so-so. I recommend a bottom bouncer or 3 way rig with a minnow or nightcrawler harness for walleye, especially behind Partridge Island in 20-40 feet, depending on the time of year. The best time for walleye is September. If you want 2 to 4 lb pike action, try 5 Mile Bay. Trolling around Sugar Loaf island with a bucktail sometimes produces big musky and pike. If the current is good, then walleye can be can on the edge of the channel north of this island. I recommend 3 and 1/2"" tubes on 1/8 and 1/4 ounces tube heads for smallmouth. Good luck, Don"
510815,Guest,2001-02-06 10:59:00,0,Thanks Don. I was told of big fish being there but it is not a numbers area also. Walleye may be on the rebound too. There was a 50 pound muskie caught by the MNR in the nets last year but that is all I have heard. I know of Chaudierre Lodge and heard it was a nice place.
510816,Guest,2001-02-12 05:48:00,0,"Great place to fish. I've fished out of Sandy Haven Camp on Sandy Island near the mouth of the river for the last 15 or so years and it's been great for all species. Don, I've never really boated too far down river. How far is Chaudiere Lodge from the mouth and how long would it take by boat to get from there to the mouth of the river?"
510817,Guest,2001-02-12 15:27:00,0,"Tangled, Chaudiere Lodge with a 20 HP on a 18 foot wooden boat that they have there, going I estimate 18 to 20 mph is 30 to 35 minutes from the mouth of the French. I have made it in 15 minutes on the rare occasion when in a larger boat going 35 mph or so. The lodge is top notch, including the food. They hire college students majoring in hospitality degrees and chef majors, and had 3 chefs when I was there is 2000. Don"
510818,Guest,2001-02-13 05:32:00,0,"Don, I've already booked this year's trip at Sandy Haven. The fishing around there is pretty good as we spend most of our time around the mouth of the French. Would you recommend boating further down the French to give those areas a shot. I have a 16.5 foot aluminum bass boat with a 50 hp. Moves us about 22-24 mph."
510819,Guest,2001-02-13 10:22:00,0,"Tangled, the fishing for walleye is better at the mouth to the Partridge Island area and Keystone. Musky and smallmouth is about the same downstream as the mouth. The scenery is more remote appearing down the Little French and Reynolds Bay. In September the walleye fishing is ok downstream. For pike up to 28 inches, if you care for that, I recommend Reynolds and Five Mile Bay. Good luck, Don"
510820,Marc,2001-02-14 20:46:00,12,"I guided on Lake Nipissing from '93 to '99 until I moved to the Bay of Quinte. The walleye fishery was in steady decline until they (the MNR)introduced a slot and lower limits. At last report from a close friend who still lives there, the walleye fishery has rebounded tremendously with 40 to 50 fish days not uncommon, however 99% of the catch falls within the slot. Chartreuse jigs with stingers and night crawlers, Nipissing blue jigs with shiners, and walking sinkers w/bead swivel/3' lead/ floater/red bead/ chartreuse spinner all produce. For smallmouth go out into the main lake, the river is full of dinks. Use white spinnerbaits with a touch of orange and golden shiner tube jigs. Try around Sandy Island/Goose Island/Wigwam Island for larger fish in the 3 to 4 lb class. South Bay is also very good. I ran a ProCraft/150 hp so I had no problem scooting around. Chaudiere Lodge comes highly recommended. Gerry, your host, has a degree in hospitality/hotellery from Cornell, so he knows what he's doing. The food is second to none. If you drop in, tell him Marc says hi. Good Luck and Enjoy."
510821,Guest,2001-02-15 15:05:00,0,"Hi Marc, Enjoyed the times you guided me on Nippising for smallmouth. My daughter Joanna had a good time too, along with John Graham and his buddy Walter when they went. How's the fishing on Quinte? For those others anglers here, Marc has won the Nippising Bassmasters. I believe he is the definitive authority on fishing the upper French and Lake Nippissing. I recommend him as a guide to those interested.Marc, I wish they would raise the Musky limit to 48 or 54 inches on the French and Nippissing. It has done wonders for the Winnipeg River.Thanks again for the memories, Don Correll"
