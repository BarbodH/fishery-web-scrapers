511175,Pooch,2001-02-24 14:43:00,4619,"Average fishing, lots of pressure, big camp, easy to get to, good family place. I have recommended it to several people over the years. It was Ok. But, we prefer small camps. We did see a number of very nice Canadian walleye come in during the week. Enough fish to keep you busy. We've been on better lakes. Owners seem to be concentrating on dollars. If the camp wasn't constantly getting larger (added cabins) we would have returned, because my wife liked the cabin. I don't want to knock the camp because many folks return year after year. Different strokes for different folks.Pooch in Central Illinois"
