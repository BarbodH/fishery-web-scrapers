1201169,2746,2010-05-17 09:34:00,3206,How lenient? Not lenient enough to let 70 mph go by. On the other hand the ticket was only $65 and when we stopped in Ear Falls a little later the guy at 4 seasons said that speed could draw over $300 so sounds like the guy was lenient in that respect. (als very nice about it) A good reminder to use the cruise control!

Two years ago I did get pulled over by a Barney Fife (First Nations Officer). The first thing he asked me was if that was my first time driving through the area. The second thing he wanted to know was what my profession was, I was waiting for him to ask me for a bribe but it never happened. He said to slow down or the OPP would ticket me."
1201213,Guest,2010-05-17 11:31:00,0,"I haven't been stopped in several years, but my son was ticketed a couple years back. He mailed in the check when he got home. Pony express was slow so his check got there late. They would not accept it because the late fee was not included. He called in and put the fine and late fee on his credit card. He was notified later that they would not accept his credit card payment and was given another late fee. His mother ended up calling the border where he crossed and put all of it, ticket and two late fees, on our credit card. They accepted that but threatened to put out an arrest warrant for my son. What a mess. It's easier to drive the limit and not give them an opportunity to make a decision."
1200596,celticbass1,2010-05-15 05:32:00,67,SO does anyone have experience with exactly how lenient....or not the police are in Ontario? In the U.S. I think it's generally accepted that if you go less than 10 MPH over the limit MOST of the time your pretty safe in not getting a ticket. So do they use the same rule but make it 10 kilometers per hour? Just wondering what your experiences have been.
1200605,81Saluki,2010-05-15 06:29:00,97,"For the most part, I now try to stay within 5mph of the posted speed limit in ""populated areas"". But there are 3 ""country"" stretches that I have difficulty with from Fort Frances to Vermilion Bay: the Couchiching stretch near the Rainy River bridge (Hwy 11), the stretch west to Emo (Hwy 11), and all along 502.Several years ago I was returning home, traveling west on Hwy 11 towards Fort Frances in the Couchiching area where the speed limit goes from 55 to 30mph. I was still doing 55+ and came upon a police car heading the other direction. He flashed his lights and, when we passed each other, he shook his finger at me as if to say ""caught you â€¦ slow down!"" but continued on. I was lucky ... I'm sure he was responding to a call that was more important than stopping a speeder. I'm now more observant of the speed limit there.Also, now that the 502 road conditions have improved, it's *really* hard to observe the 80kph (48mph) limit even when pulling the boat. We usually go 60-ish mph and haven't been stopped yet (knock on wood). For what it's worth, I think they generally don't stop people on 502 because there are no shoulders to pull over onto. Last year, we were following a logging truck doing about 55mph ... slow for our tastes. We were waiting for a place to pass when a police car came up from behind, passed us, and turned on his lights. This lasted for about 10-15 miles (seemed like an eternity) before the trucker pulled into the next ""load check"" area. We tried to stay under 55mph after that ... but it was hard. :-)"
1200607,Minnow Man,2010-05-15 06:29:00,85,"I just know I shouldn't say this, but I haven't had a speeding ticket in over 20 years. I have been lucky cause I do deserve one. Try my best to keep it just going over by 7-9 kms posted speed limit, many times I have said 'they got me"" but they have always let me go while driving over the posted speed limit by 7-9 kms. Maybe just lucky, it's not a rule. I know if you go over by 10 kms you'll pay. While traveling on the roads in Ontario watch for moose, they make a lousy hood ornament."
1200610,Obabikon,2010-05-15 07:06:00,2370,I'm like minnow man... 9kms over.
1200611,Obabikon,2010-05-15 07:07:00,2370,"oh, and i've been pulled over for 13km's over. (dang speed zones on 11)"
1200737,Blue Lk,2010-05-15 18:54:00,269,"If you stay with 10 kms of posted limit,you shud be OK,I normaly drive 100 km/hr even on the hwys posted 80,no tickets yet.It seems 100 k is the magic #,over that & you are fair game for the OPP.A reminder,the OPP set up in Vermilion Bay at least 2 times a week,you better be obeying the limit, 60 kpm.I see people getting ticketed in VBay every time I drive thru if the OPP have a speed trap set up."
1200801,biggamefisher,2010-05-16 05:51:00,540,"It's got nothing really to do with a set amount of km's over......most law enforcement agencies set their units up with a tolerance. Most if not all use 15%, but it's officers discretion. So, using 15%, it will vary with the actual posted limit.......anyone over that 15% get's a ticketed."
1200819,515,2010-05-16 07:05:00,254,Never depend on anything being safe. It's all going to depend on the mood of the man or woman holding the radar that day. I try to stay under the 10km over limit and never had any problems.
1200835,Pooch,2010-05-16 07:35:00,4619,"A bunch of my old friends are police officers. Seems to me that most share the attitude that fast enough, unsafe enough or flagrant enough to make it worth our time. Common sense usually prevails. Police really are not out to get you unless you give them good reason. That's why they are called ""peace officers"". Pooch"
1200877,elway12,2010-05-16 09:46:00,335,"My group got a ticket two years ago on 17 by Raith for going 10km over. Even though atleast 5 cars had been racing by us at 15-20km over but we came over a hill and the OPP officer was there to nab us. Pretty much gave us the stern ""slow it down"" speech. We still don't know how he missed them. We now put the cruise control at 9km over and slow down when going thru towns between T.B. and Savant Lake."
