507408,Guest,2000-03-16 17:30:00,0,I am going to Lake Mirond in the last week of May. Is there any one out there who has fished this lake at about this time? If there is what are the best tips you can give me! I will be Pike and walleye fishing. Thing needed most is lures and colors and places on the lake! I am staying at the Newmart Lodge. Thanks before hand for your help and troubles. Mike Murphy
507409,Guest,2000-03-19 10:03:00,0,"I assume you are talking re: Mirond in Sask. I was there the first time in 1969, and numerous trips since, but not for about 10 years. Always stayed at campground at Bayview Camp. Great camping!You may be going a bit early, my '69 trip was this early, and we found the fish somewhat lethargic, a little ice was still in the bays. The best bait is a 1/8 -1/4 oz jig with a bit of walleye meat on it.Very good fishing can be found by taking the portage into Cornielle(sp?)Lake. Portage is tricky and potentially more work/excitment than you may want.Email me if you want details; there are some spots in Mirond that used to be good. The only reason we stopped going is that it is too far from Cedar Rapids. Bill"

I thought Charlie retired and sort of turned the place into his retirement haven, so I am surprised he is still in business. We camped with some folks from ND, and from Prince Albert. A fellow named Dan Schmitz and I canoe portaged into a lake trout lake up the road a few miles. Bill Krejca"

1200837,Guest,2010-05-16 07:42:00,0,Not nearly as much as I would like. I do most of my fishing in Fl in the winter these days. I would like to go back to Mirond but it is so far. Are you still building rods?
1200908,Bill Krejca,2010-05-16 12:15:00,6107,"I still build a few each year, as well as help friends. We have 4 or 5 going right now. Back to the Mirond Lake question from Mike - Mike - send me email, I'll try to pinpoint what worked in 1985, if you wish. Also, do a WC search on Mirond - there is some good info in the posts. Bill Krejca"
1201467,Guest,2010-05-18 06:27:00,0,The last time I was there we found Walleyes where we hadn't even fished before. Just before the portage to Corneille there is swift water where we could see fish. We back trolled slowyl agaisnt the current and tool our limit in Walleyes. The jig needed to be just off the bottom.
