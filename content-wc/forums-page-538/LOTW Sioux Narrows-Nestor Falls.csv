1200887,nicko,2010-05-16 10:28:00,508,"Thanks......any particular spots? We'll be at white pine lodge on the far east side of the bay.....I have caught quite a few nice walleye at night there. We also caught some good largemouth in the shallow back bay. I want to target some bigger fish this time. We got quite a few smaller pike < 30"". Want to try for some bigger pike, and some smallmouth too. Thanks again.....Nick"
1200959,jimirjr,2010-05-16 16:39:00,1149,"Obabikon.... I'm not familiar with the HAY Island are.... where is it in relation to Sioux Narrows? Normally, we head to the Northwest from the Narrows...."
1200964,scotttheguide,2010-05-16 17:01:00,73,"Go all the way South in Whitefish Bay until you run out of Lake, put your boat on the manual rail portage and cross over into Turtle Lake. Drive thru Turtle Lake, out the channel and look South. That first big land mass you see is Hay Island. Just follow the South Track out of Sioux Narrows. If you are feeling adventureous it is pretty cool. To much work for me, I will just go into Lobstick and catch crappie."
1200966,Obabikon,2010-05-16 17:07:00,2370,"Sorry, thought you were coming out of Nestor."
1200971,nicko,2010-05-16 17:50:00,508,"Thanks...Just how far is that? What can I expect from there? How about Whitefish, Yellow girl and Lobstick? I might even try to go towards Obabikon.... Any other places? Nick"
1201019,Obabikon,2010-05-16 19:48:00,2370,If you come all the way over here... you'll have to hit up the elbow in Obabikon Lake and Bottle Bay on the north side of Miles.
1201028,Lazy Fisherman,2010-05-16 20:23:00,276,scott Will give The Dockhouse a try. I think that is the place we went into last year.
1201054,scotttheguide,2010-05-16 22:22:00,73,"Laz, A couple of cold Blues, Pizza and Wings, it's a little taste of home in the middle of a fishing paradise. The guys that own the place are some good fishermen from the area, a bar built by fishermen for fishermen. Maybe I will see you there.Nic, It will take you about 30-40 mnutes depending on your boat to get to the portage. If you want to take a day trip it should be fun. If you get down there and dont want cross over there is good fishing in that whole area down there for Bass, Pike and Walleye. Work the shorelines around the island with grubs and shad raps. You will catch a variety. The Walleye you catch will be bigger, its not unusual to catch some 26 - 30"" walleye on crank baits down there. The water is clear so natural colors work best. Please practice CPR in that area, I do allot of fishing down there with guys that want to catch trophy size walleyes during the Summer. You don't get as many but they tend to run bigger and when you get into them its a blast."
1201189,nicko,2010-05-17 10:18:00,508,"Perfect Info......No issue getting boat there (05 Lund 1800 pro-V). Might be difficult portaging the boat. I don't keep many fish. I keep eaters for when we are there but all the big ones get a picture and a new lease on life. Pictures last forever, a wall mount doesn't. Of course the real reason is my wife refuses to have that crap on a wall in the house. I pick my battles wisely... This is great info.....I have never been to that area. Whats the best passage and approach from Snake Bay? Thanks again...Nick"
1200413,nicko,2010-05-14 10:01:00,508,"All: I will be heading up June 26-July 3rd. I am looking for some new spots to target eyes and smallies. Anyone have any suggestions? Given the early ice-out and conditions, i'm expecting a bit more of a summer pattern if the weather holds true. I am staying at lodging in Snake Bay, but for sure will be traveling up to yellow Girl and beyond. Suggestions on spots, patterns and techniques? Thanks...Nick"
1200494,Guest,2010-05-14 15:18:00,0,"follow a Totem guide boat, like everybody else does !"
1200558,muskyman73,2010-05-14 20:17:00,402,"Stay out of snake bay, there is a reason they named it that. We did well running across whitefish, fishing the islands. The northern are big, too. Make long casts, and reel in fast. Don't give the fish a chance to follow your lure. We got some follows on muskies, but no takers. The best fishing we had was in foul weather too. Hope for rain."
1200575,scotttheguide,2010-05-14 21:42:00,73,"""Follow the Totem guides boats like everyone else does"" Now thats funny,LOL."
1200658,Lazy Fisherman,2010-05-15 12:11:00,276,scotttheguide Time for you to get up there and catch some of those walleyes. We are going to try Sioux Narrows in August. Have gone in early September before. Hopefully it will work out.
1200683,scotttheguide,2010-05-15 14:21:00,73,"Laz,Couple of days away! There is no bad time to fish LOTW and Sioux Narrows is a great area. Not as remote as some people like, I know that. But a great area that allows you easy access to allot of LOTW in any direction and the ability to fish clear or stained water. If you get a chance stop in ""The Dockhouse"" downtown and try the pizza and some wings, not bad. Tell them ""Smitty sent you"", no on second thought don't, they might charge you double,LOL. Sioux Narows has allot to offer for a small town and allot of great folks that appreciate your business. You have a couple of Marina's, a Liquor Store, Bait Shop, Groceries, Siouveniers and Paramedic Station just in case. Also some eating establishments that have great food if you don't want to cook or if your trip does not include a meal plan. It a great area located on a great fishery."
1200704,jimirjr,2010-05-15 16:19:00,1149,My group is heading up to Tomahawk Resort for a 10 day houseboat trip in mid Septemeber..... we love It!! Now if someone would just tell us how to CRAPPIE fish..... and where? We'd be in heaven!!
1200708,Obabikon,2010-05-15 16:31:00,2370,Hay island too far?
1200739,nicko,2010-05-15 19:08:00,508,"I agree, We like the area too So how about great spots to try around sioux narrows? Besides following the over-priced totem boats? Walleye? Smallmouth Pike? Lakers? what areas should I concentrate on? I know snake bay isn't ideal, but are there any areas in there to stop at? Thanks for all the replies so far. Nick"
1200783,scotttheguide,2010-05-16 00:35:00,73,"There are allot of good spots in Snake Bay to catch all the above. You can catch some big Walleyes there in the evening especially, also if its raining. Troll shallow shad raps or floating rapalas just outside the weed beds. 5 -15', you will catch fish."
