Back in the early 80's I was fishing there in with my parents and saw a school of suckers (Blue Lake lives on a lake that is ""gin clear"") that must have consisted of 2 to 3 hundred fish. In the middle of them was a larger, darker fish - swiming right with them just as if it was schooling with them - a muskie of about 25 lbs... I cast in front of it and past it about thirty feet with a bucktail. The fish didn't scatter until the muskie sensed the bait and went ""on point."" At that point, the suckers scattered in every direction as the muskie started to follow to the boat. He didn't hit, but it was cool/weird to see how they react to a predator's posture and such...DC"
1202504,Kevin R,2010-05-21 05:00:00,305,Does your lake stay clear all year or does it only stay clear in spring ?A lot of gin clear lakes back in the 1960's & early 1970's are no longer gin clear by late July.
