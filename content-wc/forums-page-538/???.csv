For this year's Savant Lake trip, we're going to save money by leaving the night of 7/6 and driving all the way to West Caribou Air without staying overnight somewhere. We usually stock up on snacks and stuff at the Dryden WallyWorld, but we'll be going through there in the wee hours of the morning and I want to make sure it's going to be open!"

1201863,Bob_Loblaw,2010-05-19 07:40:00,109,Thanks - that's what I needed to know! We'll just have to get our stuff in Bemidji before we leave. It'll be cheaper that way anyway
