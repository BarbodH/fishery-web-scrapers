1202181,cowboyd,2010-05-20 01:14:00,33,"I have been taking them up there for years. I have taken lowrance 85 up, several HBs and my current one is the HB797c2i. ( btw the fellow with the 798 should be aware he needs to turn down the screen brightness or that puppy will burn throught the batteries). I like every advantage and since I fish some of these waters only once a year I like as much info as possible. The side and down imaging is worth the extra battery bs for finding cover that would never be seen any other way. As far as what is really needed a good bottom picture is all as long as you know how to read the difference between soft and hard bottoms. Good LuckCowboyd"
1202224,Pezman38,2010-05-20 07:14:00,3196,If you like what you have I would suggest the following: Get a deepcycle battery box Mount a jonny ray swivel or a ram to the top Put a battery in there from your old boat Put your fishfindger on the mount and hook it up to the battery Get a transducer and mount it to a piece of wood and use a C clamp to attach the ducer to the transom Or you can get a portable transducer. Materials would be around $40.
1202288,labsrus,2010-05-20 10:50:00,557,"On our trip last year I used my LMS 522 unit from my boat. I purchased asecond transduce with the suction cup attachment, made a board with the ram mount ball on it. I used straps to hold the boatd down on the seat. Purchased a small 12 volt battery, that lasted 1 to 2 days and used a solar powered panel to keep the battery charged. Worked really good. I had a small tool box that I loaded all the stuff into for transportation to the lake via float plane."
1198654,Hawkfan,2010-05-10 08:25:00,237,I got a portable Eagle unit last year and it worked great. Everything in one easy-to-pack case and batteries lasted all week.
1198752,elmo,2010-05-10 11:45:00,43,I made mine out of an old small tackle box with the bracket mounted in the lid when you open it. Then it lays in the bottm of the box on foam when not in use. The 2 - 6 volt batts are on each side at the bottom of the box held apart with the foam. You can either make a bracket for the transducer or buy one.
1198794,NYBowHunter,2010-05-10 13:57:00,35,We've been using this same model for years as well - inexpensive and works great! Even shows the contours when running the boat at higher speeds - a feature lacking with the cheaper Hummingbirds.
1198932,eyemike,2010-05-10 19:12:00,233,"Pete, I use an Eagle portable unit that works pretty good. I personally suggest to get a unit with the rechargeable battery, replacing batteries tends to get spendy. Mike"
1198960,polaris-pete,2010-05-10 20:25:00,343,Thanks to all that replied. Pete
1199837,Dacotah Eye,2010-05-12 19:41:00,2722,I have an Eagle Fish Easy and a battery for a Vexliar flasher fits right into the battery compartment. The battery connections are already set up for this type of battery. I have gone longer than a week using this setup.
1200345,speckeye,2010-05-14 06:06:00,61,"My buddy and I are taking an HB 798 SI unit with downscan.We got a triple suction cup Ram mount that fits on about any aluminum boat,with a pigtail out to the tromo battery.I feel dirty,but I shall perservere."
1201186,Mojo-NC,2010-05-17 10:08:00,1931,"If you already have a Garmin 80, 90, 100, 120, 140 160, 160C, or 240 fishfinder and transducer, you can get a case that allows you to convert the unit to portable. The case retails for about $60 from Garmin, but you can get it elsewhere online for about $40 USD. It comes with a mounting bracket for the GPS unit, Garmin connection wires, a suction mount for your transducer, and a battery pack (for use with 8 D-cell batteries). Everything fits nicely in the case. To avoid burning up a lot of expensive D-cell batteries, I recommend you also purchase a rechargeable gel cell battery. Garmin Part Number: 010-10254-00"
1201202,polaris-pete,2010-05-17 11:00:00,343,Yes I looked into the portable plastic box and for my Matrix 17 and they had been discontinued but still had them for 4100. Then I had to buy a rechargeable 12 volt battery and a replacement portable transducer as I am not taking the one off my boat. It would a lot more than just getting a cheaper unit. All I want it for is bottom contour and depth anyways. Thanks though.
1201526,Mike Kansas,2010-05-18 10:11:00,1463,"Been useing them for years. Have Hummingbird and Eagle. Both work great and new batteries last a week...but I do take back Up batteries. Good Luck, Mike Kansas Sirmanski"
1197848,polaris-pete,2010-05-07 17:14:00,343,"I am looking to buy a new portable fishfinder to take into remote lakes where I cannot take my own boat. I was going to get a portable powerbox for my Humminbird Matrix but it was over $100 so I think I will just buy a new portable for alittle more and have a seperate unit..I am looking at either the Eagle Cuda 300 or the Humminbird PiranhaMax 150. I would appreciate any info on either of these, pros or cons. Thanks."
1198264,SinOrSwim,2010-05-08 22:12:00,1528,I don't know anything about those two but if you made yours portable you are already familiar with it and know how everything works. Definitely a positive.
1198382,Guest,2010-05-09 11:09:00,0,I had thought about doing that but the Portable Power Pack was over $100 and now see they have been discontinued. They are also pretty big compared to the other 2 new units.
1198465,polaris-pete,2010-05-09 16:26:00,343,Wow- I must be the only one on here that uses a portable fishfinder on trips!
1198507,Glenman12,2010-05-09 18:46:00,762,Im not familiar with either unit...we use an Eagle Fishmark 320..not even sure if they make that model as a portable unit anymore...been using it for 5 years..I guess it all depends on what features you want..for the most part we just care about depth and water temp..
1198523,Guest,2010-05-09 19:47:00,0,I have a Fish Easy that I have taken for 4 or 5 years. Its worked fine and I run it all week one one set of batts. Last year I wanted to take my finder/Gps so I just took along the Batt off of my lawn mower. worked fine. When we got home I put it back on the mower.
1198550,alanb,2010-05-09 20:56:00,56,"A friend of mine had a nice portable rig he set up. It was an older Hummingbird (probably equal to the PiranhaMax 150) that he has mounted to a piece of wood that had a wood box attached to hold a motorcycle battery, a piece of rope for a handle on the battery box and had the transducer mounted to a 1/2"" x 2"" piece of pine that was held to the transom with a C-clamp. He built this rig for fly-in canoe trips in Canada. The motorcycle battery handled 4 days of heavy use without any loss of power. But, hang on to that C-clamp if your hands are wet and cold. I left one on the bottom of Lake of the Woods! It just showed the small, medium, large fish symbols at a depth. Not real sophisticated showing lots of detail below; but did the job of giving you a depth to follow contours, get an idea of what type of bottom and that you might have fish below. And in my opinion fishing the same lake without then with his fish finder - ANY basic system is worth having. Alanb"
1198595,oleJoe,2010-05-10 05:57:00,114,"I use a eagle cuda that runs on 8 AA batteries that usually last the week. Its on at least 8 hrs a day. Its very basic but I,m just looking at deph and humps. Be sure to tie it on good. This is my second one. Good fishing"
1198611,polaris-pete,2010-05-10 06:56:00,343,This is what I am looking for. Just a basic unit.What do you mean tie it on good?? Your 2nd unit or transducer?
1198612,bassface44,2010-05-10 06:56:00,96,"We have been using portables on our Canadian trips for years and have gone through several iterations. Now we are using two Humminbird 535 units with plastic portable cases and a humminbird 565 soft sider. You can still find the 565 for like 250. Both are amazing units for a Canadian trip. Great resolution, big screens, easy to use. Spend the money on one of these units and you won't be dissappointed."
