We go in August so the camp and equipment are well used by then, but Peter has always taken care of any problem that may arise. Been going here since the mid nineties and will be returning this year. A fellow WC who goes by ""dkin"" has fished Hornby and is from your neck of the woods. Maybe he will see this thread and respond. If not do a search for him or Hornby. Have a great time.Kurt"

When are you going? I live in New Lenox and can send a marked up map to you if you like. We usually vertically jig and pull lindy rigs."
