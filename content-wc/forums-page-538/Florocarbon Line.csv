1196787,still fishin',2010-05-04 21:22:00,69,"Bluff,I always use the improved clinch knot and have used it for over 30 years. Rarely have a breakoff. Used the palomar once last year because I was in a hurry and tying a clinch onto a swivel takes time a little more effort (I was using a Lindy Rig). Thought I could get away with the palomar. Tough lesson.As for the reel, I leave about half of the old line on as backing.I don't know that I catch more fish with flouro than those using mono, but we have 10-14 in our group each year at Cabonga and I have been high hook for 3 years running. I'd like to think I'm just a better fisherman than the others but I know that's not the case. I definitely noticed greater sensitvity with flouro over mono. Good luck."
1196987,Bluff,2010-05-05 11:39:00,152,Still Fishin... thanks for the reply. While I am going up to NW Ontario in late May I am first going to fish some very clear lakes in northern WI. I have fished them for years and the walleye spook easily. I figure might as well try some floro and see what happens.
1197083,Moosebunk,2010-05-05 16:36:00,211,"Have used the BPS stuff in 4,6,8,10,12 & 16lbs. Pretty good, no quams at all really.Very much like Drennan florocarbon. Steelheaders seem to love the stuff most. It's tough!Seaguar is nice too.Trying P-Line Halo out as well. No verdict yet."
1201568,a3dad,2010-05-18 12:02:00,115,"If I'm going to try using 40lbs floro as a leader for pike, does it make any difference if I use ""regular"" floro line or should I go for the ""leader Material"" like Seaguar? The leader material is WAY more expensive. Worth it? thanks, Kevin"
1202177,joeman79,2010-05-19 23:45:00,417,I Like P-Line Flouroclear.
1202180,cowboyd,2010-05-20 00:46:00,33,my favorite line is Yozuri........interesting combination with some stretch but all the benefits of full floro without the inflexibility to rip the hook out of their mouths.cowboyd
1202195,rps,2010-05-20 05:20:00,401,"All of you who use fluorocarbon should google tackle tour. Go to their site and find their testing of fluorocarbon line and of knots. You will probably be surprised at what they found. Sometimes science does not let us keep what we know for sure.Based on the above I use a fluoro + polymer blend made by Yozuri, although I will soon test the Lake Fork blend."
1202632,Mojo-NC,2010-05-21 12:55:00,1931,"Thanks to all for posting their recommendations, as I had the same question as the original post and I'm heading to NW Ontario to fish for walleye next week. I'm torn as I have been using BPS brand fluorocarbon line a lot for local bass fishing here in NC, especially when pitching plastics or using a Carolina Rig, which is similar to the the spinner rig we use in Canada. On the positive, fluorocarbon line does not float or absorb water, it is extremely sensitive line with very little stretch, its light diffraction is nearly identical to water so the fish can't see it, and it is very strong line (if you retie often). On the negative, I've found fluorocarbon line to be stiff and brittle, and I tend to have a fairly high number of break-offs, especially at the knot where the weight and beads are constantly smacking against it. The line also retains memory and comes off the reel in coils which causes an excessive amount of line twisting on spinning reels and backlashes on baitcasters, even after proper installation and dragging the line behind the boat. Is it a brand issue or is all fluorocarbon line as I just described?"
1196005,ret-ro,2010-05-02 20:26:00,41,I really like 6# berkley vanish in clear or red transition.
1196176,camp chef,2010-05-03 10:59:00,915,Silver thread copolymer for me.Using a snap swivel with a jig will almost completely eliminate Northern saw offs while jig fishing and a 10 steel leader when throwing spoons does the trick.That's the way we roll and I dare you to outfish me.
1196208,Moondog,2010-05-03 11:57:00,362,Have had way too many breakoffs with Vanish. Most times at the knot and sometimes just in the line itself. Started using Seaguar when I do need a leader and have had good results. Last 3 years we have used Power Pro 8# green exclusively for all jigging. No line stretch. Great feel. No break offs and have landed almost every NP hooked. Used to also use Silver Thread but it seemed to degrade with use quite quickly.
1196228,Guest,2010-05-03 12:59:00,0,Learn to tye a knot.......User error
1196334,Moondog,2010-05-03 17:18:00,362,Learn to spell. Your point will then have at least some credibility.
1196430,still fishin',2010-05-03 20:38:00,69,I use 8 lb Vanish. Used it for 5 years and have had no break-offs. I switched to P-Line last year and lost the biggest walleye all week. Probably not the line's fault; I tied to the swivel using a palomar knot. Only recently learned not to use palomar with flouro. We live and learn.
1196436,Moondog,2010-05-03 21:02:00,362,"Talked to many people that have had the same experience with Vanish, but consensus was perhaps purchasing this line in a store that has low stock turn over contributed to failure as it seems to have a shelf life. Rarely use swivels especially with PowerPro."
1196511,Mandownriver,2010-05-04 07:43:00,7,"Morning Guys Im heading to Lake Nagagami next week before Walleye season opens for giant pike, I have been following your comments about line and leaders , If you were leaving tomorrow what type of line and leaders would be on your poles for Pike and Walleys."
1196640,Bluff,2010-05-04 14:39:00,152,"Still fishin... What knot do you use now instead of the palomar? Also, when spooling onto a reel are you using a backing or can you use an Arbor knot and tie directly to the spool with the floro line? I'm thinking about trying floro next week in a very clear lake."
1196648,scotttheguide,2010-05-04 15:06:00,73,"I also use PowerPro(8-15# spinning reels, 20-80# baitcasters) on every reel and recommend it to all my guests. I will use 2 to 4' of Flouro if fishn in the clear waters of Whitefish Bay. Brade is hard on your reels though. Its hard on the anti reverse because there is no stretch, but when you wack a fish he gets the hook.My vote is to yes, use Flouro for leaders anyway."
1194548,elway12,2010-04-28 21:43:00,335,Which brand and type of Florocarbon line do use when jigging for Walleye in Canada? I have used many and there are many more on the market. So many choices and types???
1194569,fishforlife,2010-04-29 00:11:00,77,"Elway12, I use Berkley Florocarbon 6 lb for walleye and 15 lb floro for Pike. This line is good for shock power and better for (in) visibility in clearer water.Yes it is a bit more expensive, but worth the money on a fish of a lifetime. I wish you tight lines and better memories.Regards,Rob"
1195049,Bigfishhunter,2010-04-30 07:04:00,803,"I live up in northern manitoba and when jigging for eyes, I get a lot of Northern Pike Strikes, sometimes cutting the line. LEss with braided line like Power Pro etc, but it still happens. ONe thing I have started doing was buying some Fluorocarbon ""leader material"" and tying on 2-3 feet of it. I just buy the lighter stuff, 10 lb, usually sometimes lighter, sometimes heavier. This makes the line invisible, and has stopped my northern bread offs. It is a nice bit of reassurance when the 20 lb pike grabs my jig, cause I really like landing those brutes. I have also gone to using 40 and 50 lb fluorcarbon leader material strictly for pike. I tie a good snap swivel on the one end to allow for quick hook changes and then either use a swivel or a blood or double uni to attach the leader to the main line. I find my lures have a better action, especially those original f18 rapala's, and I can usually outfish my buds using steel leaders 2-1."
1195085,PIKEMAN330,2010-04-30 08:28:00,101,Iuse floro leaders for Pike and Musky but have never felt the need for floro leaders when walleye fishing in Canada or Lake Erie. All the water we fish in Canada are stained so I dont feel we need it. Good fishing Pikeman
1195689,adempsey,2010-05-01 22:25:00,963,"Personally, I don't think it's worth the extra cost to spool up with fluorocarbon for most applications. If you only want it for leader material, Seaguar is probably the most popular. The supposed ""invisible"" characteristics of this line are likely mostly useful for very timid fish, like some trout, but otherwise I think it's all a bunch of bunk. The only real benefit IMO is that it's low stretch line. However, if you want the sensitivity of a no-stretch line, go with braid. Otherwise I'd stick to mono or a hybrid (mono+fluoro)."
1195693,Guest,2010-05-01 22:53:00,0,i wouldnt waste my money. the fish in canada havent gone to hook school.
1195708,rebs,2010-05-02 04:44:00,7587,Has anyone tried the bass pro shops brand flourocarbon line ?
1195732,Hawker,2010-05-02 06:37:00,3967,"With the exception for fishing Lake Trout on Crow Lake north of Nestor Falls I have not found the need for a fluro line up there! Personally, and it's just my own opinion, fluro line is a waste of money for fishing anything but gin clear water and that's only if those waters are heavily fished! If I'm getting bit off a lot due to pike I'll tie on a 9"" leader made of 18 lb 7Strand wire. It's so small it's almost invisible, not that it matters much!"
1195879,StCroixfishingMN7,2010-05-02 13:43:00,35,"I personally think it is a waste of money, i have always used Braid ( Powerpro this year, Stren Superbraid and fire line in the past) i just think its not worth it... just my 2 cents"
