1192018,Guest,2010-04-21 20:01:00,0,Just curious if the regs in Minaki with a 2 walleye limit has made a difference of if you fish there?
1192068,Guest,2010-04-22 04:25:00,0,In time it will. Its a pop. management strategy to bring walleye populations (and size) up.
1192108,Aaron-IN,2010-04-22 07:13:00,500,I can tell you without a doubt that it has and is making a difference.
1192417,camp chef,2010-04-23 08:04:00,915,"This spring will be our 6th year in a row to Minaki the last week of May. I can't speak to the way it used to be but since we've been fishing Minaki it seems to get better every year.We practice catch and release and actively search out areas that have limited harvest. If it gets to the point where the limits are raised,we will probably move along and find another fishery where catch and release is promoted."
1192419,davenathe,2010-04-23 08:13:00,113,"Great way to put it, as long as a guy can have a couple 15-16"" fish for shore lunch the fishery should not be harmed and fishing will very good."
1192432,camp chef,2010-04-23 08:36:00,915,Oh yes we do eat a fish or two during the week.
1192673,steven paulson,2010-04-24 05:42:00,20,The fishing in Minaki is getting better year after year. If you can't catch 50 fish a day your sitting in your cabin.
1192705,Aaron-IN,2010-04-24 08:07:00,500,"I think the lodges in the area are starting to see the light as well. Instead of promoting BS fishing reports and catch and eat all you can every day they have begun to realize that for the most part people want to catch fish and to sustain the fishery year after year instead of being fish hogs and depleting the resources. When the fishing went South it hit the lodge owners in the pocket book, you can only BS people for so long. The people that think you can't deplete a system that big are clueless, I witnessed it happen, thus the need for tighter restrictions that were implimented a few years ago. I for one hope they keep the restrictions in place."
1200732,alanexpup,2010-05-15 18:41:00,278,Hi. do you know if they are doing commercial fishing there like on lake of the woods. but i am not sure if they are still commercial fishing on lake of the woods either. how about it does anyone know the answers here?
1200840,woods,2010-05-16 07:50:00,646,Our group of 9 has been fishing Minaki for 22 years. Last year was the best ever! Awesome.
