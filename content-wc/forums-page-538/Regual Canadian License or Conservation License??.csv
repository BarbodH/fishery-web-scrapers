1200864,polaris-pete,2010-05-16 09:20:00,343,"Just wonder how many on here buy either the Conservation ( I have for the last 10 years or so) License or the Regular Fishing License? My group promotes Catch & Release 99.5% of the time. Keep a few smaller fish to eat while we are at a Lodge. We are not interested anymore about taking any home.We do not beleive in keeping anything over 16' and let the big ones go back to re-populate the Lake.Some of the really large walleyes can be measured and weighed and released, and if you really need to, can have a replica mount made that looks just as real and saves a fish for the next generation of fishermen. Just our thoughts!"
1200905,Outfitter17,2010-05-16 12:05:00,127,"At our camp, we give away 95% conservation lic. and sell 5% regular lic. Obviously you can tell what percentage of guys take fish home, by what lic. they get."
1200940,elway12,2010-05-16 15:09:00,335,We get the regular/sport license for the simple reason we are way out here in Arizona where we don't get to walleye fish very often. We like to take some fillets home for a family fish fry. But we never keep anything of size. I have caught two nice lakers over 14 pounds each and put them back for others to enjoy and to hopefully grow in to monsters!
1200957,WalleyeWally28,2010-05-16 16:35:00,298,"My Wife and I eat Walleye every night we are fishing and sometimes also have Walleye for shore lunch. We never take any home as our ""treat"" is fresh Walleye. We do, however, buy regular licenses so we can stay legal on days when we eat fish twice. We only keep ""eaters"" and put everything over 18"" back. Makes me sick to see people keep 24""+ Walleyes just because it is the biggest one they've ever caught. Makes me sicker to see them filet it after taking pictures (have seen this more than once)."
1201015,Tonyo,2010-05-16 19:36:00,212,Our group used to buy full licenses but for the past several years have gone to the conservation tags for the simple reason we don't need full licenses. If we have already had fish for the day we just practice catch and release and enjoy the day. It's not about how many I can take home it's about how many I catch a day while I'm in Canada. Slots and conservation has improved the fishing on Gullrock Lake over the past 10 years I have gone and I just hope it will get better and better. My thoughts..to each his own.... TonyO
1201132,camp chef,2010-05-17 08:06:00,915,We buy Conservations licenses exclusively. We eat fish once or maybe twice during the week. We fish on the Winnipeg river BECAUSE of the smaller limit. One walleye a day on the conservation license and two on a full license for non-residents.SMALLER HARVESTS MAKE FOR BETTER FISHING.We come to Canada for the fishing not the harvesting.
1201143,Mark R,2010-05-17 08:36:00,1538,Our group gets the full license so we can bring some fish home to share with our wifes and friends. We usually have a fish fry as part of a football tailgate when we get back.
1201170,stumcfar,2010-05-17 09:36:00,451,"Our group of 6 get the conservation license. We eat shore lunch each day and the last day instead of shore lunch, we do take our 12 fish. We have a couple of guys that this trip is their only fishing of the year and they like to take a few fillets home for the family. The trip is more about getting together with the buddies and catching fish not about seeing how many we can keep."
1201171,dkrusin,2010-05-17 09:41:00,97,"We buy full license for one simply reason, possession limit. We have a few guys that like to take some home for a fish fry and usually have some in the freezer back at camp. We usually clean around 10 walleyes per day for shore lunch (6 guys). So do the math, if we had 4 fish in the freezer at camp and 10 at shore lunch and we all had conservation license, we are over our limit. Just saves looking over your shoulder for an extra 20 bucks."
