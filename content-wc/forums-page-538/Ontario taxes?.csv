I know he could use a new fridge there, and I was considering buying him one as a thank you gift. Here in the states I can buy a fridge in the state of Delaware which has no sales tax at all. I'd be saving a 6% PA sales tax. Then Home Depot or Lowes offers a 10% discount to veterans. So I have a total of a 16% saving buying the fridge in the states. I realize bring it into Canada I will have to pay taxes on it, and I'd like to know if someone could give me an idea of what taxes I would have to pay. Thanks!"
