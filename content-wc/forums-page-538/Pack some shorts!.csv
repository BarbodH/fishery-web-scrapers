The unusual weather continues it looks like........better unpack the long johns and throw in some shorts. (also a couple bucks for the toll booth) Hope the walleys aren't to confused by all this.

(I guess that's because I am one).I looked at the forecast on one web site and they are calling for rain for 4 days, starting on saturday, but another web site, isn't. one thing is constant though, the temps are supposed to be above normal till the end of the month. (right now they are about 10 degrees celsius above normal)"
1202356,@Lunker,2010-05-20 13:57:00,835,"Never, EVER unpack the long johns. It's happened too often, as we all know, eh?And I think the fish are already screwed up. A friend and wife, who are excellent sticks, just got back from LOTW and said the fishin' was ~tough~.But I'm sure it'll rebound to the usual excellent bite just in time for my arrival in two weeks."
1202362,2746,2010-05-20 14:12:00,3206,"Maybe we'll see you on the water next week. (black Lund Fisherman) I've been forming a plan in my mind for where to start looking when we get there. Assuming scattered and somewhere on the path from spawning grounds to mid summer holding areas. We'll have fun hunting! I noticed the rain also but on the site I visited they only showed rain on Wed. or Thursday as I recall. From past experience, it will rain when it wants to, regardless of what was forecasted."
1202386,tackleman,2010-05-20 16:20:00,444,I talked to a guy from Poplar Point who told me the fish were in 18-25 feet. He said he did well at the boot (toe end) but there were a lot of guys fishing the heel of the boot.
1202441,Tonyo,2010-05-20 19:36:00,212,"LarryM and Tackleman, Keep me updated on the bite. We are leaving in a week for Gullrock and I'm curious to know what is going on with the unusual spring you are having. We are there the same week every year and this is the first one in several years that has had early ice out and above average temps before we get there. Good luck Larrym and I'm looking forward to a hearing how the fishing goes for you this coming week. Tell Evertt and Helen hi for us and we will see them in a week. TonyO"
1202446,2746,2010-05-20 19:55:00,3206,"I'll tell them. Don't know if I can get to you with info before you leave or not. If not, I'll leave word with Everett where we found them. Good luck and drive safe."
