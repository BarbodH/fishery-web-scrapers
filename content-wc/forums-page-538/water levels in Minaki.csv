1201846,camp chef,2010-05-19 07:02:00,915,I have been studying the data at the lwcb and it appears the water level is several feet less than it was last spring but about the same as it was in 2006-07-08. It is apparent though that they have the Norman dam closed down .I think we are are going to struggle to find much current.However if you do locate some....it could be great.
1201884,Aaron-IN,2010-05-19 08:38:00,500,"Talked to my dad this morning, water levels are more or less what use to be ""normal"" up there, which is much lower than last year."
1201887,camp chef,2010-05-19 08:41:00,915,Aaron ask him if there is any current.
1201896,Aaron-IN,2010-05-19 08:55:00,500,"He said there was a little current. Mind you he puts in at Pistol and heads up to Big Sand so he hasn't been down in or around Minaki. My guess is that there should still be current South of the Bridge, just nothing like it has been the past few years."
1201915,camp chef,2010-05-19 09:30:00,915,sent you a PM
1201941,PRD1,2010-05-19 10:42:00,458,The water control board shows levels in the low normal level for many of the English River system but the inflow and outflow vary quite a bit. Looks like they are managing the levels inspite of the relatively low flow.

1202210,Aaron-IN,2010-05-20 06:28:00,500,Brian......I'm gonna kind of miss walking in mud up to my knees. Did you catch any lakers?
1202371,Guest,2010-05-20 14:30:00,0,"We've been in twice this yea, and first time we had 8 lakers in 45 min and all in 6 - 10 feet of water. Last time it took all morning and it was a day of really lite bites. With this early spring and hot weather i'm betting they will heading deep. But for now lite tackle should still work"
