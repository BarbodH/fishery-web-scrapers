You work all year and look forward to your fishing vacation up north, as long as it doesn't get too out of hand, just go and enjoy yourself, if your budget will allow and you can still pay your monthly bills.As you save for this fishing vacation, put an extra dollar or two in the vacation pot each payday"

1201978,Freytown,2010-05-19 12:13:00,770,http://www.bank-banque-canada.ca/en/...converter.htmlCurrently $1USD = $1.05CAD. Now if it holds for 3 more weeks.
1202005,LeeMB,2010-05-19 13:23:00,83,if your worried it might go the other way why not buy some CDN now
1202059,v-bay gord,2010-05-19 16:38:00,3168,The thing you have to remember is the theoretical bank rate is not what a local bank will give you to either buy US $ or sell US $. They automatically add or deduct 2-5% to make a buck. So if the dollars are at par don't be surprised to find that local businesses will need to have a lower exchange rate to compensate for what they get at the bank.
1202270,Freytown,2010-05-20 09:42:00,770,"You are correct, you never get the rate that currencies trade at on the exchanges..it's always a few % points less.Currently $1USD = $1.07CAD, it seems as the price of crude oil falls, the CAD$ weakens. I hope all this result's in falling gasoline prices too. Gas is such a large part of travel costs and outfitters will benefit from lower electric generating cost too."

1202296,alanexpup,2010-05-20 11:28:00,278,is this to pay for all the socialistic programs? well dont laugh under obamacare we will be in the same boat. Our taxes will be cancelling trips for visitors to our country too.
1202507,Kevin R,2010-05-21 05:13:00,305,The rate is better today & has been going in the US favor the past few weeks.CAD/USD1.0727
1190264,38bill,2010-04-16 12:59:00,331,"What I like is that lately, when the Canada dollar is only slightly lower than the US dollar they keep the difference (dollar for dollar) but when the Canada dollar is only slightly higher they still make us pay the additional difference."
1190609,rnnonmt,2010-04-17 15:23:00,992,Been going to Canada for years and have always been charged in US dollars. Maybe this time they will ask to be paid in Canadian! Kinda funny
1191026,Bob_Loblaw,2010-04-18 20:39:00,109,"As long as the Fed decides to artificially depress interest rates and ring up ever higher deficits, the dollar will weaken. The economy is showing some sporadic signs of growth, so hopefully by summer it will be a bit stronger and we can get at least a bit of a discount on our trips up north"
1191088,Blue Lk,2010-04-19 07:03:00,269,"If it makes you(my American freinds) feel any better,I am travelling from Vermilion Bay to I Falls tomorrow to spend some of my hard earned Canadian $ at Menards."
1191106,Tom/MN,2010-04-19 07:46:00,35,"Not true for the places I have been looking at. 10 years ago, most drive-to resorts were $350-400 per week. Now many are north of $600."
1191192,Freytown,2010-04-19 12:08:00,770,"Currently $1USD = $1.018CAD. That will get us south of the border guys a free case of Molsen, ha ha. Listen, the price of gas will hurt much more than the exchange rate. Everyone enjoy your summer vacation in Canada."
1191197,AllenW,2010-04-19 12:24:00,11482,"While those who have accountants pay for it all will probably only see a minor difference, many not only have to deal with the exchange rate not being what it was a few years ago, they now have to add the cost of their day to day living expense's.Considering the cost of the trip has gone up with normal inflation, add the exchange and what disposable income many families have now with the cost of living rising as it is, it'd be hard to think the tourism industry in Canada should look for stellar years coming up.The fact the politician's can't seen to get us in debt deep enough is going to cause major problems, and I don't see relief anytime soon.I don't think I'd buy a resort right now.And if you can afford a trip to Canada fishing, be thankful.Al"
1191242,2746,2010-04-19 14:54:00,3206,"If your comparing 10 years ago your well befor the change in the value of the $. Rates have gone up in that time, mostly as the result of inflation. The camps we go to on Gullrock and Lac Seul have changed prices very little, if at all, in the past 3 years as the value of the $ has fallen. Because they charge in $ they have taken the loss and chosen not to offset that by rising prices. At least that's been my experience."
1191320,Steve of Madison,2010-04-19 19:01:00,230,My experience as well.....still cheaper than taking my wife to Mexico!
1192325,Thor29,2010-04-22 20:56:00,36,"YEA!!! money on par, Cabelas look out here we come"
1189521,scotttheguide,2010-04-14 09:36:00,73,This morning US Dollar $.9955 to Canadian $1.00..........HHhmmm.
1189565,Wall-i-Lama,2010-04-14 12:05:00,1524,"Scott, My vote is to freeze it at par! Does this effect the resorts differently, depending on how they charge in USD or CAD?"
1189566,Kruger,2010-04-14 12:10:00,259,If we get to vote I want it back to $1.50 like it was 7 or 8 years ago.
1189589,81Saluki,2010-04-14 13:25:00,97,"Just goes to show what impact our (USA) growing deficit can have on those of us who vacation outside our borders. Bummer! :-( Instead of the usual 3-4 trips, we'll probably only visit twice."
1189595,scotttheguide,2010-04-14 13:58:00,73,"I know the resort I work with will stay at par if it does not recover, unless of course it gets to low, and I imagine allot of others will also.But the good news is the fish don't care. It may cost a few percentage points more to go on a fishing trip to Canada, but its more than worth it."
1189617,Fishing Traveler,2010-04-14 15:19:00,19,This isn't good for anyone. Another reason for many to not go...I know that we here in the US who have gone north for years have been spoiled. I used to be able to use as an argument to the wife that my vacation was sooo much cheaper than hers. Not so much any more. I'm still going but with a family my pockets aren't endless...the once annual trips are now being reconsidered. Chris
1189644,2746,2010-04-14 17:04:00,3206,"Probably not going to change soon with our deficit but on the positive side, it's been like this for the last 2-3 years and the lodge owners nearly all charge in $ and, in general, have taken the loss as most have not raised prices very much.....certainly not enough to compensate for the lower dollar. Of course other things we buy while there are more expensive but we don't spend a great deal outside the lodge fees. I'll spend $1000 or less for a week of fishing (providing my own boat) which is a pretty good deal."
1189736,Bill Krejca,2010-04-14 20:34:00,6107,"So... this means that there is now less than 1/2 cent difference between the two dollars. Those of us who live in the US would rather have the US dollar worth more than the Canadian, but 1/2 cent less on the dollar probably won't stop many folks from heading north. It will probably change , up and down, a number of times before the major traffic begins. Bill Krejca"
1189750,Nimstug,2010-04-14 21:24:00,2605,"The last time I was 'up north' three years ago, the dollars were equal. Won't make much difference to me.NimstugRepeal Ohm's Law!"
1189777,teddi,2010-04-15 05:46:00,349,"it,s going to cost more than a few points, don,t forget the HST on july 1. the canadian dollar is forcast to stay high for the next little while. with the HST the price of gas is also going up 8%. going to make things a little tougher this year maybe"
