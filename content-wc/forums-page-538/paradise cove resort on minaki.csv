1201586,Aaron-IN,2010-05-18 13:15:00,500,It was a joke and it's not been 12 years ago.
1201632,Guest,2010-05-18 15:30:00,0,Hey we did not bring anything Coffee or food since he had a restraunt and was not advised any different When we booked Ranger The place is a crap hole
1201797,ranger22,2010-05-19 03:41:00,124,crap hole or not. Why go up north to eat pizza and fries and moan because you can't have coffie. I guess everybody is different
1201826,Aaron-IN,2010-05-19 06:33:00,500,I bet the crappy fishing was just an added bonus
1201865,camp chef,2010-05-19 07:44:00,915,Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
1201991,Reels,2010-05-19 12:39:00,2876,"You guys are cracking me up! I think what the angry coffee guy was reffering to was he was sold on a trip when Paradise Cove was up and running at 100% and came geared up that way. When the economy went to crap, Paradise Cove went to bare bones staff with only the bar open for a few hours in the evening. That being said, he could have knocked on any cabin with a smile, and I bet they would have given him a cup of joe."
1202132,steven paulson,2010-05-19 20:09:00,20,Been to Paradice for many many years good place to stay. You fish all day in the wilderness what more would you want.
1202175,alanexpup,2010-05-19 23:16:00,278,WOW. you guys really dug up an old post. i looked at this and for a while was thinking someone had used my login. 6 years old. where did you find this? i do not even remember this one.
544350,Guest,2004-12-01 10:12:00,0,"Our group has been going to Birch Island Resort that is on Gunn Lake at Minaki for the past 6 years. It is an outstanding lodge. It is American Plan only, and costs more than the other local lodges.www.birchislandresort.com Don"
1201433,Guest,2010-05-17 23:22:00,0,i reallyy like paradise cove cause the owner duane is a very nice man there is some trees but who cares the fishing is to die for there the people are great all pretty friendly..u should stay there ur there for the fishing and to relax not to star at trees the whole time
1201475,Guest,2010-05-18 07:10:00,0,"Wow, someone went deep in the archives!"
1201480,Guest,2010-05-18 07:19:00,0,Great place to fish CRAPPY Place to stay!!! BRING YOUR OWN FOOD AND COFFEE There is no where to eat and you can't even buy a coffee anywhere in the morning Boy was i P*SSED Went to 4 places looking for coffee in the morning and they all looked at me as if i said I just seen Elvis In A UFO. Until We found a liitle fuel stop right on the river where we got some and she did not even charge us And we did not buy fuel of her But if I go back she gets all are fuel sales PC gets Nothing Oh Ya We managed to get some greasy pizza at pc in the bar All There concerned about is your money Not Your comfort How Hard is it to have a least coffee for guys in the morning **** I'll Pay 2.50 a cup If he wants Man Its hard to believe something as simple as that stands out on my trip!!
1201503,Aaron-IN,2010-05-18 08:27:00,500,I hear the Minaki Lodge is nice
1201536,ranger22,2010-05-18 10:34:00,124,"Wow thats funny. Your pretty upset about a cup of coffie. Did you have a stove in your cabin, you could have easily brewed up a pot. Don't think it's worth having a heart attack over."
1201540,camp chef,2010-05-18 10:56:00,915,I am guessing that the lack of coffee was just part of the issue. Just guessing.
1201548,ranger22,2010-05-18 11:21:00,124,"yea I know. It's just funny someone would go up there. Then complain they can't get, Good take out, and starbucks. No reason they should have one up there. Population of 50 makes sense. Why not go up there, with friends and family. Have a fish fry. bbq some steaks. Enjoy the fishing and outdoor experince."
1201565,camp chef,2010-05-18 11:54:00,915,Yea he probably wouldn't fair too well if he got weathered in overnight away from camp.
1201577,teddi,2010-05-18 12:41:00,349,minaki lodge burnt dowd 12 years ago. not so nice any more.
544282,Guest,2004-11-26 15:36:00,0,"Hi. been to a number of places in canada for the last 30 years- lac saul and lake of the woods. thinking about minaki and the pardise cove resort. Any one been here? how is it , access if I bring my own boat and rocks? fishing any good? the resort owners and operators are they the same? Thanks alan"
544283,iamwalleye1,2004-11-26 17:32:00,1589,If you want a little more of a resort for your money give Peter a call. The resort in called Barbers. Great place and very nice people. I know he books up early.http://216.19.71.95/Barbers_Frame_Whole.htm
544284,rebelrn2001,2004-11-26 20:31:00,1563,"The web site listed above gives no directions on WHERE they are located, no map, etc. Where is that?"
544287,woods,2004-11-27 08:55:00,646,"I stay at a resort next to Paradise Cove, but the guys I've talked to who have stayed there seem to like it OK. If you stay at one of the new cabins on the point, I think you might want to take your boat out of the water every night. I think they are exposed to the wind a little too much over there. Some leave them out all night though. There is blacktop all the way to Minaki, and good ramp at Paradise. There are a few unmarked rocks, but not too many. You have to keep your eyes open like any lake in Canada. In 20 years of going up there, I have hit a rock only once, and I knew at the time they were down there. Didn't do any serious damage. Fishing in general has been pretty good there, especially 2002 & 2003. Weather on our trip last year was not good. I think if you would talk to someone who's been up there before, they could show you on the map where there are some of the more bad spots for rocks."
544291,Guest,2004-11-27 16:18:00,0,Minaki would be a great choice..Miles and miles of area to fish with the wind never keeping you from fishing somewhere.Fairly new cabins which are comfortable..Its one the most beautiful spots Ive ever been to..Everything a fisherman could hope for there.. good luck.This is coming from a Canadian who has been to many fishing spots over the years.
544296,iamwalleye1,2004-11-28 07:49:00,1589,Just as you come into town on 596 turn right WHERE:) the sign states Barbers and follow the road for about 2 blocks and the road ends at Barbers. Barber is located on Gun lake just south of Muncer's reef.
544306,Guest,2004-11-28 17:24:00,0,"I went to Minaki last year and stayed at Barber's. It was a nice cabin, but the resort as a whole is pretty laim. It is very spread out, so you do know you have neighbors, but the bushes and trees are overgrown. We were right on the lake, but could not see the lake. Any wind, and their docks get pounded by waves. I viewed some posts last year on this site, and almost went to Paradise Cove. Now that I have seen Paradise Cove it is a place I will never go to. They have WAY to many cabins packed right on top of each other. I ahve neve seen anything like it. There are no trees, and no feeling of being in the wilderness. Its way to overcongested. It is an ugly ugly place!!!! If I were to go back to Minaki, I would either stay at Big North Lodge, or at Bayview Lodge (a boat in resort). I scouted both of these, and they both have very nice cabins, yet still have a wilderness feeling. The fishing was pretty good, but our numbers at Lac Seul blew Minaki away."
544309,rtmg,2004-11-28 19:13:00,34,"Thats not entirely true about PC. I would agree that PC#2 isn't exactly ""wilderness"" (unless the bar patrons are classified as wild !) The new Holst Point is a nice area. PC#1 is also a nice area. PC also offers the rental of a couple of houses, right on the water. These are located between PC#2 & Jack's Bait House. As for Bayview being ""wilderness"", is a train screaming in behind the property contribute to the experience ? I think not..... In my honest opinion, any of the camps in the area are good..... it all depends on what you need/want. Each & every one of them have merits & also have their weak points. If you want true wilderness, consider taking a tent & camping somewhere up on the water system !www.sunsetpointminaki.comwww.paradisecoveminaki.comwww.minaki-bayviewlodge.comwww.bignorthlodge.comwww.birchislandresort.comwww.northstarvillage.netwww.roughrocklodge.comwww.barbersresort.com Good Fishen Rob"
544313,Guest,2004-11-29 07:42:00,0,"Paradise Cove is a travesty. They have too many cabins in such a small spot. It is an eyesore just to boat by. I would never stay there. Whats wrong with a few trees or grass. Paradise Cove stacks cabins right on top of each other, and Paradise Cove II double stacks the cabins. I have stayed at Barbers, and the owner Peter is about the nicest resort owner I have met. He needs to do a little work on the outside, but the inside of the cabin I stayed at last year was top notch. Very clean, two refrigerators, plus a deep freezer. Nice deck facing the water. Things were overgrown, but I would go back. Boats did get knocked around on his docks though. As far as Bayview, I have boated past it and it is nice looking. I cannot say what the cabins look like inside, but the resort is well manicured outside. I do like to feel like I am in a little bit of wilderness when I go to Canada. I forgot that Union Station is right behind Bayview and 100 trains a day go by. Oh wait, maybe a couple of trains a day go by. And since I am on the water all day, I cannot see how that would be a problem."
544314,Reels,2004-11-29 08:29:00,2876,"Gosh I am getting old. Like IAMWALLEYE1, I have been going to Minaki close to 20 years now. Bayview is overpriced and the owners can be jerks. The cabins are not nice at all on the inside. The outside is well manicured. I can not say the train was ever an issue, but boating to the resort that is just on the other side of the river is a pain in the ####. You can get a lot more for your money in Minaki. Rob listed a good list to check out. Regarding Barbers, last year, was a wierd year, and the wind seemed to blow into Peters place a lot. I have stayed at Barbers Im guessing 10 years maybe now? I kinda like the rustic look. I want it to look like the wilderness, and I don't want to see neighbors. The cabins on the inside are very nice and comfortable. You get a private dock, and a large freezer for eery cabin. I have stayed at Bayview, Barbers,Rock River Resort, and have got out of the boat and looked at all the resorts in Minaki at some time or another. Big North is probably the fanciest and nicest. I would stay there if it wasn't so darn far from Big Sand! Paradise Cove? Well, it is bizzare to say the least. I am guessing it will be like the Wisconsin Dells someday. <{{}}><"
