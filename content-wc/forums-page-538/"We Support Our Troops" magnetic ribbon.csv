I would like to place one next to my ""We support our Troops"" for our US servicemen. I will be crossing into Ft Frances this Sunday and going through Dryden and Vermilion Bay on our way to Ear Falls. I met a Canadian Air Force sergeant in Tenn (Jack Daniels Distillery) last Dec and he said that the only place that he knew where one could get them was on Canadian military bases."
