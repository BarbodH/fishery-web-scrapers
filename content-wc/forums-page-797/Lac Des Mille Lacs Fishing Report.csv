542125,Guest,2004-07-27 19:12:00,0,Heading up to LDML in a couple of weeks. A friend just came back with a motor messed up from a rock. He's been going there for 20 years and just now found it. I have heard of a map available with FPS coordinates on it. Can anyone help me?
542137,Guest,2004-07-28 08:33:00,0,I'll be at pine point also. Just hoping the weather holds and the fishing stays good. Ken
542147,Guest,2004-07-28 13:38:00,0,"Sorry to about your buddys motor doyle. I've been going up there for 20yrs also,but I had a good teacher my dads been going up for 35yrs. Depending on the water level, sometimes you see rocks that ya never knew where there. I've dinged a prop or 2 trolling in new water up there. Its always an adventure."
