542132,Andyeye,2004-07-28 07:02:00,179,We are heading up the 13th of August For fishing and bear hunting. I want to stop and pick up a flat of nightcrawlers and a few groceries before we arrive at camp. We have heard of problems with dirt in the worm bedding and do not want to worry about losing our bait at the border. I do not want to go into Thunder Bay to pick up the things I need.I'm hoping someone could let me know where I can get bait and groceries on Highway 11 west of Thunder Bay. We are only going as far west as English River on Highway 11. Thanks for your help.
