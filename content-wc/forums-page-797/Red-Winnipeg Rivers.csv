542194,timeout,2004-07-29 10:03:00,28,"Wicked high and fast current on the wpg. Try lwcb.ca for wpg levels. Got back from Eaglenest last night and the current is wicked, could feel the boat moving sideways through lamprey and a few other necked down areas. Just hate that feeling. Red river levels are still high. Have not been out since last week but read on another board that the water is dirty froma big rain in the N. Dak area and rising as a result of said rain. Going to go for kitties on the Red one day soon, will post water levels if you are still interested after that"
