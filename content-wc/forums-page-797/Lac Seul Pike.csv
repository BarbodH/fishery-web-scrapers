You may get into some decent action, but most likely will end up with a few little ones and maybe one or two decent fish. The standard presentation is throwing spoons through the cabbage weedbeds. The bigger the weedbed and the closer it is to deep water the better. These spots are sometimes difficult to locate, but once you do they're sure to hold some active fish. Now, in all honesty, your best bet at a giant pike in August is walleye fishing, no question!! The big pike are down there. Time and time again, the biggest pike any time of year other than spring are boated walleye fishing (40""+). You might as well have a great chance at a trophy walleye while pike fishing, or a trophy pike while walleye fishing as is often the case. To conclude, cast some hardware over weedbeds or rock structures near deep water for pike to change things up, especially if walleye fishing is slow, but you best bet for giant pike will be walleye fishing."
