Fishing will be good for the next couple of years. We stay at cabonga lodge. Pike were small as usuall this time of year. 31 incher was biggest. But you can catch all you want in the sub 25 inch category. roads were better this year than last. Overall a very good trip. Will be going back next year. In the freezer of our lodge there was a 16 pounder that we heard was netted by the Indians and a 11 pounder that was caught a week before we got there from a jig. Good luck on your trip and let us know how you did. gb"
