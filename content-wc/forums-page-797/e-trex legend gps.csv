542042,Guest,2004-07-26 10:05:00,0,"I have a Vista since spring '03 and I'm happy with it, for the most part. If your husband is an avid GPS user, then the Vista would be the best bet since it has all the features of all the other eTrex units. It also has more built-in memory than the Legend allowing you to put in additional/better maps using MapSource Software. The built-in altimeter on the Vista is surprisingly accurate as well and not available on the Legend. If your husband just needs a navigational aid, then the Legend will suffice. Only downside for all eTrex units: The glue holding the rubber along the outside of these units can become loose with pro-longed exposure in high humidity and when some types of bug-sprays come into contact with it. I took mine to Mexico back in Feb. for a week and the rubber is now loose on the outside of the unit and probably no longer water-proof. Even with this defect, I'll still choose an eTrex over a Magellan anyday. Hope this helps you out."
