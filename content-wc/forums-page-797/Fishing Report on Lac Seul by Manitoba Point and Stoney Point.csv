Like how are the fish biting, the weather and water level. Any updated info will help thanks in advance."

Fished a little southeast of Manitoba point (Black Bay-Aldous Bay)and 6 of us caught all the fish we wanted too. Got a couple of big ones 30"" and two 29"", lots of fish over slot. Jig/minnow, jig/leech produced well in 6 to 12' water."
