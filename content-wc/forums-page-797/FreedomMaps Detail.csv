542115,Big Fish,2004-07-27 14:35:00,138,Wondering if the FreedomMaps for Canada have enough detail to be usefull for fishing and how accurate are they. Thinking of the Lac Seul area in particular. cw
542117,Mike M (Sask),2004-07-27 14:42:00,374,I can't answer for your area but I had the chance to test drive the Freedom Map for Saskatchewan and I would have to say it's the best map I've seen for this area.
542152,Guest,2004-07-28 15:55:00,0,"I think you will be pleasantly suprised with the detail. I used it on Umfreville lake and found it amazingly accurate. A buddy is heading to Lac Suel next week and he just took my chip home to try in his unit before he purchases the chip. I advised Lowrance to put some place on their web site to show the detail of these maps since I think it is better than most expect. There is of course no depth information on any of these maps but I don't consider that of much importance, that's why we have depth finders. Not to say it wouldn't be nice but not necessary. Paul"
542166,Big Fish,2004-07-28 21:38:00,138,"Thanks for the replies, I ordered one today. Depth would be nice, but having reasonably accurate map is better than nothing. cw"
542168,rebelrn2001,2004-07-28 21:50:00,1563,I have that map and used it this spring on Wabigoon/Dinorwick. It was MUCH better than I anticipated. I wish too the depth was there but I found no spot that it showed me anywhere other than where I was (I think that makes sense).
542173,Guest,2004-07-29 05:35:00,0,What do these map have if they don't have the depths? Just the islands? What about underwater hazards? What is the cost? Where can you order them from?
