541991,Zim1,2004-07-25 11:31:00,17,I am heading up to Gullrock for my first visit there this weekend. Is there somewhere I can get a lake topo map of any kind? Thx.

Gullrock is not that large but it is nice to have something to refer to if you get direction turned. Well, 3 more sleepless night until I can smell that fresh Canadian air and ""fish on""!!!! :-) Renn"
