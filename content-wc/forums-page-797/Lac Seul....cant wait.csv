542052,Guest,2004-07-26 13:21:00,0,"MikeKansas, all I thought was it was weird that you would only go to Canada for walleye and such, not fish locally, or own a boat. That is how I think you seperate the good from the best, is on a lake where its extremely hard to catch fish. Unlike Canada. And this is all with your Redfish trips aside."
542054,Guest,2004-07-26 13:48:00,0,"JamesPWTPRO, I understand your thoughts. I started fishing Canada in 1955 and for the next 49 years I have fished in many places. Minnesota, Wisconsin, Tennesse, Texas ,Florida, Missouri, Illinois, North and South Dakota, Oklahoma, Michigan, Ohio, Washington, California, Oregon, Utah and some places Im sure I have forgot. I love to catch fish but I love it even better when Im fishing with my fishing Buddies. I dont fish locally because I really dont have anybody around here to fish with and my trips take up my allotted fishing times. I dont own a boat because I dont see the value in haulimg a boat all over the country when I can rent or have one provided. Catch and release"
542055,Guest,2004-07-26 13:51:00,0,"I understand, have you ever heard of Big Stone Lake, in MN"
541517,Guest,2004-07-07 18:50:00,0,"Ivy, Dont worry Ivy. You not being able to go to Canada this year will only give the fish a chance to recover from your wrath with the Rod. They will be bigger next year."
541747,Guest,2004-07-16 19:19:00,0,DEAR MR. KANSAS I'M STAYING WITH TIMBERLANE LODGE DO YOU KNOW THE AREA TAKING MY BROTHER WHO JUST RETIRED FROM THE ARMY ANY ADVICE I HAVE'NT BEEN THERE IN LAC SEUL FOR MANY YEARS GOING THE FIRST WEEK IN AUG. THANK YOU
541752,Guest,2004-07-16 22:05:00,0,"Fish the humps and secondary reefs, you find the reefs usually off points from the islands 50 to a hundred yards out, our best luck has been spinners with minnows, in 5-15 feet, sometimes even 3 feet only. We go the first week in august almost every year, at goose bay camp."
541753,Guest,2004-07-16 22:09:00,0,Anyone going to stay at Goosebay the first couple weeks in August
541797,Mike Kansas,2004-07-19 08:05:00,1463,"marcovida, You should be hitting the Lake at a good time. The fish were scattered earlier in the year but hopefully the warmer water will put the Walleyes back in a normal pattern. I would start by fishing main Lake structure. Take a good look at a map and fish the windy sides of the structure. Your Resort Owner should be able to help you and dont forget to check with the other people in camp. There are also Guides in the area that you might want to fish with a couple of days with in order to find out what is working for them. Good Luck and drive careful. The Moose have been a problem on the roads. Mike Kansas"
542015,Guest,2004-07-25 13:59:00,0,"Hi! My husband thinks he's the greatest thing to ever fish lac seul too LOL He says he's going to take me some day, not sure when... He's going in August but I can't go this time (darn work). We go fishing all the time here in WI - is it really that differnt in Canada? I hope its differnt, because he spends way to much money on boats, moters, poles, jiggs, baits, minnows, camping stoves, tents, lanturns, rain jackets, hooks, reels, line, depth finders, raplas, buritos, beer and think maybe some big 'n busty magazines"
542018,Guest,2004-07-25 20:28:00,0,"Elizabeth, Fishing is to men like Diamonds are to women....you can never spend to much money on what you must have."
542019,Guest,2004-07-25 21:33:00,0,"What date is your husband going to be there and where is he staying, and yes, there is nothing like a fishing trip to Canada, absolutely nothing."
542020,Guest,2004-07-25 22:03:00,0,"MikeKansas, 5-6 trips to Canada a year, anyone who did that would be an extremely succesful fisherman. Not much to brag about when that is the only place you fish."
542023,Guest,2004-07-26 06:56:00,0,"JamesPWTPRO, My wife and I also spend some time fishing Red Fish in Louisiana in November. While I love the Canada experience the Red Fish are awesome. We caught several last year over 40 lbs and many in the 20 /30 lb range."
541431,Guest,2004-07-05 22:39:00,0,Thank you......hope it works for us. Leaving for Lac Seul in the morning.
541455,Guest,2004-07-06 10:52:00,0,"I am also a rookie at walleye fishing, could you please explain to me what kind of rapalas you were using and what you meant by dragging them, were you trolling them? and any other Walleye Fishing tips or what to use would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"
541457,Guest,2004-07-06 11:00:00,0,I guess I should have said in my last reply that I will be fishing Lac Seul from July 31st -August 6th around the Manitoba & Stoney Points area adn any help I can get will be greatly appreciated. Thanks again
541459,Big Fish,2004-07-06 11:18:00,138,Where did you stay at Lac Suel? I saw a pretty impressive picture of a 31+ walleye last week.. cw
541460,Guest,2004-07-06 11:59:00,0,Hi Bigfish. That was me at Evergreen. Glad to see that you made it home safely. Good fishing the rest of the summer to you. Janet (Mike Kansas)
541461,Guest,2004-07-06 12:16:00,0,"Miss Janet caught her big fish on a Rapala Shad Rap in Perch. Bass Pro 2004 Anglers Catalog...page 140...Picture D, color 05. We have used these for years on Lac Seul and have always caught lots of nice fish. Trool them on flats next to deep water or in bays. Best results seem to be in 8 to 15 feet of water. I like to let enough line out that I will hit the bottom once in a while and trool into the wind. Trool fast enough that you feel a good lure wobble in your rod. Also have had good luck with colors 06,11,23, and 26. CATCH AND RELEASE Send me your email. I will send you picture of Miss Janets fish.[email protected]"
541464,Guest,2004-07-06 13:10:00,0,"Thank you very much for the information Mike & Miss Janet, my email address is [email protected] Tina"
541485,IA  DAN,2004-07-06 18:09:00,53,"I'm glad you had a great trip on Lac Seul.We'll be up there to Black Bay last week in July.My 30 yr old son is going with us this year ,I can't wait to see his reaction to the big lake and great fishing.It's hard to explain to someone thats never been there before.Mike has Dan put on the screened in porch yet,he was talking about doing it this year.I'm glad to see the water level is up from last year even though it didn't slow the bite down.Mike don't forget to root for those HAWKEYES this football season. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH.:-)"
541491,Guest,2004-07-06 21:03:00,0,"Ia Dan, No screened porch when we were there 1st week of June. Plenty of great Walleye fishing though. We had two rookies with us this year and they both found it awesome. Hope you guys have a great trip and catch plenty of fish. Be safe. CATCH AND RELEASE Mike"
541515,Ivy,2004-07-07 17:59:00,556,It breaks my heart looking at this post. I'm moving in a month and won't get up North this year. The best I can do is to have a Labatt's and look at some pictures. Ivy
541096,Guest,2004-06-23 07:48:00,0,"My Husband is taking me to Lac Seul next week. I have never fished on Lac Seul before but I have seen the pictures that my Husband has from fishing Lac Seul the last ten years. He tells me that he is the Greatest Fisherman that ever wet a line and his fishing buddys tell me the same thing. I hope that I can catch a 30"" plus Walleye to go with the nine mounted monsters he has on the walls in his Walleye room. Cant wait to fish with ""The Master"" ( he cooks too)"
541105,Guest,2004-06-23 13:46:00,0,"Miss Janet, I have fished with your Husband and he is without a doubt the best Walleye Fisherman to ever draw a breath. I was fortunate enough to attend the Seminar he held in St. Paul last year ""Walleye Structure and Tactics"". After the Seminar he was approached by a group of investors who wanted to sponser him on the Pro Walleye Tour. He declined with the following statement "" I only want to help those fisherman who have less talent than I do and that is a bunch. It would be unfair for me to disrupt the Pro Tour most of them are my customers at my Seminars"". Wow what a guy, Miss Janet you are truly blessed to have him. Besides being a good cook he is also humble."
541116,Guest,2004-06-24 08:44:00,0,"Miss Janet I have also enjoyed the privilege of fishing with your Husband. He is awesome. You will catch many fish with him on Lac Seul. He knows Lac Seul like the back of his hand. Listen to his instructions, he has taught many of us how to catch Walleye."
541126,Guest,2004-06-24 11:39:00,0,maybe someone can teach him about catch and release (9 mounted monsters)????
541127,Guest,2004-06-24 12:25:00,0,"Practicing CPR is an opinion favored by some, not all - it is not a law. There are limits on catching fish for a reason - so our childrens children can catch them. So, I leave you with this. If this so called fish-god caught nine trophy walleye over the years, more power to him to mount them - I'd rather eat them."
541129,Guest,2004-06-24 12:36:00,0,They are replicas.
541130,Guest,2004-06-24 12:41:00,0,"Well thats perfect, now everyone is happy!"
541392,Guest,2004-07-04 22:07:00,0,"Just got back from a week on Lac Seul with the MASTER. I got a 31 1/2 "" Walleye. My husband is the best Walleye Guide in the world.....he cooks too"
541394,Guest,2004-07-04 23:47:00,0,"Congrats on the trophy !! Headed up this week. On your trip up there, any patterns or depths you could share. Have heard it is a lot slower than last year. Thank you."
541415,Guest,2004-07-05 16:44:00,0,Fish were very scattered. We had our best luck fishing windy points with varied depths from 18 to 6 feet. Minnow/jig combos yielded most fish while bigger fish caught dragging rapalas.
