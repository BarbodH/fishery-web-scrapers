542067,Trailerguy,2004-07-26 17:55:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]Unless you are Canadian and have a commercial permit you can't take them across the border. I beleive it's next year no one can take leechs into Canada.
542106,catchNrelease,2004-07-27 11:12:00,157,The U.S. Border agents love when you try to take leeches into Canada. The Canadians turn you around and you walk them back over the bridge where an American border agent is standing there asking what kind of bait it is and explains how he plans on using them the upcoming weekend.
