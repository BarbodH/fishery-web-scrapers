In and around the French River;2. Around Iron Island;3. Also in the West Arm and Cache Bay;4. And also occasionally in some nearby and smaller lakes.Suggestions? Make, model, aluminum or glass, motor, trailer???"

As for aluminum vs glass, I opted for aluminum because of the abundance of rock in these lakes and imperfect launches. I have a 17'6"" Lund ProV with a 150 and this is about as big as I need it to be in most cases. Also, a roller trailer is handier for those poor launches."
