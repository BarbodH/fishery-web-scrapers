510116,manitobawalleye,2000-10-23 18:45:00,885,are you talking about manigotogan river or lake?
510117,Guest,2000-10-23 21:00:00,0,I believe he is refering to where the river emptys into Lake Winnipeg. Is it good fishing in Lake Winnipeg in the fall like it is down at Pine Falls?
510118,Guest,2000-10-26 19:39:00,0,Off shore of the town of Manigotagan is one of the places to fish for walleye during the height of summer on Lake Winnipeg. It provided pretty consistent fishing for July and August. Its about 45 minutes north of Pine Falls.You can troll or still fish but the key is fishing in relatively shallow waters. Roaming schools chase all along the shores of the lake all summer long.There's a great beach there and small campground with a few cabins called Mantago Bay Campground (204-367-3868)Dan
