509953,Guest,2000-10-06 20:50:00,0,"I live in Lincoln Ne. and I am leaving for Selkirk in the morning This will be my third year at the Daerwood. We've had our best luck using frozen salted minnows. Reports are the big ones are in the river and the weather looks good. There is an excellant bait shop right on main street, just a few blocks from the motel. Good luck, Bucko"
