510127,Tom,2000-10-26 06:23:00,1063,Planning a fly-in trip next summer and need info on Rusty Meyersand Showalters. Anyones experiences would be greatly appreciated.
510128,Guest,2000-10-26 20:08:00,0,Fished Showalter's Action Lake in early June of 2000. First class outfitter and great fishing despite the lousy weather. Twelve of us are going up the end of June 2001 to fish the Cochrane River.
510129,Guest,2000-10-27 07:34:00,0,"Know both services well. Rusty is based in Fort Frances and Show..is in Ear Falls. Either place you pick will be a great experience. Their prices will be comparable and their lakes will be flights from 10 minutes to 1 hr from base. I own a lodge 42 miles NE of Ear Falls, we boat-in 3 miles and are the only lodge on 14,000 acre Confederation Lake so we are like a fly-in for remoteness and solitude. The fishing on our lake is for trophy Pike and Lake Trout. We catch-and-release all big fish and sponsor a contest each year for our guests so we keep track of our quality fishery yearly and have seen a significant increase in the average size fish on our lake and the numbers of fish keep climbing too! Good luck, if I can answer any other questions feel free to email me or view my web site at southbaylodge.com Roger."
