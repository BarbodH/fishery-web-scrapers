510111,Guest,2000-10-23 07:12:00,0,I was wondering if anyone could give me some helpful info about Ice fishing Bay of Quinte. First what is the best way to travel there from Wisconsin? What airport do u use around the Bay of Quinte? Next what is a good lodge or resort to stay at? and finally what type of fishing tactics are best?thanks for your time :)

510113,manitobawalleye,2000-10-23 19:02:00,885,quintefishing.com is the place...but you can also search prince edward county or picton...i believe you could fly into kingston which is right on the bay...i stayed at inn on the bay but i believe alot of pa boys stayed at a place called the sportsman inn or motel which caters more to fisherman....i will be back the 3rd week of feb ...any questions email me at [email protected]1/2 and 3/4 oz silver or gold sweedish pimples are the ticket most days......
