510086,Dave,2000-10-21 01:52:00,258,"Thanks for the response!Yah I heard rock lake was pretty good, but I have no idea how to get there from Brandon. I know that its between here and dauphin, but not sure where. Where about is it?"
510087,william smith,2000-10-23 12:50:00,10,Pelican or Rock Lake is south of you by Ninette. I have never fished it but I had taught skiing on this lake. It is a large lake and can get big waves.William
510088,Ron,2000-10-23 19:10:00,387,"Both Rock and Pelican are south of Brandon. I've fished open water and ice seasons on both lakes. I've never caught a walleye on Pelican, but have had phenominal luck there both seasons with big perch, up to 14 1/4 inches. Rock has produced some nice stringers of pickerel, though, but can be hot or cold quickly. Both lakes are shallow, approx.12-14 ft. max., and get quite warm thru the summer months, developing a layer of algae in certain areas. Wind can wreak havoc on both lakes, but as Pelican runs north-south, Rock can usually be comfortably fished in a north wind as it runs east-west. A westerly wind favors fishing at Pelican. The lakes are linked by the Pembina River, which has a large variety of species in it. Pickerel, perch, carp,drum, goldeye, pike, suckers, channel cat and bullheads are some of the species we've caught there, recording Master Angler size fish of perch, bullheads, and goldeye. I've seen M/A size pike and pickerel caught in this watershed also. We usually use the following board to keep in touch...Best of luck !!!#####://www.insidetheweb.com/mbs.cgi/mb1026367"
510089,Dave,2000-10-23 20:59:00,258,"Excellent, thanks for the help. I guess there is another rock lake that half way between Dauphin and the Pas too. Ill be sure and pop into that site sometime soon. Thanks again."
