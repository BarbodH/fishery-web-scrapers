I personally have catch a 14 pounder and at least 8 over 10 pounds (my first year of walleye fishing). It depends one the time of year you fish the lake. In summer there is an super crank bit, in the fall it is leeaches and live bait rigs over the major points. Slow presentation!!! In the spring it is either the north end which is real rocky or the south end!! Take CareWilliam"
