Weather was a warm 19+C or 68+F for the unconverted folks. On Wed I was there in the flat calm with rain and very thick fog and boated 8 in 2 hours, 3 of which were over 21 inches. All were caught while anchored in 13-15 feet of water using pink/white jigs and salted frozen minnows. Will be there again on Sat 28 Oct 00. Weather has changed so we'll dress warm and fire up the heater in the boat."" Golf is for people who don't know how to fish!"""

510144,Guest,2000-10-29 18:47:00,0,"Fished the Red River on Saturday.The River level as dropped a couple of feet. Be careful at the Selkirk Park boat launch as the ""2nd launch from the North"" has a large ""hole"" which when you back up has the potential to drop your trailer on to your frame. Watched a couple of people use this ramp with the same result, had to listen to the awful sound of metal scrapping on the boat ramp as people tried to pull the trailer out of the hole.Fishing started off great at about 8:00 am but it quickly died off by 10:00 am. Caught a 6.4 and 5.3 greenback and 6 more eaters. All in 13-14ft. Appeared to be the same results for all the boats surrounding me. I moved upstream closer to Lower Fort Garry but only caught a couple sauger in about 8ft.3/8 oz. Pink Jigs and Frozen Minnows.I was out there last Saturday and the fishing was significantly better. Hope it picks up this week as I'm not ready to put the boat to rest for the winter!"
