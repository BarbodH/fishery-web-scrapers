510031,Guest,2000-10-16 07:31:00,0,For the Pine Falls International Walleye Classic see the following page.www.virtualnorth.com/walleye/From there you can select the Winnipeg River Bulletin board which has this years results.
510032,Hawgeye,2000-10-16 07:37:00,1355,I am not sure but I wonder if he meant this last tournament held this last weekend. The tourney on the 14th and 15th was the big dollar one. $1000 entry. I am curious how that went as well.
510033,Chad,2000-10-16 14:35:00,3523,I looked on Virtual north and nothing new. Just the results from the other tourney held 2 weeks ago. Nothing on the most recent one.
510034,Guest,2000-10-16 22:54:00,0,I don't know where you can find all of the results but Alex Kessler won the last tourny with approx. 51 lbs. with Ted Stewner hot on his tail. As for me......well let's just say that the fish god's weren't shining on me this past weekend...oh well...that's fishing.Lawrence
