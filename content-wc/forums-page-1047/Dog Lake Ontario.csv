510093,Guest,2000-10-21 10:10:00,0,Any of you guys or gals fish this lake. Evidently it northeast of Wawa. I have a chance to go up next spring but with vacations time at a premium don't want to waste it on poor fishing. Thanks
510094,Frank from TBay,2000-10-21 13:59:00,312,There is a DOG Lake close to Thunder Bay that has some very good Walleye fishing. Check which lake and we will see if we can help you out. Good fishing: Frank

510096,Bucks Rogers,2000-10-23 06:31:00,43,"I fish Dog Lake several times a summer. Best fishing time is in June. Use mainly jigs & minnows at that time. There is a slot size that must be returned (14"" to 17""). I catch lots of fish but many are under slot. Maybe 25% over slot size, 25% in slot and rest under. Good perch fishing and some lake trout. If you have any other questions, e-mail is [email protected]Bucks"
