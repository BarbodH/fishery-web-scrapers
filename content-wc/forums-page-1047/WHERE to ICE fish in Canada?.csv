510076,Guest,2000-10-18 18:15:00,0,TRY THE BAY OF QUINTE
510077,Guest,2000-10-20 12:54:00,0,"I have two locations that can produce lots of walleye near Winnipeg, Manitoba.The first location is the Red River downstream of Lockport to about Breezy Point. This area can produce many walleye under the right conditions. The second location is the Winnipeg River downstream of the dam at Pine Falls. There are a few roads off the main road through town that allow you to access the river. I have had luck at both locations."
510078,Guest,2000-10-20 14:42:00,0,Great.. what is the best time to head there?And come on other people lets here about some spots in canada for Ice fishing.thanks :)
510079,Frank from TBay,2000-10-20 17:40:00,312,Any large walleye lake in NW Ontario is a good bet. First ice and last ice are awesome. Lac des Mille Lacs is a good bet. I fish the lake all winter. Awesome fishing. Rent a shack from Pine Point or talk to Sugar Shack Rentals. Pine Point has a web site. Good fishing: Frank
510080,manitobawalleye,2000-10-20 18:17:00,885,"I live 20 minutes from the Red River and and 1 hour from Pine Falls,,, usually pop 6-10 over 8lbs a winter.... but I went to the Bay of Quinte for a week last winter and it puts the Red to shame....... go the 3rd week of feb.. fish the area from around the corner from telegraph narrows to picton harbour.... have never seen anything like it ... when i was there last year almost every third fish on the ice is 8 and up.... the morning i went a woman from toronto had a 17lb.... i am flying back the third week again... the added fun is seeing a 9 or 11 lber planing in the current 15' below your boots.... this area the ice is usually stable but telegraph narrows can be dangerous.... if you want to fish the red on a normal year good to mid jan .. then mid feb to end of year but the last 2 winters have been good all year...lots of pa boys at quinte... good luck with your choice... oh pine falls is not usually a hot big fish bite in the winter"
510081,Guest,2000-10-22 15:48:00,0,My suggestion is to ice fish Lake Nipissing in July.... Bring your parka and skis....Henry
