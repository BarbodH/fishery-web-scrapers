3355554,Gregking,2014-12-09 13:38:00,2658,"like free healthcare? LMAOI do wish the $2 would go to its intended purpose. I respect this increase much more than some trailer stamp, tax, label, test, what ever else it is."
3383242,P&y only,2014-12-21 10:24:00,133,"Say What? They're raising the prices by $2? Well, that's it then. I guess I'll have to go up a few more times to get my money's worth. I'll show them! Hopefully the ol' la.........my wife understands."
3308345,Golden Eagle,2014-11-15 08:51:00,2642,"Let's get the true story out there. 1. You ate so many deep fried walleyes the first 3 days of your trip that the rest of the trip was free for you.2. One day of catching pike rewarded you with more than the cost of a trip, let alone the price of an annual license. Your silver pike was, by far, the largest I've seen. p.s. You had a quality week up yonder. You owe yourself at least three weeks in 2015."
3309313,Whopper,2014-11-15 16:50:00,340,"You are correct sir, it was a great week with some quality fish caught and I had a great partner all week. I was referring to days on the water in Ontario, would have really like to have gotten those other two trips in. I was on a roll until July."
3335122,Goatboy,2014-11-28 16:46:00,8,"I am a Canadian who has been contributing to the license system for a long time. (Since I was 16 now 52). This supposed $2 is to help the resource,, That's the biggest crock of BS I've heard since the government refused to repeal a tax on boose they put on during WWII. ITS A TAX! If people believe they are going to use it for the natural resource then sorry to let you down. They will waste this needed revenue on whatever they see fit. Then say ""Oh sorry about that!"" People think the US government is waste full, the Canadian government is no better!"
3335226,v-bay gord,2014-11-28 17:39:00,3168,"Hey Goatboy, I like your thinking. 2 posts? You need to post more often!"
3348394,Obabikon,2014-12-06 06:25:00,2370,"Prices will always be going up... I'm still not sure why not just raise the prices, instead of adding a fee."
3352594,Lovetofish,2014-12-08 09:11:00,458,Be nice if we just just keep a lid on the gas prices. That's a big expense for many of us.
3352602,Obabikon,2014-12-08 09:17:00,2370,"That's the biggest expense for most resort owners too. Seems like every year I'm home and gas prices are low, exchange rate is good... then when its summer time... it goes the other way."
3355218,deadhead1,2014-12-09 09:20:00,193,"It is a tax, plain and simple. We have been told before that licence fees are going back to the resource but they seem to disappear in general revenue. I expect the same with this money."
3355474,Gregking,2014-12-09 12:08:00,2658,"spoken like a true business man. I just wish everyone could see things this way, especially our government."
3355546,AllenW,2014-12-09 13:34:00,11482,"I think the govt already does, they can't seem to spend money fast enough. I think people just want either govt to spend money like it wasn't growing on tree's. We get politicians here that say no new taxes, get voted in and come up with ""fee's"". Things like that are what most complain about. Nobody I know expects it to be free, not sure where some get that idea, they prob work for the govt... al"
3306593,bobbylfishermon,2014-11-14 10:40:00,241,"Right on Golden Eagle, I'm with you, it's money well spent, ****, a bottle of Forty Creek rye will probably be a couple bucks higher too, but I won't complain one bit!!"
3306833,wallydave,2014-11-14 11:59:00,2151,US or Canadian!?
3306881,Whopper,2014-11-14 12:29:00,340,"You may not have got cheated but I did, this was the first year in quite awhile that I bought an annual license that I didn't get my monies worth. Oh well there's always next year"
3306889,Mondo_)H,2014-11-14 12:36:00,91,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Forty Creek!
3307025,bobbylfishermon,2014-11-14 14:12:00,241,You said it all Mondo !!!
3307113,Fisherman1792,2014-11-14 14:46:00,927,I'm sick of this useless government nickel and diming us to death. It will be another $2 for all outdoor licenses. I buy multiple fishing and hunting license a year and the prices keep going up. I know its not much considering the money I spend on everything else to do what I like but this Ontario gov has not found a tax that it didn't like. Sorry for the rant! Fisherman 1792
3307153,bigwillies,2014-11-14 15:05:00,515,u can thank the dopes in the dopes in the g.t.a. area for re electing a corupt goverment.i feel your pain.
3307281,BreezyPoint,2014-11-14 16:03:00,1581,"Like everything else, everybody wants everything, but no one wants to pay for it. Or they want someone else to pay for it. They are running a deficit and need to fund it. The other option is to cut back on services. All I see here is complaining without any ideas or options to close to deficit. In my career, we ignored complainers, but if someone came forward with tangible, practical ideas, we listened to them.Frank"
3307497,Fisherman1792,2014-11-14 17:30:00,927,Glad someone else feels my pain! Thunder Bay is no better than S Ontario. They also elected two of those idiots and one is the minister that wants to add the two bucks to the hunting and fishing licenses. Fisherman 1792
3307945,rickn,2014-11-15 02:02:00,993,I think they could have much more money if they'd relax the DWI laws!
3301026,kzoofisher,2014-11-12 04:21:00,5144,For the record I support this. If I have to skip a bag of potato chips this year to afford a trip I'll make that sacrifice.
3301138,dutchboy,2014-11-12 05:49:00,5717,"As long as it stays in fish & wildlife it seems reasonable. Here in the Minnesota it stays where it is suppose to until the ink dries. At that point the slime balls in St. Paul start trying to get their hands on the money. Even though the amount ($2.00) is small, it's still a TAX no matter what they call it. You are being charged to use a natural resource."
3301258,bigwalleye1,2014-11-12 06:31:00,2632,"Beginning in December 2014, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry will introduce a $2 service fee to directly support fish and wildlife management across Ontario. All fees will be invested through the Fish and Wildlife Special Purpose Account. Fish and wildlife programs improve fishing and hunting in Ontario through licensing, enforcement, scientific research and fish stocking. The service fee will be applied to: Outdoors Cards. Hunting and fishing licences. Draws for which a fee is charged. The service fee will be charged across all points of purchase, including: Online. By phone. In-person at a ServiceOntario counter or private licence issuer. Quick Facts The Fish and Wildlife Special Purpose Account currently supports approximately two-thirds of fishing and hunting opportunities in Ontario. I thought that was the whole purpose of the fee for the Outdoors card...."
3301378,Pooch,2014-11-12 07:16:00,4619,"Ditto ""bigwalleye1"". That is what I thought, too. Why not just increase the license price and cut out the other BS and management costs associated with this new fee? Typical bloated, inefficient government bull.Pooch"
3301754,tv4fish,2014-11-12 09:34:00,2694,Anyone know for sure that the cost will only be $2.00 ? The way it sounds - it's going to be $2.00 more for our Outdoor Card (when we need to renew it) and another $2.00 for our yearly fishing license????
3301978,Kenny_Ross,2014-11-12 10:55:00,103,Once collected it gets pooled into the general revenue fund. Once there good luck using it for what it was supposedly collected for. Kenny
3302482,retire55,2014-11-12 14:25:00,1029,"For those interested in understanding the MNR rationale for increasing fees, see the discussion paper available at http://apps.mnr.gov.on.ca/public/fil...rod_110525.pdf The fees for all resident and non-resident angling and hunting licences and permits go into a Special Purpose Account (SPA) Fees for Ontario resident angling and hunting licences and permits constitute 61% of the SPA Fees for non-resident angling and hunting licences and permits constitute 33% of the SPA The Ministry of Natural Resources fish and wildlife program costs 100 million annually. Unfortunately, the SPA only cover 67% of that annual cost. So the MNR is looking for ways to increase revenues. Here's an excerpt from page 37 of the discussion paper Short Term Actions (2014 Â– 15) In the short-term, to address forecasted declines in SPA revenues, MNR must focus on actions that can be implemented immediately, including: 1.Introduce a $2 processing fee to recover overhead costs associated with administering licences in 2015. MNR will also continue to make annual adjustments to existing fees to reflect increases in the cost of living"
3306273,adempsey,2014-11-14 09:18:00,963,"So, it's basically a $2 admin fee. No surprise there."
3306305,bobbylfishermon,2014-11-14 09:24:00,241,"I don't have a problem with any of it, our trips to Canada are a little piece of Heaven right here on earth, and as a OL' Marine, our trips sooth the savage beast, according to my wife, that's why she lets me go solo a couple times also. Canada is most certainly a ""breath of fresh air"" !!"
3306377,Golden Eagle,2014-11-14 09:37:00,2642,Charge me more and I'll spend more time fishing in NW Ontario. Made three trips this year and didn't get cheated on pricing.
