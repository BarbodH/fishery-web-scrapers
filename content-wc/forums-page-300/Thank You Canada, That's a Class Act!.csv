When US based teams are playing in Canada the Star Spangled Banner is sung. Why would we not sing the US Anthem? We are proud to be North Americans and to have the US as our ally to the South. We have fought together in two World Wars, in Korea, in Afghanistan. We have the same values for freedom and democracy. When we attend a Winnipeg Jets game here or in St. Paul, MN we stand and sing both anthems, PROUDLY."

3329377,Juls,2014-11-25 09:42:00,13414,Saw that on Facebook the other day....nice.
3329577,Larbo,2014-11-25 11:20:00,231,Now that is some real sportsmanship!
3329665,wallydave,2014-11-25 12:00:00,2151,That crowd can teach us all a lesson on what it means to be a class act!
3329937,BornToFish,2014-11-25 14:05:00,1224,That was a class act all the way! Well done to all my friends to the north!
3330017,phishfearme,2014-11-25 14:34:00,1242,very classy indeed - it's amazing that the crowd new the words as many singers get them wrong. wonder what would've happened if that occurred in the US during the Canadian nation anthem??
3330713,Nimstug,2014-11-25 20:26:00,2605,"You can hear people singing O, Canada along with Jim Cornelieson at the U.C. My guess is we would do something similar. Nimstug...myself included."

3332802,btyreprich,2014-11-27 05:49:00,1067,"We in the US are truly blessed to have neighbors / friends in Canada. Agree with the previous posts - class act all the way. Must be a lot of moms in Canada raising their kids the ""right"" way in terms of how to behave."
