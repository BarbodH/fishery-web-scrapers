3370722,retire55,2014-12-16 08:57:00,1029,Congrats on having a working sonar unit with such a low current draw.
3370954,adempsey,2014-12-16 10:15:00,963,Many of the B&W units draw 200mA or less with the backlight off. My portable Humminbirds are around 100 and 150 mA. You will find many of the lower priced units that draw 100mA or less.
3372202,lassh,2014-12-16 18:03:00,553,"I can vouch for the old eagles. Mine is an Eagle Fishmark 240. Lowrance has the same model but I don't know the model #. I've brought mine on fly-ins for at least 10 years maybe 15. If you turn them off when not needed, lunch time, night time, if you are anchored or fishing a site based structure, they will last all week. I do usually bring a set of spare batteries but have not used them. Mine displays surface temp and does grey scale and shows arcs. It is a black and white one which is one of the reasons it used less power. If you are spending a lot of time in really deep water (trolling for lakers for long periods of time) it seems that the batteries discharge quicker due to the more power the transducer signal takes. Mine uses 8 D cells."
3380114,forgop,2014-12-19 19:46:00,880,We used a portable humminbird 571 HD di that ran on a 12v battery. Darn near last a week and would be my recommended way to go if you have any sort of generator or solar charging system than messing with batteries.
3367834,eyegator,2014-12-15 09:01:00,29,"We recently booked a trip with Kabeelo for the middle of July-- can't wait!My question is- does anyone have any good recommendations for a fish finder that runs on AA or D batteries? We are tight on weight and a couple of 12V batteries gets heavy and no way to recharge them there.I'm a fish finder rookie- so I'm not sure where to start. Really just looking to mark depth and ""mark"" fish if possible."
3367906,oleJoe,2014-12-15 10:10:00,114,"Our group of 6 takes 3 eagle ""cuda's"" They run on 8 AA batteries and uses a suction cup for the transducer Be sure to tie both the transducer an the base to the boat. Hey I only lost one! A set of alkaline batteries will usually last a week if turned off at night and lunch times. We always take spare batteries for these and flashlights that use the same. Ours is a fly-in also and for all three your talking maybe 7 lbs. You can run full out with a 10 hp. Just make sure you put it on good the first time. Depth and water temp are good. It does make a difference. Enjoy your trip!!"
3368210,BornToFish,2014-12-15 11:59:00,1224,"You are asking a great question. I've found that depth of water being fished is an extremely important consideration when fishing on lakes within the Canadian Shield, especially as the season progresses into mid-summer and autumn. I'm guessing that there isn't an electronic ""lake map"" available for your lake of choice, such that gps isn't a consideration for your upcoming purchase. I happen to run a higher end Humminbird unit when fishing in Ontario. The unit is set up to be easily portable and can be installed in a matter of minutes. I attach two alligator clips to the cranking battery in the boat. I don't know if it can be operated with C or D cell batteries. My Humminbird unit is the second best money that I have spent for fishing equipment when fishing in Ontario. The best money spent was for a good walleye rod. I use the sonar unit to locate structure (depth of water) and monitoring bottom texture/content (mud vs. weeds vs. rocks vs. sand vs. gravel, etc.). These two factors are extremely important to me when fishing during mid summer through autumn. Marking a fish is strictly a bonus, and nothing more than that to me, as I then know that there are fish present. I catch many hundreds of walleyes each season. The vast majority of these fish are never ""marked"" on the sonar unit. I only leave a piece of structure when I have proven to myself through fishing it that fish aren't present, and not because I didn't mark anything. I strongly encourage you to get the largest monitor that you can afford and is practical. After this, consider getting the best resolution available and get a color monitor. The color monitor will tell you a great deal about bottom texture/content. The brand you buy is your choice. Asking for a recommendation for a brand of sonar unit is sort of like religion and politics - everyone has an opinion that is right. As the gentleman before me posted, be certain to tie the transducer and the unit to the boat. Experience is a great teacher.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3368434,MrSimon,2014-12-15 13:44:00,922,"I had EXCELLENT luck by buying an entry level Humminbird unit, cutting the end of the cord off, and splicing in a small plastic battery holder that fits 8 AA batteries (12 volts). I attached the transducer to a 24"" piece of aluminum with a strong spring clamp on the other end. Worked like a charm and the batteries lasted the entire week, using them about 30-40% of the time in the boat."
3368610,adempsey,2014-12-15 14:55:00,963,"They operate their own aircraft, so I wouldn't worry too much about weight. A few pounds over won't bother them, besides if they did charge you, it would cost an extra $10 for two 12V batteries. Worth it if you ask me.With respect to sonars, I don't know if any company even make sonars that come with alkaline battery packs any more?? You might have to check the used market for one. Eagle (now Lowrance) made some that were popular.An alternative would be a Humminbird PiranhaMAX portable unit (155/165/175 PT or older). Try to find one used. It doesn't have to be portable, but it's more convenient if it is.The most important consideration is the power consumption of the unit you buy. Stick with a monochrome screen with limited features and you should be good.As mentioned, you can replace the 12V gel cell with a 12V battery pack (8 alkalines in series). I've tested this quite a bit with 8 AA and 8 D cell batteries - alkaline and NiMH. Works like a charm. You can order the battery cases online or you probably can find them at a local electronic store for a few dollars. You can add some FASTON tabs to the battery pack or just hard wire it to the sonar. If you want to use rechargable NiMH, only use AA, the D's aren't good enough yet. Make sure they are at least 2000 mAh as well.Another battery alternative is two 6V lantern batteries. The F-cell type are 15 Ah and would run a simple sonar for ~150 hours.Also, are you sure you can't charge anything? The website indicates that the outposts have solar lights, so it should have a battery pack. If you buy an inverter you can connect that to the ""solar battery"" and plug your charger into the inverter. I am not sure if all outfitters are OK with this or not, so you'd need to ask them."
3368722,kzoofisher,2014-12-15 15:28:00,5144,Don't get a color screen. Eats up power at a much faster rate.
3368770,Pooch,2014-12-15 15:44:00,4619,Search the electronics forum on this website. This has been discussed many times before.Don't by a color screen UNLESS the camp boats have electric start and you can access the battery.Don't expect to buy a feature laden locator with gps or you will eat batteries.Pooch
3369146,retire55,2014-12-15 18:16:00,1029,"Many black and white sonars (5 inch display) have current draws of approximately 300 milliamps per hour with the back light off or 3000 milliamps per each 10 hour day. Consequently, for six 10 hour days of sonar use, you'll need a power supply that can provide you access to approximately 20,000 milliamps of power. By comparison, my HDS7 (colour sonar/GPS combo unit) draws over 1000 milliamps per hour The typical motorcycle battery weighs 5 pounds and has 7 amp hours of power or 7000 milliamps. Eight D-cell batteries weigh about 5 pounds and provide 12,000 to 16,000 milliamps of power On a fly in trip last Jun, our overweight charges were calculated at $0.75 per pound"
3370370,Pooch,2014-12-16 07:02:00,4619,"I have a couple ""D"" cell battery packs that each hold four cells for a total of six volts. They are sized to match a six volt flashlight battery. Found them on the internet years ago after I grew tired of paying for over priced six volts.If you open up a six volt battery it is most likely four ""D""cells in series then wrapped into a single unit.That was about the time we quit doing fly in trips that didn't have electric start. (changed for different lake, not because of the electric start motors). You probable could still find them in a search.Just look at the current draw before deciding on a new finder. Very, very important.My favorite finder for a remote trip is a Zercon LCD flasher. Out of production for many years, but a great unit that would run several weeks on a small gel cell.Pooch"
3370634,zeebee,2014-12-16 08:11:00,1144,Dont know where you get your stats but I know I run my 15 yr old Eagle portable over 100 hrs on 8 D's.
