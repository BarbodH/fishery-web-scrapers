I was wondering what 144 is like between Sudbury and Gogama and beyond. We have never been to Thunderstock on Lake Kenogaming and going next year because my son wants to bear hunt and after some research this looks good for bear hunting and fishing. We will call the lodge from Gogama and it's an hour to their landing where we will be barged in to our cabin. Also wondering what the road is like from Gogama to the landing. Merry Christmas to All, Seanik"

I think this place you are going to used to be called Kenogaming Lake Lodge. It looks like a pretty nice spot.Well kept and nice boats and motors.Being so close to Timmins, just wondering how the fishing is?? Doesn't look like Erie is going to co-operate with us for some great perch fishing does it?We are flying in with Hearst Air in early May. Will let you know how our trip went. Are you going back to Buck/Bingwood again?"

3383194,Seanik,2014-12-21 10:03:00,218,"Hi Pete, After phoning new owner, locals from Timmins rarely fish Kenogaming, too many good lakes near Timmins. We probably would have done a fly-in in 2015 but my son wanted a bear hunt and for the first time my 11 year old grandson will be going. Many limits were caught on Lake Erie this past season, 2015 is also predicted to be another banner year. Keep in touch for the latest perch info, the marina boat out of has many perch fisherman and they go out almost every day weather permitting. Merry Christmas Pete Seanik"
