3373658,LOW1,2014-12-17 10:10:00,2828,Here is a kenora real estate company that has rentals http://www.cabincountry.com/rentals.php
3373714,LOW1,2014-12-17 10:30:00,2828,http://lowdpoa.com/ This association publishes a magazine about the LOTW area with a classified ad section. There always are ads for rentals. I don't think the magazine is online but I bet you could email them and see what is currently advertised. The Kenora Daily Miner newspaper and its sister publication The Lake of the Woods Enterprise are online and have ads from time to time for rentals. Enjoy your trip.
