3347186,offthehook67,2014-12-05 11:08:00,2122,Is it this guy who caught the new Washington State record this year? Probably not but this is one heck of a fat pig.
3347218,offthehook67,2014-12-05 11:23:00,2122,My PB is a 31.5 caught back in the mid 90's This year the 2 largest a 28 and 28.5. One in late May and the other in Mid Sept during the MWC on Cass.
3363602,oilguy,2014-12-13 04:29:00,257,"An unbelievable Fall on the river this year. These are 31"",31"",31.25"" all caught on the same day. We also caught a 29"" that day. The 31.25"" was 10.8 lbs"
3363610,oilguy,2014-12-13 04:38:00,257,"The first pic is the best one we caught this Fall. 32"", 11.9 lbs. It was actually the first one we caught over 30 inches and it managed to hold up as the best fish all Fall. The next are a couple of other good ones from a day where we caught 8 over 8 pounds! The best part is we caught these 30 minutes from my doorstep"
3364026,offthehook67,2014-12-13 09:07:00,2122,Very nice!

3377042,BBogey,2014-12-18 12:44:00,585,offthehook67 - that is the guy from Washington that caught the state record - they weighed it at that meat shop. (it had a certified scale as I recall)
3377050,offthehook67,2014-12-18 12:46:00,2122,Yup I was aware. I threw it on here as it is just an awesome fish to look at.
3377402,BBogey,2014-12-18 13:55:00,585,"Oh ya, it's all downhill from there... you pretty much know that you've the biggest eye you'll ever catch"
3329089,Mike Kansas,2014-11-25 07:40:00,1463,"Dang, I was in hope that you caught a 37 3/8 eye. That would have been awesome for all of us to see. keep a tight line because we all know there is one that big or bigger down there waiting for one of us. I saw the 39"" Eye that is still the Manitoba record. It was caught on the Red River south of Selkirk by a 10 year old boy whose mom owned the resort that we were at when he caught it. Mike Kansas"
3329473,Mojo1269,2014-11-25 10:25:00,816,I caught a 28 inch fish on Cedar in ONT. I was cathing walleyes off some shore structure snap jigging and I kept seeing a big arc on my Bird so I dropped a Bondy bait (musky lure) down and started jigging. 5 minutes lter the 28 incher crushed the bondy bait which is about 8 inches long and 6 ozs...
3342097,Consigliere,2014-12-02 17:52:00,132,"Got this super fat 32.5"" in the St Lawrence on the weekend. Weighed out at 15 lbs. Fattest fish I have ever seen for its length. Gut was absolutely huge. I'm sure just full of gobies.On the same afternoon we caught a 31"" over 12lbs, a 30"" over 10lbs and a 28"" and a pike. Lost 3 really good pulls on the boards, all hit better than the big walleyes but who knows."
3342377,Gregking,2014-12-02 21:00:00,2658,"27.5"" on Francis case"

3347026,Mike Kansas,2014-12-05 09:43:00,1463,"My wife has done the same thing to me on several occasions. I dread hearing her say""I'm snagged honey"" That simply means stop the boat get out the landing net and be prepared to hear about it all winter. God Bless her. Mike Kansas"

3320529,Mike Kansas,2014-11-20 12:41:00,1463,OK...I will go first...Where is the picture?
3321105,pjshorthorn,2014-11-20 18:26:00,5654,"Instead of the Red Lake package from last year, it looks like we will need an Eagle Lake package for 2015. Hope you will have a few other secret weapons that will work and add to our success just like last year.PjShorthorn"
3322393,KM1,2014-11-21 12:33:00,374,"had 6 or more fish between the 28"" and 31"" range. Largest one, not pictured (who loses a pic of a 31"" fish....arrgh), was a solid 31"" 10.5lb fish taken on a lindy rig. Water on LOTW was VERY high this year, higher than I have ever seen it. It was our first trip back to the big lake in many years....hoping to build on this trip as each season passes. Only hope that patterning the fish is a little easier in the coming years. I agree with John L Hecklsmiller's comments earlier...the high water made things difficult when it came to patterning the fish....very unpredictable....and on a daily basis. Pics below:"
3322665,tv4fish,2014-11-21 14:59:00,2694,"Mike: No.1 - I think he meant for his ""handle"" to be whopper and not whooper and I think he has been fishing in a walleye ""rearing pond"" - you know - where they are ALL huge females........"
3322929,Whopper,2014-11-21 16:54:00,340,"Yes tv4fish you may be correct. For a second I was trying to figure out how someone could use my user name. Mike Kansas you wouldn't have to ask for a picture if I caught a walleye that big. I did however get a pair of 30's on Lake Erie last spring, one casting and one trolling."
3323129,Baxman1958,2014-11-21 19:46:00,14,"Out of curiosity, which 30"" er fought better - or better yet - was more fun to catch?"
3324177,Whopper,2014-11-22 16:26:00,340,"The first 30 came on 3/8 Earie Dearie on a twelve count on the swing she hit it pretty hard and stayed deep. The second one didn't even release the rubber band on the clip pulling big boards, just had it stretched a bit. I actually thought it was a white bass until it got close to the boat. Hands down the one caught casting"
3327777,freespoolin,2014-11-24 14:24:00,472,"I also agree with John H., LOTW was a bust for me this year. We never found fish in the places we usually find fish. As to big fish, only one 28"" in the Winnipeg River at Pine Falls."
3297210,micropterus,2014-11-10 08:30:00,450,"28, 28.5, 30 within a 1/2 hour. My son got the big one again!"
3298762,BBogey,2014-11-10 21:55:00,585,"I had never caught one over 20"" until this year - My wife had never caught one over 18""... then we caught these two within a couple of hours of each other!http://photos.imageevent.com/bogey/f...%20walleye.jpg"
3300170,Papa eye,2014-11-11 15:38:00,124,"23"" for my wife... Just slightly less for me:"
3302602,Carnhzkr,2014-11-12 15:37:00,964,"My PB, 28.5"" caught on Onaman Lake on a HOT and sunny August day. Probably would have gone 29"" if I'd have pinched the tail. Best part was getting a unsolicited high five from my 16 year old son. Notice one hand holding the gill plate and the other supporting the fish's belly in a near horizontal position (I just got done reading the Proper Fish Holding Technique thread)."
3306217,bobbylfishermon,2014-11-14 09:03:00,241,"I'm a troller and was trolling #5 crawdad shad raps on Indian Lake and whacked a 32incher in 6ft. of water (my PB), took a picture and released the old girl, turned the ol"" Crestliner around and went back thru and my wife whacked a 30incher in the same spot. Both fish were spawned out and released, 62 inches of wallys in 15minutes. my wife's PB is a 34 incher out of Lac Qui Parle, in Minnesota. I've been fishing for 56years and never seen anything like that before and probably won't see it again. We thanked the GOOD LORD for his creations, and headed back to cabin for a glass of Rye. Life is good!!"
3313113,patricktjms,2014-11-17 13:27:00,67,27.5 inch from Blindfold Lake NW Ontario. July 5th. TDD fire tiger.
3316377,Wall-i-Lama,2014-11-18 17:36:00,1524,Caught several large ones on Detroit river and Lake Erie during prefish and nwt. Best was 29.
3316721,Smallmouth Hunter,2014-11-18 19:30:00,84,Right at 30 but she was skinny. Lake of the Woods in June.
3318825,Curryale,2014-11-19 15:44:00,50,Just last weekend caught my biggest of the year at 10 lbs 4 ounces

3290810,SoulFulCry,2014-11-07 10:55:00,158,the best i did this yr was 2 28.5s one on red lake n the other at minaki during the tourney
3291066,troutwater,2014-11-07 12:29:00,299,Cliff Lake 24.5 caught on a 10 inch jake. Yeah I was muskie fishing
3291378,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2014-11-07 14:49:00,629,"28""+ on the US side in early June on the reefs with a BB & a Worm Harness. Mid to late June the lake started to receive its version of a Northern ""Monson"". By early July the lake had risen in the neighborhood of 4+ ft. with Rainy River flood conditions. I also hope next year is better! In my 15 seasons on the South Shore of LOTW, I would have to rate the 2014 season no better than a D+ to a C- for an overall rating of weather & personal fishing success!CRJohn"
3291922,pjshorthorn,2014-11-07 19:25:00,5654,"Red Lake this year. The son caught a personal best 28 1/4"" off the Eagle's Nest shoreline at Halls Bay. He was using a Sirmanski chartreuse bullet head jig. Not sure who makes these jigs but that is all the son caught fish on this year. Myself, I'm not even sure what my biggest eye was on the trip. It was so much fun watching my son out fish myself that I never really kept track. If anyone knows who makes Sirmanski jigs, let me know. I need to get some more for next year I'll I know is that this 28 1/4"" walleye is one old fish on Red Lake. PjShorthorn"
3292034,NathanH,2014-11-07 20:17:00,697,You can just google the name a guy who started the thread runs the business. Mikes a **** of a guy and takes care of his customers.
3292442,wallydave,2014-11-08 06:46:00,2151,"Pat that jig was part of Mike Kansas Red Lake Special package. Mike and I fished out of Black Bear Lodge a year ago! Great guy to fish with, I have used his jigs for several years. Pat and his son Ben joined Breezy Point and I for a great week on Red Lake in August this year."
3293922,fishron,2014-11-08 17:18:00,317,It's been a couple of years since I've hit the 30 inch mark but the season is not quite over yet. This year a couple of 28 inchers.

3288634,Mike Kansas,2014-11-06 08:46:00,1463,"It is time to see who caught the big girls in 2014. Let us know about yours. Mine was 28 1/2"" but my wife as always whipped me like a dog when she caught a 29 3/4"". I'm getting use to it because she does it every year. As a side note our two trips to Lac Seul this year made this year our best out of the last 30 years. The Walleye were very aggessive this year and we saw a lot more slot and above fish this year. The last two days we were on Lac Seul this year fishing with Guide Basil out of Lost Island Lodge five of us (two couples and my wifes brother) caught over 800 Walleye in those two days. A great finish to an awesome week. Thank God to Mother Nature for her bounty. Mike Kansas"

I'm so disgusted about it I put the boat away 2 weeks earlier than usual. Think all the lakes in Manitoba must be fished out! LOL. Looking forward to next year and maybe redeem myself."
3289346,ftfarms,2014-11-06 16:28:00,444,I got nothing. 21 inches was my biggest. 26-1/2 was the biggest in my boat this year and that was Richards biggest to date. We hit a cold front and the big girls were hard to find.
3290138,Ferrispata,2014-11-07 07:00:00,63,"If I went on more than 1 trip a year maybe mine would be bigger but I have a 23.5 inch and in the same boat, we did have a 28 incher."
3290378,tlars,2014-11-07 08:09:00,137,"Mike, I'm like you. My wife caught a 29 1/4"" on Lac Seul in August while I followed it up with a 29"" on the same spot about a half hour later. We also had the same experience as you with numbers. We ran out of minnows 3 times during our week at Fisherman's Cove. We commented a couple of times that it was almost like spring crappie fishing. What a fishery! Looking forward to 8/15/15 when we head back."
3290490,Mike Kansas,2014-11-07 08:33:00,1463,"tlars, Glad to hear that you did so well. It was truly a year to remember on Lac Seul. The most amazing thing was it seemed the fish had a lot more fight than years past and when you found a school they were thicker than hair on a dogs back. Have a great trip next year. Mike Kansas"
