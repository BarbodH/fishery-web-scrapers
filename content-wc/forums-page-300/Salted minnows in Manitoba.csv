3349554,Greg Lappin,2014-12-06 18:52:00,3,I have fished Ontario for last 20 years. Have 1st opportunity to fish Manitoba. Two questions please. Can you bring salted minnows over the border from US into Manitoba? Either yes or no- what are secrets to keep salted minnows useable? Thank you
3351786,hoosiercanadian,2014-12-07 19:47:00,104,"Yes you can bring salted minnows into Manitoba, i salt my own, in a small cooler, pour a layer of pickling salt, or kosher salt, place minowws on that layer kind of side to side, not piled up on top of another , then another layer of salt. then some more minnows, and so on, it is that simple. For only a weeks stay just leave them in the salt, and stay covered in a cool area, and they will be fine. Tip a jig with them and the walleye will love them, my daughters started out using crawlers, and i used my minnows, many. times the fish preferred the salted minnows to the night crawlers. My daughters eventually switched to them . If you leave the minnows in the salt longer than a week, the salt will remove all the moisture from them and the minnows will become tough , so alot of people remove them from the salt and place them in a freezer after a few days, just depends on how particular you and the fish are."
3351922,Greg Lappin,2014-12-07 21:04:00,3,Thanks for the great response. Can you salt them and leave frozen for a week or two until you make your trip and are ready to use?How does that affect usability?Much appreciation
3352186,Bandit,2014-12-08 05:03:00,140,Yes freeze them in air tight bag or container with salt they last up to 6 months. After fishing try drying them out before re freezing & add salt in If needed.

3352354,BornToFish,2014-12-08 07:17:00,1224,"I looked into trying salted minnows two years ago when fishing in NW Ontario. I found a ""recipe"" from FishOil on this website for salting minnows:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...salted+minnows His recipe worked well for me. As suggested in a post above, make sure the minnows are evenly distributed throughout the salt + borax mixture as you want all of the minnows to be evenly dried. In his recipe, FishOil specifies to NOT freeze the salted minnows. I kept the minnows in a refrigerator the entire time and did not freeze them. I don't know what would happen if they were frozen. Would they get mushier when frozen compared to refrigerated? I have seen several posts suggesting anglers take several salted minnows out at a time and rinse them off. This minimizes the amount of salt that can get into cuts and on fishing equipment. Their is merit to this suggestion! I used the salted minnows and found them to work well for walleyes. Personally, I believe they are at their best with horizontal presentations - bottom bouncing, cast/retrieve, etc. In these situations, I think the walleyes have a reaction type bite, they see it and have to decide to eat or not as the bait will be gone in a little while. In contrast, I prefer live minnows to salted minnows with a vertical presentation. It seems that the walleyes have too much time to think about the salted minnows when it's fairly stationary in the water column. Good luck in the upcoming season!"
3354434,Guest,2014-12-08 22:57:00,0,The best way to freeze minnows is fresh without salt..once frozen you can even top up containers with water to stop freezer burn. same as a lot of people do with fillets ...salted minnows don't seem to keep well in the freezer.. Now when you go fishing just place the minnows from the container into a larger container and add pickling salt to them...best is leave in fridge overnite the day b4 using. just fantastic this way as some are just starting to pickle as you use them.. I have done it this way for years
