3347042,Jwendt15,2014-12-05 09:48:00,72,"It was actually through Budget. $580 for 8 days was the final price, must have just got lucky. We are talking about just renting 2 cars. Can easily get a full size car under 350. With gas at $4 a gallon, it just didn't make sense. A little different if it's closer to $2 by this summer"
3347154,Golden Eagle,2014-12-05 10:45:00,2642,"Auto insurance carriers receive discounts from certain auto rental agencies. You might call your agent to determine what discounts might be available to you. Wouldn't hurt to ask the auto rental guy one question. Is that the best you can do? That's worked for me, more than once. My best was from the Yellow Pages guy, when I received a 10% discount for 12 months. This summer I was shopping a used Ford F150 at a fair price. I was the first looker and asked if that was the best he could do. Came down $300 and I wrote a check."
3344841,Jwendt15,2014-12-04 08:02:00,72,"Well, it's getting close to that time of year again. We have a trip scheduled at Onaway Lodge on Lac Seul on June 12th. Starting to make preparations for the trip from Illinois. Last year I was able to get a 12 passenger van from budget for 600 all in. This year, the cheapest quote I can find is more than twice that. For those of you who rent, where do you go and how do you find the best price? Maybe we just got lucky last year, but 1300 seems like a lot."
3344978,MrSimon,2014-12-04 09:04:00,922,Don't forget to call the dealerships ... they often rent vans.
3345274,Seanik,2014-12-04 11:21:00,218,"We rented a van from a local Ford dealer 2 years ago for our annual trip North. The cost for 10 days was 1100.00. I also called Enterprise and they said their rentals were not allowed to leave the USA, some vehicle rental companies have this policy. Van rental adds about 300.00 each for a 4 man group, our group used 2 vehicles last year to cut expenses, even with the added fuel cost it work out well. On the other hand if we drive over 150 miles of gravel to the Gouin in Quebec a rental is the way to go. Seanik"
3345330,jimirjr,2014-12-04 11:51:00,1149,How many Guys are going? We usually rent a MINI VAN for 4 of Us out of Colorado.. Right around $725 for 12 days.
3345546,Knutson21,2014-12-04 13:56:00,348,We rent from Bandago. It was $1100.00 from Chicago to Vermillion Bay and back. This was a 15 passanger ford fan. I actually pulled my boat up with it. They are the only rental company that I am aware of that allows towing. It cost $10 per day for towing. We only had 4 guys we thought we were going to have 5. If we knew that we were only going to have the 4 we would not have rented.
3345642,onetimedave,2014-12-04 15:21:00,502,"We rent a 15 passenger van to go from Eastern Ohio to Nakina Ontario, a trip of approx. 1100 mile and total time of 10 days. Cost is $1200.00. The rental is from a U-SAVE rental agency. Taking van into Ontario no problem. We have 6 in our group. Travel time is 21 hours."
3346618,MrSimon,2014-12-05 07:14:00,922,"I've often thought about buying an old conversion van for a couple thousand bucks on Craigslist and turning it into a dedicated fishing trip vehicle. I figure buy one for $2k and put $2k into it to make it reliable and comfortable. It would pay for itself in three years. Not to mention I just think conversion vans with shag carpet, curtains on the windows, and VCRs are AWESOME!"
3346690,MrSimon,2014-12-05 07:27:00,922,"Five minutes of searching on Craigslist and ...... For the same price as renting, you could OWN this beauty!!!"
3346714,MrSimon,2014-12-05 07:34:00,922,"Or step it up a notch .... for $3k you could be the proud owner of your very own memory-making, Ontario adventuremobile. OK, I'll get back to work now. Sorry for the interruption."
3346834,Golden Eagle,2014-12-05 08:04:00,2642,"If a guy provided a 12 passenger van @ $600 for my fishing trip, I'd be wondering why he wanted me out of town. Would set up game cams in my driveway to find out what visitors came around while I was fishing. Could it be Mr. Car Dealer?Hoping OP knows I'm funning. Sometimes good deals are out there."
