3347322,Wawajake,2014-12-05 12:48:00,413,"Best day of 2014 was perch fishing with my 3 year old grand daughter, where I soon weaned her off the red and white boober and had her feeling the nibble with her Dora fishing rod and yanking dozens of fish in.........all smiles. She said ""Opa I need to get a Fishergirl hat "" (she is getting one for Christmas from me). The OPP even dropped by to check our boat and my Boating Card...but they kept it light and handed out lolipop suckers to the kids."
3348042,billy weaver,2014-12-05 19:54:00,470,I enjoy reading about fathers and grandfathers passing on the joy of fishing to their children. I started taking my grandson to Canada when he was six years old and that was seven years ago. These trips have been the most enjoyable of my life. The one thing I stress is don't put any pressure on the young ones to fish. Tell them to fish when they want to fish and rest or play when they want rest. And be sure to take plenty of pictures so they can show mom when they get home and do a little bragging. (Believe me they will)
3348210,BBogey,2014-12-05 23:05:00,585,"Ya, I wish I was half as patient with my son as I am my grandson... but I guess it's just different or maybe I'm just older and wiser..."
3366234,btmbncr,2014-12-14 14:14:00,492,The best day walleye fishing I have any year is any day I get to walleye fish with my wife.Bill
3367514,Bigstorm,2014-12-15 06:39:00,799,"best day for me this year was a 2hr period on the last day of our Canada trip in July. We stopped at a new spot for us, ended with 11 walleyes, smallest was 23"" and we had 4 between 26"" and 27"" plus a bonus 34"" northern."
3319337,wallydave,2014-11-19 18:38:00,2151,"In August, I got to spend a week on Red Lake with a couple of guys from WC , Breezy Point, and pjshorthorn and his son Ben. The day of that week was the day pj and Ben landed a 44 in. pike and a 28.5 walleye! Jim, the owner had picures of both trophy fish delivered to the cabin befor the guys got there! A nice fire that night, telling stories of other trips! How can any day up North be better than the rest?!"
3319433,Baxman1958,2014-11-19 19:20:00,14,"Mike, That is one of the greatest outdoor videos featuring a lucky dad and his young son that I have ever had the privilege to watch. There's nothing better than to see your son or daughter just having a ball, doing something that DAD likes to do too! Brendan is one heck of a fisherman for his age. I've seen experienced fisherman 40 - 80 years old that couldn't play big fish like that. Thank you - you need to think about getting some of your work published. Looking forward to more - Bax"
3319521,Mike Borger,2014-11-19 19:47:00,1554,"Awfully kind words, thank you! My son's been on a lot of trips and has a keen interest in the sport. Like every dad I'm proud of my boy. I just asked him what he wanted for Christmas earlier tonight and he said some new Doctor spoons LOL!For some time now I've been a regular contributor to Ontario Out Of Doors magazine, one of the reasons I've been able to travel so much."
3320177,RickOnt,2014-11-20 08:48:00,217,"Yes Mike Brendan is becoming quite the Fisherman, Its great to see a video of him catching big Fish A chip off the ole block!! LOL You are gonna have a hard time leaving him at home! He will want to go on every trip. As for the Dr Spoons I ordered mine last year, online, and I had them in 4 days Cheers Rick"
3320393,SoulFulCry,2014-11-20 11:07:00,158,doing a walleye tournament for the first time with my son it was his real first shot at it n we did really well ill remeber that weekend for ever

3324889,Skywagon,2014-11-23 05:28:00,1106,Ben Beattie made the cover of the magazine this month. Congrats Ben.
3325297,BBogey,2014-11-23 09:56:00,585,"Very enjoyable thread, and I like seeing that what seems to be the most important to everyone is a special trip with family or friends, not necessarily how great the fishing was!"
3345674,tlars,2014-12-04 15:32:00,137,"It's hard for me to pick my favorite day from the 3rd week in August, '14 on Lac Seul out of Fisherman's Cove. On Monday, we had a 29 1/4 and a 29 about a half hour apart. On Thursday we had a 25 and 26 1/2 double. Lac Seul was just a dream trip this year. Only 255 days to go."
3345778,michigan walleye guy,2014-12-04 16:36:00,95,"I go on the Canadian fly-in trips for the big numbers of walleyes, but I go to the Boundary Waters of Minnesota/Canada for the hawgs. On July 9 of this year, my friend and I caught and released 7 walleyes between 28-32"" in about 45 minutes on the Canadian side of a border lake on the Gunflint Trail. It's on a rock pile coming up out of 60 feet of water, topping off at about 10 feet, and it's a spot we come back to every year. Sometimes the fish just aren't there, but when they are, it's awesome. We use the biggest jumbo leeches we can find, fished on #8 hooks with slip bobbers, and 6 pound test line. I've caught walleyes to 33"" on this lake. We sure don't fish this lake for numbers, but July 9 of this summer was my best day of 2014."
3317753,Mike Kansas,2014-11-19 08:53:00,1463,Tell us about your best day of fishing in 2014. Mine was watching my 7 yr old grandson catch 30 or so Walleye and Perch on a lake in Wisconsin. He was lite up like a Xmas tree and smiling from ear to ear. He is now talking about going to Canada with me and in fact told me I could use his piggy bank money for Canada if I needed it. Mike Kansas
3317857,NathanH,2014-11-19 09:30:00,697,When I got my 15 month old son out for the first time in our new boat. Got to fish a total of 5 minutes. He was so happy running around the boat yelling Fish and Duck. The future never looked so bright.
3317881,Lovetofish,2014-11-19 09:52:00,458,Fishing with my family on our annual Canada trip. We were catching a lot of walleye and I brought up a $700 rod/reel that hadn't been in the water very long. Cleaned up the rod and had the reel re-conditioned and it's now mounted on my basement wall.
3317993,bigwalleye1,2014-11-19 10:40:00,2632,"July trip to Lac Seul with my dad and another member here, Shackman and his cousin. Fun trip, great guys with the same ideas and attitudes re: helping out, chores, fishing dedication. We had like 3 feet more water than I'd ever seen in the system, so all bets are off re: old spots to fish, shore lunch stops, etc, but the last day on the water found a great bunch of willing biters and slots, some nice overs mixed in, a great nearby lunch spot, beautiful weather, and great company overlaid on all that. Truly one of those days you get every once in a while where the whole plan really comes together, and you kind of pause, just to make sure you get a good solid lock on a memory so you can take it out later and smile."
3318249,jambi,2014-11-19 12:18:00,504,"Early June 2014, accidentally found a little creek coming into the lake, that was tucked in between some rock bluffs. We had drifted by the bluff then heard the water trickling in from the small inflow creek. We were casting for pike and picked up a few. Happened to notice some shiners were schooled up by that warm water coming in. Switched to a jig and casted out away from the bluffs. Sure enough, it was walleye central. This bite was here all week , only in the evenings though, from 8 pm to dark thirty ++. This was a good spot to share with guys that had never caught 18-20"" walleye on every cast."
3318321,Whopper,2014-11-19 12:41:00,340,"June 2, 2014 Spent the day fishing Little Vermilion with Goldeneagle. Hands down one of the best big pike fishing days I've experienced."
3318449,new hips,2014-11-19 13:25:00,498,"I've been fishing all my life, nothing tops my last day on Great Slave Lake. I easily boated 50 Pike myself. Average Pike were 35-43in. the bite was consistent all day long. The last 2 hours of daylight the Pike were on fire as a thunderstorm was approaching, we boated 6 Pike between 40-45in. You couldn't bring them in fast enough. Ended the day with hail lightning and a rainbow, not sure where my next adventure is but.......this day will be hard to top, believe me."
3318737,Gregking,2014-11-19 15:04:00,2658,In September I got to fish with just dad and my two older brothers. I love fishing with my daughters but this is the first time ever it was just the 4 of us. No nagging sister in laws stressing out my brothers. It was also the best fishing I have had. Fish just kept biting all 3 days on witch bay plus got to jig which is my favorite.
3318793,Mike Borger,2014-11-19 15:30:00,1554,"This past year was exceptional, but one day on North Caribou lake with my young son stands out. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dEzQ...pUVlHpLweAwQmA"
3318873,BBogey,2014-11-19 16:07:00,585,"First of all, what a great video Mike! It was so refreshing not to hear dad yelling or running around like a madman making sure the young one didn't lose the fish - what a great memory! Good for you! Hands down my favorite trip in 2014 was fishing with my 5-year old grandson - first time ever it was just him and I. LOL, he ran around (we were camped on my brothers property on the lake) and told everyone that would listen that just him and his papa were going fishing in the morning - the ""real early morning, just me and my papa""... I told my son not to let him wake us up before 6:00 AM. When I looked out the camper window at 6:00 to see if they were up, Wyatt was sitting on the picnic table waving to me! He caught this big ol Burbot (100% on his own) and caught a limit of kok's %100 on his own.http://photos.imageevent.com/bogey/f...ing%20cod_.jpghttp://photos.imageevent.com/bogey/f...%20Kokanee.jpg"
