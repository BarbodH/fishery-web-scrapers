3347402,Gone,2014-12-05 13:26:00,9,"I am looking to take my 13 year old son to Ontario to fish for walleye, small mouth, northern, and see moose and bear. We're on a $1000.00 budget for a week and need a housekeeping unit with boat. We're looking at mid June. Where and with whom would you recommend we talk to? We want to catch fish, not just fish if you know what I mean.Thank you"

3216953,HeHooksHimself,2014-10-02 08:33:00,725,"Hello WC fam, I met the owners of Century Lodge on Eagle Lake and they pretty much convinced me to schedule our fall trip 15 with them. They are a little pricey, but we are interested in the housekeeping option for an extended weekend next Sept. Just wondering if anyone has any experience with them and if the fishing in their secluded area of Eagle Lake is as awesome as they would like me to believe. Thanks in advance. Fish On! Hooks"
3218481,prov1800,2014-10-02 20:09:00,5010,Mhhhh.where have i heard that before.
3218593,bigwillies,2014-10-02 20:44:00,515,guess u know they r on an island.only lodge on that part of the lake which is pretty cool.it's eagle lake so fishing is good.hauling your boat down 10 to 15 miles of dirt roads. just in case u r hauling a 75000 dollar ranger.
3218729,Nimstug,2014-10-02 21:41:00,2605,"Fished there in '98 and '00. It was the first time I fished for eyes and holding to eternal laws, somkewhere inbtween the 10th eye and the 20th was a 30 1/4"". Lots of boats from further north run down to that area, so you are saving some time that would be spent running rather than fishing. Just so you know, the lodge is ""dry."" Sprits are OK in the cabins. Nimstug"
3218897,troutwater,2014-10-03 05:31:00,299,This is the first time I have heard of this. Do they at least let you bring your own? I've been eyeballing Century for quite a while and really want to fish the area.
3220329,jiggster,2014-10-03 15:40:00,183,"We were there many years ago. Fishing was excellent. Our only problem was the owner over charged us by accouple hundred and refused to discuss the bill with us. We paid and called back and talked to the son Randy. He said he would recheck our bill. Shortly after we received a check from from Randy. Randy was great. If the dad is still taking care of the payments, check it over. Then talk with Randy."
3220985,Nimstug,2014-10-03 21:50:00,2605,"Yes, you can bring your own. I suppose you could say you have to bring your own."
3221337,HeHooksHimself,2014-10-04 07:34:00,725,"Thanks for the input. I know some people make their way to Osbourne Bay, but they told me that you have to navigate something called ""the minefield"" in order to get there from other places and that it is difficult without a guide. This is why Osbourne Bay is somewhat secluded. I knew that they did not serve alcohol in their lodge, but like I said, we are more ""housekeeping guys"" and like to do our own thing. We are most interested in good fishing without a scad of other people around. We like to hunt down our own fish so are not too interested in having a guide. The fact that they have wifi available and a big screen TV are not attractive to us, if you know what I mean. We had our first encounter with muskie this fall and that is a bonus for us. We like to troll sometimes so we can eat peanuts and drink, uh, our beverages. It certainly would trim some time off of our trip since Century is one of the most southern lodges in Sunset Country. More input as winter closes in would always be welcome. Thank you my WC friends and family."
3223753,rzep,2014-10-05 12:39:00,1196,"I have been there 5 years ago or so ...with my wife. The cabins were run down and we actually had to move the bed around as the floor was pitched to the side of the bed and whoever was on the low side, end up on the floor the first couple nights. Once we positioned the bed so heads were on the top and feet toward the bottom, all was good. Reason I remember this - wife keeps reminding me every time I am planning fishing trip as she will not settle for such stuff any more. Not sure how this all works - are they leasing the resort from the Nation so there is no incentive to put money in ? It was pretty much the worst cabins situation for us. You are pretty much stuck on the island all the time which was little too much for us. Fishing was good as I caught my first musky right off the shore while practicing my new baitcast setup. Nice 42-44 inch fish. Another smaller one while fishing off the boat for walleyes. Having said so, people who came just to fish for muskies that week, had no much luck from hearing at the dinner. Not big fan of the old man either ... Randy was helpful and accommodating. They do not seem to have the best reputation between the locals. As I was told (next year from local guide), they seem to think that the southern area is their exclusive and if you are not from their lodge - dont run out of gas as they will not help you out. We are not into drinking so I cannot comment on beer situation etc."
3227225,Ferg85,2014-10-07 09:08:00,35,"Our group went to Century several times. Like the others have commented, the cabins are in rough shape. Bring enough beverages for the week. Lodge is dry and you cannot bring it into the Main Lodge-cabins ok. Great location. Fishing is good but it is reachable from other lodges if you have a decent boat. It is possible to go back to town (Dryden), but they will look crooked at you. The water is chocolate milk. Unlike the other parts of Eagle. This does not effect the fishing. Just different. The saugers like it. I guess bottom line is we found better accommodations for less money and we can still get there if we feel like it."
