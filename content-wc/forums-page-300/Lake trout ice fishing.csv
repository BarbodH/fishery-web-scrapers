3329977,BornToFish,2014-11-25 14:18:00,1224,"I love to ice fish for lake trout. There was some great advice offered above. If you decide to go with a bait casting reel, I suggest getting one that does NOT have a thumb bar. My reels have the push button off to the side of the reel - the cheaper ones! I set the hook pretty hard on lakers to make sure the hook sets into the roof of their mouths. I found that I accidentally push the thumb bars during hooksets and opened the reel to free-spool. I lost fish until I went with the push button style Garcia reels. A medium heavy to heavy ice rod is the way to go. St. Croix and Jason Mitchell rods work great for me. I use 50 pound braid with a small swivel to a fluorocarbon leader. I mostly use jigs/spoons around one ounce that have white color schemes. I sometimes go lighter or heavier, depending on whether there is current. I tip my lure with a chunk of cut bait. Tubes work as well - why I don't know. I use a Vexilar with zoom for the bottom six or twelve feet in the water column. I most often jig near the bottom (about one foot off the bottom), but watch up higher in the water column in case active fish are up high. I find that playing ""keep away"" often triggers a bite. By this I mean steadily but slowly coming up off the bottom when a fish is looking but not biting. It seems that they get nervous and make a quick strike to get back to the bottom. Good luck!"
3336066,BenBeattie,2014-11-29 09:41:00,232,"There's some great advice in this thread. Using electronics and fishing the entire water column are the biggest keys. One technique I call 'flashing the column' can draw a lot of attention. Drop your bait to bottom and steadily reel all the way up. Repeat this process several times. Fish will appear anywhere, chase and strike the moving bait. They see it as a fleeing baitfish. I also jig near bottom and watch the fiasher for high flyers. Cat and mouse game with lakers is key. Always get them to chase. Another thing that works is deadsticking a tube jig half way up the water column. Literally let it sit dead still. you'll see a streak on the flasher shoot upâ€¦ before it gets to your bait slowly start reeling for the final take. Also, FWIW on the lakes I fish the biggest lakers always seem to come from 30 -to 50 feet of water. I think a lot of people ignore the shallow water laker bite that can happen during the winter."
3323865,Ron engesether,2014-11-22 11:07:00,46,"I am hoping to try to do some ice fishing lake trout this year on whitefish bay, Lake of the woods. I have no experience in this and not alot of ice fishing experience period? Any tips and methods?"
3323881,Skywagon,2014-11-22 11:18:00,1106,"Tube jig with a minnow, try various depths, keep it moving. Trout are very aggressive, they will often give you numerous chances to hook them if you miss the first time you set the hook. Great winter fun."
3324145,FishinFreaks,2014-11-22 15:55:00,386,Get a rod built for lake trout. Don't go too light. Look at TB rods. TUCR also has one. Clam has a Jason Mitchell rod as well designed for lakers.White tube. Horizontal 3/8 -1/2 oz jig. Flourocarbon 10-12 lb. Use a ball bearing swivel with a 2 foot leader to elminate twist. Jig the entire wire column as fish will take it two feet off the bottom or sometimes are looking 20 feet above them and will zoom up to crush your tube. Jig aggressively and hang on tight.
3324385,Limeyangler,2014-11-22 18:23:00,563,"Get yourself some electronics .by far the best tool for ice fishing, almost mandatory for lakers."
3325873,adempsey,2014-11-23 15:17:00,963,"Definitely this. It lets you know when the fish are checking out your bait and when to start to jig/reel in or drop it down etc.. Of course, you don't NEED it, but it will improve your catch rate a lot.However, a tip-up with a minnow still works great."
3325961,Ron engesether,2014-11-23 16:02:00,46,"I have fl 18 vexlar, going to call thorne bros and order some rods, i assume bait caster reels would be better? What is a guy looking for in picking depths and locations to drill holes"
3326145,adempsey,2014-11-23 17:38:00,963,"I use spinning reels on MH and H rods. Not the crappy ice combo ones, but actual reels. Always worked well for me. Nothing wrong with using a bait caster if that's what you prefer.Depths can be anywhere from 300ft to 50ft [or even less]. Depends on when and where you are. Typically, I'd target 80 to 120 FOW and watch my electronics to see if anything is suspended or if they are hanging out on the bottom. As for locations, I wish I knew, but I slowly gather information from other people and from just trying various spots. If I pick a new spot, or I am on a new lake with no info, the spot I pick will be based on the structural fishing philosophy - humps, underwater points, bottom transitions etc..."
3326209,chris.brock,2014-11-23 18:15:00,112,"I would jig (spoon, tube, swammer) in 70 FOW and have the tip up (minnow) in 35 as a starting point As for picking a spot, some unique structure that is close to a deep basin like the other guys said, electronics is huge and it's a blast watching it and trying to get fish to strike when the sun gets low, switch over to walleye up there"
3326713,Skywagon,2014-11-24 05:31:00,1106,"I use bait caster reels, prefer ones with a line counter, but that is optional. I would stay away from braided line, as it tends to freeze up worse than mono in the temps we normally fish for trout. The Vex will be helpful, have friends that use no electronics and do well, they just have to work at it a little harder. There is no magic depth, but it seems more times than not we end up fishing in 60 ft of water or more. I have fished lakes that are not much more than 50ft in the deepest spot, to one lake that is 550ft, have caught fish or seen fish caught almost on the surface to 175 ft, normally near the bottom is a good place to start."
3326841,FishinFreaks,2014-11-24 07:09:00,386,"I have tried both baitcasting and spinning reels. I prefer baitcasters for free spooling and jigging, but when it comes to fighting the fish, I prefer the spinning reels (and note this - I hate spinning reels when soft water comes). With the spinning reels, I feel I have better control of the rod and less fatigue in the fight. I can't understand why, but the baitcast reel wanted to twist out of my hand like there was torque on the rod. Free spooling with a spinning reel is a little more of a pain, as cold flourocarbon really wants to dump off in clumps rather than naturally pile off. So if you're not really paying attention, you end up with some tangles. On bait, one thing to note on Whitefish Bay - there is no live or dead bait allowed on the bay in the winter. You can't even have it with you.Lastly, I know guys talk about deep - 60+ feet. We buck that trend. I've never fished deeper than 45 feet on Whitefish Bay. We keep talking about going deep, but we catch so many where we fish that we never end up getting to go try the deep water."
