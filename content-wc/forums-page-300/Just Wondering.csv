3321673,mrwalleye5,2014-11-21 06:37:00,1922,"I have been very fortunate in my profession( agriculture) in that I am offered fly in fishing trips on an average of 1 every two years since the early '80's. I can only estimate the price of these trips. The companies that invite us pay for everything, tipping,etc. This year I went to Aiken's Lake Lodge in NE Manitoba, this being my 7th time at this lodge. Estimate it costs around $2,500-$3,000 for 3 days of fishing. I have never paid for a fly in fishing trip. I find it hard to warrant shelling out that kind of cash when I have $50,000 of fishing related equipment sitting at home. But I love the experience."

3355418,bigwalleye1,2014-12-09 11:32:00,2632,"It varies a little for us, since I go from the Twin Cities to sioux Lookout, my other boat travels from Detroit Lakes, and my second boat on the other trip comes from Indiana, but I tell folks to plan on $700 for groceries, food, boat gas, lodging, license and bait."
3355466,NARDA 1,2014-12-09 12:07:00,636,"We have a core group of 4 that goes to Birch Dale Lodge each year.

3355538,phishfearme,2014-12-09 13:31:00,1242,"one week ""quality"" flyins (nice cabin, boats/motors and a private lake - not a lodge/AP) are easily in the $1500 range (including 13% HST) and when you add in travel (+ motels), food, license, booze/beer, tips and other extras you'll be in the $2000 range easily. that's about what we assume each for a one week flyin - and we usually do 10 day trips so we're north of $2200. phish"

3321033,kzoofisher,2014-11-20 17:58:00,5144,"Lately it has been $1000-$1500 depending on how many kids go with me. That's pulling a boat and two adults, the other guy spends a couple hundred less than me. Next year we'll be renting a boat and taking a better mileage vehicle up. Cost will probably be the same. Of course, I'm not counting the price of terminal tackle because that gets spread out and used throughout the year. Something I've been debating with myself is doing a fancier trip or a fly-in. The big question there is: Do I do one more expensive trip or two of the usual drive ins?"
3321065,JAY221,2014-11-20 18:13:00,877,"I would be guessing ,but, I would put it at about 1150.00 ea with food & gas included & tackle excluded. Not like I need any more tackle but you know how that works! Later, Jay"

3321305,port1042,2014-11-20 20:27:00,509,"2 guys, upgraded camp boat -- all expenses including a motel on Friday night, 7 nights at Manotak (housekeeping plan), all travel expenses/meals, groceries, booze/beer, bait and tips. The spring trip is about $1,200 each and a little less in the fall because of a ""fall deal"". Actually, the total cost for 2 trips, 2 guys, (one trip in the spring and one in the fall) comes to about $4,500.00 including every expense, even fishing licenses. My fishing partner is a little anal about keeping track of expenses so I'm sure this is pretty accurate. We pool our money and split everything 50/50. Actually, we play cribbage all year long and contribute all loses to the ""Canada Fund"". Almost all our expenses comes out of this fund. I think I pay the larger share -- but not by much. It will even out eventually but a double skunk last week cost me a lot ($18.00) on one game! I think that has happened 3 times in the last 3 years. Twice to me!"
