3335794,RickOnt,2014-11-29 06:27:00,217,"No problem viewing the video. That's a beautiful thing seeing that ""Big Guy"" swimming away"
3339769,Anonymouse,2014-12-01 14:42:00,834,"A 12"" hemostat is a fish's best friend.Then they don't have to come out of the water at all."
3340481,Guest,2014-12-01 19:48:00,0,"We teach our guests to release any fish they are not keeping or taking a photo of in the water. Hold all fish vertically with two hands. A fish in your livewell, on a stringer or in a basket is considered a dead fish by our local Conservation Officers. Whether released or not those fish are going to die. Therefore you are wasting fish which equals a fine. The livewell rule was put in place for tournament fishing. My pet peeve is we know how to properly hold fish yet all the big time tv anglers and pros still hold fish out with one hand. So why wouldn't the average angler think that was the right way to do things."
3344881,Carnhzkr,2014-12-04 08:16:00,964,Really? Don't you mean horizontally?
3308785,Campcountry,2014-11-15 12:47:00,164,No. Stringers are not illegal in most (if not all lakes) in Ontario and Manitoba.
3308953,SinOrSwim,2014-11-15 13:36:00,1528,"Having a live fish is illegal on Lac Seul. I guess you could put a dead fish on a stringer. But, my guess is most people that are using a stringer are keeping the fish alive. I have no idea on other lakes?"
3308969,kzoofisher,2014-11-15 13:38:00,5144,Right. I think some people get confused because you can release fish if you put them in a 20 gal aerated live well but once they go on a stringer they are part of your limit. And of course on at least one lake you can't have any live fish in the boat.
3309161,roscoe33,2014-11-15 15:25:00,653,"Good, because I do like to put my eater northern on a stringer, and bleed them out. Then they go on ice in the cooler."
3310361,SinOrSwim,2014-11-16 10:10:00,1528,"Out of curiosity, does this cut down the slime that is in the cooler of fish then? I'm not sure there is anything more disgusting than a cooler of fish with all that northern slime in it. I just gagged thinking about it."
3310729,roscoe33,2014-11-16 13:14:00,653,"No, not really. I keep the eyes in a separate livewell or cooler. But putting them on a stringer, and slicing their gills or throat, lets them pump out quite a bit of blood, makes the flesh whiter and reduces the taste that supposedly comes from the blood. Very common to do this with saltwater fish, some guys do it with the salmon on the great lakes as well."
3333794,prov1800,2014-11-27 19:43:00,5010,"I understand wherevyou guys are coming from,iam on the water most days and i try to have my guests try to do everything right.most unguided fisherman basically just dont have a clue on what they should be doingvespecially if they land big fish.usually they are unprepared.but that being said i very rarely ever see a dead fish.if you watchbthe ""pro muskie huntets""you will notice they drag every muskie up into the boat by pulling on a gill thats like hanging them verticle in my book.but how else are you going to do it.my biggest concern for killing fish is late fall fishing.any fish brought up beyong 30 ft that gets put back is going to die, guaranteed. This is a time of the year i see dead fish all over the lakes.theres to many variables going on with saving fish, and its not going to get better.it will for the most part just stay the same."
3333906,sfw1960,2014-11-27 21:16:00,1325,"I caught two 12+ lb. eyes back to back (45min.) in 2007 and they both would have gone back, except when I lifted the 12.4 out of the net a gill raker popped....bloody mess.She's on the wall with a few M.A. plaques near her - but really I wish I would have lifted her differently and sent her back for others to enjoy.....RAS"
3334282,Golden Eagle,2014-11-28 08:36:00,2642,"My fishing success reached a new level in 2004 and I have plenty of photos to prove it. The last few years I've taken very few pike from the water and it's working for me. Most go to my huge net, stay in the water while having the hook removed, then they swim off as the net is lowered.My fish photos are treasures to me, but fish like the way I'm doing it these days. Fishermen have improved their catching ability over the years, but mistreating their catch is a major problem.A short movie of an October 2014 catch is my favorite. Her nose stayed in the water as I removed the jig from her lip. The long, thick beauty swam off slowly as I lowered the net for her release. My new best hold has become no hold at all."
3334522,RickOnt,2014-11-28 11:20:00,217,Connie That's the best way for sure!! I use a Beckman hoop net and rarely need to lift 'em out of the water
3303218,BBogey,2014-11-12 22:49:00,585,"Is it safe to assume a lot (not all, but a lot) of pics you see with someone holding a big fish, is actually a fish that's going to be eaten?"
3303226,roscoe33,2014-11-12 22:54:00,653,"This really is nothing new. Been hearing the same thing for years. Big fish really don't need to be taken out of the water at all. I personally don't need to worry about this, as my skills are severely limited, and don't catch any large fish."
3303794,Carnhzkr,2014-11-13 08:49:00,964,"Slightly different subject, yet related: whenever I'm checking out the websites from Ontario lodges, way too often it seems that the lodge will have a page dedicated to bragging about how they promote C&R, then you go to their photos page and you see some guy on the dock holding up a stringer with a 27"" walleye dangling at the end."
3304345,SinOrSwim,2014-11-13 13:10:00,1528,"I have seen the same thing. Or a lodge that has people holding stringers of fish when stringers are mostly illegal. I guess the fish could be dead and then put on a stringer but not sure anybody would go to that trouble?My guess is they are old photos. Which, then begs the question why are they using old photos."
3304641,kzoofisher,2014-11-13 15:41:00,5144,I have to cut lodges a little slack because we didn't take any fish pictures this year and only one or two the year before. If many guests who release fish do the same thing the lodge doesn't have much to go by. I guess if I want to see fish pictures I should do my part by taking some and sending them to the lodge. If just a small percentage of guests sent in a half dozen pictures the lodge would have enough to update its website and facebook page all year. I'll try but truth is I'm usually in a hurry to get the fish and my line back in the water.
3305841,MrSimon,2014-11-14 06:34:00,922,That is a very good point! Most lodges I go to are practically begging guests to email them good quality pictures of released fish. I am a HUGE fan of Happy Day Lodge ... their web site usually has lots and lots of recent pictures and almost every picture is an on-the-water shot of a released fish.
3305969,AllenW,2014-11-14 07:31:00,11482,"If it's a legal catch I don't see the problem? Few years back I emailed the Ontario DNR (whatever they call themselves) and was told limits there are designed to have fish taken out and keep a level of fish they like to see. Someone doesn't release all his fish they catch doesn't mean their wiping out the fish, contrary to what some here think. Al"
3306537,maddogg,2014-11-14 10:26:00,178,My outfitter won't accept any photos of fish held vertically for his catch and release awards or for posting on his website.
3307209,kzoofisher,2014-11-14 15:25:00,5144,"Even kids learn to handle fish properly when given the chance. This fish spent a total of about 15 seconds out of the water in five second increments, otherwise it was held in the net facing into the current."
3307929,roscoe33,2014-11-15 00:44:00,653,Stringers are illegal?
3302194,Mike Kansas,2014-11-12 12:37:00,1463,"I have been told that when you take a picture of a big fish you should hold it in both hands in a horizontal position in order to give it proper support. If you hold it by its gill in a vertical position that the weight of the fishs internal organs can cause problems for the fish. What is the WC Gangs position on this? Thanks, Mike Kansas"
3302226,wallydave,2014-11-12 12:51:00,2151,"Mike I have heard the same thing! Breezy Point, my Red Lake boat buddy this year quoted a study done on musky mortality,dead muskies were examined are the cause of death was the damage done to internal organs from being held vertically. Good question!"
3302242,Mike Kansas,2014-11-12 13:13:00,1463,"Dave, Thanks for your comment. I knew that if anyone would know about holding BIG FISH it would be YOU. After all I have seen you hold some fish that most of us can only dream about. You are without a doubt the King of Monster Walleye!!! Hope all is well with you and yours. Mike"
3302442,MrSimon,2014-11-12 14:04:00,922,"I've heard the same thing, and try to hold fish horizontally as much as possible. Although I have a hard time believing it makes much difference on small fish. I don't think holding a 12"" walleye vertically would hurt it. Just my opinion though ... I'm not a biologist."
3302562,dhottle,2014-11-12 15:17:00,163,I have seen a 35lb lake trout die instantly from being held vertically for weighing. Snapped it's spine at the neck when it flopped around. I think any larger fish over 15 lbs should only be supported horizontally. The only exception are bass which don't show stress from vertical holds. If you want to weigh bigger fish weigh them in the net or cradle held horizontally & then subtract the weight of the net or cradle.
3302626,v-bay gord,2014-11-12 15:47:00,3168,"Damage to internal organs and spinal damage are the concerns with ""hanging"" a big fish by it's head. As with the lake trout mentioned, I've also seen a musky die due to spinal damage (it swam away but was found dead the next day)."
3302698,kzoofisher,2014-11-12 16:34:00,5144,Here's a site with lots of information on releasing fish. The bibliography and related links have lots of information too and will lead you to sites that have the studies on hooking and temperature related mortality for many species besides trout. http://catch-n-release.org/
3302738,Gregking,2014-11-12 16:39:00,2658,I will have to re-evaluate my holding technique
3302834,packpro,2014-11-12 17:07:00,695,"Hold it firmly by the thickest part, and then release it into the oil.... Seriously, support the belly, quick pic and back in the water, revive as best possible"
3302866,BreezyPoint,2014-11-12 17:35:00,1581,"Rod Ramsell wrote this article for the Next Bite.http://www.thenextbite.tv/articles/h...ge-rod-ramsellImproper holding techniques are not opinion. They are well substantiated. Rod is a retired fisheries biologist and he has done hundreds of autopsies on dead muskies. If you hold the fish vertically, you are likely condemning it to death. The spine was not made to support the fish at that angle.If you think otherwise, you should open your mind and read the article.Rod was the chief architect of the metro area musky program. Frank"
