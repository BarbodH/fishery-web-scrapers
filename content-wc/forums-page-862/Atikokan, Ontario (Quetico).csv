I'm heading up there for the second year in a row July 12th-19th. I promised my fishing partners lots of walleye and hopefully a trophy or two. Other people in the group will be targeting smallmouth, pike, and perch, so any advise would be greatly appreciated. How's the fishing been this year? Where will I find fish. What would you use to catch numbers of fish? Where would you look for a trophy walleye during the time of year (post-spawn?)? What would you throw at her? Thanks!"

Smallmouth was pretty good with numbers and the largest about 3-4 lbs, 19"". I've fished the Atikokan area several (about 10) times on fly-ins and had varying degrees of luck from poor to great. Your questions could take books to answer. Narrow down to some specifics and I'll help if I can."
