532827,Guest,2003-06-24 23:17:00,0,####o We will be heading up in a few weeks and was looking for any recent reports? I was wondering if the fish are in there summer patterns yet and did the May Flies arrive yet? Thanks Jeff
532860,Guest,2003-06-25 14:23:00,0,"Jeff, I just got back last saturday from another great week at Gullrock!! The fishing was very good. We caught good numbers and size to boot. Most of the fish we caught were from 12-18 feet although we caught some in 8 feet and a few down to 20. Most boats were headed to Ranger, Three Sisters area of the lake. We didn't need to burn that much fuel and probably caught just as many eyes!!! The mayflies were beginning to appear by the end of the week. On Friday the fishing slowed a great deal. I don't know if this was because of the mayflies or because of the 4 foot whitecaps we were trying to fish in. :-0 Everyone of the walleyes we cleaned from Tuesday on were chucked full of mayflies though. I am going back on July 4 so I hope the mayflies are done by then. Good luck and have fun!!! Renn"
