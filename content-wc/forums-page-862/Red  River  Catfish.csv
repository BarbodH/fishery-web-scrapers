532831,Guest,2003-06-25 06:24:00,0,We are heading for the Red next week to have at some of those Big Cats. Does anybody have a fishing report on how the bite is and what the hot bait is this year.....Thanks In Advance
532843,Stevie B,2003-06-25 09:22:00,157,I was thinking of possibly doing the same this weekend. I would like to know what is happening aswell. I did pretty good 3-4 weeks ago. But who knows if the fish are acting the same? Fish ON!!
532870,Guest,2003-06-25 17:10:00,0,"We are still picking a few up from shore and what the hot bait is sure to be a matter of debate. We have used sucker, goldeye shrimp and crawlers. A lot of our fish have come on crawlers. Big and small. We have caught 34+"" cat on slip float with a half crawler and a small jig while fishing for goldeye. A full crawler with a heavier jig while fishing for silvers also brought in a 34+"" cat. Some of these crawlers had been in the sun too long and were getting ripe. The thing is all the standard baits seem to work, if one isn't working switch up. The thing about crawlers is you never know what it will be, could be a cat or a drum or a carp or who knows"

I take 9 highway right through Selkirk and continue on that road right to the ""End of Main"" resort. It's not near as busy as down by Lockport and the fishing is just as good. Good dock( cost is $5.00 to launch."
532908,Stevie B,2003-06-26 09:11:00,157,"How do you target these guys? I have only caught one in the Red. I would really like to get into them. You mentioned a small jig, but I would find that something like that would be tough to fish in the current. What else has worked? Fish ON!!"
532918,b8y,2003-06-26 13:04:00,7,"If I read this correctly you are interested in goldeye/mooneye on the Red. If this is the case, we use a slip bobber set anywhere between 12 and 36"" down with either a light jig or a small hook (6-10) with split shot using crawler pieces. For us anyway goldeye north of the locks have been really tough for at least 2 weeks. South of Wpg is a whole different story. Take St. Mary south of perimeter for 13 km and find a feeder creek with current, right at the mouth. We just pounded the goldeye in there on 2 different occassions last week. 15 ma goldeye over 2 evenings. Very few of bait size, most being between 12 and 15"". Those are heading for the smoker. As to fishing in the current we just let it go with the flow trying to maintain some line control so we can pick it up on the take. Small beetle spins also seem to work not bad, spinners did nada. I personally have never caught a mooneye on the red, although I hear people do. More mooneye up at eaglenest, but more of an incidental catch while jigging for eyes either in cabin cut or Jacks hole. No large numbers but a 15"" this year and last year."

532942,Backwater Eddy,2003-06-26 21:31:00,3871,"Red River Report Headwaters & Central Red River Regions June 26 2003. We have been hit with lots of heavy rains over the past week. This has the rivers on the region on the rise and muddy. During Post-spawn this in not such a bad deal really, we should be back targeting hungry cats in force soon. Boating requires a extra degree of caution when heavy rains produce sudden river level changes. Large amounts of debris get washed about and caution is the word of the day. Be prepared for prop hits if you venture out, it will likely happen. Keep your speed down and your eyes open. We should see vastly improved fishing into this next week. Lots of food equals lots of cats. Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson Backwater Guiding Canada Eh! Lower Red River Fishing Report June 26 2003 Cats are aggressive here on the Lower Red mainly due to the slight but excessive flows. Patterns have been as diverse as the species itself. We're finding plenty of active cats working the shallows or in tight to shorelines. In fact if you're willing to put the effort in you can cork those kitties by simply drifting a piece of bait along the shoreline. You should control the speed of the drift by simply holding it back or stopping it for a few seconds from time to time. Then lets resume drifting always being prepared to set the hook when 'ol whiskers chomps down on the bait! Working shallow or tight to shore can also be executed by more conventional means of just casting your presentation on a sliding weight system. When we do this we prefer to work a bait shallow in 2 - 5 feet of water. At the same time we'll cast another bait out into deeper water, this will usually result in telling us if they're deep or shallow. The Red also producing plenty of big fish (cats between 20 & 30 #'s) out in the main river channel. As is always the case when fishing for cats quality bait is an issue. For those that are using fresh quality baits they are the ones enjoying great success. For those that choose not to follow this golden rule, well, they usually come off the water shaking their heads and making remarks on how poor the fishing was. I expect the activity and catch rates to rise on the lower Red along with the rising water levels. As per usual, when the river rises due to excessive rains throughout the valley the cats turn on, ""big time""! Fish ""Hard"" Forever!

532945,b8y,2003-06-26 22:38:00,7,"Just got in from fishing the red north of Lockport. 2 of us in just over 4 hours caught 8 cats 34+"". The largest was 37"". We fishied from shore using slip floats with gobs of crawlers. Not sure how many smaller fish as we only mark and picture those 34+. The bite sure looks to still be on to me!"
