But they have parking for boats and ALOT of fishermen stay there. So you will want to book ahead. As far as fishing goes I can't help you out too much I have only fished there twice. Both times we did great. It was tough to get fish in the boat under the 22"" limit. Bring heavy jigs if the current is high and the wind is coming off the lake then you will be happy you did. 1oz. cannot be too much at times. I'm sure that there are others on this board that can help you out more than myself. Fish ON!!"

Papertown (204) 367-2261 Manitou Lodge - (204) 367-2252 I would easily say I'm a ""regular"" at Pine Falls. If the wind conditions are light, my first plan of attack is long-line trolling crankbaits in Traverse Bay. #8 or #9 Deep Diving Shad Raps (Clown, Fire Tiger and Pearl White) are my go to crankbaits. Jigging at the mouth in the early morning is a common practice here....from sun-up till about 9 a.m., after that get yourself onto the lake. Be wary of NorthWest winds....they'll put the biggest vessel at risk. If you are using a GPS here are a few coordinates that may help...
