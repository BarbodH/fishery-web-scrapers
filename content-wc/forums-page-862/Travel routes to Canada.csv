532856,Guest,2003-06-25 13:37:00,0,I am going to Canada next week staying in an area just north of Thunder Bay. I will be traveling from SE Wisconsin. Can i take highway 61 into Thunder Bay or do i have to go up through International Falls. On highway 53
532890,Guest,2003-06-26 04:56:00,0,"Yes you can take 61 to Thunder Bay. We used to take 61 up along the North Shore. It is very scenic but before construction it was slow. I haven't been up that route since construction finished but that would be your best route if you are going north of Thunder Bay. If you are hooking up with 11/17 west of Thunder Bay, there is a short cut that bypasses Thunder Bay and would save you some time. You would have to look at a map as I have lost my Ontario road maps and can't remember the highway .(Maybe 535??) In checking road construction there is a bit of road construction north of Duluth on 61 but just a width restriction. Good luck."
532904,Guest,2003-06-26 08:14:00,0,IS THERE A BORDER CROSSING ON 61 LIKE THERE IS IN INTERNATIONAL FALLS. IT DOES NOT SHOW ON CANADAS CUSTOMS WEBSITE
532910,Guest,2003-06-26 09:52:00,0,I was up there 3 weeks ago and there were just a couple places on 61 with road construction. There is a customs at Pigeon River when you cross the border either way. Plus if you stop at Rydens (duty free store) they a sheet with the directions for the short cut. The first turn you'd make would be onto 130 and then you have to turn onto some other back roads. But if I were you I'd stay on 130 until you get to 11/17. We took the river road (on the directions from Rydens) and it was dirt. Which wouldn't have been bad except for it was raining and my boat was full of mud inside and out. By the way if you're taking beer and cigarettes buy them at Rydens not at the local grocery store (especially cigarettes). Cases of beer were 10 to 14 (bud and miller) US dollars and cartons of cigarettes were 20 US. You're allowed 1 carton of smokes and one case of beer or 1 litre of liquor duty free.
