532840,Guest,2003-06-25 08:26:00,0,I pushed my annual trip to LOTW back a few weeks hoping for more stable weather and wouldn't you know it.......a cold front is gonna be sweeping through the area (high temp of 55 tomorrow) the day I arrive.........CRAP. Any good tipes for walleye and smallmouth fishing right after a front like this? Thanks

532892,Guest,2003-06-26 05:06:00,0,My experience in Canada has been that the eyes go near cover whether that is weeds or rock or wood after cold fronts but they are also schooled tighter so if you get on them you can usually catch a bunch. I would try live bait on rigs or very light 1/16 oz. jigs or even a slip bobber with a leech. Any flowing water also helps. I know river fish are less affected by fronts. Another thing you could try is at the base of humps or points where the rock transitions to mud. Sometimes the eyes slide off the hump to deeper water. If you have wind hit the windblown shorelines no matter what the conditions. Good luck.

Instead of using a spinner behind a bottom bouncer, try using just a plain hook and leech and a longer leader between the bottom bouncer and leech. Or dump the bottom bouncer and just use split shoot. And give the leech time to do his job. Usually slow is better but not always. Cold fronts can be tough. But there are still fish to be caught. Be flexible and think outside of your normal pattern. This is a chance to try some of the other presentations that we read and hear about all the time. You may not catch as many as when the weather is stable but at least you shouldn't be eating beans and 'taters only for supper. Pooch"
532906,Guest,2003-06-26 08:49:00,0,"Cold fronts put them down, but only for 24 to 48 hours. And, most of the time, closer to 24 hours than to 48 hours. Like some other posts said, during the ""down"" period, use slower and smaller presentations with lighter jigs. The fish usually DON'T change locations, they just go a little deeper. Use your locator ... if you can see them you can catch them. One of the reasons I go on fishing trips for 2 weeks at a time is the weather is so unpredictable. But I have learned that even in cold fronts, a guy can still catch fish. Good luck to you on your future trips. Hang in there."
