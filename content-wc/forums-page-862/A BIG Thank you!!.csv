It was a shock for Ken and myself to receive the orders to get everyone out of camp. So through the tears and the hugging the job got done. But it would never have happened with all the consideration and co-operation of the guests. For all of you die hard fishermen just imagine, after waiting all year and the great trip finally arriving - being told to leave. Many of the guests had just arrived that morning and they all looked so sad. It was great to see guests dumping out their coolers of food so they could use their coolers to pack tackle from my store into. And I had the big boys from the Dan Dehnicke group in packing up the store. They did great - what took me a month to hang up - it took them 10 minutes to get down. Now I just have to untangle all those lures but it sure is great to still have a wall to hang it on. Again, thank you guys for making a hard situation a little more endurable with your kindness and patience. I guess you now know why our ""guests"" are no longer guests but friends!!"
