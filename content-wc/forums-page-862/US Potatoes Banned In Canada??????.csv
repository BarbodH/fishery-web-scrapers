Rather, its simply support for Canada's import laws? How many posters on this board take the ""don't ask - don't tell attitude"" Even though many are aware that US potatoes shouldn't be brought into Canada, they'll bring potatoes along anyway in the hopes that the border authorities won't ask. The same attitude applies for some to leeches. Such bahaviour patterns are simply disrespectful."
532865,Guest,2003-06-25 16:13:00,0,"Many of us find it much easier to buy and pack our food before leaving home. The last thing I want to do after driving ten hours is go grocery shopping and then pack it all into the back of my Jeep. If it's just a bag of spuds, it's not a big deal, but it does make one more stop and depending on your schedule, it can be a hassle. The resorts might consider stocking a few extra bags of spuds for their guests to purchase until this issue passes."
532871,retire55,2003-06-25 17:11:00,1029,"Trailerguy: There you go again jumping to unfounded conclusions. Not that its any of your concern, but I don't live within a 1000 miles of Fort Frances. Nor am I associated with any businesses there. Whether my profile is hidden or not is also none of your concern and your attempt to sow fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) is quite simply very small minded. I reiterate, as in my comment to Eric, that respect for the laws of a nation drives my comments on this thread regardless whether the nation be the USA or Canada."
532873,Guest,2003-06-25 17:44:00,0,We all love it when ignorant morons like you stay home Pigeye.Thanks for that.
532629,Vitreum,2003-06-20 21:19:00,221,"i think we oughta give this one a rest. i was under the impression that you could not take food or plants across the border either way. same for mexico. buy your food and bait up there and avoid all of these problems. these are prudent precautions taken by sovereign nations to protect their agriculture and fisheries. for goodness sakes, you can buy more potatoes than you can lift for 5 bucks. i presume that the same applies in canada. i never take any chances at the border. don't give those guys any reason to shake you down. too much time and money at risk to get into problems with the border cops. that applies going both ways. jmo"
532633,McQ,2003-06-21 05:39:00,615,"Through the course of a year I will travel the States and Canada extensively. It is at the point now where a hotel room in Dallas or Winnipeg is very much the same. My job is to provide information and to promote manufacturers on both sides of the border - I also fish with guests virtually everywhere I travel and for that I am very thankful. It's not uncommon to have 15 or so fishing licenses in my kit. Sharing the boat with another fisherman usually ends up in a lot of story telling and I believe there aren't many stories about the fiascos incurred at border crossings going both ways I haven't heard or personally experienced. To a large extent our problems seem to arise when we don't prepare for our trip properly. What is taken for granted at home can be an issue at the border.I never yet have been torn down or put through a search and this is over a forty year time span. At land crossings I have seen vehicles being torn down and while inside customs buildings have witnessed folks having interviews with immigration officers. We live in the information age, it takes but a few minutes to access government sites to see what the latest concern is. It took a bit of adjustment following 9/11 because the rules changed overnight - customs and immigration people going both ways were enforcing rules now that had been a very low priority in the past. The possibility of WMD's being moved freely around North America is a major issue. Compound that fact with the known hazards that have built up over the years and you start to grasp why certain normal type practices we follow become a headache for us. The potato issue coming into Canada stems from an incident that almost completely wiped out the PEI potato harvest a few years back, potatoes carry a blight that is soil related. While Prince Edward Island is a great distance from NW Ontario and the likelyhood of an infection travelling so far is minor the possibility still exists. Such is the case with anything soil related going both ways across the border, earth carries different compounds that when introduced to a non-native area can wreck havoc. Try to bring a plant into the US from Canada after your next fishing trip like a wild rose for example and you will see what I mean."
532655,Guest,2003-06-22 11:56:00,0,"Just got back from a trip up north. No mention of potatoes at the border, just guns and live bait. Didn't see any sign either. Is this issue being blown out of proportion?"
532665,Guest,2003-06-22 20:51:00,0,Crossed on 6/7 and was asked what the purpose of the potato was? Said for eating and that was ok. Told me if it was to be planted it was to stay in the US. Go figure!
532669,brian1785,2003-06-22 21:08:00,1534,"If they (Canada) are so concerned about a virus, then they need to check every vehicle at the border. I WAS PREPARED and had read up on the regulations about crossing at the border and still got stopped. We also had onions in our bag of groceries and nothing was said. If it is an ""earth"" issue, why weren't onions confiscated? I'd rather have them tell me ""We think you look suspicious so we are going to tear your vehicle apart and search for stuff"" rather than handing me a bag of potatos and saying ""go back over and dump them"" (with a huge smile on his face)."
532676,retire55,2003-06-23 07:30:00,1029,"Eric: With all due respect, it's somewhat difficult to understand your rationale. Your group could just as easily overnight in Fort Frances and then pick up things first thing in the morning. Alternatively, depending on where your final destination is, you will pass through or close to Ontario towns that could provide most supplies you require. Afterall, potatoes are eaten in Canada and beer is drunk here too - kind of regularly actually. As well, check-in times at most resorts are not first thing in the morning. Consequently, there is sufficient time to buy beer or potatoes or whatever (e.g. leeches). Please don't misinterpret my comment. Where you get your supplies is your business. However, to argue that you don't purchase supplies in Canada only because of time constraints is somewhat questionable. How many groups of fishermen would contemplate a weeks fishing trip anywhere without potatoes? Nary a one, I would guess. So Canada has a restriction on the import of potatoes. Big deal! Buy some spuds there. While you're at it, buy some beer, especially if you prefer it."
532719,Guest,2003-06-23 15:21:00,0,"Retire 55, Even if we cross at midnight and stay in Fort Frances we still would get up at 5:30 am and go to the manitou lake system. We pass no towns or stores to buy spuds or anything else. As I said we don't want to wait until 8 or 9am for the safeway to open. As I said in my prior reply we plan our trip carefully and have been doing it for years. Our camp is private with no check in time. As you can see your comments were without merit. We buy 17 barrels of canadian gas per year and propane and lumber and hardware and all sort of supplies for the camp from Canadians. We have just found it easier and more conveniant to bring our perishible supplies with us. Eric"
532721,Guest,2003-06-23 15:34:00,0,The only potato's we ate last week on Lac Seul were in a bag that said 'chips' on it.
532727,Guest,2003-06-23 17:05:00,0,Bring sole into another country is an issue both sides of the border. In this instance it is a soil and virus issue that affects potatoes. It also a border (security) issue.
532734,Trailerguy,2003-06-23 19:18:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b] Retire 55, I've noticed you seem to have a fixation with getting tourists to stop overnight in Fort Francis, apparently to get them to spend money. Also I see you are a registered user who hides his or her profile. What else are you hiding here? You or someone near and dear runs a business in Fort Francis or what?"
532554,Guest,2003-06-19 10:39:00,0,"If you want to call it a ""simple question""...well...that's up to you. However, do you realize how cheap you sound? Why not just bring the entire fridge along...better yet...why not drag your entire house along...that way you won't have to spend one single solitary Canadian penny. Arghhh!!!!"
532555,Guest,2003-06-19 11:23:00,0,Maybe just to make Roy happy I will show up in Canada naked and buy everything I need for my trip after I get there.
532562,Guest,2003-06-19 13:24:00,0,Why are US Potatoes being banned from Canada?
532564,Guest,2003-06-19 13:55:00,0,"You missed the point Roy, so I'll spell in out to you. This website was created for fishermen/women who share the common intrest of walleye fishing to have a forum to come togeather and share information. I asked for information about a restriction that I had read about on another website. I just wanted to know if it was true or not. I didn't ask if anyone thought if I would be cheap if I brought potatoes to Canada. So why not comment on threads that you can add to with your knowledge of walleye fishing rather than make a silly personal attack? Incidently,you can contact Golden Fawn Resort on Lac Suel and ask the owners if they think The Great Guide and his 9 buddies are cheap after we left behind about $6000 in lodging, food, gas and bait a couple weeks ago. TGG"
532571,Guest,2003-06-19 17:31:00,0,"Mr. Guide, You ask if anyone has been turned away at the border for bringing across potatos...do you know how ridiculous that sounds?? I have a pretty good feeling they'll let you in. And to inquire about it in the first place smells of cheapness. That is the point."
532576,Guest,2003-06-19 19:47:00,0,"Roy, It is not that we don't want to spend money in Canada for food etc. Our group plans our trip carefully. We don't want to wait in Fort Francis untill 8 am when the market opens. We usually spend the night in the Falls after an 18 hour drive and cross the border at 5:30 am. The same with beer and liquor. I would prefer Canadian beer but always come through when the crown stores are closed. Lighten up a little, we love Canada and want to vacation up there as much as possible and spend our money in your great land. PS. I never take any fish home, just eat a few for dinner once a week.

532580,brian1785,2003-06-20 00:46:00,1534,"We got turned away and my buddy had to walk back across the border and dump them on the US side. Something about a virus going around in the spuds. Was kinda upset that the lady at the border selling me the spuds didn't mention something about it, or the customs guys on the US side putting up a sign telling us not to take them into Canada. What a waste of an hour."
532602,Guest,2003-06-20 11:10:00,0,"mr(?) bean,are we having a bad month?do you ever have any thing positive to say?"
532626,Guest,2003-06-20 20:48:00,0,"Had the same problem with the potatos. Waited in line for over an hour to get across border, never knew anything about the potatos. They had us turn around (vehicle and all) and throw potatos out and wait another hour in line. Then they checked our crawlers in bedding and claimed to have found specks of dirt so then we walked the crawlers back over two mile and dumped them out (50 dollars worth of cralwers shot) Then got checked and harrassed by warden every day. Never again! They can have there fish and their land. I guess maybe the U.S should start being like canada and drive tourists away. Only explanation they had for the potatos was some sort of virus. I'm going out on a limb here but does anyone else think possibly it has something to do with the americans beginning to call the ""french fries"", ""freedom fries"" because the french wouldn't back us up in the war. Well i do. Didn't ask about carrots or onions or anything else that comes from the same ground as potatos. Every canadian we talked to backs the U.S. with the war. Quote from our resort owner was ""The people of canada do not run the government, and I feel our government has no backbone, we want to be everyones friend until times get rough then we back down."" Now those are words from a canadian not american. Come on now get real. You can have your country."
532628,nemio,2003-06-20 21:07:00,96,Coming in Canada is potatoes and coming in the US is the beef. WOW! this is a dangerous borders!!! And don't forget the leeches and worms. This is incredible. By the way I'm going fishing in the US again tomorrow and I will spend some of my money in the states and I won't move my house and fridge to the other side of the border.
532446,Guest,2003-06-17 13:34:00,0,I was reading a posting on the web-page from Crawford's Resort on Crow Lake in Ontario. The owner was warning his customers not to bring US potatoes into Canada because Canadian customs would tell you to return to the US and dispose of them. I've not seen or heard of the potato ban. Is there any truth to this? Anyone been across the border been asked to leave? TGG
532457,Guest,2003-06-17 15:39:00,0,When we were waiting to clear customs going into Canada some guys were walking bags of potatoes back across the border. But nobody asked us about potatoes and we had 30 lbs of spuds.

532470,Guest,2003-06-17 22:14:00,0,The previous post is not mine. Some moron is posting all over the place using my name.

532472,Guest,2003-06-17 23:50:00,0,when we crossed at baudette 2 weeks ago a sign on the canadian customs office window said no potatoes. when we came back to the u.s. the next week they had to check under the tarp on the boat on the us side at a table by where they were checking us there were a bunch of patotoes laying there. I suppose they were giving them away to whoever was going south.
532488,vikes40for60,2003-06-18 08:23:00,185,Its true. 30 lb bag confiscated at the border. WOW! No spuds!!!!!
532508,Guest,2003-06-18 13:35:00,0,Don't worry guys...Canada sells potatos too!! If you guys can afford $2.99 for a 10 pound bag you should be alright. I mean really...now we're bringing in our own potatos...you guys are as bad as the nightcrawler gang. It's embarrassing.
532512,Guest,2003-06-18 15:13:00,0,I asked a simple question............Yes or No would have been fine. $2.99 in not the issue. The issue is the delay in disposing them that I'm concerned about. I heard that you had the haul them out and reenter. How about sticking to the answering the question and keeping your editorial comments to yourself. EH! TGG
