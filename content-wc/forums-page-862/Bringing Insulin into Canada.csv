One of them is a diabetic. He brought up the question of his insulin and his needles...Can he transport them without a problem or does he need a doctor's note? I greatly appreciate the help. Good luck to all of you on your trips this summer. Jerry"

When going to Canada, you can never have too much documentation. Hope everything goes smoothly and you catch a lot of fish :-)"
