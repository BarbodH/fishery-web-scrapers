Pound the water hard. The seem to ""turn on"" and turn off"" on this lake daily. if you are on the water when the fish are active it can be a real thrill. But they are not going to jump in the boat. Last year the group of four that went up there caught 41 leagals for the week(40""+) largest being 49"". There are some monster fish in there, personally seen one that was pushing in the mid 50lbs. but they or course are very hard to catch. lot's of fish in the 38-42"" class. we're kinda old timers and just threw big bucktails the whole time along with topwaters when permitted. as far as walleye fishing goes we have seen people catch fish in the eveings around the islands in the main lake area, not the narrors. we did get some big smallies too, but that was just by acdident, they hit our bucktails, of course they were pretty big 18""+ since they were hitting such a big bait. One of my favorite stretches of water for muskies is the big weedbed just to the left in front of your camp your staying at(as looking out from camp to water) Wish you best of luck"

There are no northers in the lake, small mouth fishing was pretty good. The walleye fishing was fair at best, an evening bite."
