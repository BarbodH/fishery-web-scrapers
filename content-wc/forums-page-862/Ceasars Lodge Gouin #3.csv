At that time of year the fishing is as great as it can be - you will find fish virtually anywhere you decide to try. One of my favorite methods is to pitch small jigs and grub bodies into shallow water around sand bars and rockpiles. The water is cooling down and the walleye are very active. Your chances for a big northern are also good. The weather is variable and can range from the 50's to the 80's, just be prepared for cooler temps and there isn't much rain at that time although a few years back we flew out in a small blizzard early September, had to fly east about 50 miles to get around it. We'll be going up to the south bay in mid-august for a week of filming and fun at http://www.pointe-aux-dores.com/apropos/about.shtml Mike Jackson out of Chicago, the host of Talking Outdoors on the OSRN radio network is scheduled to join us so there should be some great talk radio about the trip in early September. I'm sure Mike will also be writing articles for the syndicated columns he does."
