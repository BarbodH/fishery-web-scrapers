Not many big ones but we got board of catching 18-20"" walleye and went out looking for bigger ones. Some really good northerns being caught. Found most of the walleye in 20-15' of water, any deeper and they wouldn't bite. Very low water! Lots of rocks, but it gives a guy an idea of what the structure would be if the water was normal. We did manage to get through the river ok. But there are a lot of rocks to avoid. Fish ON!!"

You could find walleyes any time just below the lampry rapids 20-35 ft. jig and leach. Caught many eyes in blind bay 6-12' slip bobber and leach. Finally got my Manitoba Master Angler walleye 28"" also a 25"" and several 21 - 24"". The samllmouth bite was very good. A blast on top water lures. The northerns were all overy mostly small ones. the biggest one 30""-36"" took a jig and leach on 6# line got him up to the boat but then he dived and wraped the line around a stump."

I replied to you on the manitoba board as timeout, it appears that name is already in use here though. Did you stay on the island or at the beach on the mainland? Did you try trolling along the wall by the island campsite and if so how did you make out. Did the area east of the island campsite pan out for you? Were there many boats up and would you have any idea if the water is on the way up yet or not. Thanks."
