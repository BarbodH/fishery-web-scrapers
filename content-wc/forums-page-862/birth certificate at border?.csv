532923,Guest,2003-06-26 15:03:00,0,Leaving for Canada in 10 days. Is there a requirement to have a birth certificate or passport along with driver license to cross the border. Do they ask for these documents?
532925,Guest,2003-06-26 15:26:00,0,"2 forms of ID, both with pictures I believe. They probably won't ask. If you have a passport, bring it as the primary ID. The second will be your drivers license."
532934,fourize,2003-06-26 17:09:00,287,I always take my birth certificate with me but haven't needed it yet.
532936,SoDakMac,2003-06-26 20:03:00,218,"We just returned from Canada today. All they asked for was our driver license - both into and out of Canada. However, to get your GST returned they asked for two forms of photo ID."
532943,ackermannsacre,2003-06-26 21:40:00,196,"Since most of you insist on relying on heresay instead of refering to the Canada Customs Agency I have pasted a qoute from their pamphlet: ""When you enter Canada, a customs officer may ask to see your passport and a valid visa, if one is necessary. If you are a resident or citizen of the United States, you do not need a passport or visa to enter Canada. However, you should carry proof of your citizenship, such as a birth certificate, certificate of citizenship, or naturalization certificate. If you are a naturalized U.S. citizen, you should bring your naturalization certificate. If you are a permanent resident of the U.S. (i.e., you have a green card), you should bring it."""

However if you want to expediate this process, the passport comes in handy. Here's one hint. Don't show your passport on the way back in to the US if you've used the same passport to go to Cuba."
532953,Stillwater,2003-06-27 07:45:00,87,"Bill and Bigfish are right, All you need to get into Canada is a US drivers liscence and a clean life style. To return to the US you may need proof of citizenship, 2 ID's(i.e. Birth Certificate, Passport) Drivers liscence is not proof of citizenship. I got a passport last year, and I brought my Birth Certificate, I wasn't asked for anything. Better to be safe. Who needs a hassle at the border eh? Either going up or coming back. Scott"
532957,Thumper,2003-06-27 08:22:00,133,"You need proof of US citizenship. The easiest way to do that is with a valid DL + Birth Certificate. Now, I've only been asked for that stuff once and I was glad I had it. Getting a birth certificate is usually pretty simple and inexpensive, usually a visit to your county seat/courthouse and $20 is all you need. Why risk messing up your vacation? - Rick"
