During our July trip I am thinking about making the portage to fish smallies, walleyes and lake trout and am wondering if it is worth it. Any info on specific spots would be very welcome. Thanks."

532924,Stillwater,2003-06-26 15:11:00,87,"Cooker, We used to use that portage frequently when it was a little lock, but it was wide open at all times (going back 15 years and up until about 7 years ago) and I understand why they closed it. NO one took care of it and a tremendous amount of fertile water used to flow into Whitefish. My understanding now is that the new portage equipment isn't taken care of any better than the old lock and while you may be able to go from Turtle to Whitefish, when you come back hours later you may not be able to get back. Last year 2 friends of mine spent the night in the boat (17 ft Alumnacraft) at the portage trying to get back to Sabaskong. I would never risk it. I loved fishing Whitefish Bay 1 day out of every trip for Lakers. But, I don't love Whitefish Bay enough to sleep on the shoreline, and once you find out the portage isn't working, it's a long haul back up to Souix Narrows. Scott"
532929,Cooker,2003-06-26 16:00:00,164,"Thanks for the responses. Last year when I was up there I drove to the portage but did not cross. Just looking at it I got the feeling that it was a risky proposition. This helps confirm it. I guess if I ever want to fish Whitefish bad enough, I'll load the boat up, drive around and launch at a ramp over there."
532931,Guest,2003-06-26 16:19:00,0,"Anyone ever make the trip all the way around Aulneau? Up thru Whitefish, across Sunset Channel, down thru Tug Channel, then acroos Little Traverse and into Sabaskong? How long does that take?"
532954,Matches,2003-06-27 07:50:00,236,"I used the portage last Saturday and I would not do it again. Coming back to Sabaskong, I had to use the motor to get it on the ramp because the lake level is lower on the Whitefish side, or the ramp simply does not sit in the water as deep as the Sabaskong side, and that's with a 16 1/2 ft. boat. It's a lot of work unless you have a few guys to help, and it's obvious they do not maintain the equipment. Wait until the lake level comes back up, and if you do get stuck on the Whitefish side, you would have to go to Souix Narrows and find someone to trailer you to Nestor Falls and dump back in there to get back."
532956,Stillwater,2003-06-27 08:02:00,87,"rockpt, A lot longer than it's worth, if you don't know the water you have to do the whole thing at about 5 MPH, by the time you get there it is time to go back. If you want to fish Whitefish Bay, stay on Whitefish, there are many good resorts. Otherwise it's not worth the hassle, we stayed at Split Rock Lodge and going up to Whitefish Bay was a long haul, we always set aside 1 day to do it, our other cabin partners thought we were wasting our time spending that much time commuting. Scott"
532958,Guest,2003-06-27 08:46:00,0,"Stillwater, I wasn't suggesting taking the long route around Aulneau just to fish Whitefish, just wondering if anyone here had made the trip. I've been thinking of taking a day to do that trip just to see the lake. But if the portage isn't working, forget it. We stay in the Miles Bay area and I agree it's a pretty good trip to Whitefish just to fish. Speaking of long trips, last August some of the KBI competitors went from Kenora all the way to Sabaskong before they even wetted a line. I was fishing up by North Island when a bass boat blew thru going about 60 mph."
