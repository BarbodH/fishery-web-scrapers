532960,Guest,2003-06-27 10:01:00,0,Going to the Georgian Bay (Pointe au Baril) one week from now. We have received conflicting reports about the walleye daily limits for this area. Requesting someone to post the true daily limits for walleyes for the above. THANKS!!!

There are probably many other Ontario regulations that you are not aware of if you can't figure out the simple daily limits. The regulation booklets are free both online and hardcopy. Even if there is a problem with interpretation your are more likely to get more understanding from the wildlife officer if you have a copy of the regulations to refer to, rather than saying ""well that's what jibob32 told me on the internet""http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/fishing/gen.html"
