532854,Guest,2003-06-25 12:44:00,0,"Last week I was with two friends at Lake O'Sullivan in Quebec (about 200 miles directly north of Ottawa, and caught AND RELEASED a 34"" inch 'eye. (Pink and white jig in 10-12' of water) It weighed 10 pounds, 10 ounces (I have picures) I highly recommend Lake O'Sullivan Lodge as very reasonable and run by an excellent staff that will help with anything. (I broke a spring on my trailer on the way in and the owner Russell Gagnon hauled us in 25 miles over a gravel raod and then fixed the springs while I fished and only charged me for the parts! I have gone there for years and have never been dissappointed. I'd like to have a replica mount made but I am reluctant to go to one of the guys around Southeastern Pa. because I'm concerned about their lack of experience with walleye and I don't want it looking like a bass. Can anyone recommend a reputable and skilled person? I'm thinking that fellow fisherman in places like Ohio or Minnesota, for example, might know somebody. Any suggestions? Many thanks!"

Here is how to contact him: Bruch's Fish Taxidermy 635 Dellville Rd, Duncannon, PA 17020 Phone: (717) 834-6501 A question before I go. My father and I are looking to book a bear hunt & fishing trip to O'Sullivan. Do you know anything about their bear hunting and do you have any tips on fishing the lake?"
532920,Guest,2003-06-26 13:28:00,0,"Thanks for the tip; I'll check him out and look at his work; hopefully he has done walleye before O'Sullivan does do bear hunts and when I was there two weeks ago the bear hunters were having a field day. That week 5 out of 6 got bears, some bigger than we saw in past years. In the couple weeks before, seven hunters got seven bears, so something must be working. Call Russell Gagnon or his son Stanley through the web site www.osullivanlake.ca or at 819 441-3474. I only know this lake in June conditions but having said that,the lake is best fished by following the wind (!!)and hitting wind blown points, bays and shores. For all the lures I buy ($$$), stick baits (Rapalas)in darker colors or the rainbow trout or the Thinderstick brand (shallow divers)work the best along with jigs: white, pink and chartreuse. Worms are sold at the lodge. They have Lake trout too, either jigging at depths or deadsticking. The lake is 11 miles long and the lodge is in the middle so access is great anywhere. It's a great lake and you'll have fun. Good fishing Thanks Andy"
