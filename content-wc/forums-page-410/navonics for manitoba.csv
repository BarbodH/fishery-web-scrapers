1473944,mrwalleye5,2012-08-12 15:58:00,1922,I have the Navionics Gold 2XG. I have only been out on Lac du Bonnet with it but it is supposed to haVe much more. Few more weeks I will be out on Pine Falls/ Lake Winnipeg. Basically only has eastern MB waters.
1474124,KHedquist,2012-08-13 04:38:00,4367,What lakes are you looking for? Yes there is a chip for Canada in both premium and platinum. Here is a link to it http://www.navionics.com/product/water/plotter-charts If you have a lake that you like some screen shots for yah.
1474372,Burr,2012-08-13 14:16:00,8612,"I got mine last fall when they were first introduced - Primary usage is Lake Winnipeg. Both Pine Falls and South Basin. Are they good? Well, they are heads and shoulders better than anything I've had before, but it's not a 1' contour map either.It provides some general ideas of where depth changes are, and where river channels are located, but do not expect exact foot-for-foot contour accuracy.Spendy too, but Manitoba is a large area."
