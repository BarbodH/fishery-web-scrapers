1457885,41jims,2012-07-05 06:49:00,30,"Good morning everyone, leaving for Eagle Lake in 2 weeks does anyone know how the water levels are? Also I know I have seen discussions on hear before but can't rememmber the results. Is it leagal to use a Alabama rig in Onterio? Thanks"
1458206,v-bay gord,2012-07-05 19:38:00,3168,Water levels are low. Not sure what an Alabama rig is....... Check to make sure the lodge you are going to is still operating... Must be hot in Oklahoma right now..............
1458298,tackleman,2012-07-06 07:05:00,444,"i watched a real fishing show and bob izumi said the alabama rig was legal in ontario but, it had to have only 4 hooks on it"
1459061,41jims,2012-07-08 09:18:00,30,"Thanks for the up date I have been in touch with the lodge owner so we are good on that end. That is the case here with the Alabama rig, at least for this year. The state is going to look at the use of the rig at the end of the year."
1460603,Kevin R,2012-07-12 06:41:00,305,Gord did some lodges on Eagle not open ? Also if fishing Eagle for day do you allow outsiders to pay a boat launch/ parking fee at your camp ? I am thinking about fishing Eagle for a day this summer & not sure about leaving a boat trailer at the public ramp while the rest of the group goes to Dryden or Kenora.
1460685,v-bay gord,2012-07-12 08:58:00,3168,"Kevin, there was a previous thread talking about Bear Trail Lodge, who while they still consider themselves ""operating"", you would need to contact them for alternate accomodations (they are not there, there are no boats, no docks, no power, cabins are stripped, etc.) As far as fishing Eagle for the day, the public ramp at Vermilion Bay would be considered a safe place to leave your vehicle and trailer......there are usually a few there every day. I'm just down the road so pop in and maybe I can give you a few spots to try."
1461029,Kevin R,2012-07-13 07:52:00,305,"I would like to stop in & meet you. My concern was just leaving the trailer at the public launch, but if it can be left without a car that works."
1461038,v-bay gord,2012-07-13 08:14:00,3168,"Kevin.....a trailer on it's own seems to be a tempting target. The public launch is usually pretty safe, but I don't have a problem if you want to put your boat in at the lodge and leave the trailer for the day."
1461925,Kevin R,2012-07-15 20:23:00,305,Thanks Gord should I call first or just stop in will be around the 7th of August.
