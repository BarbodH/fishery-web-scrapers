We did not see or catch many fish on the reefs like we normally do this time of year. We got most of our fish early AM or just before dark in 8 'to 12' of water. My son and a friend of mine went with a local from Minaki trolling reef runners in the river system and got there fish 28' down with line counters. We had a storm on Friday the 3rd and much cooler weather than they had been having. Our biggest fish were a 24"" and a 22"". Lots of 13 and half. The 2 young boys in our group each caught 40"" northerns. The one my son caught swallowed the big spinner so deep it did not make it. I guess I now have a taxidermy bill coming up. He is excited about it and I did not want the fish to go to waste. I hope the fishing is a little better those of you just getting ready to go."
