1098740,Guest,2009-04-20 15:08:00,0,"Anyone ever fished Wapikaimaski lake? There are two outfits that fly to this lake, Kashabowie and Rusty Meyer. From what I could find both are respectable, but I couldn't find anything on this lake in particular. Any info on the quality and quanity of walleye and pike would be appreciated."
1098748,thunderatwork,2009-04-20 15:22:00,79,I'm interested in this lake also. I thought there were more than those two outfitters on this lake. Over the years i've been thru both rusty(six times) and kashabowie(once) and found both to be top notch. however it was to different lakes. Ihope someone responds to your post.

Pretty excited, looks cool, long and narrow lake with a couple possible portage possibilities...I like the fact that it has current from the BrightSands river, looks like you can just boat right in to Harmon Lake? Has anyone ever fished this lake before? Jeez, I'd really appreciate any scraps of knowledge I could have before we go...This will be our first trip using rustymyers. Anyone have experience with them? Looks like a good outfit, cabin and facilities look cool. I always like motors bigger than 9.9hp but what can you do? I got a sweet topo map of the lake. I guess it's impossible to get a depth map of this lake? Anyone know? If you've been here before, please post back something and let me know. I would really appreciate you doing that."
1388769,adempsey,2012-02-02 08:06:00,963,"Looks like a spectacular lake! All those islands and bays, wow!Never been, but I do know that Kashabowie Outposts also has a camp on that lake. Maybe their website has more information.Couldn't find a depth map, but there are some free topo maps at Anglers Atlas. The topo map can help a bit if you're looking for steep drop offs at least.Hope you have a good trip!"
1388785,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-02 08:20:00,1460,"I'm not sure I can help a whole lot here, but I'll kick it off. Wapikimanski is where my first 3 Canadian trips began. It was 40 some years ago so some of the details are lacking so bear with me.Wapikimanski is a great fishery. We used to use only artificials such as rapalas and sonars and did fairly well. We often lamented how good we could have done using live bait. We were rookies and there was no such thing as Walleye Central back then. The north end of the lake is much shallower and is where we would go for pike. I believe that Rusty's camp is on the same site as our old tent camp. I remember 3 main walleye holes. Jgar mentioned Harmon Lake, and there is fast water there and it was possible to get past them, but a portage I wouldn't recommend. But Harmon falls is probably the most classic walleye water on the entire lake. Got fished pretty hard. At that time , there were lots of trees blown over on both sides, very snaggy. Harmon falls is where I caught my first ever fish, so I'll never forget it.The next best spot is a place called The Narrows. Yea, I know every lake has one. It wasn't far from Rusty's camp. Angie will mark this location for you I'm sure. The Narrows was very fertile for catching walleye. Has a great shore lunch rock there. I remember catching lots of walleye right off this rock as the old guys relax. It was here where the local indian who resided on this lake came on us one day and joined us for shore lunch once. One of my cherished memories I'll never forget. This guy's name was Norman Anderson and his camp was toward the north side of the lake situated on the only sand beach on the lake. I'm sure he is probably dead now. He taught us how to use a filleted pike gullet on a spinner or jig. He also showed us that you can use the hard gut from a pike as bait as well. I sure would like to hear back from you guys on the present state of his camp.Not far from the narrows southerly is a spot we called The Four Corners. As the name implies, symentrical land mass with 4 different points. Seemed to have caught bigger fish there.One of my favorite things to do was to portage into a larger inland lake I believe was directly west of Rustys camp. At that time there was a boat stashed that you could use. You would have to carry a motor in. Lots of pike.I hope this very old report helps you fellas out in some way. Wapikimanski will always have a soft spot in my heart."
1389832,castnblast,2012-02-04 16:08:00,111,"Is a great lake, as is harmon and any other lake over 100 km up the Graham Road. KAshabowie and Meyers are the only two outfitters. You won't be disappointed with the quality of the fishery. Lots of walleye and some large pike. You cannot boat from Wap to Harmon, although you can portage or it is possible to line a boat through. If you are staying on Wap, imo, there would be no reason to do the work required to get into Harmon. Harmon has road access and thus, more angling traffic. Harmon is great, but Wap is better. Slayer the Indian trapper cabin on the beach is in poor shape. It is damp and musty and is not used often. The beach is beautiful there and fishing off that point is as good as anywhere on the lake. Have fun jgar, I'm sure you will enjoy the lake. CNN"
1389866,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-04 18:02:00,1460,"Castnblast,Wow, thanks for letting me know about Norman Andersons old camp. First good info I've heard on this topic in a long time. My dad tried to lease it from Norman back then. From my recollection that camp was very solidly built, had the old fashioned ice box with ice house in back. Still remember the cross-cut blades on the windows to deter the bears. Norman would take his canoe to Allenwater to get his supplies. Guess it wasn't easy to whip out and pick up a loaf of bread for the wife. Cast, did you go with an outfitter or is this lake accessible by logging road? Heard the loggers were in there in the 80's. PM me if you need.One year we did pull our boats in to Harmon. Its one of the stories we tell on ourselves every year. We pulled the boat through the rapids and on the other side it was shallow. My dad's friend was not a particularly good motor operator and he conked out the moter on a rock right above the falls. Few seconds later the boat went sideways and was swamped. My brother appraised the situation and dived in after the rope, got it to me and I was able to get the rope to my dad who wrapped it around a tree saving the boat from going over the falls. Some tackle was lost but it could have been real bad. I guess its one of those deals where ya spend too much time and effort to get to the other side just to find out that the grass is not necessarily greener, I mean the fish are not hungrier on the othe side. Thanks for letting me reminisce."
1390170,jgar1865,2012-02-05 14:24:00,14,"Thanks for sharing all the great information. Uh, doesnt sound like there's any reason to risk going through Harmon Falls to get to Harmon Lake! Except to fish the falls that is. Good to know. I'm pretty sure I've identified ""The Narrows"". Yes, looks great, its now circled on my map. Might have identified the portage lake referenced. North of the camp, almost within a huge island, there's a lake we've come to call ""Island Lake"". Might have to try to get there just for the adventure of it! Sounds like the northern part of lake is more shallow and good for Northerns. I suppose their are weedbeds up there? Wish I knew where some sunken island humps are located. Maybe the outfitter will mark them for me...I'll look for the old Indian trapper cabin. And be sure o fish the point near it. Can't wait for this trip!"
1406723,jgar1865,2012-03-13 21:32:00,14,"Thanks to you guys who responded on lake wapikaimaski. I got one question, may seem like a stupid one but here goes...Is there any way while i'm at this remote canadian lake than I can access the daily/future weather report? Of course I get 5 day forecasts right before I fly-in, but you know how weather can change quickly...Sure, I look at the sky, but it'd be nice to know while i was actually there if there was a 95% chance of rain the next day...maybe I wouldnt schedule a portage or long trip...Or knowing which way the predominant wind was blowing would be helpful...So, is there some type of product that will allow me the weather forecasts while I'm actually at the fly-in lake? Or is this just a pipe dream? I don't think my cell phone is going to work (it hasn't on fly-ins in the past...) but is there something else I could bring to tap into like the internet or radio that will give me daily weather forecasts? Anyone have ideas or should I just be happy I'm in a place where I can't access anything?"
1407031,castnblast,2012-03-14 15:04:00,111,"Good question jgar, sometimes too much info can take away from the adventure aspect of a trip. I'd look at the long range before I jumped on the plane and go with it. You'll have a great time!"
1407312,HeHooksHimself,2012-03-15 08:16:00,725,"I gotta agree with castnblast here. Sometimes dealing with the rapidly changing elements is part of the charm. We have many stories grappling with and surviving the elements. We like the unknown and dealing with the unexpected. Maybe that's why we we've never hired a guide or gone the American plan (besides, we're cheap). ****, if i wanted it that planned out I would book a tour. But, that's just my opinion."
1474085,jgar1865,2012-08-12 21:49:00,14,"We had a great fishing trip to Wapikaimaski out of rustymyers.com. 1 of the boat was a 16', all others 14'. 9.9 hp motors which ran excellently. Cabin was very nice, huge deck overlooking lake, big screened in porch where regridgerators were. Big living room and kitchen with couch/chairs, 3 bedrooms. Hot water showers and in the kitchen sink. Fishing was generally great. Caught lots and lots of walleyes. Went with brother, Mom, and Dad. Never ate anything but walleye for lunch or dinner. Biggest walleye was 26 1/2"" caught by dad. I caught a 26"", my brother the same, and mom a 2 footer. Biggest northern was 28"" although we did not fish for them but couple hours one afternoon in which we caught more walleyes than northern. No small northern to bother us, either. Castnblast, pikeslayer definelhy gave good advice. Trapper cabin point was an awesome place to fish. There was 2 cabins there, the original which is a pile of ruins, and then what I think was an outpost cabin back in the 50's/60's which did have the big spikes on the windows to avoid the bears. Narrows was a great fishing location with the current. Caught a lot of fish at Harmon Falls but yes that is a snaggy son of a *****...Would definetly recommend this trip for someone else. It was very hot the week we went. Temps in the upper 80's. We jumped into that lake off the dock a lot of times...fish found mostly 18-22 ft deep. had 2 very brief rainstorms and that was it."
1474232,Pikeslayer8,2012-08-13 09:13:00,1460,"Nice report Jgar. Glad that you had a great time with your parents and your bro. In later years this trip will be so valuable for the memories. Did ya get any pictures of the old Indian camp? I sure would love to see them if you did. Did ya scout out the inland lake at all? Did ya have any shore lunches? The narrows was where we liked to have them. Also, congrats on all those +26"" walleye. Always a good fish!"
1390180,castnblast,2012-02-05 14:48:00,111,"Pikeslayer the cabin was built very well, although time, weather and a lack of maintenance has taken it's toll. The spikes in the sills are pretty cool. That is common practice in the north. One late fall trip my brother had to fire up the big wood stove and hunker down as a big front rolled through. Im sure I have photos of the cabin. If I can dig them up, I'll email you. Wap is a remote fly in lake and road restrictions are in place to maintain a quality experience for those those utilizing outfitter services. Although there is an old road that approaches the lake, it is illegal to access by motorized vehicle. The OMNR does allow access to the lake via traditional means such as portaging through adjacent lakes. I have not been in with an outfitter. Nice country up there. Cnb"
1390226,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-05 16:38:00,1460,"Jgar,The inland lake portage was marked by blase on tree. I'm guessin its been remarked a time or two in the last 37 years. I'm sure Angie or the bush pilots can mark your map as well. Make sure you have a gps. That lake can get confusing. I am excited about your trip. Could you take some pictures of the indian camp for me? I would very much appreciate it.

Love that story of your brother hunkerin down there!I know my group just assumed that once the road was in there, one would have access. Thanks for enlightening us on that.Tight lines both of ya."
