As usual look for the points, humps and we even did well drifiting over a 4ft deep sand saddle between two points of land on hot sunny day. We only ever use jigs for baits while on our fly ins, white and yellow bodies have always done well for us. The camp is nothing fancy but it was a place to sleep and it kept us dry. There is another private camp on the lake but we never saw anyone else there on our trip. There was more than enough fish caught to keep us entertained and fed during our trip."
1473850,canufish,2012-08-12 09:54:00,16,Hey there Smokey thanks for the advice i have been flying in to shawmeere lake the last two years with Air Ivanhoe but could not get in on the dates i had requested so katagi it is i am sure we will do well we have always had great trips with Ivanhoe they run a top notch operation and yes i agree with using jigs that is all we ever use on our fly in trips with great success just wondering what are some of the outfitters that you have been using over the years and have you been back to ivanhoe since 97. Thanks again Mitch....

I have fished with quite a few outfitters over my years as we like to try new areas and lakes each year for the adventure. You'll do well on most fly in lakes the only things that has ever shut us out of fish has been the weather and of course we can't control it so we just try harder. For fly-ins i've been with. Lakeland Airways out of Temagami 3 times Elliott Lake Fishland camps (now owned by someone else) Hearst Air Hawk Air Leuenbergers 10 times Air Dale Lee Cole Fly Ins ( no longer in business) John Theriault (no longer in Business) Katagi Lake and McGowan lake owned by the company from gogama that i can't recall name of now I've also been to numerous back country drive to lakes and camped on crown land with some great sucess."
