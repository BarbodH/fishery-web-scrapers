Do you jig'em or Troll'em? What techniques work best up there? What are the water conditions like in this area at this time of year? Are Smallies an option? Also, I may spend some time fishing Muskies. What patterns would be best to focus on at this time?ThanksBrian"

If they top out between 10 and 20' it is a good bet that there will be fish on them. Good spot to start looking is around 25' but sometimes the fish can be fairly deep. A good sonar is a must. If you don't see fish, keep moving. GPS plotter will also really help because many of the best humps are well away from shore and difficult to find without GPS. Personally I would work the walleye in the heat of the day. This is a jig bite. I know other things may work but as they say, when it Rome...Nice thing about LOW is the fact that the walleye bite is not limited to low light conditions. Work the muskies as the sun starts to set with topwaters. Muskies will be orienting to the rocks in August. Lots of LOW musky patterns on other sites. Main lake points are a good starting point in August."
