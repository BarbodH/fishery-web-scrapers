1473479,jimmie,2012-08-11 01:05:00,123,"I began on Eagle in 1970 with family then migrated to the Sioux Lookout area after divorce and fished Eagle and lac Seul alone since 1998. There are so many bodies of water near Sioux Lookout. The rewards of fishing alone are being one with nature. The downside is being nearly a part of nature should bad weather or winds come out of nowhere. It would be nice to have a fishin' buudy male or female or even family. The solitude of being alone just you and God in the great ouitdoors can be relaxing. However, if you are going into untried waters of any size it does not hurt to keep an eye out or go along with someone who knows where they are going. If you private email by Saturday 8/11/2012 I can tell you where we might meet up if interested in Lac Seul. I am planning to head up Sunday. I'll offer what help I can for either place but would be glad to show you around Lac Seul area if you like to get you started. You will not live ong enough to fish all the good places on Lac Seul. Sioux Lookout area in particular. Jimmie"
1474272,Dabluz,2012-08-13 10:39:00,350,"I'm surprised to see that most of the conversation concerns large bodies of water, guides, outfitters or campgrounds. I'm surprised to not see anyone mention wilderness camping and going solo. This is the cheapest way. It's also the most rewarding way too. If you want to be certain about catching fish, just ask and anyone who knows the area where you would like to go will give you great info.I love going solo for wilderness camping/fishing. I either use my canoe or my 14 foot aluminum boat....depending on the size of the waters I want to fish.Big water and big boats does bring to my mind group fishing and I have done a good share of this when I was young but now, I like to be able to decide the whats, wheres, whys and hows. I like to make my meals when I feel like eating. I feel that I have accomplished something when my little trip is completed without a hitch."
1474445,Rivratz,2012-08-13 17:38:00,105,"Regarding camping out and the real wilderness feeling that comes with camping out solo, or with a few friends. I have done it very year except this year. I would get a cabin for a few days after I arrive, and then spend the rest of my trip camped out. That was my initial plan this year. I realized this year after spending time in the cabin that I liked the convenience of the kitchen and bathroom. Even though I truly missed the loons calling at night, and the peace and quiet being camped out. I like to stay out until dark every night until the skeeters are just hammering me. Coming back to a cabin with a hot shower, and a fridge & stove was more enjoyable than going back to the camp and in the tent. I hated to admit it but, I realized this year I'm getting too old to camp for two or three weeks. I brought all of my camping gear, but, it all stayed in the truck. I did visit my camp spot that I have been going to since 1972 a couple of times. All the fond memories of years past! Since I sleep like a rock after a long day on the water, it was nice to wake up to the bathroom, (no skeeter bites on the nuts, sausage & buns) and the kitchen conveniences before I set out that morning. I know, what a WUSSSSSYYYYYY!!!! Do you realize that with all of the shoreline miles out there, that there are only a few ideal places to safely dock your boat (in case of storms) and perfect tenting areas, I was fortunate enough to find an island that has a protected sandy garage for the boat, and a great area about 15 ft. above the water, to put up a few tents. It even has a back side to dock boats that is protected also. Can't find that if your on new waters. Actually, I have been looking for years, and haven't found anything that compares to it."
1474483,drlee,2012-08-13 19:02:00,409,"I have posted on this issue earlier and in some detail. But, a brief comment. I am 67 years old. I have a 17' boat with an 84"" width. I fish a 10,000 acre lake alone sometimes for a period of two solid weeks. I tell the hosts where I intend to fish during any given day. (to be honest, I cheat sometimes) I have survival gear in my boat...blankets, water, first aid kit, tarp, matches, etc. I am not one bit scared of having to spend the night out on the lake or on an island. (of course, I would prefer the comfortable bed in my cabin) I ALWAYS wear my life jacket when I am alone. That would be, ALWAYS. Could I come up with a scenario where I could still get in trouble? sure. But, I am not a big believer in rare events. Also, ask yourself this question...If I (you) had another person with you, and you got stuck out on the lake, would that make a significant difference? Other than someone to talk to, our better yet, a gorgeous female companion, I can't think of a problem another would solve for me. And, in all honesty, I think Gerry and Ryan would come out and find me. I am not making light of this question...I am more careful when I fish alone. Good fishin'"
1470399,ifish267,2012-08-04 07:24:00,253,"Illineye,its none of my business but why go alone,especially for the first time. There's a guy on share a seat trying to put together a new group and only has one response so far. I never understood why guys don't use share a seat more. Theres alo't of good guys out there that have lost fishing friends for one reason or another.My long time fishing partner had kids later in life and now doesn't have time for anything."
1470421,wallydave,2012-08-04 08:15:00,2151,"I posted on share a seat too. My group is not going next year, so my wife is going with me. She doesn't fish but she will go out in the boat, more for exploring and site-seeing than fishing. I will try some trolling with these outings. We will on Lac Seul, Goose Bay Camp in mid June. I have been fished LS on ten trips. If your up there that week, we could try our luck!?"
1470440,ohiojmj,2012-08-04 09:12:00,1262,"One might also assume that he prefers to do a solo. I've never done one, but with my kids in their mid-20's and my middle aged fishing buddies often with have a reason to not go, I may go for it and would have no fear since I've always gone to Canada prepared like a boy scout. I'd recommend overnight provisions in boat, spare prop, tolls, leaving your daily plan with someone you can trust, wear pfd, etc. Search previous solo trip posts. Good luck, enjoy the solitude, fishing, being your own boss, or whatever motivates your solo."
1470461,octanehi5,2012-08-04 09:52:00,1104,"You may want to do this on a lake that has alot of people on it for safty reasons, I would not do it on a fly in remote trip, just not safe. Murffies law prevails, If it can go wrong it will."
1470489,Golden Eagle,2012-08-04 11:43:00,2642,"illineye, sent you a PM. Might be exactly what you're looking for in a good fishery, practically to yourself. Probably only 2 boats on the water, including yours."
1470769,Guest,2012-08-05 09:43:00,0,"I spend four to six weeks each summer in the areas you're considering, both with friends and solo. The solo trips are really enjoyable and have qualities that can not be emulated on the other trips. Given the choice, I'd go solo more frequently, but as you may find it's nice to have people along to share the gas bill. Just bring a bunch of cash, a few extra props, emergency supplies, and an adventurous spirit."
1471185,Cash,2012-08-06 08:42:00,73,"I did a solo trip last Sept and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I went to Minnetaki, a lake that I know well. Seems to me that it would be safer to go to a lake that you had been to before. Take a GPS. I'm thinking about doing it again this Sept."
1471202,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-06 09:06:00,235,There was once a guy at our fly in outfitter who used to do 12 day trips by himself to remote outpost camps. He later worked there as a dock hand in a sort of late life crisis (divorced and retired).
1471379,oldschooltiller,2012-08-06 15:49:00,515,"Depends on the personality I would imagine. Me personally I NEED time to my self like this.I can't think of anything I'd enjoy more than being in the boat by myself to fish in a remote area.One of the pluses for me when fishing alone. My head is always concentrated and clear. I fish much better alone as I'm able to make decisions to catch more fish throughout the day, much more easily. And lets face it, boat control for one guy is infinitely easier compared to setting up your boat for another guy too."
1471462,Rivratz,2012-08-06 19:19:00,105,"Especially to an area you have never been to before, definitely invest in a local guide the first or second day. A local guide will put you on fish, and help you with what works on that specific lake. If you have a hand held GPS, all the better. The guide should not have a problem with you marking spots. That should help you have fun the rest of the week catching fish. Reserve the guide with the lodge owner before you arrive, as they could be booked up. Make sure the guide takes you to at least 10 or more hot spots. The more the better. Hopefully, they are some of his secret hot spots. If you do get a good guide, and have a 30 plus fish day, not including his, tip him well. At least $50.00. The tip should depend on how many fish you catch that day. Just like you would tip at a restaurant. The better the service, the better the tip. It seems expensive, but, well worth it especially if it helps you catch fish the rest of your trip. Not knowing the waters, hot spots, dangerous shallow reefs, etc. are the best reasons I can think of to invest in a local guide to insure you have a great week on the water."
1469700,illineye,2012-08-02 14:28:00,3,I am considering going to either eagle or lac seul by myself (haven't ever fished either one). Has anyone done this before and how did you like it? Any pointers or tips? Which lake/resort would be better for a lone person?
1469725,wallydave,2012-08-02 15:02:00,2151,"Several threads along this line have been discussed, try the search function, you'll be able to find the threads! My wife will be going with me next year, she doesn't fish, but she will go out in the boat, part of the day. I can see some solo morning trips, followed by some afternoon boating/trolling and exploring trips.My only concern is for safety, I have some new walkies, that will help me keep in touch with her at the cabin. If I was to go completely solo, I would let the camp owner my plans or give them the other walkie! If you need some real quiet time on the lake, going solo would do it! The only question is who is going to hear the ""fish tails""??"
1469726,JayM5209,2012-08-02 15:05:00,1050,"'eye, there have been several threads in the past about doing solo trips. Use the search function (you'll see the button above) and do a search for ""solo trip"", ""going alone,"" etc. You'll get lots of good suggestions, opinions, ideas."

1469773,KSauers,2012-08-02 16:37:00,385,"I've done Canada solo a few times. Is this your first time? I would be tough for me but I'm just an average fisherman. I've been to Minaki numerous times and have no problem going alone. Done it the last 2 years. If you go to Eagle I'd go to Andy Myers. Get a guide a couple of times,shoot the crap with the guides. If you go eye fishing with the guides you'll be very successful. Then you can venture out on your own. Knowing a few good spots. Musky fishing I think Eagle is tougher than Minaki solo for a first timer. i used to think going alone would be tough but I rather enjoy it. Go where your want ,when you want,how you want, and fish for what you want."
1469845,Golden Eagle,2012-08-02 18:45:00,2642,"Only 1 boat on a good lake works for me, especially in early October. I do it about 2 out of 3 years. I also make 2 or 3 trips with a pretty good sized group. That works also."
1469925,BennieS,2012-08-02 22:16:00,108,I'm going alone in September . Here's the thread where I was given some excellent advice.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=198549
1470265,phishfearme,2012-08-03 17:38:00,1242,"welcome to the best canadian fishing web site there is - in spite of postings by tooski. EXCELLECT handle by the way! best one since ""beer slayer"". i've done some solo fishing - my advice? - get a partner, even if it's someone from cleveland. you just can't fish 24 hrs a day so it's more enjoyable to shoot the breeze over a fresh walleye dinner and a canadian sunset with another brain. and, if you find someone to go to the great white north with, recognize that you already have something in common - regardless of your political views! phish"
1470267,tooski,2012-08-03 17:44:00,393,My advice is take someone else to split the costs with. And if you make the right choice and choose someone like Phish it will be like fishing alone anyhow...
