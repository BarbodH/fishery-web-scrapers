1471477,houndog,2012-08-06 19:46:00,365,Thanks everyone! I've secured bait and the cuban will merely be icing on a great trip on Lac Seul!

1471770,RapShad,2012-08-07 11:49:00,76,I love those slimy black critters! Can't imagine how many walleyes and bass we've caught on them.
1473466,jimmie,2012-08-10 22:26:00,123,Yes is aggrevating as the owners live next door but almost always seem to be at home instead of work. Generraly a good bait shop though. Both Al' s and Ojibway had problems getting crawlers in good shape during the hot weather. Remeber your worms from the US must be in a paper non-dirt or non woody fiber type bedding. Brown Bear Bait worm bedding is okay. Walmart and most sporting goods shops.
1473536,Radnine,2012-08-11 07:32:00,141,"I just paid $6.00 a dozen for leeches in central Ontario (Cameron Lake, Kawarthas) which is a very expensive way of feeding bass and walleye. Yes it caught both, but dang man!I switched to Gulp leeches (3"") and they still got hit really well (drop shotting)Jim"
1470947,houndog,2012-08-05 17:33:00,365,I'm looking for a good bait shop in Sioux Lookout. I'm taking crawlers accross but need to find leeches. Does anyone know of a good bait shop?I'm also looking for a few cuban cigars. Any help will be appreciated greatly!houndog
1471029,scar,2012-08-05 19:55:00,196,Als Sport shop in downtown Sioux Lookout and JD Baits is on the highway coming into town about 6 miles out. I have been to both and they are both good. Ojibway baits is about 3 miles out but good luck there as there always seems to be a locked door with a sign saying be back soon on the door.
1471092,Skiball,2012-08-05 22:55:00,82,"We use JD baits as well and are very satisfied. JD 807-737-2980 ask for Deb. They also have great minnows, probably the best I've seen in 20 yrs.Skiball"
1471130,tv4fish,2012-08-06 06:47:00,2694,houndog: Which route do you take up/into Sioux Lookout? There is a cigar shop on the way from I-falls up to Sioux....
1471135,houndog,2012-08-06 07:13:00,365,We'll be coming from International Falls. Thanks!
1471199,ScottL,2012-08-06 09:04:00,733,"The Can-op store in Fort Frances right next to the Harbourage resteraunt has Cuban's in a locked case right next to the counter. I don't know if J&D baits has leeches or not they do have great minnows and also have crawlers if you should run out. I would definately call her and check in advance. If she doesn't have any she can probably get some for you. I do know that Al's in downtown Sioux Lookout only has minnows, no leeches and no crawlers. They don't open until 8:00AM on weekdays, 9:00AM on Saturdays and are closed on Sundays. That town could really use a Sportsman friendly Bait/Gas/Convenience store. Last year we picked up leeches somewhere between J&D bait and town. Can't remember the place, but we also got our Deception Bay parking permit there. This year we got our permits at Al's and never did buy any leeches. Didn't need them or the crawlers it was a great minnow bite."
1471240,Mudpuippy,2012-08-06 10:36:00,23,"If you go through Fort Francis toward Dryden, about 15 miles out of FF you will see a big store and gas station on your left, they have everything you need. Good Luck"
1471275,Skywagon,2012-08-06 12:07:00,1106,"Fas Gas/Tony's Bait and Tackle, (first gas station at the stop light after you cross the mill bridge coming into Dryden from 502) always has leeches, I get them from there all summer long. They also have license if you need. Their phone number is 807-223-2113. As was mentioned, bait shops get a little sketchy in Sioux Lookout."
1471344,nitrodude,2012-08-06 14:44:00,60,"I believe this is The Great Bear Shell station referenced. Good selection of cigars and tons of tackle and snacks. JD's as mentioned on left heading up has great bait and wonderful, friendly service just before Sioux Lookout about 3-4 miles before the bridge over Frog Rapids."
1471349,RapShad,2012-08-06 14:50:00,76,"JD Baits has leeches, without their leeches this past year it would have been a long slow trip."
