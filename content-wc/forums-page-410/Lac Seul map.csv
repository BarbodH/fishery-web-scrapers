1472352,cspierings,2012-08-08 14:47:00,230,I don't have the latest greatest navionics chip if it has released an update for that part of Canada in the last year or so. I have fished the west side of LS numerous times and I would tell you to take what the chip says with a bit of salt. Being an impoundment the depths fluctuate. I also have found places in Sawmill Bay up past the sanctuary and a few other areas where we catcha lot of fish at times of the year which according to the Navionics chip I have are dry land and on dry land by some distance. So don't count on the chip to keep you off the rocks.

I was quite surprised that they produce them. As to your question about Lac Seul...I have a map from CMS of the western portion of Lac Seul. It is rather large and actually has been marked up a bit with places to try fishing...the marking was done by a couple of guys who have been fishing out of Lac Seul Lodge for many years. If you would send me your mailing address, I will mail the map to you...I have an extra of the same area, so no payment is requested. Just consider it a courtesy."
