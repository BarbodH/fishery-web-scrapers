Seems like they have some discounted fishing trips in July. Although I'm looking to go in August some time, maybe they will have some deals later, not now according to their site. Anyway, my question is, Does anyone have any info on Hidden Bay. Has any one gone fishing with them in the past? Would you recommend them? I like the fact that they supply the food at the outpost and they give the group a free nights stay at their lodge, included in their rate. thanks for any help! Bill"

They run a great operation. Great fishing. Great accommodations! They give you loads of food, you wont go hungry. The lady who runs the place, Bonnie I think is her name, does a great job. She bakes all the pies too. The pilots are fantastic! Shaggy was our pilot and he ran around the cabin checking the propane and things. Making sure everything was up to snuff before he flew away. They even flew us in a half day early because no one was at the lake. They even have internet at the cabin! They treated us very very well! Seriously, book with them. You will not be disappointed! Anyone else reading this can find Hidden Bay at www.hiddenbay.com Check them out. We are counting down the days to fish with them again in August. Cant wait!"

Go twice each year--Armit in the spring and Miniss in the fall... Great fishing and great facilities. but more important great experience for great value. Always the highlight of my summers!"

Just wondering if anyone has fished both the Hidden Bay Lodge lakes and the Nestor Falls outposts (particularly Larus and Clear, the two lakes I go to) and could make comparisons. Always looking for a possible new place to try! Thanks for any info."
1468458,wallydave,2012-07-31 08:00:00,2151,"Interesting thread! I have watched Hidden Bay and their discounted trips for a couple of years now. It seems that it is a waiting game, if they put the discounts out too early they may end up ""giving trips away"" my words. One the other hand, filling boats, even at a discount, will help the bottom line, plus I have seen some excellent reports about the fishing and how well Hidden Bay takes care of their guests. Good reports will mead more interest in their operation, which means more business! I for one would like to give Hidden Bay a try, its just a matter of getting enough folks to make the commitment!!"
1474116,Guest,2012-08-13 01:55:00,0,The Boys and I just returned from our annual Hidden Bay adventure! I didn't think the fishing could get any better but we were wowed once again. This was our 3rd year in a row now with Hidden Bay and we have nothing but praise for these guys. Vonnie and her crew make everything worry free for us. They take care of everything! Thanks for the great times Vonnie. See you next year! JR
