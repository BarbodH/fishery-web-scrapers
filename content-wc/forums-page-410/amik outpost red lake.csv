1472481,rommel,2012-08-08 19:27:00,369,I was wondering if anyone has any experience with amik outpost. Were trying to plan a trip In the red lake area next July/aug Any info would be appreciated.
1472544,Golden Eagle,2012-08-08 21:52:00,2642,I've fished Cobham River Outpost several times. A great fishery for walleyes and not bad at all for pike. Fished Cobham before Amik owned it.
1472702,Jig Man,2012-08-09 09:14:00,95,"Fished Vee Lake a few years back. Good fishing and good lake. My only word of caution is do not be over weight. I am on vacation spending hard earned money and do not appreciate being *****ed at for 2 hours even though we paid extra for our overwight and confirmed it with them numerous times in advance. Wanted to take our $8,000 and go somewhere else. There problem is they do not make any mid week flights to replenish the cabins with camp supplies. They fly in all the gas and propaine on your flight in which leave no room for any extra weight.http://www.canadianflyinfishing.com/weight-allowances/ Life is to short and there are too many other lakes with accomodating outfitters."
1472875,phishfearme,2012-08-09 16:15:00,1242,"ok - i guess you didn't specify how many dozens of people are in your boat to acheive 300 to 400 walleye per day - but assuming 2 people - this would be about 150 to 200 walleye per day per person. not at all likely. AND - ""a few less at cherrington but AVERAGE 23inches"" is pure BS. posts like this just floor me. phish"
1472999,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-09 19:48:00,235,"My thoughts exactly. Way to create unrealistic expectations. You actually do Amik a disservice by posting this garbage. If you fished for 8 hours, 150 walleyes would be nearly 19 walleyes per hour per person the whole time. That's a walleye boated every three minutes or so. 200 would be a walleye boated every 2.4 minutes. And this has to include time to motor to new spots, bait your hook, snap a photo, reposition the boat, remove deep hooks, stringer up your keepers.....sorry dude, there's just no way. And don't even get me started on the 23 inch average....when you talk about average, that's supposed to reflect the trip as a whole, not some amazing hour that happened once on the trip."

The guy is trying to share his experience. And come on, his 150/person/day is hardly something unattainable. I've caught that many in one hour. I liked your post, Redleg. Keep em coming!"
