1469947,Limeyangler,2012-08-03 05:28:00,563,"Hi all,Could not have been prouder than I was last night. After pretty much ignoring my poor son the whole day doing en suite renos, at around 6pm my boy pipes up ""Dad....lets eat supper in the bye boat at ..........Lake"" ( I love that he knows the names of the individual lakes). Mum comes home and I run it by her, she's a good sport, so off we went.So far Jack has shown little interest in fishing. He loves being in the boat but despite my efforts to get him fishing he usually finds other stuff of interest. Last night however it was all about catching fish. At the end he states ""Just one more cast""....job done for now!VIDEO OF JACK PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE NWO WALLEYE POPULATIONhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ1G7x1fMUEhttp://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...j/IMG_2525.jpg"
