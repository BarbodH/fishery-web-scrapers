1473455,IA JOE,2012-08-10 21:06:00,35,Looks like Dad and I will be at Onaway 9/7-14. Hope to see some of you there.
1473895,SinOrSwim,2012-08-12 12:53:00,1528,"I posted in the Burger thread too. But, we will be there the 7-12th. YOu will have to meet us one day for shore lunch."
1472046,SinOrSwim,2012-08-07 21:18:00,1528,That is good to know! Thanks!
1472081,IA JOE,2012-08-08 04:40:00,35,Looks like you had a good trip. Good luck with the game. Not sure if its on the web. I believe they have wifi. Bummer if one can not fish off the dock. Dad and I looked at the map and thought that narrows on the way out might be good. Does it have any current? I'm in my upper 40's(gray/white hair) and dad is in the upper 60's. Looking to have my first shore lunch on this trip.
1472184,SinOrSwim,2012-08-08 08:49:00,1528,"My guess is since we will have 6 boats this year, we will try to decide a time and a place for shore lunch. We used to all fish in the same areas and would just go when it felt right but we might have to be a little more organized this year with so many boats. You are welcome to join us if you end up being there the same week. We do a lot of fish tacos. The favorite one is the baja walleye taco. Fried walleye in strips/chunks, tortilla, slaw or lettuce, tomato and a baja sauce made from sour cream, chipotles, shallots, garlic lime etc. We sometimes fry the tortilla for a crunchy shell but with that many people we will probably avoid that? Time consuming. Usually add in beans or potatoes etc as a sided. Have to keep Morgans father in law away from teh beans though. He adds in a bunch of spicy garlic wing sauce from buffalo wild wings. They are really good but you shoot fire later."
1472305,wallydave,2012-08-08 13:03:00,2151,"I'd like to here more about Onaway. It looks like a nice place, with good boats, the location looks good for Mckenzie Bay. The website doesn't have a great deal of info on things like rates, whats included, minnows, ice, guide service fees, that kind of info. Thanks!"
1472321,SinOrSwim,2012-08-08 13:26:00,1528,"I'm not sure on rates. I think it depends on time of year and availability? We went very late last year and only fished 3 days but they negotiated a rate with us. I don't think we could have done this in say June. Here is what my brother sent to our group last year: The cost per person is $406.80 and that is tax included. That includes 4 nights at the cabin and 3 days with a boat with 2 dudes/boat. The boats are 17ft Lund boats with 50hp motors. Each boat gets 5gal of gas and 3 doz minnows per day in the rate above. We had access to the ice machine and used it for coolers in teh boat along with coolers at the cabin for beer etc. They provided coolers to store fish in the boat. Guide service is extra and I don't have that off the top of my head. When we were there the boats were gassed up and minnows waiting for us at our boat. All we had to do was load up and go. Blair and Kathy are the owners and we didn't get to speak with them a ton but what when we did, they seemed extremely nice. Blair had fallen off a ladder building a cabin and crushed his arm. So, they were in Dryden and then Thunder Bay possibly to have surgery. They were there at the end but they made sure we were taken care of when we go there. The videos you see on-line are exactly what you see when you get there. My father-in-law had never been on one of our trips but had been to Canada many times with church groups etc. He enjoyed himself so much he is missing his first LIVE Iowa vs. Iowa State game this year for the first time in like 33 years. That is how much he enjoyed our trip last year with the fishing, the cabins and of course.....our cooking."
1472340,wallydave,2012-08-08 14:20:00,2151,"The info you provided is what I was looking for! How long a boat ride is Mckenzie Bay? From the map it doesn't look to be that far, but when the winds kick up the Lac can get pretty bumpy!"
1472374,SinOrSwim,2012-08-08 15:27:00,1528,"Not quite sure how far but if it's windy would be tough to be on that part of the lake. We went all the way across into Sun Light Lake and while it took awhile it wasn't hours by any means. I wasn't watching the time. Was more paying attention to my GPS so I could mark some way points so I could get back. Plus, we had the benefit of following the guide who was taking some other guys over there so could pretty much go all out and he knew where rocks were."
1472402,wmd,2012-08-08 16:22:00,388,"There is afull moon on August 31, fishing will be better then.wmd"
1472429,rather-be-fishin,2012-08-08 17:35:00,429,I just got back from LS & timed our trip in McKenzie to a small island just West of Ghost Narrows & In a camp boat with 40 hp you can get there in about about 35 minutes from Onaway. RBF
1472457,IA JOE,2012-08-08 18:54:00,35,Just 5 gal. per day. Works out to 30 gal/week not bad. The boat should burn 5 gal. per hour wide open. Running to Mckenzie and back will burn 5 gal. I better budget for $120 in extra gas. I believe the weekly rate was around $750. Give or take $25. I figured about 30 minutes to East Shanty Narrows. I setup to have a guide in July 2013 the cost was $160 per day w/ shore lunch.
1471932,IA JOE,2012-08-07 18:04:00,35,Heading to Onaway Lodge(1st time in this area) in early sept. Plan to hire a guide for the first day. At what water temp will walleyes start into a fall pattern? Any tips on what has worked or hasn't for that time of year would be great. Might help me get down to two tackle boxes. I heard a warm spell(90 degrees)hit that area last year. If you were there did the fish shut down?
1471939,SinOrSwim,2012-08-07 18:10:00,1528,What dates will you be there Joe?
1471944,IA JOE,2012-08-07 18:19:00,35,Not sure at this point. Waiting on word of a possible cancellation (my spelling skills bite) for 8/31-9/7 or they have an opening 9/7-14. Not sure which would be better for fishing and work would prefer I go on 8/31-9/7.
1471956,SinOrSwim,2012-08-07 18:29:00,1528,"We will be there Sept 7-12. Our first time there was last year in very late September. I think 26-30? We did okay. Had done fly-ins for years and were always a few weeks earlier than this. But, didn't do bad. Took us a little while to locate but biggest of the week was 26.5"" and had a couple days of very solid fishing. We are hoping it will be better this year going a little earlier. Very spotty last year but I think part of that was us getting used to and trying new spots.I probably won't be much help with the locations as we are still learning the lake but if you haven't been there it is very nice. We are in Cabin 3 last year and I think again this year. Fish house and boats were fantastic as well. Granted, I have fly-in's to compare it to but we liked it enough we are going back. We have struggled the past couple years to get 4 or more on a fly-in, so we switched and had 10 last year, 12 this year and almost had 16."
1471976,IA JOE,2012-08-07 18:59:00,35,Would be glad to meet you if the dates workout that way. I have a trip setup with the wife and boy for next year at Onaway July 5-12 in Cabin 6. This trip is dad and I. You have a pretty large group. Are you party animals or hit the hay early? Fly-ins seem to be just a little much for what I'm willing to spend. Do you think that was an issue for your group? or flush vs pit? My wife is a flush only person.
1471981,MorganMan,2012-08-07 19:04:00,341,"IAJOE, let us know what dates u settle on, we may or not see ya!"
1471989,SinOrSwim,2012-08-07 19:23:00,1528,"A little of both. LOL We are definitely drinkers but not late at night typically. Plus, the group is getting older. A lot older this year. If you are up the 7-14, we are hoping to have the Iowa/Iowa St game on that evening. Trying to figure all that out. Not sure if it will work, but are going to try. Did fly-ins for about 15+ years. Not sure if it's the flying in float planes, cost or a combination of both for some of the group. Most of the group are not die hard fisherman and not sun up to sun down or fish at night. So, cost on a fly-in probably factored in. THe other thing is the float planes and many not liking the flight. In addition to having small kids at home with no contact for almost a week. Just a lot of factors. We didn't rough it though. Flush toilets inside along with shower/hot/cold water. Solar power etc. Not nearly as nice, new and clean as Onaway though."
1472013,IA JOE,2012-08-07 20:10:00,35,"SinOrSwim, Dad and I will drink a beer every evening. We try to fish sunup to sundown and like to fish off the dock at night(if that will produce at Onaway) but age has shown us the value of a slower pace and we stop to enjoy whole experiance. Plus I will have to pickup a homemade pie and bread at the market in Ear Falls. The wife put in a return order on the bread. Would the game be on tv or radio? On the website I didn't see tvs in the cabins. You stated didn't do bad that's a pretty wide range. Dad and I would be happy with 30-40 fish combined per day. Fishing 10 hours per day is that dock to dock time? With all the running around just how much tiume does one actually spend with a bait in the water? If you spend 6-7 hours each day actually fishing and two guys boat 40 fish it works out to about a fish every 20 minutes. During the trip I took in July with the wife and son the wind blew us off the lake except for mornings and evenings the last two days and I caught 1 walleye in those two days. So didn't do bad sounds pretty good. MorganMan, Will do. Look forward to it."
1472038,rather-be-fishin,2012-08-07 21:04:00,429,"Morgan Man, Onaway is located in Scout Bay which is protected from big winds and your always able to fish it and catch fish too. There are fish very close to the resort too, just before the small channel on the right side that you go through right out from the resort is always a good place to fish in big wind days when you can't get out on Bay of Islands and McKenzie. We just got back from there on last Saturday and our biggest walleye of the trip was 27 1/2 inches caught right there in Scout Bay. Fishing was great and we had a blast! Counting down the days again to next years trip! RBF"
1472045,SinOrSwim,2012-08-07 21:16:00,1528,"We are a much slower pace than we used to be that is for sure. We maybe had one day where we didn't hit that 30-40 per day as the number? Our first day. After that, it was pretty good but we don't ever keep track of sheer numbers but I'm confident we put 30 to 40 fish in a boat pretty easy. We hit a spot coming back from SunLight and basically just trolled up and down the side of a point and hit a fish pretty much every single pass and sometimes two. All about 15 to 20"". We got pretty lucky with the wind. We were also there very very late september so maybe we will have better luck earlier? Like I said, biggest was 26.5"" and if memory serves the 2nd and 3rd fish were around 25"". Then a lot of 20 to 22"" fish. We mainly fish live minnow rigs. Silver spinners are probably the predominant color? That is mainly what I use anyway.Haven't ever fished off the dock and we have only been there once. I do know they have a ""pet"" northern so I'm not completely sure it's allowed? We are going to try and set up a satellite to watch the game. My father in law hasn't missed an Ia/Ia St game live in 30+ years. So, we told him we would try our best to get the game. They don't have TV's, we will bring a small one. MorganMan is also our group. That is my older brother and he and I started this thing 17 or 18 years ago. Be him, me, Hawkfan (youngest brother), our Dad, Morgans father in law, my father in law and then friends. It's a good group ranging in age from 30's to 70's. We do a pretty mean shore lunch too if you are in there the same time we are."
