1473677,IA JOE,2012-08-11 16:50:00,35,Would you let SinOrSwim know that I will be at Onaway Sept. 7-14. Look forward to meeting your group. Seems like you had a great burger. Its hard to beat a good burger. Did it come with sweet potatoe fries?

Hawkfan, me and two others from the Des Moines area, one from Clear Lake, a couple from Arizona and the rest from Minnesota.Should arrive late afternoon on the 7th. Fish the 8th-11th, leave the 12th. Tough to get a whole week with travel etc. Many of us have small kids and the wives are okay with 7 days but 10 would be stretching it. See you up there!!!!"
