If it was, it would be a steal. Check out Paradise Cove, in Minaki, Ontario. I believe the web address is www.paradisecoveminaki.com. If I'm wrong, just search Paradise Cove, Minaki, Ont. on your search engine. Only a few hours drive from Intl. Falls, Mn. Great fishing, some big waters but, tons of smaller waters. The rental boats could and will handle the big waters. So many choices, sooo little time!!!!"
1473644,JAY221,2012-08-11 13:31:00,877,I am trying to cover the bases here with my options. Trying to get a few to go to Canada in July next year. If it doesn't work out does anyone know of camps that will rent a cabin & boat to one person. Preferably not on big water. The wife is going east to her sisters & I am NOT going there. Thanks in advance. Jay

1473730,Fishin Fun,2012-08-11 20:00:00,218,South Bay Resort on Gull Rock Lake has a 1 bedroom cabin to rent. Mary will rent to a single. Otherwise check the other thread mentioned above.
1473733,Guest,2012-08-11 20:05:00,0,Arrowhead Resort and Motel in Nestor Falls would be a good place to check.
1473745,Nimstug,2012-08-11 21:27:00,2605,"Check with Camp Narrows at west end of Rainy Lake. Yes, Rainy is big but that end of the lake fishes small with the number of islands and bays that are available. Most camps won't rent to a single or even a double during the busy season of May and June. After the 4th of July many places slow up. And don't overlook fall fishing opportunities. Nimstug"
