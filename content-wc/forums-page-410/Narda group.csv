1474084,FrankLeigh,2012-08-12 21:48:00,80,"For you guys that like Crown Royal or CC, you need to pick up a bottle of Forty Creek. Crown Royal used to be my favorite, but now, I would take Forty Creek over any other Canadian Rye. Try it and let me know what you think. I am enjoying it right now."
1474178,NARDA 1,2012-08-13 07:23:00,636,"When in Canada our preference is Hiram Walker Special Old, In the states it would be Rittenhouse orTempleton. We tried Forty Creek while we were at Birch Dale (they make their BBQ sauce for their ribs with it, very good) two years ago but prefer the Special Old."
