542415,Guest,2004-08-07 04:18:00,0,"Yes...Heads up is right. the MNR can land on a dime if needed. With the water higher in many lakes this summer they are getting into spots they could not get to before. Besides, if you are fishing illegally or over limited, stay home. I firmly believe that anyone Canadian or American, who is caught overlimit, or doing something illegal, should 1-loose their boat, motor, car, trail, fishing equipment, 2-Be fineed, and not just $100 but start at a grand a fish. 3-Be barred from Fishing Canada, Any province, again."
542444,phern,2004-08-09 10:08:00,151,"The MNR tries to save as much money as possible. Usually, the use of a plane is limited to special events. The float plane you saw was probably on a special mission checking up on a tip from a source. Maybe your party resembled a group that the agents were on the lookout for."
541368,Guest,2004-07-03 18:57:00,0,"I do not know the economics of it, but the fact that the MNR uses float planes and checks on us is good. It reminds us to behave and not push those regulations and boundaries. In Wisconsin, I hardly see a warden or ranger. I can not remember when the last time one asked me for a license when I was fishing."
541372,Guest,2004-07-03 20:12:00,0,OMNR can drop in on you any time. We have been checked at 11:00 PM in the dead of winter in our ice shacks by officers who snowshoed in. They had heard rumours of law breaking and decided to check it out. The snowmachines were kilometres away and they wanted no noise or lights to give them away. Checking by plane is relatively common more so in hunting season. They catch lots every year some with huge fines.
541382,Guest,2004-07-04 11:16:00,0,"Several years ago my party had a fly in to ""Dorthy Lake"". 250 miles into the bush. No roads, hydro, nothing. We were the only cabin on the lake. Middle of the week, a yellow plane circles and finally lands. Has a ""blue"" flashing light on it. Taxis up to our dock, out jumps three game wardens. They checked our licenses, frige, freezer for fish. We were all in compliance with the laws, so no problem. Just didn't expect to be checked in the middle of ""no where""! Pathfinder"
541568,Guest,2004-07-10 14:22:00,0,"The plane landing side ways in the river, only 30 yards wide is not possible. A little bit of an exaggeration. It doesn't matter if it is cost effective or not. It is just good to keep everyone in check so that there is good fishing for future generations."
541667,Guest,2004-07-14 00:09:00,0,"read it closer, he did not say sideways. As long as the wings dont hit anything its OK. Last year we had a police boat pull up just past yellow girl. did not ask for license or fish just how we were doing. ex[plained lak of fish and he gave us a location that worked out really good. the next day is was a dnr guyabout as friendly and this time asked about fish and if we knew the limits. We did not know and he explained it a couple of times and admitted it was as clear as mud. very helpful. He did say ""we dont give out many warnings"" but I think if we had erred he might have just given us one and let it go. It was a good thing he did not stop by the day before or we would have needed he forgiveness. we are an older couple just trying to enjoy some canadian fishing."
541728,Guest,2004-07-15 19:04:00,0,"my mistake on the side ways part, they usually are friendly people, but they also have a job to do. Just like you do, if you buy a license to fish, it is your responsibility to know the rules. If you don't know them before you go out, you should ask."
541732,Guest,2004-07-16 05:10:00,0,It's up to you to know the law. Going out without knowing the law is just looking for trouble. You have no one to blame but yourself if the Officer charges you with this attitude.
541733,Guest,2004-07-16 05:49:00,0,"No one in this thread said anything about not knowing the law or being in violation of the law. Your attitude is a broken record, always trying to bust somebody's bones over nothing. You need to find a new hobby,we're sick of this one!!!!"
541999,Guest,2004-07-25 13:21:00,0,"I am a cop...don't hold it agianst me. But, I will tell you that those MNR Wardens have ascary job. How would you like to get close enought to smell the STANKY breath of a guy thats been out fishing and camping for 6 days straigth...LOL EW!"
542039,Guest,2004-07-26 09:21:00,0,"Its simple, if you dont want to be checked just go number 1 and 2 right in the boat! When they flyin, boat in, kindly ask them to come on your boat! Shake their hand with some dung on it they wont be around long."
541259,Guest,2004-06-30 17:28:00,0,"Was on a trip recently on a portage only outpost near Ignace and had the MNR drop out of the sky in a float plane. He had circled us a couple of times and disappeared. We thought it was an outfitter taking a group to a nearby lake. All of a sudden he came flying over the treetops and dropped about 2 feet from th side of our boat. Talk about a rush. Luckily we were in compliance and had our licenses with us, but who would expect that on an outpost. Where we were fishing the river couldn't have been 30 yards wide. He had to have been a heck of a pilot. Heads up to all out there."
541267,WillieB,2004-07-01 05:31:00,292,Heads up?? Just follow the laws and you don't have to be looking over your shoulder.
541270,Trailerguy,2004-07-01 06:26:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I'd be talking to that area's MNR office about this CO's behavior, in as much as he endangered my life and my passengers, while hotdogging it! The possible violations vs. risk wasn't acceptable."
541272,Guest,2004-07-01 07:28:00,0,"Read his post!!! He was following all applicable laws. He should have said ""Heads down!"" the way he describes the pilot's flying tactics !!! 5 Stroke"
541275,Trailerguy,2004-07-01 08:43:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]It would be one thing to land up or down river and taxi up to the boat, but dropping in that close doesn't cut it. IMHO: Birds and fools drop out of the sky."
541276,Guest,2004-07-01 08:46:00,0,"Talk about a waste of taxpayers money. Why spend all that money on 'copters, pilots, gas to run into six or eight boats all day when you could take a boat out of Dalhousie or the Toronto Islands on any given day and check 100 boats in an afternoon, can you say PORKBARREL>"
541278,orchard frank,2004-07-01 09:27:00,1900,"We had a 'drop in' check on Lac Seul also one year, but I suspect it may have been related to the fact that my wife was fishing topless since we were all by ourselves. After they buzzed once or twice to make sure they were seeing what they thought they were, they landed, the wife scrambled to get a shirt on, and they motored over to check us. They kept a straight face until my wife asked if they had a long range camera on the plane, got a laugh and some good suggestions for fishing spots, all in good fun."
541280,Guest,2004-07-01 11:29:00,0,"There is only a couple of roads in and out of the remote areas. It would make sense to save on the plane gas and do road checks. They used to do this a few years ago, but I didn't see it this year. Maybe the revenue wasn't as good as catching someone with an extra line in the water. It's all about the cash!"
541282,Guest,2004-07-01 13:50:00,0,"The great pilot made a very dangerous move. He'd get his license jerked if this were pursued and the story is accurate. He is just a fish cop, not God."
541283,Guest,2004-07-01 13:54:00,0,"What kinda fruit you got at that orchard, Frank? Besides mellons, I mean. :)"
