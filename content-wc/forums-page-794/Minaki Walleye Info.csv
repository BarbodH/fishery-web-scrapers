542448,Guest,2004-08-09 11:14:00,0,Greetings: I am checking into Minaki on August 15th and was wondering if anyone would be able to inform me of how the fishing is. I practice catch and release and have heard that it is tough to find Walleye under 18 inches. I still like to eat a few while I am up there and would like to know some places to catch the smaller ones. Thank You Diesel

Largest was 27.5"" The tolling bite in big Sand has never really kicked in this year. MOst fish were caught rigging leeches and crawlers on the rockpile in NW corner of big Sand. This was my second trip there this summer. First trip was first week in July. Fishing was worse then, but one in our party did manage a 31.5"" on Gun Lake. I have been going there for 20+ years, and this summer seems a bit off."
