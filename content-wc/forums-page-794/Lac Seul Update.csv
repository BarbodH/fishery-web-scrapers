542501,Guest,2004-08-11 11:57:00,0,Heard they drained the lake to add more structure (reefs) and take care of the the silting issues. Said it would take 4-5 years to fill it up. Try another lake
542502,Guest,2004-08-11 13:15:00,0,Sounds like Lac Seul is in awful bad shape. Guess I will just have to go down to my Grampas pond and catch bass and catfish all day.
