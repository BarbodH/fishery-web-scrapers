We find that we catch the most fish around 11am up until noon. Going to be up next week and looking at the weather I better get ready to catch some cold front walleyes. Good luck all.

You had better be very familiar with the lake to be out at night. Lots of reefs. We will also be there next week. I hope the weather warms up. Better than being there the week this cold front first hits. Good luck to you.
