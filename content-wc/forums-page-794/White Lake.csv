538974,Guest,2004-04-19 09:26:00,0,Has anyone ever fished White Lake (about 20 miles west of the Town of White River off Hwy 17)? My buddy and I are thinking about camping at the provincial park for the walleye opener. I would be interested in hearing about your experience there.
539014,Guest,2004-04-20 15:07:00,0,"Fished it last July, did OK, with the slot in effect there, I saw way too many cigar 'eyes being kept. haven't checked this year's regulations but last year entire White Lake was fish sanctuary and closed to all fishing until June 15, would expect it to be the same this year"
539031,Guest,2004-04-21 06:36:00,0,"Thanks for the response. I got a map from Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources that marked the fish sancturaries. Still looks like a lot of water to fish since it is a 14,000 acre lake. Did you try the north end of the lake (Clay Bay, North Bay or Shabotik Bay) for pike or walleye? Did you stay at the park or are there resorts around? Thanks again."
539089,Guest,2004-04-23 18:14:00,0,I live in Wawa and fish White Lake quite frequently. The park is a great place to stay but you better reserve a site. There is a area in Shabotik Bay that is no fishing until June 15th but just outside the no fishing area is good fishing but you will have lots of company. For the opener another place to fish where you will not have company is North Bay at the far end. If you want incredible fishing go there between June 15th to July 1. This is when the fish are now into Clay Bay and you still catch them in Shabotik and North Bay. I have caught numerous fish from 4lb up to 10lb at this time of year. Every time I go there 2 of us usually catch 30 fish on a bad afternoon up to well over a 100.
539107,Guest,2004-04-26 07:14:00,0,Thanks for the great info JREYE. Looking for a new lake to try and read some good things about White. Are there any resorts on the lake that you know of? How is the fishing below Highway 17?
539114,Guest,2004-04-26 19:04:00,0,"There are not any resorts on the lake, but between 5 to 10 miles west on hwy 17 there is Gloria's Motel and Dunk Lake Cabins. At the south end of the lake one good spot early in the season is where the White River flows out of the lake, fish just outside the fish sanctuary. The best fishing is in either Shabotik or Clay Bay throughout the summer. From mid June on Clay Bay holds some huge eyes."
