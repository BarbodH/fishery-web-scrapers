542530,Guest,2004-08-12 07:55:00,0,Not much help but ytesterday at 10 am the wait was 10 minutes from start to finish.
542460,Renn,2004-08-09 17:00:00,87,"I am just checking on what some of the wait times are coming back into Minnesota on Saturday, middle mornings? We came back via Baudette last Saturday to try and miss some of the delays and are wondering if pays off to bypass I. Falls? Thanks in advance for any information. Renn"
542461,Guest,2004-08-09 17:08:00,0,We came back July 17th about 2:00. We went to the duty free store in Ft Frances and they told us the wait was 2-3 hours. We decided to drive to Baudette and I'm glad we did-the line was all the way out of town so I know we saved time by going to Baudette. We came from Pickle Lake so next time we will cross at Pigeon River.
542467,brian1785,2004-08-09 20:59:00,1534,When I came back across in June we waited 2 hours. This past week when we came back we went through Baudette and it was 10 minutes tops! I know which way I'll be coming back from now on.
542470,Guest,2004-08-09 21:58:00,0,Here is a nice site that has updated border wait times for all entries to Canada.http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/general/times/menu-e.html

The line going into Canada at that time had to be at least 4 hours if not more."
542474,JimH,2004-08-10 07:57:00,320,"July 31st, arrived at the border at 10AM, about an hour wait. Baudette sounds like the way to go."
542476,Guest,2004-08-10 11:42:00,0,"When you guys say the times of these delays are you talking about going across during the weekend or during the weekdays? We're heading up to Rainy on thursday this week and we'll be crossing around 12 noon, we've never really had a problem with the border crossing being a long delay so i was just curious if you guys had experienced it during the peak weekend hours or the slower weekday hours. thanks."
542479,Guest,2004-08-10 13:39:00,0,I am going up this Saturday AM (about 6 AM) North on I-29 going towards Winipeg. Any problems there? Appreciate the response. Trying to make our camp near Dryden @ 12:00 Noon.
542482,Hammerhead Herb,2004-08-10 14:06:00,259,"We came across at 4PM on Friday evening (rush hour?) on July 30th. Our wait (going into the US) from when we were the last car in the line to when we drove out of the US customs check station was 38 minutes. I didn't think that was too bad for a Fri evening when everyone was getting out of work/starting their weekend. The week before (when going into Canada) the wait was only about 15 minutes on a Thursday evening about 5PM. Going through Dryden, I didn't think that justifies a trip to Baudette."
542503,Guest,2004-08-11 13:31:00,0,How are the lines into the U.S. at Fort Frances on a Sunday around noon?
