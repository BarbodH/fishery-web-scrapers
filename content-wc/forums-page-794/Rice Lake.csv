542389,Guest,2004-08-06 04:22:00,0,How do I get to a boat launch from Keene? Were is the best SMB fishing? Thanks
542465,515,2004-08-09 19:26:00,254,There is a boat launch on country rd 2 just east of Keene. Basically just down the hill from the village. It's on the Indian River and will take you out to the Lake. SMB fishing can be good right in the river and all thoughout the lake. There is a few islands not far out from the river there. Good Lcuk Mike
