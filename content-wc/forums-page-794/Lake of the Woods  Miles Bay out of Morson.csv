We went west of Miles Bay in the Boomstick area and picked up a few nice ones fishing breaks near deep water. One of the other boats in our group worked the reefs and Garden Island up in Miles Bay with little success. I don't know of a North Island in Miles, there is a North Island west of that area. I'll look at my charts this evening and get back to you if I find anything. If you want e-mail me at mjones(at)mncable.net and I'd be more than happy to give you more info."

I fished Miles bay the first day because we got there late and I fished off the south tip of Garden island with night crawlers and spinners comming out of 35 feet of water to like 15 feet and caught Saugers and Walleyes. There is an island about a mile or so southeast of the south tip which has no name, but I call it Gull island. You circle it and there is fish all around it.The second day the lake was flat calm and we hump fished with jigs and minnows from Morson going west all the way to Mcpherson Island. Any hump that came up to like 5 feet we caught fish on every one except one and we must haved fished 15 to 20 humps. These fish were sometimes right on top. The best bit was between 2:00pm & 4:00pm in the after noon and early morning before the sun got high. We also fished Whitefish bay and caught a few lakers but the fishing is different because the water is so clear. That island I call Gull has a 7 foot reef off the east side of the island about 1/4 mile and it holds fish. Check out Buena Vista live journal at www.livejournal.com/users/buenavista/"
