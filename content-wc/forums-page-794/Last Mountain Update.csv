542498,Western Walleye Editor,2004-08-11 08:15:00,465,"Spent last week at Last Mountain and had a wonderful week! We ""only"" had 2 walleye over 10 during the week, but many 5-8 and even more in the 18-22 inch range. Sorry guys my inches to CM ruler is broken. :) We probably caught 150+ walleyes in the week and also many 6-12 pound northerns. I also had a 44 inch northern that I didn't get a girth or weight on, but it was a brute. Reef Runners in Purple, Red and Gold were best for the bigger fish in the White Rock Area and Crawfish colored Hot-N-Tots were best for the numbers up around Arlington Beach. Honsie"
