541533,Guest,2004-07-08 13:32:00,0,Headed up to Lac Evans in Quebec @ the end of the month. This is my first fly in trip and I'm wondering if anyone is willing to share some eye catching tips and tricks. Thanks!
541543,Guest,2004-07-08 20:50:00,0,"KF, I just saw a website today on Lac Evans. Looks like an awesome place with some great fishing. Make sure when you get back to post a update on how you did."
541555,Guest,2004-07-09 15:23:00,0,"KF, Which camp are you staying at? I have fished all three over the last 6 years. I fished Crowe Bay first week this year and we did awesome. Walleye fishing was some of the best we have seen and we had 15 pike over 40 with largest being 43. Numerous 30+ Northerns also. Let me know if you would like any help. Good luck and be safe Millerman"
541602,Guest,2004-07-12 08:27:00,0,Hey Millerman- Thanks for the reply.......we're staying at the crow camp. I guess all we need is jigs with twister tails for the eyes. I understand that you can't use any live bait. I figure berkley power grubs (any suggested colors) on 1/4 oz jig will do the ticket. Did you find any eyes near camp? I was thinking of taking some bottom bouncers too. What's up with the pike......I understand they're hugh. Never really fished for them..........trying to figure out the necessary equiment. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks again and have a great day!

541694,Guest,2004-07-14 14:56:00,0,"KF, I was wrong about the 3 camps. I have fished only Crowe Bay and Kirk Island. I kept thinking we went to SW Bay one year but I was wrong. You should do well there. Jigs for the eyes and Johnson Spoons for the Pike have always worked well for us. Clarke is a great lake and you should have a great time. The only downfall is that it is a big lake and there can be days where it can get pretty nasty out there. Be careful. Good luck Millerman"
541710,Guest,2004-07-15 07:25:00,0,Did you guys use night crawlers?
541720,Guest,2004-07-15 10:41:00,0,"KF, You can not use any live bait on Lake Evans. Also no treble hooks allowed. We use power grubs or any kind of twister tails. We use all different sizes. White has worked best for us through the years. Hope this helps. Your camp caretaker should be able to point you in the right direction for fish. Millerman"
541724,Guest,2004-07-15 14:14:00,0,Thanks for the info Wasn't sure about using crawlers......sounds like you don't need them. Power baits will do the ticket..........have you tried any of the new Gulp minnows? Any pointers for catching the bigger eyes?
542532,Guest,2004-08-12 09:31:00,0,"Hammered the eyes-267 for the week Lots of pike.......4 over 40, biggest 43"
