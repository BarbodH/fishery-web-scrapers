542487,wallidiver,2004-08-10 16:22:00,50,"Just returned from a 8 day trip on LOTW out of Nestor Falls. Stable temperatures the entire week, cold front Friday evening. Never made it any farther than Hay Island. Reefs around Wolf Island were fantastic. Lots of fish is the 14"" - 19"" range. Largest fish was 25"" with 12w or so over 2o"". Had one evening of awesome weed fishing wich accounted for a number of the larger fish. Tried similar spots as well as the same spot the remainder of the week with little success. Fished primarily with leeches, but fish could be caught on nightcrawlers and minnows as well. Found very few fish on the tops of the humps, with most of the larger fish keyed in around 14 to 17 foot range on the edges. This was real close to being the best fishing I've ever had on LOTW. Went through almost 3 lbs of leeches, you can thank the perch for many of them. Jigs worked, but almost all the larger fish came on sliding bouncers and 4ft. snell. Muskie fisherman were seeing lots of fish, but the takers were tough. We chunked small bucktails on walleye tackle the last two days and managed to take a 40, 37,35 and 30 from Nestor Falls out to Split Rock. For anyone who takes their family (including kids) I would highly recommend looking into the lodging at Canadian Haven. As we all know a full day in the boat with kids can be hectic. Canadian Haven has numerous activities for the kids to do and provides piece of mind that the entire family enjoys the trip. Something many of the camps I've checked into don't provide. Good fishing, good friends and best of all momma re-booking for next year..doesn't get any better! For additional information on the fishing feel free to email me. [email protected]"
