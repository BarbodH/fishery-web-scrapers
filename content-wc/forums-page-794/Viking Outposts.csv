542369,Guest,2004-08-05 07:22:00,0,WE WERE AT CRITCHELL A FEW YEARS AGO. FISHING WAS TOUGH. THE LAKE IS BEAUTIFUL THOUGH. THE ONE SMALL PORTAGE LAKE PRODUCED BELOW THE FALLS AND THE PORTAGE TO MCINNES PRODUCED FISH AS WELL. CRITCHELL LAKE ITSELF WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND FISH. IT IS HOWEVER ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LAKES I HAVE EVER BEEN TO.
542424,Guest,2004-08-07 13:16:00,0,"Our group actually got back from critchell last sunday. As robby stated fishing can be hard. This was our second year there,and last year was far better, that doesn't mean we had a bad trip,as i managed to catch the biggest walleye of the trip ( 28 inches and it is still there ) We have found that we needed to fish mud area's as mayfly were still hatching. ( trolling crawler harness's ) current area were good also If it was sunny or no wind,we fished down to 30 feet ( 20 to 24 being the norm ) When it was cloudy and windy we caught fish from 5 to 16 feet. You will have to adapt to the weather condition. But this may be different as you get closer to fall. last year we had our best luck on the main lake,this year we did better on first and second portage lake. If you are interested in area's that we fished,drop me an e-mail @ [email protected]"

We are thinking of Crossland. Have any of you guys ever been there. What are the cabins like? Would you suggest any other lakes? We are looking for good walleye fishing, they don't need to be big, but we'd like to catch some nice norhterns."
542458,Guest,2004-08-09 15:55:00,0,"Stu, If it's walleye you're after, try to book Dolphin Lake. Have fished it twice. The first time we had 882 walleye for 2 guys. Second year was 611. Cabins are great, the operation is exellent. No big northerns, but then again we don't fish for them."
542466,phishfearme,2004-08-09 19:54:00,1242,"stu - also, you may wish to consider telescope or optic. we spent two weeks at telescope, caught good numbers and size walleye and the lake has by far the nicest cabin we've ever been to. you can portage to embryo lake and catch lakers easily and there's another portage lake also. they say there's lakers in telescope also but we couldn't verify that - even after many, many hours of trolling. i've heard similar reports on optic but the cabin isn't as nice. if you'd like more detail drop me an email [email protected] - phish"
