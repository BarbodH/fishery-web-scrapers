That Officer should have had to take that little Bear with his knife."

542233,Michigander1,2004-07-30 10:47:00,26,The Bear knew that Canadian Candy would have sent him into a week of serious Skid ( Skidding Bu## on grass )- no wonder the Bear got mad - LOL.
542272,Guest,2004-08-01 18:19:00,0,I don't know guys. Everytime I'm attacked by a bear I just give him a kiss right on the lips. It confuses him long enough for me to get away.
542445,phern,2004-08-09 10:18:00,151,"If you want to socialize with bears, the best trick is to take along a companion. A companion who cannot run as fast as you. Get him to carry the candy while you carry the camera."
542188,Bean,2004-07-29 08:49:00,20,"I wonder if it was this guy?http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v1...iganJacket.jpg Maybe it was a ""Bruin"" he was feeding candy to."
542198,Guest,2004-07-29 11:42:00,0,"A similar incident happened to me at a Hutterite Colony, when I ran out of candy while talking with the pig boss.. Just kidding........(but he wasn't near as friendly when the candy ran out). :)"
542201,Guest,2004-07-29 12:00:00,0,"Too bad the bear didnt get the job done, one less idiot."
542202,Guest,2004-07-29 12:31:00,0,"I think the correct term for feeding bears candy is ""natural selection"""
542204,bigfish1965,2004-07-29 14:16:00,3210,Or maybe 'appetizer'...lol

542207,walleye1230,2004-07-29 15:58:00,41,"Here's the story from the Northern Sun News out of Red Lake.... Photo Seeking Tourist Mauled by Black Bear June 16, 2004 By Pamela Corie On Thursday, June 10th at approximately 5:00pm, a 39 year old Michigan man visiting in the Ear Falls area was attacked by a black bear. The victim and some of his friends had stopped along Highway 105 to videotape and photograph the bear, and in doing so, approached the bear to within 4 to 5 feet. The bear then charged the victim, knocking him to the ground, and began to maul him until witnesses scared it away. The victim went to the Ear Falls OPP Detachment to report the attack, and was later transported by ambulance to the Red Lake Cochenour Memorial Hospital. There he was treated for numerous puncture wounds and scratches to the neck and head. An Ear Falls OPP officer located the suspect bear, still in the area after the incident, and was forced to destroy it after it charged in an aggressive manner. Samples of the 125 pound male bear were then sent to the Northwestern Health Unit for testing of rabies. The initial investigation shows that the victim was way too close to the bear, within 5 feet, and that he was feeding the animal candy, commented Dave Anderson, Head of Enforcement at the Red Lake MNR. People have to show respect for wildlife and keep away from them. It appears that this person used poor judgement. Mr. Anderson also stated that female bears (sows) are very aggressive in attacking real or perceived threats to their cubs, and should be seen as a serious threat. However, the bear in this attack was male, and at this point, it appears that he was territorial, commented Mr. Anderson. Bears will aggressively defend their territory, especially if it is a food source. The sample being tested by the NWHU won't reveal whether the bear had rabies until the investigation is concluded, but that would be a rare case, as very few animals have ever tested positive for rabies in the area, commented Mr. Anderson. I don't think there has ever been a case of rabies in a bear reported in this area. Earlier on the day of the attack, a local bus driver was traveling Highway 105 on her route, and came upon, what she suspects, was the same bear. I was driving my route and slowed the bus when I saw the bear ahead, commented Jackie Desserre. However, as I neared the animal, it didn't run off the road into the bush, but charged the bus. I stopped, surprised by the animals aggressive behavior, and it then ran underneath the bus. When I could see it in my rear view mirror, I drove forward slowly and the bear wandered into the bush. Mrs. Desserre completed her route and then spent the day trying to contact proper authorities to deal with the bear, with no success. I called the police and was given a number to call to report problem bears, but I was passed on to several other numbers, and no one went to deal with it. I was really worried, because I didn't see any cubs and thought that there was something wrong with that bear, it was so aggressive. It just wasn't normal, commented Mrs. Desserre. When I heard later that day that someone had been mauled in that area, I was very upset that nobody had done anything about the bear. The number to call for nuisance bear issues is the MNR Hotline, at 1-866-514-BEAR, and for emergency bear incidents, people can call the OPP at 1-888-310-1122. We really want to stress that people should ensure that they give wildlife space, concluded Mr. Anderson. One should never approach a bear for any reason, and photographs should be taken from a safe distance with a telephoto lens. Respect all bears, as you never know which one is going to be dangerous."

542218,Guest,2004-07-29 22:24:00,0,"Darwin qualifications don't care if you are sober or not .....you just got to be DEAD. Since the guy was from Saginaw County and it happened on a Sat, I will give 10-1 odds he was under the influence of some substance."
542153,Guest,2004-07-28 16:22:00,0,"Awwwww........... come on...... Tb News Source Web Posted: 7/28/2004 8:29:41 AM Testing on a bear that attacked an American tourist in Ear Falls last month has determined the animal did not have rabies. However, the man was still administered a $1,000 series of vaccinations for the disease, courtesy of Ontario taxpayers. The 39-year-old Minnesota man was treated for numerous puncture wounds and scratches. Initial police reports said the victim and his friends stopped along Highway 105 to videotape a black bear when it charged and attacked the man, who was reportedly five to eight metres from the animal. A review of the videotape determined he was much closer to the bear and feeding it candy before it attacked."

542158,Trailerguy,2004-07-28 19:06:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]The Red Lake paper said he was from Michigan. He should be nominated for a Darwin award. :)
542160,Guest,2004-07-28 19:48:00,0,being from michigan says it all
542167,Guest,2004-07-28 21:40:00,0,He won't quailfy. We already have a rock solid nominee in a guy who went through the ice and was rescued walleye fishing out on the Saginaw Bay's ice in the morning and later on in the afternoon on the SAME day went out again and went through the ice and died. To be a Darwin nominee you must die in the process of your stunt. The bear guy didn't die so he is not a nominee. The Michigan Darwin Awards Board wants DEAD Michiganders doing the stupid stuff not live ones.
542169,Guest,2004-07-28 22:36:00,0,"Jeez ... was the dead guy SOBER??? I figure I can be a slow learner at times, but an ice-water bath would surely have gotten MY attention the FIRST time!!"
542170,bigfish1965,2004-07-28 23:42:00,3210,Shouldn't we be sending this guy ( or better yet his parents) a bill for this? Who ever heard of a bear having rabies anyway? Seems ike a waste to treat someone for that.
542174,Guest,2004-07-29 05:58:00,0,"Maybe they should of had the bear inoculated for ""dimwititis"" we would hate for our Canadian bears to get that disease from that dimwit with the candy and spread it through the rest of the bear population. On second thought maybe we want less smart bears. Especcially now that we don't have a spring hunt."
542177,bigfish1965,2004-07-29 07:28:00,3210,Unforunately the only way to test a mammal for rabies is post mortum. Due to some idiots unbelievabe inability to understand the meaning of 'wildlife' and 'bear' they would have had to kill the creature to run the brain tissue tests necessary.
542185,Guest,2004-07-29 08:37:00,0,Interesting question... Was the DEAD guy drunk? Can you be drunk if you AIN'T NO MORE?
