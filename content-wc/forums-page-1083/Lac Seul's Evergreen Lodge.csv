507147,Guest,2000-02-22 13:56:00,0,"Crankin,I'm not sure about the biggest. I have heard and seen really large walleye's (30"") caught in the spring, summer and fall. Probably mostly in the spring from my experience anyway. I'm sure that there are bigger ones in the lake. As for what is an average trip for large fish...good question? I guess it just depends on the weather, and how long you are out there. I have seen lots of groups come into camp, and leave a disappointed because they haven't done as well as other people. This is usually because by the time they get serious, their trip is almost over! I guess bottom line is that you have to be willing to put a lot of time in for the big ones, and don't expect to do it in a few days, although every now and then you get lucky. I have say that all the advice on this page is really informative, and accurate. I also can't stress enough about paying a lot of attention when you are traveling on the Seul because it is a lower unit graveyard. Also, be careful and take a survival pack with you. Almost every year I hear about guy's being lost and dying on the Seul. Last year my dad was up there when a whole group of guy's were killed. Be careful up there and good fishing."
507148,Guest,2000-02-23 13:02:00,0,how were those guys killed
507149,Guest,2000-02-25 14:47:00,0,"eyemadman,It was late in the season last fall. I'm not sure about the details, but I believe that four guys were killed. I know that the lake had been rough and the weather was pretty bad. I had also heard a story about a local fella a maybe 6 or so years ago who was working on his motor and fell in. I guess he couldn't get back in the boat and hypothermia got him. I guess if it could happen to a local, it could sure happen to us.I hope I don't discourage anyone from going!Matt N."
507150,Guest,2000-02-28 10:14:00,0,I was just curious if it might have been grizzly bears. I guess rough weather and hypothermia can be dangerous on any body of water...Safe boating to all!
507137,Guest,2000-02-18 08:39:00,0,"I just made cabin reservations for June 10-17 at Evergreen Lodge. It has been kind of a spur of the moment decision to go up there and we didn't have time to do a lot of research, but we wanted to get a cabin booked before everything was taken. From the publicity that they get on TV and the people I talk to, I assume it is a pretty good place to stay. I would like to know if anyone has ideas of equipment to bring for both staying in the cabin and fishing. We will be bringing our own boat and are very experienced fisherman, but any advice is always welcomed.Thank you, EG"
507138,Guest,2000-02-18 12:54:00,0,"Evergreen is a nice place. Great owners and staff. Cabins are in excellent condition and have all the amenities. They will give you the locations of hot spots. In June the weather usually sucks, so bring your cold weather gear and top quality rain gear including neoprene gloves. Be prepared for some big water. The weather can beach you for a day or so. If that happens, there are several other lakes in the area you can trailer to for a days fishing. The fishing areas are protected from most weather, but getting to them is the challenge when the weather is bad. In June the fishing is usually good in Sancutary Bay 1/4 mile from camp; Sawmill Bay 5 miles from camp; and, Cox's Island located on the way to Saw Mill. There are several other areas that the camp staff will tell you about. You can also go the Steamboat and McKenzie Bays if you want to travel 15 to 20 miles. Usually well worth the trip. Most walleye presentations will work. In the spring, I generally troll spinners and minnows. I will use jigs on calmer sunny days. I've also done well just pulling a minnow or leech on a naked hook tied to a 6 foot leader. Speed trolling cranks can work well, but the small northens get to be pests if your looking for walleyes. You made a good choice. TGG"
507139,Guest,2000-02-18 18:00:00,0,"Great GuideCould you be a little more descriptive on where in Steamboat Bay, McKenzie Bay and around Cox Island. I heard the guys talking about McKenzie and know they like it. I have a map and will be able to follow your direction. I'm going up in June and again in Sept. with 11 other guys and would like a edge on places to go. Thanks"
507140,MP35,2000-02-18 20:49:00,19,"I've been up there for the past 7 years during June. Spinner rigs are my mainstay for eyes. I pull mine with bottom bouncers and blade colors that work well are Orange, Chartruse, Red and combo Chartruse/orange. Blade size 2-4. Steamboat bay... The 3 islands @ the end of the long island once you go through the narrows(on left heading towards shanty narrows) Steamboat bay on right @ entrance to Fairwell bay. McKenzie bay.... Ghost narrows. Rock pile in middle of narrows or the clay banks on east side of narrows. The big and small clay banks @ east end of McKenzie close to Deer island. Turkey creek is also a great June spot.Closer to home (Evergreen lodge) the Winnesauga river is a good bet. Most of the fish I catch are in less than 12' of water. Generally concentrate on 6-8' zone, if that doesn't produce then try other depths. Caught many of fish in water less than 4' during June pitching jigs and minnows. Weather as previous post said is a challenge. Sometimes you will freze your butt and other times you'll be in shorts and t-shirts. Pack for all conditions. The weather can change quickly, 1 day it's hot (80's) and the next day it's cold (40's) you never know. By all means take a GOOD rain suit! Last year it rained (in Sept) every day. Been up there in June when it's the same.Any other ?? e-mail meGood luck and enjoy"

507142,Lee,2000-02-19 16:15:00,61,"Gary runs one of the best camps anywhere! Don't rule out less than 2 ft pitching jigs, have pounded 'em this way along riprap shores. No kidding, wouldn't believe it if hadn't done it several times."
507143,Guest,2000-02-19 16:22:00,0,"By the way, be extreemly careful navagating. Every year we have seen someone in camp take out a lower unit. The water is dark and there is no room for error. Always take the same route, watch out around the islands."
507144,Guest,2000-02-20 07:51:00,0,"Rent Gary the first day you are there. Ask him to take you to Fish Gut Bay. Its an hour ride in his boat, but worth the trip. Ask him to show you spots on the way there and back."
507145,Guest,2000-02-21 19:20:00,0,"I spend the summers at Evergreen and the fishing is great. What no one has mentioned is the slot limit (18-21)are throwbacks. Evergreen is a real believer in returning everything over 21"" especially the big ones unless you're going to hang it on the wall. If you are one of those ""meat"" fisherman, definately don't go to Evergreen and the rest of us would just as soon you go to another lake. Catch'em, take pictures, then throw them back, so we can catch them another time. The other people have provided much of the same information I would have. Most times you will catch the fish in 12' or less all year, really shallow until rest of lake warms considerably. Good Luck!"
507146,Guest,2000-02-22 10:43:00,0,How big do the fish get and what is an average trip for a big fish?
