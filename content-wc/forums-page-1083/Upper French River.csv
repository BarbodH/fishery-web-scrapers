506918,Guest,2000-02-25 20:11:00,0,"Hi I am originally from French River but I live in Ottawa now. Every summer I go back because my family is there and so are the walleyes.... yes my friend there are some strict slot sizes on the French now-a-days. Check out the MNR (Ministry of Natural Resources) website, they have a downloadable regulations book view-able with Acrobat viewer. Or maybe some of the French River area websites have that kind of information posted. You maybe able to e-mail someone there who could give you the full facts!"
