I'm sure that if you have any questions about the western half Lac Seul, I'm sure that he would be more than happy to help you. I have been up there fishing a dozen times or so, but he usually gets up there 4 or 5 times a year! Lucky Guy... His E-mail is [email protected] Hope this helps a little.Matt N."
