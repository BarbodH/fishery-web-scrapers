I was wondering if anyone had some interesting tidbits about the big lake itself or lakes in the surrounding area for that time of year. It will be my first time up there, so I'd appreciate any info about what to expect.Tight Lines,Mick"

506895,Guest,2000-02-20 11:43:00,0,This is a great lake that time of the year if you get a guide. Pickeral Bay on the lake has a tremendous walleye population you can probably expect to catch 10-25 walleye per angler from 2-7 pounds. The lakers will also be up that time of the year so make sure you bring some heavy gear. There are plenty of fish in the teens and some even bigger. This lake is full of reefs so be sure you go with someone who knows the lake. Good luck!

A lot of the time, you can see a couple 10 pound plus pike swimming around in one of the bays, and all you have to do is cast to them.For walleye, jigs and tails work great. Just fish rocky points etc.Hope this helps,PikemanWestern Canada Fishing Page - http://www3.sk.sympatico.ca/farr"
