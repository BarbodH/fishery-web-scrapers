507151,Guest,2000-02-18 21:47:00,0,"I will be heading to Manitoba in a few days, and would like to know if barbless hooks are required on all waters there. I've never fished Manitoba, only Sask. We will be perch fishing just across the border. So far, I've been told that wax worms can be taken across the border, but no live minnows. Is this true? How many perch can legally be brought back across the border in ND? I know what Sask. is, but is Manitoba the same? Thanks for any help you guys can give me here.Take care,Brad"

507154,stewart,2000-02-21 17:13:00,100,P.S to the other posts.The nice thing about the barbless rule is that you only have to debarb the hooks tied to the end of your line. The stuff in your tackle box doesn't have to be debarbed until you use it (1999 rules). Sorry I don't know anything about the bait.
507155,River_eye,2000-02-22 09:49:00,1486,"I still look at barbless hooks as a great thing. You don't lose as many fish as you'd figure. Plus if you are fishing for Pike and trying to get the hooks out and they are imbedded pretty deep, the barbless hooks slide right out. It also encourages you to become a better fisherman/woman.[font size=""4"" color=""green"" font face=""signature""]River eye[/font]"
