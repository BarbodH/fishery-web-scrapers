Ice is sketchy at best (for driving), and with lots of water on top, bring your rubber boots!I didn't hear of any walleyes being caught, however the Northerns were on the prowl.Birch point produced some real nice perch, but no walleyes."

They are fishing fairly shallow, I don't think anymore than 6 ft, although the whole lake is extremely shallow. You have to take an ice road out about a mile or so to get to where everbody is fishing. Talked to a few guys and they said that there was nothing spectacular happening, a few walleye here and there. We were a little bit further out, cause we didn't want to fish in the crowd. Anyways, if it's a nice day, go for it. [font size=""4"" color=""green"" font face=""signature""]River eye[/font]"
