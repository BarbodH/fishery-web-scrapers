507124,Willy,2000-02-15 18:37:00,4,I have a chance to go to Eagle Lake the third week of June. What methods would work to catch eye at that time? What about lake trout?Thanks in advance..
507125,Rick,2000-02-15 19:12:00,226,"A 1/4 (or larger if windy) lead jig tipped with a minnow is the normal tactic. You may also have luck trolling with something like a Smithwick Rogue if conditions are tough (I caught a 32"" 10.5 lbs 'eye a few years back trolling a Rebel Fastrak parallel with the saddle between two islands).Eagle Lake conditions have been different each time I have fished it. It can be hot, cold, high water, low water, windy, dead calm and during mid June thru mid to July Mayfly hatches mess up the fishing.My recomendation would be to hire a guide, if possible, for your first day of fishing. You'll learn the appropriate pattern for the current conditions. Watch how the guide fishes and learn from what he does.If you are interested, I have created a website with lots of info about Eagle Lake and traveling to Canada (fishing rules, border info, etc). It's at: http://wwa.com/~rmryan/Eagle_Lake/eagle_lake.htmlEagle Lake is a great place to fish, I'm sure you'll have a great time.Rick"
