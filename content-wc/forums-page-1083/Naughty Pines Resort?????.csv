507199,ZIM,2000-02-23 19:37:00,1,I had the same offer from them a few years back. It turned out to be one free with another at regular price. Was still a good deal. My choices were on off times- Sept. and Oct. Fishing was good but others had a rough time finding walleyes. Very nice cabins.Hope this helps.
