We were told by the resort that most of the fish are in that area at that time of the year because of the weedbeds. Were there a lot of quiet bays in that area or is it more of the main lake? How big are the fish in that area? We booked the July 29-August 5 week. Did you guys get lots of pike and walleye as well? Have you ever been to McKenzie Bay from the resort there or did you stay mostly near the resort? Where is more of the better fishing, north, east, or south of the resort. and finally did you guys deal with other boat traffic in that area? You have already been a big help thusfar, I really appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions. Thanks a bunch!"
