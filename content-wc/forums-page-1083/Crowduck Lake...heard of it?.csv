507168,Guest,2000-02-20 17:55:00,0,"There is a Crowduck Lake in Manitoba, located in Whiteshell Provincial Park. It is only accessible by boat [across Big Whiteshell Lake], and then a short portage. The camp on the lake is ""Crowduck Lake Camp"" [ph. 1-204-222-7307] and they will pick up clients at Big Whiteshell Lake, and transport them to Crowduck."

There is a lodge on the Winnipeg river called Eagle Nest lodge and they offer fly-in day trips to crowduck. The fish in there are monsters, nothing under 20"".[font size=""2"" color=""green""]River eye[/font]"
507170,Jim,2000-02-24 21:00:00,238,"The lake you're referring to is in Manitoba and only a couple hours from Winnipeg and/or Kenora. The walleye fishing is good as is smallmouth. Pike fishing poor. The lake is going through major changes and my prediction is that the smallies will once again become dominant. The only camp on the lake is called Crowduck Lake Camp, and it's truly an excellent, first class place. I've made three trips there. My fishing club members have totaled several hundred trips there."

507172,Guest,2000-02-27 19:30:00,0,"Yes, i have heard of crow duck lake. great walleye fishing!Just be aware, the lake is entirely catch and release for everything. You can't evan keep any small walleyes to eat. This may not bother you and if it doesn't, good luck"
507173,Guest,2000-02-28 10:23:00,0,"Thats unbelievable, cant even have shorelunch for all them bucks"
507174,River_eye,2000-02-28 11:50:00,1486,"Yeah, I think it's rather silly, but it's a trade off. The catch and release policy was what made the lake so bountiful in the first place. From my understanding, natural resources decided that the lake could stand to be harvested, but the locals voted against it, so it's still catch and release. Personally, I think this is having or will have a negative effect on the lake, with no real predator, they will eventually run out of food.[font size=""4"" color=""green"" font face=""signature""]River eye[/font]"
