6626680,rosh1,2022-01-21 06:55:00,275,Nice pictures thanks for update on snow. Glad to see how much is up there with hopes of water levels being higher this spring.
6626682,prov1800,2022-01-21 07:08:00,5010,Lots of snow and morè coming today again.Water will come up some for this spring.Lots of the snow evaporates and never gets in the lakes but there will be run off
6626692,rosh1,2022-01-21 07:20:00,275,Have my fingers crossed that I can get my boat to my dock. Lake level was a pain last year but we were glad to be back up there.
6626736,prov1800,2022-01-21 08:55:00,5010,Would be nice with higher water.I had problems launching my boat especially the dock in Vermilion Bay.Cliff lake got bad and I got stuck there.
