6629064,eyecatcher1,2022-01-29 12:11:00,323,I've made that trip lots of times and love it! When I was there in August and October of 2021 the water was too low to chance it though.
6629066,eyecatcher1,2022-01-29 12:22:00,323,"There are I think 3 fish sanctuaries on Minnitaki. They are closed to fishing until June 15, I think. I've been told the fishing in them is great when they first open. I have never been there at that time to try it, but I will be this year. Good Luck!"
6629286,prov1800,2022-01-30 07:15:00,5010,Have been lucky to be able to fish there a number of times with my wife working in Sioux lookout and having a place on Abram to stay at.Cose to the sanctuaries gets pretty busy so i stayed away from those areas plus long boat rides from Abram.I fished mainly Abram from close to the 5 mile launch.I found I pretty much had the lake to myself even with border open and before pandemic.Fished towards Andersons Lodge but on opposite shoreline.That whole shoreline holds a lot of fish.Also headed towards shuttes and lots of fish towards there and no fisherman.lots of fish headed toward winioga lodge to.did spent some time on minitaki also.You need to be carefull tgere.Not everything hitable is marked on a map so go slow till you have a good route.Set up your transducer and offset your lower unit.Otherwise your good to go.
6629348,RLundin,2022-01-30 10:39:00,22,Does anyone have a chip map recommendation that covers these lakes? My friend who is pulling his boat to the resort just bought a new Hummingbird Helix 7 (his first mapping fish finder).
6629354,prov1800,2022-01-30 10:58:00,5010,That hummingbird will have the mapping on it.Basically there all about the same.There are some buoys out in the lakes just get familiarrized with what the colors mean and with way your travelling example up or down stream.Woukdnt hurt to get a guide if one is available be a quick way to lay some routes down.Cheaper than a lower unit.
6629362,RLundin,2022-01-30 11:24:00,22,Don't you need to buy a lake map chip for the Hummingbird? Looks like Lakemaster and Navionics are pretty popular. They are sold by USA or Canada regions.
6629378,Old Timer,2022-01-30 13:01:00,255,"I recall back in the 1950's the chutes having a wooden walkway along one side. It was necessary in high water to pull boats through the swift water. Back then, an 18 or 25hp was a big outboard. Most fishermen were using 10-15 hp motors. From what I see from posted videos the walkway is gone and the shoreline is rip-rapped. It's been more than fifty years since I've fished those waters. In the 60's I moved on to other lakes and flowages. In case you're wondering, yes, the fishing above and below the chutes was very good back then, especially in the late afternoon and early evening. Another favorite hotspot was below McDougall Falls."
6629384,prov1800,2022-01-30 13:40:00,5010,They ended up blasting a channel right along the shore.Closer to shore the better but spooky in the beginning.
6628724,RLundin,2022-01-28 08:21:00,22,"Planning a trip to stay on Abrams lake and also fish Minnitaki in mid June 2022. Haven't been to Canada in 8-10 years and have never fished these lakes, so looking for a little guidance. How deep would you guess the Walleye would be this time of year? What kind of structure are you typically fishing? Anything unique about these lakes that might help my planning? Thank You"
6628734,prov1900,2022-01-28 08:31:00,544,"Walleyes should still be relatively shallow, especially on windblown shorelines. Minnitaki has a number of reefs that almost always produce as well. Get a map and study it. It can be an amazing lake trout fishery, as well as all the other usual species. If you have a boat that can make long runs, SW Bay and Redpine can be dynamite. Navigation wise, a chip is useful because there are hazards here/there. You should have an outstanding trip. Beautiful lake and area."
6628844,x4flatfish,2022-01-28 12:31:00,319,"Be aware if you are staying on Abrahms and plan to boat to Minitaki that you will have to go through ""the Chutes"". This can be daunting if you have never done it. Some advice or help from locals showing the way would be helpful...beautiful area and great fishing..."

6628882,Yellowfin123,2022-01-28 14:48:00,2182,that would be a little creepy running over that
6628918,walleyeguy3,2022-01-28 16:44:00,42,It's actually a ton of fun. Can't remember if going up is more fun than coming down. All I remember is that you hug the shoreline on your starboard side both ways.
6628932,Guest,2022-01-28 18:34:00,0,Abram lake.
6628934,CI_Guy,2022-01-28 18:47:00,2118,Abrams shute can be easy or a challenge depending on the water levels. In June it should be fairly high and easier to navigate. Going down is more challenging than going up. If your motoring to slow the back of the boat tries to pass the front. On Minitaki look for islands with wind blowing into shore with gravel and weeds on the islands and you'll find bass or walleye biting.

All I remember is that you hug the shoreline on your starboard side both ways.Actually you hug the south side of the Chutes both ways and stay up on plane. You can always fish awhile in sight of it and watch a few boats go through.
6628998,eyecatcher1,2022-01-29 07:28:00,323,There's always fish at the bottom of the Chute too. Just fish at the edge of the fast water. Same deal at Frog Rapids.
