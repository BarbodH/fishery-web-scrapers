I've searched this morning a little and didn't find it. I think that it boiled down to this : If you are driving to return to the US, you do not need to perform any sort of testing.If you are flying back (say from Winnipeg, or where ever), you are required to show proof of a negative test from no earlier than the day before your flight. Basically, if you fly out on a Monday, you have to have completed a tele-health monitored rapid test at some point on Sunday. These kits can be purchased online for about $60 a test, and it includes the telehealth service.Does anyone know if pharmacies in Canada sell these tests? I think I will plan on bringing them up with me, but would be good to know if others can be purchased locally in Canada."
