6626810,Joek3,2022-01-21 11:42:00,244,"6' 3"" St Croix Avid - MLXF for all my vertical jigging up to 3/8 oz. Reel is Shimano Stradic 2500. 8lb Fluoro."
6626812,Eckohlt,2022-01-21 11:46:00,3685,Moondog get a Gloomis glx and use that 782sr1 as a back up.
6626814,NM_Trout,2022-01-21 11:59:00,1094,"I'm more frugal. I can't justify an expensive rod for my skill level. For my backup rods, anything IM7 or better, 6'6"", fast action, medium power. I like to build rods, and the mud hole MHX Elite blanks are pretty nice. Shimano symmetry 3000 with 15lb braid and 10lb flouro."
6626992,SJC305,2022-01-22 05:34:00,154,St Croix Avid 6'6 Medium Light Fast with a Piscifun Carbon X 2000. Starter combo was a Triumph ML-Fast with Pflueger President 6920. Had 10 years on it and only had to replace springs/felt drag washers to Carbontex.
6627064,prov1800,2022-01-22 09:08:00,5010,Loþ of rod and reel options out there.I do use the the st Croix tournaments and is definatly a good rod and fairly expensive but not like some out there.I do use there mojos and eyecons which are also very good still bit of money but worth it still.The expensive rods do give you a better feel no doubt about it.I let my guests use my good rods if they are loosing fish on the other rods and will say they catch more fish.As far as reels go nowadays there all good in my book.Ive been usiñg the Abu Garcia orra 20 reels and they are inexpensive and smooth.I have some expensive models and they are great but not much different.
