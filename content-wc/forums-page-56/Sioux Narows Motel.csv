6318362,nitroman,2019-05-06 09:57:00,368,I received an email (not even a phone call)from the owner of Sioux Narrows Motel stating that my reservation that I made in October for 4 rooms will not be honored due to a situation on their end. I called and found out that they had signed a contract with a construction crew and were not able to rent out most of their rooms now. I thought this was pretty crappy thing to do to us a month out from our trip knowing how tough it will be for us to find Friday night accommodations for 11 people. To those I that recommended either on here or at the sports shows to stay with them that will be affected as well I apologize. I did reply to them that they have now proven themselves unreliable and will never have my business again. if they did it to me once who's to say they wont again. On a good note I called arrowhead resort and she worked some magic and squeezed us in. So thank you Arrowhead resort and if this works out this year we will reserve our Friday night with them from now on!
6318378,That Minnesota guy,2019-05-06 10:33:00,8293,Yep thats a tough situation to have happen. I would be disappointed also. But from their point of view it's one room vs renting rooms for weeks if not months. Easy choice on their part. Glad you found other accommodations.
6318576,port1042,2019-05-06 18:35:00,509,We have stayed at Arrowhead on Friday night many times. They'll take good care of you.
6318590,Thompmd,2019-05-06 19:01:00,320,"With all due respect it doesn't matter if someone called and wanted to book more rooms. To me it's like my resort calling to say hey, we got what we feel is a better offer, sorry about your luck. Like the OP, good riddens and arrowhead just gained a new costumer. Maybe I'm old fashioned but once they took the reservation, then that room or rooms are now booked. If not the motel should have never accepted in the first place."
6318656,kettyspanky,2019-05-07 04:49:00,271,"I agree totally. If you make a reservation, its your room. I feel for you but glad to hear you found another place to stay. Hopefully your new reservations work out excellent for you."
6318704,Shellback,2019-05-07 06:25:00,8083,So the hotel is putting all their eggs in one basket. You know how that may end up. So what will the business do once the construction project is up?
6318732,bigwalleye1,2019-05-07 07:39:00,2632,"You have reserved a room, now someone that wants more rooms than are available comes at (relatively speaking) the last minute and demands the owner boots others with standing reservations? Seems to me a pretty chitty thing for the motel to do. What's the point of the reservation, then??? They say there's no such thing as bad ink. I respectfully disagree, and hope their decision was worth it to them. What are they gonna do for next year, when the construction job is over???"
6627994,nitroman,2022-01-25 13:25:00,368,Update: so we really liked Arrowhead and Tammy and Monte were great hosts. So much that my wife and I are going up to spend the better part of the week with them before our normal week at Cedar. looking forward to just my wife and I fishing together and seeing a new lake after 20+ years at Cedar. Our Friday night stay with the group will be at the northside motel in V-bay as Arrowhead was booked this year. Always an adventure and we love it!
6628382,Bill Krejca,2022-01-27 06:53:00,6107,Gonna be at the sports show at Cedar Falls this year? Bill
6628496,nitroman,2022-01-27 11:25:00,368,"As a spectator not a vendor. I don't believe they are doing any shows this year. A bit sad as i do love working the show, it's fun to talk fishing all day and meet new friends!"
