6629002,dakota eye,2022-01-29 07:44:00,69,Great video John! I so need to fish with you next summer buddy!
6629006,prov1800,2022-01-29 08:02:00,5010,Anything is possible with border open.This vid was last year's opener with my son.I suspect it's going to be a whole lot busier this spring.Have to admit it was a great ride.Fishing the big lakes was like being at a flyout with my boat.
6629086,x4flatfish,2022-01-29 13:16:00,319,"Nice video...but please if you have to smoke, don't throw the butts in the lake..."
6629088,KC Walleye,2022-01-29 13:24:00,274,"Didn't expect to see that. Gotta say, you should probably delete that video and ask for this thread to be removed. You will catch a ton of flack for that."
6629150,prov1800,2022-01-29 15:56:00,5010,"Bring it on.Its a butt.Have used them for bait.What about all the fuel thats spilled in the water.Exhaust from outboard,oil leaking from engines.septic feilds people pi**ing in the water,.come on.its a butt that will disinagrade."
6629186,Da' Walleye Assassun,2022-01-29 18:34:00,358,No one wants to see your smelly butt in the lake.
6629188,Laketripper,2022-01-29 18:41:00,103,I think it's more the act of littering that might get people's goat.I would bet there are more artificial baits in the water than cigarette butts .I've found many hookless crank baits while I was wandering along shorelines. Best find were two cans of Heinekin beer on Tegau Lake. I wondered what the story was behind them but drank them just the same. A solution for the cigarette butt disposal would be to have a coffee can partially filled with water while smoking in the boat and disposing them in a proper manner once ashore.
6629190,prov1800,2022-01-29 18:42:00,5010,Gauranteed you'll never see it
6629196,prov1800,2022-01-29 18:45:00,5010,Usually what I do.
