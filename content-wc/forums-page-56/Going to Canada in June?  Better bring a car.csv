6629010,Larry S,2022-01-29 08:07:00,665,Would love to meet you John. We are flying out on Saturday May 28th to Antenna Larry
6629012,prov1800,2022-01-29 08:13:00,5010,I tend to be there often.lol.
6629312,Mojo-NC,2022-01-30 08:42:00,1929,"We've experienced the same issue with expensive rentals that are just for driving up to our fishing destination and being parked for a week. We have 4 guys plus tackle and gear, so we have to get a 4-door truck, a large SUV, or a minivan, all of which are pretty darn expensive. If rental vehicles are going to be in high demand, that will make the trip even more difficult/frustrating.I've wondered why some high school or college kid doesn't advertise to haul fishermen up to their destinations and make a quick $200-300 or so each way, not including gas (we'd pay for that also). I think we'd probably do it. We've flown into INL, Minneapolis, Duluth, and Winnipeg. We prefer INL, but the cost to fly there has more than doubled over the years. It's fairly cheap to fly to MSP, but the extra 5 hours driving each way to INL is brutal, especially after a week of hard fishing. Even flying into INL requires us to get up at about 4:00 AM, leave RDU at 6:30 to fly to MSP, wait for our connecting flight, fly to INL, rent a vehicle upon arrival, get groceries for the trip, go through customs, and finally drive the additional 3 hours to Dryden for the night. We complete the drive to our destination in Ear Falls early Saturday morning. On the way home, we have to drive all the way from Ear Falls to INL (about 5 hours) to catch our flight home. We get up about 5:00 AM, drive to INL, then fly to MSP, then finally home to NC. We generally arrive home around 10:30 PM to midnight, depending on the flights. It has worked for us for many years but it turns out to be a very long week."
6628780,NM_Trout,2022-01-28 10:36:00,1094,"I was second guessing my decision to fly into Winnipeg on my upcoming trip. I found some earlier flights arriving International Falls. With the testing required to fly back to the US, I thought that it might be less hassle to fly into INL and drive across. I went to look at rental car availability for June..... and... .nope. Zero. No rental cars available if you are arriving on a Saturday and leaving on a Monday. Just for grins, I looked to see if I could find a car for a mid week pickup, and a 7 day rental was almost $1000. Wow. I wonder if rental car companies realize we mostly don't care if the car is older, as long as it is reliable. I feel for the resort and outpost owners. They really don't need another barrier to income this summer."
6628798,RichA$1970,2022-01-28 10:58:00,1159,Chip capacity is driving the rental car constraints which sucks but it is industry wide. Could fly into the twin cities for more rental options but a longer drive. Some will just say Fâ€™it on the hassle of going to Canada with getting the vaccinations & testing which is sad but so many are fed up with more red tape.
6628800,Yellowfin123,2022-01-28 11:02:00,2182,"plus the rental companies sold off alot of their cars in the latter part of 2020, at least enterprise did"
6628804,Larry S,2022-01-28 11:06:00,665,"Going to fly into Minneapolis on May 26 and drive up to Vermillion Bay for a Fly-in trip with Clarks outposts Rates on Costco Travel for 10 days are $500 which is split between myself & sister. Have booked a car Last year in August ,flew into Duluth and rented a car for our trip fishing to Mattice Ogoki reservior Paid $500 for 10 days at Costco Travel If you have Costco account sign up for travel account Larry S"
6628864,NM_Trout,2022-01-28 13:49:00,1094,"I booked my rental car back in November out of Winnipeg for 8 days. That rental normally costs me about $300. All the ""cheap"" cars were rented out. they were left with SUVs and better, and a SUV was $650. Seemed like overkill for just two of us. My other option was a luxury class car, which is BMW 3-Series or equivalent. I was bummed at having to pay $480 for it. Seems like a steal now."
6628878,Eckohlt,2022-01-28 14:36:00,3685,What state do you live in may I ask?
6628906,prov1800,2022-01-28 16:06:00,5010,Which outpost you headed to Larry
6628916,NM_Trout,2022-01-28 16:34:00,1094,New Mexico. Only a 1726 mile drive to Red Lake ON. :-(
6628922,Eckohlt,2022-01-28 17:00:00,3685,That would be a road trip for sure
6628988,Larry S,2022-01-29 06:48:00,665,"Hey John, Headed with my sister to Antenna. I have fished a number of Clarks Outpost Lakes in the past when other Camps had them. Among the lakes are Bertrand, Shabumeni, Dorothy and Kapikick. Keep up the great posting, always enjoy your posts Larry S"
