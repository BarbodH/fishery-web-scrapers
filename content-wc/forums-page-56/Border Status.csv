6626522,PRO-V16,2022-01-20 15:17:00,454,There were. We took COVID tests and filled out ArriveCan before getting there. No problem crossing. Coming back to the US they just asked if we had fun fishing.

6628148,bellbuoy,2022-01-26 06:15:00,490,"We have a debate among our group going in July, one guys says we need a negative COVID test to re-enter the US. Did you find that to be true?"
6628152,IowaWalleye1978,2022-01-26 06:45:00,96,Back in September we did not need a negative test re-enter the United States.
6628154,Eckohlt,2022-01-26 06:46:00,3685,Passport only
6628158,IowaWalleye1978,2022-01-26 06:53:00,96,Heck I didnt even need my passport as I misplaced it. Of course I found it when I got home!
6628164,eyecatcher1,2022-01-26 07:01:00,323,I was in Canada in August and October 2021 and didn't need anything to return to the US.
6628166,bthomas3333,2022-01-26 07:04:00,465,If you drive. Just passport. If you fly you need a negative test. As of right now... B-

6622374,Freytown,2022-01-05 07:02:00,770,Is the border into Canada open or closed? Yesterday a post said itâ€™s closed until Jan27th
6622388,djk50164,2022-01-05 07:47:00,370,The way I read it is the border is open but Day and overnight camps are closed for 21 days this is for ontario. https://covid-19.ontario.ca/public-health-measures
6622454,Cgillespie,2022-01-05 10:27:00,120,Would there be any guests at a fishing camp this time of year anyways? Maybe some ice fishermen? I would think the situation will change for the better come springtime.
6622732,djk50164,2022-01-06 09:18:00,370,Yes many lodges are full this time of the year with ice fisherman. With all of these lockdowns every aspect of revenue is critical.
6622794,skap,2022-01-06 15:03:00,58,"So I am leaving Tuesday for an ice fishing trip to Sioux Lookout. From my understanding there are no border changes or requirements, at least as of today. Tomorrow who knows. What did change from a lodge standpoint is no more than 5 people in a cabin not related, and lodge employees are not allowed in fish houses etc. with those guests. They can guide, but will need to be on different sleds or whatever you are using for transportation. Sounds like they are just trying to limit the interactions. I believe the ""CAMP"" term listed in the regulations is a reference more to summer / group camps like YMCA etc, not necessarily fishing camps. Although I could be totally wrong."
6625222,Moondog,2022-01-15 11:26:00,362,Did you get to go????
6625254,hoppy63,2022-01-15 13:20:00,367,Any report???
6626046,PRO-V16,2022-01-18 20:52:00,454,I crossed the border at International Falls last Friday and it was painless. Likewise on our return Monday.
6626480,mms3rd,2022-01-20 13:30:00,148,"So, are there no more strict COVID requirements to enter?"
6626486,Eckohlt,2022-01-20 13:58:00,3685,"You wish,just like the rest of us."
