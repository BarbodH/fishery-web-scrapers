I thought I heard there was going to be a change from 2021 requirements. Like I was going to have to bring a state certificate from my home state of Michigan? Thanks for any responses, Doug"
6628654,kettyspanky,2022-01-28 05:16:00,271,Halfmoon that's what I thought also. I thought canada was going to have everyone have a boaters education certificate. I'm wonder what is going on with that. I could get mine done this winter if I need one. Does anyone have any info on this or is it too early yet?
6628662,Juls,2022-01-28 05:49:00,13414,https://www.boat-ed.com/canada/ontario/ Do you need the Pleasure Craft Operator Card? You need education if you will be operating a pleasure craft that has a motor and is used for recreational purposes in Canada. Proof of certification from any NASBLAapproved boating course is acceptable. Transport Canada Requirements There is no minimum age requirement to take this online course. You do not have to be a resident of Canada to take this online course.
6628678,Cover Dog,2022-01-28 06:31:00,303,"The following paragraph was taken from the Canadian boat operator competency requirements for US citizens.If you are bringing your own motorboat from the US into Canada - The competency certificate regulations do not apply to non-residents who operate their US registered or documented pleasurecraft in Canada waters for less than 45 consecutive days. You must carry proof of US residency, and your state watercraft registration card or US Coast Guard documentation certificate with you at all times when you are on the water."

6628700,walleyecheek,2022-01-28 07:25:00,2231,not many of us stay 45 consecutive days !
6629072,halfmoon007,2022-01-29 12:58:00,121,"Thanks for the responses. I read up on the links you shared. So it looks like no changes from 2021. My only confusion would be we take my brothers boat and he is grand fathered in in Michigan not needing boater safety certificate (born 1960), So is he OK in Ontario also? We wont be in 45 days but were getting there, It will be 28 days fishing plus 3 travel trips. Thanks again Doug"
6629090,Cover Dog,2022-01-29 13:29:00,303,"It Has to be 45 “consecutive” days before you’ll need a certificate. Yes, he will be fine in Ontario."
