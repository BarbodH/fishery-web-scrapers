Still had a good bite catching 30 or so in the 3 hours I was there.Cheap day for Clarks using 2 stickler backs.lol.Used the hair jigs again from Bill and they worked very well again as did the vibratos.Had a white out a few times and coukd barely see the shoreline.Good thing its only 100 yrs from shack or I might off got lost.

6628562,prov1800,2022-01-27 16:11:00,5010,That was one tough stickle back. I really can't beleive people would through them out and not use them.
