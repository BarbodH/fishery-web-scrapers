6627726,prov1800,2022-01-24 11:09:00,5010,On the contrary.catch lots.proven fact in my boat.Was ice fishing with skywagon last week and he had a couple of stickle backs in his minnow pail and i caught crappies right awày on them when regular minnows failed and phony baits.Always find a few of them in the pail when i fish the shack at Clarks.If I pull one out I have no problem putting one on the hook.Got to be something to it when some of the fish I clean have stomachs packed with them.
6627996,nitroman,2022-01-25 13:28:00,368,I shall try them for Crappie this year if I find one. After years of no luck with them on walleye we began weeding them out in the bait house as we all felt they were not productive.

6626686,Bakefish,2022-01-21 07:12:00,1077,"I saw on another post about catching lake trout on sticklebacks (prov1800). I have never, I mean never caught a fish on a stickleback, although I've never tried them for lake trout. One time we were catching perch non stop but couldn't catch even one on sticklebacks. We ran out of minnows and I put a smashed, dried up minnow on and caught a perch, but still couldn't catch a fish on a stickleback. Anyone else have luck with them?"
6626696,Clairebear,2022-01-21 07:27:00,937,"Here in Ontario, of the four species only one is legal to be used as bait. I've had success with them over the years. Once on the hook they are good for many hookups. A very tough minnow.https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/species-es...l#sticklebacks"
6626700,eyecatcher1,2022-01-21 07:29:00,323,I've had them mixed in with my minnows in Canada and never had a problem catching walleyes with them.
6626718,guidedfishing,2022-01-21 08:27:00,531,"Yeah, I don't have success with them, It maybe as soon as I discover one I refuse to put it on my hook lol."
6626820,prov1800,2022-01-21 12:10:00,5010,First thing my wife looks for in the bucket.The other in my buddies ice shack I caught all the crappies on a stickler back.Had plenty of lookers with plastic on and regular minnows but woukd obly take the stickler backs.And they are way tougher.But every year I clean lake trout and there stomachs are packed with them.i woukd never through one out.
6627008,Bill Krejca,2022-01-22 06:46:00,6107,"Hmph! Yeah, really a surprise re: John's comment on sticklebacks. I personally have had no luck using them, but have not tried them for trout. Re: trout eating them - Since most trout waters fall into the infertile water category, the availability of abundant small fish food is generally low. That said, my guess is that any small fish is fair game. But what do I know. Bill"
6627026,prov1800,2022-01-22 07:53:00,5010,"Most bait dealers dont sell stickle back minnows but with the thousands of dozens minnows they bring in a few stickle backs make it into the tanks.When I go to Clarks for my minnows ill scope up some in the net and make a point of trying to find some.As I mentioned earlier if theres any in our bucket my wife is going to use them.Most fisherman just dont want anything to do with them and throw them overboard.Once on the hook they tènd to last longer than a regular minnow you can feel how tough they are putting the hook in them.There isn't a fish here that won't èat them.Bill most of my trout fishing happens on Cliff Lake.Yes it's a deep lake and not very fertile in about 65% of the lake but the other parts of it are very fertile with lush weed beds and lots of growth.Allthough not known for its other species like walleyes,smallmouth Bass,Pike and of course muskie it is a very good lake for them as well.Some of the ĺargest fish I've caught have come from Cliff Lake.Have you ever fished there Bill."
6627318,Bill Krejca,2022-01-23 07:55:00,6107,"RE: Feel them - Yeah, they definitely feel ""tough"" when hooking them, sorta ""rough"" skinned. No, John, I never fished Cliff Lake, thought it might be worth trying for trout, tho. My lake trout fishing has been pretty limited, have fished Crow, Sturgeon, Sahli (Sask.), Sishtose(sp?), and LOW, I remember when the cool lady ran one of the camps on Cliff for a short time, she gave a report on some pretty good walleye fishing she had at the other end from the road, met her at a sports show, and lots of on-line communication. Bill"
6627326,prov1800,2022-01-23 08:09:00,5010,"Think you would love a day there.Tough walleye fishing at times but over the years I have found a few spots I can count on.Spring opener usually finds my wife and myself there.Have a few great spots and can catch lots at that time of the year.Very rewarding times with some beautifull walleyes with brilliant colors typical of a deep trout lake.Usually many over the 25"" mark.Crystall clear water and can sight fish them usually.Mainly a crankbait bite and be prepared to loose a few to muskies.Summer/fall still can have a good bite in certain spots on structure and in the numerous weed beds."
