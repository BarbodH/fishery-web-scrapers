The USDA (Dept. of Agriculture) offers many cabins located in the Chugach and Tongass forests in SE Alaska. These are primitive cabins that are not much more than a place to lay your head, but are located very remotely in some of the most beautiful areas you can imagine. They have no electricity, no running water, no mattresses and no stove, but do offer quite a unique experience. I had the opportunity to make two of these trips back in the 80's and early 90s' when the cost was $15/night. We flew into Ketchican and then hopped a float plane to Prince of Wales Island. We picked Prince of Wales Island because it had no brown bears. There were gigantic black bears, but no browns. In our first trip we had our own Alpine type lake and river. Fishing is for salmon and various trout. No walleye. Fishing is unbelievable. How would you like to sight fish to literally thousands of salmon? You'd be wise to do some extensive research before going, but with the internet it shouldn't be too bad. Back in the day all of my research had to be done via the USPS. If you're interested here's a link to get you going.https://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/ton...8613&actid=101"

As it was last minuet the cabin was 9 - 10 miles from the trail head. The day before ignoring warnings and common sense I had drunk from a glacial stream. Who would have thought that the ice worms could affect a young buck like me? That day we also ignored large glacier active do not approach warning signs. We took a picture of me and my buddy in a bright blue ice cave. As we descended a little later the most thundering crash send me sprawling. Looking back were house sized chunks of the glacier crashing near our photo opp spot. We were unprepared for the hike clothing wise with the constant rain. We were carrying our .45 caliber bear spray and as I said we were invincible. We eventually found the cabin but every fork in the trail as well as frequent scat played on my mind. The worms had begun to do their worst on my gut and between my sweat from the fever and the rain that day was one I won't forget. Probably first on my mind was building a fire with the rain soaked wood that surrounded us. When we opened the cabin door the wood stove was still burning from the previous nights tenant. Dry wood was stacked near the stove we stoked it up and my buddy hunted up a new pile to replace it and begin to dry. I pulled a sleeping bag out of a garbage bag that we had trussed into makeshift packs. Happy to find it and a change of clothes still dry, I hung my coat and blue jeans near the stove. I crawled in the sleeping bag and slept away the fever. The next day was glorious. fifteen feet from the cabin was a creek with red bodied green headed sockeye so densely packed it seemed as though you could walk their backs across the stream with out getting your boots wet. Yes those were the days. My last 8 trips to Alaska have been to a little better suited to a getting older man and I might suggest yo give a look at https://docwarners.com/"

I think it was called the ""Matagorda Bay"" area. Likely spelling that wrong. We would wade fish the shallows with bait and catch all sorts of fish. Flounder, sand trout, redfish, you never know. He told me to buy a stringer that was 12 to 16 feet long. Like a complete noob, I asked him how many fish we should expect to catch. He laughed at me and said ""No.... you want your fish to be at the end of a very long stringer and well away from your leg when a shark comes by to take them."" I remember thinking ""I need a hobby where I am closer to the top of the food chain."" I feel that way about brown and grizzly bears. No thanks. I never did have an issue with sharks, although my boss's wife got bit by a rattlesnake out on one of the islands when they were fishing. They were a few hours away from medical assistance, and this was back before everybody carried a cell phone. She ended up ok, but went through some hellacious pain for quite awhile in recovery."

That being said I feel like my life gets a complete restart the moment that float plane flys off leaving us with our rafts, camping gear, shot guns amongst Alaska wilderness. Restart is like like getting paddled an coming back to life being married to a super model. Fly ins in NW Ontario are great but knowing griz shares the river adds a layer of excitement that is unmatched in lower 48. I cannot describe the salmon runs. You have heard about fish so thick you can walk across them. Yep! On our last trip we only caught 6 different species prior trips have been 7-9."
6628226,RichA$1970,2022-01-26 10:27:00,1159,Always wanted to do a float trip but the $$$$ is just so much Iâ€™d rather do 3-4 Ontario trips.
6628234,Eckohlt,2022-01-26 10:47:00,3685,Spot on
6628300,NM_Trout,2022-01-26 16:37:00,1094,"Wow. What time of year do you go? I had a trip booked for my daughter and myself in 2020 to go to the Yukon on a trip for lakers / pike / grayling / dolly varden and covid crashed into that. I picked the lodge that I did as it was more of a full service camp, and it was on a big lake. We would be exposed to bears only a little bit depending on which water we were fishing. Hoping to still go one day. The owner has promised that my deposit will be good."
6628322,Eckohlt,2022-01-26 18:35:00,3685,"Exposed to bears a little bit!it only takes one bear to do damage,but the fishing does sound like a blast,I caught grayling up on nueltin lake,and most were over 19 inches it was unreal,if you go on your trip stay safe."
6628332,NEBRASKA JOHN,2022-01-26 19:15:00,179,Go to South Dakota!
