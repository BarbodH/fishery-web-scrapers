6629390,Eckohlt,2022-01-30 13:51:00,3685,Was that 3-5 lakers per person or for the group per day?
6629398,prov1800,2022-01-30 14:05:00,5010,Would think per person Rod.Pretty good fishing there.
6629468,AMPHIB206,2022-01-30 20:13:00,191,3-5 per person. Per day. We would be marking fish most of the day from 40-100 ft. Reel up hope they'll whack it. Due to the frigid temperatures; we were hunkered down in the heated tent. Because we were set up on a steep drop off; our plan was to fish outside there tent; shallower and below the drop off. Apparently the walleye lakes are stacked; but I can't verify that til I go back.
6628372,AMPHIB206,2022-01-27 06:28:00,191,"I had the opportunity to partake in a 4-day ice fishing adventure out of Vermillion Bay with a couple of buddies. After navigating our way to NWO, the owner Wayne, met us north of town on the ice at Clay Lake. This is where we parked and unloaded. He told us to follow the snowmobile trail for 40 miles until you reach a cabin with smoke coming out of the chimney. He left ahead of us to break a trail into walleye lakes for us and marked the spots with spruce boughs. The lake trout spots on Anishinabi were pre-set up with insulated six-man tents with elevated wood floors. 20 pounds of propane and sunflower heaters were already in the tents. The generator, wood stove and cabin were all ready for us when we arrived 2.5 hours later. The snowmobile ride in was incredible. 3 miles across Clay Lake, and then into the woods for 36 miles of a single-track snowmobile trail made up of old mining/logging roads and trapper's trails. The snow was 3ft deep on either side of the trail. Saw a moose and an otter on the trail. Whiskey jacks awaited us at Anishinabi Lodge. The cabin was clean and getting warm when we pulled into the Lodge. The cabin was equipped with a propane fridge and stove; wood heat with cords of split birch and jack pine stacked in the woodshed was the source of warmth. What a great aroma to come back to every day. A ceiling fan kept the warm air moving into each room. Our cabin slept atleast 9. The wood fired sauna was a great way to end the day. It got up to 125 degrees in 20 minutes and then we dumped a pail of snow on the rocks to really sweat it out. Fishing Anishinabi Lake was a treat as most lake trout are between 25-32 inches. 22 inches of ice. The water was crystal clear. We could see our tube jigs down the hole at the 32 ft mark. Using primarily 4-6 white tube jigs tipped with a 4 sucker minnow gave us results. Had to keep the bait moving as the lakers loved to chase it. Fished from 65 -100ft. 3 of us caught between 3-5 lakers every day. We only fished from 10-3:30 daily. That much fresh air makes you tired. We battled temperatures of -30c, deep snow on the lake and random pockets of slush. On our last day out of Anishinabi, Wayne drove 45 minutes to wait for us at the trailhead, to make sure we made it off the trail safely. He secured a set of jumper cables for a truck that would not go after 4 days of extreme temperatures. We will be back, next time it will be in March to enjoy warmer weather and longer days. The adventure is not for rookies. You need reliable snowmobiles, extra straps, basic tools (although the lodge probably has what you would need) and survival equipment in case you break down. Cell service was available on the lake in most places. A satellite phone is available. There is Wi-Fi within close proximity of the main lodge building. Oh, and Dutchies is a very scenic ride if need to get the closest LCBO; however, you may have to break trail to get your fill of Labatt's. Here's a few pics for your appetite."

6628410,Eckohlt,2022-01-27 07:50:00,3685,Any eyes?
6628440,AMPHIB206,2022-01-27 08:56:00,191,Anishinabi is surrounded by walleye lakes; the trails that were made into the lakes for us were blown in by huge wind the day after we arrived. We couldn't find the trail across the lake to hit the trail entrance. Uggh. I'm a walleye guy. I wanted to hit them hard. The elements of January weather negated that opportunity. I'll be back for walleye.
