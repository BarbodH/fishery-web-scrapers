We are scheduled to fly in June 3rd. Just wondering what tips and strategies people have for early June fishing in lakes north of Nakina? This will be my groups first fly in trip so we are really excited. Half our group likes pike fishing and the other half walleye. Thanks!"

Possibly back bays and shallow shoals that have gravel. North end of Ara looks interesting. The entrance to the Meta River. The lodge owners should know. The pattern should be fairly consistent."
6628766,jbohne,2022-01-28 10:12:00,6,Thanks Adam! Any favorite baits to throw early season? I was thinking 1/8 jigs with paddle tails or twister tails.
6628774,NM_Trout,2022-01-28 10:27:00,1094,"That is a pretty small jig. I use 3/8oz with 3 to 4"" plastics."
6628834,Eckohlt,2022-01-28 12:16:00,3685,"That will get it done,shallow water equals light jig"
6629032,REG,2022-01-29 09:34:00,445,"This is the way. In early June they should be mostly shallow. Anywhere from really shallow to 12 ft. But try all depths to see where they are. And if they're being finicky, take off the plastic and put a minnow on that 1/8th jig if you have them.."
6629092,adempsey2.0,2022-01-29 13:33:00,611,"That sounds good to me! Probably lean toward the smaller side, from 2 to 3"" grubs and paddle tails. The 3"" is probably a go to, but it never hurts to have a pack or two of smaller 2"" and 2.5"" just in case. I might have a range of jig sizes depending on my target depth (1/8 to 1/2 oz). You never really know what depth they will be at any time of the year. Usually shallow, but not always. Also, targeting current is always ideal. So if I am fishing below some rapids or falls, I will use a heavier jig."
