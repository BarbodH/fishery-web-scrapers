6628026,Eckohlt,2022-01-25 15:43:00,3685,Water levels were perfect last Oct on press lake.
6628030,That Minnesota guy,2022-01-25 15:58:00,8293,Hard to guess water levels when it's still snowing every other day.
6628066,Pooch,2022-01-25 18:28:00,4618,Just pushing buttons. no more no less. Pooch
6628202,wmd,2022-01-26 08:37:00,388,"My guess is water levels will be 10-12 inches higher than same time last year. Site was getting a little boring, keep pushing those buttons. wmd"
6628492,Laketripper,2022-01-27 11:11:00,103,Referencing to NW Ontario waters only...I can say if we have a repeat of last years weather the water levels won't increase.Snowfall is up from last year's numbers but that will only give a short term increase in water levels...need the early spring rain and lots of it.Water levels in my area peaked high in June with a 12 inch increase and by November I watched it drop to below early May level.My area is a good 3 feet below what I consider to be normal water level.Great for improving on dock systems but not so good for securing boats. Some of the lodges couldn't get their docking systems in place so they could open up for business.

6628518,Laketripper,2022-01-27 12:31:00,103,Good planning on your part.The dock builders and suppliers out here might be in for a banner season.
