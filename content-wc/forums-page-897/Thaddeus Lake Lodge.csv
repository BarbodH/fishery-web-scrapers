Bad news first: we had terrible weather; one fast moving front after another; caught enough walleye to eat, with some northern and small mouth mixed in, but nothing to write home about. However...Talked to three groups who had come to lodge for 5 years, 6 years and 9 years and all said (independently) that normal would be about 50 walleye per day per boat. I believe them.Owners Rocky and Angie are about as nice as can be. Cabins are spotless. Dock, launching area is first class. Boats looked very good (we brought our own, however). Rocky spent each evening going to the cabins and would spend 15-30 minutes with each, if you wanted him to. Talked fishing, hot spots, baits, whatever you wanted to do.Thaddeus Lake is easy to fish...a couple of major reefs, then rocky shorelines and weed edges...mostly trolled with little joe spinners and crawlers or minnows. Two other lakes in the chain...Ord and Moose. Had a very good day on Moose (nice boat ride)with about 20 walleye from 16"" up to 26"", plus some nice northern in the 8 lb range. Bottom Line: I am going back this summer the last part of June and first part of July. Taking 2 sons and 1 daughter in law. If you need more info, feel free to e-mail me at [email protected] and I will be glad to tell you more. Think spring."

We fished shoreline and caught many eating size fish, and caught a bigger fish on the reefs. Also very good smallmouth fishin along the rocky shorelines. The only bad part was the road leading to the resort. Unless they fixed it in the last couple years, its the worst 20 mile stretch of gravel road I've ever been on. But worth the trip."

There are some Big Northerns in ord and we caught a 20lb+ Muskie on moose. The second year we caught lots of eater walleye and thaddeus and and had some huge muskies follow. One group we talked to were having a hard time finding and catching walleyes under 25"". The resort doesnt want you keeping fish over 18""."
