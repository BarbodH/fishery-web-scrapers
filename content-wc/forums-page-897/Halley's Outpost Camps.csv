526558,Guest,2003-01-20 14:57:00,0,We have stayed at the Caribou Falls camp (drive in) two years and find it a real nice operation. Would recommend it to anyone. They are a reputable outfit so would imagine the fly in operation is well done.Paul

526560,greg,2003-02-14 20:07:00,107,I stayed at their drive in camp-they could have cared less if I lived or died-I have fished many different places-this is only place I would never go back to due to indifferent service
526561,Guest,2003-02-28 21:49:00,0,I have been to Rex lake outpost Roger lake and one man lake. One man lake is an american plan very well run good food great walleye fishing full service. Rex was an outstanding smallie experience with a very difficult portage to little rex for walleyes. roger was a great walley lake with some pretty good sammllmouth. I have had great times at halleys.
