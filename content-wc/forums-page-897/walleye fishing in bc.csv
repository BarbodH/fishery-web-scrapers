528223,fuzzhead,2003-03-04 17:36:00,4,A friend and I are driving to ak the first part of june. We will be taking hwy 93 to Jasper and then travel yellowhead hwy to kitwanga and then cassiar hwy to the ak hwy. I would like to do some walleye fishing. Is there any good walleye fishing on this route?
528224,Superdad,2003-03-04 20:36:00,64,I think the walleye in BC are in the south-eastern portion of the Province. The Columbia River starts in BC and that's where I recall people talking about walleyes a few years ago.David Delcloo aka Superdad

Sometimes I got lucky and found some pretty awesome stuff.The route you are taking, won't take you near any walleyes, in BC, but Alberta has some excellent walleye fishing...east of your route.Great scenery where you are headed, 'tho."
