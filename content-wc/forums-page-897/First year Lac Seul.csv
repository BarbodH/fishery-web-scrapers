527487,Guest,2003-02-27 08:46:00,0,"Did youm get the hooks? Looking forward to the summer, Ole' 2 Dogs is getting the feaver by now. See you guys soon."
527488,Big Fish,2003-02-27 09:09:00,138,"I got 'em. Thanks, Gary. The fever is really starting to hit. cw"
527489,2 DOGS,2003-02-27 18:03:00,361,"Yes, would have to admit it's a toss-up as to which fever is winning right now - cabin or fishing! Have this great idea of trying for some lake trout early on. A fellow showed me a secret spot last year and for an extremely small bribe I'd share it. Up until that little fiasco, his sucess ratio as a guide was pretty good. Now it's gonna take at least 3 new spots to earn back any respect."
527490,Big Fish,2003-02-27 19:51:00,138,You wouldn't be referring to those mythical lake trout on Lac Seul would you?? ha ha cw
527491,Guest,2003-03-03 09:53:00,0,Laugh you guys until that day in nervanna when I find the last trout in the puddle!! Heading north to start getting ready; enough visiting the relatives for this winter.
527479,2 DOGS,2003-02-11 08:13:00,361,"Gonna sleep in opener if it's still cold, I remember last year all too well. Plans are to be there 1st or 2nd week of June."
527470,zugbug,2003-02-21 22:28:00,67,"Whitetip1, Where are you going this year? I will be at Mahkwa on the 22-26 of june, Left the shores of Lake Erie in January and moved back home to Minnesota. Opening up a new Gander Mountain in Bemidji. Prep work is going on now and planning on throwing open the doors on the 8th of April. Stop in and say hey if you are on the way by. Pierre said this year the camp is spending money on the housekeeping side, we'll see. Tight lines, Spike"
527480,Guest,2003-02-22 12:28:00,0,"In general, Jig & Minnows work the best but also cost more. The thing to do is to use the jigs & minnows until yu find them, then if they are active, jigs & leeches will work as good as minnows. Stop in Vermillion Bay and get $60 (5 pounds) of leeches and get minnows at the resort. Don't count the pennies, enjoy your trip.Also, the biggest mistake 1st timers make on Lac Seul is fishing too deep. If your not catching anything, the general trend should be to move shallower... I've drifted in 5' of water and pulled out dozens of fish/ hour."
527473,jimbo,2003-02-22 14:35:00,223,Where are you staying? I will be there same time at DeerPath Lodge by Hudson.
527481,2 DOGS,2003-02-22 16:39:00,361,"T-Mac is giving you good advice. Oftentimes we are even shallower than the 5 feet he mentions. You don't want to have the big motor down all the way. Just remember, resort owners have to turn a profit too, and nothing turns them off any quicker than somebody pulling in with a $35K SUV pulling a $30K boat and then *****ing about $3 minnows yet will run to town and pay $30 for a case of beer. When you go that far for such a short period of time, what's another $10 a day?"
527482,Vitreum,2003-02-22 18:13:00,221,"dogs, the reason they cannot afford the $3 minnows is the 35k wheels and the 30k boat. both financed i'm sure."
527483,Big Fish,2003-02-23 10:41:00,138,"2Dogs, would you be the Larry we see at Evergreen Lodge sometimes? What kind of boat do you drive? cw"
527484,2 DOGS,2003-02-23 12:18:00,361,That would be one and the same. Alumacraft TP 195- that is until I can trade T-Mac out of a 2025. And who is Bigfish? I thought I was the only one that caught those! LOL
527485,Big Fish,2003-02-23 18:06:00,138,I would be the tall guy with the beard in the green 20' crestliner that was at Evergreen off and on all summer. cw
527471,whitetip1,2003-02-24 11:33:00,53,"Spike,Going to Chamberlain Narrows (Ojibway) this year first week in July. Fishing eyes around Mahkwa was spectacular but the group wants to make it a Muskie/Walleye trip. Chamberlain seems to be a better option to find both. Piere should spend some $$$ on the housekeeping side, the shack we were in was definetly in need of repair.Looks like you are going to need to learn some of the lakes around Bemidji now. You sure have many options in that part of the state. I will be fishing Cass a few times this year, I'll swing by the store and look you up if I get the chance.Take Care,Dave"
527466,Guest,2003-02-07 00:25:00,0,"A group of 4-6 of us have been heading up to Ontario the last couple of years. First year was to Eagle Lake and last year we flew out of Red Lake to an outpost. Work a lot of extra hours to finance these trips. Although we caught a lot of fish compared to what I catch in the home waters, it seems that so far we have not had a great week of fishing, 50+ walleyes. This year my father and brother are joining the fun on Lac Seul. We are staying at Golden Eagle Resort, have talked to the owners several times and they seem helpful. Any advice that you can give to make this trip the memory of a lifetime would be appreciated. In the past we have stopped at Cabellas to pick up a flat of crawlers and used them most of the week with a jig or crawler harness. Maybe we are missing the boat by not spending the $3+ for a dozen minnows?"
527467,Guest,2003-02-07 07:27:00,0,"From another IA Boy, I would recommend spending some $$$ on the minnows. Last year was my first trip north and it was still cold enough that minnows and night crawlers were the only things we could get much action on. Check around on where to get minnows, but our outfitter was either 2.00 or 2.50 a dozen. Five of us went through 60 dozen minnows on a 7 day trip, so it did get a little exspensive. We also used four dozen night crawlers and we bought 2 pounds of leaches just in case the water warmed up. In the end, we figured we had caught around 600 walleye, 100 pike and 100 perch in 6 days of fishing."
527468,Mike KS,2003-02-07 07:50:00,18,"IA GUY.....Our group always has good luck with Leechs on Lac Seul. We fish at an outpost and minnows can only be kept alive for a couple days unless it is cool. We have fished with Crawlers but my personal experience is that we catch to many Perch unless we use Leechs/Minnows. We have got Jumbo minnows from Uncle Josh Baits and they seem to work well also even though they are pickled. I think the most important items on Lac Seul are GPS, Depth Finder and good maps. I always look for areas that the wind is my friend on Lac Seul. It seems that if you fish on points or flats that the wind is blowing into they generally hold more fish. We have been going to Lac Seul for years so we have our spots that have been consistent but when we venture to new spots the wind is our primary key. The majority of our fishing is jigs both still and drifting with some back trooling. we go in early June but we used to go in july and that time of the year we had good luck dragging cranks to locate fish and than breaking out the jigs. What time of the year are you going?"
527469,whitetip1,2003-02-07 08:03:00,53,"Went to LS last year and never touched a minnow or crawler. Used nothing but berkely power baits (crawlers, minnow imitations, Grubs on jigs). Caught lots and lots of eye's. Also trolling crankbaits can be very effective."
527474,The_Great_Guide,2003-02-07 10:31:00,24,"There are many recent Lac Suel posts that will give plenty of info. Look back and check them out. Your statement about the minnows piqed my intrest. I don't understand why you would travel all that way and not invest an additional $50 CA about $35.00 US in some minnows? I've caught many fish with crawlers, cranks and leeches, but overall-and by far- minnows are the best producers in any lake that I've fished for W's. TGG"
527475,lunker99,2003-02-07 16:00:00,236,"Hi IA GUY, another one from IA checking in here. We fish Lac Suel in the Ear Falls area the second week of June. We use minnows, leeches, and crawlers when we're up there and all three produce. We do a lot of slip bobber fishing and although day to day the fish might show a slight preference of one bait over another, you'll catch fish with whatever you decide to use. In defense of the minnows though, I will say a big lively chub under a bobber really seems to call those hawgs in!"
527472,Guest,2003-02-07 17:30:00,0,We are going to be up there June 7th - June 14th
527476,2 DOGS,2003-02-07 18:51:00,361,"Ia guy, you'll have your best luck on the jig & minnow or Jig & leech that time of year. Scott will provide you with a map and mark places to fish. I stay there all summer (trailer). Normally, that time of year the fish are still pretty close to the spawning areas and shallow. The old girls may still be a little sluggish from the spawn but you'll have a good time. Catch me on the dock, by the big Alumacraft, and I'll point out a few places to try or you can follow me out. Larry (a former Iowegian, now colorado)"
527477,Guest,2003-02-10 19:12:00,0,oh ya i heard the fish is biting in Muskag Bay
527478,Guest,2003-02-10 19:58:00,0,2 DogsYou going to be there opener or wait for warmer weather?
