527529,walleyesonly,2003-02-20 17:16:00,12,"Lee, Hope I can help you out. All you wanted was a little info and look what you got.I grew up in the Red Lake area and fished both Gull Rock and Red Lake all my life. I still live with in 2.5 hours and fish it all summer including the fall tournament, which I have won and placed in the top ten 8 out of the 11 held. Both Lakes are fantastic. Some years one is better than the other but Gull Rock does hold a good class of 20"" to 25"" fish with fish in the 28"" to 30"" class also, you will love it!!After reading the posts on this subject I do not want to get into the debate that is going on. So if you would like information on where and what presentations to use, maybe a few waypoints. Send me a email.[email protected]"
527530,Guest,2003-02-28 13:41:00,0,"Thank you for the curteous response...yes, I heard more about the difference between Red Lake and Gull Rock than I ever wanted to know!Think summer.LEE"
527531,Guest,2003-03-01 20:22:00,0,"hey!! hey guys, we all know that mid july could be anything from great to the pitts. The really great thing about this area is that by staying on gullrock you have (within 1/2 hour)acsess to Red Lake, Keg Lake Two Island and Chukuni River. If you can't get a feed of fish maybe you should take up another sport. I've fished this chain for 20 years as a local and can attest to the fact that if you go fishless you are not really trying. If you are having trouble(lost, no fish, where to shore lunch) just flag a local. Easy to spot. 16 foot boat, no fancy gear and a rod reel and a jig. see you next summer gus"

527522,Guest,2003-02-10 09:52:00,0,The camp owners on Gullrock have imposed a trophy slot since 1993 they do not let any walleye over 18in. to be brought in to be eaten Red Lake did start this to last year maybe. I my self have seen alot boats from camps on Red Lake fishing on Gullrock if there so many big fish on RL why take the 8-14mi. to GR. Gull Rock and Red Lake I feel are great fishery.
527516,Guest,2003-02-10 19:32:00,0,"Larry S , I was trying to HELP And be Honest ? I have caught walleyes on reefs in Gullrock and Keg as shallow as 5-6' on windy days ( Average 15'), but the better size Walleyes came out of deeper water in RED Lake. This chain of Lakes holds a fall Walleye Tournament out of RED Lake. I don't know the exact No# , but this Tournament has been WON in Red Lake 8 out 10 times ( Approximate ). I Know Bob Goodfollew WON it out of Gull Rock in 1995 or 96 and I don't recall any other years it was WON in Gull Rock. WPGER P.S. Don't forget you put me down first."
527517,Guest,2003-02-10 20:45:00,0,So wpger you come up to GR and fish the lake one week a year for the fall classic big fish kill . everybody know you'll catch big walleye in the deeper clearer water but you might only get 2 bite a day. I wonder how many fish live after being brought up from 50+ ft. I could get into the whole walleye transition on GR the whole season and where the big one hang out but I'll save that for my guest and I won't want wpger to a inside for the next tourny. I might just save a couple fish.PS wpger I know they do everything to release the fish alive but if you were on the lake a couple days after the tourny you'd know the real story.
527523,Guest,2003-02-10 20:47:00,0,"Have fished Gullrock for aprox 20 years. Can't get into the eago bit on which lake is the best. I do know that Gullrock is a relatively easy lake to fish with lots of structure where one is able to always fish regardless of the weather. In visiting with others who fish the lake in my opinion all the resort owners are a great group of people who care not only about the health of their lake but about providing their guests with a fine fishing experience that will encourage a return trip. That's one of the reasons we continue to go back year after year. We have never, never been disapointed. Only one recomendation: Poor preparation produces poor performance."
527519,Larry S,2003-02-10 21:39:00,666,"Wpger,You were trying to HELP and be HONEST?? NO WAY! I didn't put you Down First,only made a comment on your idiotic statement that"" Gullrock ,full of small walleyes in its prime in summer,but Red Lake just north of it is where the action is"".Then all the posters and lodge owners who fish Gullrock and report many large walleyes are liers. And of course you know so much that if someone who has never fished a lake asks about that lake you make snide remarks about this and put him down. This is the last I will say on this subject. I fish for relaxation and enjoyment,not to ego trip and put other fishermen downNevada Walleye Man"
527524,Guest,2003-02-11 11:51:00,0,"The maturity level of those two clowns is second to none. I would like to point out that as a researcher, that Red Lake holds the bigger fish. End of case. Case closed."
527525,Guest,2003-02-11 18:16:00,0,"Russ W , Thank You & I am not a clown. WPGER"
527526,Guest,2003-02-18 15:55:00,0,Russ where did you do your reseach and how often and at what time of the year. I do mine all season long I do agree you will catch bigger walleyes in a deep water lake but not as many I'd rather catch 50- 24in. fish than 2- 28in. fish as far as my ego I'm proud of lake and the guys that fish it and throw the big one back. but when someone (wpgr) says all you catch is 13-18in.fish that hits a nerve like I said before Gullrock & RedLake are great lakes they are conected do you think the fish go back and forth?
527527,Guest,2003-02-19 18:21:00,0,"Camp Owner , I tell you what , pick a day in July or August you fish Gullrock and I fish Redlake ( Two Fish over Slot and Two Fish under Slot , Tag Fish for NO Culling ) ????? WPGER P.S. I said average size 16-18 inchs"
527528,Guest,2003-02-20 07:37:00,0,wpgr I'm sorry but I can't take you up on your offer for 2 reasons 1stI tell my guest to release big fish asap so I must do the same! 2nd If you've been reading the fishing regulations you are only allowed to have one fish over 18in.( Not 2 ) in your possesion!! Ps My ? was for Russ where did he do his reseach and when?
527508,Guest,2003-02-08 17:08:00,0,"Four moderately experienced walleye fisherman with their own boats are considering a trip to Gull Rock Lake in mid July, 2003. Would appreciate advice, experiences, or comments about this area. We are likely to book a cabin at Golden Hook Camp. Thanks!"
527509,Larry S,2003-02-08 17:25:00,666,"Lee,3 of us are going to Gullrock the first week of August,for the first time. Go to the search engine at the top of the page,type in Gullrock Lake ,you will get a lot of useful info Larry S"
527520,Minnow Man,2003-02-09 08:56:00,85,"LeeGo into the archives, page 142 Topic # 3724. Some more info. on Gullrock Lake.Hope this helps.Can hardly wait for open water."
527510,Guest,2003-02-09 09:13:00,0,"Lee , Gull rock full of small walleyes in it's prime in summer , but red lake just north of it is where the action is."
527511,Larry S,2003-02-09 09:37:00,666,"Wrong,wpger,if you consider 30 plus inchers small.Gullrock has many large,and allsizes of walleyes.When you come on this website,at least be honest Larry S"
527521,Thumper,2003-02-09 17:28:00,133,"Hi, LeeI greatly enjoyed the Gull Rock chain. I've only been there in late May/early June before and had a great time. I stay at a different camp, but have heard good things about Golden Hook camp. They're on a South bay of Gull Rock, almost a small lake unto it's self, that has a clay bank on the North shore that yields a good run of early Walleye. There are also numerous islands in the main lake that provide ample opportunities.The water is darkly stained. Between Red Lake and the Gull Rock chain, they're the darkest waters I've ever been on. For us, Oranges work very well on most days. Cloudy days Silver and Black Rapalas will provide good action for Northerns if you fish them.Good luck and have a good trip."
527512,Guest,2003-02-09 20:08:00,0,"Larry s , Gullrock average size fish 16""-18"" redlake has a strong 24""-26"" class of fish. Let's be honest to your self?"
527513,Vitreum,2003-02-09 20:24:00,221,the first liar doesn't have a chance around here.
527514,Guest,2003-02-10 07:07:00,0,"Larry s , Give me a break Larry S I notice on Walleye Central you never fish Gull Rock and are looking for pionters where to fish. Who's being honest ????? WPGER"
527515,Larry S,2003-02-10 07:19:00,666,"WPGER, Your the one who opened his Big Mouth and said that Gullrock is ""full of small walleyes in its prime in summer"" From reading other postings and talking to a number of people who have fished Gullrock,your statement is full of it. Your one of these idiots who badmouths other people ,just to be a Jerk.As I said at least be Honest when you open your mouth.Being critical of me for asking about a lake which I have never fished ,shows you dont give a ##### about helping people on this websiteLarry SNevada Walleye Man"
