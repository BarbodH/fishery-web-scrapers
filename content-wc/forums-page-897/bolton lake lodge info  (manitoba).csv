528110,Guest,2003-03-02 07:08:00,0,"I've been up to Bolton Lake four times.Each time I was there I have seen Master angler Walleye, Pike, Lake trout, and Whitefish caught.The price is competitive the service is great,and everybody is really freindly. I'm going back in June."
528111,cbprov,2003-03-02 08:23:00,1010,"hEY IAM GOING IN 3RD WK OF JUNE , when are you going/? mybe see you there , just a freindly question why do they call you bomber bob?"
528112,Guest,2003-03-02 14:09:00,0,"The third week in June I will be going to Elk Island Lodge on Gods Lake. It is another lodge that is operated by the same people who operate Bolton Lake Lodge.Hopefully it will be just as good as Bolton. I've always been treated like a king when I'm at Bolton. I guess it all depends on the individual,some people are never happy or satified. As far as the guides go they can't be treated that bad,the same guys are there every year so that must tell you something. And Hey! as we say in Canada,those guys know the lake very well and are able to put their guests on some real decent fish. The Bomber comes from a couple of things CB.It used to be from my motocross days when I was bombing around the track, but now it's more or less from me bombing around Lake Of The Woods with the 225 Opti. Or is it because it's not a Cuban cigar you will hangin from my mouth? Oh by the way CB whats the prov for? Are you from Quebec?"
528113,cbprov,2003-03-02 16:46:00,1010,"i guess you had a bed exp ,i have never seen any problems with the owner or the guides.might of been a bad day.hey bomber bob where do you fish in lake of the woods ,i bet that 225 you scream around on likes the fuel,what kind of boat is it on,i not far away from lake of the woods mybe we should hook up and pound some eyes and smoke some cohebas.NO I AM NOT FROM @#%&@# QUEBEC"
528114,phil,2003-03-04 08:08:00,59,"I was up with a group at one of the outpost 5-6yrs ago. The cabin was fair -good,fishing very good. One drawback is the need for generators at the outpost. I much perfer outpost with propane frig& freezer.We did have some difficulty with cost of supplies that were flown in.We were given credit for a trip the following year but never made it back. Phil"
528115,Piscatorian,2003-03-04 18:47:00,12,Aren't we allowed to tell the truth here? I certainly didn't say anything offensive. What's with the censorship???
528116,Guest,2003-03-04 21:59:00,0,"Howdy PiscatorianIt is not censorship at all. But part of your post went over the line. Yes you are entitled to your opinion, but we try to keep a sharp eye out for name calling etc..Have fun.....R"
528117,fishinguy74,2003-03-05 08:36:00,1,"Piscatorian,Trevor Dick from Bolton Lake Lodge here. I don't want this to sound like an add, although your harsh words have done far more damage than I can do good. I'm ashamed to admit that I do not remember what happened with your group, bad weather?, a misunderstanding regarding your bill? Regardless, we have literally hundreds of guests that we take very good care of and they come back year after year. I considered contacting them to send in their good comments, but I think this has gone on long enough.I have tried to contact you directly by email and by phone to see if we can work things out, but for some reason you seem to be happy to just bad mouth us, but not talk to us. Please contact me so we can work out whatever problems you may have. 1-800-665-5321"
