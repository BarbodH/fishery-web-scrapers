528036,Guest,2003-02-26 07:29:00,0,"Hi Stuart.I had been thinking of fishing Pringle or Vicks with Mattice this year.When you said you did alright, how many and what sizes did you get over how many days?Also, what time of year did you go?I'd hate to put that kind of money out for a trip and it ending up being just ""alright"".I'd appreciate any info on your trip."

528037,Guest,2003-03-03 12:47:00,0,"Northland,""Alright"" means lots of walleyes from 15""-19"". My father is getting old, so we fished only 2-6 hours a day and we usually caught 15-30 fish. Pike fishing was also good. We did not target them too often, but caught many from 20""-28"" and several 35""+. Accomodations are great. We fished Vick in mid-July of 2001, and the fishing was not as good as Pringle. More pike, fewer walleye. We fished Pringle in early August in 2002. However, I used to do a fly-in out of Red Lake where we caught far more walleyes which ran larger (18""-25""). Unfortunately, that outfitter has no lakes which they allow a party of 2 without paying for at least a party of four. Our last name is not Gates, so that is out.All in all I would definitely recommend Mattice Lake Outfitters. No gripes with them at all. I was just looking for anyone who might have ""slayed"" them on a certain pattern that I may have overlooked. Be glad to exchange any other information you may be looking for."
