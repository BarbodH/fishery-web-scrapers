528049,Guest,2003-02-27 09:49:00,0,"By asking a simple question, you went and fired up some of the locals. Am I the only one that finds ""Hunter's"" response somewhat ironic?His solution to preventing physical abuse is to beat the crap out of someone. I guess that helps explain some of the dysfunctional family history he's so eager to share with us."
528050,Ivy,2003-02-27 10:57:00,556,"Ironic yes. Reality? That to.A man that beats up a women is a bully. Pure and simple. Granted, physical force is not the only way to handle a bully, however usually it's the only one a bully understands.Or another way to look at it, is this. Force can only be countered with equal to or more powerful force.Ivy"
528051,Hunter,2003-02-27 11:49:00,346,"Dude, I am one of the most peaceful guys you would ever meet! But you just tell me what you would do if you are standing in a room and you are watching someone beat the ##### out of a woman? I am not going to call the police and sit back and watch it! I am going to intervene immediately and by any means necessary. Then I will be the first to call the police. For those that want to defend an abuser you are no better than him! As for my family being disfunctional Ill say this, out of 5 children in the family, 4 of us are upstanding citizens that have NEVER had a run in with the law, work full time, pay our taxes, and vote. 1 is a drunken, drug addicted fool that should be locked up permanently. If you say thats my parents fault you are sadly mistaken, they didnt give him the booze or stick a needle in his arm, that was his CHOICE!This is my final 2 cents on this matter."

528039,Guest,2003-02-26 11:58:00,0,is crossing with a domestic abuse on your record a problem?
528040,Hunter,2003-02-26 12:02:00,346,"Sure is, its a felony! If stopped at customs you will be turned around!And from a person who has stopped at dometic abuse in progress,,, I can tell you we(the citizens) do not look too kindly on it! If you abuse infront of me, you will be severly abused!"
528041,Guest,2003-02-26 20:48:00,0,"Hunter, you act like you don't have domestic abuse in Canada. Kind of a holyier than the rest of us attitude. I don't agree with any kind of abuse, but you assumed the guy was bad from the beginning. In our country and I know yours, sometimes people are charged even though they may be innocent, so lighten up, dude."
528042,Hunter,2003-02-26 22:31:00,346,"It is here, I do not deny that fact! I stopped a Canadian ""man"" from beating the living snot out of a Canadian woman. As a matter of fact that Canadian ""man"" was my brother. I even testified against him in court. I have no love lost for him,, he is an abuser and I want absolutely nothing to do with that drunken, drug addicted piece of scum!(there are drugs here too) If I see it, I will try and put a stop to it no matter what country you are from. I do not care what danger that may put me in, if you abuse a woman or child infront of me, I am coming after you, RIGHT NOW!If you are convicted of the offence, you are GUILTY of the offence!"
528043,bigfish1965,2003-02-26 23:22:00,3210,Yes there is domestic abuse here. If convicted a person is no longer welcome to cross the border into the US. As far as the innocent being convicted...I'll say not likely.
528044,Guest,2003-02-27 06:59:00,0,"Nameless said ""charged"" not ""convicted"". Often these charges are without merit and are used by spouses as leverage in divorce proceedings. Many of the charges go away long before they go to court. I don't know about Canada, but in the most of the states in the US, if a wife cries abuse, the husband, for all practical purposes, is guilty until he proves himself innocent. I'll agree that most that are convicted are probably guilty."
528045,Hunter,2003-02-27 08:43:00,346,"And annonyymous said this!""is crossing with a domestic abuse on your record a problem""If its on your record, you have been convicted or plead guilty!"
528046,Guest,2003-02-27 08:56:00,0,take it somewhere else.....this is a fishing board.
528047,Guest,2003-02-27 09:11:00,0,"Hey hunter, Just how big a feller are ya??? I would be happy to help you stomp the snot out of an abuser....but lets make sure he deserves it....I would rather be fishing."
