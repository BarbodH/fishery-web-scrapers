527995,Guest,2003-02-24 08:30:00,0,"Guys: What's the best trolling method for deep lakers? On the lake we fish every summer, there are some very deep lakers (50'- 60'). Will leadcore get down that deep? Should I add anything to that (weights, dipsey, etc.)? Also, what about dodger/flashers with a spoon? Would they be effective? Thanks, Trout"
527996,retire55,2003-02-24 10:13:00,1029,"Troutbeck:I'd suggest the use of portable downriggers as one of the easiest and more accurate methods of fishing at those depths. That's not to suggest that you can't get to those depths with leadcore, but you'll need a lot of it (more than 10 colours) and you'll need to experiment with things like snap weights and/or various lengths of mono leaders and diving cranks. Consequently, using downriggers would appear to be a simpler and more accurate approach."
527997,TeeDub,2003-02-24 12:33:00,48,"Downriggers work just dandy if it's suspended fish you're after. If the trout are relating to the bottom however, and in many lakes they do, then downriggers aren't the answer. In this case I've had good luck with a slow troll, using a heavy mono (20 lb) and a 3-way hookup with a heavy weight on one and a light flutter spoon (Sutton Spoon, if you can find 'em) on the other leg, about 4 ft. from the 3-way swivel or triangle set up. I've been able to pull lakers up from over 100 ft. fishing right off the bottom using this method. One hint is to use lighter line on the weight, or tie an overhand knot in it so that if you snag up, you'll only lose the weight.Vertical jigging is another method that not only works, but is a lot of fun for deep, bottom related lakers. I like a 1 oz. ball jig with a white twin tail plastic and topped with a minnow. Live if allowed, frozen if not."
527998,fishinnut,2003-02-25 08:13:00,642,Try snap-weights (6-8 oz.). Blu/silver spoons and rapalas work well.
527999,downriverbob,2003-02-25 11:14:00,880,"I have taken lakers from Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, and Superior not to mention LOTW/Whitefish Bay when they were in 100 - 150 ' of water and just off or near the bottom with downriggers. A spoon/cow bells, cowbells/peanut(small body bait) have producted for me in all the listed lakes. Last year in lOTW I caught most of my bigger fish suspended off the bottom in 45 - 60 "" of water with inline-planer boards and crank baits that were diving to 37-45""(Luhr Jensen Powerdive Minnows/Hotlips Express)."
528000,Guest,2003-02-25 15:24:00,0,downriverbob....say your post on fishing lake trout in whtefish bay. We will be up there for the first time on June 8th and would love to catch some lakers. Any suggestions on how and/or whereto fish for them at that time of year. Thanksemail [email protected]
528001,manitobawalleye,2003-02-25 17:33:00,885,if you have a line counter here is a very easy way to get them with a set of snap weights...add enough weight to get where you want....print off this article and don't forget to print off the ultimate depth control guide and laminate it and keep it in your boathttp://walleye.outdoorsfirst.com/winnebago/45.htm
528002,downriverbob,2003-02-26 07:11:00,880,"Jimmy, I usually fish the first two weeks in July, but there are a couple of areas I could recommend to you they probably hold fish there all year round just in different depths. Where are you staying ? I can then direct you to an area that is close. I have caught most of my bigger lakers the last couple of years on planner boards, I know that earlier in the year that you can catch some lakers by casting deep diving cranks or jigging in shallower areas. With the winter we are having in the midwest part of the continent you are probably going to have some pretty cold water temps the first week in June. I am going the first two weeks of September so I am going to have to adjust some of my fishing techiniques. I mainly go there for musky, but fish for lakers, smallmouth bass, and walleye when I get burnt out on making cast after cast for musky."
528003,Guest,2003-02-26 18:17:00,0,"downriverbob.....thanks for the reply. We are fishing out of ""Whitefish Bay Camp"". Would love to pick your brain a little on this area. We have fished the Lac Seul area for 25 years and thought we would add an additional trip this year but someplace a litle closer. Our understanding is that this is an extremely clear body of water and the tactics that we use in the stained water of LS in the first week of Aug will probably not work here.Yours thoughts. my emails address is [email protected]"
528004,PWaldow123,2003-02-26 18:34:00,198,Was up at WBC two years ago in June. We were getting Lakers early in the morning up on top of shallow reefs casting rapalas. We were fishing in between the islands just north of camp.
