528103,Guest,2003-02-28 13:56:00,0,Just looking for some suggestions here. I'm tired of losing lures to the toothy critters while casting for smallies and jigging for walleye. I use 20/6 power pro on a LM rod and spinning real. Aside from using those big ugly leaders what do some of you guys use to prevent bite offs without sacrificing lure action and invisibility?

528105,nitroman,2003-03-03 00:15:00,368,I make my own leaders and spinners with sevenstrand usually make up a few before I head up then keep the kit with me in case I need to make new ones. I have never had a bite off but they do get twisted up after a few good fights with the pike.
528107,Guest,2003-03-03 04:00:00,0,"Try some Invis-a-leaders from South Bend. You can buy them at Wal-mart or Galyans. They're much thinner than regular leaders. Only problem with them is after a few hits they kink up on you and you have to change them. They come in a 5 in. length. They make them longer but, I prefer the short ones. Also good for top-water.

528106,Guest,2003-03-03 11:05:00,0,"I'm also convinced 7-strand (non-coated) wire is the way to go because northerns can't bite through the stuff, yet it's small enough that it doesn't spook walleye. I've never used it for jigging (mostly because jigs are cheap), but I never pull crankbaits when there are northerns around without a homemade leader made of 7-strand wire. They don't last forever, but they're cheap and easy to make.Here's a tip for making them. To attach a swivel at each the end of the leader, the wire needs to be wrapped tightly around itself. After threading a inch or so of wire through the swivel, bend it back toward the other end and over the top of the leader. Now, attach a surgical forcep to the very end of the wire, clamp it down with the handle and let it hang. Grab both ends of the wire with your hands and flip the forceps over the leader with enough force to make it go around several times. The weight of the forceps will wrap the wire tightly around itself. If you give it just enough force, the forceps will pop off after the end of the wire is fully wrapped -- without any ""tag"" sticking out. With just a little practice, it's easy."
