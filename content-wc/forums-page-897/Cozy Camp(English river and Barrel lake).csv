528062,Guest,2003-02-27 10:11:00,0,"Son and I were there some 6 years ago. Owners have changed. It was really OK for the price. The location is most important. You are in the middle of a LOT of lakes for fishing other than the English river. We did most of our fishing on the English river just before Barrell Lake for walleyes. Also, at the outlet of Barrell where you have to be careful as there is a heckova current. The outlet has some good walley fishing along the edges-5-8'. Left side of island where the English River emptys out was the best for us.You can go upstream from C>Camp for some nice northerns--lot of weedey flats--poor walleye fishing we found upstream.Then ask the owners and around (ask at Verns Baits in Ignace--good guy and info) and trailer a boat for some good laker fishing at other lakes nearby. Take jigs and whatever the camp suggests> Early June they may still be up but later they will be in holes for jigging or try to troll deep.I always hire a guide for the lst couple days--well worth it in a new area."
528063,Guest,2003-02-27 12:04:00,0,Thanks for your reply. is there a reason that you did not go back to the resort? How many walleyes did you catch and was there any size to them? Did you run into alot of other fishermen or did you have the lake to yourselves.

528066,Guest,2003-03-02 11:10:00,0,"We were there late in the year-right before labor day. Walleyes-nice ones were schooled in the rapids ABOVE the falls in the outlet. We caught and threw back a lot. I know of people that fish Barrell and do well. Big lake. If you look at the map you'll see Kukukus Lake-great lake for northen and walleyes. Have to rent a boat from Flayersas they have the market, and thats OK. Lot of good lake trout lakes around you can travel to from Cozy Camp. If you are looking around for another place you might try Gerry Nicholas at Press Lake Camp. Nice people and they get a LOt of good reports. This place is about20' and 12' west. They would be located just down river from Barrell Lake on the English River as well. OK? Great walleyes and northern. I'd pick his brain for lake trout. And where to fish Press Lake. Punch up Press Lake Camp on the net. This is good area to venture out from Don't hesitate to spend some money on a good guide. A great one in this area is Jim Krosschell. He spends his winters in Wis.."

528068,Guest,2003-03-03 05:30:00,0,"Patrick, I know Dan at Cozy Camp, he's a good guy. Is this your 1st trip to North Western Ontario? The English River system is a good place to find walleye and northern. We run a guide service out of Valora (about 15 miles north of Cozy Camp). We fish the surrounding area and Sturgeon Lake, for walleye, northern, lake trout and small mouth bass. If we can answer any more questions let us know. Jim Krosschell([email protected])"
