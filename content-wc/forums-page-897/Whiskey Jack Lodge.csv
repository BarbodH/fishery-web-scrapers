527837,Techmonster,2003-02-27 08:07:00,66,"i do not stay at Whiskey Jack lodge, but do fish some of there smaller lakes and do stay on Sturegeon Lake. I've been going for years and will continue. Fishing in my eyes is great. Stergeon lake is huge however and very rarely fish it...it is very overwhelming, but do fish the smaller lakes and have lots of fun. Like they say on the website, a truck with good clearance is a good idea to ahve. a car is not going to cut it up there. Also if you have 4wd, makes things alot easier. Good luck"

Any help would be >great. > Larry Larry, I have been staying at Whiskey Jack lodge for a least fiveyears now. I have been Booking at least three trips a year.As per your frist question, About three years ago the resort has come under new management Dale Matthews and his wife G. Dale has been with the lodge for a number of years and was empolyedas a guide before he took over. Dale and his wife are very personal,he tells like it is. As far as the resort it self Go to there web site www.whiskeyjacklodge.com. It also tells it like it is. In my opinion you get more then you pay for. ( dont tell Dale this). Now lets get down to bussiness, Trout fishing is excellentearly season cold water you can find them in the shallows by trolling spoons or rapalas, Later in the year fish deep 60 to 100 ft. trolling with a downriger or realing up a sonars either way works great. Now my favorite WALLEYES You have to remeber you have 55 mile of lake shorehere with cystal clear waters. Early spring to 1st of July excellentif you know where to go. Slot fish 23in to 30in fantasic. I would subjest hiring Dale as a guide until you learn the lake, its tricky.Clear water best in the morning or evenings for the larger fish. but you can have non stop action all day long as long as the wheathercooperates. If you check out the area map you will find a number of small lakes in short driving distance. With plenty of action, it will take time to learn them> but when you do its great. Northern no problem all day long if yopu fish them. Dale is usally booked it may be tough to get in until later in the year He has a good following of clientele. Have a good time Wally E.C. Wi.cooperates"
527839,Guest,2003-02-28 11:18:00,0,"Wally;I am also rom E.C.Wi. I really didn't plan on fishing on Sturgeon lake but wanted to fish the smaller lakes for eyes. Does the resort have boats on all the smaller lakes or should a guy bring his own small boat along? Do you bring your boat or do you rent from him? How hard is it to get to some of the lakes, do you need a big four wheel drive or will a ranger be okay? How many walleyes do you average on a normal day and do you jig for them or use spinners.I talked to my buddy the other day and he might back out on me so I'll have to find someone who can be on stand by. I'm very limited to the time that I can go due to my college summer school. Thanks for the help. larry"
527840,Guest,2003-03-04 10:46:00,0,"You can not ask for a better deal! Whiskey has it all. The fish are abundent. Good size walleyes, Good Lake trout numbers all around, Large Northerns to be had and a great enviroment created by the Matthews.The access to the smaller lakes is normaly drive there and hike maybe 50 yards or so to the landing, some may be a little more of a task, but being a lazy person I tend to stay away from those. So if I am willing to go, it must be easy. We have had tremendous success on Sturgeon and even greater success on the small lakes without the long boat ride that you may have to do on Sturgeon. Sturgeon can be overwhelming at times and a bit scary if some weather comes up on ya but if you have a GPS or are thinking of getting one, do it... it may help you get back in a little rain storm when you cant find your land marks off in the distance.All in all, you get more than what you pay for. Now dont be expecting that the showers are piping hot water 24/7 and hard enough to sand blast paint off the wall, remember you barely roughing it. Good accomodations, beds are ok maybe a little too soft for some but if you fished hard enough you should fall right to sleep. Unless Dale just got done telling you about the loggers who have seen Big Foot."
527841,Wally,2003-03-04 13:53:00,38,"Larry,If you have your own boat and motor bring it. 14ft no smaller then 12ft. If it fits in ranger pickup that would work great. Hope Its a 4&4 you should be able to sneak around just about anywhere except ATV lakes. Once you locate the fish try a spinner then switch to a jigand try back trolling. As far as action goes I lose count. And usallyrun out of minnows and have to switch to mister twister tail or rapalaTry Squaw lake, Harold or Venesa for starters in that order. Good Luck Wally"
527842,Guest,2003-03-04 16:27:00,0,"Wally, Larrys got it right. Squaw is a ##### of a lake for Walleyes and we have caught some hugh Northerns in there one was probably 48inchs. I dont know if you wanna bother bringing another boat for these little lakes... much easier to bring your own 10hp motor and rent a boat for 30 bucks or whatever we pay and then you dont have the hassle of launching.Eady is awesome, easy setup.And we have done princess, now thats a journey but great fishing."
