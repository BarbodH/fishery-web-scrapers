This will be a first trip to the great white north for all of us. I was just wondering if anyone had any feedback on the lake we have chosen or if you could recommend something you feel would be better. We have a group of four and are looking for a drive in lodge, housekeeping plan, boat rentals, and all the help we can get!"

In early June the walleye fishing is all done very close to the camp in shallow water.We do our very best at getting our customer's on to the fish. I personally will take all my guest's, that are new to the lake on a 3 to 4 hour lake tour showing all the hot spot's & show all the proper rigging. Check out Our Web Site.heartland.on.ca/sportsmen or duenorth.net/eaglelakesportsmenslodge. Jim"

But I'll just keep reserving next year as we are checking out this year."
