528076,Hank,2003-02-27 12:54:00,9,We were at a deer show a couple of weeks back and ran into the people from this camp. They said that their fishing is second to none and we should plan a trip with them. Was wondering if anyone ever stayed with them and how many fish that they had caught. I was wondering if this place is as good as they said or if i should look elsewhere? If so are there any special registration for atv's that you have to purchase to ride them in Canada?

We run a guide service out of Valora( about 15 miles south of Greystone)We fish the surrounding area and Sturgeon Lake for walleye,northern, lake trout and small mouth bass. For your ATV you will need proof of registration and insurance. Helmets are required by law in Canada. If we can answer any more questions let me know.Jim Krosschell([email protected])"
