We are going in August, which I know is a tough time to fish. Any suggestions on a nice lodge and some fishing thoughts would be most welcome.Thanks,John"
528100,Eric,2003-03-01 18:16:00,114,Fished the lower French in Sept. last year. My only visit to the region. Pretty area. Lots of people and boats compared to what i am used to for a canadian fishing vacation. Went after muskie and had a very very slow week. Even used a guide for 1 day. On a couple of days we got bored and caught some bass and northern. Did not walleye fish so can't help you there. We stayed at the Bear's den lodge. Nice cabins with electric and hot water. Used their meal plan and the food was good and plentiful. It is a pretty nice camp. It is close to Wainipittae ? bay. There are 2 or 3 other commercial camps there also. The French river lodge was close by and looked nice but we did not visit. There was also a lodge dowm the far fork but I don't recall its name. All in all I did not enjoy the trip nearly as well as western ontario trips around the Fort Frances and northern areas. It would have been better if we would have landed a large muskie but we only raised 1 fish all week. Eric MacDonald [email protected]

August is a tough time but if you go out to the bay you may have some luck. Try jackson's point for some eyes and Crombey bay for some muskie and pike action. If you do go into the bay make sure you use a guide, there are many in the area. and well worth the trip.If I can be of further help just give me a shout"
