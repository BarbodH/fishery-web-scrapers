528022,bbakes,2003-02-25 14:22:00,121,"I have gotten a can pass for the last 5 years. It has been different almost every year. It always ends on my birthday, July 18th. But some years if I apply in the spring they will make it good till July 18th, other times till the next July 18th, or a year and a half. So to answer your question usually a year, but anywhere from 6-18 months."
528023,troutaholic,2003-02-26 13:49:00,827,"For the last 5 years, it has been 2 years from your LAST birthday.Example: If your birthday is March 1st and you went to get one on Feb. 26 2003, your remote border pass is good from March 1st 2002 to March 1st 2004. In this case, it is only truly good for a year.On the other hand, if your b-day is Feb 20th, you have almost 2 years to use it.Just Rip Lips and Keep a Tight Line"

528026,Big Laker,2003-03-04 11:56:00,53,"allows the bearer to cross the border into Canada at certain remote areas without reporting to a port of entry, as long as imported goods are declared. I think they started this a several years ago when then closed down many of the remote customs locations."
528027,FishTour,2003-03-04 11:56:00,105,It's actually called an RABC for Remote Area Border Crossing. This is a permit allowing you to cross into Canada on the border lakes without having to stop or check in at customs. It is a background check so if you have something on your record you may be denied.http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/rabc.html
