Was just wondering if anyone has any knowledge of the fishery on this body of water.Is it worth a week of valuable vacation time?Any info appreciated.Fish don't forget the day the badger came out to play."

As I recall this is a part of a series of lakes that are connected and you can go 20+ miles from Balentines to the end. As with most Canadian Lakes, the lakes are lovely. I believe there are other resorts along the chain too as well as some houses. We caught mostly walleye-nothing large-not too far from our resort. This system is good for muskies but has no northerns in it.(My then nine year old niece had a muskies take a small walleye on her ultralight outfit which I ""helped"" her land-estimated 9 pounds, generous estimate! Played the fish out to the side of the boat but did not use the net or hands as the fish cut the line. Thank goodness-that fish looked mean!.) A brother of mine caught a good sized muskie trolling and I had missed strike on a topwater. In my mine, muskie is a bonus fish you catch while fishing for walleye. Too much special tackle ad dedication required.There are smallmouth bass and I believe, lake trout. If you find a good spot and are catching fish, there is a chance you will be joined by other boats. It seemed to me the fishing was concentrated in Indian Lake. I know the were not fishing by ourselves for long on a small hump we had located(in August) Don't overlook weedlines if rainy or overcast. The bite didn't last long but when it was on it was good.I have to say the accomodations at Ballentines were the nicest housekeeping arrangements I have stayed at in Ontario."

The connecting waterways are easy to navigate. The last lake to the west--Cobble Lake--is quite clear and has a decent Lake Trout population. Don't plan on trophies from the chain, but you will catch lots of fish."

Wayne and Karla are among the nicest people you will meet anywhere. Cottages are clean. They have a lot of repeat business. If you go the same week every year, you will be with the same people.The previous posts sum up the fishery pretty good, just remember if you want northerns, go elsewhere. Muskies are your best chance for a really big fish. I caught a 40"" musky 2 years ago while fishing walleyes. Last year we had 2 over 30"", while fishing walleyes."
