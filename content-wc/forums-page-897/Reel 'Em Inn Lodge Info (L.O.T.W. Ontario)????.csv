Thinking of Reel 'Em Inn lodge on Alexandria Island, Lake of the Woods, Ontario the first week of June. Requesting any information on the lodge, lake, timing and any fishing tips. Take a kid fishing & thanks in advance."

Might be hard to get in the first week of June, which goes to show that I'm not the only one that feels this way. The fishing is awesome also.Jap"

Vic Beckel is a great host, and the staff is fantastic. Fishing is great, however is affected by weather patterns as is to be expected. However, I'd bet a paycheck that Vic is one of the top 5 best fishermen on LOTW and he will catch fish in the toughest conditions and works hard to get his guests on the fish. If the weather is right, you will catch lots of nice fish. There is so much more to say, so please feel free to list some questions and send them to me at [email protected]."
