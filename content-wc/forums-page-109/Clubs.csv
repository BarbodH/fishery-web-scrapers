6362408,jackpotjohnny48,2019-10-02 20:19:00,153,". Well, I know a guy in our group who REALLY had to take a pee when we pulled up to Willard Lake (Kenora District), so he dropped his drawers at 7 am, right in the middle of camp, and took a pee, right there where everybody could see. His naked bum scared the heck out of an old lady in the adjacent cabin. She complained to the manager, and we dang near got kicked out of camp. I had to point out to my friend that where he took his pee, he was standing only two feet away from an outhouse, if he only would have been paying attention. I said, ""Dude this is NOT what I had in mind when I said we would be fishing walleyes during the full MOON period! I was actually talking about the solunar tables, so please don't drop your drawers in public anymore."" Other than that, I don't know of anybody who likes to drop their drawers in public in the Kenora district. Sorry. I wish I could be more help. ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"

6362870,Walleye2242,2019-10-04 14:24:00,263,yeah.....there is. about 15 years ago we went to a brutal fishing camp in that area on a suggestion. We went into Kenora one night because...well....why not? We were younger and looking for some nightlife. Hit several bars. On bar we went into...in the backroom had strippers. Now from what I was told...it is not really a strip club. The owner brings in some talent on the weekends. No clue the name of the joint.
