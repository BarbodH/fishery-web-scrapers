I don't think I have ever had higher expectation than for this trip to Taltson. I jumped on when a group of 3 season pike guys posted that they needed a forth for this Taltson trip. I have wanted to fish Taltson for more than 5 years but in general my fishing buddies aren't able to do $4,000 trips. This was my chance and when I heard about their need for a 4th I jumped on it within a couple of hours. I am so glad I joined them as they were a lot of fun to fish with. As a side note as we get older and the fishing friend universe shrinks a bit I highly suggest joining a new group here or there to make some new friends hear some new jokes and share your old jokes on a new audience. Let me get the negative stuff out of the way first. The camp is marketed as being not white glove. Ok that leaves a lot of room between white glove lodges and run down outposts. I can say I have fished all the way across the spectrum and Taltson is definitely on the lower end of places I have visited in terms of amenities (no wifi, one shared toilet, one shared shower, and older motors) and at $4000 for 2020 it could leave more than a few guys disappointed with the ammenities. A few examples would be they turn the generator off at night which means when fishing 9a-11a you don't have a lot of time to recharge you phone, GoPro, or use your CPAP at night. I solved the problem by borrowing a Marine battery and bringing up an inverter. Another example is the food. To be honestly it felt like they were short on food so the amount and variety were not great. Finally the camp was filled with 9 guys meaning 5 boats were needed. They needed 4 guides. One guide no showed so someone who paid for a guide was out of luck (us one day). Then using a 5th boat meant one of our groups had a motor which didn't work well as they were towed back in twice and they also fished with no reverse for several days, which can be dangerous when fishing the river in current. None of this would be shocking at a $1000 a week place but this is $4000. In general fishing at Taltson is about the fish. If you are ok with that and focus on that you will be a VERY happy camper. The lack of amenities isn't stopping me. I am signed up and going back in 2020! Some of you are probably saying what the heck? $4000 and the boats had issues and you are going back? The answer is easy. The fishing is otherworldly for pike over 40 inches. On previous trips to Great Slave I had 6 over 40 at Frontier fishing Lodge fishing 50/50 Pike and Trout over 6 days. In 2 1/2 days at Trout Rock on Great Slave I had 4 over 40 with a previous best 45-inch. At Taltson we caught 51 legit 40 inch plus pike for 4 guys. (This is with me leaving after 3 days early due to my wife being sent to the hospital for a serious illness.) If I had fished all 7 days I am confident we would've hit 60-65 40+ inches. I also caught my personal best with a gorgeous 47-½ inch pike. The average catch is around 3-4 pike per hour with an average size of about 35 inches! I'll say that again the average is a 10-pound pike! In three days I caught around 60 pike. I had 10 over 40 inches with a breakdown of: 1- 47.5 4  43 1  42 4  40-41 50  30-40 The fishing is fairly easy. It consists of working a large weed filled flats within a mile of camp. There is also river fishing for the days when the wind kicks up or the lake is muddy. If you are comfortable casting to weed edges and gaps in the weeds and working lures back to the boat slowly you are good to go. Far and away the most fun fishing is the famous night bite. This happens when the pike enter the channel the river has cut through the weed beds. 20 feet one way you have dense weeds. 20 feet the other way dense weeds in 2-4 feet of water. Right down the middle is 12-18 foot deep trough and loaded with baitfish for the pike to gorge themselves and around 8p they move in to feed. So just as the pike move in to feed we move in to pound that channel at night with Magnum Bulldawgs on laker sized equipment. Each pass (around 1/2 mile) would turn up arm and shoulder busting hits when the 10lb+ pike grabbed those 12oz lures trolled at 1-2mph. Absolutely worth every dime of the 4 grand you pay and really only available at Taltson. The best lures are fairly simple in August. We caught 60-70% of the pike on Johnson Silver Minnows with 6in white grubs. The JSM thing was really pretty funny when you consider Rich and I were carrying around 3 or 4 thousand dollars tackle boxes. We tried EVERYTHING else in the box and kept coming back to a 100 year old lure that costs 3 bucks! My partner Rich fought the JSM tendency for more than a day and finally got tired of me out fishing him 2-1 and he changed. The other lures with decent results were pink Person Grinders (1oz), Black/Orange Magnum BullDawgs 12oz, and 6 in silver-blue paddle tails on a large jig head. In general lures with a silver or blue coloration out fished everything else including gold, pearch, and fire tiger lures. Overall, the experience was positive. It would be very simple for them to run a top notch camp. Get people to show up to work. Make sure you don't overbook your ability to deliver reliable equipment, and spend a bit more on diesel and the food you're providing. It is really quite simple and what we saw was maybe just an exception. I am willing to give it another shot and see if I can get to 20-40+ inch pike for a full week. I was on track this year and with a bit of experience I am confident I will get there! I fished Echoing a few weeks ago to see if I can find the big pike and trout Mike Borger found a couple of years ago. Best part is my dad is joining me for that trip. He will turn 79 while we are there. Should be fun! Brett"
