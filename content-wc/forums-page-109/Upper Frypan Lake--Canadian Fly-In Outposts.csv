A few nice reefs and some current flowing around. A few deep holes. Caught a few big lakers by surprise. Portages were stuffed with fish. One to the north had smaller walleyes but crazy numbers. One to the west big walleyes and good numbers, big pike and a few big smallies. Portage boats were very rough 6 years ago but motors were good, didn't really care because fishing was that good. Cabin very nice with full solar power, indoor toilet, 3 bedrooms. Nice walk ways and boat ramps, nice boats and motors. Great view from the covered deck. I would go back in a minute. Jay is the best and will bend over backwards for you."

Only downside was the lake seemed too small for us so got bored fishing the same spots. (We like to explore). The outfitter was great to deal with and very helpful. Would recommend for a short trip, with kids, etc."
