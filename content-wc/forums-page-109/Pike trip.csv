6363134,GBS,2019-10-06 08:18:00,2271,"Check out Grass River Lodge in Manitoba. https://www.grassriverlodge.com/A drive-in, ""near"" Flin Flon. 3 meals per day. Guide included for each day. Coffee delivery each morning to the cabin.I caught a 52"" northern. Wife's best was 48"". Several mid-40's each day. Too many in the over 3' range to count. Walleye were generally only fished for starting about 1/2 hr before shore lunch. Lake trout available, generally in the Spring. You can, of course, take a break from casting and fish for walleye whenever you want. Ike (the owner) makes a point to go around to each table at dinner, and ask guests how fishing was, what worked (and didn't) and spots that were productive. Shares with the room, so we all had a better chance to find a big one the next day.Ike also operates a fly out service with his own aircraft, to go to any of his ""private"" lakes for day trips. Easy to get 100+ per day of big walleye.Everything is catch and release, except shore lunch. Only lodge on the huge lake.2 Day drive from Mpls/St. Paul.Oops - forgot the free happy hour at the lodge each day just before dinner!"
6363180,adempsey2.0,2019-10-06 12:03:00,611,I am very curious about these camps. Have you stayed at any of them? They seem like great drive-to options.
6363190,madnomad,2019-10-06 12:54:00,34,"i have not,but i have it booked for june of next yea for 5 days i just love trout fishing and they have 3 species as well as trophy pike"
6363192,madnomad,2019-10-06 12:55:00,34,hanover is the only drive to camp that dusey river adventures offers
6363198,adempsey2.0,2019-10-06 13:12:00,611,"Oh yes, that's right. I was just thinking about Lucy and Mills Lakes."
6363200,madnomad,2019-10-06 14:18:00,34,i can already smell the fresh speck fillets sizzling in the cast iron pan
6362514,fishwteeth,2019-10-03 08:28:00,10,I know this is a Walleye forum but I have good friend that has never been to Canada. He wants to fish for some Walleye but has a strong desire to fish for Pike. Where would some of you recommend we try in Canada for Walleye and numbers of Pike with the opportunity to catch a decent size Pike. I appreciate any and all info. Thanks much
6362532,MrSimon,2019-10-03 08:57:00,922,Drive or fly? What time of year? Where are you driving from and what's your max range?
6362550,fishwteeth,2019-10-03 09:45:00,10,Drive from central Ohio. Don't really have a drive limit. Thanks for the help. I guess I should have been more specific.
6362554,bthomas3333,2019-10-03 09:58:00,465,The other big questions are always price range and who is cooking? American Plan?Under 1000? 1000-2000? 2000+B-
6362654,prov1800,2019-10-03 15:50:00,5010,Ok let's say house keeping and a 1000 us.Probably best for pike in my opinion would be Anishinabi Lodge.Thats owned by www.clarksresorts.com.its a 15 min flight from there base on cedar lake.4 cabins on a small island and a lodge.Been there a couple of times and have never been disappointed in the amount of pike and always a few good in the 50-100 per day.walleyes can be had on 6 portage lakes.some walk ins some on atv.bonus lake trout and bass in main lake.worth a look.

6362728,Esoxfeign1313,2019-10-03 19:31:00,79,"I hear Lac Evans rivals the big names in the NWT/SK for a fraction of the cost. HUGE pike and a healthy walleye population, too. Google Bushland Adventures. That’s where I’d go."
6362768,Mike Borger,2019-10-04 05:09:00,1554,Having been there I would tend to agree with that statement. It's a lot more than 1K p/p though and it's a fly-in not drive-in. Worth it though.
6362784,Esoxfeign1313,2019-10-04 06:50:00,79,"The Gouin Reservoir in Quebec is underrated imo. I’ve been there twice with Air Tamarac, who run a 1st class operation. You drive to Clova, then take a short flight to the cabin. I’m going again in June to East Saraana Bay, which looks like awesome spring pike water compared to the other areas they fly to, so I’m definitely licking my chops. A typical 5 days of fishing costs me about $1k-$1,500 max door-to-door (from upstate NY). You really can’t beat that price for what you get. Their cabins and boats/motors are all in excellent condition, and you’ll catch a ton of walleyes and likely the biggest pike of your life. I did the first time I went! Check out the video on AT’s fb page/website. Turn up the volume for some funny sound effects. So, if I had more $ and people to go with, I’d go to Lac Evans."
6362838,Matcaz,2019-10-04 10:59:00,22,"Some of the best times of my life were spent at Slim's Cabins near Sandy Bay, SK on the Churchill River. There are almost 40 miles of river accessible by boat right from camp. We have boated hundreds of plus 35"" pike and many over 40"". I don't think we ever had a trip without multiple 40"". We would catch all the walleye we needed for meals and limits to take home throwing spoons, raps, and husky jerks while fishing for pike. No need to specifically target them unless you wanted to do some jigging as a break from casting. We always went the first or second week of June. It is a long drive, 22 hours from Nebraska, but offers fly-in type fishing at a drive-to price. Shoot me a PM and I will share all the information you need."
