6362094,Ricky Spanish,2019-10-01 15:13:00,1298,"Wow, have things changed for us. My mother-in-law, Sandy, passed away on 9/19 at 69 years old. The brain tumor came back causing her to be hospitalized on 8/29 and there was nothing more they could do. She was well cared for by Hospice Alliance in Kenosha, WI for her last days and died peacefully with her husband and daughter at her bedside. My wife, Dawn, had a bleeding stroke in her right occipital lobe on 7/3, just ten days after we came back from a great return trip to Eagle Lake. She has been off work since then, so she was able to spend the last month with her mom and dad. She has some troubling issues with her vision, among other things, so our long term plans are still unknown. I am just happy she is still alive. Don't take anything for granted."
6362156,Juls,2019-10-02 02:12:00,13414,"My condolences....and, I wish your wife a speedy recovery!"
6362214,johnboat,2019-10-02 07:45:00,2014,Best wishes to you both. Everyday is a good day!
6362306,fishin10,2019-10-02 14:50:00,2315,Best wishes to you both. I'm going thru some medical issues now....Getting them taken care of now so I'm ready and in shape for Eagle Lake next June!
6362696,Camoclad,2019-10-03 17:40:00,628,"Dang, when it rains it pours. Condolences for your MIL and I hope Dawn gets well soon. After seeing her deer pictures this summer, I hope she is able to recover and get in the woods a bit this fall and winter. I know you are doing a good job nursing her back to health. Take care.

6362766,pjshorthorn,2019-10-04 05:08:00,5654,"Tell Ms. Dawn that the grungy looking guy carrying a bag of candy says hey and hopes she is felling better. It was great that Camoclad and I were able to join you guys at TBL for an evening in June. Lots of fun. We should do it again next year if we are up there again at the same time. Best wishes, PjShorthorn"
6212164,BornToFish,2018-06-22 16:08:00,1224,"Greetings,Your and your wife's great news is a clear testament to the power of prayer!Good fishing and tight lines to both of you later this year!!"
6212178,emma17,2018-06-22 16:52:00,436,Outstanding. Thanks for sharing and allowing us to help in prayer.
6220778,hugepike0,2018-07-12 19:12:00,28,Ricky Spanish - great handle - awesome show - i wonder if anyone else here gets the name - praying for your wife so you guys can get back on the water!
6221428,Mike Borger,2018-07-14 11:59:00,1554,"Just saw this now, great, great news!!!!"
6221450,Ltrain,2018-07-14 13:04:00,4145,"I too just saw this, great news!!!!! Many more trips to be had"
6329076,Ricky Spanish,2019-06-07 15:15:00,1298,"Well, it's been another year and Dawn is still doing well. Yesterday morning, Dawn's mom went into surgery to remove a mass at the base of her brain. Updates have been few and far between, and she's in her 3rd or 4th MRI right now. Since everyone had such nice things to say when Dawn was going through her recovery, I ask that you all keep Sandy in your thoughts and prayers. I am convinced that it helped Dawn. We are going to Eagle Lake in a week to meet up with Dawn's dad and brother. Sandy made us promise to go no matter what happens. A great lady like that needs to pull through so we can keep her around as long as possible."
6329136,JAY221,2019-06-07 20:16:00,877,"That is great news on Dawn. Our prayers are with Sandy. Later, Jay"
6329158,BornToFish,2019-06-08 03:58:00,1224,"Greetings, Our thoughts and prayers will be with Sandy. We will all hope for the very best for her. I suspect that the upcoming fishing trip will be difficult without Sandy being there, but may be very much needed for the entire family. Praying for the very best."
6329162,pjshorthorn,2019-06-08 05:52:00,5654,"This is tough news for you and your wife,but I'm a firm believer in the fact that good things happen to good people. I truly feel this will be the case for your MIL and your entire family. We will be on Eagle Lake at the same time as you creating chaos and mayhem so if I were you, I wouldn't venture much further north than Portage Bay and Boat Island. My sincerest thoughts and prayers will be with you and your family. A quick moment each morning when starting our days on the lake will be sent to Sandy. Best Wishes, PjShorthorn"
6329688,Ricky Spanish,2019-06-10 09:20:00,1298,"Sandy came through like the tough lady we know she is. There seem to be no cognitive or physical troubles at this point. She will be undergoing physical and mental therapy for awhile before being sent home. Treatment options will come after the cells of the tumor are typed, which we're told is about a week out. It was only 3wks ago that she was told that her lung cancer and lymph node tumors were in remission, so this was a tough setback. We are grateful for every day we have with her and the way she seems to be rolling with it is truly amazing. PJ, it might be best if you stayed over on the west end, but you know where to find us if you get thirsty in the evening."
6149585,JAY221,2018-04-22 05:20:00,877,"Good luck to your wife and you. May you have many more trips in the future together. Later, Jay"
6149657,pjshorthorn,2018-04-22 06:18:00,5654,"Best wishes. Prayers to you, your wife and the fishing gods that you both will back on the water enjoying your time together in the boat soon. PjShorthorn"
6209082,Ricky Spanish,2018-06-15 15:19:00,1298,"My wife had a hysterectomy on Wed. She was able to keep one ovary and about a third of the other one, so she won't have to go on hormones. At 47, she isn't even premenopausal yet. Two of the tumors were each about the size of a normal uterus. Everything went to pathology for testing and we should know early next week if anything was cancerous. They told us upfront it was very unlikely, but they were able to get it all out without cutting through her abdomen, so her recovery should be shorter and less painful. A couple more prayers would be appreciated. It seems to be working."
6209090,pjshorthorn,2018-06-15 15:43:00,5654,"Dude, I'm glad to hear that the doctors have a positive outlook on the surgery and prognosis. That is a really big step in the right direction. I know you both have a bit of a journey ahead of you, but look towards those days when you can be fishing again this fall ( hopefully) on Eagle Lake and harassing some friends on occasion with your wit and humor. It's ok if you give your wife a kiss from me .... Prayers and wishes to her and yourself continue. PjShorthorn"
6209142,BornToFish,2018-06-15 20:35:00,1224,"Greetings,PJ said about everything that needs to be said. Give your wife a hug from the rest of us.Prayers....."

6209316,Thumpr50,2018-06-16 10:09:00,139,"Stay strong, be there for one another and know we are all thinking of you. Will be on Eagle Lake the middle of July, our first cast every morning will be for the two of you."
6212126,Ricky Spanish,2018-06-22 14:45:00,1298,"Tissue samples were all negative for cancer. Thanks again for all the kind words, thoughts and prayers. We'll be back on the water in a few more weeks and she'll probably be good as new by Sep."

6145169,fishin10,2018-04-19 20:29:00,2315,Best wishes to you both and a successful and speedy recovery to your wife.

I sent my wife a link to this and here is her reply: I had to go back to this 3 times to finish reading the replies. I kept welling up with tears and couldn't finish reading it. Very good hearted people. Such a ¬ìfeel good¬î that there are still caring people out there."
6146497,Bstar,2018-04-20 10:35:00,564,"üëç I know what you guys are going through. My wife had breast cancer 4 years ago and it will drain your emotions at times. She is fine now. Mrs Spanish, I'm sure your going to pull through this too and you and Ricky will be back up at Eagle Lake before you know it! Good Luck to both of you!"
6146713,emma17,2018-04-20 11:53:00,436,Our prayers for a successful treatment and speedy recovery. Next year you'll be a year stronger to help catch the year bigger Fish.

We'll also be praying that both of you and your family have God's peace before and after the procedure. Be sure to let us know how your wife (and you) are doing post-op. Faith, Family, Friends.....and fishing, Rich B"
6144505,Ricky Spanish,2018-04-19 14:18:00,1298,"Wife needs a pretty major surgery. Between her recovery time, and the max out of pocket cost it will surely be, we decided to cancel our trip to Eagle Lake. We were going to be there in 57 days. She wanted to wait until after our trip, but I convinced her to get it done right away. The doctor said ""aggressively growing"" so I don't think we should wait a few months. Hope everyone catches an extra fish for us."
6144537,Obabikon,2018-04-19 14:28:00,2370,"Fishing is fantastic... but anytime the Dr. uses the word ""aggressive"", you don't wait. God bless, and best wishes to you both!"
6144545,Ricky Spanish,2018-04-19 14:37:00,1298,Thanks. I told her it might be our last fishing trip if she didn't get it taken care of right away. I think that convinced her.
6144601,prov1800,2018-04-19 15:07:00,5010,Hope everything goes great.
6144713,yoopertrout,2018-04-19 16:31:00,1172,"I'm sorry to hear this. I hope the surgery goes well, and you get to fish around home."
