He installed the roof on Doctor Carothers cabin on the west end of blue lake. I was told that instead of climbing down the ladder, if he was in a hurry, he would jump off the roof and land on his peg leg in the sand. In the 1950s he built a tourist camp on scout lake, just the other side of the narrows leading to lac seul. He set up a sawmill there and built a few cabins. My older 16 year old brother worked for him at that time. He had a nephew that would go out to lac seul and find logs that had gotten away from the earlier saw mills in the area and tow them back to be cut up by Huey. I got to accompany him a couple of times. Huey tried , with a bulldozer, to cut a road around the west end of scout lake to connect to his new camp. No luck. Too many deep gorges. He set up a landing on scout lake about a block west of Durochers camp with a road that branched off of Durochers road. He had a guide that lived there in a trailer that would greet tourists and boat them out to his camp. If I remember right he did ok for a couple of years but business fizzled out and he closed down. I know this history seems hard to believe for some but it is entirely true. I was born in 1944 and have a lot of memories from those days."
