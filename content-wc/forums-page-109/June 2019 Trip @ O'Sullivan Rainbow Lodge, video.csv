I thought one of the first scenes on your video said that you had 7,581 walleyes in your boat for the week. That's pretty amazing fishing. Then I went back and played it again. I then noticed that it was 758! walleyes. I mistook the exclamation point for a 1. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

Can you go into some more detail on how you utilize that technology, and what kind of a difference you think it makes vs. fishing out of a camp boat?"
6362022,Ltrain,2019-10-01 10:57:00,4145,"Great video! At first i pulled this up on my phone but wanted to do it justice so I watched it on the big screen. Looks like a geat trip. Those walleyes had beautiful color to them too. Obviously you slayed them jigging. Just wondering if you ever ran bouncers or pulled boards up there. I guess why would you, you caught over 750 fish, lol, but I'm just curious."
6362132,Live to jig,2019-10-01 20:32:00,159,"Yes, the Trolling Motor is the single biggest aid in catching those fish. Electronics help but in shallow water we pretty much use them for depth and if fish are on the screen. GPS helps pin point exact spots I do use a camp boat when we bring family or friends and accurately anchoring instead of spot lock is the only difference, a big difference! We do bottom bounce to find the active, larger fish and the jig them. Honest we look for where the wind is breaking on the shore with the right depth and deeper water close by. We are hard core and are usually the only ones back on the lake after dinner till dark. That night bite can be epic if your in the right spot."
