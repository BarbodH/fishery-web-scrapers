6363936,jkretch,2019-10-10 06:29:00,80,What's the ;latest? Heading up to Vermilion Bay tomorrow. Thanks.
6363956,eyecatcher1,2019-10-10 07:14:00,323,When I came home on 9/21 the first 6.9 miles of 502 from the south was gravel. I would hope that it is done by now.
6363960,prov1800,2019-10-10 07:16:00,5010,Looks like a wet one all week.
6348834,Bstar,2019-08-10 15:15:00,564,The south end work is just the culverts. They haven't started any resurfacing yet
6350616,x4flatfish,2019-08-16 11:06:00,319,Anyone been on 502 this week? Want to keep this thread going as I will be heading that way in a week. Thanks
6350794,MOfish,2019-08-17 04:52:00,39,We're headed up Today. I think we're going the 71 route. It's only 20 minutes longer according to Maps
6350798,Carnhzkr,2019-08-17 05:14:00,964,"Just drove north last evening. 502 is fine. Most of the culvert repairs are fine to drive over. There was one that I wish I'd have slowed down a bit for but the others were no biggie. There was no area of removed pavement as was the case two months ago. There was one spot where they're putting in a large culvert and it's a single lane with flag men, but other than that its in great shape."
6351344,law57,2019-08-19 18:37:00,1147,Came back (south) today - 8/19. The southern ~30 miles has many culvert 'hump/bumps'. I slowed for them - don't see any reason to launch the boat. Some weren't bad - some were worse. It appeared that they will begin paving the southern part of the road. One lane was devoid of pavement - I don't know if it was covered with gravel or removed. But t here was maybe 1/2 mile of single lane. No problem on a Monday afternoon. I made it the 502 trip in 2 1/4 hours. I stopped a few times to pee and to tune my MP3 player. I'm never in a hurry. It's a beautiful drive.
6352178,lazermule,2019-08-22 12:17:00,86,"I traveled it the same day. The farthest north culvert crossing is the worst, so you'll want to slow up for that one for sure. Monday morning they had already starting grinding pavement. The north was in good shape up near Dryden, but yest the southern 30 miles were a challenge.LM"
6355692,StonyRun10,2019-09-04 08:11:00,12,It's been over two weeks since there was a report on Hwy 502 conditions. Anybody been up that way more recently that might have an update?
6355700,x4flatfish,2019-09-04 08:42:00,319,"Came home last Saturday. They were not working on the road as it was a holiday weekend. The south end is still under construction. There was a several mile stretch where both lanes are gravel. If you go while they are working expect some delay as they pave 1 lane at a time making you wait for oncoming traffic. It is not terrible but just be aware and slow down for the culvert repairs where there are bump signs. Just drive cautiously and be aware of the all the other idiots around you, and trust me there are a lot them. Mostly Americans that can't take an extra 15 minutes to arrive safely at there destination. Be safe"
6355702,IaDave14,2019-09-04 08:43:00,99,Came back Sat 8/31 all construction is on the last 20-30 miles or so on the south end. Hit a patch of gravel maybe 1 mile long - both lanes were open.On the way up that stretch was one lane. There are also the culvert replacements that are gravel and the bumps weren't bad. No problem at all but we went thru when dry so no crap on the boat that I had to clean off.Who knows what to expect now they have to asphalt that patch of gravel sometime I would think.
6355800,TRapperJones,2019-09-04 15:26:00,36,Ditto..have to watch for bears on that road...bout tagged one with the bumper coming down the gravel stretch last Thursday afternoon
6344750,ia bhtr,2019-07-27 20:39:00,212,"Wife and I aren't going for a month yet , flip of the coin for us Baudette or I.F. , already made up my mind Baudette and 71 , I know that road is good from our trip last month"
6345382,Fred_G,2019-07-29 21:09:00,908,Drove up 502 yesterday. Other than the culvert issues at the lower end the only gravel was approximately 2 miles that looks ready to be paved. I expect that will be done by the end of this week. All of the equipment was there just waiting to be used.
6345546,38bill,2019-07-30 10:58:00,331,FYI: Came home from the VB area this past Sat. We go #71 to #11 and then cross at Baudette MN. There is some bridge work being done on the northern end of #71. Not really a problem but expect to see several temporary stop lights were it goes down to one lane. #11 going west from #71 also has a bridge or two under construction and several blocks of rough gravel on the east end of Rainy River. All in all not a big deal.
6345548,Guest,2019-07-30 10:59:00,0,"can you expand on the ""culvert issues at the lower end"" comment? Heading up 502 on Saturday, kind of wondering what I'm getting myself into... Thanks! -42"
6345550,'Taterguy,2019-07-30 11:10:00,33,"They replaced several culverts and the patches in the asphalt are a little rough. I think I counted maybe 32. All are marked with ""bump ahead"" signage and at the actual bump there is a universal ""bump"" symbol sign. Looks like saw teeth on the sign to me. We were in a van pulling a small trailer. Some were rougher than others but slow down and not a problem. This was 10 days ago. It is my guess that they are going to repave the lower end as well. Not sure if they'll do it yet this season or next."
6346334,Slim03,2019-08-01 15:01:00,159,Just came down it this morning. About 1/4 mile of gravel is all we had and looked like they would be done paving this week. South end lot of culverts and road is marked up and appears that they will be starting it soon.
6348808,Bstar,2019-08-10 14:00:00,564,We drove up today and the culvert and road construction aren't even worth mentioning. Just a couple of heavier bumps at the culverts on the south end. The north end is all but finished.
6348812,reddemon2,2019-08-10 14:16:00,255,Perfect heading up tmrw
6348820,Bstar,2019-08-10 14:30:00,564,I was pulling a small trailer with no issues. Have a good trip!
6348832,BornToFish,2019-08-10 15:12:00,1224,"Greetings, It appeared to me several weeks ago that the crew would start paving the south end of 502 when they finished with the stretch of road on the north end. How is the stretch of road on the south end of 502? Is that work finished or not yet started? My wife and I head up 502 Friday morning. Very kindest regards...."
6341114,NARDA 1,2019-07-15 16:51:00,636,According to Google Maps 71 is 50km longer. I have taken 71 the last several years. I think it is a better route.
6341248,pjshorthorn,2019-07-16 06:04:00,5654,"We took 71 up to Vermilion Bay back in June and it was in great shape. It is an easy and scenic drive with a few nice views of the eastern most end of LOTW. It is slightly longer than 502, but not enough for me to worry about. To me, the drive is a big part of the adventure and I would much rather look at the scenery vs.worrying about where the construction is and how rough it may be. You have Nestor Falls and Sioux Narrows as towns where you can make stops if necessary and there are a couple of roadside places you can also pull off for an emergency bio break if necessary ( no using the woods as there are fancy outhouses). We stopped in Sioux Narrows at Gill's for a few things. It has a bit of everything from groceries to a bait and tackle shop, gift shop area and breakfast sandwiches which looked to be fresh made each morning. A really nice place. They have fuel and outside washrooms as well. Have fun on your trip. PjShorthorn"
6341258,Pooch,2019-07-16 06:19:00,4618,"502 has me considering rock guards on my truck for the trip. Not sure they are worth the hassle though. If one has a really nice high end boat then for sure. Pulling a tin boat? Maybe, just to keep from mud'n up your boat. Putting your boat in the water and hoping to get it clean is futile. Trust me.Pooch"
6342048,bigwalleye1,2019-07-18 12:28:00,2632,"My timing sucked yesterday. third vehicle behind the water truck for the entire 20 klick dirt road portion of the 502. Thankfully, rain from Pelland to Deer River hosed off a lot of it."
6342828,reddemon2,2019-07-21 14:36:00,255,"Just went thru this morning, All new road just south of the 502/594 jct, Couple miles of bare gravel, I would imagine by Monday or Tuesday it will be all paved, After that it's just sections where the culverts were replaced. Talked to a flagger on our way up last week and he said the whole section of 502 is getting repaved."
6342836,Pooch,2019-07-21 14:58:00,4618,That happened to wife and I about ten years ago. (Probably the last time they repaved 502.) Could not even see out the windows so stopped in Dryden and asked the car wash guy if it was OK to wash the mud off before we continued. He said that he was used to it so go ahead. Still took an hour and a bunch of quarters. It appeared that we were not the first that day to stop at the car wash.Headed back in a couple weeks so considering going around on 71. An extra hour or so of driving vs half a day cleaning when I get home? Even I can figure that one out.Pooch.
6343026,kevinvjacobs,2019-07-22 07:27:00,48,"We went from I Falls up to Sioux Lookout Saturday the 13th. Decided to take 71 instead of 502 due to all the reports on here. Really enjoyed that route. Yes, it is a bit longer, but good road and great scenery. Some of the guys needed cell service and had it most of the way. FWIW"
6343170,SterlingArcher,2019-07-22 12:47:00,92,"My crew came down the 502 on the 19th and found a fair bit of construction yet - two stretches of maybe 20 miles +/- where they are resurfacing and some stretches of it are down to one lane w/occasional stoppages. Added maybe 20 minutes to the drive time; nothing too serious. I think both projects are to last the duration of the summer and well into the fall, so if non-paved surfaces and potential delays bug ya, probably plan an alternate route."
6343502,'Taterguy,2019-07-23 18:04:00,33,"Just came through south bound on Sunday the 21st. Southern 1/3rd is culverts, middle third is paving in progress and northern third is smooth sailing. They had paved a lot during the week we went up. Saw a bear beside the road on the way up and what looked like a young wolf on the way down."
6344712,SimonHockey04,2019-07-27 17:13:00,25,Any updates on 502? We leave on Friday just wondering if it makes more sense to take 71.
6338390,team walleye,2019-07-07 09:10:00,336,Wild fires?
6338410,tv4fish,2019-07-07 10:22:00,2694,"Even here in mid central Minnesota - we are ""suffering"" from smoke from the fires up in Saskatchewan (at least that is what the news guys say)"
6338514,bearfvr13,2019-07-07 19:41:00,174,"Wild fires?[/QUOTE]Yep, they have been working on it for quite some time now."
6339152,bigwalleye1,2019-07-09 19:01:00,2632,Any more news on the 502? Heading up Friday and looking for road intel.
6339320,BornToFish,2019-07-10 09:06:00,1224,"Greetings, I provided an update on my 502 experience on this thread: dated 06 July. I wouldn't expect much of a change since that date. You will likely encounter more newly paved road for the northern stretch of road construction. You may find more work started on the southern stretch of road work. All in all, it won't be a major headache. Do be mindful of the short stretches of gravel where culverts were installed/replaced. Safe travels..."
6339414,bigwalleye1,2019-07-10 13:32:00,2632,"I did see that. Just getting antsy, I guess. When I was through there a month ago, they were doing culvert replacement and about 70% of them were pretty smooth for gravel. Unfortunately, the other 30% must have been filled in by day laborers.... Thanks for the update, and for the safe travel wishes!"
6339804,fisher_i_am,2019-07-11 20:47:00,498,"Just traveled up todayWe experienced exactly what chuck did.Trucks and boat were filthyWashed it off in Dryden at the car wash,"
6339806,mwh624,2019-07-11 20:48:00,183,"Drove north on the 502 today. 10 miles or so stretch of gravel plus lots of culvert work. Pay attention to the bump signs, most aren't terrible but there are a few that could bend an axel at highway speeds."
6340410,bearfvr13,2019-07-13 09:55:00,174,"Just came down 502,...if heading north, you should see the gravel road start right around 115 kilometers heading north, then it is back to pavement after roughly 11 kilometers. Plenty of patch work before you get to the gravel. No delay for us. (I was heading south, but I told it as if people are heading north) Chuck"
6340906,MOfish,2019-07-15 06:21:00,39,Just curious. How much longer is it to get to Vermillion Bay using 71? Is 71 in good shape?
6337452,law57,2019-07-03 19:04:00,1147,"I would not describe the 'stuff' on my boat as 'black goo'. That sounds like tar. The stuff on my boat is more like a light spotting of some petroleum product - but it looks very light weight. I was going to wash my boat/trailer today. But there were storms predicted for my area. Tomorrow doesn't sound too good either. If I don't get to washing my boat tomorrow I'll see if I can get a picture of it. I have a pretty good camera and should be able to show samples of the 'stuff'. As I posted before, I'm going to siphon dish soap/water thru my pressure washer and use a long handle brush - then rinse with the PW. I think it will come clean pretty easily. I wouldn't spend a lot of time and worry over the 'black goo'. Take the best route for your trip. Drive carefully and have a ton of fun!"
6337462,Pooch,2019-07-03 19:38:00,4618,Came up 502 this morning. Was a slow trip. Boat and trailer a mess. Will go home through Pigeon River just to avoid more mud and culvert installs. Will not add that much more time to our trip back through Duluth. Memory serves me that it adds about an hour and a half to the trip vs IF to Duluth.Pooch
6337472,team walleye,2019-07-03 19:52:00,336,"We picked it up a few years back heading west out of Dryden to Vermillion Bay, but never on 502."
6337528,tv4fish,2019-07-04 05:06:00,2694,"It may be calcium chloride ---- that is a common chemical that is used for dust control on gravel roadways. It IS kind of ""slimy"" and sticks pretty well to vehicles/boats when fresh."
6337558,law57,2019-07-04 08:42:00,1147,Yes tvrfish - I should have thought of that. It looks like an oil based product on your vehicle/boat. But it probably is calcium chloride. The gravel road I live on is sprayed with that yearly. In fact they just put it down this past week. There's a ton of traffic on my road. There's 85 cabins down-stream of me and a boat landing. So everyone that comes in has to leave the same way. I think it's probably the most traveled gravel road in St. Louis County.
6338268,BornToFish,2019-07-06 20:22:00,1224,"Greetings, My wife and I traveled south on 502 on Friday, 05 July. The work on 502 is in full swing. I saw a truck pulling a trailer/boat stopped in the middle of the south bound lane with emergency flashers on. He had just traveled past a rough section of road where apparently a culvert had recently been replaced. The driver was standing alongside his trailer trailer with his hat in his left hand. He was scratching/holding his head with his right hand. I could tell he was thinking some thing along this line: Now, what in the #$%@ do I do? Most of the road work was centered on the northern stretch of 502. Work was commencing on the southern stretch. Kindest regards....."
6338282,bearfvr13,2019-07-06 21:27:00,174,"Definitely in full swing!!! We got stopped about 3 times, with roughly a total of a 45 minute wait. One section was 20 kilometers long with no road, only gravel. They had water trucks watering the gravel/dirt to keep the dust level down. Despite the delay, no complaints from this guy!! Chuck"
6338302,BornToFish,2019-07-07 05:09:00,1224,"Greetings, Chuck: are you fishing this week? If so, why are you reading this when you could be fishing? Go get them!! The delays added about 15 minutes to our trip on Friday. The crews were doing a good job of keeping traffic moving. Despite saying this, I hope they have most of the work completed by the time of our next trip in the third week of August. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6338312,bearfvr13,2019-07-07 05:45:00,174,"BFF,........Yep, we are fishin! The sun can't even penetrate the smoke and ash! Gonna be a weird week! And yes, the crews were doing a very good job at keeping traffic flowing! Chuck"
6338314,bearfvr13,2019-07-07 05:46:00,174,"Oops,.....BTF!!"
6336472,eyecatcher1,2019-07-01 08:34:00,323,"I guess that I was lucky then. My truck and boat got a little dusty, but nothing stuck to it. I hit the bridge in FF at 8:30 and there were three trucks ahead of me and all three lanes were open. I was through by 8:35. They only asked me three questions and let me go."
6336994,Bob/MN,2019-07-02 10:38:00,178,I have found if possible get behind a local driver. They seem to know where the bad bumps are and how to avoid them. We did this on our trip this year. There are always some holes that do not get filled where the new culverts are installed.
6337026,eyecatcher1,2019-07-02 11:42:00,323,Whenever possible I keep the center line in the middle of my hood. That way I miss most of the bad spots as they are usually on the side of the road.
6337110,eyecatcher1,2019-07-02 16:27:00,323,I just saw your post on another thread and you fish the west part of Lac Seul. You must be getting that stuff on your boat and vehicle west of 502. I have been running up 502 for 27 years and have never had the problem. My buddy follows me with one of those white Lund boats and has never had that problem either. It must be after you turn west off of 502 where you're getting it.
6337150,law57,2019-07-02 18:25:00,1147,I turn east into Dryden off of 502. On my return trip I come from Dryden west to 502. I had that gunk on my trailer and boat when I got home. I have not cleaned it yet - too busy with other stuff. Tomorrow is to be my boat cleanup day. I had forgotten about the gunk. I think it's probably some sort of oil based chemical for dust control. I don't remember seeing any water trucks at the 502 construction sites. I'll probably just use a little dish liquid/water mix in the siphons of my pressure washer and see how the stuff cleans up.
6337252,eyecatcher1,2019-07-03 07:12:00,323,"That's really weird! After reading about you guys I went out and checked my truck, boat and trailer again. I don't have any of that stuff on my rig. I go really slow over the dirt spots, but I imagine that you guys do too. I don't know why I didn't get any, but I'm sure happy that I didn't."
6337258,Jpat,2019-07-03 07:30:00,10,We got home yesterday. We took 71 instead of 502 for the first time this year. We encountered no construction. 71 is an easier drive in my opinion and didn’t add enough drive time to make a difference to us. I’ll probably take 71 from now on.
6337338,eyecatcher1,2019-07-03 11:40:00,323,Do you take 11 back to Fort Frances then?
6337346,x4flatfish,2019-07-03 12:11:00,319,"So where are you going to/coming from? Looks to me like that route is 2/3 hours longer if going to Sioux Lookout area. We go the end of August and may go through Pidgeon River if 502 is still a mess then. Please keep this thread updated. I had a similar situation as Law about 3 years ago. 502 was a real mess when we came home and we had that goo all over our truck and boat/trailer as well. I think they water it down to keep the dust down, but whatever is in the mixture sure made it more than just mud. The rock chips didn't make me very happy either..."
6337356,eyecatcher1,2019-07-03 12:35:00,323,"I am in the Twin Cities area and travel to Sioux Lookout. I just looked and going 71 rather than 502 is about 100 miles farther according to Mapquest. I've been going up 502 for 27 years now and I guess that I have been lucky to never have had to deal with the black goo problem that you guys are talking about. My old boat had a white bottom too, so I sure would have seen it. My friend follows me up there and back and has a white truck and a white Lund. He made it there clean too."
6336008,eyecatcher1,2019-06-30 06:57:00,323,"I came down 502 yesterday (6/29/19) and in addition to the culverts there was a 5 mile stretch of gravel just south of Dryden. Mostly dirt, but some gravel. Wasn't bad, I slowed down and rarely heard anything hit the truck."
6336136,Carnhzkr,2019-06-30 13:41:00,964,"I also drive south on 502 on 6/29 and I just got done scrapping 80 lbs of 502 off of my truck, trailer, & boat. With that 5 mile stretch, along with the numerous culvert bumps, if I were to go back today, I would definitely take the longer west route. No brainer."
6336146,team walleye,2019-06-30 14:12:00,336,502 is always a brutal stretch no matter the road condition in my opinion b
6336158,tate05,2019-06-30 14:57:00,99,I agree with Carnhzkr. I got up here yesterday (6/29) sans boat. I'll be pulling it back next weekend taking 71. Haven't been that way in years so it will be a nice change in scenery as well.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6336250,eyecatcher1,2019-06-30 18:56:00,323,What time did you go through? I headed down 502 a little before 6 and everything was nice and dry.
6336276,Carnhzkr,2019-06-30 19:44:00,964,"Due to a flat tire, I got a late start and hit 502 at about 9:30. Due to July 1 being a Canadian holiday and making for a 3-day weekend, there were no construction workers along that entire stretch. I assume they all had Saturday off."
6336284,team walleye,2019-06-30 19:59:00,336,Coming home on 502 about 5am-ish on the 29th I saw a moose for the first time on that road.
6336424,eyecatcher1,2019-07-01 07:21:00,323,I didn't see any workers either. Did it rain and wet the road between when I went through and you did? Was it mud stuck to your boat and truck? I was across the bridge and in Minnesota at 8:30.
6336458,Carnhzkr,2019-07-01 08:22:00,964,"It didn't rain on me. The stuff on the road that sticks to your vehicle is sort of a oily dirt crap that just grabs to anything it can get a hold of. I got it off with a couple of scrubbings. It wasn't as bad as I've experienced on Hwy 17 and 105 over the past few years, but bad enough to persuade me to go west if I had the option. I'll be going up again in August and heading to Sioux Lookout at that time, so I'll be hoping that part is finished by then because 502 is the only way to get from here to there."
6336466,Carnhzkr,2019-07-01 08:27:00,964,"And another thing. Not directly related to 502, but my later than planned start got me in to FF at 11:30 on Saturday. Definitely avoid trying to cross into USA at mid-day on a Saturday. Typically, I arrive at about 9:30 and have at most a 20 minute wait, but the line started almost back to the Copper River Inn before I could U-tun and get in line. I thought for sure it'd be close to 2 hours before I made it to the check point, but it only took a little over an hour. Plan ahead!"
6334800,Habitual Eyer,2019-06-26 11:33:00,144,Heading up to Red Lake next Monday (July 1). Looking for a HWY 502 update. Monday afternoon should be light traffic. I know there are some culverts getting replaced that you have to be on the alert for and slow way down. But wondered if there were any long stretches of gravel. If so I may opt for 71.
6334808,Ricky Spanish,2019-06-26 11:55:00,1298,"Just came back on the 502 on Sunday. Not too bad, in my opinion. There was a stretch of bumpy gravel patch jobs on the southern end, and more again closer to 594. The middle was pretty decent. Going up those same patches were less bumpy, so traffic seems to have eroded them. They were all well marked. Have fun on your trip and be safe."

6335030,bus33,2019-06-27 06:36:00,289,It was ok....if you are pulling a boat I would take 71.
6335036,rockape,2019-06-27 07:04:00,215,"I drove the 502 back to the states early Saturday morning. The crews were working in about 6-7 places where they are down to one lane, and stop traffic for 5+ minutes at a time. Not terrible, but some serious digging is going on here and there. It will take a little longer than normal if the crews are out working."
6335068,Habitual Eyer,2019-06-27 08:33:00,144,Thanks...how long are those stretches. If each is pretty short then no big deal...but if their pretty long then it maybe concerning.
6335140,Ricky Spanish,2019-06-27 11:31:00,1298,"Each zone was several miles long, one maybe 5 or 6, and the other seemed about 10 but they were just culvert patches about 8-10' wide and maybe about 20 culverts altogether. I only slowed down to less than 35 for one of them, and wished I had for one other one that I took at full speed."
6335200,Habitual Eyer,2019-06-27 13:47:00,144,so its just 40 ish feet of gravel where they installed new culverts (and lots of them it sounds like)....not several actual miles of gravel ?
6335204,Ricky Spanish,2019-06-27 13:52:00,1298,"Each one was going over about a car length of gravel, but, yeah, lots of them. BTW, funny handle."
6335762,hoosiercanadian,2019-06-29 07:49:00,104,71 is a much better highway and more scenic .
