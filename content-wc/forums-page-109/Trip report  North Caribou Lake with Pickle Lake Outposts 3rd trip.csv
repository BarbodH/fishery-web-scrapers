6339280,phishfearme,2019-07-10 07:55:00,1242,"Our group of 6 just returned from another (the third for us) terrific trip to Pete Johnson's northwest bay camp on North Caribou Lake (June 26-July 5)  you can see my previous reports here on WC. The group included fellow WC charter member LarryS, his sister Pat, Wil, Gary and we were graced with the presence of RobB (Grumps on WC) who we rounded up for the trip through WC and he was an enjoyable addition to the group. Weather this year was just plain great  warm days and cool evenings, no rain  some wind from time to time but we actually had two flat lake days which are rare indeed up there. There was lots of smoke though from the Sandy Lake fire  as well as some ash and also some blasts of hot air. We saw a red sun many evenings  see photos. The flat lake days caused the lake to loose its defenses and as a result the walleye fishing was over the top. 50-60 walleye each was easy to achieve and the first flat-water day enabled my partner and I to boat 232 walleye and lots of pike too. Numbers is one thing but the average size is the largest we've ever experienced  18.5 to 19 inchers are the norm with very few less than 18 and a maximum of 25inches (we caught about a dozen 25 inchers). Even though this is the largest average size we've ever experienced I would not consider this a lake to hunt for trophy walleye as 25 inches is the best we've had in three trips. I would also not consider this to be a lake to hunt for trophy pike either  at least the section of the lake we've been in  or the time of year we're there. LarryS got a 38 incher and there were a few others in the 3 ft range but that was it  and we trolled/cast for pike a good bit. I think Pat set one record though  she caught 29 walleye on a single twister jig body!! This lake is indeed one of the best walleye lakes in Ontario or Canada or the world for that matter and it's gonna be hard for us to go to another lake - although the lake's huge size can intimidate people. We booked Runk's Camp in the southern section of the lake for next year through Pete (Runk's a private camp booked out for the owner by Pete)  a huge cook cabin, 4 sleeping cabins and two complete indoor baths. Looking forward to it. phish"

6360598,pnnylfr,2019-09-25 09:03:00,114,"phish Thanks for the report. Looking at this lake for future trip. Why are your moving to the other camp? Accommodations, location, or better fishing. Just curious. Thanks."
6360698,adempsey2.0,2019-09-25 16:10:00,611,"North Caribou is certainly a walleye fishing paradise. However, it is also great for trophy pike. Our group caught quite a few nice fish close to Pete's camp.....but that was in the spring. In the fall, we never even ventured into that part of the lake. Runk's camp is in a good location."
6360706,Esoxmike,2019-09-25 17:38:00,114,"Thanks for the report,I had to say I would fish with any group that represents some philly love with the throw back Randall jersey up in the great north!E-A-G-L-E-S-Eagles!"
6361134,Carnhzkr,2019-09-27 13:36:00,964,"North Caribou is an amazing walleye lake. When you look at a satellite image of the lake you can see how the glaciers moved at a SW angle when carving out the lake. When I was there two years ago, I could see the long narrow points that extend out and continue under the lake. Walleyes were stacked up along those points and ridges. As you described, almost every walleye you catch is between 18 - 22 inches, fat and strong."
6362324,tooski,2019-10-02 16:45:00,393,"Esox, If you likes the Eagles gear you will love Kerr in his full Cleveland Browns gear next year. Personally, I can't wait..."
6362426,fishmanric,2019-10-03 03:48:00,219,"Fished this lake back in the seventies which created my love for Canadian fishing. Remember fishing a small river, that led to a small waterfall, where you could walk on top of the walleyes they were so thick there. Huge pike to 48 inches. Thinking about a return trip after all these years."
6363916,phishfearme,2019-10-10 05:49:00,1242,"fishing the lake out of Runk's Camp will be like fishing a totally new and HUGE lake - if you look at a lake map, the entire southern section is just not accessible from Pete's Northwest Camp unless you are willing to take very long boat rides and risk getting winded-in - not for us thanks. accommodations at Pete's NW Camp are quite nice - rustic but very functional. the digs at Runks are a large step up - same excellent boats/motors but 4 different sleeping cabins, two indoor full bathrooms and a very large eating/drinking cabin. I uploaded a number of videos of Runks on youtube - just search runks camp and - I do indeed plan on wearing that Browns jersey - for filleting fish only. phish"
6363922,phishfearme,2019-10-10 06:10:00,1242,"over the three trips we've done, we've trolled and cast for pike all over the central and northwest half of the lake for many many hours - and yes, we did get quite a few nice pike - but none which we consider as trophy (40 inch plus). I'm sure there's trophy pike in there, we've not caught any though. our trips were in late June through early July and although maybe not a good as late may/early June, I would think that this time of year should produce at least some trophy size pike. not from our experience. hopefully trying the southern section of the lake - which averages MUCH deeper than the northwest/central area - will change our luck. phish"
