The rain is about the only consistent thing here at the moment, but like some wise man once said, ""the fish are already wet, so they don't care"". The day in the video below was one of the days they seemed not to care about the weather, good fun, despite the rain and wind.VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/bAXWxVygWS0"

6362236,David Anderson,2019-10-02 08:56:00,2073,"I have driven by Wobigoon Lake many times on our way to Lac Seul. I noticed that the water color is quite different from most lakes in the area, instead of the clear but tea colored, the water is quite greenish in color and seems opaque. I was always curious as to why the different color as it is really noticeable at the outlet in Dryden. Obviously it doesn't affect the fishing!"
6362252,Limeyangler,2019-10-02 09:44:00,563,"Its the clay. The whole area is clay subsoil. The lake is almost clear at ice out, but within a day its stirred up. Fishing is awesome on this lake, but it is different to fishing Lac Seul, the fish tend to move around a lot more on Wabigoon, especially the walleye. They follow the same patterns as the walleye elsewhere, I just find that on lac Seul I only need to know 3 spots that hold fish at any given time of year whereas on 'The Goon' it pays to know as many spots as humanly possible and be prepared to run and gun."
6362576,David Anderson,2019-10-03 10:54:00,2073,"Interesting as that explains it quite well. Now when I drive through Dryden I can impress my friends with my new found knowledge. Just returned last Thursday from my last trip of the year to Lac Seul. Like you said our favorite spots are still our favorite spots. I brought a friend who usually fishes Lac Seul a number of times a year into August. He never fished in September however when fishing was slow he went to his old haunts, was getting nice fish in 8 feet of water while we were all doing well in 25 feet. Confidence has it's advantages! Thanks for your explanation."
