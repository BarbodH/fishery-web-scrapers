I've been fishing Lake St. Joseph in June for many years, but for the past few years I've added a September trip to try other lakes. The September fishing has never been as good as June, however. One of the reasons, in my mind, was that it always took a while to find fish on a new lake. This September I had the chance to go back to the same lake and cabin as in June, so that excuse is gone. Bottom line is that, for us, September fishing is just not as fast as June. Our fishing was still very good, but the per boat numbers were about 50-65% of June. We had a lot of 18-20"" walleyes but nothing huge. The biggest fish were 25"" walleye and 37"" northern. Of course, we had to try some of the June spots and some produced but others did not. The river that can be great in June only had two northerns. I always thought that September fishing would be deeper than June but was surprised to find that we still got walleyes pitching in to 4-6'. We also got fish in the 20-25' range but didn't fish any deeper. We were fishing 3 per boat and had two consecutive drifts over a 18' hump that resulted in triples each time. When we found a shallow area to pitch jigs we had a few 3-4 casts in a row that got fish. And there were the occasional spots that would produce a half dozen fish pretty quickly. Other than that, however, the fish seemed more scattered than June. Guys that used minnows thought that was the trick, other guys tipped jigs with crawlers, and two of us used nothing but plastic most of the time with the same results. For people familiar with St. Joe, our best spots were the shoreline just opposite the cabin bay entrance, the northwest side of Sandy Island, the sandy banks/gravel point southwest of the MNR cabin chute and the edges of a deep hole beside an island NW of Carling and SE of the Pembina River. The lake level was as low as I've seen it and we had one boat lower unit casualty. We usually see a lot of moose and bear on the way up and back, but not this year. I did get a good shot of a caribou swimming from Carlings Island to a small island, however. So, fishing was good, the weather cooperated and the group was great. Other than the lower unit casualty, everyone had a great time."

6362060,fldoc1,2019-10-01 12:40:00,69,I always like reading your reports. Hopefully I will get back to St Joe sometime. I still go with my wife to LOW / Morson area from June 1-6 next summer which I suspect will conflict with your trip. We have had good fishing in the Morson area at that time. Randy from Duluth

6362848,Mojo-NC,2019-10-04 11:48:00,1929,"Thanks for sharing. We fished a lake to the west of St. Joseph but about equally as far north the week before you arrived. I would have to say that our fishing was similar to our experiences in June, except that the fish were deeper this time of year (25-30'). It's a little harder to get down to them in the deeper water and we generally used our heavier 3/8 oz jigs, but the fish often had our jigs before they ever hit the bottom. We caught very few fish in less than 20' of water unless it was in an area of the lake that didn't have any deeper water fairly close by. We also experimented with some different colors and techniques this trip. Pink attracted too many pike and the Ned-rig worked great. Other jig colors (chartreuse/green/orange, white, gold) all seemed to work equally well. We didn't hit any rocks with the motor but we did lose a rod and reel over the edge of the boat when it was pulled over by a pike while not holding on to it, and we broke two other rods, one on a hook-set and the other while lifting a small walleye into the boat."
