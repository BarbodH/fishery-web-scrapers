6357426,gordy28,2019-09-11 04:56:00,437,Awesome. Thanks again for the info and great report. Melchett sounds like a great body of water. We did Ogoki Lake in 2018 and loved that area
6357522,Bstar,2019-09-11 10:35:00,564,"Great report. I can ditto everything you said about the camp, the fishing and the outfitter. We went there the first week of September last year and had a great tome too. I would not hesitate to go back."

6364052,Mojo-NC,2019-10-10 10:56:00,1929,"Nice report! I couldn't agree more regarding the fishfinders! We just fished a fly-in lake that sounds very similar to yours that none of us had ever fished before. We had some verbal recommendations of a few locations to fish and a crappy paper map, but that's it. However, we had quality fishfinders with built in GPS in each boat. We also had US and Canada Navionics chips and the lake we fished was mapped (although not entirely accurate). We were able to immediately find fish, zoom right in on the magic depths and proceeded to catch 'em up. I dropped waypoints wherever we caught multiple fish and we could go right back to each exact spot. If we went over a good looking hump or a piece of interesting structure at any time, I just dropped a waypoint. I switched back and forth between two sealed 9AH AGM lead acid batteries over the course of the week, starting each day with a fresh battery. I ran out of power late one day so I started lowering the brightness of my screen and had no further problems. Without a doubt the fishfinders were the most important pieces of equipment that we brought."

6356892,MrSimon,2019-09-09 08:40:00,922,"We just returned from a week at Melchett with Boreal Forrest Outfitters. In short it was a great trip with a great outfitter. The lake had uncountable numbers of healthy walleye and pike. No real giants though. I would highly recommend this lake and outfitter! The Outfitter Jay and Sue are fantastic. They are a young couple with lots of energy. Great communication. They have already made upgrades to their two camps and have ideas to keep going. They charter their flights through Nakina Air which is absolutely top notch. We met them at their home in Nakina the night before the flight to settle up and they met us at the air base going out and coming in. Super friendly people!The Lake The lake is pretty large to only have one cabin on it, which is awesome. But it's still small enough to cover it in a week and not feel like maybe you are missing the best waters. It's a structure fisherman's paradise with drop-offs, rocks, humps, shoals, islands, bays, rivers etc. You can access Kap lake through the Kap river. The water was low so we had to work around some rocks but made it to Kap without too much trouble. You can try to access Tester Lake, but I would only advise doing that with higher water. We just couldn't get through the creek. There are countless weedy bays and cuts that hold pike. There are some beautiful beach areas for shore lunches and plenty of places to get out of the wind. We saw eagles, loons, a moose, a bear, and some really cool small birds we didn't recognize.The Fishing We caught walleye from 2' to 32'. Certain spots were better than others but every single piece of good structure held fish. Drift, jig, catch, repeat. It was that easy all week. Average size was 15-20 with a good amount of 20-25s, but nothing over 26. All the fish were fat, healthy, and had perfect colors. There were literally unlimited amounts of small pike in the weedy bays. They were aggressive and hit like bullet trains. Bigger pike were also in shallow weeds, but only close to current or deep water. We also caught a good amount of bigger pike while jigging structure. Nothing in the high 30s or over 40 though. We split our time fairly evenly between walleye and pike. The Cabin It's fairly rustic but has some very nice features. There is a great solar system that runs a decent size fridge/freezer, a handful of lights in and around the cabin, and powers 4 USB outlets for charging stuff. There is also a small 110 inverter that will run small plug-in stuff. It doesn't supply a ton of power, but it worked fine for charging a 12v fishfinder battery. There is a great hot shower in the cabin, two outhouses, a screened in fish hut, and a large screened in front porch. The grill works great, both fridges work well, the stove/oven works fine, there are plenty of dishes and pans, and there is a hand pump at the sink that brings in lake water. There are 8 beds but I'd say 6 guys is the right number for this cabin. The wood stove is old but works great. There is a pretty steep hill you have to go up to get to the cabin from the dock. Guys in good shape will barely notice it. Guys in poor shape or bad health might really struggle. The cabin is located on a large sheltered arm of the lake. There is good fishing very close to the cabin.The Boats 4 standard 14' deep Vs with new 9.9 four stroke Mercs. Everything worked fine, although I have to say I'm not impressed with the new Mercs. They tend to over-heat if you run them for more than 25 minutes straight. They also have a dumb mechanism for raising and lowering them which sucks. It's hard to get the motor to stay up sometimes. The 9.9s are fine, but a little under-powered. You can feel them struggling especially with three guys in the boat. Again, they are fine, but 15s would be awesome. Plenty of gas, anchors (but short ropes), nice paddles, and enough life-jackets laying around the place you probably don't need to bring your own.Summary We had a blast!!!!! Absolutely amazing numbers of decent size walleye, insane fishing for small to medium pike, but no true trophies of either species. Nice comfortable cabin and boats. What made it such a special trip was the combination of everything ... wildlife, fishing, accommodations, outfitter, flights, weather etc etc .... it just all came together perfectly and we had the trip of a lifetime."
6356896,MrSimon,2019-09-09 08:58:00,922,"Oh one more thing I forgot to mention. The single most important thing we took with us were two very nice GPS fish-finders. I took a Helix 5 with auto-chart live and it proved to be invaluable. Being able to instantly create a perfectly accurate topo map was AWESOME! With no exaggeration, being able to identify, mark, and target the spot-on-the-spot doubled are numbers. Doubled! The paper maps out there were made in the mid 60s and are very inaccurate. They come close in certain areas, but are WAY wrong in most. I threw it away on day 1."
6356946,kettyspanky,2019-09-09 13:12:00,271,Sounds like you had a great trip. Fish look good and healthy. Great report.
6357158,gordy28,2019-09-10 08:07:00,437,Awesome report - thanks for sharing! One question around the fish finders - did you find keeping the batteries charged an issue? For our trip next year we will have a generator to charge but 3 Helix fishfinders like yours and there is some concerns around having fresh batteries every day Or maybe a better question is how long did a full charge battery last? Cheers Gordy
6357186,MrSimon,2019-09-10 09:46:00,922,"I bought a 10AH lithium battery from Dakota Batteries. It only weighs 2 pounds. I ran the Helix 5 for 12 straight hours using full color, brightness, GPS, mapping etc and it never ran out. It took less than an hour each night on the generator to fully charge the battery. I wish I would have tested how long it would run before dying, but I didn't. If I had to guess I'd say two full days."
6357194,MrSimon,2019-09-10 10:06:00,922,Here are some pics of my setup. It worked great! The battery box was awesome and allowed us to charge phones on the boat. The little flashlight was useless though. I had intentions of mounting the Helix either on the battery box or on some sort of stand .... but in the end I just set it on the bench of the boat and it was prefect.
6357200,gordy28,2019-09-10 10:24:00,437,That's awesome - thanks so much! Did you use the charger your Helix came with or do you need a Dakota charger? Cheers Gordy
6357234,vteye3,2019-09-10 12:02:00,496,I've posted a couple times about this outfitter. They are plowing money back into there camps and it makes a difference.
6357254,MrSimon,2019-09-10 12:52:00,922,"The Dakota Lithum batteries come with a special charger that you have to use ... at least that's what they tell you. I used it and it worked great. My Helix isn't a portable unit so it didn't come with a charger. I mentioned earlier that the auto-chart live feature is amazing, but in addition the base map on the humminbird zero lines card is pretty darn accurate. We explored the rivers that come in and out of the lake and visited some neighboring lakes .... and at all times we knew exactly where we where and how far away we were from camp. We tried to run up a long creek to get to Tester lake and it was rough going. We slogged through the creek for an hour wondering how far we had gone. A quick look at the map showed we were only a quarter of the way there, so we turned around. Without the map we would have been guessing."
