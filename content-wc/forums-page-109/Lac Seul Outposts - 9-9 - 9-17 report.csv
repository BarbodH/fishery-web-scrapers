6358622,pjshorthorn,2019-09-16 03:40:00,5654,Congrats!!! Looks like you guys had a great trip. Thanks for sharing. Spent many a trip on that stretch of water. PjShorthorn
6358718,Carnhzkr,2019-09-16 10:50:00,964,"Just curious, were the two eagles at the end of the video at Pecker Point? I was up from 9/17 - 9/26 and we had two watching us every time we fished there. I fed them a couple small walleyes but it was always the male, I assumed, that got the fish."
6359212,jimirjr,2019-09-18 07:32:00,1149,"We did ok on Our visit ( 9/7 -- 9/14) ... A bit tougher than usual years, BUT we caught quite a few NICER FISH ! Most were still puking up cisco and shiner minnows as We netted them. All Of the fish were just FAT PIGS !! AND... A BIG thanks to the group from WIS. who gave Us thier ""unused"" bait.. That was nice, especially after The bad luck They had.... A few pics below:"
6361066,wooglin,2019-09-27 09:35:00,371,"Sorry, haven't checked in here for a while. YES, it was at Pecker Point - they must sit there waiting, all day. Easy pickings!!"
6351872,TRapperJones,2019-08-21 09:20:00,36,Just hoping the rain and cool front doesn't turn off the walleyes next week...really gotta get my boys on fish
6351876,fishingMN4eyes,2019-08-21 09:51:00,108,"We mostly fish the Steamboat Narrows area and, weather permitting, make the run down to McKenzie a few days."
6351928,jimirjr,2019-08-21 13:46:00,1149,"Yes, We do fish PIKE on occasion, BUT mainly target Eyes.. AND thanks for the offer of info, But We have developed a pretty good ""milk run"" over the years for both ""dinner"" and ""trophy"" Eyes... AND Yes, We do go to Wapesi for Our BIGGER FISH ! We always seem to nail a few 40"" plus PIKE while Jigging for Eyes, so that keeps it all exciting.. But I always welcome new ideas, So Please MESSAGE ME with Your help ! It will be gratefully accepted!"
6353806,jimirjr,2019-08-28 09:54:00,1149,"WOOGLIN ? Have You ever targeted LAKE TROUT around that area? I'm thinking They would be more to the WEST, near deeper waters..."
6353876,wooglin,2019-08-28 12:26:00,371,"Funny you ask. We intended on fishing Lakers, we had our downriggers and weights...etc., we just didn't do it.....but we had good intentions on doing it. What I found challenging to us was committing time to GOOD walleye fishing and also GOOD muskie fishing. If I were to target Lakers, I'd probably have to give it a full-day shot so I can effectively fish them. And by doing that, it takes time away from walleye and musky - hence my problem There are some spots to the SW of LSO that has nice deep water (80-120ft), that if there are Lakers in there, I think they'd be there. A lot of people say they are NOT in Lac Seul, however there are resorts that have pics of lakers - they're in there, just limited IMO."
6353938,eyecatcher1,2019-08-28 15:29:00,323,"I've never targeted lakers on Lac Seul, but have heard there is a limited number of them somewhere in there. If I want lakers Minnitaki lake has some bigger ones and Big Vermillion has smaller fish, but big numbers."
6354030,wooglin,2019-08-29 05:54:00,371,"Right, lakes right next door are loaded with them, I have to think they are in Lac Seul in some amount....."
6358458,wooglin,2019-09-15 09:13:00,371,Video montage of our trip up to Lac Seul Outposts this year. Some really great pictures and musky footage within....hope you enjoy. Pardon some of the language &#x1f642;https://youtu.be/4Jul2564628

6358616,David Anderson,2019-09-15 21:46:00,2073,Thanks for the great video. We are heading up on Saturday and have some new guys with. Your video was just the ticket to show them what to expect.
6351254,wooglin,2019-08-19 12:14:00,371,"First time fishing the NE section of Lac Seul in search of great walleye fishing and the elusive muskie. We boated 103 walleye in my boat all week, 35 pike and 4 muskie.Walleye were biting on minnows, crawlers, leeches and plastics. We caught them jigging, trolling harnesses and even with big cranks trolling for muskie. I was a bit unhappy with the walleye count, but we were able to find them on most rocky points or wind-blown areas, mostly in 25-40FOW. Biggest walleyes were 27.5 and 26, and we all came home with limits and ate plenty of fish during our trip. I'm certain if we weren't casting for muskie for half our trip, we'd have really tuned in on the walleye and hammered them. If we didn't see fish on our electronics, we didn't fish there. We went all the way from Three Sister to Wasepi Bay, and anywhere in between. No doubt if we had fished just within 2 miles of camp, we'd catch all the fish we wanted. No need to travel far, I think we did, just to check out different spots. Lots of unnecessary miles IMO.Pike were found in weedy bays and we found plenty of them throwing for muskie. 36"" was the biggest, plenty in the lower 30's and lots of hammer-handles.Muskie (50, 44, 42, 37.5) were all found in weedy bays near deeper water. 50 was on a green tinsel bucktail, 44 was on cannonball junior (white), 42 was on a pike painted crank, 37.5 was on green tinsel bucktail. Heavy action on Wed/Thur with Friday being incredibly tough. We moved a lot of fish earlier in the week, and feel if we targeted muskie all week, we probably could have doubled our number. Several other 50""+ muskie were caught in camp that week, with one couple reportedly netting a 60"" - but could not share pics.Regarding Lac Seul Outposts. Highly recommend this lodge. They are literally in the middle of prime-time fishing, with another 'fly in' lodge only a mile away, and about 1-2 miles from many houseboats. The facilities are PRIME with full electricity, hot/cold water, high-pressure showers with ice delivery and garbage pickup daily - right at your cabin. They offer grocery/booze delivery, right in your cabin, at no additional cost (we'll do that next time so we don't have to cart everything up from WI). Service was impeccable, all gear/luggage delivered to/from cabin and the transport boats were great. The fish houses were great, clean, with full electricity, hoses, tall cleaning tables - and they took care of the guts. Great sandy beaches, power at the docks and you can bring your own gas if you want.If you're looking to get to this side of the lake, I highly recommend Lac Seul Outposts. Their hospitality and facilities are the best we've seen.ETA: Lots of unmarked rock piles and dangerous spots - you have to really be careful up in this area as it could a disaster if you get into trouble with your boat. It's a 35ish mile ride, by boat, to the camp - thanks to LSO for providing transport boats to/from so we could map our way in and out."
6351278,Ltrain,2019-08-19 14:38:00,4145,"Great fishing report and good job on the time travel....lol, i will assume you went in August sounds like you did pretty well. Thanks for posting, Lac Seul is on my bucket list."
6351280,wooglin,2019-08-19 14:42:00,371,"Yep, whoops! August, not Sept!! HAHAHA"
6351312,eyecatcher1,2019-08-19 16:30:00,323,You won't be disappointed Itrain. I've been going there two or three times a year for 27 years now. 100 fish days are the norm on Lac Seul. That is if you're fishing walleyes. Lots of nice pike too.
6351522,fishingMN4eyes,2019-08-20 08:45:00,108,I'd be interested to see what their camp is like these days. We went to Lac Seul Outposts a number of years ago and went back a few times before switching lakes for a couple years and now we ended up on the Northwest part of Lac Seul for the last 5-6 years I think.
6351618,TRapperJones,2019-08-20 13:53:00,36,What part of nw lac seul do you fish the most ..just curious since we will be up there staying at evergreen lodge
6351712,jimirjr,2019-08-20 18:15:00,1149,LOL ! Well.... I AM headed up to the Outposts from 9/7 -- 9/14 ! I will STRONGLY second Your Opinion on the Outposts ! EVERYTHING You said is true and right on... Missed last Year's trip... SO... I am REALLY looking forward to This Years trip !!
6351732,Lmbkiller,2019-08-20 19:33:00,639,"Sorry but if I fished on lac Seul for 7-8 days and only caught 103 walleyes (even if I didn't target them 100% of the time), I would be looking for a new lake to fish. If you're happy with that, great, I wouldn't be, but to each their own"
6351816,wooglin,2019-08-21 06:56:00,371,"Well, we didn't get out before 8/9AM, came in for a lunch pretty much every day, and targeted musky pretty much every day after lunch. And, when we found fish, we didn't sit on them for 8-10 hours - that'd be boring. So, could we have caught 500 walleye? Sure, but that means fishing for nothing else, and not exploring other parts of the lake and sitting on Pecker Point all day, every day. Boorrringgg. We caught limits every day and ate fish every day as well, so it's not like we starved. To each his own."
6351818,wooglin,2019-08-21 06:57:00,371,"Good luck, I'm interested to hear how things go for you. Do you fish pike/muskie at all? We found bigger fish in Wasepi off wind blow points. PM me if you want, I can share info if you'd like! Safe travels!"
