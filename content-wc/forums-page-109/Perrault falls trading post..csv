6360998,Goat,2019-09-26 22:43:00,23,P s . I noticed the handicapped ramp. No way it could have been Dintys. Back then that was unheard of.
6361300,prov1900,2019-09-28 07:12:00,544,"My father knows Denise really well, in fact he used to take trips up there, in the 50's and up until the early 90's, just to see her. He still stays in touch with her. I believe they live in Alberta now."
6361952,prov1900,2019-10-01 06:09:00,544,"Spoke with my dad this weekend, their last name was ""Parades"". Denise's dad was Denny. Her grandfather was Louie. He referred to the camp they ran was ""Fallview"" Camp. His first trip was there in 1955. Part of belonging to FFA, (Future Farmers of America) was that at graduation, they were taken on a Canadian fishing trip. He formed a fast friendship with their family and still maintains contact with them today. I have met them and talk with them often as well. My father is in very poor health and has suffered stroke(s) recently. His time is limited and his cognitive ability is diminishing rapidly. When I told him about this post, he really perked up and remembered it like it was yesterday. Thank you for bringing this post to light. Small world...."
6361964,Goat,2019-10-01 07:32:00,23,Thanks for the added information. Born in 1944 I was quite young at that time. We would buy a block of ice at Denny store about twice a week for our ice box. No electricity at our cabin. It was about 5 miles to the store on the gravel red lake road. Denise had a pretty cousin about my age. Her name was Evette if I remember right. She rode with us to mass at ear falls a couple of times. We spent three months every summer up there until about 1960. Some good memories.
6361968,prov1900,2019-10-01 07:44:00,544,"My dad never was big into fishing, but his fascination with your beautiful country and the friendships he made up there sure spurred my interest. Now, and for the last 20 years, my mind is always on my next fishing trip to Ontario."
6361988,Goat,2019-10-01 09:05:00,23,Just found denis paradis obituary after doing some research. A good man.http://yourlifemoments.ca/sitepages/...asp?oid=410541
6362086,Goat,2019-10-01 14:45:00,23,I would love to go again but with old age and some disability it would not be practical. Back in the 50s and 60s there were no limits and no rules as far as fishing went. We caught about 9 northerns to one walleye . The fishing from then will never be as good. Almost never caught anything under three pounds. Threw most of them back. Many times while reeling in a three pounder a much larger northern would try to eat it as we got it up to the boat. Trolling with artificial bait is what we did mostly with good results. The K.B spoon was a killer as well as the daredevil.
6362090,Goat,2019-10-01 14:55:00,23,"After moving from blue lake , near vermillion bay, in about 1954 I think. My dad built a cabin on scout lake. We fished scout lake and took yearly boating trips out to lac seul. 20 or30 miles usually . The big lake got some huge waves for our 16' boat sometimes. We camped on islands overnight to avoid the bears and wolves. A great adventure for me and my two older brothers. McKenzie bay and broad and sunlight lakes."
6360918,Goat,2019-09-26 16:49:00,23,"Does o anyone remember Dintys little store at Perrault falls in the early 50s ?They had a gravel lot in front with gas pumps, an ice house to the left. They sold ice blocks, groceries, sundries, and 6-12 insect repellent . The best at that time. The last name was French and started with a P. Right next to the falls."
6360932,billy weaver,2019-09-26 17:33:00,470,"Would that be Dutchies Trading Post? It is still there and doing business as usual. Have stopped there every year for over 30 years. It has changed hands a few times but still offers good service. I always order a flat of nightcrawlers from them and pick them up, purchase license and a few other items."
6360936,jackpotjohnny48,2019-09-26 17:45:00,153,"I also remember the store in Perrault Falls as being named ""Dutchies."" I haven't been in Perrault Falls in about 8 or 9 years, though, so I haven't been in there personally, but it sounds like they are still in business (based on the prior reply). Is this the store you are referring to? It's the one on the left hand side (the west side) as you're heading north."
6360964,bearfvr13,2019-09-26 20:31:00,174,"dutchiesgeneralstore.comThis picture is an older one, possibly what you may remember it looking like. Chuck"
6360970,Goat,2019-09-26 20:54:00,23,"I remember the perrault falls store front sign saying dintys trading post. Several years before and at a different location than Dutchies store. At that time, about 1954, dutchie, the current owner of dutchies store, and prominent local businessman and community leader, worked at Durochers scout lake camp as a fishing guide. After his work at scout lake camp dutchie opened a dry ice freezer service in ear falls. From what I read on line dutchie is up in years and still active in ear falls politics. I was 10 years old in 1954 and have fond memories of growing up at my dads summer homestead on scout lake."
6360974,Goat,2019-09-26 21:11:00,23,"P.S. I think the owner of dintys was dinty parade or paradie ,not sure. Had a beautiful daughter named Denise. My older brother was allowed to take her out for a date in my dads 1957 ford."
6360980,Goat,2019-09-26 21:30:00,23,There was a mando logging camp close to perrault falls. I remember going there to see lumberjack competition. I was most impressed with the log rolling competition. They also had a free movie on Saturday nights. Wooden benches and a lot of cigarette smoke.
6360982,billy weaver,2019-09-26 21:40:00,470,"Dutchies ad says it was established in 1952. I get a kick out of the statement in their ad that says located in downtown Perrault Falls. Dintys Store would have been where from Dutchies present store. Same side of the road, north or south? Was it located in downtown Perrault Falls? (just kidding) Billy"
6360984,Goat,2019-09-26 22:00:00,23,That looks like it could be the same store after it was named dinties trading post. Not sure.
6360990,Goat,2019-09-26 22:10:00,23,Dutchy was working at Durochers scout lake camp in 1952 as a guide. Dintys was located just north of the falls on the east side of the red lake road. Dintys was prolly built in 1952 and thus the claim. Perrault falls was the only settlement and gas station between vermillion bay and ear falls at that time.
