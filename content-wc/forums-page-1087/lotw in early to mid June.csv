I am taking 4 youths and my brother and would like to be able to boat a couple decent size Northern and Walleys during the week. Our rental is out of Kenora and we will be mainly fishing the North end of lotw. If anyone could give some advice about where to fish and what type of fishing (trolling with spinners, trolling with top water, jig fishing, slip bobbers etc.) it would greatly be appreciated."
