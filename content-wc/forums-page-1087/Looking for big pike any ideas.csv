The fish average about 8/10 lbs due to the influx of smelt which appeared about 10 years ago. Many trophy fish are now showing up with 20 lbers common. Sping time is good as long as you get here within 3 weeks of ice out, any later and you will have to fish deep as the large pike need 50 degree water. (spoons) Mid summer is my favorite time as I enjoy fishing with downriggers, and no one else is out in the depths doing this. Fall is another great time as the big fish will go shallow and casting comes back into play.Husky jerk's (#14) will work wonderful for this. All in all I bet it would be tough to beat Rainy for pike right now as the lake is exploding with unbelievable growth rates. Hope this helps.Jeff from Great Waters Outfitting"
