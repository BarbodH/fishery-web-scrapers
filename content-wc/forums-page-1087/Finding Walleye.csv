506810,Guest,2000-01-15 21:00:00,0,"Points, dropoffs, weedbeds, sunken islands will get you started. I really like to fish the windblown side of the lake. Usually if I am on a lake I am not familiar with I will long-line troll a #9 floating rapala in 8 to 12 feet of water until I contact a fish. This helps me cover water and learn the lake a little faster. This method of trolling is hardly ever talked about and I can't figure out why. Once a fish is caught I will stop and usually jig or worm-harness the area. If I can establish a pattern of where I am catching most of the fish,then I will look for more of those areas. My personal favorite, although one that is tough to find on lakes without maps, is underwater humps or sumerged islands."

This is a very breif way I use to locate & catch walleye, hope I have helped you."
