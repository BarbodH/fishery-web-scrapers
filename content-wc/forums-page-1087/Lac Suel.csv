His was caught from my boat, so I'm taking credit for finding it for him! ;-) I've seen a 17 punder out of there. Minnitaki, which is just a few miles away, has a pretty fair number of larger trout. Big Vermillion is right up there on my list of favourite lakes. If it had Walleye, it'd be #1!"
506650,Guest,2000-01-14 22:20:00,0,"I have being fishing Lac Suel in the winter for over 15 years now. Lac Suel is especially sweetfor the awesome riding it offers, the lake is very safe to run as long as you know where to take caution. The best area is at the top end of the lake (Adamhay Lake), The MNR closed it after Dec 1st many years ago due to the popularity it was receiving. The fishing was unbelievable back then when it was open. It's touch and go in the end of Nov. for safe ice now. We usually depart from the Vermillion Lake Road and sled in through Scaler Lake during the mid winter trips. We use Cabela's Alaskan Alagnack style winter tents with wood heat(very comfortable) and camp where we find fish, which is quite easy as most basin's adjacent to the rivermouth area's have hoards of staging walleye's. The wind and temperature can quickly turn deadly for the unprepared, Lac suel can produce some serious wind as the weather line is right on top of you. Otter resort pull behind's are the ticket for cold days. I am not running any trips this year as I am mending fused vertabrae's in my neck. I can add additional trips for 2001 if your interested.Jeffemail me at [email protected]Great Waters Outfitting"
506642,jellis,1999-12-12 17:11:00,1,Need help with cabin on or near Lac Suel for first week in June 2000. 3 guys going. Never been there. Thanks for the helpJimbo
506643,TeeDub,1999-12-12 22:57:00,48,"Deerpath Lodge is on Big Vermillion Lake, between Sioux Lookout and Hudson and about a mile to a good boat launch on Lac Seul. Big Vermillion has excellent Lake Trout, Smallies, Northern and Muskie. You probably know about Lac Seul!Give Rick Tinney a call at 807-737-1050, or e-mail him at [email protected] Tell him TeeDub sent you. My wife and I stayed at Deerpath this past August and fished both Lac Seul and Big Vermillon. The cabins are excellent, the rates were good and the fishing was even better. I used to live in that area and miss it a lot. Going back ice fishing in March!"
506651,Guest,1999-12-16 16:59:00,0,"If this is first time in Canada, Lac Suel is giant lake, dangerous and not a place to start your Canadian fishing adventures(in my opinion). I have fished all over NW Ontario for 40 years and yes, I have fished in Lac Suel. Great Lake but in a weeks time you will spend at least 1-2 days of your vacation standing on the dock watching the waves roll in! Recommend only with a guide and large boat! For a safer lake consider Southbaylodge.com 14,000 acre Confederation Lake safe, remote, quality fish (plus I own it!)"
506652,MP35,1999-12-24 14:14:00,19,"JimboWhat side of LS do you plan to fish? I am very familiar with the west side and can help you with info. I have fished the west side for a total of 17 weeks in the past 6 years. The lake is BIG and reccomend that you get a guide the first day or so to help with location of fish and what presentations are working at that time. Would reccomend a GOOD lake map and a GPS unit. As the other post stated, it can get rough on that lake, I have only been grounded once in all the time I've been up there. Usually, I leave early and return late to miss the famed LS chop. The wind does blow but usually doesn't really kick up until mid morning and subsides by early evening. Oh, I run a 17' bassboat and get around the lake with minimal troubles.The lake has a very good population of walleyes and fishing is generally good to very good in June. There are many days of 50 fish per person if you know where to fish!"
506653,Guest,1999-12-28 11:32:00,0,"This will be my first trip to Lac Seul this July. My group is going to stay at Scout Lake Resort. I choose this resort because (1) it's pretty resonably priced, (2) It's on a smaller lake connected to Lac Seul so on bad weather days I can still fish the smaller lakes close to the cabin, and (3) it's a ways from Ear falls and what seems to be where all the other resorts are crammed in. Like I said, I haven't been there yet. I'm not a tourney-quality fisherman and I go for the experience and relaxtion as much as for the fishing. But since it is on Lac Seul I do expect the fishing to be better than what I have here in Iowa. Just MHO."
506644,RMB,2000-01-13 19:11:00,251,"I have been going to Souix Lookout/Hudson now for 3 years running and am just dying to know when and where a guy can go ice fishing on Lac Suel. My fishing partner and I both have snow machines with pull behind portables, so we are pretty mobile. My big concern is safety. Is there anyone who guides or runs an ice fishing service around there? Any help or info. would be greatly appreciated....."
506645,TeeDub,2000-01-13 23:51:00,48,"In all the years I lived there, about eight, I've never ice fished on Lac Seul. With the current running through, there's a lot of unsafe ice out there. My bro-in-law still has a snowmobile down there somewhere in about 60 ft. and he's lived there all his life. I have relatives and friends in the area that I communicate with via e-mail. I'll see what I can find out for you. My plan at the end of March is to stick with the locals and fish some of the smaller lakes in behind Hudson for Walleye and Big Vermillion for Lakers! Some of the small lakes produce some nice Eyes, probably because it's so tough to get a boat into them during the summer months."
506646,RMB,2000-01-14 08:24:00,251,"Thanks! Any info. you could obtain for me would be greatly appreciated. I would also think that there must be a lot of smaller lakes that have some incredible fishing for eyes that are inaccessable in the summer months by boat or plane. Problem is, it's pretty hard to wander out somewhere you've never been before. Especially in the winter. Also, it's a long drive from Minneapolis to make and time is always an issue. If you can find out any more, feel free to send me an email at ""[email protected]"""
506647,TeeDub,2000-01-14 13:09:00,48,"RMB, see my first response to this string and send an e-mail to Rick Tinney. He's a very good friend of mine and owns a camp close to Hudson. I'm not certain if any of his guides do ice-fishing trips or not, but Rick can certainly steer you in the right direction. I do know that he has a few ice fishermen come into his camp each winter. He's also honest enough, that if he can't help you himself... he'll point you to someone who can. Tell him if he doesn't... Terry won't show him where the big trout are anymore! ;-)"
506648,RMB,2000-01-14 16:00:00,251,Thanks! I'll do that....PS How big are the Lakers you're getting up there?
