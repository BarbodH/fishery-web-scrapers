506822,Guest,2000-01-14 15:23:00,0,"I purchased a Bottom Line NCC 5300 and a couple of Cannon DT-20 Downriggers. I want to purchase the downrigger master interface cable, the downrigger slave cable, a NCC Sonar/GPS dual cartridge reader and finally an autoPilot interface cable. Apparently Cabelas doesn't carry these items anymore. Does anyone know from who I can order these items from. All help greatly appreciated.Big k"
