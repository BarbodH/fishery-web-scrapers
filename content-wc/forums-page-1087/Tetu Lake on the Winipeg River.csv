As far as fishing, I've heard mixed responses but from what I hear it will be fairly decent. I fish on the Manitoba side of the border, not far from tetu and the fishing is excellent. The only difference between here and there is the muskie population. Tetu has them, but downriver it is extremly rare to find one. As for the boat launch, I've never seen one, but I'd guess that there would most definately be one."

You can put your own boat in there and either camp or boat to their island. In either case case it is extremely inexpensive. Call 608-857-3903 for info.
