I live in the Edmonton area and have fished many of the lakes within driving distance. Don't sell Alberta too short when it comes to big Walleye. There's still 10 lb. plus fish to be caught. Calling has some monsters although it's catch and release only and we caught a 31 incher that pushed the 10 lb. mark at Lesser Slave this past summer."
