I am looking for a drive in place north of Minnesota to take my boat(16'with 75 HP). I am mainly interested in walleyes and numbers. Chance for a big eye, pike or musky would be great also.Suggestions?Thanks in advance for the input."

In the most recent issue of InFisherman, Red Lake was identied as one of the top ten Walleye lakes in Ontario.Nice numbers and size of Walleyes, a large pike is usually caught, and lake trout are available. The lodge I'd highly recommend is Sunset Lodge. Rene is the owner and he works his tail off to make sure everyone has a super time. If you're interested in booking a reservation, you'd better hurry. I talked to him last night and he only has 3-4 slots available (for the month of August). Most of his business is repeat customers which should give you an indication of his customer friendly attitude. It will probably cost in the neighborhood of $280-300 U.S. for lodging and dock rental for 7 days. His phone is 807.727.2683 - you can mention my name if you decide to contact him.P.S. I'd suggest a guide $75/day for your first day on the lake. They can put you on some spots quickly."

506789,Guest,2000-01-12 09:52:00,0,"I would highly recommend Lake St Joseph. It's about as far as you can drive to, just 20 miles south of Pickle Lake, where the road ends. Lake St Joe was also on the In Fisherman list of the top ten Ontario walleye lakes in the latest issue. I would also highly recommend The Old Post & Village. The Old Post is one of only three camps on the lake and is by far the best. John Grace and his staff are fantastic. Check out thier website at http://www.oldpost.com/."
506790,Guest,2000-01-13 14:14:00,0,"My recommendation would be Paradise Cove Lodge at Minaki, Ontario on the Winnepeg River. The location affords excellent walleye fishinglots of 6 to 10 lbs. (also Northern, Muskie and Bass) on island protected waters of Little and Big Sand Lakes (and others easily reachable with your 75HP, 16'). Resort owner Duane **** is dedicated to fishing, guiding and helping in any way he can to see you have a successful trip. Rates are modest ($180 Canadiaan per person). Owner can be reached before March at 206-439-7341."
