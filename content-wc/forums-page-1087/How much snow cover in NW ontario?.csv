506825,Guest,2000-01-15 20:28:00,0,Anyone have a feel for how much snow cover NW Ontario is getting this winter? We are going to fish Hammerhead Lake in the Caribou Provencial Park this year. Last year the snow cover was pretty sparse and subsequently the water level was the lowest that it had been in 10 years. Hammerhead is on the Gammon River Flowage.

Last year the snow was abnormally sparse, and this year we are getting average. On the ice, my estimate would be between 6"" and 10"". Hope this helps"
