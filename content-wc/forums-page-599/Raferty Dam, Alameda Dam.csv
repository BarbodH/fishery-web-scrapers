1048637,KidWalleye,2008-08-11 18:41:00,557,Fished raferty Dam Last thursday perfect weather but fishing was pretty slow. ened up catching 6 nice 3-4lb fish on spinners and gulp worms. Went to Alameda Dam and fished Friday and Saturday. The Small fish were out of control both days. cought between 100 and 150 fish both days. it didnt matter what you had in the water or how deep/shallow you were they ate it. I cought fish pulling Salmo hornets 10 feet down over 30 feet of water. It did seem that Green worked a little better then other colors but everything worked. would be a great place to get the kids hooked right now. Gary

Live in Estevan so it is only a 10 minute drive. Considering the dog days of summer we have been happy with the catch, and not very many pencils in the bunch. I usually let anything over 3 lbs go, too nice to keep. Considering the 3 fish limit, some days it doesn't take long to pull the boat out of the water. Haven't made it to Alameda yet, so any pointers on where to go there would be great. barry"
1049029,KidWalleye,2008-08-13 12:21:00,557,whwen i was alameda I fished from moose park to the south. one of the best areas i found was a big flat to the north of the islands. it not really a flat but i just dropped off really slow from 6 to 17 feet of water. Early In the morning all the fish were up shallow and gradually went out to the 15 feet area later on in the day. If you were to go from moose park to the closest island and start trolling back to the north you will eventually run into a big drop off that drops all the way down to 40 feet of water. every pass i made I would pull tell i was out in that deeper water so my cranks had time to drop off or that ledge. almost everytime they came off of it I would pick up some of my better fish. i found that the perch and lime green salmo hornets worked best all over the lake. if you run down the East bank all the way to the dam you will see the last point before you get to the Rock lined bank. I Had really good luck trolling that point and back to the north along the sandier bank there. that area seemed to be best early in the morning. I also cought 10-15 really nice perch trolling the real small salmos along that section. Later in the after noon It seemed like the fish all went out deeper along the points on the east side and the filled up with boats real quick as the wind blew pretty good out of the east both days i was there. If you run down toward the dam and circle back around the islands there is a pretty good channel that runs for a way back up behind the islands. I trolled to the north along the east side of that channel and had good luck. while following that chennel you will go right by a small island after you get past it that channel seems to dissapearand it get pretty shallow. There were some real good mud lines coming off of the island so i put down my trolling motor and got up to them and found it to only be 4-5 feet deep. I figured what the heck sence i was up there i might as well try it so i started casting the salmos and cought about 40-50 ten to fourteen inch fish.. anything green seemed to do the trick I pulled bottom bouncers and spinners with gulp worm and green blades and cought alot of fish that way to. allot of the fish i cought were spitting up fresh water shrimp and some of the larger fish in the livewell were spitting up crayfish. thats about all i can think of. If you have anymore3 questions just as and ill try and answer then Gary
1049078,oldblue2008,2008-08-13 17:02:00,313,"thanks for the advice. I sure hope I can fit in a trip there soon. Will try your suggestions. I see you are heading to Tobin in mid Oct. My nephew and buddies fish there in early Oct and usually fish at nite, up towards the dam. They usually have pretty good luck and catch quite a few in the 8-12 lb range. barry"
1049091,KidWalleye,2008-08-13 18:57:00,557,"Yea you really cant beat Tobin in october. we have never really went up river from twin marina. We do most all our fishing down stream around the cabin, white rock, and eagles nest. Picked up my biggest walleye ever last year. she was 31.5'' and 13.3 lbs. cought her in the middle of the day at white rock drifting lindies and a leach. we to do most of our fishing at night you just have to be there durring a full moon to get the good night bight. we are going up OCT. 13-18 this year with the full moon being the night of the 14th. I have been counting down the days for the last 6 months. are there any other good lakes within and hour or two of raferty as raferty and alameda are the only two that i have fished down in that area. thanks Gary"
1049117,oldblue2008,2008-08-13 20:47:00,313,"I guess the only other good lakes nearby are Last Mountian, nw of Regina and probably Lake of the Prairies east of Yorkton. I haven't fished either of them, but there was a mention of LM back on Aug 5th barry"
