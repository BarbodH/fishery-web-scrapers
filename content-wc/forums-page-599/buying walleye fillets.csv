I found a couple of web sites that sell fresh frozen canadian fish and just wonder if anyone has any experience with this type of operation and how the fish were? I would prefer to catch them myself but thats probably a 6 thousand mile round trip for us. They explain that the fish are caught by the indians under their subsistance license the same system that i would complain about previously for using nets. or not?"
1048441,manitobawalleye,2008-08-10 15:37:00,885,subsistance netting is not for selling fish in Manitoba...... contact Gimli Fish Market up here in Winnipeg.... they could/would probably ship to you the fish here have gone thru Manitoba Freshwater Marketing Board or at least been part of a commercial quota.
1048624,fishncamp,2008-08-11 17:22:00,49,I agree.
1048625,fishncamp,2008-08-11 17:23:00,49,I agree.....Gimli Fish is a good choice.....Manitoba Freshwater Fish Marketing Board exports fish all over the world. It will probaly still be flippin' its tail when it gets to Vegas
