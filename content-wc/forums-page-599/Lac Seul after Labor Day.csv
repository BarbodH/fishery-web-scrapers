We are staying on the Ear Falls end. I'm wondering if anyone can give me any tips on what to expect in terms of presentation and location for walleye on that end of the lake. I was up late July last year the water was really high with horrible fishing. I'm hoping this won't be a repeat but I understand the water is even higher than last year. Thanks, Chris"
1047454,Guest,2008-08-05 14:16:00,0,Got back from Lac Seul in the Ear Falls area July 25. Water was very high and we did not do well. When were were about to leave I asked my outfitter how fishing was in Sept. He said it slows down a little but September is the month when some of his guests dont come back to the cabin and have to sleep overnight on a island because of bad weather and high winds.
1047467,mwal,2008-08-05 15:11:00,151,I have fished the 3rd week of Sept on Lac Suel. We caught nice fish but not the quantity that we get in July. The quality was there with 29 inch being largest but alot of 24 to 26 inchers. We fished steep drops off of sand banks and in main lake basin deep 30 t0 60 ft. We had 75 to 35 weather that week and nasty wind. 1st night 75 and last day 75 and calm. Rest of week 35f 30 mph wind. I would go again and I would bring my snowmobile suit and boots along with my shorts to be prepared for anything. Mwal

Otherwise, like Sept> less boat traffic and fishing can be great. Yes, weather can be on the cool side but then have been snowed on in June! Have never fished LS after the 2nd week of Sept.. Overall, just go.... don't get much better than LS!"
1047876,Mike Kansas,2008-08-07 08:19:00,1463,"We have fished below the dam at Ear falls in September. With the lake being high I would imagine that the dam discharge is high. A large dam discharge make the fishing there very good. Access is avaliable at a public boat ramp in Ear Falls. If you have a boat you might want to try it a day or two. There is also a resort (Little Canada Camp) below the dam that may be able to rent you a boat. We have always had the best luck fishing the north shore just below the safety pylons at the dam. if the flow is high you will need to have some heavier jigs 3/4 to 1 oz. Best luck has been with minnow/jig in the past. Any questions email me. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1048072,Guest,2008-08-08 04:23:00,0,"Have you fishe any other areas below the dam? The public boat ramp>how big of a boat can you get in there? Is it like most of Canada, water hazards? Have thought of trying the river when the breeze picks up on the main lake. Thanks for the info."
1048100,cspierings,2008-08-08 08:05:00,230,We have fished below the dam a couple times in the past but much earlier in the year. Thanks for the tip. As to how hazardous it is with a boat a lot depended on the year and how much water was coming through. I think high water can be a worse since you might not see the rock that tears up your lower unit.
1048473,new hips,2008-08-10 19:14:00,498,"Just came back, we drove past the dam and a lot of discharge. Check water levels,http://www.lwcb.ca/. We have fished in September on Lac Seul the previous last 6 yrs. Always check deep water 40-50, saugers especially mixed in with walleye. One year we went the 3rd week and really hit a cold front for about 2 days, never again that late I swear it was almost snowing, usually windy. Big fish usually not as many."
1048562,lcwhit,2008-08-11 10:57:00,104,went up there the week b4 labor day a couple of years ago. i was out of my guide wear bibs for 4 hours all week. windy and cool. rained a little every day. fishing poor and all fish we found were deep. 30-40 feet plus. tough week. i'll never go back that time of year. too much of a wimp.
