1049167,kansasity,2008-08-14 07:15:00,80,"All that I have heard on Halley's has been great. It is a drive up their though. Last year me and my wife went just north of Emo and kinda regreted not driven into Canada more, to see more of the country. This year, I am going with a group of guys that have been to this place. Well a couple have. So when I return on Sept. 10 or whatever it is I will leave some info on what I thought. We leave Sept. 2. This place is supposed to have fenominal smallie, wally, and pike fishing. Last year was my first year. I was dissapointed not being able to pin down the walleye untill the the last 3 days of our 7 day trip! But when I found them, I found them. Good luck, Little Moose Lodge is another good one to look at."
1049184,GNO,2008-08-14 08:03:00,153,We have a boat in outpost located on Pipestone Lake that you may want to checkout. It is located towards the top end of the lake up by the Northwest Arm. The Pipestone chain is a phenomenal smallmouth fishery.www.gatewaynorthoutfitters.net

1049362,Outfitter17,2008-08-14 20:40:00,127,"Gateway north does have a very nice outpost on the top end of pipestone if you are looking for an outpost. I think the northend is better than the south IMPO, a lot less traffic."
1048844,kansasclipper,2008-08-12 18:42:00,79,We are looking to do a boat in trip where we can catch big smallmouth. Any recommendations. We are thinking in the Ontario area north of minnesota.
1048857,Obabikon,2008-08-12 19:31:00,2370,"Lake of the Woods has great small mouth fishing! That said, we're a boat in camp... take a look! www.obabikon.com"
1048860,kansasclipper,2008-08-12 19:49:00,79,Boat-in or drive-in is fine with us. We just want to catch tons of fish and still get the remote trip.
1048915,Guest,2008-08-13 05:33:00,0,"Try Wine Lake it is a 26 mile boat in trip across Wabaskang Lake. Have been going there for 8 years and it is remote. No electricity, running water or bathroom in cabins. Nice outhouses and they do have a shower house. check it out at www.winelakecamp.com."
1048916,@Lunker,2008-08-13 05:43:00,835,"www.witchbay.com on Lake of the Woods which, as Obabikon said, has great smallie fishing.It's remote....camp road is 7 miles long, closest resort on the water is 10 miles away."
1048934,kansasclipper,2008-08-13 06:43:00,79,Thanks for the info. Keep it coming. We are looking hard at Pipestone Fly-in Outposts. He has a boat-in to a lake that connects to the pipestone chain of lakes.
1049032,PRD1,2008-08-13 12:35:00,458,"You might look at Halley's Camps which is NW of Minaki. You can drive into one of their camps (Caribou Falls), and boat or fly into the other two camps on Umfreville lake. Good smallmouth population and we get 18 to 20 inch fish every year. You would also get into walleye and pike. They also have some flyout outposts but I haven't tried any of them."
1049070,IaDave,2008-08-13 15:32:00,476,"I second Halley's Camps- First time there for an old jig fisherman for Walleyes- First smallie ever for me in Canada- 17"". Caught numerous the rest of the week. Going back again next year."
1049110,Guest,2008-08-13 20:13:00,0,"I used to fish a place called Rons Lodge on Fowl Lake..its in the Boundary waters of Mn, but you have to acess it from Ontario...only negative is you need both Canadian and Mn liscense.. Great Smallmouth fishing here.www.ronslodge.com"
1049127,Nimstug,2008-08-13 21:23:00,2605,"Kansas,Man, I hate to give this up because so many people pass it by and I'd like to keep it for myself, but you asked.Look into Camp Narrows on the far west end of Rainy Lake. It's about 15 miles west and 15 miles north of Fort Frances. The website is www.campnarrows.com. Tom runs a great camp and is tuned into what's going on. Always places well in the Fort Frances bass tournament.The boat ride from the ramp is about 7 miles. If you don't have a boat, they pick you up. Good cabins, both make it yourself or American plans. Electric and in cabin pots and showers. Wood pellet burning stoves for heat if it's chilly.Lots of great smallmouth fishing structure with islands, reefs and sharp drop-off. Coves and cuts open into what feels like smaller lakes. If you want to get out of the wind you can, or you can get blown across the lake. Lot of 'eyes and pike too. It is a little know fact that catching smallmouth bass on topwater lures is the most fun you can have with your clothes on, so keep that in mind. The son and I have been twice and I hope we'll be going back next year. This year my wife and I are spending a week at the far east end of Rainy at Kettle Falls. We leave in a week!NimstugAny team can have a bad century.-J. Brickhouse"
