Most were caught on the north part of the lake. Nothing large, most were in then 14""-18"" with the largest at 21"". We found a couple nice spots in the south end in the beginning of the week when the wind was out of the southwest but a small cold front pushed the wind more to the north and that shut down most of those fish. Most eyes were caught jigging with crawlers or Gulp. Partner and I did well with the color ""New Penny"" and the smelt. Early in the week prior to the front we were getting fish in 4-6 fow. Post front pushed them to 10-18'. Later in the week found them back in the shallows. Surface temp was around 70. Trolling also proved effective not only for eyes but with most of the northerns also caught with shad raps and flicker shads. One of our guys had multiple catches of 30""+ northerns on a crawfish pattern jointed shad rap. All in all it was another great trip for the books. Lots of laughs and comraderie not to mention some great meals. Moving on to Glitter Lake next year a little earlier in July. So if anyone has any experience with that lake, I would be anxious to hear about your suggestions."
