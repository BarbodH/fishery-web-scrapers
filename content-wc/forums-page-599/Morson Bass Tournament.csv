Walleyes, muskies, northerns, crappies (in order) all come before bass. (not that the bass fishing is bad) I'm here in June, when you can go out there and catch 20 big fatties full of eggs in an evening (casting shorelines). So, I never really had the motivation to try to fish for them in August. But, I think I'll try to improve before next year's tournament. Honestly, we lost a couple of big fish on day one, that would've put us in the 15LB range and in contention. We needed a 20+ lb box, and it just wasn't going to happen. Anyhow... Terry Gill's team won it. He's a great guy and a heck of a bass fisherman!"
1049520,Obabikon,2008-08-15 14:10:00,2370,I'm fishing tomorrow in the tournament. My first competitive fishing tournament. It should be lots of fun!
1049530,dutchboy,2008-08-15 14:32:00,5717,Good luck!! Hope ya whack 'em.
1049712,Obabikon,2008-08-16 15:28:00,2370,Well... we defiantely didn't whack 'em. The flu/food poisoning hit me at 7:15 this morning. I was yacking out the side of the boat in front of all the other entries (and through out the rest of the day). Today was the toughest day of fishing I've ever had. We'll need a big day tomorrow to do anything!
1049721,rockpt,2008-08-16 16:10:00,589,I thought chumming was against the rules. Who's leading?
1049730,Obabikon,2008-08-16 17:04:00,2370,Terry Gil is first with 16.5 lbs (or somewhere there abouts)
1049743,rockpt,2008-08-16 19:36:00,589,Gibbons boys in the running?
1049767,Obabikon,2008-08-17 04:45:00,2370,Yeah... Jason and Oliver are less than a pound off the lead (in 4th)
1049857,dewyg,2008-08-17 16:59:00,1006,Who won the tourney?
1049866,Obabikon,2008-08-17 17:30:00,2370,"I'm not sure... I wasn't up to staying until everyone weighed in. We were #11 out of 33 teams (i think)... and I took off right after. Haven't heard who won yet, but I'll let you know if I find out tonight."
1049975,dewyg,2008-08-18 08:36:00,1006,Do you fish for bass much? Or do you mainly fish walleye?
