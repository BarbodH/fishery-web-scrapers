Jason Gibbons is one of my guides and his brother Oliver is a guide at Grassy Narrows Camp. Both awesome fishermen, and they're in great shape to win it! Go get 'em guys! Also, John Gibbons (their Uncle) is a long time guide from the area, and is currently 8th! Good luck Johnny Cash!"
1048187,Obabikon,2008-08-08 16:44:00,2370,Jason and Oliver are still in first! Way to go guys. Looks like it was a slower day for most of day 1's top 10.

It's cool that they tag and release the fish in the same part of the lake they were caught. Jared - have you or your guests ever caught a KBI tagged fish? My hometown of Kansas City is well represented with three teams in the top 20."
1048212,Obabikon,2008-08-08 20:30:00,2370,"Actually, yes. My uncle caught a tagged fish a couple years ago. He wasn't sure what the tag was for."
1048219,rockpt,2008-08-08 21:24:00,589,Cool. Tell Otis I'm sending him a dry cleaning bill for the present he left on my tackle box.
1048235,Obabikon,2008-08-09 05:24:00,2370,haha... will do! I can't believe he did that! Quite embarassing.
1048315,Obabikon,2008-08-09 17:42:00,2370,"2nd place! A great showing. Wish they'd pulled it out, but they really gave it a run!"
