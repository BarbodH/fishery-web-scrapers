1050036,Guest,2008-08-18 12:56:00,0,"Question...we're heading up for our annual Canada trip to Woman River Camp on Saturday. Usually when fishing walleyes we only target areas like deep points/humps where we find lots of fish grouped. But this year I think I want to spend a little time targeting some of the deeper cabbage bed areas of the system as I've heard lots of reports of some of the biggest walleye being taken from these areas. Just curious what kind of methods guys use in Canada when targeting walleyes in the weeds - is this productive? Jigs, cranks, slips - what works best? Minnows, crawlers, artificial? Thanks!"
1050039,Guest,2008-08-18 13:08:00,0,When we fish the weeds in Canada we fish the edge and use a spinner rig with minnow or crawler. I use fireline and just rip through the weeds that way without breaking line. I also use a aberdeen hook so if I do get snagged it will straigten out. It is a lot of fun when they are biting this way.
1050091,Bill Krejca,2008-08-18 18:21:00,6107,"One of my favorite rigs is a jig with a white, chartreuse, or bright orange twister type tail. I attach an over head spinner, usually gold, for some flash, and like to have the head painted a bright orange or chartreuse. The way I figure it, the fish probably will not see the bait very long in the weeds, so it pays to give them something that stands out. Any kind of jig head will work, but I've come up with one that will not catch the weeds. I pour my own jig heads, but modify a ""shad dart"" jig mold to accept the eye of the hook at the front of the head, rather than the middle, as the mold is made. This rig slides over almost all the weeds, even when fished near bottom, and ensures a higher percentage of non-weedy retrieves. Plus, the slanted head seems to create just a bit more action for the tail. I have not found this type of rigging to be much better than other types of bait for water that isn't weedy, but it is for sure my go-to outfit for fishing the green stuff. Oh, yeah, super glue the tail on, so it will stay. Bill Krejca"

He's nosing the boat toward shore into the weeds with 4 to 6 f.o.w. then backing out and nosing in again a few feet down the shore line. While I'm pitching a jig and minnow off the front, I'm thinking does this guy know what he's doing? The rod bends and I boat a 31"" walleye. The guide said stirring up the weeds brought the fish in to feed on what got stirred up. We picked up a lot of 'eyes that way. It's worth a try.NimstugAny team can have a bad century.-J. Brickhouse"

1050202,Guest,2008-08-19 08:42:00,0,We just returned from Antenna lake a few weeks ago and we found eyes in and around cabbage weeds all over the lake. We just used the same jig a tail as we use on points and humps. When they are in the weeds they are looking for something to eat...you never know so try it. terry
1050214,Guest,2008-08-19 09:36:00,0,"We've also had good luck fishing the weeds with the same jig/bait combinations that work everywhere else, especially when the walleye are on the edge of the weedline. If they're right in the cabbage, we have suceess tossing into open spots using a slip bobber, or even a regular bobber if it's shallow enough. I like using a lighter weight jig head, with a full size twister tail, figuring it will flutter and sink slower, since it doesn't have far to travel. A twitch or two will usually trigger a strike. Keeping the boat noise to a minimum is critical."

1050475,joeman79,2008-08-20 13:40:00,417,I booked the first week in Aug on Lac Seul at Lost Island Lodge for next year. I hope that works then cause I love fishin for bass and catchin walleye.
