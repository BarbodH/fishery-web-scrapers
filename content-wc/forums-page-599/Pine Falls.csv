Any information in general. When is the best fishing? Is it freasable to drive back and forth from Winnepeg? I would like to go in late Sept. Is the bite usually on by then? Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much."

Naturally, he did better than us. This was Lockport, not Pine Falls. I have some pre-marked maps for both areas if you are interested. Another helpful website is from on the WC's members. REELMAN spends a lot of time up there and has very helpful info on his site, listed below. www.reelwalleye.com/ Only been there once, and am dying to get back. Like I said, we were impressed with Cats on the Red. www.catsonthered.net/ Any more questions, PM me. I can't go this year, so I have to live vicariously through you. GO, IT IS TOTALLY WORTH IT, AND CHEAP. BTW, Stu McCay, owner of Cats on the Red, will keep you posted as to when the bite is on, so keep your calendar slightly open. We were there in October last year, about the 3rd week. They were snappin' then."

THe bite for 18""-24"" fish was fantastic last year but there were not as many masters (over 27.5"") caught as in previous years. Laurent Raymond at the Papertown can fill you in on where to fish."

Food is great and theres a bar connected to the hotel. In my opinion you wasting your time in September. Not that you cant have decent fishing but it seems like at pine falls the rough fish are in there really strong untill the colder water comes. We went the first week in October once and caaught a ton of fish, just none of the big walleyes we were targeting. We went back three weeks later and all had no problem catching a fish over 10lbs. I know it can get dang cold but that the price you pay for exceptional fishning."
1048947,Backwater Eddy,2008-08-13 07:15:00,3871,"Depending on what way the winds are from often dictates where the bite will be. After a couple of days of North winds the Red is often hot, west winds and North West, Traverse Bay near Elk Island at Pine Falls turns on. Winds make a big difference in the game plan up there.""Cats on the Red"" is a good base to work from in my experience. If you need anything you can find it near there and it is an hour to the Winnipeg River from Stu's. Booking early is wise.The Papertown Inn, again a good option, is often booked up far ahead of time so if that is your plan be sure to book rooms early...like now. Also, if the winds blow contrary, it is an hour to the Red...so it is a 50/50 deal."
1048968,walley250,2008-08-13 08:17:00,161,What is the water flow like on those river systems so far this year?
1049158,freespoolin,2008-08-14 06:49:00,472,"There is now a tournament scheduled for Oct 25 & 26 on the Winnipeg River at Pine Falls, organized by Laurent Raymond of the Papertown Inn."
1049806,Backwater Eddy,2008-08-17 09:02:00,3871,"The Red was at a normal to a tad low in flow most of the season. Heavy rains to the South in the Headwaters region of the Red will bump it up substantially in the next couple of weeks. Mid September rains will effect fall walleye as will the date they open the gates and locks for winter. The catfish are VERY-VERY fat this season on the Red, and that indicates very good forage availability. That should spell good fall walleye movements again this fall on the Red.You can get flow data from the Canadian hydo site and track flows on both the Red and the Winnipeg river systems."
