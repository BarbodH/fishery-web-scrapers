I do have feelers out to 2 people I know but figure it is unlikely on this short notice so I am putting out additional feelers on this forum. Original party size was 6 but now at 5. Outfitter is Slate Falls in Sioux Lookout. Outpost is Hooker Lake. Send private message if have an interest or need additional information. I have one person very interested but he has no passport. Is there any solution to this problem on such short notice?

He was able to get his passport the same day but you have to go to the state department. We live in the Chicagoland area and there is an office there. You can go that route and get one same day just expect to spend all day sitting around waiting. You'll have to check but not all major cities have them. I think Chicago and Twin cities in the midwest.
