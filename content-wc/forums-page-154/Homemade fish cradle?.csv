But with some of the large northern that we have caught while walleye fishing I was looking to maybe get a cradle. However, looking at some of the prices$$ they get for them I am thinking about making one. Doesn't seem like it would be too difficult...PVC, netting etc. Have any of you made your own? Tips/suggestions. Thanks."

6210026,Mike Borger,2018-06-18 10:42:00,1554,"As someone who uses a cradle all the time DO NOT buy or make one that's open at one or both ends. Both ends need to be closed. Anything else is a recipe for disaster and I speak from experience. Yes, the fish can back or slip out if the end is not closed."
6213990,elway12,2018-06-26 21:28:00,335,Thanks for the great responses. After looking into it I'm going postpone making one and get the one that Bstar posted. I'm hoping it is good quality!
