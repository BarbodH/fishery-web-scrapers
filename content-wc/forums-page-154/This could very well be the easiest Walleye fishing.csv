Any easier, you would not need a rod, the eye's would be just jumping into the boat. I just wish I could find this Ragged wood lake he speak of. Enjoy!https://www.facebook.com/RapalaUSA/v...TA0iXlUiomhzII"
6214748,stjoeguy,2018-06-28 18:07:00,979,Sounds like he's talking about Hidden Bay and Raggedwood Lake:http://hiddenbay.com/raggedwoodlake Winoga Lodge also has a cabin there:http://www.winoga.com/outposts.html
6214794,DaBirdman,2018-06-28 19:47:00,164,"Yep! That's through Hidden Bay Lodge. We'll be going with HBL in August to their Armit Lake outpost camp. If I'm not mistaken, Ragedwood cabin was improved in the last year or two & looks real nice. Shaggy (one of their pilots) likes fishing Ragedwood. Calls it ""stoopid easy"" fishing. Haha"

Went to the mouth of the main feeder stream. I put a handful of the dead minnows on the bench next to me. Used a barbless jig. Had about 5-7' of line out. Literally would lower the jig down, catch a walleye, bring the fish up out of the water, grab the jig and flip off the fish, put on another minnow, and lower it down again. Did that for a couple of hours. Catch rate was about twice shown in the video since we didn't have to do figure eights or deal with treble hooks. The only way to perhaps make it faster would be to use Gulp to reduce having to rebait, but whatcha gonna do with dead minnows?"
