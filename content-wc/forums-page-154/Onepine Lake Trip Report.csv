We had the most favorable weather I have ever seen in well over 20 fly-ins. Never got the rain gear out all week. Temps. ranged from 75-85 degrees all week, was 87 degrees when we returned to Nestor Falls at noon yesterday. I really don't like hot weather, but after a run of ice cold weather/wind the past few years, this was a welcome respite. I had never been to Onepine prior to this year, so the first day was kind of a feeling out process, using the spots marked on our maps from the outfitter. The bite was on, big time, all week. We brought 80 dozen minnows for a group of 5 guys, and were out of minnows by the middle of our third day. The two pounds of leeches we brought went just as fast. Biggest walleye of the week was a 26"" fish, but there were piles of fish over 20"". On medium-light tackle, an honest 3 pound walleye will give an excellent account of itself. Pike fishing was good for the guys who targeted them. There is a portage lake, Strawberry Lake, that is easily accessed with a little effort, and this lake produced a number of bigger pike and walleyes for those who made the trek in there. I estimate that our group of 5 caught between 1,000-1,200 walleyes during our five-night stay. And we did utilize cabin time during the hottest parts of the day. Our cabin had a nice, shaded deck and was very clean and comfortable. Only down side--I live in Upper Michigan, and came back to the news of flooding and closed highway routes. I had to detour around Hayward, Wisconsin, to the south, and cut across to the east and north. Added several hours to an already long drive. It turned out our area received over a foot of rain during the past weekend. I would love to get back to Onepine in the future. Nice smaller lake, easy to navigate, easy to fish, especially during June. There are lots of spots on the lake where a person could get out of the wind, if that were a problem for the smaller camp boats. We didn't do much more than scratch the surface of the places marked on the maps provided, and I'd love to go back and fish it again. Thanks for viewing, and I hope everyone's trip(s) are successful ones. Hard to believe how fast summer is flying by."

Maybe that was a good thing, because the hittable rocks were clearly at or above the water level. And there were a few of them. Ironically, we had bluebird weather for five days, nary a drop of rain, but I returned home to the news that our home base in the western end of the UP received over a foot of rain in two days, causing massive flooding and damage. Lots of washouts and closed roads. I had a nice tour of Hayward, Wisconsin on the way home."
