Please share a trusted bait stop along the way. Always used Billy Bob's in NB but not using 11 this time. Need an easy on/off stop since we are trailering. Thanks, David"

Parrysound should also have a couple bait shops but I'm not familiar with them. Phone number for bait bucket 705-737-2248 and ask for Tom."

Not sure if they can get flats or not as I only have ever gone in to get a dozen minnows at a time during ice fishing season. So definitely google them and give them a call ahead of time.coming north up hwy 400 get off onto Bowest St., and come in maybe a mile. It is on the left hand side. Not good parking if you got a boat so go maybe 2 buildings past and turn into a rough street on the left with a very wide undeveloped shoulder so great parking there. Note, when done, just drive around the ""loop"" to come back out onto Bowes St., head back to 400 and away you go."
