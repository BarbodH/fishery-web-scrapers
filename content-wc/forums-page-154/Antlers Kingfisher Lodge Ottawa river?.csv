You might take a look at Quebec.We had a good trip to Parant Lake Lodge.It also is on a highway but it is a lot less traveled.The cabins were outstanding .Very low priced. Good fishing Pikeman

Lorne Spotwood has Campsites right on the river, a launch, hookups. It is very secluded and on a beautiful stretch of the Ottawa that will give you access to rapids, back bays and lake-like conditions. I still remember collecting fossils that appear on the rocks around the upper islands where the rapids begin. Lorne used to take collectors upriver to the islands many years back. It's within your drive limitations."

Most people went there to ride the ATV trails, or just hang out. The lodge owner said he doesn't get a lot of dedicated fishing guests. That tells you something right there. The river was beautiful!! Also it was gigantic and incredibly deep. We were there in the heat of the summer and and the walleye fishing was slooooow. You can find smallies if you want them. I'm sure if you had the time, you could hunt down some good fishing .... but knowing you a little bit, I'm not so sure you'd enjoy it. I've tried for years and years to find great walleye fishing at a drive-to resort within a 10-12 hour drive of SE PA. I haven't found it yet. Well, unless you count the St. Lawrence River. It doesn't have the numbers of fish that NWO has, but it definitely has bigger ones. The average size on the river just keeps going up ... not to mention the world class smallie fishing."
