The Wifi is only available in close proximity to the dining hall, but seriously, all was good for my first trip there about 2 weeks ago. Also, you may have decent service with your cell phone provider in the area. Under the verizon unlimited plan, you get about 1/2 GB of high speed data included. Some areas of the lake had no signal, but for the most part, service was available in most areas. Sent from my Pixel 2 XL using Tapatalk"
6212900,team walleye,2018-06-24 17:45:00,336,"I have went to Perrault Lake every other year since 2003. I'm thinking it's time for a change. Usually go up 2nd or 3rd week of June. Targeting mostly walleye. Perch, bass, pike and even crappie would be a bonus. Looking in NW Ontario. I live in central Iowa so Ear Falls area is about as far as I want to drive. Will have a group of 3-4 people. WiFi would be a plus so I can FaceTime with the kids. Anyone have any suggestions?"
6213086,Stringbean,2018-06-25 05:32:00,279,"As long as you've come that far, another 35 miles won't make that much difference. Head up to Gullrock which is 11 - 13 miles south of Red Lake. If you have a rainy day and the natives are restless, go into town and check out the history of gold mining in the region. Here is your chance to learn about making a living in the wilderness. Every time I go there, the conversation always comes around to what's happening in the gold mining industry. If you're concerned, take your wife to a jeweler. Never mind how the gold got there. In the meantime, the skies have cleared and it's back to the walleyes."
6213290,Habitual Eyer,2018-06-25 11:59:00,144,I second Gullrock. We go twice a year and has all I we wanted to find in a lake after trekking around for 30 yrs looking. Lakes loaded with walleyes....Wrights should be option A for getting on it.
6213310,Stringbean,2018-06-25 12:41:00,279,"We stay over at Poplar Point Resort. Lee Wright's brother Eddie and his wife Lisa run the place. They have done an outstanding job of updating the buildings, the fish house and the docks. Remember, when you start updating the buildings you have to work with the bank in order to get adequate funding. IMHO you will not meet friendlier people in the resort business. Eddie will go out of his way to ensure that you get on the fish. The only problem I have is a rainy day and we have a camp meeting in his fish house/garage. I don't have a pair of waders high enough to wade through all the BS that floats out of there. And I'm to old to start shoveling."

6213504,Stringbean,2018-06-25 18:53:00,279,"Three weeks ago, I was all set to go this year. I was in the initial stages of loading up on all the groceries that we would need. The leader of the group called and said that since 5 out of the group of 7 could not make it, he was calling the trip off. So much for enjoying a nice trip out in the woods."
6213562,valley366,2018-06-25 21:50:00,193,"I have had great trips to several lodges.This past year I fished Gullrock for the first time. Great action lake and had a lot of 13-16 inch fish with over 20's every day. Was a great action lake as I was fishing with kids we sat on those pods of fish a lot. Five Lakes Lodge is where we stayed. Great lodge, owner and establishment. They pointed us to fishing spots on day 1 and expanded the locations each day based on the reports. Cabins were great. Everything clean, tidy and in working order. Ian runs a great camp and we are heading back there.Another resort have enjoyed in the past is Thaddeus Lake Lodge. Just 45 minutes north of Dryden. Is all gravel roads going into it but wonderful location. Cabins are all functional with everything in working order. Marty runs a clean camp and fishing is great. Several great experiences there from transiting a creek through a culvert to get to adjoining lakes to fishing for big fish around the corner from camp. Nice mix as the main lake has the larger fish but lower numbers and Ord and Moose are more known for numbers. I am sure I will be going back there at some point.Let me know if you want any other info on the above places and I will share.Good luck."
6213582,Walleye2242,2018-06-26 04:54:00,263,head up to gullrock.....i have fished both places over the years....you will be happy you made the choice to go up to gullrock.
6213598,Aspencreek,2018-06-26 06:26:00,2911,"Sorry to hear about that String! If it was me, your group leader and I would now have a Loooooong talk about what went wrong. Starting with who was invited, who did/did not get deposits and why if they are collected who is not getting anything back, etc.etc.etc. 5 guys out of 7, that means just the 2 of you.....holy cats man!"
6213604,rockape,2018-06-26 06:37:00,215,"I would be PISSED! I'd still go. Who bails out that close to departure date? A Canadian fishing trip trumps everything else. We had our smallest group ever this year at 4 due to one of our guys having a stroke. He and his son missed for the first time in years. After that loooooonnnng talk with the leader, I'd be working on assembling another group, and you should be the leader!"
