The larger fish came out of the 15-25' range, where most of the regulars came out of the 8-15' range. However, some waters that have a lot of the regular sized fish do not seem to have any (many) large fish. For example, some out lakes that are known for numbers don't seem to have the quality fish, but you might catch 100 in a day. Others may respond with completely different experiences."
6213806,ILScott,2018-06-26 13:41:00,139,"Willy, What do you consider midsized 17""-19""? Just curious. When I was in Ontariio June 9th-16 we caught many 21""-27"" trolling spinners on bottom bouncers tipped with a worm. Most of the fish we caught in 5-10 feet on windy shores. We used the slow death hook on the spinners. My 12 year olds first time in Canada and bottom bouncing and he loved it. We also searched out beaver huts and was successful around those. Scott"
6213808,WallyWarrior,2018-06-26 13:41:00,2488,Same advice as one of the above. Most folks in our camp were catching fish but they were not large fish. We were told all fish were up in ten feet. We went deeper 20-25 ft and did very well on large fish. I think we caught 20 or so over 28Â”. My seven year old caught this 30.5 inch as well. First trip to Canada for him. https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...c84b258748.jpgSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
