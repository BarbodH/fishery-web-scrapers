6213860,DaBirdman,2018-06-26 15:30:00,164,"Our group (with exception of my dad) is doing our first ever fly-in trip come early August. We chose to do a full week stay, from Saturday to Saturday. We figured the long stay would give us the best chance at hitting decent weather, getting plenty of quality fishing & exploring time, etc. What do most of you ""fly guys"" (and/or gals) do for your trips? Full week or something less? I'd like to do a fly-in trip on an annual basis, but 1-week stays wouldn't be feasible based on cost, vacation leave, and doing other vacations with the rest of my family & other relatives. Are shorter stays just as enjoyable or do you find yourself having to leave just as you start to feel like you're getting settled in? Or will a week-long stay be too much? As I sit here counting the days until we go, I can't fathom getting burnt out on a week-long fly-in trip!"
6213866,jkaup,2018-06-26 15:53:00,56,"We do 7 days but only go every other year. That gives everyone a chance to do a big family trip on the in between years. It would be nice to go every year, but with a young family, I feel like it's pressing your luck! I've been on 4 trips and the 7 days seems to disappear in a hurry. Throw in a two day rainout/windblown stint and you are itching to stay. We tell our guys that it is their vacation, choose how you want to spend your time. Some guys spend a lot of time in camp just relaxing. A 7 day trip allows that. Some guys get up early and have 50-60 eyes boated before breakfast at around 8:30. I'd like to get to where my wife and daughter can go up but 7 days for them may be too long. Give me about 2-3 years and i'll let you know how that trip went."
6213978,Ogoki,2018-06-26 21:07:00,291,"Wife and I for years, have done 9 or 10 days. Year before last , our best day was the last day with four pike over 40 inches."
6214028,jveri,2018-06-27 06:04:00,70,"We always do 7 days which seems to be the right amount. The first 3 or 4 days we fish hard up early and fish until dark. By day 5 we start sleeping in a bit more and still fish until dark. By day 7 I am usually sick of eating, drinking and fishing and its time to leave."
6214034,Guest,2018-06-27 06:22:00,0,"We always fly in for 7 days. The first day is a partial due to the flight, getting everything into the cabin, fridges, setting up rigs and boats. Same with the last day when we tear everything down, clean the cabin and boats and get everything back to the dock for the flight out. I would stay longer if I could. One of the camps we fished had a guy that would stay for 3 to 4 weeks. Different groups would fly in and fish with him, leave and the next group would arrive. I was jealous."
6214084,kona77,2018-06-27 07:49:00,236,Our group is made up of guys who really (I mean really) love to fish.. All of our trips have been for 7 days.. We usually have to drag a couple of the guys off the lakes the last night to get ready for the fly-out the next day.. Longer trips would be nice but we all have work ( dirty 4 letter word ) responsibilities that we have to support.
6214190,labsrus,2018-06-27 10:29:00,557,Have been on several fly in trips Our group likes to fish. We have had good luck with weather and wind so we have not lost a lot of fishing time. We do keep a list of things that worked well and things to leave behind. Always interesting to see what others thought Even after 7 days I am looking forward to the next trip. Maybe some year we will do 2 weeks.
6214280,vteye3,2018-06-27 14:43:00,496,We travel about 19 hours non stop and anything less than a week makes no sense. We fish long & hard and like other responses by mid/late week start relaxing. I would go longer rather than 4 days if possible. We also go every other year.
6214392,DaBirdman,2018-06-27 21:08:00,164,Thanks for the replies! Doing a fly-in on an every other year basis might be in the cards. Week long trips are nice because you can really settle in. 4-day trip would be as short as I'd want to do.
