Pick your poison though, last year most of our fish came casting Shiver Minnows. I might venture over as far as Keg lake but haven't ever went all the way to Red"

6197730,Walleye will,2018-05-21 10:29:00,218,Hey guy just wondering what to expect with in the last week of June on the east side of red lake?We are staying at island adventures retreat June 23.I have heard that slate bay is pretty good and also Martins bay Is decent.Is that true?
6197784,mr.crampster,2018-05-21 12:23:00,18,Hi. Going the same week. Fished the same week last year. The east end should still be good. The river is good. Hoyles Bay and Post Narrows are good areas. Slate bay has some good spots. Depends a lot on the weather. I like fishing shallow. But if it's hot might have to deeper. Good luck.
6199614,Guest,2018-05-24 14:07:00,0,thanks for the reply! Might be able to see you up there. Tight lines.
6207132,twam911,2018-06-10 19:44:00,3,"Been going to Howey Bay for 10 Years I think. Keg lake by the islands, Wolf Bay is always awesome. The narrows as states is good also. The River is always a place to catch lunch and dinner. I have not had much luck in Hoyles, McKinley Isle is good on north side. Good Luck....we always go the same time....June 23 arrival"
