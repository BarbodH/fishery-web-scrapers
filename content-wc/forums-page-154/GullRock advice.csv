Thanks for all the help in my previous thread to help us choose this lodge, it looks great and Ian has been super responsive and helpful when I’ve had questions. I’m wondering if anyone has any advice for this time of year up there? I’m expecting that the walleyes are transitioning to main lake structure, especially with all the warm weather they’ve been having up there. I’m trying to pack my tackle box and try to avoid bringing every piece of equipment I have(the struggle is real), any idea what depths I should plan for when walleye fishing? I think I’ve read every one of Mike Borger’s trip reports a couple times, but it seems he’s often fishing pike earlier in the season, does anyone have advice for finding larger pike this time of year? There are a number of bays with creeks flowing in, my plan as of now is to hit some of those up(paying attention to wind direction), but experiment fishing the entrances or first breaks outside those bays. Do walleye come in shallower on this lake at low light periods? Some of my biggest Canada walleye have come from trolling stickbaits in shallower water just before dusk, but I’d love to be able to vertical jig too. My expectation is that we will be more productive covering water with spinners/lindies/cranks during the day though. My main goal is to show my wife a good time, she hasn’t caught many walleyes or northern in her life, but she loves fishing, so getting some decent action regardless of size will be all gravy for me. We plan on getting conservation licenses and not bringing any fish home, I love how the resort owners on this lake take this seriously, one of the reasons I chose here! Plus I go up to LOTW pretty often so we get to eat walleye throughout the year. Also, Ian has nice depth finders on his boats, is it necessary/worth it to get or borrow a map chip for this lake? I don’t mind spending the money, but not sure if I need it for our first trip(although I’d use it for years to come hopefully). That got really long, I appreciate any help! I have already received a few phone call offers from some really nice folks on here which I plan on taking advantage of, you guys are the best!"
6214208,GWC,2018-06-27 11:21:00,1021,I guess I'm spoiled. I would buy the card/chip. They help a lot. Your camp owners can tell you areas where fish are being caught. Around Three Sisters is normally good as is Fisherman's Point.
6214210,terrapin,2018-06-27 11:44:00,353,"The last time I was there this time of year, we fished mid-lake humps drifting with the wind using Maribou jigs. We nailed them... of course that was in 1985 and I was 12 years old. I super jealous. That is a fantastic lake and it formed an indelible memory, have fun."
6214242,valley366,2018-06-27 13:01:00,193,Fish were starting to show up on the mid lake humps when we left on the 16th. We used jig and minnows for all of our fishing. There were people in camp that trolled with rapalas when we were there and had success. There were people trolling with liny's and minnows when we were there and had success.Ian will show you where they are at. As far as electronics I used the graph on the boat. The boat we had I did not see if it was chip capable. I did not have one so not a concern to me but I think I had a boat that he had not upgraded yet and was on his things to do. I used the Navionics App that I have on my tablet. I use that not really for depths but to see where I am going.This is what I posted when we returned. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=682930
6214318,martinbns,2018-06-27 16:28:00,1520,"There are lots of eater sized walleye in Gullrock and good pike numbers too. We fished there the last week in July two years ago, pretty much jigged 100% of the time for walleye then went into some of the bays for pike but they will probably be getting choked up with weeds. Ian is a great guy, he will show you on the map where to fish, an often ignore spot is in front of the island just down from camp, most guys fished the boot up the other end of the lake."
6214386,tyeegs,2018-06-27 20:59:00,177,"Odd yr this year, hot in Canada three weeks in a row but still caught fish last week. Ian will provide great guidance. If the lake is still warm then trolling like we did (raps or lil joes) will be effective. Morn and especially evening most effective likely. Slip bob's in the weeds were effective last week too. Bring your whole tackle box to Canada then take out only what is aligned with your daily strategy when you fish. But overall, fish prob moving deep so lindy + patience or jigging may be your best bet. Sometimes Ian will guide an evening bite depending on his other commitments. Red Lake is fun. Little shops, Tim Hortons, Ice cream at the movie rental place, all fun but I miss the snake pit. Enjoy!"
6214450,Habitual Eyer,2018-06-28 06:20:00,144,JIG & MINNOW !!!!!!!! Find em...sit on top of em...stay on the bottom .don't move till you run out of fish. Find your magic depth and sniff em out. Most places you stop on G Rock will hold fish. Decent electronics a must. Crawlers/leaches might produce half as much as minnows. Hefty bait bill is a good thing !!! Learned this after fishing Gullrock twice a year for 20 years now.
6214538,valley366,2018-06-28 09:52:00,193,That is what we did. 2 kids (9 and 12) and I went through 23 dozen fresh minnows in a week. That was with me using 2-4 dozen frozen each day. We also had one day that we fished another lake that did not require minnows however we went out after dinner and burned through a bunch.On that note I used the salt/borax method on fatheads that has many threads on here. Found those to be equivalent to the fresh minnows. I caught 7 fish on a salted minnow one night.
6214596,PhilTickelson,2018-06-28 13:06:00,84,"Wow, thanks for all the tips guys! Do you generally wait to fish a spot until you mark fish up there, or are you fishing ‘fishy’ looking areas and drift until you find them? Two days from now I’ll hopefully be passing through vermillion bay!"
6214616,Habitual Eyer,2018-06-28 13:40:00,144,"spot and stalk .I keep checking spots until I mark a bunch..then spotlock on top of them and start picking them off. Occasional shift to stay on fish. I have real good electronics though. I don't drop unless we have good marks. Don't set hook immediately when you realize you got bit. Most times they will only have the back half of the minnow (not up to the hook). Feed them some rod, give them a chance to work up the minnow to the hook.....ever so gently lift back to confirm they are still there..and sweep up with the hook set. 1/4 oz jig is all we use. Med light rod/fast tip. GOSH I LOVE JIGGING ON GULLROCK !!!!!!!"
