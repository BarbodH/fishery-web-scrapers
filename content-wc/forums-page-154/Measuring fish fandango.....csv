I have had to use a dull knife in a brute force, right the through the ribs method many times, especially when I was young and didn't have money to keep a quality fillet knife. I can't imagine ripping pushing yanking that knife through a fish wouldn't cause it to elongate. every vertebrae gets stretched, if not completely ripped apart."

6213756,terrapin,2018-06-26 11:48:00,353,"I machine and design parts everyday with tolerances. A certain portion of that tolerance band has to do with measurement tolerance. Two people measuring the same part, using the same tool will get a different result. Give them different tools and methods and that difference increases. We generally cut the in-house tolerance in half to accommodate that discrepancy. If I had slot limits, I would probably allow for an inch of margin to prevent that potential for a ticket. That being said, that knife cuts both ways. Fighting this ticket in court would be a no brainer. Ask to see the calibration certs for his measuring device."
6213762,x4flatfish,2018-06-26 11:54:00,319,"WOW! really opened up the proverbial can of worms here. Let me add to it. A few years ago we had a great local guide on Lac Seul fishing muskie. We caught a few walleye for shore lunch. His preferred method for killing the fish, (can't have live fish in your possession there) was to break their neck. We have been doing it that way ever since. Never really measured them afterward to see if it made a difference in length. Wonder what the wardens say about this? Obviously their measurement is the one that counts. Was checked there last year and forgot to ask them how we should be killing our fish."
6213848,PRO-V16,2018-06-26 14:50:00,454,We wack them on the head with a small billy.
6213944,Big Louie,2018-06-26 19:49:00,22,"On Lac Seul, I also used to wack them with miniature baseball bat until a friend of mine, who did the same, got a ticket because one of their fish was still ""gilling"" when the MNR officer checked them. Now I snap their necks and I don't keep any that are close to the slot. Also, two years ago on a houseboat on Lac Seul, a very nice MNR officer dug through all the carcasses of our recently cleaned fish and measured all of the fish over roughly 16 inches. All were under the slot so it was fine."
6213982,elway12,2018-06-26 21:15:00,335,"This is a very interesting topic & thread. Though anyone on W.C. for more than a coupe of years knows that we have PLENTY of threads that have to do with these topics of game wardens, fish sizing, catch limits, slot limits etc. I think it is important to look at this measuring issue closer. Let's give the benefit of the doubt to the person who got caught the fish & thus got the ticket. That he was being truthful & honorable that he measured the fish at under 18. What IF after filleting the fish somehow it did ""stretch"" it to be more than what had been measured previously?? He got a ticket for something that he was not trying to get and he was following the regulations. To me that is an important thing to not have happen and if it does/did why. Just telling a person to ""keep only fish not close to the slot"" is, to me, a weak answer. It's like saying ""don't drive so you will never get a ticket or into an accident"". What is catching a fish not close to the slot actually mean...a 1/2 inch, a mm, a cm, an inch, an inch & 1/2 shorter? How many times do people catch fish to keep and they are just more than 17? It happens ALL the time. Of course, I don't keep fish over the slot, am not implying that the slot should be lengthen, or that the warden doesn't have final say(of course you can go to a judge), or that many guys don't pinch the tail & measure incorrectly etc. But it's lawful that if you catch a 17+ fish you can legally keep it. I am interested to find out from others that have said they too are going to try to see if their filleting methods change the measurement. I want to be able keep a fish that is close to the maximum legal length and not have to worrying about getting a questionable ticket."
6213436,v-bay gord,2018-06-25 16:51:00,3168,"There was a thread where the poster claims that they were ticketed for a walleye that measured longer after being filleted. Hypothesis: A walleye carcass will measure longer after the fillets are removed creating potential fish and game violations. Method: I measured a walleye at 18 inches and then measured the same fish after being filleted. Result: The whole fish and fish carcass measure the same...18 inches. Conclusion: If you measure a fish at 18 inches and the game warden measures the same fish at 18.3 inches (in the slot on Eagle Lake and therefor illegal), the game warden is right, and you are wrong."
6213444,MN_Moose,2018-06-25 17:08:00,964,How many people keep and freeze the entire fish along with the fillets? Of course they would have to be frozen in place. This may be your form of tongue in cheek humor. But this is ridiculous. .
6213454,v-bay gord,2018-06-25 17:41:00,3168,"I guess as a WC member I thought everyone read all the posts. Obviously not or you wouldn't have posted this ""tongue in butt cheek"" comment. Should I have to elaborate for the rest of the uninformed. Geez.....go read the post I'm referring to."
6213474,NARDA 1,2018-06-25 18:03:00,636,"Thanks for posting that Gord, I was curious about that! Here's the link to that thread. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=683034"
6213546,castnblast,2018-06-25 21:07:00,111,"Thanks for the clarification...I thought the original post was a little off. Why would a fish measure longer after it's been slabbed. Makes zero sense. With the tail, spine and head in tact on the carcass, the length is what it is."
6213586,MN_Moose,2018-06-26 05:32:00,964,"Ok I understand better now. There is always the debate how can game warden , officer etc measure a fillet and determine 17 7/8 or 18. With the carcass in the story it makes more sense."
6213588,bigwalleye1,2018-06-26 06:15:00,2632,"Gord, it looks like your starting point is a little off and the tail isn't pinched. It was a friend of mine that made the original claim, and I made the post here. I guess I could still see it being different. Consider the backbone is curved while laying on the measuring board with the fillet on it, and lays straighter and flatter when the fillets are off. And being right or wrong means nothing if a ticket is the end result."
6213702,Guest,2018-06-26 10:22:00,0,"Gord, you may want to consider expanding your research before jumping to conclusions. While your typical cleaning method doesn't produce a longer carcass, is it possible that someone else's method does? Maybe try removing the fillets by cutting through the ribs rather than around them. What happens if the knife is somewhat dull? My guess is that it may be possible to stretch the backbone and make the carcass measure longer."
6213712,Ricky Spanish,2018-06-26 10:46:00,1298,"I bet a warden that was having a bad day would call gord's walleye a slot fish. If it's over 17.5"", it is not going in my livewell."
6213722,bigwalleye1,2018-06-26 10:55:00,2632,I would agree.
