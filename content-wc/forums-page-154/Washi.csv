The impression I got from this lake is that it is best fished very early in the season as the west side is very shallow and warms up very quickly. We caught a good number of walleye around the various islands and where the two small rivers entered the west lake. We also fished the Albany one afternoon where it leaves the east lake and found decent number of Walleye there. Overall the size of the pike were much smaller than other lakes I have fished in Ontario. We did catch one 35'' but the majority were very small 16''-24'' range. Two items to note, there is no usable dock at this camp so you will have to beach the boat every time you come in. Secondly we had to use a lot of duct tape to mosquito proof the cabin after being absolutely devoured the first night. The boats ran well and there is a shower and running water in the cabin for washing dishes."
