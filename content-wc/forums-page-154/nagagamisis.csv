6206056,farmnfish,2018-06-08 06:04:00,130,"Catching up on chores so it took me a bit to get back to this thread.Took a couple kids camping at Nagagamisis last week, had a great time. The park campground was very nice. The weather was not great for fishing with a couple kids, cold, windy, wet. So the amount of fishing time we put in was small compared to what I'd have put in on a just adults trip. I myself fished very little, mostly did boat control, rigging lines, baiting and fish removal. Surface water temp when we got there was about 61 when we left about 57, wind churned the water I guess, lake came up about 6 inches while we where there also.Fishing was very good. We trolled shad rap type baits till we found fish then vertical jigged minnows. Fish size was decent. We caught walleye from 12-22 inches with the average being probably 17. I don't count fish but the kids were never bored (cold frequently though). Lots of northern sneaking about to steal your jigs. Fishing pressure was pretty light while we were there, especially during the week. There is some commercial development on the north side of the lake, but we never saw more than a few other boats out. Less pressure than I've experienced on more western ontario lakes. Negatives: There is no dock system for the provincial park campground so you'll be launching your boat everyday. You can pull it up on the shore at your campsite or at the launch, but there is no protection for it from the wind and waves.Positives: Cheap. Campsite for the week was $189US. The drive from Ohio was fabulous compared with going through Fort Francis."

My family and I will be heading there at the end of July this year, our first time in Canada. It is very hard to find information on the lake. I see that there is a lodge on the lake called Pro North Outfitters. Do you remember the colors you where using for the trip? after doing research hardly no place around to go and buy the color you need, I would rather come prepared as best that I can. It is a big lake from what I see, 20,000 acres. I'm sure the it can get pretty rough on windy days. My wife loves to pike fish. I plan on leaving my boat in the water for the week rather then pulling it in and out daily. I guess my main concern is how do you charge your boat if there is no electric at the campsite. just to save my batterys on the boat I was thinking about making a fish cage to keep fish in the water instead of livewell until I""m ready to fillet the fish for eating that day. You can only bring back to States 1 day limit correct and only have 1 dy limit in my possession at all times?. For example: Say I can keep 3 walleye and 2 northern pike. So i can bring back that amount back with me to the states? Thanks for the Help. WheresBilly"
6212400,farmnfish,2018-06-23 07:26:00,130,"Yellow jigs head and silver shad raps seem to attract the greatest interest when I was there but YMMV.Hope beaching your boat works out for you, would make life easier. When we were there the lake level was up and there was not a lot of beach left. Even if the water level was lower a strong north wind really puts the waves up on the campground shore. I'd keep an eye on it.I use a solar panel to keep the batteries charged.Yes, you can bring back your limit of each species.Let me know how you do the time of year you're going there."
6212914,Wheresbilly,2018-06-24 18:14:00,2,"I""m curious on the solar panel, how big of solar panel do you have for the batteries? How many Batteries do you have? Do you have an on-board charger also? I guess how does it work. Do you plug on-charger into the solar panel? I have Lund Pro guide 1725. I got a great deal on 36 volt minn Kota. So I have a total of 4 batteries, Plus I have a 4 bank battery charger too. Even if I can keep the starter battery charged since I everything running off of that. 2 fish finders, lights, motor, bilge and So on.... that is what i'm mostly concerned. I will let you know how we do. Thanks for all your help."
6213124,Bill Krejca,2018-06-25 07:27:00,6107,"From what little I have seen on solar charging for batteries, you'll need a gigantic (read unfeasible) solar array. It is really difficult to safely harbor a boat on a shore which gets pounded by waves. Horrible if shore is rocky. Re: keeping fish in live box - sounds like breaking waves are frequent on the shore line where you'll be. This being the case, fish generally wont survive in such conditions, I've been there on this. Also, I believe you must have owner information on the live box, better check this out if you plan on going ahead with it. Run a rope from shore to the box. Boxes I've used in the past worked better in as deepest water possible. I wouldn't do it again unless forced to. Sorry to seem negative, just trying be informative. Bill"
6213594,farmnfish,2018-06-26 06:24:00,130,"I use a 60 watt panel, in full sun it will do 3 amps. I connect it to a cheap pmw charge controller and alligator clip it to one battery at a time. If you're draining 3 batteries everyday it would not keep up with your needs."
4926609,farmnfish,2016-06-14 11:28:00,130,"kinda looking around for a place to go next year. Going to the Indian chain this year but was looking at camping next year and was checking out various provincial parks with campgrounds. Online and on walleye central I can find reports and opinions on just about every place I'd consider but on nagagamisis just about nothing. It looks like it should be a good place to spend a week, but the lack of intel makes me suspicious. Anyone give recommendations on the lake?"
5239130,farmnfish,2016-12-25 14:06:00,130,"Still nothing, hummm, no one has been there?"
5239234,kzoofisher,2016-12-25 18:13:00,5144,No intel but I'd give it a day or two after the Holiday before you draw any conclusions based on a lack of activity. I'll bet Mike Borger knows the place.
5239410,adempsey2.0,2016-12-25 21:37:00,612,"There's a lot of shoreline development on Nagagamisis Lake near the highway, if that makes a difference."
5239586,farmnfish,2016-12-26 08:22:00,130,"Thanks, that does make a difference."
5241258,Mike Borger,2016-12-27 11:25:00,1554,Thanks for the vote of confidence. Fact is I know very little about it. I know someone in White River who fishes it all the time and he's always raving about the walleye fishing. Take it for it's worth. He also fishes nearby White Lake provincial park and prefers Nagagamisis.
5241482,farmnfish,2016-12-27 14:33:00,130,"Thanks Mike, White Lake was one of the other possibilities, along with Fushimi."
6205138,farmnfish,2018-06-06 06:36:00,130,I've been there now if anyone wants a report.
6205520,Bill Krejca,2018-06-06 14:58:00,6107,OK. Bill
6205552,Ogoki,2018-06-06 16:24:00,291,Was on a bear hunt in Hornepayne and took a ride up there. Drove into some rental cabins and talked to some guys . They were deep trying walleye and said they had fished there for years . Keep coming back for a reason . Must have seen something they liked
