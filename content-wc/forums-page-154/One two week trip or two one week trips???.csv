6211334,Guest,2018-06-20 18:35:00,0,"I think its clear from your replies I was not fishing the right water for a fall trip. Tonyo mentioned grouse hunting and I brought that up to a friend. He has wanted try that for sometime. I have been looking at camps and more than a few mention grouse hunting.I checked one on Lac Seul in Ear Falls and they have openings and a fall discount. We never fished Lac Seul and wonder if we have to travel miles and miles to get to good fishing that time of year. I have read several old reports here of folks grouse hunting and it sounds like you just find an old logging road and go for a walk? I know it never seamed to matter what lake we went to in the spring you always hear them drumming. Anyone have thoughts about that area the third week in September, would I be setting us up for another disappointment, better places for a fall rookie?"
6211356,Tonyo,2018-06-20 19:13:00,212,I don't know a lot about the Lac Seoul area but if you drive a little further up 105 I am familiar with Gullrock and 5 Lakes Lodge and i am fairly certain you will have a great time. I went the 3rd week last year and the fishing was good and we were able to shoot a few birds. I plan to go a little later this year in hopes of a little better numbers on the grouse. I am positive the trip will be a hit no matter where you choose to fish and hunt. Tonyo
6211362,Overwatchmike,2018-06-20 19:27:00,201,Fall grouse hunting in the north is some of the best there is. You are correct on basically walking down an old logging road and hunting that way. If you find a stand of young Aspen they should be there also. I've found that sunny days seemed better but its usually good no matter what.Canadians don't call them fool hens or fool chickens for nothing. They usually ride down the road on their quad and shoot them in the head with a .22.Taking your gun across the border will take some running around and preparation. You used to be able to pay once a year and could take your gun up for a year at no extra cost. Now it is only good for 2 or 3 months. If you decide to go and do the hunting trip send me a pm and I can help you with some of the requirements for taking your gun across the border.Sent from my SM-G955U using Tapatalk
6213532,Guest,2018-06-25 20:00:00,0,For this year we decided not to tackle big water for a first time. Always takes a while to learn a new lake. Ditched the hunting for the first fall trip and find a lake with minimum low water issues in the fall. Fished the area from Nakina to Jellicoe for about 10 years. Always thought about a spring trip to O'Sullivans but they are always booked full. I see the last two weeks of Sept are wide open. Anyone familiar with the area have a thought on that? Been to Lucy fishing splake many times and that is always a blast.
6209134,Guest,2018-06-15 19:33:00,0,Next year I want to spend two weeks in Canada. Question is do I go opening week with some friends and stay for the second week with my boys or do I go the second week of season with my boys and find another group do do a fall trip? Only went once or twice in the fall without much luck but I keep hearing how great the fall fishing is. What do you seasoned veterens do?
6209194,pjshorthorn,2018-06-16 05:13:00,5654,"I would much prefer to take two very different trips than one extended trip to the same location. I've done a spring trip and a fall trip in the same year and they are vastly different in many different ways. I love the changing of colors, cool temps and no bugs that fall trips afford with the chance of catching some big females that are putting on the feed bag. The fishing may be a little deeper so that aspect would have to be figured out with the electronics. One can find some decent trip prices in the fall as Lodges tend to be a little slower in terms of customer volume ,but the window of times to go can also be a little more limited due to when they close their seasons. The other consideration for a fall trip is whether the kids can get away during the fall due to school, activities, etc. Just some random thoughts. Have fun with the planning. PjShorthorn"
6209202,BornToFish,2018-06-16 05:52:00,1224,"Greetings,I have been fortunate over the years to be able to go two times each season, and stay for two weeks each time. Thus, I combined both aspects of the original poster's question. This worked for my wife and me! PJ offered some great advice. I want to come at it from a slightly different perspective. I have learned over the course of many weeks of fishing throughout the fishing season, that the optimal technique to present a lure changes in response to the seasonal movements of the fish. For example, I might be casting shorelines in the early season, then rigging in June and vertical jigging in mid-August.Thus, if the original poster is the type of angler that is locked into one particular presentation of choice, he might want to make one trip each season (when that particular presentation is working well) and stay for two weeks. On the other hand, if the original poster is the type of angler that enjoys various techniques for presenting lures, then go at two different times of the season so as to experience different segments of the seasonal movement of the fish.Either way, go with it as time on the water is a great thing!My absolute favorite time of the season to fish in Ontario is September. There are a fewer boats on the water. The walleyes are stacked on structure. I'm thinking ""game on!"" when I catch one walleye on a rock hump, as I then know where they all are. There are virtually no bugs. The one down side can be the weather - the best of the best and the worst of the worse - all in the same day.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6209204,Overwatchmike,2018-06-16 05:54:00,201,"Being as how your not tied down to just one place I'd opt for the 2 separate trips. Opening week is usually awesome fishing but weather can always play a factor. Fall time has ALWAYS been my favorite time of year up north. End of September, beginning of October is prime big fish time and they're putting on their feed bag. You just need to slow down your presentation. The scenery is amazing.....And the best part...... Hardly any bugs!https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...beb71b796d.jpghttps://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...ef15a6c8fe.jpghttps://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...81943ff49e.jpgSent from my SM-G955U using Tapatalk"
6209266,ElectricSlide19,2018-06-16 08:38:00,147,"While not dealing with the bugs would be awesome in the fall, lets play devil's advocate and go against the 2 1 week trips. Everytime I have gone up to Canada, at least 2 if not 3 days of weather is not ideal, be it a storm, cold front, whatever. I have always said the best trip length to Canada would be 10 days. Take your time getting up there, coming back, and then you have a cushion for bad weather, bug hatch, etc. Not to mention, 2 weeks of fishing in the same area would have you dialed in on the fish when your kids came up. You would be able to put them on fish almost instantly. I can't see fishing one area getting boring, maybe if you were only fishing for one species, but if you get tired of fishing for walleyes then go fishing for pike, or smallies, pannies, or muskies if you fish for them. On the other hand, fall fishing can be great, there are less bugs and less boats. Really you can't go wrong. Have fun and let us know what you decide!"
6209284,fishmanric,2018-06-16 09:20:00,219,"I've been doing two week trips at the same place for years. Mostly because weather has been known to take out one week stays with ease. I've had years where you couldn't even get on the water for three days. The two week trips take all the pressure off. I fish a large body of water and have yet to explore all of its vastness so there is much interest. I don't need to go anywhere else. That being said, two one week trips have much to offer and a chance at taking home more fish."
6209460,drew59,2018-06-16 19:20:00,87,Anticipation and planning is half the fun. Definitely two one week trips!
6209462,pjshorthorn,2018-06-16 19:23:00,5654,I agree with your comments. Very many valid points to consider. PjShorthorn
6209570,Tonyo,2018-06-17 07:40:00,212,"I will offer one more reason for a spring trip and a fall trip. Our group has gone the same week to the same lake for 18 or so years and last year was the first year I took a second trip the 3rd week of September. The fishing was different as mentioned but the fish were a little heavier than our spring trip and definitely stacked up when you found them. The other thing that we were able to do was do some grouse hunting in the morning and evenings. It gave us one more reason to eplore areas outside the lake that I have never taken the time to see. We used a UTV to access logging roads and back country that you couldn't get to with a truck. It was beautiful with all the colors starting and just seeing the remoteness of the area that I have never seen in the past. Most importantly, you go. Either trip will be great. TonyO"
6210020,Bakefish,2018-06-18 10:38:00,1077,"I take two trips per year, one in the spring, one in the fall. If I had to choose I'd pick the fall trip. The fish just seem angry. No bugs, no boats and easy border crossings are also a plus."
