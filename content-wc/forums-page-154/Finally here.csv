The anticipation has been building, and if I could I would spend the whole summer on that compound. What a privilege it is to be able to come up to such beauty and wonderful fishing as well as enjoying the fabulous hosts we have at camp. This year, my wife and I have the honor of taking my 10 year old grandson for his first trip to Canada. We have been tying spinner rigs together and talking techniques for weeks. He was so excited when we told him we were taking him to Canada that he jumped up and down for joy for ten minutes. It seems like all he has been asking us for the last month is when are we going; when are we going? Our nickname for each other is ""Pal"". It has been that way since he could talk. I can't wait to see his face as he brings in the eyes. I will always cherish this trip with my ""Pal"" and my special lady. Tight lines and safe travels to all."
