Fushimi cabin is a boat-in custom log cabin, that was totally renovated by the present owners. It has a loft with 2 beds up, and 2 bedrooms down with a newer propane stove and frig, as well as a well appointed kitchen. It has a quiet Honda 3000 generator, so you can have 24/7 electric in the cabin (I needed it at night for my Bi-pap and one of the other guys used it to charge his boat batteries). Has a very clean outhouse, as well as Sirius radio and a DVD TV player for rainy days (one stormy afternoon we caught up on John Wayne Westerns - ha).This is the only cabin on lake Fishimi, other than a small provincial campground on the opposite side of the lake (where you meet the owners and ramp your boat(s) or get a rental boat from the owners of Fushimi cabins). You have the cabin site completely to yourself on the lake. We were able to get good cell service on the water by the campground and near the north shore of the lake (cabin is on the south shore).4 of us were at Fushimi last week, and took in 2 tiller boats to fish the lake. The cabin dock is very stable and has bumpers for your boats. During the week you have this lake to yourself, other than a handful of boats from the campground (mainly on Sat or Sunday). Saw 2 mama moose, one with 2 young and 1 with just 1 young...unfortunately, they didn't stick around for a photo shoot....no bear sightings, which was just A-OK.Lake's depth averages between 20' - 30' with a lot of shoreline weed beds and reed banks. We bottom-bounced with crawlers early on, though went to perch colored jigs and twistertails. Caught a lot of smaller pike (one came in a 45""), walleyes up to 20"" and perch up to 12"" (thick and healthy).No negatives, other than the black flies and skeeters were biting as much as the fish (ha)....cabin has excellent window screens, and an excellent gas grill on the large front deck. The whole operation is very clean, and well kept. Cabin has a indoor shower with an on-demand hot water heater. Our totals (per my buddy who kept a daily count) for the week at Fushimi Cabins:Sat..0. Just settled in the cabin for the daySun.eyes 44. pike 23 perch 10Mon.eyes 9. Pike 28. Perch 0 got blown off lake in afternoonTue. Eyes 33. Pike. 40. Perch 0Wed. Eyes 6 pike 25.

6214488,farmnfish,2018-06-28 07:48:00,130,Thanks for the report. I've considered going up to Fushimi sometime. What did you think of the campground there? Did it have any docks?
6214820,Rich B,2018-06-28 20:38:00,1081,"It was a very nice campground, though no docks (to tie up boats). I saw 5 or 6 boats up on shore, on a ""track roller system"" that allowed the boats to be winched out of the water. It looked like the few campers that we saw on the lake trailered their boats a short distance over to the ramp and then reloaded them when they returned (would be a pain, but that's what I think most do). However, the campground was very clean, and well run. One of the guys that went up with me met a nurse at a Columbus, Ohio hospital while he was a patient; they got talking about walleye fishing. She said her family camped up on Fushimi for 2 weeks every summer. Rich B"
