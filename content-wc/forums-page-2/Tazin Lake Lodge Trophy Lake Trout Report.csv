6753357,Carnhzkr,2023-07-31 18:30:00,964,"You're thinking of Windy River Camp. That's one of Nueltin's outposts. I stayed there with my dad on our first lake trout trip. The picture was from Windy Lake. Windy River flows from Windy Lake into Nueltin, where the WR camp is. Nueltin used to have a flyout tent camp on Windy Lake. The first year they opened that camp, they let us stay there for the full week. I think it's only used for overnight trips anymore. I don't remember the guy's name, and it was either his wife or GF, that managed the WR camp. That guy and his now wife own and operate a camp on Alymer lake now."
6753359,Eckohlt,2023-07-31 18:42:00,3685,"Ok,I boated up to windy lake a cpl of times when staying at windy river,the lake still had some ice on it,it was loaded with trout,I'll check out Alymer lake if they have a website."
6753373,DeBo,2023-07-31 19:41:00,211,If you look up Northern Scavenger on YouTube they did a series last summer called gateway to the Arctic. Started at Great Slave and paddled up through Aylmer as part of the journey and you can see a bit of the camp in an episode or 2. Summer ice was a big problem for them up that way!
6753389,PRO-V16,2023-07-31 22:01:00,454,Beautiful fish. I love catching and eating walleye but nothing beats lake trout for a fight.
6753975,LittleBait,2023-08-04 10:27:00,37,"Been to Tazin, yes you can troll for extremely large fish, world record and not catch the numbers, but you can also jig or cast/troll for 8-15 lbs all day and get one every cast, more than 5 a minute! Pike fishing is world class also!"
6753981,Eckohlt,2023-08-04 10:39:00,3685,You could really get your money worth on those 8 to 15 pounders then.
6753281,jimwalleye,2023-07-31 11:06:00,30,"Tazin Lake Lodge If you want to catch a trophy lake trout Tazin Lake Lodge is where you want to go, but it can be a long grinding process. On Tazin the trophy trout hole is appropriately named trout rock although it is just a shoreline on the north side of the lake about a half hour run with the 25 horsepower motors that they have. If you are lucky fishing this area you might catch one or two lake trout per day. There are very few lake trout caught in that wide area that are small, most of them are going to be 40 inches or more. I went two days without a bite and then caught two nice trout in a half hour close to quitting time for the day at a little past 5 pm. It seems like the bite for us was early in the morning or late in the afternoon. Those that went out in the evening usually did well. There was an over fifty pounder and 62 pounder caught the last five days that we were there and the week prior they had caught similar fish. The only problem with Tazin is you want to catch a trophy trout and it is hard to pull yourself away from the proven trout rock to catch smaller trout elsewhere. We tried a couple of split days and fished for northern and smaller trout and they were just that small. In contrast when I've been at Lakers Unlimited we normally catch 15-20 fish a day per boat and many of them are teen fish and a few over twenty pounds with an occasional 30 pound fish. For numbers of bigger fish Lakers Unlimited gets the nod, but for a real potential world record fish and lake trout over 40 icnhes you will want to fish Tazin Lake. The food was good but they no longer have a chef like was advertised at least not when we were there. We always did sandwiches so that we did not waste time with shore lunch. The one complaint I would have about Tazin Lake Lodge is the flexibility of being able to fish different hours and times without an additional cost. The lodge charges $100 per hour for fishing after dinner. The guide keeps half of that money and the lodge keeps the other half. I would not mind paying the guide $50 per hour if he was agreeable to say splitting the day up and fishing some in the evening but I don't think the lodge needs more money to let me go fishing in the evening, it should be between the guide and myself, that's just my opinion. Perhaps you can convince Barry, one of the owners to work something out with you if you choose to fish Tazin. We did not catch anything substantial fishing for numbers of fish. I did catch one 35-inch lake trout jigging for them, but all the big trout over 40 inches were caught trolling T-60 flatfish, burbot lures, etc. They did not have heat in the cabins although they did have firewood ready if you wanted to light the stove. They are supposed to be installing propane heaters in the cabins this fall which would be a welcome change since it is a hassle to start a fire to keep warm. There must be other spots on the lake that would produce big lake trout without everyone consistently trolling the trout rock area. It is a shame that they don't spend a lot of time trying to find alternate spots on this big lake that can produce trophy fish. They do have other spots to fish obviously but this is where they always go to find that trophy laker. I would recommend Tazin if you are after that trophy lake trout. I have fished Kasba and Lakers multiple times each and Tazin definitely has the biggest trout but to catch one you really have to grind. For more action on big trout but maybe not 40 plus pound trout like Tazin my go to place would be Lakers Unlimited. If you want a trophy or a potential world record Tazin is the place to go. There is a lot to learn about Tazin yet, I would imagine the fishing there is only going to get better as more lake knowledge is acquired. The new owners just took over in 2018 I believe it was. I'd recommend getting ahold of Barry Prall, the owner if you have any questions about Tazin he will be good getting back with you. If you have not checked out Tazin TV on youtube do yourself a favor and check it out and drool. I think it would be a blast fishing Tazin in the fall when the lakers are on the surface or early in the season before the trout go deep. I caught 6 lake trout over 40 inches for the ten days we fished Tazin here are a few pictures for you."
6753301,combine_billy,2023-07-31 13:55:00,151,Nice Fish!
6753303,Eckohlt,2023-07-31 14:05:00,3685,"Those are some real tackle busters,but for the money I'd like to have my rod bending every 5 minutes.But those are some great pictures for sure."
6753305,Wallychowder,2023-07-31 14:10:00,1567,Yeah you could probably stay a month at one of your fly ins for what they want a week !
6753307,Wallychowder,2023-07-31 14:11:00,1567,And you cant even eat them HOG lake trout !
6753315,Old Timer,2023-07-31 14:56:00,255,"I can't speak for Tazin haven't been there. But 35 years ago I chased around the high Arctic looking for the best char and lake trout lakes I could find. For trout, no lake was better than Dubwant. I made several trips and on each caught many 30-40 pounders. Back then we went by weight, not inches. I figure we caught 20-25 fish/person/day with most being between ten and twenty pounds. Maybe three or four each day over 30 pounds. It was all flat-line trolling and casting with big spoons. There were grayling in the rivers, but no pike. It was a primitive tent camp that took three days from home to reach. We were cancelled out on two years because the ice never left the lake. At best, it's a six-seven week season. For years I've planned to return to Dubwant, but haven't made it. Life and time commitments got in the way. I've been fortunate to fish many locations and would put Dubwant at the top of the list."
6753317,jambi,2023-07-31 14:59:00,504,Wow those are some beautiful beasts. Thanks for sharing the details of the fishing here.
6753327,Eckohlt,2023-07-31 15:47:00,3685,"I made it to nueltin lake and had Dubwant in my sights and researched it many years ago,it never happened,hard to find guys that want to spend that kind of cash."
6753347,Carnhzkr,2023-07-31 17:37:00,964,"I never made it to Dubwant or Tazin, but have been to Nueltin, Windy Lake (a tent camp run by Nueltin), Selwyn, and Yathkyed. This was my biggest, taken from Windy Lake. Those were some amazing trips. You think your walleye fly-in is remote? Wait until you look 360 degrees from the top of an esker and all you see is rolling hills of tundra."
6753355,Eckohlt,2023-07-31 18:17:00,3685,"That's where I fished,not only big lakers the graylings were trophy size,was Ron last n his GF the camp managers when you were there??"
