It has been many years since i have fished early august. I am a late sept guy. Any tips or differences between the times for fishing is always appreciated. I know Ian will be dialed in on the fish as always. thanks to all....i do hope you all have enjoyed your canada trips so far. Safe travel and trips to all.

He stays at Wrights camp.He said the fishing has been pretty good, they jig with minnows and pull minnow harnesses. His last trip the spinner harness was out fishing jigs, I will see what he says on depth."
