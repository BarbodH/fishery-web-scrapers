6753129,elway12,2023-07-30 10:30:00,335,"Miniss Lake Trip report from July 15-21st. We stayed at the Miniss West camp owned & operated by Slate Falls Outposts. It was our group's 2nd time using S.F.O. and 1st time staying at their Miniss West outpost camp. Both were outstanding. Ryan at S.F.O. runs a great operation. All facilities and equipment were in great shape. The boats even had the new mesh type seats, the ones that dry easily and are way more comfortable than the traditional padded ones. We had 3 boats with 5 people fishing. The fishing was great. We did have to hunt for them on certain days - they seemed somewhat scattered but still caught high numbers overall with some bigger fish mixed in. All of the group caught at least one pike over 30in. and all of us caught numerous 20+ in. walleyes. The biggest pike being 39in. and the biggest walleye being 25in. Mostly of the walleyes caught were in the 16-20 inch range. We caught our fish anywhere from 3-20 feet of water. Bright colors (orange, pink, silver ) seemed to work the best. We all used plastics and one group used a few frozen minnows. The frozen minnows worked a bit better but not a huge difference in catch rate. We mostly used jigs and also had success trolling cranks and spoons. Weather was good. We got a bit of rain for a few days on and off but that didn't affect the fishing. We did not have any smoke issues from the forest fires. Believe it or not the mosquitoes were almost non-existent except the last day when temperatures went over 70 F. However, the biting flies were bad on numerous days in the boat. Anyone have any proven methods to keep them away?? One person in our group saw a moose and her calf in a bay and all of us saw a Caribou in another bay one morning. We did have some mice in the cabin at times but dispatched 4 of them with traps. It was a great trip and we are planning on doing it again next year. I can't recommend the Canada Topo app. on a cell phone enough. It works flawlessly and is an easy way to navigate on a lake. A learning moment happened was when I tried jig fishing without some sort of a floro leader versus everyone else in my group having one and got out-fished 4 to 1!"

6753413,gordy28,2023-08-01 07:06:00,437,Thanks for the report. Glad it was a good trip. We loved our week at Miniss West and Ryan and SFO are a great outfitter
6753671,DaBirdman,2023-08-02 16:55:00,164,Bugg Spray.....Buggins Isect Repellent. We bring 3 of these bottles on our Canada trips each year. Spray from the knees on down and you're good for hours of bug bite free fishing so that you can focus on the bites that really matter.
