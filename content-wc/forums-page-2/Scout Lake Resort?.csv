We are usually a pretty disorganized group in terms of nailing down our dates but we liked it well enough to book again before we left last year. The cabin we stayed in was very clean. The cabin slept ten which was really nice for our group of six. Two bathrooms was a bonus. Dock system was one of the nicer we've experienced in Canada and they had a brand new cleaning shack last year. The road in was in a little bit of rough shape last year. It wouldn't have been too bad except it rained on our days in and out. According to their Facebook page they smoothed out their road this spring so it will be interesting to see how it holds up by the time we get up there. Wifi is available if you are close to the lodge, otherwise we did not get any cell service at camp. Even when we stayed at Whitewing we would end up fishing quite a few days in the McKenzie area so Scout is a little closer for that run. Overall we enjoyed the location and the accommodations."

6752445,a_hershy,2023-07-26 17:19:00,36,My first time on Lac Seul was from Scout Lake Resort under Lizzie. Beautiful area and a fun run out to the big waters. Hope the new owner keeps it going and steadily makes the updates.Spent last several trips at Onaway. Going to miss Kathy & Blair - hope to get randomly lucky and run into them this week. Anyone been there with the new owners this year? Seem like a great couple and wanting to keep what Kathy & Blair did going...

We are leaving mid August for a 6-7 week camping trip out west, so no Onaway this year. Jealous of your two weeks! Hope to see you next year. Good luck!"

My boy's picture is on the front page of their website holding a pike we caught literally on our last cast of our trip. He is in the yellow box right above ""Amazing Walleye & Northern Pike Fishing"" We took some longer runs to get to spots. Maybe 7 to 10 miles. I don't know if we needed to go that far. There probably was some really good fishing closer to camp. I hope to get back up there sometime soon."
