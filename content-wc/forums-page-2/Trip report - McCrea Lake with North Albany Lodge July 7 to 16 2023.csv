6751037,phishfearme,2023-07-19 08:47:00,1242,"For about 30 years we've been doing fly-ins to outpost cabins. However, the last 5 trips or so have been fraught with pontoon plane issues ranging from fog to smoke to flight backups due to bad weather to airplane mechanical issue  one trip found us stuck for two days due to persistent dense fog. So, for this year we (fellow Charter member LarryS, his sister Pat and my partner Gary) thought we'd try a portage-in type lake - a large lake with only one cabin and a good walleye/pike reputation. Lots of research led us to McCrea Lake with North Albany Lodge about an hour drive south of Pickle Lake just off of 599. Hopefully, with no pontoon flights, there would be minimal risk of getting stuck so that we'd miss our commercial flights. The boat trip from the Lodge to the bottom of the portage is about 80 minutes and from the top of the portage to the cabin was another 40 minutes  each through numerous boulder minefields and complicated turns. Luckily, the outfitter provided guiding service for us  and also weight lifting service to 1- remove the motors from the bottom boats (20hp Yamahas), 2- carry them up the 200 yard portage (on a cart) and 3- install them on the upper boats  something that us old timers can't and shouldn't do. This process had to be repeated at the end of the trip as they require that the motors and gas be installed and removed before and after each group  this was worth the $500US he charged. (Most groups actually haul their own boats/motors/gas up and down the portage  UGH! There were groups of 9 and 11 the weeks before us  so they had to haul maybe three boats up and down the portage  double Ugh!) Thanks to the outfitter, the trips from the Lodge to the cabin were smooth and uneventful  but I just can't imagine hauling boats up the portage. We talked to outfitter into letting us leave the unused gas up at the cabin for the next group, but he still had to haul the motors down. Facilities  the cabin is large with 5 beds and well equipped. Refrigeration and lighting is not via propane or solar but via an electric generator. Noisy! Not something I personally like. We shut it off at night for sleeping and the food stayed cold and frozen. I uploaded a video to YouTube which you can see at:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTQUZPpDLDo Boats were fine with nice captain's seats that needed to be re-bolted as the attachment bolts vibrated out. One boat had a very minor leak but was un-noticeable due to the daily rainstorms. Motors (20hp 4-stroke) were new and ran well and were actually overpowered for the boats  we rarely ran at full throttle, not just because of this but also to pay attention to the numerous boulder minefields. They were however difficult to start  we both have sore shoulders. The outfitter gave us starting guidance and the motors seemed to start well for him but not us. Quite a pain. The walleye fishing  We were quite disappointed. Everyone I talked with about this lake raved about the fishing but we just couldn't make contact with many walleye. I like to think we're fairly experienced and tried many different techniques and depths but with the exception of a flow area they call The Barrel (or The Rock) the fish were scattered and small and un-cooperative. The Barrel produced consistent action with nice sized fish but only for maybe an hour then it was dead. The size distribution was interesting  we estimated that 65% were between 13 and 15 inches, 10% were between 15 and 18 and 25% were 19 to 23. So, we did get some nice walleye but they were a challenge. The sweet spot for depth was 4-6 feet along rocky shores with deeper water just off a ways. Fishing in anything over 10 ft produced near nothing. I would say the 4 of us caught maybe 250 walleye. The Pike fishing  given that we were challenged catching walleye we focused there and never targeted pike  but we still caught quite a few including one 37/38 incher and maybe 25 in the low 30's. We were actually pretty pleased with the availability of pike and I would think that a group focusing on pike could do VERY well. We caught maybe 150 pike - only while fishing for walleye. Parting notes: - The Canada Topo app that works off GPS satellites and does not need WiFi or Cell, was simply terrific. It will always tell you where you are on the lake, and you can leave trails and waypoints that make travel MUCH safer. - The family that has owned the Lodge and facilities for over 30 years has sold the business  new owners next season. - Adding a solar powered water pump to the cabin's sink would be a MAJOR improvement. - Price for the trip was reasonable: cabin was $70US per day per person and 2boats/2motors were $140 per day. The guiding/weightlifting service as additional. That's about it  all in all this was not one of our better trips and the weather sucked (45degF with wind and rain for the first two days and two storms came through Thursday that shook the cabin. We'll be flying next year and plan to build-in more time margin at the end of the trip."
6751043,Eckohlt,2023-07-19 09:05:00,3685,"Thanks phish,nice detail report,one just never knows what to expect until you try it for yourself."
6751051,prov1800,2023-07-19 09:44:00,5010,Great report.Sounds like a grind.
6751129,SweetD,2023-07-19 19:58:00,243,"Phish, sounds like a tough go. Thanks for the honest detailed report. Costs seems reasonable but not at the cost of good/great fishing you can get elsewhere. Maybe weather…..who knows but certainly wouldn’t be on my bucket list now. Time off and away from the daily grind is too precious and we are really going to focus on extremely solid outfitters with really good equipment and facilities along with optimum fishing opportunities. We still try to keep costs down but if it costs $250-$500 to step up to that next level for a 7 day trip we are just going to go with it!!!! Only get so many chances in a lifetime to make these trips North so spending a little extra IMO is well worth it!!! I told my group this year if we can’t afford the little extra probably shouldn’t be making these trips in the first place!"
6751149,Rufous Potoo,2023-07-19 21:44:00,101,"Uffda, that was a long week. Sorry about that."
6751157,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-07-20 00:15:00,358,Six walleye a day is pretty slow action. Thank you for the report
6751185,Larry S,2023-07-20 07:11:00,665,"Thanks for the detailed report Bob. My sister & I were on this Mediocre Trip. What Bob said was the truth,I have to add my 2 cents. You can't do anything about the weather and we tried to make the best of it, but when the motor you are using is acting up( Kept getting harder & harder to start, last day took me 62 pulls to start it or sister & I would have been marooned on lake). You are Very hesitant to motor any distance Fishing was Very hard, fish holding in very shallow ,rocky water. Tried trolling and drifting in heavy winds, but only straight up & down jigging in shallow, rocky water worked Looking at the several journals in the cabin it was apparent that this outpost has been used for many(Earliest post from 2002)years fishing. The group before us had 11 fishermen, so this Pristine lake was Far from what we thought it would be. It was Our fault to believe this was what this lake was. I felt Bad for Bob & Gary because this is their only Canada Trip this year. My sister & I had been on a Very successful first trip in early June catching over 800 fish and have another trip coming up in late August so it didn't have as much of an effect on us. Hopefully we can get a week at our former lake next year, North Caribou which is the Best lake we have ever fished. Larry Schroeder"

6752683,Eckohlt,2023-07-27 16:01:00,3685,Thanks for that link.Looks like the hog walleyes are not safe from the deep fryer!
6752727,Rufous Potoo,2023-07-27 19:52:00,101,"He said hogs, exactly how big are some of those walleyes there? They do look like hogs but with a picture you never know for sure"
6751301,Eckohlt,2023-07-20 16:52:00,3685,"Sometimes they have a mind of there own and stop running on there own,then the battle can begin,or you get lucky and one pull there running."
6752333,gordy28,2023-07-26 10:54:00,437,Thanks for sharing Phish! It’s too bad that it wasn’t the trip that you hoped for but appreciate the honest review As a main researcher for my group reports are gold!Andrew
6752375,Larry S,2023-07-26 12:37:00,665,"Gordy Always appreciate the Honest Reports from you. This trip was Very Mediocre, part of it was weather ,but the equipment(Motors) were a pain in my shoulder due to having to pull the starting cord so many times. Fishing was Very slow . I'm heading on another trip Aug 21-28 with my sister on fly-in out of Clarks Outposts. Will post a review upon getting back Larry Schroeder"
6752507,Bigtaproot,2023-07-27 04:44:00,900,Many thanks for the detailed report. It is my hope that you have better luck next year but the memories sound great regardless of the number of fish. Could someone please post a link to the Canada app mentioned in the article that uses GPS or location assistance
6752567,Freytown,2023-07-27 08:18:00,770,https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/topo-m...da/id392857820Kudos to phishfearme Enjoy!!! FT
6752569,phishfearme,2023-07-27 08:24:00,1242,"it's called Topo Maps Canada - free at the app store. you can download every topo map that covers your lake then when you're there it will show your exact location on the topo. you can also set waypoints and do tracks and give them names. we were confused at first about the color coding, but this allows you to set colors for each track or waypoint. and excellent tool for large wilderness lake - only uses GPS satellites - no need for wi-fi or cell. phish"
6752573,phishfearme,2023-07-27 08:28:00,1242,thanks Joe - how was your Gouin trip? phish
6752583,Freytown,2023-07-27 09:16:00,770,Cancelled due to wildfires. I did go to Lake Erie & had a great catch.
6752587,Freytown,2023-07-27 09:18:00,770,Six fish daily limit twice.
6752601,Eckohlt,2023-07-27 09:44:00,3685,What's the cost of the charter??im not going to ask you if you saw any moose or bears.
6751191,RichA$1970,2023-07-20 07:50:00,1158,"Great report and thanks for your honest point as I read so many that fish are biting on bare hooks and jumping in the boats with clickers going off non-stop. Still worth a gamble and who knows, maybe the next week or the other point they were biting. For many of us it’s not fair to say a lake is bad after a week of fishing but then again, some of us only have a week or two to give it a try. Looking forward to my mid Sept trip wherever it will be-tbd."
6751283,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-07-20 15:20:00,358,I have had hard starting outboard motors on fly-ins. I just let it run and don't shut it off. It doesn't seem to affect the fishing.
