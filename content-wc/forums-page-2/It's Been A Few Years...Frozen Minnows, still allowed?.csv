Sure we can pick it up across the border, but I remember a few years back having fantastic luck with frozen shiners I brought from back home. The place I went the past couple of years included live bait every day, so I haven't brought any across, but was considering it again if it is still legal. Looking online I'm seeing different sites saying that it's still legal, and others saying it's not. Any help you can provide is greatly appreciated!!"

They added Baitfish Management Zones which restricts transport of live and dead baitfish within the province.https://www.ontario.ca/document/onta...s-summary/bait I am not sure about other provinces though. So, if you are going to MB or SK it may be different."

6753643,Old Timer,2023-08-02 13:16:00,255,I'm with CI_Guy. You'll be SOL getting any bait into Manitoba. I had first-hand experience last fall. Can't speak for Saskatchewan.
