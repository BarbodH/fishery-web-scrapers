6753653,Camoclad,2023-08-02 14:13:00,628,I like the last week of May or Mid September. No bugs and hungry fish. There can be some weather swings but we haven't been rain/winded out too many days over the years.
6753713,Spurgery,2023-08-02 21:06:00,79,"I have been various different times of the season. I would probably pick 2nd week of June and 3rd week of August as my favorite times to go. Went in May a couple times. Once the weather was perfect, the other time it was too cold, windy, and rainy to enjoy the trip. In September ran the AC in cabin one night and later in the week scraped ice off vehicle windshields."
6753721,SweetD,2023-08-02 21:29:00,243,End of May and early to mid Sep. For all the reasons previously mentioned!
6753731,kettyspanky,2023-08-03 03:19:00,271,We do the last week of July.
6753735,btyreprich,2023-08-03 03:45:00,1067,August - just before the kids went back to school. Fish were easy to locate on reefs / no dealing with cold weather / not quite as crowded as season opening.
6753605,GeoFish,2023-08-02 08:44:00,70,"I have gone to Canada fishing from ice out to middle of August. We have settled on August because with a group of 2, it is easier to find a outfitter to schedule with.What is your favorite week and why?"
6753607,Eckohlt,2023-08-02 08:48:00,3685,"End of sept or first half of Oct,quite quite quite,there's something about fishing when the leaves around the lake are at there best."
6753611,Mojo-NC,2023-08-02 09:15:00,1929,"Our group prefers early June or early-to-mid September. Both times offer excellent fishing with the fish in June being shallow and September being deep. Lotsa fish both times of the year. We've probably caught slightly larger fish in the spring, as all of our 30"" walleyes have come then and more of our 40+"" pike have been caught then. Very few problems with bugs either of those times. As Eckohit pointed out, it is very quiet in September, the crowds are gone, and crossing the border is a breeze."
6753619,jambi,2023-08-02 10:19:00,504,First two weeks of June. Bugs aren't bad yet. No mayflies. Pike and walleye generally shallow. Cooler weather (except this year).
6753621,adempsey2.0,2023-08-02 10:21:00,611,Couldn't agree more!
6753625,RichA$1970,2023-08-02 10:50:00,1158,"Mid September as not much traffic, leaves are turning, little bugs & something about a wood burning stove feeling the heat. Also some resorts give a discount & itâ€™s primarily people who want to fish. 38 more days for me."
6753627,stjoeguy,2023-08-02 11:22:00,979,"38 days for me, also, to Hooker Lake with Slate Falls Outposts. I try to do trips in June and in the fall. Fall can be nice with cooler weather and changing leaves, but early June is still my favorite. I love pitching jigs into shallow water."
6753629,Walleye2242,2023-08-02 11:35:00,263,"middle to late sept or early oct. In that 3 week stretch is the best for me. cool, crisp weather. no bugs. traffic is pretty much gone. fall colors coming in. fishing is amazing. only a few people in camp maybe. have dealt with weather where i was in short sleeves in early oct. or have scraped ice off the seats and carharrt gear."
6753645,Bakefish,2023-08-02 13:16:00,1077,"I couldn't make a spring trip this year because of numerous graduations, so I'm going for two weeks starting Sept. 16th. It's only fair, right. I love going in the fall...always have. There's a chance of really crappy weather, but it's only happened a couple times. Nothing that kept me off the water though. I have been the only boat on the water on a 25 mile series of lakes. Chances are a fly in won't get you that. Also, I own the fish house."
6753651,jambi,2023-08-02 13:56:00,504,The only year I setup a 3rd week of September trip the forecast and eventual weather sucked. We skipped the far north flyout and went to Obabikon. Cold as heck there too but we had fun. Maybe I'll look to a last minute late September trip next year.
