You can then take the test in your vehicle in the parking lot as long as you have internet access to do a video chat with a nurse who monitors you threw the process, instructions and website address are supplied in the test kit. Instructions are also provided in the kit how to locate a local drop box or to arrange a pickup by Purolator depending on your location."

We always buy from Four Seasons Sports Shop at Ear Falls by the dozen. This time of year it is a good idea to call ahead and reserve your order in August for a September trip. Also, starting next year, we will buy most of our groceries local to save on space and only buy what we need. Huge advantage being close to Ear Falls."

6596328,Old Timer,2021-09-11 15:16:00,251,"Eight of us crossed over at Rainy River on August 13th, four days after it opened. There were four adults with four children under the age of twelve. We had all of our papers in order, including the 72-hour molecular tests. Unknown to us at that time and not addressed in any of the border-crossing protocols that we had reviewed, all children under twelve must be retested at the border. Luckily, my daughters are handy with their cell phones and handled the zoom-testing procedure. And, once our cue came up, they demanded that all four children be tested in the same zoom call. Nevertheless, it costed us an extra 2.5 hours including the drop off. If I had known of the kid-testing procedure beforehand we probably would have skipped the trip."

I think its a Canadian border policy implemented to reduce the load on the border agents with the additional Covid requirements they need to verify.
6596354,Baseline,2021-09-11 18:10:00,3204,The first issue CRAWLERS - That is on your group for not knowing the rules. I found out by looking the MNR website last spring. The second issue COVID TESTS - Part of the drill if you are selected. The third issue - HARD EARNED MONEY - There are lots of places to take a fishing vacation. Try Alaska next time.

6596674,Obabikon,2021-09-13 11:36:00,2368,"They will be changing the live bait rules. The excuse that I was given, basically said that it was too short of notice to implement during Covid. Border officers would already have more than enough on their plate. The reality is, there are people who do not follow the rules and have created issues for everyone else. It is sad, but it is true.That said, I think the main reason for not allowing bait across the border this year, was to help the bait shops and small businesses that have lost out on the last 18 months. It is simply encouraging people to spend a few more dollars in Canada. I am sorry if this is ever an inconvenience for people. But I am just happy they are allowing people to come. If this is such a big deal that it makes you not want to travel to Canada, that is sad. I wish it wasnt that big of a deal, but I understand. At the same time, Know that the resorts and campgrounds are not the ones making these decisions. We are simply excited at the opportunity to try to save our businesses. Nightcrawlers are available on the Canadian side of almost every port of entry. If you cross at Rainy River, there are several places that you can purchase a half flat of nightcrawlers for in the range of $60 Canadian."

I'm lucky that I have a little bit of discretionary income to spare, and I don't lose sight of the fact that not everyone can say that. I find that I am shopping more brick and mortar shops than usual, and paying a little more to try and help keep the local places open. Probably not a wise financial decision on my part, but then again I've never gotten good fishing tips from anyone at Amazon."

Pull up to the window, and wait for the guard to ask for passports. Only hand them what he/she asked for and only answer the questions he/she asks. The live bait is certainly an issue, but when crossing an international border you should probably try to double check on rules. This has been discussed many times in many different forms.

Also this ain't my first rodeo, we followed all the rules and jumped through all the hoops asked of us and did not deserve to be treated that way!

Got turned away as lab that did my covid test errantly put ""collection date"" as 8-24 instead of Wed 8-25 when I actually took test. By Friday night the 27th I was expired by 8 hrs. I looked at test closely but the collection date was small print and I missed it. They were not mean BUT would not let us cross. Worst feeling in the world. Who will I contact on a Friday night to get doc straightened out? Where will I stay as IF was booked tight. Not on the Canadians...it was on me. Luckily I had the cell# of the guy who helped run the lab. He answered on a Friday night, had his computer with him, able to tap into labs data base and fix my test. I took corrected pdf on phone of test and we finally crossed with not a car in front of us.. Coming back I think I could have slowly rolled through border without stopping. 10:30 on a Saturday. no one in front of me...3 questions and ""have a good day, drive safe"". Had I caught the incorrect info on my covid test...crossings both ways would have been easy and very much worth it as we PLOWED through fish everywhere we stopped on Gullrock, had decent weather, Killer cabin at Wrights, and scenery that is unmatched in central North America."

We knew about the bait issue and had none. Wait time at Fort Frances at 4:00pm was about 30 minutes. They had four gates open and the line started about half way across the bridge. He requested ID's (passports) and Vaccine Cards. He did not request to see our ArriveCAN receipts or Covid test results. Crossed back home at International Falls on 9/10. Once again about 5 minutes and no unexpected problems or questions. There really was no wait time in International Falls at 11:00am. I had just one car ahead of me and one open gate.

Going into Canada we crossed at 5:00AM Friday Morning. We were the only car at the border. The Agent was extremely friendly and asked the standard questions. She looked at our passports our Negative Covid tests and my Vaccination card. She then did tell us that since my son is only 9 and not vaccinated that it was mandatory for him to do a Covid Test. We pulled out of the parking lot and parked on the street. I immediately opened the Covid test box and followed the directions. We created an online account and then followed the directions to take the test via video chat with a nurse. The Nurse was friendly and walked us through the process and watched as my son swabbed his nose. I held the tablet for him. Once completed we sealed up the test in the provided Purolator envelope and dropped it in the Purolator drop box about 5 blocks away in the Taxi company parking lot. I admit we lost close to an hour in Fort Francis but I can't complain its their rules their country, I was just happy to be fishing with my son in Canada again. Its a past time that is 4 generations deep. On the way home, we crossed yesterday at 7:30AM and again only car at the border. The agent scanned our passports asked if we were bringing anything back and handed back our passports and said have a safe drive home. I would estimate that we were there 20 seconds."
