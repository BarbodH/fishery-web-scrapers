Walleye bite was on 27'' was big fish! Muskie were a little slow (but I don't care! they just steal my walleye) big fish was 36''. Water temps were 64-62 throughout the week. Stayed at Sunset Country Adventures, Steve and Erin are awesome hosts and we had a great week! Border crossing was a breeze both ways. Only one problem was one of our guys in another car used a fake pay Arrivecan website and was initially turned away. He got squared away after about an hour! Awesome trip and look forward to next year!"

6599906,Bigfish10702,2021-09-28 04:58:00,60,This was my 15th trip to the chain. Lots of different fishing there. Boulder and Little Blulder continue to baffle me.

Haven't really caught any walleye there though. Never given it much of a chance though. I'm not sure if the locals have much knowledge on walleyes there either with the camps being far from them and the other lakes having plenty of walleye to catch."
