6753493,fishdad50,2023-08-01 14:10:00,9,"Just reteurned from 2 weeks in nw Ontario. Check out the Largo shad in perch color. it was killer along with perch colored keitech paddle tails and glow curly tail grubs. 1/8 oz jig. pop through cabbage, coontail and grass. There are always good fish in the weeds. especially if there is deepwater access"
6753497,proguidedream,2023-08-01 14:21:00,345,"slip bobber can work well , i believe there is no other bite with walleye then when they are darting around weed beds in 8 feet of water or less. when they hammer paddle tails casted into the weeds cast after cast after cast. or anything you throw in there. might be the best fresh water bite that exists. in the heat of summer , if you know there is weed beds around and you arent catching them on the reefs or lake humps. you need to give the weeds a go."
6753499,eyemike,2023-08-01 14:27:00,233,"1/8th oz. Roadrunner with a paddletail or twister and snap it through the cabbage. Usually there is thinning and openings to snap through. Sometimes when you think you're caught in some weeds, you snap the jig to a walleye. Other times they hit the jig like gangbusters."
6753833,papadave,2023-08-03 14:53:00,151,"In August, if there are large weedy flats with no deep water for the walleye to retreat to, I'll just slowly cruise with my outboard all through the flats for as long as it takes to find where there are open pockets that are loaded up with walleye. Be patient, it can take an hour or more but nearly always pays off. Somewhere on those flats (usually where the open pockets are closest to a weed edge) there are almost always massive schools of walleye stacked up in the open pockets. They can be hard to spot on your depthfinder because they look similar to the weeds but once you learn to spot them you will be amazed. You can catch them one after another for hours right under your boat in 10 ft. of water or less. I feel like they are trapped there by the hot sun and bright light conditions and have nowhere in deep water to run to so they hang in the only place with some protection available."
6753899,Bill Krejca,2023-08-04 06:16:00,6107,"Re: light conditions - Fish generally tend to hide in any available shadows, especially walleyes and crappies, as they are able to see better in reduced light than their normal prey. Contrary to past beliefs, light does not have an adverse effect on their eyes, but they seek better ambush spots which are to their advantage. Although shadows (from weed growth) may not show up on the water surface, the weeds do create applicable shadows down deeper. Bill"
6752837,wallguy1992,2023-07-28 09:00:00,19,What’s everyone favourite tactic for catching walleye in the weeds? I’ve always done the usual pull plastics or minnows alongside weed edges and occasionally casted into patchy weeds. Wondering what everyone else likes to do and what they find most effective?
6752847,adempsey2.0,2023-07-28 09:27:00,611,"Usually fish the edges because it is usually just easier. However, punching into the weeds with hair jigs or walleye killer rigs (basically a worm harness with an egg or bullet weight at the top) is popular at some of the very weedy mesotrophic lakes near me. Usually a more bass type of rod/reel combo is used for this."
6752871,dhottle,2023-07-28 11:35:00,163,Slow worked jerk baits on the edges & pockets also over the top if you have the water depth over the weed tops.
6752917,Franco,2023-07-28 19:05:00,107,"Weedless spoons and mepps, but I quickly get tired of pulling the weeds off the Mepps treble hooks after every cast."
6752941,Bill Krejca,2023-07-29 07:22:00,6107,"Re: Mepps - I remove the hair treble and replace it with a home tied feathered/hair single hook. This does 2 things, imho, for one, it reduces chances of becoming snagged/weed laden; and also, gives the fish a chance to see something entirely different than they normally get accustomed to seeing. Having used the above for longer than probably most of the viewers on WC, I have not experienced any degradation in hooking percentage. Bill"
6753001,Franco,2023-07-29 11:56:00,107,Good call…I’ll try that!
6753049,prov1800,2023-07-29 17:20:00,5010,We ran smaller spinner baits for pike in the weed beds this week on Eagle and picked out a bunch of walleyes.Have always had good luck with them.no bait required.
6753059,kswalleyer,2023-07-29 18:00:00,1651,depends on time of year and how much water is over top of weeds. I tie a scaled down spinner and put a split shot or 2 ahead of it a few feet and just pull it 20-30' behind the boat(in wind). like the little joe spinners I used as a kid only a bit bigger.
6753109,Bakefish,2023-07-30 08:57:00,1077,"I like to throw swimbaits through cabbage. 1/2 to 3/4 weight. Snag a weed, give it a good rip and the weed should come off."
6753163,Cutting Edge Official,2023-07-30 14:39:00,242,"I do the same, although I use a light bullet weight instead of the split shot."
