6751915,valley366,2023-07-23 20:53:00,193,If you are looking for Smallmouth action Flat Lake by Madsen holds them. It is a small lake. Also holds Walleye but have never targeted them. We have done day trips from our lodge on Gullrock a couple times.

6751951,Walleye2242,2023-07-24 07:14:00,263,gullrock is right there and it is a great lake to fish.
6751989,Steve Comerford,2023-07-24 10:35:00,28,How the heck are you going to get into Nungesser? You'd have to hump your boat and motor around the rapids. Lotta work for one day of fishing.
6752025,Franco,2023-07-24 14:27:00,107,Exactly the kind of input I’m looking for! Thank you!
6752047,SweetD,2023-07-24 18:02:00,243,Just jump in the rapids and see where it takes you &#x1f60e;
6752191,johnboat,2023-07-25 15:18:00,2014,I thought here's a Resources Development Road off of 125 that takes you there.One from our Spring group went there and didn't say anything about an inconvenience.
6752241,johnboat,2023-07-25 20:38:00,2014,"Correction:I just talked with they guy in our group.It was Faulkenhsm, not Nungessor."
6752595,Eyesore99,2023-07-27 09:38:00,5,Nungesser is great but it would require a portage around some falls.
