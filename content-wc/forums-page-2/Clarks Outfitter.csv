6753655,Net_Man,2023-08-02 14:42:00,580,3 complaints now of leaky boats at this specific location - maybe time to inquire about this specifically - or not and blow it off just as the original poster thought....

6753471,Walleye2242,2023-08-01 11:57:00,263,No sir I have not. Just Gullrock lake. Fished nunguesser(?) lake for a day a few years ago. Would like to hit stormer but too rich for me and i like to cook on my own time. Maybe new folks will change some plans as i hear its a tip top place....but thats just what i hear. no factual experience.

6753535,Net_Man,2023-08-01 18:04:00,580,I was pretty skeptical of the original post also due to the lack of lake name but.... I have personally heard the same complaints about the boats and motors at Gull Lake North from some one else that was there this year... Maybe Prov1800 can chat with them about this.
6753543,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-08-01 19:15:00,358,The leaky boats can be turned into handy bathtubs by filling them with water a few feet from shore. The free minnows can be set free in the boats and they will nibble the dead skin off your feet just like a high-end Japanese spa.
6753547,prov1800,2023-08-01 19:41:00,5010,"No need for me to chat to them over this.Ive never been there but personally know 6 groups of guys that have and they don't have any complaints and had a great time and are going back.Ive been to south Gull and had a great time.Hard to have everything perfect all the time,things break.But someone has to show up during the week to do a check,bring some gas for boats and generator.Dont believe for a minute that they didn't come and check on guests There planes up there daily.I have a Garmin Expedition so if I needed something I could get in touch with them.Usually they have some sort of communication that's available to guests."
6753549,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2023-08-01 19:46:00,240,"I think you will love Auger Lake--my brother and I were there in May of 2016, and despite the coldest/windiest weather I have ever experienced in over 30 fly-ins, we had a great trip and caught (easily) over 100 fish per day for two guys, and one day where we caught over 200. Don Eliott of Mattice Lake Outfitters owned the outpost then, and he was a great guy, great pilot, and a very accommodating outfitter. Cabins are clean and fairly new, and everything worked well. I have heard nothing but great reviews of the new owners. I think you will have a good trip with them. One piece of advice I always give is to fish the portage lakes if they are available, and there are two good ones at Auger Lake."
6753561,labatter,2023-08-01 22:00:00,8,"Our group of 8 was at Clark’s NorthGull Lake for one week over May/June 2023.The cabin set up with 2 sleeping cabins and a main cabin was great. Nice big covered deck. Gas generated electrical outlets in all facilities and flush toilet in the bathroom with shower.No fishing complaints. Cal 74 described best areas. Our best walleye was 26” and a 40” Pike(so my buddy said!!). A ton of fish.All staff and owners were really nice and friendly. They got us in early which was appreciated.A couple of days into the trip we did have an ice shortage because ice was delivered on the dock and melted into empty bags?!? It was hot. But to me that wasn’t a big item. We made a little in the refrigerator. Clark’s was extremely busy with lots of arrivals. Kind of understood a mistake or two.COVID-Yes, from a couple of comments I heard Clark’s really got hammered being shut down. It will take awhile from what I heard to get back to normal.There was no outside communication. Some other outfitters have Inreach. But we could have rented a satellite phone somewhere but didn’t. I haven’t decided who I think is responsible for communication.The boats. Cal 74 was very nice in his description. I would describe them as leaky junk beaters. You really needed waders. We had mechanic visits, Motor swapping by him and loading motors on the plane to go back for repairs. We cursed the boats daily.Overall a great trip for me, but I’m easily pleased. Sure beats not fishing."

Make a post early in the weekend and apparently I'm supposed to wait by eagerly awaiting any and all responses during the weekend, instead of enjoying my weekend and heading out of town. Anyways, heaven forbid the name of a lake isn't all that important to me in the grand scheme of things. Just looked it up and it was ""North Gull Lake"". (Edit - We were there toward the tale end of June 2022) Fishing was decent, cabins were decent. Best fishing we found for anyone asking was way up on the N/W side before and after the flowage between the two lakes and up above the Rapids in front of the cabin. We were not checked in on once during the week and the boats/motors were not in good shape. We also did not have any form of communication, thankfully it wasn't necessary. As mentioned, when we informed them of the boats they didn't seem overly concerned and as someone else stated it's like it was some hot zone and rush/rush to get in and out vs checking the equipment over. And for people to drop 6-9k a week, I guess I expect decent equipment. Maybe there's lots of you with deeper pockets than myself and that's not a concern. Service other than that was decent.The SOLE purpose of my thread, before a group of six drops another 9k for another week of fishing, I was merely asking if this was possibly a post COVID thing, as my group has been with them before and had no complaints. Many resorts struggled during the shut-down. If the keyboard warriors can't deal with an honest inquiry, get over it."

6753423,adempsey2.0,2023-08-01 07:58:00,611,Clark's purchased a bunch of camps a few years ago (not exactly sure when) and Gull North was one of them. It could be they just did not have the time/budget to get it up to their current standards. Especially with COVID putting a huge financial strain on the industry. That doesn't explain the camp checks etc.. so who knows what was going on with all that. The whole deposit debacle was never a good look either.
6753429,gmattbruin,2023-08-01 08:15:00,174,"Cal74....""keyboard warriors""? Hey man, we're all using a keyboard no different than you did when you made this post to begin with. ""Weekend warriors""...well the post was made with the weekend coming. You start of with your disclaimer about not bashing, but in all reality it was an outfitter bashing post. Like I said, these informative, constructive posts based on our experiences, good and bad ate sometimes helpful. But cmon...this is a critique on a fly in in 2022. You say it was a bad experience. I get that. But not remembering the lake you flew into, struggled with equipment, flew out of, talked to the outfitter about, drove home, talked to your group about, slips the memory?? That's why your post was questioned. I honestly don't think that's far fetched for some to think, ð¤ I'm not a fan of outfitter bashing tbh on here. It can have limited or far reaching affects . These guys are trying to make a living. Good critique could save others from making a mistake, but the info has to be detailed and have validity. I think the validity got lost ""forgetting "" the camp-lake. Good luck on your next trip. I mean that with sincerity Cheers"

6753459,cal74,2023-08-01 11:02:00,96,"Appreciate the recommendations, just confirmed/booked with Boreal to Auger Lake for next June as of yesterday. Their correspondence has been great. Why wait a year to post? As stated, a couple of guys who have been with them before hadn't had anything negative to say and we were just looking at re-booking a trip for next year (do every other year). There was nothing else horribly wrong or such a bad experience I felt it was necessary to call anyone out. I honestly don't see anything I've said as a BASH at all, maybe some feel otherwise. I legitimately feel what we experienced was kind of a COVID thing and hopefully was a one off and maybe just at that lake? Maybe the group before us beat the crap out of the boats and bounced the lowers on some rocks, which where we were at could have been easy to do. We mentioned the boats to the pilot when he picked us up and he didn't look and we mentioned it again back at the lodge before departing and honestly felt like we were shrugged off. I'm still baffled that apparently the fact I'm the only one that forgets the name of a lake? It wasn't meant to be a lake specific/outpost thread either. Just a ""Hey, is this the new norm or a one time thing""? My job pushes my brain capacity to the limit with the responsibilities I have. I also have two aging parents 200 miles away in opposite directions and a lot else going on in my life to keep up with things that are minor details to me, like the name of a lake that I more than likely will never be at again. Regardless, thanks anyways. Was hoping to get some feedback from others who have traveled up there last year or this year."

If this was your experience and your reporting your experience then its not ""bashing."" People post positive experiences of their fishing trips and some report things that were not great about their trips. I assume that folks that had great experiences with a place that gets a negative result from another person might get touchy over the post??? I might say that Clark's can be touchy on this board as he seems very popular...one way or the other. I have been to his drive camps long ago and they were fine. He treated us well. I moved on as i find the fishing better in the red lake area. just my opinion."

Boats didn’t leak, motors started up just fine, cabin was tight and everything worked, including the generator which was used all night for CPAP machine. Only thing overlooked was a mirror for the sink. Told pilot about it on initial check flight, and pilot on second check flight arrived with a new mirror and installed it. We did have a problem with a motor that wouldn’t go into gear, and luckily that happened near the cabin so we were able to paddle back easily. Check flight pilot took that motor back and new motor came in with group coming in after us. Had two check flights delivering ice and more minnows (we didn’t take the minnows as the walleyes were hitting the jigs and plastic just fine).Ended up with at least 800 fish caught between the two of us. Was extremely satisfied with the service provided and everything being up to snuff. Heading back with Clark’s on August 4 for a weeklong trip to Antenna Lake. Also booked Snelgrove Lake with them for next May."

6753209,kona77,2023-07-30 22:00:00,236,I hope the Moderators pull this thread. There is no way a group fishes with the Clarks and do not get at least one camp check. Have had excellent fishing on all our trips (11 trips.. 6 lakes). As I posted on our return this May from Wright Lake. We did experience an issue with the generator the 1st night and called the Clarks the next morning. They flew in a new generator that same day.

Come back with the date and outpost name and I’m sure someone here could chime in on their experience and conditions. I’ve never been to Clark’s but they advertise a lot and were at the All Canada Shows with nice booths set up. Btw- did you at least catch any fish?"
6753223,gmattbruin,2023-07-31 04:45:00,174,"My whole reason earlier for questioning, I mean asking the question on ""forgetting "" what lake he fished was obviously cynical, but kinda making my point. Legit critique of a lodge, outfitter or particular lake can be beneficial. This site has many posts by newcomers asking about lodges, outfitters and especially what's up with particular lakes. Critique can be valuable. But you lose the Legit part when you ""can't remember"" a lake you chose, then flew into, fished fir a week, flew out of,etc. Our group has been doing these for 20yrs or so, many lakes and we remember each and every one. For whatever reason, this was a lame attempt at bashing an outfitter. Bold move on trashing another's livelihood. Not cool"

Six of us and out of the four boats at the out post, all four boats were in pretty rough shape. Broken seats, leaking, and 3 out of the 4 motors props were really beat up. Didn't seem overly concerned when we informed them. They never checked on us and I'm not sure why in this day and age, there was no communication available and they never checked on us all week. Lots of planes going back and forth in the air, so it wasn't the weather. My group had been with them before and had great reviews, so not sure if it was just a recovering from COVID or ?? Looking at booking our next years trip and not sure if we should just chalk it up to something else, or if this may be the new norm? Also looking at Boreal and Amik for this next year.

Motors ran great and were easy to start, props were fine, Boats did not leak much at all We were checked several times and provided with the free minnows each time checked Fishing was excellent . Went to Pusher lake May 28 to June 3rd 2022 caught over400 plus fish. Went to Okanse lake June 2- June 10 this year Caught 803 fish. Weather was very hot and most minnows died, but we used tails and still caught hundreds of fish Cabins were very nice, got a case of water each provided by Clarks.

Surprised they did not check in on you as I thought they delivered minnows midweek also? When we land, if there’s a party going out we ask them if there’s any major issues. We also send our “runt” to go inspect the boats / props and start each of them while we unload the plane. Learning the hard way, we also check hot water in the shower, toilets / outhouses, screens and fuel tanks. So many times people act like they are landing in a hot LZ but we now take our time unloading the plane. We had a similar issue last year with Chimo at their Hornby outpost as we were the 1st group in since Covid but they really didn’t do a great job of opening it up and checking usability. This group I went with has been going there for ~15 years so they wrote a repair / improvement list and gave it to them when we got back and pretty sure it got S’canned as he never heard a response from them so that ended the 15year run there."
