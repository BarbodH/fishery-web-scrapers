Would stay at the main resort and would like to know what kind of numbers I might expect for Walleye and Perch this time of year. Don't expect to get the numbers like more remote areas but one poster stated he was excited to catch 30 walleye in 5 days of fishing, not what I call even decent fishing up in Canada. Also very interested in spending a couple of days fishing for Jumbo Perch. This seems to be more of a river style fishing using slip boppers for both walleye and perch. That may depend on the time of year but if I go I would probably get a guide for at least a day maybe 2. I live on a lake that shares a border with Ontario and ever since they won't allow us to take minnows across the border I do miss some excellent perch fishing. From what I can tell the cabins look OK but if anyone has info on the rental boats I would also appreciate that. Thanks,"

Water is relatively shallow everywhere near main camp Perch can be found all over in reed beds sing slip floats and worms Casting for walleyes much better on cloudy days, early morning or dusk. Can fish for perch during sunny periods or mid day Camp owners Jaime and Josee are good people Tell them James sent you"
6684248,jbb1069,2022-09-05 10:49:00,33,P.S. when conditions are right we caught over 30 walleyes a day casting gold rapalas and live target minnow baits

Google search might turn it up. i did their wabus cabin 6/7 yrs ago before they sold it. Solid couple. the week we went, he had to spend 3 days getting rid of beaver dam and trucking gravel in so we could get down to lake to get over to cabin. we had to bug out in rain that week, but hey, i can't control weather. tell him we said hi also please."
