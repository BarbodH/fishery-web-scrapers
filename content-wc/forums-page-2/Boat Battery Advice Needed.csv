6753127,Spurgery,2023-07-30 10:28:00,79,I have a 2021 Lund 1875 Crossover with a 150 merc and a 9.9 kicker plus a lowrance elite 9 for electronics. No trolling motor. I need to replace the battery. Ran it completely dead on accident and it doesn’t seem to hold a charge very well anymore over time. It has an interstate 24M cranking battery that I will be replacing. Says it has 1000 cranking amps and 800 cold cranking amps. Should I replace it with same battery or something else? For what it’s worth the boat gets stored in my attached but unheated garage in Nebraska. I typically do not use the boat in cold weather.

I use a dual charger off the engine (115 hp) alternator. I tune the motor every other year. I run the motor about 30-40 hours per year. I typically troll 15-20 hours per year. Yep I lose a little top end speed with 4 batteries on board but have yet to lose a day on the water tostarting issues. 2010 Alumacraft Dominator 175, 115 Yamaha"

Running it completely dead could have shortened its life (red zone in chart below). 3. Use a multimeter before and after charging to monitor your battery's condition. You can find one on Amazon for $30 or less.4. A group 24 battery is at the bare minimum. Get a 29 or 31 when you replace it.
