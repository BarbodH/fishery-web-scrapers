Seems the majority you have to fly to get to the camp. I would love to hear if there are camps in Manitoba that are like ontario. I like to cook for myself and do not have deep pockets but would love to hear of options. any camps you can drive too? I would enjoy learning of them.
6754027,DeBo,2023-08-04 14:59:00,211,If you look at camps north of The Pas on the grass river chain I think you’ll find some camps that would work for you. Lots of great fishing up there from my research. I suspect it gets talked about less due to it’s a heck of a drive there compared to sunset country Ontario.If you like fall fishing and don’t care about nature you could do a trip to the Red River or the Winnipeg river below Pine Falls affordably and a reasonable drive.Lots of fisheries in between those as well. If I wanted to start walleye fishing in Manitoba I’d look at Cedar Lake by Grand Rapids.The northern Manitoba fly ins are way more expensive than sunset country. Maybe someone on here knows why? I would guess distance and lodges vs outposts.

We'd see their boats out with the native guides, so that's what their business seemed to be at the time. This was maybe 20 years ago. There's a campground at Grass River provincial Park with tent sites, vault toilets and showers. Walleyes, pike, whitefish & lakers to fish for, I think smallies too. We used to go there in June, trying to time it just after ice-out and had great fishing for eveyrtyhing, although the main target was pike in the shallows."

Housekeeping camp is down river about a mile from the lake - you have to motor up the small river to get to the lake. Wekusko Falls Lodge https://www.wekuskofallslodge.com/. Cabins are nothing fancy, but adequate, I haven't been there since the earlier 2000's, camp has changed hands, but reports are good. Lots of trophy walleyes and pike, many Master Angler Awards. Bill"
6754115,Dacotah Eye,2023-08-05 11:51:00,2722,"The cabins at Kum Back Kabins are two bedroom with cooking facilities. Cold running water only and outhouse bathrooms. There is a central bathroom with pay showers. There are also three newer cabins with their own bathrooms. Walleye are mostly not large, but we did catch one that was 31 1/2 inches. The last time I was there, the weekly cost for the cabin was under $400. I went there with friends for many years and always enjoyed the trip. The last time I went there was with my son in 2009. He has been too busy raising babies to go back so far and when I went in 2009 all of my fishing buddies had passed away. I am looking forward to another trip to there in the near future."
6754121,GBS,2023-08-05 13:20:00,2271,"That would be Grass River Lodge. I was there a while ago. May be spendier than the OP wants. Does include 3 meals per day, boats with guides. Excellent cabins. It is a straight shot drive to. Geared toward Pike (my biggest was 52"", now they are getting 54's (!). Mid to upper 40 inch northerns, several every day. Walleye fishing was not until 1/2 hr before shore lunch, but you can do that all day, if you want. Big lake trout, but dependent on the season. Offers one-day fly-outs to smaller lakes if you want really hot walleye action."
