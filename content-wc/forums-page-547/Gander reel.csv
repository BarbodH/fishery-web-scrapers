Good fishing Pikeman."
1179422,rpieske,2010-03-18 15:54:00,1276,The only place I know has parts for them is BassPro Shop. They sold the same reel under their own label and do stock parts. You might give them a call at their repair center.
1179434,Guest,2010-03-18 16:52:00,0,You may want to just take it into Gander and see if they will replace it. I believe they have a no questions asked replacement policy on their branded reels.

Unfortunately yours is far past any return date according to cooperate store polices. It can be repaired by any service center that does Pflueger reel repair, it is a Trion with the Gander name on it."
