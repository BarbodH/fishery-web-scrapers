1174669,stevensinks,2010-03-05 06:29:00,330,Last year on our first day on Red Lake my wife picked up a 27 inch walleye on one of these. On the second day she got a 28 1/2 inch eye. After that she would not take the lure off. We are headed back up this summer and she just knows that she will lose HER lure and not be able to catch any fish. Do any of you know were I might find one of these in perch or fire tiger color. I have looked on ebay all winter and not had any luck finding one. Thanks
1174680,Glenman12,2010-03-05 06:58:00,762,is this what you are talking about? lake-link.com/store/item.cfm?ProductID=386
1174789,stevensinks,2010-03-05 12:26:00,330,Those are the ones but in size 10 which is about 1 1/2 inches longer than those. Its the medium diver perch.
1174942,bpetersen,2010-03-05 20:19:00,251,I went on Berkley's website and they don' offer the Frenzy from what I can search on their website. I wonder if they are made anymore...

1179273,Chad,2010-03-18 07:03:00,3523,Another option is to post on the swap board what you are looking for with a picture!
1179296,stevensinks,2010-03-18 07:53:00,330,Im trying to post a photo of the lure we will see if I did it right. Im not doing somthing right. Ill keep working on it.
1179800,stevensinks,2010-03-19 17:53:00,330,Ok I got photos of the lure in a Album called stevensinks. But I still havent figured out how to post them here. Pete if you see this and have one like it I sure would be intrested. Thanks
1179838,polaris-pete,2010-03-19 20:21:00,343,Good job on getting your pics in an album. I am sorry but I do not have this style of Frenzy.But if you look on E Bay there are a couple of them just like the ones pictured. Not sure if you would like the price as 1 was up to $9.50 plus shipping.I looked under Vintage Lures and then typed in Berkley Frenzy. Hope you find some!! If I do run across any I will let you know. Pete
