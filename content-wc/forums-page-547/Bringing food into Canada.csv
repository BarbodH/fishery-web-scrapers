1178872,bpetersen,2010-03-16 23:11:00,251,"Ditto on Bill's post. Haven't been asked for more than a couple of decades. Not sure if that sound better than 25 years. Just a reasonable amount of food is the norm, now."
1178071,Fishin Fun,2010-03-14 20:22:00,218,"It seems to me that many years ago when I started going to Gull Rock with my dad that we brought food up with us. If I remember correctly we were always asked at the border how many days of food we had with. So we started purchasing the food in Red Lake. This past year it seemed like the prices went through the roof. We were told that it was because the mining industry is doing very well in the area. We were not asked about food crossing the border this year, so now we are thinking of bringing food up with us again. The only thing I can find on the internet is that they say you can bring a ""resonable"" amount of food for personal use. What experience have any of you had bringing food into Canada?"
1178081,prov1900,2010-03-14 20:41:00,544,"As long as it doesn't come from the dirt, i.e. potatoes, etc, then you will be fine. They ask how much meat you have, especially in terms of beef, so you are not selling it. I think there are probably weight restrictions, but two to three pounds per person per day isn't ""unreasonable"", notwithstanding the health related side effects . We eat everything we bring, and if there is extra, it goes to the resort for their personal enjoyment. We live in ""beef country"" so we come loaded with the best. Groceries are high everywhere and us not buying our food in Canada isn't a reflection of their prices, it is a reflection of us not wasting any more time than possible...off the water. We do buy our taters, onions, and other dirt grown vegetables in Canada. In and out, back on the road. Get the tarp off the boat, trucks unloaded, bait in the boat, licenses and we are off....two months and about a week...and counting."

1178176,Babamel2,2010-03-15 07:59:00,414,I have been going for over 20 yrs and have never been asked about the amount of food. Only if we had potatoes. -- the concern about Potatoes is a blythe that has affected the canadian potato crop.
1178201,Bill Krejca,2010-03-15 09:07:00,6107,"A long time ago, maybe 25 years and more, it was customary to be asked about the quantity of food being brought in, so much so that I used to save the store receipts as an answer. I have not experienced this question for quite a while, other than the potato query. Bill Krejca"
1178203,Moondog,2010-03-15 09:10:00,362,"Taking food into Canada has never been an issue for us with the exception of potatoes. We are in a motor home, they ask how long we are staying and I can only assume that they know we have food."
1178345,5 of Diamonds,2010-03-15 16:53:00,151,This is exactly the same thing we've been asked too was only about the potatoes. It's been every year for about the last 3 or 4. The majority of our crossings have been @ The Thousand Island Bridge. It's probably just a good idea to get the potatoes once you get into Canada and avoid any potential unnecessary delay @ the border.
1178507,geareng,2010-03-16 07:39:00,335,"We buy frozen pre-cooked sliced potatoes and bring them into Canada without a problem every year. The Canadian customs don't have a problem with them because they cannot grow and they are very convenient. The night before we do a shore lunch we take a bag out and we are all set, no slicing to deal with."
1178529,cast_and_blast,2010-03-16 08:28:00,1098,"If going in multiple vehicles, but still 1 group you might want to make sure you have the food divided among the vehicles. We did run into a issue with that 1 year - wasn't a big deal, but I don't want to give them (customs) any reason to tear apart the vehicle. Scott"
1178870,eyemike,2010-03-16 22:46:00,233,I went to Eagle Lake in August. My wife and I took all of our food excluding potatoes. We stopped at a supermarket in Dryden for potatoes. If I would have known how little of difference the prices actually were I would have bought all of my food there. Accept our Iowa steaks They are more expensive up there but from the prices that I saw there is no huge savings by hauling it from home. Just my thoughts. Mike
