1178063,Fishin Fun,2010-03-14 19:54:00,218,I've been going to Red Lake for years and have never found a bait shop that sells salted minnows. One year we brought up flash frozen minnows and the fish never bit on them. Live bait is the way to go. We fish Gull Rock and have always had great success using live minnows and leaches.

Lift the jig 3 or 4 feet off the bottom and pick up big pike every once in a while. We couldn't keep them off. Walleyes in the Red Lake area are aggressive and they are hungry."
