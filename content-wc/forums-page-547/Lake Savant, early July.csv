Cliff and Roma were GREAT hosts, and although the weather was thoroughly miserable and fishing was deemed ""slow"" by their standards, I still caught 60+ walleyes each day, some nice pike (37 1/2"" was the biggest, though I had a 40+ up to the boat).I only got a little bit of lake trout fishing in on the last day, and I would like to do some more of that this year. Any tips on where to find lakers and what to use?"

We have stayed at Wildewood for many years, but have visited Cat Track and Cliff and Roma's on occasion. All good camps and all really good people.On the water Cliff is ""the man"" especially when it comes to Lake Trout fishing. He's forgotten more about lake trout fishing than most of us will ever learn.We would have been on Savant the same time as you last year. Yes, it was cold then. Was there over the fourth of July with my wife and it was crap weather then too. Went back in September to observe the MNR test netting the lake and it turned out to be the best weather of the summer! Go figure...Pooch"
1177582,Bob_Loblaw,2010-03-13 11:54:00,109,"Thanks, Pooch - I'll definitely take you up on that. Having only been there once (and it will be the first trip there for the rest of my group, so I'm the default ""guide"") I would appreciate any guidance for trout and for walleye/pike too. Cliff and Roma were such great hosts last year, and I had a blast even with the junky weather. I can't wait to get back! I'll say one positive thing about the cold, windy rain though: mosquitos and flies didn't bother us a bit all week"
