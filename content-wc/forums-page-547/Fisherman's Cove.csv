1178100,JDP,2010-03-14 22:33:00,1457,"I noticed that the site was unavailable a couple of weeks ago.The last time I viewed the site (in January) the rate information was for 2009.You may want to give Dan or Keith a call. This happened one other time, that I am aware of, the site was down due to personal reasons overriding the need to update the rate information,etc. and renewal."
1178190,Flip Silverlake,2010-03-15 08:45:00,645,Wasn't this the place that was hit by a tornado last year???? There was one in that area that killed two guys from Oklahoma.
1178199,Moondog,2010-03-15 09:06:00,362,"Yes, and 2 of the cabins were completely destroyed and lots of damage to most of the others. Pretty nasty. Happened a few days after we went right by there on the way back from Gull Rock. Someone out there should know if they are going to be in business this year."
1178229,Flip Silverlake,2010-03-15 10:48:00,645,We were in Kenora that day an if I remember it was not a nice storm! From what I saw they had a nice set up there. To bad if that storm put them out of bussness
1178248,fish 4 fun,2010-03-15 11:32:00,101,"We were scheduled at the Cove two weeks after the tornado went through. Our cabin was one of the ones that were destroyed. We were fortunate enough to find another lodge on short notice. We drove by boat to Fishermanâ€™s Cove to talk to Dan. The damage was amazing. The camp was mostly cleaned up by then but the path of the tornado was very evident. You could see where it came down the hill at the resort, hit land again across the bay. You could track it through Scout Bay. We fished in McKenzie around Little Sandbanks and you could see were the tornado struck land again. As the crow flies that got to be 15-16 miles. I guess it scared the crap out of a group staying at the Scout Lake Resort Outpost. Terrible tragedy, certainly not anything one expects in Ontario.They stayed open the whole time. Because they are so busy they weren't able to take some of the groups that were scheduled in those cabins. They have rebuilt the cabins and will back to full strength this spring. I don't know about the web site but I spoke with Dan a month ago and they are looking forward to this season."

We had one of our guests shoot this video with his cell phone as our guests were racing to get off the water that day. Although scenes like this are extremely rare in NW Ontario, it is a somber reminder of the power of Mother Nature.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF_PfExRPMA"
1178276,fish 4 fun,2010-03-15 13:13:00,101,Chilling video. Those guys sound pretty calm considering. I probably would have panic and just drove around in circles.
1178430,rather-be-fishin,2010-03-15 20:58:00,429,"We stayed at Fisherman's Cove last summer just 2 weeks after the tornado hit. We were to have stayed in one of the cabins that was destroyed and had stayed in that cabin the year before.... Dan & Keith & families worked hard and saw to it that the resort was up and running... The area where the 2 cabins were destroyed was pretty much swept clean by the tornado and they planned to rebuild them and have those 2 cabins back in operation this season. The 3rd cabin that was moved several feet off it's foundation was repaired and back in use the weekend we were there. Much of the rest of the resort and other cabins were untouched...... It was an unfortunate horrible act of nature.......as you can see in the above You Tube video, the sky before the storm hit..... was sunny and blue.....and the tornado came out of no where. I now really realize & respect how quickly a storm can hit. We are booked to go back to Fisherman's Cove again this summer......we have received our confirmation letter and they are still in business. I also noticed that their website was down....but know the web site has been down in past years, so just keep checking the website for when it is renewed. 4 1/2 months and counting down the days! Rather-be-fishin !!!"
1178455,Moondog,2010-03-15 23:02:00,362,Great to hear that they are up and running!!!! The last thing that we all want to see is a great place like Fisherman's Cove go under because of natures wrath. I am sure all the families of the individuals that lost their lives or were otherwise affected feel the same. Prayers for all of them and their loss.
