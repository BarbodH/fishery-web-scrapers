After more than thirty years, and my manic pursuits of walleyes having tempered to a bit lower frenzy more matching to my age, it occurs to me that it may be fun to fish for perch with my flyrod. Anyone do that? What do you use? I'm thinking Clouser minnows in colors to mimic shiner minnows. Maybe a black leech fly.Anyone have suggestions?"
