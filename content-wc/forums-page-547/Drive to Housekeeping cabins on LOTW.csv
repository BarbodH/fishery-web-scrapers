1175627,geareng,2010-03-08 08:40:00,335,"Don't know if you have booked the trip yet, but I will tell you what we found. Up until last year our group always did the houseboat deal on Lac Seul. Two years ago we did our trip because of the ever increasing costs of the houseboats, high fuel costs and a few people cancelling on us at the last minute. So at that point I was looking for an alternate location. I asked a friend of mine who fishes professionally if he had to pick one location as a replacement for Lac Seul what would it be, he answered the Canadian side of LOTW. I think where you go depends on when you go, what you are fishing for and what type of boat you have. We wanted to go late May or early June before school gets out. We ended up choosing Rod and Reel Resort in Sioux Narrows and will keep going there. The pricing is very reasonable, the staff very helpful, the foot excellent and the accomodations nice and clean. I think the bottom line there are many nice resorts on LOTW, if you want to fish more open water the Morson area is great. If you want the more secluded areas, then the area between Sioux Narrows and Kenora is ideal and if you want to fish in the summer in crystal clear water, then I would recommend the Whitefish Bay area."
1175658,Obabikon,2010-03-08 09:57:00,2370,"I wouldn't really call the Morson area ""more open water"". Sure, to the South West is the open water, but most people don't fish that. We fish the islands, coves, and obabikon lake. Very sheltered, with a lot less traffic than that of Sioux Narrows, Nestor Falls and Kenora. Just my opinion though."
1175686,1shooter,2010-03-08 11:23:00,1493,I also wouldn't agree that Morson is considered open water. We fish that area in the spring/fall and love it. I realize this isn't a drive in camp but they will come and pick you up. They have always been very good to us.http://www.morsonoutfitters.com/ You may also want to check out Obabikon. They also do a good job.http://www.obabikon.com/
1176000,geareng,2010-03-09 07:19:00,335,"All I was trying to do was forward information to help someone understand LOTW based on what I had dicovered when I first went to LOTW. I have no personal interest in any lodge or camp nor am I a guide that makes a living from pointing people in a direction of a lodge, I just want to go fishing. When I decided to switch from the Lac Seul area to LOTW, there were a number of people on this site that help me with similiar feedback when I was looking into where to go. As I stated the ""Morson area is great"" and I know a number of people that fish there. But if you take a pinpoint and put it on Morson and draw a 360 degree circle around it, the area in the section south west is open water. There is nothing wrong with that, but I think that if someone is trying to select a new resort, they need to know that, and that all I was trying to say. That is no different than I think someone needs to know about the water clarity of Whitefish Bay and how it dramatically effects certain types of fishing depending on the time of year. A friend of mine went to Whitefish Bay in the spring and no one told him about the water clarity, so as a result his Walleye fishing was a challenge for that week. Had he gone later in the year, say in July he would not of had a problem. The bottom line is that LOTW is a great fishery and I am sure wherever one stays or fishes, great fishing can be had."
1176026,Obabikon,2010-03-09 08:01:00,2370,"gear, Wasn't meaning to sound critical of your post. The more opinions in posts like this the better. However, I thought your comment made it sound like the Morson area is in the open water section. It is in the islands on the edge of open water. It does offer both protected water and open water. Generally speaking, large amounts of open water is not something people look at as a positive. That's why I mentioned your post. Either way... Lake of the Woods is a fantastic place to go!"
1176824,fishanytime,2010-03-11 07:17:00,63,"I have fished the Sioux Narrows area for over 30 years, great fishing area, all species available. Rod and Reel is very will located and family run. I would recommend the resort and area but would recommend a guide for a least part of your trip."
1178520,StarcraftJohn,2010-03-16 08:06:00,8,"Well I finally made a decision last night and it looks like it will be a boat in cabin on the Northwest Angle on Lake Of The Woods Called Flag Island. Staying for a week on July 18 - 25. Put my deposit down last night. Really had my heart set on a drive to cabin but several people I talked, including family had been to Flag Island in the past and really liked it. Also I have never been to that side of LOTW so it will be a new adventure for me also witch is always good. Now the only problem I have is 122 days till I leave, which could be worse, plenty of time to get the boat and truck ready to go. I appreciate all the helpfull advice from the members, a very knowledgable group. I will be sure to post a report on my return. Thanks, John"
1178646,Obabikon,2010-03-16 12:20:00,2370,That's awesome John! I hope you have a fantastic time!
1174004,StarcraftJohn,2010-03-03 09:13:00,8,"I am looking for a good drive to housekeeping lodge on Lake of the Woods, me and my wife maybe my mom will be going, not sure about the dog yet but we like to take her along when we can but it is not a deal breaker. Been going up north for 20 years now only missed about 4 years, done the American Plan trips and they are nice but it is also nice to be on your own schedule. When you get back to your cabin and want to have a fish fry for supper you can, but it would be nice to be close enough to Kenora or another town to go out for a meal or the Lodge would allow you to come up for a meal if so desired. We like to fish for Walleye mainly, throw some smallmouth in there for fun and the ocassional Northern, and if I could catch a nice Muskie it would be perfect. I would consider a boat in place if everything was just right but with my wife and mom going it would be more hassle if they wanted to go to town for a day or so. I appreciate your opinions and thank you for your advice. John"
1174008,wolverine fan,2010-03-03 09:31:00,71,"I fished/stayed at youngs wilderness camp last june for the first time. It is a boat in but its only about 3/4 of a mile trip so its nothing. The service was awesome, the fishing was great and the owners really cared about how we were doing. I was on the American plan with my son, but i toured the housekeeping cabins and they were new and beautiful. Wherever you go have fun. Pm me if you have further questions."
1174030,camp chef,2010-03-03 10:34:00,915,"Check out www.bignorthlodge.com it is on the winnipeg river 20 miles north of Kenora. Great fishing, great cabins, They are happy to cook you a meal if you want. We cook all our own,but have been invited many times.You will enjoy this place."
1174051,Obabikon,2010-03-03 11:21:00,2370,"Here's some very good ones out of the Morson area (just 35miles from Baudette MN) Mylies Place - www.myliesplace.com Justin works very hard, and you'll enjoy the area and trip very much Beuna Viesta - www.buenavistaresort.com Red Wing - www.redwinglodge.net"
1174180,aggie kolisnik,2010-03-03 17:24:00,39,try smith camps on lake of the woods(they have everything you want and they are great people.) www.smithcamps.com I think that's the site.
1174252,Hawker,2010-03-03 20:33:00,3967,"I have to 2nd Young's Wilderness Camp. It's just a short five minute boat ride to the landing from the island, 1/2 that if you had my boat!! ha Young's has two very very nice houskeeping cabins with their own landing. Walleye, smallmouth, crappie, northern and muskie are plentiful in the whole area and the scenery is beautiful. We have been going there for the past 18 years straight and I cannot bring myself to even look anywhere else to go! Perry & Carol take very good care of their clients, both housekeeping & American plan. The lodge is always clean, the food is out of this world, very nice boats & motors and the staff is always helpful and friendly!Google Young's Wilderness Camp for their website, then give'em a call, you can't go wrong."
1174335,rpieske,2010-03-04 07:36:00,1276,"I would consider Canadian Haven Resort and Helliar's Resort in Nestor Falls. Canadian Haven is a good family camp with excellent rental boats. Nice young couple with family owns it. Helliar's is one of the original camps in Nestor Falls and still owned by the same family. They have rental boats and a store attached. It is located right at the falls in Nestor Falls. Both would be good choices. Here are links: http://www.candianhaven.com and http://www.helliars.com . Walleye, smallmouth, northern and muskies are all available on LOTW. I spend 4 months per year within a stone's throw of both camps. Check them out. There are several decent restaurants, a good grocery store, a couple of bait shops, a Mercury, Evinrude dealer and even a bakery all close by."
1174413,Bill Krejca,2010-03-04 10:23:00,6107,"I've been staying at Young's for a number of years, hit it in Sep for crappies. We do the housekeeping route. I agree with everything previously stated, great place to stay. Bill Krejca"
1174474,Wall-i-Lama,2010-03-04 13:26:00,1524,"John, Our families stay at Tomahawk in Sioux Narrows. Outstanding houskeeping set up. Fishing is great for walleye, smallmouth and northern. We also do fine on lake trout and crappie. It's a good muskie area, be we don't go after them, usually happens by accident! Friendly, family owned for over 60 years. Its a first class operation. Good luck on your trip this summer!http://www.tomahawkcottages.com/"
1174662,StarcraftJohn,2010-03-05 06:08:00,8,Thank s for all the advice we are going thru all the great looking places and hope to have something booked by the end of next week. John
