Any recommendations on an outfitter than can be driven to would be appreciated.I have fished the Gouin many times in the areas of Baie's Poisson, Hanotaux, Mattawa, and Saraana. I am looking for some new scenery and areas to explore. Fishing for walleye and northern pike. Thank you / Merci."
1175113,5 of Diamonds,2010-03-06 13:12:00,151,How has the fishing been for you in those areas of the Gouin you mentioned?
1175119,Freytown,2010-03-06 13:38:00,770,The fishing is nothing like it was when I first visited in 1980. No outfitters and only a few private cabins. Fly-in camps were the only camps around and they were spread out.Now there are two outfitters on Poisson and private cabins everywhere. The fishing is OK if you are there when their biting but their size is much smaller. Last September water level was at 100% and fishing was really tough. Baie Saraana and Lac Du Male are good but they are a long boat ride from the outfitters cabins. You need lots of gas to reach these places and waste a lot of fishing time.Do you have any info on Baie du Sud?

1176922,Freytown,2010-03-11 12:15:00,770,Any one else have an experience on Baie du Sud?? I know from reading other threads that the Gouin is a favorite destination for folks. Just trying for some other opinions before I make a commitment. Thxs in advance.
1177199,McQ,2010-03-12 07:03:00,615,"Freytown, Baie de Sud has many memories for me - back in the late eighties I helped build the outfitter called Pointe a Dore. It was an exciting time and the fishing was through the roof - then the only access was by float plane and you can guess the rest. The two operators in the baie have marked all the community hples to help the clients locate fish, the difficulty now is the amount of pressure these areas have received. Fishing can be excellent but exploring is necessary. I have been using an outfitter called Nemio which is located on the river entering Baie du Nord, road access is simpler and easier, the area opens to much more water; accommodations, equipment and hosts that do a great job looking after you suit me fine. There are 28 outfitters on the Gouin and over the past 30 years I've been in most of the areas many times, some just a few for obvious reasons. As you are aware it's a huge body of water and can offer up great times, I've found the percentages in my favor regardless weather and time of year with the options available. My priorities are probably different from yours but I do like an end result that makes the trip worthwhile, challenging and comfortable. Incidentally, pricing is virtually the same for comparable outfitters - the choice really is a matter of personal preference."
1177218,Freytown,2010-03-12 08:07:00,770,"McQ,Thank you for the info. I too remember the 80's and feel fortunate to have experienced those earlier years. The Gouin has changed over these years but what hasn't (I got older, lol) time marches on.I fell in love with the Gouin from my first trip in the spring 1980. Since then it has been my only destination for fishing in Canada. I will be back to the Gouin this year but I am not sure exactly where at this time.Personally I would like to see a slot size for keeping fish. Lately I have seen too many fishermen take very small fish. It takes a fish so long to grow in these waters, harvesting the small fish hurts the quality of future fishing in my opinion. Again thxs McQ!"
