1159561,DanL,2010-01-11 20:11:00,262,We are think of trying Gull Rock this year in August. I see there are 5 resorts on this chain of lakes. I am just curious how much boat traffic this lake gets. It does not look like that big of a lake to support 5 resorts and still keep that remote atmosphere.
1159583,Minnow Man,2010-01-11 21:11:00,85,"Hello DanL There are 5 lakes in the system & probably a hundred of miles of shore line, with many bays to fish, the known"" hot spots"" you may have company. If you want to fish by yourself there are lots of bays to fish in. You'll have no problem finding walleye."
1159648,johnboat,2010-01-12 07:41:00,2014,"Dan, This will be my 8th year in a row to Gull Rock. Fishing has always been fantastic and get s better each year. Short answer to your question is: No, the boat traffic is not heavy. Minnow Man is right on. But even in the hot spots with company it is not ""bumper boats"". But then again I have never minded having company, after all it is a hot spot. We bring up our own boats and I always make it a habit to take some time and go exploring into the conecting lakes for a change of atmosphere and to maybe find a new ""hot spot"". Yet it is a small enough system to do the same with a camp boat if you have to. Either way you'll have the time to do so as you will catch your fill of walleyes no matter what time of the year you go. Do a search on here about Gull Rock and you will book your trip without hesitation. We stay at Five Lakes Lodge and wouldn't think of staying anyplace else. If you want remote remote, Everett has rights to a few outpost lakes a short beautiful drive away where you will be assured to be the only boat on the lake and will catch you fill of northerns. Its a great daytrip if you have some beginners or young ones with you. There are some locals on here that can give you more info than I can on the traffic as they are up there all the time and for me unfortunatly it's just 1 week. Good Luck with your booking! Keep'er On The Bottom! JohnB.O.A.T."
1159710,tackleman,2010-01-12 12:09:00,444,"part of the fun if fishing Gullrock is meeting new people. I meet several new groups each year and then get to ""shoot the breeze"" with them year after year. this always leads to new spots to try, since I'm local and spend maybe 2 -3 hours out at a time but the tourists spend 8-12 hours on the lake each day and are trying spots that I wouldn't consider. Of course it works both ways and I share my results with them.I have been in the situation where you go miles from home and look for advice from the locals (mine was for duck hunting in Saskatchewan). Gullrock is heavily fished but thanks to the TREMENDOUS effort of the local camps on the lake, restricting the size of fish brought into camp, the fishing is absolutely amazing.This year, the MNR have changed the fishing regulations so beware, this year NO lake trout may be kept. this applies to all waters in the Red Lake system."
1159761,2746,2010-01-12 15:09:00,3206,"We fish Gullrock at least once and usually twice a year and have been for the past 8 years. We also fish LacSeul at least once each year. All the good things about the quality of fishing you hear about Gullrock is true but you will have company. Not sure what you expect as ""remote atmosphere"" but you will see a number of boats each day and will share most ""hot spots"" with several other boats. As you can tell from other posts the folks who enjoy Gullrock don't mind that. I can tell you we see far fewer boats and are able to fish by ourselves more easily on LacSeul which was one of the reasons we began to go there. I would encourage you to try Gullrock but if you are going expecting to be in a rtemote enviornment you may be disappointed. Instead, go looking forward to the good folks (like tackelman) you might meet."
1161258,luv2fishcanada,2010-01-18 17:58:00,41,"This year will be my 26th trip to Gullrock. I have always gone either the first or second week of June which is one of the busiest times of the year. Yes you will have boats around you. This is a big piece of water. The ""Boot"" at times has 30 boats in the area and at times 2 or 3. You'll see Tackleman troll through the area and he is off to another of the many places on Gullrock to catch fish. I would think August would be a little slower but am not sure. Gullrock is an incredible place to fish (numbers and size)so putting up with a few other boats has never been a problem for me. If you end of choosing Gullrock give Bill and Maureen a call at Golden Hook Camp."
1161964,AllenW,2010-01-21 06:30:00,11482,"Consider we go in sept.Busy? Not if you compare to Milacs on opener, but considering where you are, some of the hot spots get some traffic.Gull was the only lake I've ever had someone back troll into me while I was anchored...go figure.Trick to Gull is there's very good fishing off the hot spots, some times very close to them but out of traffic.Don't be afraid to wander a bit.Might try the river too, we've hit a few there from time to time too.But I wouldn't worry about finding fish.al"
1161991,Guest,2010-01-21 08:30:00,0,Even when I think back to when is was (Gullrock) at it's busiest there was still really good places to fish where no one was at and there are still many places I have not found yet that are probably as good if not better to fish on the lake. It seems everyone has their favorite places to fish and in camp word gets out that certain places are really hot and most people in camp go to that spot. Each day try out a different spot and you will be surprised what you will find and no boats around. The past two years it seems like there has been less boats on the lake. I attribute this to the economy and I feel bad for the camp owners and it almost seems lonely out on the lake. I like to see boats and I like to see everyone catching fish and having a great time. That's part of the experience for me. If you want the lake to yourself than try going out earlier in the a.m. and later in the evening and then you'll think the lake was named after you cause you'll have it almost to yourself. It's a great place to go and the fishing is just outstanding. You won't regret it. I stay at Wright's Camp and I feel they do a wonderful job of taking care of you and your needs. They run a class camp and are great people. I am sure the other camps are good also but where I like to fish they are the closest to those spots so I don't spend much time getting to my spots and still be able to wander to different places.
1178066,Fishin Fun,2010-03-14 20:06:00,218,"I've been fishing Gull Rock for years and the traffic on the lake hasn't been too bad. As stated in the other posts, the ""boot"" at times has lots of boats and then the next day will only have a couple. We go in July and last year we spent most of our time at the boot and when we weren't there, we caught tons of walleyes off the dock at the resort(Southbay) on the days the weather was terrible. Actually I think the traffic has been less the past couple of years because of the economy."
1178208,Moondog,2010-03-15 09:30:00,362,"South Bay caters to RVers however Mary does have 3 cabins that can occasionally be had due to a cancellation. We love it there!!! Beautiful setting. 50 amp service, wifi etc. As for remote vs fish??? We have fished Minaki (Rough Rock, Sandy Lake) and caught fish. Did not see many boats there. We fished Minnitaki and saw few boats and not many fish. Then we found Gull Rock and I guess that I can deal with seeing other boats and some competition for hot spots when there is a real good chance to catch a wall hanger. I haven't met anyone on the lake that wasn't pleased with their respective camps and camp hosts. Beware, however. If you bring in fish over 18 inches to eat you risk the wrath of Mary Spenceley, Lee Wright, Bill and Everett. And don't think for a minute they don't watch. They may even ask you to leave camp. They are all no nonsense when it comes to protecting this wonderful fishery. Last year several of us from camp observed 2 guys in a Wright's Camp boat, fishing 2 poles and tuna fishing walleye into the bottom of the boat without any care given to the fish or their release. We told Mary about it and she called Lee and I would hate to have been those guys. Word was that he kicked them out on the spot when they returned to dock. At this late date you may not even be able to get a place on Gull Rock this summer."
