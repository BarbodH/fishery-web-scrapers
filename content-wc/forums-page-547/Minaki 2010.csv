1180725,jignminow,2010-03-22 15:54:00,168,86 days until Minaki....If I take out the weekends it is only 58 and sounds better.........Anyone know if the regulations have changed? Can you still only bring back 2 eyes? I was trying to decifer the rgs on line for zone 5 and it sure looks like the daily limit is 2 but possesion is 4. which can you bring back? Steve
1180734,Guest,2010-03-22 16:31:00,0,2 walleyes and one eagle
1180744,adempsey,2010-03-22 17:11:00,963,"Are you fishing within the border waters region? Minaki is north of Kenora where the border region ends. The border waters include LoTW and includes Cul de Sac and Obabikan lakes and the waters of Aulneau and Western Penninsulas, but excludes Shoal Lake).My interpretation is:If you're fishing LoTW south of Kenora and if you have a SPORT license the limit is 2 walleye/sauger per day and a total of 4 in your possession [never more than 2 in your boat though] (only 1 can be greater than 18.1""). If you have a CONSERVATION license it is a catch and possession limit of 2 (only 1 can be greater than 18.1"").If you're fishing outside of the border waters region in lakes like Big Sand, Little Sand, Pitsol, Gun etc.. then the walleye/sauger limit is 4 for SPORT and 2 for CONSERVATION (only 1 greater than 18.1 inches in both cases).I have yet to fish these areas, just took the info from the MNR regulations."
1180770,Larry Mac,2010-03-22 18:15:00,530,"Hi Jignminnow, I share in your enthusiasm. The rules on fish limits seem pretty clear to me. It does depend on the body of water, time of year and species. There is also maximum size limits.WalleyeNon resident Conservation License (2)Non resident Full License (2) per day (4) in possessionWe are catch and release fisherman with the exception of our shore lunches.When we bring up new fisherman who want to bring fish home we make a little time every day for Jumbo Lake Perch. They are great eating, fun and very easy to catch.Lake (Yellow) PerchNon resident Conservation License (25 fish) or 50 filletsNon resident Full License (50 fish) or 100 filletsThe new guys usually become pretty good at cleaning fish by the end of the week LOL.Have a great TripLarry Mac"
1180999,jignminow,2010-03-23 07:41:00,168,"Alright, got the answer. In the ""exceptions to zone 5"" they list the Winnipeg River system and callout the Minaki area. Regular license is 2 eye limit per day for non res, 4 for resident. I talked to an agent and she said that possesion and daily limit are the same unless otherwise noted. So, once again, it is 30"" walleye fillets for shore lunch with bald eagle eggs, baby loon and muskie cheeks. So good."
1181125,adempsey,2010-03-23 14:20:00,963,"I didn't realize that area was listed under the Winnipeg River System.There is a slot size also: walleye must be between 13.8"" to 17.7"" and not more than one walleye greater than 27.6"""
1181178,jignminow,2010-03-23 16:21:00,168,"yes, that is correct"
1181196,rjg,2010-03-23 17:26:00,13,"I spend a little over two months each summer in Minaki, all kinds of trophy eyes, pike and monster muskies."
1181410,Aaron-IN,2010-03-24 09:34:00,500,The regs have not changed for Minaki and I hope they never do.RJG.....you forgot Smallmouth (maybe I wasn't supposed to say that).
1181473,camp chef,2010-03-24 12:50:00,915,This will be our 5th trip up Minaki and we have taken a northern and less than 20 walleyes out of the system for shorelunches. The fishing gets better every year. Catch and release insures a fishery for the future.This is a remarkable piece of water and we look forward to being able to fish it again in several months.
