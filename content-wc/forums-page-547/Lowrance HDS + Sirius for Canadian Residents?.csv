One of the things I noticed though was that the weather service was not available for Canadian RESIDENTS, even though it works in Canada. So I'm wondering if it is still possible to get the radio portion activated through Sirius.ca on my HDS-5? Or does being Canadian make you SOL for the lowrance sirius?"

I just got the same Lorance unit you do for the boat, but had not inquired about it. If they do deny you service here, you might try coming through the back door."
