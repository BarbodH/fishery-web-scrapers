1179545,fishncamp,2010-03-18 23:10:00,49,Lake Winnipeg can blow up very quickly in the summer. Most walleyes migrate to the colder water in the north basin too. Some good reports in the summer too but fall and winter is best.

Depends greatly when ice out happens.Not many open water trollers out there, so in my view, it is hardly tested to it's potential.I have long believed some well executed open water trolling with bouncers or cranks would yield surprising results early in the season.The water stays cool for a long time, I do not think they run to the North Basin all that quickly. I suspect as much anyway..no real prof.I'm usually too busy chasing them sumo catfish at the opener to tear myself away to go try it. If the conditions are good, and low winds, I should test that more often and see."
1180505,manitobawalleye,2010-03-22 04:51:00,885,myself and a few others i know have spent limited time out there..... you need a big fast boat in case the wind comes up.... i have ran boards and cranks up by hecla as well as bouncers a guy i know that use to fish the rcl has caught at times out from winnipeg beach with boards and cranks.....but nothing consistent but like Ed says nobody has really put a sustained effort into it...... it would take something like 12 guys with 2 or 3 out fairly steady sharing info trying to keep track of them....something that you will not see here.... and after all of that effort you could find the biologists being right..... they feel the vast majority spend there time in the north basin feeding on rainbow smelt..... the north basin is a long drive and is for the most part unihabitated...
