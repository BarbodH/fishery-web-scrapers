We were thinking of attending the Northwest Sports Show and would look around then, but any recommendations before we go would be great. We thought of going before with my dad, but he can no longer go and I want to take my family before they are too old. We have looked at Lac Suel, Lake of the Woods, and a few others but can't make a decision. Thanks for your help."

1178017,toolboy,2010-03-14 17:54:00,515,I forgot to mention that I will be bringing my own boat. It definitely has to be a family type place and somewhat affordable. Please mention any resorts that will be in attendance at the sportshow.
