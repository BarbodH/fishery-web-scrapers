1175177,teddi,2010-03-06 16:49:00,349,"you don,t have to boat 45 days just have your boat in canada for 45 days."
1175217,fisherman 1,2010-03-06 18:43:00,39,"Yes, Teddi you are correct! When your Boat crosses the boarder heading North the 45 days start until it crosses back into the US. As for boarder waters I am not sure how this will work?"
1175232,Moondog,2010-03-06 19:04:00,362,"Go to ........http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety...sitor-1610.htm and scroll down to..... The Regulations apply to non-residents: * If they operate their pleasure craft in Canadian waters for more than 45 consecutive days or, * If they operate a pleasure craft that is licensed or registered in Canada (including rented or chartered boats). * The Regulations do not apply to non-residents who operate their pleasure craft in Canadian waters for less than 45 consecutive days. Please note that a proof of residence will be required on board at all times. Acceptable Proof of Competency for Non-Residents For non-residents, proof of competency can take one of three forms: * A Canadian-issued pleasure craft operator card. * A completed boat rental safety check-list (for power-driven rental boats). * An operator card or equivalent that meets the requirements of their state or country. So yes when they say 45 days that is going to be up for interpretation hence my argument that, as always, it is going to be up to the OPP or MNR to make a judgment. If you leave your boat in Canada but are only there 4 weeks.......is it going to be $250, hope you don't get caught or just get the dang card. I am going to err on the side of getting the stupid card and be done with it."
1175435,Flip Silverlake,2010-03-07 12:23:00,645,"If there is a discussion how long a non-resident is in Canada, all they have to do is to go to any customs point and run you on the computer. All the info they need is there, right down to the minute you crossed over. So make sure you get the check list form the guy you rented it from or if you'r going to be there for more than 45 days and run your own rig get a card from your home state DNR. Very simple!"
1175455,Dacotah Eye,2010-03-07 13:42:00,2722,I got the certificate from my home state. I figure it won't be long before most states will require them and you may get a discount from your insurance provider.
1178899,Kevin R,2010-03-17 05:59:00,305,Must be for local/ residents. The resorts must have been given the 45 days so it would not effect them.
1178994,Moondog,2010-03-17 10:19:00,362,What is your source on this statement?
1179019,Rgate,2010-03-17 11:42:00,14,I posted a link to a Canada Government site with info on the boating cards on the Buena Vista Walleye Club Facebook page. The link is http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gi...1574355&ref=mf and you find the link in the entry with the big red maple leaf.
1179035,Moondog,2010-03-17 12:40:00,362,"Yes, we have seen the link but trying to find out why Kevin R. would say...... 'Must be for local/ residents. The resorts must have been given the 45 days so it would not effect them.' Because this is just not true. I have no knowledge of what Kevin R. states when he says resorts are not affected. This is contrary to what has been posted and to the link that Rgate has provided. Just wondering where Kevin R. got this bad info."
1180517,Kevin R,2010-03-22 06:08:00,305,"Think about it why not for all, why 45 days ? Do you forget how to run a boat after 45 days ?"
1169513,DanM57,2010-02-16 14:41:00,135,"I have heard that it became a law last Sept that to run a rented boat or a camp boat in Ontario you have to have this card. Does anybody know anything about the Canada Pleasure Craft Operators Card? If you have to have it, where do you get it?It would take all of the fun out of our annual Canadian trip if couldn't use a boat.......Thanks for the info."
1169529,Topwater,2010-02-16 15:13:00,484,You don't need it when your renting a boat. You just need to fill out a checklist when your renting your boat.
1169647,bpetersen,2010-02-16 21:29:00,251,Search this thread topic. (boat safety card )
1169650,Outfitter17,2010-02-16 21:48:00,127,You just need to do the boater check list with the camp operator when you get to camp or if you are bringing you own boat - you don't need one unless you are in canada more than 45 days.
1173496,JinxCanada,2010-03-01 22:05:00,1306,"this is why the boaters card (not a licence btw) is such bull****! i can rent my boat to my buddy for $1.00 and he doesn't need a card, you can come to my country and rent a boat or bring your own and YOU don't need a card, but **** I NEED ONE??? wtf man. such a f'ing cash grab makes me sick.10 million boaters at $50.00 a pop and just where is that money going? i'll tell ya the people who actually DO need a licence, and sorry to offend, are the idiot americans who come here get drunk drive their boats at 65mph in 2 fow and then crash....killing themselves, others, and costing us millions of $$$ to rescue their asses. just makes me sick..and i refuse to get one...as do most canadian boaters."
1173528,rebs,2010-03-02 05:51:00,7587,"whoaa wait a minute, are you saying Americans are idiots ? I guess you don't have any idiots in canada eh ? I think you have a few idiots that are requiring you to pay 50.00 a pop for that card eh ?put the blame where it belongs, with your own greedy government, they are the ones who want you to pay, not the americans eh ? NYS fishing license has tripled in cost in just one year, new fee's, new surcharges etc. a lot of creative ways to get more money out of the citizens.we have our own greedy government to contend with as well as you contending with your's ! If you are so upset with your new boater's card requirement then complain to your government, don't blame americans for your governments greed eh ?"
1173554,stardaddyed,2010-03-02 06:53:00,20,"I have to agree with you Jinx and I am one of those idiot Americans! I have some (but not a lot) experience in a boat and when I come up this summer I will be renting a boat. No training, no experience, nothing required. I have no idea if the rules are the same in CA as the US. To me it is not about the money, I am already dropping some cash to come there, so 50 bucks is really inconsequential, the real problem is the safety. I also agree that it is a money grab. If it was safety they would do what some of the states do down here. In Missouri if you were born after a certain date you have to take an online class and pass a test to be able to operate ANY watercraft. Last year my kids were 15 and wanted to ride jet skies. They had to take the class and pass the test. Took them a couple of times to pass. The fee was pretty small ($35) and I made them pay it themselves. They understood the rules and there was no excuses. I still had to train them on the actual operation but they understood what the deal was. The key is we are not from Missouri and the rule applied to everyone.As far as the calling Americans idiots...one hockey game and north of the border goes crazy! Just kidding of course!"
1174001,PIKEMAN330,2010-03-03 09:06:00,101,"Calm down Jinxy. I cant get my 6 hp. rental boat to do 150mph? But to be honest Ialso hate idiots,American or Canadain doing 70mph when I am trying to fish. Good fishing Pikeman"
1175144,JinxCanada,2010-03-06 14:40:00,1306,"sorry to offend, not saying ALL americans are idiots of course...but there seem to be a lot of them showing up around here in lake erie and on the detroit river....and yes of course we have them too..."
1175169,Moondog,2010-03-06 16:25:00,362,"Let's keep it simple....... If you rent a boat or bring your own boat to Canada from outside of Canada and stay less than 45 days.....you are covered. Part Two: If you bring your own boat to Canada and stay or boat 45 or more days that's when it gets sticky. Can they prove that you boated 45 consecutive days? Is Donnie Maw, Ontario MNR going to count? I will have the card when I go to Ontario since I may stay 42 days or I may stay 49. Doubtful that I will be able to fish everyday but I play by the rules when in some one elses backyard. Right or Wrong. Unfair? No Whining....I don't think Canada can hold a stick to what our current administration has done to us this year in the way of ridiculous ways for government to take our money. I am just happy that I can go to Canada and fish their wonderful fisheries. Moondog"
