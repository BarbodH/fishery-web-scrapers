Owner Bullet Type-Z Ultra Head jigs (3 per pack)Eppinger Dardevle 1 oz. 5 of Diamonds spoon (w/ brass back)This is pretty much the extent of what I have used in the past amongst our groups. Rig your grubs tail down as you get significant action on the drop.I ALWAYS have 1 rod rigged w/ an 1/8 oz. Owner Bullet Type-Z Ultra Head jig and a 5"" white Gary Yamamoto grub. This, I'll fish with and when I'm not fishing it and I get a bite-off, the next lure they see is this slow moving, lurching, dying white grub. I'm also using 20# fluorocarbon. I've picked up some nice, larger Walleye and 40"" class Pike on more occasions w/ this rig than any other I've used in Canada. I've been fishing in Quebec since 1989.We've also used Red Eye Wigglers, Storm Thin Fins, Cotton Cordell Ripplin' Redfins, Johnson Silver Minnows (both Silver and Black), Radtke Pike minnows, Storm Thundersticks, Helin Flatfish, Veltic spinners, Canadian Wigglers and various grubs between 2""-6"" (you pick the color) w/ certain degrees of success @ certain times.I've fished w/ many different spoons but for whatever the reason, the 5 of Diamonds seems to be the ticket. The Len Thompson 5 of Diamonds works well but our groups have always felt the Eppinger catches more fish. I've casted, trolled and jigged it and have caught Walleye and nice Pike (and Lake Trout, White Fish & suckers). It use to surprise me what I would catch on it but it doesn't anymore. Amazing lure.Good luck and have a great time on your trip. Would love to see some pictures if you get a chance and read some stories. Best."

Most times, pike like a small twister tail tip added.I always take a chest full of every kind of lures ,but end up using these spoons.Other lures we do use however are the Red Eyes,Daredevils,and 206 and 207 Crane crank baits.Large Pike also seem to like baits that suspend.Our week there we had good weather and no bugs.The fishing was Ok for Pike,probably better for Walleye. Good fishing; Pikeman"

Jigs with either live leaches or Gulp Alive minnows kept us satisfied with the walleye. We caught a couple on Storm Hot-N-Tots but didn't troll very much. As for pike, we didn't knock them dead and didn't target them much. When we did, 5"" Kalin's Mombo (sp?) grubs in white worked real well. Also, trolling a large 6 inch swimbait on a 3/4 oz. jig was real hot. Had the biggest walleye of the trip on this bait as well but lost it. Tried to fish spinnerbaits one afternoon and couldn't even get a follow. Chris"
