1296622,wallydave,2011-04-19 06:56:00,2151,"Fishman10, which lake are you reporting on? Now that spring at least according to the calendar,is here, we are all patiently waiting(?) for ice-out reports on our favorite lakes! I still have to wait until June before we head North, but tracking the weather, ice and lake levels seem to help with the wait!"
