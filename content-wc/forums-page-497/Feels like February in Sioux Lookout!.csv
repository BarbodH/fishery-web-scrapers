By the looks of the forecast, spring will be gradually welcomed from here. I would expect the smaller lakes, which consist of mostly white ice, to be open water by May 1st. Lac Seul and Minnitaki by mid month. There is still 3 feet of ice out there, it has lifted and drain holes are present, but now frozen over again. The females were stuffed full of eggs, and the males were silting everywhere on the last week of ice fishing. Walleyes will have a great spawn with the higher water levels this season. Hopefully they will get their business done by opener May 21st. By the results of the nitro ice fishing we had this winter, the population is massive and the there are many big fish to be had! The result of the slot, and this age of conservation minded angler's continues to overwhelm me with how great the fishing keeps improving up here! I am about to enter the busiest open water season that I have ever had, and I wish great fishing to all of you that love it up here as much as I do! Come on Mother nature...throw us some heat! Here's a link to a recent WFN blog report that I was featured in by Gord Pyzer.....http://www.worldfishingnetwork.com/u...yes-91378.aspx"

Re: Weather - my group typically goes up the last week in June --- one year, snowmobile suits weren't enough to keep us warm - another year it was 100 and you couldn't find a fan OR ice cubes in Sioux Lookout - we had to go down to Dryden !!"
