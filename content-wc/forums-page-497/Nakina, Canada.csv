1286049,pike usa,2011-03-23 18:19:00,15,"Hello everyone. I will be in Nakina in a couple months and had several questions. This is my first fly in trip and I'm really excited about the adventure. I am going with a bunch of veterans so that helps out a lot. I'm sure there are several forums already with information and I will read but I have a few questions...What are the four best lures for Northern Pike and Eyes?Are certain color lures used during rain, snow or when water is different color?What is the weather usually like in early June throughout the day?How many fish do you usually catch from experience? How many hrs in a day do you usually fish?What is your largest Pike & Walleye caught in the Canadian area?Tips and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.. More info the better on HOW to catch these awesome fish and be specific if you would..I've fished over the years but have never fished in the Canadian waters for Pike and I would love to know the techniques to catch em'..... https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...c/progress.gif"
1286073,Curryale,2011-03-23 19:34:00,50,First question would be what lake are you headed to? Its likely that people on the board have fished it before andcan give some specific advice. For walleye at that time of the year it is my experience that they are generally shallow. If you are in a lake look for where they would spawn and focus on those areas. A lot of the time in less then 5 feet of water. Really all you need is a box of jigs. Tip them with live bait or gulp minnows and you should do very well. 1/8 to 3/8 should do. Bring lots of jigs you may lose a lot. Colour to me doesnt matter much but if I had to pick I like Gold and Orange. If they have gone a bit deeper then bottom bouncers and crawlers are often the ticket. If its hot this spring look in 18 - 25 feet of water and where the wind blows.As far as crankbaits go I would suggest a Ripplin Redfin (gold) or Thinfin (orange). For some reason those are the ones that work for me the best in Nakina.Weather can be unpredictable. Bring warm clothing. Good rain wear. The water is generally tea stained. We usually fish 10-12 hours a day.For Walleye it is often more of a numbers game then a size game. Depending on the lake you could get from 30 throught 50 walleye a day. Most of the trips I have been on someone gets one 26-30 inches. Largest I have caught was 31. As far as Pike go we dont target them too much. They sure love those Ripplin Redfins but they also like larger Panther Martin Spinners and spoons. Largest I have seen is 44 inches from the Nakina area.The Pike may still be shallow when you go. The large fish move deep in the summer and can be harder to catch. Hope it helps.
1286097,tly,2011-03-23 20:15:00,1900,"My preference has been floating jigs with a 4' snell. But that early in the year 1/8 lead head tipped with minnow is good. For both walleye & pike I have used almost forever a Little Cleo in maroon & copper. Generally 1/2 oz. Good for casting, vertical jigging and you can easily control depth by your retrieval speed. For pike I go to a full 1 oz and catch eye's also. Another one A like is the mimic minnow. Generally in shad. Perch looks nice but have nor done as well. In any case enjoy the experience, not everyone is so lucky or appreciates the opportunity."
1286167,Jack77,2011-03-24 06:23:00,168,"What are the four best lures for Northern Pike and Eyes?I am not sure what the top 4 are however we have the most walleye by vertically jigging tipped with a grub or minnow or both at the same time. We have caught most of our pike by casting or trolling crank baits. The pike should still be shallow in early June so an original rapala should do well.Are certain color lures used during rain, snow or when water is different color? Best luck using white, red, pink, and chartreuse for walleye and bright colored crank baits for pike no matter what the weather was like.What is the weather usually like in early June throughout the day? Here is a link to the weather in Nakina - http://text.http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/forec...l?on-97&unit=m.You will notice that there is a link at the left of the page that says ""Historical weather"" this link will actually let you see the hour by hour weather info for any day of the year. You have to select Geraldaton but that is close enough. How many fish do you usually catch from experience? How many hrs in a day do you usually fish?Catching a 100 fish a day is pretty common. It would depend on the day but we always try to remember that we are on vacation and not to make fishing our ""jobs"" that week. My guess is that we spend about 8 - 10 hours a day on the water. we have a shore lunch everyday so that takes up some time also. What is your largest Pike & Walleye caught in the Canadian area?The walleye are pretty numerous but not all that big. The average fish is probably 15""-17"". we have caught a few at 25"". We have caught a few pike at 40+"".Tips and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.. More info the better on HOW to catch these awesome fish and be specific if you would..Listen to your outfitter, they will tell you where to go and what to use. I can't really be specific if I don't where you are going to be. We pretty much spend our day jigging, trolling, and maybe some casting. Bring lots of beer and have fun."
1286179,dosxx,2011-03-24 06:39:00,60,"Rattle Traps and Rattle Trap style lures, also known as lipless crankbaits, have been awesome for pike with our group over the years. Usually some combination of black/silver, blue silver, green silver in a half to three quarter ounce size. They are easy to use (cast and reel), cast a long ways, can be fished shallow or deep, trolled down to around 10 feet and they will sometimes catch walleye. The Bill Lewis brand is still relatively cheap. I still have one from my first trip to Canada with all of the paint peeled off from the pike.As to walleye, a 3 inch curly tail or sassy shad type bait (color is your choice, but I like the Blue Pearlescent from Kalin's grubs) and a 1/4 or 1/8 oz jig depending on wind/depth is always our go to bait. I second the ""bring lots of jigs comments""-- you will lose your share.My buddies all fish 6 to 8 pound mono, but I am a braid fan with a fluorocarbon 5 ft leader. In the stained water, I don't think the leader matters though-- just a habit. For pike I have been fine with 12 pound mono but tried a fifty pound braid last year. The pike will cut it all if they get it right-- I don't like wire leaders, but they are very helpful in targeting pike specifically.Our group usually fishes 8-10 hours a day, and have had 100 plus fish days (mostly walleye) in the Nakina area-- there are always some big ones caught, but it is often numbers, not size. We do the conservation license and release the big ones.I am guessing your veterans will have graphs. We usually go later in the year, and a graph is key to getting accurate depths and finding irregularities on the bottom. Find an irregularity, like a spot of 8-10 feet surrounded by, say 20 feet of water, and I will bet you will find walleye. As far as weather, watch the forecast, but don't count on it and prepare for the best/worst of weather within a few hours of each other. Michigan is famous for ""if you don't like the weather wait a bit and it will change"" but I have never seen weather change as quickly as it has while I have been in Canada. Enjoy your trip!"
1287858,mbay1455,2011-03-28 08:16:00,25,"Pooch, your post here and in the ""take your wife to Canada"" thread had me going 'Amen brother'. I've been going to Ontario (Nakina area) for over 30 years now. First trip was with my wife and her family who had been going for years before that. I had no idea what to do and had all the wrong equipment. It didn't matter, still had a great time. Fortunately my mother-in-law was one of those 'kitchen sink in her purse' kind of people. Even had extra raingear when my wimpy raingear didn't hold up. We still fish a lot but our trips are really about the overall experience. Sometimes we just beach the boat and take it all in for a while.Pike USA, be careful you don't get caught up in 'beating the water' from sun-up to sun-down and end up missing an awesome opportunity to let yourself relax and take it all in."
1287861,Mohleye,2011-03-28 08:18:00,368,"My first trip was as a fill in with a group of veterans, too. They are really the ones you will want to ask as far as what types of tackle to bring, as they probably have their own preferred methods of fishing. Some people like to try many different techniques, others may spend the whole week fishings jigs and minnows. There is no point in buying a box full of crankbaits if your crew spends all their time jigging. I'd say the #1 thing you need to bring is decent raingear. Doesn't have to be super-expensive but it does have to be waterproof. I learned this the hard way. I'd bring clothes that you can wear in layers, as the temps can take some big swings, even in the same day. You will have a great time. Your statement about pitching in with the chores will be much appreciated by your group and get you a return invite."
1287880,oleJoe,2011-03-28 08:50:00,114,We will coming out of LakeMelchett on the 3rd of June. A group with a gentleman fron Ohio and his son are coming in the and we are going to leave a marked map of where they are at that time. You will not have any trouble catching fish. In the neighborhood of 50 fish a day and not fishing hard. Try not fishing all the daylight hrs. Dusk is 10 to 10:30. It sure makes for short nights. Melchett is an easy lake to fish and a couple of times up and down and you won't get lost. PM me if you have any questions about the lake. We havce fished it 5 or 6 times now.
1288653,GOBIG,2011-03-30 03:52:00,126,"I WILL BE FOLLOWING YOU UP ON MELCHETT. PLEASE MARK ALL THE AREAS. WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO CATCHING A LOT OF FISH, DAVE HAS TALKED VERY HIGHLY OF THIS LAKE. THE OWNERS SEEM GREAT. CAN NOT WAIT TO MEET YOU AND DAVE. SEE YOU SOON."
1291801,pike usa,2011-04-06 19:08:00,15,"I know the two main fish at Melchett are Northern Pike and Walleye. Any other fish in this lake? Does anyone try to fish for perch or white fish or is this a waste of time?I am looking forward to the peaceful Canadian experience. Don't get my wrong I love my computer, cell phone and tv but I can't wait to put them down for a week and live life like the good ole' days....take care my friends."
1297388,oleJoe,2011-04-20 16:32:00,114,We have caught a couple of perch in the Kap river and i think 1 whitefish. Walleyes and pike are it. Or bring your cell phone and try to get reception. That will take up all your time. LOL
1297518,GOBIG,2011-04-21 03:24:00,126,"I DO NOT KNOW WHY YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT FISH ARE THERE, DO YOU EVEN HAVE GOOD LURES, OR JUST SOME JUNK THE VETS HAVE TOLD YOU TO BUY. YOU MIGHT BE BETTER BEING THE CABIN MAID FOR THE WEEK."
1297703,pike usa,2011-04-21 13:15:00,15,"gobig, son i told you its also about location, location, location... If the vets are going to steer me the wrong way so be it... I probably need to get a few more hot n tots and i am good to go..Or I can just borrow from a loser that takes all of his dads lures... Can you believe that? I mean, buy your own."
1297734,GOBIG,2011-04-21 14:41:00,126,"YOU HAVE GOT TO BE SNEAKY TO GET THOSE LURES. OH, ARE WE GONNA HAVE SOME FUN"
1287107,oleJoe,2011-03-26 06:44:00,114,"We usually go the first of June and just use jigs and twister tails. 3inch chartruse, white,pink etc. 1/4 or 3/8 jig. When trolling for eyes its jointed rebel minnow baits and hot and tots for a little deeper.all the fishing is between 5 and 30 ft deep but mostly 5 to 12. Pike lures are johnson silver minnows in gold and silver. 5/8 oz . spinnerbaits and always take a couple of buzz baits just for the fun of seeing them smash it. The water is tea colored and usually in the hi 50's.ALWAYS pack for cold and wet. Good rain suit a must. Don't over pack . Its never a fashion show. Lots of waleyes in the 16 to 23 inch sizeand for us a 25"" is big. As far as pike we usually get one over 40"" for our group of 6. Most 28 to 38"" and they can be very shallow in the bays with dead reeds. We usually fish 10 hrs now but you will need 2 weeks of vacation is your going to fish all the daylight hrs. One week to rest up after your vacation. There is nothing like it. Enjoy it all."
1287236,adempsey,2011-03-26 12:05:00,963,"First, I am sure you don't need to worry too much about how to fish, but where. Regardless, I don't think the fishing will be that challenging for you at all as long as you fish in the right spots.IMO Pike - Johnson's Silver Minnow with 5"" white grub, Lucky Strike Red Flash Eppinger Red Eye Wiggler, Williams Whitefish Spoon, White Spinnerbait, Suick Thriller - there are plenty of other spoons that would work great too Walleye - crawler harness with half a crawler on a Bottom bouncer,crawler on a Lindy rig, 1/8oz jig with 3""/4"" grub (white, pink, chartreuse, purple), slow death hook with a Gulp Fry or half a crawler, Storm Hot'n'Tot, Rapala Shad RapQuote:Are certain color lures used during rain, snow or when water is different color?I heard all types of suggestions that often contradict one another. When I buy a crankbait I always buy the same model in three colors - firetiger or perch [if it's bright], [shiny] silver or gold and a neutral more natural color like shad. Regardless of weather, I start with firetiger/perch and will switch if that doesn't produce [or if my boat mates catch a few before I catch one].Quote:What is the weather usually like in early June throughout the day?It will vary. One week it could be 75-80 but another 50-70. I'd be prepared for both, but that doesn't mean you need to bring tons of clothing. Can be buggy and rainy too. It's not really consistent.Quote:How many fish do you usually catch from experience? How many hrs in a day do you usually fish?10 to 50+ per day per person, on the water 10-12 hours per dayQuote:What is your largest Pike & Walleye caught in the Canadian area?28"" walleye and 36"" pikeQuote:Tips and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.. More info the better on HOW to catch these awesome fish and be specific if you would..Where to fish and when to fish it is more important than how. The resort owner/guide is often the best person to ask since they will have up to date information on where the fish are located at the time of year that you are there.Have a great trip!"
1287710,pike usa,2011-03-27 19:03:00,15,"I cannot believe the response I got on all of these questions and thank you everyone for the answers..My group is staying in lake melchett. This is our first time to this lake and my first overall experience. They fish the entire day except for lunch because we have some guys that like to eat especially the two big boys. hahahahahaI am just thankful that I have the funds and friends that invited me on this special trip. I think its special because I am going to a place on earth that many people do not get to visit. A place where many humans don't see and I cannot wait until the experience. We are nearly two months away and it will be something special.Thanks again to everyone and I appreciate all the info that is provided.. I might not catch the most fish but I won't dissapoint my crew because there will be many chores that i can step in and help.. Don't get me wrong though, I will relax, enjoy the experience from the great nature of Canada. I can't wait!"
1287829,GOBIG,2011-03-28 06:32:00,126,"YOU WILL HAVE NOTHING BETTER. TRIPS WITH THE WIFE,KIDS, AND PARENTS ARE ALL GOOD, HOWEVER, THE TRIP WITH THE GUYS WITH NO PHONES, COMPUTERS OR YELLING IS THE BEST. ONCE YOU GO, YOU WILL HAVE TO GO EVERY YEAR. ARE YOU TAKING ENOUGH BEER, EAR PLUGS FOR THE CHAINSAWS AT NIGHT, AND ENOUGH FOOD FOR THE BIG BOYS?"
1287834,Pooch,2011-03-28 07:05:00,4619,"I was a fill in on my first trip to Canada with a group from our fire station. None of us had ever been to Canada to fish. Knew absolutely nothing about fishing ""up there"". Old gear, old line, no lures or jigs to speak of, no real rain suit, no boots, etc.. Went in mid July and about froze to death! Duct taped rain suit together on day two. Tennis shoes were wet and stunk so bad I left them outside at night. One guy left his sleeping bag in the truck at the flyout so I shared one of my two blankets with him and we then both froze during the nights.Caught very few fish, but had a lot of fun together. Came home and told my wife ""never again!"". Never say never as we've been going back for at least three or four trips a year since. Over the next winter I read everything I could get my hands on relating to Canada and just ""figured it out"". Now spending at least a month a year fishing those great waters. Listen to what these guys on WC are telling you. Some of them contradict each other as we all have had different but similar experiences. Get the basics dialed in before departing. You don't need a ton or gear, but there are a few items that you just need for day in and day out fishing.Continue doing it right by seeking out information long before going. I wish this forum was around back then.You're gonna have a blast. Don't think the fish are just gonna jump into the boat 'cause they won't. You have to expend some effort and thought to make that happen. That's what makes it interesting. Don't make it work. Put your pole down on occasion and just soak it all in. The Pine and Cedar smells, the quietness of birds, scattered wildlife. Stare at the clear night sky in pure wonder. Enjoy and soak up the memories. When your old and many of your fishing buddies are long gone, these memories and pictures are beyond valuable.Pooch"
