1289128,Fisherman1792,2011-03-31 06:26:00,927,"I live about 70 miles from White River and I do believe the Huskey is open 24 hours, but your going to pay through the nose. White River has the most expensive gas and diesel anywhere. If your traveling west, your better off stoping in Marathon to fill up, cheaper for sure and there is a gas station that is sells gas 24 hours (SP&G).Fisherman 1792"
1289253,"6'3""",2011-03-31 12:41:00,47,Thank you We go north to Hornepayne at White River and it doesn't get any cheaper there
1289375,Stehle1,2011-03-31 19:24:00,22,"I've gotten gas at that Husky before. It's about the only game in town. Wawa has some gas stations which may be cheaper but they are off 17. This year I plan to fuel up in Sault Ste Marie MICHIGAN, then White River, but I should be able to get all the way to Hornepayne and back to Michigan on that tank. $5.00 gas in US will be $6.00 in Canada, but hope to minimize expensive gass to only 20 gallons or so."
1289470,Fisherman1792,2011-04-01 06:01:00,927,"Hey guy'sI am not sure if you can bring extra gas from the states, but if you can't, bring some extra gas cans and fill them up in Sault St, Marie Ontario before heading up to Horneypane. With the way oil is going and the gas prices, you may be paying $1.50 per liter by summer up there.Diesel right now here in Marathon is $1.30 per liter. White River and Hornpane is more expensive. Even top off in Wawa, it is only five minutes off the highway. You will save yourself a bundle. Wawa has a 24hr station called SP&G.Fisherman 1792"
1296882,Fisherman1792,2011-04-19 16:50:00,927,"Just drove through White River and the gas prices OUCH!!!!Fill everything up before you get to White River, Price $1.44/L.I am in Timmins Ont, right now and the gas prices are $1.42/L. Surpisingly, diesel here in Timmins is much cheaper $1.29/L than in Marathon $1.34/L Gas in Marathon was $1.37/L.Fisherman 1792"
1296908,Mike Borger,2011-04-19 18:00:00,1554,Unless things have changed that Husky is not open 24 hours.
1296993,tackleman,2011-04-19 20:18:00,444,"I was through white river a couple times last year and to me everything is expensive, it feel like they know they have you over a barrel and charge whatever they feel the market will bear."
1297070,teddi,2011-04-20 04:49:00,349,white river must be just like red lake. they can and do charge you what ever they want.
