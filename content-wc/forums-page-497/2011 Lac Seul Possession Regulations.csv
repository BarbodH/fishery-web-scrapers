1298036,JDP,2011-04-22 09:39:00,1457,Live fish cost a friend of mine $200 due to carelessness on his part.He had 2 walleyes in a livewell with <1 inch water that were still alive when a CO checked as he beached for shorelunch.
1298043,wallydave,2011-04-22 09:59:00,2151,"This type of thread was going around last year, if memory serves me correctly. One of the tips from that thread, to kill your keepers by holding the fish down and pull the head back until the spine breaks. Others use a piece of firewood or broken oar to dispatch your lunch. I have seen clubs for sale at area tackle shops too!"
1298077,cuamb,2011-04-22 11:13:00,203,That rule has been in place for many years. It is not too big of a deal as the fishing is usually so good you don't need to keep any until the end of the day. We go early June and the water temp is usually still pretty cool. We pull the plug on the livewell and let the water flow in and out on the dead eyes. By taking them late in the day we don't have any problems.
1298092,midwest,2011-04-22 11:46:00,25,"I just kill them, put them on a stringer, and back into the water. I've never had a problem with fish spoiling, but I'm always there early in the season. I can see the need for a cooler during the summertime.They would still need to be on a stringer or seperate coolers though if there are multiple people in the boat."
1298273,rnnonmt,2011-04-22 21:10:00,992,"Good idea, We go in early June as well. I guess clubbin the eyes and putting on the stringer in 50 degree water isn't so bad. Just dont forget to pull them back in when you are ready for wide open throttle. OOOH, look some skiers!"
1298319,midwest,2011-04-23 06:17:00,25,"Yep, we've forgot to put them in the boat before! Walleyes are easy to kill, just push their head back over there body and they almost snap in two. Pike are a little tougher."
1298557,bigwalleye1,2011-04-23 20:00:00,2632,"Those little giveaway ash baseball bats are perfect medicine for shore lunch walleye. One smart rap to the top of the head behind the eyes and it's lights out. We keep only shore lunch fish until the last day, have eggs and bacon for lunch and catch our go-home fish on the last day. I've only had a livewell full of ice not make the whole day once or twice in July, and even then, there's water there with ice and it's plenty cold, so I wouldn't that stop you from trying. Some camps offer free ice, so we ice one livewell in my Pro-V for fish, one baitwell as a cooler, and then use the smaller rear livewell and the rear baitwell as a giant cool water reciculator to keep the minnows happy all day."
1298676,midwest,2011-04-24 07:48:00,25,"We used to smash in the heads on our walleye. Got stopped by the conservation officer one day and he did not like that approach. He showed us how to snap their heads back over their back. I really don't like that approach because it makes it hard to measure a fish that is close to the slot...but he is the boss, so that is what we do now."
1297884,rnnonmt,2011-04-21 21:57:00,992,"Hi All,Been doing a lot of reading on the Ontario MNR fishing possession/catch/release regulations. The ""basic"" Ontario regs state that fish can be kept alive in a live well atleast 10 gallons with circulation capability etc etc.... However, Lac Seul (Zone 4) regulations are slightly different stating ""Lac seul, including Broad, Sunlight, Root River, Vaughan, Lost Lakes, and Wenesaga River from the first river upstream Lac Seul approx 3km downstream to the last group of islands No person may possess any live fish taken by angling other than bait fish."" So the question arises.... Is ALL of Lac Seul regulated to possession of dead fish only and my live well could now be considered a dead well?? Take a kid fishing you wont be disappointed."
1297885,KTroller,2011-04-21 22:05:00,237,Yes. Lac Seul Regulations require that you either release fish immediately or kill them (if possession is allowed) and put them into your possession limit. Your livewell is a deadwell (or dead cooler and are smart and fill it with ice for long days on the water).KT
1297944,rather-be-fishin,2011-04-22 06:51:00,429,On Lac Suel it works best to bring a cooler with ice in your boat for your fish. The ice doesn't always last in your live/dead well. This system works & that's why walleye fishing on Lac Suel is so awesome!
1297947,wallydave,2011-04-22 07:01:00,2151,"I know Goose Bay Camp includes a cooler and block ice for each boat, I would imagine most outfitters on LS would offer the same. The upgrade boats at GBC have livewells, a good place to store rain gear, or to keep bottled water."
1297960,scgibby11,2011-04-22 07:18:00,109,Turn the livewell into a minnow livewell.
1297963,tv4fish,2011-04-22 07:26:00,2694,"As was stated, I would guess most resorts also provide either a block of ice or a frozen gallon jug or something similar for their guests that fish Lac Seul (Red Pine Lodge does). My group also uses a well insulated cooler to keep our fish in. We have taken a black ""Magic Marker"" and drawn lines on the top of our fish cooler to show the 18""-21"" slot limit. When we catch a fish that looks close - we just stretch it out on the cooler top - if it's legal (ya, we make SURE if it's close ) and we want to keep it, it goes in the cooler - if not, it goes right back in the water."
1297971,rnnonmt,2011-04-22 07:34:00,992,Thanks for the answers and input. Looks like I will have another thing to trip over in the boat.

1298000,jswinter40,2011-04-22 08:31:00,127,what works really well for us is to put a soft sided cooler in the livewell and fill with ice and put fish in it. it eliminates another cooler on the deck of the boat and ice keeps better.
1298015,rdbalmer,2011-04-22 08:50:00,279,"That is a good idea. Never even considered that option. We always bleed our fish out in the live well and then place them in a plastic bag and put in a cooler full of ice. We never had issues with poor quality fillets... as a matter of fact I think they were better. The law was designed to eliminate livewell sorting and like another poster stated, it works. Don't get caught with live fish on Lac Seul! It will cost you."
