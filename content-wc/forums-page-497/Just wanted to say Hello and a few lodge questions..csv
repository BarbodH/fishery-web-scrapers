1294367,CanadianFisherman,2011-04-13 18:09:00,2,"Hello Everyone,I'll try to keep this short. I've been lurking this forum for a couple of weeks now and couldn't resist to finally join .. you guys have a great and very well run site! I fish all year around in mostly Southern Ontario for pretty much all game fish. By far my favourite are targeting walleye on the Bay of Quinte and Salmon in Lake Ontario and Rivers.My question was about Lac Seul but more specifically about Silver Water Wheel Lodge. I'm just trying to get a feel of the Lodge...accommodations, guest service, owners, guides, food, customer service, etc. I've read all the previous topic related to the lodge on this site.. Was wondering if anyone can give me their latest insight of how the lodge is and what would be expected. Does anyone here have a trip booked there this year? and last but not least how is the weather and Insects throughout May to September? Never been up that far north. ..I was going to ask what would be needed to pack on a trip but the fishing list by pike usa was more then excellent in answering that lingering question in the back of my mind... Thank you for your time in advance.CanadianFisherman"
1294487,Jigger1,2011-04-13 23:47:00,234,"Canadian Fisherman  I will first qualify that I'm 100% biased and have totally bought into the SWWL approach, in late June this will be my 12th consecutive year and my 14th trip to SWWL. In 1999 I spent the better part of a year investigating lodges as I planning to take my daughter on a father/daughter trip. My specific target was Lac Seul. After doing my research I settled on SWWL for one reason, the response I got back from the lodge owner Mike Willems. It was unlike any I got back from any other resort, it was spot on and it was clear they executed a top notch conservationist based fishing approach with a true focus on trophy walleye fishing as compared to other lodges and I've never looked back. I grew up fishing and had fished Lake of the Woods and Eagle Lake several times, both which are great fisheries and caught lots of walleyes but never a hog. And while I've yet to break into the 30 club I've become so spoiled and have caught more walleyes over 27 than I ever would have thought possible in my lifetime, my current largest is 29.25 caught while fishing with Mike. My biggest pike caught last year is a 40 caught jigging for walleyes. The difference is the focus this team employs, with my experience on the lake I feel confident I could do very well without a guide; however I still choose not to. I have really grown into enjoying the fact that my only worry while at SWWL is to catch fish. With the guide system Mike employs, I know they're going to put me on fish and I know they're increasing my odds every moment to catch my fish of a lifetime. See at SWWL I don't spend a lot of time fishing for 16 - 18 walleyes, they know I'm there to focus on and catch 27+ walleyes for my 5 or 6 days on the water. Instead of worrying about boat control, I'm making sure I'm in contact with the bottom and doing everything possible to catch a hog. I could go on and on so I'll stop. Drop Mike a line, go visit their website and see if you get hooked like I did. Everything from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave is top shelf. By the way to answer your other question, I've fished primarily in late June/early July. I've made one trip in early June, another in mid July and one in late August. Bugs have never really been an issue while on the water, however go for a walk in the woods and it's another issue. Regarding the weather it's NW Ontario, let's see what it does tomorrow would be the best thing to say. Best of luck in your investigation and good fishing. Some year I'm headed to Bay of Quinte in late October/November, but SWWL will remain my summer destination for years to come. Jigger 1"
1295158,Mike Kansas,2011-04-15 13:43:00,1463,"Canadian Fisherman....We have fished at SWWL on several occasions and they do a very nice job with all aspects of being their guests. Keep in mind that Lac Seul is an awesome Walleye fishery and has a diverse structure base and during my 25 years of fishing Lac Seul we have seen many days of 75+ Walleye per man and lots of 22"" to 28"" fish. There are many great resorts on Lac Seul and you will find great fishing at all of them. I suggest you review your options and don't jump on the first horse you see. Look At: Lost Island Lodge; Great place and excellent guides. Lac Seul Lodge: Great Place ..No Guide Service Evergreen: Great Place and Guide Service I would GOOGLE Lac Seul Resorts and check these and many others out. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1295577,CanadianFisherman,2011-04-16 12:59:00,2,"Thank you both Jigger1 and Mike Kansas for your great responses. Out of curiousity, I've noticed everyone on this site uses measurement when comparing fish.. Is there a reason for this? Although I do measure my big fish also. We usually use weight when comparing fish on the bay of quinte, etc. Jigger1, if you ever need any help or information on Bay of Quinte don't hesitate to PM me. Thanks again, CanadianFisherman"
