1295622,tlee,2011-04-16 15:28:00,65,Im looking for any information you might have on fishing / places to stay at La Ronge. I'm planning a trip for there sometime between the end of May and beginning of July.
1295676,Wickerman,2011-04-16 18:12:00,119,Do you want to stay on lake or in Town?Have you fished there before? This would certainly not be my first choice of lake in Northern Saskatchewan. Pickerall Bay can be good for Walleye if you time it right and you can catch nice Trout in other parts of lake but other lakes I think have more to offer the angler.
1295737,tlee,2011-04-16 20:59:00,65,"I'm looking for a ""Northern Canada Experience"" where we can catch walleyes. I guess if La Ronge isn't the place....where would you suggest?"
1295863,Wickerman,2011-04-17 08:41:00,119,"I would suggest Besnard, Jan, Dechambault, or if you want to go a little further North, Missinippi.All smaller lakes than La Ronge but usually good early season Walleye lakes."
1296154,tlee,2011-04-17 21:31:00,65,I fished Besnard the middle of last June. We caught a few hundred 4lb northerns but the walleye fishing stunk. I'm looking into Jan and Dechambault.........Anyone else have suggestions?

Early in the year there is a small lake where the walleyes spawn - the fishing can be phenominal in that lake & in the cuts leading to the main lake. They have lake trout & pike too. I haven't been back since I caught the muskie bug, but certainly have nothing negative to say about the camp - lots of good memories there!"
