1297758,chocho1971,2011-04-21 16:16:00,16,The year SARS was the new thing going around there were 9 of in a van with only 6 of us in on the joke. I got 6 surgical masks when we crossed the border we put them on telling the other 3 that we told them to get them for the trip. It was the first trip for my hypocondriact friend his brother and son. They instantly put their shirt over their face and started complaining about why didn't remind them. We all laughed so hard it was hard to breathe
1297802,bigwalleye1,2011-04-21 18:27:00,2632,"One of my favorites, and I picked it up in a similar thread a couple years ago... We fish a lot of jigs, so lure cost isn't huge. Cut 40 ft of line off someone''s reel. Wind 20 back on, being careful to cover the ends. Wind on the remaining 20 setting the jig in place as it was. The first cast in the morning, and the jig takes off. Makes for some great ""cheap line"" ""old line"" abd ""bad knot"" jokes while the poor sap ties on another jig. You can see where this is going. The next cast and he's open season for the rest of the day......"
1297821,Further North,2011-04-21 19:46:00,2008,...On the 2nd day...do the same thing...but do it twice on the same reel.He'll never think to look past the first break.
1297902,Nimstug,2011-04-21 23:36:00,2605,"I try not to make a prank cost something, cost physical harm. Just a simple joke. I had three set up for our trip last year.When we arrived our host said he just set a mouse trap as they spotted a visitor. By the time we got in the cabin, the mouse was dead and removed. I happened to bring along a rubber mouse that I placed on Kenn's pillow under the blanket.I also brought along a ~12"" gag fish-sort of a goofy looking trout. I rigged it to pop out of his livewell when he opened the hatch.Then I got my son to talk up the snakes we 'saw' that day. Of course Kenn hadn't seen any. We described the snakes which happened to match the rubber snake I out in his tackle box. NimstugWhen I grow up I want to be a little boy."
1297970,tv4fish,2011-04-22 07:33:00,2694,"I love messin' with my buddies - (I've known them since grade school) - I like to ""change the date"" of when our trip is. As we get within about a month of when we are supposed to go, I'll send them an email asking if they're ready to go - of course I orignally give them dates that are a week off ! Heck, they're old and forgetful (and leave that stuff up to me).Makes for a few serious concerns for a while"
1297998,chocho1971,2011-04-22 08:24:00,16,"One time our cabin was full of mice you could hear them running on the bunk above you at night. It was my kids first time in Canada so they took it upon themselves to try to get them. After getting 5 or so it was bed time my oldest went to bed with bug net on, pants tucked in his socks, and socks on his hands. Once in bed I started scratching the wall with my fingers he knew it was me and kept telling me to quit it. I waited a while reached over picked up my watch off the nightstand threw it on him. He jump acrossed the cabin into my bed not even touching the floor landing in bed with me screaming its on me. Maybe take a rubber mouse with you just in case."
1298020,rdbalmer,2011-04-22 08:56:00,279,We have used that one before too. It is a great prank and no real harm done. LMAO a number of times.
