1294959,Loup387,2011-04-15 05:43:00,5,"I have been to the Cabonga many times. We usually fish at Andou #8. On the same road to Deerhorn. It is a great adventure. Jigs (chartruse) and a leech will work great , also worm harnesses. This year there is a slot limit on the Cabonga 13 - 20 inches for walleye. Comments posted previously regarding DH and the park are very accurate."
1295010,bpswing,2011-04-15 08:26:00,132,"Thanks pal. I wish I could fish with my son this year but its not gonna happen because he's flying a helicopter for the US Army. I'm so bummed, Ive fished with this kid every year since he was 5 at someplace new usually in Canada, he's 22 now. We did get up to Dearhorn last year and the cabins and docks were nice, the walleye was good, pike was not. Most of all we had fun fishing together especially the last few hours we were really nailing the walleyes. Guess thats how I'll remember our last Canada outing for awhile."
1295216,gofishwalleye,2011-04-15 15:56:00,589,"Please pass on my thanks to your son for his service, and I'm sure you'll find an acceptable fishing trip.Thank you to all who serveMike, USAF Retired"
1295282,Robert Cardenas,2011-04-15 18:42:00,138,"Not sure if www.BonnyBay.com Resort Lake Wabigoon is to far for you guys. It is located in Dryden Ont. I will be up there that same week and would be glad to show you the lake and catch a lot of fish, walleye, pike, perch, etc. Two of my friends that usually come up with us to Canada are not coming this year due to military training. Tell your son thank you for what he is doing and my offer to you guys is there. Good Luck."
1295301,Wall1,2011-04-15 19:40:00,17,Great Idea and we all hope for your sons safe return. I would reccomend two general areas- Look for a outfitter or guide the goes onto the Restigo provincial area in Quebec. Just across the river from Deep river Ontario. A little further north in a different direction you cant beat the Gouin Reservoir - you can drive right to it via Parent - from Rochester I think it falls into you 8-9 hours. there are many camps and places from remote to houseboats up thereif you need specific suggestion just ask- my dad and i have done both trips several times with good success.the La Verdyne park id also a good choice but either way go with a guide .good luck
1295494,wallydave,2011-04-16 09:41:00,2151,"BP, send a big thank you to your son and all those he is serving with! I hope and pray that all of our sons and daughters in harms way will be able to return home safe and sound! A good friend of mine has returned home, I would like nothing better than to take him fishing this summer, but he wants and needs to spend time with his family! I hope you and your son will be able to share a boat again soon!"
1295571,bigwalleye1,2011-04-16 12:46:00,2632,"BP, While I'm too far ( I think) west to help on the walleye (we fish Lac Seul out of Sioux Lookout 2x per summer for 10+ years) I wanted to take a minute and echo what Wallydave said. A big than you to your son, as well as all the other sons and daughters in harm's way, and a thank you also to all the parents of sons and daughters for their sacrifices as well. If you do want to fish Lac Seul, I'd be glad to give you any info I can re: places to stay, ins and outs, do's and don'ts, colors, techniques and any GPS spot info you want. If I can do anything to make the trip a success, I'll give you all the info and intel I've got. PM me if you need it."
1295586,Jack77,2011-04-16 13:35:00,168,"I got to go with my son before he went off to boot. A great vacation with lots of great memories. He is a combat enigneer with the 10th Moutain Division at Ft. Drum now. Enjoy your time together and good luck sending him off to boot, one of the most emotional days of our lives. Watching him graduate from boot at Ft. Leonard Wood was one of the proudest. I have two more at home wating for their turn. Cherish that time, it is precious."
1200653,bpswing,2010-05-15 11:11:00,132,"I get one last shot to fish with my son before he heads off with the Army. I live in Rochester and want to take him for some drive to wilderness walleye/pike action. Can drive 8-9 hrs tops. Was thinking Parc La Verendrye in Quebec. Has anyone been there recently or can someone recommend a new lake in Ontario/Quebec. Going June 1-4. Been fishing with this kid since he was 5, now hes 22 and this kid can flat out fish. Thanks BP"
1200654,Juls,2010-05-15 11:22:00,13414,"I can't help answer your question, but I just wanted to say, good luck fishing, enjoy every moment, and may he find safe travels that bring him home to you again real soon. Juls"
1200918,Guest,2010-05-16 13:28:00,0,"If the kid can ""flat out fish"" any lake with a reasonable walleye population should be fine. Just enjoy the time together."
1201093,bpswing,2010-05-17 06:24:00,132,Has anyone had any positive or negative experiences with the Deerhorn Lodge in Quebec? Thanks
1201372,gpbrown,2010-05-17 20:04:00,359,"BP, I think DH is a very good lodge compared to the other lodge on on the lake, Cabonga Lodge. Only positive to Cabonga is the drive is closer on the gravel road. If your bringing your own rig you probably average 10 miles an hour if you care about your equipment and kidneys. Cabonga is about 6 miles and Deerhorn is about 18 miles if memory serves me. At Cabonga you have to pull everything( rods, tackle box, graphs, etc.) out of your boat or you will be looted by the Indians. Quite a pain if you fish all day and it's raining because there is one common dock and you may have to lug that stuff for 100 yds or better depending on which cabin you get. At DH you can leave your wallet on the seat if you like. Most of the docks are private and adjacent to your cabin. At that time of year you should expect snow on a day or two and a day or two in short sleeves. I would also think the flies would be hungry too. Last year they had an off year according to the reports due to bad weather and high waters. I didn't go last year but the previous 6 years were very good fishing. Pike fishing not the greatest but that may be due to the time of year I went. Mid may to early June should give you a good shot at a 40 incher. We always did good on walleyes. Scenery and getting away are what we look forward too along with the fishing. You could see bald eagles, loons, bear, and moose all on the same trip. Watch out for rocks and I hope your good at navigating cause you can get lost if your not paying attention. Hope this helps."
1201452,bpswing,2010-05-18 05:41:00,132,GP Thanks much. Advice well taken. Will problably give Deerhorn a shot unless something better comes along quick.
1201485,Auggie264,2010-05-18 07:29:00,391,"I'd take a look at Devils Lake. It's not very wildernessy (I made up a word!), but in June, you can tie up to almost any tree, run a slipbobber, and catch a number of walleyes. It takes some trial and error, but it's a great time. Pitching crankbaits are also very popular and you will catch nice eyes as well as all the pike you could think of."
1201544,bpswing,2010-05-18 11:06:00,132,Wheres Devils Lake near?

1201567,bpswing,2010-05-18 12:02:00,132,"That wont work. I live near Rochester, NY, thats why I was looking at Quebec or somewhere within 8-9 hrs drive. Thanks anyway."
