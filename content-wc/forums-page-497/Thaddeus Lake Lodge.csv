1296822,Guest,2011-04-19 14:41:00,0,"i hope to spend a week in june at thaddeus for the rest of my life!! last year our group of eight all caught walleye over 27. with the largest 29 1/2. big numbers on thaddeus too. some years we are early before thaddeus turns ""on"". then we head for ord and moose. never fails to see the andy meyers lodge boat there. same people every year too. makes me wonder if they know how to read. thaddeus lake lodge is on the side of every boat. 46 days!!!"
1297140,wallydave,2011-04-20 07:52:00,2151,"I have had good to great luck on Lac Seul, but I am always looking for new waters. I like the multi species aspect of Thaddeus, and I realize different fish bite and thier seasons vary. My question is how many walleye could I take home from Thaddeus? I never take home anything over 16 inches. Thanks!"
1297159,JayM5209,2011-04-20 08:21:00,1050,"Possession limit in that zone is four walleyes. If the jumbo perch are biting, you can take 50 of them. . . . and I'm talking jumbo! I don't fish Thaddeus but Ord Lake - specifically Puzzle Bay - is my favorite fishing spot in NWO. Sneak down the creek from Thaddeus and through the culvert under the road into Ord and you'll transition from good fishing into Paradise!!Puzzle Bay is a fish sanctuary so it's closed until June 1. The rest of Ord is fishable earlier. And, yes, in years past we have seen vans from a camp in the northwest area of Eagle Lake pull into the Ord landing with boats and a load of clients who are out to experience a ""wilderness"" fishing excursion. Duh................ don't ask me to explain that one."

542499,Guest,2004-08-11 08:36:00,0,"I am going to Thaddeus for the first time from 8-14-04 - 8-20-04. I am going because my friend usually catches one or two eyes over 28"" every year, plus a bonus muskie once in awhile. This will be my 9th trip to Canada. I have fished PipeStone Lake 4 times, Wabakimi(fly-in) three times and Anishinabi once. My biggest eye has only been 23"", but have caught quite a few. Caught a 41"" inch Northern 3 years ago. If you E-mail me, I'll send you the pictures of the Thaddeus fish. My E-mail is [email protected] Last year my friend,his his son and one of the owners caught 4 eyes 28""-29"", so we'll see. Not a big lake, but you can also access two other like sized lakes that are good for numbers of eyes. I will give you a report when I get back. They seem to be really protective of the fishery which is good to see. They have a fish revival tank for larger fish that may not make it and basically forbid the taking of eyes over 18"". The owners (the Parks brothers) are from Bellevue, NE and own Computer Cable Connection. One of the owners(Perry) used to guide on Lake Okoboji and they are serious fisherman. They discovered the lake while driving by it on the way to Williams Lake lodge which is on Lac Seul. It is supposed to be a real good Muskie lake, although I won't be intentially fishing for them. I agree that the rates are reasonable."
542504,Guest,2004-08-11 14:10:00,0,"Fished Thaddeus two years ago in the spring and had a great time. We caught good numbers of walleyes of all sizes but we went there for the big walleyes. And did we catch large walleyes. Many in the 26-30 inch range. As a bonus we picked up three muskies while walleye fishing. Fish Ord lake for shore lunch, fish Thaddeus for memories."
542505,Ia Walihntr,2004-08-11 14:36:00,320,"Thadeus Lake Lodge is owned and operated by Rocky and Angie Thompson who are from Milford Ia, which by the way, is about 3 miles from the south end of Lake Okoboji. There are two lakes you can access from Thaddeus that are joined by the Ord river, Ord Lake being one of them. I believe that Thaddeus Lake Lodge is the only, or one of only two resorts on the system. Catch and release only for that resort. Brother in law was there last fall (he's from Milford also) strictly walleye fishing. Lots of fish in the 15 to 20 inch range and a few up to 25 but nothing bigger. I'm sure there are 10 lb fish there though. Marv"
542509,Guest,2004-08-11 15:34:00,0,"I am pretty sure that Angie & Rocky just manage the lodge, but do not own it. Perry & Eric Parks own it and are from the Okoboji area, but live in Bellevue, NE. I've seen the pictures of the big eyes from guys I know, not the 4 year old pictures that some lodges have on their web sites. The big boys are in there and they pretty much make you release them which is good practice. Maybe you just didn't know how to fish for them? Or maybe it was a cold front."
542606,Guest,2004-08-14 09:25:00,0,"Have been to Thaddeus about 5 times, always in mid-June. It is a very good lake for big walleyes but not generally an action lake for walleyes. Better action can be found in Ord. In the right circumstances you may catch many between 24"" and 27"" plus the occasional 30+ incher. Gotta give a thumbs up to catch and release camps, this leads to a better fishery. I happen to have a 30"" on the wall from Thaddeus (caught when Rob owned it), the only one I've ever caught. Hindsight being 20/20 all my future catches will be graphite repros. This is especially important on a small 5000 acre lake like Thaddeus. You may also catch muskies and pike seem to be getting bigger in recent years. The camp managers Rocky and Angie are nice people and do a better job with their guests than most operators I've dealt with."
542622,Guest,2004-08-15 12:36:00,0,I've heard that another lodge from Eagle Lake trailers some of their guests in there....ord perhaps....is this true. Too bad they can't control these guys if this is the case. May be Andy Meyers but I could be wrong.
542623,Guest,2004-08-15 13:19:00,0,"It can't be so, Andy meyers camp says they all the walleyes you can catch real close to their camp on eagle lake. I can't see them trailering boats to another lake to catch fish. (HA HA Or can I)"
1228846,Guest,2010-08-18 16:57:00,0,"We have been going to thaddeus Lake Lodge for about 10 years and can't say enough about it. managers are knowledgeable, informative, helpful and we feel safe there. the lakes produce large muskie, large walleyes, great bass fishing and jumbo perch, oh, I missed the northern...plenty of them in any size. The only thing we can't control is the weather. We go the week of July 4th only because they are booked early on and we have to take what we can get. Dryden is an hour away, but we never leave camp for the week and don't miss town. We have a shower in the cabin, small refridge, small stove, but we do enough shore lunches we don't have to cook much at the cabin. Cabins are very clean and comfortable. Any other questions you can email at [email protected] We are located in Door County Wisconsin"
1229440,Stu,2010-08-20 23:23:00,472,"Andy Myers does fish there! They call them 4wd safari's. There is a boat ramp on Ord near puzzle bay. I was there 2 years ago. Rocky was guiding us and an AML boat pulled up right next to us and started fishing. Very rude, IMO. Omahawalleyeguy is correct. Rocky and his wife manage the lodge. The owners have a private cabin next to the main camp. Rocky runs a 1st class operation and is very conservation-minded. Let us know how you do."
