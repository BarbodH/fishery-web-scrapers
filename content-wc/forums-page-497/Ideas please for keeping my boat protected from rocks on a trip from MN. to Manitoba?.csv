1287632,VMS,2011-03-27 16:21:00,1103,"Hiya, If my memory serves me right, you will be on the same road that I have been on many times....roughly 40 miles long and not all that far north of Cranberry portage. If you are headed to where I think you might be, there will be sections of that road that get treated with chloride to keep the dust down, but those sections are few and far between. That particular road has been rough on our equipment over the years. One broken axle, one trailer that broke into two pieces (left and right half), a few tires (both on trucks and on trailers) My suggestion: Towtector for the truck, and get some flat packing foam and shrink wrap. Shrink Wrap the foam to the trailer rails in front of the trailer fenders. Get it good and tight to minimize losing paint from vibration. With the towtector, I would get one that is wider than your truck. Lots of the rocks that kick up are actually ones that are bouncing along the road after the tire grabbed them and it fell out of the treads..they kick all over the place. If the road you are on is the same one I am thinking of, please PM me... I have not been up there in a few years, but I do have an idea of places to fish if you are interested... Steve"
1287769,SSH,2011-03-27 21:01:00,526,"I would recommend you have a custom bra made for your boat that is padded with foam inside of the bra. The bra should as much of the front of the boat as possible .Also, have the canvas shop make a cover with foam inside to cover the lower unit. Many people have Tow-Tectors, Rock-Tamers or equivalent means to minimize the chips.I only have about 15 miles of gravel and the small rock chips fly everywhere. So going both ways means 30 miles of gravel. I have a custom bra and Rock-Tamers. The boat does pretty well, but the trailer still takes a beating. IMHO, it is worth it to get to our destination.The boat bra, lower unit cover and Rock-Tamers cost me about $300 total."
1287780,Oohmiracle,2011-03-27 21:34:00,2,We drive about 300 miles total on gravel. Menards sell 10' x 20' roll of rubber roof material. watch the ads and you can get it about $100. i have pieces cut to cover the front bow of my boat for both sides. when we hit the gravel we take a brake from driving and use some duct tape to hold it on. last I cut stips to wrap around the trailer frame then wrap a few stips of tape to hold it on. works great.

1295482,tuscarora,2011-04-16 09:13:00,9,"Also, don't forget to cover any of you trailers wiring that may be exposed to rocks/mud."
1295495,Thunderbucket,2011-04-16 09:41:00,323,be sure to check you route and road conditions before you leave.... this is the second worst year for such widespread flooding in MB in 150 years. Some rural municipalities only have a couple bridges left with many washed out roadshttp://roaddata.gov.mb.ca/map/gmap/m...at=49.8&zoom=9link to gov. live road map
1295649,T Mac,2011-04-16 16:40:00,10084,There are products available for just that. www.mtrockguard.com for example. Additionally you'll want a good set of mudflaps on the tow vehicle.
1297301,tlee,2011-04-20 13:00:00,65,There is highway all the way to Flin Flon right? I'm going there June 11th from ND.

1285992,tuscarora,2011-03-23 16:11:00,9,"We are leaving for north of Flin Flon, Manitoba after walleyes in June. First time up there for me, and my friend I'm going with tells me that your boat/trailer will take a beating from all the rocky roads. He gave me the idea of cutting 6"" flexable black plastic corregated pipe to cover the trails and supports on my trailer. I checked on covers for the front of boats, and being a retired school teacher I can't afford the $1000-3000 prices of the custom made company models. Does anyone have any good ideas for how to cover/protect the front of my boat from rocks? It doesn't have to be pretty, as long as it's functional and relatively cheap. Thanks in advance for any help you can give me.Rich"
1286077,hoosiercanadian,2011-03-23 19:40:00,104,"I drive from southern Indiana to Lynn Lake Manitoba 1,850 miles one way, the last 200 miles is mostly gravel , sometimes mud, with about a million chuck holes to attempt to avoid. I own a cabin up there and now leave my boat there. You can kiss your marker lights goodby, and any paint on your fenders, it is almost impossible to not do some kind of damage to your trailer, your boat might receive a couple of dings , and end up covered in mud , but the trailer will take the worst of it. I did wrap the lower unit of my motor with burlap bags , bungee cords etc. do the best to cover everything you can, just trying to warn you, these roads are really hard on equiptment, also, bring more than one spare trailer tire, and don't try and drive as fast as the locals do or you may take out an axel as well., i've never lost an axel , but i've seen a couple setting along the road, bad way to start a trip."
1286115,Jiggin the Point,2011-03-23 21:08:00,24,"Try wrapping your trailer with the large pipe insulation and wire ties, also a home made full length mud flap hanging from the back bumper will help....We took my brothers new Ram last year and the last 25 miles were gravel roads. I remenber telling him to stop and let me out and I will be waiting or him at the end of the road when he gets there."
1286448,tuscarora,2011-03-24 15:57:00,9,THANKS for all the suggestions!
1286565,castnblast,2011-03-24 20:20:00,111,I drive alot of gravel - a quality skirt on the truck is a must. not expensive and really holds back most of the fliers coming off the back wheels.
1286724,Guest,2011-03-25 08:09:00,0,I would do a search under the Canada section on here - Clova Road With New Boat There are some excellent suggestions. Good luck Smitty
1286788,Mike Kansas,2011-03-25 10:05:00,1463,"Been on that road to Lynn Lake and without a doubt there are not enough fish in Lynn Lake to make me drive that last 200 miles again. Tires, trailier and vehicle under carriage feel the same way. Mike Kansas"
1286860,jswinter40,2011-03-25 11:51:00,127,"I go to Canada every year but haven't taken a bad road in qutie a while. If I knew I was going to take a rough road with my boat I would have decent mud flaps on both my front and rear tires of the truck as well as a good bed skirt. Cover the trailer frame as others have stated before and try to ""jimmy rig"" some sort of shield on the front of the hull. (maybe use some carpet or those thick rubber mats like they use in barns and milking parlor stalls). remember to always have 1-2 spare tires, spare wheel barings, spare prop, spare drain plug, and all necessary tools.also wrap all electronics and rods - think towels and duct tapemost importantly don't forget to have fun"
1286923,Slushfish,2011-03-25 14:38:00,263,"We travel from Northern Michigan to Lake of The Woods. 2000 mi. round trip. Bought a new boat last year. Made a full length mud flap out of a piece of scrap angle iron, a chunk of conveyor belt, and two pieces of dog chain. I had about $4.00 invested instead of the $200 they wanted for one at Cabelas. Worked great, I couldn't find one chip in the boat. If you would like,I could get the measurements for you."
1287087,tuscarora,2011-03-26 02:47:00,9,Thanks for all your help. I got some great ideas from all of you!Rich
