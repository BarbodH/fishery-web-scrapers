1243416,onetimedave,2010-10-19 06:47:00,502,Even if it is just October it is not too early to book your 2011 trip. Our deposit is on the way to Nakina and we are counting the days.
1243421,Larry Mac,2010-10-19 06:59:00,530,"Hi Onetimedave, I agree we too have all our 2011 dates and deposits in place. It gives us more time to prepare and the group commitments are finalized. Have a great 2011 year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1244000,Glenman12,2010-10-21 21:13:00,762,Hi Larry How ya been...looking forward to 2011 with a little more consistent weather...see you at the All Canada show?

1244031,Ogoki,2010-10-22 06:41:00,291,My wife said that I am always one season away from the present. I told her her have to plan ahead. It is now bow hunting but I can't help but dream about the trip we have booked for next June to Ogoki Reservoir. When I started going in June I found out real quickly to book early. You can normally always get a late July or early August booking . I like the June fishing . It is right after turkey season and 6 weeks or so before our bear hunt . Always got to plan ahead !!!!!!!!!!!!! My Mom is that way too and she is 91 and still going strong . I think that helps her too. Positive mind and attitude !!
1244035,Larry Mac,2010-10-22 07:12:00,530,"Hi Glen, Great to hear from you. We will definately see you at the show. Thank you,Larry Mac"
