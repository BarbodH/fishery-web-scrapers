Now while I wouldn't say I'd leave a ""jumpin' in the boat"" walleye bite to go catch perch, Being the walleye limit on Lac Seul is 2 or 4, and the perch limit is 50, it'd be a nice opportunity to bring some fish back that are just as tasty without putting the hurt on the walleye population. So, to my question, we fish the NE side of Lac Seul. Are there few perch there or am I just not looking in the right places? If it's the latter, any tips on finding ""the right places?"" We're there the second week of June and again the second week of July. I'm NOT asking for spots, but types of structure and maybe techniques, just to get me going. Thanks!"

Perch fry up eat just as well as walleye! Good luck on the NE side! I'll be on LS in 47 days!"
