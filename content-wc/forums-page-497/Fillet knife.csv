1296799,Mark Komo,2011-04-19 13:44:00,867,Kershaw is $10 at amazon. Pretty good price.
1296803,bigwalleye1,2011-04-19 13:52:00,2632,"I've had a couple Chicago Cutlery knives, one fixed blade and one folder, that are my go-to knives. While I've got a couple other brands hidden away in a pack, or in the boat, the ones I use are the Chicagos. I'm sure they no longer make the folder, and it's a shame, because for removing rib bones it's my favorite. The fixed blade is about 9"", and it sharpens well and holds an edge. I haven't looked in a while, but I believe they still make the knife but not the sheath. If I ever see them again, I'll buy spares, although these don't show signs of needing replacement 15 years in."
1296876,Bigstorm,2011-04-19 16:41:00,799,"I use the good ole wood handle Rapala 6"" knives. Wroks great for me, just run it across the stone a few times every once in a while and its good as new."
1296899,wiswalleye,2011-04-19 17:27:00,62,"I really like the Leech Lake filet knife I got as a B'day gift from my kids. It's sharp, flexible and holds an edge well and is nice looking. Contrary to popular belief, it is not that hard to sharpen."
1297012,TIGHTLINER,2011-04-19 20:56:00,223,NOW THIS IS GOING TO DATE ME BUT WHEN I WAS A KID AT THE AGE OF 15 I WORKED IN A FISH CLEANING PLACE ON LAKE ERIE WHEN PERCH WERE BROUGHT IN BY THE HUNDREDS TO BE CLEANED. THE OWNER GAVE ME A NEW DEXTER 1376 TOLD ME TO TAKE CARE OF IT AND IT WOULD LAST A LIFE TIME. I HAVE TWO OF THEM THE ONE HE GAVE ME AND ONE I BOUIGHT FROM HIM WHILE WORKING. BOTH HAVE CLEANED LOTS OF PERCH AND WALLEYE OVER THE YEARS AND HE WAS RIGHT AT THE AGE NOW OF 66 I STILL HAVE BOTH OF THEM AND THEY BOTH HOLD A EDGE AND MOST OF THE TIME IF YOU RUN THEM OVER A STEEL THAT IS ALL THAT IS NEEDED. THE ONE I BOUGHT I THINK I PAID $3.25 AND I AM NOT SURE IF THEY ARE STILL MADE YET OR NOT. THEY WILL BE HANDED DOWN TO THE BOYS WHEN MY FISHING DAYS ARE DONE AND THEY WILL PROBABLY LAST THEM AS LONG AS THEY HAVE ME.
1297126,Lazy Fisherman,2011-04-20 07:33:00,276,Have to agree with Camp Chef. Wusthof is the best fillet knife I have ever owned.
1297139,WallyKiller,2011-04-20 07:51:00,15,Like this one?http://www.whitewaterfishingsupply.com/1376-knife.html
1297148,JayM5209,2011-04-20 08:05:00,1050,"Yep, the Dexters are still available. All the Dexter fillet knives are here: http://www.dexter-russell.com/2008/S...=cat&search=10All six versions of the 1376 can be found by typing 1376 into the Search function at the top of the page on the Dexter web site.A quick Google search for ""Dexter knives"" will bring up lots of online retail sources."
1297312,TIGHTLINER,2011-04-20 13:15:00,223,That is amazing that they are still made and six different styles in it. Back then I thought it was a good knife and $3.25 was a lot of money back then. Good to know they are still around. I have never seen a Dexter knife sold anywhere in the stores. With all the more expensive ones on the market this would be a good back up..

1296668,J Arendt,2011-04-19 08:27:00,45,Hey guys-- Any help on a good knife with a good edge and a good price?
1296686,camp chef,2011-04-19 09:04:00,915,"I have used a lot of good fillet knives,but now have one. The best knife I have ever used is a 7 inch Wustof. You should be able to buy one for between $75 and $85. Last fillet knife you will need to buy."
1296689,rpieske,2011-04-19 09:07:00,1276,"Kershaw Fillet knives are extremely sharp right out of the package, have a nice handle and hold an edge well. It is my choice in fillet knives.http://www.amazon.com/Fillet-Knife-C...3225532&sr=8-9"
1296697,Bill Krejca,2011-04-19 09:24:00,6107,"I suggest Cutco. There's an old saying about getting almost any item - It goes something like this: ""Good, fast, cheap - pick any 2."" Bill Krejca"
1296710,rebs,2011-04-19 09:52:00,7587,I use a good ole balck and decker electric from walmart 10.00 you can't beat it.I have been using the same one for 3 years.
1296721,NARDA 1,2011-04-19 10:09:00,636,The guide or dock boy has worked great for me.
1296738,wallydave,2011-04-19 10:54:00,2151,"My wife bought a rapella filet knife for me several years ago! It holds its sharpness pretty well. A bump for the wallmart $10 special too, my boat and cabin buddy likes to clean em fast and easy with his electric!"
1296751,Pooch,2011-04-19 11:32:00,4619,"Ditto what rpieske said about the Kershaw. I have the exact knife that his link goes to. It has to be fifteen years or so old and still holds a good edge. I'd buy another in a heartbeat.That said a few years ago I started using two Rapala electric knives. One 12 volt and the other 110 volt. The 12 volt will also run on 110 volts with the adapter, but doesn't seem to have as much power as the regular 110 volt model. I really like the 110 volt Rapala and it's the first knife I'll grab if we are near power.Pooch"

1296787,Mohleye,2011-04-19 13:11:00,368,"I did some internet research a year ago looking for a backup filet knife at a reasonable price (had to be under $25.00 for a gift exchange). I found a filet knife from Frost of Sweden through Knifecenter for approx $20.00. I'm not sure how to post the link but I just googled it again and found it right away. There were 5 reviews and all rated 5 stars. The blade is more flexible than I'm used to, I would call it a surgical stainless steel, and it is VERY VERY sharp. I've only used it once, to filet a bunch of pan fish after an ice fishing trip, and I actually quit using it halfway through as the cold fish had my hands numb and it was kind of scary....I kept thinking I'd cut off a thumb or something. So I can't give it a full review, but for your criteria of a good edge at a reasonable price, I'd say it fits the bill. My concern would be whether such a thin, flexible blade would hold up over the long haul, but the reviews claim it does. My go-to filet knife is a Buck, by the way. No longer made, but if I ever found another one, I'd buy it in a heartbeat."
