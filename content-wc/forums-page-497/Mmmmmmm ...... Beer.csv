1294737,gary2242,2011-04-14 13:51:00,49,"40 Creek is the best rye according to my friends. All my buddies drank Crown Royal and have all switched to 40 Creek. I personally like Walkers Special Old. I don't know why so many Americans come to Ontario and buy Labatts Blue. If you want to really enjoy a beautiful smooth and sweat beer, I would buy Alexander Keiths Indian Pale Ale or the Amber. Labatts Wheat is really good to but hard to find. I don't even know if they still make it.gary"

1295444,tyson2925,2011-04-16 08:09:00,95,"off the subject a little but I know you can bring a case of beer a person into canada. Beer prices are scary in Canada, I know I would have to pay duty to bring extra but I have been advised that it is still a better deal then buying in Canada. Anyone know how to figure the cost of bringing in extra beer? Will it delay my ride through customs much?Thanks,"
1295500,Red Tail Chub,2011-04-16 09:52:00,17,"I just buy and pack what I need at home and then declare what extra I have at the border and go in and pay the duty to bring it across. Works out cheaper and easier than buying it there or at the ""duty free"" store where the prices aren't that good. Doesn't seem to hold up my crossing at the border much. I think it's just a set rate for beer and bottles. They never asked for a reciept to show what I paid so I don't think it matters but I could be wrong."
1295514,Bearfangary,2011-04-16 10:28:00,22,Camp Chef is a notorious short hitter and has trouble running with the pack. BFG
1295516,castnblast,2011-04-16 10:34:00,111,"Labatt Crystal is great beer, and a Northwestern Ontario favorite. Can't get it in cans though. Alexander Kieth's is another good one. lastly, I've never met a cold Labatt Blue I didn't like."
1296228,camp chef,2011-04-18 07:38:00,915,"There was a day that I could keep up with you, But being a Bear fan,you have more more reason to drink than I do."
1296233,Bigstorm,2011-04-18 07:48:00,799,I usually go with the Labatt blue light in the morning and switch to regular Labatt in the afternoon.
1296569,Hawkfan,2011-04-18 22:02:00,237,"They usually just ask how much we paid per case and take our word for it. But yes, we have our receipt with just in case."
1296578,Terwalleye,2011-04-19 00:51:00,166,"dont make my mistake. I answered the ""how much"" qustion with beginning with the cost of Grey Goose and he said ""that's enough info and charged us the same per litre for booze for all. OooopsThis year I'll mention the cheap stuff first. Thanks for all the great recommendations. Keiths and Blue Crystal, will make the trip and we'll hit the beer store friday night as soon as we cross the border. Last year we were too impatient."
1293040,ScottL,2011-04-10 10:28:00,733,"Sleeman's Clear, Kokanee or Steamwhistle are my choices, but then again I drink Michelob Golden Draft Light, Bud Light or Coors Light back in the states and have a hard time choking down dark or heavy types."
1293486,Fisherman1792,2011-04-11 15:04:00,927,"Drink either Canadian or Maclays. I know what I like and I stick with it.By the way, is it just where I live or is it all over, when you go and buy beer do you expect it to be cold, because here in Marathon when we go and buy beer at the beer store, it is barely cool. I want a cold one and I hate having to wait for a couple of hours for it to get cold. I am just wondering if it is like that with the rest of the beer stores in Ontario?Fisherman 1792"
1293539,camp chef,2011-04-11 16:53:00,915,"If it takes a couple hours to get your beer cold, you are using the wrong ice."
1293555,Fisherman1792,2011-04-11 18:01:00,927,Lol!!
1293581,SteveJ715,2011-04-11 18:37:00,59,"I'll throw another vote in for Kokanee. Good stuff - I wish it was available here in Wisconsin -- specifically in my fridge. We always try to stock up at the duty-free shop on the border. If we don't drink it all, we either leave it in the fridge in the cabin for the next guys or give it to the guides in a gesture of thanks. It can be a random mix of gifts at times, (""Guys, we have three Kokanees and four Molsons here for you..."") but they have yet to turn us down.- Steve"
1293661,MorganMan,2011-04-11 22:41:00,341,"We take a bunch of beer and have for years as there is nothing better after a day on the water than to grill up some surf and turf the play poker! ""insert man grunt here"". We have found the best, and the cheapest, for us is to get it at home and pay the duty on it at the border. We cross at FF also. We buy it at home the week before the trip at Sam's Club and have found that's usually a better price than even the deals that say buy 9 get 1 free. You pay duty based on the price you pay. Then it's packed and you don't need to worry about getting it put away in mid travel. Kokanee is one of our favorites and couple years ago became available here in MN. Blue Light also good....after a couple, they are all good. Next thing you know it's a good cup of coffee on the water....and if you are me, a big wad of cash from poker the night before!"
1293785,captaincanada56,2011-04-12 10:10:00,17,"i have to second the kokanee. very good beer. steamwhistle is also a good choice. alexander keiths has some good stuff, the red amber ale i highly recommend. my abosloute favourite beer tho, is moosehead. brewery in nova scotia makes it. any trip, we always stock up on moosehead. anyone interested in trying a fantastic brew when they come to the great north, do yourself a favour and grab a case of moosehead!"
1294017,still fishin',2011-04-12 22:03:00,69,Bleue. But almost any beer tastes good up nord.
1294074,Bigstorm,2011-04-13 06:54:00,799,"You mentioned that you pay duty on the extra beer based on the price you bought it for, so does that mean you bring your reciept from when you purchased it and show the people at the border? I'm only asking because I will be crossing the border a few hours before the Beer Store opens and am planning on bringing my extra beer with me"
1294144,Jahloaf,2011-04-13 09:21:00,74,"As a friend and someone on this board has said, I have 3 favorite kinds of beer1 Cold2 Free3 Yours.That pretty much coverers it"
1291592,Terwalleye,2011-04-06 10:52:00,166,"Hey GangY'all were most helpful for our group heading to CA for the first time in years, last year. I need a little help picking out some beers and more importantly the timing of actually buying it and where. Last year we crossed the border too early for the Beer Store in Ft Frances to be open. We had bought some ""Duty Free"" and made a bee line for our resort to start fishing. On one of the rainy days we went to the LCBO in Vermillion Bay only to find out some of the variety (and obviously more tasty beers) sell out on Saturday. So, where and when do we get the tasty ones? And what's your favs? Anyone know the hours for the Beer Store in Fort? We are gonna corss the border Friday night and maybe we can hit the Beer store before they close.Thanks in AdvanceTerwalleye"
1291647,Mark R,2011-04-06 13:03:00,1538,10:00 - 6:00 Monday thru Thursday 10:00 -9:30 Friday 9:30 -6:00 Saturday noon to 5:00 Sunday. I believe there is also a beer store in Dryden. Google Beer Store and find all the locations.
1291653,Jack77,2011-04-06 13:16:00,168,Goggle LCBO and you can get locations and times.
1291663,Blue Lk,2011-04-06 13:57:00,269,"The LCBO in Vermiloin Bay only carries the ""standard variety"" of beer brands.The Beer Store in Fort Frances or Dryden will carry a little more selection.LCBO stores in both places will also carry ""premium brands"" of beer."
1291734,fishman10,2011-04-06 16:38:00,226,"the lcbo also carries a wide variety of european beers by the litre. i like to try several different pops while waiting for my toronto maple leafs to win the stanley. boy its been a long wait and a lot of different beers. when your a leaf fan, this can lessen the pain."
1291748,walleye88ia,2011-04-06 17:17:00,35,my favorite beers are kokanee and labatts blue light.
1292786,NARDA 1,2011-04-09 11:56:00,636,Kokanee or Labatts Ice
1292788,camp chef,2011-04-09 12:09:00,915,My favorite Canadian beer is the first one I open each day after fishing.
1292850,joeman79,2011-04-09 18:46:00,417,LMAO My exact thoughts and a vote for Kokanee for a slammer and a Kieths IPA for sippin. But a Forty Creek with a splash of water and Ice is hard to beat sitiin on the deck watchin the sun go down. 105 days.
1292861,Blue Lk,2011-04-09 19:32:00,269,"+1 on the 40 Creek,I'm enjoying some at the moment."
