Yes you can catch 200 fish a day, but they are 2 to 3 pounds, and if you are lucky, you might get one or two that are bigger. Touchwood, Calling, or even Moose has better quality of fish than Slave. Depending on where you are from, I would head east into Sask. Last Mountain Lake will be on fire then, and you have a realistic shot at big walleyes, and decent numbers of them. Tobin Lake will also be fishing good, and the Big River area also has some incredible fishing too. Chris K"
