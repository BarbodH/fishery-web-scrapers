3961633,Bluebomber,2015-06-13 00:05:00,29,So over the years of fishing in canada (lac suel south central section) I've seen some things... How about you? First time to mahkwa I was 10 years old fishing off the dock (just can't get enough... It's a addiction!) dad and his buddies cooking supper. I hear some noise by our neighbors cabin. I watch this big black bear punch out the screen on this porch grab a cooler by the handle and make a bee line for the woods dragging the cooler. Losing a beer here and there. I was crapping my pants on the dock watching this. This guy comes running out of the cabin picks up a rock and starts chasing this bear. I remember thinking how crazy that guy was for chasing that bear down. And now I totally understand I wouldn't let Yogi steal my picnic basket either!
3961729,pjshorthorn,2015-06-13 05:10:00,5654,"Had a number of wildlife experiences over the years in Canada, but a few stand out. - We were on a Lac Seul HB trip and had tied off on a sandy beach. The gangplank was out so we could walk down to the beach for campfires in the evenings. I was cleaning fish on the back deck when I heard crashing noice in the woods. I spotted a black bear making his way down the shoreline towards the HB and I thought oh snap, the gangplank is out!!!! I had to yell at the guys in the hB to throw the plank down on the beach so teh bear couldn't board !!! - We were on 502 when we spotted a moose up ahead standing on the side of the road. We eased up to the moose and the fella riding shotgun rolls down his window when the truck came to a stop and starting talking "" moose"" to the big boy. I would guess the fella was about 4 moose strides from the truck. Apparently the moose took offense to some of the moose talk as it moved towards us. As we pulled away the moose came out onto the road and chased us down 502 for quite a ways. - We were on 502 on a different trip and saw a critter cross the road quite a distance ahead. We slowed down and rolled up to the area we thought was where the animal had crossed and we came up to a very large Lynx. No one had ever seen one before and we weren't quite sure it was a Lynx. The cat didn't like our presence as he he took a big whiz right in front of us. - I stopped in Vermilion Bay Lodge last summer to check out the camp and met V-Bay Gord. That was a wildlife experience but that is for a whole different thread PjShorthorn"
3961777,last chance,2015-06-13 05:31:00,3262,I've had a few over the yrs but i'll only list 2. we were in fl down in the keys camping. there was a dumpster setting under a tree. we watched as these coons walked out on a limb one by one until the limb bent down into the dumpster. one got off the limb and got some food and got back on the limb and they all climbed back up the limb into the tree. on the same camping trip we watched another coon go over to our tent and unzip it and went inside and opened our cooler and took something out and left. we were so amazed watching him that we just let him do his thing.

3961929,wallydave,2015-06-13 07:17:00,2151,"On the last day of a fly-in trip, a bunch of guys were waiting for the fog to clear, the flight was delayed. Joel decided to do some last minute fishing, he cast out a spoon, got a bird's nest on his baitcaster, after he got it untangled he thought he snagged on something. Next thing he knows, the ""snag"" started to run. He reeled in the biggest lake trout of the trip! A guy from another group asked if Joel was going to keep it, he had his limit, so Joel gave this laker away. Because his cooler was full of beer and ice, we all had a beer! So we are having a breakfast beer on the dock, next thing we know, an eagle flies by carrying a laker carcass chased by 4 more eagles! They drive the first eagle into the lake right in front of us!"
3962049,Bill Krejca,2015-06-13 08:21:00,6107,"As many of you know ,blue heron are a somewhat gawky bird in flight - not very graceful, nor agile. We once saw on LOW a bunch of gulls in flight fighting over a fish which one of them was carrying in its beak. The other gulls would make strafing runs at the carrier, but didn't seem to be able to force the fish out of the carrier's beak. This usually can occur when the carrier opens it's beak to try to verbally fend off attackers. Enter a blue heron on the scene, and we watched as it wing-wobbled over to the gull in midflight, and proceeded to latch on to the fish and gawkily (word?) flew away with it's prize. Maybe like a B-29 going after a P-51, if you are familiar with WWII aircraft. Another bird story: Some years ago, we saw an eagle soaring not too high above us while we were out in the boat fishing. Didn't think much about it, and we resumed fishing. Suddenly, we heard a strange noise, almost indescribable, like rushing air. The sound got louder, changing pitch slightly,as noise from an approaching train changes pitch. The sound became louder. Looking up, we saw another eagle dive bombing the one closest to us. The sound was the air rushing as the eagle, wings fully collapsed, beak pointing down, moving straight down like a falling meteor. The bird headed straight for the lower soarer, and it looked like there would be a mid-air collision. The lower bird soared out of the way slightly, as the diver swept past and missed, then quickly opened it's wings, and glided, coming close to becoming water bound. The apparent territory encroacher took off for quieter haunts. As we learned, eagles can get very possessive regarding soaring space. I'll remember that weird noise a long time. Bill"
3962073,HeHooksHimself,2015-06-13 08:48:00,725,"Nothing quite as dramatic as a few of the previous posts, but one time we were coming out of a lake we really like to fish and on to the main lake of our camp. The access is pretty shallow and generally you have to slow up and sometimes move the engine up a notch. That was the case in this instance and as we approached the main lake we see a baby moose swimming perpendicular to our path right in front of us. On the bank to our left was momma moose, so we just put the engine in neutral and watched. She eyed us until baby made the bank and then she crossed in front of us. We did not want to get between momma and junior! Another time as we were almost to camp, we saw what we thought was a beaver swimming across our path. It turns out it was a black bear and we were just watching from a distance when a boat comes speeding out of camp shouting with glee that they saw a bear. They were zooming around it and taking picture after picture when the bear finally made the bank and ambled up into the woods. I wonder how many pictures they took of a bear being harassed?"
3962161,Bluebomber,2015-06-13 09:52:00,29,Great posts guys! A couple of years ago we were fishing in canoe bay right off a small island. My dad was in his boat right by us and here comes a bear swimming to the island we were fishing off of. We where so close I threw a couple little Debbie cosmic brownies on to the island. The bear sits on his butt and has some brownies then wonders into the trees. Not 5 min after this bear goes into the woods on this island that's maybe 3/4 of a acre in size. My buddy is like take me to the island now he had a bathroom emergency. The bear was still some where on the little island. All you could see is my buddies head on a swivel peeking over a boulder while he was doing his business. Of course we where all screwing with him saying the bear was coming.Weird part is a year later fishing the same spot here comes a bear swimming to the same island. Guess he likes cosmic brownies!
3964817,SinOrSwim,2015-06-14 09:44:00,1528,"We were on about our 3rd or 4th fly in. Staying in a motel in Kenora night before. I worked nights so schedule was all messed up. Got up at 5am and went outside to the back of my truck. Heard noise from around the corner of the building. Thinking it was other people, walked over there with just shorts. no shoes. Walk around the corner and there is a BEAR standing up against the dumpster. I was like HOLY..........S$@#$%. it looked at me and I took off running. Through parking lot with no shoes yelling BBEEEAAARRRRRRR Came running into the room slamming the door scaring the crap out of the other dudes sleeping. So, at the cabin later that trip. Guy wakes up at night thinking he heard something on the screened in porch. Whatever, nothing out there. Does it again. Nothing out there go to sleep. Next thing you know SLAMMMM BAAMMMMMMMMM. Sure enough we had left a bag of garbage on teh screened in porch. We go out there and start shining lights into the woods. Perfectly quiet and all you could hear was the quiet sound of aluminum crumpling. Then.........the eyes lit up. Then.......it came into camp. We screamed it ran away. So, 6 of us sitting around the table in the cabin talking about it. Late at night. Next thing you know..........KAABLLLAAAMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!! it broke out the bottom of the screen door to the porch. I have never seen 6 grown men move that fast. Nobody knew what to do. We all ended up in one bedroom huddled together. hahahahhahahaa. Tthat place didn't have indoor toilets. The rest of the trip it didn't matter how much we had had to drink. If someone woke up at 2am to pee. You would hear in a whisper.......I have to pee. Then you would hear........yeah, me too. Then........yeah, I'll go too. Next thing you know all 6 of us on the deck about arms length apart peeing off the deck with our flashlights scanning the woods. Any sounds....= panic. Also one year on a fly-in. Went to cabin to take a nap. Came out and walked down the dock. Seagull jumps out of my boat and one of my rods flips over. Uh oh. Sure enough. I had left my minnow on my hook and it ate it. I called for the other guys. They came down and I was holding my rod. I said see that bird? Yes. I reeled in.........it came in. Everyone started laughing. So, we reel in this seagull and grab it so we can cut the line and possibly remove the hook. We get it undone and my brother (MorganMan) was holding it when all of a sudden the seagull CHOMPED and bit onto his hand. That little webbing between your thumb and your forefinger. LOLOLOLOLOL It wouldn't let go. He didn't want to let go of the bird but it was clamped down on his skin. He was screaming..............OOOOWWWWWWWWW. We were laughing hysterically so really couldn't help him. It let go and one guy walked past laughing The bird reached out and bit him on the shoulder!!!!!! We let the bird go but I am laughing just typing this remembering him screaming when it bit his hand and didn't let go."
3965129,Bluebomber,2015-06-14 12:10:00,29,One year we fished the main lake on lac suel in the morning. Fishing was slow so we came back ate lunch and packed sandwiches for supper. We went down into Vaughn for the evening and fished until about sunset. Right before we left a cow moose and her calf waded out into the water and fed on on submerged plants. So we watched that for awhile and thought that was pretty cool. On our way back came around the point by cherry river heading north. We could see something swimming figured we had enough time to check it out. Pulled up to a timber wolf swimming across the lake it was pretty cool got right next to him he was really moving. Probably got closer than we should have but never harassed him just followed him to the shore. Just a cool sight...
3965538,Nimstug,2015-06-14 16:04:00,2605,"My story in minor compared to then others but it means much in our family. One our second trip to Canada, we were fishing into the evening. My son caught a small pike. He reached into the net when then pike thrashed and drove a treble hook into the his hand. We went to the hospital in Dryden to have the lure removed. On the way back to camp quite late, in the car's headlight we spotted a lynx coming out of the forest. Maybe twice the size of a housecat and pumped up to about 10 psi, we watched this animal sniff around the weeds and cross the road taking his (or her) time. We watched for a good five minutes before then lynx disappeared behind some rocks."
3965594,Paul H,2015-06-14 16:34:00,1232,"No big bear or moose - but these stick in MY mind. All these were in the Gowganda Ontario area fwiw. Was out alone, quiet just working some shoreline, keep hearing splash,splash, come around the point and see branches dropping from a pine overhanging the water. See one of those tiny pine squirrels. It's dropping limbs so small it will not walk on them. They fall in the water and float to shore. He scampers down the tree, grabs them, sometimes wading to get them and drags them up to get those tint pine cones. 4 of us fairly late on small road, moose jumps out right in front of us and must have ran 1/4 mile down the road. Finally jumped off into the bush and gone. Confirmed moose cam do at least 35 for some distance. Small cove - hear some otters that don't seem too concerned. One pops up almost in the trolling motor. He stares at us, chatters, swims around the boar a few times. Was actually getting something ready just in case he wanted to get up close and personal. Have video to prove this one. Had an Osprey eying us from a snag. Tossed a small badly hooked perch over the side. Mr Osprey flew over, made a few circles around the boat then grabbed it about 5 foot from the boat. Had a fox cross the road in front of us, slowed down, it ran up and stared at us, probably the 1st human it ever saw. Turns out there were several pups in a culvert off the road. No fear, could have watched thm for hours."

3980058,IronDioPriest,2015-06-18 19:58:00,96,"This wasn't in Canada, but darn near...When I was in my early 20s I was camping by myself in the extreme Northeastern Arrowhead region of MN. I decided I wanted to watch the world awaken while fishing a tributary stream, so at about 4:45 AM, I began hiking along a deer trail to my spot below a tumbling cascade. The horizon was beginning to brighten as I began, but once I was into the forest, it was like night. Everything but the treetops was in shadows. In for a penny, in for a pound - I wasn't afraid of the dark.It began to gradually lighten a bit as I hiked, and things were beginning to illuminate. I was about 2/3 along the 2 mile trail to my spot, when off to my left a few yards I heard a scrambling in the underbrush, and then a loud scratching noise. By the time I got my wits about me, I realized that the scratching sound was going up...up...up... I looked up to where the noise stopped, and perched high in a tree about 10 yards away from me, hugging the trunk for dear life, was a baby black bear cub, looking right into my eyes. As soon as we made eye contact, he began letting out a loud repeating noise. Waaaaaa... Waaaaa...Waaaaa.I froze solid as I realized what was going on. Before I could form the thought ""mother bear nearby"" I began hearing a rustling in the underbrush just to the other side of the tree where the bear cub was still looking at me and freaking out. I hardly breathed, realizing that since the bears were off to the side of my path, walking back the way I came was no better than continuing on my path. Either way was an equal risk. I froze for about 15 to 30 seconds, afraid to make a move in either direction, until I realized that staying still was not an option. The bear was still in the tree, still freaking out, and the noises in the underbrush turned to a few snuffling noises and grunts.I had enough composure to realize that the mother bear wasn't coming any closer, so I made the decision to continue along the path toward my destination. As I walked, the sounds began to fade, and soon I was at my fishing hole.But I'll tell ya what - I never sat at one fishing hole for so long after the bite died! LOL. I'd say I had decent fishing under that cascade until the sun rose high enough to shine directly into the pool - probably about 9:30 or 10:00 AM. Then the stream trout stopped biting altogether.But I sat at that waterfall until about 4:00PM, until I finally had enough courage to walk the path back to my vehicle. Never saw another sign of them, but did see some evidence of their presence in the spot where I encountered them.Since then I don't walk in the woods alone in the dark without a .357 Magnum."
3969322,bigwillies,2015-06-15 17:30:00,515,"Was heading out to camp one evening. Goin down camp Robinson road after dark and came around a corner to see a calf moose lying in the middle of the road(not a newborn). Just lying there looking around like my dog would in the yard. Pulled right up beside it and rolled down the window and said what the h e double hockey sticks are u doin.just looked at me and didn't move. was only two feet away from my truck. didn't look injured,never figured out why it was doin that."
3969418,fishron,2015-06-15 17:53:00,317,My buddy and I were fishing one of our favorite bays on the Cabonga reservoir. We noticed a 16 foot boat with several people in it come rushing into to bay and stopping at a small almost submerged island a couple of hundred yards away. After a while they left and out of curiosity we motored over to the island. The boat people apparently were native americans who had shot a large moose on the small island. All the usable parts of the animal had been removed. The creepy thing was several of the animals internal organs were floating in the shallow water. Leeches were having a field day on the leftovers. I guess nothing goes to waste in nature.
3970842,northerneyes,2015-06-16 07:51:00,72,"many years ago on a flyin moose hunt I hiked back to a lake that not many humans had seen. I spotted lots of moose tracks close to a beaver dam and decided to sit and watch this area. One beaver was swimming around putting branches onto the dam. He got out and got on top of the dam and watched me for several minutes, weaving his body back and forth as if to try to figure out what I was. After a couple of minutes he jumped back into the water and went and got another beaver. They both got on top of the dam and did the weaving back and forth. It was almost like the first beaver had to get the second beaver to come and take a look and try to figure out what I was. After a while they both jumped back in the water and swam away. I sure I was the first human they had seen."

He picks it up and tosses it into the water and a gull grabs it. Well that was pretty cool he thinks, so he tosses another one in. The gull swoops down and grabs it again. Pretty soon there are 2 gulls flying around so 2 Doritos go into the water. Both gulls start squawking over the food. Next thing we know there are gulls all over the place. It was like a scene out of Finding Nemo. Mine! Mine! MINE!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNiR5ZTb_MA We had to leave the area because of the sounds and danger of being dumped on by the gulls."

3966162,Carnhzkr,2015-06-14 19:55:00,964,"Here are a couple that are relived at every family reunion. I think I've written about each somewhere on WC. Both of these are prime examples of what NOT to do: My parents were camping at their usual spot on the English River. My mom, who would have been in her 70s at the time, left her purse on the steps leading into their fifth-wheel camper so she could go in and use the facility. She stepped out just in time to see a bear ambling off clutching her purse. My elderly parents didn't own a credit card at the time, so the thief was making off with all the cash they had brought for the trip. Without thinking, she ran toward the bear clapping her hands and yelling ""HEY, HEY, HEY"". Luckily, the bear panicked and dropped her purse before scurrying into the bush. That's one tough farm wife. When I was in my twenties, we were camping at the same location as above. One night, we were sitting around a campfire toasting marshmallows when we noticed a pair of eyes shinning out of the trees, and soon saw that it was a skunk. He'd obviously seen people before and didn't seem to be too worried about our presence, so I tossed him a marshmallow. He kept creeping closer and soon I was feeding him marshmallows from the end of my roasting stick. I knew it was a bad idea at the time, but even so, I coaxed the little guy closer and baited him to take the marshmallow from between my fingers. The other couple that was with us thought they needed to record this, so the wife of the couple took out her camera (with flashbulb) and asked me to recreate that moment of man versus nature. I kept telling myself that this was a bad idea. I was sure that the flashbulb would spook the skunk and I'd be scrubbing the stink off me for the rest of the trip, but I was in my twenties and invincible so I extended my arm and called him closer and again, he took the bait from between my fingers. If this had been a sit-com, we'd have all gotten sprayed, but luckily, this was a very mild skunk, and he didn't even seem to notice when the bright flash went off. Somewhere in a shoebox in my parents' attic there's a picture of me feeding a wild skunk a marshmallow out of my hand. Don't ever do that."

On a note to the posters talking about feeding wildlife....it would be much better if you kept wildlife wild by not feeding them. I live in an area dominated by forests and also by cottages. People feeding foxes and raccoons have made them so docile around people that they have gotten way too close to people and have even become aggressive when not fed...as someone with ties to the ministry of natural resources knowing several people who work there, I can tell you that many of these once wild amazing creatures end up being shot. I know it seems harmless at the time. My own daughter coming back from work at night has been literally chased by a fox down our walkway...threatening, maybe not but certainly unnerving."

Boating down to one of our favorite spots in South Islet in LS we turned the corner and here in the water was a Cow moose in the water neck deep feeding on the water plants. So we decided this was as good a place as any to fish and watch the show. She continued to feed not even taking us into consideration, head underwater then coming up chomping away. It was about 5 minutes before we even noticed the small calf nearer shore doing the same thing as mom. The whole thing lasted about 15 more minutes until she got a wiff of our sent, which I'm sure was ""gamey"" and she walked back to shore, gathered her little one and into the woods they went.Heading back to camp one night also on LS my brother pointed to a Black thing floating in the water, I thought it was a stump or something so I slowed down so not to hit it. Turns out it was a Black bear heading for one of the islands. It had a good 300 yd swim ahead of it and was crossing a well traveled route so we decided to give it a protective escort, maintaining proper distance of course, but by the end of the swim we had 5 other boats following along watching. By the time it got to the island it was tuckered out and could hardly drag itself out of the water. It got onto the shore looked back at us, grunted and moved off into the woods."

As a 13 yr old or so myself I was with my dad following two of his friends in another boat going down a small river to another lake on a Quebec fly in trip. We come around a corner and there is a moose swimming along..the other boat pulls up beside the moose and the guy in the bow jumps out onto the Moses back. Didn't go far before the moose dove under and pulled off a few body twists leaving the guy treading water...pretty cool sight. Last one...bbqing near Wawa on a hibatchi...bunch of small steaks. Turned my head and went just a few feet away to grab my beer. Was on a picnic table by a beach...lake superior prov. park...anyhow dang seagull takes off with a steak in its mouth...more humorous for my wife who watched me chasing it down the beach throwing sticks and stones at it. Ok, one more. Took a girlfriend and her city friend for a day canoe trip into Famed Algonquin Park in late spring. From some cow-calf surveys I had been involved with the previous week I knew there was moose on a particular island. I got out and had them paddle to the far end of the small island...idea was that I would passively scare the moose to the far end where the girls would get a good look. Unfortunately the moose were so close to where I got out that I startled them. Came face to face with the cow who put every hair upright on her neck (and my head), swung around and charged me. I don't remember climbing the tree but moments later I was ten feet up a leaning cedar tree looking down at the retreating moose...then I retreated in the opposite direction."

It was like a clip from a National Geographic film. They were diving at each other and at one point they connected and clung to one another. At one point they were spinning around as they cruised toward the ground. It was quite a spectacle."
3963449,northerneyes,2015-06-13 18:48:00,72,On a flyin moose hunt our group had one bull tag. One in the party filled that tag so we couldn't take any more Bulls. We still had cow tags. One night one of the hunters failed to show up that night. After waiting for several hours we thought something must have happened to him so we went looking for him. We found him up a tree with a big bull moose not letting him come down. We were able to scare the bull off and allow the guy to get down. He had been treed about 6 hours by the moose.

I yelled for my brother to come out with a flashlight. That bear stayed there about a minute and then came flying down ....crapping all the way down! No one believed us till we showed them the big pile of fresh crap at the base of the tree!"

3964617,Elrik,2015-06-14 09:00:00,82,"Out in algonquin on a canoe trip with my mom when i was 18. We were daytripping from our campsite and had gone up a small river. Shortly after entering the river we had an escort of a whole family of river otters. They played all around us for a good half hour while we drifted and occasionally paddled along the river. Great memory. even though i live in canadas biggest city, our house is steps away from a large wilderness area and we have a lot of hawks, turkeys, deer, rabbits, foxes and coyotes in our area. Until a recent injury i used to run a lot and had lots of great encounters with most of these critters. Running around dawn one morning on a road near our house, i came to a four way stop ueading west. In the middle of the road at the north section of an intersection there was a fox stopped. He sat there and watched me run past, once i was though the intersection i turned to watch him saunter through the intersection and continue his way south. Nicely following the rules of the road! Another time taking a path through the park behind my house i watched a hawk swoop down and snatch a squirrel from right in front of me. A few days later i saw a man with his yorkie off leash and i warned him the hawks may find it fair game! Another time i was running along the wilderness trail on top of the bluffs overlooking lake ontario. The trail is mulch so you are really quite quiet on it. I turned a corner to where an old apple tree is and found myself just a few feet from a deer that had been feeding on the fallen apples. We stared at each other for a good 5 minutes before i slowly passed and left her to her apples."

It was my girlfriend's, at the time, (now wife, I found a keeper!) first fishing trip ever and we were fishing on Minnitaki at our super secret Bass spot. The first spot we go to on our annual trip. My dad and I were in the zone, casting crank baits and spinners over the granite rocks, on a picturesque NW Ontario June morning looking to catch the first footballs of the trip. My wife whispers to us that she sees a bird in the middle of the lake, my dad and I are zoned in and lightly dismiss this as a rookie first seeing a loon or pelican or something of this nature. We don't even give it a second look and continue zipping Mepps #3 spinners across the pristine lake. A minute later she mentions again that the bird is getting closer, I make a sideways glance to see what she is talking about and to humor her. I look out in the distance and see what appears to be two birds swimming together, but I did agree with her that it was a bit unusual. Anyways we continue back to fishing. A minute late I glanced back at the birds and they had gotten closer, close enough to where I could begin to make out what it was we were looking at. I have pretty decent vision (hearing is another story) and could see that we were not looking at a couple of birds but a full grown moose swimming across Minnitaki (a huge body of water) what we thought were bird's wings flapping were the moose's ears flipping about to keep water from getting in. The moose eventually made it to the shore we were fishing and trudged in to the woods like nothing happened. Anyways this memory made the trip incredibly memorable and is something I hope to never forget! I have days where I have caught 100 walleye but I will forget eventually, but the memory of my wife seeing her first moose I will always cherish."

In the not too far distance we saw a black bear swimming, chasing a moose. The bear chased the moose all the way from Knoche to the nearest shore south of Knoche. The distance must have been a good half mile or so. At times the bear seemed to be gaining on the moose and might half been successful had he caught it in the water. The moose stumbled a couple of times trying to climb out on the rocky bank. The Bears was about 50 feet away when the moose got up on the bank. Once the moose was on land, the bear gave up.We have had several interesting bear encounters over the years and several moose encounters, but never a bear / moose encounter like this.Frank"
