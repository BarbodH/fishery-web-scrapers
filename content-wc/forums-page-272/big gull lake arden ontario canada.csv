1331416,grandpa jack,2011-07-19 04:55:00,8,"The fishing stunk for the first week in July but the weather was superb.I caught 1 16"" wally for the week. My friend who was next door caught 4 eyes so we pooled them together with some smallies & perch so my wife prepared a nice fish dinner in the middle of the week.I used night crawlers & leeches & tryed jigging,trolling,drifting & casting in deep & shallow water & flatlining with stickbait near & after dark- nada.My 8 yr old granddaughter had the best time making new friends,fishing,swimming & she was named tuber of the week to.Oh, she loves feeding my peanuts to those chipmunks to.I ran the 4 specie tournament again this year & the 3lb. 4 oz. largemouth was the heaviest.We had two hours of rain the whole week & I was out in little gull when it hit with some good size hail.Please let me know how you guys do fishing & good luck.I don't know where Blueberry Island is or the wall, can you help me out yellow kayak.

3988354,Jack Holton,2015-06-22 10:13:00,1,"Wondering if anyone has a fishing report from Big Gull Lake. My wife, grand kids & myself will be there the week of 6/27/15. I run a fishing contest that week & want to get a jump on everyone (just kidding). Any help would be appreciated. Thanks! Grandpa Jack"
3990666,Ferrispata,2015-06-23 05:21:00,63,Only thing I have heard is that the water is low. Hopefully that will get a little better by the time we go for our annual walleye trip in mid Sep. Let us know how the fishing is.
3991490,maddogg,2015-06-23 08:38:00,178,I read most of these posts and I can't believe any one would return to fish there again. There are so many great places to fish in Canada why throw good money after bad.
3992170,Ferrispata,2015-06-23 11:37:00,63,"We go there for a few different reasons. This Sep. will be our 4th or 5th year so we are still learning the spots. Each year we go back we find a spot or 2 more that produces some walleye. We get most of 3 days of solid fishing for 4-5 of us (of varying degrees of skill) and we get ~25-30 walleye; not to mention a decent number of smallies. We also stay at the same place each year (Kirk Kove Cottages) and Jim and Claire are very nice folks. Plus we want a place within a decent distance from the 1000 Island Bridge and Big Gull is.Some year we may try another place in the same general region (<3 hr from bridge), but then we would have to relearn the new lake. But some year we will. Last year we skipped Big Gull to go on our first fly-in trip to Lac Hebert in Quebec where the fishing is on quite a different level (both size and number). It could be tough coming back to Big Gull.Ferris"
1210335,grandpa jack,2010-06-15 13:23:00,8,"That would be great Roggs.I will give a report on my week up there also from July 3-10.Lets keep this post active with info, it really helps."
1217862,Guest,2010-07-10 17:33:00,0,"Was up to the lake over the 4th, the walleyes were hitting well in the morning around 8:00 am and 8:00 pm. All of them were caught between 22 and 28 feet of water."
1221201,grandpa jack,2010-07-21 08:23:00,8,"Well the walleyes did co-operate a little better this year than last.I got 6 for the week & my grandson caught 2. My friend next door in cottage 5 got around a dozen between him & his wife.We had a nice fish fry on wed night thanks to my wife.We got most of them jigging with either a leech or worm on structure points or the mouth of bays in 14-20 ft. A very light bite. I can't wait till next year & neither can my friend after his first year at Camp's Bay.Don't leave walleyes on stringers off the dock,even during the day.A snapper ate my friends 21"" & my 17"" walleye.The 21"" was already weighed for my 4 specie fishing contest at 2lbs-12 oz & was in the lead until he caught a 24 1/2"" at 4lbs 3oz on Friday so eat your heart out snapper.How about some more reports."
1221973,Guest,2010-07-24 06:23:00,0,Thanks for the fishing report. Lesson learned about snappers taking fish tied to dock about a decade ago. How was Camp's Bay this year & what was the general situation with price increases and more rules? Topic of discussion on this thread points toward many long-time customers being pushed to consider another place due to those issues & more.
1225205,Guest,2010-08-04 20:12:00,0,"Looking for recent fishing report for Big Gull Lake, Arden Ontario. Leeches, minnows or night walkers? How about a hot lure color?"
1312941,grandpa jack,2011-05-31 08:00:00,8,Does anyone have any fishing reports from Big Gull yet. MY wife & I are sure looking forward to bringing our 8 yr old Granddaughter up there the first full week in July. She loves to swim & if its as hot as it was last year we will be in the lake a lot.We haven't had a nice wally dinner in a long time so we are looking forward to it.What to use & where to go would help a lot. I'll give a report when we get back. GJ
1325678,scouterbill,2011-07-03 22:25:00,2,"Have you tried 1) the Wall, 2) the Stepping Stones, 3) the drop off near Blue Berry Island (families would meet for lunch there), 4) the underwater spring near Island with lake, 5) up from Stell-Roys almost across from Kirk's there is and island off P. Point try eastern tip. The family group always went the last two weeks of July. So who owns Newton's, Stella and Roy's, and Kirk's?"
1326035,Guest,2011-07-05 08:20:00,0,"Hi Grandpa Jack, We'll be up at Camp's Bay during the second week of August! I look forward to your fishing report... I've had limited success in the last several years on Big Gull, but haev BIG expectations for this year! :-) Cheers!"
1326333,scouterbill,2011-07-05 21:03:00,2,"Is that Stel-Roys old cottages? Big Gull is the deepest we ever fished for walleyes. Each boat use to have at least one with lead core line. Best I can remember was the thermocline layer around 24ish feet. Things you might try...They had the best luck with very slow moving Helin Floating Flatfish. 3 way rig. The Wall, beware there used to be 40 plus inch muskies.The underwater spring then try a bright yellow / black maribou jig. Watch the Stepping Stones it shallows between them but try to stay in contact with the bottom.Only two of us left from the 1950-60s .. might go back next year .. bill"
1327434,Guest,2011-07-08 10:18:00,0,"What's the latest fishing report? Early Aug. trip - what should we stock up on/what color? More than a dozen fishermen in camp that week, at least 6 started in the 1950's. Now on the 3rd generation. Big Gull Lake still beautiful, other changes questionable."
1129659,grandpa jack,2009-08-18 11:28:00,8,"Thanks for the report from your August trip dkratz.Was there any thing in particular that worked for you.I'm glad you were successful.How many & what size if I'm not being to nosy.August was always better fishing for us to but we can't get the cottage we want then.The new regs for eyes tellme it wasn't what it once was but we love it there at Camp's Bay.I caught 9 on a lake near me a couple weeks ago with 5 under 15"" & 4 right on it.It didn't take long to eat em up.GJ"
1129880,Guest,2009-08-19 07:22:00,0,"Hello, Just returned from Big Gull spent 4 days at our cottage on the east end. Most of the time was spent Bass fishing did really well caught a nice 4 lb smallie and 3 lb largemouth. Got a bunch of 1.5 - 2 lb as well. I was with a few 19 year old boys that think bass fishing is better than walleye, I can't convince them any different. I went out yesterday morning for an hour and got a nice 2lb on a curlytail jig tipped with a small piece of worm, if I had more time I know they were there. Got it in about 15-20 ft. of water. Was talking to a guy who lives on the lake he said the Canadian DEC were out about a week ago stocking the lake with walleye all along the south east shoreline. He also said the best bite is end of October in shallow water, I've never had luck at that time but I was always fishing deeper. Great to read these post, thanks. Fran"
1130732,Guest,2009-08-22 14:37:00,0,"I have been fishing gull lake since I was a baby, now I'm in my 50s. The lake changes year to year but worm harness seems to always work. We make our own and this is half the fun. Orange, chartruse (yellow) and pink are good colors. We have used rapalas, but they are too expensive to loose. Last year we caught walleyes close to the shore line, this year they were deep. June is a nice month, its hard to find a cabin in July and August. Any month is good at gull lake, I would go back next week if I could!!!"
1138723,Guest,2009-09-27 16:27:00,0,"I am going to Big Gull Lake for the first time with some guys who have had some success but not alot. I have fished for Walleye a tremendous amount in Lake Vermillion in Minnesota. Can someone provide me with some points of interest and types of baits and lures. In Minnesota we used worm harness and minnows along with trolling some runners, colors were perch looking chartuse, crawfish looking. Going second week of October 2009 and could use some good ideas. thanks"
1139219,Guest,2009-09-29 19:55:00,0,Anyone that will respond. It is my first time fishing Big Gull lake and will be there second week of October. Can someone provide some points or places to fish. The guys I am going with have been there several times but in my opinion are not that up on fishing and are just glad to be there. I on the other hand want to catch some fish and make it worth my while and am willing to work for them. Any help on points of interest and were to fish would be appreciated.
1204293,grandpa jack,2010-05-26 18:10:00,8,"HI MAC-ATTACK I was wondering if I could get you to give me a walleye lesson on Big Gull.My wife,I ,grandson & daughter will be up there the first week in July & I'm excited already.I haven't been able to provide a walleye dinner in two years & I'm embarassed. I would love it if we could hook up.Last year I got a big fat zero.I'm close to 70 but I don't give up easy.Please let me know.GJ"
1204454,Guest,2010-05-27 07:19:00,0,"Don't feel alone...out trip last year was tough fishing for the walleye as well. Big Gull is always a challenge. This year will be different from last, that much you can count on. I have repeatedly stocked up on the hot bait from the year before only to find that it's worthless this year. Our crew of fishermen hit the water at day break every morning we're there, then again every evening till after dark, with a few mid-day trips as well. Basically every year something different works. Have your tackle box stacked with different lures and color combo's. Give something 30 minutes....if no luck, try something else. We have been guilty of going over the same water time and again thinking it's simply a matter of needing to be there at the right moment to produce....it's hard to try something different when you've been successful for years at a given spot, but leave it and try some new areas. For those that wonder why we fish there? It's the people and the beautiful location. We have gone there for 20 years and it is like a family reunion for us....the same families are there on the same week we are. Many wonderful friendships and memories. Good luck Gramps and for what it's worth..... I think it'll be the yellow Dixie Spinner/crawler combo on bottom bouncer that does the trick. Or maybe pink...or chartruse....or...."
1204719,Guest,2010-05-27 18:51:00,0,I love Camp's Bay and Big Gull Lake. I have been going there for 37 years since I was 3. While change is nice I hate all of the new convienences theyre adding to the cottages. This year internet and next digital tv! That's not why people go there. It is my rejuvenation place. A place to get close to nature. I love taking my kayak there especially taking it back to Deer Lake. Fishing is good too!
1204936,Guest,2010-05-28 11:22:00,0,"We're lukewarm with the modernization of Camps Bay as well. I first started going there in the 1960's when it was a real fishing camp and the Hilliards owned it. We all have begun to wonder if the current owner really wants the fishing crowd there anymore....it seems to be evolving into something other than what it started out to be...now it's kind of yuppiezed and leans more towards being a resort than a fishing camp. Change is tough for us old timers. Yet we go still every year. So many memories, and the rest of the crew of families that are there the same week we are have become like family over time. Guess we'll grit it out until they price us out of range or become too overbearing with the list of rules. All the folks there, those families that have been coming there for many years, scratch their heads over the direction CB has taken. Who the heck goes to a beautiful lake for a vacation and wants internet and a TV? Give me a campfire and a cold brew anytime."
1209582,Guest,2010-06-12 20:31:00,0,"I was up to the lake over Memorial Day and the walleyes were still shallow in about 9-12 feet. If i make it up before the 4th and have some luck locating them, I will let you know what depth they are at. The warm weather and the recent rains are likely to turn the lake over."
1118763,grandpa jack,2009-07-06 09:56:00,8,has anyone been fishing this lake in 2009. I just got back from a week at camp's bay & the fishing was horrible for walleyes & even the brown carp.Any reports or info would be appreciated.We will be there again next year for another shot at it. I can't beleive I didn't catch an eye the whole week. Good luck if you go there. It is a beautiful place but to much rain there last week also.GJ

1123792,Guest,2009-07-25 11:19:00,0,We fished big Gull Lake in June and the fishing was tough. We caughe 6 walleys the whole week. Going back the in August. We usally do real good in August. I hope the weather is good. Less rain!
1123893,bardern,2009-07-26 04:58:00,28,"we have been hit with really crappy weather, it has rained 27 of the last 31 days, which I guess you found out. I fish the area quite a bit as we have a cottage on Shabomeka and with all the rain and cold weather it has really affected the fishery in a bad way. Big Gull is usually lights out but if you are in the area try Kashawakimak or Skootamata.Oh, and we take it personal when someone calls our Smallies Brown Carp!"
1124338,Guest,2009-07-27 22:46:00,0,"The weather was too unsettled this past month. Best to go for the Bass this time of year, but even we had no luck to windy, rainy and wind changing all the time. It was not a good July. Back in late August, hope the weather settles"
1129002,Guest,2009-08-15 11:49:00,0,"Came back from my trip to gull lake today. The fishing was good and the weather was hot, no rain. We caught walleyes in 25 feet of water near Kirks cove and in the east bay area. The bass were really hitting and the sun fish had a good time stealing worms. I don't see the the Nothern pike like I use to at Gull Lake. I can't wait to go back next year."
