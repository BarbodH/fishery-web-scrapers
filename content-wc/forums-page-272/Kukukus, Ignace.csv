3951033,Zachbuss,2015-06-09 16:57:00,14,"Could anyone please give me a report of the road going to Kukukus in the last year or so? We will be heading up to Ignace in couple weeks and wanted to try getting on that lake for few days. Has anyone gone threw Dome Lake and follow the river into Kukukus before if the road is bad at the end? I would appricate any advice at all. We will be taking 2 14ft Lunds so don't need a access to unload boats. We been fishin all the littler lakes in the area for few years now and want to try somthing different with more water. Also has anyone heard of a Lake called Mitt Lake..from what the local told my dad 20 years ago it was great walleye lake..pretty sure it end of Barrel Lake where narrows down and opens back up.Thanks, Zach"
3953905,back357,2015-06-10 12:29:00,106,"So, with the water being a bit down this year, I would suspect that the road to the north end is in good shape. I've been up that way before where the water was so high and being held up by beaver dams up to my truck window. I am not sure exactly where there is a landing on the south end that you can get your own boats in but would love to hear about it. If you can get to Dome, the pass from there to Kukukus is fine. As far as Mitt, I always hear good things about it. I've only fished it once about three years ago and the bite was not great on that day. Depends on when you are going I guess. It is a bit shallower lake. Not very big at all. You can't get from Mitt to Barrel (too bad) because Barrel is a great lake for Smallmouth, Pike, and Walleye."
3954241,dukntz,2015-06-10 16:37:00,11,We'll be on Kukukus 20-27th. I'll give you a report on my return.
3954537,Zachbuss,2015-06-10 17:56:00,14,Thanks for the info ..really appricate it. After talking so some ppl think we gonna camp on Arethusa and then fish there some. Then maybe go to Kukukus if aren't doing good or somthing differnent to do.Ya I would love the road report and appricate it ..but we might also be up there then. If weather looks good we are gonna head up the 24th or 25th. Either way I can't wait!!
3955505,back357,2015-06-11 07:27:00,106,"If you are going to camp on Arethusa, then make your way over to Flatrock as well. I could probably fish those two lakes alone all week. I will be fishing the 14th - 19th. I will post a report when I return."
3956233,Zachbuss,2015-06-11 10:13:00,14,Thanks..That be awsome if ya did. I read some good stuff about both them lakes so somthing differnent to try..and have enough water to play around on then. You ever fish for northerns on Arethusa? We normal go to square lake for them..but now with new vechiles we refer not to plow back in the brush to get into it.
3989226,back357,2015-06-22 14:36:00,106,"So, I told you I would report back, and here I am. Went to three lakes last week - Mitt, Kukukus, and Healthwalt. Mitt and Heathwalt are shallow and the most success we found was at or in windblown points and bays that were about 68 degrees water temp and we seemed to be hitting them in anywhere from 6 - 8 feet in the bays and 10 feet on the points that were near shallow water. Temps were mid 60s during the day. Only had one day of really bad rain, the rest had scattered sun and clouds and steady wind - nothing that would produce white caps. Mitt and Heathwalt were great. Good numbers, good sizes, very fun. Kukukus was hit or miss (fished it 3 days). That lake normally produces like crazy, so I am not exactly sure what was going on. I will tell you that time of day meant a ton this year. More than any other I can remember. 3 o'clock seemed to be the bewitching hour on Kukukus. Found fish on the South End in windblown bays, but not in historically great spots. Very strange. I also saw a lot of boats this year which is a first. Normally on Kukukus, you can go all day without seeing anyone. Healthwalt was really good, but tough to get to. Long drive from Ignace. Overall, just a great trip. Claude over at Agimak Lake Resort in Ignace was a gracious host as usual. If any of you ever need a place to stay, that is the one."
3991042,Zachbuss,2015-06-23 07:10:00,14,Thanks for the update. I appreciate it...we are takin off in the morning and gonna fish till Sunday. Our game plan is go back into Flat Rock and camp the first couple days and see how fishing is. If really slow were gonna start hitting closer lakes to the road. A older local use to brag up Mitt to my dad 20 years ago. When my dad fished it....it was already mid summer so maybe was to hot for the lake. Does Mitt have a decent boat acess?
3992322,back357,2015-06-23 12:17:00,106,"Access to Mitt is fine. Nice landing. Need to park up the hill, but very nice. If you're good with a trailer, I would suggest backing down the hill. You can turn around down near the landing, but it takes a bit of work."
