3980506,Skyraptor,2015-06-19 05:58:00,291,"Can't make it this year up to Ghost River.I did go there last October for a fall fishing/moose hunt. It was great. Ended up harvesting a nice 47"" bull and had great fall fishing to boot. Have too many weddings and a class reunion this year plus the wife wants to save for a Cancun trip in February. Plan on it next summer. My two brothers will be at Ghost River starting July 3rd for a week of fishing. For this year I will have to live my fishing by reading trip posts on here. Good luck and have fun on your trip to Kearns. Give us a report when you come back."
