3973474,Bluebomber,2015-06-16 23:43:00,29,If you've fished Canada I'm sure this has happened to you. Bringing in a eye and a tank pike smashes it. We've got a lot of them up to the boat to get a look at them. We usually have spoon rigged up on a gator rod and had a few let go of the eye and smashed the spoon as it's being jigged.Just wondering about any go to lures in that situation? Would like hook up with a better percentage of those fish. We usually end up getting our biggest pike jigging for eyes. Think I should look into some Muskie jigs? Just hate to get hung up with a 10$ jig and 80# line...
3973482,Bluebomber,2015-06-16 23:49:00,29,Here's a 43in tank my buddy got 2 years ago on 6# line and 1/8 oz jig. One week and 3hr till we leave... CANT WAIT!!!!
3973538,Mike Borger,2015-06-17 03:26:00,1554,"I always have a med/hvy spinning rod in the boat rigged with a soft plastic that I can pitch out to pike that follow in but don't commit.Some of my favorites are 8"" reapers, 6-8"" musky grubs and a variety of different 6"" plastic swimbaits.Lots of colors work but I'm partial to white. Sometimes these plastics are rigged on appropriate sized jig heads, sometimes on lightly weighted or unweighted swimbait hooks. Sometimes a dead slow presentation where the bait just hangs there is what they want."
3979530,1K1MOA,2015-06-18 16:23:00,90,"A technique I have used successfully on follows of Walleyes by big pike is a large Jitterbug about 4"" long. Yes, a surface bass lure with the big flat steel piece in the front! Toss it out 10', bring it back and then figure 8 with it. It splashes and gurgles on the surface, at a very slow retrieval speed, and will bring a strike that could scare your buddy right out of the boat! Just make sure your drag isn't too tight, or you may be fishing for the rod. I should also mention I use a small piece of wire from the nose to the treble hook. A large pike can rip the treble hook off the body."
3982538,reconssd,2015-06-19 19:26:00,147,Thanks for the tips. I never thought of having a rod set up with plastics as a quick stand by. Although I'm probably one of the few anglers who have NEVER had a pike hit a walleye as I'm bringing the walleye to the boat. I don't think I've ever had a pike follow it in either. Perhaps it will happen this year.
3983274,pjshorthorn,2015-06-20 06:27:00,5654,"Oh, it will eventually happen to you too. Years ago my son and I were fishing a narrows on Lac Seul, anchored up, and jigging for walleyes. During one morning we both had occasions where after an initial strike, we would have a sudden run of line being peeled off and then ........snap. After the second time, I realized what was going on....big northern. After lunch my son wanted to go back out to the same spot to try and catch the BIG ONE. Same scenario....the son hooks a 15"" walleye and as he is reeling it in I saw a northern peel off some timber. It struck the walleye and swallowed it head first. We were fishing UL rods so it was quite the circus with clearing gear off the deck, pulling the anchor and then coaching a 13 year old through an almost impossible chance of landing the fish while he played ""ring around the rosie"" fighting the fish. Thankfully, he did an outstanding job and landed the northern. The coolest part was that the walleye was still alive when we got it out of the northern and she swam away pretty quick. At the time, it was the largest northern ( 40"") that anyone in our group had boated in Canada as we never really fished for northern.To the point of the OP, I got in the habit of having other baits rigged up as well. In many trips fishing saltwater, we would hook a mahi mahi or a cobia and there would be another fish following as part of their normal ""schooling"" tendencies. An ambassadeur 6500 or 7000 on a MH rod is a blast to catch following fish. I've had smaller northern do the same thing in shallower water. Plastics are good choices with big curly tails or Storm Swim baitsThanks for asking the question. It reminded me that I need to remember to have a rod ready this year.PjShorthorn"
3983290,Draco1206,2015-06-20 06:33:00,175,Yeah it's pretty cool to have a large pike grab your walleye and try to swim off with it. If I am walleye or pike fishing I always have a second rod set up for follows similar to what Mike Borger has recommended. You can almost always get a pike to hit that follows your lure in by dropping a jig and twister tail over the side. White is what I've found works best also.
3983858,Bluebomber,2015-06-20 09:53:00,29,Thanks for the input. I'm definitely going to go pick up a Muskie jig or two and some swimmers. We've had pike hit our walleyes almost every year. Except years that a big cold front came through. One year my uncle was gonna net a nice eye for my cousin and a big pike jumped right into the net. Cousin ended up grabbing the eye.
3986594,reconssd,2015-06-21 16:47:00,147,"PJS and Draco - Thanks for the feedback. I'm definitely going to have a rod set up with either a swim bait or big twister tail that's ready to go at all times. I've seen some videos on YouTube, and have heard countless stories of monster pike hitting walleyes. I've been going to Canada for twenty years and maybe this will be the year!"
