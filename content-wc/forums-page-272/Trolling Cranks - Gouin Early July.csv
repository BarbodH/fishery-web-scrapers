3980882,smallcal,2015-06-19 08:28:00,119,"In the process of organizing my gear for our annual trek north to the Gouin. We fish out of Baie du Nord and have had good luck with pulling crawler harnesses in the past. Couple of years ago we ran out of worms on the last day and had a great day trolling cranks. Planning to do more of that this year. In the past, fish have been at 10-12 fow but each year is different. I've got a list of lure below, with some questions:- any other lures you would take along or suggestions which you would start with or which should be left at home? - How about using a snap weight in front of, say, an HJ12 to get it good and deep?- Colors on the tannin stained water? Have the usual firetiger, perch, blue/silver, black/silver, some purpledescents, and some of the new UV greens and yellows (obviously not in every lure type), any I'm missing.1. Shad Rap #5 and #72. Husky Jerks - #12 and #143. Deep Husky Jerks - #10 and #124. Deep Tail Dancers - #9 and #115. Reef Runners - 600 and 8006. Salmo Hornets - shallow and deep - #57. Salmo Bullheads8. Smithwick Rogues9. Hot-n-Tots - #5 and #710. X-Rap Magnums - 5, 10, 1511. Flat Raps - #8 and #1012. Smash Shad #713. Flicker Shad #5 and #714. Flicker Minnow #915. Minnow Rap #9 and #1116. X-Rap Shad #6 and #8Any suggestions appreciated. And, yes, we drive all of the way in so no weight limit. That may be a big part of my problem!Any help is appreciated. Thank you."

I had a solid red hot n tot on and took the rod in my hand and I would pull the bait forward a little fast then drop my rod back. I started catching fish on the drop. and ended up out fishing my buddies that were using rod holders for there rods. so it doesn't hurt to switch things up some when fishing cranks.
3982178,maddie,2015-06-19 16:30:00,42,I have fished gouin in the past and i think you could narrow your lure selection to hot n tots and flicker shads . A selection of colors is best based on weather etc. you must have gold hot n tots and perch colored flicker shads .I have a friend who only fishes gold hot n tots and some days he outfishes the rest of us searching for that magic lure.

We used lures like Deep Thunder Stick in various green colors and we did well on walleyes to about 23"". Was a nice break from jigging early and late on the bluebird days, and the women thought it was fun to catch fish this way, just have to wait for the bite and reel them in. Never figured out why the walleye were in there feeding like that, but worked the two times we tried it."
