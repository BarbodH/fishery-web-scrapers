3989826,Gregking,2015-06-22 19:19:00,2658,"I use both, a bottom bouncer and spinner rig and jigs Why bb and spinner rig? To cover territory and see if the want some action Why jigs? Because sometimes they want something a little slower and if I can land on a hole I love jigging. Rocks are a bytch on lindy rigs. Heck they are tough on bb. I always have both because you just never know."
3990378,Aspencreek,2015-06-22 21:33:00,2911,"Actually pretty simple, I just pinch a larger split shot or a couple (large enough to get it to the bottom) on the line about 2' above the floater. It doesn't snag because it is so small and I can still feel the bite, tail hook the minnow too, so it is struggling against the jig."
3990954,pjshorthorn,2015-06-23 06:48:00,5654,"I use a similar rig setup with a floater. The only difference is that I use an egg sinker above a swivel. The egg sinker tends to slide up the line if it is in rocks or timber and lessens the chance of snagging.......The downside is if you want to change weights, you either have to retie or have more than one rod rigged up. Aspencreek's setup works too and is quicker to change weights. I just found that a fixed weight can get snagged a little more frequently. PjShorthorn"
3987274,fisher_i_am,2015-06-21 20:37:00,498,"Fishing Ontario mid july, focus on mid lake humps. Lindy rigs or jigs... And why?"
3987354,clearis,2015-06-21 21:31:00,47,"Jigs. They're easier to work around rocks. If you're in NW Ontario, you'll be in rocks. Use a jig for the fish on the bottom. I also use a deep and shallow crank bait on a school to get those that are suspended. The crank bait will also pick up pike.Sent from my SAMSUNG-SGH-I537 using Tapatalk"
3987434,Aspencreek,2015-06-21 22:23:00,2911,Actually I use both depending on the bottom structure. If I'm in big rocks and boulders then jigs. Mud or sand flats and humps I use a floating jig head with minnow or 1/2 nightcrawler with a heavy split shot about 2' above it. Cast it out let it settle and drag it back real slow or drift each.
3987609,BornToFish,2015-06-22 04:37:00,1224,"I tend to view my presentations to walleyes as being either horizontal or vertical. Horizontal presentations feature lures that are primarily moving horizontally through the water - e.g. Lindy rigs, Carolina rigs, split shot rigs, or bottom bouncers. Rigs can be presented by casting, drifting, back-trolling, etc.. Vertical presentations move primarily vertically in the water column - e.g. vertical jigging a minnow. Obviously, jigs can be cast out and retrieved horizontally, just as well as vertically jigged. I tend to use jigs when fishing the sides of rock humps as the lure can be maintained in the strike zone at all times. I back-troll while vertically jigging. I always have the boat positioned so that my jig is at or slightly above the depth of water that is holding fish. I very seldom use a horizontal presentation when targeting fish on the sides of rock humps as the lure generally zips through the strike zone too quickly. I generally use rigs when fishing water with a mostly flat bottom - e.g. the tops of many rock humps, flats or weed edges. I can cover water to locate fish, while keeping my lure in the strike zone nearly the entire time. So, to answer your question about jigs versus rigs, it depends on the type of structure or water that you want to investigate. I would pick the technique that will maximize the time that the lure will be in the strike zone. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3987769,KM1,2015-06-22 06:31:00,374,"for us...on LOTW...jigs were great. However, last season, for whatever reason, jigs where NOT the ticket. We were MUCH more successful with bouncing smiley blades and death hooks...and Lindy Rigs (which can be difficult in snag infested waters). It might take a little more focus to use Lindy's....but when bouncing wasn't producing real well...Lindy's seemed to turn the fish on. Jigs...not so much last season...but you never know."
3987785,bigwalleye1,2015-06-22 06:37:00,2632,"I'm with Born, above. I use primarily jigs, and fish heavy and move fast. I find jigs to be the ultimate short lindy rig. The whole walking sinker thing, for me, in Canada, is too much finnesse. I figure I can finnesse fish at home. I find the bite generally very strong on jigs, and try to fish them as vertically as I can. The jigging motion often turns into a hookset motion."
3988754,fishman10,2015-06-22 12:10:00,226,I'm a structure fisherman and use bottom bouncers and spinner rigs. I watch my lcr and work the bouncer over the reefs etc. always having contact with my bouncer on the bottom. Deadly effective
3988826,Manitou,2015-06-22 12:51:00,125,"Lindy rigs get caught in the rocks easily it seems.I prefer them for still or shore fishing.Jigs and bottom bouncers.I also troll plugs behind bottom bouncers until you hit an active fish, then slow down and target the area with jigs."
3989298,Lab Lover,2015-06-22 15:04:00,34,"Aspencreek, could you explain your split shot and floating jig set up a little more? Are you using a lindy style sinker and long leader, then putting the split shot on the leader? Thanks for the help."
3989786,KM1,2015-06-22 19:09:00,374,"Lindy's CAN get snagged a lot, unless you are really good with them. Just takes time. Seldom used up in Canada...I find the technique out fishes others...that is when bouncers and jigs aren't working as well as we expect. But then again...it depends on your expectations, conditions, size and amount of fish you are looking to catch. Oh, and we use them control drifting and slow trolling all the time...using bow electric...or back kicker when waves and wind start to kick up pretty good. The only negative, for us, is that, typically, it is a slower technique...compared to bouncing."
