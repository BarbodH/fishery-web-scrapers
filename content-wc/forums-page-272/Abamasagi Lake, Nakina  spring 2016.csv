How was the cabin? How was the boats and motors? What the fishing was like when you where there? How was the fishing around the cabin? Any and all info. would be greatly appreciated. P.S. I have spoken to Mike Borger and read his report about his trip which was during the summer but am looking for some input about the spring fishing. ""apples vs apples"" kind of thing. Thank you Ziggyzag"
