3991034,SinOrSwim,2015-06-23 07:06:00,1528,I cam back years ago from a trip and my lab was fine when I left. He could barely walk when I got back. Sure enough. Lymphoma. Doc said we could treat but it was very advanced. Decided to put him down rather than treat and him be in pain. Thsi was back before debit cards. I couldn't even write my check. I had to have the lady at the desk write the check I was a wreck.
3991106,Draco1206,2015-06-23 07:24:00,175,I am truly sorry to hear about your dog. I'm having a hard time writing this because I'm tearing up thinking about all the dogs I've lost over the years and of the two I have now that I will lose someday. I always say to myself this will be the last one because it is so hard to take when you lose your best friend. But after a few months I always realize I can't live without a dog and a new puppy always takes the pain away. Dogs never live long enough. Enjoy your new puppy.
3991306,Juls,2015-06-23 07:51:00,13414,"Sorry for your loss... Enjoy your new puppy!! New dogs don't take the place of old dogs. The old dog always has that one special spot in your heart forever, that is only his/hers. And, while it feels now that there is a big hole where that spot is, over time, it fills back up with the love and memories you had for him. They forever walk by your side, in spirit. Your heart is big enough to love many dogs over your lifetime....kudos to you for giving another dog a loving home and place in your heart."

I got the news via my inReach Thursday morning and just knowing he was in bad shape seemed to take a lot of the fun out of the trip. I've been home for a little over 24 hours now and it just sucks. If we had a mid-week flight, I would have taken it and come home."
3989154,jkaup,2015-06-22 14:05:00,56,"Boy, that's a tough one. Sorry about your loss."
3989162,Whopper,2015-06-22 14:05:00,340,"Sorry to hear about this D, that really sucks.Only a few things worst than losing a family pet.Take Care"
3989218,pjshorthorn,2015-06-22 14:33:00,5654,My sincere condolences. I'm sure it was extremely difficult for you and your daughters being so far away from home at the time. Our thoughts are with you. PjShorthorn
3989250,wallydave,2015-06-22 14:40:00,2151,"I am saddened by your news. As a fellow dog lover, I know how much it hurts when a member of our family is suffering. We both work in healthcare, and deal with suffering on a daily basis.....but when that suffering comes home, especially when we can't be there..well as others have said, it just sucks!My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family."
3989290,jimirjr,2015-06-22 14:55:00,1149,Oh Man.... So Sorry... DOGS.... They give Us all SO much. And don't ask for much in return...
3989530,Skywagon,2015-06-22 16:52:00,1106,"We sign up for this eventuality when taking on a pet, still hard to accept when they are gone. Our Golden is 4, I know it will be one of the most traumatic things to ever happen to us when he passes. Feel your pain."
3989626,Bstar,2015-06-22 17:47:00,564,"I'm sorry for your loss. It's never easy to go through. I've had to put down three of my Labs over the years. I'm on my fourth and fifth Lab now. Go through your grieving process but don't hesitate to get another one. He/She will never replace the one you lost but will bring the joy of owning a dog back to your home. Besides, puppies are a blast!"
3989954,forgop,2015-06-22 19:40:00,880,"I should be getting one from a breeder with a litter of pups due in a week, so a new pup should be in our future at the end of August. We also have a golden female that's around 12 that I would have never imagined would outlive him as she's been overweight all her life that we've had her in the past 8 years. Just stinks knowing that we were in a rush to leave and while I know I gave him some attention before we left, it would have been entirely different had I known he would not be home when I returned."
3990626,Bstar,2015-06-23 05:05:00,564,Don't beat yourself up for not being there. I'm sure you gave him a great life. Good luck with the new pup...they have an amazing healing power!
