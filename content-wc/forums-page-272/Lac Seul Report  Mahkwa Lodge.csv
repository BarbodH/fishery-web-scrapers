3153841,T-MacMN,2014-09-05 08:02:00,8,"Pooch - we were up there the same time you were... we were in the new cabin #1 - had the green ranger 619 on the main dock. Couldn't agree more with your post, it's just the Indian culture - they don't take care of their places very well. I have stayed at other Indian run camps on other lakes in Canada - they are all the same. We had no heater (it was below 40 one night), one light bulb, no water the last day - yup the camp is going to ****. It was humorous - the new cabins they are building have no insulation. we could hear the neighbors when they slide theirs chairs across the floor of their cabin! On the bright side - I don't care too much about the amenities, I'm used to roughing it. Having it in this bad of shape means they always have openings! T-Mac"
3154289,Pooch,2014-09-05 10:43:00,4619,"I wish I'd have known you were there so we could finally meet face to face.People are taking my initial reply wrong. I'm not upset with the camp at all. It just needs to be maintained. I could care less about a ""nice"" cabin as we go to fish, but I want a cabin that everything works in it.The folks at Mahkwa are all good people and I do enjoy talking to them when I can. I meant no disrespect to anyone, but I think it was taken that way. So, I am sorry for that.I don't know if I can return because I think the camp took offense to my answer and that bothers me a lot. A WHOLE LOT. I never intend to disrespect anyone, sometimes things just ""don't come out right"". Sorry!Having a well problem was no one's fault. They had water back up and running in a few hours rather than the two days they originally told us. And, that was on a Sunday! You won't see that down here in Illinois!I'm not so sure it's the culture by any means. I'm self employed and sometimes the funds are just not available to do every project that needs to be done around the house or the farm. Especially at $3 new crop corn! Ouch....I wish people would not interpret my initial replies as bashing Mahkwa. The dock I'm talking about is the old dock down by the bigger cabins. The other docks are newer and good docks, just too far away from these end cabins. The other cabins are fine. Several are newer and appear nice. We just happened to be in cabin 14 this year and there was a water leak that we had to work around during our stay and screens missing on one bedroom window. Neither a deal breaker, just inconvenient. No more no less.Since I growled about the discrepancies of the camp let me say what makes this one of my favorite trips each year. In no particular order.Fantastic fishery in this area of Lac Seul. Lots of islands, good fish holding structure. Can usually find a place to fish when the lake gets too rough to fish on.Better than fly in fishing that you can drive to.Camp is spread out so you don't feel cramped or crowded.Road into camp was rebuilt a couple years ago and is in very good shape. Appears to be seal coated.Boat launch is the best of any camp I fish.People in camp are nice folks to visit with and one of the things I look forward to each fall.Plenty of trailer parking and you can park your truck next to your cabin.Camp has a very good camp store.Fuel prices at the dock are more than fair. I think it was the same as on the highway coming in at Hudson.The camp is located a long way from any main highways, but is still easy to get to.The camp is electric powered. A big plus.Did I mention the fishing? I was mistaken on my original reply. We didn't catch 990 walleye in four and a half days, we caught 1340 walleyes. Where else can you do that?There is a good small mouth population in this area of LS. We caught numerous 12 to 19.5 inch smallies while fishing for walleye. If you were targeting small mouth you could probably catch them all day long.The camp has thinned out a lot of trees in the house keeping side of the camp allowing more light and breeze into the area. The house keeping side of camp is on a well. So safe drinking water is not a problem.We looked at one of the cabins on the American Plan side and it was nicer than any cabin I've ever stayed in and I've made the trip to Canada nearly sixty times.I still think the camp prices are quite fair.There is more, but that is enough for now.If I didn't like the camp, I wouldn't drive two thousand miles to get there just to fish four and a half days. If I've offended anyone with my frank observations I really do apologize.Walleye Central exists for the exchange of information by a like minded group of people. When I ask a question I want an accurate answer from someone with knowledge of what I'm asking. I try to do the same in return. When I'm headed for a camp and ask about the fishing or the camp in general I want an accurate assessment. Good, bad or ugly, I want to know what to realistically expect and I'll work around it.If I was too rude in any of my remarks, again in front of anyone who reads this, I apologize to the folks at Mahkwa.Pooch"
3179737,Skiball,2014-09-15 22:55:00,82,Had a great 20th anniversary trip . The fishing was good considering the change in the weather. We had to battle 40 degree temps with winds in at 25-35 . Water temps dropped to 61 degrees. Three of four days we couldn't get to some of our spots but caught nice eyes anyway. Biggest was 26 and two Northerns at 39 and a 35. It was a great 20th trip for us and the camp manager and her staff were very helpful and accommodating. The dock guys friendly and courteous as usual. Great trip. 360 days and counting . Thanks Mahkwa.
3215881,walleyeduran,2014-10-01 18:08:00,286,"T-Mac, the reason they will always have openings is because they will never call you back with information about a open cabin. I have called them 10 times in the last 5 years and always get someone on the phone who has no idea when they have open bookings. They a very nice and take my name and number and will call back just as soon as so and so reports for work. I have never been called back once. This is the reason why they have openings along with the deteriating cabins. Pooch, you are not the only one who has informed me that the cabins are going down hill fast. Maybe it is a blessing that they haven't called me back for a cabin booking."
3975530,Guest,2015-06-17 14:03:00,0,"I am heading to Mahwka Lodge on Lac Seul next week. How has the fishing been and where are they biting? Also, where is a good spot to purchase live bait? Thanks!"
3976090,Pooch,2015-06-17 18:07:00,4619,"You would be better off starting a new thread asking your question. This is an old dead thread.That said, last year minnows sold by the camp were the same price as the bait shops on the way up. Buy them from the service center. That way you don't have to worry about keeping big bunch of minnows alive on your own.I don't know if they sell leeches or worms. Never asked.The fish always bite in that part of the lake!You are aware that the road to camp is washed out and that there is a detour from Dryden to follow?How about a report when you get home?Pooch"
3980146,Bluebomber,2015-06-18 20:27:00,29,Thanks again! I hear ya about the fish being on the move. But at least know where they were. Which helps a lot. Less time spent looking and more time spent catching! I personally will keep 5 fish for the trip. As I buy the conservation license I will eat 3 eyes for our 2 meals of fish and bring my two home. It's all about the experience of having the chance to catch over a 100 eyes per person a day. Not to mention the pike and smallies you get. Doesn't always happen but when it does it's like a dream come true!
3980170,IronDioPriest,2015-06-18 20:44:00,96,Best of luck!
3978082,IronDioPriest,2015-06-18 09:43:00,96,"Returned home yesterday. Water temps were up - low to upper 60's depending on where we fished. Fish seemed to be on the move, staging on points and shorelines, then disappearing down the shoreline. All but a few stragglers had already moved out of bays adjacent to the main lake. Movement was key. Trying to sit on a school and vertical jig didn't yield as much success as continuing to move. We did venture into Vaughn on the 15th. That lake is an eater-factory. No trouble getting limits of fish just under the 18"" slot.And I'd be negligent if I didn't give accolades to the excellence of the Smallmouth in Lac Seul. They are so healthy and robust. And numerous. And large. We usually fish Walleyes all day and then venture out for topwater Smallies in the evening. They rarely disappoint."
3978114,IronDioPriest,2015-06-18 09:50:00,96,"Use Gulp Alive 3"" minnow assortment. Works as good as live bait on this lake, and you don't have to suffer the down-time of constantly getting your bait stripped."
3978210,Bluebomber,2015-06-18 10:34:00,29,Thanks a lot iron for the report! Hope you guys had a good trip. You guys fish bray? Any big fish? Pics?I agree with the gulp... When the fish are aggressive works just as good as live bait. Heck we've caught eyes on cherry twizlers! But when there neutral can't beat live bait.I like throwing cranks when there shallow and winds blowing. Catch some big fish...
3978218,Bluebomber,2015-06-18 10:36:00,29,Where are the smallies on the spawn? Pre? Post?
3978434,IronDioPriest,2015-06-18 11:28:00,96,"We've fished Bray a lot, but not this year. No real need to venture that direction. We tried Two Points Bay and Cow Bay and discovered that the fish had already move out of there and begun staging on adjacent points and moving outward. Then of course once Vaughn opened, we spent Mon/Tues in there for the most part. Found mostly eaters and unders in Vaughn and slotters and monsters in main lake points and shorelines. The smallies we targeted with top waters were oriented to rocks."
3978490,CamoHunter,2015-06-18 12:06:00,363,"Bluebomber, sent you a PM. Wondered if you got it. Thanks!"
3978666,Bluebomber,2015-06-18 12:44:00,29,What depths were you getting eyes? Vaughn? Main lake? Thanks for the info! What was your biggest?
3978802,IronDioPriest,2015-06-18 13:12:00,96,"We found eyes anywhere from 3-4' up to 15-16'. And as I said, they're on the move, so it's likely you'll have to take the info I've given and make some extrapolations on your own as to where they're at. My personal biggest for the week was 25 3/4"". One of my boys got a nice 27"". I believe the largest in our party was 29"". I got a big fat 38"" Pike as well. We keep nothing under 17"" and nothing over 18"". Every other fish we catch goes back into Lac Seul."
3978874,Guest,2015-06-18 13:26:00,0,"Are they still rebuilding a bridge on the road between Hudsen and Mahkwa? If so, where does the detour start to get into Mahkwa? Thanks for all the fishing updates!"
3979258,IronDioPriest,2015-06-18 14:48:00,96,See this thread: Mahkwa Road for the info you're looking for.The road will be under construction until mid-July. There are basically two routes: One route out of Dryden that is a longer distance over all dirt roads that is smoother with lots of turns to pay attention to - the other is the usual paved road through Hudson detouring through a stretch of a few kilometers that is very very rough - much like it used to be a few years ago before they paved that last several kilometers to the camp. Read my post there for my opinion.
3977098,IronDioPriest,2015-06-18 05:46:00,96,"I think there may have been some ""shaking-up"" at Mahkwa Lodge.Ever since Roger stepped down, the place has been taking a nosedive in quality and service. This year was seriously their last chance before our large party began looking for alternatives.Well I'm happy to report that things at Mahkwa seem to be looking up. It was quite obvious to our party of 13 that there was a notable uptick in service in every aspect this year. We couldn't help but notice that it seemed like someone is finally being held accountable for customer service after a few years of declining.The meals were more prompt and efficient. The dockhand was actually jogging back and forth from pumping gas to getting receipts. He came over when we were almost done cleaning fish and offered to spray down and clean the cutting table for us. Room cleaners were conscientious. A few minor problems were addressed immediately. We noticed new docks across the bay in the housekeeping cabins. Sprucing-up around the grounds and buildings. Wi-Fi actually worked everywhere on the grounds. If you've been there in the past few years, you know all of these aspects have been suffering from a general lack of interest on the part of the employees.I couldn't be more pleased to announce that at least for now, it seems like someone is taking charge and taking pride in good customer service at Mahkwa Lodge. We will be returning next year, and hope to see the trend continue. They have a beautiful setting, perfect fishing, and a wonderful opportunity to build the reputation and revenue for the tribe, if they'd only continue to do a few things consistently right."
3977306,tv4fish,2015-06-18 06:57:00,2694,There is no doubt that was needed. I also hope this new trend continues - they have a great location.
3977970,Bluebomber,2015-06-18 09:16:00,29,"Hey iron how about a fishing report? My group is heading up wed. Did you just get back? You fish Vaughn? Opened 6-15... How deep are the eyes? If you only fished the main lake are they in the bays, points, or out to main lake reefs? Has there been any Mayflys? I know there are fish every where but always looking for the motherload!"
3978026,Bluebomber,2015-06-18 09:23:00,29,"Mahkwa has only minnows as far as I know. We always stop at rainy lake sports in fort Frances. Get a couple pounds of leeches, half flat of crawlers and 16 dz minnows and our license. Sometimes we need to go get more minnows from mahkwa..."
