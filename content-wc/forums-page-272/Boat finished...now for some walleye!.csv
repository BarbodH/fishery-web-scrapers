Also banged in around a thousand rivets and re-varnished the bench seats while i was at it. Took 2 weeks of farting around and 200 trips to Canadian Tire, but finally got her done and hit a smallish lake 5 minutes from town for some walleye fun on Saturday morning. Worked out perfectly for the fish fry that afternoon at our place, and the boat hardly leaks at all now!VIDEOhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzF2kxeeNuM"
3990602,pjshorthorn,2015-06-23 04:43:00,5654,The boat looks pretty good!!! The fishing didn't look all that bad either. ðŸ˜€ I had to laugh at the 200 trips to Canadian Tire....I've had those kind of projects too PjShorthorn.

Some of the greatest boat related satisfactions I've ever had were the several times I've made a project of an old fourteen footer - redoing it to make it functional, to look like a queen again, to rig it as I want it for fishing the shield lakes - just doesn't get much more enjoyable. Good job. Don't forget to add a video that includes your son and the Lab!"

Some of the other spots are under the bench seats, maybe a project for next year I'll just let MARINE GOOP and my bilge pump keep me going for now and have at it in the spring again, maybe do the 200 trips to Canadian tire over the winter in preparation lol.Quote: Originally Posted by JayM5209Good job on the boat, Limey!

Good job. Don't forget to add a video that includes your son and the Lab!This has been my boat since I arrived in Canada, had her over 8 years now. She is deep and wide and my 30 Yamaha is the mutz nutz! With the new un-water logged floors and the leaks fixed she gets 27mph with just me in the boat and 24mph with a fishing buddy, gear and beer for the day( just kidding, I am teetotal). I am in the market for a 12foot tinny and trailer, going to get a 4x4 Grizzly too and hit up some back lakes .cant wait to video those adventures. As for Roloff and Jack featuring in some vids, soon .just ain't been out much recently and Jack finishes school this week. He is already upset with me for going to Lac Seul the other day without him! Here are a couple of Jack helping with the boat renos the other week .he's a DUDE!"
3993034,bigwillies,2015-06-23 16:17:00,515,looked like fun. that's a surprisingly good lake to fish and most locals don't even bother.lol
