We have been to Trapline Lake (excellent walleye lake) with Halleys Outposts numerous times before, but I wanted to try a different lake this time. I will be bringing my 10 year son who is very excited. I was told that Chase is a numbers lake which is exactly what I was looking for. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

Had an estimated over 45"" Pike eat My spinner bait and take off, never to be seen again, (just heard) at the entrance to Eagle Lake from Midway lake. Lyle and Val's Outposts were the owners back then.. Now I think its Halleys Camps.... Anywhere the wind blows into sunken structure... or weedlines.. Was there in Late June..."
