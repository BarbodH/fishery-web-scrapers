They are like regular jigs but with some stiff wire set to protect the hook from weeds. You will catch most of your walleye vertical jigging, but if you want to cast out with a slow retrieve, the weedless jigs work best. Expect about 1/4 of your hits to be pike. Nothing wrong with that, but I was surprised at the pike numbers. Don't forget about the Lake Trout lake that you can portage to. Not much of a Lake Trout guy so I can't give any advise on how to fishem. If the wind blows from the NorthWest into the point that the cabin is on, just fish from shore with slip bobbers. Caught plenty of walleye without even getting into the boat. Have a good time and thank you for Military Service."
