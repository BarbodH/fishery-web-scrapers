For us, the walleye were 8'-12'. We fished jig and minnow, with good success on mepps spinners (#4). Good luck and have a fantastic time."

We chose not to fight the wind and fished around Goose Bay. That was a good decision. We got a 27.5, 26.5, Five 25, twelve 24 and many more slot and over. Myself and son fished ourselves out of minnows 3 days.Any time you fished out of minnows is a geat day. Between 2 boats we had 6 Northern follow little walleys to the boat and take 3 of them. 3 fo the northerns were over the 40 inch range. Conservation patrol came into fishing camp and fined one group $80 for each of the 2 live walleyes in there cooler. Make sure you kill all fish before putting in your cooler. Goose Bay camp was great as always. It was out 18th year. Tight lines to all."
