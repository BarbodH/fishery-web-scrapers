I recently ordered Trakmaps topo Ontario micro sdcard, I know it won't show depths but I'm hoping for good outlines and islands on the lakes. Anyone familiar with Trakmaps topo and how well does it work in the lowrance units. I still have to download the upgraded version for the Elite, it's supposed to work better with mapping chips.

I thought there was a free open source topo map set out there too? Not sure what format it supports though. I'll have to dig around and see."
