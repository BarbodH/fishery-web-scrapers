I know this is not 100 walleye a day but still good for us on Wabaskang. We took time off to portage up the Cedar river and a hike in trip to a small lake that is catch and release. Our Cedar river trip included a trip into Beaver Lake just off of Wine Lake where we caught a nice mess of walleye for a great shore lunch. Our lures turned out to be 1/8 and 1/4 ounce jigs tipped with a minnow or a 3inch piece of night crawler we also added a 3 inch triple ripple plastic grub fishing it with or without live bait. I think jig and minnow worked the best but all were effective. I did fish with a crawler rig and slip bobber rig but the action was not fast enough for me. We used the light jig when we were lucky enough to get a slow drift. The fish caught were running bigger than years past with many running about 20 inches, biggest was a 26 inch which is not a monster but good for us. Most the fish were caught on the edge of weeds in about 10 ft. of water. We got back to camp on Thursday and the Conservation officers were in camp checking possession limits. They checked the deep freezer and the refrigerators in the cabins, they hung around to late in the afternoon checking limits of the boats coming in. They even asked each guy about shore lunch fish etc. Quite a few guys got tickets for over the limit at $250 a fish. Lucky no one was five over as you have to appear in court. One guy got a ticket for having empty beer cans in the boat which was a possession of alcohol violation. The word was that this was going on all over the area. A note of interest, a couple of crappie have been caught in Wabaskang so they are moving north. Good Luck to all on future trips."

3984378,billy weaver,2015-06-20 14:18:00,470,The water was lower than normal but had came up to a level that didn't effect most of our fishing spots. We did abandon our usual fishing of Gawley's Bay which is a shallow weedy bay of about 10ft. normal stage. It may have been ok for pike and perch. I was disappointed that could not find a spot with big yellow perch.
3984410,team walleye,2015-06-20 14:53:00,336,We were up at Rainbow Point Lodge on Perrault. They were checking with the camp owner about minnows. I don't believe they checked any cabins but the owner did ask us if we were ok on our fish. That's a pretty hefty fine. Sounds like you had a nice week! Congrats ðŸ˜€
