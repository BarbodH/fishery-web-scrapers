3844689,SinOrSwim,2015-05-06 12:20:00,1528,"Agreed. Agree 100% But, it sure would be nice to know those criteria before you spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on gear, take vacation time from your job, put down a deposit, take a spot with a group of guys, drive X number of hours with said group of guys ONLY to be turned down at the border because you thought you could get in but some agent ""decided"" that day wasn't your day to get in. Now your group just went from an even number of guys for boats to an odd number. You have to figure out a way back from the border back to home and you just wasted a week of vacation you could have used to go somewhere that..........oh I don't know..........had rules clarified for you in advance????They have every right to allow or deny whoever they want. But, I don't think it is too much to ask to be able to call the border, explain I have X and X and X on my record. Am I able to enter or not? Seems pretty simple."
3844809,johnboat,2015-05-06 13:01:00,2014,"SOS,That's my beef to. This family in question has a trip planned to the Dominican Republic this winter too. The same day they asked me about entry to Canada they called the Dominican Border and we're told "" just bring the letter from the judge stating he is able to travel outside the USA and you will be allowed entry. If you have any questions, here's my number my name is X X X X and I will email you a confirmation. ""To bad it's not that easy at all borders, including ours."
3844873,SinOrSwim,2015-05-06 13:24:00,1528,"If I had any question as to whether I could cross I wouldn't even think about going. No way I would go through all we go through to plan these trips to get up there and get denied. If I am up front with them about what the situation is, there should be no reason they can't tell me prior to leaving whether I am okay to cross or not. I want it in writing too. And, quite honestly if they were not willing to give me an answer.............I wouldn't go and I would never try again. But, the ambiguity is silly. I have two trips planned. One of them required a 75% deposit because of when I made my reservation. Which, is perfectly fine. I was aware of the rules.......I played by the rules. But, what if I was the guy in question? I'm supposed to pay for 75% of my trip and then roll the dice as to whether I could get across???? I just don't think it is too much to ask to have that information prior to leaving provided you give Canada all the information prior to leaving."
3844881,Old Timer,2015-05-06 13:26:00,255,"Canada has its own rules and they don't have to tell you beforehand if they don't want to. Yes, sometimes it is up to the agent's discretion whether someone is coming in or staying out. And generally there is a five-year wait after a crime (any misdemeanor) committed stateside. I know this doesn't give anyone great guidance, but that's the way it is. For starters, I'd take VGord's advice and make the call. If you want to go hog wild, I have heard about Canadian attorneys in Winnipeg who are sometimes successful securing one-year passes. But the attorney costs dough and so does the pass. For examples. I know of a young fellow who was cited for underage consumption when a freshman at college in Arizona. He was denied entry at Fort Francis. I know a personal friend who had a DWI and was still granted entry at Pigeon River. But while on a cruise in the Pacific Northwest, he was denied entry at Vancouver. He had to eat peanut butter sandwiches for two days on the ship while the other guests were touring the island. So there you go."
3846017,elkman99,2015-05-06 19:38:00,180,"I have a public intoxication ticket on my record from back in 1993 and have never had an issue getting in. And for that matter, I have a cousin with a DUI and a felony charge and he has gotten into Canada the last 3 times with zero issues. these both happened in the early 1990's to him."
3846977,MrSimon,2015-05-07 06:39:00,922,The whole point is that they don't have and don't want to have a specific itemized list of reasons to allow or deny access to their country. There are so many variables to border security that they WANT the flexibility to make on the spot decisions based on what they see in front of them at the time. They purposefully built ambiguity into their system. Canada's primary concern is protecting their citizens ... not protecting our trip deposits.
3847041,johnboat,2015-05-07 06:56:00,2014,I'm pretty sure the overwhelming majority of guests entering the country that have deposited at camps leaving their name and number and personal information aren't the ones that are a threat to Canada ' s safety. I would like to think the border agents were given discretion to be able to tell the good guys from the bad guys when the word of the law or circumstances can't.
3847121,SinOrSwim,2015-05-07 07:30:00,1528,"Yes, discretion if they find something that hasn't been disclosed. Nobody is saying that is wrong. Nobody is saying anything different. Nobody is saying if htey want to deny people that have run a red light they shouldn't be able to.But, what is so difficult about sending the information to the border authority and getting a ruling based on THAT information prior to arrival? If it is something different upon arrival, fine deny them. But, it is ridiculous to think a person should do everything they do to prepare for these trips financially and otherwise and not know whether they can get through the border.If, and that is a big IF, that is truly the case I should cancel my second trip that has a small deposit and never return. I wonder how much money I have spent in Canada over the last 20+ years? I wouldn't want to risk being denied entry."
3847513,tv4fish,2015-05-07 08:15:00,2694,"SinOrSwim - As most of the guys know - I agree with you 100%. For the guys that think that your entry should be based on the customs agent's ""mood"" (AKA discretion) -- I sure hope you don't get one that IS in a bad mood and you get turned back............... After all, how can one ""obey"" the rules if you don't know what they are OR how they are going to be enforced????"
3847529,sansmoniker,2015-05-07 08:17:00,2,"If I was facing your situation, I would spend the money to contact a law office in Fort Frances and get their advice. I'm assuming that the local lawyers probably deal with these issues not infrequently (work visa issues, visiting families, etc.) and may have some relationships with the Fort Frances customs office that may be helpful in at least providing some advance clarity specific to your situation."
3843265,Consigliere,2015-05-06 06:43:00,132,Typically both US and CAN border admissions is at the discretion of the officer on duty. There are rules about who is allowed in but the officer can be lenient on those. If they don't like you and you have a clean record they can deny you. This is the case both ways.

3843545,tv4fish,2015-05-06 08:01:00,2694,"My opinion - Contact the Canadian consulate via email with the exact ""details"" of your situation - ask them for a WRITTEN reply. If their reply says it's OK, print that out and have it with you when you cross the border. If it ""goes against you"", you're probably SOL. I agree 100% with some of the other comments about the agents - it should NOT be up to the agents to decide this - policy/rules should be what determines this - NOT the ""mood"" of the agent."
3843777,LOW1,2015-05-06 08:50:00,2828,"Canada and the United States HAVE made rules - the rule is that it is at the officer's discretion. This is true with law enforcement everywhere-think warning tickets instead of speeding tickets. That's discretionary. I doubt if the public intox would even raise an eyebrow. The harassment might, depending, as others have said, as to how Canada views that crime."
3843841,tv4fish,2015-05-06 09:05:00,2694,"I understand what you're saying -- BUT with that rationale - why even bother passing laws and reducing them to writing - just let the officers decide........... IMO - this situation is a little different than getting stopped for speeding and whether you get a warning or a ticket, the man is making some serious plans and wants/needs to know what the ""law"" is so he can plan accordingly. If I were in his situation, I also would want to know, rather than ""guess"" what mood the agent is going to be in."
3843865,1/4 oz Jig,2015-05-06 09:10:00,90,I've seen this guy at the all canada shows. Maybe give him a call. I have no affiliation or have never spoke to them but a phone call never hurts.http://www.sportsmanlawyers.com/index.html
3843881,LOW1,2015-05-06 09:14:00,2828,"I suspect that the rationale for the discretion is that there are far, far too many laws for the border officers to know everything about them. Every state, county, podunk town, and city has their own criminal code. And the federal criminal code is itself huge. And all of these are changing on a daily basis. Way too much for any border officer (either Canadian or American) to stay on top of. Therefore, discretion. Common sense suggests that the way to maximize discretion is to look your best, talk politely, and act like someone you would want to visit your country. A trailer full of beer may not be your best friend."
3844361,MrSimon,2015-05-06 10:37:00,922,"My advice is to take him along. Make sure to bring all the necessary paperwork, be polite and professional at the border, don't take any booze (buy it up there), and hope for the best. If he gets flagged, take him to the nearest bus station and wish him luck.I look at it this way .... it's their country and we aren't citizens. They don't owe us anything and are well within their right to pick and choose who gets in, based on whatever criteria they want.Officer discretion is without a doubt the appropriate way to handle access decisions.I can understand that this unknown is frustrating for the young man in question here (as well as the entire group) ..... but don't blame Canada. They aren't the ones who fooled around and picked up a criminal record."
3844489,johnboat,2015-05-06 11:19:00,2014,"Mrsimon,Thanks for your reply. We are pretty much on the same page.If it sounded like I was blaming Canada, it was taken wrong. I am not. I personally mentioned to him about consequences of our actions that he is fully aware of and remorseful to. I have made some decent contact and like most on here have said, and I already told them "" its 50/50"". And that is a quote from someone in authority that was very helpful and understanding.I will present the young man with my suggestions and information gathered, tell him some options and possible outcomes, both good or bad, and let them decide.My gut tells me after some effort and common sense at the border on our part, as well as time, he will be allowed in. On a personal note, he's truly a good kid, Godly, and respectful.............that just had some minor stumbles in close proximity. I still welcome advise anyone has to offer."
3844553,johnboat,2015-05-06 11:46:00,2014,"Just an fyi. I asked this very helpful person about the websites that offer assistance for doubtful crossers and was told they do absolutely no more good than a person driving to the border them selves. And that these "" firms"" had no authority, afilleation, or influence with the border officals (as i figured). At a cost of around 500 -600. I did contact t one and the price was actually 1250 dollars. I got the feeling from my contact that using these ""firms"" was actually counterproductive."
3842121,johnboat,2015-05-05 19:13:00,2014,"Like most, I am bored with such questions as they seem common. But after trying to figure this out for a member of our group I understand why there are so many of thee questions asked. THERE SEEMS TO BE NO STRAIGHT ANSWER as to whether this person will be allowed through. Situation: 21 year old has received a public intoxication and a 3rd degree harassment (by electronic device, dang social media, the least of harassment charges) each within the last aprox 6 months. The Public Intox was just a ticket and the harassment was 12 months ""informal or unsupervised"" probation, and considered a simple misdemeanor. I had them call the NOTO number listed above and it seems they just have info on DUI. And the person suggested to call the Border and ask for Immigration, which was done. After giving them the info the lady at the Border said she would have to check and call back. After a few hours she called back and said he was deemed inadmissible for 5 years. I asked if the lady offered any type of ""rehabilitation"" and the young man said he wasn't sure. He said anything she said after ""inadmissible for 5 years "" had his head spinning and couldn't think right. So I read a bunch online and make a few calls. All the legal reading is, quite frankly, just to unclear to me what the answer is. The calls I make aren't much more concrete in answering Yes or No. Or worse yet some say yes, and others say no. The only common response is ""that it is up to the officer on duty at the point of entry"" I understand National Security, but a twelve hour drive is a long way to go to find out the answer to a question that I can't see why can't be answered by phone. The young man said the judge did give him a paper that mentioned he was not restricted to travel outside of the USA. I am not sure if that is because he is in the Military or not. Our group is booked to leave in 3 weeks. If any other info would help in determining an answer, please ask and I will find out. Does anybody know where I can find out EXACTLY what will happen, or needs to be done? I would prefer talking to someone instead of trying to interpret the legal verbage. Thank you for any help regarding this."
3842289,v-bay gord,2015-05-05 19:54:00,3168,I would suggest phoning the border where you will be crossing and ask to talk to the supervisor.
3842665,johnboat,2015-05-05 22:09:00,2014,I had called twice. One said it was at the discretion of officer on duty. Another said anyone with a misdemeanor is never allowed in. I mentioned that in 2012 i thought things had changed slightly and people with Dui's could now get in and she said that wasn't true and no one with any misdemeanor is ever allowed in. This is the frustrating part. The number I called was 807 274 3655. From what I could find that was the Ft Francis office.
3842681,97roughneck,2015-05-05 22:37:00,899,I have no solution to your problem but I do have two schools of thought about it- 1) That's ridiculous. Tell Canada to kiss your glass and do your fishing at home. Lots of walleyes in the good ol' USA. 2) This young man just learned an invaluable lesson- that actions have consequences. Time to man up and do a 5 yr. bit. Bet he doesn't do it again.
3842705,johnboat,2015-05-05 22:55:00,2014,"I whole heartedly concur with you on both counts. Our 12 man group that has been together for 12 years would certainly make a camp owner in the USA within 16 hours of home very happy.And there is no doubt the lesson is learned.Due to some health reasons in our group this year is very disheartening not to be complete, assuming this lad can't come.Thank for the reply.Still hoping someone can help out. Anybody?.........All replies appreciated. Not just looking for false hope. Looking for an answer."
3842921,btyreprich,2015-05-06 04:30:00,1067,"Ever consider contacting a Canadian consulate or even their embassy about this situation? They might offer a solution to this problem. Like I said, they might. The diplomatic staff could direct you to a Canadian lawyer who is experienced in these matters and possibly help get this resolved in a court. I am certainly not a lawyer nor have any experience in a Canadian court of law, but I have to think that a judge would be inclined to help out a person with 2 minor offenses that has gone through the legal channels for help. Best of luck on this. I'd be so sad if I or my son were ever in this situation. Sure there is great fishing in the U.S., but there's something special about a Canadian trip."
3843025,JAY221,2015-05-06 05:36:00,877,"I think the real question that needs to be asked is what does Canada consider these misdemeaners? to be in their eyes? They may consider one to be a felony which would make him not able to get in to Canada. Good Luck getting a straight answer! Later, Jay"
3843113,turkeyriver,2015-05-06 05:59:00,80,"We had a situation a couple years back with one of our group also. I came up empty with solid answers also. I'm not sure what pops up on the screen for border security when they scan your passport, but I think misdemeanors in the U.S. may not even show up. If it were me, I would bring an extra car and make arrangements to park it somewhere in International Falls as a backup if he can't get in. If this trip is extra special to your group it would be worth the hassle to try it. Pure speculation on my part here, but I'll bet the memo to border security this year is help the Canadian economy all you can!"
3843153,v-bay gord,2015-05-06 06:21:00,3168,"The Fort Francis office is 807-274-3655, Ask to speak with Kevin Begin (pronounced bay-gin). He is the supervisor and should be able to give you an answer."
3843241,SinOrSwim,2015-05-06 06:36:00,1528,"This, IF true, is what drives me crazy. It should NOT be up to the individual officer on duty. It should NEVER be up to the individual. It should either be yes or no. Nobody should have to drive all the way to the border and roll the dice on whether they will catch a border agent on a bad day. That is ridiculous.Canada can make whatever rules it wants. I have no issues with that. But, tell us the rules and we will play by them. Don't change the rules as your individual agents see fit."
