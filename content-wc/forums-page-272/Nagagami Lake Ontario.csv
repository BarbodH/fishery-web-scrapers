3957521,Teresa W,2015-06-11 15:56:00,3,Just got home 6/10/15 from an amazing fly in fishing trip. Stayed at Kay Vee Lodge and had an absolutely amazing time. Walleye and Pike fishing at its finest. I am so excited to go again. I think next summer we will go later in the year when the perch are hungry too. Rob and Donna are just wonderful folks to deal with and we could not have asked for a better trip.Walleye love those jigs and minnows. Caught pike on lures and also while fishing for walleye with jigs. Got a few white fish too. Limited out and cant imagine how anyone could go home without doing so. Could have taken what I needed for fishing in a sandwich bag just wish I didnt but all the other stuff. Yes there are mosquitos but not on the water and thats where you find me. I have never fished walleye and I am hooked!
3958161,youngknight,2015-06-11 20:20:00,228,How many other lodges/cabins on lake?
3958361,adempsey,2015-06-11 21:10:00,963,"Four lodges - Expeditions North, Timberwolf Lodge, Kay Vee Lodge and Nagagami Lake Lodge.Nagagami Lake Lodge is at the far north end, the other three are in the southern section of the lake. When we went it wasn't very busy at all. We saw 1 boat from the north lodge all week and a couple from Kay Vee. The rest were from our camp (Expeditions North).It's a great lake to fish. I'd go back for sure."
3958657,lassh,2015-06-12 05:31:00,553,Welcome to the walleye world. I'm glad you had a great experience. Used properly this board is a great resource. I think you'll find that your experience won't be limited to the week you spent on the lake- but you will re-live the experience and spend many hours reflecting and planning the next trip. Thanks for posting.
3958665,Teresa W,2015-06-12 05:44:00,3,"Never felt crowded. I was in a group of 8 and some days never seen them. An area out in front of our lodge termed ""the flats"" was a little more busy. Maybe 15 boats all anchored and limit out on walleye. Most jigging and I had fun there. There are many little inlets as well as Moose Lake (pike). Good sized lake a lot of fishing spots far from crowded. Spotted 7 eagle nests and bald eagles. A friend suggested a spot he has on his gps from his last trip there and it was 9 miles from our dock. When I go back I will book when there is more perch and white fish action. Would love to limit on 4 species for taking home. Kay Vee Lodge could not have taken better care of us."

3962065,Teresa W,2015-06-13 08:43:00,3,Well I brought my limit home. Lol.
3985074,buckeyedan,2015-06-20 22:08:00,44,"Been going to Nagagami my entire life, been at Walton's for 15 years now. I totally echo your sentiments. Rob and Donna run a first class operation on a world class walleye and pike lake that seems to be a bit of a hidden gem (but I'm OK with that). Once you learn the lake and get on the fish I have a hard time imagining better fishing."
3986274,donb,2015-06-21 13:09:00,13,"Been with Rob and Donna 3 times. First class operation, awesome food, great cabins, clean boats. Fishing is outstanding for walleye and Pike. Been to 3 other outfitters and Kay Vee is tops."
