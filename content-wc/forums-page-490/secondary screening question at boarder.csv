1306651,gapwedge,2011-05-13 23:08:00,19,"About 5 years ago, I was coming back to the US and flipantly asked the officer where I could get a hat like the one he was wearing. Thirty-six hours later I found myself in Guatanamo Bay, where I stayed on the American plan for the next eighteen months. The fishing wasn't bad, but I'm in no rush to go back."
1306655,fishforlife,2011-05-14 02:27:00,77,"gapwedge,Make no jokes concerning this issue, you just may end up there with justified response if you answer the right questions wrong. We live in a volatile world since 911 and can't afford to slack on a silliy answers from anyone anytime.There's a time and place for our sense of humor, and it's not at the border.Have fun when you get the lake. Be honest open , and let them do their job, no matter how we see it. Have fun and enjoy your trip.RFW"
1306665,Sutsgold,2011-05-14 05:38:00,219,"We are asked those questions all the time, especially coming back. I am under the impression it is their way of making small talk. Getting you to answer questions you should be very comfortable with. If you seem nervous or unsure of your answers it might be a red flag, but really I think its to allow the computer the opportunity to run all of your information. We were pulled in to the canadian side last time and a companion of ours who has crossed the border many times without incident was detained because of a marijuana incident where he recieved court supervision 25 years ago. The last thing they said to him as they sent him out to our truck was ""we know everything about you"", and apparantly they do."
1306720,Guest,2011-05-14 09:50:00,0,Sometimes the boarder agents ask questions just to pattern how you respond. After a few questions like: Where do you work Do you like your job They hear and see how you act when answering truthfully. Now they ask you something important and see if you act the same. I suspect your were just selected as a random check.
1310683,JinxCanada,2011-05-24 09:38:00,1306,Well I've found this interesting. I get asked all the time about my work and before you guys ask me or PM me I'll let you know right now that I can not discuss anything operational. The best advice I can give you is never lie and be forthcoming. It's in your best interest.
1306308,kevinfor,2011-05-13 02:50:00,1,"I am an American and have visited Canada several times since its my favorite place to visit and relax. Not long ago, i was at a land border crossing, and for some strange reason, the Customs officer sent me over to the Immigration desk where that officer asked me questions that i have never been asked before, either in Canada, or in other countries that i have visited.Questions like what my occupation is, name of my employer, location, where my family lives, how much money i have, and others and then i was asked to wait while another officer ran my info over the computer. I was also asked about prior arrests, etc etcThis has NEVER happened to me when i visited Canada in the past so i don't understand what happened here. What i can tell you is that the first Customs officer, put a rectangular card in my passport before he sent me over to the Immigration desk. The paper had info like money declared, and more importantly, numbers 1 thru 9 in a row. He circled 1 and 9 on my card and then put something like NANT or NAMT under 9.could someone please tell me what this all means.. eventually they let me through...thanks"
1306314,Blue Lk,2011-05-13 04:49:00,269,"Just a ramdom check,I think.I have had this happen a couple times going into your country.Far some reason both sides of the border flag curtain individules for a more indepth screening process.I have no former convictions or border related incidents so it was only a matter of a little time out of day."
1306328,Andre (wallyandre),2011-05-13 05:47:00,2274,I cross the border 2-3 times/week and the US officials are asking me those questions 3 times on 5
1306351,campchick,2011-05-13 06:38:00,96,I have also crossed the border several times this past winter. As a Canadian I was surprised to be asked similar questions. American officials seem to be concerned with how much money I was carrying each time. They also did a thorough inspection of the vehicle and my belongings. It was a very creepy feeling - I almost felt violated. They were professional but not welcoming. Returning to Canada was quick and non eventful however. All in all - not a pleasant experience.

1306362,Walley Guide,2011-05-13 07:10:00,67,"I have been asked from both directions about carrying in excess of $10,000. (the magic number) I always tell them, they will need to see my ex-wife if they are looking for any excess cash. Funny part is the U.S. agents never crack a smile on that one......guess they have been there and done that. Happy Fishin' Walley"
1306479,vteye,2011-05-13 11:56:00,812,I have a family member whose is a crossing guard. Guards look for all kinds of things that make average honest law abiding citizens get secondary screenings. One of my kids (9 yr old with parents and brothers in attendence Irish/French heritage) had a secondary screening at an airport. You want to talk about insanity...
1306499,MidWestFishman,2011-05-13 12:50:00,44,"Last year I was made to come inside crossing into Canada and was grilled about how much money I was carrying and If I had ever had my fingerprints taken.Turned out they were concerned that I was in their computer as having a concealed weapons permit which I do. It is very common in Oklahoma to have the permit and carry weapons. They asked if I had any handguns in my vehicle and of course I didn't so I said no. Then they told me they could go search my car. I said you are perfectly welcome to and here are my keys. He just stared at me a few seconds, handed me back my passport and told me to have a good time. No such problem crossing back into the States. That is the first time I have been really questioned much. I will see if I get a repeat of that this year."
1306510,Whopper,2011-05-13 13:45:00,340,"I've made well over 30 crossings throughout the years, most have been uneventful. Had a few where they have searched my vehicle and twice I've been made to go to the immigration officer inside at two different crossings, once was pre-passport days and once was after. The one trip after was kind of funny, the officer took three of us in to talk to us and look over our passports and driver licenses, came back about five minutes later handed our stuff to us and said we were free to go, all he told us to do was wear our seat belts which at the time I thought was strange. Once we got back in the truck and was on our way I mentioned how strange I thought the seat belt comment was, and then from the back seat my son tells me he had gotten a seat belt violation a couple months prior and never told me.I think it's numbers deal about getting checked or unless they suspect your not forthcoming with answers to some of the basic questions they ask at times.I will say that all of my crossings into Canada except for one has been pleasant, can't say the same for returning though which I don't understand, but what the heck I've always made it through which is the main thing."
1306511,@Lunker,2011-05-13 13:46:00,835,"During one of my crossings, the officer looked very closely at all the pages in my passport. He wanted to know why I had been to Honduras so many times. I said ""scuba diving."" He said ""Oh, you mean recreation?"""
