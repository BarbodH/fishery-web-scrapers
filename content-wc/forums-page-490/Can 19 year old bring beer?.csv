1310899,downriverbob,2011-05-24 19:10:00,880,"You might not pay duty as often crossing over from Detroit to Windsor, or at the Soo seem to be a little more ""liberal"" with items. I have paid duty several times when crossing from International Falls to Fort Frances. There have been times crossing there early in the morning and they had 6 officers search both car and boat. One time I had an ice auger in my boat(in August) and nothing was said ! BOB"
1310976,WalleyeCrazy2,2011-05-24 22:52:00,29,Buy Canadian beer... its better anyway!
1303593,Aaron-IN,2011-05-06 08:36:00,500,"If he is of legal age in Canada (yes, it's 19) then he can bring a case of beer into Canada duty free. No he can't buy a case in the US but it's the Canadian customs you are dealing with going into Canada, if he is 19 then he can bring a case."
1303595,Lovetofish,2011-05-06 08:39:00,458,Good question. My son is 19 as well.
1303641,Larry Mac,2011-05-06 10:14:00,530,"Reels, that is a ""Very Interesting Idea"". Have a great year Thank you,Larry Mac"
1303845,ftfarms,2011-05-06 19:45:00,444,When my son was 20 and went with me the lady from candian customs told me he couldnt bring any booze cause he wasnt old enough to buy it in minnesota so she made me pay duty on it. so your right clear as mud.
1303852,ferriswheel,2011-05-06 20:29:00,29,"One person must be of legal age (21) to purchase the beer, everyone of the legal age of the province (ON 19, MB 18) you are entering is entitled to their personal duty free limit (24 beer). If you really want to get in good with your guides pick up Cdn Cigarettes at the duty free and give them as a thank you. Must be Cdn cigs or you have to pay a health tax on other cigs (dumb rules)."
1303863,Obabikon,2011-05-06 21:00:00,2370,"It USED to be that someone 18 and older could have beer in Ontario, but you had to be 21 to have liquor. I believe that was the way the rule went. I believe it is now 19 for everything. Either way, there is zero doubt that a 19 year old can bring in a case of beer. I can't promise that he can bring in a bottle of booze, but next time I cross the border (Sunday) I'll ask."
1303869,Obabikon,2011-05-06 21:16:00,2370,"http://canadaonline.about.com/od/cus...omsalcohol.htm Look under ""legal drinking age"": â€¢Legal Drinking Age in Canada The legal drinking age in Canada is determined by each province and territory in Canada. This is also the age at which you are allowed to bring alcohol into that province or territory. Here's a backuphttp://www.traveldocs.com/ca/customs.htm Here's another one if you don't believe me.http://gocanada.about.com/od/canadat...quorborder.htm one more?http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/media/fac...s/060-eng.html last one... http://www.novascotia.com/en/home/pl...s.aspx#alcohol"
1303873,Obabikon,2011-05-06 21:21:00,2370,"I'll ask just to be safe, when I'm at the border. However, I want to point out that never once did I find a single page (other than this thread) that stated you need to be 21 to import a case of beer."
1310688,JinxCanada,2011-05-24 09:44:00,1306,As I am a Canada Border Service Officer I'm always here to help clear up any questions you might have. Just PM me and I'll be happy to get back to you quickly with correct information.YES he may bring beer into Canada (or liquor if you prefer) without paying duty of any kind as long as it's within the allowed limits (1 case/bottle/1.5 ltr of wine) and if he's 18 and going into Quebec it's also ok. I hope this helps.
1310720,ohiojmj,2011-05-24 10:54:00,1262,Skip the debate and just pack that extra case. I find it hard believe that you'd be stopped to pay the duty anyway. What's the big deal?
1303369,Reels,2011-05-05 18:08:00,2876,My son is 19 now. Can we bring an extra case seeing he is legal drinking age for Ontario?
1303397,fishman10,2011-05-05 18:50:00,226,"yes, he can bring whatever he wants."
1303400,ftfarms,2011-05-05 18:54:00,444,can he buy beer in the state he is entering canada through? If not than its a no. he can buy beer in canada but not in the states.
1303411,Reels,2011-05-05 19:25:00,2876,"Well, he would be with me who boght the beer."
1303423,ftfarms,2011-05-05 19:45:00,444,you can bring him a case but he cant count it as his so there for u would have to pay duty on it.
1303426,BenBeattie,2011-05-05 19:55:00,232,Just wait until you cross the border to get his case and send him in to the store on his own... legally buying your first case of beer is something a young man will never forget!
1303431,Fish_Heads,2011-05-05 20:04:00,154,"As a matter of fact, I never forgot illegally buying my first case of beer either !Cheers !Fish"
1303440,Obabikon,2011-05-05 20:23:00,2370,"He can bring beer. 100% legal. Two things... first off, he could just purchase it at the duty free store. 100% legal. Secondly, once your out of Minnesota (on the bridge) you can sell it to him for a penny. It's perfectly legal for him to cross the border with a case of beer in his possession."
1303570,Reels,2011-05-06 07:47:00,2876,One of those subjects clear as mud. :-) Maybe Juls can set up a Wednesday chat night with a Canadian Boarder Agent for all the clear as mud questions we get on the board.
1303586,Wall-i-Lama,2011-05-06 08:21:00,1524,Can he drink the entire case?
