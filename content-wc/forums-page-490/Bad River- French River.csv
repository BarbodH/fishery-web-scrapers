The water level above the rapids was really high so the Big Jamison wasn't passable and Devil's door had a 5 foot drop. They are guessing in about 3 to 4 weeks they will be able to run the Jamison. Wondering if anyone has any tips fishing pike early season? We only caught hammerheads and lost a couple of big ones but all in all pretty disappointed. A few big walleye were caught trolling around the Bad river lodge."
533115,Guest,2003-07-01 15:15:00,0,Headed up there by boat July 13. Have had good luck before but haven't gone all the way up into where the lodges are. How difficult is it to get up there and is it worth while? Have caught several good fish trolling out the channel at night with Rapala type baits. Any suggestions.
533145,Guest,2003-07-02 10:31:00,0,"I have fished the lower french river the last 6 May's. We don't go into the bay, however. If you are talking about coming up into the river beyond York Wilderness Camp (formerly Bad River Outpost), you are going to have to run some rapids, which may not be possible depending on the water level. Fishing above that area was great this year....stayed at French River Lodge. John"
533149,Guest,2003-07-02 11:26:00,0,"Thanks John, I have run some of the rapids in my dingy but not in my tin boat. I have been up through all of the rapids that dump into the bay but I'm not sure how many more there are once you get over the first two levels. I'm not affraid of being adventuresome but don't feel like wrecking a 16 ft aluminum. I've seen lots of guys going up there with bigger boats than mine so maybe I need to collar a local and get some advice."
533185,MAZ,2003-07-02 22:17:00,29,"Try the Pickeral river or even better Go to the Flat rapids, if you can get above them, all the better. Fish the lower end of the river, I find way better fishing experience. If your fishing the bad, becareful. They don't call it the Bad River for nothing! Good luck, Be safe,"
1285052,Guest,2011-03-21 17:05:00,0,"If your plans are to Fish the Bad River from Georgian Bay, Your best entrance in the Marked boat channel and run up Devil's Door Rapids and Down the Jamison's. (Turn Left after Devils door) After the Jamisons stay to left or right anything but middle (Jackson's Rock lurks to grab props). Once you have made in around the Island you have entered the prime zone. Easily recognizable by the outpost lodges. Here you drift jig or Troll for those big Bad River Lunkers. Just tap the bottom for a split second other wise your snagged. I drift down current Jigging and troll up very slowly (just to say I'm moving). Starting at Island tip (just past Peirres lodge Brite orange rough) and go down hugging the east side till you reach a fork taking right side down and troll opposite side on the way up. If you feel the need to venture up river, I do it with extreme caution and I have over a hundred trips under my belt. Traveling up through the Jamison's past Devils door take wide left turn around huge under water Pink. Now you have arrived in the Jump zone. Marked with no swimming signs. Now there is a down channel (the Jump) and a Back Channel YOU MUST GO UP RIVER IN BACK CHANNEL. (it's to left of the Jump) stay dead center and have most weight in middle front of the boat. Hook hard right around the dog's leg, (to navigate this water you should be driving a TILLER, remote steering boats have to much slide) staying more right side of the channel. turning slight left around three pinks Above water mostly and then straight into open bay. After this there is only Two small sets first one Voyager Rapids stay left and second Voyager Chute stay in the middle. Once you arrived into Large bay this is the Western Channel of the French River. From here there no rapids for 20 miles, but still lots of under water Pinks. All in all it is very hard and tough water to fish and navigate, but it is my favorite of all places just for that reason. The water levels to watch out for are a low Bay and a High french river. Mostly Spring!! Happy Hunting to all )"

1285452,Fish_Heads,2011-03-22 13:08:00,154,"Brian.........is there anything left of the Voyageur Lodge that was above the rapids ?We used to go to the area in the early 80's when the Bad river lodge was open, then switched to the Voyageur after bad river was sold (privatized). Haven't been back there since about 1988 or so. Heard the Voyageur burned down soon after.Miss that night trolling the bad river below the rapids for eyes with 7"" rapalas !!Fish"
1286032,devy,2011-03-23 17:37:00,30,Fished the bad river a couple of times in the early 80's but fished the french around Recollet falls and flat rapids. Went went someone who knew exactely where to go down the bad. Left from Hartley House and went through numerous chutes until reached a spot where we would troll using rapalas below the rapids. Excellent fishing. Used to also fish below the train tressel that crossed the flat rapids at night. There were some dooozy walleye then. Heard that things went down in quality of fishing but apparently getting better. Had family who lived in Sudbury at the time
1286037,Fish_Heads,2011-03-23 17:47:00,154,Remember Hartley bay marina well..........had a party of 14 guys one year & had 30 cases of beer on the dock to take down river to camp......they were mad at us cause the dock was sinking ! The boy scout's there waiting to go to their camp thought we were running a store till we said it was all for us ! Ran out of beer on wed & had to send a couple guys to Sudbury for another 15 cases........took them all day before they got back............remember the evenings playing Molson poker till sun up !
1286885,devy,2011-03-25 13:01:00,30,that's a bit of drink there!! Remember grabbing beer at the four Corners brewer retailer and taking Hwy 69 to get the Hartleys. You guys got me beat though !!
