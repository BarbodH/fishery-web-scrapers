1306193,Jack77,2011-05-12 17:50:00,168,You don't have a lot of choices. We have stayed at some cottages at Cordley Lake ( I don't remember the name) and at Penock's Shores motel.
1306330,RapMasterPete,2011-05-13 05:54:00,2,Thanks for the input. We stayed at another lodge lodge last year and flew out of Nakina. We have never been to Jellicoe and wanted to stay at a decent place after a long drive from the Detroit area
1306331,Jack77,2011-05-13 05:57:00,168,"Sorry for the confusion, I thought that you were fying out of Nakina, I don't know about lodging in Jellicoe."
1310615,theeyeshaveit,2011-05-24 06:48:00,15,Try staying at Colimar Lodge in Jellicoe. George is the pilot for Ara Lake Camp. He and Fran run Colimar Lodge. Nice cabins and inexpensive for an overnighter.
1310734,Guest,2011-05-24 11:39:00,0,Didn't Colimar Lodge close up???
1208521,TIGHTLINER,2010-06-09 09:22:00,223,How many outfitters have outposts on these lakes and anyone know who they are??Thanks tightliner
1208778,adempsey,2010-06-09 23:37:00,963,Here are the ones I came across during my research:Meta:http://www.awonakina.com/meta.htmhttp://www.metalakelodgefishing.com/Welcome.htmlAra:http://www.aralakecamp.com/Brace:http://bracelakeoutfitters.com/
1208806,Mike Borger,2010-06-10 05:26:00,1554,When I fished ARA we noticed a really nice outpost camp several km's away from the other camps in the west end of the lake.Always figured if I went back that's where I'd stay.Did some research and it's owned by AMS Outposts:http://www.ontariowalleyefishingoutp...tpostcabin.htm
1302353,Guest,2011-05-03 07:27:00,0,Meta is good. Ara is better but Peninsular is the best! This outpost camp run by Ara Lodge is the only cabin on the lake and the fishing is outstanding. When we go we count on eating fish every day. We just bring the fixings. How many lakes can you do that?
1302403,camp chef,2011-05-03 08:50:00,915,Every Lake that I have ever been on in Canada
1305853,Terry from Toledo,2011-05-11 21:08:00,3,"Read and listen to GBRiii above message. He's right on.......we have been to Ara Camp over a dozen times. The best camp and best fishing is in Ara Lake.... much better than Meta. Shrirley, Brad and staff are just great.......and take the plan of having Shirley & co. cook breakfast and supper for you ! Once you taste her cooking, you'll never choose to cook in your cabin (plus more time to fish/relax and less to pack). Lots of walleyes, Pike, and Perch (they might be the most difficult to find........). Jigs, Rappelas trolled, spoons cast/troll, and if the weeds are up and water is rather flat - fish hoola poppers for Pike --- they'll hit on the surface !As you can tell, I can't say enough about Ara Camp.As a matter of fact, Doc, our ringleader for these trips is in assisted living quarters now. I just today took all of my Ara fishing photos (DVD) to Doc for him to view in his room on his DVD player !On a good day, my fishing partner Dave and I could land 100 Walleyes each, along with some Pike and possibly some Perch! (mostly jig fishing - typically did not need bait just artificial tails)Let me know if there is any way I can help..........but going to Ara Camp is a no-brainer choice ! Terry"
1305854,Terry from Toledo,2011-05-11 21:13:00,3,"Ara is the best camp, best of the lakes there and best owners & staff. Been there more than a dozen times - A+ every trip.Walleyes, Pike, Perch...........take spoons, jigs, tails, floating 5' Rappelas bronze and silver.Hope this helps. Terry"
1305857,Terry from Toledo,2011-05-11 21:16:00,3,"If that Outpost camp that faces south is what you are talking about, you better investigate it in person first. Unless it has changed it is a dump.Best option is to work with Ara Camp owners and either go to one of their outposts or stay at Ara. We've done both and don't even think about going to an outpost any more.Terry"
1305919,Jack77,2011-05-12 05:47:00,168,How often did you get blown off the lake at Ara? The fishing at Ara is great but I don't think it is any better than the other two lakes. I can not comment on the accomadations because I never stayed there. I do know that Ara lake can get very hairy when any kind of wind kicks up. The only time I have been truly concerned about my safety in a boat was trying to cross Ara lake right out in front of the camp and that was in a 18' cedar strip boat not one of the 14' or 16' aluminum boats that Ara has. The fishing on that entire chain is fantastic you can't go wrong with any of the outfitters there.
1306165,RapMasterPete,2011-05-12 15:48:00,2,Where should a group of 6 stay the night prior to leaving for Ara Lake Camp? Your input appreciated
1077747,theeyeshaveit,2009-02-01 06:12:00,15,My group is planning a trip to Ara Lake Camp for June of this year. Can anyone give us opinions/pointers on this lake and outfitter?
1078047,Slick Willy,2009-02-02 12:51:00,36,"Long-time outfitter ,great setting, cabins & fishing!"
1078192,onetimedave,2009-02-03 05:29:00,502,"You will have lots of water to fish. Ara, Meta, Brace Lakes and Meta Creek. Walleye, Pike, Perch primary fish. Have fished Meta with good success."
1078704,theeyeshaveit,2009-02-05 05:14:00,15,Would we be better off staying with Meta Lake Lodge or Brace Lake Lodge? Ara appears to be the much larger/deeper lake with more structure. Any insight?
1078712,onetimedave,2009-02-05 06:19:00,502,"If an outpost cabin will work, Arctic Watershed Outposts has one on an island 1/2 way down Meta. This would be convenient to fish all lakes and river. I believe cabin will sleep 8 and has a shower. You must cook yourself. I have a map of Meta if it will help. [email protected]"
1078739,theeyeshaveit,2009-02-05 09:03:00,15,I appreciate the information. I'm still leaning toward Ara Lake Camp. Looks like a great camp and I have had good conversations with the Fayle's. Any more information on the fishing would help.
1079203,gbriii,2009-02-07 10:38:00,1,"I have been there 12 of the last 15 years.It is a great camp to go to. They take good care of the place and the cabins are really nice. They have them that sleep 3,6 or 8 . They do have propane stove and fridge. even have a couple of showers.They have a bunch of solid boats and good motors. 14 ft with 9.9's. They do fly in every couple of days with the plane so if you forget something critical they can bring it in for you.You can do the plan where they will cook your dinner for you and I think they give you a lunch to take out too.There is a kid they have in camp, Brad. He makes sure things work. nice kid and he will point you in the right direction for good fishing spots. Tip him well and tell him G B sent ya. That way I mi9ght not have to tip him as muchShirley is the wife and she is in camp all the time so she makes sure that everyone has a good time and things are working. It is not a camp where they drop you off and the owners are never there or don't fix anything till they get enough complaints or when they get around to it.obviously they have really good walleye fishing, pike if you want. you get the occasional whitefish. perch have been really hit or miss. You have to be there at the right time. There are burbot in the lake but have not been able to get any of those. Not tried really hard btu they are there.G B IIIif you have any other questions you can shoot me a pm. I will be up there this year."
1208278,Guest,2010-06-08 18:27:00,0,"Just got back from a week at Meta Lake Lodge and I highly recommend them. great cabins with hot water, showers, wood stove, and full electricity. Very comfortable. Boats are 18 foot cedar boats with 9.9 johnson and evenrude motors. Food is great and the owner and his significant other are personable, helpful, and do everything possible to make your stay a great experience and ensure that thie fishing is all you expected and more. Bill and I caught 117 walleye the first day and many northerns. It was llike that every day. Easy access to Ara lake, Brace Lake, and Josie Lake all of which have outstanding fishing. If you have further questions email me at [email protected]"
1208373,adempsey,2010-06-08 23:13:00,963,"Both Ara and Meta were on my list for consideration this year. From my research you cannot go wrong with either place. However, this year we decided to go somewhere a little bit closer (I am from southwestern Ontario). Those three lakes are on my ""to visit"" list for sure though. http://www.ontariofisherman.com/top-5-lodges.htmSome info from another member who stayed on Ara (Solopaddler):http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/i...1&#entry217813Good luck!"
1208381,Mike Borger,2010-06-09 03:40:00,1554,"Yep, Ara was a fantastic lake I liked it a lot."
