The weather did not quite live up to the sunny forecasts issued earlier in the week but the fishing more than met expectations. Two of us and our guide managed to get fish at most of the spots we stopped and a couple of spots produced particularly well. Each of us probably caught 20 or more each day but many of the fish were slots or over slot. I was lucky to turn what I thought was a snag into a 28 inch Master walleye on Sunday which more than made up for the 2 Avid rods I broke on Saturday setting hooks on rocks or wood. The fish were very light biting most of the time so if you felt weight you had to go for the big hookset or risk missing the fish. I guess I was a little over anxious and heavy with my hooksets the first day out on the water. Thank goodness for lifetime rod warranties on Avid rods. The walleye were generally quite shallow, in many cases right on the shoreline if the wind was blowing in. We caught most of our fish casting and dragging or hopping light jigs and minnows over/through the rocks, sand or mud. The water was a chilly 47 degrees on Saturday but had warned up several degrees by Sunday after the relatively warm rains overnight. We were in T shirts by Sunday afternnoon when the sun finally poked through the cloud cover. The water was very low due to hydro needs at Ear Falls but the heavy draw off of water has ceased and levels are rising quickly, up probably 8 inches from Saturday to Sunday with some heavy rain assistance overnight. Rags is passable on idle with engine up and a couple of risk-taking guides took it on full plane on Sunday after the water had come up. On Sunday we hit a reef that was under water but which had been exposed and visible on the Saturday. Fortunately we were able to continue skegless with a lightly chewed prop. This reef is never an issue once water levels are at normal so extra care is warranted for the next while. We saw reefs we never knew existed in a couple of spots. Hope this helps get you stoked for your trip to Lac Seul if you are fortunate enough to be heading there this season. I am back on Lac Seul for a week starting next Saturday so hopefully it only gets better as the water heats up. Tight lines everyone."
