I was wondering what everyone's opinions on the Navionics Premium vs. the Lakemaster Legacy? Has any used the Navionics Platinum or Lakemaster Insight on the Canadian side of LOTW? Does the Navionics Premium ""North"" map have detailed contours/depths on the Canadian side of LOTW?"
1310751,1shooter,2011-05-24 12:19:00,1493,currently Lakemaster has way more details....
1310756,jswinter40,2011-05-24 12:23:00,127,without a doubt the Lakemaster LOW/Rainy chip has more detail.
