I love walleye, northerns & smallmouth, but any of the three, with fast action, would suffice. We'll be crossing at International Falls, so Western Ontario & possibly Manitoba are our targets. I prefer lakes with cover so fishing is possible in bad weather & try to avoid the largest open-water. Any suggestions?"

Depending on the time of year you can catch all the fish you want near the camp, Anderson's Manitou Falls Camp. My son catches 100 walleyes of the dock in the evenings. There are walleyes, northerns, muskies, and bass. Everything is included in the price, no hidden charges. I am not affiliated with the camp. I am a customer that enjoys seeing others enjoy the outdoors as much as I do."
1310572,szopster,2011-05-23 22:12:00,48,"I agree with jiggster, the English is very easy fishing in the Ear Falls area. Fantastic walleye, very good pike, plenty of whitefish if you target them and smallies every now and then. The river is very easy to run even in the roughest weather. At times it can get a little busy up by the dam, but run down river a bit and you'll be by yourself. Hard to beat the action below the power dam though. The locals limit out after supper fishing from shore. Troll deep diving cranks up river in the tailwaters, cross current with three ways, blade baits (Silver Buddies, Zips & VibE's) off the deeper ledges and jigs everywhere work well. Fishing with leeches should be illegal below the dam...."
1310682,KTroller,2011-05-24 09:31:00,237,Do you need to kill all fish in possession on the English River like you do on Las Seul? KT
1310730,DanM57,2011-05-24 11:31:00,135,Nope - at least not downstream from Manitou Falls
