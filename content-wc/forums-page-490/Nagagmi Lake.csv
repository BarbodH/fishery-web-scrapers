1310550,Seanik,2011-05-23 20:58:00,218,"Our group will be at Expeditions North for the 2nd time July 8-15, We booked immediately after our trip there in July 2010. This lodge was one of the best places we have been to in over 30+ years. The cabins are exceptional, the service from the employess was absolutely great and the outboard motors are newer 20 hp Nissans with electric start. The fishing was fast and furious each morning with 50 + Walleyes per boat before noon and we never started before 8:00 am. Our group ranges in age from 60-71 and the lodge people were there to help us into boats and they were on the dock when we returned to tie us up and assist in any way. Although this lake is not completely isolated, or and only 1 group at a time wilderness expierence, the security of a 25 minute flight to a hospital makes up for that shortcoming. Seanik"
