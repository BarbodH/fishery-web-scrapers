My searching returned these possibilities but I would really like a recommendation. Best Western - Sioux Lookout Inn Forest Inn & Conference Centre Lamplighter Motel Sunset Inn & Suites The Wellington Inn Thanks,"

Bar at Forest Inn is right across the road. The bar and restaurant with the float plane outside is just down the road at stumbling distance. Good parking for boats as well. We always stay there and fish Lac Suel via public landing at Deception bay or Hudson and makes for a very cheap trip with one truck/boat and 3-4 people."
1310738,fishman10,2011-05-24 11:42:00,226,"the best western is your best choice, although not cheap. bars close by. the lamplighter is cheaper but a little away from the bars. forget the wellington, and the sunset is full of rowdy natives."
1310743,jswinter40,2011-05-24 12:03:00,127,"I don't know what the lamplighter costs, but the best western was the same price (with a couple bucks) as Forest Inn. this was the summer before last at least (didn't make it up last summer). not sure where people are from but the Best Western is similar price to what you see around most of MN. $100 canadian I think per night or so. but again we would split among 3-4 guys so dirt cheap for a fishing vacation in Gods country."

1311114,Walleye_Wrangler,2011-05-25 09:45:00,138,I have also stayed at the Lamplighter and was happy. Clean and reasonable. Restaurants are about a mile away. Very nice paved hiking trail to town.
