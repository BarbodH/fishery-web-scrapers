What if you are on a lake that has a 2 fish limit but you took a road trip to a lake with the normal 4 fish limit. You keep your 4 fish from that lake to take home and put them in the freezer back at the 2 fish lake. Would they just bone you or take your word they were from a 4 fish lake or make you prove it? I know I could have the law call they lodge owner where I went and he would verify that I was in deed there and caught them there to take home."

I let them search my truck, and even offered them the opportunity to search me and my boat.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ht=perch+drugsIf I would have thought of it at the time, I could have told them to look at the trail on my GPS. I was never closer than 2.5 miles to Crystal Beach in Canada (Where they accused me of going ashore).In this area it's common to cross the Canadian line out on the lake multiple times during the day.Great Times We Live In... Can't even spend a relaxing day perch fishing...."
