If you've been there, I'd like to know what you think of the lake. And more importantly, how is the walleye fishing?"
1231486,Guest,2010-08-29 17:09:00,0,We are going again in Sept.11 to be exact. The lake has rocks but all lakes do. The owners will try to help you any way they can about the rocks. If you watch the map they give you you will be ok. Have been treated super well at this camp our 3 year. Walleye fishing is at it's best when you find them. Plenty of places to try and other lakes to go to buy boat if you want. Also a walk in lake that we have not tried yet but we have not tried the whole lake yet. Northerns are comon and some real big best we did last year was 39 1/2 right by camp. Was told they caught a 45 inch this year. My personal best a 43 inch. Cabins are clean and what you expect. Gas is the same as in town of ignace or what they payed to fill the tank no higher prices which is a plus for us. Drive back to camp is about 1 hour because of the road it's not bad. Also wintering lake is not far from camp fisning is good if you know where to go. Tell them bluefin boat owners told you it is great.

1309208,BD,2011-05-19 23:48:00,739,It's been a few years since I was there but I would go back again. The owners will know where to locate the best fishing spots and will give you up to date walleye info. IMHO the best northern spot in the lake is near the red rock you will see when you leave the bay the camp is located on and turn left around the point.
