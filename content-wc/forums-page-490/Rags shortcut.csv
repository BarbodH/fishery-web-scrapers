1310924,Guest,2011-05-24 20:02:00,0,Rags was strictly motor up and idle on Saturday. Saw one bowrider try to run it on plane and hit wood twice with the 115 Merc engine popping out of the water and the cowl flying off. Sunday saw the water come up about 8 inches and I saw 2 bowriders take it successfully on full plane. Not for the faint of heart and we idled through quite happily. It should be fine in a number of days if the water continues to rise at the current pace.
