3418130,NY Walleye,2015-01-04 07:05:00,78,I have driven by the outfitter the past two years and they look like nice places. My experience is any where you can drive too the fishing is not that good. I prefer fly in outfitters and the fishing has been fantastic. Some drive in you are lucky to catch 20 fish all week. One fly in we caught 530 wallrye in six days.
