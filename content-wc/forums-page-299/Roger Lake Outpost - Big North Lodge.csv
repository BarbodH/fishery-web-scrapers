3412058,ricksiewert,2015-01-01 12:12:00,5,Seriously considering a trip to Roger Lake this June w/ my boys. I have heard generally favorable feedback but there really isn't much available thru walleye central. Anyone else have some feedback on Roger Lake? Numbers Lake or size? both? Looks like primarily walleye and smallie wtih some northern. any feedback would be appreciated. didn't see much posted. ty
3412426,phishfearme,2015-01-01 15:35:00,1242,I think this is the same Roger Lake that Walston's has two large cabins on also:http://www.walstenoutposts.com/RogerLake.aspx three large cabin's on a lake that size scared me away when I booked chase lake with walston's. (they no longer have chase lake.) just know what you're getting into. phish

3412970,ricksiewert,2015-01-01 19:06:00,5,Sorry - i should have been more specific. I think we are talking about two different lakes. This is a fly in outpost with only two cabins on it - both owned and operated by Big North Lodge and Outfitters. Sorry for the confusion.

3413778,sloughboy,2015-01-02 06:46:00,13,"We fished the lake with Big North last year, first week of August. Everything you hear about the bass fishing is true. We were not bass fishermen and caught two just short of 19"" We did talk to several people who had been coming for 15 + years to fish bass there. We fished the main lake structures for walleye and did ok. We caught two 28"" eyes and several in the 25""range with a fair amount 18-22"" The service and equipment was excellent, Big North knows how to make sure your trip is successful. Yes Walstons does have two large cabins on the lake as well. It is my understanding that they are frequently empty. When we were there, both were full along with both of Big Norths cabins. Two many boats on a fly in lake when they are full. That was my only complaint on a very enjoyable trip."
