Contributors seem to have positive comments. I've grown quite weary of another popular website due to anonymous bashing and bickering. This other forum seems to just drain my energy level, rather than build it the way Walleye Central does. Are there other website chatrooms/forums that focus towards walleye fishing and/or fishing in Canada? If so, I would like to investigate them during the upcoming winter months. Many thanks in advance."
