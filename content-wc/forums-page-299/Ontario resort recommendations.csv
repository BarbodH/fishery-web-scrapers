I've gone to LOTW every year since 1983, and have stayed at Obabikon the last 8 years, and it's the best resort I've experienced up there. I've done everything from fancy/expensive camps near Nestor Falls, to houseboats in Miles Bay, to camps in Whitefish Bay, to low-cost cabins in other remote parts of the lake. Nothing compares to what Obabikon has to offer. The single best feature has to be the proximity to excellent fishing. It's not unusual to catch a limit of walleye from the dock before leaving camp for the day (not an exaggeration). The best walleye fishing spots I've found on the entire lake are within a 3 minute ride of camp. There are crappie at the dock, smallmouth all over the adjacent islands, and more northern pike than you can ever catch up in Obabikon Lake, which is only 10 minutes away. Plus fat musky all over Miles Bay. Aside from the fishing, the camp owner Jared is one of the most fair guys I've ever dealt with. We were thrilled when we found him. After going to the same resort in Nestor Falls for 15 years, we were forced to find new accommodations when a new owner took over, and he was a bit shady. After trial and error at various camps all over Lake of the Woods (including an encounter with a terribly crooked houseboat operation), we eventually found Obabikon, and would never dream of going somewhere else. It's nice knowing that we get to deal with an honest and fair guy on our annual fishing trip (especially after running into some unsavory critters along the way). I would strongly recommend giving Obabikon a try. I've recommended the camp to a few of my more fussy friends, and they all agreed that it's a great place to stay. And if you like catching and eating walleye, seriously, don't bother with another place until you give Obabikon a try. The walleye fishing is just insane."
3417306,dutchboy,2015-01-03 17:51:00,5717,Will you be at the Mpls. Sports Show in March?
3417330,Obabikon,2015-01-03 17:55:00,2370,Absolutely. One of my favorite shows. In my opinion it has gotten progressively better the past 3 years.
3417386,dutchboy,2015-01-03 18:11:00,5717,Thanks Jared. we will see you there. Just took a spin through your web site. Looks like you have a nice set-up there. Where do people leave there trucks and trailers to boat into your place?
3417690,jackmaloney,2015-01-03 20:28:00,9,You park the trucks and trailers at the Morson Marina. No additional cost.
3417722,jackmaloney,2015-01-03 20:38:00,9,This youtube video of the resort is pretty cool as well:http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aKB3dAD4GqY

3413890,Hawker,2015-01-02 07:29:00,3967,"While I know there are tons of great places, I personally can only recommend one in particular, Young's Wilderness Camp! I say that because it's the only one my wife and I have been going to for the past 24 years straight as it offers everything we could possibly want!! Located on an island approximately five minutes by boat from the landing, it offers great fishing (walleye, pike, crappie, smallmouth & largemouth bass, muskie, perch), superb service, fully modern cabins with rustic north country appeal, amazing food, excellent boats & motors, excellent staff!! They also have a fly-in camp just 15 minutes away that offers some of the best smallmouth and muskie fishing you could hope for!!Great place, can't recommend it highly enough!!!(http://youngswildernesscamp.com/)"
3414122,Obabikon,2015-01-02 08:24:00,2370,"Find a few that you're interested in, and go down to the shows. Meeting people in person is a great way to decide between a bunch of great places!"
3414402,Walleye507,2015-01-02 10:15:00,193,Lukinto Lake Lodge near Longlac. Excellent place IMO.http://www.lukintolakelodge.com/
3414722,billy weaver,2015-01-02 12:39:00,470,"There are so many great fishing camps in North-west Ontario that it really hard to choose. I go to Peffley's Wilderness Camp and have for quite a few years, check out their web-site. Its on Wabaskang Lake which is a easy lake to fish with many bays and arms, so its like a series of smaller lakes making it easy to get out of the wind and away from rough water."
3414738,KM1,2015-01-02 12:40:00,374,"I have been to several, and spent a couple trips at my Uncles cabin in Sioux Narrows, on Lake of the Woods. Also fished out of a camp on Perrault and Lac Seul. By FAR the best place I have been is Witch Bay Camp. After being there.....won't go anywhere else. Great fishing, food, accommodations, guests, lodge staff....everything. That is my pic!!!"
