The person at the photo counter was ready to take my picture and the flash would not go off. He told me to hold my head down just a bit, there was too much reflection coming off my forehead so the camera flash was sensing too much light. I know I have a receding hairline but how about a break for something as simple as a passport picture? I just can't win."
