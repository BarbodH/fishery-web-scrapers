I learned that while fines related to fishing/hunting offences can be paid to local municipalities (in your case City of Dryden), the local municipalities eventually have to process the fine payment and make the appropriate payment to the Ontario MNR."
3421602,Downrigger,2015-01-05 13:35:00,60,Just curious. couple years ago fined for freezing catch in ziplock bag such that agent could not clearly see number enclosed. fine was payable to city of Dryden. What is link between MNR and city of Dryden? Just curious.
3421890,kzoofisher,2015-01-05 15:02:00,5144,"No idea about the MNR and Dryden but..... You often hear around here that the MiDNR writes BS tickets so they can add funds to their budget. The infraction is usually described as something minor and the ticketee feels like a warning would have been given if it wasn't a money grab. The fact is that in Michigan at least, all fines from fishing and wildlife infractions get paid to the local government where the infraction occurred. Enforcing fish and game regulations is a cost for the MiDNR and the only benefits are the intangible ones of how bad it might be without enforcement. I think that is the right way to do it. Anytime a government agency can profit from enforcing regulations it increases the motives for, and likelihood of, abuse. It only takes one case of abuse to paint all the honorable officers with the same brush. Maybe some of the Ontario residents can tell us if it is the same there. I'd be curious as to how Michigan compares to other states as well."
3421970,Downrigger,2015-01-05 15:20:00,60,"Appreciate your insite. One reason I am curious, is that I read so many post this past year about the MNR being short of funds, and the fines not going to their account."
3422130,phishfearme,2015-01-05 16:09:00,1242,"[QUOTE= I'd be curious as to how Michigan compares to other states as well.[/QUOTE] in PA, all game, fish and boating fines go into the state general fund. phish"
3422642,kzoofisher,2015-01-05 19:04:00,5144,Thanks. It makes sense. Also makes me wonder about the property seizure abuses that you hear about sometimes. I know there are different rules and somethings fall uner Fed jurisdiction but I dislike the practice on principle.
3423130,tackleman,2015-01-06 05:55:00,444,"years ago the provincial government downloaded the cost of providing certain services onto the municipal taxpayer, in return they were given the ability to collect the fines from provincial offenses. since the mnr is a provincial entity any fines imposed by them go to the municipality that has them in their jurisdiction. that is why you paid the city of Dryden."
3423426,Downrigger,2015-01-06 08:36:00,60,"Mystery solved, much thanks. Have 'Food Saver' now so won't have to worry about freezing catch correctly."
3423554,3M TA3,2015-01-06 09:13:00,2846,"Actually, I don't think this is quite right. According to my neighbor, an MIDNR Conservation Officer, the DNR typically gets a $10 Conservation fee in most all cases, and restitution for all fish and game offenses. The locals get all others, such as fines for improper ATV or snowmobile operations, improper fishing hardware, improper shot in gun, fishing or hunting without a license, etc. So I believe, as you stated above, that ""all fines from fishing and wildlife infractions get paid to the local government where the infraction occurred"" is partly incorrect. My understanding anyway."
3424562,retire55,2015-01-06 15:55:00,1029,"Did your fine occur in Dryden, Ontario or somewhere else?"
3424658,Downrigger,2015-01-06 16:43:00,60,"My fine originated from Abram Lake Park, on Abram lake. just south of Sioux Lookout. The MNR came through the camp grounds, into our trailer and emptied our freezer, checking all catches."
