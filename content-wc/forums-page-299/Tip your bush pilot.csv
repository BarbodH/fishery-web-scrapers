3411874,Ebarnett,2015-01-01 11:00:00,60,"Im not a cheapo by any means, but after our group drops $6000 - $8000 on an outpost, why is it nessessary to tip the pilot? Does he not get paid out of that chunk of money? If he doesnt, then i totally understand and will gladly tip and encourage my group to tip the pilot. My point being, these are not cheap trips, in fact they are substantially higher priced than a drive in because of the fly in service. I just always thought the extra $300-$500 per man for a fly in was for the plane and pilot. Anyway, before you scold me for being a cheapskate, help me to understand why tipping the pilot is customary."
3412010,Pikeslayer8,2015-01-01 11:49:00,1460,"I have no idea what my outfitter pays his pilots, nor do I care to know the specifics. I do know that the turnover on pilots is dang near nonexistent, so it must be a great gig. Awesome, it should be. These brave pilots provide an extreme service so we can have our adventures in the bush. I think that the vast majority of these pilots are typical of the incredible pilots at ""Northern Wilderness Outfitters"" in that, I don't think they need or expect a tip for providing outstanding service for their clients. I do know that when we go in, Brad or Chris or Brian will double check that the camp is in perfect working order, or they will fix it. They do so much more than just shuttle us to and from fishcamp! It's really nothing more than what kind of relationship do you want to have with your outfitter and his people. I tip my pilot because they hold the keys to my kingdom. I tip my pilot because it shows honor to their profession and what they do. I tip my bush pilot because it makes me happy."
3412074,Ebarnett,2015-01-01 12:14:00,60,Thats a good response. We have only taken two fly-ins and tipping is something i did not realize. But it is a small kind gesture. Good relationships with quality ottfitters is important.
3412098,NY Walleye,2015-01-01 12:30:00,78,"I always tip the pilot. I tip them on the way in so they don't forgot me, and I tip them on the way out. Every time they have been very thankful for the tip. I think it is important."
3412106,Pikeslayer8,2015-01-01 12:32:00,1460,"I know, right. When my Dad died in 2008, we were left without our honcho. That next year we were scrambling to figure out the same logistics as your original question. The last 4 years, I've been privileged to be able to tip Brad, in addition to his monetary tip, a gallon of my Walleye Chowder. He shared with me this year, that he takes the chowder home in Dryden, freezes it, and breaks it out for his ""fancy eatin"" meals."
1333737,joeman79,2011-07-25 14:49:00,417,The original idea with this thread was a joke in reference to previous thread where MUSHMOuth or whatever his handle is compared Canadian Game Wardens to Nazi Germany Gestapo Officers. He himself had never been checked but he was NEVER going back to Canada because of the inhumane way they treated fisherman. WEIRD!!!!!!!!!!! So when on a previous reply on this thread that said tipping pilots only promoted alcholism. It was a joke. I will tip our pilot if he is courteous and helps unload our gear u bet I will.
1335747,Guest,2011-07-31 00:39:00,0,"Our group of 4 has been flying with Hidden Bay Lodge in Sioux Lookout for years now. We love the fishing at Miniss lake. Hidden Bays pilots are probably some of the best in the industry. Very friendly! Dave and Shaggy are great. They take care of us very well. They check out the boats, cabin, gas propane and any odds and ends for us before they fly off. They are always a great help We are glad to tip at least $50 for the flight in and again on the flight back. We appreciate everything they do for us!"
1340565,Guest,2011-08-15 13:54:00,0,"Dave, SHAGGY, and Tony are without are the top bush pilots. All with well over 10000 hours. I know that they take time off from flying the big jets to get back into real bush flying."
1420623,Pikeslayer8,2012-04-13 12:55:00,1460,"As this new fly-in season is soon to begin, I want to bring this thread back to the top. It started out as a joke when ole Mushmouth was being an irritation to the board. So cmon fellas take care of the people you entrust your lives to and take us to our slice of heaven. Don't be one of ""them"" guys."
1420651,wallydave,2012-04-13 14:29:00,2151,Don't be that guy! You mean like Mushmouth!?It started out as a joke when ole Mushmouth was being an irritation to the board.
1420676,5 of Diamonds,2012-04-13 15:32:00,151,Gospel. This thread should always be front and center this time of year. Great call.
1420829,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-13 23:05:00,235,I think we tip our pilot on the flight home. My friend's dad is the trip organizer and he takes care of it and we just pay him after. I wanna say we give about $60. We ask them to kick a few bucks to the dock hands out of that. Sounds like we're cheap compared to others here.
1420905,octanehi5,2012-04-14 08:25:00,1104,"Aways tip your pilot In and out we tip $20 per man, small price to pay for a geat trip. Have a great trip this yr we are 10 weeks and counting"
1420921,CSH Kucinski,2012-04-14 09:23:00,1340,We have been flying Air Cochrane for years and we always tip the pilot and the guys at the dock who load and unload the plane. It goes a long way and they will always remember you.
2843025,Pikeslayer8,2014-05-28 20:02:00,1460,"Yup, lets bring this back up as a reminder."
1330296,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-15 17:17:00,1460,Today Mushmouth thread of the day. I go with 60$ both flights. We have known some of these amazing men for many years. Hope I'm not cheap. Coming out with left over chowder. Chowder for the crew at the outfitters
1330324,HeHooksHimself,2011-07-15 19:16:00,725,Tipping bush pilots promotes alcoholism. Everyone knows all those guys do is drink and fly.
1330516,Opti-Mist,2011-07-16 15:09:00,1402,That does not compute. There is no connection between normal behavior and alcoholism.
1330532,tight line,2011-07-16 16:04:00,37,5 of us went to Beteau with Eddie north we tipped are pilot $50
1332444,J.Iverson,2011-07-21 12:41:00,64,You gave Chris $60.....yes there will be some beer purchased.
1332464,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-21 13:30:00,1460,Chris is great. Brad is the man! Years ago one of em let me fly the plane almost half the way. Entire control. I really doubt you can do that anymore.
1332468,J.Iverson,2011-07-21 13:44:00,64,"I think you still can if they know you, I flew the otter back to base in June this year. Brad is definately the man, one of the best in the biz."
1332547,5 of Diamonds,2011-07-21 16:51:00,151,We usually tip our pilot $50 going in and $50 coming out.
1333614,octanehi5,2011-07-25 09:42:00,1104,"I have been flying into northern Quebec for twenty yrs. we always tip the pilot, who cares what he does with it, he will remember you next time"
1333625,Stehle1,2011-07-25 10:03:00,22,"I hope ours remembers that we didn't tip him. He was caustic and irritable. We later found out that he owned the service. The camp owner uses this service and hasn't had any issues with him. However, there aren't any other services around to compete against. We did tip the dock guys, though, rather handsomely for putting up with this pilot. The one dock guy was the pilots son, who just rolled his eyes after his fathers first tirade. Putting up with that guy was only 40 minutes of my trip. Not a big deal. He got us there and back safely."
