3388434,Bigstorm,2014-12-23 11:05:00,799,"Fish seem to bite just as good on salted minnows, plastics and crawlers, but I can see where this would make things much tougher on bait shops and suppliers"
3389682,Obabikon,2014-12-23 19:36:00,2370,Seems a bit excessive.
3392402,prov1800,2014-12-24 20:04:00,5010,I think the mnr should have there own comedy show.they cant manage nothing properly.think they should be more concerned what tgey let into our water with all the shipping thats going on.minnows and leeches caught in our waters are no threat and never have been.look at how they managed our moose herd here in ontario.now its to late to do anything about that.they try to look busy and do studies for a few million bucks and they come up with no solutions.got no respect for them.
3392618,bigwillies,2014-12-24 23:39:00,515,i agree.astounds me how incompitend they get when they spend tax payers money.
3393258,SinOrSwim,2014-12-25 09:18:00,1528,"Our lodge was telling us about the points and how it is so difficult to get points to get tags. Lodges buy and sell points etc. It was interesting. Can you explain how that works? And, more about the moose population. What happened etc. I'd be interested in hearing more."
3394090,Skywagon,2014-12-25 17:51:00,1106,"The problem is they sell too many adult moose tags, if you apply and don't get an adult tag, you automatically get a calf tag (make a lot of sense?). Even though numbers are down, they are still selling tags for the baby makers (cows) along with calves. The reason for issuing all those tags, is it brings in more dollars to MNR. Another problem is one particular group of Canadians has been given carte blanche on all fish and game laws and can shoot as many moose as they want, any time they want (all year), free of any game rules that everyone else must follow. Though it is not permissible for anyone to hunt at night, it commonly known (at least in my neighborhood) many in this group do, they are all but untouchable, (think ACLU Canadian style), MNR seems to leave this group alone. Those problems, along with loss of habitat and brain worm, have about decimated the moose herd in many Wildlife Management units (WMU's). It should never have come down to this, but with MNR, it seems to be all about dollars and not wildlife management."
3395082,Fisherman Ted,2014-12-26 08:28:00,461,"Perhaps the flaming of MNR is a little much, or pre-mature. This is just a study the results of which there will ALWAYS be two sides. When any government agency makes a decision people will be upset. Funny that a few threads ago we lauded them for catching poachers but now get a whiff of changing bait regulations (some of which other provinces have employed for years) and they are now the enemy. These guys are severely understaffed and certainly underpaid. The guys in the field that I have met in my travels work extremely hard and are dedicated to what they do, including protecting the resources of the province. Let's see what they come up with along with their reasoning first. And for the record I am a lodge owner and many policy changes by MNR have an exponential effect on my business more than the average fisherman. You can bet that my lodge brethren and various lodge organizations are watching this (and other similar strategies) closely and do our best to work with MNR with advice, criticism and counsel whenever we can. We have far more to lose with a misguided policy. Merry Christmas all. -FT"
3395666,Downrigger,2014-12-26 13:17:00,60,"My bad - couple years ago I was fined for freezing fish in a ziplock bag, the fish bent over such that a count was not readily visible. Did not violate any other regs, size, number, etc. The curious part is that my fine was payable to the city of Dryden, Ontario. Wondering the connection. The fine was $125 which I thought quite out of line, and a bit greedy, but it did get my attention."
