3389850,polaris-pete,2014-12-23 20:44:00,343,Can someone tell me when an Ontario Fishing license expires? Does it go from the month you buy it until that month next Year or is it a fixed date say December to December? Thanks in advance.
3389890,BornToFish,2014-12-23 20:53:00,1224,I'm fairly certain that it's annual - 01 January to 31 December.

3390522,RickOnt,2014-12-24 06:16:00,217,Yes Pete the guys are right. It would expire Dec 31.

3390666,Obabikon,2014-12-24 06:53:00,2370,I am 100% sure that outdoor cards and seasonal fishing licenses are by the year. The last day would always be December 31st of the expiration year on the card/license.

3391698,RickOnt,2014-12-24 12:15:00,217,That's right Connie and good for you!! However the MNR is talking about charging you mature Gents for their Outdoors card/fishing license. I have heard half price for 2016
