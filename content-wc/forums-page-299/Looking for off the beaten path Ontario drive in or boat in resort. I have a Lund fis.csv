3415426,unclepaully,2015-01-02 18:46:00,112,I've heard good things about this place. I believe it's the only camp on the lake. http://www.holinshead.ca/
3415554,btyreprich,2015-01-02 20:04:00,1067,Times 2 on Old Post & Village. I fished this lake several times staying at this resort. They run a nice operation. Lake St Joseph has large numbers of Walleyes for sure but our group has always caught larger fish on Lac Seul.
3417658,Whopper,2015-01-03 20:19:00,340,Take a look at Holinshead Resort north of Thunder Bay but south of Armstrong. Only camp on the lake and plenty of walleye
3418554,north560,2015-01-04 10:34:00,53,"Hi you never said how far you want to drive, I like to fish at Gowbushkon Lodge in Gowganda.Lots of good fishing all around that area."
3419058,John N,2015-01-04 13:46:00,362,"I agree with Fred G. and St Joe Guy. That place exists. It's The Old Post Lodge in NW Ontario. Terrific fishing, cushy and comfortable camp, very rarely will you see others on the water (like maybe not at all during your trip), and some of us have brought our own boats for years. www.oldpost.com John"
3419218,Bill Krejca,2015-01-04 15:06:00,6107,O'Sullivan's Rainbow would probably work well for you. Very secluded and good fishing. Bill
3419354,Mich_Fisherman,2015-01-04 15:47:00,292,x3 for O'Sullivan. Way up there in Nakina but the fishing is up there with most fly ins and the scenery is unbelievable.
3421346,MrSimon,2015-01-05 11:22:00,922,Happy Day Lodge on Lake Windermere is a drive-to lodge that has a great boat-to outpost. The outpost is about an hour from the main lodge. It's a big lake with no other lodges. You will feel like you have the entire lake to yourself. We stayed at the outpost a few years back and saw only one other boat the entire week.

3422610,Walleye507,2015-01-05 18:58:00,193,"Lukinto Lake Lodge near Longlac, ON. Many of the lakes around them might be fished 30 days in a year. Fernow lake is my favorite in that area."
3414170,carterjarett,2015-01-02 08:40:00,2,Trying to find a remote off the beaten path Ontario resort. Must be drive in or boat in. I have a Lund fisherman. A place that doesn't have a lot of other fisherman on it.
3414450,bigwalleye1,2015-01-02 10:23:00,2632,"Not to be cute here, but a drive to or boat to remote resort that doesn't have a lot of other fishermen? Uh, if that place existed, we'd likely have found it by now and we'd all be going there. Sounds like you want a fly in camp that you can drive to... You'll find most places in Canada have traffic to some degree. It's about how far you want to travel from the landing. I fish Lac Seul, and other than traffic at the landing, I can go places every day where I never see another boat, or, if I do, it's from a great distance. Nobody fishes by everybody else. It's about finding spots and finding fish."
3414538,Guest,2015-01-02 11:31:00,0,"Search for boat-in outposts, moderate numbers of choices out there."
3414594,elkman99,2015-01-02 11:53:00,180,Wine lake might fit the bill for you.
3414682,billy weaver,2015-01-02 12:24:00,470,Wine Lake is a good lake without a lot of other boats. But you have to portage your boat to get there. If it is not a 14 ft. light aluminum boat that is really not an option.
3414778,Fred_G,2015-01-02 12:51:00,908,Here's my favorite:http://www.oldpost.com/
3414898,stjoeguy,2015-01-02 14:18:00,979,"I agree with Fred. Drive to, boat in, with no other boat traffic is the description of Lake St. Joseph. These are the only 3 camps on the 90 mile long lake with no public access:http://www.winoga.com/outpost-locations/lake-st-joseph/http://www.lakestjoseph.com/HOME.htmlhttp://www.oldpost.comThe Winoga Lodge outpost cabin is literally like a fly-in cabin that you boat in to. It's 25 miles from the nearest cabin. I hate to speak too loudly, because as mentioned before, if everyone knew about it they'd all go there. Just don't take my spot in June!"
3415002,Mike Borger,2015-01-02 15:08:00,1554,Lots of guys on this board are a big fan of O'Sullivan's Rainbow on O'Sullivan lake north of Nakina. They even have a water access outpost camp that looks pretty nice.http://osullivansrainbow.com/
3415074,adempsey,2015-01-02 15:33:00,963,"Probably O'Sullivans or maybe something on Caribou Lake, north of Armstrong.http://www.forrestlodge.com/http://www.cariboulakelodge.com/"
3415314,tackleman,2015-01-02 17:44:00,444,"look up stormer lake lodge, on nungessor road north of red lake, it's the only camp on the lake, drive to and is a full American plan resort.. great fishing"
