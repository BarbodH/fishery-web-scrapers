3421426,Pymbet,2015-01-05 11:48:00,42,"Thanks for another great report.And from an Apisabigo veteran's perspective, it was spot on.I was a little apprehensive seeing that you were reporting on a lake that our group has been to five times and will likely be to in the future. But your information will be invaluable to others going there and the whole purpose of this board is to share fishing information so that we all can have the best experience.The only thing I would add, and I would appreciate your opinion, is a reminder for all of us to respect the small portage lakes of the world.As you note, some can be very good fisheries Â– but many, like the upper portage lake at Apisabigo, are probably pretty fragile.We can enjoy a shore lunch on a small portage lake once a week, but in my humble opinion, no matter where you are, fish from the main lake are usually best for the dinners back at camp!Hope you have a great 2015."
3421538,Mike Borger,2015-01-05 12:42:00,1554,"Glad you enjoyed the report and I agree with you 150% on not abusing the back lakes. I do a lot of these trips and can honestly say I've never brought fish home with me, and all the larger fish go back. We enjoy a few meals of fish while we're there and that's it. I do know speaking with Martin Wearn that he's taking his role as caretaker of the resource very seriously. To the best of knowledge he's making all of the back lakes 100% catch and release which I'm sure is good news to you. Side note but I wish I'd have been able to pick your brain about Apisabigo before flying in, I'm sure it would have been a big help. On the off chance you've fished more of the Air Dale camps I'm slated to fish Nameigos, Dave and Mank this year. ANY feedback would be great! Cheers, Mike"
3421578,Pymbet,2015-01-05 13:21:00,42,"Mike, We fished Namiegos 20 years ago, but have never been to Dave or Mank. Namiegos is a relatively shallow lake and we went in late-July. By that time, the lake had a pretty healthy crop of greenery. In those days, we were not good enough or patient enough fisherman to go into the weeds after them and found most of our fish along the weed edges - trolling shallow lures (Bombers) or tossing a jig. It was admittedly tougher fishing for us than other lakes, but that was more a factor of our inexperience getting walleye out weeds. We still aren't great fishermen, but I would love to have another chance at that lake some day with better experience. If you go early in the year, I would expect it to fish differently and would bet that this is a good early season lake. I think Air Dale advertises, or I read somewhere, that the shallower north end of the lake is really best fished early in the year and can be difficult to motor about late in the year. Good luck. Jim ps. I would have given you the honest scoop on Apisabigo, but probably would have left out some details...... But as I kept reading, I could see that you figured it out 110%!"
3421650,Mike Borger,2015-01-05 13:57:00,1554,Thanks for the feedback on Nameigos Jim and LOL at your last comment. I'm fishing Nameigos in late May so I'm sure we'll be approaching things differently. Will be fun figuring things out.
3422650,Blades-n-Beads,2015-01-05 19:05:00,484,"Mike, simply fantastic . I could watch and read those all night. My hat off to you for taking the time, you go above and beyond what most would do. Thank you Blades"
3422762,pitbull,2015-01-05 19:31:00,45,"Mike, another great presentation of a Great Fishing Fly-In trip. Looks good for a family trip. Thanks again, Ken Baker"
3422946,HeHooksHimself,2015-01-05 21:00:00,725,"Thanks Mike, it sure does get the juices flowing for our spring trip. One question, do you find handling the fish rather than using a net or cradle is easier or better for the fish? It scared me watching how close those lure hooks would come to your hand when the fish thrashed at the boat. I figured there must be some reason. Thanks in advance. Hooks"
3422962,Mike Borger,2015-01-05 21:15:00,1554,"Thanks guys I truly appreciate the positive comments! Glad you liked! I always use a cradle for larger pike 40"" plus or REALLY huge walleye. On fly in's I find the cradle more convenient as well as it stows away so nicely in the smaller boats. Anything else I grab them by hand behind the gill plates. Can't speak for anyone else but I just find it quicker and easier. Depending on the net a twin set of trebles is a huge pita to untangle once a fish is in and thrashing around. The rubber nets are great but I rarely bring them on fly ins cause they're too heavy. You do have to be careful grabbing fish when there's a stickbait hanging out of their mouth. Typically by the end of a trip my hands are sliced and cut to ribbons (mostly gill plates). To me it's always been the hallmark of a good trip."
3423018,Knoxabilly,2015-01-05 22:25:00,225,Love reading your reports. Great read at 11:30pm in Iowa while the snow if piling up outside my door. Can't wait for Spring trip!
3415450,Mike Borger,2015-01-02 19:06:00,1554,"Last year I ran a contest in conjunction with Ontario Out Of Doors magazine and Park's Fly In Fishing for two lucky winners to join me on a 4 night fly in fishing trip.The trip happened in late September and was an enormous success!Great outpost camp, fantastic weather, beautiful fish filled lake and an interesting back lake that held some big surprises! I don't think I could have scripted this trip any better.My fall was crazy busy between guiding and writing and only now have I had time to put something together.This one is long overdue, have a look! http://www.canadafishingguide.net/ap...ntest-winners/"
3416178,new hips,2015-01-03 08:09:00,498,Thanks for another great trip report..........its a good read on a winter day.You keep giving me great ideas for my next fishing adventures.
3416402,retire55,2015-01-03 09:50:00,1029,"Thanks Mike for taking the time to put together your report. As usual, a very enjoyable read with great pics and videos."
3416514,Pooch,2015-01-03 10:21:00,4619,Watching these videos makes for a very long winter! Thanks for sharing.Pooch
3416554,unclepaully,2015-01-03 10:37:00,112,"Great report Mike. Wow, that is beautiful plane that Watsons operates."
3417170,Ogoki,2015-01-03 17:03:00,291,"Mike, Will Watsons be doing the flying for Martin? I just got Hawk Airs newsletter yesterday and they stated they would not be doing any flying this year for Air-Dale , as they had the past three years."
3417338,Mike Borger,2015-01-03 17:57:00,1554,"Thanks for the kind words guys, glad you liked. Yep, thankfully Watson's is doing all the flying now for Martin. Not a fan of Hawk Air."
3417498,Ogoki,2015-01-03 18:49:00,291,"I used Hawk Air in 1987 and have NOT been back either. Still on their mailing list for some reason . The only time we used them , we were left three days without gasoline ."
3417618,Mike Borger,2015-01-03 20:01:00,1554,"As much as I dislike them that's kind of surprising. But then I think they'd only been operating for a couple years at that point and were still learning.I could easily top your gas story, but I'm not going to say anything publicly. If you ask me privately though you'll get an earful. In an attempt to be positive they do have some great camps on some nice lakes and many of their customers enjoy their experience."
3417778,forgop,2015-01-03 22:15:00,880,"Is Watson's the place that is literally like on the very southwest corner of the lake just as you leave Wawa? If so, that'd be really nice. Only used Hawk Air the one time and can't say I had any issues with them at all."
