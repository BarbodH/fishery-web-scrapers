I started thinking that there might be broader definitions to this term. How do you interpret the word ""rigging""? Many thanks in advance."
3393898,JOE WALLEYE,2014-12-25 16:08:00,753,"To me rigging means slip sinker ""Lindy"" rig."
3393914,97roughneck,2014-12-25 16:11:00,899,"I always took it to mean the accessories that were added to the boat to enhance your experience. For example, installing trolling motor, kicker, especially electronics, ie; linking the graphs and the trolling motor. Rod holders, ect. Just anything that you added after the fact. However, I could be completely full of it."
3393946,maddogg,2014-12-25 16:27:00,178,Riggin means to me tying knots and adding something to your line.

3394346,h8go4s,2014-12-25 20:38:00,1673,"As a walleye fishing technique, I believe it began as an abbreviation for Lindy rigging, but probably has evolved to mean different things to different people."

3400842,KraTToR,2014-12-28 17:55:00,681,"All kidding aside, bottom bouncing is just that, bottom bouncing. Riggin`is the use of a slip sinker (lindy style or otherwise) attached to your main line, above a swivel and leader with a live bait presentation - a finesse technique. Sometimes a floating attractor is used, sometimes a worm that inflated to float up off the bottom, sometimes just a worm, leech, or minnow.Yes, a lindy rig or whatever has evolved from that."
