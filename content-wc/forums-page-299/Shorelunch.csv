A pound of bacon slices crossways 1/2 in wide, fried 3/4 of the way, grease and all in another bag when cool. Start the bacon going, add the spuds to the pan, when the edges crisp, crack in a dozen eggs and start scrambling. That is a meal for a king, and an ice cold muskmelon plucked from the depths of the cooler is a fitting desert. Cube fresh walleye at 3/4 inches. Dust in your favorite dry mix and fry. Put a bunch in a flour tortilla, add grated cheese, onions, salsa and cilantro, shredded lettuce or cabbage, for a little crunch, maybe a little Cholula hot sauce and sour cream. Very easy for a shore lunch if you plan a little. For regular shore lunch, I cheat and used canned sliced spuds. When they're close to ready, dump in a can of beans and let them warm. Yup, I know...beands and spuds together...don't knock it until you try it. Don't discount hush puppies as a spud substitute, along with the previously mentioned onion rings. +1 on canned pears or peaches. I'm stealing the wild rice idea. Whle I like fish sandwiches, my only downside is all that bun."
3380850,@Lunker,2014-12-20 10:19:00,835,"My guys do shore lunch back at the cabin every day and that's the only way this side is possible.....deep fried cheese curds. Turned them on to this a few years ago and now they're always making sure I'm picking up the curds on my way up. Yeah, pre-prep is a bit putzy but the boys love 'em. Thing is, they have to be frozen when you put them into the oil. When I get to camp, I spread the curds out on a cookie sheet and freeze individually. Transfer to a gallon zip loc and keep frozen. This allows you to scoop out a couple handfuls for each meal. Coat with beer batter, drop in the oil, and cook until a deep golden brown. If you try this with refrigerated / unfrozen curds, they just turn into a glob of gunk. Or....it's something you can certainly do at home when you're having a fish fry."

3387482,NWwalleye,2014-12-23 06:12:00,223,coleslaw is a good side dish ...

3370434,SinOrSwim,2014-12-16 07:32:00,1528,"Wait, you keep your food in the cooler you keep your fish? Maybe we do things wrong but the coolers we put our fish in are disgusting after those fish have been in there. bloody and the northern slime. I just vomited in my mouth thinking about that. LOLSlaw is a good idea. Also, can use it to top your walleye tacos. Fry up some bacon and break into bits before you go. Take a ziplock bag of it with you to shore lunch. You can add on top of your fish tacos and/or add to the fried potatoes and onions."
3370490,Xplorer,2014-12-16 07:44:00,244,"I've been making fried onion and bacon sammies (on hamburger buns) as an app/side with shorelunch that last couple years, along with a standard beans/corn and or fried potatoes. Yummy and easy."
3370586,adempsey,2014-12-16 08:05:00,963,Throw them in some chocolate pudding for an even better dessert!!
3371178,Lambertson Rock Guy,2014-12-16 11:29:00,20,"Wild rice from a can, sliced mushrooms, water chestnuts, and a little soy sauce. Walleye sandwiches, wild rice, Lays chips from a tube so they don't get crushed, and a cookie or two. Something a little different than our usual fish, spuds, and beans."

3372370,btyreprich,2014-12-16 18:50:00,1067,The cooler we use does a very good job in keeping the ice solid - even in the warm days if August. Not too much water in the cooler at noon when we eat The fruit is in cans so a quick dip in the lake washes anything on the outside.
3373370,Guest,2014-12-17 08:59:00,0,"We have had a shore lunch brunch. We cook up smoked bacon in a pan and use a little part of the grease in another pan and scramble eggs. We use the remaining grease to fry the fish in. Thus Bacon, eggs, and fish for brunch."

3368418,LOW1,2014-12-15 13:30:00,2828,Blueberry perogies using fresh picked blueberries. A great dessert. Serve in addition to fried potatoes and beans.
3368634,SinOrSwim,2014-12-15 15:05:00,1528,We took up a couple tubs of potato salad. I thought it went really well with the fish tacos. We do small bags of chips on the days we do regular sandwiches.
3368682,adempsey,2014-12-15 15:16:00,963,"Biscuits, beans, rice, roast vegetable of your choice (corn, squash, yam, asparagus, brussel sprout), couscousMake some walleye fajitas. Bring some tortillas and grill up some walleye, onions and peppers, add some lime juice and appropriate spices."
3368786,rockrunner,2014-12-15 16:00:00,205,"Pan or deep fried Walleye, Can Beans, Fried Potatoes. We don't have enough shore lunches to change a good thing. I guess coleslaw has been brought occasionally. Fish tacos are excellent and we have had them back at camp but not as a shore lunch yet."
3369082,michigan walleye guy,2014-12-15 17:55:00,95,"I am almost reverent in sticking to the traditional shore lunch menu of fried walleye fillets, beans, and fried potatoes/onions. I like to use the butter flavored Crisco and pan fry the fish using a breading of flour, corn flake crumbs, corn meal and seasonings. But I do admit to spending hours over the winter watching the various shore lunch videos on YouTube, and I know that some of those lunches have some very different side dishes. So you might want to look at some of those--some of my favorites are the South Shore Lodge shorelunch video, and the 'Rugged Dude' shorelunch demos. Watching some of these Canadian fishing fly-in videos just makes my bucket list get longer and longer. Merry Christmas!"
3369210,JOE WALLEYE,2014-12-15 18:42:00,753,"We did cole slaw last summer and it was a hit. We buy the cabbage already shredded, and the dressing in a jar. Before leaving camp in the morning we combine the cabbage and dressing in a zip lock and throw it in the cooler. Can't get any easier!"
3369482,btyreprich,2014-12-15 19:31:00,1067,"We too seem to keep with tradition: canned corn, potatoes, and onions and Walleye or Perch of course. To leave a sweet taste in the mouth at the end of the meal, I'll bring a can of chunk pineapple or applesauce. Keep these last two items in the cooler filled with ice for fish."
