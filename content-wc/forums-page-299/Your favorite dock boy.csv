3252553,packpro,2014-10-18 21:34:00,695,"17 Years with Jeff at Big Canon. Boats are are ready for the next day 10 minutes after he helps clear your gear. Helps you load in the morning. Your bait request will be in the boat before you get there. Need a few new spots, he is also a guide and usually good for tip or two as long as you don't crowd him. Cooks a mean shore lunch, works on the motors and filets fish perfectly at hyper speed. After dinner he'll join you on the porch for a beer or two. That is when the fun starts. It's like a different standup routine every night usually lasts 45-60 min. Really helps make the trip enjoyable.."

3265298,Behle,2014-10-26 08:28:00,51,Adam at Expeditions North. Has a great camp fish fry mid week and has plenty of hilarious stories.
3265762,BornToFish,2014-10-26 16:28:00,1224,"I agree that Kenny and Earl at Manotak Lodge are outstanding dock hands. They are all about customer service! I understand that they even keep their own notes from year-to-year as to what individual guests like and dislike. They are the backbone of customer service at Manotak Lodge, as virtually every guest sees them several times during each day of their vacation."
3277282,teddi,2014-11-01 08:17:00,349,"Just heard that Evergreen,s dock boy for 2015 is a really good guy. He will be out to please the guests."
3280770,Hump,2014-11-03 07:47:00,578,"than Brent, the kid that was there this summer?"
3285818,ohiojmj,2014-11-04 18:34:00,1262,"My dockboy's name is Davvve. He lives near lake erie and always enjoys a walleye troll or a perch outing. Early in the season, he directs me to back up into the lake and off the ramp at a 45 degree angle. As the season progresses, things get better as he sharpens my chronicly bad trailer backing skills by grunting out orders like ""my side"", ""your side"" until somehow my 17' boat slides into the drink. We could easily provide many episodes of Ridiculousness to TV watchers by leaving the winch strap hooked, forgetting the drain plug, starting outboard tilted up, dropping rods into the lake, etc. but somehow, in our feeble way, we launch the boat, catch fish, laugh a lot, and fill the freezer!"
3344873,Jwendt15,2014-12-04 08:15:00,72,We stayed at Evergreen earlier this year. We thought Brent was great. Showed us some spots there were great all week. Also brought us some of his own beer for our fish fry when everything was closed. No complaints from us.
3241977,teddi,2014-10-14 14:41:00,349,Who is your favorite dock boy? How about the goof off at Evergreen Lodge?
3242257,JAY221,2014-10-14 16:29:00,877,"If I can go with dock guy it would be Lester @ Kingfisher. Hard to beat. Later, Jay"
3242409,JayM5209,2014-10-14 17:17:00,1050,"Bryce at VBL. That guy'll work his tail off for customers. Of course, V-Bay Gord trained him, so it figures."
3242473,fishron,2014-10-14 17:43:00,317,"I don't remember his name, but is was a trip to Bob's lake in southern Ontario many years ago. We had quite a large group staying at Nordlaw Lodge. We were there before the opening of bass and walleye were nowhere to be seen. We wanted to do a shore lunch. My daughter and I came across a shoreline that was loaded with big rockbass and we filled a cooler with them. The dockboy expertly fileted every fish without a bone and we enjoyed a memorable shore lunch. The guy was responsible for helping us have an experience that we talk about to this day."

3243081,Knoxabilly,2014-10-14 21:12:00,225,Teddi- you're talking about the new guy this year right? He's no Moose yet but we did have blast with him!
3243273,teddi,2014-10-15 03:33:00,349,He only likes your money not you. Kind of lazy.
3244065,trapper_john,2014-10-15 09:35:00,83,Same here Jay. Lester at Kingfisher is as good as it gets.
3244745,Danbear,2014-10-15 14:04:00,72,"Our best one at Birch Dale on Eagle lake is the owner himself Marcel.We go later in the season so the kids are heading back to school and Marcel takes over. This year Marcel pumped my gas, picked me out the biggest minnows and fixed my bow mount trolling motor and at the end of the day he makes an excellent Rye and Seven at the Bull Pit lounge. He also fries some of the best fish I have ever eaten at the camp fish fry."
3244873,port1042,2014-10-15 14:55:00,509,"I don't have anyone to compare to, but Kenny and Earl at Manotak (Perrault Falls) are terrific. From insuring the boat is ready to go, helping to load and unload gear, to expert filleting service (including outstanding northern fillets), to time to chat and laugh they help make our Ontario visits very special."
