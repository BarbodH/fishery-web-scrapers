His name was Smokey Smith and during his military career he was promoted to corporal nine times only to be demoted back to private! He was noted as a man who loved life, cigars, scotch and women! (not in that order) Here is the info on his award http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-...ith-ea-eng.asp Enjoy, mike"

It was great to read about it hear as well...amazing to me that they stay that active at those ages and in those conditions...IMPRESSIVE!
