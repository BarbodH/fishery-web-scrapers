3396578,Glenman12,2014-12-26 20:49:00,762,just curious as to why...our lodge owner used to do several but I think he is only doing 1 or 2..I know he isnt doing All Canada in St Charles cause we used to do it for him..
3397098,v-bay gord,2014-12-27 07:14:00,3168,"Just a preference on my part. Used to do many but the last 5 or 6 years cut back to zero. Reasons for my approach is the time away from home and money spent doesn't match the return to justify doing them. I just spend more $ and time marketing other ways that let me enjoy the lake rather than having a ""death grip"" on the steering wheel driving through an ice storm on the way to Chicago. That said, I always liked the NW Show in Minneapolis and will perhaps try and be there next year. So I guess what I'm saying is if I don't enjoy it, I don't do it."
3397434,Fisherman Ted,2014-12-27 09:28:00,461,"Agree with you V-bay. I have never done a show in the 5 years I have owned the lodge. Not one. Times have changed and that money can best be spent elsewhere with far more widespread results. For example, the costs of a couple of shows could pay for a well known fisherman to come in and tape a show which would be broadcast to millions of fishermen all over the world and be seen year after year in re-runs not to mention you can post it on the internet."
3397674,v-bay gord,2014-12-27 11:19:00,3168,Very true. It's also more cost effective to look after the customers you already have. They are the best advocates for your business.
3398074,Freytown,2014-12-27 14:35:00,770,I usually make it to the granddaddy of sport shows (if the weather is ok). http://www.greatamericanoutdoorshow.org/
3398090,polaris-pete,2014-12-27 14:48:00,343,"Seeing I usually hit the different Sport Shows looking for different places to go in the Spring, seeing I booked last Year with Hearst Air probably won't be attending one this year. BUT you never know when things get boring I may just have to go to one."
3422034,jambi,2015-01-05 15:37:00,504,Looking forward to my trip this weekend from Oklahoma to Chicagoland to visit about Canadian fishing with my friends. We'll also be at the All Canada Show on Saturday hanging with the Showalters gang and making new friends too.
