I didn't notice any other camps on that end of the lake, but we didn't go too far because we were in 14 ft boats with 15 hp motors. The only other option I have found is Kettle Falls Hotel. Are there other camps on that end of the lake that I have missed.Thanks for the help. Josh"

Compared to the central area and north arm of Rainy, the east end is much more open and susectable to winds. There were days when I did not feel comfortable in my 16.5 w/ 75 boat. I've found the north arm or Rainy to fish smaller. NimstugMake no little plans; they have no magic to stir mens blood. -D. Burnham"
