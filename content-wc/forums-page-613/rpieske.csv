574086,rpieske,2008-05-20 14:06:00,1276,"It still pretty cold here. I first put the boat in yesterday afternoon and went out today for a couple of hours but caught nothing. I was just tossing a wire framed single spin with a jig. The water temperature was about 47 degrees. If we get some warming it should pick up. I don't fish a whole lot this early. I'll do some smallmouth fishing and northerns, but I've never really liked walleye fishing. Only do it when I want some to eat. I'll let you know more towards the end of the week."
574095,esgrams,2008-05-20 17:03:00,92,Where do you go for your smallmouth--I always seem to pick them up down in Gohre Bay even tho I don't fish for them per say--Generally dragging cranks for walleyes-- Do you think the spawn is behind by much? Eric
574136,rpieske,2008-05-21 12:36:00,1276,"There are a lot of good spots down in Gohere Bay. I like that area, too. A little warming would help. It was in the 30's last night and still cool today. Which spawn are you talking about? Bass might wind up being a little slow. Northern are done, I would think. Muskie might be during opener. Most walleyes are deep right now because of the water temps. It's a little confusing to the fish and the fishermen. Small walleyes are being caught in the 24 foot range in areas with current. That could change rapidly with a warming trend. In the two hours I was out yesterday I didn't see one boat on the lake. Weird."
574161,esgrams,2008-05-22 06:20:00,92,"Walleye spawn is what I was interested in, but if the northerns are done, it sounds like they'll have the feed bag on..As far as no other boats, after reading the other threads on here, it looks like there isn't going to be a shortage of people the first week of June. We are coming up with 19 people and there is another crew out of our home town with 9 individuals going. So between the two groups we should be able to find the pattern the walleyes are in. (Hopefully) Eric"
