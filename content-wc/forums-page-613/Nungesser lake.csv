571352,Guest,2008-02-12 21:35:00,0,"I had a trip planned to Birch Point Camp for the week of May 31. I was recently impacted by a RIF at work and had to back out of the trip. Unfortunately, it snowballed to the rest of my group backing out as well! I feel bad about cancelling out so late, so I thought I would help out the lodge owner in filling the week. I have NO AFFILIATION with the lodge what so ever. I had a large cabin reserved that would hold around 10-12 people. It is a very well run camp with dependable equipment and excellent service. I have been going for around 15 years and have had a fantastic trip every year. The walleye and northern fishing is outstanding and is an easy lake to fish. I know the lake pretty well and would be more then willing to give some tips."

In June I found out I couldn't make our trip in August. I called George and told him to refund my $100.00 deposit or just apply it to our camp bill. He informed me that he would do neither. He said I could come back the next year and use my deposit then. Our group still went that August minus myself. I never saw my $100.00 again nor did our group go back to the camp. So the $100.00 ""screwing"" I got turned into a much bigger income loss in repeat business for Birch Point Camp."
571362,Guest,2008-02-13 09:34:00,0,"I've had that situation just about every year, and they were always willing to apply it to the overall bill. Maybe your group lowered their bill and didn't tell you? There is a reason for deposites and is a standard practice for all lodges and hotels. They are running a business. The lodge has always been fair to me and provided me an excellent fishing trip every year. I have no complaints and would highly recommend the trip to anyone."

We fished out of Birch for several years when George and Connie were younger (so was I) and their son was just getting started. George built that camp very nearly by himself and always ran a tight ship.....we liked it. Your right Deposits are a necessary part of doing business and, in this case, won't begin to make up for the lost week. Good of you to try and help!"
571394,Goldeneagle,2008-02-13 19:33:00,78,Deposits should be $200 per person.
571429,Guest,2008-02-15 12:49:00,0,"Roadhog, Here's the way I look at it. If your reservation was for 11, I'm sure you didn't get a discount for the 12th. You probably fished two per boat and one boat with three. He may have had an extra motor that may not have been used. They probably gave your group no credit for three in the boat. Perhaps your (paid for) sixth boat/motor w/gas was not used but neither was the gas and wear/ tear. This sounds like a no brainer to me. You were a new group of 12 to camp for the first time. You were not talking of canceling half of the 12 or the complete trip of 12 but just one of twelve. Sounds like the owner exercised very poor judgment. So for a $100.00 deposit decision he may have lost a double digit size group of fishermen because of it for who knows how many years. Potential loss of profits of 1 are one thing but it looks like potential rewards were not even considered. I make business decisions daily that may break or make me. This would not be a break me decision. Sounds like this owner could benefit from a lesson in risk management in this instance."
571605,Guest,2008-02-23 09:59:00,0,HAS ANYONE HERD FROM CHAD&TONYA AT NUNGESSER LAKE LODGE? I HAVE CALLED THEM A COUPLE OF TIMES.THAY HAVE NOT CALLED BACK.HOPE EVERYTHING IS OK. J.P.
571634,Guest,2008-02-25 09:28:00,0,"Now that you mention it, my brother tried to contact them a few weeks ago and had not heard back. I have always had great experiences dealing with Chad and Tanya. Any other comments would only be speculation."
574278,Guest,2008-05-25 06:21:00,0,Chad was a tool before he sold the camp - seldom around and when he was he complained all the time.
