573940,AllenW,2008-05-15 08:59:00,11482,"Having just changed over to the new boat, somewhere along the line I've lost my Red Lake depth maps. I did find they are from Sunset Fishing Adventures, PO box 435, Red Lake Ontario. These were about 18"" by 24"" and had half the lake on each side. Maps were red, white and blue in color, showed several lakes other than Red, including Keg and part of Gullrock, parts of Flat and Russett also I've not been able to find these locally and would like to get a couple before my next trip. The guy I usually go with remembers all the spots and I'd like to get them marked before I go on my next trip as he won't be able to go for awhile. I've not been able to find these on line either, was hoping maybe someone here might know where I could get a few of them??? Tia Al"

573943,Pooch,2008-05-15 10:23:00,4619,Just thought of another one: Contact Gary Worrell at Red Lake Digital 807.727.2888 Pooch
573945,AllenW,2008-05-15 10:55:00,11482,"Thanks Pooch. Do you know if Northern is the one sportings good store on one of the main drags (618 I think), its on the corner, and you walk up several steps to get inside? I'm thinking that's where we usually go for stuff like maps and such, I found a email addy for them and will send one to them. Once again, thanks Al"
573952,Guest,2008-05-15 13:22:00,0,The Four Season Sport shop in Ear Falls also carries maps of the Red Lake area. I stopped by last year and picked up a new map of Gull Rock and Keg Lake. The Red Lake map was right next to it.
573953,AllenW,2008-05-15 13:50:00,11482,"Thanks, I'll see what Northern says and if they won't ship a couple maps, I'll try your suggestion. Al"
573961,Guest,2008-05-15 19:33:00,0,Did these maps that you picked up of Gullrock show better bottom contour than the ones that the resorts have. Kevin.

Not sure what the resorts have for Gullrock, we have a couple of spots we hit and that's about it, also the map I had only showed part of Gullrock. If I see a good map for Gull, I'll let ya know. Al"
573970,Guest,2008-05-16 08:44:00,0,Red Lake Marine also carry Red Lake maps. ph# 807-727-2747 I'm sure they would send a couple down. Allen W could you tell me a little more about your crank bait pattern for fall Walleyes in the Chikuni river.
573984,AllenW,2008-05-16 14:08:00,11482,"George at Northern Sports Supply says he'd be happy to send me a few maps, I can use my visa card and don't even have to deal with exchange. Thanks all. Bud, I'll give it a try, we've had the best luck using floating or shallow running basic raps, like these,http://www.rapala.com/products/lures...eshorsalt=Both Or we've had some luck with the shallow running shad rap like thesehttp://www.rapala.com/products/lures...shorsalt=Fresh Basic minnow design, for the most part. Colors that have worked the best are natural colors, gold and black is my favorite, white and black would be next, green seems to work too. We usually use the 4"" rap but I'd vary it a bit and see what works for you. No real secret to the retrieve, cast upstream and reel fast enough to give the rap some action, kind of depends on how fast the river is. We use med action fast tip spinning rods with 8# test, being the old timer I still use stren blue, but have tried some of the newer lines like power pro with fair success. Here's where my short term memory loss is going to cause trouble, IF I remember right, you head out of the town of Red Lake to the Nugassor road, then down that for a few miles then take a left and you should end up going over a bridge that spans the Chukuni. Maybe someone can correct these directions if I'm wrong?? Anyway, this is where we've had the best luck on the river. As you come up on the river it should be going from right to left in stream direction, going to the left side of the bridge you can walk down and fish from shore, short walk, maybe 50 yards or so max. From there you can cast the raps up into the rapids that start at the bridge, try and keep the lure from going deep, waters pretty shallow and you'll snag enough as it is. I get the feeling the walleyes are facing upstream and nailing the bait fish as they come down the rapids. Fan cast the rapids and you should hit them at different spots. Other wise, go to the right of the bridge on the side before crossing the bridge and walk down the trail about maybe a mile or so, you'll come across several places to fish from shore at, pretty popular spot so it'd be hard to miss any of the spots. There we still casted upstream, not sure why but it just seemed to work better, but try different approaches and see what happens. Same baits here too. The bridge site is a great place to go if the weather is to poor to get a boat out. It seems you can hit this spot to late in the year and fishing will be spotty, 3 weekend in Sept is when we usually go, we went the 4th week once and found few walleyes in this part of the river, guy at the bait store mentioned they become scare very late in the season. We've had reasonable luck taking the boat up to where the Chukuni enters in red, then upstream to the rapids, casting raps in those has worked, although jigs and minnows seem to be a better deal, also we've hit big northerns there too. We've had some luck going down stream from the Chukuni campgrounds, maybe about three miles, you'll come to where the river narrows down and there's a island, fish the west side of the island, casting or jigs and minnows work there. Nothing of any real size there usually, but a good place to get shore lunch from. That doesn't work, try off of Forestry Point and throw or troll some bigger stuff, like a husky jerk, bit tricky to troll but set out marker buoys and try zig zagging a bit, you'll either hit walleyes or a northern or two. And jigs and minnows will work there too...:)http://www.rapala.com/products/lures...shorsalt=Fresh Not sure if any of this made any sense, but hope it helps a bit, its worked for us, hopefully you too.
