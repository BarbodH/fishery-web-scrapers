574192,Guest,2008-05-22 15:36:00,0,"Hello: Always tip dock help and bait boys. Start tipping dock and baitboys right away. You will get great service and free bait, maybe youll pay for 3 dozen minnows and get 8 dozen. The tipping will payoff while you are there instead of tipping at the end of your stay. Good Luck. W.W."

574240,Guest,2008-05-23 07:49:00,0,That doesn't seem right. You are paying the dock boy to steal from the lodge owner.

574243,Guest,2008-05-23 08:40:00,0,"The resort that we go to is not an American plan resort. The dock help are also the cabin cleaners, along w/ the owners of the camp That pretty much covers the staff. We feel like they do an excellent job! So no food, no guide We tip $20.00 per guy at the end of our 4 day's"
574128,Guest,2008-05-21 11:18:00,0,"I just wanted to get some idea if what you tip the cooks on American Plan, and the dock hands, and the pilots, etc... Obviously, quality of service plays a role in this but just want a rough idea of what is considered adequate."
574137,Crappie Kid,2008-05-21 12:46:00,1581,I gave the guide for our all day fly-out trip $100. It was an incredible enjoyable time. The 30+ muskies my son and I CPR'd was a bonus. There were 2 awesome teen boys working the docks and they each got about $20 per day and an additional $100 at the end of the week. These tips were in my original budget to Canada.
574139,jigman 2003,2008-05-21 13:56:00,981,"Man, those guys will remember you every time you show back up with that kind of tipping. You make me look bad."
574149,Obabikon,2008-05-21 16:06:00,2370,That's very good tipping... you're probably in the top 1% of tippers! Rarely have I heard of such gratuity. I'm sure they treat you well!
574166,Glenman12,2008-05-22 07:41:00,762,Our group of 12 each ante up $20 for the cook and give the same to the two dock kids to split.
574167,Guest,2008-05-22 07:59:00,0,"That's about what we do. $50 from each of us to the kitchen $20 to the maids and for the dock boys we give them $20, left over beer, snacks and usually whatever was the hot lures for that week."
574168,Guest,2008-05-22 08:08:00,0,At my camp we give $10 per day per guest to the staff. These are college students and I know they appreciate it.
574176,Guest,2008-05-22 11:16:00,0,"What has worked well for us in the past has been tipping the dock boys a bit up front, you can get their attention that way, and during the week, if they go above and beyond they get another nugget, and of course they get to split a nice chunk at the end of the week. If you get to know them well, it's also nice to let them borrow dvd's and cd's during the week. They appreciate that alot. They also usually get a few sets of raingear that are to be retired after the trip, and ofcourse all the left overs."
574179,Guest,2008-05-22 12:00:00,0,I guess we are a bunch of cheap skates we throw in $5.00 each for the week 6 guys so thats $30.00 for the week and also give whatever food is left. When the dollar was stronger I guess it seemed like more then it is now.
