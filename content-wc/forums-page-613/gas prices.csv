What I'm getting at is it would be more cost effective to leave the gas sucker (boat & tow vehicle) at home and drive up for some Canadian fishing in a fuel efficient vehicle.....maybe car pooling with the group instead of everyone bringing their own half ton. The advantage with a small boat is you spend more time fishing and less time travelling (out of necessity). It may be hard to wean yourself off the big fishing platform, but it is an alternative to just giving up the ""up north"" experience."
574185,Guest,2008-05-22 14:16:00,0,Just thought i would ask this since gas prices seem to have no end in site. here in las vegas nevada today may 22 at 1pm regular is 3.69 . we are planning on driving to chicago in a 40 mpg car. probably 4 bucks by then. for those folks that used to say 4 or 5 bucks is the limit it looks like this year will be your test. thank you deomocrats for not allowing new oil wells or nuclear plants to be built probably a little credit goes to georgeW too.

574216,Guest,2008-05-22 18:47:00,0,Ear Falls 140/liter which translates to approx. $5.60/u.s. gallon. That will make them walleye taste better.
574218,mrwalleye5,2008-05-22 20:10:00,1922,I keep remembering the futuristic movies where there are large older cars sitting around in back alleys and streets all in disrepair with no or just too expensive of gas to run. I have already parked my Envoy and am driving a more fuel efficient car which can't pull my boat. In these movies has anyone seen Prov's with big outboards abandoned on the streets of cities also? Just a thought.......is the future here? W5
574225,manitobawalleye,2008-05-23 04:28:00,885,"ear falls at 140 equals 140 x 3.48litres per us gallon is $4.90US or so... manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."
574227,Guest,2008-05-23 04:43:00,0,Can anyone else foresee the day when gas is sold by the quart in the US?
574231,jigman 2003,2008-05-23 06:08:00,981,I see $7 gas by the Labor Day weekend. Hope I'm wrong
