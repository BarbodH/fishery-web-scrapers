574089,v-bay gord,2008-05-20 15:27:00,3168,Chartreuse or orange seem to be good.......size wise I would use the lightest jig possible for the situation.
574145,fishman10,2008-05-21 14:27:00,226,the thunder bay area was pretty good. good catches in rivers. some lakes still frozen.

574017,Guest,2008-05-18 13:33:00,0,Wanting to know how the fishing is with the late ice out and cold water temps. Headed to Sioux Lookout area. Have to wait for one person ......just wondering what I'm missing. Thanks
574020,Obabikon,2008-05-18 17:57:00,2370,"Fishing has been slow the last two days. The walleyes are deeper than they usually are this time of year. Add that to the wind we had... fishing has been tough. But, no one is getting skunked either... it's just difficult fishing."
574024,Glenman12,2008-05-18 20:28:00,762,"Dont know if this will help but I got an email from our resort owner..we are at Cedar Lake in Perrault Falls which is SW of Sioux Lookout...he said that a lot of males in the 17""-21"" range were caught on the first two days..most still had sperm in them..he said it looks like they are headed to spawning areas..looks like things are about 2 weeks behind compared to normal..water temp was 43 degrees"
574035,v-bay gord,2008-05-19 12:28:00,3168,"For the Eagle Lake (Vermilion Bay section) we had a 27"" walleye caught yesterday along with a couple lake trout in the 33"" range. Any walleyes caught were from 8-20 feet....the trout were in about 18 feet. Water temps 42-44 degrees. Don't count on the walleyes to be up shallow yet but some warm weather will push them in that direction. The conditions seem right to get into some quality fish, but maybe not the quantity."
574038,Guest,2008-05-19 12:50:00,0,"Thats some good news. Were they caught jigging, or lindy rigging, or some other tactic? Where will the smallies be now with the late ice and what baits would your recommend. Thanks"
574054,Guest,2008-05-19 19:57:00,0,The opening on Lake of the Woods on saturday was tough - hail - wind 40 mph. We caught enough for shorelunch and came in. Sunday was beautiful. We caught walleyes in 20 to 30 feet of water and released 3 that were 25 inches. Some of the fish still had spawn in them. For photos look here http://buenavista.livejournal.com/
574056,v-bay gord,2008-05-19 20:22:00,3168,Most of the walleye and trout have been caught trolling sinking rapalas and husky jerks. Some of the deeper walleye on jigs and minnows. For smallmouth I would be casting around any shallow rockpiles near areas where they will be spawning (warmest water...back bays)....
574067,Guest,2008-05-20 09:26:00,0,Bumping for today's news.
574071,Guest,2008-05-20 11:24:00,0,Thanks for the reply. Is jig color and weight making a big differnce at this time for both Walleye and sm-mouth? Thanks
574075,dewyg,2008-05-20 12:05:00,1006,I was out on Sunday and locked horns with a 32 1/4 female (spawned out) no pictures but the kids were excited to see it.
