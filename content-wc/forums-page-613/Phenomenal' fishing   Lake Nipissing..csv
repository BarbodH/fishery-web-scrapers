573905,A Canuck,2008-05-14 15:12:00,86,"Taken from the North Bay Nugget and it refers to Lake Nipissing.. 'Phenomenal' fishing; Anglers, bait dealers counting down to walleye season-comment on Posted By Brandi Cramer Updated 7 hours ago Tammie Pecore's shopping list Tuesday included worms. Pecore says she's ""hardcore"" when it comes to angling - her wedding ring has fish engraved on it - and was buying bait to entice splake. ""#### right I am looking forward to a weekend of fishing,"" she said. ""It's relaxing, it's freedom and peace of mind and you get outdoors."" The good news for Pecore is if the Ministry of Natural Resources is right, this fishing season could be one to remember. Walleye season is set to open Saturday at 12:01 a.m. and Mike Regis, district enforcement supervisor with the ministry, predicts it will be ""phenomenal."" ""There were a lot of 12- to 15-inchers last year,"" he said. ""They will have grown and will be great in the frying pan this year."" Richard Rowe's analysis of data for the past two years shows the same thing. A biologist with Nipissing First Nation's natural resources department, Rowe said there will be a lot of ""catchable fish."" ""Walleye fishing goes up and down based on strong year classes,"" he said. A strong year class occurs when conditions are perfect during the spawning season. ""It takes three years to grow a perfect frying pan-size fish,"" Rowe said. In 2005, conditions were perfect with high water levels, a warm and stable spring, and a long growing season. ""We had a good summer that year. That means there is lots for walleye to eat and once they get by the first winter, survival rates are very high,"" Rowe said. Bob Esch, owner of Trout Lake Bait and Canoe, expects Lake Nipissing will be ""super busy"" this weekend judging by how much his phone has been ringing. ""I am definitely not going fishing,"" he said, but he will ensure ""hundreds if not thousands"" have the right tools. His business is kept viable by catering to different species including splake and rainbow trout. But the start of walleye season Saturday will open the flood gates. ""We will start getting extra busy Thursday morning,"" Esch said, adding his store hours are long - ""sun up to sun down."" He is ready with a healthy supply of shiners, chubs, dace, worms and leeches, as well as tackle. And for those uncertain of what to put on their lines, Esch is more than willing to offer guidance. ""If it's a cold spring and the water stays cold, a minnow is the best way to go. If it warms up - worms and leeches,"" he said. Rowe also had tips for anglers planning to catch and release. ""Play the fish quickly, handle it quickly and in the water,"" he said. Regis reminds eager anglers to measure catches carefully to avoid violating any regulations. And if you planned on having a few cold ones - do it on shore. ""Booze and boating don't mix,"" Regis said. ""If you have (alcohol) in the boat we have the authority to charge you. ""The key message is be safe and have fun.""[email protected] know the rules Things you should know: - Lake Nipissing slot size for walleye is 40 to 60 centimetres, while on Trout Lake the slot size is 43 to 60 centimetres. - Lake Nipissing does not have a sturgeon season. - Lake trout and salmon is open on Trout Lake June 21 to 27 - Muskie season on Lake Nipissing opens June 21 to Dec. 15 Bass species is open throughout Fishing Management Zone 11 June 28 to Dec. 31 - Walleye is open on the Ottawa River May 16 to Dec. 31 - a week later than usual. - On the Ottawa River and Lake Timiskaming from May 16 to June 15, all walleye must be less than 40 centimetres.

573935,phishfearme,2008-05-15 07:56:00,1242,"AC - please report back to us on your nipissing experience - i've heard lots of negatives and not many positives. thanks, phish"
573936,A Canuck,2008-05-15 08:15:00,86,"Phish, I have fished it for years, it is a good (not great) Walleye fishery, I have boated 50+ fish in a day then the next day 1... But that is fishing right? I have found if you find the shelves anchor just before them, cast to the top of the shelf and work your bait along the bottom, allowing it to fall off the edge of the shelf.. Panhead Jig with a stinger tipped with a dew worm is a deadly combination :) I will be sure to post a report. AC"
573962,rockpt,2008-05-15 19:44:00,589,"Phish, Nip was a great walleye lake in the 80s and early 90s and then the netting got out of control. MNR has been working hard to bring it back with cooperation of the First Nations. The south shore around Sandy Island and mouth of the French River is one of the most beautiful areas I've ever fished. The main lake can get ugly fast when a west wind picks up."
574197,A Canuck,2008-05-22 16:11:00,86,"Well guys I am back!.. and to be honest it was miserable! Cold, Wet and Windy.. water temps were below 50f, and the North Wind made things fun LOL.. Fish were caught, not less then normal but nothing spectacular either.. It did not stop raining all weekend it seemed, and the constant wind compounded things.. Being on the South Shores, that North wind have alot of room to kick up water.. caught alot of slot sized pickies.. and more then a couple meals worth below the slot :).. that said we only kept enough for 1 meal.. 5 fish 5 guys. while it was the weather that made things miserable, I would have not traded it for the world!.. Being back in the boat, on softwater felt fantastic! Right now everything seems to be a couple weeks behind due to the harsh winter we experianced.. I would have fished the river mouth but it is shallow and sandy.. even though the water was up given the waves I did not feel like having sand sucked into the impeller for the sake of a few fish.. I will be back up in a few weeks with more time on my hands 9days, during what should be the prime time given the winter weather cycle. I will be sure to report back on my findings.. All in all the fishing was good... and would have been better had the weather of cooperated and if the water was a bit warmer. AC."
