I am looking for any help people are willing to give as far as depth, presentations, 'general' areas etc. We are leaving on June 21st. We are staying at Island View lodge on the West End. Thanks to all who respond. ForkNutz"

574098,Guest,2008-05-20 18:44:00,0,"We fished West end of lake once several years ago (out of LaBells Birch Point). We didn't do very good than, but that was probably just an anommoly. We have fished the East Arm (Red Gut area) for many years and the presentations you are looking for are probably similar. For Pike and Eyes, you can't beat spoons, Husky Jerks, and Mepps spinners. For Small Mouth try Top-Rs during low light conditions and tube jigs. Also, both Pike and Small Mouth love Buzz Baits, also during low light. Actually any artificial bait will catch all. PS. I can tell there are not many people who will discuss Rainy Lake (don't know why). Pathfinder"
