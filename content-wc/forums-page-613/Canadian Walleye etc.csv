574298,Guest,2008-05-25 17:30:00,0,"Hi guys. This is one of the few sites I found with a message board. I'm from California, and an avid flyfisherman. I've fished all over the western US & Canada, but mostly flyfishing and catching trout. I have recently planned my 1st trip to Quetico area and realize I'll be fishing for walleye, and pike as well. Can you guys tell me what's the absolute basic needed tackle to have success with these bigger fish. For example do I need a steel leader? What size test line? What types of lures or bait? And if you are a flyfisherman, what size/type of fly works well? Thanks a ton to anyone willing to help out an eastern Canada novice...."
574302,Matches,2008-05-25 19:53:00,236,"If you are going to Quetico, are you mainly going to be fishing from a canoe? Tell us a little more of what your fishing conditions will be like."
574303,pike50plus,2008-05-25 20:04:00,584,"Walleye, use light action rod with jigs and power bait, Pike use a steel leader on the flyrod, streamers, bunny's, bass fly rod poppers. Thats a start. I'll send you more in a pm."
574304,back357,2008-05-25 21:30:00,106,"Pike - I use an 8wt rod and have both floating and sinking line. I don't use steel leaders, but just tie on some 20lb mono for a leader. Bunny leeches work great. Pike are not fussy. They will go after just about anything. I have tied tons of my own flies and they will hit darn near the ugliest thing you can think of. Bring some that sink as well as float. Walleye - Contrary to popular opinion, I have caught Walleye on a fly. It is much more complicated only because you have to get the fly down unless you're fishing somewhere where they are shallow. I use a 6wt rod with sinking line. I use a version of a muddler minnow but almost always put a small split shot on just to make sure it sinks. If you have a chance, I'd grab a 6'6"" 2 piece light rod and pair it with a spinning reel spooled with 6lb. Get some jigs and gulp minnows and minnow grubs. That way, you've got it covered. Tight lines."
574306,Stu,2008-05-25 23:57:00,472,"One more tip Erik, buy titanium leaders instead of steel. Steel leaders will kink up on almost every fish and become useless. Titanium leaders will stay flexible fish after fish. They cost a little more (about $8 for a 6"" leader), but they are worth it. Good luck - Stu"
574312,fishman10,2008-05-26 08:49:00,226,"i happen to live close to quetico. i believe that in the park boundaries there is a live bait restriction, but worms are ok. as the one reply says, spinner rigs as well as jigs are the mainstay in canadian walleye waters. lots of bass in area, poppers raps and tube jigs work well for them. pike love spoons,raps,bucktails or kittens wrapped in trebles and towed behind boat on a chunk of styrofoam-ha-ha just kidding. good luck, keep the beer cold and your hooks sharp."
574315,Guest,2008-05-26 10:51:00,0,"Hot-digity. Thanks a lot guys. Everyone's been a great help. I will be leaving Quetico by canoe for 7-8 days with my brother. So far I'm sure that I'll bring some spinner jigs, look into worms (whether there's a bait restriction or not), some other spinner lures like gulps and minnows. For the fly I have some steel leaders, and 20 lb mono tippet, on an 8 wt. rod. Does anyone have suggestions for fly selections for both walleye and pike? Also what is the right time of day to go after these fish? Do they prefer fast water, or riffled water like trout? Or slower/murkier water like bass?"
574338,Guest,2008-05-27 12:55:00,0,http://www.members.tripod.com/Invictaflies/id169.htm This should give you an idea of some flies.
574348,Guest,2008-05-27 19:28:00,0,"Sorry, I can't speak to the flys, but here are MY staples (Your mileage may vary): 8 lb. monofilament (won't scare many fish away, and still big enough to haul in the large pike that will hit), snap swivel to make sure the line doesn't twist too bad, and sinkers to get to the bottom. leaders only if your losing a larger number of lures to Northerns (3 or more in a couple hours). (Thanx for the titanium leader tip, Stu!) Best fishing is usually during a slight breeze, right on the water (i.e. ""Walleye chop""). Time of day not as important as temp., water temp., breeze, barometric pressure. I've caught walleye all day long (and gone on a few stretches where they didn't seem to hit at all! LOL!) Also, I haven't noticed a water speed (or lure speed, for that matter) that they CONSISTENTLY like. Seems to depend on other factors, already mentioned. They do like it dark, though (whether due to water color, or cloudy skies, I am not sure). One other thought...walleye like to hit SHORT! (If you feel a slight tug, like an almost snag, or a pesky-little-worm-stealing perch, let the lure drift back toward the fish about 8-10 inches, then set the hook.) ;) Good luck, you'll have a BLAST!! (Sorry I couldn't be more help.)"
