574103,Grappler,2008-05-21 06:50:00,47,"That lake was way up at the North end. Don't know that it had a name other than ""the crappie lake"" if you go all the way up till you reach the portage for little Dogtooth, as you are heading into that last bay, look to your left. You will see some big rocks sticking out of the water with a ""stream"" flowing out. You have to be careful, but you can get your boat back in there (if the water is not too low). Kinda neat lake, with a red-stained water. Minnows are what we were told for crappies in there, but we never had good luck. I imagine if you could find them, you could do well. Good Luck."
566313,bigbuck,2007-06-15 10:34:00,69,"I was talking to the father in law last week and he was telling me that they had a whole whack of rain on LOTW and the lake was up quite a bit, Dogtooth is near there so I figure the water level should be up a few inches."
566319,Guest,2007-06-15 13:32:00,0,"I also read on another thread that there was 6 inches+ of rain in the area in May. I'm going up week of June 30th and hope water is a little higher, especially on creek connecting to Kilvert. I'd appreciate any info before then. Good Fishin'"
574036,Guest,2008-05-19 12:36:00,0,"Hello Dogtooth fans out there. Any reports coming in this year yet? I suppose the ice just went out; water should be up this year? i'm going week of June 14th. I'd appreciate any reports/chats/ exchange of info, etc. Good fishin' CharlieO."
574046,ScottL,2008-05-19 14:30:00,733,"Hi there, I'm going to be there June 19th thru the 22nd, staying at the remote outpost camp, so let's stay in touch as it get's closer to that time. I'm thinking with the late spring that the water temps will be 2-3 weeks behind normal. Regards, Scott Lee Since there is six times as much water as dry land on earth, any foolcan plainly see the good Lord meant for man to fish six times as much as he works."
574062,Guest,2008-05-20 07:13:00,0,"1) Listen very closely to Wayne regarding the hazzard spots. 2) Take an extra prop. :) The lake can be tough to fish, but can produce results. I prefer Kilvert for walleye. Good luck."
574068,Guest,2008-05-20 10:39:00,0,"Hi Scott, Thanks for your reply, I'll be up ther June 14th-21st. I'm thinking the Walleyes may still be in close? Ever fish crappie there? With the temps being a few weeks behind I wonder if they will be shallow. I have no clue where to find them. By the way, I visit CNH in Benson once in a while. Best regards, Charlie O."
574069,Guest,2008-05-20 10:42:00,0,"Thanks for the heads-up. I know most of the hazard spots, always have extra prop and anchor (I've left about 3 anchors there) You headin' up this year?"
574082,ScottL,2008-05-20 13:15:00,733,"Small world Charlie, one of the guys going with, works at the CNH plant here. It's only my 2nd time going to Dogtooth, last time we went in August. I would think that the fish should be shallow, possibly on top of the reefs or in shallower bays. The Crappies haven't completely spawned out here yet, so I would think that it's possible that they will be spawning or just finished by then. Regards, Scott Lee Since there is six times as much water as dry land on earth, any foolcan plainly see the good Lord meant for man to fish six times as much as he works."
574083,Grappler,2008-05-20 13:49:00,47,"Going June 6-14. Reports I had heard have been ice out was late. We are going a week later than usual. Late ice should put us right on track for a good bite. There was a lake that Wayne referred to as a Crappie Lake, but we have not had much luck there. Caught nice Crappies accidentally in other places while walleye fishing."
574091,Guest,2008-05-20 16:04:00,0,"Grappler, What was the lake Wayne reffered to for crappie? I've walked into 2 of the smaller lakes but fished bass. Did he mention bait to use? Thanks"

565217,Guest,2007-05-13 08:39:00,0,"I talked to Patty at Dogtooth last week (first week of May). Surprisingly, the ice had just gone out the week before. They had a lot of ice. The lake is still low though, as they did not get near enough snow to offset the drought. I'm heading up there on Tuesday for 10 days of fishin'! Been going there every year since '91."
565219,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-05-13 11:27:00,80,"Dirk, Thanks for the update. We're headed up June 8th. Got any helpful hints/spots or suggeston? This is only my second time up, and the guy I'm fishing with hasn't been before. Post or e-mail me. My email is [email protected]. Also post or e-mail when you get back so you can brag about how well you did. :cheers: Thanks and have a great trip. Joe"
565688,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-05-29 20:10:00,80,"Anyone at Dogtooth yet? Dirk, How was your trip? Joe"
566076,Guest,2007-06-07 13:30:00,0,"Hi guys, I too have been going to Dogtooth for last 8 years. Last year was a poor year fishing; low water and changing weather. We've had pretty good luck with leeches and slip bobbers. '05 was great year. Lots of big ones 24""- 29"". Going again this year week of June 30th.so I'll be interested to hear how you did and water conditions. My e-mail is [email protected] if you'd care to swap spots, info etc. Good luck, CharlieO."

566288,Cerw1n,2007-06-14 10:36:00,1,We have been going to Dogtooth for about 4 years now. 2004 and 2k5 were incredible years with as many as 30 walleye 28 - 31. 2006 was a lot more difficult with the low water and water tempature. I have a feeling if the water is low this year which it probaly will be it could be similar to 2006. Does anyone know if the lake is still low? I would be interested in discussing spots or bait recomndations if anyone is interested. email is [email protected] I will be posting an update on our trip once we return.

558153,Guest,2006-06-07 12:46:00,0,"I have been to dogtooth on 3 trips. Great big fish lake, but somewhat tough to learn. We found our best luck to be with a very simple setup. Good quality red hook, and splitshot sinkers. I felt like kind of an idiot with $500 dollars worth of fancy gear in the box, but it is definately what produced best. Last year, mid June, we found our best fishing on Dogtooth, from the resort, headed to 4 corners, and went right. After hitting the opening, along the left side. I realize that North or South would be better descriptions, but I am simply going off memory. Fishing close to the outcropped rocks produced the best for us. Other spots that produced were small bays that were also rock filled. Most of the nicer fish we caught were 12 feet or shallower. 4 of us caught 6 fish 27"" or better last year, with 2 30"". For some fun in the afternoon, ask Wayne which bay has the crappies, can't remember the name off hand. We found some nice batches of slabs right in the weedbeds, and they were delicious! They preferred artifical gulp minnows over the real thing. Have a great trip!"
564536,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-04-16 02:22:00,80,"Looks like I'll be going to Dogtooth and Kilvert again this year. June 8th-16th. Learned a lot last year. I have a pretty good idea what to exspect after last year. Plus, we have another guy going so we won't have to fish 3 out of a boat. Just hope the weather cooperates a little more this year. The weather wasn't bad persay. It was just that by the time we got there, the season was about 3 weeks ahead of schedule. Anyone else headed up this year? Let's see some posts. Joe"
564595,Grappler,2007-04-17 09:52:00,47,"We are heading up the week before you, June 1st through the 8th. 44 days, 16 hours, and 9 minutes till we leave."
564626,ScottL,2007-04-18 08:37:00,733,"I will be there towards the end of August. I can't remember the exact dates something like the 22nd thru the 26th. Regards, Scott Lee Since there is six times as much water as dry land on earth, any fool can plainly see the good Lord meant for man to fish six times as much as he works."
564631,Guest,2007-04-18 13:45:00,0,What resorts are on this lake?
564634,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-04-18 15:15:00,80,"Dogtooth Resort is the only real resort on the lake. Luther Camp is a summer camp. I have heard that they do rent cabins, but I don't really know for sure. There is a Camp Hideaway on the northeast end of the lake. I think it may be a small resort. Once again. not really sure. You can find the Dogtooth Resort phone number and e-mail if you go to the Ontario sunset country website. If you can't, post back and I'll give them to you. I think Camp Hideaway might be on the same website too. Joe"

557291,jigman 2003,2006-05-16 07:06:00,981,"Wow, where do I start? First off I would suggest doing some searches here and doing a LOT of reading. Best tips I can give off the top of my head for a walleye trip to Canada: 1. TAKE QUALITY RAINGEAR-and take it in the boat with you whenever you go out, even if it appears there is no way it can rain. 2. Buy lots of 1/4 and 3/8 ounce jigs in bright colors (chartreuse, orange, white, pink, etc.) 3. Buy lots of 3"" and 4"" plastic tails, Power Bait, Gulp, and regular plastics all work. The scented plastics will outperform the others at times. 4. Buy a bunch of night crawlers(I don't take them, but for a novice they will help). Only use half at a time, no need for the whole crawler. Make sure your crawlers meet the requirements to enter Canada, or buy them there. 5. Take a bunch of shallow and medium diving crankbaits. 6. TAKE QUALITY RAINGEAR I'm sure others will have plenty to add to this list. Like I said, do some searches here and read a lot."
557295,Guest,2006-05-16 08:32:00,0,"We'll be at Dogtooth the week before you. Stop in Cabin 12 when you get there, we'll give you the latest scoop. Good advice on the rain gear and warm clothing. p.s. Wayne has all the bait you'll need and plenty of maps and advice."
557320,Guest,2006-05-16 11:15:00,0,"Wow very tough lake to start your walleye fishing on! I ahve been on the lake quite a few times and the lake is a BIG fish lake. The lake can be very frustrating. At that time of year I would concentrate on the river between Kilvert and Dogtooth (not the shallow one). Below the second narrows there are some good spots to hit. I would try the north end bays with shallow rocks. I would find inlets, current and hit them all. Good luck and unfortunately sometimes that is what you need on this lake."

557317,Guest,2006-05-16 23:27:00,0,"Thanks to all. Keep the tips comong. I'm not a complete rookie. I'm from Rockford IL and I mainly fish for LM bass, panfish and occasionally Northern. I have been walleye fishing a couple of times. I have fished northern Minnesota a half a dozen times over the past 15 years. I learned about how to layer my clothes and the need for good rain gear up there. The last time I went, my son was old enough to go up with the ""guys"". He got my old rain suit and I bought a new one from Stearns. What a mistake. He stayed dry and I got soaked. I have another new set that I'm hoping is OK. Tech 2o from Field and Stream. Guaranteed waterproof. We'll see. The main problem that I think I'll have is finesse. The guy I'm going up with is pretty much set in his ways. He uses light tackle, live bait and trolls most of the time. Around here I mainly cast with artificials and use medium to medium heavy stuff and am used to hard hook sets and trying to horse em in through heavy cover. I know I'm really going to have to be on my toes and keep be alert for those finicky walleyes and smallies. I've got decent equipment. Quantum Catalst PTi20 reels on 6 foot medium action Quantum HSX54 Hi-strain graphite rods. I'm also trying new line. P-Line Floroclear 6# test. Hope I get to try some of my artificials. I've got plenty of jigs and plastic and crankbaits. I'm not used to trolling so I hope I get the chance to do some casting while I'm there. Well enough of me rambling. Keep those cards and letters coming and again thanks to all. Good Fishing! Joe"

We can give you some scoops on the fishing while we were there. I don't remember what cabin we are in this year, but Black Sheep will know where we are. Watch for jugs (BFR's) and brown water. These spell bad news."
