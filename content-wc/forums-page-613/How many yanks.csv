574284,sarg,2008-05-25 09:01:00,29,I've often wondered what percentage of a fishing camp's busines in NW Ontario is derived from American outdoorsmen.I know that there are several hundered camps in NW Ontario and that most of them have a very short season to make a go of it.With all the talk and complaining about gas prices I wonder how many camps will be facing real econonic problems if alot of us yanks decide that it is getting too expensive to fish in Canada.The baby boomer generation is getting older and the next generation just doesn't seem to have the same interest in fishing and hunting that we do.It could spell hard times ahead for Canadian fishing camps.Just my view on the times we are facing.
574287,Guest,2008-05-25 10:26:00,0,HI. I think you are probably right. my folks had 3 kids. when were young we all fished canada. when us kids got to be adults just my brother and my family fished canada. now we have moved to las vegas we dont fish in canada anymore and my kids never went once they grew up. I dont think any of my brothers kids ever fished canada and my adult kids have never gone either. I dont think its the gas more like no interest now or they are busy with life. I would like to but its just toooo far for us. of all the times we stayed at resorts up there we might have met just a handful of folks that were canadians.
574288,Guest,2008-05-25 10:40:00,0,"Hi guys. This is one of the few sites I found with a message board. I'm from California, and an avid flyfisherman. I've fished all over the western US & Canada, but mostly flyfishing and catching trout. I have recently planned my 1st trip to Quetico area and realize I'll be fishing for walleye, and pike as well. Can you guys tell me what's the absolute basic needed tackle to have success with these bigger fish. For example do I need a steel leader? What size test line? What types of lures or bait? And if you are a flyfisherman, what size/type of fly works well? Thanks a ton to anyone willing to help out an eastern CA novice...."

While its not the deciding factor, it is a lot of money. But I think you may be right with the lack of interest being a big factor too. Erik, I'd start a new thread if I was you, you'll get more replies. But yes if your fishing toothy critters like northerns or musky's a steel leader is a good way to keep what lures you have...:) A decent bait cast rig like a Garcia 6500 series and 25 to 35# test with a matching rod would work well for them. Walleyes I'd try a med action fast tip rod with a mid priced spinning reel and 8# test. Not a fly fisherman so I can't help ya there Al"

However, this will affect the total number of camps. Camps that are not run well may go out of business... reducing the total number of resorts, and helping the strong get stronger. Last point, the day of the ""fishing camp"" is going fast. Camp owners who struggle to fill their cabins must get creative. Family retreats, company get aways, hot tubs, card tournaments... any way you can get people to stay."

The owners said that most of their business is from Minnesota and Wisconsin and that their bookings are down about 25% from 2007 at this point in the season. They said that declining economic conditions were the main factor in loss of repeat bookings and cancellations, especially from Minnesota anglers."
