570993,joeman79,2008-01-23 16:40:00,417,"540 something!!! We don't get to go to Canada this summer. Have to do the Family thing which is cool. Taking the kids to ALASKA. Momma says she wants to take the kids on one big trip while they they are still all near home and in high schol and college. She usually gets her way. In the meantime I come here all the time to keep my spirit up, and maybe learn about a kick #### new spot. Looking for a Smallie-Walleye-Pike Lake -fly in- boat in or drive in. Maybe Lac Seul or Kenora area. Like remote though, I am around people everyday and I love the part of being only people on lake. Good luck to u all and report back on your trips, keeps the fire burning. Oh how a cold LaBatts and hot piece of Fresh walleye tastes. Hate to miss it. But will be a Hoot taking our 4 girls 14-21 to Alaska so they can see it for themselves and not in Pictures. Will truly be priceless."

570987,A Canuck,2008-01-23 15:25:00,86,"Well I hope you all have a great time up here, bring home alot of memories and a few fish for the family! Sometimes I think we as Canadians take what we have in our own backyard for granted.. Nice to see some folks excited to come here and play! Please can I ask one favour though? I ask this to US and Canadian fishermen alike.. Take home more then you came with... and by that statement I mean bring a garbage bag with you, if you see junk please put it in the bag. It is up to each of us to keep our natural resources as natural as possible. I have been in the bush many times and still I cant escape the dreaded Tim Hortons cup or beer can. and you know what? It is safe to say 95% of that junk is from Canadians! Please if you see litter pick it up.. Have a great trip, Have a great time, be safe and please post a report upon your return! AC."
