574122,pike50plus,2008-05-21 09:46:00,584,"Fishing Tidbits Planning on eating your freshwater catch? Here are some tips on how to prepare fish for cooking so that they will taste better when they're cooked. Put fish on ice immediately after catching them. Filet or clean fish as soon as possible. Put fish in zip-loc bags with a tablespoon of salt as soon as cleaned. Fill bag with water and squeeze all air out before sealing. Keep bag in refrigerator until 1 hour before cooking. Drain salt water and soak fish in fresh water for one hour. Cook with favorite recipe! Tips: 1. Filets are not as strong tasting as whole fish. 2. Be sure to mix salt in water completely before sealing. 3. Soaking fish in fresh water just before cooking removes most of the salt.

574173,Guest,2008-05-22 09:28:00,0,I guess I didn't explain that completely. When I got my first vacuum sealer I tried to seal immediately after cleaning. Even after patting dry with paper towels it sucked enough moisture into the pump to ruin it. Expensive $280.00 lesson. No problem since I started freezing over night and then sealing in the morning.
574175,Guest,2008-05-22 09:35:00,0,Our group has a big fish fry every year with the walleye we bring home. This is always on Super Bowl weekend. We invite quite a few others to this fish fry. If you also would like to know what sides we have or what kind of beer we drink all I can say is it varies from year to year.
574252,woods,2008-05-23 11:35:00,646,We had a guy get a 10 pound northern stripped clean by turtles overnight.
574257,T Mac,2008-05-23 15:42:00,10084,"Same here. Or fry them all and eat what's left, cold, the next day. I can't decide if I like them better cold or hot, anyway. :)"

573907,deputy dog,2008-05-14 15:50:00,305,"luckily, we wait until the day we're gonna eat 'eyes to chunk them up, but when we do we keep them in lake water in the fridge then blot excess water off before frying. also, does anyone have experience using a ""food saver"" to vacum seal filets for taking home? we thought about taking ours up this year and keeping them that way. any tips, hints? thanks!"
573909,Guest,2008-05-14 16:12:00,0,Hi. we have seen some really bit turtles up in lake of the woods. the 2 we saw and this is an estimate of the shell size of at least 12 to 16 inches in diameter. I dont know what they do over the winter hybernate? the food saver works really good. with this thought you do have to pat them sort of dry or any liquid get sucked out and keeps the seal from sealing allowing air to leak in.
573910,Guest,2008-05-14 16:12:00,0,"Yes when we used to bring fish back from Canada we used the foodsaver. One of the guys would buy the long roll of bags and cut off the size we needed.All our Walleyes were under 18 inches,but the Bigger lake trout of course needed custom sized bags. one fish per bag in case you get stopped...easy to count and see.We left the skin on the fillets and the two fillets attached by the tail."
573912,Guest,2008-05-14 17:41:00,0,"We love the vacuum method. Clean the fish that you are going to take home right before supper and rinse well. Put them in individual plastic bags or Saranwrap and lay the 2 fillets inside together, flat and neat on a cookie sheet or a piece of plywood in the freezer overnight. In the morning while drinking coffee and bull****n' take them out of the freezer and the plastic bag and they'll be just firm enough to vacuum seal without ruining the pump with moisture and you will not have any moisture messing up the seal. I usually do about eight to ten fish a night like this for the whole group and they're all impressed by how nice they look and keep when they get home. Vacuum sealing them also reduces freezer burn. Ours keep great in my 0 degree freezer for eight to ten months. I don't think I would try and keep them for any longer. It would be up to you."
573914,deputy dog,2008-05-14 18:49:00,305,"so in your experience, if we vacumed them after cleaning and rinsing that may affect the machine? we do a fly-in with the freezer only running 4-5 hours in the a.m. and p.m. so the quicker we can get them in the freezer the better we will be."
573922,Guest,2008-05-14 19:52:00,0,"Clean them, wash them, season them, add fresh eggs put in zip lock freezer baggy, squeeze air out and chill. cooler with ice or refridgerate. Next day they're ready for bread crumbs, flour, batter or just fry them up. Best walleye you'll ever have. It's like marinated them while keeping them fresh. The eggs keep that fishy taste away. Mista W secret in keepin it fresh... I also have a multitude of Walleye recipes. Coming soon at:http://mistawalleye.blogspot.com/ Mista W"
573930,Obabikon,2008-05-15 05:34:00,2370,"I've lost a couple of stringers to big snappers! Definately run a risk by leaving them on the dock. Also, Otters aren't usually scared of people... not like some animals are. We have one that climbs up on our dock just about every day, and I've heard other camps having a family that hangs around. Keep the minnow buckets locked, and the minnow shed closed! They can go through a gallon of minnows in just a few minutes!"
573933,Mohleye,2008-05-15 07:46:00,368,"This is probably stating the obvious, but don't forget that those fillets in the fridge count towards your possession limit."

And at least in Ontario, you cannot keep fish alive, once you have decided to harvest...right? Assuming you don't leave dead fish on a stringer in the water overnight. They would get kind of rank, wouldn't they?"
573876,Sutsgold,2008-05-14 07:25:00,219,How do you guys store walleye fillets to keep them fresh as possible if you plan on eating them the next day?
573877,Guest,2008-05-14 08:40:00,0,rinsed good...zip lock bag...cooler or refrig.
573882,Sutsgold,2008-05-14 09:51:00,219,Do you simply wash them or do you blot them down to remove the water and store them somewhat dry?
573885,Guest,2008-05-14 10:44:00,0,Moist. I'll even let them sit in bowl of water if I am going to use them later the same day. It firms up the filets nicely.Pat dry well before cooking. Golden Candy:)
573889,phishfearme,2008-05-14 11:52:00,1242,stuts - why not just keep them on a stringer at the dock? walleye stay remarkable well on a stringer. just make sure the water is deep enough to keep the gulls off. phish
573890,SSH,2008-05-14 12:01:00,526,"If you leave them on a stringer, good luck if there are any turtles near by."

573897,phishfearme,2008-05-14 13:36:00,1242,have kept them on a stringer for years and have never had problems with turtles nor otters - didn't even know turtles lived up north and otters tend to stay away from camp. phish
573900,Guest,2008-05-14 14:22:00,0,Otters not only like fish on a stringer they have a taste for minnows in the minnow bucket. As for turtles in most cases as long as you can tie up the stringer over deep water the snappers leave them alone. Though my preference is to clean the fish right away and into the fridge of cooler asap
