Haven't taken delivery yet to play around with it, but does anyone know what kind of base map is included in this unit for Saskatchewan lakes and rivers. Most of my fishing is in the northern part of the province including Codette, Tobin, Deschambeault and Jan lakes. Does the base map provide any mapping at all of these lake areas, or am I just going to see a blank screen when viewing the base map. IE does it show the shoreline pretty accurate? I guess as a further question, does anyone know of and products out there that have more detailed maps for some fishing bodies in northern Sask? I see that Navionics hotmaps premium has Tobin as one of the lakes in Sask. Guess I'm just kinda curious what level of detail the base map will have. My initial thought is none, if its anything like my handheld GPS. You have to buy a mapping software, and even then the detail on the maps is quite sketchy (again, thats referring to my handheld GPS) I guess not a huge deal as I know where I'm going, and I can still mark my waypoints, even though they may appear to be floating around in space Thanks in advance for any info"

The Freedom Maps (available from LEI) provide topo level detail so are way better. I think they now have chips with large segments of Canada on each chip so you can cover about 1/3rd of the country with each chip and they overlap quite a bit. Have a look at them, they don't have any lake depth data however, or at least the one I got two years ago doesn't. Good Luck, Paul"
