564995,Guest,2007-05-06 22:27:00,0,"Just curious, how do they get the boats to the outpost camps? Are they floan in with helicoptors or planes. Just trying to figure how a 16 foot Lund makes it so far from a road."
564999,Bill Krejca,2007-05-07 06:40:00,6107,"Once the lakes and rivers become frozen, a large portion of the waterways become highways. Many of the outpost cabins and other buildings, docks,etc, are built using lumber that is trucked in during the winter. Boats are brought in in a similar manner."
565005,Guest,2007-05-07 08:38:00,0,One of our trips out of Nakina a Lund was strapped to the floats and flown in with 8 of us.
565007,campownerchick,2007-05-07 09:42:00,13,Most boats are strapped on to the side of planes and flown in. A 16 foot boat has to be flown in on an Otter while ones 14 foot long are stapped on to a Beaver or Norseman. Cessna 180s and 185s can also move a 14 foot boat. Some outfitters use helicopters to fly several boats nested together and while it sounds like an expensive proposition it can actually work out cheaper than flying in one at a time using a float plane.
565008,T Mac,2007-05-07 09:57:00,10084,"Float planes. They lash them to the float braces... Some times on small lakes (too small for a Big plane capable of carrying a couple boats) they get over the lake and cut 'em loose. The Lunds ""crash land"" on those lakes...LOL! (No Joke)."
565012,MoWalleyeguy,2007-05-07 14:36:00,409,"I have seen both ways... Float Plane and Helicopter. The Helicopter I saw was carrying 4 or 5 at once! That was a cool sight. I dont think the method of driving them in the winter over frozen lakes is used much since ""most"" lakes are so remote there are no access roads for this to work."
565013,Guest,2007-05-07 14:47:00,0,I've seen them come in by rail as well if the camp is near a railway. The Beech 10 that Rusty Meyers uses can carry the bigger Lunds as well. Flying antiques but they are oh so cool.
565018,Pooch,2007-05-07 20:32:00,4619,Several years ago on Seseganaga the guy running the camp said that the previous winter he pulled in new boats behind a snowmobile. Just hooked several together and took off. Pooch
565019,Guest,2007-05-07 22:11:00,0,great machine the beech 18 is. flew many a boats and still is...
