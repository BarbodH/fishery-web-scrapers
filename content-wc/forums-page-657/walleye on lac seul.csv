564973,Guest,2007-05-06 08:43:00,0,Going up there 3rd week in june for the first time. Are the walleyes moving then or are they still in their spring locations. We are in Goose Bay area and don't want to travel too far. Ive heard they come out of mckenzie but that seems kind of far. thanks
565009,Guest,2007-05-07 13:43:00,0,water is supposed to be low this year and that will make the Walleye head out early. You want to find water that is 10 to 20 foot deep because they will be on the move. Work windy points and flats with jigs or bottom bouncers. Minnows or worms should both do well.
565015,Guest,2007-05-07 18:14:00,0,"Everything will depend on the weather between now and then. In 2003, the water was very low, but because of the spring temp, the walleye were still pretty shallow (8 - 12 feet). Given that the water was down about 4 feet, we did not go by the maps, but by the depth finder. If we get a warm spring, then the odds are they will be in the 12' plus range. However, on LS don't overlook the shallow bite, even on a sunny calm day. We have had days where the air temp is 80+ F with bright sun and no wind and for some reasons, the walleyes, even the big girls"" were in very shallow (3 - 4 feet). Also, when the waves are breaking on rocky points, defintely pitch those with jigs and cranks, aim right for the shore and bring them back slowly. You will figure out where the fish are pretty quick if they are those points. There are a number of lodges that post fishing reports for the past couple of years that can give you a real good feel for what has happened in the past. Keep in mind that is the past and every year brings something new. IA Walleye"
565021,Guest,2007-05-08 08:12:00,0,I would try Steamboat first. Lac Seul sometimes defies walleye logic so try what you know and don't be afraid to try something that seems wrong. Three years ago we got to Lac Seul at the end of a mayfly hatch. That day it was 80+ and sunny. A storm came through and we had frost on the windows the next morning. We slaugthered the eyes in 6-12 foot of water the next day. It was glass calm and sunny. We were constantly having to clean the dead mayflys off of our equipment.
