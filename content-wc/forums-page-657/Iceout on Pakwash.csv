565171,Guest,2007-05-11 06:11:00,0,"Hey guys! We will be heading up for the second week of June to Snake Falls. This will be our second year, and if it is anything like last year we will be very happy. We caught tons of fish, and my personal best northern (42"") last year when we were up there. Let us know how you do!. Fishinglund P.S. Our group is from Marshalltown"
564840,LunkerG,2007-04-29 21:44:00,12,Can anyone give me the word on predicted ice out on Pakwash? We're heading up on 5/17 and I'm wanting to badly know when the ice goes out. Thanks.
564843,Guest,2007-04-30 07:10:00,0,"it should be gone by then, gullrock is well on it's way to being ice free by the end of this week. So I would guess most of the area lakes would be in the same situation."
564958,LunkerG,2007-05-05 08:33:00,12,Is this ice now gone on Pakwash and Gull Rock?
564961,Guest,2007-05-05 12:03:00,0,yes open water everywhere
564964,Guest,2007-05-05 18:16:00,0,i look at the cabin camera and with the ice so thick i can not be sure from the camera if the ice is just floating below the water or not.
564986,Guest,2007-05-06 18:02:00,0,Lunker G where are you from and where are you staying on Pakwash? Will be there the same weekend. Later

565125,Frankm,2007-05-10 06:18:00,154,Hey Lunker G we're staying at Brownlees that week too. This is our 13th year in a row. Is this your first time to Brownlees?
565156,Guest,2007-05-10 16:50:00,0,We are from MN we stay at the resort that is up the kochiking river Not sure what they call it now. Fred use to own it been going up there since 1987 missed a few years. Will be in a black 1775 lund with a 150 evenrude and grey kicker. Sounds like the jig bite in the trout river will be over ice out on the 7-8th but it has been 70-80 degrees up there the last couple of days. Looks like spinners and plugs Later Walleye Fred
565161,LunkerG,2007-05-10 18:49:00,12,"3rd time for me. zillionth time for my buddy. I think you may have helped me out with my Evinrude a couple years ago, or someone who was with you. We'll be in Cabin 6. See you!! We're so fired up to get up there!!!"
