565037,dave10,2007-05-08 14:03:00,342,"I'd also like the exit number when coming from the South. Somehow I missed it last year, and ended up about five miles out of my way to the west. Thanks, guys. Dave"

565053,bensen,2007-05-08 21:04:00,155,"Yes the bypass is open. Has been for a while. Very nice. Heckel's on the old 53 though, is closed. Could stay open once the highway opening. Too much loss of business. They closed in Osseo too. Re-opened as a Moe's Diner. Same management, just a new name. Heckels does have a location in Lake Hallie. OO Exit off the 53 bypass. Take a the OO exit. Left on OO. Left on Business 53. Turn left at the next traffic light. Then right & look for the Big Steer. Easy to find. Right in front of Farm & Fleet. Same good food as the old location. Good luck in Canada."

565024,Grappler,2007-05-08 09:59:00,47,"Fellow Fishermen and Fisherwomen, Thank you for all the information you have given me since I became a member. I am very appreciative. I have searched the past posts to see if there was any word on the Bypass around Eau Claire being finished or completed. I found one that stated that it would be open Aug 21 of 20006. Is it currently open? Does it connect directly to 94? We are leaving for Canada in 23 days, 16 hours, 4 minutes, and 33 secs. On our trip up, we stop in Eau Claire at Heckel's family restaurant (recommend to anyone) for breakfast. On the return trip, however, we usually just go straight through due to our gas fillups on the way back. Any tips or information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Grappler"
565026,rpieske,2007-05-08 10:23:00,1276,When I came home last year I believe it was open.
565028,Frankm,2007-05-08 11:08:00,154,My dads friend has driven through there recently. He informed us that it was finished and open.
565030,Guest,2007-05-08 11:27:00,0,"Yes it is done, set the cruise for 70 mph. I live close to Eau Claire."
565031,clemento,2007-05-08 12:00:00,48,Anybody know the exit number off of 94 coming from the south into Eau Claire
565032,Illini Bill,2007-05-08 12:00:00,53,It's been open since last summer. If you don't want to get off the bypass to eat at Heckel's in Eau Claire there's another one on the Chicago side of Eau Claire. I believe it's at the Osseo exit.

Thank you to all who have responded. I appreciate all of your information. The one in Osseo was the one we stopped at before, but they have been closed the last two years. That is why we stop at the one with the Giant Cow out in front. If it is open now, HOORAY!!! then we can use the bypass. Good luck to all and have a great fishing summer."
