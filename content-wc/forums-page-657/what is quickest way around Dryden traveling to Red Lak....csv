564945,Guest,2007-05-04 15:04:00,0,Just checking which way is the quickest to Red Lake coming from International Falls. Would we be better going through Dryden or taking Hwy. 594 to Eagle River. Which is faster in your experience? or do you have a different route? thank you for your responses
564947,Guest,2007-05-04 15:58:00,0,"If you come up 502 (the road from fort frances that doesn't go through sioux narrows) then in my opinion go toward Dryden but at the corner where you can see the paper mill there is a sign that points to highway 17, turn left onto that road and you will bypass downtown Dryden. Turn left at the stop lights and you're on your way to Red Lake. If you take 594, it is maybe shorter, but the road is nowhere near the condition of the above mentioned route and would probably take longer."
564948,Guest,2007-05-04 16:05:00,0,Take 594 and enjoy the scenery. How often do you see a cattle ranch in Ontario?
564951,Guest,2007-05-04 17:54:00,0,"Go through Dryden, stop at the 7/11 for a fresh cup of coffee and cheap calling cards. I heard that the 594 is horrible, especially if towing a boat."
564952,Guest,2007-05-04 18:29:00,0,Is 594 the one that looks paved and about a 1/4 mile it turns to gravel/dirt? i would go with the bypass right at the paper mill storage yard. although whats a couple of minutes one way or another. its probably another 3 hours anyway.
564956,sidewinder,2007-05-05 07:20:00,96,594 is shorter true about majority not paved but not a problem --we do not pull a boat but still exceed posted speed limit like them cheap calling cards at 7/11 also--they have come in handy
564960,Guest,2007-05-05 08:56:00,0,"WE go to Gullrock lake which is just south of Red Lake, and I prefer to take the route west from Fort Frances thru Emo then north thru Nestor Falls, Sioux Narrows then back east to Vermillion Bay. I've driven the Dryden route, It's a little shorter but not as scenic. The Nestor Falls route has some breathtaking views and smoother road, but 30-40 miles farther. It's a little more drive, but worth it!!!!"
564963,waleht,2007-05-05 18:00:00,132,"Its really going to come down if you are pulling a boat or not and how nice your rig is. I have been going up to Wabasakng since 1978 which is just south of Red lake. Then there was no 502 and then in the beginning that was 90 miles of gravel. Enough with the history lesson. 502 is pretty good now, but its about 90 miles of nothing but highway and woods. Not good if you break down. Been there done that. To answer your question. I have taken 594 and then a gravel road that takes you through Oxdrift and ends up on HWY 17 which saves you about 40 minutes, but its not worth it if your have a nice vehicle or pulling a nice boat. Plus if you have never taken that route you could get lost and end up on some back roads that are worse. ALso your boat, ropes and cover get all dusty which can be quite dirty when taking your cover off etc. The drive through Dryden is not bad and is the way I go now exclusively since I bought a new truck and boat. Last fall I took the west route through Soiux narrows and it was a trade off of a little nicer road, but a little longer trip. This spring I will probably take 502 through Dryden on the way up and the west route through Souix narrows on the way home. Hope this helps, Brent"

We fish the same Red Lake area and used to go the Nestor Falls route until 502 was repaired. Now 502 is fine except for one short stretch a little rough. Good Luck!"
