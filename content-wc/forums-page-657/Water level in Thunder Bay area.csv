565107,Guest,2007-05-09 13:14:00,0,"We fly out of Armstrong every year and are expecting low to very low water this year. Our outfitter lives in Thunder Bay in the winter and has forwarned us of this possibility,"

The steelhead fishing has been spotty the past few weeks, but the fish are around. Unless significan train comes, you can expect very low water. If you want details on specific rivers/lakes in that area, the thunderbayfishing.com message board will put yuo in touch with many avid anglers who specifically fish that area. NWO Fishing Bum"
565133,Guest,2007-05-10 08:23:00,0,I'am guessing but it sounds like we use the same outfitter. We fly in May 19 wilderness north is the outfitter going to ogoki lake. If you use the same outfitter please respond.
