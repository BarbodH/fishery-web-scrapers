True, rates were great some years back, we went most of 4-5 years without and increase even though our costs were starting to creap up. The progressive camps that are now in demand did the right thing and reinvested the extra into new facilities and equipment; you can see the results now in a down market, the ones that took the money and ran are now hurting for business and some of these camps can't be sold at what they think they're worth. Just a few observations on business. Hope the prices of travel treat you all right, gas here is about 1.10/ liter at the pumps, minnows are up about 10-15% again do to costs of doing business. The good operators will get through and you will all have a good value for the money it takes; just remember that Disney World ain't cheep either and that's just a bunch of fake crap a long way from what Canada has to offer!"
565004,Guest,2007-05-07 08:32:00,0,I guess I am under 40 so the best option for me is to use an ATM to get cash. They also tend to have lower fees than walking into a bank and doing the exchange by teller. Bobby
565010,Guest,2007-05-07 13:46:00,0,"I learned something interesting when I went to a couple of banks here in central Wisconsin a few years ago to exchange money. When I asked if I could exchange American dollars for Canadian, the teller told me that they don't ""exchange"" but rather that they ""sell"" the Canadian currency. Then if I brought some Canadian home and wanted to exchange it back, they would actually be buying the Canadian back from me. Naturally there are fees associated with this transaction, and they charge these fees as a part of the rate. She then asked if I was a customer, and at the time I was not. She suggested I open an account, because as an account holder I would be charged less for purchasing currency than I would be if I were a non-account holder. She also told me that if I bought some Canadian, I should not expect to get the same rate selling it back to them, because they would, in effect, charge me more to buy the Canadian from me. So if I spent $100A, then turned right around and sold the Canadian back to them, I would get less than my $100A back. That's how they make their money, I guess, just like paying more interest for borrowing money than you get for interest on your savings. This, I found, is still cheaper than exchanging currency at shops near the border, or using American cash at some small store or gas station and hope the high school girl waiting on you can figure out your change (and gives it back to you in Canadian) and gives you a fair exchange rate. Hope this makes sense to you. 31 days. Can't wait."

Yeah, but the wife doesn't care that she's spending a ton of money on Disney for the ""family"". She has issues when it's for a guys fishing trip. BTW, my wife has said that she'll never come up. She is a total squito magnet. No DEET required in your party if she's around. I value my marriage too much to allow her to come with me. Oh yeah, Canada, you need to fix your 360 movie in Epcot. Very Dated. (just there 4/2007)"
564815,Guest,2007-04-29 06:33:00,0,"2 Dogs is right, but banks usually charge 2-4% sevice on the official rate. The rate has been dropping and I saw my first business last week with a sign that US$ were recieved at par. Most are giving 5-7% at least. We in the resort business take in US$ if we price in US, but the bills still keep rolling in in CA$ and the pinch is really on. The falling US$ will continue to force rates up if the camps keep prices in US$, which has been prefered by our customers. Don't want to be a wet blanket but we need to stay in business., rate increases will probably continue untill exchanges return with a stronger US$"

This particular TD branch we use, seems to be all business and does not give me the ""down home friendly service"" I am used too. Having lived in a rural community all my life, that is something that is important to me."

564834,tlars,2007-04-29 16:08:00,137,"As a long time community banker in Iowa, I follow the exchange rates only because they pop up on the markets portal page I use. I spend a week in late May and a week in late Sept. on Lac Seul. The resort owners are to be commended for not hiking prices more than they have for '06 and again for '07. The uncertainty of fuel prices coupled with the exchange rate makes me happy to run a bank and not a resort. Iowa arithmetic tells me that the US dollar is down more than 25% against the Canadian dollar over the past couple of years. We all know that the only certainty is change. Guess I'll just wait and see what happens."
564988,walleyeduran,2007-05-06 18:15:00,286,"Gary, I understand the pinch the resort owners are in with the US doller being so low, but you do have to remember that 3 & 4 years ago the resort owners that had their prices in US funds were doing a pretty good exchange. Duran PS Gas prices are hurting us all, cabin prices are going up on an annual basis, 15 imperial gallons included with the cabin are gone, minnow prices are going up, etc... (this doesn't include all of the bills on the rise to keep a house going) But, I will pinch and scratch to make sure I can get away for a week of two so my insanity stays at a managable level."

564796,sarg,2007-04-28 08:47:00,29,Does anyone know what the exchange rate is this year?We are going up the first week in july and would like to know what to expect.Thanks
564798,2 DOGS,2007-04-28 09:23:00,361,As of April 27th it was $1.1158 so for every $1 US you'd get approx. $1.11 Canadian back. It's dropped considerably in the last 60 days. Who knows what it will be by July. Could be better or could be worse!
564803,Guest,2007-04-28 18:22:00,0,"good question! Be sure to exchange your funds to Canadian at a bank (preferable one inside of the USA). paying for stuff here in Canada in American funds you are certainly not getting the current exchange rate... infact you are getting ripped off, as they are making money for doing the exchange for you. The reason I say to exchange your money in the US? unless you have an account with the bank you deal here in Canada you are NOT getting their best exchange rate. I have several bank accounts. the Bank in which I have my savings account with gives me a WAY better exchange rate then the bank I have my chequeing account with... reason? I carry a minimum balance of $XXX.XXX.xx and am a preferred customer, this probably will also work to your advantage as well.. Best to do your exchange with your local bank that you always deal with. Call in advance in you are requiring a large amount of CDN funds they will have them ready and you will certainly get the best exchange rate possible. Have a great evening and enjoy your stay in our beautiful country! A Canuck"
564805,Guest,2007-04-28 19:40:00,0,I wind up paying a charge if I get in in the US. I normally get $200.00 american but pay money for the transfer. Am I still coming out ahead? Pretty simple stopping in Ft. Frances at the bank.
564808,bigfish1965,2007-04-28 22:28:00,3210,Use a credit card whenever possible and YOUR bank will give you the best rate without charges.

We are starting a building project and have not been overly impressed with our particular TD Canada branch bank and would move banks in a heartbeat for a better exchange rate. Small rate differences can be significant. Thanks"

564814,Guest,2007-04-29 06:31:00,0,"I have a couple I deal with on a regular basis, BMO, CIBC and a Credit Union. I Use CIBC for business, BMO for chequeing and the Credit Union for savings. The Credit Unions tend to have lower overhead, and therefore can offer more competitive rates. Sure they are still in it to make money, but they can do so on lower margins. They generally also offer better interest rates then the ""Big Three"" Take a look at First Ontario Credit Union. I know they are on strike right now but hopefully that will soon be taken care of. PS.. I dislike TD Canada Trust. Hope this helps! A Canuck"
