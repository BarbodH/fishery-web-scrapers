I don't expect too much in the way of run off as the bush was really dry as we went into winter. Lakes and streams are low; some of the lowest water conditions I have seen in years. Lac Seul is as low as it was 5 years ago if not a bit lower. We need rain bad, for the water level as well as ice out help. Got in an hour ago from our last ice fishing trip, this afternoon there was 30"" of ice under the auger yet, and the ice is very tight to the shore.It will take some real warm weather with rain and wind to have ice out by the traditional Mother's Day weekend we usually see here. I'll keep you posted as things progress."

We have light showers now but really need rain. Lake is the lowest many remember but is coming up already. I've been in the bush for the last 5 days scouting new bait ponds, the creeks are running good and the frost is still going out in the swamps so the water should run good for a while. A logger friend said the Root river is running great so we hope conditions improve significantly in the weeks running up to opener. Hope everone has a good trip and drive safe."

565001,Guest,2007-05-07 07:58:00,0,"Low is low, as low as 5 years ago, water is slowly coming up, we'll get to the boats ok. Walleye spawn is going god this last week; Northerns may have a tough year as the grasses they use are high and dry.There is a treat of rain today, we need it; some grass fires in the area over the weekend as their is always some fool trying to burn in dry conditions with 25mph winds even with restrictions on. No official word yet per shore lunchs but common sense would rule them out."
