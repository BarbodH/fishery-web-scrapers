So last years Honey hole is almost on shore, find a new spot, that is one of the great things about fishing, every trip is a new adventure! If your to old to be walking a few extra feet to the boat maybe you should just stay home and sit in the Rocker."
564987,UncleZeb,2007-05-06 18:04:00,1,What would the difference be if they were not telling the truth about the water levels. You have to be able to spread some amount of BS to be a camp owner in the first place.....
564666,Guest,2007-04-19 22:34:00,0,Does anyone know how the water level will be or is expected to be at Gull Rock this year?
564674,Guest,2007-04-20 11:22:00,0,"If the mnr puts the logs in at snowshoe falls then the water level should be normal, we had a lot of snow this year."
564935,Guest,2007-05-04 08:32:00,0,"Haven't heard anything about Gull Rock. But Bluffy Lake is full. If your looking for good water and good fishing you might want to try there this year. You might try calling the Wilderness Camp at Bluffy Lake, if you want any additional info."
564936,Guest,2007-05-04 08:38:00,0,On the Golden Hook website he says that the lake is high. Did Red Lake get a more significant amount of snow than the Ear Falls area. Sounds like water is very low in Lac Seul and that they didn't get much snow.
564937,Guest,2007-05-04 08:43:00,0,"Just what is the water level on Lac Seul, if it is truly as low as you hear most docks have to be out of the water. I can understand those with a vested interest keeping it quiet but many people travel a considerable distance and don't want to be disappointed, not to mention tearing up their equipment."
564942,Guest,2007-05-04 10:39:00,0,You can get up-to-date water level info from the Lake of the Woods Water Control board. They have graphs that are updated almost daily because they have remote monitoring stations set up on Lac Seul. The website is:http://www.lwcb.ca/ Click on Basin Data on the left side of the page and find Lac Seul. All the data you'd ever want. Regards
564959,Guest,2007-05-05 08:45:00,0,"Don't listen to the bull, the entire Wenasaga system is low this year as are all water bodies and drainages. Snowshoe dam on the Chukuni is keeping Red Lake and Gullrock system in good shape but a bit lower than usual. There is only one cure for the levels and that is rain. Camp owners need to be straight up on levels and guests will need to be careful. Everyone should have a good season and be patient with access etc."
564970,Guest,2007-05-06 07:10:00,0,http://scitech.pyr.ec.gc.ca/waterweb/login.asp?lang=0 The link above will provide you with water level information for all of Canada. If you want Ontario WL's go to the interactive map and select a water monitoring station near the are you going to visit. Environment Canada operates the water monitoring sites for various organizations and posts the data on the website. I was just up in the Red Lake area flying around last week and there is high water North of Red Lake due to more snow and a quick melt.
564977,Guest,2007-05-06 10:14:00,0,The camp owner do not want us to know how low Lac Seul is. All they want is the BUCK. If poepal new they probady would not come.THE #### with the Exchange rate how far will we have to walk to found the boat how far will we have to walk to found water?
564980,Guest,2007-05-06 12:21:00,0,"Why would they lie? They would have to face the truth in the near future. If I found out I was lied to, I doubt i would go back. I doubt Evergreen is going to lie, they would have a successful camp if they have done so."
