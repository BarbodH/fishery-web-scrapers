I was wondering if anyone knew about the Freedom maps? I know that there are 3 different ones to choose from. I need the one with Red Lake, Ontario (Nungesser Lake) on it. Two of the maps have the Ontario province on it. I don't want to purchase the wrong one again. Do both maps have the entire province on them, or is it just parts of the province? These are the two maps. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

F112EX-EC (East Card) Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland, Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Hudson Bay and all Great Lakes, with coverage of Milwaukee, Chicago, Toledo, Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo and Syracuse."

I imagine these new 1Gb versions contain the same detail, just for a larger area. they have topographic map level detail but of course no lake depth information. Having looked at Navionics which have no background (topo) data I find these Freedom Maps much more useful since the lakes I fish are not on the Navionics chips that I have seen. Paul"
