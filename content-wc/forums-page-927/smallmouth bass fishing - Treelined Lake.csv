The lake is beautiful, as is the cabin (Randy had just completed it when we were flown in for a day of fishing out of one of his other lakes). The pike fishing was phenomenal (but again, that was spring/post-spawn fishing), but it was too early for bass. The water is gin clear with a lot of variation in depth (my recollection is that the center part of the lake had depths over 100 ft) and good shoreline structure. Randy didn't have anyone using the lake on a regular basis until he put up the new cabin, so the lake has not been overfished. His catch and release policy also maintains the quality of the fishery.Tell him the group from Iowa State sends their regards (we moved to a different outfitter last year, not because of anything Randy did, but rather because we were looking for bigger walleye)."
