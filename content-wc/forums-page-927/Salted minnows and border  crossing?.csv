523352,Guest,2002-08-22 11:47:00,0,Adding a little sugar to the salt makes the fatheads taste better. Serve with french fries or hash browns.
523355,Goldfish,2002-08-22 16:05:00,6,"The salt/sugar brew kills and keeps the minnow firm.Try this trick when packaging,after you do the salt/sugar thing put sawdust in the bag-no water- and give them a little shake so the minnow is coated.This keeps them seperated and easy to grab while stiil frozen.Good Luck !!"
523356,bigfish1965,2002-08-22 20:17:00,3210,Dead minnows are fine ( as long as the are not members of the smelt family). I cannot find reference to leeches other than they may not be transported in. It does not make exceptions for dead leeches that I see.
523357,Guest,2002-08-24 07:02:00,0,I have been using salt and borax solution for years. Several bait dealers use the same combination. Never heard of sugar being used before someone on this web site mentioned it; C12H22O11--what will that do? I use canning salt-cheap in a 1# box and borax-equal amounts. Borax will preserve the minnows and keep them flexible and their color intact. Salt will dry them outso they are like sticks and brittle and will come off the hook more easily.Shake them up and then freeze--if its just a couple days before you use them then just keep cool.No problem at the border. Except I don't think they'll accept smelt in any condition as they really don't want them brought in in any condition.
523343,DanL,2002-08-08 16:29:00,262,Can you bring salted minnows across the border? Thanks?
523344,Guest,2002-08-08 17:45:00,0,I have done it several times and I do declare them at the border-there are now fees or anything. They do work! Terry/IA
523345,troutaholic,2002-08-09 03:39:00,827,"Terry,I am trying to access the archives on salting minnows, but not much luck. What is the recipe?I know that you need Borax (is this the Borax Detergent?!) and plain salt.Any help is appreciated!!Thanks,Just Rip Lips and Keep a Tight Line"
523346,woman,2002-08-09 03:58:00,2,You better check with the border before you bring up the salted minnows. NO longer are minnows of any kind or leeches allowed over the border. Just worms in artifical bedding. Not sure of when the law changed but maybe 3 years ago. Better safe than sorry.
523347,deehawk,2002-08-09 05:42:00,178,"I think you can still take salted minnows across the border. We took salted minnows across in July through International Falls. They asked what bait we had, told them about the salted minnows and they sent us on our way. Took salted minnows across twice last year with no problems. They checked them in Baudette and again sent us on our way. So either they are being very nice to us or its still okay to bring across salted minnows.Brian"
523348,Guest,2002-08-09 10:14:00,0,"I make my own salted minnows. Find a bait shop that sells fatheadsby the gallon. Then, put 1/3 cup of salt and 1/3 cups of sugar in a one quart zip lock freezer bag. Shake the bag to mix the salt and sugar. Then, add 1 1/2 to 2 cups of minnows to each quart zip lock bag. Shake the bag to get the salt and sugar to coat the minnows.Flatten the bags and put all the bags in the freezer in large zip lock.Then, each day of fishing, take 1-2 bags with you in a cooler for the day's fishing. I have been using this for several years and they work great.In Twin Cities area, Vados bait sells fatheads by the gallon."
523349,Dave,2002-08-10 22:12:00,258,"I know that a Fathead is more than likey, a local word for a fish. But what is a Fathead? The only Fathead I know of is my son-in-law. He is alot like Archie's son-in-law the meathead Mike.Dave"
523353,stumcfar,2002-08-12 05:58:00,451,"As long as the minnows are dead, they are legal to cross the border. We ice fish just across the border almost every weekend in the winter. We buy our mnnows just before we leave and go into the bathroom and run hot water over them for a couple seconds. They die instantly and as long as you get the water off right away, they stay hard and firm. No problems at the border."
523350,Dave,2002-08-22 06:15:00,258,Steve:Have you ever tried salting leeches? We prefer leeches and are flying into an outpost after Labor Day. Based on my scouting report the Ontario leech supply is kaput for the year. any advice would be appreciated.Dave
523354,Xplorer,2002-08-22 06:35:00,244,"You cannot take salted smelt across the border, in fact you cant take smelt in any condition across. Never tried leeches. Xplorer"
