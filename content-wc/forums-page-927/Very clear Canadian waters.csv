I have never been there, but rumor has it that is is extremely clear. You can see down 18 ft in some spots. I have never fished a lake like this. Does anyone have any advice on this type of situation. Depth, colors, techniques? Also, there are supposedly a lot of lakers in this lake. I have never caught one. Does anyone have any advice for how to catch them this time of year?Thanks!Ryan"

What seemed to help was using the smallest line possible, no extra hardware such as swivels, etc. keeping your distance, long casts, etc. In other words, they can see you long before you see them and we could see them come out, start to hit, and then go back if they didn't like what they saw. We found that we had the best luck with long casts or trolling about twice as far as normal behind the boat. The lakers were easy. We used about a 2 oz., long lead sinker with swivels on each end. Tie one end to your line and about a 5-10 foot leader on the other with a swivel and a spoon and troll slow about 10-20 feet off of the bottom in deep water. Use a depth finder and find the deep holes, 60-100 feet or so. Just be ready to keep them because they all seem to die when you bring them up from that depth. They might swim away but on the next trolling pass or two, they'd be belly up. We quit fishing for them because we didn't like eating that many.Good luck. Those clear lakes seem tougher to fish than the tea colored waters."

That hole was between 60 and 75 feet deep if I remember correctly. Troll around until you see hooks on the locator. Then we fished vertical for the trout."
