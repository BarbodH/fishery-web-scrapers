523573,Guest,2002-08-22 19:49:00,0,just came back yesterday for 3 days. The wind was really strong for 2 days so we did'nt fish some of the spots we hoped for. From what I've been told fishing has slowed quite a bit. Minnows worked the best. Water temps avg. 64 degree's. most were caught deeper than 24'.
