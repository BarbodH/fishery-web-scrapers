523751,Guest,2002-08-25 14:41:00,0,Has anybody out there travelled north off of Hwy 560 on the logging road that passes by Bigfour Lake and Upper Grassy Lake towards Halliday Lake and/or the Matachewan Road? I'm going to try it next weekend and would appreciate an update. Last year I managed to navigate it in my car by taking it slow - has the road deteriorated or is it in the same condition as last year?Thanks.Canoehead

I've went back that way 4-5 times in last 10-12 years and never seen it get ANY better. I can't see Ontario spending any money for upkeep unless someone is logging that way - and it didn't look like it. Had to rate as one of he top 5 WORST - roughest - roads I've been on - had a trail in Colorado top it last year and WAY back on Beauty Lake road several years ago was BAD.I'd hat to try it in a car - but have seen them and motor homes back there.Three years ago was mt last time back that way. I went to the split towards Gogama and then turned east - ended upon some snowmobile trails that finally petered out. Was just ""sight seeing"" Had GPS - laptop, computer maps and paper maps and still almost got lost.Might try the Ontario Board - http://ontariofishing.net/ Seems to be a lot of Shinning tree fisherpeople on that board.FWIW - just where do you fish up that way?"
523753,Guest,2002-08-26 06:15:00,0,I am probably insane but I have been on many a bad backroad. I am originally from that area and I would take the car back there. Unfortunately if it is raining you will be in trouble. Rent or borrow a half ton and you will be fine. You can get one in New Liskeard or Sudbury.

Been going to Gowganda area for almost 20 years. 4 of us took a K-car back to Tyranite Gold mine about 10-12 years ago - before they briefly re-opened it. I don't think one would get a car ""stuck"" on many of them - even the few year old logging roads. Just might have to stop and pick up parts that fall off. lol I know I have been constantly suprised at what vehicles I hace seen in / on different roads/trails."
