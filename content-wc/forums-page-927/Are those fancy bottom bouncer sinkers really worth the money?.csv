523372,Larry,2002-08-15 12:53:00,357,"ok guys. thanks for all your help. looks like the verdict is in for me. i'm opting for the 12"" wires with lead weights. also want them to be the slider or lite bite kind, with or without the quick change options. sounds like if you fish them right they will last a good long while. did i forget anything?"
523373,Guest,2002-08-15 17:28:00,0,"I have found a very effective way to fish with out the bouncers. Works about the same. For years I have been using a 3 way swivel, the snell on one, the line on one and about a foot or so of mono on the other. On the one I use a lindy sinker, what ever weight that is appropreate. I slide the sinker on, pinch a small split shot on the end of the mono to hold the sinker. I also like to use enough weight to keep the line at 45 deg. or less. Once I find bottom, I also lift the sinker and only let it touch bottom now and then. Keeping it out of the snags. Should it get hung up, by pulling on it, the split shot slipps off of the dropper line and you are free. At least that's how it works most of the time. :)"

523362,Guest,2002-08-09 17:50:00,0,"I see a lot of relatively expensive bottom bouncer sinker gizmos that are supposed to work in keeping you out of snags. I have always just used slip sinkers and splitshots. I do lose a lot of lindy rigs this way though. If anyone has experience and suggestions, I would appreciate it."
523363,tracker,2002-08-09 18:25:00,91,"I don't think the Lindy ones which sell for 4-5 dollars are worth it. I use the metal wire one which is about a foot long with a lead weight on it. It sells up here for about $1.25 and I am using it a lot. Check out this site, http://www.justfishontario.com/disc54_toc.htm , there is quite a few posts about the bottom bouncer which I found informative."
523364,Larry L,2002-08-09 21:57:00,335,I would have to agree with tracker. The wire ones with the weights on them work great for me. You can get them in many different weights. The slip sinker and split shot works unless there are a lot snags. Then I lose a lot of them. I have even worse luck with the Lindy no-snag rigs. Others on this board seem to be very happy with them though. I have never fished with anyone else that has used them. Good luck.
523365,tracker,2002-08-10 13:11:00,91,I should have also mentioned that all the Lindy no-snag bouncers are snagged somewhere in a few of my `favorite lakes.
523366,Guest,2002-08-10 13:32:00,0,thanks for the info guys. that's what i like about this board; everyone seems willing to share info and advice. lcw
523367,szopster,2002-08-10 20:47:00,48,"I have several 1 ounce Lindy no snag weights that I have been using for over two years. I use them on a three way when faced with real snaggy situations. As long as you have your leader with lower pound test than your main line, these will be very hard to lose, even if you are anchored and can't move to the snag."
523368,WCoyote,2002-08-11 12:40:00,200,"If you get to South Dakota, I have always used the plain jane versions sold in most bait shops near any of the resivors. They don't cost an arm and a leg and they work just fine.wea"
523369,Guest,2002-08-12 17:35:00,0,"Phil Rolfe who has the site http://www.justfishontario.com and has many good writings on bouncing on the site. I fished with him some years ago and the guy knows bouncing inside and out. He always used Lite Bite bouncers cause they rode on a clevis which let the line slide through it. He liked them cause you could change very quickly as well without changing the snell. Anyway on snags up in Canada which is very rocky, he used to go down and find the bottom with his line at a 45 degree angle. Once contact with was made, he would lift his rod up a foot and then bounce the bottom to a cadence as he used to call it. After going a few feet he would loose bottom again and refind it, then raise his rod up a foot. On the Woods he used thirty inch snells and hard to believe, but the guy would never get snagged and he would never loose a snell, they would wear out. So I have used his method since, and I never get snagged either. So if you do it right, and keep the weight a foot off the bottom and then just bounce it you won't snag either. He felt those fancy bouncers were a product of marketing by the tackle companies and really not needed."
523370,tracker,2002-08-13 06:10:00,91,"I read all of Phils articles and he put me back on bottom bouncers after I retired them with the helicopter lure, banjo minnow etc...I seem to outfish my partners at least 2-1 since I brought the bouncers out of storage."
523371,Guest,2002-08-13 16:39:00,0,Phil put me on bouncers as well and I out fish all my jigging buddies too by double most days. I find more spots cause I am moving quicker too. Phil always said keep it simple.
