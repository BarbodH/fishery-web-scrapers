Border laws prohibit bringing bait from home, , going Sept 11, thanks Usually we catch our own goldeye but its not a sure thing and need to be prepared."
523673,stewart,2002-08-22 09:57:00,100,"Just fished the Red a week ago, and we used frogs we picked ourselves. In late summer the frogs start to move towards the river. If you can find a grassy field near the river, such as a park, you can get a bunch. I just grabbed them by hand."

Heck, they even went after my minnow bait. Figured we caught at least 20, 4 or 5 over 30"". At night for frogs, they're hopping around every where at End of Main."
