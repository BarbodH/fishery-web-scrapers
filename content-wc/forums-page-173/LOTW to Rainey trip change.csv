5869738,Baseline,2017-11-24 05:30:00,3207,"The Canadian side of Rainy is more like the Morson/ Nestor Falls side of LOW than the US side. Fishing is good on both sides. The big difference is that fishing the US side means fishing big reef complexes on the large bays which are susceptible to wind. A 20 MPH wind, which isn't uncommon, on Seine and the other large bays can mean tough or dangerous conditions if the wind blows harder. The Canadian side has lots more choices of terrain and there are hiding places when the wind kicks up. The US side is much more crowded because most people are fishing the big reefs. The Canadian side provides a variety of spots including reefs, points, pinch points, and large weed beds. I've spent most of my time fishing the Swell and Redgut Bay areas, but the North Arm is a far larger section of Rainy. Maybe some of the guys on WC who fish the North Arm can chime in with some information."
5869922,steve.a,2017-11-24 11:29:00,274,I am used to hazards at LOTW but the far south side of Seine Bay looks like a pretty hazardous area from looking at a map. Is this the area west of Mackenzie island you are referring to when saying the reef fishing as crowded?
5870186,Baseline,2017-11-24 17:46:00,3207,"I can't remember exactly where McKenzie Island is and would have to pull my maps. While US Rainy has plenty of rocks it is well buoyed with navigational and rock markers and has lots of deep water so it isn't that hazardous to navigate. If you look east of Dryweed Island there are several reefs like Olson's that are located in the main lake and can attract a crowd of boats during prime time. If you look west of Dryweed and look down the center of the bay roughly along the US - CA border line there are several other reefs that attract the attention of fisherman. Be aware that these are very large reefs surrounded by deep water up to 120 feet. It won't be bumper boats, but sometimes if the bite is hot boats will start ganging up because the bite is not uniform across the entire reef. Another area I like to fish is the bay east of Brule Narrows down to Kettle Falls. Again there several large and smaller complexes running down the center of the lake toward Kettle Falls. This area is less crowded because it is a 16 mile run from the resorts to Brule and then even more miles from there if you keep heading east. It can also be a long grinding run back to the resort areas if the wind kicks up."
5870218,That Minnesota guy,2017-11-24 18:01:00,8293,"The run to the Brule and the back passage east towards Kettle Falls is where the term ""Gods country"" is meant to describe."
5870234,Baseline,2017-11-24 18:22:00,3207,YES!!! The back end of Bleak Bay is a place I could park the boat and stay forever.
5870610,steve.a,2017-11-25 08:29:00,274,I looked on Rainy lake houseboats website and they say that on the Canada side of Rainy that no live minnows are allowed and that the daily limit for walleyes is 1 per day. Is this a misprint? One of our party has done the houseboat thing in the past but it has been 20 years since. He said that they used to go to Cormorant Bay then. On the map it looks to be a 30 mile trip from the docks. It sounds like to do the houseboat thing it would be a pain to stay on the Canada side when renting from the US side. Any thoughts on this?
5871322,Baseline,2017-11-25 22:00:00,3207,That is not a misprint. You cannot bring US minnows into Canada. Crawlers and leeches are OK. The limit is 1 walleye up to 17 inches per day.
5861794,steve.a,2017-11-17 13:42:00,274,We have been fishing on LOTW from Nestor Falls area for 20 years and some in our group wants to go to Rainey Lake. They used to fish there before going to LOTW but it has been 20 years ago. One says that he really liked it there as well as LOTW and knows the area we would go to. My thought is that in 20 years there would be quite a change in the fishing as there has been changes to LOTW due to loss of a lot of weed lines etc. I have got to the place where I can go from spot to spot to find fish at LOTW without a lot of searching and would be starting all over again. Any thoughts?
5861866,walleye22,2017-11-17 14:40:00,59,fished rainy a few times...huge lake. can be a tough go with weather and where the fish are. obvioulsy a great lake but it is a huge lake. on a personal side...fishing rainy does not give me the true canadian fishing trip experience. just me though.
5862058,That Minnesota guy,2017-11-17 17:17:00,8293,If you are going just for the fish stay at LOTW. If you are going for the experience and exploring go to Rainy.
5863170,Thompmd,2017-11-18 11:49:00,320,Interesting because that really describes us. We fished in Nestor Falls as well for about 10yrs(Rainy was always in the back of our mind). Last 2-3yrs we went to different parts of LOTW(Crow Rock then Ash Rapids) and were ready to try Rainy. Couldn't get in where/when we wanted to we just couldn't pull the trigger to go to Rainy. We made reservations a couple weeks ago for LOTW in 2018. I spoke to 2-3 people about Rainy vs LOTW and even Jeff Gustafson said BOTH are great(he said he is biased because he lives on LOTW) but said he thought Rainy was a better bass lake. I just couldn't change.I move around some and having fished all over LOTW and I can say IMO that the fishing has been equally as good for me all over LOTW.All of that being said if the right situation came along to go to Rainy I would give it a shot. Good Luck
5866474,steve.a,2017-11-21 06:31:00,274,Thanks for the info. We have been staying at a private cabin for years and is looks like it will be sold soon as they are waiting for the closing. As for cabins in the Morson or Nestor Falls area when do they fill up for the middle of June?
5866962,Baseline,2017-11-21 14:16:00,3207,"I've been fishing Rainy for 35 years. Mid June is an excellent time to fish Canadian Rainy. Walleye fishing in mid June is excellent and you also have some of the best SMB fishing in the country. I usually fish the Swell Bay, Seine Bay, Baseline Bay, Red Gut Bay, Porters Inlet, and on up to Crooked and Spawn Narrows. Porters Inlet has some great crappie fishing in mid-June as a bonus. Places to stay would be The Landings located in Red Gut, Taylors Cove, Coppens and The Fisheries are located on Bears Passage which runs between Swell Bay and Baseline Bay. Give it a try as it is an excellent fishery."
5868474,steve.a,2017-11-22 15:16:00,274,If we stayed on the US side of Rainy Lake and had Canada licences can we use minnows bought on the US side?
5868674,The tank,2017-11-22 18:00:00,340,no you have to buy them in canada and have proof of wear you bought them.
5868970,Baseline,2017-11-23 05:51:00,3207,Minnows have to be bought in Canada. Most of the resorts in Canada that I know of in the Bear Passage and Red Gut area do not sell minnows. Then you have to get a remote border permit. Then you have to deal with fish limit differences. I've done US to CA waters thing a few times and it is a PITA unless you are using cranks or other artificial baits. Personally I like the resorts on the Canadian side much better than the resorts on the US side. I also like the access to fishing waters without the long boat ride across Seine Bay which can blow up big time with a 20 MPH plus wind. There are more and more people renting their personal cabins on both sides of the border.
5869194,steve.a,2017-11-23 08:30:00,274,It sounds like the Canada side of Rainy is better fishing than the US side or is it just personal preference. As for prices of cabins are they about the same?
