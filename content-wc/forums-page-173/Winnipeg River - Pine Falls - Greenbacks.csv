5805769,Guest,2017-10-10 10:37:00,0,"Thought the rules said 0nly one over 55 cm at any one time , did they come out and say only 1 fish over 55cm will be weighed per day. This has always been a little grey area . Because some of the weights in the past would suggest other wise."
5807929,brycer,2017-10-11 18:46:00,181,2 fish over 22 were allowed per day. That's a for sure
5820985,Balzy,2017-10-19 09:24:00,76,"We were up last week and the water flow was low, cold front and 30 mph. wind didn't bode well for our fishing. 28"" Greenback was the biggest and most of our fish were we're under 17"". Last year wit 2 boats & 4 fisherman we caught 320 fish with most of them being between 16"" - 25""! Fun but we didn't catch any big ones between 27"" - 31"" where were they? That's fishing!"
5826169,Hawgeye,2017-10-23 03:10:00,1355,"Fished Traverse and Winnipeg River for 2 1/2 days. Numbers, size and flow were down. We caught around 25 fish per day with 28"" topping our catch. Mostly jigged in the bay by Robinson Rock and the old channel. I am afraid this may be my last trip for awhile...after 27 years of fall fishing heaven, I am afraid the commercial netting has finally impacted the fishery to a point of recovery time. I am no biologist but.i have seen what it has done to Red Lake, LOW and Mille Lacs......although LW is much larger, I am convinced this is what has had the largest negative impact to that system. If the conservation department doesn't step in, the tourism will be taking a big hit this time of year. I guess all good things come to an end. Skinny greenbacks, low volume of large fish and nets galore. Thanks for all the great memories!"
