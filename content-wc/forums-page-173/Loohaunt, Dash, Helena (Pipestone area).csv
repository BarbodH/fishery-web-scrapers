Can anybody give me any info on any of the following lakes:DashHelenaLoonhauntI would be mostly interested in lake trout and northern pike on these portage lakes, but I don't have a ton of info on them.I hear Loonhaunt is a pretty good multi-species lake, including walleye and musky. Dash and Helena appear to be more limited to trout and pike, but my info on these lakes is limited.If anybody here could share some info any of these three lakes, it would be much appreciated.Thanks!""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"

Post up a report when you get back! Slender is on the list for us to fish in the future. The new cabin looks nice too."
