5864306,Fishingframes,2017-11-19 08:45:00,33,"We used guide Patrick Therrien. Awesome guy, super cool. Very professional and his English is good. If you go, he's the guy you want. He's been featured in some of the outdoor shows and just knows his stuff. Don't be off-put by his French website - I don't speak a lick of French, email or call him. http://www.guidepatricktherrien.com/en/"
