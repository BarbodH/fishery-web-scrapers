5879754,clegg,2017-12-01 08:14:00,38,We want to get away from everyone and everything for our fishing trip. We usually go to Tamarac in the Gouin area but unfortunately we can't make it up there this year. We're looking for a drive in spot that has secluded cabins with some good fishing near the Gouin area. Would anyone be able to suggest a spot?
