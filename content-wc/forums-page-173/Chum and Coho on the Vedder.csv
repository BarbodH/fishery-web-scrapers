This is my first year really starting to get into river fishing for salmon. The prior two years I had pretty dismal success. This year things are starting to make sense and I'm catching the odd Salmon. I've been using the Piscifun Reels including the Honor Spinning reel and the Torrent Baitcaster. The Torrent is mounted on a 9 foot Diawa float rod that I have spooled with 20 pound Power Pro braided line. Today the guys fishing around me were catching salmon floating roe, but I didn't have any. So I tied on a pink Bent Rods Jig below the float and the action started quick with a nice male chum and then soon after a great wild Coho salmon.I hope you enjoy the vid.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo5f2vnWS_A"
