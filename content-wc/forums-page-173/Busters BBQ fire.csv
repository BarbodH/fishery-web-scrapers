5190394,deadhead1,2016-11-08 11:10:00,193,on news today was that fire marshal has declared fire as accidental and electrical source. Owners were away in Toronto when it happened.
5190442,wallydave,2016-11-08 12:19:00,2151,Thanks for the update! Depending on the results of the election I might be looking for a job up North!
5192178,Guest,2016-11-10 12:46:00,0,See how WalleyeDave slid a political comment in on this thread.
5192458,wallydave,2016-11-10 20:02:00,2151,I would never do such a thing!

5193049,HeHooksHimself,2016-11-11 11:40:00,725,"It looks like you might find a job in California since a bunch of Hollywood elites promised to leave if this happened, most of them to Canada. What they are finding out is Canada has immigration laws in place and it isn't so easy. Ha ha"
5193202,v-bay gord,2016-11-11 15:40:00,3168,They were tearing down the burnt out section today. Phase one?
5193250,wallydave,2016-11-11 17:17:00,2151,Good to hear Gord. Thanks for the update!
5178553,Skywagon,2016-11-01 05:56:00,1106,"Busters BBQ in Vermillion Bay just burned http://www.ckdr.net/news/2049723870/...sters-barbeque Always a good place to stop on the way home in the summer after a days fishing on Lac Seul. It will be missed by many, hopefully they will rebuild."
5178705,pjshorthorn,2016-11-01 06:37:00,5654,This is not good. This is not good at all........ This was a great joint to grab a decent meal along the way for many years. I sure hope they rebuild. It seems like Vermilion Bay businesses have had their share of devastating fires over the last number of years. Sioux Lookout businesses have had similar trials and tribulations recently too. PjShorthorn.
5178713,jimirjr,2016-11-01 06:44:00,1149,What is going on with all these fires destroying these establishments? You wonder what actually caused these disasters... ??
5180241,wallydave,2016-11-01 19:53:00,2151,"thats bad news! One of the highlights of a trip through V Bay, was stopping for some good Q! We always did some Christmas shopping, blueberry BBQ sauce always made for a good stockinng stuffer! i hope they rebuild!"
5180289,That Minnesota guy,2016-11-01 20:18:00,8293,"I don't know and I'm not accusing anybody of anything. Having been in the restaurant equipment business for nearly 30 years it's usually grease that does it. If business is slow maintenance is one of the first places they cut back. Because of that you get a grease build up in the vent hood, duct work & especially the roof top power vent. Get a flare up on your grill and you get a flash fire and next thing you know the fire trucks are coming. I currently work for a auctioneer who when we are selling fire extinguishers will stop and say.....""now, if you want a successful fire, don't bid."" that always draws a laugh but there is a lot of truth in the statement. The first thing people think when a business burns is the owner burned it for the insurance check. I have found that to be untrue. It's really, really hard to burn a business and get away with it. These state fire marshals are sharp people. Doesn't take them long to determine the origin of a fire. Add to that insurance companies ALWAYS suspect arson with business, collecting can take a long, long time."
5180409,v-bay gord,2016-11-01 21:24:00,3168,"Power was either off or at a low voltage for 5 hours in Vermilion Bay that day. I turned my main breaker off since the low voltage was causing pumps and other equipment to not run properly. Buster's was closed for the winter, and nobody was there to check on things. I know I was worried about potential electrical issues causing damage. Things can go from bad to worse....... I hope they are able to rebuild."
5180441,Jesse-WI,2016-11-01 21:42:00,534,Crap!!
5180529,Pooch,2016-11-02 03:16:00,4618,"Forty years in the fire service and my vote is the same. Voltage spikes and brownouts are killers. Untended building? Old and or home spun wiring? Poor or corroded connections? Rodents? Thousands of things. Owners selling to insurance companies? Not like it used to be fifty years ago. Pretty hard to get away with arson, unless you are a professional.It's not that hard to determine if a fire was set or not. Proving it is another story.It does seem like there have been a lot of fires the past couple years in towns. Many seem to be eateries and most seem to never reopen. Pity....Pooch"
5181705,Fisherman Ted,2016-11-02 10:19:00,461,"We just brought our kitchen up to date fire protection wise. Was built 75 years ago and needed to be done. Fire marshal was nice to give us some time as in the bush you don't just walk down to Walmart and get a hood with fire suppression. New hood, duct work and special vent on the roof with 3 layers of fire suppression. Once it senses a flare-up the fire suppression hits the stoves and all duct work plus kills all power and gas to the ovens etc. Nearly 30 grand to bring all up to code but worth every penny. One grease fire and goodbye lodge...... -FT"
5189273,wallydave,2016-11-07 14:05:00,2151,Any news on the Busters rebuild? I imagine it would be hard to build a new place when you have a short season to make enough to carry you through the winter.
