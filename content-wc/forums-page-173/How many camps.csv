5868442,Pooch,2017-11-22 14:27:00,4618,"How many camps on lakes that do not have any kind of slot limits actually encourage their guest to be mindful of the future as far as resource conservation? Maybe even limiting the size of fish harvested within their camps?I've been thinking about this after fishing the same system several times a year since the mid 1990's and seeing what I perceive as a definite decline in fish size. The lake I speak of has no specific slots or different limits than the generic MNR limits.I'm using Lac Seul as a barometer in my judging the decline I see. Lac Seul has been getting better each season I fish it. And I have to believe that the rigid rules and slots are working well.I'm certainly no biologist nor fisheries manager, but I can see with my own eyes what is happening and yes I know that each season and year class are different, but a trend is a trend.I know this has been hashed and rehashed over the years, but it's still seems to be a unspoken conversation in the making. IMHO.I'd like to know what camp owners think and their thoughts. They are far more closely connected to the pulse of this Canadian resource than myself.Just for back ground, I usually spend thirty days a year on the water in Ontario so I'm not new to this fishing thingy. So please suppress the urge to bash me for being observant.Pooch"
5868490,BornToFish,2017-11-22 15:19:00,1224,"Greetings,Pooch, you raised a very interesting topic. I firmly believe that ""slots"" work- be they mandated by law or voluntarily put into place by lodge owners. Please let me elaborate. I fished a particular lake in NW Ontario for about fifteen years. I began fishing this lake for one week per season, then eventually ramped it up to about six or seven weeks per season. Walleye fishing on this particular lake hit rock bottom in 2003. The concerns were recognized by guests, guides and lodge owners.One of the lodge owners recognized the problem and put a ""slot"" into place for guests fishing from his lodge. The ""slot"" was that all walleyes be returned to the lake if 18 inches or longer. The only ""over"" fish that were permitted were those fish intended to be mounted. Of course, replicas were encouraged.This lodge owner encouraged other lodges on the water system to follow suit. They all said they would. As you might expect, some lodges were passive in the enforcement of the ""slot"", while others were quite active in this respect.The walleye fishing hit its stride again in about 2007. Now, the lake boasts a rather impressive walleye fishery.I must admit that it was hard for my wife and I the first few years of the ""slot"". After all, it took a lot of hard work and luck to catch those ""slot"" fish. Now, we just admire the nice walleyes and focus on catching even more of them.My wife and I are now fishing from another lodge that is the only lodge on another lake (not the same lake as referenced above). This lake has had a voluntary ""slot"" for about thirty years. It boasts an exceptional walleye fishery. ""Slot"" walleyes are commonplace on this lake. The average length of our walleyes the last two seasons was likely around nineteen inches.Again, I firmly believe that ""slots"" work!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5868578,RickOnt,2017-11-22 16:56:00,217,"Mattice Lake Outfitters has some of their camps designated ""Catch and Consume Only""Not really a slot but does limit the number of Fish harvested"
5868594,gullrockguy,2017-11-22 17:18:00,44,"our lake has had self imposed slot size fishing limits mandated by the mnr like all (most) of the lakes in our fishing zone (4) . that you are allowed to keep one fishover 18.1 inches in the walleye category. a number of years ago the camp owners decided to make it a policy in their camps that no fishover that slot size would be allowed in their camps. the local residents (not camp owners) on our lake have also joined in the practice of releasing all fish over the size limit. the fishing has been nothing short of amazing year after year it gets better. It requires a commitment from all the anglers using the resource to make size limits work, and unfortunately a lot of locals from further up the water system come into our lake and don't respect the releasing of the big fish."
5868978,BornToFish,2017-11-23 05:53:00,1224,"Greetings,I've been further pondering this thread about ""slots"" on walleyes. It seems that there are others that see the importance of ""slots"" in the same way that I do.I'm sure there are fisheries in Ontario that can sustain good populations of ""quality"" walleyes in spite of pressure on the walleye population due to angling pressure. For example, there might be a fabulous fishery that has only one relatively small fishing lodge on the body of water.However, on many lakes there might be multiple fishing lodges of fairly good size. On these bodies of water, there may very well be quite a few boats on the lake each week of the season. If they haven't already seen it, these lakes might one day find their walleye populations in trouble. I'm pretty sure that is what happened to the first lake in my previous post.If or when this happens to a lake, I suspect the lodge owners may find themselves thinking they should have self-imposed ""slots"" years ago (assuming they haven't yet done so) for anglers fishing from their lodge.This concept reminds me to the old question: when is the best time to plant a tree for your yard? The answer is twenty years ago.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5869050,Bill Krejca,2017-11-23 06:34:00,6107,"Both camps that I am presently going to have a preferred size limit, which I feel is a good thing. Posting at one of the camps is more aggressively communicated than the other. I definitely think it can make a difference in available good size fish available. (Netting surely, in my opinion, can be very detrimental in that it targets the larger fish. I realize this is somewhat off subject, but can really degrade the population.) Bill"
5869370,papadave,2017-11-23 10:44:00,151,"One of the lodge owners (Ken Byberg at Island 10) realized he needed to do something that would help his business. So he started a unique program which has now spread to the other lodges. At Island 10 if you release a walleye over 18"" you just write your name and measurement on a list. At the end of the season Ken has a drawing for a free week long trip for two people. The first year he had only about 20 entries which is a pretty good indication the lake was in deep trouble. Ken also lobbied the Ministry to lower limits. Now the four lodges on that lake get thousands of release entries each year and that 18""+ release number keeps growing substantially every year. Ken's forward thinking pretty much saved that lake. If you give good anglers an incentive to release their fish they will do it because they realize allowing those average size fish to mature into trophies is good for everyone. I can only speak for myself but I would rather fish in a lake where I have an opportunity to catch a trophy rather than catch of hundreds of smaller fish."

5869578,spurs101,2017-11-23 17:52:00,635,"Our group had self imposed slots back in the 80's. Anything over 21 went back. The camp imposed the same slot a few years latter with a new owner who was a forward thinker. The camp was sold 8 years ago and the slot went to 19. The lake had always been a walleye factory but the slots definitely made it into a trophy lake. On a few of our local lakes, our fish committee working with the DNR, we able to change the slots and limits to allow a greater number to reach spawning maturity. Hopefully we see greater numbers but I still want to pursue an ""anything over"" is returned. Most of the walleye fisherman I know release anything over 24 but their are still plenty that don't. Some just don't get it or could care less."
5872234,Fisherman Ted,2017-11-26 19:53:00,461,I fished Hawk Lake for 10 years back in the early 2000s and rarely saw a 30 inch walleye. When I bought it 8 years ago we immediately went to 100% catch and release. The result is that the trophy population has exploded. I track all trophy numbers each year in every class over 25 inches and its crystal clear the policy has produced exactly as was intended.
5872506,MrSimon,2017-11-27 07:03:00,922,"I'm a HUGE fan of size limits and slots!!! But I think lowering creel limits is just as important. Maybe more important. Even good healthy lakes will struggle to support massive harvesting of eater size walleye. Restrictions in Canada seem to be headed in the right direction. Slower than I'd like, but at least it's getting better. It's also a sad truth, but the ""freezer-filler"" generation of fishermen are getting older. The newer generation of fishermen seem to have a more conservative attitude toward the resource. That's a good thing."
5874049,billy weaver,2017-11-27 20:24:00,470,Been fishing the same Canadian lake for over 30 years. The fishing has steadily improved. I think it has to do with limits and the fisherman's willingness to release the bigger fish. We make it a point to fish a small hike-in lake that is catch and release. It has been catch and release all the time we have been going to Canada and fish it at least for one day. If we don't catch at least 100 fish per boat of 18 to 22 inch walleye it is a slow day. Fishing this catch and release lake is the high-lite of my trip.
5874561,Hwy 101,2017-11-28 09:10:00,33,"There seem to be more camps that are putting restrictions on harvest and self imposed slot sizes. When I was younger we would do a trip with a group of 10-15 guys. It's embarrassing to talk about it 30 years later but the main focus of the trip was to harvest fish. The last few days of the week they would make sure everyone had their limit of everything. Pike, walleye bass and perch were all fair game. Even the muskie weren't safe. The fish cleaning station was the social center of camp. My dad and I split off from the group and fished a lake that encouraged catch and release. We only killed small fish for lunch with no take home fish. The results were astounding in many ways. Numbers and size that we had never seen at our old camp, and the fun of fishing just to fish. Lost one ? Who cares, I know I will get another bite in a few minutes. Now when I am looking over web-sites or walking through a sportshow in the winter I have a hard time even considering a destination that show cases fish on stringers. Are there financial benifits to the camps to encourage C&R, or is fish harvest an economic necessity to keep customer?"
5875777,jackpotjohnny48,2017-11-28 21:47:00,153,"I agree with this last part. When I view a website for a lodge in NW Ontario, I am generally turned off when I see stringers full of walleye. I just looked at a site today, and I was thinking ""Wow, you must have kept EVERY single fish that you caught."" There were 32 inch pike on the stringer. There were 18 inch pike on the stringer. There were 8 inch smallmouth on the stringer. There were 21 inch smallmouth on the stringer. And the stringer was loaded with a limit full of walleyes, too - of all sizes.Also saw photos of fin-damaged fish and vertical holds on the pike, along with pics of 35-inch pike flopping on the bottom of a boat in a net that was 5 times too small.And all I could think was ""No thank you. I'm not interested in going here.""It seems to me that there's a very clear distinction between the lodges that are catering to the ""freezer fillers"" vs the catch-photo-release crowd.I liken it to the difference between a public golf course and a private country club. There are some places where you can play golf in a pair of ripped blue jeans while wearing a ""wife beater"" tank top. And there's other places that require you to wear khaki pants and a button polo.The golf courses with the dress codes tend to be in better shape. (Because the people in the polo shirts tend to replace their divits and they don't drive the cart over the putting green).And it seems to be the same way with fishing....I am definitely FAR more attracted to the lodges that put strict slot limits (or catch-and-release only) limits on their fish.The lodge I'm heading to this summer not only encourages release of all walleye over 18, but the camp owner also furnishes each guest with a cradle free of charge, and requests that all larger fish (pike and muskies) be landed in this manner.That's a nice touch, and it shows that he is concerned with the long term future of the fishery."
5876145,MrSimon,2017-11-29 06:59:00,922,"I am also a big fan of supporting camps who take C&R seriously. Pictures on websites don't always tell the whole story, but they sure do give you an idea of the mindset of who posted the pics. I try not to be a C&R snob and not think less of the freezer-fillers. But I usually fail. It just makes me angry to see so many fish killed and a fishery damaged. I'm not sure what to do about it, but I'm certainly raising my kids to have a conservationist mindset. Even my 3 year old says ""they should throw it back"" when we watch fishing on TV."
5878001,prov1800,2017-11-30 06:34:00,5010,"totally agree with the comments above.Slot sizes and limits seem to working.As far as iam concerned they could just limit all fish under 18 inches and be done with it.Eagle and Lac suel both have slot limits and are both different in size.As someone mentioned though about the pressure on these under 18ninch fish is incredible,that would be a understatement.On most lakes with heavy pressure these fish are hard to come up with.Personally I would rather eat a 15 "" walleye anyday.Nowadays the fall season seems to be busier also than ever and with the electronics of course fish are easier to find in the deep water.besides people keeping there limits this deep water fishing probably kills more fish than anything else without even knowing your killing them.Everybody has a excuse how they bring them up slow and they swim off and makes you feel good.so all the conservation your doing just got blown out the window.i see guys fishing in 50 ft of water and just shake my head.Even some guides who want to show there guests a great day of fishing do it.Then there the huge shorelunches which I have been on where we will fillet 50-100 walleyes some days or 2-3 days in a row.its a nasty world out there.A lot of fisherman do have conservation licences and wont take fish home but will eat 12 fish each during there week up.So fish populations do have a hard time catching up after a season of fishing.There needs to more emphasis put on education.August and Sept are probably the worst two momths on our fish populations if some of that deep fishing would stop there would be a huge survival rate.i do not fish much deeper than 20-25 ft in the fall and still catch plenty of fish and seems the deeper you you go a lot of fish are smaller.thats just my 2 cents."
5878073,v-bay gord,2017-11-30 06:58:00,3168,"I agree. For the past few years, during a particular week in September, I can look out my window and see two boats (two in particular, a camp boat and a private boat) fishing in 50 plus feet of water. They do this everyday. The damage they are doing basically is nullifying the efforts of 30 other anglers. Perhaps I will have a conversation with them this coming fall....."
5878121,MrSimon,2017-11-30 07:12:00,922,"I've caught exactly one walleye in my entire life from 50+ water. It's eyes were literally bulging out of its head. Sticking a full half inch out of its skull! Crazy looking. I was shocked and complained to the guide. He shrugged and said, ""Ah, throw him back head first and he'll be fine"". After that, 30' is the absolute limit I'll fish."
5879146,Skywagon,2017-11-30 17:33:00,1106,"Think of all the fish that would be saved if no fish were allowed to cross the border (how many of those end up freezer burned). I get the impression that many on this board do not take any home, only eating what they catch in Canada (good for them), but there are a few that think it is their God given right to take as many of the largest fish legally allowed, maybe a surcharge for those fish taken across the border is in order. Just my thought."
5879218,BornToFish,2017-11-30 18:07:00,1224,"Greetings,My wife and I generally took four walleyes home with us after each of our trips. This pretty much stopped about three years ago. We switched to a lodge that offered two or three shore lunches each week. These lunches satisfied our need for more fish to eat.I sometimes take home two or three walleyes on my trips without my wife so that I can make her a nice meal when I return home. As someone already pointed out, I too suspect that a fair number of walleyes end up freezer burned. I found that purchasing $20 in dry ice to take my fish fillets home sort of put things in perspective. Now, it's pretty much catch, admire the fish, return it to the lake unharmed and focus on catching another.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5883154,MrSimon,2017-12-04 08:11:00,922,"I hired a guide on Lake Erie once to see what all the hype was about. We had a ball catching tons of huge walleye. He absolutely would NOT throw anything back, so we kept his and my limits. 12 big eyes. I had to pay to have them cleaned and then had to buy a cooler to haul it all home. Three years later every single fillet is still in my freezer, untouched and probably wasted. I don't feel too bad since Erie is such a special case .... but I bet the same thing happens to Canadian eyes all the time. It's a shame."
5883322,Ricky Spanish,2017-12-04 10:24:00,1298,"I'd love to see a Capt. or guide make me keep a limit, pay to clean them, or buy a cooler to transport. If I don't want them, they can ask me to gift my limit, if that is legal, but they aren't going to decide for me. Throw those fillets out. I don't even think a cat will eat them now."
5878770,prov1800,2017-11-30 12:36:00,5010,"I have talked to fisherman about it and basically they all serm to have a degree in fish biology.iam on the water a lot and have enough experience to take my guest to places where i can catch fish in 20 or less at that time of the year and those fish are always larger than the deep fish which are always 10-12"" anyways.my guests (most )appreciate that i explain why iam not fishing deeper.camp owners need to tell there guests about it and there guides.as was mentioned all the conservation throughout the season gets ruined in the deep water season.plus some of these guts fishing deep like that catch muskies to on there walleye gear.1/2 hr or more later they bring to the surface do what ever and throw it back thinkbit will survive.doubt it."
5869722,Baseline,2017-11-24 05:16:00,3207,"I fish on the English River system at Separation Lake. They have a camp size limit of nothing over 18 inches. The system is full of larger fish that are regularly caught. They make no secret of their rule and it is listed in their brochures and they disclose it when you make a reservation. There is public access to the lake system, but it is so far away from any population center that there is very little drive in traffic. I've been fishing their lakes for over 30 years and the catch and size rate seems to be holding up. Over the years we have had trips when the majority of fish were on the small size where most of the fish caught were 10 to 14 inches. Those trips have been few and fall between. I've seen the same pattern on LOW and Rainy. When that happens I think that those little guys school up and feed so heavily the bigger fish leave the area."
