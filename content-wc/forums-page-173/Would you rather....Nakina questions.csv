North Caribou is an amazing lake with so much varied structure to fish. Definitely a place I'd love to go every year, and for me, that says a lot.Hearst Air has some amazing camps as well. The camps on the Attawapiskat, Pym and Canada, are known for their trophy pike and walleye. A guide is probably best though. I really enjoyed our trip to Napken last May. Was an interesting lake with lots of river to explore, but that of course will vary depending on the time of year. Landed some really nice trophy pike, but we worked for them. Walleye fishing was fairly easy near the neck downs with current.I suggest you browse through the other trip reports from Mike Borger. I'd encourage you to call him for some recommendations as well - best free advice you'll get! http://www.canadafishingguide.net/reports/fly-in-trips/http://www.canadafishingguide.net/contact/"
5881738,andreindy,2017-12-02 18:49:00,308,"Just an update on my original post: I booked on Abamasagi with Twin Lakes Outfitters for July 14-21st. There were pros and cons for all the places I looked at (and time running out to book). Honestly though, it felt like trying to choose the prettiest gal out of a room of supermodels. Weight lifted. One of the best parts? We are asking our 15 year old nephew to come....doesn't have a Dad and few male role models. We were thinking of breaking him the news with a wrapped Rapala under the tree and inside the lure box having a ""Redeem for One Canadian Fishing Vacation"" voucher...."

5883362,onetimedave,2017-12-04 11:12:00,502,What a great Christmas gift Things like what you are doing don't happen that often.
5872570,MrSimon,2017-11-27 07:28:00,922,"If you are taking inexperienced fishermen to Canada, and catching numbers is important, then I highly recommend a small lake. Hands down the most important aspect of catching fish on big Canadian shield lakes is FINDING the fish. It's not always easy, and sometimes downright frustrating. Smaller lakes are much easier to figure out and you can really rack up the numbers. I'd recommend a drive-to camp that has access to bush lakes. Bush lakes offer tremendous adventure and usually have superb fishing for medium sized fish, with a legit shot at a trophy. Most outfitters will have boats stashed on these lakes and will give you small outboards to take with you for the day. There are limitless bush lakes in and around Nakina, and almost all of the camps and outfitters know them .... but they don't advertise on their websites. Call around and see what they can put together for you. For new folks, the adventure of driving/hiking back into some remote bush lake and catching 50 pike between 24"" and 32"" is a memory they'll never forget."
5873129,gordy28,2017-11-27 11:47:00,437,"Based on my groups experiences I would think a smaller lake is easier to pattern and provide the numbers you desire We started on bigger lakes but via a lodge where we had either a lodge owner/dock crew pointing is in the right direction daily and other fisherman to chat with. We also employed a guide for the first day or two Our first fly in was to a smaller lake and we were blown away by numbers - even though we had various weather patterns there was only so many places the fish could go and we did very weel for us Last trip we went to a lake double the size - we did okay, better on size but certainly the numbers dropped (we had a bunch of front go through and never really found that communal ""hole"") and each day felt like we had to pattern again This year we are doing a much bigger lake but have really tried to up our pre scouting game to ideally help But - for first timers going for numbers I would think a smaller lake would be easier to get numbers (assuming the lake has a healthy population of walleye) Cheers Gordy"
5876009,Babamel2,2017-11-29 06:05:00,414,"One of the rules I had with my kids when we listened to music in the car went something like this (concerning the radio) ""You choose the station, I choose the volume, You choose the volume, I choose the station. Which knob do you want?"" It was 50 50 each one of us had a sense of control."
5876073,andreindy,2017-11-29 06:30:00,308,"I am going to try this. He will probably chuckle. It is probably a cliche and I need to stop doing it, but I like it when my son is ""pinned"" in the car with me. I use it as an opportunity to try to generate conversation, laughs, etc. Being 16 years old is tough...maybe his music is his excuse to avoid chats with the old man."
5877209,BuckRub,2017-11-29 16:13:00,3,"Hello everyoneFirst timer here with a question. At the moment I am communicating with 7 Lakes wildernesses camps about a trip next summer.My 72 year old father and my teenage daughter will be going. My dad and I are experienced fisherman as we have fished Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and the Kenora area for years. Last summer we booked a trip to echo lake out of Cochrane and it was a disappointment.My pops doesn't have too many of these trips left in front of him so I want to ensure that I choose a good lake for us. looking for monster pike and Walters Right now the outfitter is recommending Wayner Lake and Teabeau Lake OutpostsWe love seclusion and privacy. Has anyone fished either of these lakes?Thanks in advance for your feedback"
5877545,andreindy,2017-11-29 18:48:00,308,"These are all excellent points. While fly-ins seem to have such wonderful opportunities, I would bet there would/could be draw-backs for newcomers. Sort of like a house...it's great to have a big property with no neighbors UNTIL your wife and kids start telling you they miss having neighbors."
5877657,adempsey2.0,2017-11-29 19:59:00,612,Some info on Teabeau.http://www.canadafishingguide.net/fo...-teabeau-lake/http://www.canadafishingguide.net/fo...1/thanks-mike/http://www.canadafishingguide.net/fo...r-brook-trout/
5878089,MrSimon,2017-11-30 07:04:00,922,"I've spoken with the outfitter about his Marshall Lake outpost, and he is a good dude. He knows the area and is a straight shooter. With that said, the write-ups on their website might be juuuuust a little exaggerated. They describe Wayner as, ""Non Stop Walleyes action, Monster Northern Pike over 50"". I admit I haven't been there, but that's probably not the normal experience. Also, not sure if it matters, but their cabins are one room deals. Is your teenage daughter OK sleeping right next to her dad and grandfather? Maybe it's fine, but just something to consider. 7 Lakes is a good choice, but I can also highly recommend Hearst Air. They have plenty of lakes that will give you large numbers of pike and walleye, with very good size. Complete seclusion on your own remote lake. Their cabins also are quite large with separate bedrooms too. They don't have electricity or running water though."
5878978,BuckRub,2017-11-30 15:40:00,3,Thank you
5879002,BuckRub,2017-11-30 15:55:00,3,Hey thanks for the feedback. Yeah I was looking at the cabins and thinking the same thing. She would need some privacy. She comes deer hunting with us but she has her own room in our camper. I was looking at Hearst Air as well. I'll have another look. Any lake recommendations through Hearst? not set on any particular outfitter at the moment. Just trying to find a good lake for us to fish. Our trip this past summer to Echo Lake out of Cochrane was a bit of a disappointment. I would welcome all recommendations. Appreciate your feedback. Thanks
5867426,andreindy,2017-11-21 18:28:00,308,"First, would you rather wear sandpaper chaps or listen to your kid's music for a straight 3 hours in the car? Sorry, this just happened to me...and I wish I meant the chaps. I have some opportunities in July to bring my father, nephew, brother and cousin to Canada. They all will undoubtedly show adequate fishing enthusiasm (though not entirely sure about their tastes in music). They are all inexperienced fisherman. Frankly, my own on-the-water time probably registers me as inexperienced too...but at least I appreciate Neil Young. I am looking for folks who might have perspective on some of my options, keeping in mind that we are largely novice fisherman. I highly value the joy of discovery and figuring out the bite, but we might not be very good at deciphering complex bodies of water. Perch, plentiful small pike are a bonus for this group as any action is preferred over infrequent larger fish. Bonus points for lodge owners that start you off with directions, location suggestions and things that can decrease the learning curve. Hopefully that makes sense. Ogoki with Ogoki Lake Outfitters Abamasagi with Twin Lakes Outfitters Percy Lake with Nakina North Outfitters Onaman (North camp) with Bauer's Resort Thanks for thoughts or experiences. I have searched the threads and read older posts and appreciate all the wisdom you share, but thought I would try a post from the angle of a blind squirrel."
5867650,adempsey2.0,2017-11-21 21:18:00,612,"Are you set on an outpost?All those options listed are good ones from what I know. I've not been to any of those specific camps though. All those lakes have other camps on them. Ogoki is and Onaman are large bodies of water (17,500 and 28,000 acres). The benefit of that there are a lot places to explore, large variety of structure, great trophy fish potential and often more fish species to target. The downside, well, they are big and finding fish can be tougher at times....and big isn't always fun in a mediocre camp boat - although, those camps might have nice boats, I didn't look. Not that you have to go far to find great fishing, but you may have to.I think an ideal lake for the annual fisherman would be somewhere with some nice in-flowing water with rapids. Walleye will hold there all season long. Percy definitely has that at the west end where the Leuenberger camp is. Abamasagi is a well known walleye factory as well. A lot of impressive reports from this lake.A few more worth researching:Melchett - https://www.borealforestoutfitters.com/melchett-lakeLittle Missinaibi - http://outpostcamps.tumblr.com/Little%20MissinaibiGarnham - http://whiteriverair.com/south-garnham/Nameigos - http://whiteriverair.com/nameigos/http://outpostcamps.tumblr.com/NameigosA lot of the lodges that fly out of these areas are decent as well. Nagagami and Kagianagami have great walleye fishing.I am still a believer in that the further north and west you go in Ontario, the better the fishing potential!"
5867682,Juls,2017-11-22 03:44:00,13414,"If you want walleye, pike, and perch, that even novices can catch, I highly recommend Meta Lake Lodge...(you'll LOVE the boats!)www.metalakelodgefishing.com We go in early August, but I would suggest the later part of July for the best fishing. By the time we get there, the weeds are starting to turn brown and die off. The later part of July would be prime time in my opinion. It's a fly in destination... and, about a 23 minute flight Northwest of Nakina. I take a BOSE speaker and bluetooth it to my iPhone, so I can play my playlist, or my fishing partner's playlist, out in the boat. There's nothing like listening to Pink Floyd up there with no one around you for miles. I have Neil on my phone too..."
5867834,BornToFish,2017-11-22 07:00:00,1224,"Greetings,Some of my earliest memories as a child involved fishing with my father on lakes throughout Wisconsin. Fishing has been a life-long passion for me. Having said that, my first weeks fishing in NW Ontario were humbling. I wasn't catching near the quantity or quality of fish that I was expecting to catch, even though I was giving it my best. I learned that I needed to fish differently than I would fish in Wisconsin, simply because the waters are different.I encourage you to consider a guide for the first day or two of your trip. Pay particular attention to what the guide is TEACHING in terms of technique, rather than focusing on his ""spots"". This approach to being guided will likely serve you well.The original post identified a number of potential lodges/lakes. I encourage the original poster to attend an All Canada Show and meet the lodge owners. All websites make their lodge look wonderful. It's the people behind the website that make/break a vacation. You might be able to quickly narrow the choice of lodge and lake with greater confidence. My wife and I listen to a variety of music on the trip to and from our lodge. We never listen to music in the boat. We simply would not want to disturb the serenity of God's gift to us.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5867938,Bill Krejca,2017-11-22 07:54:00,6107,"O'Sullivan's Rainbow on O'Sullivan Lake is a Nakina camp to consider, if you can find an open spot. Folks in my boat don't listen(unless they use headphones) to recorded, or broadcast music, instead listen to the music of nature. A time and a place for everything. IMHO. Bill"
5867970,Guest,2017-11-22 08:02:00,0,"Take a look at Brace Lake outfitters. Smaller lake but you can fish Meta lake and the river that joins them also. And not a long run. Good fishing in most of the lakes up there. That's about all there is up there anymore is fishing and hunting. I,m sure you will have a good time."
5868298,andreindy,2017-11-22 12:10:00,308,"I agree. When in the boat, I want my senses stimulated by natural sounds...which may or may not include the cussing from a jig stuck in the end of a finger."
5868322,andreindy,2017-11-22 12:17:00,308,"Sound advice. And I agree that meeting the face (and judging the character) behind a business has merit. One must be mindful that just like a website, a booth at a show (and the folks there) has the same intentions. The guide is great advice...none of the places I have considered previously (other than Ogoki) appear to offer guiding as an option."
5868330,andreindy,2017-11-22 12:23:00,308,"I am not set on an outpost and don't want to knee-jerk into an outpost either. A lot of premier outposts tend to fill (or remain filled) early. So I think I am probably putting myself on a tighter timeline so I don't miss a chance to book on Abamasagi, for example. Your suggestions are helpful. And you are correct, I would say we are ""annual fisherman""."
