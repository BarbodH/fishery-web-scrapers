5098329,West Newton River Rat,2016-09-05 09:56:00,128,"I have stayed at ORR twice and would go back as the Lake Trout fishing is that good. I am thinking heavily of going back in 2017 for Lake Trout and would not mind giving the walleye a try this time either. However dealing with Robert is getting old and it does put a damper on the trip. If another resort has direct access to the lake without having to boat a very long ways I would try it in a heart beat. But besides the two resorts on the south side of the lake , I know of no other resorts to try. I have not stayed at the Bush Lake resort across from Pasha but have stayed at Raven Lake resort that is owned by Dave Kadlec. Who also owns the Bush Lake resort. It was a very enjoyable experience and would not hesitate to go there again. Raven lake had the best cabins I have ever stayed in and I am sure Bush Lake resort would be the same way."
5101641,Brightsgrover,2016-09-07 16:28:00,2,"We visit this area every year, caught many walleye 1 month ago on Oxaline, Frank, Partridge, Wildgoose and Parks. Onaman & Northwind are okay (busy), we have found most of the good fishing is below (south) Highway 11 around Parks & Postagoni. Jiggin leeches 5 to 10 FOW."
5879482,milton,2017-11-30 22:06:00,15,"I have fished Nipigon 6 or 7 times in the past. 3 trips about 25 years ago out of the south end on a charter owned by a salty guy named Buzz. We lived on the boat for a week and fished out of the 14' aluminum boats that he dragged behind his bigger boat. 8 guys plus ""Captain Buzz"". Fell in love with the lake, mainly fishing the south, south central and west part of the lake up to Gull Bay.Took about a 15 year break for numerous reasons but discovered Onaman River Resort about 10 years ago. Decided to give it a try. The lake has very few options for access points. I have been to ORR about 4 times and really enjoy it. You get what you get and what you make of it. Personally, I wouldn't take my wife there but only because she doesn't like to fish and she prefers a clean, comfortable hotel room when traveling. I am good either way and the chance to fish with my buddies, my son and a friend or two of his is all the incentive I need to sacrifice a little comfort and class.The cabins are comfortable. Our group finds Robert and his dad Wilf to be quite enjoyable. They add spice to the trip. Sometimes they give us crap about things and we give it right back to them. It is how we have all evolved over the years we have been there. I don't need anyone to take care of me- just give me a place to sleep, eat, launch my boat and share some stories around the campfire. The resort is perfect for us. I haven't been there for about 4 years but am planning on going this summer again. I think they have upgraded some things but I am going up with the expectation that we need to bring everything with us that we might need. Food, boat, fishing gear and tackle, GAS FOR BOAT, etc. Their electricity works fine but they are limited and you may not be able to use toaster, fan or charge your trolling battery. If you need detail, call Robert and ask.Money is not our group's issue - they are very reasonably priced but we don't go there because of that. We have done alot of trips over the years including fly-in trips but this is what we have found to fit us best.Some guys bring their own gas generator but we don't find it necessary.All in all, I love the lake and find that staying at ORR works perfect for us. I honestly don't need anything else.Oh yeah - I didn't say anything about the fishing. I can save that for another day but I wouldn't be going back if the fishing wasn't worth it. That's 90% of our motivation. Lake trout - Brook trout - walleye - Northern pike. Some days are better than others. I've fished lakes with more action overall but the chance to catch world class in all of these species is the added incentive."
4921513,MikeinMN,2016-06-12 22:44:00,190,"I'm wanting to book a trip to Onaman River Resort next year early summer. I'm just a little concerned because this trip would be with my wife and I would like to hear from someone who has stayed there to find out a few more details. I'd like to know a little more about the cabins mostly. Also, I would be bringing my own boat and would like to keep it in the water instead of launching it everyday. Is there dockage there? How's the last 30 miles of road? Feel free to send a PM if you prefer. Thanks, Mike"
4928585,dcraven,2016-06-15 06:22:00,47,"I have stayed at Orr with my wife and also on a guy's trip - so two different cabins. Ask for one of the ""nicer cabins"" but all are clean and plenty adequate. Some cabins are a little low on electrical outlets,others are not. Boat docking is available. Bring your own boat. Bring everything in and extra gas, as much as you have room for... You dont want to make trips to town. At times you may catch walleyes right from the docks on nearly every cast. Other times few as they move out. Pike usually near the rushes at river mouth. Trout species out quite a ways in the main lake. We have caught pike to 45"", walleye to 29"", Brookfield to 25"" and lakers to 40lbs there. Whitefish too..."
4928969,vteye,2016-06-15 07:58:00,812,Thank you for the info - how many trips have you made? Do you typically target one species or fish that location due to its multispecies opportunities?
4929473,dcraven,2016-06-15 10:29:00,47,"I have done two trips but communicate and share info with others that go to. This is a huge lake. We target all species. Have also fished northwind lake, onaman lake and a small brookie lake to the north, up the road. Quality fishing though the lake trout fishing takes a learning curve, but they are huge! 38-42"" fish are common. Dc"
4929481,dcraven,2016-06-15 10:31:00,47,"In lbs, the trout average 18-35 lbs.... no kidding. Dc"
4930457,MikeinMN,2016-06-15 15:43:00,190,"Dcraven, thanks for the reply, especially bringing gas. I think many resorts will not allow personal gas cans on site. I hope to fish both trout species and did not know it would mean long runs. I don't mind a learning curve for the fishing, but will it be a problem for me with submerged hazards making the longer trips?"
4976313,Phuff7,2016-07-09 07:37:00,1,"My uncle and I just returned from a short stay at Onaman River Resort and will NEVER stay there again as long as Robert is still the owner. Great location, well kept cabins and easy access to Nipigon, but don't expect Robert to be of any assistance and look out for hidden charges. Here are just a couple of examples we dealt with in three days. Upon our arrival we were filling out the necessary paper work and tried to make small talk by inquiring about his bear hunts(something my uncle and I were interested in pursuing) well after about 10-F bombs and listening to Robert rant about why any would be so dumb and want to shoot a bear we shifted the conversation. Next, our cabin was supposed to be ready to go but not until that evening did we decide to try the hot water and realize he didn't turn the gas on to the cabin. No big deal, figured I'd just run to the main office and ask him to turn it on. Robert then sat on his couch while I pounded on the door because apparently he decided his day was over. the examples go on and on, but to top it off at the end of our stay he tacked on an extra nights charge that was never discussed claiming he needed to make money too."
4977801,Guest,2016-07-10 06:08:00,0,"We've had the same experience with Robert, but mainly his father. We would never return. The fishing is good, but definitely not worth the treatment. We are a low maintenance group that requires no help during the week (been going to this area for 20+ years), however each year Robert and his father found a new way to mis treat us and fellow customers to the point that we decided to try a different camp (extremely happy with our new place). Always surprised there aren't more comments about the lack of respect or customer service at ORR. -He claims to have electricity, but ripped outlets out of cabins (except 1 for fridge which he doesn't want used for anything else). -His father will yell at you for everything from where you park to where you walk to what fish you should keep from the dock. -Robert will hide out in the cabin if you need help and will answer door when he feels like it -Prices increased every year without any notification, and there always seemed to be unexpected extra charges when it was time to pay for the stay. As Phuff7 mentioned the examples could go on and on. Do your research if you intend on traveling to this area because it is rugged country, and you wouldn't want to be caught with a less than helpful outfitter if you run into problems."
4978657,MikeinMN,2016-07-10 11:43:00,190,"I'm still really interesred in fishing Nipigon, but not so sure about O.R.R. Any recommendations that have good access to Nipigon and allow the opportunity for the multi species fishing? I'm concerned if I choose a place on the south end it will mean really long boat rides to lake trout fishing and would also mean no or very little walleye fishing. Pasha and McCollums are two on the south end that I'm looking at."
4980161,Finshady,2016-07-11 06:26:00,12,Bush Lake is another camp to consider (across) the road from Pasha. PM if interested in info.
