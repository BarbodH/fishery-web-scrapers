The trouble is, it's not the way I would choose to fish. Banging around in a boat after dark reduces the pleasure of the overall fishing experience. Lots of great walleye fishing is done in lighted conditions. Lake Hebert couldn't be better after dark, could it? In the far north, so much great fishing is done in daylight it hardly makes a difference. But in hammered waters, closer to home, I think it is the key to catching. The biggest catch of giant walleye I've ever experienced was on the St Lawrence river after dark. I won't go into numbers or size but I'm sure I'll never see it's equal. I was not the catcher but was the netter and that was reward enough. Is it better to enjoy the all around experience of the great visual experience that wilderness lakes provide or would you do better to turn off the lights and maybe catch more?"

One lake we troll shallow when the alewives are spawning in the spring, and we cast for them in a river in both spring and fall. We also night fish for them sometimes at lake Ontario, on one spring trip my one buddy had a 10, an 11, and a 13lb walleye which were caught trolling at night. I also prefer to see the beauty of a lake during the daytime, but night fishing can be rewarding! One way to tell if any walleye are around at night is to shine a spotlight in the shallows, their eyes will look like glowing pearls and are easy to spot."

Knowing the lake as well as I do there's not much chance of hitting rocks. (well maybe). In the past just after dark the walleye have been all over the numerous shoals and just waiting for a jig. Our group night fished Oswego harbor at for several years. Giant walleye were there to be had but should have been returned after a photo, (In my humble opinion). Unless you were looking to hang one on the wall a smaller walleye is the one to keep for the table. Trouble was none of the nightime fish were small. Fantastic memories though of hitting walleye to ten and above and an occasional big brown amid the fleet that fished the nightime hours there. Hundreds, maybe thousands of big fish were taken back then until overkill wore out the fishery."

Shore casting for walleye on Oneida this time of yr. at dusk is very productive"
