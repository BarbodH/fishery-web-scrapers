5857338,Brandonkop,2017-11-14 02:16:00,124,The last of my summer Saltwater videos has been posted. Bottom Fishing is one of our Families favorite things to do. The action is usually pretty great and the fish are fantastic looking and HUGE! The kids love it and my Daughter Caleah even loves cranking them up off the bottom. Sometimes an epic battle between a fish and a 6 year old. She's tough though and shows them who is boss. Even if she does need a little help from dad once in a while. In this video we are mainly catching Lingcod and Yelloweye/quillback rockfish using Gibbs Delta 16 oz jig heads and Glow/sparkle plastics tipped with a piece of salmon belly and some Mike's Herring Scent. These fish cannot resit a well presented jig on the bottom that smells and tastes as good a we prepare them before the trip to the bottom. Most fish are caught in the 150 to 250 foot range in this video. Thanks for Joining us on our adventure!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpScTerPnPg

I got the biggest ling brought in to the harbor that year - 38 lbs., plus we got rockfish, a china rockfish and a starry flounder. It was such a fun day, and the fish were delicious."
5861690,Brandonkop,2017-11-17 12:04:00,124,Yeah bottom fishing is always a good time. Congrats on your 38 pounder that's a big one! Up around port hardy they are pretty big too. We've got some monsters up there.Sent from my SM-G900W8 using Tapatalk
