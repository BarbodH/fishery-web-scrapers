Yes leeches are a lot more expensive in Canada, but it's their law and their country. Respect that and get over it.That said, I'm still mystified as to why we can't bring salted leeches over the border. Years ago I used to save our Canadian bought leeches and salt them for later trips. Can't do that anymore either. If salted minnows are OK, why not salted leeches?I do get frustrated when we fish later in the summer and drive by leech sellers south of the border only to find that leech trappings are over for the year in Canada. Crawlers are great substitute that time of the year. Though when available, I'm just a leech guy most of the time.Pooch"
