566635,jigman 2003,2007-06-25 09:20:00,981,"Got back early Sunday a.m. after a week at Sumach. I must say that we were a little disappointed with the accomodations, services, and fishing. I imagine our experience was an unusual one. I'd be happy to elaborate on our experiences via email with anyone who'd care to know. Good fishing to all."
566637,Guest,2007-06-25 10:02:00,0,Please elaborate

566679,Wisconeye,2007-06-26 11:11:00,79,"Jigman: It must have been the weather because for the first time I too was disappointed by a variety of issues at our outfitter. You know who we used this year. While the weather is what it is, the way outfitters accomodate you shouldn't change with the weather unless it is to help you make the best of a bad situation. Not a favorable experience for us either."

I am hoping that ours was not the ""norm"" and see no need to bad mouth the outfitter on here. However, if you or someone you know is planning to go to Sumach or use E.A. I'd be happy to relay our experience to you via email."

We're used to being able to catch plenty of fish without bait, now I'm thinking that Sumach may not match up with our previous experiences.

We like to jig fish with plastics mainly, but are adaptable to other methods. If your party does much jig fishing; do you use mainly 1/4 oz. or do you need heavier jigs? Also, about how many per guy would you say you lose to rocks, pike, etc. during a week? Thanks."
563670,Guest,2007-02-27 16:42:00,0,"We go in to Paponga on the 3rd. They only weigh the gear. Last year the ""pop"" was flown in with us and thats what put us over. As far as jigs go, I use 1/16 to 1/8. Others in the group swear by 1/4. White plastics always have worked or gold red eyes."
565020,jigman 2003,2007-05-08 06:30:00,981,Figured I'd bring this up one more time and see if anybody else had anything to say. 39 days to go.

565982,jigman 2003,2007-06-05 14:04:00,981,"Figured I'd bring this one back up one more time. If anybody who's been to Sumach this year or has gone this time of the year in the past reads this: Did you find it necessary to use live bait to get walleyes consistently? I may have asked this already on this thread, but don't think so. We are artificial users mainly. Always figured you don't need live bait on a fly-in. Having not gone here before, or with this outfitter before, I just want to make sure we aren't ""putting all of our eggs"" in the artificial basket."
565984,phishfearme,2007-06-05 15:11:00,1242,"jigman - some thoughts. faron flew us into rainfall lake for a day (he has a boat cache there and fishing is ""as it used to be"") but he still gave us a few dozen minnows to use - and we used them. we trolled around with lures/jigs, would hit a few eye's, they'd stop hitting lures then we'd switch to minnows and double our catch. we've had many similar experiences at other fly-in lakes with crawlers - minnows are a real pain and VERY expensive. even though sumach is a fly-in only, it's been open for many many years and there's definitly been pressure there. frankly, i'd cover my bets and get a flat of crawlers ($40 or so?) and hope you don't use/need them. at one of our fly-ins (telescope lake with viking outta red lake), crawlers were about the only thing that worked. best of luck to you guys and please post a report when you get back. phish"
563017,Guest,2007-01-27 09:09:00,0,"jigman - when we were at conifer in mid july we had to troll deep with diving devices but it seems to me you should be able to get down deep enough with large lipped lures such as fat raps or similar. these worked well for us when we were at south trout (way north camps) and didn't need planer boards. give em a try. i've you've even jumped intot he middle of a deep lake you'll see that the surface temp may be nice but you feet will be freezing. the cool water ain't all that deep - but the trout are usually where the baitfish are. good luck, phish"
563018,Larry S,2007-01-27 09:11:00,666,"Jigman The Outfitter on North Caribou use to only book the entire lodge for a flat fee for the week Last year a new 6 person cabin was put in so now he books a smaller group each week. I always did very well for Lake Trout trolling the 5 of diamonds daredevele. One year on Cherrington Lake about 110 miles north of Red Lake near the Manitoba border on a trip,one of the guys caught a 25lb Lake Trout trolling a J-Plug. If one of you has a temperture gauge look for water in the 48 to 52 degree range. The time of the year your going you might need to go to the 20 to 30 ft range.

563652,jigman 2003,2007-02-26 14:15:00,981,"Hey, just getting my packing list ready and am wondering if Faron and EA actually weigh everyone and everything? We're used to an outfitter who does not weigh and doesn't charge for overages (just brings in later on) so we haven't been very good at watching the weight. Wondering if we need to do a better job of this? I know most outfitters do actually weigh and charge, so I'm not complaining. Just want to know where we stand."
563653,Guest,2007-02-26 14:26:00,0,"We were weighed last year. To avoid the extra charge, we left some stuff behind and they flew it in mid-week. If you not staying the whole week, then this won't be an option."
563654,jigman 2003,2007-02-26 14:56:00,981,"We're staying the week. Did he weigh people too, or just gear? I was just looking on his website trying to find the overage charge. I can't find it on the updated site. Was it $1.25 lb. or more last year? Thanks."
563655,5thsuit,2007-02-26 15:17:00,54,"Jigman They will weigh your gear, 120 lbs each is alot of gear. If your one of those who bring in lots of pop or Beer (20 lbs a case), Order it flown in in advance. 90 days and counting, hopefully I will leave you a few fish without bruised lips!!"
563658,jigman 2003,2007-02-26 18:07:00,981,"What date do you fly in? We go in on the 16th of June (I think), you must be going the week before us (or maybe two weeks). Maybe I'll see you on my way in and yours out? I hope you leave us a few too ;-) Really looking forward to this trip. The multiple species aspect is what sold us on this lake."
562272,Guest,2006-12-11 12:49:00,0,The outfitter is great. The camp and equipment are very adequate.
562274,kbkakes,2006-12-11 17:02:00,49,Jigman .....Did you get my e-mail?
562282,jigman 2003,2006-12-12 08:14:00,981,"No, sorry I didn't check my home email last night. I assume that's where you sent it anyway. I'll be happy to answer whatever questions you have. I'll try to remember to check it tonight. Oh yeah, Duh. I sent you one asking about Sumach didn't I? Sorry about that. I had a couple guys asking about Mattice Lake Outfitters, I thought you were one of them, but I was wrong. Getting old. I will definitely read my emails tonight. Thanks!"
562956,jigman 2003,2007-01-24 08:28:00,981,Figured I'd bring this back up. Maybe somebody else who's been to Sumach is starting to check the board again? Any new input appreciated.

562961,jigman 2003,2007-01-24 12:19:00,981,Always great to hear that we made a good choice. Hope to hear some more!
562985,tbenson,2007-01-25 20:22:00,9,"We went to sumach in late june last year. Hit the tailend of the mayfly hatch, but we still caught a fair number of eye's. Most of the walleyes were 19 to 24 inches. Lake trout were in 60 fow. Many northerns but all under 30 inches."
562997,jigman 2003,2007-01-26 08:42:00,981,"Thanks for the input. Were you there the last week of June? We're flying in on the 16th of June this year. I wondered about the mayflies. We dealt with them and other emergers last year during the last week of June-first week of July. Makes for a tougher bite, but you can still get fish. Did you get the lakers on jigs or while trolling? Any colors perform better than others on 'eyes and lakers? Run into any smallies? Thanks again."
562998,Larry S,2007-01-26 09:08:00,666,"Hey Jigman, Will be at North Caribou Lake out of Pickle Lake the same week as your trip. The times that I have fished Lake Trout we have used dardevele 5 of diamonds pattern,redeyes,also flatfish. When I use to fish Lake Michigan we would troll various spoons for Lake Trout does Sumach Lake have any portages you can fish? Larry S"
563000,jigman 2003,2007-01-26 10:47:00,981,"Yep, you can fish Mushroom Lake via a ""short"" portage. Supposed to be great for 'eyes, big pike, and jumbo perch. We'll hit it at least once I imagine. Hoping the trout will still be in the upper part of the water column. Would be fun to be able to troll stick baits or spoons for them (without a lot added weight or diving planes). Is North Caribou a single cabin lake? I think I remember looking at that lake and outfitter when I was putting the trip together this year. Hope your trip is great."
562237,jigman 2003,2006-12-07 12:30:00,981,"Anybody go to this lake or use this outfitter? I did a little searching here but didn't find much about this lake in particular. Any info. appreciated. Our main interest is in great walleye fishing (duh). This lake has multiple species (pike, eyes, smallies, lakers) so it sounds intriguing. I just don't want to sacrifice walleye fishing for the added species. Thanks in advance for any responses."
562238,Roddy,2006-12-07 16:18:00,488,"Jigman, We went through excellent adventures back in 1996 and fished Brownstone lake. If I can be of any help you can drop me an e-mail @ [email protected] Mike"
562240,kbkakes,2006-12-07 21:55:00,49,"Jigman Was there with my sons in 2002 for five days. Beutifull lake!. High cliffs surrounding. Pretty deep lake. 125 ft or better if I remember right. Great Walleye lake. Very easy lake to fish. You will catch all you want. We also caught Lake trout deep 40-50 fow. Lots of em. We were there in late June. Much later they would be hard to catch. Also lots of Pike but no size. 30"" was the biggest. didnt get many smallies but they are there. You will also get perch for a bonus if you care to fish them. Not often you will find a lake with all these species. Great hosts in Faron and Joyce. Will treat you right. I think they added indoor Shower and maybe toilet since we were there. Would like to go back some time. Any more Questions. E-mail CYA .....Kevin"
562244,jigman 2003,2006-12-08 07:53:00,981,"Thanks again! This place does look fantastic, we're leaning towards booking it tonight (if the opening is still there) Kevin-you've got mail"
562254,phishfearme,2006-12-08 12:58:00,1242,"jigman - we did two trips with faron and joyce - one to conifer lake (right next door to sumach) and to brownstone (which i would NOT recommend at all although we portaged everyday - 10 days - to shearstone lake and did incredibly excellent - faron has since lost the LUP for his boat cache on shearstone.) we tried to get into sumach but had to take conifer - they both have all four species available. when i did my research, sumach looked much better because there's lots of shallower area for walleye and smallies where conifers is deep, deep and then you'll find more deep. we nailed lots and lots of trout there though but had to go to the portage lake for walley and perch (jumbos!). faron and joyce are about the best outfitters you can find and they run their own planes. consider staying at the trillium in ear falls - real nice walkin freezer to keep you frozen foods solid. phish"
562255,jigman 2003,2006-12-08 13:02:00,981,"Thanks phish-really appreciate the input. We're almost positive that this is where we are going. When you went with them did you ever talk with any guys who were on Sumach? The searching I've done here has given limited, but good results. What's the best place in Ear Falls for supper and breakfast?"
562256,phishfearme,2006-12-08 13:07:00,1242,"as a matter of fact, we shared a plane ride with a group of two guys from WI coming out of sumach and they were pretty satisfied with the exception of the trout fishing. i told them our experience and we agreed we shoulda swapped lakes as they did much better on walleye which is what we prefer and they were after trout. se la vie. i suggest asking faron for the name of the group that was there this past summer for the same or similar week you're planning. the trillium if fine for dinner and breakfasts. phish"
562267,Guest,2006-12-11 10:47:00,0,"Just wanted to agree with what Kevin wrote. Excellent lake for numbers of walleye. Look for either rocky points or weedy flats in front on inlets. Our group has never caught any real large 'eyes, but the average size has steady increased over the past 6 or 8 years. We've never targeted northerns and haven't seen any size, but they're everywhere. Don't ignore the smallies. They're numerous around the small islands and there are some big ones. Sumach also has a good laker population, but they're deep by July. One evening we always troll deep crankbaits in front of the cliffs for lakers and take a couple directly to the grill for supper. Hmmmm"
562269,jigman 2003,2006-12-11 11:33:00,981,"stuck pig-thanks for the info, much appreciated. I gather from your post that you've been to the lake for a number of years? What would you say the average size 'eye is? On average, fishing an 8 hour day, how many 'eyes can you boat (I know, lots of variables)? I assume that since you've been there a number of times you must be quite happy with the fishing and the outfitter? Are you going with them again this year?"
562271,Guest,2006-12-11 12:42:00,0,"We rarely count, but I'm sure we've had legit 100-walleye days on Sumach without fishing real, real hard. That would be 100 per boat with two guys in a boat. I remember one time the walleye bite was hot on a flat in front of a stream, so my son and I had a contest to see who could catch the most fish (any species) in exactly one hour of trolling shallow crankbaits from the same boat. The kicker was he got to select my bait and I got to choose his....so we definitely weren't using the best lures in the box. He won, with each of us catching about 20 in an hour. The first year I went to Sumach it was with my older son, probably 8 years ago. We caught tons of 16-17"" walleyes and would get excited about a 20+ incher. Last year the average size was probably close to 20 inches and numbers were about the same as every other year. In all the years I've been there, though, I honestly don't remember anyone in our group catching a walleye over about 24 inches. Most of the guys in our group backtroll with spinners. Minnows work great, but we prefer crawlers because they're easier to keep alive all week. A jig/twister tail works fine once you find a concentration of fish."
