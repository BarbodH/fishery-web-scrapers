Thats pretty standard w/ what I've seen at other outfitters, though I've seen one that said 300 lbs total, your body weight included. We're having them fly beer up early for us this year, with the Duty & Weight Penalty we usually pay the cost/case actually was about the same."
566884,Guest,2007-07-02 09:48:00,0,What is the 2 cabin arrangement that you mention in your post? Didn't Dave and Michelle build a new cabin on Herod in 2006 or 2007? Are there 2 cabins on this lake? Thanks.
566891,Guest,2007-07-02 12:37:00,0,"They did build a new cabin, but we went wow, I guess 9 years ago. They had one cabin with 4 bedrooms & shower, and a cabin that had the kitchen/living area about 15 yards away. The DVD they gave away last year highlighted their new cabins, we're looking forward to trying some new lakes out, starting next year."
566900,Guest,2007-07-02 15:08:00,0,For the hastle flying the beer and pop in ahead makes all sence. 100 pounds weight limit is pretty standard for most outfits Ive seen too. Theres acouple outfitters who use 120-125 pounds of gear each if weight is an issue. 300 pounds total including your body weight is great if your a little guy.
566148,Guest,2007-06-11 11:12:00,0,Has anyone ever been to Herod Lake? I would be interested in any experiences you are willing share.
566165,Guest,2007-06-11 14:23:00,0,"I have a friend who fished up there last June and said the fishing was awesome. Sorry, can't help with anything else."
566184,Roddy,2007-06-11 22:07:00,488,"We fished the lake 6 years ago. I will preface this by saying the mayflies hatched while we were on the lake. Fishing was not very good and I am guessing it was because of the hatch. Our party also was not to keen on having two seperate cabins. One for sleeping and another for cooking and showering, but that was just our personal preference. It did appear that a fire had gone through in the past few years and taken a lot of trees with it so the scenery was not like other fly-ins we have had. We did have one day when we were fishing in about 4 feet of water and looked down and noticed walleyes everywhere. We just could not get them to bite, which probably had something to do with the mayfly hatch. We had a couple of other things that went wrong that made us decide not to return to the outfitter. We may have been an isolated case as I have seen other posts that were very impressed with the outfitter and the lake."

They run a really first class operation, with a great safety record (which is not always the case with some operators). I live in Nestor Falls and will personally vouch for the quality of their fly-in camps and their total operation. Please consider giving them another try. Discuss any concerns you might have had with Doug and I am sure he will do everything possible to make it right."

Bob, I do believe we may have been an isolated incident and did mention that most posts I have read about the outfitter seem to be positive and know the mayfly hatch was beyond their control. We did have an overweight charge on beverages. We were told at the time of booking that beverages would be flown in on a checkflight free of charge. Then when we arrived we were told they would not be able to provide this service because of gas prices. That probably started the trip out on a bad note. Again I have heard many positive comments about the outfitter but because of the one issue it cost them a party of 8 from returning."
566234,rpieske,2007-06-13 06:50:00,1276,"Yes, that hurts. I firmly believe in ""no surprises."" I would rather have an email telling me that I will have to raise prices by X number of dollars because of fuel prices than have it sprung on me as I arrive. I guess I am showing my age....I said talk to Doug. I meant Dave. It's been tough on camps and flying services with the fuel cost increases. I guess they really need to get a handle on how to inform the customers BEFORE arrival. Hope you find an operator who meets your expectations. Have a good season."
566247,Guest,2007-06-13 19:52:00,0,I agree...
566250,Guest,2007-06-14 08:38:00,0,We used Dave and N/F flt-in for a day trip and were very happy. We were in N/Falls last week and they picked up guests at our camp at Canadian Haven right at the dock. Hard to beat the service.
566854,Guest,2007-07-01 09:47:00,0,"We've been using NFO with Dave & Michelle for about 12 years, and have fished Herod, Lount & Kay lakes. You're gonna pay a premium no matter who you go with for being overweight, and with a case of beer weighing 20 lbs, we cut into our weight limit very quickly. The year we went to Herod, there was a nasty front front that parked over us for a couple of days. That being said, we did have a great trip. The only downside was the two cabin arrangment. We don't just jig, we fish very agressively, and had tremendous luck with soft plastics, Fat Rap's, and just about everything we threw. At one spot, two of us had 5 fish on at one time, and pulled about 60 fish up in 20 minutes."
566870,Guest,2007-07-01 21:48:00,0,"Sounds like the fishing is good. When your on your trip, what did they allow for weight to go with you on the plane??"
