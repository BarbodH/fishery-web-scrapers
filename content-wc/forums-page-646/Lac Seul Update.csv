566595,Guest,2007-06-22 16:40:00,0,"Jigger1: Have a great trip and tell Mike and Brandon hi from the Marty boys. First day back and I am already counting the days till next year. The standard spots were either completely on or completely off, run and gun until you find active fish. Once you find them, don't leave. Talked to a couple of groups that left fish to find more active fish and they never found them in the same quantity they left. If the spot had fish, they seemed to come in a pulse. You would have 10 - 15 minutes of strong fishing followed by a lull. If you waited, another pulse of fish would pass through and you would have your hands full again. May be different next week, but that was our experience. Great food, great guides, great boats, great resort, what can I say. Saw a number of moose on the way home, including one huge bull that already had a huge spread on his rack. That was on 502 so watch that road if your traveling early or late. During our week there, one group came in very late at night and saw seven moose on the gravel out of Dryden. Cheers and stay focused on sharpening the hooks this weekend. IA Walleye"

566628,Guest,2007-06-24 10:39:00,0,Got home this morning. Caught lots of Walleye but they were still spread out pretty good. Had best luck on isolated windy spots in 6 to 18'm of water. Headed back next week with two couples hope to find mid lake humps with some fish on them. Be fishing south of Chamberlin Narrows.
566631,RB,2007-06-25 07:39:00,32,jigger 1 The Sucker island I'm talking about would be west of the mouth of Bray and a little north. As I look at Google Earth it's a little father west then I originally thought (3 or 4 Miles). The island might have an other name but that just the name the Indians at Mahkwa Lodge told me. They pointed that island out on the map and said to fish the smaller ones just south of that. If I get out to my boat I'll look up the coordinates and post them. RB
566645,RB,2007-06-25 12:13:00,32,jigger 1 My chip has Sucker island on it at N50 18.476 W 92 35.502 RB
566667,Jigger1,2007-06-25 21:18:00,234,"Thanks RB - Glad I checked in before I left. Just printed the boarding pass and ready to go in the AM. IA Walleye will post when I get back, hope somebody in our party get's a 30+ as well. I'll pass on the good word to Mike and Brandon."
566674,PigBoy,2007-06-26 08:17:00,120,"When is this gosh darn weather going to settle down? Rain every morning mixed with thunder and gusty winds, then the sun will come out in the afternoon for a while, then more clouds and showers. I'm getting tired of puting on the rain gear, then taking it off, then puting back on. It also makes a guy work too hard to figure out whats going get the walleyes to bite that day because what was working yesterday, doesn't."
566814,Guest,2007-06-30 05:03:00,0,"IA Walleye Glad you had a great trip again this year. Wow, over 1000 walleye and the sizes of those big ones sounds fantastic. As I told you earlier we had a great trip too, but of course we are after the big pike more than the walleye. We are booked again for last week of May into early June."
566822,Guest,2007-06-30 08:25:00,0,"NE Piker Yes, great trip. Biggest pike was 36"", but that was on walleye gear as we never hunted the water wolves. Biggest bass was 17"", but we only spent a couple of hours bass fishing as the walleye fishing was just too great to give up for any length of time. We are booked in again for the second week of June in 2008, so for the rest of the summer I have to live through the reports of others and count the days until we hit the waters of the north!. Cheers....IA Walleye"
566577,Guest,2007-06-22 07:54:00,0,"Just returned from a week at LS (June 14 - 21). Great week as always. See the fishing report that is posted at the Silver Water Wheel site for details. Lots of fronts moving through during the week, but with a bit of effort we found fish quickly. The depth seemed to change on a daily, if not hourly basis. We fished from 6' to 25' feet depending on the mood of the fish. Jig and minnow was the only bait that worked for us. Tried bottom bouncers/spinners and cranks, but those just did not work as well as jigs with a minnow (no twister tail). Despite the weather the fishing was outstanding, with the quality of the fish being terrific. Everthing was weather dependent. Best bet, find a shoreline with the waves hitting and jig at 13 - 10 feet. Thanks Mike W for a wonderful week.....IA Walleye"

566578,RB,2007-06-22 08:12:00,32,IA Walleye Did you fish much around sucker island and the other island just south of that? Did you make any big runs NE up around Pine Point? Thanks for you report. RB

566585,Guest,2007-06-22 10:16:00,0,"We were in the central part of the lake, and I am not sure where Sucker Island is. Fished spots within 8 miles of the resort most days, and many times within 3 - 4 miles. Made one long run to the NE the first day and it was not worth the journey vs the results near the resort. Had a blast and between four of us over 6 days we caught just over 1000 walleyes. Numerous times when we had 3 - 4 on all at the same time. What was more amazing than the quantity was the quality. Biggest was 30.5 and then 2 28's. We kept very solid counts and caught 480 of 18"" or better). The weather was inconsistent but we were never blown off the water and the heavy rain came at night (one night was 1.5 inches over night). As such, we fished very hard for all 6 days. Best trip in years, maybe ever! Good luck,,,IA Walleye"

566587,RB,2007-06-22 11:26:00,32,Thanks for the reply. Sucker isn't to far out from the enterence of Bray so I'm sure you were around there. I see the SWW boats fishing those island when I'm up there. It is a great part of the lake to fish with lots of bigger fish. Have a good day RB

566594,Jigger1,2007-06-22 16:17:00,234,IA Walleye - Have been waiting for your report and it's great to hear you had an outstanding trip. I will give an update when we get back as well. I've completely lost focus after reading your report! We leave on Tuesday. RB - Are you talking north or west of Bray as I'm not familiar with Sucker either yet have fished all around that area.

565697,Guest,2007-05-30 07:59:00,0,How has the fishing been on Lac Seul. We are headed up friday and will be staying at Lac Seul Lodge on the west shore. Thanks
565914,Guest,2007-06-04 09:10:00,0,"I have a couple general thoughts and questions... First off, very excited for the trip to Lac Seul June 15-22nd. I don't know if any one reading travels through Eau Claire WI. If so I thought that I would pass on the good news and let people know that the Hywy 53 bypass has been completed. It's really slick and is a huge time saver! Does anyone know what they are charging for leeches this year in Canada? If so, how are the leeches? I have been reading my posts and understand that the water level is below its average for this time of the year. If anyone has been to the northwest/west secton of Lac Seul in the past week, how many feet is the lake down? How has this affected the progression of the lake ie. are anglers finding the fish is spring time patterns and when would a person expect the fish to begin moving to summer time holding patterns. Any indication as to if the lake is ahead or behind schedule would be great. Best of luck. Northbound"
565921,Guest,2007-06-04 10:52:00,0,"Northbound: We will be there the very same week as you. The resort we go to is in the central part of the lake. Not many resorts in that area. We have been going to the same resort virtually the same time now for seven years (other resorts before that). For LS, we have never done well with leaches at this time of the year. I have tried it twice and both times was always outfished by folks in the same boat using minnows or just a jig and a curly-tail.. Not sure at other times of the year or at the west or east end, but I don't even bother with leaches any more. What is odd is back in IA and Northern Wisconsin, I am always fishing leaches and in fact have done well at this same time of the year at other Canadian lakes, but LS seems to be a minnow bite in the spring. I hear the summer becomes a good nightcrawler bite. As to the leaches, that is just my opinion from my own experience and others may have completely different. Thanks for the update on the EC bypass. Will be nice to save some time on the journey up and back. Have a great week and travel safe...IA Walleye"
566024,Guest,2007-06-06 17:01:00,0,"Thanks for the heads up IAWalleye. I will keep the pointers in mind. It is always interesting to hear what has and has not worked for others in the past. I hope that you enjoy your trip and I wish you the best of luck. Has anyone heard if it has been an early or late spring? A little insight from a person just getting back is always helpful. Thanks, Northbound"

566367,Guest,2007-06-18 09:39:00,0,"just got back from lac seul lodge, we caught tons of fish in sunlight and broad, not to many on the banks, water level is aprox 3 ft down from this time last year, mayflys are just starting to hatch, most of the fish were caught in 2.5 to 6 feet of water, be very carful going through the river to broad and stay in the middle. most fish were slot and below, biggest was 25 inch, not a great year for size, but we caught a ton of fish, oh yea, dont try to go through the short cut, yuo will take off your lower unit.

566369,Mike Kansas,2007-06-18 10:12:00,1463,"Just returned from Black Bay Outpost out of Lac Seul Lodge. This is our 17 th year there and the fishing was a little better than average. We ( 7 of us)caught around 1000 Walleye with 40% being slot or above. Biggest fish for the week was 28 1/2"". The Walleyes were spread out on the main lake and not holding consistently to any piece of cover. I believe this was because the wind was changing direction on us several times each day. Best luck was in 5 to 12' of water if you could find them holding. Jig/Minnow and Jig/Crawler worked the best. Didn't seem like the fish were aggressive enough yet for bottom bouncers or dragging cranks."
566557,Guest,2007-06-20 19:29:00,0,"If you're concerned about water level on Lac Seul, go to www.lwcb.ca click on basin data and when the page loads go to Lac Seul. You will see that the water level has risen about 3 ft in the first 3 weeks of June. It should rise more as the summer progresses and then level off."
