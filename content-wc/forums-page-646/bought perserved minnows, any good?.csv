566838,phishfearme,2007-06-30 18:20:00,1242,trapper - have brought along gulp stuff for the last two trips but ended up not even opening them. didn't want to open the bag/jar until we ran outta crawlers and it's amazing how many walleye you can catch on one crawler - we just never ran out so i don't have any feedback for you. we'll try again in 5 days. phish
566840,trapper_john,2007-06-30 20:06:00,83,"Thanks, I'll be watching. I use crawlers too. I use them on a rig. Spinner, beads, etc. I use them on a floating jig with a lindy, sometimes just a lindy, long leader and a plain hook and a crawler with a bubble of air in his butt. Besides, a bit of crawler will take some really nice perch."
566842,joeman79,2007-06-30 20:32:00,417,"we definetely will, and hopefully we will catch some blue walleye and get some good pics. Thanks Joe"
566776,Guest,2007-06-28 14:25:00,0,Have you had any luck using the perserved minnows? How would you compare them to live? Does Cabela's still carry them?
566813,Guest,2007-06-29 22:23:00,0,"I used the preserved large fathead minnows from cabaleas.They worked just as good as live.But you don't have to mess with a minnow bucket, have them flop of your hand when you are trying to hook them,they come in a resealable pack, they are kind of stiff but that did'nt seem to matter,you can carry as many in your tackle box as you want.In fact I told the guy's I won't pay for or use live minnows again.They are cheaper then live bait.Easier to work with.Just my opinion.Terry"
566816,joeman79,2007-06-30 05:54:00,417,"I own a baitshop in the states and carry fathead minnows, does anyone have a recipe for preserving them? It would be much appreciated if you do. Thanks Joe"
566817,joeman79,2007-06-30 06:23:00,417,"did search and found method to try, soprry for not looking first."
566829,Guest,2007-06-30 13:54:00,0,Hi. it was our experience that the fish liked dead minnows just as much as they liked live minnows. i would think they would be fine. are they cheaper than live ones is the question?
566830,Guest,2007-06-30 15:21:00,0,Four of us fished Lac Seul first week of June. Used preserved minnows and nightcrawlers first four days. Between us we caught about 25 fish first 4 days. Bought live minnows last 2 days and caught about 200. Mabey in late summer preserved minnows are alright but they were terrible for us first week in June. We fished the northwest side and the rapids at wennesaga River.
566832,phishfearme,2007-06-30 16:13:00,1242,"i tend to agree with mercuryguy - there's just no comparison between a dead stiff minnow and a lively one. BUT - i'd still stick with godd old nightcrawlers - cheaper, easier to handle and almost as effective as live minnows. i also did the salt/borax recipi listed on this board and still found that the guts tend to end up bulging out pretty quickly and ruined the bait/action. the store bought ones are better in this respect but there still just a ""stiff"". phish"
566833,joeman79,2007-06-30 16:43:00,417,"I think Phish is right why I am I worried about taking minnows when I have always slayed em on crawlers and straight old twisters. Guess I am just thinking ""What if"" way to much. Just got a bunch of gulp leeches and minnows in and hope they work. Taking crawlers though. 31 days to Richardson. I am so ready. Joe"
566834,trapper_john,2007-06-30 17:47:00,83,"I'm interested in the Leeches.. We are going to Wabaskang in 27 days and I bot some Gulp leaches and minnows to try. Have you had good success with the leeches? Ohhhhhh Yeah, gonna take crawlers too."
566837,phishfearme,2007-06-30 18:17:00,1242,joe - please make sure you post a trip report - richardson is on our short list for future trips. have a great trip. phish
