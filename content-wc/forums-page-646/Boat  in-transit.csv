566790,Guest,2007-06-28 20:42:00,0,I have a canoe that is powered by a 3.3 hp gas that I just bought. I have a 30 day in-transit in my home state. Can I get this across the boarded and will the Canadian Officials give me any grief on the water with a noterized Bill of Sale?

566812,Guest,2007-06-29 20:41:00,0,Thanx Fellas I appriciate the info. It has really turned into a mess. 1) no hull ID #-- 4-6 wait to get one-- it's a canoe 2) no title on the boat-- police check-- it's a canoe 3) Bill of sale not noterized-- got that one taken care of
566815,Guest,2007-06-30 05:41:00,0,I wouldn't worry about it. Canoes are not registered in Ontario I'm pretty sure. I have a 12 ft. boat w/ 9.9 that we keep up @ our camp that doesn't need registration. once you go 10hp and up is when you need #'s on them. Have a great trip !
