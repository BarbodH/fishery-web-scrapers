Cook sometimes is as cheap as Clouque (south on hwy 33, about 15 miles)but not always. By the time you get within 50 miles of Int. Falls, they are all high. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

566720,dutchboy,2007-06-27 20:50:00,5717,The Super America (believe it or not) in Cotton will be the cheapest. At least that was the case last weekend. Cotton is about 12 miles North on the intersection of Hwy's 53 & 33.

566769,Guest,2007-06-28 08:34:00,0,when we went this way the 1st week of June there was on 10-15 cents from Indiana to International Falls. I'm sure you are awar ebut make sure you fill up in I/falls going into & returning from Canada.
566868,bensen,2007-07-01 21:16:00,155,"Gas is Gas. & what it cost's is an expense. If the price is too high, stay home. So what if it goes up $1.00/ gallon in a trip. It is not goin to break you if you going to spend big money on a Canadian vacation. Maybe different if you're living paycheck to paycheck, but most going to Canada aren't in that situation."
