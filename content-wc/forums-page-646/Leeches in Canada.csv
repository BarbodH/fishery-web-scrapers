566787,Guest,2007-06-28 20:17:00,0,"Just wondering if leeches will be available(and what the cost is per lb.) come the 1st week of August? Last year, despite calling ahead to the 4 Seasons bait shop in Ear Falls, we were unable to get any leeches there, or anywhere because of a ""shortage""(so we were told). I just want to know if there is another ""leech shortage"" this year, so I can be prepared and bring lots of crawlers. Thanks for the info!!"
566798,Guest,2007-06-29 09:06:00,0,I have not heard of any shortages but I am not a walleye fisherman. The leeches we bought were $44lb. good luck.

I've heard that you can put a fish carcass into a nylon stocking and hang it off the end of your dock and leeches will attach themselves to the stocking. Have never tried it, but maybe someone else on the board can comment to its effectiveness. Larry"

566841,reelman1,2007-06-30 20:15:00,276,I just went through Ft. Francis and they were selling leeches for $44 a pound. There is no way I would pay that and waste all the time required rebaiting with real leeches when there are so many excellent artificials available.
