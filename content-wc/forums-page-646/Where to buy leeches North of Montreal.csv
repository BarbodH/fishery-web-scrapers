558044,Seanik,2006-06-04 12:07:00,218,"We are leaving July 27th for a week of fishing at Lake Poutrincourt Quebec. I am looking for a baitshop North of Montreal that sells leeches by the pound on Rt #155 or Rt #167. We will be entering Canada at the 1000 Islands bridge, any baitshop along the 401 to Montreal would also be ok. A phone number would be great since I think it would be prudent to order a week in advance. Anyone thats been to Poutrincourt says that crawlers is all thats necessary but when the fishing really gets tough a leech usually works when everything else won't. Thanks in advance"

558107,retire55,2006-06-06 09:55:00,1029,Hello Seanik: I did a search on http://www.baitnet.com/index.php for the towns of Roberval and St-Félicien. No results for Roberval but the following result for St-Félicien L.E.L CHASSE ET PÊCHE 579 BD SACRÉ COEUR ST-FÉLICIEN QC G8K 2S2 (418) 679-3311 I don't know if the info is good or not. Might be worth a phone call.
558109,Guest,2006-06-06 11:18:00,0,You are going to drive right past Cornwall on the 401 - I would stop in there - at least the people will speak english. Here is one bait shop in Cornwall - but I am sure there are more... JIGGERNAUT TACKLE COMPANY 1235 CUMBERLAND St (613) 932-3474 Give them a try.. Good luck Smitty
558137,Seanik,2006-06-07 07:39:00,218,"Thank you, Retire55 and Smitty Your info on the baitshops was what I was looking for. Retire55 you help in the past has made for some great fishing trips. Thanks again,"
558508,Seanik,2006-06-16 10:03:00,218,"Hi everyone, This forum is the best! I was able to locate and order leeches from information gained here. The bait shop outside of Montreal and near our route of travel is: Lauzon Chasse & Peche 216 2nd Ave Lile Perrot, Qc (514) 453-5018 I called them and they were very helpful, as a plus English is spoken. An earlier post suggested I call Jiggernaut Tackle Co. I did and Bill the person I talked to said they did not sell live bait but recommended Lauzon Bait where he buys his bait. So with a few phone calls everything is right with the world of finding leeches for our upcoming trip to Lake Poutrincourt. Thanks again you are the best"
566773,Guest,2007-06-28 11:22:00,0,so how was your 2006 trip to poutrincourt ? we went back in 2001-2002 and found it pretty good. curious how you made out with the leeches. were they worth the trouble ? ss
566799,Seanik,2007-06-29 09:18:00,218,"Hi SS, Yes, leeches are worth taking to Poutrincourt. Some days they outfished everything. Crawlers were a close second but the bigger walleyes came on gold colored plugs. Poutrincourt is an excellent fishery and the owners say they are protecting it. I did not see any effort in this direction. Because of the driving distance and price verses quality elsewhere, we probably won't return. We leave for the Gouin Reservoir July 13, taking our grandson on his first trip. I called the bait shop in Gatineau yesterday and they did not have any leeches. They hope to have a 1 1/2 lbs for me by the 13th but I may have to look elsewhere."
566876,Guest,2007-07-02 05:59:00,0,"good luck with gouin. interesting take on the leeches. where did you get the leeches ? gatineau ? gold plugs? i often spec'ed that they would outfish worms for the bigger eyes. i think they are there but you need the right item to get them. there are so many fish in there that the competition is fierce. once again, good luck with gouin. ss"
566904,Seanik,2007-07-02 16:01:00,218,"SS The bait shop in Gatineau is Atelier du pecher, Ph. # 819-669-8700. They are located at the end of Labrossee Boulevard which is a right turn off Highway 50 going East. I called them and they are out of leeches and hope to have my 1 1/2 lb order for July 13th but didn't sound to hopeful. Retire55 originally gave me the bait shop information, he lives in the area and has been very helpful. Thanks again Jay. There hasn't been much information here on the Gouin area, I am wondering how the water levels and fishing is?"
