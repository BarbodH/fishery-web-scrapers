Dutchies has the convenience store fare, and Rainbow Point Lodge has a lesser selection. Neither offer hot meals, however. You could travel another 20 minutes north to Ear Falls, or stop in Vermilion Bay before heading north on 105 from 17. Both towns have places to secure a hot meal. Roy"

566908,Oldschool,2007-07-02 17:21:00,163,"Yes, there is (or was, as I haven't been there for 2 years). But even when it was open, I could never manage to find it open for business when I was in the area. That's the reason I pointed to the other two sources. But you are correct that it could be an option, and perhaps I should have pointed that out. Thanks, Roy"
566913,trapper_john,2007-07-02 20:41:00,83,I think that if it were me I would probably stop in Vermilion Bay first and then head on up. Going up there in about three weeks. Really starting to get pumped for it. Let me know how it turned out for you.. going to Kingfisher.
566921,Guest,2007-07-03 06:51:00,0,The Sunrise Cafe tends to have very selective hours. I believe the business was for sale last year when we went by on our way to Sleepy Dog. Stop in Vermilion Bay or Dryden to eat breakfast on your way up. There is a decent restaraunt on the corner of of 17 and 105 next to the gas station.
