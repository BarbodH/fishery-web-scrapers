Thinking this would be a good HQ for a late June early July Musky hunt.Is there good fishing in Stevens Bay or would we be better off in another area of Sabaskong. This would be my first trip to Lake of the Woods and i would like to learn sectors of the lake one at a time, I figure Stevens Bay has enough size and structure to keep me busy for a few days and Young's seems like a nice camp thats been around for a while. Any input is appreciated. Thanks! J.Merics"

Thanks! > >J.Merics I have never stayed there but did go out and look at their cabins once and seemed like a nice place and nice owners so I don't think you could go wrong. We stay in the Nestor Falls area. I would also suggest a day trip over to Crow Lake for some muskies!! The owners of the 2 camps are(or were a couple years ago & I assume they still are) related and can hook you up. good luck."

I would be bringing my own boat, how are the docks at Young's? (plug in onboard charger) 3. Does Stevens Bay experience a bloom? if so, what time of season usually? Thanks again, J.Merics"

They have a phone to call to the resort, and they will come and help transport stuff to cabins, which are about 1-1/2 miles by boat. Camp is on an island, but has hydro power. Beutiful view from cabins. The docks are set up for power for battery charging, no problem. There will be a bloom on most of that southern part of LOW. That's just the way it is. Just use baits that are highly visible, i.e., flash, chartruse, etc. Plenty of muskies near the camp, if that's what you want to fish for."
