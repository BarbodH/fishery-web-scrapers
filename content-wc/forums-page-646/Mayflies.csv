566845,Moss,2007-06-30 21:30:00,7,Looking for methods to consistantly catch walleyes during a mayfly hatch. Presently I am using whistler jigs or sonars. Basically something with a vibration when lifted off bottom. Tip with part of a nightcrawler. Anyone have any other proven techniques? Thanks Moss.

If you don't have a fly rod, use a float just for weight... leave about 6 ft of line... this usually works better to have the fly float on the surface... walleye will surface feed this time of year. A small black fury spinner, cast it, drop it to the bottom the reel up. I also troll jigs with a grub tail... small piece of worm on. The double tail grubs seem to work better during this period. I also prefer the color white. Walleye still bite during this period... finesse jigging is a good method if you locate fish. Lighter the jig the better.

566855,Guest,2007-07-01 10:59:00,0,I have two options that work for me and as a matter of fact I was out yesterday on Wabigoon and it was loader but my kids and i did great. we caught lots of fish and thee in the 25 to 26 inch range. What I do is down size big time. I use small leech's with a #8 or #10 bait hook and move real slow if at all. Oh ya this is on a live bait rig and no beads at all. But i even do better when insted if the leech i use a very small oiece of crawler about a inch long hooked right throuigh the nose.I also lut a little air in it so when I stop it floats up from the botton much like a emerging may flie. Good Luck!! John Butts
566856,Guest,2007-07-01 12:17:00,0,Last year during a mayfly hatch I used a bottom bouncer with a spinner rig. I used a gold hammered blade with a aberdeen hook tipped with a quarter of a crawler. We consistently caught walleye all week during the hatch. Scott
566880,Moss,2007-07-02 08:33:00,7,"Hey Greg, why do you prefer a white grub at this time. I would have thought a brown like rootbeer would work better. Years ago, I had a bottle of mayfly spray for flies but never had a chance to use it. I see everyone else uses a little piece of nightcrawler which would go right a long with the size of a mayfly. Thanks for all the tips, Moss"
