566780,tly,2007-06-28 14:48:00,1900,Manitou is right on the way to Bear Narrows from Deception. If you go through the rags you will turn toward rags just before the marker. If you go around through the elbow you will pass the marker. In either case you will turn west (left) as you come out of the narrows with the fast current. The marker is straight ahead about 2 miles on the south shore (left).

Biggest was a thick 28.5. Lots of 24-25s. A little one here and there too. Very consistent action. The spots had a mix of a sand and rock bottom. Fish were 20-35 feet down. Jig + minnow. Color didn't matter! Lots of pike in the area too, but no monsters. The screen was full of big fish."

Perhaps next time, rather than keeping that large walleye, you might want to consider taking a digital photo and release the big guy to keep Lac Seul the high quality fishery that it is."
566862,Guest,2007-07-01 19:18:00,0,"I will be leaving for Lac Seul on July 13th, we will be staying at Lost lake. I enjoy your fish reports, sound like a great time! I have fished the area north of Ogama Light up to the Maclean light area, I have never reach the Bear narrows area. Any information on good fishing areas would be great. Also what type of presentation is working for you. Thanks Again, Woody"
566704,Otts,2007-06-27 11:52:00,119,Just got back from 3.5 days of fishing. Best fishing that I have had up there. Our numbers of fish were really good. We caught a 29.5 at Sen Bay and two 28.25s up around Manitu. Only one 28.25 came home because the wife caught it and wants to put it on the wall. We fished all crawlers with spinners and kept them going most of the time. Fished chartruse beeds and floater with orange spinner most of the time. Orange seemed to be the key color for this trip. Most fish were caught anywhere from 19 to 30 feet of water. I would say that they are spread out or on their way to reefs. Spent some money up there also: 2 new deep cycle batteries Need to replace or buy a new St Criox...wife broke it on a snag Dropped my remote for the copilot in the lake. Took the lanyard off to put on sun screen...got a bite and reached for the rod and dropped the remote. Would also like ot thank this site because my lowrance would only shoe the mapping page the first day of fishing. Got back to camp and went on this site and found out how to reset it and then it was up and running great. Otts

The last time we did we stayed at a campground in town and boated out every day. A waste of precious time. Sounds like the fish are still good there though. Were there a lot of other boats around? Thanks for any info,"

566723,Guest,2007-06-27 21:53:00,0,I bet the expletives were flying when the new St.Croix snapped. I wish I could have been within earshot of that episode. Did she reel in the big one all the way or hand the rod to you when it came near the boat? Odey
