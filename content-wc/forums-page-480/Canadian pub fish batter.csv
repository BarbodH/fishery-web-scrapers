It's one of my favorites and I can't find it anywhere. I did a google search and it was very hit and miss. Just curious if it's still out there."

1323019,TIGHTLINER,2011-06-27 05:57:00,223,I had used some on a trip earlier I think it was purchased at menard's if it was the same item.
1323648,troutwater,2011-06-28 12:16:00,299,"Well I've looked everywhere in town and no one has it, including menards and walmart. Thanks for at least letting me know it's still around. Maybe I'll stop in at a place on the way up to Cedar in a few days and check it out."
1323841,tlee,2011-06-28 20:05:00,65,I just saw it today at WalMart in sporting goods
1323945,Reelcranky,2011-06-29 08:19:00,31,I believe that you can buy it online at www.northwoodsoutlet.com
1323950,troutwater,2011-06-29 08:33:00,299,Thanks for the help guys. I've visited every single store down here in central IL and no one has it. I would order it from that website but I leave tomorrow so it would be futile. Hopefully I'll bring some fish back and be able to order it then.
