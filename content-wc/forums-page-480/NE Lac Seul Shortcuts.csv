1323972,jswinter40,2011-06-29 09:29:00,127,"Ben or Colin,How deep is the RAGS runnin'? Houseboats going through? Heard the water was down some. Did they get the big fire under control?thanks"
1324170,bigwalleye1,2011-06-29 16:32:00,2632,"While not to date on point, we ran the area June 14 to 18, and saw houseboats (even large ones) traveling both ways. www.lwcb.ca listed 1167 as the height at that time, and it's been coming up since. We had no issues, and it should be better now."
1324885,cuamb,2011-07-01 12:47:00,203,We came through both shortcuts with a 68 ft Houseboat on the 20th of June. Water was low but deep enough for the HB. Fishing was really good this year. We heard some guys complaining about an east wind but it didn't seem to matter. Did real well on walleyes in shallow (3 to 5 ft.) bays that wind was blowing in. Casted for Pike a few hours and they seemed pretty aggresive. Going back in August. Can't wait.
1324889,jswinter40,2011-07-01 13:01:00,127,CuambCongrats on another great trip. Care to PM me which bays you were haveing success with walleyes and northerns? going up in a week. thanks
1316382,Dan Jarvi,2011-06-09 11:39:00,17,Went through yesterday and was fine--saw a smaller houseboat go through.Most boats are at Taylor Island (4) or Banana Island (2). Another two up in Japan. Gave some houseboat guys the rest of our minnows and leeches as we headed for home. We got the minnows from guys leaving the previous week. Did the houseboat thing for several years so I know you don't get to buy minnows at the local bait shop mid week. The guy said they usually go up to Foreman and Scaler Lake area but with the $1.49/liter gas prices they cut the trip in half. It cost me $165.00 for 30.5 gallons to fill my boat tank at the Wellington in town last week. Ten cents cheaper per liter in Dryden. Fishing was good with rain every day along with a lot of wind.
1316444,jswinter40,2011-06-09 13:18:00,127,4 house boats on Taylor? wow that sounds crowded. Doesn't make much cents to drive 10+ hours and pay for a house boat to cut your trip in half which would be a couple hundred more split betweeen the houseboat crew?? what area did you fish?
1316560,Dan Jarvi,2011-06-09 18:17:00,17,"I have fished all over. Previously I have kept out of the northern areas of Chamberlain and Bear narrows or towards Scaler/Foreman Lake as it is occupied by too many boats from either the outfitters or houseboats. So I have fished West out in the Pine Point area which is past Mclean Narrows and east into Sen Bay. Ussually put in at Deception Bay. Been going once or twice a year for 33 years so I have got to know at least a few spots. Mostly dependant on wind direction, water temperature and lake level."
1316615,jswinter40,2011-06-09 20:39:00,127,"Dan,by the sounds of it we fish the same exact areas. If we don't take a houseboat we stay at the best western in SL and launch at Deception for teh day and make our way up to the area you described. i have been doing it for 8 years but a couple in our crew have been for 20+. glad to hear you had good luck. i will be there from July 9-16th, can't wait!"
1316736,cuamb,2011-06-10 07:42:00,203,"Thanks for the updates. We head up today and go out on the houseboat tomorrow. Plan to go close to Chamberlain. This will be my 15th year in the area. Found several good spots that are out of the crowd. $1.49/liter. We paid $1.10 last year. What the heck, I am way past the ""happy wife"" factor already."
1316746,jswinter40,2011-06-10 08:06:00,127,"cuamb,Have fun and good luck. we will be awaiting your report. i would think the NE section would be going strong right now."
1316760,falkopat,2011-06-10 08:35:00,44,house boat gas is a $1.67 a liter just got back june 4th. we park near chamberland narrows and burned up 370 liters. have fun dont let the gas prices effect your trip. pat
1316834,cuamb,2011-06-10 11:41:00,203,"Wow, that is expensive. Well I always budget $600 for HB gas so for once I will probably exceed it."
1317213,BenBeattie,2011-06-11 19:20:00,232,Just an FYI.... Saw a big houseboat drive through the Rags today.
1323554,jswinter40,2011-06-28 08:42:00,127,Can I get an update on water levels and whether housboats are going through the RAGS still? east side that is.
1313977,cuamb,2011-06-02 14:26:00,203,Are the shortcuts on the NE side of lac seul open yet for houseboats?
1313982,jswinter40,2011-06-02 14:35:00,127,Sounds like the Rags is open on your way up to the NE side.
1313986,cuamb,2011-06-02 14:45:00,203,"Great, that is the big one.Thanks!"
1314006,BenBeattie,2011-06-02 15:54:00,232,I don't know how much water those houseboats draw but I'd be skeptical of taking one through the rags. My sonar reads 3' even when I'm blowing through there. Beware!
1314044,rnnonmt,2011-06-02 18:34:00,992,"I went and looked at some tracked routes from my GPS over the last few years and found that the lowest ""water elevation"" on my gps while passing through the rags in a 65 ft houseboat was 1168 ft. Minus roughly 8 feet from the height of the GPS antenna above the water line. Watch out for the last stump on the north end. It was missing the aluminum pole that I think I recall was attached to it last year."
1315898,cuamb,2011-06-08 09:15:00,203,Thanks for everyones comments. Anyone been there is the last few days.
1315903,BenBeattie,2011-06-08 09:25:00,232,Water on LS is coming up everyday. I'd be asking the outfitter if guys are taking his houseboats through the rags yet. THey'll know.
1315987,cuamb,2011-06-08 12:20:00,203,Thanks Ben. We hire a pilot so he will know. I was just curious for how long it will take to get where we are headed.
1316015,jswinter40,2011-06-08 13:55:00,127,"cuamb, how far you going up? We generally stay around Taylor Island somewhere and it takes about 4.5 hours to get there with the ""rags"" being open for business."
1316144,cuamb,2011-06-08 20:20:00,203,"Just south of Chamberlain Narrows. Never tried it around Taylor Island. How is the fishing there. Opps, that is probably a different thread."
