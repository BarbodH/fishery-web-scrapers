Border-crossing rules in spotlightBy Will Elliott News Outdoors Writer Published: June 26, 2011, 12:10 AM 1 Comment Font Size: -2-1Standard+1+2E-mailSharePrintFacebookTwitterGoogleRedditDelicious Stumble UponDiggFarkMySpace Related stories Summer reading for the enthusiast New line puts better spin on spinning reels Updated: June 26, 2011, 12:10 AM An arrest and fine of a young boater in St. Lawrence River waters prompted much discussion of procedures for fishing international border waters. On May 30, Roy M. Anderson, 22, a seasonal resident of the Thousand Islands with a non-resident Ontario fishing license, was stopped by Canadian Customs and made to pay a penalty. That incident, and reports in a Watertown and regional paper, prompted area anglers to question proper procedures. A call to the Canada Border Services Agency resulted in some basic assessments of procedures. For decades, area fishermen have crossed into Canadian waters along Lake Erie, the Niagara River and Lake Ontario. Most fishermen understood that to go ashore, anchor in a port, or take any passengers on board, one must contact Canada Customs. But, in fact, agency spokesman Chris Kealey stated that a U.S. vessel can travel through Canadian waters ""in transit"" from one U.S. port to another. But if that vessel stops to go ashore, anchor, or even fish with a current province license, that boater must first report to Canada officials through the Can Pass system. Kealey notes that this reporting system has been in place for at least 25 years as a matter of government security. State and U.S. legislators question this, but,for now, the reporting procedure is in place with possible fines that could be $25,000. For a New York State resident to legally fish in Ontario waters, according to this regulation, one must call (888) CAN PASS (226-7277) before each fishing trip. Some U.S. officials believe this formal procedure, if enforced to the letter, could be damaging to tourism across New York State.
