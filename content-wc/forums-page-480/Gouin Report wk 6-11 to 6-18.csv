On the hot/calm day’s the fish turned off but the cloudy day’s fishing was very good. My group of four had no problem bring back 8 walleye per man which ranged from 15” to 21”. We caught hundreds of smaller walleye and northern pike. Largest pike was in the 30” range & about 8-10 lbs.I stayed at Pointe-aux-Dorés which is a very nice fishing camp. Cabins were well equipped and very clean. Pauline & Roger very friendly and provided maps of many fishing locations to try. All cabins had stringers of fish each day at the fish cleaning house. I will definitely return to this camp in the future.Water levels are up from last year…nearly at maximum pool height. Black flies were few & the road from Parent in great condition.http://i943.photobucket.com/albums/a...1/IMG_0514.jpghttp://i943.photobucket.com/albums/a...1/IMG_0512.jpg"

I also had good luck with Gulp Alive 3"" minnows on 1/4 oz black jig head.Fish will move deeper as the water warms though. Good luck."
