1324853,v-bay gord,2011-07-01 11:38:00,3168,This is the BEST way I have found to cook a roast...beef or venison (sorry I have not tried elk...yet). The recipe is for a 3-4 pound roast so adjust accordingly. 1 cup red wine 1.5 tsp. salt 10 whole peppercorns 1.5 tbsp. brown sugar 2 bay leaves 1/2 tsp. dried sage Put the roast in a casserole dish ( I use a heavy cast iron pot with a lid) and add the other ingredients....cover with a tight fitting lid. Cook for 4 hours at 275 degrees. Remove from heat and let meat sit in the liquid for 1 hour before serving. This is so simple and yet so good........I think the slow cooking and the resting part really makes it a great recipe.
1324857,camp chef,2011-07-01 11:46:00,915,Salt. pepper and garlic powder rub generously and put on high grill to create a char or crust around the whole roast. Depending how big it is you may need to move to a cooler part of the grill after you have sealed in all the juices with the crust. You want the inside to be 130 to 135 degrees for rare to medium Rare. Slice thin and enjoy
1324912,whittsend,2011-07-01 13:57:00,14,"It doesn't much matter how you cook it, as long as you don't OVERCOOK it. Keep in mind that the meat will continue to ""cook"" after pulling it from the oven/grill, etc... Consider pulling the meat when the internal temp is anywhere from 118 degrees to about 125 degrees, depending on size of the meat (larger/thicker cuts = pull sooner). Let it rest under a tinfoil tent for 20+ minutes and DON'T CUT INTO IT UNTIL AFTER THE REST to let the juices ""redistribute""!!! This will give a very nice rare/med rare cut of meat which will top out at 130 to 135 degrees. (When cooking my 14lb Xmas prime ribs, I always pull the meat at 118 degrees) Salt/pepper/mushrooms... Enjoy!"
1324916,whittsend,2011-07-01 14:08:00,14,"BTW, I'm a big fan of low and slow cooking... 200 to 250 degrees until internal temp is reached. Takes longer, but if you like your meat mostly med rare (and not well done on the outside and rare in the middle), the low/slow method will give you much more consitant cooking throughout the cut."

1324979,whittsend,2011-07-01 17:10:00,14,"If you want it cooked ""through til tender"", your method of braising sounds excellent for sure. Longer cooking times to get fall apart roast can't be beat. However, if you happen to want it more steak-like (if you happen to be usuing a good t-loin cut as your ""roast"" and would prefer it rare / med. rare), then I HIGHLY recommend using some sort of meat thermometer to gauge ""doneness"". Guessing just doesn't cut it. Just depends on your cut of meat and how you want to enjoy what God provided for your table."
