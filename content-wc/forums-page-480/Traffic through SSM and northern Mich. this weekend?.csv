We typically were through this area by noon, but we will be leaving the Ohio/Michigan border area around 4pm and driving through the night. We have never left this late before, and I have heard that traffic getting to and across the Mackinac bridge can be a real bear on a holiday weekend. Our current schedule has us getting to Mackinac around 9-10pm this Friday night and crossing into Canada around 11pm-midnight. We have budgeted an extra 3 hours to deal with traffic, customs, and other unforseens. This Friday is also Canada day, which could also add to the headaches...Is this enough extra time? Or should we try to leave even earlier? Thanks in advance for any advice..."
1323979,TIGHTLINER,2011-06-29 09:37:00,223,On our way up we went thru around 5 am no cars in line went right thru. Coming back we hit the rush hour traffic at 4:30 pm we were backed up on the bride for over 1 hour that is with all the booths open. I would say you should not have more than a 15 min wait going thru at those times vacations are on now so that could add to the lines. If you have xm radio look for the canadian station for news weather and they will give the wait times at the crossings just before they do the news again. Its canada 360 on xm 155 .. Good luck
