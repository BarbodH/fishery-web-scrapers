1324282,champ8,2011-06-29 21:11:00,40,Finally heading up to LOW this weekend via Baudette/Rainy River. Is there a grocery store in Rainy River? Went through there a couple of years ago and could not locate one. Need to find a place to stock up on some tators to go with that fresh walleye shore lunch! Thanks.
