1323542,Mike Kansas,2011-06-28 08:16:00,1463,"Gapwedge, Sorry I didn't reply earlier. If I wanted to catch Smallies next month I would go to Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul and fish. There are a ton of small bays with rock and stump structure close to Lost Island. Small cranks,v spinnerbaits andtexas rigged plastic should make the day for you. Shane that runs the Lodge will give you lots of help."
1323547,Aaron-IN,2011-06-28 08:24:00,500,"If you are after smallmouth you can't beat the Winnipeg River System around Minaki, in my opinion anyway, and I've fished all over the place up there for smallmouth."
1323616,Steve Ediger,2011-06-28 11:04:00,97,To answer your original question - you may be right on target. Next month there should be plenty of weed beds and you won't find a better lake for walleye than Lac Seul. Pike will also be fun for your son. I suggest Lac Seul Lodge. It's a good clean lodge in the middle area of Lac Seul. Call Dan and see if he can help you out. Steve
1320930,Mike Kansas,2011-06-21 12:53:00,1463,"During the last 10 years the Smallmouth fishing on Lac Seul has gotten better every year. When we first strated catching Smallies they would run 10"" to 13"". Last week we had one morning that we went Smallie fishing and two of us caught over 40 Smallies ranging between 17"" and 19.5"". I looked each one over to see if Joe Montana had autographed them because they were as fat as footballs. Anyone else experiencing this on Lac Seul and if so what is your biggest Smallie? Mike Kansas"
1320958,Knoxabilly,2011-06-21 14:02:00,225,"Hey Mike, what section of Lac Seul. I always fish the Ear Falls area, we used to never catch them. I have noticed us catching more and more of them in the last 5 years I would say. Never fishing for them specifically but getting them while Walleye fishing and sometime Northern fishing. The lodge owners treat them like carp saying they are a ""trash"" fish haha I like catching them. I wouldn't mind targetting them more if people are actually getting into them."
1320970,Mike Kansas,2011-06-21 14:37:00,1463,Catching them in McIntyre Bay which is SW of Windigo Point. Best luck on V Spinner Baits with double willowleaf Silver or Gold blades in Char or White skirts. Seem to do better on sunny days rather than cloudy days. Rock banks produced good for us. Have to cast as close to shore as you can...they seem to be shore huggers. Mike Kansas
1320974,wallydave,2011-06-21 14:41:00,2151,"I have fished the NW end of LS for over ten years, this was the first year Andrea at Goose Bay, marked smallies on the map she provides. This year the walleye bite was slow, 6/4-6/10, so we spent most of our time finding the walleyes, if we could have stayed longer or the walleyes been biting like crazy we could have tried the smallie spots. It would be great if the smallies became another fish to target, so many fish so little time!"
1321169,rnnonmt,2011-06-21 22:28:00,992,"We fish the NE section around chamberlain. We too have seen more smallies each year averaging around the 16 to 18"" size. Find the average size rock shore lines and cast just about anything. They have been hitting jigs tipped with minnows while trolling for walleye. Last year we caught a few dozen with our biggest at 19"""
1321548,Steve Ediger,2011-06-22 20:08:00,97,"Hey Mike, Sorry I didn't run into you last week. We didn't make it to the Black Bay area until yesterday. We went to Aldous Bay and killed the walleye - best walleye day since we've been here. We catch a lot of smallmouth in the South Inlet and you are right, it is rare to get one under 16"" and they all look like they are on steroids. Caught a 20"" in Ratt Bay on Monday. I mainly use a jig and grub or a #3 Mepps Spinner. I have been coming to Lac Seul for the last 14 years and I have never seen weather like the past ten days. The wind has been out of the east every day and is forecast to do the same tomorrow. The fishing has been good, numbers may be down but more big fish. Two days left before I head back to Kansas but will be back up the last week of July - can't wait. Steve"
1321588,ogassuk,2011-06-22 21:46:00,2,you're right about the weather!!!it's been blwinmg from the east for over a week...fishing somewhat down in the Vaughn Lake area of Lac Seul where I have guests fishing out of my camp...I don't know if it's the weather or something else.
1321605,gapwedge,2011-06-23 00:15:00,19,"This is an interesting thread to me. I'm looking to take my son on a trip next month. I like eating walleye, but enjoy fishing for bass more. I realize that this will be regarded as blasphemy on this board, but what can I tell you ... I'm a heathen.If the smallie fishing is really good, maybe Lac Seul is the best choice for us.Are there weed beds that hold bass in LS? Texas rigging plastics in lilly pads and other weeds is a particular fav of mine. I also like surface fishing for bass in the evening.Is there a particular area of LS that is best for bass? I am not familiar with many of the names that get thrown around specifying specific areas of the lake, but I have looked at maps of the area and am familiar with the Ear Falls Sioux Lookout areas.Thoughts and opinions are appreciated."
1323463,gapwedge,2011-06-28 00:02:00,19,Hoping for a reply.
1323477,Iowa Hawkeye,2011-06-28 04:47:00,90,"I don't think there is much for lily pads as these are small mouth bass, and they like the shore lines with smaller rocks. For baits they like small and shiny, but we caught them on minnows before. The Taylor Island area was always a good smallie area but sounds like they are many places now. Taylor Island is north of Hudson or west of Sioux Lookout. Call Lost Island Lodge they are near the area. The smallies are a blast to catch, fight like crazy, Good Luck"
