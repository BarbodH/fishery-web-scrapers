We were supposed to leave for Manitoba on the 22nd, but my fishing partner ruptured his Achilles' this week and goes in for surgery today. Obviously he won't be in any shape for a trip. Holding out hope that we might be able to make something happen in August, but the prospects are slim. All of you going this year, enjoy your trip. And remember that these experiences are special (even if the fishing isn't spectacular) and can be taken away quickly by unexpected circumstances. SPTRIX"
1316694,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2011-06-10 06:13:00,629,"Sptrix:I can relate to your feelings, as I have had a similar circumstancemyself this season. My wife & I are fortunate enough to have asummer facility on the South Shore of Lake of the Woods. For the past 11 seasons we have called it our 2nd home. This yr. I fell &received a significant concussion that has taken 5 weeks to heal.I would have normally left for the summer on the 2nd wk. of May.So, I have missed the 1st month of fishing this year, but got a greenlight by the doctors to go North anytime now. Waiting to heal has been as frustrating as the injury itself! Leaving Sunday! Hope you can get something worked for this season, because as you say, ""There is something special about being Up North!"" Set the hook, CRJohn"
1316708,cruiseforever,2011-06-10 06:45:00,177,I also know the feeling. It's been 5-6 years since I have been to Canada. It's been very hard to get a group together. This year I am going alone. Leave in two weeks. Looking forward to it. Hope you can get something to work.

1323864,Manitou,2011-06-28 21:15:00,125,"For those interested in Manitoba, or hooking up with locals, we have a website:http://www.manitobaanglers.com/Forums.htmlYou might have to sign up to get in, IIRC.There is a section of the forum called ""Invite an Angler"""
1323938,Bigfishhunter,2011-06-29 07:59:00,803,"There are better fishing forums than the one listed above. Maybe not as much traffic but it is called manitoba - argurers.com for a reason. Basically just a bunch of winnipegers who never leave the city,. xtremesportfishing.com is a much better site (especially if you are interested in the north) and all the guys on there are hardcore anglers who share info and never bash another individual."
1323986,Bigfishhunter,2011-06-29 09:59:00,803,On another note. Sorry to hear about your cancelled trip sptrix I always enjoy your trip reports on the other forum. You guys do a pretty hardcore trip and I am sure that right now you are even missing that crazy road you drive down to finally get to the lake.
