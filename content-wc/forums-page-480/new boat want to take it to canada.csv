1323642,Mark R,2011-06-28 12:05:00,1538,"I would go to Lac Suel Evergreen Lodge. We have a group of 6 guys that go every year for the last 15 years or so. Very nice place and the owners, Pat & Gary, are very cordial."
1323656,teddi,2011-06-28 12:42:00,349,i second that.
1323771,CI_Guy,2011-06-28 17:00:00,2118,"Bower's Frog Rapids at Sioux Lookout. Access to Abrams, Pelican and Minitaki Lakes. Just a short drive to Lac Suel."
1323778,bigwalleye1,2011-06-28 17:19:00,2632,"+1 for Frog Rapids. Been there once this year, going again in a couple weeks. Easy access to 3 lakes from the dock, and trailering to Lac Seul if you want even bigger water or more wilderness. The Bowers will treat you right."
1323795,luv2fishcanada,2011-06-28 17:58:00,41,Check out Golden Hook Camp on Gullrock. I have been going there 25 years. Golden Hook has very nice docks and slips for your boat. It is a great Walleye lake.
1323806,rnnonmt,2011-06-28 18:30:00,992,What's your budget? Seeing you just bought a boat..... Love Lac Seul!
1323819,ftfarms,2011-06-28 19:06:00,444,I have fished several lakes in ontario and lac seul would be on the top. But u need to think about how far u want to travel every day on where u stay and what time of year u are there. There are some rocks not marked all over that lake. I will be fishing around perrault falls in august and see alot of boats from up by ear falls that time of year.

Excellent facilities, premier customer service, and . . . your new Classic will be docked in a protected area off the main lake so you don't have to worry about the overnight storms and wind. They'll help you get on the 'eyes, too."
