1324696,jkrawchu,2011-07-01 01:11:00,26,"Rod,Thanks we will be in touch Thursday night. Thanks!"
1324709,teddi,2011-07-01 05:09:00,349,the camping cabins are quite nice and the rates are reasonable. the are set up for 2 or 3 people. good fishing can be had within 10 miniutes of camp. call patty and i am sure she can set you up with some thing for this summer.
1324782,King Canada,2011-07-01 08:18:00,27,Thanks Teddi that's what I wanted to hear. This trip will be just my youngest daughter (23) and I.
1324851,teddi,2011-07-01 11:34:00,349,just talked to patty and she said she will set you up with some thing. went out this morning and 8 walleyes in an hour and a half. nothing big but good eaters.
1322745,dynamite,2011-06-26 07:02:00,20,"Stayed at Goose Bay last week and fished all over the lake. Winds out of the east Sat-Wed. at 15Km gusting to 35Km. Fishing was very tough for all. Best luck was 8-11a.m. then things shut down after this. Best luck was Mekenzie Bay. Problem was getting there and back with the winds. Nothing at Big and Little Sand banks. Hit a unmarked bar in Makenzie Bay and lost my Skag, but was lucky as another in camp hit the same and recked lower unit totally. Another lost a skag in Shanty Narrows. Still caught many over slot and in slot, but had to work hard. That is fishing!"
1322765,greg2648,2011-06-26 08:23:00,80,"TNT, Did you fish Broad or Sunlight? South Inlet? Any particuliar color working best? Any night fishing? We be there on 7/9. Thanks, Greg."
1322770,bigtimeelectric,2011-06-26 08:44:00,174,"wow thats tough. can you explain where that unmarked bar is? I'm guessing when you came out of the narrows you hugged the shoreline on the left hand side down to the sand banks? we are heading up on the 4th and the spots I like to fish are best with a west wind, I pray we don't get any east. thanks for posting"
1322836,teddi,2011-06-26 12:02:00,349,leeches out fished minnows last week two to one. at least on the ear falls end. this week it seems to be leeches or night crawlers are the answer. fish slow and in 10 to 15 feet of water. just my personal observations so far this week.
1322938,dynamite,2011-06-26 18:50:00,20,"We did not fish broad or sunlite as the water is low and there are issues getting in. The bar in Makienze is in the middle of the last 2 islands. On the camp map it is under the N. I think it is marked on the Canadian Navionics chip according to others, but the resort owners did not know aout it. We also had the benefit of post mayfly hatch. Slow"
1323056,jiggster,2011-06-27 08:01:00,183,Is the mayfly hatch by Ear Falls just ending?
1323129,Steve Ediger,2011-06-27 11:07:00,97,The mayfly hatch was just getting started on Friday 6/24/11.
1324200,bigtimeelectric,2011-06-29 18:10:00,174,leaving monday boys any new news?is steamboat producing yet? big sand banks?
1324243,jkrawchu,2011-06-29 19:58:00,26,A group of us are heading up next Thursday to Ear Falls and Evergreen Lodge. Does anyone have any fishing updates? Thanks
