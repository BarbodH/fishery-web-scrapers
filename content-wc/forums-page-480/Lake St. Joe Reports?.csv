1324188,Guest,2011-06-29 17:30:00,0,The Winoga Outpost is right in the heart of some of the best fishing on the lake. We'll be arriving at The Old Post on Saturday so I'm sure we'll se you out there. Look for a white Lund and stop by.
1324260,Guest,2011-06-29 20:23:00,0,"Ok, now you guys have me even more pumped. I guess my fear of packing too much for his boat has now vanished. I've heard from several people that the particular area we are staying is good for fishing. All packed, now just have to wait until Friday AM for the trip north."
1324393,IaDave,2011-06-30 08:16:00,476,What e-mail address did you use?

1324409,Guest,2011-06-30 08:50:00,0,"I should mention, I think his website mentions that they prefer phone during the summer months."
1324414,IaDave,2011-06-30 09:04:00,476,"Thanks- I will call. When you see Dick tell him Dave from Cedar Rapids,Ia says hi and I will be calling him concerning St. Joe. He should remember me from all the times I stayed at his island camp. Tell him if I can get 4 it won't be the knuckleheads that came up last yr with me. He will appreciate that I'm sure."
1323112,Guest,2011-06-27 10:47:00,0,"Any Lake St. Joe reports? After reading the older reports on this forum, I have decided that I am not taking live bait and will rely on jigs/twisters for the walleyes. I hope I'm making a good decision. Would love to hear from others that have recently returned from Lake St. Joe."
1323669,Guest,2011-06-28 13:18:00,0,"You will get all the fish you want on St. Joe without live bait. If you caught more fish there with live bait I just don't think it would be worth the effort. We just got back 6/25 from Lake St. Joe. The fishing was the best I recall in years. The majority of the Walleyes were in the 16-20"" range with very few small ones. Largest walleye was 27"". Largest Northern was 41"". These were all caught on 3/8 jig with Gulp or twister, no live bait. We pitch or drift with jigs 98% of the time but also got walleye while trolling dare devils around the bay where the 41"" northern was caught on a jig. We caught walleye in 4-24'. They may have been deeper also but 24' is as deep as we fished. Probably most were caught in 10-18'. I just got the i-pilot this year and am really sold on the anchor feature. I got a fish in 16-18' off a rock pile, set the anchor on the i-pilot and it was like pulling fish from a barrel just fishing right below the boat. I tried to call over the other boat to join us but they were having too much fun on there own rock pile. There was a big forest fire (Sioux Lookout 35) going on while we were there. http://www.tbnewswatch.com/news/1524...x-35-rages-on- Several days the smoke was like fog, you couldn't see across the lake, and ash fell like snow. It's up to 162,000 acres so far. When we left 6/25 the road was closed north of the boat landing. Sorry for the long answer but I just had to ramble about what a great trip we had. One of the new guys was skeptical at first about just tossing out 3/8 jig and plastic. At the end he was amazed at the quantity and quality of the fish caught and agreed: Why mess with live bait?"
1324030,Guest,2011-06-29 11:40:00,0,"My wife and I will be leaving Friday morning for St. Joe. Can't wait! I've been fishing there for 15 years and it never ceases to amaze. Most of the fish will be in the 10' - 20 ' depth range. There are lots of good spots around Sand Island and in Brodribb to find fish. Jigs/twister tails are really all that is required. I usually take some worms just in case things slow down some. Of course, if the walleye are slow there's lots of pike too."
1324045,Guest,2011-06-29 12:16:00,0,Thank you for the replys. I'm very excited to try fishing this lake for the first time after hearing so many good reports.
1324106,Guest,2011-06-29 14:01:00,0,Where are you staying and when?
1324117,Guest,2011-06-29 14:19:00,0,Staying this Saturday to Saturday at the Winoga outpost. Taking 4 people with me that like to fish but don't do it very often. Outfitting the whole crew and will have my hands full but should be a good time. It appears that we are in for a real treat and I'm excited to see their reaction as newbies Canadian fishing. I traditionally do flyins out of Red Lake so this size of a lake is kinda new for me as well.
1324144,IaDave,2011-06-29 15:32:00,476,Let us know how you do- I'm very interested in trying Winoga's outpost. Are you flying in or boating in? Dick told me you needed 6 for the boat in. Also- I would mind knowing what he charges.
1324149,Guest,2011-06-29 15:44:00,0,I will let you know how we do. We are boating in. We had one member back out. I contact Dick via e-mail and he was more than helpful with all the questions that I had.
1324160,IaDave,2011-06-29 16:09:00,476,Wait till you see the boat/barge you go in on. I have stayed at his main camp many times. It looks like a D-Day landing craft. I think the ride on that would be worth half the price he charges. If I remember it had 2-250HP Mercs on the back. I think he said he could l go 60 mph empty.
1324165,tooski,2011-06-29 16:21:00,393,"He was doing 60 with four of us, all our gear, and three of his friends. He ties the string from that Aussie hat around his chin and your off."
