1323651,Mike Kansas,2011-06-28 12:34:00,1463,Headed for Lost Island on Thursday. This is the trip with the wives. We hire a Guide and it is our 6th year with him. He puts us on a bunch of fish every year. Five of us have had many 400++ Walleye days with him. The wives love it. When the wife is happy life is GOOD. Mike Kansas

Tell Basel the deer are still over-running the place up here, eating all my apples. Many of the best times in our lives were spent at Lost Island with Jim, Marlene, Basel, Vivian, Shane and Chris. Miss them all, will be up there one of these years."
