Boated 216 fish w/ 2 guys in 6 days..fished Vermillion Bay and Canoe Narrows almost exclusively...fish not on structure yet...walleyes were weed orientated...8 to 12 feet...off weeds 12 down to 24 feet...mainly a jig show...sometimes 1/8 and sometimes 1/4 but for sure round jig style dominated show...baits varied from crawlers; leeches and minnows and a couple days 'eyes changed bait preference mid-day on us...one day we fished a group on a slide in Canoe Narrows 45 minutes w/ 1/8 ounce jig and crawler or leech; I switched to 1/4 round jig and minnow / we caught 19 fish in 2 hours...round head jig...stayed at Cedar Point Lodge...great facility...dock hands were all over us when our boat pulled in...never asked for anything twice w/ those boys....we gave 'em a nice tip at end of week...one more thing...we dogged the fish and stayed close to them...never leave fish to find fish...after catching or share of 15 to 17 inch 'eyes we'd move either deeper or down the shoreline and find larger fish...biggest ones were 26 and my brother landed a 28"" eye'...everning bite from 500pm to 930pm waz' best all week long...best day was 49...worst day was 13 but that included the 28"" fish caught around 900pm in the ""soup bowl"" near mouth to west arm...in summary, stay near the fish and move deeper for bigger ones...use 1/4 or larger jigs if they ignore 1/8...switch baits often if you are on fish but getting no bites...good luck on Eagle Lake...it is a great paradise to fish....the 4 other guys in our group also caught near 200 fish per boat each...largest for week was a 29"" which came off Sunset Island in 28 foot of water in early mornin' hours...over and out...."
