1323559,CH47,2011-06-28 08:52:00,29,"We were just there last week (fished out of Mahkwa) and started seeing them about midweek so I would say it's just getting started. Didn't seem to affect the fishing much other than the walleye were really hugging the bottom. If you weren't getting your bait to hit bottom, you weren't catching fish."
1323641,Guest,2011-06-28 12:04:00,0,We just returned from a fly-out trip north of Red Lake and the mayfly hatch was pretty heavy last week on the two lakes we fished.
1323659,eyecatchin,2011-06-28 12:45:00,118,How does the mayfly hatch affect the walleye fishing? I noticed we are getting a few flying around here.
1323823,rnnonmt,2011-06-28 19:11:00,992,"No scientific data here.... just what I have seen over the years. The walleye bite turns off during the hatch. stomach contents are loaded with mayfly. Not to mention every square inch of your boat and gear is covered with them. Consider it to be ""mayfly camo!"""
1323834,ILScott,2011-06-28 19:40:00,139,"My best week of fishing in Canada was during a mayfly hatch. We were there at the beginning of it and I think that is when the walleye eat non stop. We used a spinner rig with a little piece of worm. Caught many walleye over 22"" and largest at 29 1/2. Just have to adapt to catch them."
1323848,BenBeattie,2011-06-28 20:30:00,232,"It is starting here over the last few days. Seeing the casings (nymph shells?) on the surface now. Fishing is still good, getting fish both shallow (10 ft) and deep (20+). Follow the wind!"
1323859,Manitou,2011-06-28 20:56:00,125,Leeches seem to work OK during a hatch up here.
1323891,SeulAreaWalleye,2011-06-28 23:19:00,100,"Had 7 guests burn through 43 dozen minnows in 7 hours fishing, 2 weeks ago on Pelican Lake in Sioux Lookout in about 4 ft of water. Open the bail, get a fish, all sizes....ridiculous. Mayfly is the BEST fishing of the year. Shallow nymphs have risen, deep are rising. Beat the hatch by finding a back bay area that does not look anything like a typical walleye spot.....after seeing this kind of action, and regularly having over 100 fish days, I have realized that the walleye will never run out here. Thank you 18-21"" slot size!"
1324040,Guest,2011-06-29 12:01:00,0,"I can only report what we experienced, but on a portage lake we were on the fishing was just non-stop for two days before the mayfly hatch. Action slowed down considerably after 2-3 days of heavy hatches. The walleye's we did catch were just loaded with mayflies and they were spitting them up at the boat. They sure looked good and plump like you see before the spring spawn or late fall action. We consider ourselves to be pretty good fishermen and we did try changing tactics and switched from gulp (leaches/minnows) and used crawlers on spinners and jigs and also tried slower presentations..We even gave slip bobbers and other gulp/plastic baits a try without a lot of success. The portage lake was not very large and we pretty much fished the whole lake on two other occassions after the hatch. Could be we just never found the right presentation?? Other guys have reported different experiences, but at least for us, we assumed the walleye bite on this body of water had been negatively impacted by the hatch. I agree though that you have to just keep plugging away until you find something that does work."
