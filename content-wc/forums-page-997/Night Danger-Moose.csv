514667,Guest,2001-08-28 17:21:00,0,We stayed on Stergeon Lake and fish other lakes in the area as well. I've been up there twice now and plan on going again.
514670,Guest,2001-08-28 19:10:00,0,ROFLMAO!!!! Your going that way at night? I say the over/under on moose sightings should be around 15. Drive slowly!
514668,Roger B,2001-08-29 06:38:00,4,"Treeguy,Thanks for the reply. We have done the same thing since 1981. We normally stay at Angler's Cove Resort. Do you have an e-mail address?Roger B"
514663,GregK,2001-08-29 07:23:00,113,"Dave: If your job is screwing up your fishing, quit! Don't they know the reason you have the job is to buy minnows? You can not have nonsense like that interfering with THE trip of the year."
514671,Wenty,2001-08-29 12:27:00,15,"I saw what a moose did to a Ford F-150 once east of Upsala. Not pretty. The moose won. If you have to drive at night, and I always avoid it, you better have a bunch of peeled eyeballs. Spend the night in a motel. Get a good nights rest and you'll be fresh for the morning drive and some fishing. Have fun."
514672,Karl,2001-08-31 22:17:00,63,"Moose, unlike deer, will NOT jump out in front of your vehicle, they walk out instead. Point? Slow down and you won't have any problems with moose on 502 at night. Other guy is right about bears though, they will dash across in front of you."
514673,Guest,2001-09-04 10:40:00,0,"Even if you are fortunate enough to miss one tthere will still be some clean-up involved. Those buggers carry about two gallons of spit in their mouth and don't mind leaving most of it on your vehicle!About five years ago we narrowly missed one who just walked right out in front of us. We came to a squeeling halt, he did a 180 right in front of us. As he turned, all we could do was sit helplessly and watch as this big stringly wave of moose drool flew right at us. SPUH-LOOSH! Covered the entire windshield! As if the 800 million dead bug bodies weren't enough, we had to deal with greasey moose spit too! They don't make a wiper fluid powerful enough to cut through that!"
514657,Dave,2001-08-27 05:30:00,258,We have always traveled in Canada during daylight or dawn conditions. This Sept will be the first time it will be night.How bad are the moose on the roads. We will be taking 502 toDryden and then on to Sioux Lookout.
514658,Larry S,2001-08-27 08:00:00,666,"In 1991 on Memorial Day,I was returning with a friend from a fishing trip to Ontario.We were between Virginia and Duluth Minnesota on Hwy 53 at 1000pm at night when a moose jumped on the road about 20 ft in front of us.I swerved to avoid hitting it,but caught the moose on the front right side of the car.The car ended up totaled,my friend broke his arm and wrist,I had about a thousand pieces of glass in my face.If we were not wearing our seat belts we would most likely be seriously injured or even dead.So BE CAREFUL while driving at night"
514659,Darren B,2001-08-27 10:09:00,13,"Yeah, you might want to take it easy and be extremely alert. Its not only moose that get in the way..but also plenty of bears seem to jump out on 502 when you least expect them. We see a lot more of them than we do the mooses. (mooses?)Each trip to Canda over the last 10 years for us has resulted in at least 1 or 2 animals spotted on the roads, including a huge moose that one year, had he not jumped out of the way would have totaled the front end of our truck. Because of this, whenever going to Canada we usually try and time it so we get to the Ft Frances border at first light."
514660,Dave,2001-08-27 11:53:00,258,Thanks for your help. We will make sure we fill up the thermos at the Falls.
514661,GregK,2001-08-27 13:18:00,113,"Oh boy Dave! 502 is warning signs for moose from one end to the other. It it also a narrow winding road. If one walks out into the road you are going to have a very difficult time missing it.I know walleye mania knows no bounds. I'm leaving myself Friday morning. Before you go up the sucker at night please consider the following:1. There are lots of moose, bear and deer.2. The road is narrow and curvy.3. Moose do not run away, they stand there and look at you.4. Most moose/auto collisions result in fatalities. (I'm not talking about the moose either)5. 502 is perhaps one of the most beautiful drives ever. Missing that scenery at night would be a crime.6. The road is not heavily traveled and at night there are very few cars. There is no gas station or anything else for that matter between Ft. Francis and Dryden.7. My advice would be to stay overnight in Ft. Francis at La Place De Rendesvous 807-274-9811. No, I have no affiliation with this place, it's just a nice motel with reasonable rates."
514664,Guest,2001-08-27 14:25:00,0,"Dave,I got back from Canada last week. We traveled from Ignance to Savant Lake on hwy 599 in the dark. We avoided one moose. Luckily we spotted it on the shoulder and were able to slow down in time. This road is relatively straight in comparison to 502 though. We also noticed all the logging trucks and local pickups had large spotlights mounted on top of their vehicles, presumably for the moose. If you decide to travel at night, take your time. You'll get there eventually. 502 takes forever anyway."
514665,Guest,2001-08-27 14:40:00,0,"The wildlife in that area must be doing well. I am a travelling rep and that one corner of Ontario I seem to see more wildlife along the road each passing season. Of course the one moose I didnt see in time sure frightened me. Made a small mess of my trucks front end. It was hit at noon, so caution should be advised at all times. Posted speeds of 80 or 90 are there partially because of the hazards. One think I will never forget though is the way the moose looked at me just before it was hit. I have never seen such a dumb expression on an animals face. It was something I will always remember. Made Bullwinkle look like a brain surgeon.WW"
514666,Roger B,2001-08-27 14:48:00,4,"Treeguy,Saw on your answer to the moose question that you go up toward Savant Lake to fish. We've been going up that way for the past 20 years. Where do you go?Roger B."
514662,Dave,2001-08-27 15:15:00,258,"If I had my way we would stay overnite but because of the lack of vacation days at work we need to drive all night. If we leave after work on a Friday we can be at the boat landing at sunrise.Now, if I would have won the Powerball Lottery last weekend Iwouldn't have to worry about the D--- moose. Thnks for your advice. We will just make sure we have a full tank of gas and take it slow."
514669,Frank from TBay,2001-08-27 18:20:00,312,Moose are very unpredictable. Travel with the high beams on all the time when ever possible and do not let your passengers sleep. Have at least one of them up front with you and another set of eyes. It really helps. Take it real easy. I have had extremely close calls with these critters and my bud hit one. They were only slightly injured but every year people die up here. I try not to travel at night if at all possible.
