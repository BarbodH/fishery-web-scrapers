514716,Guest,2001-08-29 08:36:00,0,"Just got back from an incredible lodge in Northern Ontario (WayNorth Lodge, more about that on another thread) and I am already trying to plan next years adventure. After talking to a few people I am thinking of moving the trip from August to either June or September. June has (I am assuming) more rain, bugs, people in camp, and lean hungry fish than August or September.September has (again assuming), colder weather, rain?? (don't know yet), less to no bugs, less people in camp, and fat hungry fish.Just wondering, since I have only been that far north once in June...and at the tail end at that, and never in September, which is better? August has always treated us well...one or two days of rain, tolerable bugs (as if they ever are), and decent fishing. But not the rediculous numbers of fish I hear about in June or September. Just wanted to get the low down. Thanks."
514717,redbeard,2001-08-29 13:41:00,34,"Can't tell you about Sept. But our trip at the end of May was TERRIFIC!!! Came back June 2nd. so it quallifies as a ""June"" trip. Lots & lots of fish maybe not as big as some but we pulled 'em in up to 26"" & 8 1/4 lb. 4 guys pulled in over 350 fish ( most walleye) on our best day. Bugs were minimal. Maybe to early? Weather was great for us but I heared the weeks before & after were pretty rainy. good luck whenever you go up!"
514718,Guest,2001-08-29 16:59:00,0,"Have had many fly-in trips to Ontario and my favorite time to catch fish has been the first week of July. In June ,early June I have had black flys and mosquitos to deal with,in July usually only mosquitos at dark. In June have had the post spawn thing to deal with and the fish are not really on a predictable pattern although I have at times got plenty. Also in June you have the mayflies to consider.In June I ran into more storms and unsettled weather. In August the water has warmed up and the fish are usually deeper. My August trips usually had good weather and usually 3 or 4 of the 7 days I have really caught fish. As for the first week of July I have found the fish in large numbers not as deep as August. Also I believe the amount of forage is not as plentiful the first of July as the first of August. The above is my humble opinion and observations of 30 plus trips to Ontario. Good Luck!!"
514719,Reels,2001-08-29 17:01:00,2876,"I like June better. Fish are shallower, run bigger as an average and have a great chance at a Hog. Check out the 10lb club and see when most of the hogs are caught. (Not sure myself)I kinda like the unstable weather. Fronts moving in and out, barometer going nuts, fishing can be great.I have gone September's also,and it has been hit or miss. Real good, or so so. Fish are generally deeper and have to adapt incase they are really deep. We have been up there fishing in 60', but it depends on the year. We actually have had snow in September a couple of times.Either was you will have a great time. Canada is great both times of the year."
514720,Guest,2001-08-29 20:26:00,0,"Drew, The real issues here are fish and black flies - not mosquitos and weather --- right ?? I can't speak for September but wish I could. Where we have been going you would rarely have to put on ANY repellant before mid-June unless you were standing in a swamp or there was an early heat wave. We have been going (years past) from the opener (mid may) until mid-June. The one year we had flies was when we went south and stayed in the Chapleau area and that was the worst fishing trip I ever had. As you know we came out of Favourable in mid June this year (and it was a warm wet spring) and the flies were just starting to feed. I don't think that the black fly frenzie will move any closer to May unless there is some serious annual measurable global warming. In response to BILL he must be fishing south of Favourable to encounter the bug life he is talking about. Also in response to BILL - ""Jack"" from Mocassin Trails ALWAYS takes his personal trip (w/ friends) over the 4th of July, in the far north, and never has a problem with bugs and always CPR'S a handful of trophy gators and eyes. In response to Reels, we have had blizzards in May, June, and July (up there) so the weather thing is touch and go. All said, Having to plan darn near a year in advance I would say the spring is best; BUT if there was room to experiment I certainly would be in on the fall ""hunt"". lobo The fish ARE ""hungry"" in the spring; I have read they are also ""hungry"" in the fall. I have experienced no spring bugs and read aboput no fall bugs. I don't think that the fish or bugs will decide this issue - your group will."
514721,Guest,2001-08-29 20:44:00,0,"Lobo, Would you call catching 24 walleye between 21 and 24 inches in less than one hour good fishing? We had one spell where we didn't catch a fish under 21 inches and had to move to get some walleye under 18 inches to eat. And were are not going to Chapleau either . Been there- do that too!!"
514722,Guest,2001-08-30 07:26:00,0,"Bill,I would consider that good fishing, very good ! We run into that ""problem"" too, a reel bummer eh !!I was not knocking July fishing - I just didn't write what I was trying to say.The guy I mentioned in my post ""Jack"" is an outfitter, he can and does go whenever he wants, wherever he wants. He opens a couple new camps every year. My point was actually meant to reinforce your choice for July. Having the options of going whenever and wherever he wants, Jack's preference is the 4th of July week.Everybody has a preference. Myself, I just try to miss the black fly feeding frenzy and get up there as soon as possible to get my ""fix"". I have heard of others that mainly want trophy pike and look to go as late in the year as possible (I would like to try this sometime).Lobo"
514723,Guest,2001-08-30 08:27:00,0,Lobo I too would like to get into BIG pike sometime. Thinking of going somewhere next Sept. for pike. The place that I go I catch EXTRA nice walleye but in three weeks of fishing there I have not caught a pike over 30 inches. How late in Sept. would you go? Last week of Sept???? The outfitter I go with said many of the biggest pike for the year are caught during moose season by moose hunters.Good Fishing!
514724,Roger B,2001-08-30 14:43:00,4,"Drewman,You didn't say exactly how far north you went but we have been going to the Savant Lake area for 20 years, all but once during September. We usually go around the second week. Weather can range from 90 to below freezing, but those are the extremes. Not many bugs that bite at that time of the year. The trees are starting to turn about that time so the scenery is quite pleasing to the eye. As far as fishing is concerned, I can't really say that June is better or worse than September since I have fished in Canada in June only once. What I can say is that fishing in September has always been quite good, especially for larger pike. The lakes we fish are quite small and not all that deep but we routinely take several pike in excess of 10 lbs. and occasionally one over 20 lbs. The other thing I like is the absence of other fishermen. There have been several years that we have fished a whole week and not seen another person on the lake. The one year that we did go in June you practically had to take a number to park your truck and that was at a lake that is 7 miles back in the bush on an old logging road.Try September some time, I think you would like it.Tight lines,Roger B."
514725,Karl,2001-09-04 22:37:00,63,"Go both June AND September. Both have pluses and minuses, as mentioned already. I like June because of numbers and September because there are hardly any other boats and it makes next year's June trip that much closer."
