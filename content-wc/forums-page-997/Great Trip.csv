514867,Guest,2001-09-10 14:44:00,0,Sounds like you had a great trip!I've been meaning to ask this for some time. Is the road paved?
514868,DaveIN,2001-09-11 07:25:00,191,The last 26 miles is a pretty good gravel road.We drove about 30 to 35 mph on it.I was quite surprised by the condition of it.There was a grader working on it most of the time to keep it in shape.Went in and came out on a weekend so I avoided the logging trucks.They take their half out of the middle of the road.
