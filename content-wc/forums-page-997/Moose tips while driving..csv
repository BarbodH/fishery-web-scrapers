514826,Guest,2001-09-06 22:03:00,0,Being a volunteer firefighter I have had to help unwrap moose from vehicles. So here are a few tips.Tip #1 Slow down by 10 kms per hour. It helps seeing them.Tip #2 Drive as much as you can with your high beams on.Tip #3 A cow moose will stop on the road to block traffic so her calf can cross the road. Wait a few seconds if the cow crosses......there might be a baby swamp donkey following!!!Tip #4 If hitting one is unavoidable (and I know this is hard to do under the stress of knowing you are going to hit but knowing can help) Hit the hind quarters on the drivers side if the moose is facing your left. Hit the hind quarters on the passenger side if the moose is facing to your right. This will spin the moose out and away from your car as the front of the moose is heavier. If you are going to hit full broad side......well all I can say is I hope you make it because they usually end up in the front seat with you as the front end of the car/truck kicks up the legs and they slide along the hood and through the windshield back first. Driver has a slightly better chance as the steering wheel might block the animal.Well I hope this helps. Roger.
