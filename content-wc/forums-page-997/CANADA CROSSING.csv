514675,Riceburner,2001-08-27 13:08:00,436,"The crossing at International Falls/Fort Francis is where they are waiting in lines, and paying to cross the bridge. As I understand it, the bridge is owned by the paper company, thus the charge."
514677,GregK,2001-08-27 13:22:00,113,At that hour of the morning I doubt that you are going to have much of a delay. Yes there is a toll bridge there. It's been that way for 50 years that I can remember. Cannot recall the exact charge but it's less than 2 bucks.
514680,Guest,2001-08-27 14:17:00,0,I got back last week. We crossed Int'l Falls on a Thursday and came back on a Monday. There was a $10 charge for a truck and boat on a trailer. We didn't wait in line either time and crossed in the afternoon.
514678,IaCraig,2001-08-28 19:09:00,434,"The toll is $10 US, and we only had to pay it when we went into Canada. Last year it was something like $4.50 in either US or Canadian funds, payable going both ways.IaCraig"
514679,Karl,2001-08-31 22:20:00,63,"I just got back tonight, went into Ontario last Sunday. The toll was C$9.00 or US$5.00 - I gave the girl nine loonies left over from last year. So I don't know where this US$10 number is coming from."
514676,Guest,2001-09-01 20:33:00,0,Intl. Falls crossing has always charged toll and the bridge is owned by Boise Cascade Paper. The charge is now $10.00 on the way up in US funds but you don't pay coming back. I pull a boat it might be cheaper with just a car or truck.
514681,DaveIN,2001-09-04 13:04:00,191,I got back yesterday from Kenora.The charge for a pickup and boat is $10 from US to Canada.No toll the other way.

Anyway, tell the you would like to buy a border crossing card. For $10 they will sell you a card that is good for six crossings during the course of the year (you still have to pay the toll for the trailer)but if there are 2 or 3 cars in your caravan you can use the card to get all of them across. Sorry if this isn't worded will but it's tough to explainPaul[email protected]"
514683,PWaldow123,2001-09-04 23:06:00,198,Found the name. It's called the Korner Kwik Stop
