514803,Guest,2001-09-06 17:42:00,0,"I HAVE BEEN THERE A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE FALL. MORE 4#+ FISH THAN I HAVE EVER CAUGHT ANYWHERE ELSE IN CANADA. JACKS BLAZE ORANGE, AND CHARTRUCE JIGS HAVE ALWAYS WORKED GREAT FOR ME. WE DO GREAT WITH CRAWLERS BUT SOME DAYS MINNOWS WORK MUCH BETTER IF YOUR WILLING TO PAY FOR THEM. WHILE YOU ARE THERE DO NOT OVER LOOK FISHING THE SHORE RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE RESORT. THERE ARE SOME GREAT WEED BEDS TO CAST INTO ALL THE WAY SOUTH. WE TOOK A 17# PIKE AND A 43 INCH MUSKY THERE. AND WE NEVER HAD ANOTHER BOAT TO CONTEND WITH IN 2 TRIPS.IF YOU LIKE PIKE FISHING FOR A CHANGE OF PACE YOU MIGHT CONSIDER GOING INTO SCALER LAKE. IT IS SOUTH OF THE RESORT AND IS NOT DIFFICULT TO GET INTO. BUT THE PIKE FISHING CAN BE FAST AND FURIOUS. A FRIEND OF MINE CAUGHT A 44 INCHER THERE 2 YEARS AGO. FOR WALLEYES THERE ARE TONS OF PLACES TO FISH, BUT DONT OVER LOOK FISHING THE NORTH SIDE OF FISH ISLAND, JUST SOUTH OF THE CAMP. YOU CAN SEE IT FROM THE PIER. I HAVE CAUGHT A COUPLE OF VERY NICE PIKE THERE ALSO. WHERE IT NARROWS BETWEEN THE SHORE AND THE ISLAND. FOR PIKE I USE A BAIT CALLED A HOT HEAD. IT IS JUST A 1 OUNCE JIG WITH A SINGLE ARM SPINNER BLADE AND A LARGE TWISTER TAIL BODY. WELL I HOPE THIS HELPS A LITTLE HAVE A GREAT TRIP. MIKE"
