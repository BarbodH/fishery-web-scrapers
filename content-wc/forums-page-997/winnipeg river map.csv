514816,Todd_NE,2001-09-06 17:29:00,1330,"Chris,We'll be up Oct 7-11, Manitou at Pine Falls. Fiberglass Fisher, 2025, 19.5 Yar, 1800 Lund Fisherman, and an 1800 Lund Fisherman - NE & KS plates. Look us up.By ol' buddy RTMG call us American's ""You Alls"" and claims the national color of the US is camo, so I was just tipping my hat to Mr. Winnipeg Walleye.Todd* Busily dreaming up and painting new patterns for his personal shad raps... I love Barbie Shad Raps... Barbie Shad Raps love me..."
514817,Guest,2001-09-06 18:55:00,0,"What is a ""Barbie"" shad rap ? Never have heard of that colour."
514811,cnem,2001-09-06 19:29:00,50,"gerry:what were you pulling for cranks over the flats and what kind of depths are you pulling in? thanks,cnem"
514818,Todd_NE,2001-09-07 11:58:00,1330,"I have some buddies who have an entire system of misnaming lures on purpose when saying them over a VHF Radio to help other anglers and I've learned to follow suit. No sense in advertising chartreuse wally divers are hot for example.In this case, a ""Barbie"" Shad Rap is a Pearl Shad Rap. I've just gotten in the habit of never calling a lure what it actually is if I caught fish on it out loud...It does create some interesting VHF chatter if you say something to another partner boat like, ""Bingo, another 12 on the spooed Bluejay Barbie at century 12"". (12 # eye on a White Shad rap with blue & black flecks and berkley walleye scent with 112' of line out). It's fun to listen to other angler's theories on what that phrase for example means... imao."

514820,Guest,2001-09-08 17:55:00,0,I thought it was just some sorta reference to maybe a local bar maid / performer ?
514812,Guest,2001-09-10 08:36:00,0,"Was pulling #8 Fire Tiger Shad Raps and some Storm Deep Jr. Thundersticks (Hot Tiger) all to no avail. Partner was using Clown Shad Raps.Generally was focusing in on the 13-15 foot range.Will be out at Pine Falls this week to give it another whirl to see if it has picked up. The nights are cooling down real good now so it should be a matter of time. My fishing log from last year has September 18th as the first day for me where the greenbacks were really ""running"".This past weekend I was out at Lac Du Bonnet where we had some real good walleye success jigging the current areas near the McCarthur Dam. Best combo was lime green jigs and salted shiners."
514804,cnem,2001-09-05 19:56:00,50,Just got my new Winnipeg River map. Will be up there the second weekend of October. Will be running plugs and also jigging some. Where should I be looking on the map to do each? My map is from the Manitou Rapids near Pine Falls to Traverse Bay. Any help would be appreciated. We are all catch and release only. Thanks much.
514805,DeeZee,2001-09-06 04:46:00,21,"cnem,where did you get your river map?I am interested in getting a copy as well.ThanksDeeZee"
514807,chrism,2001-09-06 06:00:00,429,"Jig the structure in the river out to the mouth of traverse bay. There's lots of current, so bring some 1/2ouncers. Troll cranks around the flats in traverse bay - you'll see a rockpile type island a couple of miles out in the bay - flats are SE of there.You'll know your in the zone when you have to dodge all of the boats - you can't miss it....Good practise letting the bigones go!Have fun!Chris"
514808,Guest,2001-09-06 10:15:00,0,Was out at Pine Falls on Monday and as Chris indicated the current is extremely fast and the water level is up a good foot or two. Be extremely cautious heading out from the river into Traverse Bay as the rocky point jetting out from the South shore is just below the surface right now. Stay close to the North shore and also watch out for nets. There is a 200-300 foot net strung out right at the mouth.
514809,Guest,2001-09-06 10:46:00,0,"Gerry, Did you have any luck for the greenbacks when you were out?"
514806,cnem,2001-09-06 11:05:00,50,"DeeZeegot my map at manitoba conservation/canada map sales. phone number is 1-877-627-7226. $20.00 plus $6.00 shipping. ordered it and had it in abut 3-5 days, they said up to 3 weeks."
514813,Todd_NE,2001-09-06 13:46:00,1330,"Those nets up there are incredible. At 300', it's 2000' less than some we saw last fall there. I'm not knocking commerical fisherman, people have to earn a living, but the mouth of Traverse Bay up to Devils Island or so obviously carries a lot of recreational traffic.I'm amazed the province has such restrictive harvest regulations (which I fully support, non-citizen and all) but will allow nets on top of concentrated fish.Go figure... I hear a lot of people who don't want to throw stuff back up there cuz they figure the nets will get many of the BE Sumo Piggy's anyway. Mr. Camo ""You All"""
514814,chrism,2001-09-06 14:55:00,429,ToddAre you coming back this fall?aka Mr Camo...How am I going to be able to pick you out from the other 300 camo outfits????I'll be one of the geeks in the red suits (one of 200!)Chris
514815,Hawgeye,2001-09-06 15:14:00,1355,"Hey Chrism, do you know where the Seafoam is sold that you wanted? I live in Fargo and will be coming up Sept 29th - the 3rd. I always stop and visit Boris at the Pro-Am on my way through and remembered you needed some SeaFoam. I will be at the Papertown Motor Inn. Let me know and I will see what I can do...."
514810,Guest,2001-09-06 16:01:00,0,"Could not get on to the lake till 4pm due to high winds.I jigged live minnows in the river near Treaty Point (aka Sand cliffs) and I caught 5 greenbacks of which only 3 were keepers. Nothing big but they were greenbacks and not the local ""river"" fish.At about 4pm we trolled (only boat out there!!!) the flats for about an hour with cranks and did not even pick up 1 fish.Still a lot of white bass active in the river, also caught a big channel cat near Manitou Rapids."
