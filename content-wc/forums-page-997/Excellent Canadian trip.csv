514830,Guest,2001-09-07 07:35:00,0,"Just returned (Wednesday) from two weeks in the Sioux Lookout area. Camped at Donnelly's and at Abrams Lake Park. Both areas of Abrams and Minnitaki Lakes produced alot of fish. Disappointed about the size, however, did boat a five pounder and a couple fours. Thought I would get into bigger fish this time of year, but probably didn't fish correctly for the hogs. Used mostly leeches, worms, and minnows on jigs and crawler harnesses. Leeches were the bait of choice for the two weeks, but the last day there (Monday-labor day) caught around 80 or so using minnows in 30-40 feet of water.One thing that will always stick out in my mind about this trip is what a nice couple I met from Minnesota. The young man's name is Nick (never did hear his wife's name), but they were the nicest couple. I had never fished with a crawler harness and didn't know anything about them. Nick went to his boat, got five or six different harnesses with probably 8-10 different color blades and a cooler of night crawlers and gave them to me to use. Even showed me how to rig them and some areas of the lake where they had done real well using crawlers. Had a northern bit one off and he wouldn't let me pay him for it. He was more interested in helping a fellow fisherman. That was really neat. A great experience with another walleye fisherman.If anyone can give me some advice on how to catch the big eyes, I sure would appreciate it.Keep bait on the hook.....eyesnatcher"

Shad raps, Storm/Rapala Thundersticks, and Reef Runners all deep divers should assist in producing better sized eyes. Also jigging with larger minnows is another good method. I truly and honestly believe ""the bigger the bait, the bigger the fish."""
514832,Guest,2001-09-07 14:38:00,0,We are heading up to Sioux Lookout next week and fishing AbramsLake mainly and Minnitaki. Where did you have your best luck?We heard Abrams Chute is a good spot. I was up there in thespring and I had excellent luck in the Sturgeon River that flowsout of Botsford lake.
514833,Guest,2001-09-07 15:25:00,0,"DJ....our best luck was along the island chain SW of Frog Rapids. We fished the south side. If you know where Abrams Lake Park is located, just west of Red Pine Lodge, go south from there to the second to last island, south side. If you run down the south side of those islands you will find a couple deep cups that drop off pretty quickly. Fish in about 28-34 feet of water. We really done good there. No big ones though. Also, the rocky point on the north bank (south of the islands) is also good. Fish anywhere from 20- 30 foot along this bank. The chutes didn't offer much. Caught some, but not many. Minnitaki has alot of good fishing. Only fished it one day when we camped at Abrams Lake Park. The first week we where there we stayed about 20 miles south and fished Minnitaki. It was good down there around Redpine Bay and Southwest Bay. Seems to be fish everywhere, but never did get any real big ones.Hope this helps. By the way, Sturgeon River is excellent in the spring. About everywhere was great with the high water this spring.eyesnatcher>We are heading up to Sioux >Lookout next week and fishing >Abrams >Lake mainly and Minnitaki.

514834,Guest,2001-09-07 20:04:00,0,"eyesnatcher- Thanks for your help! It sounds like my first trip to the area last spring could not have been at a better year with the high water. I have the feeling you are telling me do not bother with the Sturgeon river or Botsford lake. It sounds like we have to go deep. This will be a change for us because we have always fished in the spring or a fly-in. By the way,how is the water level? High or low. I appreciate any advice because we are rookie walleye fisherman and 1 guy in our party it will be his first time to Canada. We are trying to convert him from a crappie fisherman."
514835,Karl,2001-09-07 20:56:00,63,"I got back from fishing Minnitaki last Saturday. The chutes was not productive - couple big northerns, but no walleye. Best spot was the hump north of Nick's Island. It tops off at about eight feet. Walleye were at the 23-25 foot level. Lot's over the slot, fishing with jig/crawler combo. The shoreline directly across (south) from Neepawa Island was good too, again in the 20-25 foot depths.Water level is high this year. Southwest Bay, Redpine Bay and Rice River didn't produce. Not enough deep water nearby I guess."
