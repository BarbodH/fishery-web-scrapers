514771,Guest,2001-09-05 10:39:00,0,"Returned last week and the walleye fishing in the Morson area was slow. Starting to find the fish on the shorelines. with colder weather we should start seeing a good bite, especially in deeper water and current areas. One good note: the crappies are starting to school. We are catching them in areas we never had before. Muskie action was spotty. Some nice fish being seen, not too many caught. They are showing up on the rocks. I will be at my trailer at Mylie's Place from Sept. 10 on. Where do you stay? If you have a marine radio call me on channel 14 (Baitmaker). Good luck.Dick MooreMoore's Lures"

I prefer to fish shallow (less than 15') and would prefer to combine the fishing with some duck hunting. FYI. I've been staying at Redwing Lodge lately, but spent my early years (1969-1991) staying with freinds just East of Mylies in a private log cabin.Thanks,Rick"
514773,PJM,2001-09-09 19:56:00,3516,Just came back from Buena Vista resort on Saturday the 8th and the weather was bad on late Thursday though Saturday with lots of rain and wind. Fishing for the most part was slow but I did find some walleyes. On Wednesday the weather was windy but warm and I found some walleyes in 20 to 30 feet of water by Rubber Island and one of them was a 24in with a few in the 17in range. There few small ones to but for the moat part they were not jumping in the boat. For some reason night crawlers seem to work the best in a 3/4 ounce fireball because where we were fishing there was a lot of current.
