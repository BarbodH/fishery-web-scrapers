I love the feel but I can understand the complaints about it being too sensitive. I counter this by using mono leaders whether I'm using a bottom bouncer setup, running cranks or jigging. Tipping Fireline with three feet (or so) of mono (well actually I'm using Berkely Vanishing Line - mono like qualities)allows for some stretch but not excessive. But really you can't beat the feel."
514742,RMB,2001-09-06 23:11:00,251,"I agree 100%! When jigging, if the fish feels you the same time you feel it, you will miss half your takes. Also, many times the fish just aren't whacking it and you need to let them pick it up, hold it for a sec so they can take it all the way, and then set the hook. You simply can't do that well with fireline. The fish tends to feel you too quickly, and when they're that finicky they just drop it or won't take all the way and you end up short setting them. Give me my Loomis and 6# Triline XL for most situations and I'm a happy camper. As an after thought, there is one time I do use Fireline for jigging. In spring river fishing with faster current it works better than mono. Better feel with bow in the line than mono and because there is a little slack in the line due to the current I get better hook sets as well. That is about the only time I'd use it though. I'd be curious to know what the majority of pros use in most situations for jigging. It would make for a great article in Walleye Insider!"

514745,Guest,2001-09-10 19:03:00,0,well if you want one like i caught 2 weeks ago a26 incher it was 10.1 pounds and on fire line
514746,Guest,2001-09-10 19:07:00,0,mono stretches to much and your cranks run deeper with fire line pike cant bite you off and its tough crap trust me 6 pound diameter 12 pound strenght
514732,Guest,2001-08-30 14:54:00,0,Headed up North at the end of Sept. (Pine Falls). Just wondering what type of line to put on my cranking rod just in case one of those hogs decides to make my decade. Any help would be great.Dingo
514733,BD,2001-08-30 18:19:00,739,Is your reel made for fireline? On the reels designed for fireline the line is wound so it doesn't bury itself in the line still wraped on the spool. Don't make the mistake of putting fireline on reels not designed for it. BIG headache! I prefer mono anyway and use Maxima Chameleon and Maxima Ultragreen. The Chameleon is very tough and resistant to abrasion. The Ultragreen is also very good but is a little more limp.
514734,Jigger1,2001-08-30 19:53:00,234,"I typically fish with mono and went loaded with both this year. The fireline didn't last a day. Between the Loomis rod and fireline I had too much feel, switched back to mono and nailed them."
514735,bigfish1965,2001-08-30 19:55:00,3210,"While I did have trouble with Spider wire binding into itself, I have not had any such problems with Fireline. I use it on several different reels. The only caution is I know if is to be careful when spooling it on. I saw a guy spooling one time and the line was rubbing along the body of the cast button and wore a hole in it. Otherwise it is the best line I have ever used, just remember to resist the temptation to horse the fish right into the boat. The line is stronger than most hooks."
514736,skipjack,2001-08-31 19:24:00,18,"u can't beat fireline.as far as too much feel,well thats one complate i've never heard before."
514737,Reels,2001-09-03 18:39:00,2876,"Fireline can be great, or it can be a pain in the #####. I have used it on several baitcasting reels and never had a problem. Cant beat it for sensetivity. Dont know about spider line. Never used it. Most important thing, is if you us fireline, make sure you have a rod with a soft tip. Sweep the rod on a hook set, dont reef if home or the teath and lips will come flying out at you, and if you get a snag, never try to pull it out with your rod. It will break. Have a rag handy or a glove and pull on the line. It is tough stuff, but it does last forever. Have some trolling rods and bottom bouncing rods going on three years with the same line.Oh, one more thing. Use a mono backing. One, the stuff is way too expensive to fill the whole spool up, but most important, the firelline will slip on the spool without backing if you get a heavy fish on.Tight Lines!!"
514738,bigfish1965,2001-09-04 09:51:00,3210,Now that's funny...LMAO.
514739,Guest,2001-09-05 16:26:00,0,I've been to Pine Falls for the last several falls. I prefer Fireline for sensitivity and strength. You need to know where bottom is when trolling the basin. The fish will hold close to rock humps hugging bottom in the current. This is one of the few places I have found that lure placement is absolutely critical for success. The Fireline allows you the sensitivity know where your lure is running at all times. We also experienced bite-offs while trolling shad raps during an aggresive bite with mono. Fireline had the strength to withstand the teeth. Best of luck!
514740,Northern Manitoban,2001-09-05 16:39:00,195,"Rockbanger is right.Fireline is better and will catch you more fish.Ive had it happen to me trolling for lakers one rod with fireline caught more then the mono using same gear identical gear,at the same depths.Fireline will cut through the water better then mono will,getting you to the desired depth you want.You can't beat the sensitivity.I've been using it for years now.You can still get bite offs from those pike though.FISH ON."
514741,Jigger1,2001-09-06 07:50:00,234,"I should qualify that my comments are related to jigging with mono verses fireline. I prefer mono. The combination of fireline and a G-Loomis walleye jigging rod is just too much, absolutely no forgiveness. However, this past weekend I was dragging bottom bouncers and loved the feel I had with fireline. Obviously, at least to me, it depends on the application and personal preference. I might suggest trying them both as I have and driving towards your own conclusion based on your fishing style.Best of luck to all!"
