513814,lost sailor,2001-07-11 06:55:00,130,"Try small to medium rivers with good populations of walleye. Low light is the key , just before dark walleye start to move very shallow onto rock riffle areas to feed. Fish as late as you feelcomfortable doing, minnow and crayfish patterns should work."

I took some advice from a local outfitter here in NC an tied on a steel leader and a large salt water fly attempting to catch pike. On my third cast I broke my 6 weight G. Loomis GL3 rod. My advice, watch the weight of your rig!!! By the way, I promptly put away my other fly rod."
