The walleye were plentiful, the pike were big and hungry and, oh yes, on Sunday, July 1st we watched heavy winds throw SNOWFLAKES at our cabin window! Upon checking out of camp, our host filled out an invoice and told us that, upon reaching the Canadian/US border, we should go to the Duty-Free Shop and apply for our ""GTS rebate."" We'd never heard of this before...had no idea it had ever existed. Can anyone out there explain, specifically, which purchases apply? We were told that taxes on lodging qualified for rebates, however, once in line at the duty free shop we witnessed US citizens submitting invoices for a wide range of purchases and receiving rebates. If you're going to Canada for a trip and your host hasn't mentioned the GTS rebate, you might want to ask him about it."

The agent at the Duty Free will help you figure how much you get back after you fill out the form. Also ask if they can pay you in US funds, most times they will if they US money. Goog luck FISHING...Kaz"
