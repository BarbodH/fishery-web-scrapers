513776,Guest,2001-07-08 16:25:00,0,I believe that the lake is uncharted . We have inquired in the past and have been told that .

513778,Guest,2001-07-10 11:08:00,0,I just looked at the Ontario 'charted waters' index at a local map shop today and did not see Lake Nipigon on there. You can call Chaltrek Geological Supplies in Thunder Bay yourself to double check....807-344-8848.Good luck!Tom
