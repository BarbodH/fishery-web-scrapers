My whole concern with the 39"" walleye was that it has not been considered the official live release record for CANADA. Since Manitoba is heretofore still a part of Canada, why is it not then the record? I know we feed our walleye better here in Ontario but the 39"" would only need a girth if 12"" to be the record, since a combination of length and girth determines the score of the fish. I also reckognize that certain strains and geographical variations lead to fish with different characteristics, any fish calculator cannot be considered too accurate. My walleye was weighed on an official scale 8 hours after capture at 15 lb 2 oz. This fish was caught a few miles from the Niagara River, which could either make it a part of the Quinte strain or the Niagara ones. Either way a 39"" fish, live released should be reckognized, and so should the guy with enough heart to release it."

513681,Northern Manitoban,2001-07-14 11:11:00,195,Robert Schofield caught the 39 inch Walleye in october of 97.He is from Manitoba look him up and ask him.Alot of 34 inch Walleye's are caught and released every year in Manitoba and why are those not considered the new Canadian live release records? You tell me?FISH ON
513669,bigfish1965,2001-07-03 16:52:00,3210,"Hi all; Just wondering if anyone knows the Canadian and/or international live release records for walleye. I fish a spot which has consistently produced the Canadian Sport Fishing annual record, so I am hoping to land the overall record. Biggest so far was 33 1/4 inches."
513670,dctolle,2001-07-03 17:46:00,9,"not real sure, but i would like to know too. We catch em that big in ohio too. but i am sure the record is bigger. do they go by inches or pounds? and where are YOU FISHING??? I want to go.good luck."
513671,Northern Manitoban,2001-07-03 21:33:00,195,"alot of 33 inchers are released every year,i know the manitoba record walleye from 97 was 39 inches don't know if it was released.Fish on"
513672,bigfish1965,2001-07-04 08:10:00,3210,"[font size=""1"" color=""#FF0000""]LAST EDITED ON Jul-04-01 AT 10:11AM (CST)[/font][p]Well, the idea of a 39"" walleye seemed to me to be a bit of a fish story. Finally I found the Canadian Fish Registry and the official live release record for Canada is 33.68"" X 22.00"" caught by Pete Garnier on the Bay of Quinte, Feb. 22 1993. So if 39"" fish exist...well they are so far beyond the existing records that you best get an entry in quick. According to calculations, a 39"" walleye would weigh around 27-30 lbs."
513673,Guest,2001-07-04 10:51:00,0,The calculator that you were using must be on the fritz. The weight of a 39 incher is aproximately 21-22 pounds not 27-30! There is a weight calculator on this site (main page) that will calculate the weight by using the length and girth of the fish.Hope that helps.
513674,Northern Manitoban,2001-07-05 00:22:00,195,How the heck do you figure 27 to 30 pounds obviously you haven't caught a trophy fish before.this fish was registard and documented.Myself i have caught 30 inch Walleye's that weighed 10 pounds hmmmm 9 inches more 27 to 30 pounds! give me a break! FISH ON.
513675,bigfish1965,2001-07-05 16:23:00,3210,"[font size=""1"" color=""#FF0000""]LAST EDITED ON Jul-05-01 AT 06:47PM (CST)[/font][p]I guess you guys have skinny fish in Manitoba. The walleye on my wall weighed 15 lbs 2 oz, and was 32X22. This is beside my replica Musky I caught on the Niagara River of 50"". To see a picture of a 20+ lb walleye go to www.quintefishing.com/russ_cole_of_picton.htm . That walleye was only 34 inches. Maybe your walleye all spend too much time at Jenny Craig?"
513676,Northern Manitoban,2001-07-05 17:27:00,195,Jenny Craig lol.Thats a good one.A 34 inch walleye 20 pounds oh yes but add on 5 more inches and get 30 pounds?would like to see that one.Here in Manitoba we go by measurement not pounds anymore.So you could catch a heavier fish then me but mine might be longer and would be considered a trophy by length.28 inches is a trophy for walleye's here and where i live that fish would weigh around 8 to 9 pounds southern Manitoba they are fatter.FISH ON.
513677,Pikeman,2001-07-11 20:25:00,93,"[font size=""1"" color=""#FF0000""]LAST EDITED ON Jul-11-01 AT 10:26PM (CST)[/font][p]Fish Length isn't always what determines the weight. The Saskatchewan record walleye weighed 18.06 pounds, and was 33 1/4 inches long, and had a girth of 21 inches. I know the guy who was guiding when the fish was caught, and there is a replica mount in the store (fish was released). Now, the Walleye Central ""Weight Calcualtor"" has this fish at 15.8 pounds. If you could see this fish you would know it's much much more then that! I guess what i'm trying to say is that with out a certified scale, the fish's weight can be roughly estimated at best!Good luck on the water!Pikeman"
513678,Guest,2001-07-12 03:26:00,0,"HEY BIGFISH1965I don't know were you come from but your scale is fubr. Yes the 39"" from Manitoba does exist and it was released.I live in Winnipeg I remember clearly that article about the fish because it was caught near were we fish and I was pissed off. On the Red River we have a species of walleye that is very large and fat called Green Backs. This winter a buddy caught a 31.5"" 21"" girth that weighed 14+ #""s. That will blow up your chart. That is if you know how to use it.That fish you got mounted maybe you should take out the lead!RIP SOME LIP!"
