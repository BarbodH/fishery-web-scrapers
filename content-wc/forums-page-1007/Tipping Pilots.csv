513808,fish on,2001-07-13 06:35:00,2,"I beleave in tipping if the service is good, but it is part of there job to provide good service to you. it's alight to tip the pilot as long as they don't get into the habit of expecting a tip every time. They shouldn't treat someone differant if they don't tip. Maybe a guy would forget to tip with all that excitement building up for months and day dreaming of getting out and casting the line in the big Canadian water! I know I can't wait to get there and cast my line. FISH ON!!!"
513809,duffy,2001-07-13 08:44:00,49,"These guys have your life in their hands. I think it's worth throwing them $20 for your group. They work hard and without them you wouldn't even be getting to your desination. I am pretty confident that each guy in your group has an extra $5 to give to the guy. The comparison to the majot airlines pilot is ridiculous. When have you seen a airline pilot load and unload your gear? These guys are pilots, bagage handlers, and they certainly do not make the same money as airline pilots. I like to comparison to the bell man. You would always give the bell man a tip right? Like anything else however, if he does not give you good service then don't tip him but have you ever seen a bush piot not give you good service?"
513810,All Eyes,2001-07-13 08:46:00,43,"If someone gives me service above and beyond what I expect to receive for the service I have paid for, I will definitely tip. I am not afraid to ask for local advice, etc. If the pilot can offer me some extra local knowledge and goes out of his/her way to assist me or can make my trip more successful, I appreciate this and will tip accordingly."
513811,Guest,2001-07-13 13:09:00,0,"I have been fishing canada for 20 years, in august I will be taking my first flyin,I never even thought about tipping the pilot but I deffinetly will,thanks for posting this topic,I mean I tip every time I go out to eat ,to drink, stay at a hotel,take a taxi, why not someone who has your life in there hands. As some of the other posts stated they proboly dont get payed much and even if they do your showing them your graditude for a job well done. Thanks Again For This Topic Ed From Pa."
513797,Guest,2001-07-10 09:17:00,0,Just wondering if people tip or do not tip the pilots on fly-ins?
513798,Guest,2001-07-10 10:22:00,0,If you tip the pilot you'll probably be the first.
513799,duffy,2001-07-10 11:14:00,49,he would be the second as I always give 10 or 15 bucks.
513800,Guest,2001-07-10 14:53:00,0,Make that the third ! Why would you not tip him ???
513801,Guest,2001-07-10 16:42:00,0,"I dont mean to be a smart #####, but why would you tip him?"
513802,Pooch,2001-07-10 18:02:00,4619,"These guys don't make big bucks. They help load and unload your gear. Wait around for you when your late and get you in and out safely. We have always tipped. Not big bucks, like the other guys said maybe $20 U.S. for all of us on the flight. We seem to tip for crap service down here, why not tip for someboy who appreciates it and is working for it.Th-Thats all folks...Pooch"
513803,Guest,2001-07-10 18:12:00,0,"Maybe I'm looking at this all wrong ?? But is he not providing a service ?? ( loading & unloading your bagage & belongings ) maybe sharing a little info with you ?? ( recent hot fishing spots , depths etc. )Granted not all are deserving of a tip but this is my take on it , right or wrong .Do you or do you not tip a taxi driver or bell hop ?? Not that most of us fisherman stay at hotels with bell hops anyway , just making a point ."
513804,Atlanta Dave,2001-07-11 09:31:00,323,"Champ We have flown into some of the most expensive camps in canada the last 7 years and I have yet tipped or seen any of the other many groups I have fished with tip a float pilot. Question do you tip the northwest pilot? Also most float pilots are using these flight hours as a stepping stone to a much better paying career as a pilot for a larger airline. I think guides , cooks or maids at the camps figure tips into their salary expectations and thusly should be tipped. My two cents worth. Atlanta Dave <"")))><"
513805,ChuckD,2001-07-11 15:36:00,1581,"We usually tip the pilot unless he's the owner a lot of these guys have been there a long time and aren't just ""logging hours"" anyway if you don't tip on the way up who's to say he'll remember where he left you."
513806,Esox Maniac,2001-07-12 04:06:00,69,"The Fly-In pilot's I've flown in with were always helpful- fishing tips- fly around the lake pointing out reefs & hot spots, even helping take gear to the cabin- In my book- that deserves a little extra- we usualy tip $20/US per person. My average trip(just the fly-in cost is ~$600 -->$750US) Twenty bucks is 3% or less. Tip a waitress 3% & she'll probably spit at you the next time you walk in. Most of these guys are just making a living (salary)& probably doing it because they love to fly in the Canadian wilderness. Believe me, the pilot will remember you the next time around. Just my 2 cents worth.><))))*>""It's your choice to Catch'em & Let'em Go!"""
