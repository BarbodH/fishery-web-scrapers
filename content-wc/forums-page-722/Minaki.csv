548451,Reels,2005-05-26 19:43:00,2876,"I called Peter last night, said a group caught about 200 walleyes over a 4 day stretch, right down the river about a mile, but most were just under the slot. Males still milking, so the pigs should be recovered while you are there Don. He also said lots of rain, every day. Bring your rain gear too! <{{}}><"

548474,Guest,2005-05-27 12:24:00,0,"I can't beleive it...I know that there is alot of good fishing up there but....2 walleyes with slot restrictions...and major restrictions on the northerns....looks like our Canada fishing days are coming to an end, HELLO MN-WIS-ND-SD...This will really hurt all the resorts up there...For sure our last year of going up there...I do mind catch-and-release....but I sure would like to bring some home too."
548484,Guest,2005-05-27 19:59:00,0,"It's the ""Resorts up there"" that has led to these restrictions.....I only wished they had started this about ten years ago."
553715,Guest,2006-01-11 13:52:00,0,"any news on ""new limits"" for 2006... just wondering"
553717,Guest,2006-01-11 15:25:00,0,"Limits and size are the same as last year. We've been going there for 20+ years now, sometimes 2 or 3 weeks a year. Great walleye, northern and musky. Excellent smallmouth... OK crappie, but they scatter after the spawn. We always catch our crappie in the weed bed on the south east section of Rough Rock. Chuck."
548187,Guest,2005-05-21 09:05:00,0,"DR, I will be fishing May 28-June 3rd out of Birch Island Resort. The crappie are in 1-4 feet at that time if the water temp is in the high 50's-low 60's. When you are there, the crappie may be moving in to 6-10 feet of water adjacent to where they spawned. You can post a question on the forum of Witch Bay Camp, fishing reports, www.witchbaycamp.com, on Lake of the Woods, about crappie fishing that time of year, and stand a good chance of getting a pattern to fish. Good luck, Don"
548250,Guest,2005-05-23 10:42:00,0,"Reels: I also have a Green Pro-V, it is a 2025 LE with Wisconsin Reg. If you get a chance in the evening, stop at Cabin 6 of Paridise 2 and say hello, it would be a pleasure to meet you. If you have a marine radio, if so do you monitor channel 68? That seems to be the fishing channel up there? DR"
548267,Guest,2005-05-24 03:53:00,0,"The owner at Birch Island Resort states that as of May 21st the water temperature is 56 degrees. The walleye fishing is reported as good by fisherman at the marina. Our group will open the lodge. In looking at the forecasts, I get from 4 different sites different forecasts, which is not a total surprise. It looks to be on average, daytime highs occasionally lower than normal, but lows higher than normal. I hit the water this Saturday, and will give a report when I get back home. I am curious if the sliders will produce. I got some Chomper tubes per recommendation of Reels and have some Senkos that I will give a try per recommendation of Aaron. Good luck to all you Minaki fisherman, Don"
548302,Guest,2005-05-24 20:12:00,0,"Thanks for all the info guys, I am sure it will be a great help. We will be in a Smokercraft Ultima 175 with a 115 Johnson. Say Hello if you see us. Thanks again and good fishing."
548419,Guest,2005-05-26 11:27:00,0,"Going up to Minaki June 9th to the 16th.....any advice on the Walleyes & Pike....It's been ""spotty"" the last few years up there."
548425,Guest,2005-05-26 12:34:00,0,"Does anyone know what the limit is on Walleye?....For Non-Res Sports, I've heard 2...but looking at the ontario fishing regs I see it is 4....I hope it is 4....does anyone know for sure?"
548429,Reels,2005-05-26 14:19:00,2876,"2 for non residents, <{{}}><"
548430,Reels,2005-05-26 14:21:00,2876,Sounds good DR- we are around the corner at Barbers. <{{}}><

548438,Guest,2005-05-26 17:15:00,0,"Just looked at the Canadian weather site for Minaki. It is calling for highs of 75 Wednesday and 84 Thursday. So much for the cooling trend. The other weather sites have much more seasonal temperatures. I didn't pack any shorts. May have to throw a pair in. Good fishing to all Minaki fisherman, Don"
548016,Guest,2005-05-17 07:03:00,0,"Sorry....I see June 18th. I'll be there on the 16th so I can't give away any of my locations...LOL. Seriously though, smallmouth are found all over that system. I do most of my smallmouth fishing up on Big Sand....just about anywhere there is a rocky shoreline. The NW section up around West Bay is always good. The North shorline of Big Sand is always good. The North East side of Little Sand is always productive as well."
548071,Guest,2005-05-18 08:28:00,0,Will be in Minaki the week of June 3--for the 2nd year--any advice on walleyes--general locations and presentations--thanks pella dutch
548090,Guest,2005-05-18 16:48:00,0,As I have never been there before I really can't help you out. Sure was glad to get the info that I have so far. sweept
548108,Guest,2005-05-19 08:47:00,0,sweept.......send me an email ([email protected]) and I'll give you some specific locations and such.
548110,Guest,2005-05-19 09:28:00,0,"Have always had good luck under the powerlines at the end of Gun Lake. Last year caught a 34"" on a jig and minnow there. In 3 years, had most sucess with 3/8 and 1/2 (depending on current)jigs in chartreuse with a dyed(we dipped our own) nose in orange. It seemed to outfish everyone elso around us as 100 fish days (per boat) were not uncommon. Good luck as we're going to LOW this year."
548163,IaCraig,2005-05-20 11:06:00,434,"I am no expert, but for Walleyes my rule of thumb is in the Spring Gun Lake around the Hydro lines, as water warms try the channels like around Strawberry and into Little Sand, Mid Summer hit Big Sand. Aaron, do you have luck with the crappies in the summer too? Or are they pretty much just a Spring thing? I am taking my entire family the end of July, and they love catching panfish. IaCraig"
548164,Guest,2005-05-20 11:43:00,0,I am going to be in Minaki from June 3rd to the 11th. Anybody care to share locations as to catching some crappie. I heard that there are some nice crappie in that flowage. Thank You in Advance DR
548166,Guest,2005-05-20 12:54:00,0,"Craig and Diesel.......if your going to target crappies go up into what I have always called ""Lost"" Lake although on some maps it's called ""Hidden"" Lake. If your looking at a map it's on the East side of shoot going up to Big Sand. It's an easy access lake and has a lot of crappie in it. I caught a 49 inch musky in there last year on my first cast pitching a Senko...Ooops."
548167,Guest,2005-05-20 12:55:00,0,Craig.....I've only caught them in the spring.
548174,Reels,2005-05-20 15:36:00,2876,I'll be there that week too. I'm in a green ProV. Stop by if you see me and I will help you out some. Reels <{{}}><
547955,Guest,2005-05-15 06:58:00,0,"My son and I be heading to Minaki June 18th for a week of fishing. The group we fish with mostly targets walleyes. Does anyone have anyone have some tips on other species? Smallies, Crappies, perch, Northerns. Thanks"
547959,Reels,2005-05-15 09:02:00,2876,I will be back from Minaki June 11th and will post a report on how the bite is going. Im sure Don will post a report the week before too. <{{}}><
547961,woods,2005-05-15 09:43:00,646,Good luck Reels! Heading up there on the 18th too. Woods
547968,Guest,2005-05-15 14:09:00,0,"I'm going up on the 16th....fish mostly for smallmouth. Take some jig spinners (1/4 oz. nickle blade, white or yellow twisty tails), 5 inch senkos, tubes, Rebel WeeRs(gold/silver and black) and your good to go."
547971,Reels,2005-05-15 17:04:00,2876,"Going to miss you this time woods. If you want, drop me an e-mail and I will give you my cell # if you want to call me for what the bite is.[email protected] <{{}}><"
547987,Guest,2005-05-16 10:11:00,0,"Sweept, For crappie I use 1/16 ounce white painted livebait jigheads from Cabela's and put a 2 inch pumpkin/chartreuse original Berkley Power Grub. I fish this with a 2000 model reel with 6 LB stren gold (to see the strikes) on a light rod. I will be trying some Brewer crappie sliders also for the first time. I or my partner essentially have hooked everything doing this. Crappie, up to 18 inch smallmouth, tons of perch and pike, walleye and a muskie. Try the rapids for smallmouth with a 1/4 ounce 3 1/2 inch tube also. Good luck, Don"
547988,wooglin,2005-05-16 10:44:00,371,Could you tell me where exactly Minaki is? Thanks!
547989,Guest,2005-05-16 11:33:00,0,"Just North of Kenora, Ontario (596) on the Winnipeg River system."
548012,Guest,2005-05-16 20:55:00,0,Thanks for the tips guys anyone care to share any locations? Are the perch and crappies any size?
