Tobin lake (river sec.) only put strong rules in after the ""collaps"" or hunters bay on laclaronge, and how many times do you see a C.O. officer, like never. The place I go to for lakers in Man. has a must release rule for all Lakers over 26"" been that way for over 30yrs. a slow day is 10 fish, a great day is 50, every year we get one over 20lbs, most times more than one, up to 38 lbs so far.

553713,Guest,2006-01-11 12:53:00,0,"Mr. Walleye We have gone to Jackson's Lodge and to his Bloodvien River Outpost Camp and enjoyed each trip. Can you email me and let me know which lakes you have fished through them. We will be booking another trip this year with them but, have to select a new spot. The Province has decided that they want the Bloodvien River to be pristine and have burnt down Jackson's camp. Would like to know which spots you fished and the one you like the best. Thanks[email protected]"
553742,Guest,2006-01-13 11:38:00,0,"I'm not sure if the distance is that big of an issue. Granted, as soon as you cross the border into Ontario from MN, you see lakes, and you can fish. In MB, you have to travel a bit farther north, but there is less pressure, more seclusion. The road from the states (I-29) is 4 lanes. Hwy 75 into MB is 4 lanes. There are quite a few lodges within 6 hours of Winnipeg that offer the feeling of tranquility that only a fly out would offer. I see tons of Iowa and Minnesota plates in NW Ontario. They should think about MB. They won't have to worry about crappy roads (like from Fort Frances to Dryden) or hitting a moose. There's alot of talk about that on this board once the ice starts to honeycomb and people are getting the itch..... There is nothing like a greenback fishing trip to MB in the fall, and knocking down a few Canada's on the same day if the fishing is slow.....just ask those Americans that already have experienced Manitoba. Manitoba is the land of 100,000 lakes and has 3 times that land mass that MN has. Mille Lacs looks like a duck pond compared to some of the lakes in MB. I've lived and fished both places. That's why I'm in Manitoba now. Good fishing everyone."
553747,Guest,2006-01-13 14:24:00,0,"...100,000 is that suppose to be good. Ontario has 250,000 and Minnesota with its land of 10,000 lakes is a joke! D"
553752,Guest,2006-01-14 14:44:00,0,"A side benefit I have found is the folks in the ""prairie provinces"" (Man. Sask & Alberta) seem to have a somewhat friendlier general regard for Americans tourists than their eastern counterparts. I appreciate it and, thank you from this Yankee."
553915,Guest,2006-01-19 19:46:00,0,"I was just stating that MB has 100,000 lakes, compared to MN. We are all aware Ontario has alot more lakes. Wasn't looking for a confrontation sir. There is more to life than Ontario. MB and SK are great provinces for great fish. To answer your question, I would say that 100,000 lakes is good; just ask the people from Iowa, Ill, MN, that visit this sleeper province every year. Have a good one."
553654,Jesse-WI,2006-01-06 17:21:00,534,I did a search but did not see much. We are looking for a change and thinking about Manitoba instead of Ontario. Any advise or information on drive in resorts would be greatly appreciated.
553657,grt1,2006-01-06 19:45:00,259,"I stopped at the Manitoba Tourist Bureau at the Manitoba/Ontario border last year and picked up a brochure titled ""Great Manitoba Getaways, 2005 Fishing and Hunting Adventures."" it gives a list of most of the resorts in the Province of Manitoba broken down by areas and other fishing information. The web page they advertise on the front of the brochure is travelmanitoba.com this brochure may be available on line or they may be able to send you a copy if you request one."
553658,hoosiercanadian,2006-01-06 22:34:00,104,Go to www.travelmanitoba you can have a fishing package with a Manitoba map and lists of outfitters sent free. Lots of good choices depending upon your budget.
553659,hoosiercanadian,2006-01-06 22:43:00,104,"Forgot to put the .com after travelmanitoba, anyway Manitoba is a monster big province and the fishing is incredible, especially in the northern part of the province, farther to go but less tourists."
553661,Bill Krejca,2006-01-07 08:24:00,6107,"Jesse, We've gone the last 3 years to Wekusko Falls Lodge, near Snow Lake. The lake has lots of big walleyes and pike, some trout, too, although we naver targeted them. Walleyes over 22"" have to be released, pike over 27"" or so, also. Tony and his wife Sue are nice folks, very laid back and accomodating. Last year, 4 out of 6 of us got master angler awards for walleye 28"" or better - (2)- 28"", (1) 29"", (1) - 30"". The lodge is located at the north end of Tramping Lake, falls is right by the camp. If you take a look in the Manitoba fishing guide, you'll find a bunch of master awards for the lake.http://www.wekuskofallslodge.com/index.html If you want more info, feel free to email me."
553667,Guest,2006-01-07 20:05:00,0,"Check out Jackson's Lodge. They also have ouposts. I've fished a few of their lakes, and the fishing was excellent!! Their website is www.jacksonslodge.com. Good luck!"
553669,Guest,2006-01-07 20:32:00,0,If you people think Manitoba is good you sure haven't been to northern Saskatchewan!
553670,hoosiercanadian,2006-01-07 21:31:00,104,"Great to see some discussion on this board about other provinces besides Ontario, 97% of the questions on here are about Northwestern Ontario. Northern Manitoba, and northern Saskatchewan has the best freshwater fishing on planet earth."
553673,Jesse-WI,2006-01-08 13:17:00,534,Thanks for the assistance. It would seem the travel distance may be the reason it is not discussed as often as Ontario. Jesse
553693,Guest,2006-01-09 16:47:00,0,Saskatchewan may be good. But I believe Manitoba has more progressive regulations regarding the protection of big fish. My 2 cents....go Manitoba!
