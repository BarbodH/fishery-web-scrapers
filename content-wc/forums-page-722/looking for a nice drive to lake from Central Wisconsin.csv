The fishing was great for pike in the 35-38"" range and lots of small to medium walleyes in the evenings. The drive however was 14 hours 1.45 of which was on a bumpy gravel road that beat the %$%$& out of our rigs. We are looking for something in the 10 hour range.We are coming from just south of Greenbay. We would like a good shot at a 40"" pike. Any help you can give me would be great. Possibly 3rd week of May. Thanks in advance for your help."

I would expect a U.S. record to come out of there sometime in the next 10 years. Next world record muskie will come from there as well, in my opinion. Good walleye fishing there too. Have you considered a fly-in trip to Canada?"

It is around 12 hours, but the roads are nice and the trip really goes fast. We have been staying at Deer Trail Lodge with Ruth and Richard Price. The cabins are in very good shape, the owners are super nice people and we (mostly my father-in-law) have caught pike in the size you are looking for. Not to mention the trophy walleye and musky. As a side note.....I too fish the Green Bay area and it is not the same as getting a bunch of guys or the kids loaded up and heading out on an adventure accross the border. Good luck with your search and make sure you check out the All Canada Show and ask questions. There's no such thing as a stupid one when it's your vacation. Joe"
553709,Guest,2006-01-10 17:50:00,0,"How about Lake Michigan? Real short drive, and all the species you want! On a more serious note, I think you should get accustomed to that 12-16 hour drive. Would a 10-hour drive even get you to the border? See, the fishing around Ignace, Dryden, Kenora and further north is superior to what you will get around the border, far superior for some species. To me, it makes no sense to go all that way, when going a relatively small distance further will often put you onto better fishing. Don't get me wrong . . . there is good fishing to be had around Thunder Bay, and in Quetico Prov. Park, but not the volume of fish in the lakes further north. NWO Fishing Bum"
553710,fishmaster,2006-01-10 18:28:00,209,Turn on your e-mail service and I will try to help you out. I am also from Sheboygan and have a good place for you. Vermilion Bay lodge is a great place on Eagle Lake and the roads are good and the rates are good. Check out his web site.www.vermilionbaylodge.com
553721,Guest,2006-01-11 21:02:00,0,"you might want to check out www.witchbay.com From just about dead-center Wisconsin, it takes me approx 11 hours towing a boat....but you need to know the last 7 miles is the camp ""driveway"" and takes about 45 min to drive if towing a boat. However, dialogue on the website will corroborate the fact that many, many people are very pleased with Witch Bay. In fact, well over 60% is return business on an annual basis. And if I'm guessing right from your sign-on name, bring some of those awesome local brats and I'll trade you a shore lunch. Wherever you end up, have fun !!! Lunk"
