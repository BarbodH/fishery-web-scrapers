533779,FishTwentyFourSeven,2003-07-24 11:05:00,38,Thanks for the response Analyst. About 70-80% of our fish come out of the weeds. We do get Northern but no too often. When the Walleyes are in the weeds the bite is usually on big-time. We fish thick cabbage weeds in 9-12 feet of water. If you can find than deeper go for it but we really don't find them any deeper than 12 feet. The thicker the cabbage the better. You will realize the thick cabbage when you see it. The leaves are about 4-6 inches wide. A couple patched here and there usually won't work. You have to find a field of them. Just do a slow drift over them with a jig heavy enough to get to the bottom. The cabbage weeds get very dense. The fish won't even notice you above them. Just rip the jig through the weeds and drop it back down. Staying vertical is a big key. If you start to jig on an angle you will be pulling up the whole cabbage plant. I can't wait two more days...I wan't to leave know. Jerry

533681,Guest,2003-07-22 09:24:00,0,"Hi all, we are going up to the grassy narrows area next week and was just wondering if anyone had some tips, never been there before so I'm not really familiar with the area. We'll be fishing for walleyes and pike with all catch and release except for a few for dinner. Thanks for any help, Stiffrod"
533706,Guest,2003-07-22 15:09:00,0,"if its the same grassy narrows camp that's in miles bay, the owner is jerry fisher who is one of the better muskie guides on that part of lotw. he should be able to give you all the info you need. pf"
533710,Coach BWS,2003-07-22 17:19:00,38,I would assume you are going out of Ojibwe-Aking Marina. I am going up the 27th and thru the week. I have been going up for 6 years and the fishing is incredible. Tough area to navigate without experience. The water is down alot from last year. Fishing has been excellent as a bunch of groups from my home town have been up there. Where are you staying. I will be staying at the cabin right at the marina and have a Alumacraft magnum 175 with a Yamaha. If you need help let me know. Brett
533737,Guest,2003-07-23 08:38:00,0,"Brett, yep that's the place we're going. We'll also be up on the 27th and staying until weds. We are camping out on the water somewhere. I think one of the other guys going has been there before so hopefully he is halfway familiar with it. Do you know if they have maps for sale at the marina? I'll be in a Starcraft tournament pro, cream and teal with a johnson. The other guys with us have a gray pro-v tiller. Maybe see you up there, good luck , Ryan"
533753,Coach BWS,2003-07-23 16:11:00,38,The maps they had last year aren't real good for navigating. It's a neat area and has a ton of big fish. Find current areas and eddys and about 15 to 20 feet and you'll find walleyes. We usually use 1 1/2 oz bottom bouncers with about a 18 inch snell and leeches or crawlers. Lots of rocks in the current areas. Where are you from? Brett
533759,Guest,2003-07-23 20:09:00,0,"Thanks for all the info, there will be 3 of us from Thief River Falls and and 1 guy from Warren. I just talked to the guy from Warren and were getting our list's made up, you have to pack alot of junk going out there for four days, not to mention the beer. Do you guys usually use spinner's or lindy's. How about jiggin or trolling cranks in the evening for a little variety? I see your from Hawley, judging from your handle I'm guessing you must coach something. Ryan"
533761,Coach BWS,2003-07-23 21:02:00,38,"Yes I teach and coach Football here. We usually use plain hooks with about 18 inch snells. The shorter is so it stays down in the current with the bottom bouncer. Spinners work but don't seem to be needed. Most of the time the hook is in front of the bouncer when going with the current. When you go into the current the hook tends to go up the line. Haven't used plugs, but then don't usually troll in the lake areas. Concentrate on the current areas mostly. Nothing to have a 80 ot 100 fish day with half of them over 20 inches. Incredible fishing. Buddies just got back and landed a lot of fish over 25 with the biggest being 31. I have used jigs but bouncers seem to be better. Brett"
533768,Guest,2003-07-24 07:33:00,0,"fished up here several times also and would concur with the comments posted. i would add one thing though, trolling and/or casting with cranks have also worked very well for me. outside of the obvious current areas (and inside of them as well), i've done well with a variety of standard thin minnow style hard baits. my question for any of you familiar with this body of water is whether you know of any depth contour map for this area. in three weeks when i'm up there, i'd like to expand my approach to finding and hitting some under water structure areas. thanks and good luck on your trips."
533769,FishTwentyFourSeven,2003-07-24 07:42:00,38,"Analyst, I am leaving this Sat. for the English River System. We are staying fairly close to Grassy Narrows. We searched and searched for contour maps. No luck. I will let you know how we did when I get back. If you find any contour maps...can you let me know? I plan on going to this area again next year and those maps would be like gold to us. I haven't heard many reports about the area this year, but the lodge owner tells us the bite started off furious and has slowed a bit the last couple of weeks. The weather has started to become a little more stable and the owner says that the bite is starting to pick up again. We fished weed beds last year but with the low water I hear that the weeds are not as abundant this year. All we did last year was jig and had good success. I look to trying bottom bouncing this year. I am a little nervous about it because I have never done it before but it sounds fun and productive. I hope it doesn't take too long to find the fish next week. I'll post when I get back. Two more nights at home and then I am gone. Can't wait. Jerry"
533777,Guest,2003-07-24 10:41:00,0,"jerry, the bottom walker/bouncer (1 ounce for down to 20 ft or bigger if fishing deeper) with 2 - 3 ft leader and a floating rap. or a crawler has been a very effective technique for me. i just drag it around at idle speed to cover water and find fish. and if i hit a good concentration of fish, i'll start throwing jigs. pretty simple program. fished weeds a bit in the past but haven't caught too many walleyes out of them, more northerns of course. what's your startegy for finding the right weeds up there?"
