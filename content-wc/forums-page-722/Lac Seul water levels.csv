553783,Guest,2006-01-16 08:55:00,0,Hydro has just started construction of the new generator at the dam. Rumors are that the water has to be low when they do the intakes. I think the plan will be to lower the water for construction and then raise it to normal for the opener

It started dropping the last week of December and has gone down 6"" since then. Last year it continued to go down until the second week of April when it hit about 1165. We have a little more snow than usual for this time of year. Who knows what spring will bring. Normally it rises about 6"" per week once it starts to come back up during the melt."
