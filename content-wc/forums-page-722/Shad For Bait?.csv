553482,Bill Krejca,2005-12-26 10:36:00,6107,"Has anyone tried using frozen/salted shad for bait for trout, pike, and walleye, and is it legal in Ontario? Thanks,"
553483,Trailerguy,2005-12-26 16:39:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Only fresh or frozen baitfish caught in the same lake/river system are legal. Smelt in any form is excluded from use in inland waters. If the shad were preserved with salt you could use them. Why not just pickup your bait locally, it's less hassle? Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
553485,bigfish1965,2005-12-26 18:35:00,3210,The bait laws have changed abit from last year. THere is no longer a 'same system' requirement. But you are not permitted to dump unneeded minnows into the water when done fishing. Leave them on land for the gulls. Also the restrictions on dead bait have been lifted except for a few sensitive areas. Shad is an accepted bait but you cannot trap your own if you are not a resident of Ontario.
553487,Trailerguy,2005-12-26 19:14:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Bigfish, I gotta ask where your information on the changes comes from ? The Ontario Recreational Fishing Regulations Summary,that I have in my hand says 2005-2006 on the cover? The statement I see here is: Anglers must not release live bait into waters other than the waterbody where the bait was originally captured. And of course: It is illegal to bring live fish, leeches,crayfish,or salamanders into Ontario for use as bait. Additionally: Live smelt may not be used as bait in Ontario. There are restrictions on the use of dead smelt(see ""Expections to the General Regulations). I'm not sure what family ""shad"" fall in but it also says: In most areas of Ontario, only the following fish may be used as bait. >Minnow family(except carp,goldfish,cutlip minnow,redsided dace, lake chubsucker, and gravel chub.) >mudminnows, white sucker, sticklebacks, darters(except eastern sand darter) trout-perch and sculpins. >lake herring >crayfish Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

The shad running in the lakes are part of the minnow family. You may purchase minnows from anywhere in Ontario and use them but cannot release them alive. And like I said, dead smelt can be used just about everywhere."
553505,Trailerguy,2005-12-27 17:42:00,1407,"Bigfish, >>Anglers must not release live bait into waters >>other than the waterbody where the bait was originally >>captured. You're painting with way too wide a brush here. Perhaps you aren't aware that bait dealers often capture the bait in the same ""waterbody"" or ""system"", they sell it in. Even my neighbor (a Resident) traps minnows in a creek that feeds right into Wabby. The law is designed to stop invasive speices not to keep people from moving baitfish from one part of the lake to the other. The shad running in the lakes are part of the minnow >family. A google search indicates that shad are clupieds or (River Herring) not members of the minnow family. [font color=green size=3][b] Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
553510,bigfish1965,2005-12-28 09:25:00,3210,"All the law requires is that you do not empty you bait bucket into the lake. That is all it requires. Most bait comes from bulk dealers and there's no real way of knowing where they came from unless you happen to know the trapper. You are correct about the shad and herring family. Herring is also an allowed baitfish. One of the obscure parts of Ontario baitfish laws is that it deals with live baitfish, but makes no real restrictions on using dead baitfish other than smelt. You can also use alewife as bait if you are a resident of Ontario, caught the alewife yourself and use it in the same body of water.I'll be so happy when the new 2007 regs come out with simplified rules and Fish Managements Zones. Getting to the point where you need to take a lawyer on the boat with you to read the rules for you. (I'm a former Fish and Wildlife Guardian with the MNR)."
553760,Guest,2006-01-15 00:35:00,0,Just buy local bait. easiest method and no arguements on which rules are correct
