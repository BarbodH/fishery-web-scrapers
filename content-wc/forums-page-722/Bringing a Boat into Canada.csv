553876,OntarioAngler,2006-01-17 16:10:00,46,"I cross at Sombra,ON on the ferry frequently.(aka The Beer Ferry) There is a sign there in huge letters stating if you are bringing more than $10,000 into the states you must decalre it on both sides. This includes cash, bank notes, money orders, travellers cheques and certified cheques. They can confiscate all of it. I have asked them at that crossing Why? Their response was all those other cheques are really CASH. They want to know the amount so they can send the info to Ottawa. When you come back into Canada (maybe at a different crossing) that information of your purchase, when you pay the taxes, is also sent to Ottawa. They told me if the two numbers match, no problem. If they don't YOU ARE SCREWED! Its investigation time. Don't expect to take a certified cheque to someone in the states, have them go to the bank and deposit and hand over the boat. It takes a week to 21 days for the money to clear. I doubt the owner will let it go until the money clears. I know I wouldn't. As for cash, ask your bank (in Canada) what they would do if someone walked into their bank and wanted to deposit $10,000.00 cash. I have a good friend who is a teller for CIBC. She told me the money will be held for up to a week. I am sure the US side is the same. Thats why I sent to money draft ($8) by UPS ($30) to the owner and waited 10 days for them to call me when the money cleared. It was a long wait for me and the owner. But it beats that long drive back home being let down that the money wasnt cleared, not pulling a rig. It was a leap of faith sending that money to someone without a receipt, but I trusted them. Hey if you dont trust that person enough to do that. DONT BUY from them. My best advice is to talk to your bank about money options and have the owner talk to their bank about cash, drafts or certified cheques (as to how long to clear) and come up with best soltion for both. Its not easy but if you love the boat its worth it."
553877,OntarioAngler,2006-01-17 16:21:00,46,Here's a phone number for Canada Customs 1 800 461 9999. It is an automated service but you can talk to a person during regular business hours. They may be able to give you the phone number of your crossing but I am not sure.
553882,Guest,2006-01-17 20:59:00,0,it all depends who you talk to a customs each person gives you a different answer. (welcom to canada)
553749,Guest,2006-01-14 08:32:00,0,"Is it a hassle bringing a boat inot Canada, im looking at one in the states and wondering how much of a hassle it is, im also wondering if i should get 2 bills of sale for the taxes at the border, or if they can even check that??"
553750,515,2006-01-14 10:38:00,254,Might want to check out the Canada Customs site and see what it say there on fees and taxes. Mike
553756,Guest,2006-01-14 22:14:00,0,"If you are just bringing a boat to canada to fish out of while you are there, you should have no concern about taxes and bills of sale as long as you have it registered correctly in the state you reside in. Now is it worth it to haul it all the way up there? It depends on how much you like fishing out of your boat instead of renting one. there are many good boats to rent up there now. it is very easy to find a lodge that will rent you any make, model, size and age you want. Not always the most economical way to go but neither is the gas it takes to get there now."
553770,Chartertalk,2006-01-15 13:36:00,205,"If you are looking to buy one in the US it is not that much hassle. Get a bill of sale for the purchase price. You will then have to pay GST and PST at the border E.G. 25000 US converts roughly to $30000 CDN you will then pay the taxes on the $30000. 15% = 4500. You will also have to get a letter from the manufacturer of the trailer that states there have been NO safety problems with the trailer. It will also cost $200 for this RIV form. RIV Registrar of Imported Vehicles. Your trailer will then have to be inspected by a mechanic at a Canadian Tire store. Hope this helps,"
553772,OntarioAngler,2006-01-15 17:22:00,46,"Get a receipt for boat and motors and one for the trailer. You will pay pst and gst on the boat and motors and only gst on the trailer at the border. Be sure all the titles are signed by the previous owner and notorized. Pay the $209 at the border for Registry of Imported Vehicles and you will get Form 1 on the spot. You can pay cash or credit card at the border. The border can issue your new boat numbers at the same time so you wont have to go back again. In about 10 days Form 2 will come by mail instructing you to get the inspection done (usually Canadian Tire) You will need you cerificate for recall clearance from the manufacturer before the inspection. Just call the maufacturer tell them your vin of the trailer and they will email/fax it to you. Once the inpection is complete take ALL your paperwork to the licence bureau, pay the pst on the trailer and get a plate. I did all this in December. Not a big deal at all. The people I bought from were nice enough to loan me their trailer plate to get it home and then I just mailed it back to them. Inform your insurance company before you go over giving them a description and price. They told me I technically couldn't insure it until I got it into Canada. But it is better that they are aware. The US customs doesnt need to see any paperwork or need to sign anything. If you are taking over $10000.00 over the border being cash, cheque or money order you MUST tell them on both the Canadian and US side as you are crossing the border to the US. I sent a US money draft to the owner by UPS and waited until the money cleared their bank. This could take a couple weeks. But was likely less hassle. Where I crossed the border the officials were great! If you have any questions email me [email protected] or call me 519-692-7208 Darren. I made sure all my ducks were in line before I bought and when I brought it over. Good Luck!"
