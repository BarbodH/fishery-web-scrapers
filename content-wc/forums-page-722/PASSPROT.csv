553901,Trailerguy,2006-01-19 08:36:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]Passports weren't required for ground travel into Canada until 2007. But it sounds like the whole thing is being renogtiated. Some kind of fedrally issued ID that costs 1/2 as much as a passport is the likely outcome. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby
553902,Guest,2006-01-19 08:51:00,0,"Here is an article from a reputable newspaper that should clear up everything. Basically if you are from the US and traveling by air to Canada, you need a passport or the new ""Travel Card"" to get back into the US by Dec 31 2006. If you are crossing the border by land, you get an extra year and have until Dec 31 2007 to get the travel card or passport. By Leslie Berestein UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER January 18, 2006 KEVIN LAMARQUE / Reuters Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced a new pass yesterday that will allow U.S. citizens to cross into Canada and Mexico with a $50 ""travel card"" similar to a driver's license. Less than a year after announcing that U.S. citizens re-entering the country at land borders would soon have to present passports, the Department of Homeland Security softened its approach yesterday, announcing that frequent border crossers will be able to apply for a lower-cost alternative that fits into their wallets. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff announced yesterday that a biometric ""passport card"" will be made available by late this year. Cardholders will be able to use them to enter the country at southern and northern land borders, forgoing their need to obtain a passport by the end of 2007 as was required initially. ""This new People Access Security Service, or PASS system card, will be particularly useful for those citizens in border communities who regularly cross northern and southern borders every day,"" Chertoff said in a statement. The federal government's decision to offer a passport alternative follows a spate of complaints that arose from border communities and businesses after new passport requirements were announced last April. A public comment period followed. Under those rules, which stem from a 2004 law, U.S. citizens will not be able to use state-issued driver's licenses, identification cards or birth certificates to re-enter the country after traveling within the Western Hemisphere. Documentation requirements for those returning from Mexico would be similar to those for citizens returning from Europe or Asia. The plan devised last year calls for those returning by air or sea from Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean and Bermuda to present passports upon re-entry by Dec. 31, 2006. Those returning by land from Canada or Mexico have until Dec. 31, 2007, before they will be asked to present passports. An estimated four out of five U.S. citizens do not have passports, according to data analysis of State Department and Census Bureau statistics. A passport costs $97. Chertoff did not specify how much the PASS system cards would cost, but a Hearst Newspapers story cited a Homeland Security spokesman saying that they would cost about $50."

553919,Guest,2006-01-20 08:32:00,0,Thanks for the update Dave. Is there anymore info as far as how long these ID will be good for? Just wondering if they will be good as long as the passports 10 years. Wingmann
553920,Guest,2006-01-20 09:42:00,0,"They better be 10 years. The whole idea was for these to be a cheaper alternative. If they are fifty dollars, and are only good for five years, then it would just make sense to spend the 96 and get a ten year passport."
