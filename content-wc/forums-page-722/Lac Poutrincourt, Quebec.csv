We have been to the Gouin Reservior the last 2 years, did well there, but the wanderlust in us dictates a change. We are close to selecting Lac Poutrincourt for the first week of August, 2006. Any comments pro or con about Poutrincourt would be appreciate, also driving directions from Erie Pa. Thank you,"
553648,Seanik,2006-01-06 11:33:00,218,"We are also looking at Club Trout Lake and Stramond Lake Lodge, any feedback on Poutrincourt, Trout Lake or Stramond Lake will be appreciated. I have read internet reports that Lake Poutrincourt can be rough for long periods of time and that is a major concern. Thank you in advance,"
553676,oldgoat,2006-01-08 21:01:00,14,"I have fished this lake three times in the last 10 years and I love the lake. Walleye fishing used to be very easy in the early years. it is slightly harder now, but it is worth the trip. Pike are big but can sometimes hard to find, I got a 42""er last year. Andre the owner is a great guy for a french/canadian. The workers are OK but not very talkative. The cabins have all been upgraded with showers so you don't have to take a bath in the lake anymore (man that was some cold u-know-what)The weather is cool in August, the wind kicks up around 1 every afternoon and makes a good time to go to the cabin to eat. Going out after dark is not adviseable even with GPS, to many big rocks and a few sandbars just under the surface. There are 8 cabins around the lake and we fished at least12 hours a day and vary rairly saw another boat. If you are going to go and want more info e-mail me and I would be happy to help."
553678,Guest,2006-01-09 00:21:00,0,"seanik- after spending last two years at gouin im not sure you would be satisfied with poutrincourt or stramond for that matter- if you been to the gouin who should have good quanity of walleyes- the places you are concidering dont have the quanity- the do have good quality but are fished abit harder that the gouin and therfore might be not as good- if you are concidering stramond that means you are goin on the clova road- on the clova road i would check out o-sullivan lake- o sullivan can be a bit of a puzzle sometime but if you do your homework it can be a great place. another place to concider is Air Tamarac out of clova flying to lake herbert.even thou they fly out of clove you dont take the clove road- you travel up thru parent to clove- much much better road- we have been to all the places named here and the ones you are concidering except trout lake - and the last ten years we have gone to lake herbert 8 times and on the gouin twice for a change, going to hebert this year. do a web search on poutrincourt, some one posted an excellent day to day report. very good reading and informative. if i can offer any other advise to help make your trip a sucess just ask"
553684,Seanik,2006-01-09 12:13:00,218,"Walley General Thank you for your comments, being retired old gents we like our comforts, hot showers, meals cooked for us, ect;. Some of the group have medical problems and don't like to get to far away from help so fly-ins are pretty much out. I would appreciate more comments from you here or contact me by e-mail at [email protected]"
553688,retire55,2006-01-09 14:23:00,1029,"Walley General: I've been following the thread out of general interest. Thanks for the heads-up of doing a search on Poutrincourt. I used Google to do the search and then read the 2002, 2003 and 2005 detailed fishing reports (from the same 3 guys each year). The reports were very informative. After reading those reports, I myself would have some concerns about the apparent amount of shallow water at Poutrincourt. Those three guys (one with 10 years experience on the lake) went thru one prop while on one of the trips. And Oldgoat posted that ""going out after dark is not adviseable even with GPS, to many big rocks and a few sandbars just under the surface."" They also seemed to spend a lot of time fishing one river rather than the lake. I don't know anything about the lake but I would have thought that more and bigger walleyes would have been available in the main lake (there must be some deeper water somewhere there) since those 3 trips were during the last week of July each year. As well, even though there are protected slot limits for walleyes there (nothing harvested under 12 inches and nothing harvested over 18 inches), I was surprised to read that these guys didn't catch very many walleyes of any size. Indeed, in one report, they referred to a 22 inch walleye as a trophy walleye. Too bad that a majority of folks (who fish remote Quebeclakes) don't post their fishing reports."
553748,Guest,2006-01-13 15:57:00,0,"If you are still reading threads. The river they refer to is to me just part of the lake. It is a narrow backstretch of water that goes about 3 miles or so into the woods(there is also a cabin back there) The current is not very fast, sort of a slow meandering thing great place to drift and jig. There is only one fast water area to get through at the beginning where it necks down to join the main lake. Lots of large walleyes back there if you can find them and take the time to catch them, got a few in the 6-8lb range back here. The main lake is mostly 2-3lbs stuff. Last year there was a main lake backwater that had fish suspended at 10 feet, and they were so thick you could walk on them. For those giving advice and have not been there. dont listen to them. Also I am 55 and had no problem. You can stay at the main lodge cabins if you wish not to cook. But all the other cabins are within about a half hour ride from the lodge if you need to get there fast. and the staff does patrol the lake to make sure nobody is hurt. Although the lake is so big you may only see them once a day. As I said after three times there I will still go back again in another year or two. This is not a great trophy walleye lake even though there are large fish there. It is just filled with good solid keepers that anybody would be happy to get."
