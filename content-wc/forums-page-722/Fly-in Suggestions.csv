553668,Guest,2006-01-07 20:10:00,0,Been to Canada for 20 years. By far the best fishing has been through Northern Outposts out of Armstrong. Ryan and Kathy Brady do a great job! Check out www.northernoutposts.com.
553672,Larry S,2006-01-08 11:42:00,666,"I will second what Mr Walleye said,have been with Northern Outposts for 4 yrs. Call them they can arrange 3 or 4 day trips with food package.The fishing is great for walleye and northern pike Larry S"
553680,jigman 2003,2006-01-09 08:04:00,981,"Hey, Mr. Walleye, did you get your flyer from the All Canada Show? $2 coupon on there. Too bad its from Monday to Wednesday, kind of tough to drink too many Labatts."
553687,Guest,2006-01-09 14:11:00,0,Try Moosepoint Lodge on Shikag Lake about 1 1/2 hour flight from Fort Francis
553694,Guest,2006-01-09 17:18:00,0,"Hey Jigman Yeah, I got it. I almost stopped over last weekend with my Canada video to share a beverage or two. I'm still planning on us going to the show. I've got to go Mon. or Wed. as I have a BB game on Tues. Is either day better for you?"
553695,jigman 2003,2006-01-10 07:27:00,981,Wed. would probably be better for me Mr. Walleye. I've been over at the jig shop most weekends. Usually got some cold ones over there.
553705,Guest,2006-01-10 14:36:00,0,Has anyone been to True North Outpost north of Emo? Looking to go on a fly-in trip and their site looks good. Has anyone gone with them? Thank you for your time. Russ
553708,Guest,2006-01-10 16:18:00,0,"They are located just down the lake from L&M Fly In. We looked at there lakes since they are in the same general area, but the lakes seem to be really small, our experience is that the smaller water typically produces smaller fish. I would compare the size of lakes with some of the other outfitters lakes. I highly reccommend L&M for their lakes and service, we have been very pleased with our experiences there."
553566,Guest,2006-01-01 15:13:00,0,Looking for a new outfitter within three hours of International Falls. I want a lake that is a sure thing for walleye. I hate to leave a place I have been going to for 25 years. It has great fishing and I know exactly where to go but service has really fallen off and it is more expensive than other outfitters I see on the internet. Looking for a five day trip with a food package. Any help would be appreciated.

Don and Annette are great people. You will find unmatched service and accomodations at their outposts. They have great fishing, and I feel their price is very reasonable for what they provide. This past August was my first year with them, and I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone. It was above my expectations, and those are pretty high. I also hear really good things about Northern Outposts also out of Armstrong. Please e-mail me if you would like more details: [email protected] Hope this helps. Mike"

You can do it quicker if you push a little. I find the drive to Armstrong is MUCH easier than to Dryden or Red Lake (especially). Don, Annette, Yolanda, and Jason are great people."
553596,scar,2006-01-02 18:25:00,196,"check out www.boois.com located on trout lake. drive to red lake and then take a 20 minute flight that gets you on over 100,000 acres of water. best all around lake i have ever been to. by all around i mean exceptional walleye,northern and lake trout all on one lake. i went 9 years in a row until we bought our own place on a lake near siuox lookout 4 years ago. scar"
553604,ONE TIME DAVE,2006-01-03 09:06:00,110,"This might be a longer drive for you but try Arctic Watershed Outpost out of Nakina. Web site is www.awonakina.com. Great people, fishing, service and price for what they provide. Have used them 9 times with 3 10 this June. E-mail if you have any [email protected]"
553633,Guest,2006-01-05 18:39:00,0,"I would reccommend L&M Fly In out of Clearwater Lake, Ontario. They are located about 1 hour from I Falls. They fly 160-220 miles north of there to some excellent walleye & pike lakes. We have never had a problem catching lots of walleye. They have great lakes, airplanes, service, equipment. They offer a food package as an add on, but it is not on there basic package. They are great people and will put you on a lake that fits what you are looking. you wouldn't be disappointed.www.lmflyin.com"
553634,Guest,2006-01-05 18:53:00,0,"super is right I have gone with L&M, Grant Lake is a nice small lake. Or go to a sport show."
553641,Guest,2006-01-06 00:54:00,0,"I would third L+M for their service, cabins, and lakes. Plus they own their own planes. When we did fly-ins a couple time and we had to wait hours for the hired planes to show up, not with l+m when they say they are going to be there on time they are."
