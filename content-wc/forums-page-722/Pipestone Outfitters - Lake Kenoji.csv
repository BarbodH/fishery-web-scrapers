It really depends on what time of year that you go if you want to catch big pike. If you go early in the season (late May to early June) the pike are located in the main lake of Kenoji but as the water warms up the pike seem to move out of the main body and go into the river systems that Kenoji is made up of. We went up there usually in late June-early July and found it hard to find pike in the main lake but the walleye fishing was great. We even caught a few ""blue"" walleyes that are known to be in the lake. We did manage to boat a few 40""+ pike on each trip but had to work for them and that involved running at least an hour up the river system and doing a rapids portage and then a main portage switching to other boats to get to a place that held big pike. Mike Henry the owner goes out of his way to make you feel welcome and provides everything you need to make you trip a success. The cabin is the only cabin on the lake and the only people you might see during your stay will be people canoeing down the river but they are far and few between. The cabin is just that, a cabin with soalr lights, wood heat and a solar water heater and frig/freezer. During our stay we did have a problem keeping the food cold due to the solar power and cloudy days. We have since then gone to a different outfitter since we could not get a good booking date due to repeats always booking the early dates when the pike are in the shallows in the main lake. But it is well worth the one-time trip to experience it. Good luck and let us know how you did if you go."
