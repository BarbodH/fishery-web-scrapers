553436,bushy,2005-12-22 18:55:00,17,I am thinking about going to Lac Seaul in 2006. Would like to take my 78 yr. old father on one Canadian trip while I still can. I have never been to Lac Seaul before but I read how great it is. The only month I can go is August. Looking into staying at Gold Pines. A friend was there in June 2005 and did real well in Saw Mill Bay. What kind of fishing could I expect in August and how far would I have to travel from Gold Pines. I have a 16' boat with a 40 horse. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

553468,Guest,2005-12-24 09:32:00,0,The people at Gold Pines camp are very friendly and hospitable. There are many places catch walleye in that end of Lac Seul.I would not be concerned about the size of your boat as long as you use common sense and watch the weather as you should on any lake. Good luck and say Hello to Peter and Bill for me.

553606,bushy,2006-01-03 11:49:00,17,Anyone else have any experience with this area in August? Thanks
553736,bushy,2006-01-12 18:14:00,17,Anybody?
553737,Guest,2006-01-12 18:32:00,0,12-15 minutes travel max will put you on tons of eyes. try the island right across from camp. dog island i think. goose island is about 10-12 minutes down the lake and always holds eyes. so do the little islands nearby. also lunker point just below goose. the bridge just downriver from camp produces some nice ones as does the little bay just above it. good luck.

Everything depends on where the wind is blowing. You can hit Steamboat Narrows and get in line there and catch a few. I hate Steamboat personally because you have to anchor and sit next to 10 to 20 other boats, and there is no drift fishing. I prefer to cover ground and bounce big jigs, or spinners. People do pull big fish from here. If you go straight through (heading south) Steamboat and follow the shoreline to your right, about a half mile up you will see a large rock sticking out off a point. We did very well on the north side of that rock, from almost shoreline in about 10 feet to 200 yards off shore in 24 feet of water. Great spot. The big island that forms the east side of Steamboat is also very good. We drifted the southeast side in 14 to 25 feet of water and did well. There are three small islands on the east side of the island that are good as well. One day you might go the extra 35 minutes and hit the sandbanks. Hit them on the right day and your arms will be tired, but they are a hall from Gold Pines. Easier to get to them from Fisherman's Cove area."

If this is the first time on the lake, get to know the area within five miles of the dock. There are plenty of fish and structure. Fish the windy side of anything and have patience."
