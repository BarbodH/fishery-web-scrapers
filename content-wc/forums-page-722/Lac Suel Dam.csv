""The work will be starting shortly on installing the new generator; however, this should not affect the lake level since most of the work will be done below the dam and the water flow to the generator will start once the work is complete. So far, the lake level has dropped very little this winter and our snow cover is over 2 ft. now."" Hopefully this will answer some of the concerns in this matter."
