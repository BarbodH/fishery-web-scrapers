Citing the dollar, 9/11, and the American economy, the resort will remain open this year and is taking bookings. They owe over 2 million to credit unions, and other creditors including airlines, Prov/Fed government, and advertising agencies etc. The whole article was in the Winnipeg Free Press today. My guess is that they will restructure and stay viable, we can only hope. The lodge is incredible. If you've been there you know what I mean. It catered mostly to high end corporate American companies."
