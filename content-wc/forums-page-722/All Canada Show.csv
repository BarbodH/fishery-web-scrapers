553305,Larry S,2005-12-14 17:32:00,666,"Hey Mr Walleye, I have been to Dearden twice in 2003 & 2004 The walleye size is excellent,caught many in 20 to 25inch range,I myself in 2003 caught 4 pike over 40 inches My other friends have also fished at Shouldice and Obashi. We were going to go to Blackbirch last year but couldn't reach the 6 person minimum. We ended up going to a new camp with Westley Outfitters out of Pickle Lake. The fishing wasn't nearly as good,although one of the guys did catch a 28.5 inch walleye. Never been to Windsor Lake,have you ever fished Blackbirch before this year?"
553308,Guest,2005-12-14 21:07:00,0,"Passport application now available at All-Canada Show For the first time, the United States Postal Service will be accepting passport applications at the All-Canada Show in most markets. Passport photographs will also be taken. To apply at the All-Canada Show, you must bring your certified birth certificate (needs a raised, embossed, highlighted or multi-colored seal) from county or state government (not a hospital document), and your current, valid driver's license. A Government ID, State ID or military ID will work for those who do not have a driver's license. Go to AllCanada.com for a listing of the markets where the USPS will be accepting passport applications. It makes perfect sense to consider getting a United States passport for your Canadian travels, says Jennifer Young, All-Canada Show president, because it simplifies entry into and out of Canada, or any other time you leave or enter the U.S. In the post 9/11 world, all countries are working to secure their borders by positively identifying everyone upon entry. The easiest way to do this is with passports. The U.S. Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 requires that by January 1, 2008, travelers to and from Canada, Caribbean, Bermuda, Panama and Mexico must have a passport to enter or re-enter the United States. A passport is an internationally recognized travel document verifying the identity and nationality of the bearer. A valid U.S. passport is required to enter and leave most foreign countries. Currently, a birth certificate and valid drivers license are all that is required to travel within the Western Hemisphere (Canada, Caribbean, Bermuda, Panama and Mexico). This is scheduled to change January 1, 2008 for land entry and January 1, 2007 for air and sea entry into the U.S. On those dates, it will be required by the United States Government that everyone (even its citizens) entering the United States be required to show a valid passport. Passport fees are in the $100 range and a passport is good for 10-years. Only the U.S. Department of State has the authority to grant, issue or verify United States passports. The Department of State designates the United States Postal Service to accept passport applications on its behalf. You must apply in person if you are applying for a U.S. passport for the first time; if your expired U.S. passport is not in your possession; if your previous U.S. passport has expired and was issued more than 15 years ago; if your previous U.S. passport was issued when you were under 16; or if your currently-valid U.S. passport has been lost of stolen. To prove your identity, you need a Certified birth certificate (needs a raised, embossed, highlighted or multi-colored seal) from county or state government (not a hospital document), and current, valid Driver's license, Government ID, State ID or military ID. Both parents must be present for a minor to obtain a passport unless the minor has a notarized written consent from the unavailable parent. If no ID is available, both parents can vouch for the minor's identity (Form DS 3053 - The Statement of Consent or Special Circumstances is available from the Department of State website). The US Postal Service will take your passport photographs right at the All-Canada Show. The fee for this service is $15. If you plan to bring your own photographs, they must meet the following requirements: You must have two identical color photos, 2x2 inches in size, taken within the past 6 months, and showing current appearance. Photos must be full face, front view with a plain white or off-white background. Image must be between 1-inch and 1-3/8 inches from the bottom of the chin to the top of the head. Photo should be taken in normal street attire. Uniforms should not be worn in photographs except religious attire that is worn daily. Do notwear a hat or headgear that obscures the hair or hairline. If you normally wear prescription glasses, a hearing device, wig or similar articles, they should be worn for your picture. For further information on obtaining a passport, accessing forms or finding a list of places that accept passport applications, go to the US Department of State website at: http://travel.state.gov/passport For passports for children under 14 years of age go to: http://www.travel.state.gov/passport...inors_834.html To find out more information on obtaining a birth certificate go to: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/howto/w2w/w2welcom.htm"

553761,Guest,2006-01-15 00:41:00,0,"The biggest thing an American should worry about when trying to get across the border are old DUI's. Believe it or not more people are refused entry into Canada because of a DUI that could be 20 years old. Get a passport too if you think on is needed. I bet down the road, they will change the rules again anyway. But get those DUI's looked into or any other stupid teenage or spur of the moment actions we all may have done in our younger years. Believe me on this one. Ask any resort"
553786,fishanytime,2006-01-16 09:29:00,63,"Checking for DUI at the border is a lot like speeding in the U.S., give them an obvious reason and you will be checked, be polite, take the sunglasses off, be reasonably well grommed and answer the few questions truthfully and they will get you across the border. Give them some reasons to suspect you are trying to pull something and they will pull you over and ask more questions. A very few folks can never understand how it works but I would guess these people have trouble following directions in other situations also. Having said that I hope we get the passport issue worked out, I don't believe it has a lot to do with security, it has more to do with someone be able to check where you have been and how often you cross the border. You should be able to accomplish that without a costly passport."

553358,Larry S,2005-12-17 22:50:00,666,"The Postal Service may pull out of the All Canada Show,Upper level management sources in Washington tell me.This is due to the fact that the USA and Canada have almost reached a reciprocal agreement that would allow citizens of their countries to travel across their borders without the need of a passport. You would still need a passport for air travel,but for ground travel it would not be necessary Bellbouy with many people posting phoney information here,I felt that the info saying that the Postal Sevice would be at the All Canada show was phoney.With some 28yrs I have in the Postal Service the management I know told me there was very little chance of this happening.It may still possibly happen,but with this agreement the majority of the fishermen going to Canada will not need a passport"
553367,Guest,2005-12-18 18:01:00,0,"Hey Larry This will be our first time to Blackbirch. Have gone to Dearden several times and to Obashi once. Fishing was always excellent. Average walleye 18-19"". Countless caught 22-27"". We stopped at Windsor last year on the way out, as Ryan had to drop something off. Looked like a great spot. Have a great trip and let us know how it goes!"
