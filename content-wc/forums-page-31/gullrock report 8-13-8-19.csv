I would say it was an average week. weather was odd. one day raining and then 84 next day. got on lake around 6am usually. morning bite was way better than afternoon and night bite. to me the quantity of walleye are there but quality seemed down....atleast for me. biggest was a 23. caught some 20-21's. most fish i got were 14-16's and caught many. also caught many 10-12's. i would say i averaged over 50 -75 walleye a day depending on weather. got most fish in like 24 feet to 28 feet. As another thread reports i do see a decline in fisherman on the lake and in camps. Border crossing was unenventful. 5 minutes to cross maybe. I have not fished in august in a long time. usually end of sept. and i still prefer that time. was a great week but do feel the quality of fish is down but many small walleye which is a good sign i guess.

We caught several 18 to 24"" walleyes, with 25"" being the largest. Pipestone Bay was our spot of choice on the lake. We caught several 30 to 38"" northern with 40"" being our largest. You're right on the weather. Too hot, followed by crazy rain, etc... The last two days the fishing picked up a bit. I won't do Aug again. I like June and mid Sept. Id love to hear some Bow Narrows reports."

6680824,Eckohlt,2022-08-20 15:31:00,3685,"8 to 10ft last week on keikewabik,in and around cabbage,big numbers."
6680834,prov1800,2022-08-20 16:43:00,5010,"So far whole season they have averaged 8-15.deeper parts of the lakes have been to 20 ft.Shallower water and weed beds have produced larger fish.I did see some large schools of walleyes deep but I know those are13-15 "" fish.Can catch those all over the shallows without killing them."

6680872,johnboat,2022-08-20 21:17:00,2014,How was the water level when you were there?The first week of June it was 4-5 feet high.Just curious.
6682488,valley366,2022-08-27 18:43:00,193,"Will add my report here as was there the week after you staying at Five Lakes Lodge. Fishing was outstanding. Don't know that have ever caught that many fish in one week consistently. Granted we had great weather all week. Fish even bit in dead calm 80 degree day yesterday. We don't count our fish on a daily basis but am sure we did over 100 each day. The only time we count was on Friday afternoon when we pulled into our final spot for the day. Had 8 minnows in the tank and pulled 19 fish in 45 minutes. And that was not our busiest time of the week.Will echo that size was down a bit from previous years. We consistently caught 15 to 16 inch fish. Fun fighters but struggled on the bigger fish. We ended with a pair of 22's, a pair 20's and I think 10 to 15 between 18 and 20. We mainly fish for eyes but the kid likes to punch the northern ticket too. He had a 34 and 37 inch with a handful between 27 and 30.All in all another great week in Canada.Water level I thought was close to a normal June depth. Slightly higher then what we saw in August last year. Looking at the lakes along the road on the way up everything looked like 3-4 feet below June levels."
