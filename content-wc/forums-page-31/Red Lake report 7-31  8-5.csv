6681044,Fishquest,2022-08-21 14:34:00,89,Sounds like a good time and we don't get many reports on fishing Red Lake itself on here usually the fly in's and I've always wondered about the fishing on the lake itself.

6677126,stevensinks,2022-08-02 17:48:00,330,"Just got back from the west end of Red Lake, lots of clouds and some rain. Fishing was good walleye are very plump and full of fight. My wife and I were rigging for them . I was using a worm on a rig and she was using plastic on hers it didnt seem to make any diffrence both were catching fish. pike seemed to be every olace and took lots of our rigs. The Walleye we were catching seemed to be 8 to 13 feet deep. The pike were 2 to 10 feet. When we were fishing for pike we used swim shad and blue fox but like I said we got alot of them on rigs fishing for walleye. The weather was for the most part in the mid 60 to low 70's . . Location didnt seem to make a big diffrence. We got fish in every bay on the west end. We never found lots in one place we would pick up a few then need to move. There were 7 of use sitting at the same dinner table. One couple that would go a long way to find fish and only fished pike got to camp Sat and by Thur evening had landed 300 of all sizes. Another group at our table fished hard and had a couple 100 walleye days . Good time"

6677530,LoDo,2022-08-05 08:52:00,721,Nice report! Leave Tuesday for 10 days on the west end. Excited to get up there again!
6680774,LoDo,2022-08-20 11:56:00,721,"Fished West End of Red Lake Aug 8 to 18. Minnows, Little Joe/Spinners with bottom bouncers worked well. Fishing was fair Aug 8 to 15. Fishing picked up Aug 16 and 17. We fished 8a to 1p and 7 to 930p. Weather was warm, water temps were warm at 69-71 degrees. I prefer 58 to 66 degree water temps when fishing walleye. Color of choice was silver, gold, bronze, etc... We tracked loads of fish at 40' but they didnt bite. The bite was 8 to 20'. AM bite was far better than PM bite. 40"" northern and 25"" walleye were the largest fish caught."
6680966,Ltrain,2022-08-21 09:32:00,4145,Thanks for the report. Sounds like a good time.
