Saturday: Started off with rain and some wind but we did ok just trolling around and looking the lake over a little. Our boat had (3) persons myself my older brother and my 9 year old grandson Jeremiah on his first trip. The excitement was high to say the least and it did not take long for J to connect on his first Canadian fish a small pike. We ended the first half day boating approx. 30 fish mostly trolling but we did stop in one spot and jig fish for awhile and J caught a White fish which would by the way be the only one caught in camp all week. Sunday: Started off with blue sky's and wind once again we trolled to explore the lake and picked up fish at a very reasonable rate both pike and walleye. We did come across a spot that we now call the figure 8 which were two islands that we would troll using a figure 8 pattern this spot became one of our go to spots. Not far from there we found a cove in an island with the wind blowing in that held a nice school of fish that also became one of our go to spots. We boated approx. 80 fish for the day and had a great time. Monday: Sun, Rain & Wind this would be the pattern of weather for the rest of the week with high winds and rain mixed with some sun. Again we headed out trolling from where we had left off the day before and we again had the same type of results picking up fish at a steady pace. We caught fish just about everywhere we went and ended the day with approx. 75 fish boated. Tuesday: Headed to figure 8 island and jig fished the best we could with the wind catching fish on every pass but could have done even better if the wind would have gave us a break all in all a great day and we boated approx. 100 fish. Wednesday: High winds and rain. We headed to the West shore line where the wind was blowing into and Man what an EPIC day of trolling my grandson caught 45 fish by himself trolling only and my brother caught at least that many. I did catch some fish 20-25 but really did not fish much driving the boat in those winds made it hard with 3 lines in the water, and my grandson spanking the fish like he was. I do not know if my grandson will ever troll with anything else other than a CD9 perch. What a sight to see!!!! Over 100 fish trolling!!! We now call this spot the 3 bays. Thursday: Headed back to the 3 bays and set up jig fishing and the muck fest was on. My grandson got bored and was handing out minnows to my brother and myself as needed and it made it very nice to rack up the numbers. Again another 100 fish day. Friday: Back to 3 bays area to troll for the most part again J was hot with his CD9 perch and busted the fish along with his Uncle Frank. We did a little jig fishing and caught fish consistently but again the wind played **** to control the boat. We ended up with approx. 75 fish for the day but we left the lake early do to a big storm blowing in and we all had had enough of being wet for the week. Thank you O'Sullivans Rainbow Lodge for a great time and showing my grandson some special attention. The Cabin #7 was great the upgraded camp boats where also great to fish from and ran great. See you next year same time same place God willing. PS: No problems at border or on the road both ways."
6671016,tadler,2022-07-06 18:37:00,43,"Great report ZiggyZag. We fished O'Sullivans May 28 - June 4. Fishing was outstanding with each of our 4 boats easily catching over 100 fish per day. It seems every place we tried caught fish with mother lodes along the wey. This is an outstanding fisheree that we will now call our last resort. Excellent cabins & boats, and great owners. No need to go anywhere else . Tom"

6679662,stjoeguy,2022-08-15 15:33:00,979,Sorry I missed your report earlier. I was wondering how you and your grandson did. I'm glad to hear that everyone had a good time and that the count down is still producing for you. I think it was clown color that was hot for you when we fished. On St. Joe you showed that you don't even need hooks to catch fish with that lure.
6681056,Fishquest,2022-08-21 14:45:00,89,"Thanks for the report, I've never fished the lake but have flown over it I don't know how many times but it always amazes me with the numbers and quality of all the fish in the reports. Someday I'll make the drive in and give it a go."
