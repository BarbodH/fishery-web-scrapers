I'm just curious as to where the water levels are now since they were so high earlier this season. Also, water levels on Abram, Minnitaki and Pelican would be helpful too. Thanks!"
6680812,stjoeguy,2022-08-20 14:52:00,979,"I haven't been to Deception Bay, but based on this LWCB chart it looks like Lac Seul is down from the June high but still higher than normal."
6680816,prov1800,2022-08-20 14:57:00,5010,Haven't been there this year.But fish the west side a lot and still don't see the beaches so that's telling me it's still high on all the English River waters.
6680912,Skywagon,2022-08-21 06:14:00,1106,"When I drove by Frog Rapids a couple of weeks ago the water level on the boat houses appeared to be nearer to normal than it was a month ago. As ProV said, if the beaches on the west side are still covered with water, the east side will be higher than normal also."
6681102,x4flatfish,2022-08-21 17:40:00,319,Just returned from Sioux Lookout today. Water levels are still high compared to the last several years. I do not use Deception landing. Can tell you water is probably 2 feet or more above normal pool and about 4 feet higher than last fall. Stay to your normal known routes as rocks/ reefs that you would normally see are not visible. We went from red pine bay at the end of Minitaki to around the rags in Lac Suel and only saw 1 floating log so the debris appears to be mostly gone. (Was my biggest fear) Would not think Deception landing would be any problem. We use the one by Hudson and it was a breeze as the higher water actually helps.
6681184,eyecatcher1,2022-08-22 06:31:00,323,"Thanks! I was hoping that most of the debris was gone by now. 4 feet higher than last year is a good thing too, it was pretty low last fall."
