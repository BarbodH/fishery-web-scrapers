6682342,GeoFish,2022-08-27 07:24:00,70,"I stopped by several years ago and asked about dogs and was told OK. When I went to book, I also seen the no dogs on the web site, so I called. Also, the web site says minimum 4 people for Okanse Lake. But Wayne said he would take two in August, so I gave him a deposit."
6682344,prov1800,2022-08-27 07:28:00,5010,Just call them and iam sure they will make exceptions.Just have to be carefull with other guests coming in case they are alergic to dog hair.Clarks have dogs at main camp so they like pets
6682356,Eckohlt,2022-08-27 07:43:00,3685,See any moose tracks??
6682362,GeoFish,2022-08-27 08:09:00,70,"Heard so moose. Also on the dogs. The plan was for me to sit in front of the plane and my wife in the back with the two dogs. The pilot was very concerned about the dogs coming into the front of the plane. She finally found a cargo net which she attached to the back of the front seats. Never had an issue with the dogs, they were well behaved for a first-time flight. Yes, I had a lady pilot. The best-looking bush pilot I have ever flown with!!"
6682368,mctbone,2022-08-27 08:14:00,26,Good to hear. We've done many fly-in trips with our 2 springers. They love these trips as much as we do and never had any problems with the plane rides.
6682370,prov1800,2022-08-27 08:15:00,5010,Yes Mary Anne sweet lady.lol.Theres pedals in front that need to be able to move so just in case something jams them wouldn't be good.
6682372,prov1800,2022-08-27 08:20:00,5010,If you plan another trip check out south Gull.It has 1/2 mile beach there to get some excessive and let your run.Great swimming beach to.
6682374,prov1800,2022-08-27 08:24:00,5010,Very good area for moose.Did see some tracks in few spots we checked.There were some beaches that all had tracks.Unfortunately didnt see any moose.But started fishing everyday after 9 am lol.
6682212,GeoFish,2022-08-26 13:34:00,70,I am looking at this lake for next year.Looking for above average Walleye. Their are two outfitters that have fly in cabins on Okanse. Anyone have any info please?
6682214,Eckohlt,2022-08-26 13:45:00,3685,Msg prov1800 he was fishing n moose hunting there 2019.
6682224,prov1800,2022-08-26 14:08:00,5010,"Been there to fish and did a moose hunt there.There is another cabin at west end of the lake.Neither trip there was no one there.We were there late August to fish and check out the area for moose.Fishing was very good in August and found them shallow everywhere and a bit deeper on the west side of the lake.On our moose hunt they were in 6-8 ft in mid Sept.Lots of eaters to 18"" and and largest 24"".some pretty good pike also and there is a lot of cabbage beds if your into pike but found the walleyes near and in the cabbage and lots of good sized perch.Cabin is very nice and comfy and has wood stove for some heat if needed.heres cabin and supper."
6682228,GeoFish,2022-08-26 15:01:00,70,Thanks. Trying to decide between a couple different lakes with Clarks.
6682284,prov1800,2022-08-27 05:38:00,5010,I've been to a few of their outposts and they have all been good trips.Just got back from there Latreille Lake outpost and that was pretty amazing with the American plan pkg.
6682294,GeoFish,2022-08-27 06:02:00,70,"With a group of 2, me and my wife. And 2 dogs we are limited to places to go. Just got back from Upper Wapesi. Dogs got to fish too."
6682304,Eckohlt,2022-08-27 06:29:00,3685,Goes to show at upper wapesi even dogs can catch fish!
6682314,prov1800,2022-08-27 06:49:00,5010,Loved upper wapesi myself.Great beach to let the dogs run.Excellent fishing in both upper and pusher.
6682334,mctbone,2022-08-27 07:13:00,26,"I'm puzzled by the presence of the dogs as Clark's website page on outpost rates states ""PLEASE NO PETS"". That's the primary reason we never considered their camps."
6682336,Eckohlt,2022-08-27 07:15:00,3685,Best to call there toll free number and hear it straight from them!maybe there's been some changes since covid!
