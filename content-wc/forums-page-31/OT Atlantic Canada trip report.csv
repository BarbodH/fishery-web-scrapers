We saw lots of harbor porpoise, a Minke and then the chase began. Capt was talking with a local fisherman about 6 miles away. An Orca in lower Bay of Fundy lead to the chase an eventual observation for 12-14 minutes of an incredible male (huge dorsal fin) killer whale. Capt after 20 years of doing whale watches finally saw the animal locally referred to as Uncle Tom. The whale about once a year veers up the Bay of Fundy for a day and then departs. The Capt was quite animated, videoed the animal with his phone and clearly was really excited. We were 90 minutes late coming in. The Capt went full throttle for over an hour trying to catch up to the whale which at times was cruising at 12.5 knots. Striped bass are everywhere in Nova Scotia. I caught dozens in a salt water pond, off piers andcasting along Cape Breton shores. Big fish are being caught to 30-40 pounds. I caught schoolie'sbest about 3-4 pounds.People of Atlantic Canada (New Brunswick, NS, PEI) are so warm, friendly, helpful. Seafood is amazing, had a wonderful lobster roll for $16 CA. Sitting around a campfire on Cape Breton, we saw Elon Musk's Starlink satellites 35 in one line, 50 in another on back to back nights. Cape Breton as well as its incredible beauty offers magical star gazing and Starlink truly felt like a scifi scene of 40 years ago. Margaree & Miramichi rivers were closed due to warm temps. Stripers it is. Tourism is way down in the Atlantic provinces."
