6680394,Geno,2022-08-19 08:10:00,91,John....I enjoy your posts and your pics but unfortunately I don't subscribe to Fakebook.
6680424,prov1800,2022-08-19 09:32:00,5010,Here's a couple of pics for you.Basically fished for pike all day and caught some walleye on pike lures.Probably put 150+ pike in the boat.
6680478,bode,2022-08-19 12:39:00,39,"Thanks for your post about Zizania, brought back a great memory of fishing with my dad and cousin back in 1974. We camped on Anishinabi and portaged to walleye lakes north and west of the camp. Believe it or not we portaged back to Zizannia via a small super winding stream. We began fishing and came around a point in the lake and my cousin saw a small fly in camp. He immediately turned the grumman sport boat around and headed back. He never wanted to fish where others had been."
6680482,Geno,2022-08-19 12:48:00,91,Very nice John....thank you !

6681048,Fishquest,2022-08-21 14:39:00,89,Sounds tough......I'd hate that
6681050,Fishquest,2022-08-21 14:41:00,89,"Thanks for the pics report, pilots scare the **** out of me when they dip the wing that close to water. I know they do it daily but I don't have to like it when i'm in there."
6681054,Eckohlt,2022-08-21 14:44:00,3685,"My wife elbowed a pilot when he did that,scared the crap out of her,he just smiled after the jab she gave him."
