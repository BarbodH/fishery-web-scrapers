The only thing I found strange was that the officer ask me what I did for a living. I don't recall ever being asked that before in all the years I have crossed. Got up to Sleepy Dog Cabins with a very uneventful trip. Got a boat that afternoon and picked up where we left off of in late July. Fishing was very good even though the weather was also very good in some peoples opinion. It was in the 70's and it never rained the whole time we was there. That is a first for me in Canada. I tell people to expect at least a 5 minute shower every day and we got none! Still catching fish in the 12-15 foot range water pulling Flicker Shad in size 5. It was just the wife and I this trip and she caught the biggest as well as the smallest fish and she doesn't go out until after my 10 o'clock return in to get her. We didn't catch as big of fish as we did the last trip but we caught plenty. I also got to meet Sheepman who happened to be there the same week. I can tell you those guys fish ""hard"" every day. Their was actually 3-4 groups from Iowa in camp this week. It was the same coming back across the border with one vehicle in front of me with a boat and he got pulled over and I wasn't there 5 minutes. Later, Jay"
6682756,sheepman,2022-08-29 04:47:00,98,"I would echo everything Jay had to say except our border crossing Saturday AM at 10 took about 45 minutes. Catching walleye on jigs and minnows and used some crawler harnesses. Picked up some crappies this year while fishing walleye. Couldn't keep northerns off the line, good share of cutoffs this year. Biggest walleye was 27"", crappie 14"". I too was asked what I did for a living when I crossed, found that a little strange as well. Already booked August 19 for next year. Good to meet you Jay! Nice to put a face with a name."

Our group has been asked that question several times over the years.. We always assumed it was a question intended to make sure the driver really knew the other folks in the truck. Now we can just answer (we are all retired..!!!! Glad you guys had good trips"
6682840,jambi,2022-08-29 10:24:00,504,"Probably goes along with the almost typical question: ""How do you guys know each other""? This year I said, ""Our wives are sisters"""
6682872,Bigtaproot,2022-08-29 12:12:00,900,"I always got asked about what i was doing. Now, as the head meatman, I just say ""Food Processing Executive"" and they usually respond with envy since they are sitting all day in a little hut"
6682880,Eckohlt,2022-08-29 12:27:00,3685,Tap do you get to sample your work items??
6682932,sheepman,2022-08-29 17:14:00,98,"Apparently Banker, retired postal worker and carpenter was good enough"
6682978,Cgillespie,2022-08-29 19:47:00,120,"They asked us the same question at the Winnipeg Airport. I thought about telling them I worked in the import/export business, but decided school teacher sounds pretty innocent."
