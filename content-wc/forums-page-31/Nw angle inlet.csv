6681336,Net_Man,2022-08-22 16:30:00,580,Most people that stay at the resorts on the Islands such as Oak Island launch their boat out of Youngs Bay Resort. This is located south of Angle Inlet. I know Youngs Bay Resort offers plain cabins but you can look at their website. If I am not mistaken they do not have air conditioning that might be desired for a summer trip. Their is also several resorts on Oak Island as well as Flag Island that offer this service. Angle Inlet has places also but I am not familiar with any of them.

I've stayed multiple times at both places, albeit quite a few years ago. Prothero's is owned by the same family as when I was last there forty years ago. Angle Outpost was Peterson's when I was last there. I also stayed at Carlsen's, but I'm not sure if they're still operational. Anyway, both Protheo's and Angle Outpost have nice little harbors. I switched from Prothero's to Peterson's because it was closer to the area I liked to fish. I enjoyed my stays at both places. I had zero complaints. Angle Inlet is an interesting place to visit. My gripe has always been with the gravel road into the Angle. Feel free to send me a PM if you have further questions."
