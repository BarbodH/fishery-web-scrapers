6681866,johnboat,2022-08-24 20:20:00,2014,"Wild horses couldn't drag me in to that particular A&W!We stay right across the road, so it's handy. But after the crazy comedy of errors that have happened at least 3 years in a row, I just can't go there. LolDon't get me wrong, I love a good Papa Burger, just not there.I hope your luck will be better."
6681872,rather-be-fishin,2022-08-24 20:54:00,429,"Johnboat, Hmmmmmm Thanks for the input, May have to reconsider other places. RBF"
6681426,Eckohlt,2022-08-23 04:18:00,3685,"It won't be long and everyone from Thunder Bay will be moving to the states because we have more junk food,thunder bay will be no more.lol,Eck says hi to big momma tap she's a hard working lady."
6681432,Bigtaproot,2022-08-23 05:24:00,900,"I am not speaking of junk food like chips. Just look at any menu up there and it looks like cheap bar food with the addition of walleye and poutine. I'm not talking about places like Toronto and Vancouver with your class did eating citiesBut I'm speaking about some of the dumps along the way to our standard fishing destinations. Out of curiosity, will places like Amazon delivered to these cities? If so, then you could get some decent stuff online and become a good cook"
6681434,Eckohlt,2022-08-23 05:37:00,3685,"Well tap I can't answer on the Amazon thing,but I'm sure the people from Thunder Bay are eating just fine,What exactly would you like to eat on the way up fishing??you would think Thunder Bay would have something you like,how about a big greasy pizza? That's what I could go for."
6681460,Lovetofish,2022-08-23 07:46:00,458,It may not be the fastest place but we stop at Pizza Hut the last several years and have been satisfied with that.
6681510,Bigtaproot,2022-08-23 11:09:00,900,no question about Thunder Bay. Agostino's is one of the best itallian deli's i have ever been to. I was more commenting on places like Dryden and cities in the far North.
6681530,Eckohlt,2022-08-23 11:58:00,3685,Gotcha tap!
6681576,CI_Guy,2022-08-23 15:32:00,2118,"Whenever this topic comes up I'm always surprised to see Patricia Inn come up. The 1st time we ate there the helpings were huge but the food was cold and tasteless. After reading a few positive things about it we tried again. The portions were still large and the food was still cold but instead of tasteless it was over salted and inedible. It's the only time I've ever seen ,my wife send food back! I agree with x4flatfish and MikeAnkeney the A&W has consistently been better than average when we've eaten there."
6681616,Skywagon,2022-08-23 19:48:00,1106,"With a town of 8000 people your eating choices are going to be limited. The OP asked about carry out, or a place they could eat outside, that is limited to A&W, McDonalds, Pizza Hut or Subway. The Riverview Lodge has outside dining and very good food, but of late have been closed at lunch because of shortage of staff. Another decent place not mentioned, is the Curling Club, but they have no outside dining. There has been a rumor of a Boston Pizza coming to town, not holding my breathe. Lack of many dining choices are one of the downsides of living in a sparsely populated area, but for some of us the positives far outweigh the negatives."
6681626,rather-be-fishin,2022-08-23 21:52:00,429,"Thanks everyone for your responses. It has been very helpful! Good to know what the options are for lunch & eating outside or take out & what places are still open. Skywagon, I totally understand the limited options in the area & appreciate your comment. Looks like we will plan to give A&W a try. Next question. Are there any scenic parks, wayside rests or picnic areas to eat lunch at? Thanks again for all the great suggestions! RBF"
6681642,Skywagon,2022-08-24 04:25:00,1106,"If you are headed to the Sioux Lookout side of Lac Seul there is a nice park on the left side (north) on highway 17 about 10 minutes out of Dryden. If you are going to the Ear Falls side of Lac Seul nothing nice (that is close to Dryden) comes to mind, but I might be missing something. ProV1800 runs that route all the time, he might have a suggestion."
6681264,rather-be-fishin,2022-08-22 10:47:00,429,Headed up to Lac Seul on 8/26/22 & looking for recommendations for getting lunch to go or outdoor seating options in DRYDEN? Thanks in advance. RBF
6681268,Jesse-WI,2022-08-22 11:00:00,534,"We are going to eat lunch that day in Fort Frances, but need dinner options between Dryden and Ear Falls."
6681284,skindzier,2022-08-22 12:12:00,137,The Patricia Inn is good. Great cheesecake.
6681294,Carnhzkr,2022-08-22 12:52:00,964,"We always get sandwiches at the Subway right on Hwy 17. We often just eat there, but sometimes we get the dressing on the side and stop and picnic on our way toward Ear Falls. We've stopped at the pullout just as you enter Vermilion Bay, and we've picnicked at both the Wabigoon Falls and Perault Falls along 105. There's also a nice looking rest stop with toilets on the east side of 105 which looks over a lake, but I've never stopped there."
6681316,Eckohlt,2022-08-22 14:19:00,3685,"My choice would be tuna sub,get the gut ready for eye everyday."
6681328,Mojo-NC,2022-08-22 15:45:00,1929,"We like to begin our Canada trips with a nice dinner at the Riverview Lodge in Dryden. We generally fly up to INL in the morning and then drive to Dryden, so we don't usually arrive until dinner time. We're ready for a nice dinner after a long day of traveling. It may be a little more upscale than what you're looking for though. Sometimes we stay there too. It's a very rustic inn, but sometimes it is difficult to get a reservation there because it fills up pretty quickly.https://www.theriverviewlodge.com/menus"
6681332,btyreprich,2022-08-22 16:06:00,1067,"Several times on our drive up to Ear Falls, we'd stop along the road and have fresh made sub sandwiches. I'd slice the bread and tomatoes while others would open up the luncheon meats and shredded lettuce. Don't forget the red wince vinegar! Of course this requires the weather to cooperate but it is different & delicious."

Looking at that menu provided, I don't know how people can live up there and eat that diet of pretty crappy food nonstop"
