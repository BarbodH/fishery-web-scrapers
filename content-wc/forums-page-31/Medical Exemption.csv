6675232,ManitowishWaters,2022-07-25 19:06:00,39,"Well....I got my first shot....had horrible neurological reactions. Talked with 3 border agents who say I qualify and have a dr's note describing my situation. I need a pre test, and arrival test. Everyone says it should be a go, but it isn't a go till I'm in the boat jiggin&#x1f600; Anyone else do this yet? Thanks for any and all info. Crossing at FF so hope to complete the remote arrival test asap there. Cautiously optimistic."
6675250,KC Walleye,2022-07-25 20:06:00,274,Sorry for your reaction. Best wishes on your entrance to Canada. I didn't know they were offering medical exemptions .learn something new every day. Give us an update when your journey is complete. Hope you feel better soon!

6675338,ManitowishWaters,2022-07-26 07:09:00,39,"I hear ya. I am traveling alone and am 100% ready to be turned around, but I have all those boxes checked and its the best shot I've had in 3 years so we shall see."
6675340,NARDA 1,2022-07-26 07:12:00,636,"If you haven't already, I would contact the Fort Francis border crossing and speak with the officer in charge, on site, and get his name so you have someone to refer to if there is a problem."
6676038,Fishquest,2022-07-28 17:12:00,89,"Best advice there, get the word from them and the name of that person along with time and dates all documented and you should be good. Good Luck I hope it works out for you."
6679460,ManitowishWaters,2022-08-14 14:04:00,39,Just got back this past Fri. Border went smooth. Arrival test was a bit of a pain since no on showed up to do my virtual test in the time slot I booked. Just got my results today after being back in the States for 2 days&#x1f606; Anyways had all my paperwork ready to go and needed all of it. 571 Walleyes and a couple big pike made it all worth it.
6679466,walleyecheek,2022-08-14 14:24:00,2231,"Yeah, well nobody ever accused the Canadian border patrol of being to .........well you know ........LOL."
6682040,New Guy Bill,2022-08-25 12:10:00,7,Nice haul of fish !!!I just looked over the procedures myself through the provided links. Did you quarantine for 14 days after arriving in Canada?
