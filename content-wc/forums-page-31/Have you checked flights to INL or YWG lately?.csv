6682010,LoDo,2022-08-25 10:23:00,721,Theres easily 1 million ppl that depend on Winnipegs airport for international travel. Those ppl got hosed. Those folks have to now connect in Toronto or Calgary to get anywhere in the US.
6681352,NM_Trout,2022-08-22 17:14:00,1094,"Holy cow... airfare has absolutely blown up in cost. About 2.5X the rate of earlier this year. Dang. Was trying to get a trip put together for some folks who have never been to Canada for fishing, and airfare is going to be a huge wet blanket."
6681370,LoDo,2022-08-22 18:35:00,721,"Tell me about it. Wait until you fly to your destination and dig into the rental car too. For us, the no flights to Winnipeg is a killer. I don't think most Canadians realize there isn't an international flight to Winnipeg right now. Let me back up, if you fly to MSP you can get into Winnipeg (one flight option x daily) at 8p. Wherever you live in the states you can't fly into Winnipeg unless you connect in MSP and arrive into Winnipeg at 8p. This is a killer. You can connect in Calgary or Toronto, but those connections are brutal. Not worth it. Your best bet is flying to MSP and driving or flying to Int Falls and spending $1500 on a rental car. Its tough these days. Best of luck!!!"
6681392,bthomas3333,2022-08-22 19:46:00,465,I recently booked a quick trip to get one more late Sept trip in. I also live in NM. I got a ticket to Las Vegas on SouthWest and then bought the Non-stop 2x a week flight to Winnipeg on Westjet. They fly the route Non-stop Thursday and Sunday.Not perfect but the LAS to Winnipeg flight wasn't bad.Brett
6681598,Mojo-NC,2022-08-23 17:48:00,1929,"It's the last short leg of the trip from MSP-INL that makes flying so expensive. All of our flights to INL go through MSP. I just checked using a September Friday-Friday example trip to INL from RDU and prices were from $640 - $1060. We can fly to MSP for $360 (it used to be around $200). However, the extra 5 hour drive is brutal when added to the rest of the day's travel."
6681764,Mojo-NC,2022-08-24 12:43:00,1929,"Geez, I don't know if this is a recent change or if he just got screwed, but my buddy just flew to MI this morning. They charged him $150 to check his rod case for a Delta flight. They have always charged us the standard rate for a rod case - the same rate as checking a first bag ($30). They also made him go to the special services desk to check it in. We've never had to do that either. Our standard routine is to check all of our bags (including the rod holders) with the skycap at the curbside and toss them a nice tip. I'm interested to hear about flying experiences for anyone who has traveled recently. We also lost a day of fishing this year (July) because Delta delayed our flight so many times that we could not make our connection to INL that day and had to stay overnight in Minneapolis. Of course, the earliest flight to INL the next day was 12:30 PM. In the 20 years that we've been going to Canada, that's never happened to us before. Higher airfares, less flight options, and poorer service. That's a bad business model."
6681788,Cgillespie,2022-08-24 14:02:00,120,"When I flew from Memphis to Winnipeg in June, the Delta agent only charged me $50 for my rod case. I think it's up to the ticket agent and whether or not they are jerks. Our only issue was the short connection in Minneapolis coming back, we made it to the gate for our flight to Memphis with about one minute to spare. I was very pleased with Delta customer service."
6681818,isumoose,2022-08-24 16:07:00,14,"Flew to Fort Mac last Sep on Delta. Rod Caddies treated as standard baggage. Not over-sized or special. Not true on 2018 though. Special exorbitant rate for them then. Cheaper to ship FedEx to our hotel and back home. We're headed back to Fort Mac/Cree Lake in 3 weeks on Delta/Westjet. Brett, where are you headed on your September trip if I may ask?"
6681868,bthomas3333,2022-08-24 20:26:00,465,Taking advantage of the 50% off deal at God's River Lodge. Taking my son for a 4 day trip to try to catch some fall colored Brookies. Maybe we will find a few deep weed beds for pike and maybe see if we can find some lakers on the rocks doing their thing. Main target is the beautiful God's river and brook trout. Sept 23-27.Brett
6681882,LoDo,2022-08-24 21:27:00,721,"Mind blowing Winnipeg doesn't accept more international flights from US cities. Vegas on Thurs and Sun, MSP once x daily. All the arrival and departure times are brutal."
6681916,Cgillespie,2022-08-25 04:11:00,120,"I believe that pre-Covid, United also serviced Winnipeg, but pulled out during Covid and have not returned. Before Covid, Air Canada had two flights a day from Memphis to Toronto. Those have not returned and probably never will."
