6682128,combine_billy,2022-08-26 07:37:00,151,I bought my son in law a Garmin inreach for Christmas last year so I could borrow it when I go to Canada
6681820,GeoFish,2022-08-24 16:10:00,70,Looking for a good place to rent a phone for a fly in next year. Going through International Falls.Any suggestions?
6681824,reddemon2,2022-08-24 16:35:00,255,Most fly in camps have phones for rent
6681844,N_of_Quibell,2022-08-24 17:31:00,151,"I rented from Outfitter Satellite for years and was always satisfied with their service. However, I bought a Garmin InReach several years ago, and don't bother with the sat phone anymore."
6681930,GeoFish,2022-08-25 05:20:00,70,Thanks. I am going in again with Clark's next year. They do not rent phones. I want one for emergency use only.
6681942,prov1800,2022-08-25 05:59:00,5010,Depends where your going with Clark's.If your at one of there outposts that has wifi then you can do wifi calls.
6681944,jambi,2022-08-25 06:02:00,504,+1 for the Garmin InReach. A few of us went in and bought it together. We share it for trips other than Canada. The service is able to start/stop whenever you want with a small annual upkeep fee.
6681950,prov1800,2022-08-25 06:21:00,5010,I've had the Garmin inteach expedition for couple of years now.I keep a pkg on it year round as iam always out of cell 14 service.The expedition can Bluetooth to my cell phone and it has earthmate app and can email and text from my phone.it will also bring up any map of any lake as where I am now on my Lowrance GPS the particular lake iam on is not on the navionics but is on the Garmin map.well worth the 14 bucks a month.This unit can be used anywhere in the world.
6681986,'Taterguy,2022-08-25 08:45:00,33,"+3. Bought a 66i this spring and used it this summer on a fly in. I'm not very tech savy but I was able to figure it out. It may take a minute to get a reply to a txt but it works. I could leave it in the south facing window sill to get the sats and use my phone with blue tooth to text from anywhere in the cabin/immediate area. The wife was not amused when i sent her a txt from the outhouse, but I was. She was also able to follow our drive up. It is peace of mind on the 502. In fact, we flew in with two other guys that were going to a different camp, they too had a 66i. His map had more detail than mine and that reminds me I need to figure that out before we head north again this weekend."
6681998,Jimmy Mac,2022-08-25 09:52:00,96,I posted a similar question in March of this year. Try searching “Satellite Phone Rental” in the “General Discussion” or “Canadian” forums and you’ll find some good info. Hope this helps. Jimmy Mac
6682022,NM_Trout,2022-08-25 10:56:00,1094,"+1 for outfitter satellite phones. I rented from them this year for my trip and it was mostly painless. If you are renting for the first time, they will only ship to the address which is associated with your credit card. I ended up with them after shopping a lot of the competition. Stick with Iridium. We were NW of Redlake, and had only one dropped call all week. It was a good comfort to be able to check in with home and makes sure nothing had caught on fire while we were gone :-)"
