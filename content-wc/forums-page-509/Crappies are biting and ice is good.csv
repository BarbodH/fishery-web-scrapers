I was out on sunday and did really good. Also Lake trout season opens up on saturday Jan. 1st. There seems to be about 8-10 inches of ice on the trout lakes. No slush at all. There is only about 3 inches of snow on the ice, so travel by sled or quad is perfect going. For more Nestor Falls fishing reports and ice conditions check out www.anglersproshop.ca"
