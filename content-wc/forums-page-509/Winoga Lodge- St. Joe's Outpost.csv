1258619,northsky99,2010-12-31 05:17:00,41,Anybody no the rates for the boat-in to ST.JOSEPH lake I don't see it anywhere on their site . thanks
1258876,IaDave,2011-01-01 10:52:00,476,It's right at $1000.00 for 7 days with a minimum of 6 people.
1239216,IaDave,2010-09-29 10:45:00,476,Anyone been to their newer outpost on St. Joes? I understand you can fly-in or boat-in. Price is very attractive for the boat in for 7 days.
1239604,phishfearme,2010-09-30 18:07:00,1242,hey dave - how's thing been with you? i looked at the winoga web site and found the St Joe outpost cabin - seems like a nice option to achieve pretty nice isolation and avoid flyin costs. didn't see any rates posted - what's the cost for a week there via boat? there's a number of lodges on st joe also. we're considering thousand lakes outpost on kearns lake out of armstrong for next year - try thousandlakesoutposts dot com. he has a number of boat cache flyin lakes that he can take you to also. we may not have enough guys to make up an 8 man group which would get us each a free day at one of these lakes - let me know if interested. phish
1239614,wallydave,2010-09-30 18:58:00,2151,"I checked the website, I didn't see anything about thier rates. It looks like a good place, but after a couple of years without a trip up north they all look good! Luckily I have a trip to Goose Bay on Lac Seul lined up for June '11!"
1239674,dkrusin,2010-10-01 07:24:00,97,"Been by Winoga Lodge many times via boat, looks like a very nice place. Met the owner/manager at the ramp and seemed like a super guy. The place is located in a great part of the lake and you will catch fish..lots of fish. You will need a gps and someone to lead you out there the first time, the chance of making it out there the first time on your own would be 1 out of 10. Lots of nasty sunken reefs, a place called Boulder City and many many islands. A guide for a few days would be recommended but once you get to know this lake you'll not want to go anywhere else. Good Luck!"
1239678,IaDave,2010-10-01 07:49:00,476,Yes- The owner Dick is a great guy. Part of the deal is when he boats you in he stays the first day and fishes with you to show you around and then he leaves the next morning.
1239948,Walleyeski,2010-10-02 18:49:00,40,Been to Winago Lodge-Lake St. Joe's Outpost twice. Cabin is very nice. Wouldn't try to get there without Dick. Lots of rocks! Caught lots of walleye's and northern's. Been going to Winago Lodge's main camp and outposts for about 15 years. You would have a hard time finding a better person than Dick.
1252682,Guest,2010-12-01 09:08:00,0,I would appreciate hearing from anyone that has been to Winoga outpost on Lake St. Joseph. My e-mail address is cmbiehle at yahoo dot com. I am in charge of selecting next years destination and look forward to trying this place out.
1253344,jrems,2010-12-04 15:44:00,17,"Have not specifically been to their St Joe outpost but have been to their other two outposts, both late fall and winter. They are top notch accomadations and from what I have heard ST Joe is the ""Hilton"" of outpost accomadations. Everything was hauled in on a barge which included the turned logs. Dick will definitly show you were the fish are and loves to fish. I have been going to their main camp for over 25 years generally at least twice a year and never been disappointed. The main camp is a short trip boat in and has access to Minitakki and Lac Seul which Dick also does day trips too. My girls started going 25 years ago and now want Dad to take them and their husbands up next summer."
1256693,Guest,2010-12-20 11:15:00,0,Just wanted to thank everyone for the information regarding Lake St. Joe. We booked for the 1st week of July at Winoga Outpost. I have never fished this lake but have heard many good things. Thanks again for the insight. Chris
1258558,Fred_G,2010-12-30 16:18:00,908,Chris - I just booked the same week at The Old Post on Lake St. Joe. I spend all my time fishing near the Winoga Outpost cabin so look for a white Lund. Hope to see you on the lake!
