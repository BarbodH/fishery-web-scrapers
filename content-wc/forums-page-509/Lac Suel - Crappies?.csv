We have however, caught an occassional Sauger, Whitefish, Bass, Sunnies and Crappie & several Northern. RBF"

1258021,Skywagon,2010-12-28 05:23:00,1106,"I have seen sunny and even an occasional crappy day fishing on Lac Seul, maybe that is what he meant. Have never heard of a crappie or sunfish on Lac Seul. This year we did catch our first crappie on Wabigoon, don't know why someone was silly enough to dump them in, but not a good thing for an already struggling lake system in my opinion."
