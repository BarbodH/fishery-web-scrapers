Wondering if anyone may have stayed their, and would share their experience relative to both the camping accomodations and the owners. Thanks in advance."
1258337,tackleman,2010-12-29 15:50:00,444,"I don't know about Merkles camp but on the same chain of lakes is Habers Lone pine camp and they have camping and cabins. the wife and i try to get there at least once a year for the restaurant they have at the camp. it brings in their own chef from Germany and the food there is fabulous.Anyway this could be another option for you, google their camp and see if it suits your need, if it doesn't , give the restaurant a try sometime, I don't think you 'lll be disappointed."
1258457,Blue Lk,2010-12-30 08:34:00,269,"I have to ask:Why wabigoon lk? There are so many lakes in the area to chose from.Also are you bringing your own boat?What are your requirements? Water & septic hookup,docking etc,etc?http://www.ontariossunsetcountry.ca/camping.cfm"
1258467,Downrigger,2010-12-30 10:00:00,60,"Have been to Sioux Narrows, Kenorqa, Vermilion Bay, and Ear Falls area. Have considered Wabigoon as it appears to be centrally located, and as we have our own boat, enjoy exploring new and different waters. Our intention is to purchase a trailer in the area, requiring sewer, water and electric, and do want dockage with electricity. We would then store trailer on site over the winter months."
1258511,Ranger NB,2010-12-30 12:55:00,15,"Great idea, but as Blue LK insinuated, I have to wonder why not base out of a better lake than Wabigoon. There are camp ground options in that area, on good lakes like Eagle, Rugby, ect, that are still centrally located with more consistant fishing. You might ask on this board for other alternatives. Something else to consider, may be the legality of leaving the trailer in Canada? You may end up having to take it back and forth, as I have read of non-residents getting fined for leaving boats and trailers, on random checks. A call to Canada Customs might be in order. Everyone's dream. Have fun next summer."
1258570,Downrigger,2010-12-30 17:26:00,60,"Do appreciate everyone's input. Have emailed Canada dept regarding leaving trailer unit in Canada over winter months, and will post responce when I get. However, I am curious about the ""inconsistence"" fishing on Wabigoon. I have not been on that water, but am getting mixed reports - it is a stop for the pro. walleye tour, and with connection to Dinnowac, a total of 50,000 plus acres of water to explore. We have fished LOTW's twice, Eagle Lake twice, and this last Sept. Lac Suel. Lac Suel by far out produced all the other lakes in a two week time period. Our thinking is that if we were centrally located, having approx. 4 months, we could visit many lakes, and given that time period, we would be able to average out the good and bad fishing days. I have visited web sites on Blue n Rugby, but didn't see that they offered the full service hookups we are looking for, unless I missed them. Again many thanks for the input. Phil"
1258642,Skywagon,2010-12-31 07:45:00,1106,"Downrigger,It sounds like finding a full service campground is the key to your situation. My first thought is to consider Lac Seul, one of the lakes in that system, or a lake in that area. From that location you could trailer to explore other lakes, as you had mentioned. On the east side of Lac Seul is Sioux Lookout, there are countless lakes in that area, such as Minnitaki, Abrams and you are in range of the town. On the west side of Lac Seul there is the Ear Falls area, again great lakes, like Gull Rock, Wabby, along the way to the town of Red Lake. You had mentioned Merkels, it is a one and a half (1 1/2) hour drive to Lac Seul from there, one way. The point is, why not be stationed where there is great fishing and venture out from there, on the occasional day trip? Here is a site that may help in camp ground selection http://www.canadafishing.ca/campgrounds.cfm . Feel free to PM, I live in the area."
