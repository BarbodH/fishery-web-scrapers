1258363,sault eyes,2010-12-29 18:02:00,268,I have a friend in his 60's that uses a slig shot made by cobra. He gets quite a few with it too!
1258443,Skywagon,2010-12-30 06:49:00,1106,"@Lunker, I can understand your concern about losing birds, but that just really does not happen, think sitting bird, close, head shot. These birds are in, or on the edge of thick bush. In Ontario a gun does not need to be in a case in your vehicle from 1/2 hour before sunrise until 1/2 hour after sunset. You cannot shoot out of a vehicle, but if not on a highway, may step out and shoot. These birds are prolific and continue to thrive with no noticable effect from hunting, thus the generous limits. The ruffed grouse are sometimes called chickens by the locals, because they taste so good (not quite so for the spruce grouse). Grouse season is a right of Fall and many are as passionate about it, as fishing for walleye. When in Rome..."
1258636,2Labs,2010-12-31 07:15:00,685,"They are dumb in the Kenora area, too, Lunker. One can just walk down the roads and trails and literally pick them off. BUT, it is much more fun having a pair of Labbies flush them and retrieve them.PLUS, once down, they sure can be hard to find (if you didn't ground-swat them in the first place -- if you did, then finding them is no problem)."
1257963,GarryB,2010-12-27 17:45:00,365,I would like to get the contact information for some of the top ruff grouse guides in the Lac Suel area that hunt with the pointing breeds of dogs.Thanks
1258001,SeulAreaWalleye,2010-12-27 20:31:00,100,"Gary, In this area there is no need for dogs or guides on grouse...they are everywhere! Many roads/ trials to travel close by Sioux lookout."
1258002,Outfitter17,2010-12-27 21:11:00,127,"GarryB,As just mentioned, grouse are everywhere, you can easily get your limit each day simply going do a lightly traveled gravel road for the last hr. of the day. They just stand on the road and wait for you."
1258003,JDP,2010-12-27 21:19:00,1457,"Colin/Others,Are these the birds that you hear ""drumming: off in the distanse while fishing?They sound like an old tractor running!"
1258019,Skywagon,2010-12-28 04:58:00,1106,"Gary,There are three different species of grouse in the area, inlcuding the Ruffed. I have a Golden that will point them, but have only hunted with him as a novelty, as dogs are not really needed. The Ruffed and Spuce grouse do not show much fear of man and are usually sitting targets as one drives or walks down the logging trails (nothing like quail). A 410 or even a 22, is plenty of gun. I grew up pheasant and quail hunting, grouse hunting in this area is something different.JDP,Yes, these birds are the ones that make that drumming sound, that you equate to a two popper. Steve"
1258029,plumberjoe,2010-12-28 06:19:00,54,I have been deer hunting just south of Lac Suel area the last three years and could have shot a limit almost every day. Not much need for a dog or guide. It would be fun though.
1258246,@Lunker,2010-12-29 09:21:00,835,Sorry to see none of you advocate having a dog simply for finding the birds. I hate losing a bird that way.
1258295,sault eyes,2010-12-29 13:03:00,268,The canadian way is to drive the roads with a 12 g full choke and shoot them. I can't even remeber loosing a bird. Its a lot easier. Plus were we moose hunt the brush is pretty thick for bird dogs. It is pretty hard to walk though let alone hunt with dogs.
1258296,@Lunker,2010-12-29 13:08:00,835,"Just curious.....do you ride around with a loaded gun sticking out the window or are they unloaded and cased while in the vehicle, as is required here in Wisconsin?"
1258310,sault eyes,2010-12-29 14:31:00,268,It is illegal to ride around with a loaded gun. These birds are dumb. Just put a few shells in your pocket and leave the gun in a soft case with the back unzipped. When you see a bird on the road leave the vehicle running or pull over and park. Take the gun out and shoot the bird. I use a hinge single action with #4 shot and a 2 3/4 shell. They usually watch you walk up to them and they generally don't fly away. If it does they won't go far. They may fly back a tree or 2. Its that simple.Good Luck
