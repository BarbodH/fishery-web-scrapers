1257552,Bigstorm,2010-12-24 07:24:00,799,"I have gone in late July a few times and the 3rd week in June a few times. I cant say that either time was was way better than the other. Water level seems to matter more where I go. Although we did notice that there was a mayfly hatch our 2nd day in on the trip this year (3rd week in June) and some of our fishing spots that are in slack water did not produce. We ended up finding the wallies in faster moving water.next year we are going 2 times, first will be the 3rd week in June and then we are going the first week in September, I'm curious to see if there will be any difference"
1257563,Pooch,2010-12-24 07:48:00,4619,"We normally fish the same Canadian lake two or three times a year. Starting the very end of June over the fourth of July then return the end of July first part of August. Have made one early September trip. Other than fish location we don't really see a big difference in quantity or quality of fish. Bait selection doesn't change all that much either. Minnows are the most consistent each time, but leeches or crawlers on some days are the preferred baits.Bugs seem to bother us less as the summer wears on most years. Very few bugs on the September trips, but weather can be fickle early and late season.Scan this subject back over this forums older post as there is a fair number of old posts with good information in them going back many years. Good luck.Pooch"

Weather is much more unpredictable and you gamble more with fish location as well. If it is a late ice out, the fish may be slow and in weird places. If it is an early ice out, things will be accelerated. I like July (around the 2nd week) for this reason. The fish are guaranteed to be where they should be. Walleyes will be in their regular holding patterns and still schooled up and not spread out. Pike will be in the weeds and the weeds will be up. Lakers will be generally deep (of course not as deep as august, but still deep. This is why I like July, the consistency of locations and seasonal changes have evened out by then."
1258244,@Lunker,2010-12-29 09:19:00,835,"Good comments above, especially about the weather early in the season.Another consideration is what species you want to fish for. Up on LOTW, walleyes are pretty consistent all season long. Smallies are catchable in consistent numbers all season long, albeit with a change in tactics. You want northerns? Best travel before July 1, when the water warms up. Then they disperse from the skinnier water and go deep. You want the big girls - muskies - on a more consistent basis (as well as the later season opener)? Come up when the water temps get to 70 degrees and for the remainder of the season."
1258249,scotttheguide,2010-12-29 09:44:00,73,"Best time of year? When ever you can get there. I get asked that alot and I always tell people the same thing, plan your trip when ever it most convenient for you. There are just to many variables when it comes to trying to plan your trip at peak times and the open water season in NW Ontario is to short of a window to try and hit the perfect week. It has been most evident over the past few seasons with the weather patterns being pretty wacky but the fishing has been great. Good fish have been caught all season long, you may have to change your presentations a little but Lakes in NW Ontario will always produce some great fishing action. Just don't carbon copy the year before by trying the same spots and same tactics. Some times soft plastics and crank baits will outfish the old jig and a minnow.I am very partial to LOTW because of it's size and amount of structure. It is a natural fish factory and the fish are there for the taking all season long. Time of year? Not that big of a deal."

We have fished late June, the walleyes have moved out into the deeper sections of the lake. Different areas, lakes and species all have different time tables. When can you go, what fish are you after, and how far do you want to travel, along with drive, boat or fly in fishing will be part of your decision making process. This is a good place to look for information about all of the above. Good luck in finding your time and place to battle the mighty walleye!"
