It looks stiff, fake and clearly a replica.QUOTE] I've yet to see a mount (real or replica) that doesn't look ""stiff"".....or to various degrees ""fake"". Haven't had the experience of fooling someone to thinking there is a real, live fish on my wall yet! In my opinion (doesn't count for much) a great photo is the best.....and the woman has a great one! I wouldn't put someone down for keeping it (I thought a 30 incher was a giant!) but she gets extra bonus points for letting it go. Plus it really frustrates some folk, which makes for fun conversations! The nice thing it is still in the lake for someone else to dream about catching.......and that is what fishing is all about, the excitement and anticipation.... Catches like hers just cranks it up a notch! Congratulations!"
1258715,gary2242,2010-12-31 11:57:00,49,Hi EverybodyTed from Hawk Lake Lodge in Ontario just supplied me with pictures and complete information about the World Record Catch & Release Walleye that was caught at his lodge by Bridget Mohker. I have the certificate from the Freshwater Hall of Fame posted. I am waiting for the IGFA certification. It's a monster !!!!I can't figure out how to add photos to this board so I have to put the link.http://www.walleyeheaven.com/worldre...asewalleye.htmHappy New Year!!! Gary
1258723,Guest,2010-12-31 13:13:00,0,Wow Is that a replica mount shes holding in the indoors picture I believe in catch and release as much as the next guy!!!! But at 37 inches it would be tough not to tap that pig between the Eyes For an official weigh scale. Boone and Crockett does it all the time
1258724,Glenman12,2010-12-31 13:20:00,762,Oh my Lord..what I wouldnt give...
1258725,Guest,2010-12-31 13:28:00,0,"Wow, I'm impressed that an angler would not kill a beautiful Walleye that was 37"" in length. That fish deserves to be swimming free."
1258759,gary2242,2010-12-31 15:26:00,49,The IGFA requires that you kill the fish and bring it in for DNA testing unless there is an overwhelming amount of witnesses. All they need is a thin sliver clipped off the gill plate to do DNA testing. That is the word we need to put out to all fisherpersons in case they do get a monster walleye that they feel might be a record.gary
1258769,Lazy Fisherman,2010-12-31 16:11:00,276,Wow! What a walleye.
1258821,Hawgeye,2011-01-01 01:48:00,1355,"That fish would have been on my wall. Although I practice catch and release, I just don't think the replicas look very good. The one she has looks nothing like the fish that was in the picture. It looks stiff, fake and clearly a replica. Just my opinion, I really get sick of people either scolding others of keeping that once-in-a-lifetime fish, or touting about how great replicas look. I respect anyone that releases a fish but I'd have a hard time slipping that one back!! I have released three fish that are larger than the 11lber + that I kept for a mount. All were tough to let go but I felt good about it. I do have a size that if I exceed it, I will keep it...over 13!"
1258859,dewyg,2011-01-01 09:35:00,1006,"Nice fish! I might have to get on that lake, I only live 30 minutes from hawk and have never fished it!!!! Spend all my time on LOTW!!!!!"
1259963,Guest,2011-01-06 09:09:00,0,Why would you kill it? She definitely did the right thing. She has a great picture as well as a Catch and Release World Record. Something that I personally believe is much more honorable than just a world record.
1259970,Flip Silverlake,2011-01-06 09:42:00,645,I agree! She did a great job of playing that fish so it could be released alive! I do not keep anything over 20 inches in fact I prefer the 16 to 17 for eating.
