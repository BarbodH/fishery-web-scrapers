1259180,rapple97,2011-01-02 22:52:00,2,I'm considering using Northwest Flying for an early summer fly-in trip this year; does anyone have any experience with this outfitter? Appreciate insights!

I can strongly recommend Nestor Falls Fly-in for excellent service, great facilities and an excellent safety record. Here is their website: http://www.nestorfalls.com/ If you have any questions, just send me an email or private message."
