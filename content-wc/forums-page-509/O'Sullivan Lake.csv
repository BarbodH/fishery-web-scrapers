1153731,Guest,2009-12-12 07:12:00,0,"Hi Celtic, Good choice on the Abamasagi camp. I plan to book the same camp next June. Are you going to fly in or portage? I've done both and would rather portage. You will save $$ and actually know that you will be going in on a certian day and getting out on a certian day. You can also say bye bye to the weight restrictions and overweight charges. I've fished this lake several times over the years and really like it. If you have any questions before going just fire me an email. Tell Howard and Elsie I said hi if you talk to them. Hey Twister, I have not heard of anyone going upstream from O'Sullivan to Abamasagi. I have heard of guys going downstream from the Ogoki road bridge (Kawashkagama River) into the lake. Never done it myself. I would think water levels play a big part in getting in there via the river. I really think that renting the camp from Howard is well worth the money. I am not sure that leaving your vehicle along any of those roads for more than a day or so ..... Capt Bob Feyes[email protected]"

We went in 07 and are returning this June.They now have SAT phones and always do a mid-week flyin.These 3 cabins all have icehouses for the season,a must.Anyways,as you can tell we like Bill&Michele and will continue to use them."
1259085,Guest,2011-01-02 14:11:00,0,Hay I been there many times i have stayed on the out post andthey were ok but when i go it not for comfort but for fishing Howard will show you the besr palce to stay if you go pack for the out doors and be ready for some fishing
1259087,Guest,2011-01-02 14:19:00,0,I have been there if you have not done it will be hard also there is many creeks that you can go up so you better have a gps and be back to camp before it gets dark or you will stay the night on the river
1146642,celticbass1,2009-11-05 17:09:00,67,"This is going to be a stretch but I'll ask anyway. I'm looking for anyone who might know of a cottage or outfitter on O'Sullivan Lake in Nakina, Ontario other than O'Sullivan Rainbow Lodge or O'Sullivan Outfitters. Rainbow lodge is full the week we want to go and we don't know much about the other outfitter but we would prefer to stay in a cabin not surrounded by other cabins. We are looking for the week of July 10, 2010.Thanks"
1146657,Mich_Fisherman,2009-11-05 18:31:00,292,"Celtic, Our group went to O'Sullivan for 7 years and switched this year for something different. We stayed at O'Sullivan Outfitter's all of those years. We chose them (Howard and Elsie) because they were on the river and could fish the river on those windy days when the lake was too rough to fish. Their cabins are all in one central area about a 10 minute boat ride down the river to get to the lake. That was the upside, the down side is if you wanted to fish at night, it made it tough, but not impossible. The cabins are not bad, all have indoor plumbing and heat. They do not have an outpost on O'Sullivan but do on other lakes. They do offer one day trips (no charge) to another drive in lake (Hanover) that has pretty good pike fishing. The fishing in O'Sullivan has never let us down and we have always managed walleye in the 27""-31"" range with a lot of fish 21""-24"". PM me if you want more info or would like to call."
1147233,Guest,2009-11-09 15:09:00,0,"You said that you used to go to O'sullivan out of Nakina, but not now why? Did you stop going north? Did you quit fishing or where do you now go? Just interested to know."
1147299,Mich_Fisherman,2009-11-09 20:08:00,292,"This year we went to Lake Nagagami (Hornepayne) and Expeditions North. We hooked up with them at the Ultimate fishing show in Novi, MI. The proprietor (David Zuhl) promised us the moon and and delivered the moon and more with fishing quality, accomodations and equipment. Hard to find a place that offers all 3 of those with a very reasonable price for a fly in, $849 for a week for housekeeping cabins including the flight. Fishing was the best I've encountered of all the places I've tried in Ontario including Nakina, Spanish, Chapleau and Wawa."
1150455,nitrox,2009-11-26 17:41:00,21,"Hi Celtic,I was on O'Sullivan in September and the group a go with are hard core campers. We camped on an Island out in the main lake. We did stop by and check out the Camp on the River and it seemed ok. The rates were reasonable and just up river from the camp is the launch just down stream from the rapids. Great walleye fishing in the rapids I might add. For the first time going to O'Sullivan the fishing was pretty good, but not as good as the lake just up the river from O'Sullivan, Abamasagi. Abamasagi is a fly in lake that we camp on after going down a serious of 3 rapids on the inlet river."
1150735,Guest,2009-11-29 06:57:00,0,"Hey Celtic, I would give O'sullivan Lake Outfitters a try. They have one cabin that is somewhat secluded near the river. You might also want to inquire about their Abamasagi Lake camp. Tell them that you do not wish to fly into that lake and they might set you up with a portage. This is no big deal as they use atv's to get you back there. O'sullivan / Superb is a large body of water that can get nasty unless you have a boat that can handle it. The camp on Abamasagi is at (what looks like) the end of a long narrow arm. You can catch all of the fish you want in that arm if it is rough on the main lake. Fishing on O'sullivan is very good for lake trout and good for walleye and northerns. Abamasagi is fantastic for walleye, northerns and has some lake trout too. 100 fish days are common on Abamasagi as are northerns >40"". Capt. Bob Feyes[email protected]"
1150783,Bill Krejca,2009-11-29 12:24:00,6107,"I've had some pretty good days on O'S, just about a mile out from Rainbow between the islands, no need to go to the other end of the lake on super windy days (or even if it is not windy). I do have to say, however, that I've not seen it so rough that it got real unpleasant, doesn't compare with some stretches of LOW where you can't see to the other end - or see your buddy in the boat next. Bill Krejca"
1152954,MrTwister1,2009-12-08 16:35:00,3,How long does it take to go upriver from O'Sullivan to Abamasagi and how difficult are the three sets of rapids?
1153023,celticbass1,2009-12-08 21:07:00,67,Thanks for all of the information guys. We have booked with O'Sullivan Outfitters and we are staying at Absagami Lake. Sounds like the fishing there is exactly what we like so we will have another great year. To top that off my brother is paying for me to go to Wollaston Lake Lodge about two weeks before this trip. Gonna be a good summer!!!
1153055,Larry Mac,2009-12-09 06:39:00,530,"Hello Celticbass1, It sounds like you got one heck of a plan. You have a great time and please keep us posted.Thank you,Larry Mac"
