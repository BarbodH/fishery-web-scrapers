1257991,GarryB,2010-12-27 19:56:00,365,"Thanks for the great suggestion RBF.My wife would prefer a quality resort/lodge that offers the American plan and shore lunches.We would bring our own boat (Ranger 621VS) and we prefer to keep it on a protected dock with electricity for charging the batteries. Yes, I would need a quality guide for the first couple of days of each trip. Most of our fishing would be for walleyes and maybe a few northers and smallies.Type of lodging - ultra modern cabins.Location on the lake - I have never fished Lac Suel or any other lake in Canada. I am open to suggestions on which side to stay at and maybe it makes sense to stay in different locations depending on the month.At this time we are considering two weeks in June and two or three weeks in August. My hunting partner and I would also like to do a three to four week trip in September/October to hunt ruff grouse and fish walleyes.What are the two best weeks in June? What are the two best weeks in August? What are the 4 best weeks in September/October for hunting ruff grouse and catching walleyes?Any suggestions and recomenndations are greatly appreciated as we are rookies when it comes to fishing in Canada.Thanks again,Garry"

1257451,joeman79,2010-12-23 12:43:00,417,Lost Island Lodge has a nice place
1257473,Hump,2010-12-23 14:03:00,578,If you are on the west end of the lake.
1257522,SeulAreaWalleye,2010-12-23 19:40:00,100,"Pm me, if you are interested in other great options on the East Side of Lac Seul.All of Seul is excellent walleye fishing, but East is where the monster muskies roam as well.Happy Holidays to all on Walleye Central!"
1257573,walleyeguy13,2010-12-24 08:18:00,264,"Gold Pines Lodge was a very pleasant surprise. The are out of Ear Falls. I don't think they had much for guide service... but it is Lac Seul. Very, very friendly people."
1257591,cspierings,2010-12-24 10:05:00,230,I would say it depends on the time of year you are planning on being up there. To me it seems like late in the season July and August most of the fishing is around MacKenze bay and that can be a long hall in a camp boat from the west end of the lake. Early in the season I have had great luck on the west end. Lots of places to stay on that end of the lake up toward Ear Falls and I am sure some of those folks will chime in. I really can't comment much on where to stay on the east side.
1257637,Guest,2010-12-24 15:26:00,0,"I would second Silver Water Wheel. Went there 11 years ago, first time to Lac Suel. Never tried another resort after that first time, so 11 years in a row for me there. Great cabins, awesome guides, superb food, the best boats on the water. Plus your in the central part of the lake, so very little traffic from other resorts (some but very little). No muskies, but walleye, northern and bass, with lots of them and great size. June 15 cannot come soon enough. IA Walleye"
1257871,tv4fish,2010-12-27 07:29:00,2694,"Garry: I assume you already know this, but Anderson's is not located right on Lac Seul. They do have a very nice camp. I have to put in a ""Plug"" for the Red Pine Lodge (which is actually located closer to Lac Seul and closer to the town of Sioux Lookout). Depends on what type plan you're looking for? We have been going to Red Pine for over 25 years. We do the Housekeeping plan and launch up at Deception Bay when we fish Lac Seul."
1257979,rather-be-fishin,2010-12-27 19:10:00,429,"Gary, When you say ""Top Lodges"" what are you looking for? American plan or housekeeping? Type of Lodging? Camp boat or your own boat? Guides? Location on the Lake? What type of fish are you wanting to catch? Cost range? That would be helpful and then many people will give suggestions. Lac Seul is a huge body of water with lots to offer and many lodges to choose from. RBF"
