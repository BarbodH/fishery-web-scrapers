1256406,Ogoki,2010-12-19 08:31:00,291,"I have not flown with Hawk Air since the late 80's,so my info is rather old. I can say that we fished Little Missinaibi with them once . I fished Little Miss thru Ontario Wilderness Vacation (Airdale) 5 other times . My cousin went to Little Miss every year at least ocne from 1986 until he passed away 2 years ago. Some years he fished there twice. He went with me numerous times to Armstrong but as he was getting older the trip to Wawa was much easier on him and his aging group. He said the fishing was better at Armstrong at the larger lake but they did get to know Little Miss well and did good there. They got into numerous 17 to 18 inch walleye and the occasional 20 lb pike . For us Wawa was 13 hour trip verses 20 to 21 hours . I do know Little Miss is a very popular lake with both Hawk Air and Airdale and it can be hard to book . Hope this helps . Good Luck !"

Caught a couple dozen pike over 40"".Fished with Air Dale in 2009 on Mank/Dickie.....small walleye and medium size pike around 36"". Caught a monster walleye in Dickie (not even supposed to be any walleye in lake). Didn't weigh but it was over 36""lg....released to fight another day. Caught over a hundred pike in the 8-10 lb range on banjo minnows....."

I have been to Namigos, Wejin, Easey, Duffy and last year to Mosambik. Hawks' camps are first class. They are clean, well equipped and this really makes the trip more enjoyable. Alot of the most popular lakes now have hot and cold running water with showers and the cabins are wired with generators.We normally go towards the last couple weeks of July, just because some in our group farm and can't get away until after wheat harvest. This is probably not the most ideal for the fishing, but we've never had any trouble catching fish. Duffy and Easey are terrific walleye lakes. Duffy was better for us for bigger eyes, Easey better for numbers still plenty of fish from 18-27 inches. Occasional northerns in both lakes but tough to target, at least when we go.Wejin was a small lake and so were the fish, although we caught plenty, but that was 20 years ago. Mosambik was interesting. An extremely productive lake considering it is so shallow. We caught plenty of 1-3 pound walleyes and some nice pike up to 40 inches, but you were constantly reeling in perch. We probably caught 2 perch for every eye or pike. That got to be really annoying. And although the boats, motors and everything were top notch, Mosambik would not be my first choice.This year we are going to Upper Duffy for the first time. We've heard good things about the lake. It is a little smaller lake than Duffy with similar fishing. Little Missinabi looks very interesting and I hope to make a trip there in the coming years.Kelly and Mary and Matti and Courtney are great people to work with. The prices are very reasonable. Finally, it is a pretty easy trip for anybody from Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, PA or Michigan."
1257617,phishfearme,2010-12-24 13:30:00,1242,rpdragon - what was the size of the perch? if the perch are jumbos that wouldn't be all that bad phish
1257642,rpdragon,2010-12-24 16:32:00,3,"Phish, some jumbos were caught. I remember fileting a couple 12"" ers that one boat brought in one day. They're rough on a filet knife up there. they're scales are like armor plates. I also recall thinking one day that if it was October on Erie I'd be tickled. Vast majority were 7 to 9. Some bigger, but still annoying when you know your on eyes but the perch are taking your bait before you can get your presentation to depth."
1257680,Guest,2010-12-25 08:09:00,0,"Fished there long ago, great people. Back then Little Miss and Goat were great (do they still fish Goat?) Mosambik was very high numbers, no size and Easey was terrible! If they operate at all like they use to I would go back in a heart beat.... good cabins, equipment and really nice people. But, that was a long time ago :-)"
