Looking for a new place to hunt for big pike in the fall, want a drive-to so we can take our own boat and want to stay within a 2-day drive of the St. Louis area so Manitoba is probably as far west as we can go. Thanks and happy new year to all."
1259039,Hawgeye,2011-01-02 09:21:00,1355,Try Jackson's Lodge. They have a resort on the lake. www.jacksonslodge.com @ 204-367-4384
1259232,Beagle_Nut,2011-01-03 09:08:00,52,"Thanks, but seeing info on Jacksons is how I heard about the area in the first place. We plan to talk to them at the St. Louis All Canada Show next weekend, what I was hoping for was info from someone other than the lodge owners. The 2004 thread indicated the road might be a problem, and I'd also appreciate any fishing notes from someone who's familiar with the area specifically the pike fishing."
1259414,Hawgeye,2011-01-03 20:40:00,1355,"I was there in 2008 and caught 50 walleyes per day. I caught a MA Smallie that went 23.75"". Had a blast. The drive in is a tricky one...not sure if the road has been spruced up any since I was there but it was not very nice. There is a provincial campsite next door to Jackson's and I have considered staying there for a few days. Just not to sure I am excited about the bears in the area...I know they have had a few visting their lodge from time to time...they do a good job of keeping their eyes open though. I'd love to go back with my family but to bring my wife and 3 boys, it is way to expensive. For me alone it was fine at $80 a night but for 5 times 80 times three nights, too much money. Too bad they don't have a family pack or something for like 150 a night. We never caught any pike on the lake. I am sure they are there but we had so much fun with walleyes and smallies we never had time to think about the pike. Good luck and if you find out anything about the road, let us know please. Thanks Hawgeye"
1259444,fishncamp,2011-01-03 23:11:00,49,I have fished there many times from the late 80's to about 2003. The road in was crappy but doable if you take your time. The worst part is encountering a larger oncoming vehicle. Walleyes and bass fishing can be spectacular and there are some big pike and whitefish there too. Casting some bigger crankbaits off the reefs and at the falls will likely get you some good pike action this fall. I hope to go back for a weekend this summer.
