1256987,Golden Eagle,2010-12-21 11:51:00,2642,"I've fished Cobham River Outpost several times. Haven't fished Cobham Lake. Walleye fishing was excellent. Pike fishing good, but not as good as walleye fishing. Price has gone up due to flying costs. It's a pretty big ride to get there. I found plenty of deeper water. August 2005 I was up river when the motor quit on me. Anchored in the middle of the river to stay away from skeeters until dark so we could shine the light for help. We had 11 hours of excellent walleye fishing as fish moved around us. The motor was new and from a good manufacturer, but they were trying to get great performance from a 2 cycle OB and they failed."

Ed Showwalter has an outpost cabin by a place called Quick Quick, which is were you see the very first current of the river.The Cobham is stuffed with Walleyes. We use to travel an hour or more by boat down the cobham to places we called Lunch Lake and Little George. The thing about the Cobham is you will find the really huge pike in the cabbage. That's were we caught all the biggest pike. Fishing normal weed lines, curent and points only produced walleye. Traditional pike lures did not work well either. We would cast DareDevles, Muskie plugs, and Spinner Baits and would not get many hits but the Johnson Silver Minnow worked wonders on the river for big pike. I am thinking the JSM must mimic the minnows that are in the river. gary"
1257025,Golden Eagle,2010-12-21 15:34:00,2642,"We picked up nice pike in the narrows of the river where the water was moving. Gary, did you fish Monument Falls? We always stayed at the log cabin about 3 or 4 miles downstream from the falls. I have lots of great memories from fishing Cobham River. There are super lakes just a short portage off the river. Easy to get lost though. Best to take a handheld gps."

1257163,Golden Eagle,2010-12-22 09:34:00,2642,"I fished Cobham River Outpost the last week of August 2004. At the end of the week Peter Cay picked us up for a flight back to Red Lake. I asked him about dropping me off at Sportsman's Lodge on Little Vermilion Lake and he replied that the camp was shut down for the week. He agreed to drop me off to be the only person in camp and the only person on the lake for a week. I had Pete to let Brett know to have me picked up in about a week or so and asked one of my friends to let my wife know I'd be returning home a week or so later than planned. 8 days later I was a mile or so from camp when a Beaver came out of the sunset and buzzed me, letting me know to bring in a couple of extra walleyes for a visitor. All my leftover beer was in the frig when I got back to the cabin. It was for my guest, not for me.The first Wednesday in October I was sitting in my office, feeling sorry for myself, when I hit the speed dial to see if there might be an empty seat on a plane going to LV. There was and I was out of my driveway at 4 a.m. the next morning for a 1470 mile drive to Red Lake and another week of life in paradise. I came out when moose hunters arrived. My life has been better when I make October trips up yonder."
1257173,Mike Kansas,2010-12-22 10:12:00,1463,We went to the Outpost once and had a great trip. Lots of Walleye but nothing big and we didi catch some nice Pike by accident. Also a couple of our group went to the small lake that is attached and caught some Blue Walleye. Overall Four Star Trip Mike Kansas
