1256289,Guest,2010-12-18 14:49:00,0,would like any comments out there on Kayedon lakje out of Nakina Ont. Leuuenberger is the outfitter. Went with these folks back in the 70's and had pretty good success at Kayedon. But that was along time ago. The thing that sticks out most in my mind is the indians from Ogoki came down and stole our beer. . Any way if someone can give us an upfdate on this lake we would appreciate it. We are going the week of July 9 thru the 16. Thank you

1256651,Curryale,2010-12-20 08:46:00,50,"We were to Kayedon and Ogoki twice in the 80's once in the late 90's and once in 2002.The fishing was slower on the two latter trips then the ones in the 80s.The majority of our time in the 80s was spent in the narrows between Kayedon and Ogoki as well as the Speckled Trout Rapids downriver from Kayedon. The fishing was easy.When we were there last it was tough to get too many fish in those areas presumably because they are obvious and get pressured by most groups that come through there.We fished Ogoki lake most of the the last two trips and did do well for both Walleye and Pike. The fish are still good size and average 18 to 20 inches. Pretty typical patterns in Ogoki for Walleye - Jigs, Rapalas and Bottom Bouncers.I should note we have only been there in August."

I think the natives we had trouble with are all grown up now, LOL. shouldn't be a problem. That was back in the mid 70's. Good fishing all and Merry Christmas Ted Jias and sons"
1256799,gary2242,2010-12-20 17:36:00,49,"HiI am sorry to say that Kaydon is nothing like it used to be. In the early 90s there was only one cabin on the lake and that was owned by Twin Lakes Outfitters. The fishing was beyond amazing. The MNR gave other outfitters permits to build cabins and now the lake is way over-fished. I think Stu Loten sold that cabin just before Bill and Michelle bought Twin Lakes. The same thing happened to Hebner Lake.Judging what lakes are best north of Nakina depends on what you are looking for. Ara Lake is non-stop Walleye action. It's a 100 Walleyes a day lake and there are some massive pike in there to. AMS Outposts www.walleyesnorth.ca and Seven Lakes Wilderness Camps www.fishing.sevenlakes-wilderness-camps.com are two outfitters that have cabins on that lake. Another non-stop Walleye lake is Abamassagi Lake. Twin Lakes Outfitters www.twin-lakes-air.com have a couple of cabins on that lake. With Abamassagi, you catch walleyes everywhere all day. It's a 100 walleye per day lake. If you want a trophy, you have to troll with small blue jointed floating Rapalas and Thundersticks about 2 feet off the wild rice that's coming out of the sandy shore up in the narrows. You have to troll from dusk until about 2 hours after dark. I was up there in 2007 and every night we caught 4 or 5 walleyes in the 25 to 30-inch range. During the day we caught tons of Walleyes in the 1 to 4 pound range. If you are looking for Monster Pike in the 20 to 30 pound range, Esser Lake and Trapper's Run is where you want to go. They are both lakes along the Ogoki River and they are rarly fished. Twin Lakes Outfitters has a cabin on each of them. Trapper's Run also has amazing Brook Trout fishing all summer long. They are found up river at Moose Jaw Falls and down stream at a place called the Big Curve, which is where cold springs run into the river. Dusey Lake is also good for Walleye and Brook Trout in the spring and Walleye and big pike in the summer. The secret to big pike in Dusey is to find the drop-off ridge that's about 500 or 600 yards from where the river runs into the lake. The monster pike site on the ridge and ambush the walleyes passing by. You may have heard of a man named Dr. Gene Smith from Kentucky. He found that ridge and told me about it. They did not catch any big pike anywhere else in the lake but when they found this ridge, they were pulling in a few pike over 20 pounds every day.I hope this helpsGary"

1257001,gary2242,2010-12-21 13:26:00,49,"HiThat's great if the fishing is bouncing back at Kaydon. With the economy being really bad the last couple of years, the outfitters have been slow and a lot of the lakes have had very little fishing pressure and from what Gavorlake said it looks like the fish population has bounced back. It's easier for a lake along the Ogoki River system to bounce back because the walleyes, pike and trout are migrating up and down the river all year.2011 might be the very best year for a fly-in north of Nakina or Red Lake because the lakes have had a huge rest over the last couple of years. Way North Lodge north of Red Lake is a place you should check out as well www.waynorthlodge.com They have awesome fishing.The economy in the US must be getting better because my lodge customers are all reporting that bookings are coming in way better then the last few years at this time. Traditionally people book in the winter but the last few years all the bookings have been last minute. I manage the web sites for many lodges across Ontario so I hear everything.Gary"
1257152,oleJoe,2010-12-22 09:00:00,114,Kaydon Lake has only 2 cabins on it. One is Leuuenbergers and the other is Artic Watershed Outfitters. All the other cabins is on Ogaki lake and most of those are on the other end of it which is a big lake. We have fished Kaydon twice with good fishing and excellant facilaties. It is not fished out by anymeans.
