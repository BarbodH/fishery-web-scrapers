The border crossing on the way up was terrible only four days after the attack. We spent 45 mins. in a short line which would have taken about 5 mins. in the past. On the way back we went through at Pigeon River instead of International Falls. There was no line when we got to the crossing and were through in a few mins. The eye action at Press can be fantastic or frustrating like fishing is all of the time. Sometimes you need to work for the fish and sometimes they jump into the boat. Last week we had to work. I like to troll and the trolling action was great for snakes. They were suspended and very active. The eyes were holding deep and jiging with minnows in 20 to 45 feet of water was the way to go. We did pick up some eaters trolling but nothing big. My better half, the bluegill queen, put me to shame just like kids and wives always do. My fishing usual fishing partner took his wife up in July. They had great fishing and his better half picked up a seven pound eye and a couple of huge snakes."
514941,ggg,2001-09-26 19:58:00,115,I also have just returned. I have fished many places in Canada and Press Lake equals the best I've ever seen ! My partner and I caught 40 to 50 walleyes everyday and then went Northern fishing. Biggest walleye of the week was 8 lbs. but followed by a 7.5 and a 7. A couple of days it was hard to catch them small enough to eat. Big Dave was right on with them being deep. Surface temp. was 62 - 64F.At that depth it takes good electronics to find em and a good trolling motor to position a slow presentation. It was very windya couple of days last week. Cabins were neat and clean and generally a nice place to stay. I will return !
514942,BD,2001-09-27 12:45:00,739,ggg; I'm happy to have met you and thanks for the tips. I don't know if I will be back to Press next year. The better half want's to go to a lake that has big perch along with walleye fishing. Maybe the Dakotas or Minnesota. I will be going to LOW in June with the boys.
