515126,Shawn,2001-09-29 21:22:00,33,"There was a small clip on the 6 o'clock news, no mention of who was in the lead, more of a community piece and what tournaments are doing to help the communities and such. There was some good shots of Hogs being netted, looked like a quite a few but it could have been carefull editing as well. I also think it was during pre-fish as the guys didn't seem to have their game faces on.It was nice to see those pigs anyway.....I mean the walleyes of course:-)Shawnwww.fishingxcanada.com"

515128,BillyBigFish,2001-10-01 08:10:00,31,"I just got back from Tobin Sat. I was there from Mon to Fri Morn. The fishing was slow as far as big ones. The fishing was heating up come Thursday and Friday, we netted a 28"", 27"" and a 24"" with lots of fish in the 20"" to 23"" range during those 2 days. Our biggest catch was Mon Morning when Mike caught a 30.5"" weighing in at 11.9 lbs. Overall we caught 6 fish over 24"" with the 30.5"" being the biggest.The weather was the best part, 70 to 80 degrees all week.I will never again plan a trip so close to the Vanity. On Friday morning there were so many boats on top of each other it made for a night mare for the guy controlling the boat. I think there also was a lot of new comers. We would all have a nice drift going and the some bozo would get right on top of you making any kind of hook set almost impossible if you were using Lindy Rigs. We had to switch to Bottom Bouncers so we did not have to let out line.It looked to me as if the fishing was going to be good for the tourney!"
