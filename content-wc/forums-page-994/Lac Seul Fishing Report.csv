515109,DarrenB,2001-09-27 12:18:00,28,"If you don't mind me asking, which areas of the lake did you fish? Any large muskies or walleyes taken at all? Have the smallies picked up yet? How were the weather conditions?Sorry for sounding like a pain here, but the reason I ask is because I usually fish Eagle in the springtime(early June) and am curious to the fall approach and techniques used on the lake in fall. I only fished Eagle once in the fall(10 years ago) on the Vermillion Bay side.Thanks"

By Detour Point, around Boat Island and did the best up in a separate little lake that was connected by a stream(the name escapes me). Just abou the only fish we caught on Eagle was trolling Shad Raps right before sundown. You could see the cisco's jumping and the big walleyes were coming up after them. We had a couple of eight pounders and probably another 20 that were between there and 3 pounds. There were 9 in our party so although we had action it wasn't fast and furious. They claimed the lake was turning over but we had the water temp at about 57 degrees so I'm not sure if that was true or not."

Had more big pike grabbing eye's that were on the retreive than ever before. It's a blast to be sure.While our big fish was a 25"", we caught many over 20. And Lac Seul's eyes are as broad in the shoulder as any I've seen. Makes it nice. Particularly when you bring in those 17""ers for dinner. Heard folks in the camp talk about high 20's and a 30 were released as well.Call Gary or Pat at Evergreen. You'll find 'em on the web.ZCamp & the Merc1"
