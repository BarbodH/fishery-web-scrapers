515040,lenray,2001-09-20 12:27:00,467,I travel to Ontario from Michigan and use a canoe to travel rivers to smaller lakes to fish and explore. I was wondering if someone would share some info. concerning the area north of Pickle Lake on the gravel road where I could put in a canoe or small boat and get to a few lakes for pike fishing. We catch and release except for a few shore lunches.Thankyou len
515041,Dave,2001-09-21 05:55:00,258,"I have been to the Pipestone River which is about 70 miles north of Pickle Lake.You can put in either above the falls or below. We usually put in above and boat to Horseshoe Lake. Along the way to the Pipestone there are several lakes that have acess along with some smaller rivers. If you stop at the Pickle Lake Township office you can get detailed maps which will show you the smaller lakes and rivers. Just a word of warning, the bears are thick up there. I think there are several outfitters up there who fly canoeist in to remote spots and they kind of give you a game plan as far as where to go.Good Luck."
515042,lenray,2001-09-21 11:35:00,467,Thanks Dave for the info.If you have the time I have a few more questions. I see Horseshoe Lake off to the west on the map and some more lakes west on that river system. Do a lot of folks fish these lakes- the lakes that I am fishing are north of Terrace Bay on Superior they are quite difficult to get to and we have never seen any other fisherman on those lakes while we were there and have not seen new tire tracks between trips that would show any activityWhat size boat have you been using on these lakes?Is there a place to park your vehicle and do you camp on the lakes in the bush???Is there a lot of people up in that region fishing the varied lakes?Thanks for your helplen
515043,Dave,2001-09-21 13:25:00,258,You won't see anybody unless you are there during moose season. I was up there last Sept. right after Labor Day. Like I said before it is about 80 miles north of Pickle Lake and I think we saw maybe 2 big trucks the whole way. I think there is a mine up there somewhere.There is a place to park your vehicle and a boat ramp made out of chicken wire and railroad ties. You can camp right there or anywhere in the bush. We found an island to camp on in Horseshoe Lake. We did see 1 canoe in the week we were there. It is about as remote as it can get. I'm not sure if there are more people during the summer. I have a 16' deep-v with a 30hp and it took about a half hour to get to Horseshoe Lake from the ramp at the Pipestone River. The walleye fishing was fantastic but I can't help you out on the Pike because we never realy tried for them. Myself I would never go back with my boat because it took a beating driving on the gravel for that long.
515044,lenray,2001-09-22 10:22:00,467,Thanks Dave for the info.I like to fish smaller lakes maybe 3-4 miles long at the longest and a half mile to a quarter of a mile across. Can Horseshoe Lake be fished as a small lake with a lot of bays or is it just a big expanse of water it shows up on my map of Ontario so it must be a decent size body of water.Is it deep and is it the darker water that a lot of the lakes have. What is the country like up there. Where I fish there are boulders bigger than those big round roofed barns here in Michigan.My boat is just a 14 footer and a buddy has a 12 footer-if we ever go up there would we need a bigger boat--did you have any problems with waves.I see west of Horseshoe on the same river system there is 5 other lakes that show up on my big map-has anyone tried these.Also how big is this Pipestone river-fast moving water??I trust I don't tire you with these questions Dave. If I have overstayed my welcome I will understand.I just like to fish new lakes that are in a wilderness situation away from the crowds.It looks like from where I live in Clare Michigan it would be at least a 1000 miles oneway.I have a friend who lives in Manitouwadge who just retired from the Ministry of Nat Res. he has put me on to some nice water and we have snomobiled up there also.WE JUST REALLY LOVE THE QUIENTESS AND THE BEAUTY OF THE NORTH AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TREATED LIKE GOLD WHILE UP THERE. sorry capsThanks Dave for your help.len

515048,Dave,2001-09-26 14:50:00,258,"I'm from the Great State of Iowa. I was at Horseshoe Lake a year ago.Sorry I did not post this earlier,I just got back from Sioux Lookout.Lake Minnitaki, what a walleye fishery. I have never caught so manylarge walleye(5# plus) and all in 30' water. I enjoy going to PickleLake but I tire of the drive. The fall at Lake Minnitaki is great,not too many boats and about 4-5 hours closer than Pickle Lake."
