515095,Hawgeye,2001-09-28 10:09:00,1355,"My brother-in-law went with last year and salted and froze some sucker minnows I think they were using borax? He did the same with little mudpuppy's? My memory is good but short! I have never done this so maybe someone else can explain but he did just as well with them as we did with our smaller minnows. Our live larger minnows did seem to outperform them though. I always stop at Pro-Am in Winnipeg and get minnows there. Boris the owner always seems to have good big hearty minnows.I am from Fargo and will be going up tommorrow through Wednesday and then again on the 18th for four days. You should be hitting it at a great time. Sounds like it should start to peak around then. It seems the closer you can get to ice up, the better the fishing. Where are you coming from cnem? GOOD LUCK and I will give a report when we get back."
515096,Guest,2001-09-28 19:13:00,0,Believe Boris opens up at 9 AM if not Ernies on Marion opens at 9 other wise pro am has a number of close coffe shops for that last jolt of caffeine while you wait.WWhttp://www.walleyewarrior.com
515097,cnem,2001-09-30 20:09:00,50,"hawgeye,I'm straight South of ya in Canby, MN. There will be 6 of us going up on the 10th. I acquired about 4 dozen large creek chubs and shiners(3-6 inches) and have frozen them. A buddy has been salting some also. Thanks for your info."
515098,Guest,2001-10-01 08:07:00,0,Fished Pine Falls all day Saturday September 29th and unfortunately things are still quite slow out on the lake. Conversed with a number of the good Americans who are already up here and they too have been experiencing some hard times. Desparately in need of some cool Manitoba nights to get things rolling. It could be tough times at the Pine Falls tournement this weekend.
515099,Guest,2001-10-01 11:35:00,0,"This will be my 5th consecutive year for the run up north. The first year, we thought we would outsmart the fish and bring our own salted minnows and chubs. Two very slow days later, and after seeing numerous large fish caught all around us, we tossed our pride aside and switched to the salted Winnipeg shiners with nearly instant success.Could it be the fisherman? Or was it the bait? It's probably a toss-up! I'll stick to what I am confident with and use the Winnipeg shiners.We are leaving Saturday AM (the 6th) for 5 days! See you up there!"
515084,Guest,2001-09-25 12:13:00,0,I AND A FEW FRIENDS ARE HEADED UP TO PINE FALLS ON THURSDAY MORNING AND WE WERE WONDERING HOW THE FISHING IS THERE? WE WERE ALSO WONDERING WHOM TO TALK TO ABOUT OTHER INFORMATION WHEN WE GET THERE SUCH AS WHERE NETS ARE AND OTHER GENERAL INFORMATION. IS THERE ANYTHING TO DO AFTER HOURS IN PINE FALLS? LOOKING FORWARD TO A GOOD TIME. IF ANYONE WISHES TO E-MAIL ME INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE GREAT.[email protected]DINGO
515085,Hawgeye,2001-09-25 12:36:00,1355,"Where are you staying? I will be at the Motor Inn in Powerview on Saturday through Wednesday. Been going for 12 years. There is a bar attached to the motel that has slots and good Canadian Beer! If you are around when we are, look around outside for we will be one of the groups frying up some fish in the parking lot, telling fish stories and relaxing. Stop by and say hi and we can share our techniques for the day!"
515086,Guest,2001-09-25 13:18:00,0,"WE ARE STAYING AT THE MANATOU LODGE WHICH I GUESS IS ACROSS FROM THE PAPER MILL. WE WILL BE IN A F350 BLUE FORD PICKUP WITH BROWN DESIGNS ON THE SIDE AND A GREEN 17.5' SYLVAN. WE USUALLY GO TO TOBIN THIS TIME OF YEAR, BUT WANTED TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT. WE WILL HAVE TO SAY HI. DINGO"
515087,chrism,2001-09-25 15:36:00,429,"Hey Hawgeye-When do you arrive, and more importantly - Is the fryer going to be in business this Saturday eve? I'll be on the water Sat!Drive safe!Chris"
515088,Hawgeye,2001-09-25 19:51:00,1355,"ABSOLUTELY Chrism! Sounds like the weather may be a little warm so if we can find enough of the little ones for the fryer, the cooker will be cookin'! Look for a white Lund Pro-V, that will be us! Hey, might even have an adult beverage for ya :)Hawgeye"
515089,Snowman,2001-09-26 07:32:00,70,"Hey guys!I'll be leaving Fargo tomorrow morning at 3:00 A.M., hope to be fishing by 9:00. We will also be staying at the Manitou Lodge, I have a green/white YarCraft 1895 Storm SC. Maybe we'll see you up there!"
515090,Dan,2001-09-26 15:48:00,325,Hey guys.Water is still on the warm side (mid 60's) and the bite is slower than usual for this time of year.Things are starting to pick-up however with a few stories of big fish get caught. Heard this morning about an 11lb'er caught in the bay by someone trolling cranks.Another fellow I had coffee with this morning was out yesterday jig fishing in the river. Says he did pretty good but didn't get anything over 7 lbs.If still fishing look for structure eg around the points and be sure to get that jig right down to bottom. Salted Pine Falls shiners seems to be doing as well as live chubs.Lots of big drum getting caught - always a blast and apparently quite tasty but you must cut away the red meat
515091,Guest,2001-09-27 09:33:00,0,"Just got back from The Winnipeg river, Traverse bay. The fishing is slow, but the there are some green backs that are coming in. The water temp droppesd in the week we were there from 62 to 59. The forcast wasnt good as the high are going to be in the high 60's low 70's with a south wind, with the nights in the 40's. Talked with a local that predicts that it will be at least 2 weeks before the fishing peeks. Even the commercial fishermen are having a rough go of it. I don't want to get everyone down, because there are some fish being caught, it just isn't typical fall fishing at the Winnepeg. Tuesday 4 guys 2 boats caught 80 fish in the river, although most were 12-15 inches we did get 4 in the 4 to 5 lb range. Its always just good to get away and enjoy some great fishing and great hospitality form the Candadian folksHarty"
515092,Hawgeye,2001-09-27 21:56:00,1355,"Well since it sounds like the fishing will be a little slow at Pine Falls, I went out and did a little grocery shopping tonight. Weather forecast is for warm weather through the weekend with slight chances of rain and not to dreadfully heavy winds. Picked up some lunchmeat and buns for out on the lake, picked up some Jalepeno poppers and onion rings for the fryer just in case fishing is soooo slow that we have no shore lunch. Been going for 12 years and I have yet to not catch at least a limit of small fish so even if it is a little slow, not too worried. I'M READY! PUSH OFF IN 29HOURS. From then, 6 HOURS to Launch including the anticipated 1 Hour delay at Pembina\Emerson and picking up bait at ProAm. By the way, can anyone tell me when Boris opens shop? We will likely be there around 9am. LET'S GO FISHING FOR GREENBACKS!"
515093,cnem,2001-09-28 09:56:00,50,"where ya from Hawgeye? sounds like your not to far up the road from myself. has anybody ever frozen their own larger size minnows or creek chubs and taken up. If so has it worked? We've always had a tougher time getting nice sized minnows in Pine Falls.Thanks,cnem"
