I would really appreciate your latest experience in the last couple of weeks. Thanks, Bruce>Wondering if anyone has most recent experience with crossing >the border after the WTC disaster. Planning to enter Canada >this Friday. Any information would be helpful. >>Thanks"

If you have behaved since your DWI they most likely would grant you one. Since DWI is a felony, and no one with a felony conviction is permitted to enter Canada, it will depend on if the Customs Officer asks you the question or not. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't."
514974,Wallerian,2001-10-02 09:01:00,10,"Entered Canada via Sault Ste. Marie 9/15 and returned 9/22. No significant delays either way (20 min.) with just a few things worth mentioning. Before going over the bridge into Canada we were approached by two U.S. Customs agents who asked us a few questions about destination, length of stay, etc. At Canadian customs we were asked the usual array of questions and were asked to hand over each passengers drivers license. Couldn't see what was being done with them but were returned to us in short order. Returning we encountered two U.S. agents, one asked the questions while the other looked in trunks and back of vans. Have a safe trip."

514962,Guest,2001-09-17 07:30:00,0,"Canada Customs has beefed up security, you should be alright provided you have proper documentation (birth certificate, Drivers licence) they will check your vehicle. Basically as long as you are not carrying any handguns, or drugs you should be ok!"
514963,bigfish1965,2001-09-17 13:19:00,3210,"If you have a passport bring it. This saves quite a bit of time. Also, pack knowing that all items will be opened. Keep your knives together so that you may make note of them to Customs Officers promptly. Having a load of fishing equipment will verify their use as fishing implements. If you have ANY prior convictions in the US (including DWI) you will probably not be allowed to enter Canada.However, there are ways to enter with convictions, provided you have stayed out of trouble for awhile. Contact the local Canadian Consulate for information on waivers to enter the country. Be patient and try to cross at non-peak times. Before 8 am is best."
514964,GregK,2001-09-17 14:34:00,113,Just got back last weekend. We went through Sat about 8:30 AM. The line to the states was about an hour. The line to Canada could not be estimated since it was really long. On a positive note there were many many officers working hard to inspect and get you moving. Plan on delays and try late afternoon going and early morning leaving. Canadian people could not have been any more sympathatic to our problems. Have a good one.
514965,Guest,2001-09-17 15:11:00,0,"Probably depends where you are crossing. Just returned from Northern Ontario saturday and crossed into the U.S at the 1,000 islands at 4:30 pm. There were 5 cars in 2 lines. They asked the usual questions and 2 guys opened the pickup cap door and looked around inside. One guy said we were o.k and were a couple of fishermen then we were on our way. We really were prepared to be tore apart, which is o.k if it keeps our country safer. You should be fine."
514966,Frank from TBay,2001-09-17 19:27:00,312,The lines at Pigeon River are no different than any other day. Good luck
514967,Pitts,2001-09-17 23:58:00,1965,Talked to a guy tonight that just got backfrom a trip to LOTW which he had to cross at Warroad.He said there was no cars in line going in and they were tore apart for almost an hour and then told to go fun!! fun!! On the way back they were waived thru with only a stop and if they had anything to declair. Go figure?? I hope it keeps 1 person safe doing the spot checks.Pitts
514968,Guest,2001-09-23 07:26:00,0,"i just crossed at the international falls crossing. we arrived there at 8:30 a.m.. we could not have been more surprised to find only two vehicles in front of us and they were both in one of the lines. we had a party of two cars, and we went into the other line. the canadian side of the border did not bother us at all as we were leaving canada. the american side stoped and checked us out. one of the guards talked to us and asked questions, while the quard looked in the van and checked out our boat. everyone was courteous and friendly. we went thru quicker than we had ever gone thru before. maybe more people wanted to go thru at a later time, or what ever, but there was one there trying to cross at that time. p.s. we had a great time in canada. the fishing was great and the people were frendly. we love going to canda and hope that we can return next year. pepe"

514970,ggg,2001-09-26 20:12:00,115,"Returned to US on 9-13 at International Falls, mid-morning, 1/2 hour to cross. No big deal. Entered Canada on 9-15 at 6:00 am. No wait at all. Returned to the US at Pigeon River on 9-23 around noon, no linegot right thru. Just the normal questions. I guess I was surprised that not once at either crossing was I asked for any identification."
