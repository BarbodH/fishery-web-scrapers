515103,Guest,2001-09-27 07:04:00,0,Wondering if anyone can tell me if there is a good October bite at Last Mountain Lake? I've never been there and have only seen it on the map....Thanks
515104,Guest,2001-09-29 18:17:00,0,"We just got back from two weeks there last Sunday. We caught and released quite a few northerns. Most were 32-36"". Biggest was 42"". We got a few walleyes the first few days. They ran 5-8lbs. G&S Marina has a site on the net I belive. They are located at Rowans Revene. Watch out for the snow geese. They were starting to get thick when we lrft."
515105,Guest,2001-09-30 07:10:00,0,LarryWere you not fishing for walleye? Just a few walleye in 2 weeks time doesn't sound the greatest??? I've heard this can be a good walleye lake...
515107,Guest,2001-09-30 08:02:00,0,Fishing on Last Mountain Lake the website is at www.gsmarina.com
515106,Guest,2001-10-01 17:51:00,0,We go for the northerns mostly. I've fished there in September the last two years. Last year I didn't hear of any walleyes and this year I know of five. There are a lot of people who fish for only walleyes but I didn't see any of them catch any. The only walleyes I know of were caught while fishing for northerns. The walleye fishermen did catch northerns though. We were fishing the middle to upper end of the lake. I understand that they do fairly well on the walleyes in the spring. I talked to GS Marina at the MORE show in Billings last spring. He said that they trolled cranks deep for walleyes in the fall and did well. We did catch a lot of small walleyes from the shore at a small lake near there.
