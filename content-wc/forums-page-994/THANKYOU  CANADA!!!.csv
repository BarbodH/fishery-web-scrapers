We heard about the tradgedy in the U.S on thurs. afternoon from our bush pilot that picked us up at the outpost camp. He had just gotten clearance to fly 1:00 that afternoon. The first thing he asked us was weather we had a transistor radio and heard what had happened on tuesday morning. We told him no and he began to tell us. Needless to say my Dad and I were in shock. It really didn't sink in until we returned to the lodge and seen the horrible footage on television. The support that we witnessed at the lodge, in town and on our way home on saturday was remarkable. THANKYOU CANADA!!! You are our true neighbors and friends. United We Stand..."

515010,Hunter,2001-09-21 07:04:00,346,"I listenned to it too, and I didnt here any mention of our efforts or losses. I dont want to seem petty, but it upset me at the time. I know what has been done, heck I was at the blood bank within 5 hours of the attack. It was on oversight on his part, and I know we are not forgotten!!"
515013,Hawgeye,2001-09-21 07:57:00,1355,"I think all of the USA regards Canada as a brother country. I know I do. Since the main terrorist threats are considered to be in the European countries, I am sure that these are who he was trying to offer praise for there support simply because they may be more in the line of fire. Sounds like a mistake and an oversight that should have been addressed. GOD BLESS CANADA! We are your brothers and thank you for the freedoms that you hold dear in your beliefs. You are not forgotten."
515011,Guest,2001-09-21 08:06:00,0,I believe that it goes without saying about the US and Canada's support of one another. I felt that he was mentioning European countries that are closer to where the terrorists have been supported over the years and where their help at this time will be crucial to effectively fighting these terrorists. No doubt your countries willingness to accept diverted airplanes during the crisis was immensly appreciated!
515012,Guest,2001-09-21 09:19:00,0,I think we should save this post so next time an unecessary bickering topic between US and Candians on here starts we can use it to show that the outbursts between us are but a mere speck of importance in everyday life.Hopefully the terrorists will forget us too when sh*t really starts hitting the fan too.WW

515015,Chaz,2001-09-28 05:16:00,46,"As I watched Bush's speech, I commented to my wife that Canada was not mentioned. We've been visiting Canada and our Canadian friends numerous times a year for over 40 years. I am one Pennsylvanian that appreciates our Canadian brothers / cousins / neighbors / friends. Where else on this planet do you see 2 countries like ours? especially neighbors."
