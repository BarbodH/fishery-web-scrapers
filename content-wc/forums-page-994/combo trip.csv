515122,Guest,2001-10-01 13:46:00,0,"Pete,Just got back from a combo trip. Left for northern Ontario on sept 22. There were a few to many leaves still on the trees, tough to see the birds but still better hunting than anywere here in Wisconsin. The weather turned out great. Hard frost in the morning and upper 60's in the afternoon. We would hunt the morning until it warmed up then go fishing. Caught several meals of fish and had plenty of birds to eat as well. The boiled northern was the best eating fish.As far as time of the year, another week latter would have provided better visability for the birds. Some of the lakes were in the process of turning over, that may be done this week as well. I think the moose rifle season starts soon too, I would rather stay out of the way of those guys, they run the roads pretty hard tracking and I would hate to run off a moose while hunting birds.The weather in genereal is a tough old lady to shave. Could be sunny and warm or bitter cold and rain. The latter in the year the more extream and unpredictable the changes may be.I would take the smallest aluminum boat you are comfortable fishing out of and go for the remote lakes and road hunt on your way in and out. The birds having little pressure don't flush. You have plenty of time to jump out load the gun and shoot. Most of the locals use .22 rifles and don't leave the car. Toughest part for me was telling the diference between a grouse and a spruce hen. Don't shoot the spruce they taste like bad gin. The locals said the birds were down this year, I think it just meant you might have to leave the vehicle and do some walking. We had no problems finding birds.I would highly recomend a dual trip, just plan enough time to do them justice, a three day trip would definatly be too short. Five good hunting and fishing days was good for me.Let me know if you want details.Best regards,Brewhunter"
515123,Guest,2001-10-02 03:16:00,0,"Brewhunter, I would be heading up for a combo trip but can't see spending the extra $50 to bring a gun across + the $40 for license for a few birds!I've hunted birds up there couple years but thanks to Canadas mis guided wisdom probably won't be doing it til I'm retired and have more time. Where abouts did you hunt. I've hunted 20 mile S. of Nestor Falls and also Sioux Narrows. lots of birds and yes they hardly flush!! Dlhomes"
515124,Guest,2001-10-02 06:46:00,0,"DLhomes,That 40.00 and 50.00 is in Canadian funds, about 60.00 total in US dollars. The limit you are allowed to bring back is 15 birds per person. We also got a kick out of the small game permit having timber wolf listed as small game. Seen a lot of droppings but no wolves, darn.However, I didn't go to Canada to harvest. I brought back one meal of birds and one meal of walleye. Less than the allowable limit. Canada is not the place to go if your looking for meat. Great place to go and enjoy some of the best outdoor life available.The whole trip cost me 500.00 US. For that I hunted, fished, ate and drank to my satisfaction. When I consider how much I would spend to do anything else, anywere else for a week, this trip was dirt cheap.We stayed at camp wintering a few miles short of Press lake. Valora and Silver Dollar were the closest ""towns"". We left a ton of lakes and logging trails unexplored. I think I could make that trip every year and not float my boat in the same pond twice. A four wheeler pulling a small boat would have been ideal. Some of the locals told me about some lakes were the Northerns have taken over. The walleys that are still there are huge and the big Northern action is steady.The birds are stupid, almost unsporting to shoot em. The fish seemed to have a lot more fight. I would drop the minnows twice before finally getting the hook into em, they were so lively.Everyone we run into was helpful and friendly, can't say enough good things about the Canadians. Even the border crossing wasn't bad. The customs gal asked if we had tobacco, my brother had one cigar and I had two, she rolled her eyes and said,""Don't smoke them all in one place."" Gotta love that.That was my trip, last one was five years ago, next one will probably be in another four or five. I would go more but like a fine Canadian whiskey, it should be savored in moderation.Best regards,Brewhunter"
