515078,TomPGrouse,2001-09-25 07:08:00,124,I do not want any trouble when I cross into Canada at Pigeon Riveer. Does anyone know for a fact or can you let me know where I can find out for sure the answer to this question: How much gas in gas cans are we able to bring into Ontario for our fishing trip?
515079,Hawgeye,2001-09-25 10:04:00,1355,Here is a link to the Canada customs. I did not take the time to find your info for sure but the link is as follows:http://www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca/menu-e.htmlI understand that any gas beyond what is in your boat tank and your vehicle requires duty to be paid.

515081,Guest,2001-09-25 13:18:00,0,Canadians like Americans who support the locals.:)

As well our gasoline has more stringent guidelines for the consistency in its manufacture. Also it would be far safer to not be hauling a bunch of gas around. One thing...do not buy gas at a marina. SOOOOOO expensive. Buy at a gas station as close to the fishing hole as possible. . Gas today...70.9 cents per litre or $1.67 US for a US gallon."
515083,Guest,2001-09-25 18:44:00,0,"Rsponses are correct. In years gone by we have taken 100+ gallons because we camped on crown land way up Lac Seul. Now we cannot do that. However, we did get stopped at crossing two years ago and had to pay duty on a 6 gallon jerry can we kept for emergency. By the way, we always stop at Dryden Safeway and provision up for the week+ we are there. It's only fair.TLY"
