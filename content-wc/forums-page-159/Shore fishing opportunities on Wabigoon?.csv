6204184,SterlingArcher,2018-06-04 14:37:00,92,My crew has taken to driving to Dryden and staying overnight before making the final leg to hop on the plane to Cliff and Roma's. I've always wondered if there was anywhere a guy could chuck a spoon or a Rapala or something from shore on Wabigoon to pass the time and maybe set the hook a few times as long as we're right there. Thoughts?

Drive to the end of Van Horne ave and you will see the dock and boat launch. Can be busy in the evenings there. You can also go to Flat Rock park (blue dot). I’ve caught a few walleye and lots of pike there. Drive to the end of Dickson road and park in the small lot and walk over the hill and you’ll see where to fish from there. Not usually busy but also not as productive.
