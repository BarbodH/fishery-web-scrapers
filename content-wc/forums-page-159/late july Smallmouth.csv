6203402,fisher_i_am,2018-06-02 15:46:00,498,What's your go to pattern / baits for late July Smallmouth. We had been going up first week of July and had great shallow top water bite. I assume they were on the beds still then. Late July I'm guessing they won't be so shallow. What is the most productive tactic for mid summer smallies. Canadian Shield Lakes
6203420,Obabikon,2018-06-02 16:29:00,2370,It has much more to do with the water they're in. Stained water lakes (like the west side of Lake of the Woods) will hold smallies on the bank until the end of August. They're up there eating crayfish in the boulders. That said... go to lures are tubes and crayfish crankbaits.

When they are shallow they are usually feeding and more aggressive. When they slide deeper, tubes, dropshots, football jigs w/spider/hula grub trailer and deep cranks can all be good."
