6203182,Habitual Eyer,2018-06-02 05:53:00,144,"Wrights on Gullrock. Easy drive, really nice camp/cabins, lake is loaded with walleyes. little over 500/person with a kids rate available. I have been looking hard in the past for a place to take my fam of four for a thousand TOTAL (for cabin only)....next to impossible to find on the really good walleye waters in NW Ontario."
6203252,pjshorthorn,2018-06-02 08:05:00,5654,"I was going to suggest Vermilion Bay Lodge on Eagle Lake. Gord has a family plan for $1410 ( CDN funds) if you are bringing your own boat. Up to four children under 18 are allowed under the package. With a fair exchange rate, you may be able to do a week for slightly higher than the $1000 if that is your total budget. Cabins are very nice with many now having a nice big screen porch. Good fishing for walleye,pike, perch and northern can be had very close to camp. You never have to make a long run unless you want to explore and the lake is very easy to navigate with a minimal number of hazards to be concerned about. Most hazards are well marked or easily visible. Nice sandy beach area with a dock for kids to play and swim. Horseshoe pits, nice bonfire area to roast marshmellows if a fire ban isn't in place, kayaks to paddle around Vermilion Bay and the lodge has a great sitting area with Wifi and maybe some board games , books etc. for a leisurely afternoon break. The lodge is close to Dryden and Kenora if you wanted to take an afternoon diversion and Vermilion Bay is minutes away if you needed something from the store. There have been a number of families staying at the lodge during my trips there and it seemed like everyone had someing to keep them interested throughout each day. Good luck with your search.

6202864,Walleyeguy70,2018-06-01 07:31:00,12,"Looking at taking the family to a resort in the middle of July. Would like a good fishing lake for Walleye.I know $1000 isn't going to get me a 5 star place, but I don't want a dump either. Coming from Minnesota, so Would like to keep it within 4 hours of the border. Will have our own boat.Thank you!"
6202880,bigwalleye1,2018-06-01 07:56:00,2632,"Lots of places in the Sioux Lookout area would fill the bill. Looking for a housekeeping cabin or meals inclusive? We go to Frog Rapids camp, housekeeping only, but very clean, family run resort."
6202882,Walleyeguy70,2018-06-01 08:00:00,12,Just looking for a cabin. We will bring our own food.
6202900,bigwalleye1,2018-06-01 08:27:00,2632,"Sounds good. Check them out on the web. They're not an advertiser here, so I won't post a link, but they're available on the web."
6202908,pjshorthorn,2018-06-01 08:37:00,5654,"Is that $1000 per person or total for the family? I have one in mind that is a great one for a family trip,but it would probably be over. $1000 if that is your total budget. PjShorthorn"
6202916,Jwendt15,2018-06-01 08:50:00,72,"If you're looking for great walleye fishing and best bang for your buck in that price range, you can't go wrong at Onaway Lodge on Lac Seul. Cabins are fantastic and dock/fish cleaning facilities are top notch. By the way, I am assuming you mean $1,000/person for the week. It would be a little less than that if you are bringing your own boat."
6202926,prov1800,2018-06-01 09:23:00,5010,Be tough at most resorts to get in with a family.most pkg are at least 500 +per person.even with your own boat.kids maybe cheaper.look up cliff lake rv park.its on cliff lake.has all species.walleyes hard to find if your not used to the lake but has unreal smallmouths population good lake trout and muskie.leo rents out beautifully rv s pretty cheap like 600 for the week.good dock.worth checking out.with your own boat your within 1/2 hr to lac suel and cedar lake is across the highway #105.5 min to public launch.
6203136,Aspencreek,2018-06-01 21:12:00,2911,"I would second this nomination, BUT, if you are looking to go yet this year, you are probably only 12 months too late. You may find some place with a late cancellation but that is going to take some work on your part to find an opening someplace. And you are going to have to take what you can get. Quality places like Onaway and many others simply are booked full by Jan/Feb, and they make reservations AFTER the guests they have this year decide they do not want to reserve the same week for next year. I gave up my week due to way to many reasons (none having to do with Onaway) after 2013, I would love to go back up next year so I have my name in for any opening for 2019."
6203154,Family fisherman,2018-06-01 22:03:00,49,"Look at the Fisheries on rainy lake..Price is in Canadian funds.Also Vermilion bay lodge, on eagle lake has a family plan,"
6203178,Bstar,2018-06-02 05:38:00,564,You might want to check out Timber Edge Camp on Butterfly Lake just south of Sioux Lookout. They have very reasonable family rates for a cabin only in July. I talked to the owners at the Chicago All Canada show and they seem to be very nice people. I believe he is a plumber from the St Cloud area and decided to buy the camp a few years ago. I think you have access to a lot of water from Butterfly Lake. timberedgecamps.com
