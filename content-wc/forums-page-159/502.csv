6200476,Stringbean,2018-05-27 04:29:00,279,We endured all of the construction last summer and the road was finished by later. There should not be any problems.
6200546,sk8dad,2018-05-27 07:29:00,1,"I was on it yesterday and there was no construction. They are completing some road repairs on 105, but it was minor. Have a great trip!"
6201446,SterlingArcher,2018-05-29 11:07:00,92,Good to hear that! Looking forward to smooth sailing when we head north in 25 days.
6203316,turkeyriver,2018-06-02 11:27:00,80,"Hey guys, Which way do you go off of 502? Mapquest says to go west on 594 to adams road and take that north to 17. We've always gone east over to Dryden. Anyone try Adams? Gravel? Map says only 3.9 miles, how bad could it be?"
6203350,JAY221,2018-06-02 12:27:00,877,"When we go up we go right because we stay in Dryden on Friday night, but, when coming back we come down the back way. Not bad road just narrow in laces and very little gravel. Depending on time of day you might see critters about. Not sure it is any faster either way? Later, Jay"
6203418,bearfvr13,2018-06-02 16:26:00,174,"We go left, it turns into a gravel road. We come back out on 17. Its shorter for sure, but it depends on what y'all want to do! I prefer taking the shortcut, but actually this year I will be stayin in Dryden, so I'll go right! Chuck"
6203446,NARDA 1,2018-06-02 17:51:00,636,"You can also take Ojibway Dr West from the 502 which intersects with the 594, you take a left at that intersection and take that into Eagle River where you will come to a stop sign at the stop sign you turn left on to Cascade Dr. Cascade Dr. becomes the Waldhof Back Road. Waldhof Back Rd. dead ends at Waldhof Rd. you turn right on Waldhof Rd and that takes you to the 17. Most all of this is paved road but there is a section of the Waldhof Back Road that is gravel but is usually well maintained. This shortcut can be viewed on Google Maps."
6203644,turkeyriver,2018-06-03 10:55:00,80,Thanks guys!!
6203930,Aspencreek,2018-06-04 06:32:00,2911,"We have always taken Adams road too. Cuts off some time and have seen some interesting wildlife many times. There have been times when the road marker has been missing so follow your GPS, it is gravel if that is a concern. Be careful with a couple of the curves, they can be tight and a vehicle coming from the other direction you can't see, or a mother doe with a little one may be standing in the middle of the road (sliding to a stop at 10am to avoid her will wake you up for the rest of the trip)."
