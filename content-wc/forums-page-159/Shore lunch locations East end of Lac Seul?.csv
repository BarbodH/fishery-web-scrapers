Never will we go to a spot that has sand -the biting bugs are just awful. Gentle slopimg of hard rock to the water's edge, out of the wind & waves, and a good supply of driftwood is what we look for"
6202968,SpokaneJim,2018-06-01 10:52:00,118,"I will be fishing the East end of Lac Seul the last week of June. I have never been to the lake, but have Navionics, and looking forward to exploring (carefully as I've been warned). Does anyone have any good shore lunch locations you would be willing to share? Of course I'm not talking about looking for something with a table, but I'd guess there are locations with established fire rings (fire ban allowing), or simply locations with decent boat beaching and nearby rocky area for cook area set up, etc."

6203122,x4flatfish,2018-06-01 20:08:00,319,There are many places that you can readily see as you pass by them on the water. Most of the popular spots have been set up by local guides/fishermen. Much nicer than when I started going there in the late 60's. Personal favorite of mine is on the island by the Deception light. Easy access and great views. Please leave these spots nicer/cleaner than when you found them!
6203690,PRO-V16,2018-06-03 12:29:00,454,Great spots near the entrance to Archer Lake on the west end of Deception and beyond. Lots of good sandy spots.
6203856,Slim03,2018-06-03 21:14:00,159,Taylor Island has some nice spots. A couple years ago we were at a spot north of Bear Narrows and it was a great spot in a cove with a nice point and sand beach. Wish my route would have saved that but some how it got removed. Going to try and find that same spot again this year.
6203882,pjshorthorn,2018-06-04 05:23:00,5654,"Jim, When you get the map I sent you, I can give you 3-4 spots to consider for Shore lunches if you decide to run a little further past Bear Narrows. Most would have a sandy beach as long as the water level is not really high by your trip time. The map is going out in the mail today. PjShorthorn"
6203918,Aspencreek,2018-06-04 06:19:00,2911,"Personally I like a large flat or slow sloping rock outcropping over a sand beach. I understand the beaching of a glass boat on rocks problem, but that is what I look for. BTW, they are everywhere. Reason is because the sand many times have a little bug that bothers the #$$% out of me. Mosquitos, black flies, I can deal with, it's those little biters I can't see that drive me nuts. But then again I may be a little nuts anyway."
6203960,stumcfar,2018-06-04 07:46:00,451,"Another problem with sandy areas, is the possibility of sucking sand into your water intake and plugging the line. We experienced this a few years back and had to pull a boat about 10 miles back. We prefer a flat rock location now!"
6204066,SpokaneJim,2018-06-04 10:56:00,118,"Thanks for the replies thus far I agree with not preferring sand for lunch spot actual cooking location is so much nicer when rock, but landing boat is great when sand. ""Perfect"" spot is sandy beach next to a rocky bench? About sandy landing sites... Look for a proper steepness to the shoreline... enough depth idle until the bow just touches the beach, then give a quick ""goose"" on the throttle, but not long enough to suck sand into the motor. Then I always pull my motor up so wave action does not silt my intake full with sand."
6204086,SpokaneJim,2018-06-04 11:16:00,118,"An additional thought... when time to leave, I almost always push my boat from the bow rather than using the motor to back out... again to help keep sand out of my motor. Agree that this is a pretty brute force method, but when in sand I find that I can either get my feet wet and push & pull the rear end of the boat sideways & ""rock"" the boat free much easier then simply trying to push... In cold weather situations I've even attached ropes to my rear cleats enough to do the ""pushing"" & ""pulling"" from shore. This loosens the bow up enough to allow me to push it out."
