6205034,PJHColdwater,2018-06-05 22:02:00,37,"A can of RAID for the dreaded outhouse. I know it is necessary, but being able to kill all the creepy crawlies is a godsend when the night descends. And to back it up with a good box of ""huggies"" to keep it clean. We also bring a box of cigars to help ""smoke"" things out in the outhouse after the ""raid""."
6205108,Pooch,2018-06-06 05:55:00,4618,"""Yard Guard"" mosquito fogger works well inside and perimeter of the outhouse. Been carrying it for years for that purpose. Doesn't take much. Just don't set in it. Spiders are my biggest concern in the outhouse. I've had very slow healing spider bites on my arms and don't need one on the south forty.Pooch"
6205120,pjshorthorn,2018-06-06 06:07:00,5654,Great....just great. After all these years I never really thought about creepy crawlers biting me on my hiney when in the outhouse. Now I'm not going to be able to get this out of my head for future trips. I'll be bringing a small propane torch and some vanilla scented candles. I hear spiders don't like vanilla scented candles. Add that to the list. PjShorthorn

6197914,fishpoop,2018-05-21 17:01:00,630,"I Copy/paste from a couple of websitesTypes of lime that have been used in outhouses include the following: Lime is calcium hydroxide (CaOH2), or more carelessly called S-lime or slaked lime. Quicklime is calcium oxide (CaO).tep 1Keep a covered, water-tight bucket of calcium hydroxide next to or inside the outhouse for easy access. Also known as hydrated lime, calcium hydrate, caustic lime or slaked lime, this product can be found at your local feed store.Step 2Dip a scoop, which should have a capacity of about one cup, into the lime and pour the lime into the outhouse hole after each use. Sprinkle the lime slowly and gently to avoid producing dust clouds or getting the substance on your skin or in your eyes, which causes burns. Likewise, avoid getting lime on the outhouse's seat.Step 3Repeat the process each time you put solid human waste into the outhouse or when odors become particularly strong. When applying more than a cup of lime to combat longstanding odors, wear work gloves, a face mask and safety goggles to protect yourself from clouds of lime dust."

6175161,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2018-05-05 17:36:00,240,"Hi--one thing I have done over the past few years is to upgrade my old duffel bags to good, high-quality dry bags, and to upgrade the old plastic coolers to Yetis and Cabela's Polar Cap coolers.It's nice to have a good dry bag in the outpost boat to hold stuff like rain gear, extra sweatshirts, first aid kit, etc. Once you have had your gear and clothes soaked by rain or waves while loading or unloading for your outpost trip, you'll appreciate the insurance these dry bags give you.And worrying about meat and other perishables in a standard cooler while in the midst of a day+ flight delay due to fog, rain, etc., is no fun.Of course, it's easy to get carried away, and these things are expensive, but I look at them as investments. I never expect to have to replace them in my lifetime."
6176017,turkeyriver,2018-05-06 09:12:00,80,Just remember the weight of those coolers on a fly-in. I bought a bigger Coleman Marine cooler on sale last year and it works great for the couple days needed to get to the cabin. When the outfitter saw it he thought it was a Yeti or similar and he said they usually have to repack the stuff in his coolers for the flight. When I told him it was just a Coleman he was OK.
