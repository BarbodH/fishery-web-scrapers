This was our second trip to Birch Dale and we have already booked for next year!The weather was not in our favor. Hot bright sun, and very little wind Saturday through Wednesday. We were told that the water warmed from 42 to 60 in the week before we arrived. We found water temps in the mid to high 60's everywhere we went. We were not sure what to expect for fish location. Some reports indicated that the fish had already moved out to summer spots. We began looking at rock structure and points in 15- 20 feet of water and found nothing. on a hunch we went up shallow despite the water temps and found fish in good numbers.fish were found in the weeds in 2-8' of water. best presentations were floating rapalas cast or trolled, and super light jigs long line drifted behind the boat. 1/32 0z jig tipped with a minnow tossed behind the boat and drifted along stayed just above the weeds and caught lots of walleye and northern.we were able to repeat this pattern in any bay that held weeds and the right water depth. it was something I have never seen before to catch walleye in 2' of clear water with water temps of 66+. lots of funThursday and Friday with cloudy skies and high winds the fishing was GREAT! I cannot wait to get back May 25th 2018!we caught lots of eaters and about 20 walleye that were over the 22"" slot. No huge walleye in our boat but friends in a neighboring cabin did catch a 30"" walleye. We also had incidental catches of a 48"" and 36"" musky. Also made a trip up to clear water lake one afternoon and caught lake trout at will. trout were 20' down in 70-100' of water and eager to eat any color floating rapala you wanted to drop down to them. did have one mishap with the boat. I smoked a submerged rock at 30MPH with the lower unit. broke the gear case right off the bottom of the outboard. Prop was fine LOL. that was an expensive and scary situation. luckily we were able to use the trolling motor to get within radio range of our partner boat and they towed us back to the lodge. I was amazed that Marcel was able to replace the lower unit and have us back on the water fishing in about 2 hours. Top notch service. I really like this camp and have fallen in love with Eagle Lake."
