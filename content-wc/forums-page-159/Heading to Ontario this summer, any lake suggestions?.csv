6204398,jackpotjohnny48,2018-06-04 21:08:00,153,"I'll be going up to NW Ontario for about my 30th time this summer, and have fished a number of the lakes previously mentioned (although I've never fished Lac Seul). Most of my trips have been focused on muskies, with some time spent chasing walleyes, pike, smallmouth, and lake trout. When you mention muskies, that limits your options substantially. When you say you're a ""noobie,"" that would tend to make me think that sticking with shallower, darker waters (mesotrophic lakes) would be your best bet. Based on the criteria you mentioned, I would probably go to Lake of the Woods (You may want to check out Witch Bay Camp, as I believe that have a pretty good guided package, and it might be a bit less crowded than other sections.) Ash Rapids Camp or Shoal Lake Lodge might be other options in the LOTW area (Note: Walleye fishing is illegal in Shoal Lake, although you'll catch a bunch of accidental eyes while fishing for pike and smallmouth. The pike and smallmouth fishing is excellent in Shoal. Muskies are present in Shoal, but the pike seem to dominate) Other areas of LOTW have seemed to be too crowded for my liking. Lac Seul is probably considered to be the single best walleye water in NW Ontario (Sunset Country), whereas LOTW might be the best overall ""multispecies"" lake. Cedar - I've been there, and in my opinion, you would probably find it to be a bit too crowded for your liking, based on what you said. Minaki - You'll probably find that to be too crowded as well (it's only 30 minutes north of Kenora), and I think the fishing is a bit better on Lake of the Woods, in my experience. Rainy Lake - never fished it, but has a reputation for smallmouth and pike, with walleyes having improved in recent years. It's not necessarily a famous musky destination per se, but muskies are present. Eagle - that's another multispecies option, but I think Lake of the Woods is just a bit better. My guess is that Eagle will be almost as crowded as Lake of the Woods. I'm personally going to Pipestone Lake again this year, which has all the species you listed, as well as lake trout. However, it's probably not for noobies. The ultra clear, oligotrophic water often forces us to fish after dark. If you're willing to cross muskies off your list, and just focus on pike, walleye, and smallmouth bass, then you have a LOT more options. (There really aren't that many musky lakes in NW Ontario, relative to pike, bass, and walleye lakes). Hope that helps. Good luck! ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
6204610,emma17,2018-06-05 08:57:00,436,Great post from jackpot. Agree entirely with Witch Bay and would add Obabikon. Both are remote locations on LOW with all species of fish.
6150617,nitroman,2018-04-22 18:55:00,368,"If you are interested in Cedar Point Resort on Cedar lake let me know your dates and i can see what is available. As others said itâ€™s a great lake with all the species you are looking for, drive in, and the camp is located in the perfect spot to fish both arms of the lake. Heading up there in a couple of weeks!"
6200382,LundPuller,2018-05-26 15:22:00,15,"Thanks for the suggestions guys, believe I'll be going to Minaki area in July. Read some horror stores on Cedar and other lakes around it being packed, that's pretty much deal killer in my book."
6200394,prov1800,2018-05-26 16:21:00,5010,Good luck in minaki.one thing you have to realize is it's busy everywhere.it will be very busy in minaki to just for your information.if it's drive in area=busy.
6201678,RACER|X|,2018-05-29 19:18:00,41,"Fished Lac Suel past 6 out of 7 past years. Can't speak of Musky, but walleye galore...big hogs. Lots of smallies and plenty of Northerns, plus pan fish, etc. Have had a lot of fun on Lac Suel. Plenty of drive-in resorts."
6201794,rockape,2018-05-30 06:10:00,215,"I've fished every lake in that area except the Goon. Cedar seems to be struggling in recent years. Cedar Point Resort is the best for location on Cedar. We caught a ton of 25-30 inch walleyes 2 minutes from there. And it is easy to head back and eat lunch in the cabin. Ray and Kathi are great. Caught muskies up to 54"" too. Stayed at Clark's too. Another great place to stay with friendly staff. Free bait too. But it is a long ride if you want to hit the east side of Cedar. Honestly, the fishing sucked on Cedar in 2016. Went back to Sioux Lookout area. The CROWN JEWEL is Lac Seul. Big everything in that lake. Minnitaki and Abram are great lakes too. Minnitaki consistently produces the biggest pike of any lake I have fished up there. Big numbers of walleye and some big ones too. One single spot a few years back gave up a 46"" pike, a 29"" walleye, and a 21"" smallie. Now that is cool. Big Vermillion is also a great lake. No walleye, but I have never been shut out musky fishing that lake. Tons of smallies too. Eagle has big everything too. It is a big lake with a lot of unmarked hazards. Be careful. It depends if you have your own boat. We tend to hit all of the lakes around Sioux Lookout. I probably just made your decision more difficult!"
6202678,LundPuller,2018-05-31 17:37:00,15,"Lol you have in fact made my decision more difficult. I will be bringing my Lund Alaskan. I think I'm looking for more of a numbers lake, not necessarily size, as I'm a noobie."
6203708,LundPuller,2018-06-03 13:20:00,15,"What you guys think about the south central portion of Lac Seul ( Around the Mahkwa Lodge ), would I have to go far to get to the fishing spots (walleye/pike)? Read a lot about the chamberlain narrows, but I don't think I'd have to balls to try and get up there. Also was looking at NW Lac Seul, but that area of the lake seems wide open, guessing it gets a lot rougher out there. How does the fishing compare up in NW side compared to the East side, I know there aren't many musky on the NW side, but how do the pike and walleye fishing compare? At this point the number 1 fish I'm looking to get into is pike, followed by walleye, then musky."
6203786,Nowaksark,2018-06-03 17:12:00,4,"Just returned from Ear falls area, northeast. Stayed at Timberlane Lodge. First time fishing on Lac Seul, and it was incredible. Had 3 days last week with over 100 fish in the boat. Probably over 20 over 25"". Plenty of pike, smallies, and alot or 10-11"" perch. Fished away from other boats, wind blown points in 4-6' of water. Never will fish anywhere else again"
6203914,bigwalleye1,2018-06-04 06:11:00,2632,"To go all that way and NOT fish Lac Seul would be like doing a cross country drive to see the Grand Canyon and stopping at the gift center 3 miles short, looking around a bit, and then turning around and heading for home....."
6204118,rockape,2018-06-04 12:07:00,215,Minnitaki is your ticket then. Huge numbers of walleye and plenty of big pike everywhere.
6147977,LundPuller,2018-04-20 21:08:00,15,"Going to Sunset country in Ontario this summer, anyone have any good lake suggestions? Needs to have a drive in resort. Trying to find a lake with multi-species. Looking to catch some muskie, pike, small mouth, maybe some walleye. Does such a lake up there exist? I'm from the Midwest, and have never been up north, so any advice would be great. Looking at the Lacseul area, what you guys think? Willing to go where the fish are."
6147985,46Harley,2018-04-20 21:29:00,149,Lake of the Woods has all that.
6148001,wallydave,2018-04-20 22:00:00,2151,"Cedar Lake has those fish, you might want to start up Google asap! Most places fill up early, though you might still be able to find an open cabin."

6148521,NARDA 1,2018-04-21 08:33:00,636,Check out Birch Dale Lodge on Eagle Lake. www.birchdalelodge.com Eagle Lake has all the species you are looking to fish for. Birch Dale Lodge is a drive to resort located about 150 miles north of International Falls MN just off the Trans Canada Highway in Vermilion Bay Ontario.
6149225,The tank,2018-04-21 19:00:00,340,lake of the woods out of morson and rainy lake north west arm of rainy lake. no need to drive any farther north than those two.
6149337,Rich B,2018-04-21 20:45:00,1081,"X 2 for Cedar Lake, as that lake chain has all the species you are looking for including trophy Musky. You can fish it when it gets windy and is a easy lake to navigate. It is a safe lake to run, as it has very few hazards. The camps on the lake chain are fairly well spread out, and I would recommend Cedar Point Resort camp (ask for Ray or Kathi - pm me if you want more information, as I have fished this lake a number of times). CPR is centrally located, has newer docks in a protected cove and clean cabins. Good luck where ever you end up, and be sure to file a fishing report when you get back. You just can't go wrong with about any water in Sunset Country. Faith, Family, Friends and Fishing.... Rich B"
6149361,The tank,2018-04-21 20:57:00,340,I would also 2nd that with Rich B. love cedar lake and cedar point resort. we just like the big lake and the shorter drive to Lake of the Woods.
6149385,pale ryder,2018-04-21 21:18:00,1937,"Cedar is a good choice, I've been fishing it for the last 8 years. This year we are going back to the Indian chain just for a change. The Indian chain is also a good choice. Both Cedar and the Indian chain offer multi-species and enough size to not have to keep fishing the same spots yet not so big as to need a big boat to handle the wind.On either lake I stay at Clark's Resorts. Nice, well maintained cabins at a good price, And free bait. Wayne and Karla do a great job running resorts."
