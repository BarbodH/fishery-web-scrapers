A post from a year ago had Indiana as one of the last states from which Canada would not allow raw eggs or poultry. As such, I made sure the eggs I bought were not from Indiana and clearly showed where the farm was - Michigan. Same with the chicken breasts - different state. I also had whole chickens from Costco. As these were commercially cooked, I wasn't too concerned about there being a question. Trying to shop for a reasonable price on steak and even ground beef - YIKES! No wonder we have at least two meals using chicken."
6203538,Habitual Eyer,2018-06-03 06:19:00,144,Heading up through Int Falls in a couple weeks. Any border issues this year with chicken products? We are from Indiana and last couple years we have been asked at the border.
6203546,KC Walleye,2018-06-03 06:39:00,274,We just returned and didn't have any issue with eggs. We brought 6 dozen and they never even asked us about anything other than large amounts of currency and any weapons. We didn't bring any chicken meat itself but they never did ask about that either. We crossed at I-Falls.
6203688,SDP,2018-06-03 12:28:00,27,"I'm always amused by the ""Large amount of currency "" question. I never know how to answer. If I have $1000 in cash is that considered a large amount? I have been asked that question several times but always say no. A large amount to one guy might be peanuts to someone else."
6203692,greenie,2018-06-03 12:31:00,87,"Can't have over $10,000 in cash crossing the border."
6203700,SDP,2018-06-03 12:51:00,27,Thanks for clearing that up for me.
6203852,MikeMcC,2018-06-03 21:10:00,72,"KC, so are you saying that eggs are now allowed or the customs agent just didn't ask you about having any?"
6203866,btyreprich,2018-06-03 21:47:00,1067,"I checked the web site for the Fort Frances border crossing- last year - as I was concerned about our supply of chicken breasts and eggs. The web site says that Indiana poultry products were not allowed. As such, I just made sure that these items had labels indicating there were from a different state. We were never asked about these items when crossing the borde!"
6203908,Habitual Eyer,2018-06-04 06:02:00,144,So are poultry products from Indiana banned again this year ??
6203962,KC Walleye,2018-06-04 07:48:00,274,"Mike, I am not claiming to know anything, was just relaying what happened to our group. The websites are very vague and unclear always it seems. They didn't ask us about any food products at crossing. Best way is to call I feel if you have questions. We have never been scrutinized for eggs coming from KC. Just my own experience."
6203974,Habitual Eyer,2018-06-04 08:22:00,144,"My buddy from Minnesota never gets asked..but us from a previously banned state (or currently banned) Indiana occasionally get asked. If you are coming from a state that's not banned, you probably wont get asked. Is there any current ban related to poultry products ?"
