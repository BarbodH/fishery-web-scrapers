No special reg's for Algonquin other than no live baitfish and in some lakes no organic bait either (worms). Barbs are fine.Quote: Originally Posted by dhottleSweet trip & video.

6203498,BrianE,2018-06-02 21:23:00,98,"Mike thanks for sharing. I have not been here in awhile but now catching up with your last two trips, especially the Edmund trip that had me spellbound, awesome story. Always dreamed of a trip to God's. Some years ago my Dad gave me a 1972 Outdoor life magazine that has my grandpa's address on it and in it a nice article regarding a trip there (can't recall the author's name) and had a Native guide by the name of Tom Favell? The Lake Trout and Pike fishing was very good, one of the interesting things was when fishing deep and had a Trout on the guide would attach a rubber band on the line to mark the depth. Amazing how times have changed with electronics. They tried to fish another lake near it (trying to recall the name) Bentaway? Hollaway? or similar and one other lake was not good as the Native's commercial fished it fairly heavily before or at the time but i don't recall them mentioning Edmund. Also to i think there was mining in the area before then. Thanks again Mike, excellent articles."
6201766,Mike Borger,2018-05-30 04:58:00,1554,"Well I returned home late last week and what an amazing trip in Algonquin Park I had with my son! For those that don't know or remember, my trip last year caused quite a ruckus as someone filed a claim for information under Canada's Freedom Of Information act to get a copy of my interior camping permit which shows which lakes I camped on. We caught numbers of trophy sized brook trout last year which is quite incredible for Algonquin, and the vague video that I published had a lot of people amazed.Here's a link to the CBC news story published last summer:http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunde...spot-1.4232556I took my boy on an even more ambitious trip this year. We covered a lot of ground and endured some pretty punishing portages including a number through dense bush with no trail to reach the lakes we wanted to fish.Fishing was spectacular. Incredibly I managed to catch a brook trout larger than anything we caught last year. It was 26"" long with a 16"" girth and weighed just over 8 pounds. By far the biggest brook trout of my life and most amazingly a wild fish, NOT stocked!People who aren't really brook trout anglers might not comprehend the enormity of this catch, but it's more or less the angling equivalent of winning the lottery and getting struck by lightning on the same day. It just never happens!I'm guessing there might be another FOI claim this year. In any case here's a 38 minute highlight reel video of some of the fish we caught then 2 other shorter clips including one of the giant. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJFomPi3OjEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScGOlOBdhFohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmg8dTUSzjUCheers, Mike"
