6203524,Skip Smith,2018-06-03 04:56:00,3,"My wife and I live in Allentown PA, fish saltwater and want to do a week long American Plan Walleye fishing trip in eastern Ontario or Quebec - crossing into Canada via thousand islands bridge. Will take our two German Shorthair Pointers and hope to return to the lodge in the fall for a grouse hunt if possible. no 4 wheel drive or truck so we can only go so far on really bad roads and would prefer not to fly with the dogs. Looking at KO Lodge, Bark Lake Lodge, Bow Bush Kon Lodge, Domaine Shannon and Pavillon Richer. Land O Lakes is very close but maybe not as good? We will rent the boat and hire a guide since this is our first walleye trip. We LOVE fresh caught, good eating fish so are targeting Walleye over bass, pike, etc. If it all works out we will do it regularly. Any input or advice is very welcome. Thanks."

6203580,Doublelung76,2018-06-03 07:45:00,42,that was stay away from ko lodges
6203686,Skip Smith,2018-06-03 12:20:00,3,thanks very much. right now I am moving very hard in the direction of GOW BUS KON lodge. it is a much longer drive but my sense is they have better fishing.I still may use KO for the Ottawa River and it is much closer of a drive.
6203792,Doublelung76,2018-06-03 17:23:00,42,"Gotcha,we stopped in pinecrest lodge in deep river a while back and the guys in camp did well with the eyes in the river,we fish muskrat lake south of there,been going there since I was 11yrs old,still go more for nostalgia more than anything.sometimes we venture out to nearby lakes and that is when we ran into ko guys.was just at muskrat over memorial day weekend with the whole family,tough fishing because of cold water temps but still had a blast.eyes can be tough on that lake because it is glacier formed and has depths of 200'.my son and I started fishing with airtamarac for flyins and are going to lake Hebert 2nd week of July for hopefully a beat down on the walleye,pm if u have any other questions pal,good fishing!"
6203810,phishfearme,2018-06-03 19:04:00,1242,from a guy in western PA who also some time ago didn't want to fly in (that's all we do now) - we used rays camps north of Sudbury for over 10 years straight. check em out at http://www.rayscamps.com/ - remarkably isolated for eastern Ontario and very comfortable. phish
6204278,Skip Smith,2018-06-04 17:27:00,3,"thanks for the input. I have been doing as much reading as I can and I am a bit surprised at the number of disappointing fishing reports for some of the lodges I am looking into.maybe I should reconsider a fly in. do you guys have any recommendations for a fly in to a lodge that provides an American Plan?again, primary interest is Walleyes."
6204342,youngknight,2018-06-04 19:43:00,228,"The area you originally asked about is close to some of the most (Toronto- Ottawa-Montreal corridor) populated areas of Canada. Some good fishing sure, esp in st.lawrence but not for numbers of walleye. It generally seems the further west (northwest) you go the better the walleye fishing. Not sure about American plan but Quebec has many resorts and air tamarac is well documented lac Hebert and charlotte but also gouin reservoir. Other outfitters on gouin. Many of the Quebec resorts other than Hebert and charlotte ( not American plan) are overly known for walleye compared to algoma and northwest Ontario areas."
