6468384,Eckohlt,2020-07-27 10:28:00,3685,ST.JOE is the biggest mine field in Ontario
6468466,prov1800,2020-07-27 13:53:00,5010,There are many mine fields in some of our lakes.But the worst in my book is the east end of Eagle Lake.Which has zero markers.
6468474,Eckohlt,2020-07-27 14:17:00,3685,"That being said you won't find me on the east end of eagle,if you could set up a lower unit fix it shop in the middle of St.joe you be laughing all the way to bank"
6467768,Eckohlt,2020-07-25 09:50:00,3685,"John I'm coming up with a movie camera to make a movie n put it on tv,I'll title it john the lonely Ontario fisherman"
6467774,prov1800,2020-07-25 10:17:00,5010,Beleive me Ron iam not lonely.Its nice to fish solo.I check stuff out which i cant do with guests or freinds.In the 4 days i got to check oit lots of areas off the beaten path.I could of went to 50 waypoints and fished them but mainly fished all new stuff.Love finding a new spot and catching fish.
6467810,Eckohlt,2020-07-25 12:09:00,3685,"Your right great time to explore,no traffic you can run all the red lights you want"
6467892,eyecatcher1,2020-07-25 17:50:00,323,Happy to hear that you did well there. As you probably know the Abram Chute and Frog Rapids always seem to have a few fish for dinner.
6468160,IaDave14,2020-07-26 17:01:00,99,I am curious since I stay at Red Pine is this in Abram Lake? I know of something like that in Minnitaki once you go thru Harvey's narrows it comes up to 15'. It is between the big rock out from the east bank over to the first island on the west side not sure of directions but left of the rock about a third of the way the way across? If so when good is was great other times not so much.
6468174,eyecatcher1,2020-07-26 17:52:00,323,"Yes, this is on Abram Lake. From Red Pine go right and out between the islands to the main lake. Take a left and it's about half way across the main lake. It's sort of in line with the cabin on the other side of the lake."
6468208,prov1800,2020-07-26 19:59:00,5010,Line up cabin on east shore and the cabins on island .more toward east shore.
6468276,eyecatcher1,2020-07-27 05:37:00,323,That's the spot. I've been up there when the water is low and you could lose your lower unit on that rock.
6468294,prov1800,2020-07-27 07:26:00,5010,You could hit it on low water. It shows a tiny white spot on the map and on my gps.Have to be carefull as it comes up out of over 100 ft of water.
6468360,IaDave14,2020-07-27 09:33:00,99,I'm surprised I haven't found it I have experience with losing a lower unit there is a rock in St Joe with my name on it. I think I found it on my map is it closer to the south shore than the islands-about straight across from the second opening between the islands? I usually head left out of Red Pine to get to the chutes so if I ever get the chance again I will head right.
6467074,Eckohlt,2020-07-23 12:14:00,3685,"Some folks just don't have good rain gear,do you supply extra underwear for clients just in case they get excited with a big fish on and mess themselves?hahaha"
6467214,prov1800,2020-07-23 17:03:00,5010,No.There on there own
6467220,prov1800,2020-07-23 17:06:00,5010,Wallhanger.my wife just told me that the pic i sent and how explained things is wrong.the pic is of abram lake trailer park.red pine is just around the corner from them
6467378,tv4fish,2020-07-24 06:46:00,2694,"Glad that you made that correction - Red Pine IS east of the trailer park. RE: Rain/lightning. We once got caught in a BAD storm coming back to Deception Bay from Grassy Bay/Picnic Bay area. We were forced to beach the boat close to the old ""Boy Scout camp"". We picked a spot on the shoreline that had higher ground with trees on it. We had lightning hit those trees and every time, smoke came up from the hit. We got drenched for about 15 minutes. We literally ""kissed the ground"" when we got back to Deception Bay............"
6467542,eyecatcher1,2020-07-24 12:29:00,323,I knew what you meant prov1800.

6467648,7 Mag,2020-07-24 19:40:00,1887,"Thanks for posting the pics, looks like you’re having a great time."
6467662,prov1800,2020-07-24 20:27:00,5010,I have a lot of time this year.Kinda relaxing for me.I come and go as i want.Was fun putting aròund looking for new spots.Tried lots some were just no good and a few others really produced.
6467712,eyecatcher1,2020-07-25 05:42:00,323,Did you find that rock pile not far from where you were in the main lake? It comes up to about 4 feet out of 100 FOW. Sometimes it's great!
6467762,prov1800,2020-07-25 08:48:00,5010,I fished it 4 mornings in a row.usually got there around 8 am.Typically 30-40 walleyes within a hour and a half.Fished a number of spots on Abram down toward Andersons.All very good till 10:30.would slow with sun and heat.Would run to Minnitaki and fish there. Slower by time i got there but still catch some.Evenings on the rock pile with wife was also very good.Had a great time.i took a video running up the shutes but dont know how to put it on here.If anyone knows how let me know.
6466698,prov1800,2020-07-22 13:23:00,5010,Yup.right in the back bay past launch.I just came in from fishing and having coffee on the deck looking over at red pine.Took a pic with phone.Can see the beaches at camp

6466806,Eckohlt,2020-07-22 17:35:00,3685,Does it ever rain up there?
6466862,tv4fish,2020-07-23 05:28:00,2694,"I (and a LOT of others can answer THAT ????) H*ll YES ---- You ever had ""white lightning"" hit about 40 feet away from you ???"
6466866,prov1800,2020-07-23 05:52:00,5010,Sometimes but not lately.Been dry year.another beautifull day again.Iam lucky this week.fishing might be better earlier nut enjoy nit rushing out.wife leaves at 7:30 fir work and then i slowly make my way to the dock.
6466932,Eckohlt,2020-07-23 08:30:00,3685,In my case john I would run to the dock
6467020,prov1800,2020-07-23 10:34:00,5010,Have come close to lightning.ours was a greenish color.Hit a tree close us and knocked everyone on the ground we were all deaf the resg of the day znd still tinklkng.spooky stuff

6465974,prov1800,2020-07-20 19:46:00,5010,Got here last night and then got out first thing this morning when my wife left for work. Hit a spot about a mile from the house.snooped around a bit on the reef and found some around 30 ft.Very aggressive as they came up to jig and minnow around 25 ft and just slammed it. Love that.Had my clicker and counted 42 walleyes in a hour and a half. Went to the south end of Abram and whacked a few more at a couple if spots there.Met my wife for lunch back at house and after i headed to Minnitaki and fished a few spots there. Bit slower but still pretty good.Spent some time casting for pike and ended up with good numbers but smaller fish.Great fishery around Sioux.Great weather and calm.Hoping for more good weather tomorrow.Got my wife out to tonight and hit my first spot from the morning and they were still biting good as we got a couple of dozen in short time.
6466026,Eckohlt,2020-07-21 03:04:00,3685,"Looks like the only friends you have john are fish,whoops and the wife,looks like some kick arse fun to me"
6466038,tv4fish,2020-07-21 05:15:00,2694,"I hope that John and the Red Pine are doing OK ????????? I check their Webcam often - not too many ""privateer"" boats on there.................."
6466048,prov1800,2020-07-21 05:37:00,5010,Was actually quite busy yesterday.Even last evening when we went out there was a number of boats out.mostly headed to Minnitaki.Very little fishing being done on Abram.Looking like another nice day.From where we are staying i can see Red Pine.
6466052,eyecatcher1,2020-07-21 05:41:00,323,I talked to John about a month ago when our trip was supposed to happen. He's hanging in there. He did say he had a lot of time to fish this summer though. I sure hope he gets his winter renters again this year to get him through the off season.
6466118,tv4fish,2020-07-21 07:50:00,2694,I sure hope that John IS enjoying his fishing time - as that IS unusual for him - he keeps himself very busy around that place......
6466192,prov1800,2020-07-21 11:16:00,5010,Ive been seeing boats còming out of there so maybe has some cdn business.
6466620,eyecatcher1,2020-07-22 11:21:00,323,Are you staying on the island across the bay from Red Pine prov1800? Toward the chute from Red Pine.
6466644,prov1800,2020-07-22 12:10:00,5010,No.iam straight south in a bay just past 5 mile boat launch.i can see red pine and you wojld see house iam in. Big burgandy colored home.id say 1/2 mile away
6466688,eyecatcher1,2020-07-22 13:05:00,323,The house looks familiar. I'm pretty sure I know where it is then if it's near the boat ramp. Across from Abram Lake Park too then?
