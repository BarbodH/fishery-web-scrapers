As my wife and I were driving home we began discussing the impacts to the lake we fish, Cedar lake. with a lake shutdown for an entire season we are trying to understand the impacts to the fishery. we estimated there were around 135-150,000 fish that will not be harvested from the fishery based on number of camps on the lake and an occupancy level of 75%. keep in mind this is just cocktail napkin math. We began discussing just what that will do to the lake. Is there enough forage to sustain the current population of fish? What will the Crappie/walleye fishing look like next year? No angling pressure, minimal harvest for an entire season, what does that do to a fishery? Will populations of fish explode? Will we see a size reduction in the fish population due to available forage and no harvest? Will the walleye just jump in the boat next year? or will there be no affects? Just random thoughts as we drove home yesterday."
6470556,BIGbmuskies,2020-08-03 09:26:00,9,I was there for a week about 2 weeks ago. I was thinking the muskie would be jumping in the boat as they probably had not seen a bucktail all year. Turns out fishing was the same as most years. 6 muskies for the week lots of walleye and as per usual i could not find the crappie.
6470648,Juls,2020-08-03 12:50:00,13414,No worries....Mother Nature will take care of her own. You're not going to notice any difference in just one year.
6470732,prov1800,2020-08-03 15:33:00,5010,Ive been there a number of times and its like big muskie said.What ive noticed is that fishing for me seems slower on all lakes could be just me.I dont go far from clarks and allthough i have caught good numbers its just not the same so far.That goes for Eagle and Lac Suel.But there wont be much of a difference next summer even if there are more fish around.Crappies can be hard to come up with.Normally over deepest water you can find and suspended there.Slip bobber best way to get them.

It isn't any different than a normal year. Actually, the times I have gone have been a little slower than usual. Over time, there might be a small uptick in fish.... for the next several years. However, you aren't going to see an enormous explosion, simply because most of our lakes are already full of fish, ready to be caught. There's a natural limit to the population, and the population is already pretty high."
6471382,Guest,2020-08-05 09:52:00,0,I am wondering if there will be more fish in that 17-18 inch range. They are scarce in the lake I fish. Most are either over 18 or under 16.5
6471422,Eckohlt,2020-08-05 10:54:00,3685,I'll take eyes over 18 all day long and 16 inch eaters doesn't sound to me that's there's anything wrong with that lake
