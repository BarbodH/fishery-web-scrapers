After a five year break spent mostly looking after elderly parents and inlaws I am back fishing again and making some videos of my days on the Winnipeg River between Kenora and Minaki. I, like most of my equipment, am 5 years older now as evidenced by my white covid beard but the fishing is still pretty good! If you need your Canada fishing fix have a look at https://www.youtube.com/c/Nwofishing/videos"

6470272,Campcountry,2020-08-02 15:22:00,164,I am using a three oz weight. You need it for the depth plus current in the main channel areas. Could get away with 2 oz if you had to and if you kept a slow speed.
