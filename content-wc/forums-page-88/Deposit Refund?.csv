6469600,Obabikon,2020-07-30 21:10:00,2370,"I do want to add that I'm not currently taking ""new"" reservations. I have to get everyone that has deposits with us on the books first. There's so much up in the air on our end, and our guests' end... we also do any day arrival and any day departure. So, our book isn't quite as easy as... week 1, week 2, week 3. You can arrive on Thursday July 8 and depart on Tuesday July 13. So, many groups are still setting their exact dates. Patience with everyone!"
6469616,MikeF,2020-07-31 03:45:00,895,No problem and no pressure. Just looking at possible opportunities. The only one controlling my time now is the Big Guy upstairs.
6469626,Windermere,2020-07-31 05:03:00,23,"I just want to let everyone know that I appreciate your input...all good points that helped me with my decision. There was one comment that was made it wasn't about the money for ME and you nailed it. I know in the past, we have went above and beyond for this group. Sadly, it was all about the money to them and not the relationship we have built over the years as they did cancel their rescheduled fall trip with us too. With being said and all the suggestions that came forward, we know in our hearts that we are not an unethical business. We have decided when we get home this December, we will send them a check for ½ of the deposit and a voucher for the remaining. If they choose, we will welcome them back. This way we have met ½ way (in my point of view). Another comment was to put them on the list with the way they treated us through the emails we don't think we have to worry about them ever coming back! We feel they know bridges were burnt with our family. Thanks for all the feedback, it was great!"
6469638,tv4fish,2020-07-31 05:32:00,2694,"AND --- I think you are correct -- besides - IF they did I can't see it being a ""comfortable situation"" for either party..........."
6469648,Dilligaf,2020-07-31 06:32:00,7,Looks like you should get your camp added to the good list on the other thread of how refunds are being handled! That list is helpful for noobs like me in looking at where to go.
6469752,MikeF,2020-07-31 13:02:00,895,"Make the list, label accordingly and hang it in the back office. Eventually you will smile every time you see it and remember things could be worse. Good Luck"
6469446,johnboat,2020-07-30 14:03:00,2014,Some customers you can afford to lose.He sounds like one of them.
6469454,Short Strike,2020-07-30 14:20:00,56,"Imagine what a PITA (my assumption) this guy would have been once he got to your place, if this is his reaction to your more than fair solutions."
6469458,JAY221,2020-07-30 14:38:00,877,"I agree with BrianVA and would add that I would write down the identity of anyone in the group so that you don't make a mistake and book them in the future. I wouldn't even want to see this group.Later, Jay"
6469462,Net_Man,2020-07-30 14:46:00,580,I have been in sales and customer service for over 30 years. I have not always agreed with every company policy for the company I worked for but I believe I have a great awareness of fairness. As stated it sounds like you have been more than fair.
6469470,RichA$1970,2020-07-30 15:00:00,1159,"I think what you offered is more than fair and sounds like that group probably can’t even make a decision on where to eat on the way up, which boat they want to use, which bunk they will take and I am sure the list goes on and on and hopefully their mommy or wifey packs for them."
6469476,Mojo-NC,2020-07-30 15:14:00,1929,"I agree with the others that you have every right to keep their deposit when ""they cancel"" for any reason other than a family emergency or something similar. That policy would apply more to first time guests and people you don't really know. If you have someone who has been coming up regularly for years, you may want to handle it differently and consider cutting them some slack. However, there is one other consideration. I think our lodge states that we only lose our deposits if they are not able to fill the vacancy that we create in the event that we cancel. i think that would be a reasonable consideration as well."
6469512,Obabikon,2020-07-30 16:55:00,2370,"I have 3 groups (out of 150) that want refunds. I'm going to send them checks as soon as I'm back in the US. None of our groups have been hostile on the phone, but I am asking them to be patient. I'm in Canada, and I don't go to the post office. I will mail the checks out when I go back to the US in September. It is a strange situation. I prefer to have guests that are kind, caring, and considerate.... I try to be those things for our guests. If greed, demands, and frustrations are an issue, you are better off without them. At that point (in my opinion), you are entitled to do whatever you feel morally obligated to do. If you hold to the ""roll over"", that is 100% ethical. If you refund their money... or heck even keep it because of the hassle they've caused... all decisions are fine."
6469532,MikeF,2020-07-30 17:57:00,895,I think it bothers you more on the personal side vs the money side. Refund the money and start a $hit head list (no vacancy ever) with this one as the first entry. You will probably feel better and then move on and enjoy life.
6469540,MikeF,2020-07-30 18:01:00,895,Obabikon Could you please PM those 3 open time slots. .

6469340,Windermere,2020-07-30 10:38:00,23,"I know the DEPOSIT issue is a difficult situation for many! But, I would like some feedback on what is right or wrong with my offer. Guest A's date for mid- June was cancelled due to the border being closed. We talked about the options in regards to a ROLLOVER of deposit for next year or a FALL date. The group said they were interested in a fall date and were excited about the possibility of making the trip in which we set aside one cabin for this group. First part of July, we received an email that they decided to try Minnesota fishing this mid-July. We (with no problems) took their group off the fall cabin for 2020 and moved their deposit to 2021. Last week, we received another email that their other trip (had nothing to do with us) was a disaster fishing and weather. In this same email, they wanted us to return their deposit and they wanted to pick another date with us, but wasn't sure of the date for 2021. They assured us, we were their FIRST PRIORTY for their next trip as a group. We emailed them back and said that we would mail them a voucher that would be good for 100% value of their deposit. As we explained, the reason is with everything going on this year that a voucher would be better for us for their return trip next year. Guest A now is saying that he wants his deposit because he doesn't know if they will come for 2021, maybe 2022!. So we offered 100% deposit for 2021 or 2022. The voucher would still have value of 50% if the trip was made as late as 2023 or 25% value if in 2024. We also made this voucher transferable to anybody and we would honor this voucher if they wanted to donate it to any fund raiser (which we have also done in the past). That didn't go over well and he DEMANDED that we send his deposit to him, because we have his money! We shared that a deposit is a guarantee that we will hold a cabin for him and that we are still holding to this guarantee and that we would extent this guarantee even longer for their group. My other point is how would this same guest feel if I would call him, after years of their group reservation the same week/same cabin, and let him know that I now have another group (bigger and more boat rentals) and that I'm cancelling his reservation for more revenue for our camp. Would he say But I have a DEPOSIT with you shouldn't a deposit mean that I guarantee to hold a cabin for a guest (even if I could rent this cabin out for more to someone else) and the guest guarantees that he is coming to our camp (even if some drop out of the group size). We have done refunds in the event of serious health reasons, birth, job loss or death  as most would also do. We do have a written deposit policy of no refunds for cancellations. This year we have had a few that wanted to cancel before the border closure was posted and we have shared with them to wait until the government cancels your date due to border closure and this will keep us consistent with our standard written procedure for everyone in the past and the future. In closing, I would appreciate other opinions. Did I go above and beyond or am I an unethical business person as stated by Guest A?"
6469350,bthomas3333,2020-07-30 11:22:00,465,Maybe I am bias since I own a small business but I think you are fine. You have gone above and beyond to try and make the customer happy. In this case it sounds like the customer wants to use the COVID situation as an excuse to fish somewhere else. That is not an excuse to get a deposit back. They need to show up at some point in the near future 1-? years or lose the deposit.Brett
6469354,Fisherman Ted,2020-07-30 11:24:00,461,So they moved their trip to later this year. Cancelled. Went somewhere else. Had a lousy time. And want their money back?? IMO they are lucky you even rolled it forward. If you are open this fall and they bailed sorry. They are out 100%. No rollover or nothing. If you are still closed and even though you have a no refund policy you gladly rolled over to future years that is still great service. If they were smart they wouldn't have mentioned that they went somewhere else. Foolish. You want an exception and or a lodge owner to do you a favor last thing I would do is throw that in your face. They put down $. You held a cabin for them. And they bailed. You are waaaaay in the right here and very understanding. Well played. -FT
6469364,Eckohlt,2020-07-30 11:29:00,3685,"I would say it's your business run it as you see fit,don't worry about what others think,IT'S your business,just my thoughts,I have a business it's not a resort but I could give a rats arse what others think how I run it"
6469366,Shellback,2020-07-30 11:36:00,8083,Your rollover policy sounds very fair to me. Stick with it.
6469376,bigwalleye1,2020-07-30 11:50:00,2632,I'm with Shellback.
6469380,David Anderson,2020-07-30 11:53:00,2073,"Well, it is good that you have a written Cancellation Policy. Secondly considering the circumstances are beyond both your and the customer's control, your offer is more than fair. As a previous response stated, I also was an owner of a small business we had to deal with this many times over the years. You have fixed overhead that is figured into everything, including deposits. For the most part we enforced our cancellation policy unless it was a large customer who you didn't want to get upset. I agree, this guy isn't coming back. As Ted said, you did hold the cabin for them, if there was any chance you could have reserved it for another guy....he took his chances as well and it's not your fault he wants out. I would tell him that you have been told that he doesn't want the cabin for next year. If between now and then you are able to rent it out to someone else to replace him, you will refund 100% of the deposit. If not, your standard cancellation policy applies. He is obviously not an A customer. It's probably ironic but he might have paid the deposit for his friends that were going with him and they are backing out and he might just be stuck with the bill. That's not your problem either. Stick to your guns. I once had a customer, big company cancel a project and demanded tooling I made to prove our intellectual property idea for the product, they spent $130,000 ( and paid the invoice) for tooling. In the end they wanted to tooling back however I told them to pound sand, they are not getting my idea for $130,000, however could have it for an additional $130,000. Got a letter the next week demanding their tooling or a refund or we'll see you in court. Interesting, I talked to my cousin who worked there and he said they'd never sue you for that amount, it would cost them more than they would get back. As long as you have a written policy and made an extra effort, it would cost more to go to court for the guy than what it's worth. Remember you run a business, not a bank. This guy isn't coming back regardless of what you do anyway. Good luck and don't let a business decision make you feel guilty as his deposit was his promise to you as well."
6469388,v-bay gord,2020-07-30 12:06:00,3168,I wouldn't lose sleep over this group.
6469390,NWBearcatgrad,2020-07-30 12:07:00,36,"Sounds fair and above average to me......the fella wants his cake AND ice cream both. You are not losing a customer, and if so...one that should be most likely! I agree with everything posted above!"
6469434,BrianinVA,2020-07-30 13:45:00,160,"Your policy sounds fair to me. That being said, the customer sounds like a PITA and if you aren't strapped for cash it might be worth it to refund to not have to deal with them in the future. When they try to book down the road you could give them the old, ""sorry, we are all booked up."""
