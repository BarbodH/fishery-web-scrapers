Very tough fishing with a mixture of high winds producing 3 and 4 footers for a day and a half, glassy hot conditions and two cold fronts. Fish were very scattered and we never saw anything more than 2 on the sonar in any one place. High water temps and 26-31' seemed to be the most productive but a lot of boats on most ""marked"" spots and reefs. Fickle bite and the only method that worked was lindy rigs slow trolling leeches on plain hooks. Jigs, jigging raps and crank baits produced zero eyes. Mornings produced the most and from 11-3 not worth bothering for eyes and we casted for pike with only small ones being caught but a couple decent pike reported in the camp. Good news was the few fish we caught were generally of excellent quality and heavy sized 20-24"" ers due mainly imo to the slot limit."
6472004,Lovetofish,2020-08-07 08:27:00,458,I had a friend there that same week and he gave me the same report.
6472128,troutwater,2020-08-07 14:33:00,299,"I'm heading there in 8 days, thanks for the report"
6472146,Carnhzkr,2020-08-07 15:57:00,964,"I was there from 8/25 - 9/1. We stayed on the Ash River, so we fished both Kab and Nam. Kab for us was a bust. Tried it two days and got winded out both days. Namakan worked much better for us. Had decent luck fishing reefs DEEP. Caught most fish from 30 - 38, which is much deeper than I like to fish, but that's where they were. Slow trolled leeches and crawlers. I never fish that deep in Canada due to the high mortality rate, but I could justify it to myself because in Canada, I only keep two fish per license so I release 90% of the fish I catch. On Kab/Nam, I'd keep all except those 18"" and over, so I keep 90% of the fish I catch. That's a beautiful area and the walleyes look really healthy. Too bad there aren't more of them. There's evidently a great food source available. There was one spot I fished a lot where there were two reefs fairly close to each other and when I'd motor from one reef to the other, I could see a deep trough about 75' that looked on my sonar like it was full of bait fish with larger fish feeding on them. Could have been walleye that deep, but I'd suspect whitefish."
6472274,skimottaret,2020-08-08 05:27:00,40,"Yeah we saw lots of bait balls and were surprised how few walleyes we caught. I recon just overfished and pretty much everyone in the camp were desperate to get their daily limit of ""keepers"" under 18"". 17 ers were gold dust and people having 12 inch eyes processed by the dock boy. I think it could be a great lake if they put a possession limit in place instead of a daily limit but whadya do.. also got a few sauger which was cool"
6472314,troutwater,2020-08-08 09:09:00,299,Did you happen to smallmouth fish at all? I was planning on doing that more than anything else.
6472766,skimottaret,2020-08-10 06:56:00,40,"not particularly, we threw slop masters and swim baits in the cabbage and got some pike that way. tried trolling but was tough as weeds were up to the surface in most bays even 8-10 feet deep. deep water trolling with deep divers down to 20-25' got us nothing..."
6472842,prov1900,2020-08-10 10:29:00,544,"Fished Kab many years ago....about 17. There this year mid June for the first time and we had a ""good"" trip, lots of walleyes and smallies. Of course at that time of the year, we still caught them shallow. Nice healthy fish. You hit the nail on the head when you said there was a boat on every point, etc. That was the big difference between 17 years ago and now. That place has really taken off with cabins and fisherman as well. I was really surprised at the traffic. Thought it was because Kab was the next best thing to Canada since we couldn't get in this year, and maybe some of that was true, but regardless, there is way more traffic up there than years past. Was thinking about heading back mid September."
