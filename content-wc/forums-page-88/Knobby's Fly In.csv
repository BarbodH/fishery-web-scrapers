6467912,DaBirdman,2020-07-25 20:38:00,164,"From what I can find, it appears Anishinabi is a part of Clark's Resorts & Outposts. If you look at Clark's website you can find info on it."
6467922,Da' Walleye Assassun,2020-07-25 23:25:00,358,Oops!
6468054,pike50plus,2020-07-26 11:42:00,584,Well that is not a possibilty!
6468080,prov1800,2020-07-26 13:43:00,5010,It is a great pike lake. One of the best.lol.But also Lac Suel.Not many fisherman will fish for them but have caught huge pike there. Clay Lake is another fantastic pike lake.
6468184,pike50plus,2020-07-26 18:31:00,584,"Clay lake?? WhiteClay?Thanks, not doubting your opinion, just not rewarding someone who exhibits bad behavior. Thanks for the oyher 2 options!!"
6468284,pjshorthorn,2020-07-27 06:24:00,5654,"Pike on the NE Section of Lac Seul can be very good , as well as , muskie if you target them. I have caught quite a few pike in the high 30s and some 40s just walleye fishing. I'll get back there in the fall one of these days to concentrate on pike most of that trip. PjShorthorn"
6467136,Net_Man,2020-07-23 13:56:00,580,"Has any one used Knobby's Fly In service in the last 5 or so years that would share their experiences. Would be looking for the good, bad or ugly and the name of the lake of your experience would also be desired. I used them once but it was approx. 20 years ago."
6467194,eyecatcher1,2020-07-23 16:43:00,323,I've never used Knobby's but do know that the restaurant burned down a few years ago and has never been rebuilt. I don't know who runs the fly-Ins now.
6467296,bellbuoy,2020-07-23 20:21:00,490,"We went last year. We stayed at the main camp on Bamaji Lake. We had intended to stay at Kezik North but there was a cloud cover there, pilot said he could land but was concerned he couldn’t get out. So we landed at the main lake and decided just to stay there. One of the best fishing experiences I’ve had in my 64 years and have been to LOTW, Boundary Waters, Vermilion, Leech, & Erie. Plus had the fished cleaned and the boars bailed. Only thing I would change is come into town on a day other than a Sunday, most of the restaurants are closed."
6467328,Net_Man,2020-07-23 22:00:00,580,Kezik lake is what I was thinking about. I do not believe that Knobby's displays at the trade shows and I do not recall hearing about them either. Also before booking anything with them I would desire to know how they are treating their customers this year with the border closure and deposits. Any additional feed back would be appreciated.
6467344,Obabikon,2020-07-24 05:24:00,2370,"I know Knobby's does (or has done) the All Canada shows if you are close to Green Bay or Chicago. I don't know them personally, but I have seen their booth."
6467348,coldtuna,2020-07-24 05:39:00,25,"I have not fished with Knobbys, but they handled the float plane flight for my son and I into Echoing Lake a few years ago. The owner (who I believe is named Lars) is a very nice guy and I spoke to several of their customers coming off of planes in Sioux Lookout a few years ago while we waited for our float plane. All of the Knobby's customers I spoke with were really happy and said they had a great trip. Most if not all were repeat customers, at least that I can recall.Lars and his wife attend the fishing show in Schaumburg, IL (Chicago) in January and I have spoken to them there the last few years. I have not seen them at the Chicago All Canada shows though. I hope that is of some help."
6467382,pike50plus,2020-07-24 06:48:00,584,Any recommendations for best lake for pike? Thanks

6467798,PIKEMAN330,2020-07-25 11:32:00,101,For many years I read about Knobbys Fly in on the last page of Field and Stream Magazine. This was many years ago. Good fishing. Pikeman
6467814,Da' Walleye Assassun,2020-07-25 12:10:00,358,The stories are North With Doc in the InFisherman magazine. The stories are still written after all these years. The author published a book of them several years back. Thank you for the PM.
