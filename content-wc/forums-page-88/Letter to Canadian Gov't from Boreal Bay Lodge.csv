6467610,DaThinMan,2020-07-24 16:24:00,1,"Outstanding letter, Kevin. I sincerely hope that the Canadian Government sees the importance of tourism and understands the plight of the lodge owners whose operations provide support to so many Canadian businesses and their families. Hopefully, they open the purse strings and provide some relief."

6466492,REG,2020-07-22 07:00:00,445,"OUTSTANDING letter and echos many things that I and most everyone else who loves their Canada fishing time is thinking as well. On one of my first visits to Canada - a houseboat on Lac Seul - we had a young man pilot the houseboat up the lake for us - Neal. And one of Neal's favorite comments while discussing the houseboat, or fishing, or life in general was ""You gotta use a little common, eh?"" And I think that is why this has been so frustrating, and usually turns political, because the letter says it perfectly - the vast majority of our trips north involve isolation and are uniquely designed to deal with this virus. Where I fish, I would have to stop one time for self-serve gas before heading back, and the rest of the trip could be done without interaction except for our hosts - and I would even wear a mask for that (happily). I understand the fear and reluctance of the Canadian people in general to open the border when they see so many Americans on the nightly news who obviously have absolutely no common sense. And that is the sad and frustrating part for all us here - the vast majority of us who do have common sense and would visit safely. I pray for the resort owners and hope to be back in country next Spring."
6466500,rosh1,2020-07-22 07:11:00,275,Great Letter. Good luck to all lodges and their employees. I hope all will be there when the border opens up.
6466526,stjoeguy,2020-07-22 08:17:00,979,Excellent letter. The paragraph about aging fishermen wanting to enjoy Canada with their young children and grandchildren struck home. Good luck to all the lodges.
