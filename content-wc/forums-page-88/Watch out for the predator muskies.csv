But this is crazy.https://globalnews.ca/news/7232238/w...zOiYhbdoWIMShU Not sure if I inserted URL correctly, if not cut and paste into browser.https://globalnews.ca/news/7232238/w...zOiYhbdoWIMShU"

Gold rings or silver rings? Just trying to figure out what color combo I should go with next time I'm out. (kidding of course... I hope she gets well soon)

Meanwhile, fisherman are looking at the bite size and trying to calculate the size of that fish while wondering which lake this happened on so they can plan their next fishing trip."

My DOG!! It was swimming at the end of the dock and disappeared in a huge swirl!! The fisherman looked at each other and said, what color was your dog?"
