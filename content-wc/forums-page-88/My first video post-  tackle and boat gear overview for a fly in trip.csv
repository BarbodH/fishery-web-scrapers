6469464,Mojo-NC,2020-07-30 14:53:00,1929,"My entire group used to use those types of bags and none of us do now - your stuff will get drenched in it in a good rain, and all of the leakage will pool in the bottom tray. Make sure to keep anything electronic like cameras, phones, fish scales, etc. double protected in a ziplock bag or something similar inside of one of those BPS boat bags. The leakage killed my electronic fish scale and soaked my tackle box and supplies that I thought I was protecting. The other guys in my group have had the same problem. You don't have to spend a lot of money on a good dry bag, but you certainly can. I use something like this now:https://seatosummitusa.com/collectio...proof-dry-bags However, it can be difficult to get to the bottom of these tubular type dry bags. I would recommend considering a duffle-type waterproof bag. They can be a bit expensive, depending on the brand. We all know about Yeti prices, but here's another option that works just fine for my once a year trip to Canada:https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Tra...Strap/48930986 Something to think about..."
6469550,pnnylfr,2020-07-30 18:27:00,114,Our group has also tried those types of bags with the same wet results as Mojo-NC. We pack most of our trip gear and camp supplies in totes like these...https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sterilite...of-6/568412546 Once at camp and unpacked one of the totes goes in each boat. They also double as prep tables for shore lunch.
6470132,gordy28,2020-08-02 08:36:00,437,"Thanks all - good tips and will definitely not keep any valuables in the tackle bag We do actually take dry bags for the boat and that where phones, cameras etc go I like the big totes as well but since we are flying commercial this year it wasn't an option Andrew"
6469078,gordy28,2020-07-29 16:00:00,437,When we started doing fly in trips I had so many questions about lures and gear and every extra lb of gear I don't use is one less beer! This post breaks down my tackle bag (including in the boat gear) for our upcoming trip to Lake St Joseph with Slate Falls Outposts Hoping its helpful to any one planning or heading out on a fly in fishing triphttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/t...my-fly-in-trio Cheers Andrew
6469100,5 of Diamonds,2020-07-29 17:46:00,151,This was nicely done! Thanks for doing it and Good Luck to you if you guys are able to get into the bush fishing this year.
6469148,Bearcat,2020-07-29 19:45:00,209,Good stuff sir! Thanks for the tips. Good luck fishing and I really hope you get to go on your trip. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

6469188,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2020-07-29 22:53:00,240,"Really enjoyed your v-log. Nice to see what other guys are doing. I am much more of a live-bait fisherman, and bring large quantities of minnows, leeches, and frozen sucker minnows, (for pairing with quick-strike rigs for the big pike). For jigging up the walleyes, and for lindy-rigging, I love the jigs and floaters at www.jacksjigs.com. This guy and his company are based in northern Wisconsin, and I like to give local companies like St. Croix rods (Park Falls, Wisconsin) my business. When I troll for walleye, I just love the old-school jointed rapalas in silver, gold, blue, and flo. orange. In Canada, fishing the 8-15 foot depths, these guys really shine. The quality of your presentation is top-notch. You did a nice job!"
6469204,Bigtaproot,2020-07-30 05:07:00,900,Great camera work and very informative
6469252,gordy28,2020-07-30 06:59:00,437,"Thanks all for the kinds words! I too am crossing my fingers about our trip - our flights to Thunder Bay (from Toronto, in province) have been changed multiple times in the last few weeks leaving us to scramble to re book Our rental van was no longer available due to the two locations in T Bay being closed during the pandemic - as of now though, still a go I hope to keep working through the videos and plan on taking a lot on the trip - probably not as long though lol Also working through some camera mounts for my kayak as a side project and hope to do some a lot of fishing this fall around the Haliburton area w my brother and some friends Cheers Andrew"
6469262,Mojo-NC,2020-07-30 07:15:00,1929,"Nice video post of your pared down fly-in supplies.A couple of additional suggestions: consider bringing a Rapala floating fish gripper like this:https://www.rapala.com/rapala/fishin...h+Gripper.htmlIt's lightweight and really holds the fish well during hook extraction and pictures, especially the slimy toothy critters. A good stringer for the fish you're keeping for dinner is very handy too.The BPS bag you're using is great for the flight and for carrying your tackle, but it's horrible for the boat. It is NOT waterproof and rain will soak everything inside the bag. The bottom tray that is intended to keep water from the bottom of the boat from getting into the bag works very well as a tray to hold all of the water that leaks into the bag. We learned about this the hard way."
6469334,gordy28,2020-07-30 10:18:00,437,Thanks! Like the idea of the gripper - we had one for when we fished musky a lot but a good idea for pike. Will follow up on the BPS bag - I haven't had any issues w it to date but will keep an eye for sure
6469358,Fred_G,2020-07-30 11:25:00,908,With all of us Americans who haven't been able to fish Lake St Joe this year you should have excellent fishing. Especially in that part of the lake. Enjoy!
