6468358,LoDo,2020-07-27 09:29:00,721,McKenzie bay could arguably be the best walleye fishery in Ontario.
6468590,prov1800,2020-07-27 21:45:00,5010,Well iam sure he caught fish on that red line.In the fish Spectrom they dont see red well or blue.Which is the color line i use tied direct to jig.Works well.
6468688,Pooch,2020-07-28 09:13:00,4618,"Yes he did and does catch fish! Red and Blue are my favorite (throw in gold) jig colors. Maybe red and blue are ""camo"" colors to walleye making the jig invisible to da' fishy's. He's also a good boat partner, but don't tell him that. Pooch"
6467986,Tbayfisher,2020-07-26 08:36:00,31,"Took a job in red lake -madsen, they are building a new gold mine. Perhaps 4 months. Staying on the Chikuni river, bringing the boat of course. Things aren't so bad. Watch out walleye."

6468170,Eckohlt,2020-07-26 17:41:00,3685,"Skywagon pls don't pour anymore salt on the wound,I beg you I'm being tortured enough lol"
6468216,Pooch,2020-07-26 20:22:00,4618,"My mama told me to never trust a man who fishes with red power pro tied directly to a jig. Last time I fished with the above mentioned Skywagon, that was what he was using.Caveat Emptor.....Pooch"
6468250,Eckohlt,2020-07-27 03:35:00,3685,Looks like the red power pro line matches the color of his plane
