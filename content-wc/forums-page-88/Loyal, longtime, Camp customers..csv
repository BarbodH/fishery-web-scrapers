6469494,Fishquest,2020-07-30 16:22:00,89,As a Canadian I was lucky enough to go on my trip this year with one other camp member but 3 others from the USA couldn't get here. I told the camp owner to roll over the deposit from this year for next and we paid in full for this year. I thought it would be better for them to have the money to help out after this year and on the plus side my crews deposit is there for next go round. I know most people into fishing and hunting would try to do the same to help out those who provide the trips we enjoy. Financial situations are different for everyone so its gonna be a long go till next year for all of us. While I was lucky enough to have a great trip I can't wait for my buddies to get back up as this is the one time a year we get to see each other with all of us being spread out across North America now.
6471454,drlee,2020-08-05 12:02:00,409,"I have gotten into the habit of making a larger than required deposit each year. I told the camp owner that I was not earning enough interest on the $$ I send him to make an impact on me. In the meantime, he can play the exchange rate market with some extra bucks. And, it helps a bit to have part of the bill stretched out over time. This year, I already had a larger than required deposit. I told him to carry it over (he had already said that would be his plan for returning guests) and asked if he wanted an additional deposit for 2021. He politely declined. I see where someone mentioned a Xmas present. Will probably do that...good idea!"
6466914,johnboat,2020-07-23 08:09:00,2014,"Have you done anything to assist your camp owner during this border issue?I have kept in contact with the lodges I use and can feel the morale slowly slipping away.I'm not directing this question to the one or two time users of a particular camp, but the guests that have built a bond and friendship over the years. Q: Is it insulting to send up a check of whatever one can spare to let the owner use at his discretion?I don't care if they discount it off my next trip or take the family out to dinner and a movie. But am wondering if it' s a little to much.Let's keep this on a personal level and not get in to who's obligation it is or isn't.We all know the bills keep coming even when the checks stop coming."
6466964,Oldicecoach,2020-07-23 09:42:00,15,"Thats's a great idea. I've been kicking around something similar the past few days. Signing a petition or giving a positive review is good, but doesn't provide any immediate help to these guys. We should have an acronym for your idea, how about a name like FINS. Fishermen In Numbers Stimulus. Not too clever. I'm making out a $100 check and putting it in the mail today. Not sure if I can say on here who the recipient is, but if any one wants to know, PM me."
6467116,bigwalleye1,2020-07-23 13:14:00,2632,"For both of my reservations this year, when they were cancelled and rebooked for next year due to COVID, I did extend the offer to increase the minimal deposit I have on file, and my camp indicated they appreciated the offer, but that they were doing OK and were looking forward to seeing me when COVID and the border situation changed."
6467172,frozen fish,2020-07-23 15:42:00,92,"As a Canadian I was able to go to the same camp I have been enjoying in Red Lake ON since 1996. It is an understatement to say that the owner and others we talked to are in a state of depression. Red Lake which is usually very busy was a near ghost town. Yes the mining activities continue and some local fishermen were out on the lake. But no tourists. No Norseman Festival. Only a few floatplanes heading out. On the way home on Saturday we did not meet one vehicle pulling a boat heading North on 105. I took a bottle of bourbon for the camp owner. He was grateful but it is only temporary relief. To compound his troubles, on Monday July 20 his brother while berry picking was attacked by a bear. Peter did not survive the attack. R.I.P. Peter"
6467174,Lund1875#,2020-07-23 16:06:00,280,"Helping with money is a great gesture. I have done it many times over the years. But I was reserved about the possibility of insulting people...etc. So when I do send money to those that I feel have a real need...aquintences....you might say. I just get a money order from the bank and send in a envelope....I know they cash it...and they dont know who sent it....just what I do....and I have done it for widows, college kids, and unemployed folks who want to work."
6467208,Obabikon,2020-07-23 16:57:00,2370,"I actually just got a letter from a guest who has been coming for years, many times multiple trips in a year. Inside was a blank piece of paper and $600 cash. I don't recommend doing this, but when I called to tell my wife, she cried. It isn't just about money... it is good to feel you have people out there who genuinely care about your life and business. It's hard to describe what that gesture meant to me, but I in no way as offended. Many other regular guests have called to offer to help. I greatly encourage you to support your favorite resort operators. They are hurting... emotionally and financially."
6467504,WalleyeTherapy,2020-07-24 10:59:00,49,I did send a check to my favorite operator. I informed them that I was sending it as a donation. I hope it made them feel the way you felt. They're truly great people and I'd hate to see this Summer cause them to shutter their business. I truly look forward to seeing them again.
6467534,Guest,2020-07-24 12:08:00,0,"Friends, I will send a camp owner a check once a camp owner offers to lower my rate when times get tough for me. I send money to the true heros which are veterans"
6467560,MN_Moose,2020-07-24 13:47:00,964,Maybe send a check near Christmas or Thanksgiving.
6467622,Obabikon,2020-07-24 17:42:00,2370,"That's very good of you to support the veterans. Many camps do help people on hard times. They often give much lower rates to families, because it is so difficult to take a family of 5 anywhere. If you haven't experienced an owner's generosity... keep looking. It won't be hard to find once you establish a relationship."
