6472806,10lbeye,2020-08-10 09:18:00,61,"CCR I've made that run through the short cut and you're right--quite interesting! Did you by chance ever stay at the old Geo Bay Fishing Camp (just around the corner from Dock Island)? Went there for 25 years or so until it shut down. Great area for quality fish; the challenge was always finding numbers of walleye. Love the area, though."
6472916,ccr,2020-08-10 14:10:00,8,I stay at Rainbow at the eastern outlet. That's where the tramway and the canoe potage are . My cousins own the camp.
6473326,10lbeye,2020-08-11 14:04:00,61,"I've been on that tramway a few times and as I recall, there was a small cabin back there? Funny you call it Rainbow; that's what we (small group from OH) called it, and we weren't aware of anybody else calling it that. And we referred to the bay with the cabin on the point (as you make right turn into the really narrow channel before you turn left into the bay outside Rainbow) ""Old Timers."" I know the area well and caught lots of big walleye all around there. Take care"
6470634,FrankLeigh,2020-08-03 12:25:00,80,"Good afternoon members I am looking for info on this area of Georgian Bay. All of the posts that I can find are 10 to 20 years old. There seem to be only a few camps in this area and look more like family resorts. We would like to go mid-Sep. We fish primarily for walleye. Any info or recommendations would be helpful. Thanks, FrankLeigh"
6470766,acplumber,2020-08-03 17:17:00,80,try on the ofc forum. there was someone asking on there not to long ago about the same area.
6471562,ccr,2020-08-05 19:23:00,8,"If you're looking for something with water access only check out McIntosh Fish Camp on Georgian Bay. It's in the French River delta area. I fish the same area every year(from a private camp). You can catch walleye, small and large mouth bass, north pike and muskie would be starting to turn on late September and October. I believe they will provide a ferry service from the Highway to the camp. If you want to bring your own boat I would suggest arranging to follow them out to the camp.https://www.campmcintosh.com/"
6471646,ohiojmj,2020-08-06 07:03:00,1262,Is the camp on the key River or more towards the French or pickerel river outlets on G Bay? Sent from my SM-G950U using Tapatalk
6471674,10lbeye,2020-08-06 07:53:00,61,"It's on the French River Outlet as it empties into Georgian Bay, many miles (i'm guessing at least 10) from The Key River."
6471842,ohiojmj,2020-08-06 14:59:00,1262,"Downstream from Dalles rapids I'm guessing. Looks like great location for lots of water and little pressure. I've stayed at bears den and key Harbour lodge and always looking to explore more. Never went past fox Island toward French outlets when at KHL, navigating rocks and shoals can be a nightmare. Great fishing if you can find the weed beds.Sent from my SM-G950U using Tapatalk"
6471862,ccr,2020-08-06 16:32:00,8,"It's a 16 to 17 mile run from where we put in at Key River ( Camp Dore)and 69 hwy. You travel down to Key River to the Georgian Bay, then across the bay to the camp. It's a good idea to follow someone who knows where they are going your first time out. You can follow the boat channel it's well marked, but the run threw the short cut, can be exciting. There is nothing like flying by a rocky point at an arms length on one side of your boat and then seeing the submerged rock 3 ft from the other. When they tell you to follow in their prop wash there is a good reason. Just don't follow to close."
6471896,ohiojmj,2020-08-06 19:15:00,1262,Thanks. Sounds like great remote fish camp and I know the region is beautiful with plentiful fish. Sent from my SM-T713 using Tapatalk
6472198,youngknight,2020-08-07 19:28:00,228,"So, back to your question....yes some good fishing available up by French River, gorgeous country...etc but since you asked about PAB..... Shawanaga basin can be great walleye fishing is n the fall which is just south pointe au baril. Local First Nations have a hatchery and stock walleye every year. Point pleasant Cove is a nice resort in pointe au baril....definitely family style but lots of fisheruse as well, especially in fall. Small mouth pike also decent in area, tons of islands and shoals"
6472456,FrankLeigh,2020-08-08 16:27:00,80,"Hi Thanks for all your replies. Our group did fish the French River Delta and the many channels in that area for almost 20 years. Long story short, the camp was sold to a private group and we started looking for different venues. None of those areas were ever as good for sheer size of walleye, pike and muskie. We still have a few weeks to go, so I am sure we will find something."
