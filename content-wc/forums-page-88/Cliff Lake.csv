Saw smallmouth bass in that clear water shooting up from the bittom to catch bugs.That was real interesting watching that.Could of caught a ton if bass i think but we wanted to change up but stuck to the muskies.Cliff is definately a beautifull lake.Awesome weather once again and only boat on the lake. A guy can get used to that.
