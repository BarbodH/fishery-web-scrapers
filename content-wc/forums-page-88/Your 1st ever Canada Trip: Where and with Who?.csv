6469016,stumcfar,2020-07-29 13:17:00,451,"First trip was in 1990. My brother, brother-in-law and I went to Caribou Lodge in Manitoba and fished mainly Quesnel. A memory from that trip was seeing a bear swimming between islands and driving the boat up next to him while he swam. That trip had me hooked and this year would have been my 29th consecutive year. I have been the one consistent over those trips. Others have come and gone and come back again, but I usually plan the trips and make the accommodations. We have fished Clay Lake and Lac Seul from several different camps and outpost. We did our first fly in about 10 years ago to Glitter Lake, Ontario. TO me nothing is more exciting than watching that plane disappear beyond the trees and knowing we are the only people on a lake for 4 to 5 days. I hope I have close to 30 more years of these trips and my only hope is someday when I am gone, the next year some of the old gang will get together and do one last trip as I have a feeling most of the group will no longer go. I do hope my son continues though for many years after me!"

She sent me with my uncle and cousin who had been going up for years prior. Her being a single mom because of the passing of my father when I was only ten, thought that it would be good for me. From what I can remember we flew out of Nestor falls to a place called Eagle's nest. I still remember the owner/cook's name was Dorthy. I remember learning how to use a bait caster on the dock and caching a few small pike. My older cousin took my out at night to look at the stars in the sky. I still don't think I've ever seen more to this day. My first fly in, my first Portage. I will never forget it."

Twenty two of us, babies, kids, teenagers and adults. Brought crafts, games, activities for the kids and when fishing got slow or the weather did not cooperate. Pontoon boat was available. Heard the wife (28 yrs old) and some of the women went out naked sunbathing on the pontoon until the float plane flew over LOL. One of the guys got the college kid who worked at the camp that summer to take him out and show him where to fish, and what to use the first day. Paid him for his time. Befriended the college kid who took care of the boats, bait etc. Got him to eat with us and fed him breakfast, lunch and dinner. Ate walleye every other day for 22 people. Middle of the week the college kid suddenly put us off. Kid finally admitted the owner thought he was taking advantage of us. We went to the owner and set him straight. Continued to feed him and made him part of the group. At the end of the week we got together and gave him a tip of $150-US (Back in 1993). The college kid told us the prior week the group of guys never talked to him, asked him anything, and treated him like a leaper. Said they did not catch many fish. Moral of the story is to talk to the locals, be polite and gratuitous, they will make your life and fishing great. Kids had a great time, decorating hats, head-nets (which we did not need), miniature golf on the beach, scavenger hunt, catching fish off the dock, playing in the creek, and catching fish. Great time. Memories.dvl2700"

Ken Robins had only his gas/bait store at the time. Got bait, fuel, more information and with some luck got to the Taylor Island beach. Poor fishing but the last night was memorable.

In 35 trips I have seen other humans 3 times. I have taken nephews, inlaws and friends. They will all tell you it changed the way they view everything. One of them told me he tried to describe it to friends and it's impossible to explain how remote we are. My wife and I went alone last year (her first trip) and packed in to an island. She was so looking forward to going back this year. I am retiring next May so we can go whenever we want at that point. My uncle and I go alone now. Everyone is gone or to busy for the trip as they have aged. As we both age though it somehow seems right that the one who introduced me to ""heaven"" all those trips ago is with me now.

In the late 90's, a friend from Bemidji invited me on a trip with him and a friend of his to fish big crappies on Red, during the heyday. We did several of these. After one of them, sitting around the fire in my buddy's yard, he says to me ""Yeah, Jim, this is the guy I go to Canada with..."" and I looked at this guy and told him if he ever has a spot open, to think about me. He just chuckled and told me I may get the chance. His brother was going on a more or less annual trip, and he told me if his brother screws things up one more time, he's out and I'm in. Long story short, the first of over 35 trips up the 502 happened that year, and I fell in love with Canada. started with that one trip, then one a year with the same 2 guys and sometimes a few more, until the leader, around 2003, told us he was cutting the apron strings, and he felt comfortable enough with my navigation and boat skills to turn us loose. This was pre-GPS days for me. Paper maps, eyeballs and memory.... Now I'm up to 2 trips a year. He never had a set reservation, and we always went to Frog Rapids Camp, although I know he'd stay wherever he could find a cabin when he wanted to go, but I've continued on to stay at Frog, with annual reservations re-upped before I leave every year. We still hook with him sometimes, sometimes see one another on the water, and still talk, but I'll forever be grateful to him.

The numbers were dwindling, and they needed some ""young blood"" to help out Went to Wabakimi, and was in AWE of how a fishing trip should be. With the exception of trying out Brennan, Granite, and Wapakimaski all my trips since then have been Wabi. Love the place like a second home. The week spendt up north resets me, and clears my head of a lot of things. I always enjoy those days, as I prepare to return to the classroom in the weeks following. This year has been such a disappointment to all of us. I fear for so many outfitters and lodges that might not be able to reopen having taken such a financial hit in 2020.

My brother had been to Wabakimi with the same outfitter on a trip for his anniversary and I was hooked the minute I saw the pictures. We put together a small group and made the trip in 2012 and have been going every other year since then. Flying on a floatplane was a first for me and it is just as exciting every time I have been since. There really is nothing like it and the pilots flying those Otters and Beavers work their butts off to make your flight as smooth as possible. Living in Georgia, it is quite the trip for us in terms of distance and cost was a factor at the time and we couldn't make an annual trip. Now, I have the time and resources to go each year but we got canceled for our trip this past June and will go in 2021. My first 4 trips we fly-in trips and then last year PJ Shorthorn invited me to go with his group on a drive-in trip to Vermillion Bay Lodge and we had a blast. I loved every minute of it and had a chance to meet several members from WC on the trip. I like the fly-in trips for sure but for the drive-in trip, we flew to Minneapolis and rode with That Minnesota Guy trailering the boat to V-Bay Lodge. That drive was priceless for the scenery and a chance to talk shop with some really experienced fishermen. At the lodge, it was great. The camp is exceptional and Gord is a wonderful host. We used Prov1800 for a guide and it was fantastic and in the evenings Breezy Point did his best to get me hooked on Musky fishing. The weather conditions were tough the week we were there (bluebird sky and hot) but we got to see a lot of the lake and had a great time at the camp with the fellas. We did a one-day fly-in trip to Zizania Lake and it was amazing, we caught more fish than you could imagine and the day passed really quickly. I had packed raingear and hauled it 1400 miles only to forget it at the camp on the morning of our fly-in and of course, there was rain in the forecast. Prov1800 negotiated with the folks at Clark's for some custom raingear (2 large trashbags) that I proudly wore during the one downpour we experienced all week! We took a road trip from V-Bay Lodge to Temple Bay to visit Ricky Spanish and his wife. At their dock, I saw more Kingfisher camp boats than you could count. It was a nice vibe in the lounge that evening and we had a blast meeting some WC folks. I am getting close to retirement and looking forward to the day when I can load up the truck and head out for a month or so and fish both in Minnesota and Ontario. In the meantime, we will keep planning trips and bringing folks with us to experience some of the most incredible fishing and scenery that North America offers."

I will also remember that I trusted our first trip to a questionable RAV4 with over 200,000 miles pulling an overloaded Lund Rebel with all of our (excessive) gear. My Dad had no worries.

We stayed at Ellen Island Lodge and man was it a tough week. We left home in shorts and t shirts and by our second date it was snowing! We caught a lot of bass but struggled w walleye - As we headed out in all weather 2 gentlemen from Ohio took pity on us and stopped by our camp to mark a bunch of spots - it definitely helped! Always keep that in mind if I see someone struggling to find fish and try to do my best to help out My first US fishing trip was in New Port Richey Fla. Headed out with my wife and Dad on a half day charter. Thankfully our charter guide knew we really just wanted to catch fish so he took us to a reef close to Dunedin and we preceded to catch oodles of Sea Trout and it was a blast! I always remember the Captain yelling at me in the beginning because I would set the hook as soon as I felt the fish. Because we were using bait on a circle hook I kept missing the fish. He kept yelling/encouraging me with ""You gotta crank before you yank Canada!"" to this day its still one of my more memorable experiences and sometimes out of the blue his voice yelling ""Crank before you Yank Canada"" pops into my head and makes me laugh"

One of my dad's best friends, Marv Cue, owned a small resort near Jellicoe.

My dad was friends with a local who was a guide second to none in the area. His name was Gus. Boy did he know what he was doing! My dad's friend, Marv, also had three boats on Lake Onaman that we walked into and fished. He was responsible for installing the wooden walkways over the boggs walking in. Onaman is one of my favorite lakes to fish. Over the years I have had the pleasure of fishing Onaman too many times to count, it was always a thrill to go back. I fished the Jellicoe area for many years with my dad. When he passed in 2005, I quit going to that to that area.

Back in 1985 I had just bought a brand new Bass Tracker V-17 ""Guide Special"" boat with a ""Classic 50"" Merc motor from Bass Pro down in Springfield, MO. My 2 fishing buddies and I drove down from Mpls. to pick up the boat from the factory. We had attended many fishing shows that used to be held at the Thunderbird hotel in Bloomington, MN. and had talked to quite a few camp owners from Canada. We decided to try the Red Pine Resort that Tony Small owned at the time. SOOOO - we drive up there and check in - I will never forget Tony taking out his lake maps and marking them - he used a ""W"" for walleye hot spots, a ""N"" for northerns, ""S"" for smallmouth, etc. We were anxious as heck to try these spots on Abrams and Minnitaki. Obviously we were ""brand new"" to Canadian fishing - no GPS, etc. so what do we do - we promptly get lost on our first day out We had 3 different ""opinions"" on where we were and how to get back to our cabin!! With pure ""dumb luck"" we finally got back to the top of the ""chutes"" and spotted the resort. To complicate matters - we had run out of gas (only had the 6 gallon container) and had to use the bow mount trolling motor to get back to the dock. Guys, you just can't make up stories like this !!! Needless to say - we have persisted to return for all these years. I have known these other 2 yahoos since grade school and have looked forward to getting together with them for our annual week every year. One of the year's highlights, for sure. We ARE getting older and know that one of these years will be our last trip. That fact is something that NONE of us are looking forward to."

College, grad school, and life continued to get in my way. Fast forward to 2002. I talked a couple of friends from NC into going to Canada with me - neither had ever heard of a walleye, northern pike or musky before then.We booked a trip to Reid's Birch Island Resort in Minaki for a week. Talk about nice - breakfast and dinner provided in the lodge every day, and a shore lunch prepared by our guide right on shore wherever we were at the time when we got hungry for lunch. We caught lots of small eater walleyes but no really good ones. The smallmouth bass fishing was phenomenal, and both of my buddies caught larger muskies than my previous best from WI (38"" and 43"") - go figure. Lots of hammer-handle pike were also caught. We had such a good time we recruited a colleague originally from MI and a bunch of his friends and family for the following year. We went to a lake lodge near Ear Falls that wasn't as fancy but the quality of walleye fishing was better. The rest is history. We've continued going every year or every other year ever since then.Our first fly-in was last September."
6458146,port1042,2020-06-28 13:57:00,509,"My first trip to Canada was in about 1985 or thereabouts. 4 nights, 3 days fishing at a lodge on Eagle Lake. I don't recall the name but it was not too far from Dryden. I went with my father-in-law and 2 brothers-in-law. None of us were real fisherman but we had a good time. Just two of us are still around. My 2nd trip was in the fall 2012 to Perrault Falls, ON. If were not for the border closing I would have made my 14th trip to Perrault Lake last May. Hopefully I'll do that in September. If not, we'll hope to be back in the spring. Stay safe!"
6458168,drlee,2020-06-28 15:26:00,409,"1987. I was 42. Took my son with me age 16. Spent a week on Eagle Lake with Ron Booi sr, and Ron Booi jr. We were total rookies, but had a blast. Walleyes and Northerns were plentiful. Ron sr had lost his camp in a divorce and bought this one, and we were there for his first year. He sold the camp a year or two later and we stayed there for several more years with the new owners, the Gold family. (Deer Trail Lodge) Gave up on Eagle later due to it being essentially fished out. Over the next 32 years I fished 26 different lakes in Northern Ontario. The last 15 years I have narrowed down to two lakes in the Ignace/Pickle Lake area, Pashkokogan (Austin's Wilderness Fishing Lodge) and Press Lake Camp. Retired, I spend about a month between these two lakes. BTW, Ron Booi sr used to travel with All Canada shows and filet walleyes with a broad axe."
6458182,packpro,2020-06-28 17:23:00,695,"1998. We only had a group of four on that first trip. A friend who ended up becoming a great friend organized the trip. It was an adventure. Flew from Milwaukee to IF. The last leg from MSP to IF was through a high wind/lighting storm in a pro[p plane. Lost altitude a few times. Rented sub compacts in IF. Almost hit a Moose on 502. Had a fantastic week of fishing, adventure, laughs, and camaraderie at Big Canon Lake Lodge. Our leader passed away just a few years ago. I fished with him on his last day in camp. We fished a remote portage lake. One of the last fish he caught was a 40 Northenr Pike. If jumped a few times and made some very long runs. SO much fun. A year after he passed we scattered his ashes on that exact spot. This was to be our 23rd year and we still have our fingers crossed for a September trip Have to get back to visit an old friend."
6458228,elkman99,2020-06-28 19:05:00,180,My neighbors took me to Skyline Lodge in Perrault Falls in 1985 and was 12yrs old. Best friends Grandpa had owned it in the past (Snokes Skyline Lodge). During our stay there we boated from the public ramp near Onaway Lodge on Lac Seul to Vaughn Bay in a tri-hull with a 65hp motor. What a loooong trip! But fishing was amazing! Went two more times with the neighbors and stayed on Wabaskang and Onaway Lodge on Lac Seul. Have been in Love with Canada ever since.

6457860,rockpt,2020-06-27 19:13:00,589,"Great story. Thanks for sharing. I was in college in Buffalo in the mid-80s and my barber, an Italian guy named Joe, always had pics on his mirror of his trips to Nipissing. He'd talk non-stop about what a great time he had up there. I didn't grow up fishing, but after hearing Joe talk up Canadian fishing for a couple years, in 1988 I and a couple of my buds drove up to Nip and stayed at Tall Pines Camp on Sandy Island at the mouth of the French River. That was the start of a lifelong passion for Canadian Shield fishing. Have made about 50 trips between Nip and LOTW, and I'm now looking to buy my first lakefront property on LOTW. Thanks Joe!"
6457886,team walleye,2020-06-27 19:52:00,336,My first time to Canada was in 2003. I was 19 years old. We had a fairly large group that went that year. I give the credit of introducing me to Canada to my dad and my late uncle Dave. We fished on Perrault Lake out of Rocky Shore Lodge. I've since been to Perrault every other year since. The Team Walleye name was born in 2003 on Perrault during that trip with my uncle.

(father passed away when I was still in H.S.) had a great time, My mother was a life long fisherman, and beat me that week too. 2nd 1st trip if you will. 2000, my son's graduation trip to Big Canon Lodge out of Vermillion Bay, he went from there to UND for his college education. We have made several returns to B.C. unfortunately, not every year. Great thread, thanks for starting it. Tx. Jig Tyr."
6457930,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2020-06-27 21:02:00,240,"My first trip to Canada was in 1984, to Wintering Lake on 599, near the Silver Dollar/Velora. My old 5th grade teacher and basketball coach, Merle Jacobson, made room for me on this memorable trip, and despite a cold, rainy week and very inadequate rain gear/clothing/equipment, I had a blast, caught a lot of walleye, and fell in love with Canada. Finishing college, beginning a new career and life, and family considerations kept me away from Canada until 1994, when I made another 7 or 8 drive-to trips to Wintering and Pakashkan. What changed everything for me was that first fly-in to Larus Lake, in the Woodland Caribou Provincial Park, in 2001. I caught more fish in a good morning than I would have in an entire week on my previous trips. I owe another one of my old teachers, Bill Knaack, a huge thank you for that. I have never missed a single year (save for this one), and actually went on 4 Canada trips last summer. I have been lucky enough to introduce a brother and some of my good friends to this incredible experience. Thanks for a great thread and lots of good reminisces."
6457962,Bstar,2020-06-28 06:09:00,564,"First trip was in 1988 to Wabaskang Lake with my wife. Keystone Lodge on Cedar had a small camp there. I don't know who owns it now. The trip was cut short by my father-in-laws passing away that week. We almost joined him when we almost hit a bull moose while driving down 502 at night. The next year we went with a bigger group to Lac Seul and continued to go there for several years. Started doing fly-ins in 1996 and that's where our passion is now. My wife continued to go on the trips with the guys until 2017 when she decided that she had enough. We have a core group of me, my two brothers and a nephew. Now we are planning a bucket list trip in 2022. Can you see the progression here? It's an addiction that has no 12 step program and that's ok with me!"
6457968,fishron,2020-06-28 06:16:00,317,"Being the only fisherman in my family it was 1962 that I got my first wheels. A buddy and I headed north from Philadelphia on old Rt 17 in my new Corvair. No interstate back then. I had heard about a lake, Calabogie, that my brother's girlfriend's father fished. It was a fun trip. It was years before I became part of a fishing group and started fishing Canada on a regular basis. I really regret the many years I missed before the trips became a regular thing."
6457970,eyecatcher1,2020-06-28 06:18:00,323,"My wife and I took a trip every September for our anniversary. We bought a boat the spring of 1992 so decided to take a fishing trip that year. I had read about Lac Seul and a coworker had gone there that summer. The coworker didn't like where he had stayed, but brought back a brochure from Anderson's Lodge and gave it to us. We booked the trip and were hooked for life. Soon it was two or three trips every year. If we don't get there this year it will be the first time we've missed since 92."
6457976,kettyspanky,2020-06-28 06:28:00,271,My first trip to Canada was whitefish lake in December fishing for Perch and walleye. I caught a 29 inch walleye and was hooked. The year was 1996. We went again in February of 1997 and then didn't go again until I bought a boat in 2014. Now we go every summer. Except maybe this year. Always a good time and hopefully we can keep doing it for a while yet.

Dad worked for John Deere, was promoted several times throughout the midwest. This is how the jig and minnow became a large part of my life."
6457788,andreindy,2020-06-27 16:29:00,308,"Like all of you, thinking about Canada. Wondering where everyone went on their very first trip to Canada and who did you go with (or who should get recognition for introducing Canada to you)? 2017 was first time to Canada. We went to O'Sullivan's Rainbow Lodge on O'Sullivan Lake north of Nakina in Ontario. I need to give credit to a co-worker Corey. He would share his family Ontario stories with me over Sobelman burgers (great pub). He finally tired of me exclaiming ""That's incredible"" or ""Amazing"" and said ""Why don't you plan a trip and go yourself"". I had a list of reasons/excuses why I didn't think it was possible. ""You going to sit there for years or are you going to make it happen?"" He was right. I am an overthinker and probably create more obstacles than necessary, but I convinced my Dad, Brother and son to hop in a car and drive 15 hours with me and that is how the tradition was born. Thanks Corey for the motivation. I may never had taken the leap."

I was in high school and an older brother and a couple of his work friends took me. We went there three years. Absolutely great times."
6457798,jabecker,2020-06-27 17:00:00,118,1962 just out of Ignace on a small lake called Robinson Lake. I was 10 years old and us kids rode in the back of pick up with a topper on it. Probably frowned on or illegal now. The adults stayed in travel trailers and us kids stayed in tents in sleeping bags This is the first year i have missed since then. At that time you could camp almost anywhere for free.

My first trip as an adult and it was with my brother, dad, father-in-law and a few friends from Iowa. We went to Gullrock Lake and have been back most every year until this spring. We now have a solid group that has been together for a number of years and I wouldn’t want to be there with anyone else. It truly is a special place and I have missed it more than words can describe. I am still holding out a little hope of a late September week."

6457852,hoosiercanadian,2020-06-27 18:45:00,104,"I owe my obsession with fishing in Canada to my parents, especially my dad. They started taking the family north fishing when i was a baby , myself and my 2 older brothers and an older sister . That was in 1954 , every summer we all looked forward to the fishing trip , as a kid growing up it just does not get any better . The only year i have missed up to now, was when i was like ten and we went to Yellowstone Park on a sight seeing trip, i was not happy, great once you get there , but a lot of nothing in between. I have pictures of a 1950 ford , with the trunk up setting at a road side picnic table , my mom cooking breakfast on a old white gas coleman stove , part of the adventure was getting there. I have fished all over Ontario, from Wawa and Chapleau to Nakina , to Atikoken , Savant lake , Kenora, and Lake of the Woods, and many lakes i have forgotten. Now i have a place north of Red lake , and also close to Lynn Lake Manitoba, it is a 34 hour drive from my house to there, last 200 miles is gravel, absolutely **** to get there, but heaven once you do. My dad passed away in 87 with a Ontario map beside his bed. My oldest brother who was equally obsessed passed away about ten years ago of ALS , i played a cd of loon calls set to music at his funeral, he has loons engraved on his tombstone. I have 4 daughters who i also started taking to Canada when they were babies , they still look forward to going every year and they are adults , i also have 3 grand kids , and last year i was able to get everyone up there for a week of fishing , swimming, and eating all the walleye every night that we could hold. My biggest fear right now, is hoping that that wasn't my last trip , each time i shut the door on the cabin i say man i sure hope to see you again, it's what keeps me going ."
