They take 35 to 50 bears a year out of there . Every year we see multiple bears ,so they are not over harvesting the bears . Plus their numbers are what the MNR allot them to take. That being said , I look for a very large abundance next season,since none taken this year. I have seen bears walking down the streets of Armstrong . The bear i got last year was taken with compound bow just outside of Armstrong ,weighed in at 361 lbs and the pre molar tooth was aged by the MNR at 10 years old . Love the blueberry pics and pie picture. The best blueberry pie i ever had was at The Bear Camp. The crust was made with bear lard ,that we rendered while butchering a customer's bear . Awesome"

6468642,prov1800,2020-07-28 07:20:00,5010,"Definatly will see more bears next year.Sows and cubs are left alone and only boars are hunted.With no hunting this spring and more than likely this fall will see a increase in population.The number of bears not taken in all BMA,s this year will have a big effect on our moose herd as bears account for more moose calf kills than other predators in spring time.Bear and wolf populations are very high in NWO."
6468652,stumcfar,2020-07-28 07:42:00,451,"Several years back we pulled in to the Trillium in Ear Falls for our annual fishing trip. As we were walking in, there were 3 guys out front talking and seemed a little upset. As they were driving into Ear Falls, they had spotted a bear in the ditch. They stopped to take pictures and one in their group decided to try feed the bear candy or something. The bear attacked him and he was rushed to a hospital in Red Lake. Little did they know that the bear had been a nuisance earlier in the day and local authorities had tried to dispatch it but couldn't locate it. Unfortunately bears are wild animals and don't always react like they are supposed to."
6468770,tandm,2020-07-28 16:46:00,679,"too many people believe that all bears act like Smokey, Boo Boo and Honey Bear. They have never been around real wild animals. Interactions between buffalo and humans are also on the increase, for the same reasons. People don't understand the risks they are taking trying to befriend wild animals."

6467246,frozen fish,2020-07-23 18:00:00,92,The man killed by the bear is the brother of the owner of a camp in Red Lake where we have stayed since 1996.
6468088,prov1800,2020-07-26 13:57:00,5010,Have not heard much about this.
6468092,johnboat,2020-07-26 14:07:00,2014,Sad story.I have heard from different camp owners having to rid their camps of multiple problem blackies this year. Both in the Red Lake area.Perhaps the lack of traffic and human activity pull them out of the deep bush.Prayers to the family and friends.
6468572,prov1800,2020-07-27 20:33:00,5010,If theres berries theres bears.Nothing to do with not having tourists here or because a lack of activity.Should always beware and make some noise.We have encountered bears many times.
6468580,Obabikon,2020-07-27 20:55:00,2370,"This story strikes too close to home. I'm an avid blueberry picker. It is actually how I relax in the summer time, or if I need some time to think things through. I typically take music with me, and try to make plenty of noise. I now take our dog with us every time I go. My deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. If this ever happens to me, I tell everyone that I left the world happy. Being in the woods of God's Country is as close to heaven as you can find on earth!"
6468588,prov1800,2020-07-27 21:36:00,5010,A dog is good.We went out last evening fairly close to home for 1/2 hr.We didnt have to go far from the truck but always have to be carefull.My wife loves to pick berries and will go out by herself and will take a rifle along and thats my idea.Makes me feel better if iam not along.She hunts a lot and knows and shoots great.We have seen bears together and she has seen them by herself.A little noise now and then alerts the bears and they usually move off but there are aggressive one around.Always better save than sorry.I dont pick fast and usually eat more than i put in the container.lol.They sure are good.picked enough in a short time for.a couple of pies.Had one tonight for dessert.So good.
