6467880,mrwalleye5,2020-07-25 16:39:00,1922,My wife and I went to Saskaginiak last August. It was my wife’s first fly in and about my 15th. I was there about 10-12 years ago. Major changes have taken place in that time. 16 foot Alumacraft boat with 15 hp Yamahas. We liked it. Many new cabins and outbuildings. Fishing was good but didn’t catch much for bigger stuff.

I will say most of the people I emailed w and spoke w were walleye fisherman and didnt have a ton of info on pike There is also bonus lake trout that apparently are not that hard to find In the end we went a different way but mainly because we really liked our other choice One downside for us - due to being in a national park there are no campfires allowed on any of the SAS lodge lakes (Sas, Charron or Apisko)"

There has got to be good pike fishing in there somewhere. Big water - Larger walleyes - trout to feed on and BIG water. I have got to think if you could get into those N, SE, or SW arms that you could find some MA pike.Interesting on the camp fire rules. I see Charron falls into a different zone which allows more take home fish (haven't done that in years) but I would've guessed this meant it wasn't in the Provincial park.One of these years I will gamble with one of my trips and try it out. Flying out of Peg to a HUGE lake formed by a meteor for around 1400 USD a week...Im in!Brett"
