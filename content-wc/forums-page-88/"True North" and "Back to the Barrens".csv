George tells the stories of many of the little, out of the way lakes, rivers, campsites, and towns he visited while flying a Piper Cub on floats. The floatplane opens up a whole new world of unspoiled wilderness. He weaves history, geography, and science into the magic of fishing and flying on floats in the far northern reaches of Canada. His go to lures are a churchkey, a tablespoon, and a pop top he modified with a treble hook. While reading, I kept a map in my lap to follow along on his journey. I have flown a small Cessna from Georgia to Alaska, but it was on wheels, not floats. In these days of Corona Virus, since we can't be safely out there doing it, we can read and enjoy it through George's travels. Thanks again George, and Best Regards in your travels. Maverick 31"

Since everything is virtual these days, I figure i will read a few books, close my eyes and imagine that I am with my buddies on the lake. I have gathered 3 suggestions so far: True North and Back to the Barren by George Erickson A north woods fishermens story by Bill Krejca Any other suggestions would be appreciated. When it is super hot or I am yearning for the wilderness, i watch and read about Dick Proenneke who was an amazing guy. I have put a link to a video on his life belowhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy-4NxJRxNQ stay healthy, BigTap"

6472566,Camoclad,2020-08-09 05:47:00,628,"I recommend Keeper of the Wild: The Life of Ernest Oberholtzer. Canoeing from Minnesota (Rainy River) to the Hudson Bay without electronics, GPS, etc is fascinating to read about and wish that you could have been along for the trip! He was an interesting fella for sure and a staunch supporter and advocate for preserving natural environments. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
