The water level is as high as it gets....100% full. Biggest Dore 23"" 4.3lbs Pike 35""...I didn't weight it. All said, I still had a great time on the Gouin.PS. Adrian's wife passed away this past December."
1834209,kyle870,2013-06-04 04:04:00,26,Glad you had a good trip no encounters with deer ha! we have had our best trips when the water was in the 40s on the main lakes but you have to really search the back bays and think shallowgo thru alot of tackle toothy northerns prowl there. Did you use the new rd. from sennettere?
1834329,Freytown,2013-06-04 05:24:00,770,"No I didn't use the road from Senneterre, I came in from Parent & fished Baie du Sud. The Mont St Michel to Parent road was very good & is being graded all the time. Good luck on your trip to Hibou."
