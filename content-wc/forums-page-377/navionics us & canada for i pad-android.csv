1822713,rommel,2013-05-30 17:25:00,369,I've been looking for maps of lac seul and came across this app. seems like a helluva deal if it works. anybody have any experience with this
1822737,NARDA 1,2013-05-30 17:32:00,636,What will it cost you in data roaming charges to use the app?
1822769,Andre (wallyandre),2013-05-30 17:38:00,2274,I'm using my IPad as a GPS (not solely) with the Navionics App.Works great.
1822785,Guest,2013-05-30 17:39:00,0,"I have used the same app on my i-phone. No data is used when running the app on my i-phone. All you do is download the map to where you are going before you go. It is then stored on your device. For my iphone it uses the built in gps of the phone and tracks where i am. No data needed, there also does not need to be wireless service either. It works great!"
1822801,rommel,2013-05-30 17:46:00,369,that's what ive been led to believe. you just use your built in gps and download the map you need. for 50$ it seems like a good deal. plus your viewing on a much larger screen
1822841,rnnonmt,2013-05-30 18:11:00,992,The map is not dependent upon a cellular /data plan. You will have to have a connection to either wireless or cellular to download map data for the region you want to see. Once you have it downloaded it is stored in the ipad. Keep in mind you can also buy the iphone version for 15 bucks and use it on the ipad. Much cheaper that way. If you want some screen shot examples from my ipad just let me know what lake/region you are interested in.
1822881,Pooch,2013-05-30 18:23:00,4619,I have the Navionics Canada map app on my wife's IPad. It's not used for navigation. It's great when just looking at a lake back in the cabin or when planning where to fish before getting on the water. It was cheap and there seems to always be an update for it available periodically.Pooch

I don't have a GPS on my phone but it can still give me a general location - albeit slowly. Not as good as my handheld GPS of course. The maps are nice though and it's handy.One thing to note is that if you don't have a data plan it can end up costing you more $$$ to download it. So, make sure you have a reasonable data plan before you do."

Problem with the nexus 7 is the GPS is flakey often reads nothing. The app works great on my smartphone. It will drop waypoints, track your path etc. I foresee having problems seeing the screen in bright sunlight."

The bigger screen is nice. The only thing I will add is you need an iPad that has 3g. The 3g chip in the iPad adds the GPS receiver. Even though you won't use 3g service you will need the gps chip, a basic ipad with wifi only will NOT work. They have been making improvements over the 4 years we have been using it. Currently the iPhone version allows you to switch between track up and north up where the iPad is only north up."
