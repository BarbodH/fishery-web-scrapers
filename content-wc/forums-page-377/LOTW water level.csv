Lake was approx 1 1/2 ft low when we got there last week but appears to have risen in the past 2 days to near normal level & still rising. Lots of rain the past two days & still raining when we left. Forecast for the next week showed little to no rain but you know how the weatherman can sometimes be wrong haha! Good luck on your trip, we had a great one!!!"
