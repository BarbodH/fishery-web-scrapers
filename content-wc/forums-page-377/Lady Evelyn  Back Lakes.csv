How was their service?Did you have any problems with locals including bears? Were there any other folks not with your party fishing the lake?I would hate to pay for a fly-in and find a dozen boats fishing this small lake.If you like Temagami in the fall. I'll let you in on a prime fall walleye spot on Lake Temagami.Stizostedion"

We always catch a lot of walleye on the main lake (Lady Evelyn). There are two arms of the lake. The east arm is more fertile and has more walleyes, although they run small. The South west arm is deep and rocky, but the fish are larger. We always take one day to go to Chris Willis. We love it because you can cast spoons and whatnot and catch pike until your tired of it (if such a thing is possible), although we have caught nothing over 30"". The walk is not particularly bad, although the first 50 yds is almost straight up. We like it because otherwise you don't get much in the way of exercise on one of these trips. Email me and I would be happy to elaborate."

511785,Guest,2001-03-30 05:27:00,0,"Heading up to this area late May early June. Anyone fish any of the back lakes, specifically Chris Willis Lake? Thanks"
511786,Guest,2001-04-01 03:42:00,0,"I haven't but plan to this spring,last year the help at our lodge said that their boats were destroyed by locals on some of those back lakes.Is Willis a trout or pike lake?I would also like to try the falls for brookies,almost made it last year but got sidetracked on some water fishing for eyes."
511787,Guest,2001-04-02 02:49:00,0,"Roger, Can you elaborate on destroyed by the locals??? The lake is a Walleye/ Pike lake and from what I understand is close to the falls containing the Brookies. Thanks"
511788,Guest,2001-04-02 08:23:00,0,"i wouldnt waste any time on the falls unless you like a straight uphill climb and brookies the size of small perch. not knocking lady evelyn lake-we had some decent walleye catches but the falls were way overblown. as far as locals wrecking the boats we were told that too. the pike lake was visited by a pair from our week and they caught (one guy) ten pike-one about 10lbs. the other guy got zilched. he said having to carry the motor across the `so-called' short walk was a killer. im not knocking the place mind, but i thinks youre better off sticking to the main lake. theres plenty to fish and the back lakes are not as great as they make them out to be. if you still insistent try a shot at sugar lake for the lakers."
511789,Guest,2001-04-03 15:47:00,0,"Pat, why sugar lake? And are you sure there are lakers there? The Lakers have been pretty much been fished out of the area for quite some time!Locals are as you may know are,@@wholes who know what is best for their lakes than the Minestreries do!I agree with staying in the main lake as it is large and fish are many but if you wish to try an isolated lake for the experience then go for it!! I wiil not let anyone deprive me of right to fish when I am within my legal rights! Please make sure that this lake does't take you near a Bear/dump site as many of the garbage from the area is fish guts and during the spring the bears come out and are not shy!!!"
511790,Mean Mike,2001-04-07 04:59:00,115,"I too will be at Lady Evelyn Lake this year, last week of July. I am staying at Island 10 Lodge, where are you all staying? We will be taking at least two back lake trips, our choices are Chris Willis, Walsh, Sugar, Angler, Diamond, Lady Sydney and two no name lakes. Are lakers fished out in all lakes or just some? I was told Lady Sydney has good lakers in it. Owner stated that Walsh was C&R for big smallies and big pike, does that mean it is C&R for just his clients or for everyone who fishes the lake? the two no name lakes are C&R also, for big pike. We are leaning towards Walsh and Chris Willis for our two trips, but would like to hear from anyone who has fished any of the above lakes. In trying to find out where to catch fish on Lady Evelyn would you consider the owner of the lodge a ""local""?Let us know how you did when you get back from your trip.tks, Mike"
511791,Guest,2001-04-07 13:52:00,0,"Been going to Lady Evelyn the last 3 years and we are going back again this year. We fished Diamond but it was a VERY windy day and boat control was almost non-existent. Didn't do well. However, there is a group that goes to Diamond every year and they have a WEB page at http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/9111/index.htm. Lots of info.Did very well on Walsh. Best was 28 pike (4-12 lbs.) and 7 Smallmouth in just under 5 hours. And, yes, it is C&R ONLY for everyone that fishes the lake. The lodge owner told us that if you gut-hook the fish and it dies, you must throw it back anyway. Nothing should come out of the lake.Tried to get into Sugar and Chris Willis last couple of years but the water level was too low to get up the creek channel in the boat. Maybe fly-in?Don't know much about Island 10. We've stayed exclusively at Garden Island Lodge. That owner is a local. He's been fishing on Lady Evelyn for over 12 years himself and has owned the lodge for over 10. He lives in New Liskeard. His staff is also local and is very knowledgeable. They've provided excellent help in locating the fish.Tom Kadlec((º>`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.. ><((((º>`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸><((((º>><((((º>`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸.·´¯`·...¸><((((º>¸¸.·´¯`·. ¸.`·.. ><((((º>`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸><((((º>¸¸.·´¯`·.¸."
511792,Guest,2001-04-19 10:38:00,0,"I had the misfortune of having stayed on Chris Willis a few years ago on a fly-in. Mind you it was late September, and I don't claim to be a great walley fisherman, but I am good enough that I should have caught at lease one walleye during the entire week. Plenty of pike. I've heard it is suppose to be good at other times, but it would take a lot of convincing to get me back there."
511793,Guest,2001-04-20 04:50:00,0,"DonG,Can you tell me more about the pike? How many? How big? I'd guess from your message you prefer to fish for Walleye. I prefer pike so your message woke me up. :9 I'll be on Lady Evelyn the first week of June so your message really interests me. I just might try to get into Chris Willis if you did ok on pike.Tom Kadlec((º>`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.. ><((((º>`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸><((((º>><((((º>`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸.·´¯`·...¸><((((º>¸¸.·´¯`·. ¸.`·.. ><((((º>`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸><((((º>¸¸.·´¯`·.¸."
