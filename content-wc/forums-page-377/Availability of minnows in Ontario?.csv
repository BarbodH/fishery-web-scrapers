1832201,dmb130,2013-06-03 13:04:00,21,I just got back from fishing last week in the New Liskard area. No problems getting minnows there. The surface hit 60 degrees and we marked lots of baitfish.
1833785,stillangling,2013-06-03 20:24:00,149,You won't have a problem getting minnows in Dryden or Sioux Lookout. If anything cool weather normally makes it easier to trap them. The cold water will also make it even more import to have live bait and in particular minnows. We had frost last night in portions of NW Ontario and it looks like it is going to be another cool one tonight. Lake of the Woods was 50 F near Kenora today.
1834201,dmb130,2013-06-04 03:43:00,21,The bite for us bounced from minnow to leach to minnow. Our biggest which was only 22 inches was on a single leach. Often they wouldn't look at a leach and only hit minnows.
