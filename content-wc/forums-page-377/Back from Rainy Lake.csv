Well, we got lucky and hit the jackpot. We found a canyon at the end of a bay that also was the confluence of two spawning rivers.The day we arrived the Bigger females were coming out of the rivers and for the next four days we caught and released hundreds of 4 to 10 lb. Walleyes. One day we had 8 doubles. As the week progessed the fishing slowed at the rivers and we went in search of the Walleyes where they would normally be. It took us a while to find the fish but when we did (in other current areas in 19 to 21 feet of water) the Walleyefest continued. We were unable to find the big northerns, but did find some great structure for future trips. We also got a few really nice Smallies. I have heard of the mysterious Blue Walleye. Everything from they are extinct to they only live in a few lakes in Quebec to they only get to be about 18 inches long.Well for the first two days EVERY Walleye was blue. Big ones. after that we started catching the Black and Gold strain that we are used to in Canada and also here in Wisconsin.This was one of our best trips ever. I would rather be lucky than good any day."

Yeah, lucky is good, but you guys obviously knew what to do, finding them close to spawning areas and then movement into a current environment. I have caught a few blue walleyes over time in Ontario, in a couple of different lakes...but never in great numbers. Glad you had a great trip...I am jealous."
