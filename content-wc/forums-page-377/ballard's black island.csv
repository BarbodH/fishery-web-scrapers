The waters near to Big Black Island has ben one of our staples for good walleye fishing on our spring and fall trips to LOTW. Hope someone else can tell you about the resort."

I liked the place but would probably look at Obabikon Lodge or one of the lodges located in the back of Miles Bay if I were to visit that area again. Got caught crossing some big water in the wind there while the other places were located right on top of the best fishing in my opinion.
