It is about 15 minutes from the Canadian border in NW NY, and has Canadian shield-like characteristics with good populations of pike, bass, crappie, and even some walleye. Its only a six hour drive for us and is relatively inexpensive. We call it our wanna-be Canadian trip. Anyway, this year we targeted pike, but due to really crappy weather and completely uninterested fish, we didn't too too well. Still had fun though! If you want a trip with a Canadian feel, but in the U.S. ..... check out Black Lake, NY. Here is a video of our trip.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBXp_J1im18"
