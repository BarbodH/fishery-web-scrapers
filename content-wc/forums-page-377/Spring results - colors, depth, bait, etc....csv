I'm usually a chartreuse jig and a minnow guy for Ontario walleyes. Whites and pinks have been good in the past too.Just trying to drum up some conversation as I'm extremely excited about our trip next week. Best,LoDoDenver, CO"
1822249,muskyroller,2013-05-30 14:51:00,56,"Great topic! I will be up at Onaway the 21st-28th and can't wait! I usually stick with chartruse as well. However, I really like the orange head with a little of that chartruse...that's what I have the most of anyway. Doing a bit of research, it seems to catch bigger walleyes and northerns, I'm going to try some heavier jigs and 5""/6"" soft plastics this year. Saw that's what they do on Silver Water Wheel, so I'm going to give it a try. Any recommendations on jig size and soft plastics for those that have tried and suceeded on this method? For the jacks, seems I do well with natural colors with my jerkbaits and crank/twitchbaits...perch, walleye, sucker, whitefish."

Pike are a pain in the azz like usual!!!"
