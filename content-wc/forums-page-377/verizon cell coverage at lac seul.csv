1817665,Kmanster,2013-05-29 10:40:00,26,All in cost for a fishing trip to Canada: -$1000 to $1200.Not being able to talk to the wife for a week because of no Cell service:-PRICELESS(57 days and counting)
1817753,Mohleye,2013-05-29 11:12:00,368,Agree.....surely the camp has a land line available in the event of an emergency.
1817793,bluegussler,2013-05-29 11:22:00,124,call verizon and add canada to your voice plan for $20 per month. I've been using this feature for a few years. all minutes come off your regular number of mins. It doesn't take long to burn up $20 using your nation wide plan. When you get home just call and cancel it. Easy
1820889,nitrodude,2013-05-30 08:19:00,60,This has worked for me as well traveling to Sioux Lookout over the past several years.
1823321,KC Walleye,2013-05-30 20:08:00,274,"This may be a stupid question and shows my misunderstanding of international cell phone charges but, Does the receiver of the phone call in the US pay anymore for answering call from Canada? Man I feel like an idiot for asking this. Oh we'll, here goes"
1823337,bluegussler,2013-05-30 20:12:00,124,NO!
1823361,KC Walleye,2013-05-30 20:17:00,274,"Great, thank you."
1815162,rommel,2013-05-28 16:08:00,369,our group is heading up to onaway lodge in late July. i was wondering if we would have any cell coverage there so wives and kids could reach us if need be. you never know when an emergency will pop up
1815202,wallydave,2013-05-28 16:22:00,2151,...at Goose Bay verizon cell phone work. Not sure of the charges but in an emergency that's not a major concern.
1815298,jiggster,2013-05-28 16:47:00,183,"If you go to your Verizon dealer, they can put in a Canada Card to help with the cost. I have been told. We use our onstar."
1815346,lcwhit,2013-05-28 17:05:00,104,"think Verizon has a $25 week or 10 day Canada data plan and yes it works on the goose bay area, but can be sketchy based on your phone and location."
1815650,rommel,2013-05-28 18:57:00,369,thanks for the info
1815682,Smallmouth Hunter,2013-05-28 19:03:00,84,The cost will be 69 cents a minute for a call. If you have a smartphone turn off your data or you will be charged heavily. There is a Canada plan but it is not cost effective to switch unless you spend considerable time in Canada. For a week just pay the 69 cents per minute. There is a 100 mb plan for $25 if you need data but that is a low amount of usage. If you need to use Internet try to pick up wifi.
1815874,Pooch,2013-05-28 20:01:00,4619,"Verizon has coverage in Sioux Lookout, but when leaving town is disappears quick.At Mahkwa Camp on LS this is no coverage that we have found, but getting closer to Sioux Lookout on the water you might get a signal as you go east and north. Haven't tried it though.Pooch"
1816058,Knoxabilly,2013-05-28 20:53:00,225,"We've noticed the coverage getting better and better each year. We get service at Evergreen in Ear Falls and some spots on the lake- 2 years ago we ran out of gas about 8-9pm, you know after all the boats are in for the night luckily my buddy turned his phone on, had service- we were just outside the mouth of Sawmill bay by lunker point--we called Gary to help us out so we didn't have to sleep on the water!"
1816466,Terwalleye,2013-05-29 00:07:00,166,If you're reaaalllly lucky.....it wont work at all. To think 25 years ago we took these trips anyhow.
1816985,SinOrSwim,2013-05-29 07:25:00,1528,"We go to Onaway and have coverage. There are a few times I had to go into the yard and stand in a certain spot to get it but we got it. Or, if you drive to the road, you will get coverage there for sure. Heck, my brother didn't turn his off and it rang WHILE we were fishing. You probably won't want to leave the phone on, it drains batteries very fast trying to find towers."
