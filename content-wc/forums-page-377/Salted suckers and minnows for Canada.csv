1830897,Crede,2013-06-03 06:55:00,134,"Returned yesterday from trip to Albany River. Had great fishing. Got the medium salted shiners from Harmon Brook Farm. The process of dealing with HBF was smooth and easy. Looked great. However, we just could not keep them on a jig once we started using them. As soon as we got them wet, it was like trying to keep tissue paper on a hook. We tried them a few times, and always the same results. Drop them into the water or a gentle cast - half would be gone before they came back to the boat the 1st time. None lasted thru a 2nd cast. There could be some ""user error"" involved. They arrived nonrefrigerated. I refrigerated them for 3 days before we left. They then were nonrefrigerated for 2 days of travel. I then put them in the refrigerator at camp. I do not think that they were ever frozen, but they sure acted like that may have happened. In any event, if I feel the need to take salted minnows with me in the future, I will probably go back to making my own."
1834377,polaris-pete,2013-06-04 05:59:00,343,Cred I also purchased 2 lbs of his minnows.They really look and feel hard but we are leaving on our trip this Thursday and will give a report on our thoughts on them when we get back.John the Owner is a very nice Guy to talk with. I had a couple conversations with him before buying. I think I would give them a call and let him know about your experience with his product.
1736433,retire55,2013-05-02 14:00:00,1029,"This afternoon, I spoke with the Ministry of Natural Resources representative responsible for the import of bait rules in the Ontario Fishing Regulations. According to her, the pertinent portion of the Ontario Fishing Regulations (not the summary) is written as follows:Prohibition on Bringing Bait Into Ontario5. No person shall bring into Ontario, for use as bait, (a) crayfish or salamanders; or (b) live fish or leeches.The correct interpretation of sub para (b) is that the word live refers to both fish or leeches. Consequently, salted (dead) leeches can legally be brought into Ontario.Lastly, any time information about or interpretation of Ontario Fishing Regulations is required, you can call 1-800-667-1940. This number is good anywhere in North America."
1736937,polaris-pete,2013-05-02 16:38:00,343,No I think their prices are good also. They look pretty nice on their website. Only 2-3 days shipping for $8 for 2#.Thanks for the tip on this place.
1739137,mittni,2013-05-03 08:03:00,28,placed an order for around 40 bucks. Great guy to talk too. I would order again from them.
1759705,mittni,2013-05-09 10:12:00,28,Just received my order from Harmonbrook farms. I could not be happier with the product they sent me. priced very good and shipped next day. Thanks for the refferal.
1759865,JayM5209,2013-05-09 10:45:00,1050,x2. My order came yesterday. Excellent product and excellent service!
1763265,polaris-pete,2013-05-10 11:13:00,343,"Just wondering which minnows you bought from him.He has 2 different types, one is salted and the other is processed. What was the texture like on them, hard or soft? I am ordering a couple pounds next week so your help is appreciated. Thanks."
1763569,JayM5209,2013-05-10 12:54:00,1050,"I got 2 lbs. of the salt cured medium shiners. They are a bit stiff, but not hard. I'm anxious to try them. My 1st experiment with salt cured minnows and I think they'll be great both on jigs and spinners. I did repackage them - vacuum sealed in 15 count bags - and froze them so I can take a day's supple in the boat each day."
1764257,polaris-pete,2013-05-10 18:13:00,343,Thanks for the help. Have a great trip.
1829953,pan-man,2013-06-02 19:19:00,299,Any reviews on minnow (salted or cured)? Size? Type (Golden or Common)?Thanks in advance!
1830249,Pooch,2013-06-02 20:51:00,4619,Anytime I have frozen anything like bait it turns to mush or gets soft. If they are preserved or salted I think you would have been much better off to keep them refrigerated and not let them freeze as freezing breaks down the cells and they deteriorate quickly when they thaw.It's probably obvious how I know that................Pooch
1728089,Huskerpike,2013-04-30 11:09:00,4,"5richards, thanks for the info. we always take our own salted bait with us as well but this year we are flying to Winnipeg and then on to Flin Flon. Does anyone have any suggestions for packaging them for airlines? Or is this not allowed or recommended?"
1728193,Bigstorm,2013-04-30 11:26:00,799,I assumed that the Canadian Border Patrol knew what they were doing and didnt feel that I was in any position to question them. I would also think that a Canadian Border Agent wouldnt take kindly to someone from the US questioning Canadian law.It was easier to dump them and continue on our way they deal with any kind of hassel while trying to get in.
1728217,5richards,2013-04-30 11:30:00,131,Huskerpike -- They come already packaged in a resealable pack -- I am just going to put them in my carryon or luggage - call and ask!
1728449,tv4fish,2013-04-30 12:17:00,2694,"I hear ya' BUT, there have been many times that we have gone through and it has been very obvious that the agent was a newbie and not ""up to speed"". We always check the regs. to make sure we are doing what IS allowed. All I was saying is if you knew it was legal and they told you it was not, I don't think a polite request would make them hassle you. But, I also understand why you did what you did."
1730857,F250,2013-05-01 04:21:00,75,The importing of minnows from the USA varies by province. Quebec just enacted some new restrictions. It is now illegal to import minnows - dead or alive - from the USA into that province.

1733769,5richards,2013-05-01 19:28:00,131,Check the regs out for yourselves --- so far the Ontario regs mostly restrict the importation of live bait -- sorry to those that fish in Quebec - I used to fish there until I experienced NW Ontario -- can't compare the resource!
1734497,polaris-pete,2013-05-02 04:02:00,343,I got an email from John ( owner) of the Farm and he said there is no free shipping.I am getting 2 lbs of salted shiners and the shipping is $8.The timeframe for shipping he said is 2-3 days USPS.
1734769,5richards,2013-05-02 06:53:00,131,opps -- double checked - was a fee for shipping -- price was extremely reasonable - sorry
1734777,tv4fish,2013-05-02 06:53:00,2694,Pete: I also checked and I think their prices aren't bad at all and we are going to try a couple of pounds ourselves on Lac Seul this year.
1725161,5richards,2013-04-29 13:15:00,131,"On past trips to Canada I have always ""fretted"" about getting bait for my trip. Since I fly part of the way this has complicated things even more. I usually want to have plenty of salted minnows and a good number of large pike suckers. On my last trip I salted my own minnows and they worked out well. I had difficulty finding the suckers I wanted. Even after a healthy search on the internet I had no success. Getting ready for this years trip I decided to make one last effort to find what I needed for both minnows and suckers -- I fully expected to at least salt my own minnows. I came across a bait company in Maine that is significantly cheaper than me buying my minnows from a wholesale farm and salting them myself including shipping which was free. My order also included 54 - 7 to 9 inch whole salted suckers at a very good price. I have no affiliation with this company but wanted to at least share the fruits of my investigation. Maybe it will help someone else out! The bait company's web is harmonbrookfarm.com. good luck!"
1725505,tooski,2013-04-29 15:36:00,393,"Thanks 5, If things are slow you can always eat the 9 inch suckers, especially since they are already salted. Those are some big mama's....."
1725609,5richards,2013-04-29 16:26:00,131,you are welcome -- Gonna get a lesson from Golden Eagle on Walleye -- hope not thru the ice -- suckers are a back-up -- @200 minnows for $30 can't pass up! good luck on your trip
1725881,polaris-pete,2013-04-29 18:27:00,343,I just got off the phone with this bait dealer. Very nice people. I told him where we were going and what we were fishing for and he called me and explained the differences in the minnows.I will be ordering a few pounds before we leave in June.Thanks for the tip sure beats me having to go and dip my own minnows and do the salt routine.
1726289,Bill Krejca,2013-04-29 20:07:00,6107,"Rather than making a special effort to get my minnows for salting, I just keep what I buy for local fishing and salt those which I haven't used when I get home. I end up with a number of plastic bags, most of which constitute a day's, or half a day's supply. Bill"
1727281,Bigstorm,2013-04-30 07:02:00,799,"Can you take salted/preserved suckers into Canada? I only ask because we bring salted fatheads every year, and one year someone brought salted leeches. When we were asked at the border what we had, they said that we cannot bring salted leeches in, they made us turn around and dump them on the US side. The also asked what type of salted minnows we had, fatheads are OK but i guess some types of salted minnows are not OK."
1727353,tv4fish,2013-04-30 07:32:00,2694,I AM surprised that they made you dump the salted leeches - I think I would have asked them to check their regs.
1727641,5richards,2013-04-30 08:47:00,131,I was checked last time -- opened the cooler with the bait [suckers and minnows] salted and they had no problem.
1727673,ricorth07,2013-04-30 08:58:00,1143,Whats the mailing time frame roughly from this Maine bait shop?Sent from my SCH-R720 using Tapatalk 2
1727929,5richards,2013-04-30 10:04:00,131,I suggest you call the company -- he is salting large suckers for me -- I leave for the opener on the 16th and he said how about by the tenth -- I agreed and he indicated he'd ship them the the ninth -- one to two days for my shipping.
