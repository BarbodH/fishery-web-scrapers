1832265,wallydave,2013-06-03 13:23:00,2151,I heard from Andrea at Goose Bay today. It sounds like the big girls are moving out of the spawning sites. Plenty of over slot walleyes have been caught and released! I'll be at Goose Bay in 12 days! I hope the fishing is still good then!
1838513,teddi,2013-06-05 05:44:00,349,Fishing at evergreen has been very good so far this year. Lots of slot and bigger fish. They are starting to head out to the big lake now so any bay with a creek in is good.
