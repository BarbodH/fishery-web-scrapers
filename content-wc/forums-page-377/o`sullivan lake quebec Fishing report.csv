1702921,Guest,2013-04-22 15:59:00,0,"I just read this post and the thread and could not have had a more different experience. I've been going to O'Sullivan for 20 plus years and I really don't recognize the person you describe as ""Russell"" as the Russell I know. I (we) have found him without exception, extremely accommodating and helpful. He has fixed engine issues, hauled our asses off the Clova Road at 11:00 pm after our trailer spring broke 25 miles away from the camp (and he repaired the trailer that week while I fished and charged only the cost of 2 new springs) and the stories go on and on. You state you caught 220 walleye, 30 Pike and 3 lakers and the fishing was ""okay"". You sound pretty **** hard to please and maybe you busted his props too. He's never ripped me off and I have nothing but good things to say about his operation."
1819561,Randswalleye32,2013-05-29 19:32:00,2,"The guys who are whining about being charged for prop damage and and a few bucks up charge on gasoline are nothing more than cry babies. You did damage.... pay the bill. If you must count every penny on vacation, you cant afford that vacation. I have been to O Sullivan 10 times. Years ago when Ted had it, and about 7-8 times since Russ has it. Since Russell took over, there has been repairs, up grades every year. AND the fishing has actually gotten better. Prior to Russ, there were coolers of fish going home, and no emphisis on slot limit, catch and release, and general up keep. This guardianship makes a difference. Russell has made a positive impact in all aspects, and I am sure he will continue to do so. I am returning in 2013, and look forward to good fishing as in past years. This is my 25th trip to the region, and some years the fishing is better than others. The weather has an impact, and you cant blame that on the outfitter or the lake. At O Sullivan, I know the lake is under a watchful eye, and that gives me the opportunity to enjoy good fishing when I visit.To the complainers out there....please fish somewhere else... sounds to me like all you want to do is fill coolers and go home, as cheap as possible. You may want to consider what it cost to run an operation before you moan and whine."
1819633,MikeG1,2013-05-29 19:45:00,434,Do you realize you are posting to a thread that is quite old?
1819913,Randswalleye32,2013-05-29 20:46:00,2,"the post is old but is always the first one I see when I jump on here. over time it just whizzes me off. Russ is a good guy, and a responsible outfitter."
1822921,MikeG1,2013-05-30 18:30:00,434,"If this si the firstost you see, You are either on here too much, youre getting a kickback from Russ or you have this post bookmarked. I'm on here a lot, I've fished Osullivan, and its sister Lake Stramond, and the only time I see the post is when you bump it. Makes me wonder. Go fish."
1823065,phishfearme,2013-05-30 19:11:00,1242,[QUOTE=Randswalleye32;1819913]the post is old but is always the first one I see when I jump on here. over time it just whizzes me off. so where are your reports? even a year or so late can still be valuable to the group. phish
1823113,trapperbob,2013-05-30 19:22:00,45,"Just to let you know I am strictly a catch and release fisherman. I don't keep coolers of fish and I stand by what I reported. I have been to numerous outfitters in Manitoba ,Ontario and Quebec. I don't post a negative report unless I feel that I was wronged. How many outfitters have you been to that made you sign a form stating you would pay for any damage to a prop? It never happened before or since at any other outfitter. By the way over 19 years of fishing I have never been charged for any damage to anything. Actually money for a good trip is not a problem just when I feel that someone is taking advantage of us."
1325401,trapperbob,2011-07-02 22:09:00,45,You should bring frozen minnows small to medium size. Fish on the bottom either with just a jig head or add a white twister.They sell frozen minnows there for $4.50 a dozen. The minnows worked the best followed by leeches and crawlers. If you can trap or buy your own small minnows and then freeze in little bags. We caught numbers of walleye in smith bay. Try Pike bay for pike and also the north end of lake where river runs into lake for walleye. Don`t forget to fish off the dock. There is a deep channel there and I got my largest walleye off the dock on a white jig and crawler. You should probably pick up some leeches as they do not usually have them. Good luck and watch out for prop ****.
1325422,4Paulie7,2011-07-03 05:13:00,30,"For walleye: Check the map, troll around, find fish and jig. There are just too many spots to start giving specifics. Most evenings, jigs will produce. We prefer 'crawlers. Some swear by leeches. Gulp Alive works, too. Pike: Troll spoons. Red and white seem to be favorite colors. Stickbaits with gold and/or blue work well also. Rockpiles, rocky points and sandy flats can produce. Lake trout: Get lures down to 30' to 50'. We use dipsies. Spoons with red are a good option to start. A small frozen smelt as meat can outproduce undressed lures when they get finicky. Drag through the deep main lake areas. Once again, check the map. Nothing to it."
1325476,Freytown,2011-07-03 08:35:00,770,I think I would add prop touch-up paint to the list of things to bring along to O'Sullivan.
1325740,mkress45,2011-07-04 08:01:00,16,"i would like to thank my fellow fisherman for info about osullivan lake , i will take frozen minnows along from home, my next question is how is the clova rd. we up there 15 yrs ago it was terrible. i will be towing a 19ft.boat. also we do not know this lake at all, should we be concerned about hitting bottom, we would like to buy beer in manawaki anybody know the price for bud-lite & any more feedback as to fishing would be greatley wecomed. we are going to be there 7/12/11. thank you mel."
1326719,trapperbob,2011-07-06 18:36:00,45,Quite a bit of wash boarding in spots. Figure on about 40 mph as your fastest speed with boat. Make sure you have a spare tire and rim for trailer. Last 10 miles into sullivan was just graded.
1327612,bryand,2011-07-08 19:45:00,6,"Take frozen minnows if you can...they are deadly on the walleye. Good old Russell charges $4.50 a dozen. You can go thru 40 or 50 in day when they are biting. Worms work well too. Also if you catch any mullet there, cut one up into strips...the walleye love that too. Last but not least, live leeches also work great."
1327725,emma17,2011-07-09 12:40:00,436,I've never fished w frozen minnows- do you jig them the same as live? I take it the advantage over live is simply the ease of use? Why do we use live minnows at all?
1431090,Guest,2012-05-05 15:07:00,0,hunted and fished there many years. you can call me. 610 258 0326
1431345,octanehi5,2012-05-06 07:40:00,1104,"He does not sound like a very good outfitter no matter where he comes from. also If you can reach a lake by car or truck I have found most of them are over fished.If I'm going to spend a day to get to my fishing vacation I'm going with a fly to only outfitter, I have spent the last 6 yrs. fishing on a lake called Hebert with Air Tamarac, They are one of the best if not the best outfitters in Quebec. The lake is second to none, If we are not catchng 150 walleye's per boat we are having a bad day."
1438525,Guest,2012-05-21 16:59:00,0,Trapperbob how long did it take you to get from117 to Osullivan on the clova rd. Do you know if its decent all the way to clova? Wondering if we could trailer boats all the way to clova any input appreciated. THANKS Kyle870
1322988,trapperbob,2011-06-26 21:50:00,45,"We just got back from our first trip to Osullivan`s lake lodge in Quebec. There are 3 in our party, my son, brother-in-law,and myself. After an 11 hour trip we arrived at the lodge expecting a good fishing trip. We go on a trip to Canada almost every year and have been to goiun res. Lac Berthelot, Kenda lodge and Ganglers in Manitoba. The fishing was good overall not great. Weather was good overall with 1 windy day making it very difficult to fish. We caught about 220 walleye for the week and roughly 60 pike and 3 small lake trout. Largest walleye was 21 inches with several in the 18-20 inch range. We have had better weeks in the past. We did have one surprise, upon arrival with having to sign a form saying we would have to pay for any damage to the props. Never had that happen before. The props appeared new on the old 15 horse Johnsons. The boats were pretty beat but didn`t leak. The cabin was equipped well and had electricity but beat up furniture. Upon checking out The owner presented us with our 2 props saying they were damaged. We expected damage to mean props that were unusable. These had nicks on the blades and sand scratching off the paint. Some filing would have easily taken care of the minor nicks. He charged us $60 dollars for each prop. After paying for them I told Russell that I wanted the props. He was reluctant but gave them to me. Later on further inspection,the props had old damage that was repaired and had been repainted. After being nickled and dimed we left in the AM and will not rebook a trip there. If you go there watch out for the prop scam. He lost further repeat clients for $120."
1322992,lampman,2011-06-26 22:16:00,11,some people are so cheapp...
1323006,gapwedge,2011-06-27 00:21:00,19,"You are a much nicer guy than I am.I would have been fuming at his insistence that I sign anything. I would have told him that this should have been disclosed at the time of booking. What the **** are you supposed to do once you have traveled 11 hours and are there with no boat?Then I would have totally lost it when he sought to charge me for what sure as **** sounds like normal wear and tear. Minor stuff like what you described is covered by the hundreds of dollars he charged you to rent the boat/motor.If you paid by credit card, I would challenge the $120 amount. In the US, it costs the vendor more than $100 to fight a chargeback.But, hey, that's me."
1323018,Shellback,2011-06-27 05:43:00,8083,"I think you one upped him. He probably can't buy a replacement prop for $60.00, so you got your pound of flesh from him. Not only will it cost him more to replace the props, but he has lost at least you as a customer and anyone else that reads this thread. Put the props on Ebay and get some of your cash back."
1323025,Freytown,2011-06-27 06:36:00,770,If I was in your shoe's I would contact the Quebec Outfitters Federation (http://www.pourvoiries.com/) and report your experience. Let them know what happened...maybe you will prevent this from happening to someone else.
1323206,HeHooksHimself,2011-06-27 12:57:00,725,"We have had that issue with a prop as well and if it ever happens again, I will do what you did and demand the damaged prop. One time we knew we clipped a rock and we did not protest, however one time with a Minnesota outfitter (we go to Canada every year now) we got charged for a prop we know we did not damage because we looked. He just claimed it was nicked and held out for the additional $50. We never went back to that camp. I think the biggest scam now is becoming the gas. It is one thing to recover your costs, but 30-40 cents a litre over what they pay for it delivered seems unfair. in addition, if the location of the camp dictates that you are going to use extra gas to get to the fish, the owner should consider that. The fairest treatment we have ever had was from Paul at Woman River Camp. He doesn't nickel and dime you. What he says it will be is what he is."
1323504,Guest,2011-06-28 06:35:00,0,"I used to visit this lake when operated by an American. He was a bit lax on the upkeep but folks loved returning. Since Russell assumed operation, upkeep improved the first few years but lately the boats and motors have pretty much gone to seed and this prop business seems to me a way of having anglers (read: Americans) pay for general upkeep. Any outfitter who doesn't think that there will be some normal wear on props and skegs is kidding themselves. I agree that carelessnes and extensive damage caused by this carelessness is the responsibility of the pepretrator. On the other hand, to nickel and time people who have spent thousands to visit your lake is foolish, bad business and a recipe for future failure. My suggestion: find an outfitter who is committed to customer service and who understands the big picture. (Somehow, when your outfitter is a pleasant guy the fishing reports are generally positive, too.)"
1323715,trapperbob,2011-06-28 15:14:00,45,"Pike223, How was the fishing the last time you were there?"
1323904,Guest,2011-06-29 05:41:00,0,"Actually, the fishing's usually been pretty good. There always seemed to be plenty of eating-size walleye. Some years they ran better than others. We always seemed to catch at least one 20lb class northern and plenty of 10lb + pike and the lake trout at times could be very good, relatively speaking. In fact, if the customer service was a bit more friendly and if the outfitter relaxed a bit on the nickel and diming ""b.s."" we'd probably still be going there. Life's too short and there are plenty of other ""good guys"" out there on plenty of good lakes."
1325119,mkress45,2011-07-02 06:40:00,16,"we are making atrip to osullivan lake 7/12 /11 for the first time, any feedback as to the fishing at that time of the year, we are taking our own boat, what would you tell me about where to fish or what to use, we are from allentown pa. we have been going to the decellies for the past 20 yrs. the fishing there got bad.thank you mel."
