1832585,cuamb,2013-06-03 14:49:00,203,I don't have any recommendations but I will say that the service on the Canadian side can be slow for breakfast. Not sure if they are that busy or they are just not in a rush.We have found some with quick service but way too many where we have spent over an hour waiting for our food.
1832777,JayM5209,2013-06-03 15:48:00,1050,"Shore Lunch Cafe has always been our late breakfast stop on the return trip but it was closed when we pulled in Saturday about 10:30 am. Several trucks in the parking lot made it appear that a remodeling was going on. Hope they reopen.P.S. The walleye fishing was the slowest in 20 years. Pix from our camp's fish house during the previous week point to opening week having been one of the best in 20 years! Appears to have been a fairly local phenomenon. Lake trout fishing was fantastic!! Best in twenty years, both quantity and size (for the two lakes we fish). A 29"", 8.6 lber was my personal best from Cliff Lake."
1833201,bigwalleye1,2013-06-03 17:46:00,2632,"That's surprising. The gal that's been running it for years just finally took over ownership last summer and did a complete remodel on the place. In July 2012 it was the best looking I'd ever seen it. Usually do breakfast on the way up and lunch on the way back. I'll be going thru in 10 days headed up and I'll give a report on my return UPDATE. Just checked Facebook. Apparently they've been undergoing a kitchen remodel. June 1 was the planned reopen date, but it sounds like they're just now getting things back together. Whew! Not gonna miss my hot meatloaf sandwich on the ride home!!!"
1834441,NARDA 1,2013-06-04 06:33:00,636,There was a sporting goods store in International Falls on the west side of rt 53 a few blocks before you turn for the border where I used to get dry ice. Haven't stopped there in a few years because we use electric coolers to keep things frozen now.
1834777,Mara5,2013-06-04 07:47:00,209,As others have said it's hard to beat the Chocolate Moose. Can be a bit of a wait when busy.
1835041,big popi,2013-06-04 08:54:00,635,"Last year my wife & I stopped at the Shorelunch caf√© per recommendations from a Walleye Central thread. Great food and service. My wife doesn't typically like breakfast food, so they cooked her a hamburger. This will be our go to stop from now on. Nothing against the Chocolate Moose, but this was much better. Looking forward to our stop in the middle of July."
1830161,Richard B,2013-06-02 20:28:00,735,Where is a good place to eat breakfast in International Falls/Fort Frances area? Is there anyplace to purchase dry ice in International Falls/Fort Frances area? Thanks
1830193,Terwalleye,2013-06-02 20:39:00,166,"Not sure about breakfast but I know that Border Bob's place advertises dry ice. International Falls; literally, feet from the border. Across street from Duty Free place.http://www.borderbobs.com/aboutus.sc"
1830273,2746,2013-06-02 21:00:00,3206,"Chocolate Moose, south side of Internatrionak Falls as your coming in. Close to the super 8. Then of course there is McDonalds where we usually stop as we are always anxious to get across the border."
1830313,Smallmouth Hunter,2013-06-02 21:13:00,84,I have bought dry ice at Border Bobs. Can't remember price but it kept everything frozen to Indiana. Never have had breakfast on the border either side.
1830514,Da' Walleye Assassun,2013-06-02 23:41:00,358,The Chocalate Moose gets my endorsement for a good breakfast. It's on the east side of the road on the south end of International Falls.
1830618,@Lunker,2013-06-03 03:36:00,835,Wild rice pancakes at Chocolate Moose are highly recommended.
1830658,F250,2013-06-03 04:26:00,75,"The Harbourage Restaurant in Fort Francis is a great place for a real ""big boy"" Canadian breakfast. It is located on Rt. #11 on the east side of town. Rainy Lake Sports is located next to the restaurant. You can get licenses, bait, tackle, maps, and gas there. On the west side of town on Rt. #11 there is a Subway and a Tim Horton's."
1830697,reconssd,2013-06-03 05:18:00,147,Chocolate Moose gets two thumbs up!
1830761,bigwalleye1,2013-06-03 05:52:00,2632,"Shore Lunch Cafe, nice old fashioned breakfast, good service, friendly staff. Pass the chocolate moose and go another mile. Besides, there's a BP on the same side of the street right next door for the final fill."
1831737,Mondo,2013-06-03 10:55:00,61,We have eaten across the border in FF at http://www.rendezvoushotel.com/ Good food and service. Mondo
