1800114,port1042,2013-05-23 06:48:00,509,I'm leaving for Perrault Lake tomorrow morning. Does anyone have any suggestions where we might find some perch on the lake?
1803874,digjig,2013-05-24 09:46:00,146,"On the north side, the end of First Bay (all the way to the east) has some nice weed beds the Perch like to congregate in. To the south, there are a set of 3 fingered bays (hang a hard right going south past whale rock and stick to the left shoreline and you will run right into them). We have had good luck pulling perch from weed beds and under downed pine trees, etc. This time of year downed trees will likely be productive since the weeds have not grown enough for cover. Good Luck! -DJ"

1806826,team walleye,2013-05-25 14:06:00,336,Let us know how you did on Perrault when you get back. I am leaving to go up that way on June 15. What lodge are you staying at?
1827393,port1042,2013-06-01 11:21:00,509,"Returned home from Manotak Lodge on Perrault Lake last night. High winds and rain sent us home a day early, but the rest of the week was great. We had very good fishing. Lots of over sized walleye (over 18"") but we also filled our limits and ate a few. Minnow and jig worked best. 1/8 oz. green worked best for me. Terrific northern fishing. We got a lot of slot fish. My best was 35"" on a St. Croix light rod with 4 pound XL. That took about 15 minutes to get in the boat. CPR'd and she appeared no worse for the wear. Much to my surprise tube baits were driving the northerns nuts. Light colors did the best in either 3"" for 4"" size. I wish I'd a few more Gitzit's in the ""Salt and Pepper"" color. We were fishing pretty shallow and I lost all I had to snags. I love catching northerns and properly filleted they eat as good as walleye. (The lodge knows how to filet them -- I don't!). Smallies were a little slow but we filled our spring limits. In the spring we're only allowed 2 and they must be smaller than 13.8"". Mostly we caught them over that size. The limit increases to 4 and the size limit goes away July 1st. The Ord River was the best place to get walleye but it was very crowed. We chose to fish around the islands and bays pretty much in the southwest end of the lake. Overall we had a great trip and we will be going back for Labor Day week."
