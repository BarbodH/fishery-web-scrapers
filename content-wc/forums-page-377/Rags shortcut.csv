1824953,Pooch,2013-05-31 11:31:00,4619,"Have yet to put a bean in the ground and now it's trying to drown out the corn that was looking pretty good! Much like 1996 for me. Raining as I type this.You done planting or did you give up!??My brain is trying to switch over to fishing, but I'm fighting it for now. Did change oil in the boat yesterday and added a HDS 5 to the front seat position. That did little to scratch the itch.....Pooch"
1816977,Ranger319,2013-05-29 07:24:00,166,Any updates on the Rags? Heading up there soon and curious if one can safely navigate through. Thanks
1817265,rnnonmt,2013-05-29 08:31:00,992,Its the million dollar question each year! We always want to take the shortcut as well. I havent seen any info elswhere yet!
1822873,Ranger319,2013-05-30 18:21:00,166,Anyone been by the Rags yet??
1822929,rnnonmt,2013-05-30 18:30:00,992,When are you going? Weve been using the shortcut for years and there has only been a few times where the water was too low to safely pass. We usually go 2nd week of June and squeeze a 65 footer through there. We have crossed as low as 1168-ish ft elevation on the GPS
1823089,Pooch,2013-05-30 19:16:00,4619,"I hate to prove my ignorance, but what and where is the Rags? I hear folks talk about it every year.Pooch"
1823137,RapShad,2013-05-30 19:24:00,76,It's a shortcut in NE Lac Seul that used to be littered with tree stumps. Still a lot of stumps but only on really down years will it really difficult to get through. Of course you have to know where the path through the stumps is! Judging by the water levels the Rags should be very accessible.
1823257,rnnonmt,2013-05-30 19:54:00,992,Just to poke fun.... Its where all the fisher-woman hang out on Lac Seul. OK now the serious side. Here is a map pic of the rags. In a houseboat doing 8 mph it will save you 40 minutes not having to go around devils elbow. In any other boat 10 minutes.
1823297,rnnonmt,2013-05-30 19:57:00,992,Used to be a little flag pole on the stump at the north end. Usually it was the one that everyone would hit.
1823305,RapShad,2013-05-30 20:00:00,76,I've heard that people have had good luck with muskies in and around the rags especially across the channel in Bearpaw bay. There are also a few good walleye spots in that area.
1823977,Pooch,2013-05-31 06:04:00,4619,Thanks fellows. I've never been that far NE fishing out of Mahkwa.Pooch
