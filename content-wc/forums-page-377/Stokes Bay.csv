The cabins have propane stoves and refrigerators and cold running water. The water is not potable, but can be used if boiled. The furniture is old, but the beds are comfortable and it works for someone that isn't high maintanance. The outhouse was just that, an outhouse, and although a little smelly, it was kept clean. Their was one shower room, and that wasn't fancy either, but it was a hot showe and felt good at the end of the day. Their boats need updating, but if you brought your own boat you should bring it. Most of the water around the bay was 30ft deep or less. We had a few nice walleyes and crappie in this area. In the Canadian channel we were graphing a lot of nice fish about 40 feet deep but we hadn't brough the correct equipment with us to get far down. Their are two rivers that others at the camp had some luck getting a few decent sized Northern Pike with, but we didn't seem to be having any luck. The guide at the camp was a really nice guy and helped out when we had specific questions. The cabins didn't have electricity, but I think he had a generator at the main cabin, so your motor could likely be hooked up to that. My hustband and I had a really good time, we are from NY and it was a really long drive so I don't know if we'd go again anytime in their near future, but definately would if we lived closer."

I was there with a group of 6 in July of 2010. When we got there 1/2 of the seats in our boats were broken. We requested them to be changed with seats from boats that weren't in use and the owner said it would be taken care before morning. We got up early in the AM to hit the water and found the same seats still on the boats, so we changed them ourselves. Dock needed some repair as well as a section was leaning badly and would go under water if 2 people were in the right (wrong) spot. This was the first trip walleye fishing for 4 of the 6, so it took a couple days to get the hang of it. Once we did we managed to catch plenty of fish. The owner was very helpful in pointing out areas and techinques to try. A crawler on a white jig proved to be the best bait. Speed control of the boat was the key, the slower the better. We mostly caught fish in 15-20 fow. The biggest fish we found were in Hale Bay, which was a decent boat ride in the camp boats. There are plenty of good spots close by.Overall I had a great time, but if I were to do it again I would probably stay at Kettle Falls. It would cost a little more but the upgrade in lodging and boats would be well worth the extra coin."

We had a great time at this camp and they were in the process of upgrading everything from boat seats, motors ,dishes ,pots and pans, painting cabins etc.While this type of accomodations is not for everyone, I would recommend this camp to anyone looking for a rustic Canadian experience.The camp manager and the owners are super nice and very eager to make your stay enjoyable."
1474626,camp chef,2012-08-14 07:29:00,915,As usual this time of year I am looking to book next years trips. I came across a sight for Stokes Bay Resort on Rainy lake. It looks interesting in that it is a 20 mile boat in starting in the States and ending in Canada. It looks like an old scool camp with lanterns and outhouses.(charming in it's own right) Does anyone have any first hand info on this Camp? thanks Bryon
1475876,camp chef,2012-08-17 08:58:00,915,Is anyone familiar with the East end of Rainy lake on the Canadian side??
1475878,Hillbiehle,2012-08-17 09:00:00,66,"I do not know much about the area, but I have heard that the fishing is very good in the area. I've wanted to go this place for quite some time. I hope you will share a report upon your return. I typically fish on Namakan just south of there. I wish I could provide more detail, but I'm sure you're going to do very well."
1475898,camp chef,2012-08-17 09:44:00,915,"Thanks ,I will provide a report , where ever we decide to go,and it looks like this place might be right up our alley for this coming spring. For sure it looks like it is off the beaten path.For as close as it is to civilization it it appears to be pretty remote."
1475926,Hillbiehle,2012-08-17 11:24:00,66,"Have you been in this area before? If you're putting in at Crane Lake and taking your own boat..... be prepared that it is a pretty lengthy trip (I'm guess 1.5 hours or so)...particuarly for a 1st timer. Not talking out of going, cause I want to go as well, but just saying...."
1475929,camp chef,2012-08-17 11:47:00,915,Actually we are contemplating putting in at the Ash river access point and plan to follow in the guides from the camp. they said it was about 25 miles as opposed to about 40 miles from Crane Lake. Thanks for the input. Since we have not been there before we appreciate any and all info we can get.
1475950,Hillbiehle,2012-08-17 12:52:00,66,That is good that you're following the guide boats. I can imagine it would be rather overwhelming for someone that is just handed a map. Good luck.
1482302,Guest,2012-09-02 20:40:00,0,Just got home from our trip to the Stokes bay resort. It was overall a great experience. We didn't have a ton of luck catching big fish but spring time might be better. My only advice would be to bring your own boat.
1482315,Rich B,2012-09-02 21:21:00,1081,"Keldoty12, Would you tell us more about the camp, cabins, dockage, fishing areas near the camp, etc ? I looked at the camp's website and it looks like a camp I'd like to visit, though would like more info on the type of water near camp (weedbeds ? large water or islands ?). Were their showers and outdoor toilets clean ? Do they have electric at the docks for charging your boat batteries ? Are you planning on going back to this camp in the future ? Why or why not ? Thanks for the info.....I'm looking for a good Ontario camp I can boat into with my son, that offers good fishing in a remote area and this looks like it might be a good option for us. I appreciate the info. Rich"
