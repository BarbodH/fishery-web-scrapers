507065,Guest,2000-02-11 15:38:00,0,I've been fishing in Marten River for years and had many a successful adventure. It's located 32 miles north of North Bay and is pristine with old growth pines and a multitude of lakes. I've stayed at Marten River Lodge and Beaverland Camp. I highly recommend both of these and the whole area in general.
