Any walleye over 55cm will be counted as a caught fish, but not weighed, what does this mean? How can they count it, if you can't have it in possesion, and can't weigh it in?Thanks,Pikeman"

You can still catch one over 55cm because it is not the law that you can not have it in possesion. But if you try to weigh it in the tournament it will not be counted towards your weight, but will disqualify one of the eligible fish you could have weighed instead. But I do believe if you do bring one to weigh and it is over the 22 inch lower limit and under the 27 and 5/8ths for Tobin you could be charged with an illegal fish in those waters. I hope this helps you, Good luck and great fishin' , Russ"
