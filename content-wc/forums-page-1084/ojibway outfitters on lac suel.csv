Lots of walleyes, all sizes, and the area is a lot more sheltered from the wind than the east end of the lake. To early for muskies but there are lots there in July and August.The camp is a 35 mile boat ride from the landing. The staff are real friendly and helpful. Found the camp a little ""rustic"" and you have to park your boat on the beach, otherwise a good experience."

Up through mid July fish North of the camp. The drive up to Wapezi Bay is worth it. It seems to hold the largest number of ""big"" walleyes, northerns, and muskies in that area. Also off the end of the main lake point you go around to get back to the entrance to Wapezi holds some truly large fish.If you go later in the season(August or later,)fish towards the main lake area. You will find more larger fish near the main lake basin. Each time I've been up there there are always stories to tell at the end of each day. Hard to beat that on a drive/boat in trip. Good luck!"

I've fished it several times and we've always had great fishing. I would recommed planning a future trip into Chamberlin Narrows. August is a great time for this area. Good fishing and warm temps. Wapeci Bay is, without a doubt, one of the best walleye areas I ever fished. It's about 10 miles from the lodge. But, you don't have to travel very far to have quality fishing. 1 mile both directions will get you to excellent fishing. We sat on the dock one day and caught 50 W's 16 to 20 inches."
