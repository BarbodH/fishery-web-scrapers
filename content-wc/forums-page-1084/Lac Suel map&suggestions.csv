506899,Hammer,2000-01-27 14:57:00,12,I will be traveling to Lac Suel on May28 fishing out of Lost Island lodge which is located between Hudson and Sioux lookout. I am interested in obtaining a detailed map of Lac Suel If you would please leave recommendations. Also looking for suggestions on how to fish and be succesfull at this time of year. Thanks in advance.
506900,Gill,2000-01-30 09:15:00,129,Go to the visitors bureau on the south edge of Sioux Lookout. They have maps of the entire region there. Have only fished there in early July and the fish were off the humps. Jigs and minnows.Good luck.

I'm making my first trip to LS July 8 - 15 and I'm really looking forward to it. GILÂ— I've heard most guys tell me they catch most of their fish trolling spinners, do you troll or drift?"

You can't keep live fish in the boat.....and the slot is enforced......but you catch a lot of fish......."
506905,Guest,2000-02-03 09:25:00,0,"Hey KnottyBuoy,What do mean by saying that you can't keep live fish in the boat. I haven't been to Canada for several years. Is this something new? Is this just for Lac Suel?Thanks"
506906,KnottyBuoy,2000-02-03 14:58:00,110,Any fish you keep has to be DEAD......we have a little bat we bop them in the head with .....It is stated in the regs that no person can possess live fish in the boat other than bait....I lined my front live will with 1/2 inch styrofoam and got a block of ice for it each morning....Fastest way to get busted up there is having fish in the slot or live fish in the boat....I think this pertains to Lac Seul only.....we also fish Nestor Falls area on Lake of the Woods and no such reg in place down there...
506902,Guest,2000-02-03 18:38:00,0,"Nate,That is the same time period that we went to Lac Suel. We stayed at Timberlane Lodge close toEar Falls. Walleyes were great. First year 50fish days were common. Second year, last year,we had a hard time to find fish to eat, a lot of slot fish. Not many Northerns. If you are looking for Eyes - great place. We used entirelyjigs and minnow and some leeches.If you are interested in more info, e-mail me.Tight lines"
506907,Guest,2000-02-05 05:46:00,0,"went to minnetoki last june which is 14 mi. south of s. look. and the no live fish law is also in effect there, i think its that way everywhere now. call ur lodge & have them send u a regulation & rules book. we caught alot of 26-29 inch eyes, not many northerns. best bait orange jig & leeches & drift. good luck."
506903,Guest,2000-02-07 11:27:00,0,"We'll be staying at Scout Lake Resort, which is a little further east from Ear Falls. We wanted to get away from all the cluster of resorts around Ear Falls. I've heard good things about McKenzie Bay which will also be closer than if we'd stayed in Ear Falls. Plus, because we're on Scout Lake, which is connected to Lac Seul, if weatrher gets bad we can still fish the smaller lake and not worry about being caught on the big lake. We're all stocking up on jigs and one of these night I'm going to have a spinner-tying party. (Buncha guys making a buncha spinners while drinking a buncha beer!) You gotta pas the winter months somehow."
