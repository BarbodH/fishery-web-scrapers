507130,Walleye-guy,2000-02-16 20:32:00,15,I am going to Lake of the Woods during the last part of may/first part of June. I have put tons of messages on here and haven't gotten much feedback. I think it is because there is the PWT event on the lake that week and people are reluctant to share information. Does anyone have any suggestions as to any other websites where I could find some info on this part of the lake? (Sioux Narrows--whitefish bay)Thank you.

We did great on Whitefish Bay on reefs 5-35' deep.Used bouncer w/ spinner and crawler. From everything else I've heard it sounds like Yellow Girl, Snake and the bays east of the Sioux Narrows bridge are the best places for that(early) time of year. I'm sure Whitefish Bay will hold fish somewhere, but everyone I talk to says it's tough, not as many fish but big ones! I know if I make it up in June I'll be out there! Minnows will no doubt be the way to go. I suggest stopping at the first sport shop in Nestor Falls. They have a great selection, friendly people and the minnows will last-they are tough!http://www.township.siouxnarrows.on.ca/This site will give you some info on the area. If you have any other questions just post and I will try to answer. Good Luck."

Unfortunately, I cannot remember the names. One was straight north where Whitefish bay enters into Long bay. The other was to the north of Yellowgirl bay, this one was stacked with eyes. We didn't catch big ones here but there were numbers of 2 pounders. The big ones were caught on the humps of Yellowgirl. We used 3 ft snells with gold hammered spinners. Red daredevil spinners worked well in the river north of yellowgirl. minnows or leeches. I liked the small baitshack on the right side of the road when you enter Sioux Narrows. Its owned by a fishing guide so you know he takes good care of his bait. Wish I was coming up too but now I have 2 young children...see you up there in about 10 yrs."
