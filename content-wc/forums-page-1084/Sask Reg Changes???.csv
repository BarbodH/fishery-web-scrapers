507135,Guest,2000-02-18 00:06:00,0,Have the Regs changed in Sask or just at Tobin? The premiers cup and 55 cm fish is this a tournament rule or a sask reg? How about the vanity will they be following the same format?If this is a Sask reg does it affect Diefenbaker as well?Thanks Jeff
507136,Guest,2000-02-18 07:28:00,0,"Jeff, as of now we are not sure what if any regulation changes are being made for 2000 in Sask. Last year while I was attending the Vanity there was talk of a nofish over slot in the river at Nipawin. I think the Premiers cup is experimenting with the no fish over 55cm to see if it will still fly. Only thing I have heard about the Vanity (and it could be false) is that they are going to 1 fish over the 55 to 70 per day and that fish will have to be in excess of 80cm (31.5""). That is all the info I have to date but will keep the board informed as new regs are available and released to the public.Good fishin' Russ"
