507028,Tyee,2000-02-07 20:42:00,60,"Am looking for a lodge or resort where I canspend a week in early June with my 15 year old son, and get into some good multi-species fishing. Could be either American Plan or Housekeeping, and would prefer a drive-in or boat-in. My son loves to catch Northern Pike (bigger the better) and I love Walleye, and we both enjoy S.M. Bass.I've taken my son to the North Channel (N.E.corner of the Georgian Bay) as well as theFrench River and several lodges on Georgian Bayover the last few years. Only did fair on the fishing as we went mid summer.Looking for a good, clean lodge that offers achance for a week of decent fishing...I'm lookingover the websites for the greater Sault Ste. Marie area as well as the greater North Bay area;and they all look good.Any suggestions would be appreciated. We do mostly ""C&R"", with keeping a few smaller fish for a shore lunch during the week.Seems most of the best waters are north ofInternational Falls, but we're from mid-centralOhio; and that's every bit of a hard two daydrive (especially pulling a boat). Looking fora lodge that I can drive to within a good day'sdrive.I know the above was a longer post, but if anyonehas a suggestion or two, please post it or email me....and yes, we do fish Lake Erie, but enjoy the ""north country"" and would like to get on a lake that offers good fishing, and a nice clean lodge."
