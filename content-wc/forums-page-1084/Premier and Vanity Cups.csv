I also heard that the Vanity will have the same rules as last year with the exception of only 1 fish over 80 cm. That is 31.5"". I guess that the river is in worse shape than we first thought. If any one has more on these subect events let me know. Thanks, Russ"

I have been told that the one fish over 80 cm is a proposal for making the slot size larger so less fish are kept and more of them can spawn. I don't know what the official rules for the Vanity Cup will be, but they will have to conform to Saskatchewan's fishing regulations, if there are any changes to them. Hope this helps. Chris"
