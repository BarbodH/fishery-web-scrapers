Anyhow, I 've been busy building new home and getting ready for babies(reason for bigger home), but I will get it out shortly. I am taking next week off to go fishing! Kid is off school and it's perfect for me to get away to Hayward. I'll have to get a small map of LOTW so I can mark a few spots. I didn't want you to think I riped you off!! I think you'll love the place and the area. Am hoping to get a few groups like you to come back every year. Take care. DLHOMES"
