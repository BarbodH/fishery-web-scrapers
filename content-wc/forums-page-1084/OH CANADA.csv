We narrowed our choices to LOW, Eagle Lake, Lac Seul.We will be targeting Walleye and Pikes, probably in early June. Any comments or input on which may be the best choice would be appreciated.Thanks in advanceJN"

Last year while were were there we had a 50+in. muskie up to the side of the boat - but he got away.If you are interested in general info about Eagle Lake and travelling to Canada check out my website at:http://wwa.com/~rmryan/Eagle_Lake/eagle_lake.htmlI'm sure the other lakes you mentioned are great also, haven't tried them myself.Rick"

We stay at a place that is just out of Sioux Narrows- this area has clearer water than the Sabsakong Bay area. Cabin has 3 bdrms, shower, full kitchen and a deck and screen room. Rent is under $400 for a week! Last time I fished it we brought 2- 27"", and 1- 28"" walleyes in, in fact we had a hard time catching fish under 18""!(you can only keep 1 over 18""). If your interested you can try e-mail but the best bet is to post here. Good luck!"
