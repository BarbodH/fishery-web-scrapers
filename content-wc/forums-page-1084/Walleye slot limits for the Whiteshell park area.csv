It is completely opposite of last years regulations.I guess I'd better get a smaller frypan!"
507128,River_eye,2000-02-16 16:35:00,1486,"Yeah, I saw that too. That 38 cm works out to just over 15 inches. Before it was nothing under 14, now it's going to be nothing over 15. I can understand them protecting the bigger fish, but in my opinion, 15 inches is a bit small.[font size=""2"" color=""#FF0000""]River eye[/font]"
