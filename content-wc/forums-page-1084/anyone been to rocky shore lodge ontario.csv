507062,Guest,2000-02-13 11:45:00,0,"Fished Perault Lake several years ago. OK for smallies, Pike were small, walleyes hard to find. Too many lodges, Too close to road, Too much pressure, just my opinion......I am prejudice because I own a lodge just a north of there on Confederation lake..South Bay Lodge, we are the only lodge fishing on this unspoiled lake and we boat-in 3 miles so we are protected from the outside world, Take a look at <http://www.southbaylodge.com> roger"
