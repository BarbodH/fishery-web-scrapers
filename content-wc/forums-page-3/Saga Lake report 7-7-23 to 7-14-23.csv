6751579,andreindy,2023-07-22 10:34:00,308,"My group of 5 fished Saga Lake, a fly-in outpost lake of Twin Lakes Outfitters from 7/7/23 until 7/14/23. Saga Lake is north of Nakina and was a reasonably short ride from the airbase at Cordingly Lake. This was our 4th Canada fly-in experience for 4 of us and we had 1 person who had never been to Canada before. We had never been to Saga. It is a smaller lake and is part of the Kapikotwonga River system. Our only other fly-in experience had been Abamasagi Lake further south. I had little information on Saga going in but had spent some time over the winter and spring doing on-line reconnaissance with several helpful websites. (Thank you to Adam Dempsey on this site for creating posts that list these references). Sites like Bing Maps and in particular GPS Visualizer (picture attached of the site) with its access to ArcGIS maps gave me new clear satellite views beyond Apple Maps and Google Maps. I was able to mark spots of interest, obtain GPS coordinates from the satellite images and then upload these coordinates into our portable Hummingbird locators. Is this necessary? No. But it certainly helps with my group to have a handful of starting exploration points and I find it super fun. We used portable Helix 5s and yes, I had a portable Helix 9 set-up with side imaging (guilty and not necessary luxury but I love the Helix 5s too). Fishing Summary: Overall, it was a challenge for our group for the week. We ran two boats. My boat was the most successful. The other boat would have whole days where they would catch a very small handful of fish or almost none at all. I attribute this to a few things, but first and foremost was likely our inexperience in adapting to this kind of body of water and our inexperience in adapting to a major cold front condition that occurred Day 1 and progressed through the week. This week would see high air temps of high 50's, low 60s and temps in the high 40s at night. We saw the surface water temp on the first day go from 74 degrees F to 66 degrees in a day or so. Consistent wind. This is generally a shallow body of water (the majority of the lake is 10 feet or less when we were there. In fact, the majority of the lake basin is 8 feet or less). I would find two notable deep holes in the lake that would be between 20 and almost 30 feet. I rarely marked any fish in these holes. We worked these edges of these holes with jigs, trolling spinner rigs. We tried to slow the wind drift to see if we could slowly drag things down the edge, through it and back up it. Rarely had success. We did find success though fishing the shoreline in the evening that is just adjacent to this deep hole as it was relatively close to the shoreline. We had a lot of challenges in the lake finding active fish or fish holding locations with the experience we possessed. I took joy in mapping contours while I explored. Considering the weather changes, my brain worked to recollect reasonable strategy changes with a cold front. I downsized the size of my bait. (Smaller plastics...more 3"", smaller cranks for trolling). I tried to slow our presentations (lighter jigs for slower drops). And changing what we used. Live bait (crawlers) and using the live bait made a big, big difference for us (more on that below). I really felt pretty lost on a lake system like this. The lake did have a slow, meandering current due to the river. And I would work to find areas where it would seem that current would be used by walleyes for feeding purposes. Ultimately, the greatest success in my boat and where 95% of the walleye caught were in 2 very specific locations (at the inlet of the river into Saga. In 4-5 feet of water and fairly fast current. I would harken back to my trout stream fishing youth and had to teach the group how to fish a current and drift. this required finding the right size light jig. Too heavy and it would snag bottom rocks and not be pushed by the current. Too light of an offering and the jig would be blown down stream without getting down at all. Once you got it right, we were catching lots of walleyes (majority between 17 and 20 inches amazingly) and fighting walleyes in current was a blast in these small, narrow areas. Other than the inlet area above, the only other major producing area was a narrowed stretch of river past the river outlet that was rock/rubble, had defined current seams. We discovered this location because I worked to do very controlled boat drifts while he casted a blade bait in the river. He got 3-4 walleye on consecutive casts and we found a way to anchor in the middle of this river area and then work it more thoroughly. We had a big learning here. Casting blade baits in this location would catch walleye. But when the bite slowed, we fished jigs trout stream style with paddle tails and twister tails. We would catch MANY that way. But when we thought we had ""caught them all"" with the jig and plastic, I switched to a fireball jig and nightcrawler on a whim and then caught 50 more from that very small area in a very short period of time that repeatedly had passed on countless casts with the other baits over their heads. It was a real eye opener about experimenting and switching techniques and baits. The night crawler outfished everything by a very, very large margin in that instance. I would find a few deep holes in the river (25-30ft) that I lacked the skill, boat control and experience to fish effectively. Overall, it was a fun, challenging and lesson-learning trip. We had bursts of activity in my boat as mentioned above. We were challenged. I know the other boat had long periods and days of discouragement. We worked to collaborate between us. Side note: biggest walleye was 21.5"" and the most golden color. Pike 33.5"". Quite a few bonus jumbo perch up to 12.5""."

6751587,prov1800,2023-07-22 11:19:00,5010,Most fisherman over look weeds.But some weedlees jigs and some weedles hooks.Drop shot the weedless hooks you will be surprised.
6751609,andreindy,2023-07-22 13:05:00,308,"Eckholt and PROV1800, good observation about the weeds. There were scattered seedbeds. In some cases there were large flats around 4 feet or less where there was thin/sparse weeds, but not what I would say were thick weeds. When we would fish in there (we tried slip bobbing in there actually when we had some moments when the wind was calm) we would catch jumbo perch. There was a big neckdown between the upper and lower lake that had really thick weeds but that area was 3 feet or less. And you are right, it did not occur to me to fish that. I guess my question is if you did find weeds or weed edges, how would you fish them effectively? With the wind (and no trolling motor of course), really determining your drift or ability to stay stationary, how would you have done it? Try to anchor and cast weedless jigs? Slip bobber like we did? I think if we couldn't figure out how to do it right, the fellas (and the new guy) would have been pretty frustrated snagging on weeds. Regardless, I should have tried it. Thanks for the insight."
6751615,prov1800,2023-07-22 13:54:00,5010,Learned to fish on small lakes backing up with a tiller.We were constantly in reverse if weather/wind allowed it or go to other side where it was calmer.Wouks troll shorelines and points and when we caught one would stop and jig.I hated trolling and still do.Would find weed beds by sight and fish them jigging No electronics back then so hard to find structure in the main lake.Lakes we fished were small like flyouts which we cut trails into.They were usually fantastic.Now when I go to a outpost lake I bring my portable sonar/gps and really get to scope the lake out so now it's much easier fishing.Finding deep weeds would be the ticket the ones in 10-20 ft are like gold mines.

6751751,Old Timer,2023-07-23 09:44:00,255,"Eck: There are two big border lakes that most guys drive past on their trips further north. Both are good. We had stable weather and light winds. Good moon phase too. We figured the big fish had just arrived in the bigger water while the smaller ones were still in the shallows. Yes, a very weird catching experience. A first for me, and maybe last. But without an assortment of bait it would have never occurred. Rubber produced nothing. By the way, my companion reminded me that we did catch several 23s and 24s, but we mostly shook those off by the side of the boat. Caught only one real toad. Too old to know how to post pics, but they were all"
6751759,Eckohlt,2023-07-23 09:58:00,3685,"Thanks old timer,that's some great fishing for sure."
6751873,andreindy,2023-07-23 18:07:00,308,"The boats are standard Naden or Lund 14' camp boats with 9.9 Mercury 4 strokes. They all usually show considerable use and wear but get the job done. The Saga cabin is rustic, but has stove and fridge run from propane. Water into cabin from lake from pump powered by solar battery. There is a solar panel that charges some 12V batteries with an inverted to allow for plug in charging. (However, I will not trust my charging needs to that ever again). Some camps have a generator on site. Be sure to ask."
6752331,gordy28,2023-07-26 10:52:00,437,Thanks for sharing. Trip reports like these are awesome!Andrew
6751647,Old Timer,2023-07-22 18:20:00,255,"Thanks for your detailed report. One thing, though, that came to mind. Regardless of what you read on this forum, Ive always sung the importance of live or salted bait. Even if committed to rubber, I believe travelers should spend the extra dough and buy good bait as an insurance policy. If you throw them away, so what? It might save your trip. This was my 74th year fishing Canada. Yeah, diapers at first and I don't remember much, but I was there. But as long as I can remember, I've fished with bait. I've tried rubber repeatedly, but it's never come close to producing numbers except on a few rare occasions. This includes dozens of fly-ins. I've chirped up before on this forum about bait. On all my fly-ins I've taken some crawlers and a lot of salted minnows. The salts don't look like much, but they'll produce nearly as well as live ones. By the end of the trip they may be skulls and ribs, but they still work fine. By way of example, I've caught many 28-31 fish at Larus on nothing more than shriveled salts. There's a poster here who has a better salting recipe than what I've ever used. Here's a recent story. Last month two of us were on a large drive-in border lake. We bought $100 worth of large chubs, tiny leaches (all they had) and a couple dozen crawlers. The weather was perfect and for the 2.5 days we fished, the size was exceptional. We caught between 90-100 walleyes.Two were 18, two were 22 and the rest were between 25 and 30.75. Minnows were good, leaches better and crawlers slow. Now here's what's interesting. A local Canadian friend of ours and a part-time guide jumped into our boat for one morning. He brought along jigs and a pocket box of assorted rubber. That's what he intended to use. He couldn't buy a fish not one fish while the two of us had boated a couple dozen by then and several 27s and 28s. He finally relented and his first fish on a chub was a 27 incher. He tried rubber again with no luck. So back to bait and he was catching fish again. But had he gone on his own that morning with only rubber he would have reported terrible fishing. I've never had consistent size like this before. But I've been on many remote trips where a companion or two insisted on using rubber and had poor success until switching over. I know others will argue with me until the cows come home, which is fine. But it makes little sense to risk an expensive trip by not bringing bait."
6751657,Eckohlt,2023-07-22 19:29:00,3685,"Old timer,I think I got this about right,you fished 2.5 days and let's say out of those 90 fish 86 of them were between 25 and 30.75 inches were these walleyes??and if so where the heck were you fishing if I may ask??"
6751659,prov1800,2023-07-22 19:34:00,5010,Thx for doing the math Eck.Waiting for a answer
6751663,RichA$1970,2023-07-22 20:37:00,1158,"Good trip report and thanks for sharing. Their prices seem very good in Nakina. How was the cabin, amenities and any other pros/cons?"
6751673,Eckohlt,2023-07-23 03:43:00,3685,"The math was the easy part,lol in my life time I've never caught fish like that,I'm not sure if any other WC member has either and if they had I'd like to hear about it,and which lake."
