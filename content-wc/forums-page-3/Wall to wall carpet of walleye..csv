6751279,Eckohlt,2023-07-20 14:55:00,3685,"I like to catch mayflies n use for bait,that's the real deal."
6751357,JDP,2023-07-21 06:29:00,1457,Keep the videos coming Simon! Thanks for sharing.
6751389,Ltrain,2023-07-21 08:42:00,4145,"Just to comment on the video- since you weren't moving your arches were stretched out and the hatch made the return "" fuzzy"" for lack of a better term. If you were moving at trolling speed you would have arches mixed into blotches of hatch. I'll post a pic of stretched arches sitting still with no hatch and arches mixed among a bug hatch"
6751391,Steve Comerford,2023-07-21 08:43:00,28,"Thanks a million....I'll try that. Just get the half crawler to the bottom underneath the mayflys, and move it very slowly if I'm understanding your technique."
6751435,Eckohlt,2023-07-21 12:27:00,3685,"Another thing you can do is avoid the mayfly hatch with your dates,if that's possible?"
6751445,Ltrain,2023-07-21 12:52:00,4145,That's probably the best advice right there.....although it's different in every lake most smaller lakes it will just shut down the bite. I was on Mille lacs before where there was 3 simultaneous bug hatches and we still caught 40 a day. But that is an exception- on most lakes those fish are so stuffed with bugs they won't chase a bait.
6751569,Limeyangler,2023-07-22 09:28:00,563,"Those are 100% walleye on the graph, I’ve seen bass and crappie like this too, I know because if you drop your jig in the transducer cone you can watch the same marks come after your jig signal, even when there is not a hatch in progress. There is another hatch in progress atm on Wabigoon, and my graph is showing your picture on the right and there are no arches anywhere to be seen, this is where the jig/transducer trick comes from n handy again because you can drop your jig to the bottom, watch the signal as you raise your jig and a lot of the time a fish arch will appear from the bottom and chase, good way to determine if the reason you are not marking fish is because they are too tight to the bottom to be seen on the graph."
6751581,Ltrain,2023-07-22 10:58:00,4145,I never said they weren't walleye im saying the marks are stretched out because you weren't moving.
6751605,Limeyangler,2023-07-22 12:43:00,563,"I already know this, and never alluded to not knowing what fish signals look like moving or stationary, so guess I was just confused by your reply."
6746617,Limeyangler,2023-06-25 21:21:00,563,"The walleye were gorging fish flies on the mud flat, was like a carpet of walleye down there, all the same size 16-18ers, but fun catching em non stop.https://youtu.be/2pgOtaLtj9c"
6746689,reddemon2,2023-06-26 07:17:00,255,dumbest video i've ever watched
6746691,v-bay gord,2023-06-26 07:27:00,3168,I guess you didn't appreciate the plot and character development.....never mind the outstanding visuals. ....it was a shag carpet of walleye....very nice!
6746821,Pooch,2023-06-26 17:23:00,4618,"Your screen looked much like ours last year fishing the western end of LS. When the screen lit up like that, the fishing was over for the day. Tried everything suggested here on a recent post concerning May flies to only get skunked.Over the years this has happened to us several times, all in this same time frame. Just happened to hit the peak of the hatch.Not a dumb video at all. Just shows what's happening when the hatch is on and fish are gorging themselves on Mayflies.Pooch"
6747883,Limeyangler,2023-07-01 12:53:00,563,Lol tell us how you really feel.
6747901,Walleye2242,2023-07-01 14:34:00,263,Have you seen the posts he makes...i wouldnt worry about it.....not that you would be!
6747909,Limeyangler,2023-07-01 15:21:00,563,"[QUOTE=Walleye2242;6747901]Have you seen the posts he makes...i wouldnt worry about it.....not that you would be![ Not bothered, amused would more describe my reaction."
6751231,Steve Comerford,2023-07-20 10:28:00,28,"This brings up a darn good question.........how come SOME guys have great fishing during a mayfly hatch, but MOST guys have terrible fishing???? (since I'm in the MOST category I really need an answer)."
6751235,Rufous Potoo,2023-07-20 11:34:00,101,"I've caught a gazillion walleyes during mayfly hatches with a sinker, a plain hook and inch and a half of nightcrawler. You can also use plain smells behind a bouncer and a small hunk of crawler. Good luck"
6751243,Steve Comerford,2023-07-20 12:00:00,28,"Rufous, do you cast it right into the mayflies? Let it sink to the bottom? How big a sinker?"
