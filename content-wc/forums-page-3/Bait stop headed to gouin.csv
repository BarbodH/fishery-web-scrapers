We will be crossing the border in Newport vt and taking rte 55 up thru trois rivers and then 155 to la tuque. This is our 1st time since they banned bringing crawlers cross the border. Thanks.

It burned down last year so we got our crawlers from a Canadian Tire. You can get your crawlers from any Canadian tire on the way up. They had containers of 40. Lively and worked great.
6750923,Kman67rsss,2023-07-18 19:55:00,30,Thank you. Dumb question but Canadian tire isn’t a membership type place like a Sam’s club or Costco is it?
6750965,vteye3,2023-07-19 06:07:00,496,"Nope Canadian Tire is more like a combo: Walmart, Lowes, Tire outlet There are numerous places that sell crawlers heading up there. You will see crawlers being sold out of homes its common."

6751001,Kman67rsss,2023-07-19 07:06:00,30,Thanks. I knew about Tim hortens. We have always brought our worms from home so have never had to look. Haven’t been in 4 years due to the border being closed and then there was no availability last year. Thanks and enjoy your trip.
