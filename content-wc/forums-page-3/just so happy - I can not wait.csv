6751175,Spartan1,2023-07-20 05:46:00,46,Best of luck on your trip. We went through two weeks ago and waited about 10-15 min on the Canadian side and 15 or less on the U.S. side. Very easy. Your experience may vary however depending upon what time you hit the border. Going up to Canada we crossed the border around 8:00 AM and coming back it was around noon. No need for ArriveCan and passports seemed to work better than the enhanced license. Both worked but the officer at the border preferred the passport. Probably was just his personal preference.

6749623,KSjim,2023-07-11 18:09:00,88,Our group just got back from a Manitoba outpost fishing trip that we had missed for last few years as well. Nice to get back to Canada. Trust you have a great trip.
6749739,MrSimon,2023-07-12 08:25:00,922,I hear you man. It's been a few years for my group as well. We leave in a few weeks and it feels really really good!
6749781,farmnfish,2023-07-12 12:35:00,130,"can't stop thinking about it. Been through the tackle box a half dozen times already, checking fer stuff. Sharpened the fillet knife several times. Counting the days. Need to check the supply of cigars."
6749783,Eckohlt,2023-07-12 12:41:00,3685,Which lake you headed to farm??
6749787,farmnfish,2023-07-12 12:44:00,130,"Biggs lake with air ivanhoe, never been to that lake, so if anyone wants to share a waypoint or 2 that would be great. A search here doesn't turn up much for that spot though."
6749807,kim n indiana,2023-07-12 14:31:00,62,"if you can get the old man to fly you in, he knows all the hot spots in every lake.also, at the desk is folder with marked hot spots on every lake. and every lake will have 20+ marked up maps. look at that folder...!!!!"
6749811,farmnfish,2023-07-12 15:04:00,130,"thanks kim, is george still flying? We haven't used Air Ivanhoe for probably 20 years, but this year we're getting the band back together for maybe our last flyin. Flew with John back in the day, then later with george. That was even before the lodge was built. I think George and Johns father even flew us one time."
6749813,kim n indiana,2023-07-12 15:18:00,62,George picked us up last year and flew us out. so he is still helping out. or was is 2022.
6750887,farmnfish,2023-07-18 15:43:00,130,"George told my nephew a couple days ago that they just put in starlink at the lake we are going to. In general, I think that's a good thing. I can see how some would feel it would take away from the fly-in experience. Alleviates some older peoples fear of health issues coming up though, and may make it easier to take the youngsters along."
