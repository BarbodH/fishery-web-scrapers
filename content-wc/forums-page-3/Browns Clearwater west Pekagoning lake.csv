6751247,Steve Comerford,2023-07-20 12:25:00,28,This was the first Canada lake I fished decades ago. I was bursting with anticipation. Flew to it via Rusty Myers in late May. The guys that took me were clueless. We trolled aimlessly for lakers. Disappointing doesn't begin to describe the situation. But if you are a good fisherman I'm sure you'll do fine.
