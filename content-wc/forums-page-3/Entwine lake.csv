The boat has to have a full operable kitchen, bathroom, etc.....so accomadations for living on. I believe i have this correct Now, do i wish it was different......YES....LOL Cheers"

6751623,jbohne,2023-07-22 15:41:00,6,Does anyone have any experience up at this outpost with Canadian fly in outposts? We are thinking of going up late may into early june. Looks like a great cabin with multi species.Any info on the lake or outfitter would be great! Have already a searched this forum and others and can’t find much. Thanks!
6751631,Filthy oar,2023-07-22 16:08:00,8,"We moose hunted there in 2021, jay is a great guy and runs a top notch camp, he built a new camp on south end of entwine this last winter we stay on the northwest end when we stayed there. Lots of deep water and good lake trout fishing. I didnt fish alot but did manage to catch a few northerns and walleye in between sits. The cabin we stayed in is very nice, flush toilets , solar with generator backup wood heat but he also has a electric heater a/c combo in there too i believe. All in all jay is a great host and will do everything to make your stay a great one. This is one we caught back on by the ""kitchen"" , a side slough u can get to by dragging boat over a beaver dam."
6751641,Eckohlt,2023-07-22 17:43:00,3685,"Must be a road nearby because there's a big pontoon tied to the dock,and I'm sure a floatplane didn't haul it there."
6751645,Filthy oar,2023-07-22 17:50:00,8,"Trout rd off of 502 is several miles to the northeast, there are some old grown over clearcuts up there we hunted, but jay brought the pontoons in one piece at a time,, has one on upper frypan too i believe"
6751655,Eckohlt,2023-07-22 19:22:00,3685,"That's interesting,I've never heard of building a pontoon on shore at a lake."
6751711,Bill Krejca,2023-07-23 07:20:00,6107,"A maybe surprising number of outpost additions is brought in in many cases by cabin owners using over-the-ice equipment. Places which seem inaccessible may be otherwise when the water freezes. Can't imagine pulling a pontoon, tho. Bill"
6751715,Eckohlt,2023-07-23 07:26:00,3685,"Wonder what the Ontario law is about drinking beer on a pontoon,I'm sure it's a no no for the driver,but passengers??"
6751717,Filthy oar,2023-07-23 07:30:00,8,"Keep in mind guys, these arent bennington or manitou pontoons,, lol. Simple tubes, frame and some plywood,,, yes he hauls it all in in the winter,"
6751719,jbohne,2023-07-23 07:31:00,6,Thanks for this! That’s a big pike. great to hear Jay runs a good operation. He has a been great talking to so far.
6751723,Eckohlt,2023-07-23 07:38:00,3685,"By the looks of the pontoon at Entwine lake it's not a real cheap pontoon,no plywood sides by the looks."
