6751423,Wallychowder,2023-07-21 11:15:00,1567,Can't believe they didn't ask about Crawlers !.........Lol.
6751427,Knutson21,2023-07-21 11:19:00,348,"I agree I don't think it has to be notirized. I do get mine notorized because we have about 10 of them in our office. If we did't I don't think I would seek one out. I also don't provide the letter to the customs officer until it is asked for. I have crossed with my sone 4 times since 2019 and the first two times not asked, the last two times I was asked for it."
6751433,CI_Guy,2023-07-21 12:21:00,2118,A few years ago the border agent told my son that the note didn't have to be notarized for my grandson. It does have to contain multiple ways to contact the other parent though.
6751443,combine_billy,2023-07-21 12:51:00,151,"In missouri if you get a plate over 18k they don't give you a rear plate. The border people are well aware of this, they just like to ask it anyway."
6751087,papadave,2023-07-19 15:14:00,151,"I have been reading the Canadian Customs website and either I don't understand what I'm reading or they have gotten really particular since I last went through customs a few years ago. My wife, granddaughter and I are going to Ontario for two weeks in August for a housekeeping stay at a remote location. Do I have to make a declaration list with every single food item, the weight and value? That's a fairly large list with three people for two weeks. Or is it best just to plan on buying almost everything after crossing the border? Any help or suggestions from you more experienced folks is much appreciated so I won't screw this up and end up sitting in inspection for hours."
6751095,Lovetofish,2023-07-19 15:34:00,458,"Hand the agent your passports and birth certificate for the grandkid. They will ask you where you are from, where you are going, any booze, any live or dead bait, any cannabis. If a minor child you need a letter of permission from the parents. It's pretty simple."
6751101,NETim1187,2023-07-19 16:08:00,166,Firearms too! Be sure you don't have anything firearms related in your rig too. Even an empty fired brass case is enough to get them all kinds of excited should they do a search of your vehicle.
6751103,Eckohlt,2023-07-19 16:52:00,3685,"Lovetofish is spot on,very simple."
6751143,Spurgery,2023-07-19 20:46:00,79,"Don’t sweat it. It’s a piece of cake. You certainly do not have to declare every food item you bring. They only ask about alcohol, tobacco, weapons, and live bait."
6751147,N_of_Quibell,2023-07-19 21:26:00,151,"They will ask you if you plan to leave/sell anything in Canada. I always bring all of my own food, which I will either eat or take back home, so the answer is no. As long as I didn't have stuff that was banned at the time (i.e., potatoes), I have the impression they didn't care about my food. It's pretty darn easy, and in >30 crossings I can't think of one bad experience. Unless I need to check guns, I plan on 5 minutes or less."
6751225,combine_billy,2023-07-20 10:13:00,151,"I just went across last Saturday with four in my truck. They asked four questions, where i was going, if i had any guns, if i had any bow and arrows, and if i had any traps. Easiest crossing ever. And I ALWAYS get asked why i don't have a license plate on the back of my truck and they didn't even ask that."
6751385,proguidedream,2023-07-21 08:35:00,345,cant imagine there is a great reason to not have a license plate ? seems like a good way for an excuse to get pulled over in any state or province.
6751409,LittleBait,2023-07-21 10:22:00,37,Notary required on the letter
6751419,farmnfish,2023-07-21 11:03:00,130,"I don't think it needs to be notorized.https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration...ng-canada.htmlIf a minor child is travelling with a person other than their parents or legal guardian The adult who is not the parent or legal guardian of the child should have written permission from the parents or guardians to supervise the child. The permission letter should include addresses and telephone numbers where the parents or legal guardian can be reached. The letter does not need to be certified. A photocopy of the parents' or legal guardian's signed passports or national identity cards should be attached to the letter.Note: The border services officer may not ask to see these documents when the child enters Canada. However, it is strongly recommended you bring them, in case that you are. The minor child will not be admitted to Canada if the officer is not convinced that the parents or legal guardian have authorized their stay."
