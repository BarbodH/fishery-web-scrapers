We caught 100's if not a 1000 walleye with a lot over 20 but our biggest was just 25 inches and that was the first fish caught of the trip. We also fished muskies pretty hard every morning for 4 hours or so, caught a few and saw several others. The wind handcuffed a few days on some of our favorite muskies spots. Our biggest was low to mid 40's. Border crossing was a breeze although we did not realize the crossing didn't open until 8am as we showed up at 7:45!"
