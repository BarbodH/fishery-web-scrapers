6749785,farmnfish,2023-07-12 12:41:00,130,"3rd week in may. Fished with snow falling before, but the weather is usually pretty good. Honestly I'd rather be a little cold that covered with mosquitos so its okay with me. One year we showed up at the outfitters place torward the end of May to see the lake he flys out of still covered with ice. Sat there for a few days, a bit pizzed off that he hadn't called us and canceled, before we gave up waiting for the thaw and went home."
6749789,Eckohlt,2023-07-12 12:48:00,3685,"That's a big bummer,I don't think I would use that outfitter again after that nightmare!"
6749819,kim n indiana,2023-07-12 16:22:00,62,That's why i like to go late august. bugs are mostly gone and nights are starting to get little cooler.
6749821,Franco,2023-07-12 17:16:00,107,"June 1st is the earliest I’ve flown in. It was near White River. Lucked out with pretty good, dry weather (mid 50’s to mid 60’s) and the bugs only hit hard on our last day. The week before it was high 30’s to high 40’s and raining almost every day."
6750167,Ohio fisherman,2023-07-13 22:43:00,988,"Not a fly in, but one year drove north a few days before the opener. It was very cold and it snowed a couple days. We had about 4 of snow in the boat."
6750451,Franco,2023-07-15 16:49:00,107,"Brutal that the outfitter wouldn’t proactively re-schedule you. If they’ve been in the North for even a little while, they have a good gauge on when the ice will be off their lake."
6750571,NSXNeal,2023-07-16 13:43:00,3,"^^^^^ TRUTH! ^^^^^ Into the Chapleau area May 27th - June 2nd. Literally six days in a row of hot (83-88F), humid, calm (ZERO walleye chop) weather. Never got rain gear out - no rain. Fishing was dead.Last year, same week and north of Nakina on the Albany........cold (33-48F), clammy, windy, rainy. (still fun, though!)I've probably done 15-20 trips into NW ONT week two. Generally I call ~May 20-27 ""week one', May 27-June 2/3 ""week two"" etc etc. Avoid the emergence of black flies, and usually the mosquitos aren't too bad yet. Yes, the weather is all over the map but I'll take it. Walleye fishing is usually always good. No way I want to be there ""weeks 3 through 6."" Black flies are a curse on man"
6751229,Phillypat,2023-07-20 10:20:00,12,"Did the last week of May 2019 on Gouin. Would not recommend..Main lake was frozen but the bay we flew into was open. Water temps were in the high 30s to low 40s. Walleye seemed to be heavy in spawn, every single fish we caught was a male shooting milt everywhere. Not a single female walleye out of maybe 70-80 fish landed between 4 guys in 5 days. Fish seemed to be concentrated in spawning areas and no where else.Weather was awful and it was so cold at night you could not hang outside. Went mid June of 2022 for my next trip and found better weather and fishing. My guide said 2019 was a late spring and not every year is like how we were up there but Id say if you are spending all the money and time to do a trip, why roll the dice?BTW with the flies, just wear high % deet and they leave you alone."
6751425,Doack,2023-07-21 11:17:00,10,"We had a last week of May where the black flies were the culprit, couldn't see out of netting at times so thick in Chapleau."
6749161,lionfan19,2023-07-09 12:49:00,41,I have always gone in June. Curious what those have experienced who have gone in May. How was the fishing? Where were the fish located? Were walleyes still in spawning locations? Where did you find the Northerns that early? Love to hear your thoughts.
6749167,wdkott,2023-07-09 13:16:00,26,"I really like going in May for the following reasons:-the bugs aren’t out much yet, I find usually a day or two before flying back out from camp the bugs are just starting to come out.-smallmouth bass are in pre spawn mode and very active, and top water fishing can be outstanding-the fish are generally shallow and hungry. Walleye are post spawn in water 2-8 feet deep and very susceptible to any shallow water fishing method. I enjoy casting with a jig/plastic trailer for them. Pike have also spawned and usually aggressive once you find them. Look for them in dark bottomed bays where the sun can warm them up. Usually afternoons are better than mornings. Finding any emergeant weed beds can also be key.The wildcard in May is the weather. If stable conditions prevail, you’ll have an outstanding fishing trip. I’ve had trips with no rain, just some high winds a few days and cold, crisp mornings and fishing has been great with no lost days. Plan on some rainy, windy days most Springs and some time in the cabin. It’s also nice to have some warm fires in the wood stove in the cabin which you can count on in May."
6749171,Eckohlt,2023-07-09 13:53:00,3685,A week before opener.
6749187,kswalleyer,2023-07-09 19:14:00,1651,"flown in and also paddled in 3rd week to end of May as I recall...was even in a blizzard in boundary waters with no tent poles one time!! that was NOT good. stuck on an island in blizzard conditions. woke up to a 1/2 foot of snow. Outfitter got permission from park service to fly poles into quetico so it was bad. there were no aircraft allowed over Quetico at least back then.....but!..... fishing was ridiculous when the storm cleared. Crazy good. We had a great 5 days. Everything is shallow and easy, especially Lake Trout. I like late May, be prepared."
6749219,Bill Krejca,2023-07-10 05:40:00,6107,"It really depends on how far north you go, and the weather can be different from year to year. Although not a fly-in, for a few years I traveled some 1325 miles from Marion, Iowa, to Saskatchewan to be there May opening week. This was NW of Flin Flon, Manitoba, probably farther north than most fly-ins. We camped, found ice still in a bay or two, collected snow/ice for the cooler. The first few days, the walleyes bit pretty well, but the pike did not. Going into a bay, we could see some giants in the clear water, but they were for the most part pretty lethargic. Mid week, with a south wind, the bay fish started to bite very well, lots of fun casting to the surface minnows exploding as they were chased by the hungry pike. No mosquitos, cool nights. Experiences at other locations opening days found cool conditions sparked by very aggressive fish, abrupt bite improvements caused by the south wind. Bill"
6749237,NM_Trout,2023-07-10 07:52:00,1094,We went 3rd week in May once to an outpost out of Red Lake. We froze our butts off :-) AND the mosquitos were voracious. WTH???
6749261,adempsey2.0,2023-07-10 09:04:00,611,Third week in May (I think?) north of Nakina. We had gorgeous weather and wore shorts. Weather can be a real crap shoot end of May to early June.
6749283,Golden Eagle,2023-07-10 10:13:00,2642,Arrived on 2nd Saturday in May. Left camp 21 days later. Had different set of friends with me for weeks 2 & 3. Fish alone for pike the first week. Two other times I've gone in a week prior to walleye opener and stayed 2 weeks.
6749403,SweetD,2023-07-10 18:49:00,243,"Was hotter than H-E Double L last week of May this year. Almost always go in May and probably one of the most volotile months of the fishing season but we generally love it for the reasons mentioned here. Fish shallow, fish in current areas and inflows, cool, fires in camp stove and almost ZERO bugs!!!"
6749735,MrSimon,2023-07-12 08:18:00,922,"I've fished in May a fair amount, but don't do it anymore. The uncertainty of weather and fishing is too big of a variable now that I take my kids with me. Nasty weather can ruin a trip that the kids have looked forward to for an entire year. I now much prefer late summer. Kids are off school, sports haven't started up yet, weather is gorgeous and stable, bugs have calmed down, and the fish are predicable and easy."
