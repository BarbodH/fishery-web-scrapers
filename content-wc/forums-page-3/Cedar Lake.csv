Any thoughts on that?[/QUOTE]Have only been as far as East Bay.Weed beds seemed good to me coming from west end.Will be covering Cedar in couple weeks and check out the East end.
6751369,prov1800,2023-07-21 07:25:00,5010,Bring a shovels then there freebies.
6751373,Wallychowder,2023-07-21 07:47:00,1567,yeah thats the funny part ! Your allowed to bring cigs and booze just not crawlers !.....Lol.

6751439,Wallychowder,2023-07-21 12:39:00,1567,yeah thats why you gotta buy the crawlers in Canada now to kill more walleye ! Apparently USA crawlers don't do the trick !
6751441,Wallychowder,2023-07-21 12:41:00,1567,That don't look like potatoes from a can......lol.
6751455,Eckohlt,2023-07-21 14:11:00,3685,"Chowder just make sure you don't have any Minnesota dirt under your finger nails when you go to cross,they could turn you back with dirty paws!"
6751463,prov1800,2023-07-21 15:30:00,5010,Lol.Dont much use canned potatoes at home.Hard to get them crispy and brown.Easy for shorelunches though Best is open them up in morning and drain water out and put them in a towel and dry them then not to bad.Id rather take real any day
6751465,prov1800,2023-07-21 15:32:00,5010,I hear most crawlers come from Canada anyways.
6751513,RichA$1970,2023-07-21 18:39:00,1158,Nice to just have a friend who fishes. I’m usually good on time driving up so I love hitting local bait shops and don’t mind paying a little more as so many good memories as a kid with my great uncle taking me to them before a fishing adventure.
6751315,prov1800,2023-07-20 20:13:00,5010,"Got out on Cedar today.Pretty decent day with some sunshine and not to windy for a change.Mainly a muskie mission today which had me raise a few fish but none where hungry today but it fixed the muskie itch I had.Always awesome to see them.So on to a few walleye spots.Didnt go very far from northern lights.Had to go check out the walleye situation as I have a guide date on Sunday.The five spots I fished were very good and found them in thex13-20 ft depth.Did well at each spot but they were slow to bite as I was dropping a 1/8 oz jig and minnow right on top of them and as I lifted bait up they would rise up with it and then go back to the bottom.But always a few hungry ones in the school.Fished the edges of some weed beds and into the weed bed with weedless jigs and those spots also produced fish.One weed edge put a bunch of smallies in the boat,always fun fish to catch.waterctemps have dropped to 65f far cry from few weeks ago whenbitvwas 75+f.Tried my favorite shallow spots to and no fish to be found.3 o'clock I pulled the pin.Could hear Thunder and some dark stuff was coming and I left my rain gear in my truck.No use ruining a good day."
6751319,Spurgery,2023-07-20 21:13:00,79,Nice report. I am quite jealous of you pretty much all summer. Not so much come winter though. Lol.
6751323,prov1800,2023-07-20 21:47:00,5010,Winter is not to bad.Pick the right days.Insulated tents and heated huts.never get rained on and no bugs.
6751337,RichA$1970,2023-07-21 02:40:00,1158,I’m trying to figure out how to spend May-October in NW Ontario and the rest of the year in Thailand. Looks like a fun day.
6751339,Wallychowder,2023-07-21 04:15:00,1567,Got any Rich relatives ? Be nice to em !
6751347,Eckohlt,2023-07-21 05:43:00,3685,"Hope to have a plate like that in 3 weeks,twice a day 6 out of the 7 days!"
6751349,Eckohlt,2023-07-21 05:44:00,3685,"He's got a rich friend in me,but I have to save my money for crawlers."
6751351,Wallychowder,2023-07-21 05:54:00,1567,Yeah you buy em up there i can see why !....lol.
