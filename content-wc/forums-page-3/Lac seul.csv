6750975,LacSeul,2023-07-19 06:25:00,6,"Been fishing west side since Saturday, fishing is very very slow. At least it is for us, others in camp say they've been doing ok. Tried Scout Bay, Bay of Islands, McKenzie, Manitoba, Windigo, among other places so far"
6750989,bishyfishy,2023-07-19 06:47:00,5,"Sorry to hear that, trying to decide when during the year to plan our trip next year. Do you feel it's weather related? Time of the year? Just bad luck?"
6750993,prov1800,2023-07-19 07:00:00,5010,You guys are cruising around.Must be coming out of Fisherman's cove or Onaway.Havnt been to LS since last week and even then the fish we caught were not deep.Not sure how deep you guys are trying but might have to try different tactics/presentation.Find some weed beds we did well.
