Not that there is anything wrong with where we have been going, just looking for what else may be comparable and new. Have been going to the NW corner of LOTW the last 20 years so just kicking around some ideas. For those that may have gone, what do you know about Eagle Lake Island Lodge? How are the cabins, meals, equipment, should we consider bringing our own boats and or is what they supply just fine? How is the overall fishing for bass, eyes, and muskie? If we'd want to try for lakers, how far of a run and would it be worth spending a day chasing them for something new? We've been looking over places on Eagle, Lac Suel etc... so anyone with experience with this lodge, pleaser feel free to comment or PM me. Thanks."

Maybe 2010-ish? They didn't have minnows and we did poorly the first day in my usual spots with nightcrawlers, so we hopped over to Temple Bay Lodge to buy minnows. All in all it was a great trip. Nice rustic cabin and we handled all our meals other than a breakfast or two at the dining room. Very nice people as I recall and since I've stayed at TBL many times it was familiar waters to us. There was a phone at the launch that rang to the island to let them know we arrived. They said see you soon and I told them I had no idea how to get there from that launch, so they sent over someone and we followed them back. This was before I had a GPS on my locator, so they also showed us the way back after our trip. The place is beautiful from the lake now, though I haven't been in the camp since that trip."

Still debating to remain where we've been fishing on LOTW which is just fine and we've spent almost 20 years learning the area, or move to a new place? If we do that do we do housekeeping, American Plan or fly in? The search continues. Thanks again."
