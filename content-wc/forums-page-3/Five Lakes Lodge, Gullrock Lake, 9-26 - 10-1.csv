6601276,PhilTickelson,2021-10-04 12:34:00,84,"Just got back from another fantastic trip on Gullrock Lake! I posted a thread earlier asking for advice and said I'd post a report, so here it is. Trip up / border crossing: We stayed in I-falls Saturday night and crossed the border around 7AM Sunday morning. I didn't sleep well, anticipation was high, but the border crossing was a breeze. There wasn't a single other car or truck on the bridge, and the crossing guard was friendly, polite and quick. We showed passports and proof of vaccination and we were across, no more than 2 minutes. The drive up was uneventful, except for a bull moose sighting on 502, that was cool! Rolled into camp about 2PM, unloaded and got the boat put in. Ian was out on a moose hunt, so Drew and Ian's dad Ron helped us get setup. Fishing: Fishing was really pretty incredible. We did not get into any big walleyes, but the numbers were just insane. We often moved off a spot where we were catching fish to search for bigger ones. Our best spots seemed to be main lake points and main lake structure(e.g. The Gull Rock, three sisters, the hump between the gull rock and round island, the point between the boot and fishermen's, etc. ). We caught fish in 12-22 FOW, with most of our fishing in the 14-18 foot range. They definitely preferred live bait, we did get a few on jigging raps, plastics, ripppin' raps, etc, but they were WAY more active on minnows. Vertical jigging was the most effective presentation, but we caught a lot on Lindy's as well. I think we caught about 3 23 inchers, 4 22 inchers, and maybe a half dozen in the 19-21"" range, everything else was 17"" or under. The amount of like 12-15"" fish in there right now is insane. We didn't spend a whole lot of time pike fishing, but man, it was pretty intense. Pike were extremely active if you could find some green weeds. 6-7' of water was killer in some areas. My buddy caught a PB 38"" pike, and I got a 39.5"" and a 42.5""!!! We probably caught another 10 or so in the 32-34"" range. As usual up there, VERY few small pike, just big ones. All in all, it was an extremely fun trip, it wasn't hard to find fish, we literally caught them in like every spot we tried. The last day we decided to sit on the gull rock and vertical jig them for hours, just to see if any big ones rolled through. I think we caught like 150 fish in ~6 hours, that's how fast the action was. Five Lakes Lodge was great as usual, such a well-run camp by great people, can't wait to get back next year, I think I might have the chance to go 2 or even THREE times!"
6601352,johnboat,2021-10-04 18:07:00,2013,"I was there at Five Lakes that same week.Was that you in the white Ranger?Crazy good week. I personally ran through 35 dozen minnows, a pound of leaches, and an entire Beef Heart.As a bonus I brought home 13 Perch all over 12 inches. We pulled up to a spot at 7:30 Wednesday and remained on Spot Lock for 8 1/2 hours and never did stop catching fish. During that time I caught 8 over 22 inches.We never did fish past 3:00 as we went Grouse Hunting every day.Here's a 29""pig I pulled on Wednesday. It's a picture of a picture so it's not the best."
