6624458,RichA$1970,2022-01-12 12:27:00,1158,"I like the tail dancers and they it produced all week until the lip came out. On the plastic shaft it is a solid bar of probably 1.5‚Äù that inserts into the lure body, but if they would have machined in some cross grooves in their injection molding molds that would have allowed for a better bonding joint. I sent it back and they sent me a new one so no issue, but a straight through wire design is better imo. It was a first one as I thought the northern spit the lure out but I just had the bill on my line."

6624492,prov1800,2022-01-12 15:57:00,5010,Well I caught fish on your jigs bill.I cheated a bit to and put a freebie Clarks minnow on it.The small one I used took 5 minutes to get to the bottom but most of the time a fish would dart up to 10 ft a slam the jig.lol.Caught a dozen or so on it.Should of brought a heavier one.But worked good anyways.The my regular 1/8 oz jigs were also on fire with the free by minnows and I switched to a small vibrato and again they slammed it high in the water column.Very aggressive fish today from noon till 3.Petered out then and I could see the writing on the wall.packed up and went home.3 awesome hrs.At least 50 fish I figure.Was not hard to catch fish from looking at my sonar screen.Couple of decent ones and couple of decent fighting fish that got off.Lots of action and fun.
6624548,Bill Krejca,2022-01-13 06:21:00,6107,"Thanks, started tying back in 1946 or so, should get half way decent in that length of time, eh? Bill"

We returned to that lake for several years, but since switching to outpost trips, I have not been near Highway 599 in well over 20 years. Just wondering if it is still a good walleye lake."

Have fished Watcomb & Young as well since they are right up the road there nothing to complain about. Lake of Bays a little deeper in always produces well, but I really don't like the causeway access to the upper part of the lake. Press is always good, along with the English dumping in, been a while since I have been on Press as well. I am typically more on Flatrock just north of Ignace and further up 599 just out of Savant lake on Sturgeon and many of the little lakes between Savant and Minchin. Sturgeon was pretty much on fire this last August, and because of the low water we did not tempt our fait at four of our regular lakes. A lot of years up and down 599."

6622780,guidedfishing,2022-01-06 13:28:00,531,"It pretty much is what the fish tell me it is. I don't start out with a preconceived notion of what will work or not work. Sometime its just what makes me happy regardless of what the fish want to do as well. Could be a slip bobber with a minnow or leech Could be Jig and a minnow, leech or soft plastic ringworm I may just troll the flat with a reef runner, or put the down rigger down and drag some spoons. I do like to bottom bounce later in the summer with a spinner setup, I'll hook up what ever I have from a dead minnow, crawler or plastic ringworm. If I have a bug up my butt and really want to get on some fish fast, I may come into an area and fan cast a walleye diver if that it is getting hit, then I will likely pitch a jig with a ringworm. If that slows down I may come at them with a minnow or leech. That slows down maybe a slip bobber. Or I will start out with the bottom bouncer on a reef or lake hump, if I get some active fish I will anchor or spot lock and work them over with a jig. no body really cares as long as it makes you happy doing it. Some days I just sit on shore with a beer and watch my slip bobber."

6624308,gordy28,2022-01-11 18:17:00,437,While I didn√¢‚Ç¨&#x2122;&#xfe0f;t do a big trip in 2021 as a Canadian all of my fishing is Canada fishing lol 1 new lure I really liked this past summer was the storm smash shad. Purple especially was really good long line trolling for walleye. I would say best depths were between 12 and 20 feet. Sadly this lure is discontinued but I have found a supply at two tackle stores near me and bought a few. Can√¢‚Ç¨&#x2122;&#xfe0f;t wait to try it on Miniss lake this summer 1 tactic that worked amazing again this summer was using a Ned rig. I mainly targeted small mouth with it but caught quite a few pike and walleye on it. I really like the x man finesse jig heads in 1/10 or 1/15 ounce size along w a zman trd finesse worm (like a mini senko) Green pumpkin is my go to but one called bubble gut and one called Drew&#x2122;&#xfe0f;s craw were also solid. Another one I am going to be trying on Miniss and on one of my canoe trips where bass is involved Cheers for starting this thread. Picked up quite a few things I want to try!Andrew
6624348,RichA$1970,2022-01-11 21:39:00,1158,Last September at Savant Lake I used a 4.5‚Äù Deep Tail Dancer in Purple for at least the first 5 days that was killing them until I had a northern on that almost got to the boat and the actual plastic lip pulled out from the lure that it swam off with the lure. Seems they use an adhesive bond vs. a wire design that sucks imo but probably saves Rapala some cents. Runner ups were gold / black deep husky jerk & hot n tot.
6624358,prov1800,2022-01-12 05:54:00,5010,I don't troll much but when i do its mainly for lake trout and do use the taildancers at times and run them behind dipsy divers.Good l√πres and luckily I have not have any come apart.better check mine for cracks.lol.
6624368,Bill Krejca,2022-01-12 06:57:00,6107,"As I have continued to ""mature"", My trips to God's Country have reduced to one(hopefully at least) a year. Having fished in Ontario, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, mainly Iowa, with a bit of Missouri, my observation has been that different bodies of water seem to prefer different baits/approaches. And that changes happen, with fish preferences becoming fickle at times. In my present trips to Cedar Lake, Vermillion Bay, I only use 2 baits and no live bait. I vertical fish for crappie, and catch everything , from crappie, walleye, to musky. If it is cloudy, I use a 2"" - 2-3/4"" tube bait on a jig head. If it is sunny, I use a shiny hair jig, which I make, labeled ""Krejca's Killers"" some 40 years ago. That is it. In some other bodies of water, these do not produce as well, Gulp! minnows on a jig being a good choice. Bill"

6622722,v-bay gord,2022-01-06 08:36:00,3168,"Yes, scam was probably an incorrect term. A scam implies no results, and yes you can catch fish with live bait.....it's just sooooooo boring. I like some of the suggestions thus far on different alternatives. Get off the crack cocaine of live minnows John .....get back to the fun of fishing! It's not about numbers, it's the challenge and strategy. I think Mojo NC has the right approach."

6622734,Laketripper,2022-01-06 09:25:00,103,"I use homemade spinner rigs 99% of the time. No rhyme or reason for the colors and always with a barbless single hook.Usually backtrolling from anywhere in 3 ft. of water to 25 ft. of water depths , depending on what month it is. Rarely use live minnows because they aren't overly convenient for me to obtain but I do believe they put more fish in the boat."
6622746,7 Mag,2022-01-06 10:25:00,1887,I use spinners quite often as well but this past year i fished a lot with Jigging Raps in different sizes and colors. I found that most every type of fish will bite on them but they do get hung up easily.
6622752,Pooch,2022-01-06 11:07:00,4618,"I think I make my fishing partners a little crazy as I change lures, colors, etc. all day long just to try something different and learn. Some of my buddies put on one lure and fish it the whole trip. Somewhere I have a picture of my scattered used plastics from just one day on the water.Fishing with different partners is a learning experience. We all fish a little differently. My wife picks out her own colors or lures and will invariably kick my butt..... Pooch"
6622760,Pooch,2022-01-06 11:30:00,4618,"Found it. From when I was still using a flasher and rental boat. No idea of the year. Mid to late 1990's?This was my early years tinkering with trolling plastics on spinner rigs. There appears to be a leech laying there, too. Today I and many others carry a ton of plastics. Every trip I have to sort out what is making the trip and what is not from a large tub of plastics in the basement.The ""stuff"" I never thought would work.... does.Pooch"
6622762,v-bay gord,2022-01-06 11:35:00,3168,You might be too addicted to bait for me to help you. Perhaps a nine step program to get you off the free minnows you've been mainlining all these years?
6622764,maddogg,2022-01-06 12:09:00,178,I go to Canada to catch fish and have fun.If I wanted to have a challenge and strategy session I'd fish the lake around home.
6622504,Mojo-NC,2022-01-05 13:43:00,1929,"2021 was an interesting year in Canada for our group. We did a fly-in trip early-to-mid September. Most of the fish caught were in the expected 25' depth range, give or take a few feet. An occasional fish was caught in water as shallow as 12-15', and we also caught a few fish in 35+' when we'd get blown off of our spot. We didn't spend much time in the deeper water due to potential fish mortality issues. We had previously fished this lake in September and already had most of the prime locations and depths identified. This was a year with an excellent opportunity for fine tuning. However, the water surface temps in 2021 were unseasonably warm and most of our minnows died the first few days of the trip. We still caught fish on them but the bait smelled really bad. I quit using them by Wednesday and switched to artificial baits with reservations. My reservations did not last long. Our normal jigging spots produced fish and there was generally a good bite on. We experimented this trip with baits and colors in our tackle boxes that we hadn't typically used. We literally caught fish on every color jig we used (pink either caught too many pike and/or got bit off). Hair jigs and spinner jigs worked great, and jigging raps also worked incredibly well. I was very surprised to find that artificial baits worked as well as ""live/dead"" minnows. A jig with a Z-Man Slim SwimZ minnow threaded on the hook worked as well as a minnow. We pulled homemade spinner rigs using Lindy No-Snag weights with either minnows or a Charlie Brewer 3"" Walleye Grub as bait. The nose-hooked grubs also worked as well as minnows and a single grub would usually last for 10 or more fish. When we got a bite on artificial bait and didn't catch the fish, we didn't have to reel it in to check the bait - it was always still there, so no need to check. Artificial baits worked so well that it is very likely I won't use live bait next year. We had success using Colorado, Indiana, and willow blades on our spinner rigs, with size 3.5 willow blades being my personal favorites. We would often troll a couple of baits behind the boat while going from one spot to another. We literally caught pike and walleyes on every bait and color we tried, using different spoons and crankbaits. Every Doctor spoon I used caught fish, and I used at least 5 colors. The most productive lure was probably the Rapala Deep Runner 9 crankbait in the fire tiger color pattern. My favorite go-to baits for next year will be the following: Jigging - 3/8 oz VMC Sleek Jig w/ Z-Man natural color Slim SwimZ bait threaded on hook Spinner rigging - Size 3.5 Willow Blade in Emerald Shiner or Clown color with 3"" Charlie Brewer walleye grub (nose-hooked) Trolling - Rapala Deep Runner 9 crankbait in the fire tiger color What are your favorite and most successful methods/techniques and colors?"
6622526,Bfgilly,2022-01-05 14:56:00,18,"1/4 - 3-8 oz jig usually with 3‚Äù pink, white or chartreuse body. We have always tipped jig with salted minnows or leaches but used worms this past August (probably not needed but it gives added confidence). I also love to use a jerk bait & some times it will out fish the jig."
6622532,NM_Trout,2022-01-05 15:14:00,1094,"No Canada 2021 fishing for me, but can I chime in?Paddle tail soft plastics with white / chartreuse as the most used color. Rapala original in Firetiger (we bring a bunch of these as they get used up by pike).For fly fishing for pike, I like a large red / white / silver streamer pattern tied with whistle head and some body weight. This next year I want to try jigging with a 1/2oz jig / plastic, and put a t-swivel about 18""up and drag a weightless clouser minnow pattern off that swivel. Just for grins."
6622612,drlee,2022-01-05 19:18:00,409,"Last two weeks in August at my favorite drive in camp, Press Lake. 3/8 oz. jigs in bright colors on 6 lb test. Or, Little Joe spinners with chain link trolling sinkers (old school) bright colors on spinners. Primary bait was Berkley Gulp 3"" smelt. Also used some crawlers. Fish were in the 18-25' range. Mid lake reefs. Big schools. Really big schools. Around 600 walleyes total, 2 guys, 2 weeks. Some of the best fishing we have enjoyed at Press Lake Camp. I thought I had died and gone to heaven just because I could go to Canada.Next summer: A week on Lake Pashkokogan at Austin's Wilderness Lodge in mid June. Back to Press Lake the last week in July and first week in August. Can't wait!"
6622618,Mojo-NC,2022-01-05 19:35:00,1929,"Sounds interesting. I didn't do it this past year but have previously used a similar drop shot type set-up. I used a jig/minnow as the weight on the bottom and with a single hook tied directly to the line about 12"" up (using a Palomar knot) with a leech on that hook. Most of the fish were caught on the jig/minnow."
6622640,v-bay gord,2022-01-05 21:02:00,3168,My favourite and most successful methods do not involve live bait. Live bait is a scam promoted by the live bait industry....
6622686,prov1800,2022-01-06 06:48:00,5010,Geez Gord did you wake up on the the wrong side of the bed.In my option live bait is the best method of catching a ton of fish..ill dabble with artificial baits on my own or after getting tired of catching a bunch of fish.Have always had a slowdown in catch rate when i switch over.Ill never leave the dock without minnows when i have guide days.My guests expect live bait and can use artificial if they choose to but always use up the 10 dozen minnows i bring along first.Not sure what you mean by a scam.

Also trolledl Larger Shad Raps in Fire Tiger Color. Did a lot of trolling mainly because of the Very High Heat to try & keep cool Had 4 or 5 days of Over 90 with virtually No wind. Had an excellent time ,But Ogoki has Way Too many tree and other wood in the water for me to ever go back there. Will stick to my favorite lake North Caribou at end of June/Early July in 2022 Also taking 2 other trips One to Antenna lake at end of May/June with Clark's outposts and to Uchi lake in Early September. If anyone has any information on Antenna lake ,I would appreciate a message from you on the Makeup of the lake and if you could send a Map I would be grateful Larry Schroeder"
6622714,Mojo-NC,2022-01-06 07:44:00,1929,"Geez, don't y'all like to explore and try new stuff? Sure, we could use a jig and a minnow/leech/crawler and go to a good spot and catch fish all day, but what fun is that? I get bored. If we're on fish, we catch a bunch and then it is the perfect time to explore new locations and techniques. I'll stick with the tried-and-true techniques when the fishing gets tough, but when there is a good bite on I like to try new techniques that just might get the bigger or trophy fish. One of our goals each year is to catch fish using a new technique or by using something in the tackle box might be a great marketing product but has never previously caught a fish, and then catch a fish on it. One of our biggest pike last year was caught on a Ned-rig. How cool is that? We used various jig combinations, we tested all colors of our jigging raps, used drop-shot rigs, Ned-rigs, we ripped lipless crankbaits, used 3-way swivel rigs, tried various spinner rig combinations including slow death hooks and floating jigs, and every other variation we could think of to try to catch fish. Sure, we wouldn't catch as many fish using the ""non-traditional"" techniques, but it was really fun when we did. The three I mentioned in the post above will catch walleyes in even the toughest conditions, but the others are just plain fun."
