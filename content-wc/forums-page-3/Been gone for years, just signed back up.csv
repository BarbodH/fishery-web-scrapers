Also liked Crow. Been to Nestor Falls(Canadian Haven), Sioux Narrows(Indianhead), also went to Kenora(went to Crow Rock and Ash Rapids).Wanting a trip for 24 and a quick search shows Airbnb has several but they appear to be lodges using them to fill cabins?Also would consider private cabins . Would consider any of the above places again so if you know others let me know or pm me Thanks in advance"
