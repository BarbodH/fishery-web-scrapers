6749453,NY Yank,2023-07-11 04:56:00,5,"The cabin and accommodations were great. Fishing was good. Lots of 15 to 19 walleyes. Took us a while to find them, once we did it was pretty good. Like stated before, really rocky. It's like a mine field. Currie was also good. Did the portage twice. Portage is a little more than I expected. Very muddy and shallow getting in to the main lake. Caught 45-50 really nice smallmouth. I know Clark's talked about shutting Currie down because of shallow water. All in all a good trip."
6749455,Eckohlt,2023-07-11 05:03:00,3685,Sounds like the lake is not motor lower unit friendly!
6751597,Larry S,2023-07-22 12:18:00,665,NY Yank what did you catch the Smallmouth On Will be at UNA Aug 21-28 Larry Schroeder
6751601,NY Yank,2023-07-22 12:38:00,5,Crawfish crankbaits and chatterbaits got most of them. Hopefully you can still get to Currie.
6751695,Larry S,2023-07-23 06:17:00,665,I understand from reading other posts on Una that if you are not able to navigate river to Currie that you can portage to lake? Did you see the portage? Larry Schroeder
6751767,NY Yank,2023-07-23 11:39:00,5,"Portage is marked ok, no river access. Probably 1/2 mile portage. We did it twice and that was enough for me. Be careful when you get to the boats on Currie, muddy mess. The inlet into Currie is very shallow. Really silted in. I'd check with Clark's before you head there."
6743975,NY Yank,2023-06-12 11:35:00,5,"Heading to Una and Currie with Clark's later this month, not sure what to expect. Looking for walleye and smallmouth tips for this time of year."
6744003,Eckohlt,2023-06-12 13:48:00,3685,Didn't know the had a lake named Currie is it new???
6744037,kona77,2023-06-12 15:19:00,236,Didn't know the had a lake named Currie is it new? ECK- Currie is a portage lake off of Una. I believe it is the only lake the Clarks have with SMB. I have seen some decent reports on the SMB numbers from Currie
6744067,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-06-12 17:32:00,358,I went to Una over ten years ago with Clark's. The cabin is very nice and had an indoor bathroom. Una is easily the rockiest lake I have ever fished. Keep the speed down and the outboard unlocked. The walleye on Una are plentiful. Fish weedbeds in the rocks. The map supplied by Clark's with the hot spots is excellent. We used white paddletail swimbaits all the time we were there. The portage lake has smallies and pike. Again fish the weedbeds. Hope this helps.
6744069,Eckohlt,2023-06-12 17:33:00,3685,"Ok gotcha,learn something new everyday,Kona your full of info,hahaha.Instead of calling Wayne to ask him something,I'll just msg you."
6744141,Larry S,2023-06-13 06:36:00,665,NY Yank When you get back Please Post a report of your trip. My sister & I are going to UNA in August and any information would help. Are you planning on SMB fishing in Currie Lake?
6744149,lassh,2023-06-13 07:05:00,553,"Fished Una and Currie a couple times years ago when Chuck Mossbeck owned it. Una is fast fishing for eyes. Jigs and twister tails around the numerous rocks and shoals was the ticket. We also caught them trolling shallow running cranks and casting jerk baits. There are probably no Walleye left in Currie Lake as the smallmouth took the lake over. When we were there there were still a few walleyes left, but they were all huge. We only caught a five or six eyes on Currie and they were all over 25"". We fished a lot for eyes on Currie but only caught the big eyes and of course smallies. Smallmouth could be caught shallow and deep on Curie, but the best spots were sand to rock transitions."
6744417,NY Yank,2023-06-14 13:17:00,5,How's the portage going to Currie? I will post a report when we get back.
6744497,lassh,2023-06-14 20:18:00,553,It was a long time ago but I don't remember any issues. If it was tough or unusual I would remember.
6749405,wdkott,2023-07-10 19:00:00,26,How was the fishing on Una? How long and difficult was the portage to Currie Lake?
