Great guy, great lodge, great fishing, and I know he does Bear hunts as well. That time of year you may even be able to throw grouse hunting into the fray in the evenings if you're interested, world class grouse hunting up there! I'm honestly not sure if he runs his bear hunts out of his main lodge or if they fly out for those, but call him and he'll talk your ear off about hunting lol.Great time of year to be on Gull Rock lake as well, you'll have the lake basically to yourself and the big pike will be hungry!Here's the info: https://fivelakeslodge.com/packages/...nting-package/"
6751241,BankerFish,2023-07-20 11:53:00,27,"I'd say Sunset Lodge on Red Lake, ON but i don't know how fast you drive. might exceed your 15 hr limiit, LOL. Have you looked into going to Wisconson? they have many walleye options and sometimes i see more bears while driving through WI than i do on the 502. Have fun with your search and good luck!"
