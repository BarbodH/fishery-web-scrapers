6750919,Camoclad,2023-07-18 18:51:00,628,Best tip I received is to keep moving if the fish are not there. Another tip is that live bait out performs plastics (even though plastics can be good too). Last bit of advice was to keep it simple. Some times a hook and split shot with a piece of worm will catch fish when nothing else will. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

6751049,Eckohlt,2023-07-19 09:40:00,3685,Was there any money on the line for first fish?haha
6751177,Bill Krejca,2023-07-20 06:07:00,6107,"No money, but every time we moved to a different spot, it became noticeable that Jack had his line in the water while the boat was still coasting in, and getting a fish many of these times. I think the moving boat/motor overhead is enough of a disturbance that fish underneath seem to become awakened enough to want to bite. (Not woke ) Bill"

6749929,emma17,2023-07-13 09:38:00,436,"Things that have worked for us: -Pick spots you think will hold fish in advance of leaving the dock. Make sure you pick different structure/area types. Get to those spots (trust your plan). -Once at a spot, before I help family members set up or attend to any non-fishing tasks, I'll throw a bobber and minnow in. I always have a bobber pole handy. -Once all jigging lines are in, I will fan cast around the boat. -Throw a marker in so you're not guessing. -If you have a lucky family member or friend, let them pick the spot from a map. My daughter is money when it comes to picking a spot off the map."

6750085,drew59,2023-07-13 16:14:00,87,"Question: if you’re catching smallish walleyes, say 13-14 inches, do you move and if so, deeper or shallower?"
6750089,fishron,2023-07-13 16:29:00,317,"Drew, I think it depends on the body of water. The common thought is that walleye of a certain size school together and if you find yourself on that school, you will continue to catch that size. On our recent trip to Lady Evelyn lake that scenario was not the case. We found ourselves catching small medium and large walleyes (23 to 28 inches) in exactly the same area. I don't think that is the norm. I would tend to move to find larger fish."
6750809,orchard frank,2023-07-18 07:20:00,1900,"One thing my wife and I had luck with during windy, tough boat control days, was to get on a good reef and anchor. During these conditions, the fish are roaming around, but active, casting in all directions, usually with plastics and a fairly heavy jig. Would often be dead periods of varying times, then bam, almost every cast hooking up. Not sure if it was our imagination, but we would sometimes bring in a fish real slow, the struggles seemed to trigger others, often following up to boat. Have Fun."
6750821,Old Timer,2023-07-18 08:22:00,255,Two tips. Grill your outfitter for the hotspots. And use live bait.
6750847,Mojo-NC,2023-07-18 11:16:00,1929,"Since this thread is under the Canada tab, I assume the OP's question was referring to tips for fishing Canadian lakes. Ontario regulations state that even though a maximum of 4 hooks are allowed per line, only one line is allowed per person. Unless I'm wrong, one cannot legally jig with one rod and cast with another or have another rod out in the water with a bobber and minnow. For clarification, I assume that you set everyone else up jigging and then then you use a different technique. I didn't want anyone to misinterpret what you meant. Good suggestions though. Until we identify a successful catching pattern, we also like to use different techniques, different styles, and/or different colors to find out that the fish are after. For example, while pulling spinner rigs, one guy might use a slow death rig and a crawler while another uses a different type or size of spinner blade with a minnow."

He said he throws the bobber setup out BEFORE doing anything else.I think the purpose is so he is passively fishing ,,,,,,,,,while helping the others get started and set up. Not so much the different technic, just that he has a line in the water (a single line), during that time he is helping others get set up."

6749329,drew59,2023-07-10 13:24:00,87,"I thought it would be interesting to share useful, perhaps simple, tips you might’ve received over the years for catching or finding walleyes. For example, a guide told me to tail hook my minnows when slow fishing a Lindy rig. Others?"
6749525,Peterpikes,2023-07-11 10:33:00,33,"This is obvious to the seasoned guys, but here are the two tips I’d give someone new to fly-in fishing to help them locate fish. Depth finder is a must. Hummingbird Fishin’ Buddy is around $100 and runs on AA batteries. Finding the ledges/drop offs is key to finding the walleye. Don’t hide from the wind. Sure, the back side of the island is protected and looks nice and calm, but you’re going to have a lot more success fishing the wind blown shoreline. The chop is your friend."
6749543,MrSimon,2023-07-11 11:21:00,922,"Two simple tips from me. 1) Maximize your efforts in FINDING the walleye. Once you find them they are easy to catch. Hint, good electronics make this way, WAY, easier. 2) Learn VERY good boat control. Trolling motors, anchors, drift socks, back-trolling, etc. Once you find them, you have to STAY on them."
6749565,Golden Eagle,2023-07-11 12:35:00,2642,Works every time.
6749571,Walleye2242,2023-07-11 12:46:00,263,"A depth finder is a must for me. Looking for drop offs and edge lines. Boat control is a on going learning process but its much more critical than i realized long ago. Now that i fish alone in canada it has been a learning process for years now. it really is an art and very critical...especially when ya watch boats that do not seem to understand it. sounds odd but when i learned and took up fly fishing 20 years ago it really changed how i look at lakes when i am in canada. I have never fly fished in canada or on a lake. However, i now look at a lake as if i am watching a river i am standing in. I look for flows and currents and wind. Watch how water goes around a point or island. Look for where water meets and circulates. turn off the motor and go for a slow drift and see where the water takes you. for me...lighter gear..all i use is a UL with 6lb line. Just what i like and use too and feel."
6749591,Mojo-NC,2023-07-11 14:30:00,1929,"Do a pre-trip evaluation of the lake before you go. When I'm going to fish a lake I've never fished before, I will study a topographical map of the lake on my home computer and identify a bunch of places that look like they would hold fish. Look for any places on the map where deep water comes close to the shoreline and places where shallow water extends out towards deeper water. Look for islands, submerged humps, and any narrow areas that separate different sections of the lake. I fished one particular lake for years before a topographical map of the lake was available. Once the map was made available, all of the places where we regularly caught fish were easily identified on the lake map by using the method mentioned above. If there is not a topographical map available, you will have to use the next best method - a visual observation of the lake. Make a quick run around the area that you plan to fish and look for steep areas of shorline, rocky areas, weeds, and putt around areas looking for other unique structure. Troll along deeper shorelines and visually observe the lake while making a mental note of places where you catch fish. Look for places where weeds extend out into deeper water, and confirm the depth with a fishfinder. As others have mentioned, having electronics and knowing how to use them will make the process SO MUCH EASIER."
6749639,adempsey2.0,2023-07-11 20:37:00,611,1) Look at an aerial map/satellite view of the lake and make waypoints for your GPS. 2) WHEN you go is often more important than WHERE you go. 3) Don't waste too much time in unproductive locations. [I am still guilty of this!]
6749745,Franco,2023-07-12 09:20:00,107,"At the risk of stating the obvious:1. Stay close to bottom, whether jigging, trolling or casting. If you’re targeting walleye, you need to be close to bottom. In particular, I often see people trolling far too high in the water column. This is a good way to catch pike but not such a good way to catch walleye. I’ve heard that walleye suspend higher in the water column at some times in the season but I’ve never experienced this (in great numbers anyways) in June, July or August. 2. Look for inlets and outlets. Typically you will find walleye there, especially early/mid season.3. If you don’t have a fish finder, or if it dies on you, learn to estimate your depth by dropping a jig straight down. You can get a ballpark understanding of your depth and it’s better than nothing."
6749799,10lbeye,2023-07-12 13:23:00,61,"1. My default pattern is to fish shallow to deep, and not vice versa. The overwhelming majority of big walleyes I have caught in 40+ years of targeting them have been in 7-20 ft of water. Even in warmer water temps, they will frequently be in shallower water when feeding, especially in cloudy or raining conditions. Not to say you can't catch them in 20-30 ft, but it is the exception rather than the rule for me usually. 2. I often troll to locate fish, then throw out a marker if I am on midlake areas and then cast around it with jigs, bladebaits, etc., especially if the area around the marker is a good structure point (hump, crown, dropoff, etc). There are times, however, that they want motion and action and want to chase. 3. I like to throw a different bait or color, whether it is jig or bladebait, than my boat partner is using. Same with cadence and retrieve. Last yr my boat partner went old school during a lull with a jig and crawler and was barely moving it off bottom. I was using a jig and paddletail. Day previous I had caught dozens of eyes on it. He started catching one after another. I stuck with my soft plastic, but mirrored his technique of barely moving my jig off bottom. I then began to catch fish. Lesson: vary your action/retrieve and have the flexibility to switch baits or tactics and eventually they will tell you what they're interested in. 4. I've had countless days where we caught fish on jigs/blades away from the boat and nothing vertical. Other times, it was vertical only. Another lesson learned in varying your presentation. General rule: fish hitting on longer casts away from the boat means they are on a more active bite and are chasing. More vertical means you are putting it right in front of their faces and perhaps inducing a negative mood fish to strike. 5. Let the wind dictate where you go first. I usually hit the windswept side of the lake first if I am fishing shorelines. For bays, I prefer to target first those where the wind is blowing in rather than out. Not an ironclad rule by any means but a good one to give some thought to."
