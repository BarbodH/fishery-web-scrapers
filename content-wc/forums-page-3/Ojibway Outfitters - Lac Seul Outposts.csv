Anyone know if they sold and rebranded or what became of the resort? Haven't been back for many many years but was going to try to give them a shout. Just curious as to what became of the place. Liked the location, but not everything... of course that was 20+ years ago.Thanks."

The sale of the building and auction of contents was concluded during our stay at the outpost ( Chaberlain Narrows)- middle of June of this year. The outpost was business as usual and completely full the week following our departure. Best Regards, TVTYD"
6752065,stjoeguy,2023-07-24 21:15:00,979,I'm glad to hear that Lac Seul Outposts is alive and well. I stayed there a few years ago and would enjoy returning.
6752077,pjshorthorn,2023-07-25 03:36:00,5654,I've stayed at Lac Seul Outpost lodge on Chamberlain Narrows many times over the years. Amazing fishing and camp location. I would go back in a minute. My favorite times there were in late fall when moose hunters started coming into camp. One late September there was only two fisherman in camp. The rest were moose hunters. So peaceful during the day. I'm sorry to hear that the bait shop has been sold. We always stopped to see Ms Vicki before heading up the lake for our trips. PjShorthorn
