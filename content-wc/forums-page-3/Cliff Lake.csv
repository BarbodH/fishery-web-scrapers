Switched to hard to catch walleyes and figured I caufht a couple of dozen of them to.As with the trout the walleyes were all to big to keep.Ended keeping a 24"" trout and brought one 20"" walleye home.I was trying to get all of the species but that didn't happen.I did see 3 muskies today and had one of them on but it got off within 5 seconds.lol.Had a fun day.Only saw 2 boats near end of my day at 3 pm."
