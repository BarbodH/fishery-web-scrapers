Our group wanted a sat phone for our trip last year as the area we would be in was fairly remote. Since I was driving, I had the phone sent to my house and upon returning , I just sent it back in the company’s return shipping package they provided. In researching the companies, all of ones I looked at were priced pretty much the same.Pretty easy process. Our group just split the overall cost.PjShorthorn"
