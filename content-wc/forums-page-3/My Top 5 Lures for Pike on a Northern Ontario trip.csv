6599270,gordy28,2021-09-24 07:16:00,437,Man - some great comments and lure choices I look at the Rapala Otis and Peto all the time - never pull the trigger because I just cant see myself wanting to cast them for any extended period of time lol I am thinking I may invest in a heavier spinning combo for pike - I find my baitcaster frustrating on those really windy days - to many backlashes Cheers Andrew

Dial it in and pay attention too if you are casting into or with the wind and adjust accordingly. You will never beat a bait caster for accuracy unless you are casting 5 feet from the boat."
6599338,spoonchucker,2021-09-24 10:28:00,82,"My group are primarily pike hunters. We take a yearly trip to some great pike lakes in Canada, mostly Manitoba or Saskatchewan. I am lucky enough that my son comes in from Boston on these trips and he ""guides"" me. Fishing with him I can tell you that the most aggressive pike strikes and the lure that out fishes my spoons every time is a big streamer fly at the end of his fly rod. Last trip a few weeks ago he caught a 43 then a 45 right after on that, If the wind is such as to prevent that, he uses a six inch swimbait paddle tail on his spinning rod. He is a big believer in the soft plastics with the hook buried. Hardly ever uses anything else. We only fish single hook barbless so the minnow baits with the treble hooks are out."
6599970,jsmyers,2021-09-28 10:59:00,198,"In countdown order:5. Devle Dog or Little Cleo (Cop-E-Cat honorable mention)While I have way too many spoons...and sometimes not enough...and I like most of them. I really like the Eppinger Devle Dog, which is very similar to a Little Cleo. It has more thump for its size than other spoons. The cop-e-cat is slimming but very similar. I caught my only musky on a 4/5 oz orange crush cop-e-cat.4. Perch Shad Rap (large size)A consistent producer for me when you have enough depth to stay out the weeds with it. The only downside is that balsa and esox teeth don't mix that well, but its almost part of the fun to see how a mangled lure will still catch fish.3. Rattlin' Rap (or other lipless rattling lure)While I don't have a favorite color on this one, I love how versatile they are. As long as you are disciplined with your retrieve, you can cover any depth 1' to 12' or more. You often get a lot of incidental walleye and smallmouth as well.2. ChatterbaitMy new near favorite, after my recent trip to Wine Lake. As I posted in that report, their like a cross between a spinner, a lipless rattler, and a swimbait jig. I love fishing spoons because you can often trigger a strike (or a 2nd strike after a tap or a miss) by dropping the lure back. I love baits that hum (spinner) or buzz (lipless) because of the feedback and they work. Chatterbaits have both of these attributes!1. Mepps #5 Aglia, undressed with metallic bladeEvery time I go out for pike, somebody in the boat starts with this lure. In Wine and Wabaskang Lakes, a plain undressed hook seems to work better than a squirrel or bucktail, though we'll often add a small twister tail for a little extra wiggle. I also favor silver/nickel blades over brass/gold/copper, but I like them both more than painted blades. I've netter personal best pike for my cousin (2011, 38-39""), dad (2016, 38-39""), and mom (2021, three times in one trip, 32.5"", then 38.5"", then 41.5"") with this lure. Its great for so many reasons!"

Its great for so many reasons!It of lures out there.I mainly muskie fish but do get in on some pike action and have found the Joe Boucher slop master lure to be about the best.If throwing it in weed beds its the best lure in that situation as it comes through about anything.Works great on the rock piles as well.Small pike will eat it to and has one single hook for releasing fish.Worth a look if you fish pike and muskies."
6600222,NM_Trout,2021-09-29 14:01:00,1091,"Great list! I was surprised to see that my top lures for pike were somewhat overlapping with your list. I have fished a similar color spoon as the 5 of diamonds with great success. This one was the same yellow, with red jagged streaks in it. We nicknamed it a bloody egg, and have been unable to find it in stores again. I've never tried that hinged rapala, nor the Mepps spinner. I will be bringing those along next trip to give a try. Man... I'm Jones'ing for a fishing trip."
6600326,guidedfishing,2021-09-30 06:28:00,531,"Typically don't target Pike that much but here is what I usually reach for when I do. 1. No 5 Mepps Agila, dressed or undressed, chrome or bronze blade as long as it has some yellow and red in it. 2. Red Eye, Chrome and metallic blue 3. Little Cleo same color or with yellow and Chrome. 4. 5 of Diamonds daredevil 5. Metallic blue Rapala Husky Jerk I actually prefer stick baits but when it comes to pike I prefer a single hook for easier release, I get no joy out of trying to separate two or three sets of treble hooks from a pike. The Mepps spinner is typically the first thing I put on when casting for pike. If I really feel the need then I put on the Husky jerk knowing I will be dealing with the multiple treble. My son always starts with a 5 of diamonds its amazing that dang spoon, I have seen him catch walleye, lake trout, and pike on that darn thing. enjoy"

Some great lures called out - I have never thought of using a rattle trap stule bait - one is going in the box for our 2022 trip for sure Cheers Andrew"
6598848,gordy28,2021-09-22 14:58:00,437,One of me earliest posts has also been pretty popular - it was my top 5 walleye lures to bring on a fly inHave re done my list but this time for pike. Generally we primarily fish walleye but over the years we have caught some good pike - both on purpose and while fishing for walleye lolMy 5 may not be your 5 which is part of the discussion - interested in hearing others must haves for sure. I know a lot of people love the Dr Spoons - I just havent fished with them enough to put them above a Len Thompson and so on(Edited: I removed the link to your blog/site.....because that is against the rules. If ALL you wanted to do was share your lure choice......you could have just typed it.....and you still can.)CheersAndrew

My biggest pike was caught in a wacky rigged senko off the dock’
