544055,Guest,2004-11-04 10:13:00,0,"Was up there the last of August without alot of success. The weather didn't cooperate at all, so we start going to Deception Bay and fishing lower part of Lac Seul. After a few days, the weather did improve as did the fishing, however, we were doing good out of Deception and didn't get back to Minnitaki or Abrams with the better weather. Went to all my favorite spots on Minnitaki and Abrams but could only catch small walleyes. I'm talking 12"" or less. But again the weather was a big factor. Will be going back up there on these two lakes for opener in 05. eyesnatcher"
