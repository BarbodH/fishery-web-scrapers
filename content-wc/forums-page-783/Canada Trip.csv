The last time I went to Lake of the Woods (1989) we had a great trip, caught smallmouth till we got tired and learned how to catch walleye. We went to the Sioux Narrows area. I believe we stayed at Red Indian. Since then, I believe several of our friends have been going to Tomahawk Lodge. Any other recommendations on Lake of the Woods or other locations. Pike, Musky, bass, or walleye; they are all fun to me. We do not need a meal plan. Would like to stay on the lake so some of the family can stay in if they desire. Thanks."

If I were you, I would let your wife and kids ride in the car or SUV with you and not leave them in the boat. Riding in the boat is I assume illegal and would probably be bumby!"

544042,walley250,2004-11-03 09:10:00,161,If your wife and kids can handle cold weather and possibe rough waters I would recomend somwhere on the Winipeg water system. The red river in selkerk would probly be your best bet. Many 10 lb fish are taken every year. Call the cat-eye outfitter there. I was there this year and our boat caught 150 fish in two days and 3 fish that went over 10.

It's a 10 lake chain near Vermilion Bay, just north of Eagle Lake. Very family friendly. Nice swimming beach and raft. Lodge has pool and pingpong tables, pinball, free popcorn, satellite, DVD player with loads of movies. Offer American or Housekeeping plans. Cabins are clean, with microwaves, showers, etc. Lakes have walleyes, muskie, lake trout, some northerns, and smallies. My wife and kids, plus my mom and dad love it there. They have a website, check it out"
