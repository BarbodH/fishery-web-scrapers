All cabins have showers, flush toilets etc. Fishing has been excellent overall thru the years, and the trip is very affordable. Try www.lundyscamp.com"

544195,Guest,2004-11-17 07:46:00,0,"The origianl post asked for lodges in Nowthwestern Canada which would be British Columbia, on the pacific ocean. Excellent fishing. Everyboy so far has recommended lodges in Northwestern Ontario."
544200,Guest,2004-11-17 15:13:00,0,First I want to thank everyone so far for the information. I am actually looking for some where in northwest ontario like everyone is giving me. I just don't want to go to Wabaskang because I go to Wine lake every other year and go across that water. I would like to try something different.

544225,Guest,2004-11-20 23:09:00,0,You could try a new place that my wife and I are just constucting. We have just two cabins. Located on Lac Seul about 15 miles north of the Wine Lake landing. I was the Johnson out board dealer for the last 25 years and Wine lake were my customers. Herb and Ann would be good reference's. We call ourselves Cherob Resort
544228,Guest,2004-11-21 22:28:00,0,"Or try Agate Bay Lodge, http://www.agatebaylodge.com Variety of fishing options, small quiet camp, at reasonable prices."
544230,Guest,2004-11-22 13:09:00,0,"Rob, Can you send me any info on your cabins. Or how about a direct email. My email is [email protected] Thanks"
544233,Guest,2004-11-22 17:31:00,0,A group of us were to Cherob resort in June and were very satisfied with the cabin and the owners Rob and Cheryl. My brothers Johnson gave him some trouble the first day and Rob came down to the dock and knew the trouble right away and went back to his workshop and brought a few tools and fixed it in a couple min. Was some blockage in the carburator. When we checked out Bob was gone but we gave Cheryl an extra $20.00 to give to Rob. Did your wife give you the $20.00?
544020,Guest,2004-11-01 15:50:00,0,"I'm looking for a resort in Northwest Canada for my wife and myself. Some stipulations are that she isn't that much on fishing but she enjoy's the outdoors. She likes to fish when their is action. Also indoor plumbing. The place I go in Canada doesn't have this so it turns her off on Canada. Also, she wants a place that will take pets. She has a hard time leaving the dog at home. Any ideas please reply. Scott"
544024,rebelrn2001,2004-11-01 21:10:00,1563,"Not sure about the pets but you could look at www.merkelscamp.com My wife and I have been going there for the last 6 years or so. We like it, it's not too far from Dryden/McDonalds/a church/WalMart. About 1/2 hr or so. The fishing is not bad, at times it is very good. You can go to about 6 different lakes via slews w/your boat or camp boat. I now have the lake maps on my GPS (not the best map but at least I know where I am) and have ventured farther than before (last year--too bad the weather was TERRIBLE so we left 2 days early). The operators own the place and live there year round. If you email them tell Terry and Merril that Dan and Sue from Green Bay sent you and say hello. They are very nice and we really like it. The cabins are very nice, have two bedrooms and TV and full bath."
544028,Fred_G,2004-11-02 11:11:00,908,"Here's one of my favorites, www.tallpinescamp.com. Pets are not a problem and the camp is very nice. Check it out."
544033,Guest,2004-11-02 17:17:00,0,"A place that my wife and I have been going to for the last 4 years now is Tomahawk Resort(www.tomahawkresort.com) on Lake of the Woods. It is a very clean, modern resort with beautiful cottages. You pay a little more than other resorts in the area, but after you've been there you feel it is worth all of what you paid. Everyone there is very friendly and the dock staff point you to the hot spots everyday. Sioux Narrows has some really nice shops which I'm sure your wife would enjoy and Kenora is only 50 miles away. Last year we drove up to Kenora on a rainy day and went to the Museum they have an excellent display with all sorts of history of Kenora and Lake of the Woods with quite a display of old outboards. I would highly reccommend the Sioux Narrows area in particular Tomahawk Resort."
544037,Guest,2004-11-02 23:54:00,0,"An extremely nice place is Lake of the woods Lodge http://www.lakeofthewoodslodge.com in nestor falls. Fishing is great for walleye, bass, pike muskie etc, and they also love pets. They have a few (well trained) dogs of their own. Been their a few times myself. Ruth and Scott Hurst and family are fantastic people. A nice rustic, but modern facility. Log structure. excellent boats/motors. Not to forget the meals are top notch too. They also offer Housekeeping packages."
