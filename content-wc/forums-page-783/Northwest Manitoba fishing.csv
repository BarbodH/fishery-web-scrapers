The fishing was good, but at times they commercial fished that lake pretty heavy. I'm now planning to take my two adult sons up to that same area and would like some recent information -- or rather advise on just where to go next spring. All those years, we used to go on the last week of May and the weather was great every year - and before the mosquitoes came out. I've done some research on the Internet but haven't turned up as much as I'd have liked. Any information or advise is appreciated. Thanks in advance, wjw"
