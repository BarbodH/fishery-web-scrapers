It said it was 11.6 lbs. I used the legth and girth, but I have been looking at other fish on the ten pound club on this site, and the demensions didnt meet the weight they said it was. I know how fishing stories go, the fish is always bigger. But this was true with 5 fish. Just seeing if this weight caculator is corect or is my fish bigger than thought. Any input on this is appreciated."

544136,Burr,2004-11-11 12:20:00,8612,"The fish out of Pine Falls consistently weigh in heavier than the norm for fish of similar length caught elsewhere. However, if you used the girth measurement as well, you should be close, close enough to rely anyway. That said, large fish can still vary quite a bit. I caught a 27.5 up there this year that went 7.5. Another 27.5 was caught within 30 minutes that went 8 10oz. Don't have girth measurements to compare. The fish that left an impression up there was a measly 21 inch fish that was the fattest 21 I have ever seen. I think Steve G may have pics. The below is a 10 6oz from a few years ago in Pine Falls.https://www.walleyecentral.com/photop....php?photo=119"
544146,Backwater Eddy,2004-11-12 02:07:00,3871,"You see very ""Girthy"" walleye on the Red too. I have seen them with 20-23"" girths in the 29"" to 33"" range. Sumo walleye for sure. The fish in the Winnipeg River and Red River systems have a variety of high protein forage to chose from that builds up them tummies to sumo proportions. The Goldeye is a big time tummy builder in the Red River basin for a wide range of predators. Freshwater Drum is another prime river forage as are catfish, yup walleye do eat cats...lots of them. During cold water periods the walleye eat a lot of channel catfish and Madtom catfish while in wintering areas. Young cats are the most common forage I encounter in stomach contents while ice fishing walleye on the Red. The next most common is drum, then shiners/minnows, and/or suckers. At first ice it is very common to find frogs still high on the menu. You see frogs on the menu far into the winter on the tribs if the hatch was strong that year. One thing about a river walleye, if they have lots of forage options, they will eat them all...eagerly. Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""ED on the RED"" ><,sUMo,>"
