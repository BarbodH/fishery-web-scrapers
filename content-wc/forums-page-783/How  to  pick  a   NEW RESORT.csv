Before we book any new resort we ask the owner for names and telephone # of some of the people who stayed there the same week last year,the week before and the week after we are planning on booking. I have only ever had one owner balk at this and that was fine. We didnt pursue his resort any further. Most of the owners will supply the info without hesitation, especially with the ease of email. Making a few phone calls to these people can really be enlighting about the areas of concern you may have about where you stay. It works ....try it. It might save you some heartaches."
544154,Guest,2004-11-12 13:51:00,0,"GOOD ADVICE...... THE TRIP DEPENDS ON QUITE A BIT OF DIFFERENT INTENTIONS. IF YOU ARE STRICTLY A WALLEYE FISHERMAN, THEN LOOK FOR GOOD WALLEYE LAKES (DUH) .... I HAVE A FRIEND WHO ASKED AN OWNER IF THE PIKE FISHING WAS GOOD AND HE REPLIED ""WE HAVE PIKE AND SOME DECENT ONES TOO."" THIS TIPPED ME TO BELIEVE PIKE WAS NOT THE TOP FISH TO CATCH AT THIS LAKE. I WAS RIGHT. IT WAS A GOOD WALLEYE LAKE WITH SOME SMALL PIKE. I CAUGHT A 36"" PIKE AND THE OWNER ACTED LIKE IT WAS A 46""ER... HMMMMM I WENT TO A GOOD PIKE LAKE ONCE OVER JULY 4TH WEEKEND AND IT WAS HOTTER THAN #*&# THE PIKE WERE TOUGH TO CATCH (ALONG WITH EVERYTHING ELSE). WAS THAT THE OUTFITTERS FAULT? I HAVE BEEN TO MANY DIFFERENT LODGES ( ALL HOUSEKEEPING) AND I HAVE FOUND THAT MOST OWNERS ARE STRAIGHT-FORWARD. JUST ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS.... THEIR LIVELIHOOD DEPENDS ON YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME AND MEETING YOUR EXPECTATIONS. LASTLY, THIS IS A TRUE STORY ABOUT AFTER I TOOK MY THEN 10YR OLD SON TO NUNGESSER LAKE...I ASKED HIM WHEN WE GOT BACK ""WELL, WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE PART OF THE TRIP? THE BIG PIKE OR ALL THOSE WALLEYES? OR SEEING THE BEAR?"" HIS ANSWER? ""JUST BEING IN THE BOAT WITH YOU DAD"" :) THAT IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT!"

He saw all the Great Lakes Freighter in Duluth/Superior Harbor He saw a bear cross Highway 2 in WI He took a seaplane ride He lost a big pike or muskie when it went under the boat & broke his line Know what he said? Boy I can hardly wait to get home and tell all my friends I saw a guy with a hook in his head!! The gentleman in the cabin next to us had caught himself in the back of the head with a spoon while casting! Bellbuoy"
544163,Guest,2004-11-13 07:40:00,0,"AS the guys before me have said, ""Ask lots of questions and for referrals"". All resort owners should be used to supplying referrals. Just remember that the referrals they will be giving you should be from their best customers so they are going to really talk the place. Try to ask the referrals tough questions like what part of resort they don't like. Also ask about the resort on message boards like this one. Check them out at sport shows and listen in while they talk to other customers."

Great people , very very reasonable family oriented and awesome fishing..usually.......well - thats why Im writing this. 2 years ago. Fishing was fantastic , Walleyes were very easy to catch and we didnt have to work for any of them , from 14 - 27 inches. Water in the lake was down. Northerns were great.....many nice ones , my personal best a 40 inch 15lber on my ultralight, with a ton of 24 -30s. Best fishing anywhere in my life.Perfect weather. Last year ..Cold , rain , wind every day. The lake was up 5 ft from normal. Docks were all under water , water temps were cold , no weeds yet ( in July !) Fishing was very tough. We worked very hard every day to catch Walleyes and the Northerns were still out in deep water. All week I think we only caught 8 Northerns with the biggest being 26. Lost a big one , but that dont really count. The last day , fishing was excellant , threw more back in than we caught all week !. My point is , if we'd have went for the first time this year , I would strongly consider a new camp , but I know the potential and what the lake can produce. It was an off year for fishing in some parts of Canada and I know personally that some camps lost first time fishermen due to this. I know that we have experienced the good days , so we will return......the newbies had a very tough year to judge some of the camps and will bad mouth them and not return. One of the families at our camp are on their 26th year going there , and 2004 was the worst fishing ever. Do your research and call people who have been there ."
544166,Guest,2004-11-14 16:33:00,0,"great point catman.... i like to adventure out to new lodges.... but , truthfully, if someone wanted to get the best possible trip...they should return to a good lodge year after year and learn the lake. by the way, would you like to tell me the name ofthe above mentioned lodge? thanks,bob"
