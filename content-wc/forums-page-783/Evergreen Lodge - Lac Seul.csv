544097,Guest,2004-11-07 18:46:00,0,I will be there for the first time June 25th. What should I expect? Is the lake easy to navigate? What about evergreen itself? Any help would be appreciated.
544098,Guest,2004-11-07 20:06:00,0,They wiil give you a map with all the rocks marked. They are real easy to get along with and will help you as much as they can. If it's your 1st time there I would recomend getting a guide Shawn took us out this fall and showed us some new spots and we had been there about 6 or 8 times before. Gary does some guiding also but he is pretty busy most of the time. Frankly these are the nicest folks I've ever stayed with all of the cabins are new and I think they are getting new boats and motors for 2005.

Those of us who consider ourselves friends of Evergreen are making a valiant effort to make 2005 the best year ever by helping newcomers have one of the greatest fishing experiences at one of the best camps on Lac Seul. To achieve that positive experience we offer the following reminders: 1. DO NOT butcher an overslot walleye! (in-slot, either) 2. DO NOT drive/park on Gary's grass! In the 7 summers I've spent there, those are about the only 2 things I've seen him get very upset about. Oh, if you do have Gary take you fishing - try to let him catch the biggest one!!!!!!!"

They will help you find fish and if you take a Guide for a couple of days you will learn some awful good info. I never have had the privilege of fishing with Gary...but I bet when you catch a bigger Walleye than he does his competitive juices start to flow. When my wife showed him the picture of her 31 1/2"" Walleye she got at Evergreen last year you could see that Gary was smiling but his teeth were clenched a little...just Kidding , Gary."
