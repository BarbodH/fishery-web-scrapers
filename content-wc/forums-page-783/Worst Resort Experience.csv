544117,Guest,2004-11-10 07:46:00,0,"Everyone posts their favorite place to fish. I'd like to hear some horror story trips people have gone on. The worst story I was almost involved in was a fly-in I almost put money down on but ended up thankfully not a participant. Only three guys were going and and the trip cost about $2200 per person. When they flew in to Canada, customs arrested one of the three at the Winnepeg airport because he had a Felony on his record. He stayed a night in a lockup, and had to pay big money to go home on another flight the next day. The other two guys were not allowed on the float plane until they were paid in full, which included the full amount for the guy that was detained at the border. At the time they booked there was a four person minimum for the cabin, and he gave them a break by letting three go. He was not going to accept just the two persons paying. The two begrudgingly ponied up the $3300 each and to the lake. Forest fires meant that the guides they were supposed to have were not available and continuous 100 degree weather meant hard fishing. THey caught about 5 to 10 fish per day (biggest was a 34 inch pike)and that was all. The resort owner would not refund any money even though they paid for guides that did not show up, and billed them $60 per case of beer for 6 cases. All total, they spent about $4500 per person for five days of fishing and caught about 50 fish."

When we crossed the Border at Int Falls one of the guys made a comment in jest about a Machine Gun we had and they tore us completly down and we lost four hours. About an hour and a half after we left the Border we hit a Moose and totaled out our Van. We had to rent another Van and we took off for Red Lake where we were to fly out of. About 20 miles south of Red Lake the engine blew up in the rental Van and we had to pay a ton of money to get it towed to Red Lake. Once we got to Red Lake and got to the airplane we figured that the crap had to be over with. We loaded up the plane and took off for our 1 hour flight to our Outpost destination. About 40 minutes into the flight the pilot had to make an emergency landing on a lake that was about the size of a small throw rug. We had lost oil pressure and also had to change our underwear after landing. Another plane came to pick us up and we finally got to our Outpost camp at 6:00 that evening when we should have been there at 8 that morning. It started raining about the time we got our gear in the cabin so we just unpacked and ate supper , had a few beers and went to sleep. the next morning we headed out to go fishing and found that only one of the three motors on the boats would start. We tried everthing we knew and nothing worked. We called the outfitter and he told us he would be there on Monday (The next day) and he would bring two different motors. We had to look silly with one boat towing two others to fishing spots. Thank God we caught some fish . When we got back to the cabin that night the last guy out had forgot to deadbolt the door and a Bear had gotten in the cabin and I have never seen a bigger mess in my life. The next day when the outfitter got to the lake we packed up and went home. We had just had the worst four days of our lives. We laugh about it now and our luck has been much better since than but that was our trip from ####."
544125,Guest,2004-11-10 13:50:00,0,A FEW YEARS AGO A FRIEND OF MINE AND THREE OTHER GUYS WENT TO A BOAT IN ISLAND CAMP OUT OF RED LAKE. THEY HAD TWO INDIAN GUIDES WITH THEM. AFTER SETTING UP AND PREPARING FOR THE NEXT DAY THEY WENT TO BED. WHEN THEY WOKE UP THE NEXT DAY THE INDIANS WERE GONE AS WELL AS ALL THIER FISHING GEAR AND FOOD. THEY WERE ON THE ISLAND FOR THREE DAYS BEFORE SOMEONE CAME BY AND HELPED THEM OUT.
544127,rebelrn2001,2004-11-10 20:01:00,1563,"WOW, I don't feel so bad now. A few years ago my wife and I decided to pick a different place to go in fall. We normally went to Winnie but decided on Canada in fall too (we go to Canada in spring). We talked to a guy at the All Canada Show in Green Bay. One of the Packers goes to his place and he talked how nice it was (I'm not going to mention the lake or lodge because I kind of feel for the owner, they just bought the place and I think they were/are tring to fix up the place). We got to the island lodge and the cabin was about as big as me....well not much bigger. About 6 1/2 feet tall and about 8-9 feet wide...maybe 14 feet deep. The 'log' cabin had holes in it that were stuffed with tin foil to keep out the wind/bugs/critters. The floor also had holes, albeit small ones but you could see the ground. On the second or third day of not catching many fish (I was just starting to find some decent spots), I was taking my usual midmorning nap (after the nap my wife comes out with me as I go out fishing too early for her), I heard a scream. A mouse had run across the floor by her feet. Well, I laid back down and then I heard her crying. That was it. We left a couple hours later and went to our usual spring lake that was only about 2 hrs away. We haven't had the guts to go to any other lodges since."
544128,rebelrn2001,2004-11-10 20:02:00,1563,"Oh yeah, we had to pay the full weeks amount less $50 plus the cost of the other place (not knocking the first place...he needs his money too....boy does he need money to fix up the place)."

544137,Guest,2004-11-11 12:49:00,0,"This occurred 18 years ago. My brother-in-law and I went to a sport show and found , what we thought, was a great place. It actually was fairly expensive. We were to call when we go to the closest town and the owner would meet us. and lead us out to camp. We were told it was an excellent road and when we arrived we would have a brand new cabin. The road was horrible and he led us to the most run down, disgusting looking place . We asked about the only other cabin there, a brand new one, and he told us that the guys were from Wisc. beat us and they got the new one. Since they had told us that the camp had all modern conveniences, i was perturbed to find no running water. The owner looked at me stupidly and said"" You have a whole lake!"" The cabin, of course had no water, no shower, no toilet, and was so filthy, it was scary. The front door hung on the hinges. After we finally found a motor that would fit the boat ( named the Titanic, old metal walk thru hull), we proceded to not catch a fish. The owner had let a gun with the Wisc. boys and told them that there were bear around, but just to shoot above them because he had a bear camp in the fall. To make a long story short, we were talking to the group, a bear came from around the corner and after awhile decided to attack us. He was shot but wounded, so we all ran down and got in our boats and headed out of danger. When we did catch some fish, we had to have a sentry, with gun, guarding the fish house. Later in the week, the Titanic sunk, luckily by the dock. I have visited their web site and it looks like we were there in the infant stages, because it looks very nice. I have rambled, but basically only told you the big highlites. There were several other things that happened. It was a trip from ####."

544148,Burr,2004-11-12 07:52:00,8612,"Well, this is not a resort experience, but may be valuable to share with others, I made a huge mistake, unknowingly, and fortunately did not have to pay the price. Everyone, please be aware of Canadian license categories. I think we are all aware there are resident, and non-resident licenses for all states and Canada. Be aware Canada has some additional categories. Specifically, ""Non-resident - resident of Canada"" ""Non-resident - Non-resident of Canada"" There's a long story with the above this year, long and short of it are the Wildlife management officers understood the mistake from the start, and it NEVER crossed my mind there would be anything deeper than simply non-resident and resident licenses. We actually corrected the person issuing the licence to not give us the resident license he was filling out, and when I saw the word Non-resident on the license I did purchase, I didn't look any closer to see it was followed by ""Resident of Canada"" I try really hard to follow the rules as a good sportsman, just goes to show you can't be over confident."
544150,Guest,2004-11-12 08:18:00,0,"Our worst experience happened a few years back when we went into a Drive-To outfitters in Quebec. After an 8 hour drive to get there, we emptied out of our vehicles, relieved to FINALLY be there. The last hour in was on some rough, rough gravel road that rattled your fillings and kept you on your toes dodging large rocks sticking up. We were in the process of exchanging $$$$ with the outfitter, when he informed us that he was fresh out of Quebec liscenses.....which he had advertised and had told us over the phone were to be available there. His solution? Get back in your vehicles and backtrack 30 miles to another outfitters place that had some liscenses available. We couldn't believe it. He had a couple of young guys there for help....we figured he'd send them to get the liscenses while we were getting unpacked and organized at the camp. NOPE. He made it plain that we must have liscenses to fish....no arguements from us, we understood the need to be properly liscensed before we started fishing....but the payments and paperwork stopped right then and there as far as he was concerned....and we were sent back out on the road for our liscenses. The only good part of the whole liscense ordeal was the gourgeous young lady in the low cut top that sold us our liscenses at the other outfitters. All in all, a very unprofessional and downright un-friendly start with our host for the week, it left a bad taste in our mouths. We still had a good time and caught walleye, but have not been back there since. What a way to start the week."
544227,Guest,2004-11-21 18:47:00,0,"about 15 years ago, went to a lodge in eastern ontario. met the outfitter at the harrisburg, pa outdoor show. talked a good fight. drove about 18 hours to a small town train station. foleyet ontario, i think. anyway, got on a railroad train car with our stuff for about a half hour ride into the bush. got dumped off in the middle of nowhere beside a lake. half hour wait in the rain later, a barge shows up to pick us up. 5 miles later we arrive at the lodge and get unpacked. cabins are sparce. that's ok. outhouse up the path. that's ok. hand pump well in the yard in front of the cabin. that's ok. had to boil all drinking water. that's ok. now out to the lake. fished all week and caught zero walleye. zero. good day was a dozen hammer handles per boat. 2 walleye caught in the camp all week. lodge ran out of minnows (they trapped) about every other day. there was supposed to be some sort of norwegian sauna at the camp to clean up in. well, the best i can tell, it was a tub full of cold lake water and a tub full of hot lake water. poured it on yourself with sauce pans. supposed to fire it up every other day. fired it up twice all week. needless to say we were raunchy. got mosquito bite on the back of the neck that got infected. probably due to lack of sanitation. still bear that scar today. had a skunk that lived behind our cabin. never sprayed us, but threatened us several times. needless to say, i swore off canada for about 10 years till my brother in law introduced me to lac seul."
544144,Guest,2004-11-11 17:00:00,0,"I was thinking about this subject the other day after reading the ""Lac Seul Hatchery"" posts. I think it is a good idea to tell the stories of the not so fortunate trips to help alert others to possible mistakes. I went on a boat-in with my dad in June a few years ago to a lake on the Smoothwater Provincial Park in Ontario. Since it was June and a remote lake I figured it should be pretty good and wasn't too expensive. There were a few other resorts on the lake and I soon found out that everyone from miles around fished the same couple spots and only in the evening. For some reason( I was told acid rain) the fish were scarce and only showed up at these few spots at dusk. So we tried everywhere for the ""excellent"" pike and bass fishing during the day and most nights and hit the walleye spots in the evening with the crowds. My dad caught a 17"" smallmouth at 1 AM on a shad rap and that was it for pike and bass. We managed to get a few walleye around 17"" trolling Shadlings one cloudy rainy day in the afternoon and by the 6th evening managed to actually get about 8 small walleye on minnows in the prime spot. Some groups caught only a couple fish the entire week at the resorts, it was TOUGH fishing. The place ran out of minnows early and I spent a couple hours a day at the dock catching minnows for the evening fishing. There were no other disasters other than the the worst fishing I ever had on a remote Canadian trip, but I learned a lesson about checking a spot out a bit more thouroghly before commiting to a trip, because as we know there are many prime spots waiting there in Canada if you can only pick the right one."
