We go to Caribou Falls Camp on Umfreville Lake (on the English river) so I have no experience with Long Lake. They are a very reputible outfit though, so I would think it is first class. Paul"

As you know the wind can be a issue on the umpf, and I have had nothing but great fishing and service from the Halleys, I was just looking to see if any one can give any info on long lake ."
