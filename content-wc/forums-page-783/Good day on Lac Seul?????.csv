544170,naughty2lose,2004-11-14 22:11:00,4,I live right beside lac Seul in Ear Falls town limits and i just go 10 feet from my house and catch my limit of walleye in 1/2 hour most days. Lac Seul awesome lake to live by and fishing is great. You do catch big fish but i throw them back i preffer to eat the smaller ones. Since the 4 apiece limit came on fishing gets better here every year.
544173,Guest,2004-11-15 11:23:00,0,"Had the best day I have ever had fishing in my life on Lac Seul this year. I was fishing with my Uncle who lives in Ear Falls during the summer and we were fishing in the area of Lac Seul that used to be called Fish Gut Bay before they burned down the camp. It was in June and we were dragging some Shad Rap cranks working Bays and windy shorelines. I caught three Walleye over 28"" and a Pike that was 41"" plus we caught many other nice Walleye and some short Pike. It was the three biggest Walleye I have ever caught and the biggest pike of my life......What a day ...what a Lake."
543917,Guest,2004-10-25 08:52:00,0,"We have fished lac Seul for the last three years. There are 6 of us with two boats in our group and we fish the south central part of the lake. During the last three years our Walleye numbers are as follows for each of our five day trips. 2002 977 Walleye Biggest 29 1/2"" 2003 1366 Walleye 29"" 2004 805 Walleye 29 1/2"" I would say we catch more fish in the slot than any other size and would estimate that 10% to 15% are above the slot."
543978,Guest,2004-10-29 15:23:00,0,"kevin, now, that's really nice fishing. 35 fish per day per guy over three years. good size too. wish i kept such good records. do you stay at silver water wheel lodge?"
543982,Guest,2004-10-29 19:53:00,0,We stay at Black Bay Outpost out of Lac Seul Lodge.
543994,Guest,2004-10-30 19:10:00,0,"Just curious how you fish the river. We've never been able to do much in the river the second week of June. We have hit a few good days in years past, but usually the fishing is pretty slow. Any recommendations about where, with what, etc. I heard that they are extending the dates that the river is closed to fishing to later in the spring so those of us that go up the second week of June won't be able to fish it anyway, but just curious."
544065,Planocat,2004-11-05 02:36:00,473,Are there any drive-in RV campgrouds with full hookups and launching/docking facilities on Lac Seul that you would recommend? Thanks for any help. Planocat

543855,Guest,2004-10-19 13:43:00,0,"lac seul is the only place i've ever fished that i will move to get away from fish. if we get into too many of the 13-15 inchers, we head out to greener pastures. taking my baby brother (45) up this year for his first time. i really look forward to putting him on the best fishing of his life. odds are that i will be a hero after this trip."
543858,Guest,2004-10-19 14:41:00,0,Where do you fish on Lac Seul. I am going to the Ear Falls end next year and would really like to communicate with a knowledgeable person that fishes the NW end
543859,Guest,2004-10-19 15:11:00,0,"hump1, don't know how knowledgable i am. i mostly fish steamboat bay. you won't have to travel that far though. i'll fish around goose island, steamboat and occasionally venture down to mckenkie bay. i don't mess with the sanctuary or sawmill cause we go so late-late july. those areas are great early. you really need to talk with the locals and your lodge owner when you go. i always figure that when i go to mckenzie that i have travelled over top of millions of walleye on the way. lots of great fish are caught right out in front of the lodges in ear falls. lots and lots of small islands hold tons of fish. they are everywhere. just pick a windward side or point and have at them. lots of walleye are caught around lunker point by some guys. humps hold lots of fish my time of year. might want to hire a guide for a day; could be money well spent if you are new to the area. best of luck to you. whit"
543862,Guest,2004-10-19 15:29:00,0,I have to agree with Whit....the best place to catch Walleye in Lac Seul is on the windward side of any island with a jig and minnow at the bottom of the lake. Even my friend Euker can catch fish on Lac Seul.....his wont be very big or will he have very many but he can hold my fish for his picture. Book any Resort on Lac Seul and catchem.
543872,Guest,2004-10-20 08:03:00,0,Thanks for the info.
543874,Guest,2004-10-20 10:26:00,0,"Great information you all have provided on Lac Seul fishing. My family and I have been fishing Rainy Lake for the past 6 years and the fishing has become OK, but the last couple of years kinda slow. We are really more focused on the catch-n-release of Northerns and SM Bass, but also enjoy catching Walleyes, but don't really fish hard for them. How would you rate the Northern and SM Bass fishing on Lac Seul? Are there any other areas in this vicinity that you would recommend as better Northern or SM Bass fisheries? Thanks and appreciate all the great feedback. Ron"
543875,Mike Kansas,2004-10-20 11:43:00,1463,"Ron, Our group used to fish Northrens every day and 200 fish days were common. We still catch some nice Pike but it is when we are fishing for Walleye. We have seen a steady increase every year in the Smallmouth we catch. This year we caught 57 Smallmouth while fishing for Walleye. I can remember 5 years ago when we might catch a dozen or so Smallmouth. We dont fish for either species but I believe that if one wanted to he could do very good on both Pike and Smallies."
543884,Guest,2004-10-21 09:10:00,0,"We fish Lac Seul in the middle of July and our group loves to fish for Pike. We hit the weedbeds hard with spinnerbaits and buzzbaits and we also work the weedbed edges with sluggos and large cranks. We spend 8 to 10 hours a day on the lake with two in a boat and 200 to 300 fish days per boat are not uncommon. Most of the Pike we catch will be 25"" to 35"" with an occasional 36"" plus. We have caught some over 40"" but they are the exception and not the rule. We like to look for bays with wood and weeds with some wind on it close to deep water. That type of area seems to be the most consistent producer for pike. Last year was a little slower than normal for us but I think that was because of the unusael wheather we had all summer. The biggest fish we got last year was 40"" on a 3/4 oz red/white spinnerbait. I like double willow leaf blades on spinners because of more flash. Dont fish Smallmouth so cant help there."
543903,orchard frank,2004-10-23 09:45:00,1900,"I've been going to L.Seul for the last 12 yrs. average 2wks or more a season. You are going to catch a lot of fish, but 100-150 18"" and bigger a day seems far fetched to me. Numbers possibly, but a lot of 14"" thrown in. Always a chance at large fish, over 27"" (measured)are present but not abundant. As mentioned, pike and SM can be great, but not everywhere, not all the time, its still fishing. Expect a wonderful experience, great fishing, and memories. I've seen people disappointed that they ""only"" caught 25 fish today with the biggest being 24"". I've had many, many all-time greatest days on Lac Seul, but they are not every day. Also, be prepared for bad weather, you can get a blow that will keep you in or close to camp for 3 days straight. Lac Seul can be much more than numbers if you let it. Good Luck"
543907,Walleye_Slayer,2004-10-24 09:24:00,134,i second orchard frank. lots of numbers and are starting to see more in the slot. i think some of the numbers posted are excessive. been fishing out of ear falls going on 28 years now and have had my greatest days. but if you fish out of ear falls you are motoring across big water and when the winds get above 20 mph which is most of the time in the spring. you had better have your wits about you. been out on lac suel in 4-7 foot waves and that is not an enjoyable ride. nice thing about coming out of ear falls is you can always duck into the river for good walleye action and wind protection. also during real windy periods the lake will boil up so bad it will turn the bays to a dark clay color and then you might as well pack it up and move to another spot. i think the fish are still there but i don't think they can see or smell. just my 2 cents on the nwestern part of the suel.

543820,Mike Kansas,2004-10-18 15:00:00,1463,"Good day on Lac Seul would be spent with a couple of my fishing buddies going from point to point catching those Walleye. Some days three of us catch 50 per boat some days 300 per boat ...average day 100/150 fish in the 18"" to 27"" with a 29iner thrown in. Best day I have ever had was three of us in a boat and we caught 400+++ Walleye with 80% of them being over the slot. It was a perfect June day and the girls were hungry."

543821,Guest,2004-10-18 16:26:00,0,"my son and i fish the ear falls end of the lake. we do not fish hard; spend maybe 8 hours a day max fishing. we figure a fish every 10 minutes each is a pretty good day. we figure that 15-17 inch fish are normal, and catch maybe 1/4 to 1/3 slot and above fish. we catch quite a few 22 to 26 inch fish with an occasional 28-29 incher. we eat well, drink a lot of beer and play a lot of euchre."

543850,Guest,2004-10-19 08:12:00,0,"Been on Lac Seul for the last 5 years and while we have days of varying numbers and size of fish we dont ever have any bad days with low numbers. Seems like our average day with two fisherman in a boat would be in the area of 75 to 100 fish per day. The thing we like best about Lac Seul is that while everey day is good some days are fantastic. Not unusael to come back to camp with a Lac Seul rookie in your boat and he will chirp all night to the others about how he just had the best day he has ever had catching Walleye. Cant help but think that one reason that Lac Seul is such a great fishery is the slot limits. We only keep 17""/18"" fish and they eat good. Once in a while we catch a bonus Northren in the 12/15 lb range and the last couple of years the Smallmouths have become a nice bonus."
