Subject to checking the rules, my off the cuff suggestion is the ID be a passport with photo or a an ID with a photo in it and a birth certificate. Also the signed notarized statement from the parents or guardians granting permission for the child to travel to the United States. You also might want to add a line about authorizing seeking of medical care if necessary. If the child is to enroll in school in the US, you might need authorization for that. Note the authorization should be signed by both parents before a notary. Again, I suggest you and the parents check Canadian rules for such travel and govern your actions accordingly."
544138,Guest,2004-11-11 13:16:00,0,This brings up another question. We will be taking our kids and grandkids to Canada next year for the first time...9 and 10 years old. The only picture ID I can think of is a passport. Will that be necessary or is there another alternative?
