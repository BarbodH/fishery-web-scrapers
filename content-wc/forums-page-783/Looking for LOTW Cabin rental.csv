New Moon Lodge and Grassy Narrows Lodge are 8-9 miles to the north of Tamarack and both are open pretty much through Oct. By the way, Tamarack and Grassy have the same owner."

Just find it more comfortable and friendly. Made a trip the 3rd week of October this fall and I believe they were open until nearly the end of October before closing up. They have a website, just google them. F.N."
