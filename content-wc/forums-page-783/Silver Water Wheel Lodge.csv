543895,Thomas O,2004-10-22 06:07:00,143,"I've been reading posts about Lac Seul for some time now and I have to make a trip up there before I retire. I have decided on booking a trip at Silver Water Wheel Lodge. I know it seems a bit spendy but it may be the only time I get to go. The trip will be just my wife and myself.She fishes Lake Erie with me all summer so she knows how to catch walleyes. I will be driving from Ann Arbor, Michigan and was wondering if anyone can tell me the best route to take? One stipulation I had to make was to go sometime in July. In a normal season what is the weather like and how are the bugs,( mosquitos, blackflies). Do you ned a head net or other protection. For others who have fished at this lodge what should I look forward to. Is a handheld GPS required to find your way around or is it easy to find your way around. Being that I fish Lake Erie all summer I depend on my GPS to find different locations and old spots that are good walleye locations. I haven't fished inland lakes in years even though Lac Seul is a huge body of water I will have to depend on a guide for a day or two to get around. Thanks for any info and can't wait for my first Lac Seul trip. Tom O"
543896,tlars,2004-10-22 07:21:00,137,"I spent 5 nights/4days at SWWL in September this year. What a place! The service was unbelievable. The fishing was great. I'd suggest leaving your boat at home and using their guide service. It's not easy to find your way around as a first timer. They fish out of Lund 18"" Pro V's. Good shore lunches. A reservation for next year in prime season could be tough. They turn down many, many groups each year because they're booked full. Tom Larson"
543897,Guest,2004-10-22 07:29:00,0,"I have gone last week of July through first week in August and the bugs on the water are not bad at all. On shore you are fine untill the sun goes down...then you have to stay indoors. While we played poker last year a guy went on the porch just to get a cooler of beer, and at least 50 flying vampires came in and were on the ceiling by the lights. The door was open for only a few seconds. This is why you have to drink a lot of beer on fishing trips...to replenish the fluid loss from the mosquitos. You need a GPS for two reasons. First is for navigation. It is a big lake with lots of islands to get lost behind. Second, if you are getting a guide for the first day or two, you will want to mark the midlake humps on your GPS to go back to. I get a guide for the first two days on all my trips to find the pattern. They will put you on the fish at SWW and your lunch will be great. I have not stayed there because I own my own boat and I like to cook my own food, but I have known people who have gone to SWW and they are a first rate operation. Good luck."
543898,Mike Kansas,2004-10-22 08:22:00,1463,Fished SWWL for the first time last August. I would suggest you leave your boat at home and fish with their Guides all the time. They have daily meetings between the Guides and the owner and exchange information that literally assures thier guests that you will be on fish all the time. They have all the routes to fishing spots on GPS and if you take your own boat and dont know where you are at all times it is a lake that takes pride in removing lower units. Fishing with the Guides will catch you fish and allow a relaxing trip for you and your wife. Enjoy and get your reservations ASAP.
543899,Thomas O,2004-10-22 10:21:00,143,"Thanks for the replies. Are the guides at SWWL included in the price that they state for a weeks stay or are they extra. I couldn't figure out if they are included or its 120.00 a day over and above the quoted price. I will be leaving my boat at home for this trip and will be using theirs. Sounds like I better rserve soon for next year.As far as tackle, we are really only interested in walleyes or smallmouths so what do you recommend.We use jigs, bottom bouncers and crawler harnesses and crankbaits on Erie. From what I've read here,jigging seems the way to go but what are your best methods. I love to jig but I mostly troll on Erie because thats the best way for numbers of fish. I really just want to relax and get away for a nice vacation and catch a few fish for shore lunch. I will release almost all walleyes that I won't be eating there because Erie provides me with plenty for my freezer here. I bet they taste a mite better up there but I'm not complaining with the ones out of Erie. Oh yeah, do you think driving up through the Upper Peninsula and west through Duluth and on to International Falls will be my best bet or should I go down through Chiago and up into Wisconsin and then into Minnesota and on Northward.Thanks again for the info and I'm sure I'll be asking more questions in the future. Tom O"
543900,Guest,2004-10-22 10:35:00,0,"Tom O'Harris, Let me tell you first, getting in next July at SWWL will be next to impossible! You would be on a waiting list for sure. That doesn't mean you shouldn't make contact and inquire. Do you like fishing in September or May? This may be more realistic for the 2005 season. Yes, all guides are included in those prices, and yes you should use the guide service everyday, and leave your boat at home. Guides much prefer guiding from their own boat. No, you don't need a bug jacket or anything like that. There is just a few squitters an hour before and after dusk. GPS is completely up to you. You don't need it at all, but some people like it to look at when driving in the boat. Good Luck"
543919,Guest,2004-10-25 11:41:00,0,"If you can get in to SWWL, your in for a treat. While I have not made the drive from Ann Arbor directly to Lac Seul, I have made the drive from Ann Arbor to Chicago and the drive from Ann Arbor to the UP. I make the drive up from Iowa via Madison, so I know the route from that point up pretty well. If I was in your shoes, I would make the drive to Chicago, shoot to Madison and then continue to Duluth and on up. Do not drive directly through Chicago via 90/94, but do the route around the city and you will be in great shape. More traffic, but better roads, faster travel times, less deer. I would love to see you in SWWL (I go in June) because there would be nothing more fun to outfish a Wolverine. Go Badgers! The rates that SWWL has posted include a guide. As of last year your welcome to take a boat out after supper (no guide) and in July the GPS might be useful for finding some mid-system humps, but its not necessary because post supper fishing is usually at pretty defined and easily found spots (at least in June) I hope you get in! First class resort all the way!. Now, Mr Ann Arbor, repeat after me...Go Badgers!"
543939,Stehle,2004-10-26 11:06:00,95,"The fishing group that I'm with goes to Savant Lake each June. We start out of Fort Wayne Indiana. We have found that it is quicker and easier to drive to the Sioux and take 17 all the way to Ignace than going through Chicago. 17 is a very good highway and the view around the North shore of Lake Superior is awesome at times. The only drawback is watching for moose at dusk through night. We have spotted as many as 2 dozen in a night(and those are the ones that you can see). 22 hours straight through gets us there. If you want to break the trip up a little, consider staying at a hotel around Lake Superior. White River(the home of Pooh) is a nice stop. On further, Thunder Bay has numerous places to stay. While coming home, Kakabeka Falls is a must stop. We stop there every year and I'm still amazed at the sight each time. The fall are just outside Thunder Bay."
543946,Guest,2004-10-26 15:49:00,0,Why would you get leeches in the Sault rather than stop in Ignace which is 10 1/2 hrs closer to your destination? Just curious
543949,Guest,2004-10-26 16:44:00,0,"Stehle, You know, I've fished with and guided so many people from Chicago who always tell me to get down there. I've never had a reason to be anywhere near there. I hate traffic (part of the reason I like the north), although I do like staek. I've also fished with many paople from nearby Wisconsin. An interesting contrast . . . I haven't been by there myself. I decided against a trip to fish around the Nipigon dam when I heard of the high amount of rain coming down late Saturday night. To my understanding, it is several sections of HWY 17, all of which are east of Nipigon but west of Schreiber. I've seen footage and it looks nasty. They are now getting people through, but with one lane in some places and with an escort vehicle. From what I saw alone, many large banks will need to be redeveloped and restabilized, and large sections of highway will need resurfacing. Business owners always like you to buy bait close to your fishing destination. If it makes no difference either way, this is a good practice to maintain. Many groups buy bait at the same place every time they make their annual trek, a sort of tradition as part of the fishing vacation experience, and that's fine too. Leeches last forever, which I feel is the best thing about them. I cleaned out a boat the other day and found a small container of leeches I had stowed and forgotten for almost a month. Every one was alive! Now, had you said you purchased minnows . . . I would have had some definate questions."
543950,Stehle,2004-10-27 04:21:00,95,"We used to always buy our leeches in Ignace. We used to always wait an hour until they opened. Like I said, Rusty Myers in Savant appreciated this. But since we started going through the Sault, we have trimmed some serious time off our trip; we get our leeches without a wait; and we pick up our beer without a tax (or inspection). This has gotten us on the water quicker on our first day and that means a lot. The first years that I went, we didn't start fishing until 1:00 or so. Now we are fishing by 10:00. I know three hours doesn't seem like much, but it is when this is your only fishing trip of the year and we don't feel like we're as worn out that first night as well. Anyway, those are the reasons and they've worked so far. So maybe next year we go through the UP into Wisconsin, up to Thunder Bay and on. Buy our beer in the U.S. and pay the tax, and wait for the border police to search our motorhome again in the middle of the night. The leeches did seem better in Ignace, though."
543955,Thomas O,2004-10-27 09:35:00,143,"Thanks everyone for the replies, computer was down for a few days so I'm just now responding.Trying to contact Mike Willems at SWWL on his 800 number.The middle of June or all of July for a week is what I'm shooting for. To IAWalleye, if we run into each other next year at Lac Seul you can buy me a cold Labatts ""Blue""to celebrate Michigan winning the Big Ten and Rose bowl. From what I've heard, Barry Alvarez had the schedule set up this year so your Badgers wouldn't have to face the Wolverines.With their powder puff schedule they should still get a decent bowl game LOL. Go Blue. Tom O"
543969,Guest,2004-10-28 20:16:00,0,"Outstanding! I hope you get in to SWWL, especially the second week in June, when I will be there. I will be happy to buy you a beer and chat football anytime. UM is really coming on this year and frankly, a UM-UW game would be have been a treat to watch. UW has the best defense in the B10 right now and UM is clearly way ahead on offense (I love A Davis, but your freshman tailback is a stud). Other than the time in Canada, the best time of the year is about 10 days away, a time when both college football and BB are on stage at the same time! Have to love the months of Nov and December. Mike will treat you well if you can get in. Best bet is to have some flexiblity when you can come (month, day, etc). Great place, wonderful service, super guides and top-notch equipment. Two years ago my 11 year-old caught a 30 & 1/4"" walleye and last year my 8-year old daughter out-fished her father. I point this out because I am not a great fisherman, but Mike and his staff had us on nice fish every day, they are first rate. I have been going to NW Ontario since I was a kid and this is by far the best place I have been to in terms of overall quality and overall fishing. Go Badgers and I do hope Michigan can run the table from this point on, it would be nice to have the year end with an undefeated UW team and a UM team ranked 2nd in the country (right behind UW) cheers. IA Walleye"
543990,Guest,2004-10-30 18:10:00,0,"I think the trips are all guided. From reading the fishing reports for this lodge on Phil Rolfe's Just Fish Ontario, it sounds like the fishing is some of the best in Ontario for big walleyes and good numbers of fish. Mike Willems the owner is a great fisherman, conservationist and camp operator. Bugs are not bad but near and after dark can be wicked. Usually bottom bouncing and jigging take care of presentations. I think his service and guides justify the price, you just don't get that elsewhere."
544001,Guest,2004-10-31 13:30:00,0,"Guides seem pretty rigid about where they will take you to fish, even if the bite is slow. Also can be more concerned with counting fish they catch on their log than helping you catch fish. Fish a whole day and not catch a walleye and you have to wonder if Lac Seul is so great."
544026,Guest,2004-11-02 06:59:00,0,"Larch My experience at SWWL has been the exact oppisite. The guides ask every day what my expectations are, (walleye: quantity vs. quality, fish for smallies, fish for pike). Then during the course of the day they make suggestions on how I am fishing and listen to any suggestions I make as to where to try. Like all good guides they are not immediately forthcoming with constructive suggestions on how a person fishes until they know I am open to hearing ways to improve. The latter is important because some sports think they know everthing about walleye fishing and don't take kindly to a person telling them anything. Of course you may have expeienced something total different, but in all my trips to SWWL, the guides were terrific. I have been in other resorts in NWO on guided trips where the guides never spoke and seemed to care very little if I caught a fish or not. That has never been my experience at SWWL. For several years running I have had one of my children with me and both started going to SWWL at the age of 8. Every guide was terrific with them, in fact they insisted that the child sit next to them so they could spend most of their time assisting my kids. That was a treat because they got a better fisherman than me to start them off right and I got to concentrate on my fishing a bit more. They were patient and never tired of the 101st question of the day from my kids (such as ""why do eagles have white heads and why are they not called white-headed eagles""). One of the things that the guides do at SWWL is at dinner they discuss what was happening on the lake that day and where. I appreciate that because even with guides that spend the entire summer on the lake, patterns do change and its nice to have a dozen boats out figuring out what is going on and then quickly adjusting to a changing pattern. My advice to anybody on a trip is before you hit the water, spend a a few minutes with your guide over a cup of coffee and discuss what your expectations are, your level of fishing experience (be honest), and what you like to do. As example, I cannot take a whole day of jig fishing, so at some point the guide knows that some part of the day I will want to throw cranks at a wind-swept point to break up the day. He keeps that in mind and in traveling if we pass something that looks promising, I get in a few casts and sometimes get rewarded with a thumping hit that only comes one something large nails a crankbait. Yes, I love the subtle hit of a walleye sucking in a jig, but the smashing hits on a crank can be amazing. OK, guess its time to go to work and earn enough so I can get back to NWO. My last bit of advice is two-fold (a) remember the guides spend all summer on the water so they should know more than any fisherman visiting for just a few days; and (b) its your vacation, the guide should do what you want, so just ask....IA Walleye"
544032,Guest,2004-11-02 16:46:00,0,"Larch, As you could probably see from the other posts in this thread, negative experiences at SWWL are fairly limited. So . . . one has to wonder why. Of course, your post is quite short and lacks detail. Allow me to put your experience into context. I don't know who you are or when you were there, but I would be willing to bet, with near certainty, you visited in May or in late-September (I am assuming you are refering to your experience this year). The spring this year was incredibly cold. There was 10"" of snow on the SWWL grass this year on May 12, less than a week before opener. The walleye action was limited if not non-existent virtually everywhere for late-May. I have guided Lac Seul for five years and never gone a day without a walleye in my boat. The only time a single quest in my boat went a day without a walleye, was when we were fishing 20 yards from the side of an ice sheet, and three-quarters of our normal fishing ground was inaccessible as it was still frozen over. We still caught some decent pike, but what can you expect in such conditions. I felt I had to address the ""fish a whole day and not catch a walleye and you have to wonder if Lac seul is so great"" comment. I've fished most of the known top-walleye waters in North America and I can reassure you Lac Seul is that great!! I think you just got unlucky with when you were there, and hey that's fishing. Like other things, if there wasn't the tough, work your but off, times to get walleyes, would those great times be that rewarding?? Probably not. Now, your other comments I feel at least partially stem from the fact you weren't catching fish, as in if you were catching fish you probably wouldn't be questioning the guide. IA Walleye makes a few good points in that the guides are on the water all day, every day, all summer, and often over multiple years. No matter how much walleye theory or fishing experience you have, you know relatively nothing compared to the guide when it comes to fishing that area of Lac Seul on the first morning of your visit. The guides compare and contrast daily fishing exeriences every night in an effort to ensure all patrons are having the best experience possible. Each and every day some boats will do better than others and again, that's fishing! From a guide perspective, you obviously hope your not on the ""low end"" day in-day out. Because of the ""team"" aspect and guides always sharing info, the guides do care about their production, or as you put it ""counting fish they catch on their log."" The success of the lodge recently has been built on those statistics. Continued success is/will be measured against those production numbers. They also help determine short- and long-term trends, both with regard to fish location and the overall health of the fishery. Your statement of a guide being more worried about fish production than you catching fish makes no sense. By definition, it is you catching fish that adds to that production. In short, I believe (or at least hope) your negative experience can largely be attributed to very tough fishing conditions, and not that your guide wouldn't try new spots or was too concerned with production (again, the produciton argument fundamentally doesn't make sense). I would be very curious to know the date of your visit. That said Larch, I don't know what your plans are, but you should return and give it another chance. Yes, the guides have the best idea of where to go be it fast or slow action, yes the guides care about fish production, and yes the guides care about your concerns (provided you are commuicating them effectively, which is often another problem, and IA Walleye is right in saying you should be forthcoming in presenting your desires or concerns). I know, as I'm sure many of the readers on this post know, of several lodges were the guides give little effort to customer service/satisfaction, don't care about fish production, guide independently, and will go wherever you want because they are ""just putting in the time."" I can give you the names of a few places if that's your desire. I, for one, will stand behind the guide service of SWWL as being top-notch. The guides care about their guests, often develop lasting relationships with guests (despite seeing them only a few days a year), and they are committed to providing ALL lodge guests with the most positive fishing vacation experience possible. IA Walleye, look forward to seeing you in June. Will you be bringing El Nino or La Nina, or both? No matter what, always a pleasure to see you!"
544035,Guest,2004-11-02 19:02:00,0,"Geeez. I must be really slow. Can't believe I've fished so many places, with and without guides, and not shared the experience. Obviously we all know a guide should know more about the lake than me - never questioned that. And somehow, my wife affirms that my communication skills are not that bad - wished they'd have asked how much or how big, though. Are smallies an option? - no one told me about that. It's big walleyes or else, and the logs count for the web site. In all honesty, the place isn't all bad. Really nice in many ways. But I fish a lot."
544122,Guest,2004-11-10 11:32:00,0,"The SWWL! What a place. Mike (owner, who guides everyday) and his guide staff are top notch. They will do anything to put fish in the boat, and that's why you're there right. There is no competition between the guides, no secret spots so they all help each other to help the guests. Boats are top quality 18' Pro V's. Best methods for putting the most fish in the boat are definitely bottom bouncing a spinner rig with minnow or jigging with grub and minnow. Guides work hard and keeping the guests happy is top priority. Shore lunches are unbelievable, just take my word for it. Don't be afraid to stray from the fried walleye and try the 'bake' or the chowder. Both excellent. The food and inside staff contribute to the whole experience as much as the world class fishing does. EVERYTHING is included in the price. You won't pay extra for bait, fuel, food etc. Only to tip the staff, which as you will learn are very deserving of a gratuity. There is a small tackle shop (with very reasonable prices) if you need something essential. If you have the time, take the trip accross the north shore of Lake Superior - it's God's country up there, so beautiful. After you get back you can drop names like Nowhere, Little Iowa, Rocker's and Lodge Lookout. It is fishing spots like these that keep me thinking about Lac Seul and the SWWL for 51 weeks a year."
544123,Guest,2004-11-10 12:10:00,0,Couldnt agree with you more. Its a great place with great Hosts. we caught a lot of nice fish and gained weight on the awesome food....Lasagne to die for.
544126,Guest,2004-11-10 13:51:00,0,sounds like a great place. hope i can visit there some day. i have enjoyed reading mike's articles on his website.
544034,Guest,2004-11-02 17:26:00,0,"NWO Bum Not sure yet on El Nino or La Nina. Last year El Nino was invited to travel to Australia. This coming summer he has been invited to go to China. My Better-Half wants him to go to China because how many times will that invite happen again. If he goes to China, La Nina comes, she loved it at SWWL. After our trip to SWWL, she spent two weeks in northern Wisconsin and she outfished most of the boys. Both are going with me on trip to Mexico to fish the big water for Thanksgiving. Last year La Nina scored the big fish for the trip with a 6 1/2 foot sail fish, so this Thanksgiving she is trying to beat that. Hope your fall is great, we are breaking in a new pup on pheasants. American Water Spaniel and so far so good. Sunday, he put up two roosters on his own. Like most pups and kids, long on enthusiasm, prone to mistakes. Like my kids, he is better than his trainer (me). 223 (or so) days until a slice of heaven at SWWL, but who is counting!"
543940,Guest,2004-10-26 11:47:00,0,"In Canada it is ""Sault"", not ""Sioux"". Of note, large sections of HWY 17 east on Nipigon were washed away over the weekend, bringing cross-country travel to a standstill. Luckily, it was all east of the 11/17 junction, allowing people the several hour detour of going up to HWY 11 and back down to 11/17 at Nipigon. Had it been west of Nipigon, all Canadian cross-country travel would have ceased, as there is no other road. Hard to believe in the 21st century, the loss of one road could cause such troubles, but around Thunder Bay, where 11/17 merge, there is only one road. Why is this relevant? Well, it will be snowing up here soon so road work doesn't get finished. The MTO plan is to complete touch-up work, just to make the road safe for the winter driving season, before major road repairs and bridge construction can be completed next summer. At that time, you can expect major delays on HWY 17. Stay tuned for an update on this in the spring, but I suspect anyone debating north of Superior vs. south of Superior for travel to northwest Ontario from Michigan or Ohio or wherever next summer, may want to choose south of Superior. I don't know if such delays would be worse than through Chicago, as I've never been to Chicago, but I would assume they could be lengthy. Bottom line . . . stay tuned to this in the spring if you're travelling north next summer. Of note, a few of us crazy university students decided to take a ski trip to B.C. December 1st three years ago, completely on a whim. We literally left the same day we thought of it. Unfortuneately, a truck tipped spilling environmentally-destructive chemicals, in one of these 11/17 merged areas west of Thunder Bay near Shabaqua. It stopped all east-west Canadian traffic for several days. We were so hard-up to get on snow, with a late winter seeming imminent in Thunder Bay, that we drove south to Duluth, west through North Dakota, and back up into Saskatchewan. All told it was probably an 8 hour detour, as in it added 8 hours to our total expected trip time. And all this because there is only one road in that location. Thankfully, we are intelligent enough to realize long detours or long waits are a far better option than more roads!!!!!"
543944,Stehle,2004-10-26 13:00:00,95,"Thanks for the info, Bum. Sorry about the Sault thing. Where was it washed out at again? Near Red Rock? Anyway, we've been contemplating travel through the UP and going through Duluth for a while. The drawback is that we can't spend our hard earned American dollars on Canadian beer at the Sault. Plus we get our leeches there so that we don't have to stop in Ignace. This would throw us back by 2 hours, but the guys at Rusty Myers wouldn't be upset that we wouldn't wake them up early. Chicago is a night mare...any route but through there. You ought to try driving through there with a motorhome...not much fun."
