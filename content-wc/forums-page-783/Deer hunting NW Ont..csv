Has anybody deer hunted with Gey Ghost outfitters or around the Dryden area. I've talked to the owner of Grey Ghost he also owns a fishing camp on Gullrock lake, he said a trophy hunter could expect a 130 - 175 class deer if they put their time in. Can anybody give some info on the area and the whitetail hunting."
544157,Guest,2004-11-12 20:33:00,0,i know nothing about grey ghost outfitters but have hunted in dryden area as a non resident. hunted on my own.no guide. was not succesful in getting a buck which is not that important to me.would only hire gude if he has access to private alfalfa land otherwise you will be hunting bush either watching clear cuts or in a stand on a trail or scrape line which you could do on your own.i was there after the rut last year so bad timing but had to work when i should have been there. was at nestor falls area twice once supposed to be guided but when got there no guides avail. outfitter sent us to cut line along power lines well every one with 4 wheeler has same idea. all in all the people i met were real nice but if you arent experienced hunting big bush it can be overwhelming. i think the bigger bucks are clear cut shy.i should be there right now.... good luck.

I was told I should not see another hunter while I'm hunting. I talked to him last nite he said they just took a 9pt. that weighted 265lbs. that's a big deer where I'm from."
