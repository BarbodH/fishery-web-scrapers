Has anyone had any success for this species at this time and if so, what techniques have worked the best. Has anyone used dead bait such as smelt for them at this time? While I am not asking for specific spots, are there any general areas on the map of the lake that you can suggest for quality action. Also, is there any location where shallow water action on a fly rod with a pair of waders would be possible? Also, I have one other question about the smallmouth at this time. I have had conflicting information on this species from camps in the are and from some VERY prominent muskie/smallmouth guides in this area about wether it is legal to fish for smallies this time of year or not. While I know that the season for them is closed for harvest and possession, is it legal to fish for them during this time. In the waters of eatern Ontario, where I normally fish, it is NOT legal to fish for smallies out of season. I have been told that this is not the case, however, on this portion of LOTW. Does anyone know for sure? I am NOT a poacher and have no immediate plans to become one in the future, nor do I want to be one of those guys who claims to be fishing for pike and walleye (wink-wink) when they are actually ilegally fishing for something else. Thanks in advance for your help!"

In most Divisions Small mouth season is open all year, *execpt December 24th."

But there is a fairly tight slot on them, if someone has there regulation book with them they should be able to tell you. All the pike I have caught up there have came out of deep water. Good luck"
