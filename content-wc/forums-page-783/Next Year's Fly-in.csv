Looking for something new with numbers of walleye only. Any thoughts out there? Early Sept. trip, price not a factor. It's been a 25 year tradition of fly-ins, so fly-in it must be. Thanks for your ideas."

543807,Tundra21,2004-10-17 08:31:00,20,"The wife and I have went to Wapesi Lake on a fly-in the last two years. Already booked for next year as well. We have had tremendous fishing for walleyes with several 100+ fish days, 17""-21"" is typical with a 28.5"" being the largest. Wapesi is about a 30 minute flight north of Lac Suel. Great accomadations, nice price and a very good fishing lake..Give Clay at Northwoods Outpost a call and I am sure you will not be disappointed.1-877-925-3593"

543893,Guest,2004-10-21 18:43:00,0,"They run a good operation, but I heard there Beech 18 crashed this fall. Anybody know if that's true?"
543904,Guest,2004-10-23 10:40:00,0,I heard that its true Pipestone Fly Ins plane crashed. I guess it ran into power line wires and sunk in Rainy Lake. Anybody know anymore details?
544025,Guest,2004-11-01 21:12:00,0,"Check out Ingace Outposts. We fished Flindt Lake two years ago and had over 1000 eyes in five days with six guys. Mostly 15-23"". Several nice northerns 38""-40"" too. About an hour flight from Ignace. Brad is the outfitter and is very accomodating. Winneconne"
