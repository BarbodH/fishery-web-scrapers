6112002,Guest,2018-04-05 12:28:00,0,It's been officially announced Pat has sold the Camp. Had a lot of great trips for about 20 of the 26 years she owned it. I miss going
6112066,Pooch,2018-04-05 13:18:00,4618,"Why would you not continue to go? Camps change hands all the time, most new owners improve or update. Then again sometimes new owners change things that people have liked about the camp thus driving long time guests to look for a new ""home away from home"".At least give the new owners a chance.Pooch"

I had mixed feelings, to say the least, but I think it is better now than it was before. Lots of improvements were done and even staffing quality improved. My wife couldn't wait to tell the new ownership where I work, but nobody cared because we were all there to have a good time and catch some fish."

They shot him the next night said lots of bears come to dumpsters but never one did that, said I was due to the drouth and how hungry they were going into hibernation, was a memorable trip for sure, it was our only time we went there but is was a great camp and excellent service / equipment."
6136993,Guest,2018-04-16 12:45:00,0,I have been going to Evergreen for opener the last 16 years. I talked to the new owners last week as one of our group has a conflict for opening week. Fortunately they had an opening and Kathie was very accommodating and moved us to the second week of walleye season. I also have a trip to Evergreen scheduled for August and see no reason to change. I look forward to meeting the new owners. I will miss not going opening week this year even though ice out might be iffy.

6208688,btyreprich,2018-06-14 13:56:00,1067,We leave next Friday for our annual trip. We all wish Pat the best in her well deserved retirement and look forward to becoming friends with the new owners. Pat assured us they are people of the highest caliber and are not strangers to the fishing lodge trade.
