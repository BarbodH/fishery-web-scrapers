6180442,DaBirdman,2018-05-08 17:09:00,164,"I haven't targeted like for many years, but will on our fly-in trip. What are guys using for steel leaders now says? 6""? 9""? 12""? Plain old steel leader or titanium? What pound strength?"
6181106,adempsey2.0,2018-05-08 21:19:00,612,"Steel is fine, but I prefer Titanium and Fluorocarbon.I use 20lb 12"" Single Stranded Titanium for almost all my casting.I use 80lb 18"" 7-Strand Titanium for trolling.However,I also use 100 to 150lb 18""+ Fluorocarbon for trolling.If I am fishing for Walleye in ""risky"" areas, I like using a 6"" 15-20lb Single Strand Titanium leader.The reason I use Titanium is because it is very thin, has a bit of stretch and is less prone to kinks. It's amazing stuff.Fluorocarbon is nice because it's thick and easy to grab, but still strong enough as a good leader. Too bulky for casting at times though...depends on what I am casting. Something big, then sure, I would use a 12"" fluoro leader no problem.I am going to be using solid stainless steel wire for some jerkbait fishing this year as well. It's 125lb test. I also made up some leaders with 150lb and 200lb test mono leader [which is stiffer than normal mono] to try instead of fluorocarbon. It looks great, but we'll see.There's nothing wrong with nylon coated steel leaders. The others just have some useful benefits."

6172537,123chadder,2018-05-04 09:04:00,429,"very good advice!if you wanna go for trout id also suggest a lead core trolling outfit,they will be deep in july,but anchored jigging works well"
6172569,123chadder,2018-05-04 09:09:00,429,"trolling for lakers:Building a three-way swivel rig:Tie two lines to a three-way swivel, one about 20 inches long and the second 23 inchesTie you sinker your to sinker to the 23-inch line. Feedin lake trout will stay in the 40- to 55-foot range during the summer so a two-ounce weight is adequate. The sinker line is a little longer so your lure stays off the bottom if you get a snagTie your lure to the shorter line. Small, feather-light sppons that are silver or silber mixed with blue, green or pink work best uou can also use dipsey divers for walleye i use 1/4-3/8oz jigs,i jig 90%+ for eyes,imo its much more productive than trolling,some anglers troll and when they get hits they anchor and jig that area...5-15fow are the best depths,target deeper for the pigs,the bigger walleye will often come in shallow at dusk to feed,so jigging/trolling shallow at dusk is a good idea as well.we catch numerous pike while jigging for walleye so a good fluorocarbon leader is an asset...sometimes i just work fallen trees,exposed rocks on the shoreline for eyes,,it can be very productive as well"

6173857,Dave Watkins,2018-05-04 18:23:00,208,"Great responses and I thank you all. I am going to a drive to Lodge and will most likely bring way more than I need. I'm just trying to get a feel for the type of presentations to start out in the boat with. It is a large lake and I can't take all the tackle in the boat, thus the plan for a starting point that will hopefully touch base with the fish. Thanks again guys."
6173897,PA troutguy,2018-05-04 18:40:00,58,"Was fishing northwest Ontario for pike several years ago in late May. The last three days of the trip they would only hit #10 husky jerk in clown. Lost the last one the next to last day of the trip. I bought one at the lodge for 50% more than at home. I now take just about everything I have. Truck looks like a mini tackle shop in the back. Good luck to you. I also use heavy fluoro leader on my jigs when small mouth fishing; pike, bass and musky eat those four inch grubs."
6174009,port1042,2018-05-04 20:16:00,509,"I take one bag that holds 5 ""3600"" size trays along with a couple of pockets. Each box is labeled: Jigs, Plastics, Shad Raps (might contain similar), Mepps Spinners (might contain similar) and Terminal. That takes care of everything I need. But, I also have 2 canvas ""tray carriers"" that each hold 6 ""3600"" trays. Those go with me too but not on the boat. Depending on how things are going, I might swap out a couple of trays (top water, spoons, trolling, pan fish, small plastics, etc.) or used to replace lost or ""off color"" lures. By the end of the week the 5 trays are started with are seldom the five I finished with. However, ""Terminal"" and ""Jigs"" I can count on being there!"
6174473,packpro,2018-05-05 07:59:00,695,"This first trip is fun. I started with everything I needed in a small tackle box. Then the addiction kicked in. If you catch a nice fish on your fish trip on a lure, you will buy that lure every time you go into a tackle shop for fear of not having it again. My box up sized every year. It was embarrassing if someone else grabbed it to help you move gear into the boat. Funny thing.... we take some portages during the week that require a bit of a hike. Everyone uses a sandwich bag for a tackle box. 8-10 jigs. couple of spoons, couple of lures, small bag of gulp, few twistertails, and two steel leaders. We will catch over 100 fish per day and usually a few 40"" pike on those remote lakes. We won't use half the stuff we bring. This year I am taking the smallest tackle ever. After all these years we really have it dialed in. We created a photo tackle box for our newbies. If successful the pictures are attached. We go the first week of June, so most of our walleye fishing is jig fishing. That keeps it simple for us. We fish for walleye, smallmouth, northern pike, lake trout and perch. Except for jigs you only need 2-3 of the other items especially if you use a steel leader whenever casting. I would say you don't need all the things shown, just two or three of that style of bait. i.e. top water, spoons, etc. Then just take one or two fun things to experiment with. One additional item for us is a few deep diving husky jerks for lake trout. We fish them two ways depending on ice out. Late ice like this year-out they we be at the top of the water column. We have added 2-3 deep diving husky jerks with three sets of trebles. As the water warms they go deep. For that scenario we only use the heavy white jig, with large twister tail tipped with dead minnows. Ultimately you're balancing functionality, with the convenience of carrying the gear."
6174489,packpro,2018-05-05 08:03:00,695,Some of these things go in the tackle box. Other things get carried in small back pack. We tell our guys to check with their boat partner. No need to duplicate some of the items.
6174633,Johnny Rock,2018-05-05 09:43:00,8,What a nice gift to the Forum PackPro! Those pics are great! Well done and thanks for sharing.
6175881,Mojo-NC,2018-05-06 08:16:00,1929,"These guys in the other posts have the tackle department covered extremely well. The only thing I would add is to try and keep your tackle boxes organized and accessible. Most tackle boxes nowadays are canvas and will retain moisture in one of the heavy or all-day rains, so they need to be protected. Tackle is too expensive to allow it to rust. I also want my needle nose pliers, jaw spreader, measuring device, hook file, clippers, and scale readily available so I don't have to keep fish out of the water any longer than necessary. I keep several dry bags in the boat - one for my rain suit if I'm not already wearing it, one for my camera and binoculars, and another for my tackle. I used to use the tube-style bags, but they are too difficult to get stuff in and out of the bottom, so now I prefer the duffel-style bags. Do not get one of the boat bags from BPS or other similar store because they leak like a sieve. They are great at holding water inside because of the tray-style bottom, but very poor for keeping the inside contents dry. I also try to keep my walleye and pike stuff separate. You may not need a camera and binoculars bag as the cameras on phones have come a long way and are pretty high quality, but I like to bring my 35mm with a zoom lens and binoculars for watching, moose, eagles, etc, and/or photographing nice fish."
6171193,Dave Watkins,2018-05-03 13:59:00,208,"First trip to Canada fishing at a lodge. Since I will be renting a camp boat I only want to take one medium size tackle box. What types of lures, jigs, rigs, and color preferences should I concentrate on. Lake is pretty large with Smallmouth , Walleye, Pike, Lake Trout. Time is mid July. Appreciate any help for this Canadian fishing rookie."
6171289,Joek3,2018-05-03 14:58:00,244,A few dozen 1/4 oz jigs. White/chartreuse/pink (I like fireball spin jig) Handful of slow death smiley rigs. Couple war eagle spinnerbaits and tubes for the smallies. Maybe a few jerkbaits /crank baits. Some ideas.
6171297,Aspencreek,2018-05-03 15:03:00,2911,"For me I only target walleye with some throwing for pike only in the evening. You will catch plenty of small mouth by accident. 1)asst jigs in a multitude of colors (specific colors don't matter, that is a fish preference) 2)backtrolling spinner rigs, lots of them with interchangeable blades and bottom bouncers 3)what ever you want to throw for pike 4) Rapala floating stickbaits for dragging behind a bottom bouncer 5) slip bobber stuff 6)sunsceen and bug stuff 7)wet wipes (diaper wipes) 8)jaw speader and long nose pliers (for those slimey, toothy critters) 9)good polarized sunglasses, and hat It all goes in a Cabela's medium sized bag in Plano boxes that slides neatly behind or under the seat."

6171673,adempsey2.0,2018-05-03 19:30:00,612,"Summer Lake Trout - Dig DEEPVertical Jig - if you can manage it, it's not easy without anchoring, but with a heavy enough jig it could be. A 2+oz. jig with a white tube or swim bait should work.Trolling - whatever method you can get the lure down 60+ feet (could be 30 to 100). A simple bell sinker (1oz/10 feet) and a rubber band works just fine. That along with a flutter spoon of your choice. Otherwise, the spoons you use for pike should work or any minnow stick bait.Walleye - It's all about the meat!Vertical Jig - 1/4oz to 1/oz jigs with 4"" grubs or paddletail minnows [or worms or minnows if you want to use meat]. Lean toward more lighter jigs, but the heavier ones are important to have in situations with current or wind. White plastics work everywhere. Blade baits also work well if you have them.Trolling - If it's a deep basin, you may have to troll. Bottom bouncers with worm harnesses or slow death rigs with worms/plastics are good choices, but crank baits or spoons are fine as well. Just bring a selection of your favorite cranks that go from 8 to 14 feet. A couple deep divers (20+Feet) are nice, but probably unnecessary. Besides, tossing on a bell sinker or two will solve that problem. Bait Rigs - Lindy Rigs can be a good alternative to trolling harnesses. Primarily used for drift fishing. It's a simple slip sinker and hook. Another very important set up is the slip bobber rig, IF the basin is deep and you need to fish close to shore. This is a great technique and could make and break a trip in really deep lakes.Pike - Find the Cabbage Casting - just a handful of your favorite casting spoons. Silver always good, Copper too. 1 oz. are fine. Also, weedless spoon with a grub trailer is a must. A white spinner bait is another go to. Crank baits if you like them, but in July spoons will work well. You can troll them too if you like. Smallmouth - ROCKS!Casting - A handful of your favorite cranks that go from 8 to 15 FOW. Lipless cranks are a great choice for smalllmouth. A jig and grub/meat always worked well for me too. Smallmouth fishing is more about location IMO. Find piles of rocks, you will catch them on pretty much anything. Drop shot if you like finesse rigs, but probably not necessary.Most of the tackle you can share between all species."
6171753,martinbns,2018-05-03 20:35:00,1520,"Walleye, a bunch of 1/4 and 3/8oz jigs, period. Use minnows you can get from camp unless prohibited. A handful of Shad Raps for trolling. Pike, 2-3 husky jerks and 3-4 spoons Lakers, can't help you there SMbass, 5-6 crank baits, a handfull of tube jigs. I could probably carry all that in a fanny pack...grin"
6172249,BornToFish,2018-05-04 07:41:00,1224,"Greetings,There have already been several excellent posts on this thread regarding appropriate equipment. The original poster mentioned that he will be fishing in mid-July. Hence, I reinforce the recommendation to be thinking fairly deep fishing.I find that almost all of my fishing equipment neatly fits in a milk crate. I have several Plano boxes in the milk crate that contain an assortment of jigs, spinner baits, spoons, crankbaits, topwaters, replacement hooks, spinner rigs and the like. The milk crate also contains bug spray, sun screen, release tools, a length of rope, camera, flashlight, sun hat, fillet knife, fish towels, toilet paper, bottom bouncers and three marker buoys.I also keep a small tackle box in the boat - similar to what you may have used as a beginner fisherman. It contains assorted loose tackle like leaders, sinkers, slip bobbers, depth weights, snap swivels, weights for Lindy Rigs and the like.I like the milk crate concept as it doesn't collect water. Everything that is in it is in water-proof packaging so it's kept dry.My wife and I also keep a ""dry bag"" in the boat with our rain gear. As already mentioned earlier in this thread, don't go cheap with your raingear. A poncho will not get the job done for you.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6172489,TheDFP,2018-05-04 08:48:00,39,I assume you are staying at a drive to camp. Here is my opinion. I would take everything you have. Best case is you leave stuff back at camp so the boat is not too cluttered. You can easily go back to camp to get it. Worst case is you leave something back at home that others in camp are catching lots of fish on. You will second guess yourself.
