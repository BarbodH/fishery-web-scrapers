6169961,Camoclad,2018-05-02 19:05:00,628,"We are flying with PFO, we go in on 6/30 and fly out on 7/7. We are just hoping for a good safe trip and for the new guys to get on some fish. Really getting excited now, just finished paying the outfitter, sent in the grocery and bait order and starting to get the gear together. We fly from Atlanta to I-Falls the day before and stay at Hilltop motel. I think our flight out is 10:30 on Sat. Thanks for all the info you have shared. It is obviously a special place to you and we hope to do you proud on the fishing and exploring!"
6208318,Abest23,2018-06-13 09:25:00,1,"First time going up in August. Any reports back? Im trying to map off some of the info on these threads but having a hard time finding ""The Wall"", ""Rabbit head"". I have found the NWO camp and Rusty Myers camp and Pipestone camps. Any pointers would be appreciated!!!!"
6208617,Pikeslayer8,2018-06-14 08:30:00,1460,"Fishing was great this spring, better than average. Who ya goin with?"

6161265,Pikeslayer8,2018-04-27 15:01:00,1460,"Yup, the ice will be all out and the walleye layin in like cordwood, bitin like crazy! Hey jveri, have a great one on the Big Whitewater."
6166033,Camoclad,2018-05-01 04:14:00,628,"Pikeslayer, I hope you have a great trip! We will be on Wabakimi about a month later. I am really looking forward to it after reading the other Wabakimi thread. We will have several first timers in our group and I think this will be a great introduction to fly-in fishing for them.

6039553,Pikeslayer8,2018-03-04 19:04:00,1460,"Both of my nephews' wives are having babies in June and my Brother in Law has set a August trip for them so I'm missing half my group. Even my youngest son can't go this year as he decided to be responsible with his employment. I need a few good men to join myself, my brother and son for a trip to Wabakimi. Depending on the size of the group, the price is on the NWO website. http://www.northernwilderness.net/rates I will plan on purchasing food and we eat well. Fishin's usually pretty good the first week in June. We typically stay at the Rondesvoux the night before (June 2) so we can be at the airbase when they are ready to take us in."

6040009,pjshorthorn,2018-03-05 05:07:00,5654,"Bill, I wish I could make it with you guys. Apparently your nephews got caught up in the throws of passion and didn't count how many months in advance the trip was scheduled for before making that fateful decision. The good news is that you will have two new great nieces or nephews to train up on Canadian fishing adventures. Give Jimi a jingle. I know he and they boys are going to Tomahawk this summer on LOTW, but he could use a second trip to Canada this year. He will even bring the blow up animals with him. I sent him a blow up cow and monkey for Christmas to add to his sheep collection. PjShorthorn"
6040073,Mike Borger,2018-03-05 05:43:00,1554,If I didn't already have plans I'd be all over that Bill. It would be an honor to join your group at Wabakimi.

PjShorthorn Thanks for the kind words Pat and it would be really awesome if you could go, but how come it always comes back to the blow up dolls!

Someday Quote: Originally Posted by jimirjrThat would Be a fun trip ! ALAS, I am headed to WYOMING on the 7th....

Of course now that he is experimenting with blow up critters, might have to re-evaluate this open invitation thing."

It is all about the Bare Necessities .....that's why !!!!!https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9ogQ0uge06o Sorry Bill, but Jimi sent a PM to me saying I was off base about the Bare Necessities. Apparently, this video is a little more on point according to him. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=77F76TuRMoQ PjShorthorn"
