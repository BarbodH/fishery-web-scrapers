6208000,kzoofisher,2018-06-12 14:40:00,5144,"I don't know where you get your info. California has been a national leader in economic growth for many years and has been beating the national average for a decade or so. If businesses are leaving CA they're either being replaced or were so inconsequential that the overall economy never notices. Governments can't be revenue neutral because they can't predict the ups and downs of the economy that precisely. When times are good they put some in the rainy day fund and spend the rest on infrastructure, education and all the things that get shortchanged when times are bad. Not unlike you and I when we take advantage of business being good to put a new roof on or replace old appliances or whatever. We could blow it on lottery tickets but the smart person will save some and spend some on needed things. Some of those things will seem like they weren't all that needed to other people just like when the gov't repairs something on the west side of the State the east siders might think it was a waste."
6208024,Eyetimes,2018-06-12 15:59:00,193,Governments can and should be revenue neutral or as close to it as possible. If they make and follow a budget they should not have to over tax people for a rainy day fund when the market is slow. When the market picks ups and they happen to make more money then they can adjust the budget for that tax revenue and tackle that bigger projects at that time. But if the market slows and the tax revenue drops they should adjust spending according. But taxing people more so the government can maintain a level a spending in a slow market to me is silly. You also act like Cali is this holy place for GDP. 2017 Cali GDP dropped behind the national average. They are leading the country in the poverty rate when taking in account of cost of living and lets not forget your beloved tax rate. The homeless population is rank 3rd behind Hawaii and New York. But give it time and I am sure they will take the #1 spot they are on the proper track. If it were not for Silicon Valley Cali would be nothing special.
6208096,MikeF,2018-06-12 19:05:00,895,"Governments goal now seems to be, to make you, the citizen, revenue neutral. More dependency and then it can justify the need to grow."
6206122,Eyetimes,2018-06-08 08:04:00,193,[QUOTE=v-bay gord;6206076]Quit using common sense. [IMG class=inlineimg]https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums/images/smilies/lovit.gifSince when is the government a business? No it’s not a good thing if they run the government like a business. How do they make money by taxing/fines the very people who fund their paychecks. We all know how efficient bureaucracy’s are with their money. We already pay for licensing our boats and trailers. We buy fishing licenses and stamps. I don’t have a problem with this until the prices get to expensive for the poorest to be able to fish. But fining people for having water in there boat is an abuse of power. Especially when every year more and more lakes have invasive species. They act like a boater is the only way invasive can get transferred from lake to lake. When the ships coming into port have water in there ballast tanks and who knows what from who knows where attached to there hulls. They don’t seem to care about those ships. Maybe it has something to do with the tax revenue that is made. They pretend to be doing everything they can but they are not.
6206220,kzoofisher,2018-06-08 13:11:00,5144,"Running gov't like a business"" is popular in some circles, supposed to make it more efficient. As far as fining/taxing people for their behavior, we do that all the time. Usually they're called *sin taxes* and most voters don't mind because they disproportionately fall on fat people or drinkers or the poor. The AIS thing is the same. They could stick it to the upper classes but it's much easier to stick it to the middle and lower classes where most of the fisherman are. We're all middle class around here, right?"
6206222,That Minnesota guy,2018-06-08 13:18:00,8293,Governments SHOULD BE ran as businesses. In that you don't spend more then you take in. Washington (and all the states) think they have a ATM for their pet projects.
6206612,Wall-i-Lama,2018-06-09 12:23:00,1524,"In my opinion, unless it comes from mars, there is no such thing as an invasive species on planet earth. Over the mellenia, species will move all over this earth with or without our assistance. I mean look at how the invasive zebra muscle has killed the fishing in Lake Erie! I just don't buy into all this stuff. Just a bunch of overhead folks finding a way to stay busy and generate revenue."
6206760,Skywagon,2018-06-09 18:55:00,1106,"I am all for running our governments as a business rather than the charities they are now! I have still never got over when my teacher (back in the middle ages) told us we were all upper lower class to lower middle class in our community, have never felt I could afford a store bought jig since."
6206950,kzoofisher,2018-06-10 11:44:00,5144,"Businesses are supposed to make profits, governments not so much. Some do run a surplus and those places may be attractive to you. Take a look at California for a place that strikes a good balance between revenues and spending. With an economy bigger than Canada's and an equivalent population they must be doing something right."
6207222,SterlingArcher,2018-06-11 07:12:00,92,"Read up on the issue a bit. Some invasives are relatively benign. Some (asian carp, starry stonewort) can ruin a lake). It's a little silly to pretend that species that crossed an ocean on a freighter would somehow magically have arrived here on their own."
6207606,Aspencreek,2018-06-11 21:31:00,2911,"Government should be run like a business, the problem is when business people get elected the rest of the lawyers, and career politicians are threatened......... And did you really want us to look at CALIFORNIA spending and revenues......you must be kidding!"
6207676,kzoofisher,2018-06-12 03:54:00,5144,Why not California? They have a booming economy and run a surplus that they can use to maintain and expand the infrastructure that attracts more business. As far as I'm concerned their biggest problems are too many people and they don't have the kind of fishing I like.
6207700,Eyetimes,2018-06-12 05:36:00,193,Why not California? Here’s a reason look at their tax rate. Or you could ask the 100s of businesses that are fleeing the state monthly. You do understand the surplus you talk about is just over taxing it’s residents. A government should be revenue natural.
6205686,pjshorthorn,2018-06-07 05:30:00,5654,"So you are saying that the officer was targeting fishermen from Illinois, right? I'm not sure I blame the officer. You never know what those guys from Illinois might be up to....PjShorthorn"
6205956,Shortline,2018-06-07 17:40:00,234,Crossing the border and the DNR ticketed him? What reason did he get searched for? Seems like a scenario that may have more to info to clarify?
6205962,Eyetimes,2018-06-07 17:54:00,193,"I maybe wrong, but I am pretty sure the dnr (D$mn near Russia) can stop you just to look for invasives."
6205982,BrianE,2018-06-07 18:50:00,98,Pretty much that. Their job is to fleece the public.
6205986,Shortline,2018-06-07 19:05:00,234,"I believe you are correct, I just wasn't sure how common that is. Personally, I have seen it happening once south of baudette, but have never been subject to a random AIS search myself. I cross the border about 8-10 tomes a yr at FF/IF and haven't seen that, but don't doubt it happens."
6206008,Guest,2018-06-07 19:53:00,0,Link to the MN boat inspectors handbook. This spells out what they are looking for and why. Read it to save yourself some time and money.https://files.dnr.state.mn.us/natura...n_handbook.pdf
6206014,Eyetimes,2018-06-07 20:19:00,193,It would take an hour to inspect your boat and trailer if you did it the way the dnr wants you to. I feel the Inforcement and inspection is a waste of money. The dnr should in my opinion concentrate on what to do once the invasive get in a lake. But they can always make some money back by ticketing people.
6206032,kzoofisher,2018-06-08 02:50:00,5144,"Need a little clarification here. Why is it like Communism when a bureaucracy generates revenue? Seems to me that finding creative ways to increase revenue is the hallmark of Capitalism. The DNR stopping you and nicking you for a ticket, or creating all sorts of fees that you are forced to pay to participate, is just them running government like a business. Isn't that a good thing?"
6206076,v-bay gord,2018-06-08 06:43:00,3168,Quit using common sense.
6206112,SterlingArcher,2018-06-08 07:44:00,92,"Once invasives get into a lake, Pandora's box has been opened and there really isn't much you can do to close it. Stopping the spread is the only sensible strategy, though I fear that is likely a losing battle long-term, too."
6204682,Pooch,2018-06-05 11:00:00,4618,"Friend contacted everyone in our group about a friend of his returning to the states via FF/IF crossing who received a citation/ticket from MN DNR for not having his live well completely drained and dry and a warning for pollen on his boat.I can see not realizing some water in a live well maybe deserving a ticket, but a warning for pollen on your boat? I don't get that. How would you keep pollen off your boat or trailer? What about the vehicle you are towing with?I'm a big supporter of stopping invasive's, but I'm not quite understanding the pollen thing. What else do we need to be aware of this year?Pooch"
6204690,MN_Moose,2018-06-05 12:10:00,964,You should be used to such tactics. Minnesota is just slightly behind Illinois on the Communist scale.
6204714,SterlingArcher,2018-06-05 12:55:00,92,The pollen thing is a puzzler...not sure how you would keep it off your boat is it is being collected during the drive! Might be better for them to just remind folks to wash their boat when they get home.
6204726,v-bay gord,2018-06-05 13:14:00,3168,The pollen accumulated in the water and then on the boat....not airborne pollen. I suppose a crust of pollen on your hull could hide pests such as spiny water flea. Makes sense.
6204762,Obabikon,2018-06-05 14:00:00,2370,"If it is bad... just take a towel, and wipe your boat off when you pull it."
6205012,h8go4s,2018-06-05 21:06:00,1673,"A friend of a friend, huh? I'll believe ticketing for water in the livewell, but never have heard of one for pollen. Call me a skeptic, but I'm not buying that, especially a third-hand chronicle. Don't panic yet, guys."
6205090,That Minnesota guy,2018-06-06 05:40:00,8293,"Ahh, the pesky pollen on the boat. Those little zeebs can hide everywhere. After pulling your boat be sure to break the bead on the trailer tires and and wipe those little critters out of there also. Of course getting a crane and lifting the hull so you can get the bunks between the hull cleaned off."
6205102,Pooch,2018-06-06 05:49:00,4618,Depends on the quality of your friends ...........Pooch
6205216,h8go4s,2018-06-06 08:01:00,1673,And your friend's friend................... Nothing here about pollen: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasive...estrial_plantsDon't panic yet.
6205506,Aspencreek,2018-06-06 14:13:00,2911,"Of course there is nothing about pollen, he had to come up with ""Something"" else besides the live well. And the poor guy had been sneezing all day! Look, is a guy from IL going to fight a ticket like that, of course not, Officer is laughing all the way back to his truck."
