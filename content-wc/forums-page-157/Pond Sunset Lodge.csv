6206288,Kekhoff86,2018-06-08 17:01:00,1,Just got home from our annual trip to Dinorwic lake staying at Pine Sunset Lodge. We caught a ton of fish considering the changing weather we had over the last week. Slot walleyes everyday and huge crappies made up the bulk of the trip. Not too many over northerns as we've had in the past but the smallies were on fire. Great camp and great lake per usual. We carried a 12Â”average on the crappieswe kept. Pics are of my best smaller and walleye. Can't wait for next year already.

Want to spend a day fishing Dinorwick. any suggestions as to where we should start? looking for walleyes primarily but if we could find some Crappies that would be a bonus, but i believe that by June 29th they will no longer be shallow. Thanks Spike"
