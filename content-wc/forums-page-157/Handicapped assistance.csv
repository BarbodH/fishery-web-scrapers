6208445,Bakefish,2018-06-13 15:12:00,1077,"Just got back from my umptieth trip to Canada and was wondering something. Do any lodges offer handicap help in any way. We have a guy in our group who may have made his last trip. He has a lot of trouble getting around due to deteriorating health. The lodge owner went out of his way to give us a hand with him, but there were really no aids for the handicapped other than a strong shoulder to lean on. The guy in the cabin next door also had some problems. Looking around the camp, at the stores on the way up and at the motel in International Falls it's pretty obvious that the majority of the folks heading north have definitely crested the hill. I would think that a camp set up for handicapped fishermen would have an advantage over many other camps. A little advertising and you've got yourself a goldmine. Any thoughts?"
6208458,Aspencreek,2018-06-13 18:57:00,2911,"You may be right, it could be a gold mine, problem is depending on the terrain and existing cabin construction it may take a gold mine to get what is needed built, not saying it couldn't be done. The camp I go to has a couple cabins that for the most part are handicap accessible, and a couple more could have ramps installed in addition to the few steps, but the bathrooms are not handicap. That is where the real money will have to be spent. On a similar note, I was wondering what those steel dimpled ""things"" are that are installed at the sidewalk cross walks, I thought they were for traction in the case of ice. So when they were installing them in my neighborhood, I asked the foreman. They are for blind or eyesight impaired individuals so they can know that there is a cross walk. Great idea, interestingly the city of Madison requires them to be painted red. Why?, I'm not sure, but I don't think the blind people care, but they are now required, to comply with ADA."
6208556,Obabikon,2018-06-14 05:25:00,2370,"I think the key would be they'd need to invest in pontoon boats. I've considered buying one for our older guests that can't step down into a boat like they used to. Our island is certainly not handicap friendly... but very few islands made out of granite (every island on the Canadian Shield) will be flat. Interesting niche idea though. It would take the right owner, with a perfect location."
6208558,Paul H,2018-06-14 05:29:00,1232,"Great idea and maybe a business proposition for someone. Might reach out to some Canadian Veterans associations, they may know of something in place."
6208579,pjshorthorn,2018-06-14 07:00:00,5654,"One improvement I read about that the Bow Narrows Camp on Red Lake made to help folks get in and out of boats was that they attached a post(s) to the dock at designated spots where boats would moor each day. That gave older peeps the ability to step in and out of the boats with better stability. I guess you would call it a grabbing post. The design with pictures is probably archived in the blog the former owner Dan Baughman used to write. If I can find it I'll post the link. My Dad took a spill trying to get out of the boat on his own one trip and that was a little scary at his age. A refurbed golf cart to transport older customers to the dock would be a welcomed amenity, I'm sure. If a personable young lady was the golf cart chauffeur, I'm sure that wouldn't offend any of us older fellas that may need a little extra help. This is a good thread topic for sure because we will all be there one day. PjShorthorn"

6208752,northerneyes,2018-06-14 17:09:00,72,I would suggest Bear Paw Lodge on Caribou Lake near Armstrong. They have a great setup for wheelchair bound or less impaired people. Information is on their website. Nice people also.
6209086,camp chef,2018-06-15 15:29:00,915,I haven't been there personally but have friends that fish Bear paw and yes I guess they even have an elevator that goes from one of the cabins right down to the boat dock
