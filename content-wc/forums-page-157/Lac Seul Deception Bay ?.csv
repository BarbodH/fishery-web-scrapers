6208364,Hunts1,2018-06-13 10:57:00,123,We were on Lac Seul for a week and pulled out last Friday from Deception Bay. The water was low. Probably 4 ft at that time. Good luck.
6208380,bigwalleye1,2018-06-13 11:40:00,2632,Wow. Did you go north through the Rags or north through Loon Rapids? How was the water at either location?
6208728,PRO-V16,2018-06-14 15:54:00,454,Talked to my buddy on the sat phone last night. He figures the water is 3' low. He putted through the rags but said boats are also running it on plane. He just bought a new and bigger boat so was just using extra caution.
6208838,Guest,2018-06-14 21:25:00,0,"4-5' down as of last week. As far as the rags, trim up and rip right through. Plenty of water."
6208862,Hunts1,2018-06-15 05:37:00,123,Through the rags with no problem.
