My wife and I were new to crappie fishing and struggled while others brought it limits. Bill asked us to follow him the next day and showed us the ropes. We caught tons of fish and it was one of our best trips ever (44 and counting). Bill is willing to share the knowledge he has gained over decades of fishing in Canada to make it better for others. His lack of selfishness is something for all of us to strive for. I'm grateful for the opportunity to know him and I will follow his example of passing on tips and techniques when I can (not that I have many!). I hope I get the opportunity to fish with him again. By the way, his book is a fun read about what it was like for his Dad, and later Bill, to trek north back in the old days. Thanks Bill!"

I have met many guys who are so full of themselves that I doubt they would even help their mother catch fish. Good to see you found one of the good guys."

6209880,Juls,2018-06-18 06:31:00,13414,Always nice to hear a positive post on this forum. Well done Bill...
6209894,nicko,2018-06-18 07:11:00,508,Refreshing!!!! Never understood the mentality behind the secret spots in areas so vast. Nicely done...

6209940,Mr Ranger,2018-06-18 08:26:00,272,Dido on Bill. I have known him as well for years and is indeed a gem of a guy. I was at his home some years back and he was sharing all the rods and lures he had made and everyone had a story. Unlike most fisherman I think all his stories were true . Thanks for being a great friend buddy.
6209992,Carnhzkr,2018-06-18 09:57:00,964,I'm not sure what dido is but you shouldn't do that on Bill. He's a nice guy.
