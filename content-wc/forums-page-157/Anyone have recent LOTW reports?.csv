6207054,Thompmd,2018-06-10 16:15:00,320,We leave Friday and haven't seen much. I would prefer smallmouth but we fish for everything. Water temps? I assume the fish are in various stages of the spawn? We are going in the Sioux Narrows for the first time but expect it to fish similarly? Will report when we return.
6207094,Redline,2018-06-10 18:00:00,73,I'd also love a report. We're heading to the Sioux Narrows area on Wednesday.
6207110,Wallii1,2018-06-10 18:48:00,37,Just got back from souix narrows. Water temps went up all week to around 60. Fishing was slower than normal but we caught more bigger walleyes than past years. Bass weren't on beds yet. They were caught out a little deeper. With warmer weather the next few weeks should be great. Each day for us got better Enjoy your trip
6207122,martinbns,2018-06-10 19:24:00,1520,"We have had good luck on bass, not in Sioux Narrows but just north of Sunset Channel. Caught a few in very shallow water, but most have been coming up from just off rock shelfs at jerkbaits. Was casting into the rocks then popping the jerk baits out off them into deeper water and doing ok, but when I started casting parrallel to shore in 5-7 feet with the same lure the got excited."
6208016,mrpike24,2018-06-12 15:28:00,54,Bump.....leaving in a couple days and looking for some reports from the Kenora region. Last information i had was water back into the low 60's. Fishing was picking up but not a lot of information. Smallmouth moving back into the shallows after the cold front a week ago. Good luck to everyone making their trip north!
6208026,chris165,2018-06-12 16:06:00,128,"Just got back from Sioux Narrows on Sunday(wed-sun), water temps were 60-66 depending where you were. We primarily targeted smallmouth, did not do as well as we had hoped. Found lots but they were very hesitant to bite anything we tossed. We did manage a dozen or so each day but nothing big. Tried looking for beds once we seen fish schooled up close to spawning areas, didn't even see a bed let alone a fish guarding one. Was very weird, I've never experienced a bass bite like that this early in the season.Back at er tomorrow, we'll be launching out of Northern Harbour this time and camping down towards Sunset Channel for a few days, hoping for some better results this time around!"
6209100,Lazy Fisherman,2018-06-15 16:21:00,276,Any new reports?
6209124,Obabikon,2018-06-15 18:40:00,2370,"Walleyes in the stained side are very deep. Sioux is a different beast altogether though, so take my comments with a grain of salt. Most of our walleye have been 25' or more... which is very uncommon for this time of year. Strange weather pattern this spring. Fishing has been ok, I wouldn't say it has been great, but everyone is catching fish."
6209362,MN_Moose,2018-06-16 12:26:00,964,"Just returned from Kenora. Fishing was very good. Many decent fish. Our group none over 27"". We found walleyes relating to shore structure. Not so much on off shore humps. Some days 30' some days 26'. On very nice days best fish were in 1'. experiment, have fun. Don't get stuck on prior years spots. We found a lot of traffic on the Chisholm trail. Not so much as we got away from there. Water temps 60 to 62. Some back bays as high as 65. I found one spot in Moore where the minnows were moving in. Didn't see any other minnows than that. Didn't get the rain gear out once Great week."
