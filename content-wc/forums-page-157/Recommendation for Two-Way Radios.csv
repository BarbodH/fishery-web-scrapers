We have used some Motorola ones (yellow, not sure of model) in the past and they work ok, but the range really isn't that great. Seems like none work exceptionally well over the water, but I thought I would ask and see if anyone has had better performance with a particular unit. Thanks in advance for any help."

Canadian Shield lakes with islands, rocks and trees will further limit that range depending on what is in the path between radios. Search this forum for more radio info. There have been several threads over the recent time discussing this issue in detail."

The little FRS type radios are good for line of sight, maybe, and marine band handhelds are a good step up, but the ultimate are the tall antenna marines, but the cost goes up as well. I'm running a Standard Horizon brand floating marine radio and I'm very happy with it."

6208415,PRO-V16,2018-06-13 13:16:00,454,Best way is go with 25 watt (console mount) marine band radio and a good 8' antenna. I'm running a Raytheon radio and a Shakespeare 5225 XT antenna (best antenne I've found). The antenna is the most important part. Friends have Cobra and other brand radios but we all use this antenna. Also you will need the metal mount and not the plastic one for this antenna. Shop around and you can find the whole setup for around $300 and it's worth every penny. You can talk for miles.
