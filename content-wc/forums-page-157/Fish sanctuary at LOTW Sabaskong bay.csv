6199006,steve.a,2018-05-23 12:41:00,274,Looking at the Ontario fishing regulations it states that Sabaskong bay is a fish sanctuary from Apr. 1 to June 14th but not say what part. Any one seen a map that shows the exact area?
6208499,reup,2018-06-13 18:40:00,35,"I just read that in the regs as well. I assume it means the whole bay if no boundaries are described. I don't know if this is new, but it sure looks clear to me. I even checked the GPS coordinates, and this is the Morson Sabaskong Bay.The good news is Friday is the 15th, and it should be open after that. I will be up at Morson July 22nd, and was planning on fishing Sabaskong.Lake of the Woods - Sabaskong Bay(49°09'N., 94°09""W.) - Godson Twp. -Kenora District.Fish sanctuary - no fishing fromApr. 1 - June 14."
6208639,johnboat,2018-06-14 10:17:00,2014,"So.........NO FISHING from Morson to Nester Falls during these dates!? Seems a little extreme to me, as it is not just a ""bay"" as one would think. But a very large body of water. I understand and support that a number of lakes will shut down a bay or two for a sanctuary for a short while. But all of Sabaskong Bay? In full disclosure, I have not looked at what the GPS coordinates all include, so some clarification is needed on my part.I would think that would hit the camp owners in the pocket quite hard as well as all other businesses.Is this new and will these dates remain in effect for the future? Thank you."
6208645,DeBo,2018-06-14 11:00:00,211,The Ontario Fish Online shows the sanctuary as the bay directly below falls in Nestor Falls. Makes sense to me.
6208710,reup,2018-06-14 15:08:00,35,"Not sure where these letters and numbers correspond to, but the section on fish sanctuaries in the regs lists the following: The waters of that part of a bay of Sabaskong Bay of Lake of the Woods in the Township of Godson, in the Territorial District of Kenora, lying southeasterly of a line drawn southwesterly from the northwesterly corner of location LK 328 to the most northerly extremity of location HL 20. April 1 to June 14 So probably a very small part of what we call Sabaskong Bay"
