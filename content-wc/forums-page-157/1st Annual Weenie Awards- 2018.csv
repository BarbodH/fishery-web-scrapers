It could be a moment, and event or just an epic failure of some type that earned a person a new nickname, harassment for the week after said incident of just a great story that needs to be shared. I have been a firm believer that every trip to Canada is always an ""adventure"" no matter what ,and that includes some of the events and stories that just complete the adventure. We all know that most everyone has left the plug out of their boat upon launching. That is not worthy for consideration of a Weenie Award. Now, if the boat Sunkist the dock before the issue was noticed that would qualify for consideration. Other examples of Weenie worthy events could be: - A fishing partner not noticing that the cap had come off the pee jug and then ends up peeing all over their own boat. - Running your HB onto a reef at night and then not realizing that the only way you were going to float off or pull it off in the morning was to get everyone off the boat and unload your gear to lighten the load. - Not making sure the flapper fully closed on the houseboat toilet allowing water to continue to run the entire time while out fishing, thus filling the sewage holding tank and overflowing throughout the boat . - Somehow hooking yourself in the head while casting your own lure and getting a nickname HeHooksHimself. - A group member that gets so drunk that they mistake a fishing partner's boots as the cabin toilet and proceed to fill the boots with the excess beer that has built up during the middle of the night. I think you get the idea. I have assembled a crack staff of four WC members that are either twisted or have a sick sense of humor in order to judge which submissions should qualify for consideration of a Weenie Award. I do not get to vote unless there is a tied vote on a submission and I need to be a tie breaker. Once the Canadian soft water fishing season has ended towards the end of October, the top three choices will be put to a poll for the entire WC community to vote on and decide who wins first,second and third place. The community voting poll will be open for one week ending on Halloween. Why doesn't the contest include hard water fishing trips to Canada in 2018? It is quite simple. Everyone knows those trips are just a reason to drink beer to stay warm and then go write your name in the snow. Not Weenie Award worthy in my opinion. Well, if one could write their name in cursive that may actually be pretty impressive. At end of the poll voting there will be luxurious gifts heaped upon the winner(s) which could include bragging rights for 2018, a new nickname for an individual or group that is decided upon by the elected judges, 2018 Weenie Award Certificates ,beer baits for future trips, possibly a very rare ""double donger"" lake trout lure and a lot of good natured harassment from everyone that has enjoyed the stories throughout the season. Although all stories are welcomed, only Canadian trips will qualify for Weenie status consideration. Let the submissions begin!!!!!! Weenie On PjShorthorn"

I just kind of said ""humm really"". The guys had just come from fishing the SPOT and had caught nothing, but it was not at the exact time of day specified by the guide.Talked to another guy a day later who told me he had been fishing the lake for 30 years and no one fished that exact spot.Is the guide a weenie or a savant?"
6206508,That Minnesota guy,2018-06-09 08:23:00,8293,A weenie until you hire him then he becomes a savant by taking you elsewhere (hopefully)
6206592,PRO-V16,2018-06-09 11:25:00,454,Well here's one for you. We stayed at a certain lodge very near Sioux Lookout. The wife of the owner was a piece of work and was always trying schemes to over charge you. I had it out with her a few times and no longer go there. Anyway - a couple years ago some camp guests come back to the lodge from their first day of the trip on Lac Suel and wish to refuel at the pump which is located right out the window of the lodge store. The women mentioned always insists that she pump the gas. Now this is a brand new big Lund. The guys wait patiently in the lodge store wondering what is taking so long. Finally the women enters the store with quite the look on her face and they find out she inserted the pump nozzle in a through the gunnel rod holder and proceeded to fill the hull up with over 50 gallons of gas. Fury ensued and the resort ended up buying them a new boat.

6207296,Ricky Spanish,2018-06-11 10:39:00,1298,"First real trip out in June 2015 with our brand new Edge 175. Loving the Auto Chart Live feature on the Helix 9. A couple of the guides were getting a kick out of reviewing the maps I had made when we returned each evening. One of them uploaded his waypoints to my Helix and it was uncanny how many of the waypoints were ""the spot on the spot"". Cold front conditions brought on a slow afternoon and some cold rain. The bite mostly shut off so we decided to plot a shoal between Kennedy's Bay and West Long Island. You know that spot, between the smaller island and Kennedy's Bay. Part of it just barely breaks the surface, so I kept one eye on that ripple about 50' away and the other on the 'bird's screen. I was pretty shocked when the keel bumped something at idle, as I quickly pulled the new V-Max 150 out of gear and hit the trim. Luckily my skeg stopped us dead, preventing us from completely beaching atop the shoal. The wind was in our faces while the one foot chop bounced and banged my new keel up and down as we teetered there. I realized we had better move to the rear and maybe the waves would push us back off. Luckily, it did. Now I know that shoal extends a good 40' from that high point and a little dock rash doesn't feel so bad compared to the jagged edge on my skeg."
