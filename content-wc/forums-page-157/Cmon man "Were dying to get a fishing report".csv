6204284,Guest,2018-06-04 17:45:00,0,Very similar week on Cedar. Nice report. Too bad about the rock though. We skipped that part. Nice to know about good service in the area. Someday if we go enough were gonna need it too.
6205174,prov1900,2018-06-06 07:21:00,544,"We just got back from Minnitaki. Probably our slowest year ever. There was an immense pollen bloom slick all over the lake. Our walleyes were in the usual spots, they just weren't biting. The ones we caught (majority) were jig and plastics thrown at the shoreline. On the bright side, the pike and smallies were snapping hard. Oh well. There is always next year and I will be there same bat time, same bat channel."
6206524,Remi,2018-06-09 08:51:00,41,"Just returned today. Fishing the week in the Silver Dollar area. Found walleye in 19 to 24 feet. Very slow first few days cold weather, then better later in the week. Not many northern casting the shallow water, but caught them while walleye fishing. Water is 63F now. Bugs are not bad at all, but the breeze probably helped keep them away."
6206562,Mojo-NC,2018-06-09 09:52:00,1929,"My group just returned from Ear Falls yesterday. Awesome year! Walleyes were caught in 8 - 25 feet of water and we caught 'em on everything including spinner rigs, slow-death rigs, jigs, spinners, and some huge fish were caught ripping rattle traps over deep water structure. Water temps were mostly in the mid-upper 50's in the main lake locations, a little warmer in the bays. The weed beds were not very developed as compared with previous years. Jigs caught the most fish as would be expected. Our group caught a 29"", a 29.5"" and three 27"" walleyes, as well as a bunch of 24/25"" fish. I'm pretty sure we all skipped the 26"" category. Several huge pike in the 36"" to 38"" range were also caught. My buddy caught a 36"" and a 36.5"" pike back-to-back (I got to net both fish). And these fish were both toads, not the long skinny ones! It was a great trip and I personally caught at least 2X more fish than previously accomplished in any other trip I've been up there. I'm sure part of the reason is that our electronics are better and we get to know the lake a little better each year. We also saw 9 bears (including a female and 3 cubs) and a couple of moose to make the trip even more special. Good luck and tight lines to all who have yet to visit NW Ontario this year!"
6207242,Willyboy123,2018-06-11 08:15:00,73,Had a great week last week on Lake St. Joseph. Lot's of walleye and some big pike. My grandson got his first 40 incher. We also got a few whitefish. Fish were still fairly shallow. Great week!
6208062,Guest,2018-06-12 17:52:00,0,Lake St. Joseph is on the short bucket list. Saw several posts and did read some blog stories on it. Looks very interesting. Wonder how the fall fishing is there. Congrats to the Grandson!
6208244,Willyboy123,2018-06-13 07:01:00,73,"I'm told the fall fishing is good (September, anyway). But I hear you should take live bait for that time of year. Camp owner says the fish get a little picky. If you wanted more info, call Doug up there. He's a real good guy and knows the lake well. Good luck!"
6208268,kona77,2018-06-13 07:52:00,236,"Report from 6-3 to 6-10- Fished a fly-in lake thru Clarks resorts on Cedar Lake. Our 4th different lake with the Clark's. Fishing was outstanding with countless walleye's including 2-27"" fish. We also had 31 gators over 32"" with the biggest being a 42"" and 40"" fish.. Water levels were down considerably but that did not seem to matter.. Most of the fish were caught in 4-12 fow. Another great trip thru the Clarks but now we have to wait a whole year for another Canadian adventure.. Best of luck to everyone who has trips coming up.."
6208573,bugsy,2018-06-14 06:55:00,49,"Which of Clark's camps was it? Also, which others have you been to. Off to Antenna this season. Which others are good for big pike? Thx!"

6201044,BornToFish,2018-05-28 15:33:00,1224,"Greetings,My first trip of the season is pretty much over. It's been unusually warm in NW Ontario for the last several days. High temperatures pushing 90 degrees F. with clear skies and mostly little wind. The net impact on water temperature has been remarkable, with temperatures shooting up into the upper 50s to low 60s. This morning's walleye bite was simply epic, as it has mostly been lately. The walleyes are pushing deeper along shorelines and points. Walleyes are being commonly found in 12-14 fow along shorelines. This might be because of the high sun skies and relatively calm water plus warming water temperatures. The rock bite has been favored over sand the last few days.Walleyes are starting to show up on the rock humps near shore. However, I haven't connected with enough fish on the rock humps to make this pattern a viable proposition. It won't be too long!The black flies have been something special the last several days for those that are wondering.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6201084,martinbns,2018-05-28 16:56:00,1520,"I find the black fly thing a bit amusing, we fished for 9 hours yesterday, the vast majority of that time within 50 yards of land, used no fly dope and I don't think got bit by anything. Yesterday was amazingly calm which should have made the flies really bad."
6201668,BornToFish,2018-05-29 18:57:00,1224,"Greetings,Martin - be sure to count your blessings! I am still itching.Regards...."
6201702,martinbns,2018-05-29 20:04:00,1520,"The big flies were out today, but not too bad."
6202264,martinbns,2018-05-30 20:26:00,1520,"Fished from 9:30 AM until about 2:30 yesterday for Pike, caught about 15 total with two nice ones around 32"", caught around the same number of Small Mouth with one around 18"" and much to my surprise three smaller make walleye in maybe two feet of water. The Shallower were all stirred up with the water the colour of tea with milk in it. Something must have been spawning in there."
6202390,Bill Krejca,2018-05-31 07:11:00,6107,"Reminds me of an experience on LOW some years ago. While casting along the shore, spotted a patch, perhaps 10 feet wide, of milky water right on the shore, and it wasn't caused by the wind. Cast into it and came up with a very nice pike. It seemed that the fish was engaged in frantic feeding, and had stirred up the water considerably. Past spawn time. Bill"

6202434,martinbns,2018-05-31 08:43:00,1520,"That could very well be what it was, I couldn't see into but there were fish in each of the spots. I was throwing Berkely Juke 4"" jerkbait. Over my last two days out this lure was just awesome. Berkeley has discontinued it though, so I bought a whack of them. Sent from my Pixel XL using Tapatalk"

6198036,Guest,2018-05-21 20:21:00,0,Were dying to here a fishing report for what happening now. Leave Friday for Cedar but any reports will feed us hungry folks.
6198094,Bill Krejca,2018-05-21 21:53:00,6107,Yeah!! Bill
6198152,prov1800,2018-05-22 06:12:00,5010,"Got out on cedar yesterday.walleye fishing was great.water temps are rising.had 54 f on main lake and 57-58 Where me and my wife fished.although we caught a lot of fish the bite was for the most part very light.didnt go to east end.fished mid lake.fished 5 spots and all produced walleyes.didnt try for crappies.might try today or tomorrow for them.mostly caught 15-17"" males with some 19-22"" females. Caught them in 2-12' of water."
6198178,BornToFish,2018-05-22 06:56:00,1224,"Greetings,I am fishing near Red Lake. Opening day was interesting. Water temperature (surface) was in the 49-51 degree F. range. The walleye spawn was over by one to two weeks. I checked several of my usual opening weekend spots and found hit or miss fishing. The fish weren't in some of these spots, but were in others.I fished near one spawning area where a stream enters the lake. It wasn't holding fish. I moved out of that bay a short distance and fished near a shelf that drops into deep water. I found many 18-23 inch walleyes that were belly to the bottom in 24-30 fow. A very slow presentation was the key to my success.I checked several rock humps near shore and found some walleyes were already showing up there.I fished last night just before dark where another stream enters the lake. Eater sized walleyes moved into 3-6 fow in good numbers. We had a great timet catching many of these fish! The bonus was a five pound whitefish. All fish were released.It's worth noting that the black flies came out on Sunday, the day after opener. They made it through the winter just fine.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6198540,Guest,2018-05-22 18:11:00,0,Now that's the kind of detailed information I can start use to start thinking about where to start the week. I appreciate it greatly. Likely applies to a lot of lakes in the area now. Staying at Clark's for the third year. Taking my Brother-in-law and hes always chasing crappies so he should have a blast. Going to Cliff one morning to have fun with a few lakers.
6199726,Guest,2018-05-24 19:30:00,0,9 hours till we leave for Dryden. On the water of Cedar by 9am Saturday. Can't wait. Not sure how much I will sleep tonight!
6199896,Remi,2018-05-25 07:29:00,41,"We leave in 7 days, gets the excitement going to read about water levels, water temps. But I'm very curious on the mosquitos this year. Seems like a bunch of warm weather, and here in middle of Wisconsin the biting bugs are out in force. Wonder how the biting bugs are in different areas of Canada."
6200154,martinbns,2018-05-25 17:48:00,1520,"They will be out in virtually every part of Canada you would choose to go fishing in except maybe Salmon trolling in the middle of one of the Great Lakes. Death, Taxes and flies of all varieties."
6200398,prov1800,2018-05-26 16:31:00,5010,"Fished cedar again wed and Fri.fishing was good good wed with a light bite still.on Fri way more fish and still a light.water temps 75 f in some bays and even off points.there are still fish in shallows and some deeper.but that's spring for you.caught mostly males still with a fairly good number of bigger females up to around 23"".fri I tried for some crappies again also and there have been a lot moved in to spawning areas.good bite.wouldnt take long to get a limit.i only kept a few for tonight's fish fry and a few perch and walleye.fishing this week is going to get real good."
6200850,martinbns,2018-05-28 07:06:00,1520,"We were out yesterday just north of Sunset Channel. Caught walleye in 5-20 feet of water. Bite was soft. Wife had 25ish right beside the boat in 5 feet of water before it flopped off, the others were caught mostly in around 12-16' all eaters, 14-16"". Fished a few bays with jerk baits midday caught a pile of smaller SMBass and some decent pike. Saw a couple of huge muskie that followed our lures in. Walleye I would say are half way to summer locations on the humps, surface temps in deeper water was 67f and in the bays just over 70f."
