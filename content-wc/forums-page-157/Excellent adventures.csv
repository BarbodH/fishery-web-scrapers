6207310,smithcr1981,2018-06-11 11:15:00,42,I just got done searching extensively to find out information on excellent adventures out of read lake. I was unable to find anything recent. I checked their website and it appears to be a pretty good place at a reasonable price. Just wondering if anyone has any recent experience from this year or last year with them. I am trying to get a trip together for the summer of 2019. It is between them and Chimo. I was considering Viking out posts but I see they were recently sold and it seems like it may be a bit confusing as to what's going on Thank you for any information
