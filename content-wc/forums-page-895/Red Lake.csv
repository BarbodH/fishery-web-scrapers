So, since I won't be there, you might as well take some fish for me! ;-) I've had more luck with crawlers in a spinner rig for the walleyes when they're shallow. When they're deep, a white jig and minnow usually work. Of course, look for any Mayfly action.The Pike are all over the place in the shallows at that time. I like a F18 Rapala in Silver/Black or a Hammered Copper with Orange stripe casting spoon. Not many weed beds at that time, so finding a rice field usually holds numbers.I hear that they've been having problems with the Lake Trout, so don't bring any 1+ oz white bucktail jigs with you - you might get in trouble.I haven't been up that far north, but I hear that the East Narrows can produce quite a bite at times.Good luck and have some fun.- Rick"
