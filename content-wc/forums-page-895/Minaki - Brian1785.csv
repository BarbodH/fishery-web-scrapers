My buddy and I are looking for some local waters to try for a day trip. Thanks for all your help last year. You really put us on some nice fish with the information you shared. Sorry about your rig at the dock. Hopefully you'll have better luck this year. If you have any suggestions for a day trip somewhere, give me an email. Thanks Rob and looking forward to hearing from you or hooking up in June.Brian [email protected]"
