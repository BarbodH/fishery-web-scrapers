528089,alan ex pup,2003-03-10 01:01:00,126,one more thing. when they ask a question make sure one person is going to answer unless its directed to a specific person. it happened once to us. they asked something and we both answered a different answer- duh. this keeps things from getting complicated.
528078,Guest,2003-02-27 17:29:00,0,"Will be taking what may be a once-in-a-lifetime fishing trip late this summer. Am heading North of Dreyden near Lac Suel. What I don't need is trouble at the border with common things that may be prohibitted or restricted without my knowledge. I already know that guns, ammo, etc. are out. No minnows, also no crawlers in soil.What about fillet knives and camping axes? How about either liquid or propane camp stove and lantern fuel? What is the best thing to do about prescription medications? Can I take tobacco or alcohol across the border?Since I am new to this board and have never crossed an international border in my life, is there a place to go to get this information. Would appreciate any and all help to make this trip successful.Thanks again, Joe"
528079,Eric,2003-02-27 17:40:00,114,You covered the basics. Also helps to have a birth certificate copy (not absolutely necessary) or at least photo id of everybody in car.2 40 ounces of hard liquor or wine or 24 cans of beer per person over 21 3. 50 cigars or i think 1 cartoon of smokes per person 4 No handguns and best not to bring any firearm. Be polite and courteous5 I like to cross early or late in the day to avoid linesI have never been hassled either way and have crossed probably 20 times. Good luck and have fun on your trip. Eric

528081,Trailerguy,2003-02-27 18:07:00,1407,"They also have to be in the original bottle, not one of those single pill/each day/type containers."
528082,Peanut,2003-02-28 08:39:00,929,"Also, you cannot bring leeches in. I live in Canada, we are not even allowed to bring them across provincial borders, technically. You are right, crawlers in commercial bedding is fine, and frozen/salted minnows are okay too, I think.If you're cooking your own food, there may be some other issues with respect to things like fresh fruit. You're probably better to buy that kind of stuff on the Canadian side.Fillet knives, axes, etc. should be no problem. Switchblades or butterfly knives are not allowed, probably no surprise there.As for propane, camp fuel, I'm not sure - hopefully someone else here can speak to that.Finally, and I cringe bringing this up - make sure no one in your vehicle has a criminal record - if they do, there are two options - get a permit to cross, or they take their chances. Even DWI's count. There are about 2,000 too many posts on this topic already, so I'll leave it there for now. Feel free to ask if you have more questions on this. And, if I don't see you when you get here, welcome! ;)derrek.""It's the weaseling out of things that sets us apart from the animals.... Except the weasel."" - H.J. Simpson"
528083,Guest,2003-02-28 09:03:00,0,They pretty much covered everthing for you but everyone in your vehicle should take off sunglasses when talking to them.Just answer all of there questions and be polite and you wont have any problems.Good luck fishing.
528084,Guest,2003-02-28 11:39:00,0,"I've bought lantern fuel over the border dozens of times with no problem. You can get official info from the Canadian immigration website - easy to find on any internet search engine. The last post said it best, be polite, honest and respectful, and you'll be welocomed into Ontario. This may be your first trip to Canada, but it won't be your last."
528085,Guest,2003-02-28 13:52:00,0,Do I want to take my glasses off if I have the crazy eye? It might scar them!
528086,fishmaster,2003-02-28 16:39:00,209,"Just follow the rules and answer only the question they ask and be friendly look them in the eyes and taking off the sunglasses is a good idea.I have been going to Canada since 1977 and have never been pulled over , I can even remember when I was a little kid and going with my family and we only got pulled once then cause there were 4 families crossing and we all had boats with.I am shure if you check out the Canada web sites on border crossing and follow the rules you won't have a problem.Now i KNOCK ON WOOD I will probably get pulled this year.Good Luck and enjoy the trip."
528087,alan ex pup,2003-03-01 01:16:00,126,"what ever you do dont cross on saturday morning either way. the line will be a mile long or more literally. coming back one saturday at intl falls the line went all the way to the the city limits of fort francis, must have been 5 miles. Can yo imagine the wait from there? we found this out later- because some idiot was trying to smuggle stupid beenie babies accross. We went to baudette instead. Besides the paper mill screws you good to use their bridge. the baudette bridge is free and there is no line."
