528258,BD,2003-03-08 03:22:00,739,A good camp on the English River system is www.presslake.on.ca It is the only camp (buildings) on the 9000 acre lake. I met ggg there a couple of years ago. Our parties had great fishing for eyes and northerns. Press Lake camp may have a housekeeping cabin opening due to a cancellation in June but you would have to get on a waiting list. They do have some openings in Aug. and Sept. They also have some nice campsites which should still have openings if you are into camping. Just checked the prices for 2003. A housekeeping cabin is $185.00 per person with a minimum of four persons per cabin (launching and docking included).

528260,lunker99,2003-03-09 18:58:00,236,"Matt, I have fished below Manitou dam from shore for several years, which is near the parking spot for the camp you're going to. Catch plenty of walleyes and northern there, plus an occasional smallmouth. No experience with the muskies, so can't give any insight there. When are you going up?"
528261,Guest,2003-03-10 06:29:00,0,We are going late June / early July. We are staying at the outpost on Goose Lake.
528248,Guest,2003-03-06 07:31:00,0,"I won an individual free weeks stay at this lodge from a walleye expo in January, the only condition is that it has to be a party of two and only one free certificate can be used per party. From the info I was sent, a week costs between $625-700, depending on the size of your party.I was wondering if anyone out there is familiar with this lodge, and also the fishing around it. Also, if anyone is planning a trip to this lodge and does not have a free pass, let me know because I am not 100% sure i will be able to use it."

528250,Guest,2003-03-06 11:47:00,0,"My recommendation would be not to go. My buddy won a trip to this resort last year and like idiots we went. The owners of the camp weren't very clear on how much this would cost us and we nearly didn't have enough money. We arrived there at 10:30 am so we could check in and start fishing. We had been told that this was acceptable. It's a 20 minute boat ride from the ramp. When we arrived we were told we couldn't fish until we had paid and that the man we needed to pay was picking up customers and wouldn't be available for quite a while. We sat in their lodge for four hours before we could pay. It was around 100 degrees and high humidity just to top things off. Not the way I wanted to start a trip. I could go on for a long time but I'll cut it short. The fishing for walleyes was horrible. Noone in the camp caught a walleye over 17 inches the whole week and the most walleyes caught in a day by a group was around 15. I will say the northern fishing was incredible. Seemed like we could have caught a northern every cast. Anywhere from 25-35 inches.No help from the camp owners. Didn't seem like they cared if you caught fish or not. Cabins were ok, but they ran on a generator and it was turned off at 11 every night. No bedding in the cabins. They also had outhouses but were working on bathroom facility. Can't imagine it's done though. The outhouses were disgusting and most people took to pulling up on shore somewhere and taking care of business. For the money you could do a great deal better. Don't go. Sorry so long winded."
528251,Guest,2003-03-06 12:04:00,0,"This camp does this every year, it is a gimmick to get newbie's money. They give away 1 ""freebie"" to get you to bring a party to camp. When you look at the total $$$$ your freinds just payed them for your ""freebie"". Think about it,if they need to be deceptive in order to get you into camp, what else are they capable of?"
528252,Guest,2003-03-06 12:41:00,0,"Dverbronc,I may have trip you would be interested in. My family got a $300.00 gift certificate for me to fish at Little Canada Camp also on the English River. I am not going to be able to use it this summer and would like to find someone who could. I am willing to sell it for less than face value. If you have any questions you can check out my thread for Little Canada Camp on this website or E-mail me at [email protected] I have called and spoken to the owners and have also spoken with guys who have stayed there. Seems like a pretty nice place and nice people.Joe"
528253,BD,2003-03-06 15:01:00,739,Search for Naughty Pines in the archives. This camp has received bad comments from many WC members.
528254,Guest,2003-03-06 17:31:00,0,"You didn't win squat!!! You and everyone else who registered ""Won"". Stay home!!!!"
528255,fishmaster,2003-03-06 17:45:00,209,Look at the responses from the above guy's they are telling you what most all of us heard last year at this time when we all went to sport shows around the midwest and it seems like everyone you talk to won the same trip. People who have or know people that have been there will tell you stay home or go to a respectable camp that has a good reputation.
528256,ggg,2003-03-06 20:55:00,115,"You have won the opportunity to get screwed! Same problem with check in as to the money. Other guests also paid more than quoted. Owner was never to be found the week we were there last year. First they tried to put 3 old fat guys in 2 bunk beds and when we refused, after much grumbling by them, they brought us in a single bed. That took up all the room in our 6x10 bed room. All of their boadwalks are rotting. Twice 1 of our guys broke thru the walk. Lucky no broken legs. We had a lower cabin with one on top of ours. Every time someone farted we could here it not to mention being kept up all nite by the upstairs people talking and moving chairs around. The out houses were Ok but a suicide trip to get there. ( Up the hill, over the roots, thru the mud, and around the junk.) Quite a trip at nite ! Don't take a wrong turn or you may end up in a hole where last years house was. Very poor boat dockage! Don't pull up on the beach because boats get swamped with any kind of west wind. Probably caught 100 walleyes per day but none over 18"" for the week. All of people I met there, it was their first trip there. Stopped at their booth at Green Bay sports show and never found a sole in the booth. Just paper to sign up for a chance at a "" FREE "" trip. They can't even face the potential suckers. After 30 trips to Canada, this was by far the worst place for the money I have ever been. Even if it was for free, I would not go back there."
528257,Guest,2003-03-07 13:32:00,0,"We are going to Manitou Falls Resort this summer which is just down the river from these guys. Man am I glad we chose this place instead of Pines. My only fear is that everyone who has fallen for this free trip is saying the fishing stinks. Anyone fished this area and done well? We are mostly Musky guys, but a couple of eye guys as well."
