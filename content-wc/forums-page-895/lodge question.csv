528472,Guest,2003-03-10 12:36:00,0,"Jimbo, no one is responding because the lodge has been closed for several years. Multi-Million dollar complex including golf course. Not what I think of when going to Canada for a fishing vacation but for some maybe OK>. Opening this year under new mgmt....did alot of shows, we'll see if it flys this time?"
