528074,Bruce,2003-03-10 19:27:00,48,Too early to say.I don't agree with the last post about the spawn.I live next to a Walleye lake and they never come upthe creek until the ice is in the process of going out.Post about ice out predictions in a month. If you are going up the 1st week of June tradionally is a great time to catch Walleyes.
