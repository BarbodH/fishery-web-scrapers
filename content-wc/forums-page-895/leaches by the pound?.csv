Does anybody know of a Canadian bait supplier that I can order leaches from? I would like to just have them mailed to my hotel, in Kenora, the day before I fly out.Any tips on who to contact would be appreciated.Thanks,Greg"

528488,BD,2003-03-10 18:22:00,739,Check to see if the Can-Op station will be open when you do through. If not there is a good bait shop in Fort Francis on Hwy 11 east. It would be a couple of miles out of your way but their prices are fair. The prices were out of site the last time I checked the bait shop in Sioux Narrows.
528489,manitobawalleye,2003-03-10 18:33:00,885,maybe phone the baitstore in kenora and pre-order them...why risk the mail....do not have any names and #'s but that is what i would do

528491,Dave,2003-03-11 07:08:00,258,The name of the Can-Op store is Rainy Lake Sports in Fort Frances phone 807-274-6429. I believe Mark Fontana still owns the business.
528492,Thumper,2003-03-11 07:28:00,133,"Hi, GregHave you talked with your outfitter, yet? Figure they have a few people each week that want live bait. If they don't pick it up for you then the probably know the best place for you (and the guys the week before and after you) to pickup or arrange the bait.The outfitter for my fly-in gave me the name of a bait store just a mile from the check-in point that's open 24 hours. I'll be able to pick up a few dozen minnows for the flight in. Then, on the check flights, the outfitter will drop off a couple dozen more during the week. If they'll do that for minnows, I'm sure they'd do that for leeches, with leeches being so much hardier then the minnows.I'd figure that if they DO handle the bait for you, they'll probably charge a little more than what you'd pay at the bait store yourself. Their time is worth something, just like yours and mine is. But, you'd still be paying an additional charge if you had your bait mailed to you."
