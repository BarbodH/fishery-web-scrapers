You will share an enclosed porch with whomever is staying in the other three or four rooms in the cabin. Its more like a motel with a common porch. Can be a privacy issue.

527290,Guest,2003-02-04 14:31:00,0,"Any comments or experiences at Wiley Point Lodge. Looking for a place to take my wife, and don't want it to be too rustic. This place is a little pricier than I would want, but it sure looks nice. Especially curious to hear from anyone who brought their own boat. If you did, is there any problem launching your boat at Totem and fishing there that day before check in time at 3:00 (or after check out on day of departure)?Also, what's the fishing like in that part of the lake (walleyes northern, muskies)? I understand this is not the clear water area of the lake like you find in Whitefish Bay. Is this correct? Also, does anyone know what CHS map covers this area? (I cut up and laminated my map which covered Witch Bay, Andrew Bay, Bigstone, etc.) Hopefully I didn't throw out the part that covered Wiley Point.Thanks for any info. Bill"
527291,Guest,2003-02-04 14:52:00,0,I think it's either 6212 or 6213.
527292,GLO,2003-02-04 20:10:00,318,"Meals are first class. If you have a room downstairs in the lodge, make sure you are not under or adjacent to the upstairs or downstairs bar, or you'll hear it all night long. Don't know what the cabins are like. Went out with their guides in early Spring and did well with no long jaunts, and yes, I wouldn't classify the water as clear. We seemed to be mostly east and/or South when we were fishing, lots of good sized walleye and perch, occasional northern, but didn't fish for northerns or musky,specifically, musky season was closed at that time. Lots of islands and rocks, be careful in that area. Caught some good numbers, not necessarily size, of walleye and perch in evenings on our own and not far from the lodge."
527293,Guest,2003-02-06 09:45:00,0,I fished there about 7 or 8 years ago. I had a great time. It would be a good place to take the wife. Excellent food and service. I was were there in late July and the fish were stacked on the reefs within 5 miles of the resort. I also caught a 45 inch muskie while trolling cranks for W's. TGG
527294,Guest,2003-02-10 12:39:00,0,"It's nice, but sure no bargain. More for the guy who doesn't want to bring his own boat and does want a guide. But for those who would rather do it themselves, well there are better choices. Such as Crowrock, Witch Bay, and Pipestone Point to name a few. These places are more for the hands on type of guy. However, if you want great food and a bar and maybe a little something else, this might be your place."
527295,Guest,2003-02-11 18:43:00,0,I agree with the something else ( Definitive a business man lodge )
527296,River_eye,2003-02-12 17:19:00,1486,"Is tipping important to you? I have heard from two different people that have worked for totem resorts that the manager keeps the tips till the end of the season, and is a little bit crooked about it. These two people definately do not know each other."
527297,alan ex pup,2003-02-12 17:52:00,126,From what i have seen this is the type of place for people where money is not an object. business expense type of place where in the end the tax payer pays for their fun because it becomes a write off. same for the other 2 lodges they own
527298,GLO,2003-02-12 20:08:00,318,"As I say, was there early Spring, but none of the groups there when we were there were business ""junkets"". Don't know what the managers do or do not do with tips, in fairness, will say that we got cancelled by a nearby resort that couldn't open in time just four days before we were set to head up there and Wiley not only took us in, but honored the deal from the other place. Did they need us in? Sure, they had room. But they didn't have to honor the rate the other lodge had quoted and we were able to verify it was considerably better than others there at the time. Thought that was pretty nice gesture and we were treated as well as anybody else."
527299,River_eye,2003-02-13 23:02:00,1486,"That's all well and good, but I'm just saying that if you tip, give it directly to the staff member."
