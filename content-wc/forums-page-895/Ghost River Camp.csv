527236,red2,2003-02-03 17:43:00,16,"Alan, I've been there sevral times. But I'm not sure if it was ghost river or sturgeon river, they own both of them and its been sevral years since we were there.One is house keeping plan (thats the we were at) the other american plan. The fishing was great, lots of walleye lots of northern, never caught hugh fish but lots of numbers and thats what we wanted anyways. There was allways a chance of a big one anyways. Lots of water and lots of exploring!! Nice cabins, first time there they had no indoor bathrooms, but since have upgraded very nice. Good boats and motors very nice camp allround. I was never very impressed with Darrel (he is the son and runs the house keeping camp) he lacks people skills as far as I'm concerned. But other than that I really like the place. Thought about going back with my girlfriend, you don't have to deal with him once you leave camp to go fishing. He just seemed indifferant to you and like you were a stupid american and really didn't help you out to much with fishing information, but I was there before he took over and I didn't need his help. Good luck and have fun. It is a nice camp, I would go again. Tim"

527238,Guest,2003-03-07 09:47:00,0,"Alan,My brother went up there last year for the first time and we will be makning it a reqular trip. The fishing was fantastic, walleye and norther. The hospatality was first rate can't beat it. Cabins had hot/cold running water very comfortable. From the start it is an adventure with lots of wildlife. We boated a couple of 8lb walleye and a lot of nice fish. I would highly recommend booking with them, and when you get up there take a guide (Donnie) for a day he was a great help. Don't forget that you can portage to multiple lakes and fish multiple presenations (humps, flats, falls, river systems.....).Goog Luck"
