IT'S THE SPINELESS POLITICIANS.I'm assuming you've read all the newpaper articles concerning the cost, ownership, and maintenance of the bridge over the past three years. The mill has been trying to get rid of it but the Province of Ontario (which has eminent domain over it - the U.S. has none) doesn't want to pay for it, so they suggested the City of Fort Frances pay for it. They polled the citizens about doubling property taxes to pay for it. That didn't go far. Then they all got together and told the paper mill - ""You're stuck with it"".DON'T BLAME THE PAPER MILL."
528200,alan ex pup,2003-03-08 21:41:00,126,"Then why is the paper mill collecting money for a round trip when you go into Canada. They should make it free. Don't tell me it is for upkeep, because the fee has more than doubled in the past few years. The paper mill is making a nice profit off it."
528202,alan ex pup,2003-03-09 00:08:00,126,"I forgot to mention this earlier. We have crossed over into Canada at Baudette over a bridge and its free, at port Huron around detroit over a biggg bridge and it was free, over another bridge at Buffalo New York and it was free. I dont understand why this is probably the only toll bridge there is to get into Canada. If the ##### paper mill does not want to own it they should just close it down to ALL traffic except for their paper trucks. With a stranglehold like that I bet the politicians would do something. No one being able to cross would get something done quick! The bridge being privately owned they can do whatever they want and so they mustchoose to keep collecting the toll."
528190,Guest,2003-03-03 11:41:00,0,What is the worst possible time to cross the border at International falls. How bad is it from 3-5 pm.
528191,Andyeye,2003-03-03 14:27:00,179,Are you crossing on Friday? It could be busy at that time. Are you crossing at International Falls? International Falls is the toughest place to cross at. Saturday mornings are the worst. I usually cross on Friday night about 6pm to 7pm and it has not been too bad.
528192,Noel,2003-03-04 18:00:00,115,"at International Falls, on any Saturday, from about 9 AM to 6 PM it is horrible. You could be in a line that would take you 1-2 hours to get across. Plan on crossing any other time."
528193,Karl,2003-03-05 12:50:00,63,"The worst time is Saturday morning and early afternoon, either direction. Only at International Falls/Ft. Frances. Other entry points are never a problem."
528194,JB,2003-03-05 15:23:00,109,How would crossing on a Friday morning between 8am and 10am at Int. Falls be.
528195,Guest,2003-03-05 15:27:00,0,"We've only had hold ups crossing International falls, we now cross at pigeon river and have never had to wait more than 5 mins."
528196,Guest,2003-03-05 20:14:00,0,"We always cross going up at 1:00 on Friday- no problem, maybe 5 min. Coming back we cross at 11:oo on Friday and no hassle."
528197,alan ex pup,2003-03-06 00:42:00,126,where is pigion river. we used to cross at intl falls till we got tired of getting screwed by the bridge owners. the US could save a lot of trouble by nationalizing that bridge. They have been collecting tolls on that bridge since I was a kid 50 years ago. They have made a killing. We cross both ways now at Baudette no lines either way and at any time. screw the paper mill.
528198,Guest,2003-03-06 05:22:00,0,Pigeon River is straight on 61North of Duluth.
528201,Guest,2003-03-08 14:54:00,0,Friday 5a.m. no problem at all International FALLS.
