528432,Guest,2003-03-10 13:56:00,0,I was there last year and stayed in the loft cabin. Our group caught two northern in the 40 plus range. we also caught many fish in the high 30's. The average northern was in the 30-35 inch range. The walleye average was in the mid 20's. the biggest walleye was 29.5 inches. the lodge had very nice boats with 40 horse motors. We used orange floating jigs tipped with leaches for walleye. For northern we used large five of diamond spoons and large northland spinner baits.The best place for northern was a five minute trip from the lodge in the reeds next to the inlet. toad
