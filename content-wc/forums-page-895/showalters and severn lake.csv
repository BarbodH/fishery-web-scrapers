527811,Hammerhead Herb,2003-02-18 12:31:00,259,"Ray, I've been going with Showalters since '91. Our group (from N Central Illiois) has been using them since the early 80's. I am quite satisfied with Showalter's. They put a lot back into their outposts. I haven't fished Severn but understand that it is a very good walleye lake; I'm not sure how good the pike fishing is. It is about their furthest most northern outpost. I think that the flight up their is about 1.5 hours.If you are interested, send me your email address and I'll see if I can contact one of the Severn guys from Minooka/Joliet area. I haven't seen them since I retired but will hunt them up. They've fished Severn a number of times.Can you guess which Showalter outpost I go to.Hammerhead Herb"

527813,Guest,2003-03-10 20:27:00,0,"Ray,I have been using Showalters since the early 90's and am very pleased with the service and fishing. I have also been to Severn a couple of times. If you want more info on where we have caught lots of 'eyes and good size northern, you can email to me at ewallem @mchsi.com and I will be glad to give you some insights on what we have found up there.What time of year are you going, it could make a difference. We go in early spring, usually late May or early June."
527814,Guest,2003-03-10 20:52:00,0,Showalter's is a top notch outfitter. I have fished Action Lake in early June and Cochrane Lake (River)in late June. Both trips were outstanding. The facilities and fishing were great.
