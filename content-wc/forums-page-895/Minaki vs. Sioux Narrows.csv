We are primarily interested in catching in June good size walleyes but not trophy fish. Can anyone give us some honest, objective feedback? Thank you."
528367,Reels,2003-03-07 06:41:00,2876,"Last year was a slow year in Minaki as a whole. There were a few good weeks, but with the water levels going nuts, it was hard to establish patterns. Should be better this year.<{{}}><"
528368,brian1785,2003-03-07 12:58:00,1534,I too was in Minaki the last 2 years. Last year water levels were fluctuating. It took us a couple of days to find a pattern but when we did the fishing was good. The year before was better for us. We'll be going up June 15 this year. Hopefully the water levels will be more stable. Sorry I can't comment on the Sioux Narrows area.
528371,Guest,2003-03-07 13:47:00,0,"With the exception of last year (due to the fluctuation water levels like I havn't seen in some 20 years up there) the fising on the Winnipeg River system (Minaki) has been improving year after year for all species (except pike for some reason). Now if we could just get the big lodge owners there to promote catch and release instead of making sure every one of their guests limits (sometimes even twice in one day) and eating every single fish in the limit for shore lunch's, the fishing will be like it was 20 years ago. I appluad the MNR for the size and catch limitations imposed over the last several years but the fisherman need to do their part to."

If not, I would consider staying at a lodge that is located out there in the heart of the good walleye grounds which are world class, both size and numbers. Try Witch Bay, Crow Rock, Pipestone Point, or Wiley Point. All real close to the best walleye on the north end of the Woods. Try this service to find the place you are looking forhttp://www.justfishontario.com/trip_finder.htmIt worked for me."
528372,dlhomes,2003-03-07 18:57:00,62,"I agree with Victor on his choice of lodges however I don't think you have to travel that far out in June. Just cast/ troll the islands and shorelines of Regina And lobstick bays should provide lots of action from smallies, eyes and bonus northern.My favorite June spot in only 1/2 mile from my pier! Any way you go I just don't think LOTW will disappoint. Never been to Minaki. Good Luck."

What about the fishing near the Totem Lodge area if you do not want to travel all the way to Wiley Point?"
528373,dlhomes,2003-03-08 21:41:00,62,"Andrew- I think you could run 10 minutes East or West from Totem and do good in June. Also can hit the bay?? can't think of the name just minutes from Totem and get some nice crappies. I also got a huge largemouth there last June approx. 20"" - THE only largemouth I have ever caught on LOTW a real surprise!!!"
528374,brian1785,2003-03-09 00:26:00,1534,What was I thinking? I have been to Witch Bay the last 2 of 3 years and the fishing was awesome. Lots of different types of water near them. I would highly recommend them if you're looking for a good resort that is not afraid to give you straight information for finding fish.
