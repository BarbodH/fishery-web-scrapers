528364,bigfish1965,2003-03-08 08:31:00,3210,"We only managed to limit out on 12 pounders seven times last spring. What happened to our great fishing? We used to limit out on 12 pounders every day! I tell ya, something's very wrong with our lakes. Nothing says 'I'm a man' more than a freezer full of 12 pounder fillets...yum-yum!"
528365,Guest,2003-03-08 17:55:00,0,"you boys got it all wrong... out here in the stix we catch 12 lb walleye, set'em on the road have the car ready and when crows and dem scavenger varmints come out onto the dirt road to eat the walleye WHAM... then of course Pa cleans the roadkill and Ma cooks the walleye and everything we hit with our '36 ford pick up. the walleye really lights quickly with all that rubber on it from dem tires. spring is almost here...."
528353,Ivy,2003-03-07 10:29:00,556,"Oh you guys!You're just a bunch of kidders.Me?I don't really like the taste of fish. So when I catch a huge fish I usually throw it up on shore for the birds and the Black flys. But all this talk about food has made me hungry. Don't knock a Panda Bear steak with a side of California Condor until you tried it.Deeeelish.Ivy"" Doing business with out advertising is like fishing with out a hook. You may look like you know what you're doing but in the end, you will go hungry."""
528354,Shorelunch,2003-03-07 12:06:00,554,"I use the same recipie for 12lb walleye that I do for baby seal. Also, 12 pounders are better when they're caught in early May when the water really cold - usually around the 1st - 5th of May. The key is to keep stirring it with elephant tusks and my trusty tiger paw spatula. Excellent with a side of beluga caviar and a Blue."
528355,Guest,2003-03-07 12:45:00,0,By way of an a appetizer be sure to start with some smoked 50 inch musky though :)
528356,brian1785,2003-03-07 12:45:00,1534,Catch it pre-spawn and take the eggs for cavier. Then add a side order of snow-owl and you've got some good eatin'.
528357,Peanut,2003-03-07 12:55:00,929,"You guys are disgusting, I'm tellin' ya. Those walleyes over 10 pounds are nothing but rough fish. The best use we have found for these things is to cut them up to use for bait for catching Northerns. I'm tellin' ya, nothing beats pulling in one hammer handle after another with their jaws clamped around some big old walleye meat!derrek.""It's the weaseling out of things that sets us apart from the animals....

528360,Guest,2003-03-07 14:57:00,0,Lots of middle east oil.
528361,Guest,2003-03-07 19:04:00,0,"Shove it up a mooses a$$, give the mouse an enema with a quart of lighter fluid, light the tail, after about thirty seconds the walleye will fly out. Smother in butter, nothing better...."

528344,Guest,2003-03-06 19:44:00,0,"Just bake it, the same way you cook a Bald Eagle."
528345,bigfish1965,2003-03-06 22:22:00,3210,I find bald eagle tastes a lot like Common Loon or Whistler Swan.
528346,Arkie eye jerker,2003-03-06 22:31:00,228,"I would compare them more to a whooping crane, only a little tougher."
528348,5Paulie4,2003-03-06 22:38:00,34,First...catch a 12 lb walleye...Thunderstick
528349,Guest,2003-03-07 08:41:00,0,Just cook'em half as long as a 24 pounder...:)
528347,Guest,2003-03-07 09:12:00,0,Cook them the same way you do a 45lb muskie... roast her..lol!
528350,Peanut,2003-03-07 09:40:00,929,"What! You don't cook a 12 pound walleye. That's crazy.What are you an idiot - they'd taste like garbage!........................We usually just bonk 'em on the head and pitch 'em in the garbage ;)derrek.""It's the weaseling out of things that sets us apart from the animals....

528351,Guest,2003-03-07 09:43:00,0,"I remember a post similar last year about cooking a 30"" walleye. Somone from Iowa posted that they soak them in milk first. Last year I caught a 28"" on LOTW, not sure of the weight though. It was the sweetest tasting walleye I ever had. Tried soking them little 16-18 inch walleyes and they did not taste nearly as good.Try soaking that 12lb in milk, it does the body good!"
528352,Guest,2003-03-07 09:49:00,0,Nothing better than a 12lb walleye with a side of skinned and broiled cat.Washed down with a Blue of course.Bigfish
