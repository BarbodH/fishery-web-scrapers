Let the Credit Card company facilitate out of Country comversion for you. Also, if you plan to use your Credit Card out of country or are traveling highly recommend you make a travel plan with your Credit Card company in advance of your travel to avoid them declining transactions due to being “out of the norm” transactions for you. Just call the toll free # on your card and request to make a travel plan and will walk you through how to do that!Good luck"

6668670,7 Mag,2022-06-28 14:22:00,1887,LOL I hear you John!!
6668674,prov1800,2022-06-28 14:24:00,5010,No receipts.
6668676,ackvil,2022-06-28 14:29:00,177,"We gave shopped at Safeway stores in FF, Dryden, and other towns. We always use a credit card since we don't like to be bothered with Canadian money."
6668520,Pooch,2022-06-28 05:07:00,4618,Same as the bait shop question but now grocery stores? What are suggested grocery stores going west out of Fort Francis route through Sioux Narrows then to Vermilion Bay? Pooch
6668526,Eckohlt,2022-06-28 05:24:00,3685,I believe there's a Walmart west out of FF.
6668536,rbbobo,2022-06-28 05:56:00,10,"In addition to Walmart, there is a nice grocery store in Emo. Nestor Falls has store which is also an LCBO. Gill's Trading Post in Sioux Narrows is also a nice store. They have bait as well."
6668546,Bill Krejca,2022-06-28 06:22:00,6107,"I frequently stop at the Emo store. Their bread is fresh, lots of food varieties, good parking for boat trailers. Also, the beer/liquor store is just a stones throw away, both on north side of the highway, right across from the local gendarmes. When coming from Rainy river, I even drive the extra couple miles to go there. The store in Nestor Falls also is OK, not quite as large a selection, maybe. Bill"
6668554,10point,2022-06-28 07:04:00,102,The Wal-Mart in FF opens up at 8 am. There is a coop grocery store in Vermillion Bay that is nice. I believe it's closed on Sundays.
6668556,nitroman,2022-06-28 07:13:00,368,"Dalsegs in Nestor, stopped there a lot over the years. they have beer and booze as well."
6668558,Twodogs,2022-06-28 07:19:00,115,"Pooch...There is a Safeway about 3 blocks to the East when you clear Customs in FF...we shopped there last week. Nice store stocked shelfs, plenty of boat parking. The Cloverleaf I think was the grocery store in Emo ..it's a big building right on 11 and as Bill says the LCBO is practically next door. Fishing was fantastic...have fun ! Fred"
6668562,Eckohlt,2022-06-28 07:27:00,3685,Remember the farther north you go to get food the deeper you dig in the wallet.
6668596,SweetD,2022-06-28 10:05:00,243,Safeway in Fort Frances
6668600,7 Mag,2022-06-28 10:11:00,1887,"What is the preferred method of payment, credit card, US or Candian funds?"
