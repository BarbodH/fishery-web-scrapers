6668580,Spartan1,2022-06-28 08:22:00,46,My group and I will be flying out of Nakina in a couple of weeks and thought it would be a good idea to appeal to the wisdom of the group and see if anyone has fished Kapikotongwa Lake. If you have any suggested waypoints you can share or suggestions on typical hotspots I would greatly appreciate the advice. Thanks and tight lines everyone!
