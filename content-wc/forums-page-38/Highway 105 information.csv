6666062,JAY221,2022-06-20 16:01:00,877,"I thank you for the report. Later, Jay"
6666092,Cgillespie,2022-06-20 18:45:00,120,"Went through today, one lane but it's open."
6666218,bus33,2022-06-21 08:20:00,289,Heard 105 is open both lanes now at buller creek.
6666546,Rammer jammer,2022-06-22 09:39:00,24,Yes highway 105 is open now both lanes.
6667656,the_bronco,2022-06-25 10:51:00,86,"Yes, 105 is confirmed open both ways, just drove it 23 hours ago...just got up from my 14 hour drive!"
6668688,ackvil,2022-06-28 14:58:00,177,Once you take the detour you will have no problem getting to Onaway or any other place along the route.We did this when the bridge was closed.
6668886,NWwalleye,2022-06-29 07:41:00,223,Highway is fully open
6664420,Da' Walleye Assassun,2022-06-14 09:29:00,358,Is highway 105 into Red Lake fully open? Thank you.
6664444,prov1800,2022-06-14 10:20:00,5010,Here's the deal.Water gone on the Buller Creek but signs still say road closed but everyone going throufh it.Can take the detour if you want.Rest of hwy 105 good all the way to red lake
6664472,Da' Walleye Assassun,2022-06-14 11:35:00,358,I appreciate the update.
6664492,ILScott,2022-06-14 12:35:00,139,Actually went on Saturday June 11th on the way back to the states. Water barely on the road and all rest of 105 from Perrault Falls was great.
6664524,prov1800,2022-06-14 14:24:00,5010,Hav√® to revise my statement earlier.Went to town and was turned around at detour and was told bridge is closed as some engineers have looked at it and said it needs repairs so looks like everyone will have to take the detour till it's open again.
6664566,ia bhtr,2022-06-14 16:39:00,212,Any rumors as to time frame ??
6664578,prov1800,2022-06-14 17:18:00,5010,None I've heard of yet.
6664640,Cgillespie,2022-06-14 19:43:00,120,I took the detour coming up to Red Lake this afternoon and it was fine. Didn't want to chance it on 105 with all of the closed signs.
6664664,Pooch,2022-06-14 20:36:00,4618,"Where is the road closed? North or south of Ear Falls? How far either way? Coming from Vermilion Bay, can we get to Lac Seul Lodge, Onaway, Public launch, etc.?Pooch"
6664736,Cgillespie,2022-06-15 05:09:00,120,"Coming from VB, go past 105 to 647 (across from the Shell station), then right on Quibel Road, then another right before you get to the railroad tracks) That takes you back to 105. Detour was in good shape yesterday and we made it to Red Lake with no issues at all."
