But would appreciate any general advice from recent outings. Williams Lake, Grassy Lake, Bray Lake, Vaughn Lake, Islands N/NW of Mahkwa. Any advice/techniques/depths appreciated. Thank you"
6668384,Eckohlt,2022-06-27 14:05:00,3685,"According to most people that fish lac seul just drop your line in anywhere and hold on tight,be ready to do battle."

6668470,Pooch,2022-06-27 20:27:00,4618,"Fishing out of Mahkwa, Windigo, Eagle and La Salle Islands are close and always have fish somewhere on them. They get a lot of summer time pressure, but still produce fairly consistently. I've not been there, but Bray seems to be on some guys radar. If the wind has you staying close, the long point leaving the Mahkwa bay (on your left as you head towards Windigo) has more fish on it than folks realize.Every island with a point, ledge or drops off into deep water seems to have fish on it. Seems every little ""hump""you drive over will hold fish somewhere on it or to the side of it.Have a good trip.Pooch"
6668530,tv4fish,2022-06-28 05:31:00,2694,"As the other guys have said - ""almost anywhere"" will hold fish up there. We have found vertical jigging (minnows/crawlers/leeches) as we drift along points to be very effective. Slide in and out to find at what depth the fish seem to be at. Hopefully you will be using a locator of some type to help find the fish?"
6668680,ackvil,2022-06-28 14:37:00,177,"We were out there a few weeks ago. First, the water level was extremely high and many rocks that previously were seen were underwater. So, be careful in a boat. The fishing was good and we caught many Walleye and SM Bass - but most were above the slot limit so they were released. The Northern fishing was incredible. Most of the Walleyes we caught were caught on crankbaits and plastic Mr. Twisters and similar lures. We used minnows with a jig but found that Northerns snacked on them without getting hooked."
