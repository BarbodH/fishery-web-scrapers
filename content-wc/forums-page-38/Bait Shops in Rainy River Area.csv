I wanted to ask if anyone on the forum has knowledge and / or experience with any bait shops in Rainy River area? We do not and the only one I can locate is called JC Bait & Tackle / Kitchen. Thank you,"
6668306,Riding high,2022-06-27 11:15:00,69,We cross at Rainy twice a year. I see the sign along the road on 6th street but have visited them. Best to call them I would guess. 807 861 1021. Not sure where you are going from there. Bauna vista resort in morson has bait. 807 488 5652. Hope someone else can be more help. Good luck!

Bait sold out of their garage, quality was good for minnows and leeches. Crawlers were just average on 6/23/22. Maybe someone else knows their phone number to check availability."
