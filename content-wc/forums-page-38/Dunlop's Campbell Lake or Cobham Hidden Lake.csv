6668282,Skin-Man,2022-06-27 09:59:00,3,We are looking to book a trip and just cant decide between these two places. We will be 90% targeting pike and 10% walleye. Anyone have any pro's or con's on these two places? Thanks in advance!
6668392,CincyPike,2022-06-27 14:41:00,9,I have fished Campbell and Pelletier lake and both are great for big pike. I have never fished Cobham lake but I'd say Campbell would be hard to beat.
