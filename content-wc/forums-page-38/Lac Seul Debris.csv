6668686,ackvil,2022-06-28 14:53:00,177,We were at Lac Seul the week of June 5th. The water was high and the number of floating logs and debris was incredible. We saw one boat was being towed back in. We later learned that the individual hit a submerged rock and then a floating log. We fished near Ear Falls. Other fishermen who ventured further than we did said the debris was worse.
6665976,Mazaska,2022-06-20 10:09:00,18,"Due to the high water, has anyone notice more debris in the water such as floating logs than usual? We are heading there July 1st at Gold Pines Camp near Ear Falls and curious about new hidden dangers other than rocks"
6665986,guidedfishing,2022-06-20 10:41:00,531,"I can't speak to Lac Seul but yes there was plenty of extra wood floating, if the wind was consistent it would generally pin it in one area. Every time there was a wind shift all the logs migrated to a new location so just keep you eye a little more focused and don't day dream you should be fine."
6665988,Pooch,2022-06-20 10:43:00,4618,"Several years ago water was very high and the lake was full of floating logs that had been on the shore line, but were now being moved around the lake by the wind. I'll be up there same time and I imagine it will be similar. Most of them are hidden just under the water line or by waves. Usually hit them twice, once with the hull then again with the lower unit or prop. Hoping a lot of them are back up on shore someplace by then. Pooch"
6666850,RWall,2022-06-23 07:40:00,1,I just back from Gold Pines this past weekend. There was some floating logs but not bad at all.
6666860,Mazaska,2022-06-23 07:58:00,18,Thanks for the info all. My plan is to have the rental boat lead the way haha
6666922,MikeAnkeny,2022-06-23 09:51:00,67,My plan is to have a damage sharing agreement for the entire group
6667032,bigwalleye1,2022-06-23 14:25:00,2632,"Just got back from Sioux Lookout. We fished the SE quadrant of Lac Seul , and ice seen more floating lumber in the water than I have ever seen before, including the 2014 high water . Storm and heavy waves eventually push logs up onto shore and the high water floats them free, allowing the winds and currents to move them around again. Two sets of eyes looking forward is a great idea, and still was glad a couple times that boats steer from the rear ."
6667074,eyecatcher1,2022-06-23 16:33:00,323,"They say the water is at a 100 year high, so I guess there would be stuff floating around that hasn't seen water in a while. Be careful out there! My trip isn't until August, so maybe the debris will be on shore then."
6667424,lunker99,2022-06-24 16:23:00,236,Just left Gold Pines this morning. Definitely more floating debris with the high water than normal. Seemed to be clearing up as the week went on.
6667432,Eckohlt,2022-06-24 16:50:00,3685,Make sure the guy in the front of the lead boat has a chainsaw ready!!!
