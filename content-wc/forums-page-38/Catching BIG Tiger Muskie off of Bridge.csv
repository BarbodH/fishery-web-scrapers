I as well own a YouTube channel that produces weekly content from many northwestern Ontario lakes! I am so excited to have found out of this forum. Nothing beats being a part of a great fishing community. I look forward to producing reports weekly for fishing in the Kenora District! In this video, I am going to be targeting big Muskies from a local lake. I hope you guys all enjoy!https://youtu.be/ranPGNtLUoo"
