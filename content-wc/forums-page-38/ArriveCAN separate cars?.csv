6667800,Fishin Fun,2022-06-25 19:26:00,218,We had 6 people in 2 cars. We each filled out our app at different time but all put the same time down that we would be crossing. The border agent didn't ask for any vaccine information because he said that all of that information was loaded into their system once we completed the app. All the info is tied to your passport once you loaded that into the app. The process was easy and we had zero problems crossing.
6667826,Ryan Coke,2022-06-25 21:46:00,9,"Ok Fellas.I called Canada Border Services Agency and asked. Figured best to get it right from the source.So right from the horses mouth.....They told me you can list multiple people in a single Arrive Can app, but they prefer this is used if all those listed as in the same related family.If it is, say 4 unrelated fellas heading north in the same car, they prefer 4 separate Arrive Can apps filled out.Tight Lines!!"
6668170,combine_billy,2022-06-26 21:40:00,151,Thank you
6668226,rockape,2022-06-27 06:52:00,215,I crossed on the 17th. I did my own arrivecan. Guard asked for our passports. Didn't ask for arrivecan as it is linked to your passport. She asked a few of the standard questions and that was it. Might have been my easiest border crossing ever.
6667246,elway12,2022-06-24 09:01:00,335,"I know there are many threads on ArriveCAN and some people have even asked this question but I didn't see if anyone had actually answered this question. Do all persons ""listed"" in ArriveCAN have to be traveling in the same vehicle? We just found out that my group will not be able to travel in one/the same vehicle. Thanks"
6667254,combine_billy,2022-06-24 09:08:00,151,"And i have an additional question, is there an advantage/disadvantage to everyone filling out their own arrivecan trip vs having everyone in the same vehicle in one trip?"
6667264,rbbobo,2022-06-24 09:25:00,10,My Group (4) completed the app at the same time. We crossed in two vehicles and had no problems
6667268,elway12,2022-06-24 09:33:00,335,Thank you rbbobo. Just to make sure. One person of your group entered all of the group members information into their ArriveCAN portal and thus all were still able to cross being in separate vehicles?
6667442,x4flatfish,2022-06-24 17:29:00,319,Why complicate it? Do 1 app for each vehicle. You are asking for problems if you catch an agent having a bad day. It isn't that hard.
6667482,elway12,2022-06-24 19:36:00,335,Since you don't have any intelligence to answer my question. I will answer your question. Because the person going up happens to be my dad who is 78 years old and is not that tech savvy. It's most always easier to help a person out like that instead of trying to talk them through it and probably frustrate them. Again thanks for helping answer the question. But I think it will be fine since it's all about being in the ArriveCAN system not about having a login.
6667488,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-24 19:51:00,8293,He did give you a answer and perhaps the best answer. You just choose not to use it.
6667510,hoppy63,2022-06-24 21:01:00,367,"FWIW I was told whoever is listed together on one submission needed to be in same vehicle. Apparently some have gotten through without doing this but I would not take the chance. The info can be filled out at anytime before crossing, you just need to update the date and time of your crossing within 72 hours of crossing and then submit. Not too complicated."
6667574,NARDA 1,2022-06-25 06:34:00,636,"My understanding is that you have to be in the same vehicle. My group had 2 vehicles last year and did separate ArriveCan for each. The border agent entered one persons info into his computer and it brought up everyone's info in that vehicle, so having someone in another vehicle listed would be confusing. If possible, could you have your dad switch vehicles just for the border crossing?"
6667796,elway12,2022-06-25 18:50:00,335,"Thank you for all of the helpful tips. Seems like I will have to set up my dad with the app, login and make sure we enter the trip info within 72 hours. Maybe I will try to call the border agency directly just to hear what they say."
