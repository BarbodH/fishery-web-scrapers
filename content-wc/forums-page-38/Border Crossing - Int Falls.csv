6667582,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-25 06:50:00,8293,"There ya have it, thank you for posting that. Owning a toll bridge is better that Casino's & toll roads. You can skim from both countries."
6667588,Eckohlt,2022-06-25 07:02:00,3685,"Well I guess I can tear that 2000$ check up for that rickety old bridge,or maybe I'll just send the check to you mn guy for being a nice guy."
6667590,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-25 07:19:00,8293,"Save your money, i'm probably not a nice guy."
6668696,ackvil,2022-06-28 15:06:00,177,At least you only have to pay one way!
6667252,RLundin,2022-06-24 09:07:00,22,"Border crossing into Canada (International Falls) was very quick but it was 8pm on a Tuesday. Drove to Sioux Lookout area. Roads were almost flooded but was dropping each day. The docks at the resort were out (high water) so we to put in and take out boat each day. Border crossing into USA on a Tuesday morning went quick as well. The RV right ahead of us was selected for inspection so we were good. Why is the border crossing road/bridge like temporary route that is completely falling apart? Pot holes, temporary lane barriers, road that waves around, etc. Who does the money go to that you pay on the USA side?"
6667270,Eckohlt,2022-06-24 10:04:00,3685,"Next time you pay at the bridge ask them who's putting the money in there pocket,tell the person there's pot holes to fix,once they fix the bridge pot holes,they can start on the rest of the country's sht hole roads."
6667286,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-24 10:20:00,8293,It's a privately owned bridge and the good news is it's rumored to be for sale so put up the money and get it fixed.
6667300,Eckohlt,2022-06-24 10:46:00,3685,"You live there!!!you should buy it and let all WC members a free lifetime pass.Can't cost to much to buy that old bridge,few grand should cover it."
6667304,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-24 10:52:00,8293,If you can afford to get here you can afford a few bucks to get across.
6667308,Eckohlt,2022-06-24 11:03:00,3685,"If you buy it mn guy,hire Walleye cheeks to sit in the booth,I'm sure he will work for minimum wage.You sit back with a big fat cigar at home,he will bring over the cash to you every night.I'll slip him a few crawlers to cross."
6667396,walleyecheek,2022-06-24 15:22:00,2231,If it's a Union job you gotta deal ! I also heard that if you buy the bridge they'll throw in Border Bob's for free ?
6667398,Golden Eagle,2022-06-24 15:25:00,2642,"Tried to paste ""Dunder Mifflin"" logo. didn't happen."
6667400,Eckohlt,2022-06-24 15:46:00,3685,"It's not a union job,your pay is all your pockets will hold each day,I'm not sure who to make the check out to for the bridge?maybe just make it to Minnesota guy,he'll get it to the right place,I prefer if they throw in rainy lake sports,that's where the mother load of crawlers are!!"
6667404,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-24 15:50:00,8293,"Couldn't be a union job. With strikes, breaks, benefits, the crossing fee would be several hundred dollars each way. But the quality of the cash skimming would be excellent!!"
