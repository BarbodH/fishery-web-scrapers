6668496,WalleyeTherapy,2022-06-27 21:56:00,49,Has Canadian government always required a detailed receipt for bait if a MNR officer asks for it? Those rules seem a little over the top. I guess we all better take a picture of our bait receipts on our phones. Good grief.
6668544,Lazy Fisherman,2022-06-28 06:13:00,276,There are 2 bait shops in Nestor Falls.
6667848,Pooch,2022-06-26 05:25:00,4618,"We plan on going west on 11 to 71 north then east on 17 to Vermilion Bay then north on 105 to just south of Ear Falls next weekend. Usually I'm headed home (south) that route, but will be headed north for camp and looking for leeches and crawlers next week. Years ago wife and I stopped at a bait shop and got a hosing on leeches that left a bad taste in my mouth. Don't remember where though. Can you folks offer up some bait shops along that route that you like and trust? I know FF has several when you are headed towards 502, but I don't want to back track. Thanks, Pooch"

Thanks, Pooch[/QUOTE Glad you asked this question. I became familiar with a few because my group also wants to travel 71 on Friday. I usually get bait from Queen St. Laundry in Dryden and their bait has been great. Rainy Lake Sports in Ff West side bai and tackle in FF Bobby's in VB I preordered Jumbo leeches from Bobby's in VB @ $90/lb. Never bought from any of the above. Would like to know if there's a better option available. Thanks for starting this."

6667864,MN_Moose,2022-06-26 06:11:00,964,"Kevin at Nestor Falls bait is my guy. But, leeches aren't cheap. High water has an effect on everything."
6667994,jdfire,2022-06-26 11:50:00,16,"We got crawlers last week in Fort Frances at Rainy Lake Sports. Called ahead to reserve, $83 american for a flat of 500. Healthy worms that lasted all week in camp with ice in a cooler."
6668008,Eckohlt,2022-06-26 12:34:00,3685,Get'em ordered for July 16!
6668010,Eckohlt,2022-06-26 12:38:00,3685,"Not so sure you need to spend money on leeches,they were fighting over crawlers the week of June 13,one guy in our group likes leeches I told him he won't need'em,I was right.they should be going on them more now!!"
6668092,Pooch,2022-06-26 17:12:00,4618,"First week of July. Camp has minnows, though I'm a fake bait guy I like to have some meat available if needed. Crawlers seem to always be good, but leeches are usually a good summertime bait, too. All of us have seen fish preferring one or the other of the three live bait options at any given time. Pooch"
6668118,Springstead,2022-06-26 19:07:00,12,"All, our group is crossing the border at Baudette / Rainy River and we are looking for a bait store that anybody has experience with good or bad. The only one I can find in Rainy River is JC Bait & Tackle / Kitchen. Does anyone have any experience with this outfit? Thanks"
