6664690,drlee,2022-06-14 21:40:00,409,I live just north of Milwaukee in Wisconsin and take two trips to Canada. The first one is in the Pickle Lake area and is 800 miles one way. The second is just north of Ignace and is only about 135 miles less for this trip and back. We pull our own boats. Yeah. Gas prices suck. But I don't know how many years I have left to make the trip and I have spent a lot of $$ on dumber things than vehicle and boat gas going to Ontario. Do the math. Make your own decision.
