6667544,Sutsgold,2022-06-25 05:03:00,219,"Was up on Eagle June 1 and water levels were extremely high, could barely see walleye rock 1 or 2 on the east end. Headed up again July 1. Have water levels changed up or down this last month? Are the dock in vermillion still under water?"
6667862,billy bob,2022-06-26 05:58:00,13,Here is a pic of the dock around June 1st Billy Bob
6668298,Ricky Spanish,2022-06-27 11:06:00,1298,"Just got back from Eagle last night. I was told it's about a foot down from a month ago but still higher than I've ever seen. Never got over toward Vermilion, so not sure about the docks. Fish were not on the main lake humps yet. Best bite was still near or in the weedy bays."
6668320,Eckohlt,2022-06-27 11:30:00,3685,Ricky is the cabbage weeds fully up now??
6668330,Ricky Spanish,2022-06-27 12:23:00,1298,"Couldn't see it from the boat in Little Camp 6 or Lost Bay. Some scattered stands of taller stuff marked down that way and in Temple Bay, but the majority of weeds were only about 1-2' tall out in 6-8' of water. Picked up most of our fish in 5' or less near pencil weeds and wind blown shorelines."
6668362,prov1800,2022-06-27 13:50:00,5010,Dock in VB has water about a foot lower now.
6668364,prov1800,2022-06-27 13:51:00,5010,Have been on Cedar and bite is same there pretty shallow for some areas and out deeper in others.The shallow bite is unreal on crank baits
6668376,Eckohlt,2022-06-27 14:01:00,3685,Thanks!
6668382,prov1800,2022-06-27 14:04:00,5010,Weeds on Cedar are up around 4 ft high in 8 ft-10 ft.
6668390,Eckohlt,2022-06-27 14:39:00,3685,Sounds good
