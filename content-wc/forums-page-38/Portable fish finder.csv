6667866,Mojo-NC,2022-06-26 06:13:00,1929,"Gotcha, yeah no point in trying to convert a non-portable unit to portable when you don't already have one. My suggestion was to save a little money and allow you to convert a good quality unit that you already know how to use. I used a plain old portable sonar for years and they work fine. It's good to know the depth and get a peek at the bottom contour. However, when I switched to a unit where I have the Navionics US & Canada chip for depth contours along with a built in GPS (provided the lake you fish in Canada is already mapped - not all of them are), it was a real a game changer. I think it is worth the extra money to choose a portable unit that has both sonar, and mapping / GPS. You'll be happy you spent the few extra dollars."
6667382,Mojo-NC,2022-06-24 14:35:00,1929,"Do you already have a boat at home? If so, it may be a better idea to convert what you have to portable. My current boat has a pair of 7"" Lowrance HDS units. I purchased an inexpensive case, a spare transducer, a power cord, and a LiFePO4 battery and charger, and made one of my current units portable. I carry the head unit on the plane with me and check the rest. It's just another option to consider. Here are a couple pics of the final product. I cut out some pieces of 1"" foam to surround the battery for protection from vibration and added 4 small rubber feet to the case to keep the unit secure on the camp boat seat while hauling arse on the water with the 15 HP outboards. it works great. I already know how to use it, it's loaded with US and Canada Navionics maps, and has a built-in GPS to add new waypoints. P.S. Also notice the repurposed pool noodles for hanging baits and protecting your expensive rods from vibration damage."
6667408,Eckohlt,2022-06-24 15:53:00,3685,looks like a scheels store in a boat.
6667416,Mojo-NC,2022-06-24 16:03:00,1929,"Yeah, I think Sheels should use me to help advertise their products (for a modest fee). More importantly, the improvised fishfinder works great and every one of those baits hanging on the pool noodles caught one or more fish. We like to troll on our way the next fishing location and we like to change up our baits every time."
6667426,Eckohlt,2022-06-24 16:25:00,3685,"I started as a 7 year old trolling orange n hammered gold spoons on lac des millac in Ont with my father,still have a bunch of them.Looks like your all dialed in with the boat set up."
6667484,WalleyeTherapy,2022-06-24 19:41:00,49,I converted a Helix 5 portable bag to hold a Lowrance Elite ti 7Â” from previous boat. Lithium 12amp battery for all day use. Sidescan transducer mounted to camp boats with X power magnetic transducer mount (Holds at 10-12mph no problem)
6667516,hoppy63,2022-06-24 21:07:00,367,Yes fly in. Most generally a way to charge
6667518,hoppy63,2022-06-24 21:10:00,367,"No sir, no boat and not hip on all the conversion stuff. Willing to YouTube to learn but looking for simple like my brain. Only used up north and like I said mainly used for depth/navigation purposes. GPS and fish marking availability a bonus"
6667520,hoppy63,2022-06-24 21:12:00,367,I appreciate all the feedback
6667564,Mr. Sauger,2022-06-25 06:06:00,285,Like the Pool noodle idea. The rattling rods in the boat drives me nuts.
6667614,Eagle1,2022-06-25 08:25:00,28,"I used the pool noodle idea this year for the first time, which works wonderful. The rest of the gang has that on their list for next year. I bought the Humminbird PiranhaMAX 4 a couple of years ago for maybe $180? There is a generator at our outpost, so I usually charge it for an hour or so each evening after 12 hours of usage. Works wonderful for depth and surface temp, but I wish that I would've spent a few more bucks and bought one that would allow me to set waypoints on some spots."
6666938,hoppy63,2022-06-23 11:07:00,367,"Curious of your thoughts on best portables for Canadian shield lakes. I had a Hummingbird Wide 128, but transducer come loose (as well as where I had it tied off) and it as well as half the case is gone. It was sufficient for my needs, which is learning the bottom/depths more so than locating fish. Only issue I had which seemed to come and go was being able to use it while running. Sometimes I could be almost wide open and it would work, other times it would not work at 5 MPH no matter how many times I tried to adjust transducer location on boat. I'm open for all suggestions as I have no experience except with that one and it was given to me probably 20 or so years ago. I use my hand held GPS so that is not a must either. Just looking for simple and effective.Thanks for any input"
6666946,Stehle1,2022-06-23 11:18:00,22,I have a Helix 5 SI GPS that I take up. The transducer is on a bracket from Cabelas I think that I attach to the back. It does well at high speed but the transducer creates a rooster tail that soaks me so I take it off for speeds above 7mph. I have either a lithium battery that I run it off of or I use clips to the starting battery. Works well but may leave it home next year and use the camps smaller units without GPS and SI
6666960,Eckohlt,2022-06-23 11:44:00,3685,"Helix 5 with suction cup,lights up like a Xmas tree when you go over fish."
6666962,valley366,2022-06-23 11:54:00,193,I took my Helix 7 ice unit with the transom transducer this year and last and love it. Also had a Helix 5 SI on the boat this year and that worked great.I also have the Lowrance 5 chirp portable unit and love it.There are several other smaller units on the market that are good. If you just need depth the above units are over kill.
6666974,adempsey2.0,2022-06-23 12:18:00,611,"I would probably go for a Helix 5 CHIRP G2 GPS/Sonar (or G3 model), a Dakota (or similar) 10/12 AmpHour lithium battery and a magnetic mount like the Fishfinder X-Power mounts.If I did not care about GPS and/or only wanted depth and bottom structure/hardness, I would go cheap with a Humminbird PiranhaMAX 4 (or equivalent, like Lowrance Hook2 or Garmin Striker 4). Also, nothing wrong with a budget friendly C-clamp and a piece of 1X2 for the transducer mount as well (although, an old piece of hockey stick is actually better)."
6667260,Net_Man,2022-06-24 09:15:00,580,Portable - Availability to power may be a driving factor. Are we talking for a fly-in lake? If yes then do they have a generator at the cabin?
6667274,gordy28,2022-06-24 10:10:00,437,This is the set up we use but just leveraging the suction cup. Generally we just use the fish finder but one a big lake the GPS w way points and basic map is nice as wellThe Dakota batteries are great. CheersAndrew
6667280,SterlingArcher,2022-06-24 10:11:00,92,"Garmin Striker cv. I got the 5"" model for less than $200 thanks to a sale and Rakuten cash back. For about $90 more you get the portable kit that includes a nice suction cup mount. It has live mapping capability which is amazing, and unlike Humminbird or Lowrance, it's all built into the unit - no zero lines card or subscription needed."
6667312,Old Timer,2022-06-24 11:09:00,255,I have a Vexilar Boundary Waters. Very compact and runs on eight AA batteries. Has a suction-mount transducer that stays put when used with smaller portage and outpost motors. No GPS. Vexilar hadn't made this model for a number of years. But I see them for $50-100 all the time on the Internet. They are popular among canoeists and fishermen who need a compact unit they can carry in a backpack or tote. The thing is accurate and easy to use.
6667328,Esoxmike,2022-06-24 12:05:00,114,"Just a tad of info,I gutted a fishing buddy hummingbird portable fish finder and converted it to a portable,basically a color pirahna.i ran it hard for 6 days on 8-aa energizer lithium batteries,unbelievable!!!!!!no gps,not the best for marking fish but when the bite is on I'm usually seeing bottom dwellers arcing out on the bottom.i just hang the battery pack which isn't waterproof in a small nylon drawstring bag,the water don't hurt nothing unless you let the terminals corrode."
