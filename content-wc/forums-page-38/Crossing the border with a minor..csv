I thought that was the point of getting a minor a passport where both parents signed it for the youth. Any help is appreciated, thanks."

6668490,valley366,2022-06-27 21:22:00,193,I have not had a motorized letter but have had a letter each time I have crossed. I think the last 3 or possibly 4 times I have been asked on the Canada side. My brother in law was asked several years ago on the USA side.

6668534,Hook_settr,2022-06-28 05:53:00,127,"My brother in law had a notarized letter for my nephew when we crossed at Baudette at the beginning of June. The border officer never questioned any of us about my nephew and never asked for the letter. However, I’m a believer in being prepared so I would still have one if it were me."
6668752,kettyspanky,2022-06-28 16:59:00,271,Thanks for the responses. I'll get a letter ready.
6668800,Slim03,2022-06-28 19:59:00,159,I have crossed several times with my son starting at age 9. I never had a letter and he always had a passport. In 2019 he and I got questioned heavily inside the crossing at International Falls while entering. Everything was fine after about 15 minutes of questions and they suggested that from here on out I have a letter from his mom. So this year I’m making sure I have a letter for both my son and daughter to prevent issues.
