Border agent was very friendly and didn't even ask about covid, just the normal stuff throughout the years.....firearms, alcohol, etc. We did not have to wear a mask either for those that were wondering."

6667840,winger,2022-06-26 04:20:00,8,We crossed last Saturday morning about 8am at Baudette to avoid the wait on the way in. Only 2 cars ahead of us. Came back Friday night around 5pm through Fort Frances and only waited 5 minutes.
6667870,Mojo-NC,2022-06-26 06:29:00,1929,"We crossed at Baudette last September due to horror stories we had been hearing about the difficulties crossing at International Falls. Our experience crossing at Baudette was the same as yours, easy peasy. We had all of our paperwork in order and none of us were wearing masks (although we did have them with us). The border agent was very nice and polite and we went right through with no problems. However, we had already flown from NC to Minneapolis earlier that day, and then drove from Minneapolis to Baudette. That was kind of a PITA. It was late when we arrived and the duty free shop was already closed, so without thinking, we crossed the border with no beer. That was a huge mistake considering Canada prices on alcohol! Duh! And we still had to drive up to Kenora where we were staying the night. That turned out to be a very long day. I don't think I'd do it like that again just to avoid the hassle at the border. I'm guessing it probably added a couple of hours to our day of travel."

6667882,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-26 07:01:00,8293,Based on what? The seating area at the airport was full and the boats have been going through International Falls as usual all week. Who are you talking to that says traffic is slower?
