6668168,elway12,2022-06-26 21:36:00,335,Thanks Kettyspanky. We will be coming out of camp on the 15th. Safe travels and tight lines!
6667638,kettyspanky,2022-06-25 10:03:00,271,Can a adult cross the Canadian border without a passport? My buddy sent his out special order to get it back in time and nothing yet. It's been a month and we have 3 weeks yet but kinda wondering if or what he would need to cross if it doesn't get back in time.
6667640,cuamb,2022-06-25 10:14:00,203,"In the past we have had guys forget their passport and no problems. That was pre-covid. I am not sure how they would handle it now. In the arriveCan app you need to enter a travel document number. This is typically a passport but can be a birth certificate, enhanced drivers license, or other documentation that you can look up on the apps FAQ page. Probably best if you call customs. Sorry I was not much help."
6667648,walleyecheek,2022-06-25 10:35:00,2231,Canada is not going to refuse anyone for not having a passport ! They need our business !
6667890,lassh,2022-06-26 07:31:00,553,"If your state has the ""enhanced drivers license (EDL)"", then you are good to go. The link attached says the EDL is available in only 5 states; however I know that Illinois has them now as I paid extra for one last year. I don't know about Wisconsin. Note that this is for getting back into the US from Canada. I have entered and left Canada twice with the Illinois EDL.https://www.dhs.gov/"
6667904,Lmbkiller,2022-06-26 08:17:00,639,It's simply amazing this is even a thread. I'm not gonna even say it anymore as it's been said so many times it's obvious no one listens anyways
6667910,pjshorthorn,2022-06-26 08:21:00,5654,Here's hoping the rest of your day goes better for you so you aren't too stressed out. PjShorthorn
6667950,kettyspanky,2022-06-26 09:20:00,271,My buddy tracked his passport down. It should be back this week. We will be good to go. Another friend of mine sent his out at the same time and his is stuck at a mail hub somewhere and no idea when he will see it. He doesn't need it until the end of august. Should be good to go by then also. Thanks for the responses.
6668046,elway12,2022-06-26 14:29:00,335,"For what it's worth. One person in my group is still waiting (8+ weeks) for their passport to come in even after doing the expedited service! I would feel better if they get their passport before we go on 7/6. However, I am somewhat comforted knowing that in ArriveCAN it allows for the Enhanced Drivers License instead of a passport. Thus, why would they accept that and still require just/only a passport to enter."
6668090,kettyspanky,2022-06-26 16:44:00,271,Good luck elway. Hopefully your buddy gets it by then. We are leaving the 16th of july. It must be luck of the draw if people expedite it and receive it back in a timely manner.
6668120,Eckohlt,2022-06-26 19:09:00,3685,See you at the border Ketty on July 16.
