One of our group going to Lake of Woods out of Morson has a Garmin UHD 73 sv chart plotter unit preinstalled with U.S. Lakevu mapping. I spent over a half hour wandering around the Garmin and Navionics websites trying to confirm that he will have a functional navigation tool for canadian side of Lake of Woods and could not find what I was looking for. Can anyone help me with this? Are there detailed depth maps, safe travel routes etc. that will work on Lake of Woods? Thank you for your help. If not, what are the options for this functionality on the Garmin with US Lakevu preinstalled mapping?"
6667822,Riding high,2022-06-25 21:30:00,69,I have a 93sv uhd in my boat. I couldn't find anything last year that would give me a definite answer. So I purchased the chip for Canada. It has routes marked. I kept my lowrance hds 9 along side of it. I like the lowrance mapping better but garmin was fine. We fish LOW out of milesbay. So we put in at Morson. Should have tried it with the original mapping before I downloaded the chip so I could have let everyone know but didn't think of it. So I guess I'm not much help.
