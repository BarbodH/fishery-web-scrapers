4936681,Slushfish,2016-06-19 04:33:00,263,"I didn't know there was any other way to fillet??? Like jiggster said, easier to leave attached at tail for skinning. And, make your cut down both sides of spine before filleting."
4937929,kona77,2016-06-19 18:06:00,236,"This is the only way we have been cleaning walleye's for over 25 years..We started the ""Zipper"" cut 7-8 years ago.. Best way to maximize the walleye meat and remove the unwanted bloodline section from fish here in the US side of the border.."
4938145,Lmbkiller,2016-06-19 22:12:00,639,"Minimizing waste? What about the cheeks on all of them? Those take 3 seconds a piece to get out. Screw the gulls, those are mine"
4940537,Bass Lake,2016-06-20 21:50:00,20,Thats how I have always done it. It just seems to work better for me...
4934209,fishnwo,2016-06-17 11:34:00,16,"Many of you might already do it this way, but for some it might be a little different. We like to take the ribs out as we go so all that's left at the end is the lateral bone. Enjoy! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd4kNuai9E"
4934481,jb_wi,2016-06-17 14:14:00,212,"An old boy from Canada showed me that about 10 years ago. It makes eating them much more enjoyable!As a side note, this also works for the top (back) cut of a northern. When you get the back piece removed from northern and skinned, the bones will zip right out like they did on the walleye in that video."
4934681,rnnonmt,2016-06-17 15:07:00,992,That is the only way I have ever known to fillet fish. Other than an electric knife pushed all the way to the spine and then down the backbone to the tail which is much faster but a lot more bones.
4934689,jb_wi,2016-06-17 15:10:00,212,I have always cut over the rib bones like the guy in this video also. It's just the zipping out of the lateral line at the end of the video (where he gets the final row of small bones out) that was shown to me in Canada years ago.
4935225,packpro,2016-06-17 21:35:00,695,My boat partner was schooled in a family fish business. This is how he fillets them. Very clean. Minimum 10% more meat on his fillets than the rest of us. His fillets are thicker. I'm getting better with this method. Just need more practice than once a year.
4935489,jimirjr,2016-06-18 07:35:00,1149,"Hmmm.. Might just ""try"" this technique next Fall... Looks like You need a REAL sharp knife...."
4935585,jiggster,2016-06-18 08:25:00,183,"I have been taught the same method except not to cut off the tail, I use the tail to hold while I fillet."
4935601,rnnonmt,2016-06-18 08:41:00,992,Not that it is any big secret but for those of us that have to freeze our fish to get them home or freeze them until they are going to be eaten if you leave all of the skin on they are less prone to freezer burn/damage.
4935713,octanehi5,2016-06-18 09:48:00,1104,"The laws have changed in Canada,as to transporting fish and how its done.That is the best way to avoid bones"
4935793,zeebee,2016-06-18 12:28:00,1144,"Yup. Been doing it that way for 40 years. I cut thru from the top to the ribs with the fish on its side. With the fish on its side and your hand on top of the fillet. you can learn to apply a bit of pressure with your palm to ""encourage "" the flesh to separate from the skeleton..otherwise, the same procedure."
