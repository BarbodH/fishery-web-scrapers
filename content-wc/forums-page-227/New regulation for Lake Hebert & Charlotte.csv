4919993,MikeG1,2016-06-12 13:38:00,434,What's the new part?
4920225,fosterthedog,2016-06-12 14:52:00,51,"From what they had on FB the other day the top end of the slot is 21"" instead of 20"", but it also says the entire length of the fish? We always have measured from the fork in the tail, kind of confusing? At least that's the way I took it."
4920233,Andre (wallyandre),2016-06-12 14:52:00,2274,It was 35-50cm vs today 37-53cm. and the fillets they must be transported whole or in fillets with the skin wholly intact which means that the fillets have to stay attached by the tail. All explain in the link that I post
4920289,fosterthedog,2016-06-12 15:11:00,51,"Andre I read the link and it says nothing about how to measure the fish, my bad. I was at work when I read the FB post and it was a translation from the Quebec site."

4922249,retire55,2016-06-13 08:07:00,1029,More importantly than length is the requirement to leave the pectoral fins attached to the filleted walleye.
4934529,octanehi5,2016-06-17 14:24:00,1104,"Total length is from nose to longest point of tail,It basicly the same as the old way of 20"" to the fork of tail"
