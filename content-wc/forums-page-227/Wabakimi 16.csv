4930529,Pikeslayer8,2016-06-15 16:06:00,1460,This trip was worthy of a separate thread. http://www.canadafishingguide.net/fo...mi-6516-61116/

4932169,Pikeslayer8,2016-06-16 12:05:00,1460,"Thanks Keith, we do eat well, but it is only 113$/man for 6 days. I'd sure like to see someone eat off a 113$ budget at disneyland for 6 days. No sir, this thing we do..... ya just can't beat it with a stick."
4932177,Carnhzkr,2016-06-16 12:06:00,964,That's a great trip report. Beautiful pictures. Looks like you've got a wonderful group of fun guys. I can't imagine a better way to spend a week. Thanks for sharing.
4932513,HeHooksHimself,2016-06-16 14:26:00,725,"Pi keslayer, Great report and what great memories you are building. thanks for sharing your memories and I sure wonder how you can stay relatively fit with that culinary spread! Hopefully someday we can get that trip together that you and Wallydave and I were talking about a couple years ago. This fall we are flying into Luella Lake with mattice. Only 85 days from now! I hope it is at least as awesome as your trip was! Fish On! Hooks"

Tick tick tick............ Hooks, those last 85 days will go fast as you start (continue) your preparations. Me, I will go nuts again waiting for next year. Have an awesome trip to Luella"
