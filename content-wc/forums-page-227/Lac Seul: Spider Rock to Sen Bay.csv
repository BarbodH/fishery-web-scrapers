I am looking for information from folks that have made the run and would like to share their experience and what the hazard/rock situation is. Based on the Navioncs map it looks like a fairly straight forward trip, but I know there is a lot that doesn't show up on the map. Also, there is not a navigational line from Spider to Sen on the Navionics map. Thanks for any info you can provide."

I have the Navionics chip also, in addition I have the paper map produced by Red Lake Digital Media for the SE section of Lac Seul, and it doesn't list any nav hazards in that stretch, but."
