It was emotional, but perfectly honorable and fitting for a great friend. He always cared more about everyone's Canada experience than his own. He now resides at the river dock, in front of a peaceful bay overlooking the lake trout spot, and on the exact spot where he caught his largest pike on his last day last year. It was quite the healing experience for our group. Now for the report. Fishing was great as usual. We made the very difficult portage twice. Caught 120+ fish each time. Once with 3 fisherman and once with 2 fisherman. Caught a 39"", 12 lb. Northern on the same lake. Side hooked, sure made that an interesting fight. Camp was full this week, but we never had to compete for fishing spots. Found fish biting on the river, and the short portage. Caught all of take home fish, and all of our shore lunch fish there. Caught more, bigger, small mouth while walleye fishing than on any other trip. Seems like they were on every rock/ledge near the shore line. Nice change of pace to have that fight when your expecting walleye. Upon arrival, June 4, they had cooler weather for some time. Our Lake Trout guys love that. They were still near the camp and high in the water column. Everyone caught their limit in a few hours of trolling spoons and deep diving stick baits. The cool weather also had the big female Walleye near the spawning ground. We did not target them, but others in camp were. Probably saw 8-10 in the 27""-30"" range. The owner has been cultivating that lake for some time as a catch and release. The results are better every year. Next year,depending on weather, we are going to give it a try. No accidental musky this year, put more slot pike than on past trips. Great camp hand removed Y-bones like a ginzu surgeon. Couple of guys targeted perch for a take home fish fry and came away with 60 in a half day of fishing. My boat had 40 for the week and we were not targeting them. Shore lunch was awesome, lodge food was incredible. So much productive water-so little time. 351 days until next years trip."
