Never really fished the river, but looking for something different from Lac Seul for maybe an August trip. Thanks for any info."

We had a cabin reserved at Kahouter's Cabins and a deposit payed, but the owner basically told us we got bumped because someone was willing to pay more. Anyway they have bent over backwards for us to be able to stay at Little Canada camp, so I'm doing some checking on the area."
565626,Guest,2007-05-27 21:52:00,0,Good fishing nice resort
565630,Larry S,2007-05-28 07:45:00,665,"Good Place,owners are willing to go the distance for their customers. Stayed there 3 or 4 yrs ago fishing is good to excellent. You can always catch fish by the Ear Falls dam lots of water to fish Larry S"

There are always plenty of fish at the dam and there are many good spots down river. The more water flow created by the dam the better the fishing. Jig size may vary from 1/4 oz to 1 oz depending on water flow at the dam. Its a great place, enjoy yourself and say Hi to Kevin. Good Luck, Nike Kansas"

It was nice for my father because he doesn't like the long rides on Lac seul. Caught about 40 eyes over 20"" for the week and one 28. Kevin worked hard to make sure we had a good time and he is a pretty decent guy. Had the most luck on 1 oz pill shaped jigs in the fast current. Bought them from the shop in town. They should have finished a fish sanctuary and construction on the dam which will give you more area to fish below the dam than I had last year."

4378713,yoopertrout,2015-12-14 19:08:00,1172,It seems kind of crummy that the other outfitter sold your spot after you booked and paid a deposit. Is that a common thing?
4379769,bigwalleye1,2015-12-15 09:05:00,2632,"Don't know if it's common or not, but I'd point out the thread has been dead for 8 years and somebody's revived it to inquire for a fishing report..."
