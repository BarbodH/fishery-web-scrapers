Rumor had it that Lac Suel was down 3 foot and very little water was coming through the dam at Ear Falls. Rumor was true. No gates open on the dam and only a little flow through one powerhouse. It didn't seem to matter much. The fish were relating to structure in 12-20 fow and were on the feed. We were drifting with the current/wind using 1/4-3/8 oz jigs with 4"" ringworms in various colors. Purple/chartreuse, Smoke Glitter/Chartreuse, and Electric Blue/White were top producers. I had purchased a number of the new Flicker minnows to try out and boy did they work nice. They have a nice wiggle/wobble and run 16-18 feet deep. The eyes were just crushing them. Best colors were Blue/silver, black/silver, and black/gold. We had a number of bigger northerns, 38, 38 1/2, and 39 1/2. Biggest walleye was 27 3/4"". We just hammered the walleyes between 22-25"". Can't wait to go back in the fall."
