My caravan departs on 6/24 before dawn, and we should have our first limit of the trip by 3pm. Fishing out of Cat Track once again, looking forward to the hospitality of the Sawyer clan and the unparalleled fishing of Savant. I'm bringing the GoPro for the first time on this trip, so hopefully I can capture some good video to go with the pics."
