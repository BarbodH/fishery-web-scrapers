4932193,Carnhzkr,2016-06-16 12:11:00,964,I saw your post looking for a report on Onaway. That's what prompted my post. I'll be at the tiller end of a red Lund Pro Guide. Stop by and say hi if you see me.
4932233,muskyroller,2016-06-16 12:24:00,56,"I'll be in an Onaway camp boat...I'll be running the tiller as well. Most likely, standing and chucking musky baits for big jacks. If you see me standing and chucking...stop by and say hi, too. Good luck!"
