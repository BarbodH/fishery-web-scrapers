4873065,wallydave,2016-05-26 10:53:00,2151,"Thank you to Todd and Carrie at Cedar Island Lodge a group of 4 will be trying a new lake next spring! I entered the drawing on the website, and won a trip! I have always wanted to fish the season opener, now I get my chance! I tried the search function, only one report came up, any reports or info would be great! Thanks in advance"
4874049,skirkpat,2016-05-26 18:09:00,12,Cedar Island Lodge is on my list to visit. I have not met the owners but think very highly of them and have heard great things. Brochures for the camp look beautiful. Have fun.
4874209,wallydave,2016-05-26 19:25:00,2151,"They have been great to reply to emails, this time of year that says something! I will post a report on our return."
4874281,Carnhzkr,2016-05-26 19:57:00,964,"Some guys have all the luck. I enter every free trip contest I can find and I never win anything. Where's my trip? I'm a nice guy - well, sometimes I'm nice. That is, I have been nice on more than one occasion. Stupid karma. I've checked out their website before and had entered the drawing. CIL does look like a great lodge. I'm sure you'll have a wonderful trip. I'm pretty sure the owners of CIL also own Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul, and CIL is run by their son. I'll be watching for your report, Dave, congratulations. I am replete with envy."
4874441,wallydave,2016-05-26 20:43:00,2151,"For whatever reason I have been lucky when it comes to winning trip's. Trips to Banff, Rome, Black Bear Lodge and now Cedar Island. Your time will come! If I get an opening for this trip I'll let you know."
4874617,pjshorthorn,2016-05-27 04:12:00,5654,What about Miniss. .......didn't you win a trip to Miniss last year too? PjShorthorn.
4874649,wallydave,2016-05-27 04:54:00,2151,Didn't want to rub it in
4874665,pjshorthorn,2016-05-27 05:12:00,5654,You are a very humble and LUCKY dude PjShorthorn.
4874857,ftfarms,2016-05-27 06:10:00,444,Congrats wallyDave thats awsome. I've seen a couple shows on fishing on that lake system and the walleye and smallmouth fishing looks really good. Have fun and enjoy your trip.
4926753,wallydave,2016-06-14 12:06:00,2151,"Well, I was hoping to use the free trip to fish a walleye season opener, but those plans have fallen through. Looking to make a mid-August trip happen. Time will tell!"
