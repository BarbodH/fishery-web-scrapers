The Cabonga Res is a huge fishery and they are always bighting somewhere, many times right in front of the camp. Being in the La VÃ©rendrye Park this res is very pristene and no rag tag outpost camps are allowed. Ten minutes boating from Deer Horn and you will be in one of the most unspoiled parts of Quebec. There are Indians around the Cabonga that get stirred up once in a while but this camp is safe and easy to get to with only a few miles of gravel. The southern end of Cabonga has had Indian problems and equipment going missing is always something to be concerned with."
3967306,dar100,2015-06-15 08:54:00,7,"drive to, then boat to outpost cabins I have been to deerhorn twice and other quebec camps this one is best, about 6-7 hours from Montreal message me for details"
4941025,eatsleepfish,2016-06-21 07:51:00,52,"I have been going to Deerhorn Lodge on and off for the past 30 years and there is nothing better. 29 KM on the rock road is much better than the 100+ miles of dirt road to Clova. DHL has wifi and internet, electricity, and great fishing. Last time up there I caught an 11 pound walleye about 5 miles from the camp!"
4941841,pike50plus,2016-06-21 12:53:00,584,Where would you be driving from?
3940929,strength22,2015-06-06 09:31:00,49,"Hey all. I am looking for great walleye fishing in Quebec or Far East Ontario. Live in Massachusetts now so can't make,the drive to gullrock where I use to go. I have tried to contact chalets du huard in Quebec as i have they are very good but no email or phone replies? I am fishing solo so makes it harder. Not looking to drop a lot of money either and chalet was very reasonable. Do not have a boat. Do my own cooking as well. Just looking for a nice place with great walleye fishing and can't drive 1000 miles to do it now. Thanks in advance to all and best of luck on all your fishing trips this summer. Nothing is better."
3940977,sbe2,2015-06-06 10:20:00,63,The Gouin Reservoir is where I go. A 14 hr drive from Buffalo. There are plenty of outfitters that are all inclusive and you could drive or fly in. Whichever one you would prefer.
3940993,octanehi5,2015-06-06 10:32:00,1104,"The Gouin is a good choice, There are alot of outfitters along the road to Parent or Clova, that you can choose from,Look up the Quebec outfitters association, You may have a tough time going solo. Good luck"
3941729,strength22,2015-06-06 17:48:00,49,Thanks. Yeah being a single guy just wanting to fish is tough. I was in contact with chalet du huard last year and they said it was no problem for me to come alone and the prices were great. Now I can't get in touch with them. Will look at other options and thanks guys.
3941865,fishron,2015-06-06 18:54:00,317,"You could check out pavilion Bark Lake and Deer horn lodge, both on Cabonga Reservoir and at far ends apart. About a twelve hour drive. My group has had some very good walleye fishing on the Cabonga. The only southeastern walleye lake I'm familiar with is Wolfe Lake, near Westport. other than Wolfe we have fished Lady Evelyn but that's quite a drive. We fish Wolfe at the end of September and it is a true native shoal spawning walleye lake. It as a great walleye population but the water is gin clear and it takes a good strong wind for several days in the same direction to really turn it on. We stay at George Mc collough's cottages and I'm not sure if he can accommodate a single person. He does rent boats and motors."
3942601,retire55,2015-06-07 06:32:00,1029,"I've spent 17 weeks fishing the area of Lake Kipawa where Chalets du Huard resides. There are better accommodation options in that area (e.g. Taggart Bay Lodge, Two Moon Lodge, 3 Seasons Camp)."
3944225,strength22,2015-06-07 17:09:00,49,Retire55. Can you send me a private message with more information about that area and camps please. Would love to hear more.
3944489,retire55,2015-06-07 18:34:00,1029,PM sent.
3945385,southernEyes,2015-06-08 05:43:00,232,Check out Club Trout Lake near Belleterre. There is great fishing on Trout Lake as well as the portage lakes. I've been a few times and had great trips each time. Noel is a great host who really takes care of the fishery. I think it took us about 9 hours from Buffalo.
3946417,doubleheader,2015-06-08 11:24:00,2652,One of my favorites would be Ellen island Lodge on Lady Lake Evelyn. Great fishing and hospitality. Lots of big fish.http://www.ellenislandcamp.com/fishingphotos.html
