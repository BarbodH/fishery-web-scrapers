4895465,adempsey,2016-06-03 08:38:00,963,"Thanks for this recipe. Cooked this up on my trip last week and, WOW, it was amazing! This is the recipe I followed:Chunked up the Walleye and 1) Light dusting of flour, 2) Egg dip, 3) Panko bread crumbs and then deep fry.Sauce: Bottle of Franks Original Red Hot Sauce (680mL) and 1 stick (1/2 cup) of butter. Melt butter in sauce pan, add sauce, heat but don't boil. Do not overheat or the sauce may separate. Coat fish in hot sauce like you would chicken wings.Linguine: Melt a few Tablespoons of butter in a sauce pan. Add a heaping teaspoon of flour and stir vigorously until cooked (a couple of minutes), the color should darken a bit. You can skip this step (making the roux), but it might take a bit longer to thicken. Add a pint of heavy cream (or half/half) and stir. Add a hunk of Blue Cheese (8 oz./225g) and some Gorgonzola if you want. Stir until melted and simmer until it's thickened. Stir regularly. Cook the Linguine (1lb/500g) according to package, drain WELL. Add sauce to Linguine, mix and let set 5 minutes or so. If the sauce seems watery, just let it sit with the linguine for a bit and it will all work out."

Avoid letting the fish sit too long in the sauce because they will start to ""pickle"" the meat pretty quickly. I think it was the acid in the vinegar. I was doing a large fish fry for the family and had some fillets soaking in hot sauce while I fried up a bunch for the mild crowd and kids. It definitely changed the texture after about 30 min. In the past, a quick roll in hot sauce and into the breading before frying. Makes for great fish tacos, too."

For those of you who like your spices Louisiana makes a nice seasoned beer batter,as well as their cajun crispy fish fry breading just add to your beer batter. Enjoy"
4936857,jimirjr,2016-06-19 06:47:00,1149,"I tried something new last week... EQUAL parts SHORE LUNCH; PANKO; and FRESH SHREDDED PARMESAN CHEESE. Season the fillets to taste. Dip fillets in egg, than into 50-50 flour and cornstarch. Coat well with PANKO-CHEESE mixture. Shallow fry quickly in peanut oil-butter combo... My Wife went crazy over this new recipe.... I'll bet You could top this with BUFFALO SAUCE and it would be GREAT!"
4813370,michigan walleye guy,2016-05-07 17:23:00,95,"I've heard a lot of good comments about the buffalo walleye, and want to ask if somebody could tell me how they prepare it. That is, do you guys deep fry or broil the walleye first, etc. I know this topic has been discussed earlier, but would appreciate a quick review here. Thanks in advance!!"

4815970,Pikeslayer8,2016-05-08 16:37:00,1460,"I thought my Walleye Central pager went off.... Lol Buffalo Sauce for a party of 8: Melt 1 stick of butter over medium heat, add in 1 full bottle of regular Franks Hot Sauce, stirring constant. Be careful not to overcook as the sauce can break. We serve it onside as a dipping sauce or when we make the Blue Cheese Linguine dish Have a great trip"
4816114,123chadder,2016-05-08 18:06:00,429,"we did a sweet hot breaded walleye last year and it turned out great... 1/2 cup unsalted butter 1/2 cup franks hot sauce 1/4 cup honeypanko makes a big difference vs regular bread crumbs in this recipe,doesnt get real soggytry it out serve with carrot and celery sticks and blue cheese dressing!not too shabby!"
4816130,Pikeslayer8,2016-05-08 18:12:00,1460,"Sounds great chadder. And you are right, panko is a game-changer."
4816210,123chadder,2016-05-08 18:30:00,429,"i agree, also we do a honey/parmesan panko fish on a bun....its very good as well 2 tbsp honey 1/2 cup seasoned flour 3 tbsp parm cheese 1 cup panko with 1 tbsp parsley 2 eggs homemade tarter fresh lemon fresh as can be lightly toasted chiabata buns lettuce mozzarella optional add honey to eggs,dredge fish in flour,dip in honey egg mixture,bread with panko/parm bread crumbs,toast buttered buns,slather with tarter,add lettuce and a generous squeeze lemon its actually excellent"

4819042,NCESI,2016-05-09 15:20:00,249,We just use Hooters wing sause it worksd well. Bake or broil the fish then add a tablespoon of the sause and spread ove the fish. Works for us and way easy. Sprinkle on a bit of blue chease.
