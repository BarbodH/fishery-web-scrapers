4933033,DonC,2016-06-16 17:38:00,93,"I came back yesterday from Crow Rock Lodge. We had 14 in our group. My brother and I caught 165 fish up until dinner on the last day. After dinner I went with a fellow group member and his two boys and we caught another 40 fish. Mostly smallmouth were caught on the trip. Decent number of pike also caught. Several of the group took advantage of the walk-in lakes and caught plenty of fish. One fellow in the group fly fished quite a bit and did very well. My brother caught the his largest walleye shallow on a spinner bait which was 26.5 inches. He caught a 38 inch pike on the deep baby Norman and a 40 inch pike on a spinnerbait. Many members of our group caught large Pike, walleye and smallmouth bass as well as excellent numbers of fish. The last day I had a bite off from a pike. Two minutes later I caught a pike. When I was removing the tube bait another tube bait popped out with 3 inches of my fluorocarbon leader which was my original tube. Fish barbless. As best I can remember the first half day of fishing when we arrived we caught 55 fish. That was not a full day of fishing. The next day (first full day of the trip) we caught around 72. The third day it rained a lot and we caught probably about 50 fish. Fourth day we caught 82. As mentioned above the last day we caught 165 fish with another 40 after dinner. One of our party went and caught some big lake trout. About 80-90% of our fish were smallmouth bass. The largest smallmouth in the group was 19.75 inches. Largest I caught was 3 smallmouth 18 inches. Many walleye were caught shallow fishing for smallmouth bass. Water temperatures where in the high 60's when we arrived, but decreased to 58-59F, to slowly go back up to 64-65F Food at the lodge was very good. We had steak one night and prime rib another night. The boats were one-year-old Crestliner's wth 50 hp Yamaha four stroke's and sonar/GPS units. They were new last year. Still in great condition. We had a fishing contest for the largest of each species. Five of the party had trophy size fish and were given a certificate and a trophy fishing hat. To qualify you had to catch a smallmouth 19 inches or a pike 38 inches or a walleye 27 inches. All in all it was a fabulous 4.5 days of fishing. The lodge was great and the owners were also very excellent hosts. Don"
