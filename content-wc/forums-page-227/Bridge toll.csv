4943097,bigwalleye1,2016-06-22 06:32:00,2632,"Same as it's been for years, $6 for the car, $4 for the trailer."
4943177,v-bay gord,2016-06-22 07:02:00,3168,Reports from my guests crossing this past Saturday experienced a 2 hour wait and felt the bottleneck was at the toll booth.....once past that point there was no line up. The toll booth is one of my pet peeves.
4943297,Stringbean,2016-06-22 07:37:00,279,"You have to remember that the concrete bridge belongs to the paper company. The ""official"" bridge is the railroad trestle."
4943801,packpro,2016-06-22 10:12:00,695,Still $10. We were the only car in line and had to wait for someone to show up at 3:30 AM.
