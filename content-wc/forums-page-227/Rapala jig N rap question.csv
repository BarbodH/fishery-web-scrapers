I get a few lost fish when a pike hits it, but not too many. We are not going away from this type of fishing, just trying something new. My question is: When we try the jig n rap should we still tie directly on? should I use a snap swivel? Should I use a steel leader? Should I go to braid with a floro leader? Any thoughts would be great."
4929049,fishnutbob,2016-06-15 08:12:00,633,I would use a braid then a barrel swivel then a two to three feet of fluor 10 lb then the rap directly.

4930369,ftfarms,2016-06-15 15:08:00,444,I don't use braided line jigging anymore but with a jigging rap I would go with 12-20lb braid with a 30-50lb florocarbon leader. Can't see where a 10lb leader would be better than just using 12lb the whole way. It's all floro. What's the braid going to help the pikes bitting it down by the jig.

I have not had any bite offs from pike that I can recall, but I don't use them all that often. I have had some success catching nice perch on LOTW with jigging raps."
