4931665,BrewCrewFan,2016-06-16 09:11:00,4,Headed to Northern Lights Resort on the west side of Cedar Lake the first week in August. Would anyone be kind enough to offer some advice/suggestion where to target (general proximity) muskies and walleyes? What lures will muskies be chasing? Thanks in advance!!
4932113,MOfish,2016-06-16 11:46:00,39,We'll be there from Aug 6th -13th. Have you stayed at Northern Lights before? Our group hasn't but is looking forward to it. Wish I could help but I'm a newbie as well.
4932137,BrewCrewFan,2016-06-16 11:53:00,4,We'll be at camp the dates. The trip can't come soon enough!!

4939753,walleye/musky,2016-06-20 14:23:00,47,hey there i don't fish walleyes on cedar but i do go on my days off for muskies and both sides produce good fish the west side is harder to fish then the east side just cause the water is clear. but id say dark coloured baits on the west side and brighter colours on the east side always seem to work for me
4940041,MOfish,2016-06-20 16:55:00,39,Sounds like there's 3 Walleye Central guys at Northern Lights the same week. It ought to be fun swapping info.
