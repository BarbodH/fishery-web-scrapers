546923,Trailerguy,2005-04-10 18:27:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]How do you get an insurance rider on your borrowed trailer? Commonly when the trailer is hooked to your vehicle it becomes part of your vehicle, thus no added insurance required. I've tryed getting a policy for a trailer not attached to my vehicle and the agent laughs. Unless I want to buy commercial insurance at around 4 grand. My homeowners in Ontario wants no part of it either. I use a hitch lock and a 3/8"" chain and padalock through the wheel and axle. ;-)"

The church is not insured but is covered by a self insurance policy with the diocese (which means that the monies go in a big pool and claims go out of that same diocese money pool). Thus if I wrecked that trailer I would be liable and either I or the diocese would have to pay. Wrecking the trailer doesn't bother me as much as having it break away and crash into someone and get a modacious lawsuit. To rest easy, I contacted my local agent and they wrote a policy for the trailer for 6 months, which I immediately cancelled after I came back and returned the trailer to the church. The total cost was about $30 which was split amongst all the guys in the trip. It was well worth having our gear in the trailer, leaving a 2nd vehicle at home and resting easy with not having to worry about any potential liability concerns."
