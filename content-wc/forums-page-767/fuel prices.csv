546983,Guest,2005-04-12 15:36:00,0,"Been going to Canada since 1955. Gas was about 20 cents a gallon if I remember correctly. Snickers candy bars 5 cents, New car $1500, nice house $12,000, Mitchell 300 reel $12, Johnson 10HP motor $350, Fishing Cabin for a week for 6 of us $100 (Included boat), weeks grocerys for 6 of us $70. Guess everthing has gone up. Oh yeah, I worked for $3.50 per hour....cleared about $100 a week. Today it is all more expensive and I pay twice as much Income Tax now than I used to make. But Im going fishing every chance I get until the Walleye King in the sky calls me home. Life is too short to worry about a couple bucks worth of gas when there are Walleye to be caught."

546778,Guest,2005-04-04 15:51:00,0,"archie, i'm with you. my drive is 1000 miles one way. gas is really chicken feed compared to the overall cost of the trip."
546779,Guest,2005-04-04 18:45:00,0,"I am sorry Archie, but some of us like to take our own rigs up to Canada and the exta money spent on gas gets split 2 ways. By the way, gas has gone up again in Spooner, WI. $2.35 per gal. now. Yes, I agree that the more expensive gas prices aren't going to change my plans to go on my fishing trips to Canada. But I did have to tell the wife that I won't be able to put gas in the lawn mower this year. I think she is planning on buying a goat or two."

546852,Guest,2005-04-06 17:50:00,0,"I think it will effect the fishermen that are on the fence about going. For me, the gas prices won't stop me from going. ####, if gas hit $5 a gallon I would still go. It may start hurting the lodge owners though. Between gas prices, border hassles and restrictions I can see people starting to stay closer to home."
546859,Guest,2005-04-06 22:14:00,0,regular unleaded is 89 cents per liter in Winnipeg.
546899,rebelrn2001,2005-04-08 20:08:00,1563,"All I was saying was that, if I'm lucky and don't burn a lot more gas than I intend, I won't have to buy more gas, at the more expensive Canadian prices, than I plan on."
546916,Guest,2005-04-10 09:36:00,0,"Super unleaded in the Des Moines area is $2.11, was at $2.15 and just dropped. What a yo-yo!"

546741,Guest,2005-04-01 20:44:00,0,Hi. I know this was asked last year but this year the prices are really out of sight. here in chicago regular is 2.25 and premium is 2.49. I guess I will bite the bullet and take our own boat up anyway. I did not buy it so leave it home. It seems like once we get away from chicago and the gougers- that includes the state and local tax collectors too the price gets more reasonable anyway. just have to work a couple more hours of ot.
546747,Guest,2005-04-02 07:49:00,0,Gas is at $2.29 per gal. in Spooner Wi.
546752,Snowball,2005-04-02 12:13:00,28,"Are you ready for this one! $3.03(U.S. dollars)/1 U.S. gallon in Thunder Bay,Ontario,Canada I converted the metric liter (the way our gas is measured at the pump) on my calculator and the Can. currency to U.S. via a conversion program on the net. This will help you compare the price in the U.S. to that in Canada. At the pumps we are paying 97.2(cents Can.)/1 liter as of April 1/2005 P.S. This is NOT an April Fool's Joke I was told this morning that the price of gas at Grand Portage,Minn.(just over the Canada/United States border-approx. 45 miles from Thunder Bay) is going for: $2.10(U.S. dollars)/1 U.S. gallon Regards, Snowball"
546755,rebelrn2001,2005-04-02 17:35:00,1563,"If everything goes as usual (please--no ""buy in Canada"" responses, this is strictly a 'cost' post) I will fill up my truck in International Falls and have recently filled my boat in MN too (MN is less than WI due to taxes). With my 30 gallon tank in my vehicle and my 32 gallon tank in my boat, I hope to go all week without having to 'buy' gas."
546757,oltim,2005-04-02 20:01:00,10,Anybody know what diesel is going for around Wawa or White River or that general area?:banging:
546759,Guest,2005-04-03 01:48:00,0,"Hey Rebel, What does your post have to do with cost since you mentioned it??"
546760,Snowball,2005-04-03 08:43:00,28,"Ceck out this site:http://www.ontariogasprices.com/index.aspx?fuel=D You can check out both regular gas and diesel prices simply change the chart setting near the top left from reg. gas to diesel, then enter the name of the town/city. Diesel on Sat. (April 2,2005) in Wawa was 90.6 at Esso Pinewood Drive. No price for White River. Regards, Snowball"

546763,2746,2005-04-03 17:28:00,3206,"Just read an analyst's report from Goldman Sachs, a brokerage company that tracks commodity prices. They are suggesting we are in for another 1970's type energy cost hike (remember when everone was selling their SUV's) except this time gas will reach $3-4.00 before is subsides. They are basing that on increasing demand from our economy along with the strong growth in China. Don't know if they are right but, if they are, it will be quite a ride."
546768,Guest,2005-04-04 09:07:00,0,We drive round trip 2500 miles to fish in Canada. At 15 miles per gallon we will use 166 gallons of gas. The difference between 1.50 per gal and 2.25 per gallon is $124.50 divided by the six of us in our Suburban is 20.75 per man. We will spill that much Whiskey in camp that week and probably lose that much per man in Rapalas. Gas is going to have to get a lot more expensive before we dont go.
