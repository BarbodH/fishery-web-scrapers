546793,Guest,2005-04-05 15:17:00,0,I am planning to fish in Ontario and need to travel to Red Lake. I live in the Philadelphia area (go Eagles!) Any suggestions as to travel - driving would be a long one - any info on flights and costs?
546797,Guest,2005-04-05 16:37:00,0,"You will probably end up on Bearskin airlines into Red Lake. Check the search engines for best prices, times and routes."
546801,Guest,2005-04-05 18:11:00,0,A friend of mine is flying from Chicago to Red Lake and we will pick him up at the airport as we will be fishing at Lac Seul. His cost will be about $435.00 one way.
546810,Guest,2005-04-05 20:22:00,0,Check out Red Lake Travel Services 1 800 465 3305 Newark-Red Lake- Newark is $765 round trip. Good luck. They do a great job

They've done this for years, I've never ask them why they don't don't fly into Red Lake. Maybe can't from Chicago. I haul a lot of their gear up by van. Then we go to a fly in camp."
546824,Guest,2005-04-06 07:57:00,0,"Hey, I've done it all three ways. Driving to Red Lake from Chicago is just too big of hassle compared with the other options. Flying to Red Lake is easy and convient and get's me home a day sooner. Expect to pay between 500-900 for a RT from most US markets. Vegas to Red Lake was ~680. Chicago to Red Lake was ~600. Those same cities are about $150 less to Winnipeg. The last 5 years I have flown into Winnipeg and hooked up with our guys from Philly / Chicago / Baltimore. We have a nice dinner then hit the Casio for a couple of hours before a 4:30 wake up call and a quick 4 hrs drive to Red Lake. We are usually able to fly in and fish by noon. We like spending some time in Winnipeg as it gives us a chance to do some other fun stuff. To each his own, in terms of fishing FAST with the highest cost BearSkin/Red Lake is a good option. If you want to have a little slower trip with more to do Winnipeg is nice. Bob-"
546884,WillieB,2005-04-08 07:24:00,292,"I live a bit north of you (Quakertown/Perkasie) and have done Red Lake and Kenora area. We fly out of LVI rather than Philly (no 1 1/2 security lines) and do LVI to Winnipeg thru Chicago. Cost right now is between $360 and $420 round trip, it could be a bit cheaper out of Philly. Then we grab a rental car and do the 5 1/2 hour drive to Red Lake, splitting the costs between the members of your party gets to around $40 each. The great thing is you can get into Winnipeg at 10:45a.m. and with the gods smiling still make it to Red Lake and get dropped off at your fly-in lake same day. Your first travel day you get to spend the evening at your lake (you can save some time and have your outfitter do your shopping for you). Bearskin airlines can fly you to Red Lake, but it's a bit pricey (approx $235 each roundtrip) and it isn't a flight leaving every hour on the hour schedule...you might have trouble co-ordinating your Winnipeg arrival with a suitable Red Lake via Bearskin departure."
546890,Guest,2005-04-08 10:21:00,0,Willieb where are you fishing? give me an email address if you dont mind
546895,WillieB,2005-04-08 16:08:00,292,"To e-mail me click on the message icon to the right on my message header. Red Lake is a great area, you've some excellent choices. This years trip will be in Manitoba, though, finalizing everything now. (jumper flight dead North from Winnipeg)."
