I have a few extra days to fish after a week of pike fishing. Never really had any luck with the eyes in the moon river area, looking for some decent walleye fishing for a few days on the return trip home (States). any info would be greatly appreciated (lakes, lodging, etc.) Thanks in advance Eye Troller"
