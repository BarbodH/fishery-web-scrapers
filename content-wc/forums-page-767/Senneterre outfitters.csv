546910,JBfishdog,2005-04-09 18:17:00,9,"I was there in June 2001. The owner is a bit ""different"". When we went, we were the first group in and the owner wanted us to put boats in. I went to fish not hook boats up to my truck and drop them in the water down a very scarey hill. The cabin was at the top of a steep ""goat trail"" that was a hazard in the dark. Cabins were very hot, one small window that never seemed to catch a breeze. Fishing was decent, good sized pike and enough walleye to keep you busy and fed. The owner was doing work on the place the whole time we were there, The Advertised Hot Shower got put in on day 4. Also were had no lights just the two lantrens that we had luckly brought with us Boat was a dog with the 9.9hp on it. took along time to get anywhere. The camphand was useless,couldn't fix anything, didn't share fishing spots . The place has probably improved since I was there, I might go back in the future if I can get the desire to walk that hill every day, If you are in poor shape don't do it, the guys in the cabin next to ours could only do it once a day, and that was with stopping a couple of times on the way. Hope this helps you out --JBS"
