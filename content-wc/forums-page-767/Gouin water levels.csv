I know they experienced low water levels 2 years ago because of lack of snow/rain in the beginning of the year and wanted to see how this year is looking. I tried searching the internet for a site by hydro quebec that would show it, but came up empty. Thanks for replies."

Two years ago, when we had a very low level it was down to 399.98 meters, almost 21 feet Condition should be normal for opening day and improve for the month of june. Hope to see you up here, you know we had 42 inches of ice this winter"
