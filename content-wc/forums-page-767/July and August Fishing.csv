This year an ailing father prevented us from planning the trip.... and he passed on at the end of January(a highlight of his last trip to Ontario last year was catching a 18 inch walleye and a 37 inch Northern with one hook...Northern hit the walleye, sending the jig through the nose so it was on the line like a slip bobber, and the Northern then on the hook..it was a hoot). Anyway, the trip will be different, but the tradition must live on... and we are now scrambling. My assumptions- Winds can be more regular and stonger in the summer. Bugs are worse, but the fisihing still strong. We have our own 18 ft boat that can handle bigger water, but don't want to bounce around all week. We have experienced small lake fly ins, Lac Seul, LOTW, and the Indian Lake chain near Vermillion Bay. My questions- 1. what are some reccomended drive ins - the less re remote the better and smaller than Lac Seul? 2. What is Lac Seul like in July and August? 3. What can you share about mid summer fishing in NW Ontario? Thank you."
546775,Guest,2005-04-04 15:23:00,0,Lac Seul is great in July or August. I fish it every year during those months and the wheather is better than june and the Walleye fishing is great. Biggest problem might be getting a place to stay. The Resorts book up fast with old customers.

Actually the fish are schooled and it seems to me a bit easier to find. The last week in July/first week in August is one of my favorite times to go. I'm sure LS is good then also....both would offer some easy drive to lodges."
546777,Guest,2005-04-04 15:45:00,0,"Agree that July and August is usually good, predictable fishing. Walleye are on the mid-lake humps and muskies have moved to the rocks and reefs. Skeeters aren't too bad but those black stable flies can get bad on hot days out on the water. Most good resorts are probably booked for July by now but mid-late August is slower due to back to school, etc. Another great time to be in NWO is late Sept and Oct. Outstanding fishing and great crisp fall weather."

Any week is great. Been going for 27yr. I found that some years the second and third week of June the walleyes could be a few weeks off a late spawn and fishing could become challenging. We all have our favorite weeks. I have never found bugs and flies a big problem that far North."
546783,Guest,2005-04-04 22:28:00,0,"I would take July and August fishing over June any year. At that time the walleyes move onto the reefs of Lake of the Woods and I think it's better than June, especially when the walleyes are feeding on crayfish - they bite hard. Try buenavistaresort.com you can drive in."
