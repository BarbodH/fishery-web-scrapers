It was really nice to have a few good movies to watch while drinkin in the late hours of the night or with dinner. It brought us a few hours of entertainment before bed each night."

545951,Rich B,2005-02-25 17:29:00,1081,"1) unload boats......figure out who's turn it is to clean the ""eaters"" for our fish fry 2) crack open a cold one or two, while buttoning up the rigs, etc 3) get the snacks/prep going for the fish fry.....make up a salad (?) and side dishes ready for dinner 4) have a camp fire and enjoy a good cigar and maybe tell a ""few"" stories 5) remind each other how blessed we are to be up in God's country with good friends, good fishing, good eats and making good memories 5) hit the sheets so we can be out before sunup to do it all over Faith, Family, Friends......and Fishing Rich B"
545952,Guest,2005-02-25 18:47:00,0,"Clean fish if we decided to keep any. Tip a ""few"" beers. Eat food that will give us all ammunition for later that night. Play poker and try to gas each other out of the cabin. Do something mean to the first guy that falls asleep/passes out. Take pictures documenting the dirty deed. Go to bed. Repeat. This has been the pattern for fifteen years."
545991,nitroman,2005-02-28 21:16:00,368,open a blue clean the fish more blue eat the fish more blue wait for someone to leave their blue for moment so i can get him with the visine in the beer trick(make sure it's not my next day fishing partner cause he's gonna be poopin') bs about all the trophy(14 inchers)walleye we boated more blue try hard not to be the first asleep cause we are all pranksters pass out wake up and do it again
545992,Guest,2005-03-01 04:45:00,0,"1. Chill with cold one. 2. Clean fish. 3. Dinner. 4. Cleanup (both yourself and the cabin) 5. Burn wood and drink some more. 6. Harass those that go to bed before dark (dark hits about 10:00 in June). 7. Some guys tie more spinner rigs ... others hit the crack pipe! 8. Those that hit the crack pipe are usually double bunking. A scene out of Oz. 9. Wake up the next morning and do it all over again. We fish from 7:30 - 6:00 or so. We're done with steps 1-4 by 8:00 or so, and that's when BOB(the old fart in the group) goes to bed. If he only saw the photos of the crap we do to him. His wife would even think he's ""happy""."
546000,Guest,2005-03-01 06:55:00,0,>6. Harass those that go to bed before dark (dark hits about >10:00 in June). #1 all time pet peave when in large fishing party. Always a couple jackazzes who won't let the guys doing all the work catch some z's. Pathetic.
546006,Guest,2005-03-01 10:23:00,0,"Naw...Oh BOB doesn't do any work. He's just an Old fart. Heck, I get up first and start the coffee and also cook breakfast and dinner. I figure I can catch some z's when it's not as exciting like at work. Besides, I have FOMS, which is the Fear of Missing Something."
546010,Guest,2005-03-01 15:10:00,0,"1. clean out the boat and gas it up if needed. 2. put gear and bait away and have a cold blue. 3. take a couple cold ones with to clean fish. 4. start the fire and have a beer or two relaxing in a lawn chair. 5. cook the fish on the fire. the women make the rest. 6. clean up dinner mess and take a shower or go for a swim. 7. relax, play cards or games with the kids. 8. get the kids to bed and have a high ball or two 9. we may stay up to midnight the first night but usually we are out by 11. we get going early and are gone all day weather permitting. 10.up around 6 to make coffee. If the kids don't get up, usually about the 3rd day, I'll go fish for walleye breakfast. Darn it, I have 152 days to wait!"
545905,Guest,2005-02-23 15:34:00,0,"Curious to see what the rest of you guy's do after a long day of fishing on your Canada trips. Play poker, tell lies, go to strip joints etc. We rent a houseboat for 7 days and play poker every night. What does your crew do?"
545909,Fred_G,2005-02-23 18:16:00,908,Get a good nights sleep so we can do it all over again the next day.
545918,Guest,2005-02-24 06:40:00,0,"We camp nearby, so we have to get all our gear back to camp, clean the fish, fry them up, and then we usually play poker or sit around the campfire, most of the time its entertaining to watch a few of our Jokers hit the whiskey a little hard and watch them attempt to light the fire with a styrofoam cup full of gas....the gas usually eats the cup before it gets to the logs. Anyway, we don't start fishing until 10:00, mainly as a result of a 2:00 am bedtime...but, we fish a good 10 hours everyday, we just go out later than the norm."
545919,FIB,2005-02-24 08:09:00,23,"Also rent a houseboat, after some evening fishing. Come in, eat a second, non walleye dinner. Do some drinking, light a fire (yes the sryrofoam cup trick seems to be universal). Then we sit around and start lying about the number of fish caught that day. Northern lights is an added bonus if they show up. Also sleep in a little, back out a 9 am with a Kahlua and coffee to clear things up. Basically eating and drinking too much. Later!"
545920,Guest,2005-02-24 08:25:00,0,Just wondering about the alcohol rules for a houseboat?
545923,Guest,2005-02-24 09:52:00,0,">Just wondering about the alcohol rules for a houseboat? I believe the HOUSEboat is considered your ""residence"", albiet temporary......it has sleeping quarters, and a head, so it is legal to drink while ONBOARD. Same would go for a pleasure boat with a cuddy and crapper. One caviat...I believe you must be anchored or stowed for the day/night when you are drinking. Legally you can't be roaming around and downing beers. I don't know if this is for the driver or passagers, but I assume it's everyone. I am no expert on the subject, maybe someone could corroberate or refute?"
