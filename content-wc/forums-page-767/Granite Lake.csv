Not the best week, but any insights or tips for this lake or lakes like it would be most appreciated. Can you troll up walleyes or should I stick with bait. Any info on the water clarity, habitat, forage base, or other features would be most helpful, since it's a fly in I assume the weight will be limited. Thanks in advance for any help."
