Canada's 'Sad' Beer Calamity Thursday, April 07, 2005 A beer truck flipped over on a roadway overpass in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Monday, prompting local officials to comment on the tragedy. ""It is sad,"" Capt. Scott Logan of the Halifax Regional Fire Service (search) told The Daily News of Halifax. ""Chances are they won't recover any of the beer."" The truck, hauling 46,368 bottles of Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale (search), skidded to a stop against the overpass's guardrail, luckily avoiding a 50-foot plunge down to another road. The female driver was pulled out of the cab uninjured  ""more frazzled than hurt,"" according to Logan  letting rescuers focus on the calamitous aspects of the disaster. ""I had a tear in my eye, actually, when I was watching it,"" said police Constable Mark Hobeck. ""It was full of beer. We were hoping a Hostess truck full of pretzels would come by, but no such luck."""
