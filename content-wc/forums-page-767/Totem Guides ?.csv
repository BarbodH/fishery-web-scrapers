546290,Guest,2005-03-15 05:17:00,0,Freddy Borg that's the one I've met! I do believe he has brother John in Kenora that works at the mill. Do the guides from all the lodges get along? If I were to use a lodge it would be Totem!

546165,guide22,2005-03-09 09:43:00,7,"Hey Lookin forward to a great summer at Totem. I lurk here once in awhile and enjoy the threads here. What I dont like is all the bashing of the lodge.People like to take shots at you when your the best I guess.Anyways I will be there in a couple weeks to help out with winter construction. I have had a great winter snowshoe guideing and ski instructing ,but I'm just itching to get back on the water. Guide22 Shaun"
546223,Guest,2005-03-11 14:27:00,0,"not too full of yourself, are you ?"
546256,Guest,2005-03-13 15:04:00,0,"Is Totem expecting a good year? I heard last year that there were many cancellations because of the decline on the American $. I know I've cancelled all my Canada trips because of the gas prices,not!!! anyways it would be great to meet up w/ guys or at least quick chat on radio. I've met a couple guides at The Last Resort, but most of the time your just roaring by with a quick wave(if that). Any body know ? Borg at White Birch? I forgot his first name! Dennis"
546270,rtmg,2005-03-14 09:14:00,34,"Didn't personally hear about any cancellations last year. Totem was really busy so if there were any, other groups jumped in to replace the lost ones. No idea if Totem is busy this year but given the rep of Totem & the agressive nature of the lodge, I suspect that they will again be busy. The guide you mention is John Borgo & he is now a Totem guide. Good Fishen Rob"
546271,guide22,2005-03-14 10:16:00,7,No your wrong!! Borgo's brother guides at White Birch as well.Theres a few borgos in town.And no Im not full of myself just proud to be a Totem Guide and I stand behind the lodge 100 %. Guide22
546276,rtmg,2005-03-14 11:58:00,34,I stand corrected. I didn't know about any other Borgo's running around guiding..... Learn something everyday ! Good Fishing Rob
546282,Guest,2005-03-14 14:02:00,0,you sound like a fool.
545835,rtmg,2005-02-20 01:18:00,34,"Just curious...... how many of us Totem guides cruise here ? First names only will do ! Please, no SLAGGING of us or the Lodge is necessary, we are tired of defending our reputations ! Good Fishen Rob"
545841,Guest,2005-02-20 16:37:00,0,Robert!!! How goes it???? What's new in your neck of the World? Are you going to be at Totem this year? Cheers!! RW
