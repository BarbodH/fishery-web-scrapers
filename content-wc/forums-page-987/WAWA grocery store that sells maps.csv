515696,lenray,2001-12-12 13:15:00,467,I am going to a new lake north of Pickle Lake Ontario next spring and I am in need of a map of the area. I usually buy my maps at a grocery store at WAWA the store is up town and on the right as you go into town. If anyone knows the name and or number for this store I would very much appreciate it.Thankyou len in michigan

515698,lenray,2001-12-12 16:36:00,467,Thanks for the help-Youngs is where the former MOOSE was standing on the porch--are they open in the winter??? The store I am looking for is on the same side of the street as Youngs but maybe 3/4 mile up into the town on the right.

Ever since the other Esso station closed, they are only Esso in Wawa now so they might get convinced to stay open by locals. Although the owners deserve a break.They are the most favoured bait and tackle and map location in area.I am not sure if maybe one of the smaller general stores would have the same selection I doubt it.here is link to town www.wawa.cc"
