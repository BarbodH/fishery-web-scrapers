516457,Guest,2002-01-17 17:22:00,0,I bought a bottomline Buddy 2255 last year. Used in in Canada for Walleyes and Pike- worked great ran all week on 2 c cell batteries.

516460,Fred_G,2002-01-20 10:13:00,908,"I would recommend picking up an X-85 and then build your own box for it. I've done this in the past and it works great. My box was 13""x9""x7"". I fit a gel cell battery in the corner for power and used a Tite-Lok clamp on transducer holder. Attach the bracket to the lid of the box and drill a hole in the back of the box for the power cables to come through. Also, line the bottom of the box with 1"" thick foam so you can lay the unit inside fully protected for transport. Put a handle of some sort on one end of the box for ease in carrying. Total cost of about $400 gives you a great sonar unit with an almost indestructible carrying case that will last for years. I've used this set up locally and in Canada with great success.Fred"
516461,Pooch,2002-01-20 10:30:00,4619,The Eagle portables do a good job right out of the box. I've used them for years with out any problems. My favorite is a Zercom flasher mounted on an older style (2-6V battery) Eagle portable battery box. Just keep in mind battery consumption if your using any depth finder for fly-in trips. The Zercom will run a couple of weeks of solid all day fishing on two six volt batteries. The Eagle will probably need new batteries before the end of the first week. These are the only two brands I am really familiar with. Good luck.Pooch in central Illinois
516462,Guest,2002-01-20 20:27:00,0,"I have used a Hummingbird portable for years with good success. It will run all week on two fresh 6v. duracells. Have used it on fly-ins and it has taken lots of abuse and never failed me. I think it costs about $125.In reference to an above post about building a box, I used a 6-pack cooler one time for a box. I mounted the locator against the side near the top so I could open the top of the cooler and swivel the head up out of the box. I ran the transducer cable through a small hole in the side that I sealed up with silicone and mounted 2 6 v batteries to the bottom of the box with with some nylon webbing held in place with some sheet metal screws with washers. About size #12, 3/4 inch long. I used a portable transducer mount I bought somewhere that had a clamp and it swiveled up and down. It was easy to carry and was waterproof. This worked pretty well for several years until I bought the Hummingbird. An advantage of your own box is that you can mount a better locator than the typical portables if this is your goal."
516463,Guest,2002-01-21 06:49:00,0,"I bought a Humminbird Portable Wide 100 2 yrs. ago on sale for about $90. The until has worked great from day one. It uses two 6V batteries and they last for about 1 week of 6+ hr/day fishing. The case holds everthing (batteries, transducer and dispaly unit) - easy to carry and set-up on the boat. The transducer is fixed to the boad with a large suction cup - I troll at arount 5 mph no problem."
516459,Darren B,2002-01-21 08:55:00,13,"I second the fishing buddy, except mine is a FB2 from quite a few years ago. It's nice and convenient and runs on simple batts as mentioned. The only drawback is that you have to remember to take the unit out of the water/bracket when traveling at higher speeds/long distances by boat. If not you may end up losing the thing or else banging it along the side of the boat. Also remember to remove the clamp/bracket before docking the boat."
