516442,Guest,2002-01-17 09:37:00,0,Has anyone been there in the last two years - and how has the fishing been?
516443,Guest,2002-01-18 07:51:00,0,"We Have been to O'Sullivan for the last 4 -5 years. When we first went there we were new to walleye fishing and had to learn the techniques, but the catching has gotten better each year for all of us. The owner is great and very helpful with anything you may need from fishing tips to repairing trailers, motors, etc., etc. The cabins are quite nice and the lake and views are beautiful. The week we go in June is when the diehard walleye fisherman all seem to be there. We typically know half the camp members (5 of 10 cabins)these days which makes each trip all the more enjoyable to see everyone again. It is a great group of folks up there each year, we all usually book the same cabin so we know immediately where to find them upon arrival each year, and they too have been immensley (sp?) helpful in teaching us in the way of the walleye. It seems these ""regulars"" that i speak of catch their limit (although do not necessarily keep them)on every outing. There are also some lunker pike and lake trout in the lake that i can attest to. All in all, it is a great place that we look forward to going to each year!"
516444,retire55,2002-01-18 17:47:00,1029,"Hi Pa Angler:Sounds like your group has been ejoying your stays at O'Sullivan. I would appreciate if you could provide a few answers for our group.Do you drive in to camp or fly in? What are the roads like?Do you trailer in your own equipment or use the outfitters?What kind of equipment does the outfitter have?What size of walleye would you consider the average caught?Are there places to fish the lake when the wind is up?I apologize for all the questions. However, our group has considered going to O'Sullivan Lodge and I'd like to take advantage of asking questions to someone who has actually fished there. Thanks. Jay"

516447,Guest,2002-01-20 15:16:00,0,Is this O'Sullivan Lake Lodge the one in Ontario or the one in Québec ?
516449,retire55,2002-01-21 07:55:00,1029,I'm interested in the O'Sullivan Lodge in Quebec. Jay
516446,Guest,2002-01-21 09:20:00,0,"Jay, We drive in although certainly you can fly as well. We take our own boats. The road is usually pretty good. It's approximately 65 miles on dirt and then 12 miles on the lodge ""driveway"". They grade the main road pretty often so unless there has been recent downpours it is ok. The ""driveway"" is one lane, winding, bumpy, but also a beautiful ride, at least on the way in when your excitement level is at maximum. The offroad trip has taken us from as little as 1 hour 45 minutes to almost 4 hrs. Some people it takes even longer, but we typically are pushing it pretty hard. The lodge has 12 - 14 foot aluminum boats with 10 horse Johnson's. They are quite adequate, and most people use them. I think the motors are new each year as they lease them. I believe the owner (new in the last 4 years) has increased the size limit each of his first few years to the current 17 inch, and most fish seem to be 17 - 19 inches. Although larger fish are always caught (by others) when we have been there. There are numerous protected locations to fish regardless of wind direction and speed. Hope this helps!"
516448,Guest,2002-01-21 09:21:00,0,"I'm speaking of Quebec, off the Clova Road."
516450,Papi,2002-01-21 14:16:00,13,"I live in Québec and was at this outfitting spot many times since 1982.The Clova road can be quite a ride, tons of mogols or it can be decent. Never in a trip did I get very nice.The cabins are in good shape, new owner (4 to 5 years ago) very pleasant. Total fish than can be in your possession, set by owner, is lower than provincial regulations and pressing on catch and release. Plus he setups sizes to be released.Boats, I've got to disagree with Pa Angler, they are 14 & 16 feet aluminium boats.Outpost camp is excellent for major pike. Main lake, that I know quite good, is primarely good for walleye and Lakers.Depending on time of year fishing can be exceptionnal.The vues are extraordinary ! Need more infos...just ask."
516451,retire55,2002-01-21 15:03:00,1029,"To both PA Angler and Papi:Thanks to you both for sharing information about O'Sullivan's.Our group has targeted speckled trout and lake trout for the last 25 years. Much of our trout fishing takes place in ""la belle province de Quebec"". Normally, we fish west of Maniwaki, Quebec.We decided to give walleye fishing a try and we fished Lake Ogascananein Sep 2000. We had difficulty fishing there because there was no place to escape the winds. Consequently, we moved to Lake Kipawa for a 2001 walleye trip. Kipawa is a very big lake (over 50 miles long) but it has so many islands, that there is always a spot to fish out of the wind and waves. We had reasonable success at Kipawa and we have already made our reservation for Kipawa again for 2002. Kipawa is probably 100 miles west of O'Sullivan Lake.Thanks again for sharing information.
