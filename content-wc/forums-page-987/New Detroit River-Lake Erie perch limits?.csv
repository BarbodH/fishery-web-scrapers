516484,Homer,2002-01-20 17:38:00,1127,"Just got my new Ontario fishing license and the booklet has a list of regulations submitted to go into effect in 2002, but not yet approved. One of these is a change in the possession limit for perch in the Detroit River and Western Basin of Lake Erie. The booklet says that anglers will be notified once the regulations go into effect.Does anyone know when these regulations are due to be approved, and/or how anglers will be notified once they are? Thanks."
