Fish limits, possession limits, etc? The cabin is just outside Fort Francis and we will be there the last two weeks in July. Any good areas nearby?"

516360,David/MN,2002-01-16 20:50:00,249,"Fishinnut,Yea there are a few things you will want to think about! I am lucky enough to own a cabin on the C side of Rainy, and have relatives that have had an island on the US side since the 1940's. I bought my place just over a year ago and have doing my homework to be a good neighbor. First question, are you planning to fish on the C side, US side or both? Any Walleye you catch on the US side count into your possession limit on the C side. That limit by the way is one daily and a total possession limit of either 2 or 4 based on the type of license your purchase. Both sides have a pretty restrictive slot limit on Walleye. There is also slot limits for Northern Pike. If you keep fish measure carefully! Charts! Charts!, Charts! Do you self a favor a buy a good set of charts for Rainy. You will be glad you did. Stick to the main routes, as there are dangers just under the surface! It may look like a wide-open lake in areas but it might not be. GPS is another good thing, 1500 islands look a lot alike. If you're crossing the border via water I recommend that you have a Canadian Border Crossing Permit. Be truthful at the Border when you arrive, and you will be treated fairly. I have been through the Border crossing some thirty times in the last year, and it pretty sad to see how many people get caught trying to save a couple of bucks on tax or duty. If there is an attitude at the crossing, I got to believe this is a factor. There is a great Safeway store in town to buy your food at, and any bait or tackle you need is easily bought close to where you're staying. Dough and Deli on Scott Street makes fresh bake goods, and has a great deli.If you get sick of cooking, there are some really good restaurants in town. Respect the speed limits, especially on hwy 11 east of town. 60 kph means 60 kph!!Please spend some money with the local businesses!!!! I have gotten to know a lot of Fort Frances's locals and businesses. These are truly great people, and it goes a long way to be a good neighbor.If you drink, don't even think about driving a car or a boat! Canadian's take this offence very seriously, as should we. You can very easily exchange US cash at any bank in town (you will get the best deal at a bank). Most stores will take US cash but not always at the best rates.Let me know more questions, and I will try to help.dw"
