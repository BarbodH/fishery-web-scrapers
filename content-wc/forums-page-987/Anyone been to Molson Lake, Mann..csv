But the next time we went up the outfitter that was on the lake had it shut down to anyone other then Lodge guests, but on our trip last year a local guy told us it was opened back up. I'd like to hear if anyone else has heard the same or been there?"

We've been to Reed around 15 times, and it's good but the last time we were at Molson it was far better(that was long ago thou). Lst 2 years we went toVandekerckhove and it to is an awsome walleye and pike fishery!"
