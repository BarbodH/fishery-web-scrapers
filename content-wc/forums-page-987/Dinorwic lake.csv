Brown bay used to be quite run down, they have really upgraded it. It may not have all the fine things that more expensive places have (ie. restraunt, lounge etc.) but it is a great place to spend a week. I hope you have a good stay. Some good places in june are the flat on the North side of Butler. After you enter butler, go about a mile, then off to the right is a small island, just to the right of it is about a 10 acre flat that has cabbage weed. It has done well in June. Also, the Rock point prior to entering butler has offered up some nice eyes."

The fishing was really good for wally's right by our camp at Hubers, which was a great place to stay. If you go by the water fall and portage to the lake, it was full of smallies 3.5lbs, only one other boat on the lake. We swithced to LOTW last year and we will be going this year. We plan on going next year back to Huber's. Have a great time."

We always stayed at Hubers Lone Pine. Nice camp, pricey, but you usually get what you pay for. Head to Turtle Pond for the Smallies. I have two buddies that each have one on there walls from there. We also caught a few east of Graveyard Island throwing cranks to the rocky islands. The bigger walleyes are usually caught in Wabigoon, however have taken a 29"" off of graveyard island. Go to Dryden and buy the biggest minnows/ chubs you can for the big walleyes. Troll them on a whistler jig or spinner. They will try to sell you small bait, We learned the ""secret"" from a local pro while getting a motor repaired. Oh ya watch out for the rocks..... Check out the Dryden House if you like to unwind after a long day of fishing, good entertainment thruogh the week. SWeed"
