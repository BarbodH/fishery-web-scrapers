516480,Guest,2002-01-19 15:38:00,0,"I have fished Manitowik lake when I lived in Wawa. The ice is so so and if it doesn't get cold it's going to be dicey to fish on during the Derby. I would call in advance to make sure the lake is safe to travel on.It's a large lake with potential for for big lakers. You'll most likely catch lot's of 4-6 pounders but there are huge trout in the lake. All the snowmachine traffic seems to spook them during the derby so you have to be a smart fisherman to catch them. White tube jigs tipped with a shiner minnow are a good starting point. Abu Kosters , Swedish pimples, airplane jigs and williams wobbler spoons are good choices for jigging spoons. Some locals jig with NK28 spoons. Good luck"
