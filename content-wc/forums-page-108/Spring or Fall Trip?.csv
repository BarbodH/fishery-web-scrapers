We caught a bunch of fish this fall trip, as we usually do during our spring trips, but the fish were definitely deeper at around 25-27'. In the spring, we generally find the majority of the fish around 6-14', depending on the weather conditions and water temperatures. We definitely had fewer bugs and skeeters in the fall, and overall I would also say a little less wind. In both the spring and fall, we experienced both horrible and beautiful weather conditions for fishing. I can't really say there were less people because we flew into Winnipeg for the first time, so we didn't have to cross the border at INL, and this was also our first fly-in trip so we were going to be the only ones on the lake no matter what time of the year we went up there. I can say we had zero competition for our plane leaving from Lac Seul and we were allowed to stay a few extra days because we were the last group of the season, so that was a definite plus on the fall side. I will say it was really tough waiting all summer to go, and since I got back I haven't gone fishing locally a single time. Part of that is because Canada spoils us and also because of the hunting season. Many of you have stated that fall is your favorite time. Have you had similar experiences?"

6369660,BornToFish,2019-11-08 19:46:00,1224,"Greetings, Mojo: Your observations and comments about fishing in Ontario during spring versus autumn mirror my experiences. I have fished the last several seasons during the first week of the season, one week in July, another week in August and the last week of the season. Thus, I pretty well cover the open water season and experience it all. I find that the fish pretty much stay put in one place during August and September. I'm thinking ""game on"" when I catch one walleye in September, as I then know where they all are. Changes in the weather don't seem to impact the fish as much in the late season as it can in the springtime. Experience has shown me that fishing in spring can be chasing a moving target - here today and gone tomorrow (or even later in the same day). Autumn is my favorite time of the season to fish in NW Ontario when I consider all of the various factors. I believe that many anglers are out of their comfort zone when it comes to fishing in relatively deep water, often well away from shorelines. Boat control is what often distinguishes those anglers that catch fish in the late season from those that get frustrated. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6369686,Pooch,2019-11-09 03:53:00,4618,"Early fall is my favorite trip, but the weather has turned really cold on us a few times making for a sometimes almost unpleasant trip. Especially in some camps with little to no heat available in cabins. Bringing some cold weather gear just in case is prudent. That said, once in a while our fall trip has been the warmest trip of the year. It is very pretty in the late fall. The color contrasts between the pines and the leafed trees can be dramatic. Bugs are of little concern later in the year. That is a big plus for some folks. June or late June/early July can be the ""trying"" time of the year when fish are on the move. If ice out is early, some of my best fishing has been early to mid-July. Every years is a little bit different. Pooch"
6370048,Mojo-NC,2019-11-10 16:07:00,1929,"I'm probably going to kick myself for saying this because we have a trip scheduled for the first week of June 2020, but I've never really had that much of a problem with bugs during our first week of June trips. However, we are usually wearing a light jacket or long sleeves minimum. Our cabins also have a screened in porch area, so if the bugs are bad, we stay inside. I rarely even use bug spray. Therefore, I don't consider bugs a serious factor. I think it comes down to the preference of fishing deep or shallow, followed closely by the weather patterns. We brought quality electronics on our fall trip, so fishing deep water structure was not a problem. We used spinner rigs to find fish, and dropped waypoints where we caught fish and those spots stayed pretty consistent over 10 days. With so many waypoints to choose from, it was almost too easy, and our two boats rarely fished the same areas because we had so many choices of places to fish. All were about the same depth. We experienced both beautiful and pretty horrible weather in both spring and fall, so that's still a tossup. I think I don't want to have to choose. I would like to fish both seasons each year."
6370180,MrSimon,2019-11-11 09:02:00,922,"One thing I've learned from fishing many times in September is that you don't always have to fish deep water. If fact, we catch a lot more fish in 7-15' FOW than we do down below 20'. The key is being CLOSE to deep water .... and then targeting the fish when they get active and slide shallower. That's when the magic happens. Or target current, weeds, reefs, boulders, flats ..... all of which can hold fish in the fall and be somewhat shallow."
6370210,Pooch,2019-11-11 11:34:00,4618,"Regardless of when we fish Ontario there are always some, but usually not a lot of bugs. Depends on where and when you are there. Yea, ankle biters in the boat are a nuisance and mosquitoes near the timber are tough. One of our guys has a home on Boy Lake in MN and the bugs are many times more aggravating there than Ontario. I wouldn't time my trip to avoid the bugs. Just deal with them. Probably the one that annoys us about as much as anything are the Mayflies during a heavy hatch. Come down to the boat in the morning and it's plastered with dead Mayflies covering about everything in the boat. Ankle biters? Long pants, thick socks and barn spray. Mosquitoes around the camp? Just don't hang around outside in the evenings and Deet on clothes. Mayflies? Fish where they are not hatching as heavily. When Mayflies are hatching one of our guys fishes a tiny brown/tan jig and leech. That rig might also appear similar to the freshwater shrimp fish puke up sometimes. Just some more (IMO) thoughts about when to plan a trip. Pooch"

6370692,gordy28,2019-11-13 08:14:00,437,"Our group has consistently gone at the end of August beginning of September so I can't contrast. However we love this time of year as there are little to know bugs, weather is relatively predictable and it's not prime time so travell and wait times are great"
