6370964,Skywagon,2019-11-15 05:32:00,1106,What is the purpose of the boards that are sticking up from each shack? to hold up an electric line to a generator (had to ask).
6370968,prov1800,2019-11-15 06:08:00,5010,They are the poles for the electricity.Couple more poles will be put up from shore yet to run the wires for the lights.Both shacks are heated with propane.
