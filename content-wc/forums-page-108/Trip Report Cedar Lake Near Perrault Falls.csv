6365120,prov1800,2019-10-15 16:29:00,5010,"Still out there on Cedar Lake fishing.Weather has not been very good just to much rain,Walleye bite is still pretty good just no big schools but enough fish but still good action.Water on all lakes really rising and going over some of the docks you can see how far up the water is at northern lights launch area.dont ever think ive had my rear tires in the water to get my boat off the trailer.Heading out again this week and will try for some walleyes and some bigger muskies hopefully."
6365196,Bill Krejca,2019-10-16 07:14:00,6107,"Nice coloration on the leaves, have to enjoy the picture. Should still be some good fishing left, weather permitting. Bill"
6365200,prov1800,2019-10-16 07:29:00,5010,Weather has not been good.Trying to go in between storms.we are planning on a day tomorrow.weather is working it's way up.blue skies today and a high of 15c for the weekend.looking to get out this weekend for some fishing with my wife.fishing is actually pretty good just slower than what I think it should.not complaining.still can out 30-40 walleyes in the boat in between muskie spots.we catch lots of bass to.Hopefully we will get to east end and see if the crappies bite.if the weather turns out nice we will make the run down there.
6365250,pjshorthorn,2019-10-16 13:25:00,5654,"Hey John, since walleye catch rates are slowing down a bit the use of a good bouy marker is more important than ever to stay on that honey hole. Did you get yourself one of those new fangled pink markers yet ? PjShorthorn"
6365256,prov1800,2019-10-16 14:09:00,5010,I've been looking for them but just can't find any.lol.ill just have to put up with my terrova and the slow fishing.lol.
6365268,prov1800,2019-10-16 17:52:00,5010,Few more pics of Cedar Lake.Headed out tomorrow on Perrault Lake out Manotak Lodge but will definatly get to cedar.More of a muskie mission but we will look for some walleye to.
6365330,Bill Krejca,2019-10-17 07:14:00,6107,"Great pictures, love the coloration. I camped out on LOW in 1966, in mid-Oct, in between snows, fishing was just so-so, but the yellow in the trees was phenomenal. Re: pink buoys - Cedar Point had some similar sign posts for direction along their road in, planted by guests, I suppose. Maybe these will replace the new balanced rocks which crop up here and there. Bill"
6365388,prov1800,2019-10-17 14:58:00,5010,"Fall time is beautifull to some of us.lol.Fished for muskie and walleye on Perrault lake today with Jermiah from Manotak lodge.We saw one muskie which happened to be a nice one but the walleyes eluded us there.Thought about running to Cedar as we were within a couple of miles from the burnt bridge but decided not to.Had a fun day,with some sunshine for a change.water temp at 48f today which made it feel cool with the 15-20km winds from south."
6361978,Bill Krejca,2019-10-01 08:25:00,6107,"Just back from Cedar Lake crappie search, week of Sept 21, stayed at Cedar Point Resort. Arrival at the lake was accompanied by a torrential rain downpour, even parts of the highway were covered by running water. Had a great trip with lots of fun, however the fishing was off from normal for the lake for most of the week due to high water temperature. The lake temperature upon arrival was 65 degrees, up from 59 several weeks ago, after air temps in the 80's the prior week, completely uncharacteristic for the last part of September. The crappies normally bunch up as the water cools, and normally go on a feeding frenzy(at least that has been our normal experience, here and on other waters). Instead, fish were scattered and when found did not take our artificials like normal. We probably averaged about 50 fish/day/boat, 3 people in boat, past years would have been perhaps 60-80+/person, so it definitely was down. Size was good, many 14"", or a bit over, didn't keep anything less than 12-1/2"""", mostly 13's+. Nice fish. First day, I got 26-1/2"" walleye and lost a nice muskie at the boat, all while crappie fishing. I later got a 25"" walleye, which was as absolutely as fat a fish as I have seen. Fish were taken from Cedar, Nelson, and Peephole, all connecting waters. These were the largest walleyes caught by our group. Wind was from the south most of week, then west, lots of cooling rain, water temp finally dropped to 60 by Friday. This week probably would have been a normal bonanza. A moose with 2 young ones was spotted out on the lake, pretty cool. As always, partridge were on the camp road, lots of eagles on the lake. Leaf coloring was way behind for the time, but still beautiful, part of the look-forward overall experience to enjoy. One of our party of 6 smoked some crappie on the Weber grill, absolutely delicious!! All in all, a great week with family and friends. I made a mental note to avoid being the first to go to bed, at least before making sure to hide my phone and boots, lots of laughs the next morning. Looking forward to returning next year, Ray and Kathi being excellent hosts at the camp. Bill"
6361986,kettyspanky,2019-10-01 09:02:00,271,"Good to hear you caught some. I'm going to get there some year, just not sure when yet. I am hoping to do a july trip. Where do you think the crappie and perch to be that time of year? Walleye would be a bonus but not the main target. Thanks for the report."
6362054,Bill Krejca,2019-10-01 12:29:00,6107,"Well, those buggers move around, so likely to be about any/every where. I'd start where last caught, perhaps somewhat shallower than in the fall. say 12-15 ft, and then move in/out from there. As the wind and other conditions change, so goes the fish, walleyes being about same. An example of change: Last week, we found the crappies preferred the shadows in the morning, and as soon as the sun got up higher, they stopped biting there, or just moved, then time to hunt. One place to start, for about everything, any time, is to find the nastiest stretch where the wind is ripping in, and fish it, if you can, as long as you can. Bill"
6362104,prov1800,2019-10-01 17:27:00,5010,Great report Bill.Love hearing from guys that enjoy being up here even if the fishing wasn't up to par.Them crappies can be hard to find.In my experiences with them I find they are basically in the same spots.When they aren't biting they are not far off.usually they will swim away at what ever depth they were in and stay in that depth and will go over deeper water and suspend there.Have to look for them but they are there and will bite.I usually slip bobber them but I do use minnows for crappies summer and winter.Ill fill you in tomorrow as I'll be taking a couple of guys out on cedar tomorrow. Have been on the Indian Lake Chain for walleye last few days and water temps are 54f today so imagine will be same on Cedar.Mainly after walleye but I should make it to east end in next couole of days.
6362130,Pooch,2019-10-01 19:41:00,4618,"""making sure to hide my phone and boots""OK Bill. What's the story here? A lot of strange happenings in a fishing or hunting camps.Pooch"
6362196,Bill Krejca,2019-10-02 07:03:00,6107,"Ah, there is always a story behind the story. I normally wear a Stearns camo floatation suit out in the boat, which suffices for both warmth, and rain. As it is rather bulky, my apparel is known as the Doughboy suit, Michelin Man suit, etc. After struggling to get it on, the shoes/boots are last to be put on. Just bending over becomes am athletic event - think Sumo wrestler bend over, so much an event that I was once photoed struggling to get footed. The sad activity on the morning in question took up as the boot event started. I commented re: a past footing photo of a previous event . As I finally got one boot on, I noticed my sock was apparently bent over in the toe, as there wasn't enough room. After finally getting boot back off, the finding was that there were 3 packs of ""fun size"" Snickers et al in the toe. Coincidentally, all members of the stay-up-late committee stood watching and roared with delight after witnessing my stellar performance. Being nobody's dummy? I decided to Czech out the other boot, which turned out to also be loaded. I confess I laughed so hard, the tears flowed off my waterproof apparel! Now ready finally to go out into the more friendly outdoors, my son Nate asked about my new smart phone, I handed it to him and he then pulled up some new absolutely stupid photos of my friends'? hardly recognizable faces plus another picture which I won't describe. Another laugh fest. It ain't all about the fishin' , makin' memories!! Bill"
6362332,prov1800,2019-10-02 16:53:00,5010,Didn't get to east end of cedar today.fished closer to Clarks and walleye bite was so good my vuys didntvwant to go further.there on there way home tom so left my boat at Clark's and I'll head out solo tomorrow and do some muskie fishing and try some crappies if I get to east end.
6362438,prov1800,2019-10-03 05:37:00,5010,Fun day on Cedar Lake.weather has sucked lately but catching fish kinda warms you up and lifts your spirits.
6362494,Bill Krejca,2019-10-03 08:09:00,6107,"Nice catch, John, wish we could have hit some of that cooler water last week! Bill"
6362658,prov1800,2019-10-03 16:05:00,5010,Got out on cedar today Bill.snowed and rained most of the morning.water temp today 53f.Mainly a muskie day.saw 4 on the rocks but all pretty spooky at boat side.fished 4 reefs near Clark's and saw one fish on each one.stopped to walleye fish a bit and really got into the smallies at 26 ft.real aggressive.had to move aroundcto other spots as those smallies seemed to be on the feed bag this morning.finally found the walleyes and then 4 dropped with the lindy rig and I was done.fished the 4 reefs again and no action.again did not make it to east end.was going to go but said no thanks.was snowing real good.better weather next week so I'll get out some more.beautifull day except for the snow and rain.Got to love fall.
