6364114,dosxx,2019-10-10 16:04:00,60,"I’ve never camped there but Racine Lake Campground is about 30 minutes of bad road north of Chapleau. It is a good sized lake but if you are going early there is a large portion that is a fish reserve (not sure the exact end date in June). I looked into renting a bunkhouse there but it didn’t work out for us.Also, I’m going to Como Lake to give them a try next year and I think they have camp sites. I can’t vouch for the fishing on Como but I’m hoping it’s good.Good luck in your search!"

6364270,madnomad,2019-10-11 09:20:00,34,the road is not that bad
6364394,adempsey2.0,2019-10-11 23:13:00,611,I honestly have no idea. It was in pure jest. I have never been down that road.
6364442,Bill Krejca,2019-10-12 10:12:00,6107,"Road is fine if you go at a decent pace, depends on various factors, like most wilderness roads. Sould be no problem with rv. Bill"

6365450,Live to jig,2019-10-17 22:03:00,159,Good choice!
6363528,MrSimon,2019-10-08 09:26:00,922,"I know there are a few drive-to lodges that have campgrounds and spots for RVs, but there aren't too many. Does anyone know of a nice place that doesn't have an advertised campground, but would allow me to park a motorhome on the property with my kids for a week? We wouldn't need hook-ups, just a spot with a nice view and some dock space. Obviously I'd pay a fair price for the week. Wawa, Hornepayne, White River, Nakina area."
6363558,madnomad,2019-10-08 12:16:00,34,i believe pasha lake cabins has an rv park
6363578,Huntindave,2019-10-08 15:21:00,2194,"What do you have against an ""advertised campground""? Usually the available dock space is directly tied to the number of cabins, camping spots, motel units, etc the resort has for capacity. Buena Vista Resort has a campground and they accept RVs but they do advertise their campground."
6363580,Bill Krejca,2019-10-08 15:24:00,6107,O'Sullivan's Rainbow has a very small camping area which might suit you. Bill
6363594,kettyspanky,2019-10-08 19:21:00,271,Come by chance resort on Whitefish lake. Nolalu Ontario. Awesome place to park an rv and dock space.
6363652,MrSimon,2019-10-09 06:08:00,922,"I have nothing against advertised campgrounds. I love them!! There just aren't too many. O'Sullivan's is definitely on the top of my list, but it's a long drive (24 hours) by myself with three kids. Somewhere between Wawa and Chapleau would knock 5 or 6 hours off the drive. When I was a kid my grandfather drove us to a handful of places north of Hornepayne and we just parked on the grass for the week. It was great. The camp owner just pointed to a spot and said ""let me know if you need anything."" I was just curious if places like that still exist."

6363682,MrSimon,2019-10-09 07:25:00,922,I appreciate the suggestions! But I mentioned the location in the first post ... can the lodges at least be East of Nipigon?
6363690,adempsey2.0,2019-10-09 07:59:00,611,"There really arent that many lodges in that area. You could easily email them to see if they would accommodate you. Paquettes Camp advertises an RV park. You've been to Happy Day Lodge, I thought they had camp sites as well?Also Ivanhoe Lake PP is worth a look. Might be able to rent a boat from Red Pine Lodge next door, which has a large RV park. Beautiful beach on the lake.Big Bear Camp on Horwood Lake has camping as well.Good luck!Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk"
6363760,MrSimon,2019-10-09 14:08:00,922,"Thanks. Yes, I've taken a motor home to Happy Day before and it was fun. Unfortunately their RV sites are within spitting distance of the generator that runs the entire camp 24/7. I won't do that again. The lodges on Ivanhoe are nice. I looked into them as well. It's on my list, but the I think I can get notably better fishing if I keep digging. I'm going to look at Horwood now. I hadn't considered them. Thanks!"
