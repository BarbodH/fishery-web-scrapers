I will go to either Mahkwa Lodge on Lac Suel or Indianhead Lodge on LOW. Will use the AP plan at either. If you have been to either, I would appreciate your thoughts on them. Will be going in August 2020"

The smallmouth fishing is fantastic. Walleyes, to get any consistency, we had to find the tannic water and we had to trip a ways. I would go back there in a heartbeat. Lodge owners are great and it was really affordable. Haven't been to the Lac Seul camp you mentioned, but I would speculate that the walleye fishing there would probably be a lot easier."
