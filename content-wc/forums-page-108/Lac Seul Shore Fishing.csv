6366256,ILScott,2019-10-22 15:45:00,139,Looking for a place to take 3 teenagers the Friday afternoon before we go into camp. We are staying in Perrault Falls and would like to fish Lac Seul from shore or public dock. We will be in town June 5th. Any advice would be appreciated. Scott

FYI, my 2nd largest walleye was caught during shore lunch. Sitting on a Rock point with the wind blowing out of the NW that created a nice wave to calm line in the water. Lindy Rigged a fat leech on a floating jig head and threw it in about 12 ft of water. While eating my brat I noticed my line was moving against the small current, set the hook and landed a fat 28.75"" while the rest of the group watched. Nice way to spend some time."

But I catch 90% of my walleyes within casting distance of shore anyway, why would it be so unbelievable that you can actually catch them standing on shore? Btw, the replica of that fish is on my wall, the real one swam away to be caught another day, maybe by me when it is 32"" (probably not). And we shore lunch that same point every time we are in the area. Shore lunch is provided by my small Coleman propane grill, which has been beat up, dented, bounced and dunked in the lake, and still fires up on demand, going to be hard to replace the old girl."

6367728,MagMarco,2019-10-30 09:53:00,15,"Day after memorial service for my dad was on a canoe trip in BWCA. Small lake and tired after being up 48 hours, wore out and found a campsite to set up tents. 30"" 31"" and 32.5"" that night from shore. Figured it was divine guidance by dad. Added two more over 30 during the week. Get called a liar but have pictures. Engineer on one site even measured my hands and compared to fish and verified lengths. I have taken friends to the lake and 27-29"" are caught, swear them all to secrecy about the eyes, its known as a pan fish lake."

6367756,David Anderson,2019-10-30 11:57:00,2073,"Maybe you could stop by Frog Rapids Camp just before Sioux Lookout, and ask them if you could fish along their camp or docks as I would expect that fishing from shore would be pretty good there because it is right at the outlet and there is plenty of current flowing. Maybe throw them a few bucks for the consideration. We stay at Lac Seul Outpost about 3 times a year. I know it's not accessible for your situation however one of the best fishing spots is right off their main dock, so it's certainly a strategy."
