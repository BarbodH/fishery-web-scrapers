I am not sure which site we booked through, as I was not the one who placed the booking. The group going normally does a houseboat out of Sioux Narrows, but they are getting up there in years, and thought this route might be a better option. This is a one year test, if they like it they will stay with it, if not go back to the house boat. Its not my regular group, but I have fished with them many times since 1995. My Son and I are joining them in 2020 due to my normal group splitting up and doing different adventures in 2020. Its a new area of Lake of the Woods for all of us in the group, I am a little concerned that we will not like it as much, now that we are going to be closer to civilization and will see a lot more boat traffic. Normally we run 6 hours out of Sioux Narrows with the house boat, and settle between Skeet Island and Arrow Head."

6369168,Knutson21,2019-11-06 11:41:00,348,"Funny you say that. This past summer was the first time my son went with us, he is 7. We stayed in a cabin on the Wabigoon River that has no plumbing or electricity. The toilet is a compost one in a shed and the Shower is an outside shower pumped out of the lake. Next Summer we will have granite counter tops, wifi, all the comforts of home, etc. I will have a tough time in future years to get him back to the rustic cabin. haha!"
6369344,MN_Moose,2019-11-07 11:56:00,964,That looks to be right at the mouth of Longbow. We stay in that area all the time. You can get gas at Smith Camps (on the water) or Reddens for vehicles (if they get it re-opened) what time of the year is your group going?

6370114,WallyWarrior,2019-11-10 19:55:00,2488,"We stayed at one on an ice fishing trip up north. The place was immaculate and way more than we wanted or needed. You're in a different situation taking the ladies along, but for us it was almost uncomfortable trying to keep things at the level we walked into. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6368186,LoDo,2019-11-02 08:39:00,721,"Has anyone tried to airbnb their cabin or stayed in a private cabin through Airbnb? Is there a market for this? I'm guessing this could be a big liability, but curious if anyone is using airbnb for their fishing vacation."
6368202,Esoxmike,2019-11-02 10:16:00,114,"I booked a cottage for this June in Ontario on the website""VRBO"" very similar to air bnb.eventually spoke to the owner and seems like a good service except they charge a percentage.after this year's stay in gonna c if she wants to cut out the middleman"
6368208,turtle chain,2019-11-02 11:07:00,1398,I know they changed the rule in northern wi and now allow the rental of your house by the day or week.That said there are alot of really nice places to rent out there.We have been thinking of doing a b&b at some point Good luck
6368210,adempsey2.0,2019-11-02 11:34:00,611,"Did the same a few years back. Long weekend ice fishing trip. Booked through VRBO. It wasn't a remote fly-in camp or anything though. Just a drive-to cottage on a small lake in cottage country southern Ontario. Was a really nice cottage though.There are definitely private cabins for rent all over. If you are looking for a private fly-in, maybe start with contacting all the air services and see if they service any."
6368212,Esoxmike,2019-11-02 12:02:00,114,"We have fished this lake for 30yrs.we always stayed at the same cabins but after the disaster we had this year(showed up for last week of may and place was a ghost-town)it was time to find different accommodations.no other ""fishing"" cabins on lake but the small house we found will be great,only problem is it's too nice/clean.i always loved old dumpy cabins for fishing trips,just sweep out at end of week and head home!this trip turned into more of a family anyhow so my wife and sister in law will keep us slobby fishermen in line!"
6368310,LoDo,2019-11-03 08:55:00,721,"I've done Airbnb in the states multiple times. Its a great service, makes sense financially for both parties and great for large groups. Where I'm going with this, is if you owned a private cabin yourself or with a group of friends equipped with camps boats, solar, etc... would you airbnb the camp when not in use? I'm thinking of the liability and safety piece. A group coming in, hitting a rock in the boat, slip off the dock and hurt themselves, ruin something in camp, worst case starting a fire... Id think the liability alone is a killer. Without having a caretaker at the cabin Id imagine it would be awfully difficult accusing one of damage to the property. Would you have the party sign some documentation of liability? We've all been to camps where the owner/manager etc... is at camp while you are present. At most you're flown or boat ride to an outpost. Do we sign liability documentation while at commercial camps?"
6368322,turtle chain,2019-11-03 09:31:00,1398,This is an issue we thought about renting out our whole house with out being there? We decided we would rent out our lower level while we are there to manage the guests. People can still get hurt or damage stuff so good insurance would be a must! and have a contract
6368330,Lmbkiller,2019-11-03 09:54:00,639,Pretty sure airbnb covers all that (exactly why you're affiliated with them). I wanna say a friend of mine said it was like a million dollar insurance policy
6368360,LoDo,2019-11-03 12:13:00,721,"It just seems like too much can go wrong not knowing the party thats in your camp w/o an owner or caretaker on site. This trip is all about experience for me. Knowing the boats, depth finders, lake, boat/motor experience, etc... As far as camp goes, its much of the same. Fish fryers, septic, solar, working generators, burning trash, managing camp and camp etiquette. For us its easier to sleep at night knowing who is in there. Perhaps i'm over thinking..."
6368374,turtle chain,2019-11-03 13:38:00,1398,If you rent someones personal property the quality Might be better? They set these places up not to rent So they might have better stuff Maybe? the places for rent by me are all decked out boats kayaks pontoon boats hot tubs good luck
