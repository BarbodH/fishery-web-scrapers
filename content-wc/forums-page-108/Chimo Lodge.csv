6340348,That Minnesota guy,2019-07-13 07:09:00,8293,I can't imagine watching any forest fire anywhere advancing on your home or business. What a helpless feeling that must be. Hopefully they were insured to the hilt.
6340360,RichA$1970,2019-07-13 07:34:00,1159,I was at Hornby from July 1 to July 9 as they were delayed due to the fire for an extra 1.5 days of fishing. I believe the main camp at Roderick had 4 cabins n the main building burnt and maybe one other outpost. Fishing was pretty good at Hornby and we saw the smoke but no issues.
6341014,Pink Unicorn,2019-07-15 11:47:00,83,"Owners cabin, managers cabin and lake side cabin burnt. 3 or possibly the 4th cabin up top survived. They are now hauling supplies and rebuilding. Chris said they will be ready for the opener May 2020."

6365520,Undeterred,2019-10-18 12:35:00,2,"The post was made prior to registering, but it was wild. My father and I were at My Lake, and were lucky enough to get a signal on the sat phone long enough to be told that the helicopter would be there in less that 15 minutes.Photos show progression from 4 PM, to 7:05 PM, to 7:45 PM (third photo). Started actually seeing flames about 7:15 ish."
6365524,Pink Unicorn,2019-10-18 12:44:00,83,You guys were perhaps the luckiest of all! Someone was certainly looking out for you guys that day. Wow!
6365526,Undeterred,2019-10-18 13:00:00,2,"We most certainly did have someone watching over us. We were prepping to load all of our gear into a boat, and just go float as far from shore as possible, which would have been interesting because it was a week or more before they were able to fly into the lake to even check the damage. Fortunately, that was the Friday evening before we were to be picked up the next day. On the downside, since there was not enough room in the heli to take our gear, we had to leave it on the shoreline because we had so little time, and it was all consumed in the fire. If we had left it in the cabin, it may have been OK as from what we were being told, the cabin survived, mostly unharmed."
6365530,KSjim,2019-10-18 13:54:00,88,Wow! That is scary stuff. I can only imagine the emotions running through you and your father. Our group has fished the lake down river from My several times (Unnamed) with Loon Haunt Outfitters. Their cabin also survived mostly unharmed but they did loose their gas shed. Hate to ask about the fishing but we always had very good fishing ( size and numbers) at Unnamed and I always wondered what the fishing at My was like.
6365532,Pink Unicorn,2019-10-18 14:04:00,83,I could be wrong but I swear Daniel told me My was a total loss?
