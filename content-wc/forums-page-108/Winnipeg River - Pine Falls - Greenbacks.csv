6358072,frozen fish,2019-09-13 05:32:00,92,"We have been in a rainy pattern and water levels should rise. Current water level is low. With a lot of wind lately water clarity is poor. We fished Sept. 11, poor success. Wind from the East, fishing is least. But only 6 mini walleye caught between two of us? No drum, no perch caught. And no bait clouds. Water temp is 62. We will see how the season progresses."

6362136,robm_mb,2019-10-01 20:42:00,48,"High water on LOTW as of late is going to mean high flows on the Winnipeg River well into fall. I don't have any first hand info on the fishing as of recently, but here's the map you'll want to put some fish in the boat.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhH0FEIjtJM"
6363402,luv2huntnfish,2019-10-07 18:46:00,73,"Thanks for the sharing the map and flow info. Anyone out there been fishing or is everyone keeping tight lipped do to the weekend tournament? I am not in the tournament just looking for specifics but like to know if worth a trip up from the states. Planning to travel on Sunday the 13th unless fishing is slow similar to last year. Questions I have are like current water temp, water clarity, bait in system, as yes if someone can share info on numbers of fish being caught. Size isn't my concern but welcome, but would like to access some numbers of walleye."
6363416,frozen fish,2019-10-07 20:24:00,92,"We fished Pine Falls today (Oct 7/19). We fished both the bay and the mouth of the Winnipeg River. Weather conditions: temp 2C-17C. Winds South to 25 kph. Water temperature 53.4F. Water clarity: fair. Current: moderate to strong, a gate is open at the dam. Water level: high. Walleyes caught: 12"", 12"", 17"", 18"", 18"",19"", 20"", 28"" plus a 15 lb channel cat. All caught with jig and frozen salted shiner. About a dozen boats to start the day when we arrived at 8:45 am, many more came out during the day as the parking lot was much busier when we quit at 4:30. Watch the weather forecast as there is a major storm expected later in the week."
