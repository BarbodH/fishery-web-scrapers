6366990,Mark R,2019-10-27 07:39:00,1538,Has anyone stayed here? What do you think? Did you stay on American plan or housekeeping? Did you use a guide? Would you go back?
6367024,Sniper1980,2019-10-27 10:38:00,33,"There are many other resorts for far cheaper. Just my opinion. I’m sure it’s a great place, but inconvenient to fish lac seul"
6367038,x4flatfish,2019-10-27 12:15:00,319,"Have not stayed there under current ownership. I do agree that if you want to fish Lac Seul from there, there are probably better choices. You will have a boat ride or a truck ride just to get to Lac Seul. They do have good guides. (some post on this sight) You can fish Minitaki, Pelican and Abrams lakes easily from there. Either American, or housekeeping plan would be good. What are you looking for from your trip?"
6367040,eyecatcher1,2019-10-27 12:22:00,323,"I have never stayed there, but do stay just a stones throw away from there. I fish mostly Lac Seul and it's about a 15 minute ride to the Deception boat launch from the resort. You can get to Lac Seul by boat when the water levels are up, but it's a long boat ride. On bad weather days I fish Abram, Minnitaki or Pelican Lakes."
6367058,Mark R,2019-10-27 14:17:00,1538,Thanks for responding. I guess I wasn’t sure where Moosehorn was located. I’m looking for a place where we can catch walleye and have a fair shot at a large Muskie
6367134,x4flatfish,2019-10-27 19:27:00,319,"If you are willing to use a guide, and looking for muskie, Moosehorn guides are well known for finding them. Check their website for info. I would not discourage you from staying there, just want you to know that they are not located on Lac Seul. You can catch walleye on any of the mentioned bodies of water. You will not, in my opinion, have much chance of catching muskie without a guide. I would also say that if you have never been on these waters before, a guide is a good investment. This is a large flowage with many hazards, that can be difficult to navigate..."

If you are new to Lac Suel than spending at least a couple days with one of their guides is a great idea. We brought my boat up and stayed under the housekeeping plan but used a guide for our first 3 days. I plan to return next fall to Moosehorn."
6367340,btyreprich,2019-10-28 18:52:00,1067,"This was our go to lodge for many, many years when Jeff & Heather owned the lodge. Great people / nice cabins, well maintained boats. The long boat rides up to the main body of Lac Seul had us look for a better alternative and so we choose the Ear Falls area and have been going back ever since. If you decide to stay at Moosehorn, i second the suggestion of hiring a guide to learn the lake. We always caught fish and enjoyed ourselves on that section of the lake."
6367354,prov1800,2019-10-28 20:08:00,5010,I've fished lac suel numerous times with buddies of mine that live in Sioux.have launched at deception bay and fished very close to the launch and fishing was excellent and very safe.plenty of muskies to.can also launch from Hudson and also excellent fishing from lost lake area and if water is high you can shoot through pelican rapids but shoukd have someone show you that trick a couple of times.so it's not that far of boat rides to get good fishing.guides just end up taking you far but you don't need to do that.abram and minitaki are both excellent lakes but not many muskies.pelican lake does have some.the earfalls side is also excellent fishing but only a hand full of muskies there over the years I've fished there.there are not many camps situated on lac suel.lost island lodge in Hudson would be the closest unless you you go to the makwa lodge area.if you don't want to drive to launch maybe eagle lake or cedar lake or the Indian lake chain would be better.
