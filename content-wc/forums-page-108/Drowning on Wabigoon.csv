548913,Guest,2005-06-07 20:39:00,0,"As a Lac Seul veteran, I couldn't imagine how many bouys you would need if you had to start marking every reef. I know some of the few bouys out there moved from one year to the next, or disappeared altogether, although I can't imagine the thick ice and 6-8' water level changes (being a reservoir) would help. I suppose it could be a good make-work project . . . local employment . . . yeah, the feds might go for that!?!? No, obviously such an endeavour is not practical in most NWO water bodies, nor needed for that matter. The cost of such a marker program would bury the cost for prop repairs, new props, lower units, etc. You certainly can't attach a cost to a tragedy like this, but such of this severity are rare, and we still don't know if there were other complicating factors at play here. I, luckily have yet to hammer a rock with any speed in the boat, though I'm sure I probably will someday. I do know however a guide with three guests who hit a shallow reef full out, at 30-31mph, took the lower unit clean off, in an 18' Lund ProV, and the guests were old! Nobody ejected, everyone tossed around, and two guests, including the guy in the front, got sent to the boat floor, out of the standard Lund pedastal seats. Does that mean you need to be going faster than 30? I don't know. There must be something else, at least some other detail if not more, which would perhaps allow us to narrow the range of speculation . . ."
548920,rockpt,2005-06-07 22:03:00,589,I agree we can't expect the govt. to mark all the rocks and reefs for us. Shouldn't go out without a good map and know where you are at all times. The Canadian govt. produces some excellent maps. Also good point about the danger of the occasional boater racing around with a 50 hp outboard. I think it's remarkable we don't see more stories about drownings. Everybody be safe this summer.
548924,Guest,2005-06-08 05:42:00,0,"What a novel idea... Mark the rock piles... What a ""no brainer"" The cost to mark the rocks, surly is much less than a human life not to mention all the props/lower units and boats that have been damaged. Guess that is revenue for the area???"
548926,Guest,2005-06-08 07:08:00,0,"two weeks ago, one of the guys I fish with hit a rock on Eagle Lake, a rock that he knew was there, he just wasn't paying attention to where he was going, and he was in a 14 foot Lund with a 15hp on it. the collision threw his passenger (6'5"" 320 pound man) to the floor of the boat. It isn't the speed you go it's probably the angle you hit the rock at. As far as buoys on the lakes, the Canadian government, not the MNR, made the decision to remove the buoys, as a cost cutting measure. Each area where the buoys were removed were given an opportunity to come to an agreement in keeping and maintaining the buoys. In Red Lake a committee was formed and we, who use the lake, pay $25 per boat for the season to help cover the repair costs, the relocation costs in the spring and this keeps our lake safe. In Kenora, the people there ""adopted"" a buoy to maintain their buoys, however, in Dryden the Yacht club attempted to partner with the City of Dryden to maintain the buoys and the City turned them down because they didn't want the liability that came with the maintaining the markers. Short sightedness on the part of municipal councils, who promote tourism, is one of the main causes of this tragedy."
548948,gapr,2005-06-08 12:39:00,192,"the problem with marking is liability, they used to mark reefs on a lake we fish in northern saskatchewan and they quit the program because of (this is the sick part)individuals moving the buoys off the rocks. this is a large lake with plenty of reef and outcroppings that cannot be monitored at all times. by marking the rock it would assume they are accepting responsibility, by not marking the rock there is no responsibility (as cold as that sounds after hearing about the above tragedy). in a world that is safety regulated as much as it is, there is still some dangers we face."
548954,Guest,2005-06-08 14:11:00,0,"More deaths it seems that can be attributed to us living in a litigious society. Everyone is so scared to get their collective asses sued off that nothing, in the end, is done about these water hazards. Shame. Your courts and lawyers in action folks!"
548957,Jimmy Jig,2005-06-08 15:01:00,1905,"The main cause of this tragedy wasn't the fault of the government, it was the mens own fault for not wear life jackets! Storing them in the storage compartment or strapped over the back of the seat doesnt do much good. When I tell people that I always wear one when in the boat the first thing they always say is Oh, you cann't swim. Its alway strange most drownings are people that are good swimmers. Yes, I can swim, but I don't want to try it in those conditions."
548958,rebelrn2001,2005-06-08 16:15:00,1563,My wife and I leave in about 36 hrs for Wabigoon (different lodge). I'm sure the lodge owner will have more details on what happened--he is buddy-buddy w/the MNR. I'll post when we get back.
548998,Guest,2005-06-09 14:37:00,0,I have know the Mckay family for about ten years. My son and Dan's son played hockey together since they were five years old. They were on the same teams untill they were twelve. Dan leaves behind a wonderful wife and two children. A son who is 17 and a daughter who is 16. He will be missed and I want to say thank you to all of your kind comments and I will make sure to pass them along to the family. God bless you all.
6369874,Guest,2019-11-09 22:34:00,0,"Thank you so much. This is random, but this was actually a family member of mine. This was my great uncle and as a child I remember hearing stories of his death but couldn't remember what happened. This thread was helpful and I appreciate a kind message like this as I remember how this impacted my family."
548877,rockpt,2005-06-06 14:38:00,589,"Be careful out there. By Janet Gibson Miner and News Monday June 06, 2005 Two Illinois fishermen who weren't wearing personal flotation devices or life jackets drowned on Friday, June 3 on Wabigoon Lake, Dryden OPP Const. Diane Harder said. The men arrived at Bonny Bay Camp in Wabigoon for a fishing holiday on May 27, the police said. On June 3, they went fishing on Daunais Bay. Witnesses spotted their boat and the body of one of the men and called the police. A search by OPP officers with the marine unit, emergency response team and underwater search and recovery unit found the body of the second man on Sunday, June 5, at 5 p.m., the police said. Walter Huber, the owner of another fishing resort on Lake Wabigoon, said some of his guests told him they'd heard the fishermen had fallen from their boat when they hit a rock in the lake. The Canadian Coast Guard used to mark the rock with a buoy, he said, but removed the buoy about three years ago. Huber said he spoke to a worker at the Canadian Coast Guard office in Kenora three to four years ago about marking rocks with buoys. The worker told him it was too expensive to install the buoys and maintain them. A day before the fishermen drowned, Huber sent his guide out on the lake to mark some rocks with javex bottles. Dead are Jeff Brzozowski, 44, of Hoffman Estates and Dan McKay, 44, of Franklin Park."

548892,Guest,2005-06-07 08:05:00,0,"This has always been a struggle for me. I am a certified cold water drysuit diver and know the effects of cold water more than most. I like to fish early in the season and often times on large bodies of Canadian water. Problem is the water is so cold I doubt having even a $200 auto-inflation vest would make any difference. I dont if I could swim to shore in the 5 minutes are so 50 degree water affords the body. I've kidded friends that the vests were there to save the 'authorities' money in finding the body. I guess this isn't really funny when something like this happens. Despite my doubts I have the suspender inflation vests and dry kit with matches & whistle on my belt. Not sure that it would matter, but you might as well give yourself the best chance possible. Bobby"

548902,Guest,2005-06-07 15:18:00,0,"It is always difficult when you hear of these occurences. Does anyone have some more details on this, obviously the news release lacked detail, perhaps because the details are not known??? Was them hitting a rock what actually happened or is this a theory? Striking a rock hard enough to eject two men, and/or really hurt them, or do whatever it was that killed them . . . if they drowned they either couldn't swim or were knocked unconscious somehow before entering the water? A collision of this magnitude surely caused significant damage to the boat, or at a minimum removed the lower unit? Who were these other people? If they did hear such a collision, did they not check it out right away? If not, why not?? And if so, were they already dead?? And how big was this boat? I just checked the hourly weather for June 3rd in that area and I didn't see anything to suggest bad weather was a factor here. Mainly cloudy, with some small mid-day showers, average daytime wind speed, fairly normal air pressure, decent temps, certainly nothing I would consider bad or challenging . . . I don't want in any way to trivialize this unfortuneate occurence, but in keeping with the intention of this thread, to educate us all to be safer on the water, I think anyone having spent significant time fishing in NWO would have many questions as to how this all unfolded. WAS ALCOHOL A FACTOR??? Hmmmm . . . Anyone have more details? NWO Fishing Bum"
548903,Guest,2005-06-07 15:29:00,0,"All good questions NWO, unfortunately no verifiable answers will probably come from it. Often wondered what the impact would be at hitting a rock at 25 to 30 mph, wouldn't have quessed that it would be severe enough to eject everyone from the vessel though. I also don't quite get why the onus would be on the Coast Guard to mark these rocks on Wabigoon, one could imagine there would be liability in starting a precedent like that. Nevertheless, whatever the details, a very sad event indeed."
548904,Guest,2005-06-07 16:35:00,0,"A very unfortunate thing to happen to two young men who are likely leaving a young family behind. My regrets to the family as well as the establishment at which they stayed......I know the people there and it will be hard for them as well. Just my observations from years on lakes and in the tourism business.....this may be unrelated to the two individuals but seems to be a valid point. As we seem to want to provide tourists bigger and ""better"" boats and motors I have seen the change from the basic 20hp / 16' fishing boat move towards the 17-18' deluxe boat with a standard 40 hp on the back. I often wonder if the ""once a year' fisherman is totally aware of the problems that you can put yourself into on the water. Not sure what the answer is but only wish tragedies such as this one did not occur."
548905,dewyg,2005-06-07 16:52:00,1006,"The water is not that cold, I was fishing LOTW last week and jumped in and swam around in the middle of the lake. I believe other factors had to be at play in this incident."
548908,Guest,2005-06-07 19:10:00,0,"about the same thing happened on stockton lake in mo. couple years ago. two guys in a bass boat came around a point wide open and hit a wake off a cruser. jumped one wave t-boned the next, broke boat into threw both out one had jacket other did not. only thing holding motor on was wires and cables. one with jacket made it the other did not life jackets and seat belts save lives USE THEM pedad"
548912,Guest,2005-06-07 20:28:00,0,"I know some guys who hit a rock on LOTW two years ago. Flipped the boat and threw all three into the water. All were wearing life jackets and had another boat with them. All were fine, just a little shaken up but you can tear a boat up and get tossed into the water with enough speed."
