6362084,Tkjlmv,2019-10-01 14:45:00,4,We have been with Air Tamarac to the Gouin a few times. East & West Sarrana and Plamondon Bay but never Mattawa. We were just to Plamondon in August. You can PM with any questions I can help with but no help on Mattawa itself.

6362280,Tkjlmv,2019-10-02 12:50:00,4,We went in 2013 in August. Air Tamarac did not have topo maps at that time. They do now. Here is my map from then and where we caught walleye. Definitely found in other places but this was were we did better.

6364598,Andre (wallyandre),2019-10-13 10:24:00,2274,"Another nice map to get some details informations is the one that the AFC of the Gouin produce; you got the name & location of all the outfitters, the protected area, points of interests etc... They were suppose to translate it but I think it's not done yet but if you need any help I can help you out on this.https://www.afcgouin.ca/project/landmark-cliffs/"
