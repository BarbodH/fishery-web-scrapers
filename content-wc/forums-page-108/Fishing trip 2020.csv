6368220,fldoc1,2019-11-02 12:57:00,69,"I always enjoy reading posts about others recommendations and experiences. I have been going to Manitoba and mostly Ontario fishing for 15 or so years now. I am 73 and over the years our group has changed. Some have passed on, and are keeping on eye on us from above. As our group has changed we have tried different lakes for different reasons. I will add it is always special to take your son or grandson on such trips. As our group has matured we are dealing more with health issues. Because of that and because some of our group love to cast for northens we have been going to a lake called Little Vermillion which is a short flight north of Red Lake, Ontario. Most lakes in Ontario have vg walleye fishing. What we were looking for is a lake that had eater walleyes that were catchable and more importantly the lake had big norhterns that were catchable.We settled on Sportsman's Lodge on Little Vermillion which we have gone to the past 2 years. This is the only place we have flown into. The cost has been a $1000 for the week and we have gone in mid-July and had great success. The owner is great, it is the only lodge on the lake, the lake is not huge nor deep, and one has a great chance of catching their lifetime biggest northern. We have gone 2 years in a row and have caught many over 33"" and 3 at 39 and one at 41. When I was recently searching for lakes that that had walleyes along with a great chance at catching lifetime northerns I ended up in touch with Goldern Eagle. He posted on this thread and has been going to Sportsman's Lodge on Little Vermillion for most of his life. If you are still looking for options I would pm Golden Eagle. There are other great recommendations on this thread some that I will follow up on. My wife and I go to Morson (Ontario) and fish Lake of the Woods in early June every year. We started out fishing close to camp and have expanded our range as we have gotten to know the lake so one can't rule out the larger lakes. One post on this thread talked about Obabicon, and we have visited the camp, talked with the fishing knowledgeable owner and would recommend the camp. My wife likes the idea of not cooking. Another thought is that some drive to camps have nearby smaller outpost lakes that have great fishing. Sometimes they have a cache of boats on their outpost lakes or they will trailer their boat for you. Walleye Central has a great group of posters. I always appreciated getting in contact with any of them. I have had great phone conversations with Mike Borger and would recommend talking with him as he has a wealth of experience fishing Ontario. We are not lake trout fisherman so have favored darkwater lakes vs. deep clear lakes.My new search is Alaska. I turned down a teaching offer when fresh out of college and always wanted to go there so started a search a few years ago. So good luck with your search."
6369320,Walleye Fishing Guy,2019-11-07 08:36:00,12,"I have been to Lac Suel Outposts on Chamberlin Narrows. Nice boat ride into the camp, equipment in good shape and fishing has never disappointed. Easy to get a cabin for 2 especially if you avoid June. I like going in July or August when the weather has settled down more anyhow. https://www.lacseuloutposts.com/"
6369348,Walleye2242,2019-11-07 14:37:00,263,on a reccomendation from a fellow walleye central member I booked a trip to Holinshead Lake in august. Might be a solo trip but thats just fine with me. Looking forward to exploring a new area and lake.

6363640,fishmanric,2019-10-09 05:07:00,219,"I started taking my son on Canadian trips when he was nine. Like someone else mentioned, there were a few rough patches but a million more memories were made. Now he has a son and has already been to Canada twice. The theme is always the same, can't wait for the next one. You might to research a houseboat trip as another means of hooking up with a group. They are a total blast including the rides up and back. It's funny what happens to kids over time after a number of trips to the northland. This is my son now with his own boat. I believe he learned well."
6363830,Slim03,2019-10-09 18:45:00,159,"I started taking my son at 9 with my dad and I. This past year he went on the guys trip. Even on the worst days of fishing just seeing the enjoyment through his eyes are some of the best trips that I have ever had. Not all trips are without challenges of keeping them engaged but he does really well and time away from electronics is good as he knows once we get to International Falls everything gets shut off. I’ve found that giving my son a responsibility of something he is in charge of makes him feel really important and like one of the guys. Packing the cooler, getting bait, fire at shore lunch, just simple things that helps contribute that makes him feel like a big deal. He will be 12 next year and already have one trip to Canada planned and he will probably going on a second with me to Canada as well. Needless to say he’s hooked for life and I enjoy it more than he does. Plus when I tell the wife I’m taking our son fishing she really can’t say no."

6364074,eyecatcher1,2019-10-10 12:20:00,323,Check out Red Pine Lodge in Sioux Lookout. I'm pretty sure that John would take you and your son. www.fishredpine.com
6364232,Mike Borger,2019-10-11 07:31:00,1554,"Hi Dave, if it's within your budget and would like to experience something truly exceptional it would be great if you and your son could join us at Gangler's Bain Lake camp next summer in far northern Manitoba! I'll be there with my son again next year and can say from experience it's going to be an incredible trip! Two 8 day trips are available, July 30-August 7, and August 7-15.Our trip there last summer was amazing and with the knowledge I gained next year is going to be even better!https://www.canadafishingguide.net/c...-hosted-trips/"

6364288,Mike Borger,2019-10-11 10:19:00,1554,"Expensive, but not quite that much, Gangler is NOT providing hookers. Fishing trips are pretty much like anything else in life, you tend to get what you pay for. That type of far north bucket list type of trip comes at a price."
6349458,emma17,2019-08-12 14:35:00,436,"Dave, I wish you the best in your plans with your son. Making the decision to take my two sons to Canada 10 years ago is one of the best things I've ever done in strengthening our relationship. We've now gone 9 out of 10 years and, at the ages of 22 and 23, they still can't wait to go again- every year. I was (and maybe am) in a position like yours looking for a group. In our nine trips, we've had three separate groups join us. One group stayed in the RV and watched videos, they weeded themselves out. I'd be surprised if we didn't do a return trip with the other two in the future. I do know it's hard to build that dedicated, every-year group though. None of my local friends have a fishing boat, while we are fortunate to have one. My sons and I decided on a drive-to lake this year that doesn't rent boats. We had one of our best experiences to date and want to go back, but... it would be just us again. If you pick up a boat, you're welcome to join us next June. Anyway, I can make one recommendation. American Plan places like Witch Bay and Obabikon provide an environment very conducive to meeting other fishing groups. Witch Bay does a table rotation, so you are meeting other fisher people regularly. We still stay in touch with people we met there, and could easily join with them as an annual group. It's awesome you're doing this with your son. Keep you eyes peeled, ears open and always be willing to talk with others, it will happen."
6349474,Davebramlett,2019-08-12 15:39:00,32,Thank you for the thoughtful email. I do not own a boat and do not see myself getting one as I live in the desert. You have given me some good options and I appreciate it. My son is 15 and I just want a few days with him and no phones/internet. I am 60 and to watch my kids stare at that phone drives me nuts sometimes. Thanks again.
6349490,eyecatcher1,2019-08-12 16:13:00,323,If you would like a great fishing vacation for you and your son give Anderson's Lodge in Sioux Lookout a try. My wife and I started there 27 years ago and these people are fantastic! They do both American Plan and Housekeeping as well as fly-ins. They are first class and will take very good care of you. I can't see anyone doing it better. http://andersonslodge.com/
6349562,Golden Eagle,2019-08-12 20:12:00,2642,That's exactly what I wanted to hear. I can help. Fly in or drive in. Plenty of huge pike and tons of walleyes. No problem with party of 2 beginning around July 10 until beginning of school. I've been burned before and tend to be cautious.

Don't run a lodge, never have and never will, but have fished a bunch of them. Just mentioning that I know where a party of 2 would be welcome, fit in and be able to exchange information with lots of friendly guests, plus lodge owner/family. I'm thinking mostly from around July 10 to beginning of school for a party of 2. Finding an outpost that will book a party of 2 sometimes becomes available when there's a hole in the flight schedule, that comes between 2 larger parties. A lot of people have helped me over a long span of time and I've always been willing to help others, especially couples and parents fishing with children. Since I'm being mentioned as running a lodge, I'll bow out of this thread. Don't want to upset anyone...... Bye"
6349652,MrSimon,2019-08-13 08:11:00,922,"My advice to Dave: 1. Don't go with strangers. This is too big a trip to roll the dice on the personality dynamic. Either find friends/family you like to go with you, or just go by yourselves. You'd be fine. 2. Fly in. If you are coming all the way from Arizona then go all in. It will cost more, but it's worth it. 3. Go to a fly-in lodge with an American plan. That way you don't have to worry about food/supplies, there will be other folks around to provide camaraderie, and the outfitter will set you up with a nice boat, bait, fishing locations, and a guide if you want one. Plus, fly-in lodges have no problem with a group of 2. Granted, a fly-in American plan lodge will be very expensive. If you aren't prepared to spend that kind of money, then there are plenty of fantastic American plan drive-to lodges on Lac Seul."
6349694,UPnorth3,2019-08-13 09:39:00,22,A previous poster mentioned Clarks Outfitters. I second that opinion. Just got back from a trip with Clarks on Snelgrove lake. Clarks had about a dozen fly-in options for a party of two. Been to a handful of fly-in/drive-to canadian fishing trips. All but one trip was just my dad and I. Only trip with more than a party of two included two lifelong friends. The camaraderie of a larger party was great. But it can be frustrating dividing chores and such.

6349340,eyecatcher1,2019-08-12 07:34:00,323,Check out Red Pine Lodge in Sioux Lookout. I stay there in the cabins but they also do fly-ins. I think that John is flexible and will cater to any size group. www.fishredpine.com

6349382,HeHooksHimself,2019-08-12 09:13:00,725,"Dave, while I usually go in the spring to a boat in camp with a group of 4-6, My BIL and I go every fall just the two of us. X2 with Mattice. We went to Luella Lake with them and had a great time. We have also flown in with Thunderhook right next door to Mattice and had a good experience. Check out the outfitters based in Nakina. All or almost all use Nakina Airways for transport and there is a great selection of lakes. We used Twin Lakes Outfitters and found them the be surprisingly affordable and quick to accommodate the party for the best experience. It might be great to just keep it to you and your son in order to avoid any potential drama living with strangers for a week. Just my opinion. Fish On! Hooks"
6349400,kona77,2019-08-12 10:15:00,236,Dave; I can't help you on hooking up with another group for 2020 but I can recommend Clarks Resorts or Loon Haunt as two very good outfitters we have dealt with that will take a group of two.. Loon Haunt even has a lake specifically (Porrier) set-up for your type of situation. As others have mentioned sometimes guys come on this site to look for additional guys.Best of luck on your search..
6349414,Golden Eagle,2019-08-12 10:50:00,2642,"Asking if you've previously fished NW Ontario for pike and walleyes. What will you do with a 44"" pike?"
6349430,MN_Moose,2019-08-12 12:31:00,964,Just a thought of mine. You might want to check out Mike Berger posts on here. He takes his teenage son on fly in trips and is very experienced. He has even invited others to join him in the past. If nothing else just reading and experiencing his stories will give you great insight on what a trip entails. His recent trip report of a boat motor conking out a rowing back to the cabin with make shift oars is quite a harrowing experience https://www.canadafishingguide.net/ He has great videos as well
6349440,Davebramlett,2019-08-12 13:41:00,32,Thanks for the input. I read his story and watched his video. looks like a great trip
6349442,Davebramlett,2019-08-12 13:42:00,32,I did 3-4 flyin trips back in the mid-80s and caught some very nice Pike. I will catch his butt and release him for the next person to enjoy.

6349224,Davebramlett,2019-08-11 19:20:00,32,Will do. Unfortunately I need more than 3-4 weeks notice. Hopefully I can hook up before summer.

6349268,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2019-08-11 22:23:00,240,"Hi--I think you'd be surprised at how many outfitters will cater to smaller groups. For example, mattice lake outfitters, http://www.walleye.ca flew my brother and I in to Auger Lake in May of 2016. Mattice is a well-established, highly reputable outfitter, and you'd have a great time there. But a group of 2 probably wouldn't be able to book during the peak weeks of June; you'd probably need to select one of the off-peak times in May, August, etc. And it's easy to have your beverages and bait flown in ahead of time, too. Good luck with your planning and trip selection!"

Here are some things to ponder:Do you want American or Housekeeping plan?What size body of water are you comfortable fishing?What species of fish do you want to target?What level of service do you want?Do you prefer lakes versus rivers?Do you want numbers of fish versus size?Drive-to vs. boat-to vs. fly-in?Camp atmosphere?Guiding?What type of boat/equipment do you want?Time of the season?I encourage you to consider the above points (and maybe other points as well). Your responses might guide you to a good choice for water and lodges. It's very easy to return to fish in Canada if you wisely select your first vacation!Good fishing and tight lines!!!"
6349186,coldtuna,2019-08-11 16:58:00,25,"I have traveled to Canada with my 14 year old son the last 3 summers. It has been a lot of fun, but with a few bumps here and there. He and I were on a walk this afternoon for an hour talking about our Canada fishing trip plans for next summer. We always just went to a lodge and fished and never traveled with a group. We met people at the lodges some times but it was all good just showing up the two of us. I don't think you need to hook up with a group to make this work. It depends on what you are willing to spend and what you want to catch. One place to start is looking at the All Canada show web page and check out a few of the lodges that present at those shows. You can also just do some random searching on this site and you'll see good and bad reports on lots of places (if you are thinking of going to a particular lodge, look up what people say about that lodge on this site). The Canada Fishing Guide website is also really good with great reports on a bunch of places in Canada. After you know what you want and have a few places in mind, then you might just post here with a few of your possible choices and then you'll get more directed responses. I hope this helps."
6349198,Davebramlett,2019-08-11 17:29:00,32,"Thanks for your response and recommendations. I am leaning towards a flyin trip and have not found an outfitter that caters to just two fisherman without charging for the smaller group. Also, If we could hook up with another group it would really help with bringing in the supplies as we would be flying in from AZ and its hard to pack food/drinks for a week"
6349200,Davebramlett,2019-08-11 17:32:00,32,Thanks for the list of things to consider. I have done several flyin trips many years ago and really enjoyed them. I thought hooking up with a group would help with the supplies but the cost can be better with a larger group.
