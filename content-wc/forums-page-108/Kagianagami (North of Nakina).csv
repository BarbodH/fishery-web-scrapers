I have never been on Kag and any info that anyone can share would be appreciated. I like to cast for Pike but also will fish for walleye, mainly jigging. feel free to IM me."
6364718,onetimedave,2019-10-14 06:26:00,502,"Have not fished ""KAG"" but numerous other lakes in the area. Found Johnson ""Silver"" minnows with a twister tail to be very productive in casting for pike. Time of year you are going is a very good time. Cast into the most slop you can find. Pike will be there."

The Walleye were still migrating into the lake from their spawning sites. I was not expecting that. While there were small numbers of fish on main lake structure, the majority of the fish were concentrated at the inflows, including the one from Van Poele. We slayed fish in there, including some large pike while fishing for Walleye (40"" was the largest).Weather for us was one of the worst I had experienced on any trip. The wind was relentless. It did not stop all week or even at night. It's a rare thing in my experience that the wind howls all night long and never relents. White caps every day. It wasn't so bad that we couldn't fish, but it made for some uncomfortable rides and limited how far we wanted to travel.Van Poele is probably a good spot for Walleye at that time of the year. As with anywhere though, you are at the mercy of the ice out date and spring weather.For Pike, I would target those shallow bays north and south of the Van Poele outflow into Kag. Especially at the south end where the Kag River (?) flows in. That area is shallow and has flooded land. The entire southern bay is <6 feet of water. Perfect place to start looking for pike in the spring. https://binged.it/2OKT7UbAny reason you are not staying at their Kag outpost near Humble Bay? Some nice looking spring pike spots near there as well."
6365012,lionfan19,2019-10-15 08:59:00,41,adempsey-the main reason we are going here is that Twin lakes outfitters has a Sunday turnover day on this outpost. One guy in our group has a son who's high school commencement is Friday so we will not be able to drive to Nakina until Saturday.
6365164,ziggyzag,2019-10-16 00:50:00,125,"We fished Kag last year the first week of June and we stayed with TLO using the Humble Bay cabins. During our stay the fishing was very slow or should I say changeling for the week with that said we did indeed catch some very nice pike and walleye with a few nice lakers in the mix. Our group has also stayed on Van Poele many years ago its not that far out to Kag with the mouth of the river into Kag being a great spot for walleye that time of year. I would also say that Chad and TLO did a great job with the cabins, boats & motors as we have come to expect. I see you are Lions fan man you got to be kidding me about the bad breaks or should I say calls the Lions get almost on a weekly basis!!!!!!!!!! Talk about the Refs swaying the outcome of a game. I defy anyone to watch (3) straight Lions games and not see at least one possible game changing call. And who knows you just might see a call that changes the rules in the NFL been there done that a couple of times in the past few years. KEEP THE FAITH!"
