6366036,luv2huntnfish,2019-10-21 14:06:00,73,Are the results of the 2019 Winnipeg River Greenback Championship posted anywhere? Checked Papertown Inn site and looked at their Facebook site without any success in finding the results. Can someone share the results of the tournament? Also on the results from the Voyagers tournament I am not sure if its the fact that I an not tech savy but the results I have found are presented in a jpeg format that I cannot enlarge thus making them impossible for me to read. If anyone can share the results in a more readable format it would be much appreciated. Looking for a complete angler listing with results in available anywhere. Thanks in advance.
