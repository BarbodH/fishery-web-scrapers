Grown fond of fishing arctic char in various places throughout Nunavut. It's never just the fishing in these remote and incredible places on the tundra, it's the entire experience that wraps itself around you. Nunavut is a huge and rugged land, where the elements and wildlife can be dangerous and unforgiving, every moment in the outdoors feels bigger! Anyways, this past August I managed to align some stars and find myself camping out alone for five days on the Ekaluk River. A bucketlist destination, the Ekaluk is probably considered one of the top arctic char fisheries any angler might find themselves. Each August runs of 80,000 char return from the salty ocean, fed, strong and silver, heading to freshwater for the winter. Time it right, and it's the fishing dreams are made of. This experience really digs in. Link below. Read on if you like...http://bunksoutdoorangle.com/a-nunav...or-the-ekaluk/Bunk"

You had amazingly different Arctic to hike around, photograph and dream of the schools. Pictures do that great land no justice. You take good pictures - no offense. I'm glad you finally caught a couple they are tasty fish like all their cousins. Thank you for the trip overview."
