The cabins look great, the price is right, the drive to distance is short (Nestor Falls), and, best of all, they will accommodate groups of two. www.canadianflyinoutposts.ca Has anyone flown with this outfitter this past summer?"

Only cabin on the lake, Flush toilet and short drive give it those extra bonus points along with excellent rates.On google maps Upper Frypan Lake appears to be named FourStar Lake.Perhaps try a search for ""FourStar"".Have a great trip and let us know how your experience was.Take careJeff"
