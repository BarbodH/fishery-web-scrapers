6370026,walleye1952,2019-11-10 14:29:00,13,Was called Pauli Light according to the maps I got in Sioux Lookout back in the late 1970's. I see it is called Paul's Light on the newer SE Sectional Map. It is NE of Pine Point and WNW of Taylor island approx. 10 miles by going thru MacLean's Narrows and continuing thru Windy Narrows. Continue WNW approx 4-5 miles.
6370030,eyecatcher1,2019-11-10 14:35:00,323,That's the one that I'm referring to. It's called Pauli Light on the Canadian Legion map that I have too. My first trip up there in 92 a guide that took me there called it Pauli Lt. too.
6370040,Pooch,2019-11-10 15:51:00,4618,"So when we are on Pine Point ""Pauli Light"" is barely visible in the distance looking East'ish? Pooch"
6368914,Pooch,2019-11-05 19:52:00,4618,"Do you fish that area? Seems a long way from any camp, other than maybe SWW. See a few boats in the area, but most are traveling. How did you measure the distance? I used Google earth, but not sure how accurate it is. Thanks for the response. Pooch"
6368916,Sniper1980,2019-11-05 19:58:00,33,Looks like a good crappie spot
6368934,Lmbkiller,2019-11-05 21:11:00,639,Used navionics app to measure. I have fished from the dam down to Vaughn and about everywhere in between
6368978,pjshorthorn,2019-11-06 00:09:00,5654,Molson Canadian. Lac Seul.....of course PjShorthorn
6369024,Pooch,2019-11-06 05:10:00,4618,"It's probably full of ""Crapies""..... Pooch"
6369726,eyecatcher1,2019-11-09 08:48:00,323,Paul's Light?
6369732,Pooch,2019-11-09 09:25:00,4618,"I don't know what or where ""Paul's light"" is? Didn't know the navigation markers had names?One thing of note and most guys who fish LS are aware of is that some of the channel markers were removed several years ago. Several that I'm aware of still have the concrete/rock base at or (depending on water levels) just below the surface. Both have large pieces of metal sticking out of them that would be an absolute boat killer if struck. If you are not aware of them you probably won't see them until it is too late. I've never understood why they were dismantled but never visually marked.Actually, I remember four of these hazards. One in the SE end Steamboat Bay, one between Windigo Island and Pine Island and another North of the Dominions. There might be a fourth NE of Pine Point, but I'm not real sure. I'm betting that there are probably others in areas our group doesn't fish.""Hazards on Lac Seul"" would be a good thread for this winter. When the water level is low most are obvious. At normal pool most are pretty much hidden.On Navionics maps they still show up as a channel marker buoy. So just because you can no longer see them.... avoid the area or be very careful if it is shown on a map. There is a reason it's on the map.Pooch"
6369774,eyecatcher1,2019-11-09 11:40:00,323,"Paul's Light in NE of Pine Island. That's what it's called on the map that I have anyway. I haven't been there in a while, but it used to look similar to the pic that you posted."
6369812,Pooch,2019-11-09 16:05:00,4618,"I've seen a navigation marker that is on a point about where you describe. It is still there and intact, but it is on a necked down area between two larger islands. Same basic design as the one in the photo I originally post above, but not surrounded by water.Didn't know it had a name. Learn something everyday. What map did you use to find a name?There is another same marker on Little Pine island about five to eight miles east of the one in my photo.Pooch"
6369824,eyecatcher1,2019-11-09 16:50:00,323,"It's a map that I bought up there in 1997. Yellow with blue water sections. I think it's on my GPS too, but I'll have to look. All of the lights have names on this map."
6368574,Pooch,2019-11-04 09:02:00,4618,Just a little mind game. Who can identify where this picture was taken last summer? Winner gets a beer if we ever meet. Pooch
6368580,NARDA 1,2019-11-04 09:19:00,636,On Lac Seul. lol I have never been on Lac Seul so this would be my best guess.
6368604,Lmbkiller,2019-11-04 12:30:00,639,About 2.5mi east of windigo pt
6368660,tly,2019-11-04 15:27:00,1900,"Know lots of places it isn't. No veteran tribute markers, no gull doodoo and not on a rocky pine point. Must be in central/west end."
6368704,bigwalleye1,2019-11-04 18:59:00,2632,"Seen a number of them, but never that one. I think it's further west than my normal travels."
6368710,Blue Lk,2019-11-04 19:53:00,269,"it's been years since I was there,but I'll guess Paulie (sp?) light"
6368716,Aspencreek,2019-11-04 21:10:00,2911,"I'm guessing east of Windigo Pt because that's about as far east as I get, no need to go much further. There is some really big water that direction and it has to be sitting on (obviously) one of those rock outcroppings in that big water. Looks like a good spot to drift and Jig too."
6368730,pjshorthorn,2019-11-05 04:18:00,5654,I'm guessing it may be the navigational light around Dominion Island. 2nd guess would be around Little Pine Island. PjShorthorn
6368760,Pooch,2019-11-05 06:28:00,4618,"About two miles west of Dominion Islands, or about fifteen to eighteen miles east of Manitoba Point. Caught a couple average size smallies throwing plugs at the rocks. Fairly deep water around the marker and a couple ""surprise"" boulders just under the surface in deep water near the main rock. What kind of beer and where? Pooch"
6368904,Lmbkiller,2019-11-05 18:53:00,639,A measured 12.2 nm ese of Manitoba pt to be fairly exact
