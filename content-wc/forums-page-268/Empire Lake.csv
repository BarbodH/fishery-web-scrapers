4032465,centralstater,2015-07-08 20:42:00,20,It is just two of going in one vehicle. Camper on truck and pulling the boat. We used to drag it in by hand but getting too old for that. The trail was pretty much grown over and under water. Maybe it was just a really wet year.

I was a kid when we started fishing empire, it was down the creek with the 14 footer, and we left the boat there. I remember the operator letting me play with the controls of the earth moving machine for road building. At that point , this was as far as the road went. I was fortunate enough to being able to fish the lakes as soon as the roads were built into them. And my fathers friend had a super cub and camp on graham lake. The good old days. But on another note, basically no one fishes the graham area anymore. High fuel costs etc. Si fishing is very good in most lakes. I remember one day on empire, we had 2 boats in the lake, we came out for lunch, went back for the evening fishing. Upon return there was only 1 boat there, an airplane had obviously landed, loaded a boat and took off. It was 4 in the boat that night."

We had 2 kids about 10 and 12 with us. All we had was a 6hp Johnson pushing us around. It would literally take us over a half and hour to get back to camp and the lake isn't that big. There was a steady rain the last evening we were there but the walleyes were hungry and our kids did not want to stop. It was totally dark by the time we got back but man what an awesome memory. THe kids, who are married for many years already, still talk about that. Thanks for reminding me of that. For some reason we never caught many big fish on the lake or many northerns for that matter, but when the bite was on you could catch hundreds of them."
