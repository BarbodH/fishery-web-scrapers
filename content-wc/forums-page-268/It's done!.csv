It was a great trip on a amazing lake with great hosts and equipment. It's getting harder to figure out how to edit it all together as everyone had at least 2 cams..enjoy!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFLL...ature=youtu.be"

4031633,Pikeslayer8,2015-07-08 14:21:00,1460,Great trip you guys had! Excellent garage! Excellent video! Excellent fish releases! Excellent menu! The little walleye posturing photos were hilarious and the food you guys made looked awesome. Blueberry Chimis and the stuffed French Toast ideas may get borrowed as well as the Walleye Artichoke dip............. I'm not sold on the Orange Walleye over rice dish though it did look really good. Well done!
4032329,Erie Ranger620,2015-07-08 19:48:00,74,Well better chime in here that's my bros video combining all pics and vids works great lots of footage to work with and Nathan works hard on them. Great trip lots of nice walleyes broke my new Ranger in properly had 8 hrs on her when we got there. Let me tell you something about my brother he can flat out cook it's really unbelievable the orange walleye really has no equal and I was skeptical at first. OS rocks first rate outfitter and nice people provides minnows in huge numbers still had some left even after 100 fish. I have all past trips to OS and my trips to Lake Erie on my blog walleyewarrior.blogspot.com yes that's my shop a ton of planning and work to make that happen still grin ever time I walk in there blessed for sure. Good luck you all! love hearing of others trips to the shield someday will spend a month every year up there.

My guess is the bigger pike go deep in June when we are there. I did troll the edges of the weed beds one year and stuck a 32"". Yes you can get to the Superb Rapids and any other part of the Lake with a 17 footer. My brother had the new Ranger and didn't have any issue at all, most of the major rocks and reefs are marked. I am very blessed this year as I have a second trip scheduled, taking the wife and niece back up in 2 weeks! I feel another video coming on....Just for the record the garage and boat are my brothers, and yes it is quite spectacular."
