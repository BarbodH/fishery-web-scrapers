3975914,chris.brock,2015-06-17 16:43:00,112,"Very cool Rick! Sounds like a great trip. Since I was fishing the same week, I'm curious how and where you guys found the walleye? If you haven't been, I think you guys would like Martin's new camp on Little Miss. for next year."
3976322,RickOnt,2015-06-17 19:31:00,217,"Thanks Pete It was a good trip for sure!!! Chris we caught Walleye Casting,Trolling and Jigging. Jigging is my favorite, 16 FOW Jigging in the evening likely produced the best However one tactic that was lethal on the smaller Walleye was on days with blue bird skies and glass smooth water when the points and shoals that produced so well in the evening were slow We moved deeper into 32FOw and vertical jigged with a worm, It was like ice fishing for Perch there were loads of fish and you could barely get the jig to the bottom without having a bite."

4029193,RickOnt,2015-07-07 17:24:00,217,"Yes!! For sure some areas were much better than others!! We did fish, Malmo Lake, the portage lake to the south, You have a PM"
