Most fish are good size. Pike: Run on the small side (biggest we've ever boated was a 33""). Cast cranks in the main lake rocky points and drop-offs, cast spinnerbaits in the weedy bays and shoreline. Our record is 13 fish on consecutive casts. Had 3 following the same bait! Whitefish: We've never targeted them, but they are good size and great numbers. July can be a tough bite, but if you get the right weather (leading into a storm) it can be awesome."
