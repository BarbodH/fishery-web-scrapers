Remodeled a couple years ago, clean & kept up well. Not the cheapest by far, but nice & has a well lit parking lot for those of us with boats & gear to worry about.Fish"

If you're heading east on 17 out of the Soo, check out Pino's Italian grocery store on the east side of town (on the south side of the road)....it's a large grocery store with excellent quality food, fresh produce, etc. We always make a stop there before heading out of the Soo on the way to camp.
