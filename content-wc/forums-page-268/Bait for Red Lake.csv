4027433,stevensinks,2015-07-07 07:27:00,330,Next week I will be going east from Winnipeg then north to Red Lake. What is the best place along the way to get good bait this year?
4027497,wallydave,2015-07-07 07:51:00,2151,"Eagle Falls Lodge recommends Red Lake Marine for bait, I have fished out of Black Bear Lodge on Red Lake in August jig and minnow have worked well. Good luck.Post a report when you return home."
4030209,stevensinks,2015-07-08 06:42:00,330,Red Lake Marine would be easy and I could pick it up just before the boat from Bow Narrows picks us up. Are you going back to Black Bear this year? Our trip to Bow Narrows is always good. My wife and I both love it up there. Some years the fishing is better than others but its still always good.

Plus my 35 th anniversary is this year so that trip is my focus this year. Next year hopefully last years group can go back to BBL! Have a great trip!"

Should we be nervous with the fishing in Aug? Donald is a 100 fish per day lake. Should we expect the same numbers in Aug? I've heard the fish are deeper in late summer. Perhaps not schooled up. I guess we'll see."

Fish structure and you willnbe ok! The August perm's are more stable weather, bugs only a problem at night, one other plus is the chance to see Northern Lights! Have a great trip!"
