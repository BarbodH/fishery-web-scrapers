4031857,youngknight,2015-07-08 16:08:00,228,"I had emailed Mike Borger with a question about an outfitter looking for a good and affordable spot for a fly-in fishing trip for just my son and I. He found me a few options and I went with Buck Lake cabins out of Hornpayne. Mike spent a lot of time on the phone with me going over maps and best spots but assured me it would be a great trip and he was right. Great facilities, wonderful hosts (Shannon, John and family - I mean, they even dropped off a loaf of homemade bread to our cabin halfway through the week and we were there for Canada day and John treated everyone to an impressive fireworks display). They have a lunch spot on a small island where they put on a very impressive shore lunch for everyone. I have seen many a shore lunch on fishing programs on TV...I have not seen as impressive a spread that the Moffat family put on for the guests. Boats were great, choice between the standard 14 foot with 4 stroke Yamaha 15hp or the 16 flat floor Mirrorcraft with 25 hp 4 strokes - mainly Nissan (Tohatsu). Cleaned out every day and filled with gas. All of this at a regular rate that rivals many drive to facilities I see advertised. BTW, they do a midweek house-cleaning. As for the fishing...well, it is a large lake with many promising spots (2 lakes given it is connected to Granite Hill Lake down a 2 mile winding river)...I am no more than an average angler when it comes to walleye and we struggled a few times but always caught fish and certainly had some sessions that were quite good...no 60 fish days for us, but to be fair, we enjoyed our trip exploring lots of nooks and crannies, taking in the wildlife and enjoying father-son time at camp as well. Also, mayfly hatch was on...in places lots and lots of exoskeletons in the water. A large group from Indiana were there...they have been coming for years...they had some slow days as well but some fantastic days as well. I loved that the average walleye was between 18 and 21 inches it seemed...beautiful chunky, solid and strong fish...our biggest was 25 inches. So, thanks to Mike Borger for putting this together for us and thanks to the Moffat family for their hospitality. Also, Forde Lake Air Services were great to deal with and we rented a mobile home from them the night before the fly-in maybe a mile away from the base (which is being moved to that site anyhow in the coming weeks)."
4031921,fishron,2015-07-08 16:35:00,317,100 fish walleye days pale in comparison to the trip you described. The overall experience is what's it all about. Sounds like you had a great one.
4032081,adempsey,2015-07-08 18:01:00,963,Definitely a top notch operation. Sound like a good trip. Did you manage to fish that drop off southwest of Eagle Island??

4033393,youngknight,2015-07-09 08:40:00,228,"Yeah Adam we did...and thanks for those depth maps you sent me. We did catch some nice walleyes there, fished there when the wind was come from the south so windward side...fish were all chunky 21-22 inch but didn't get into numbers. Boat control was a little challenging...pretty windy on the main lake most days so fishing the windward side it was tough...anchor wouldn't even hold...fish were generally in close to shore in 8-12 feet of water so not much room for error with waves pushing into the rocks."
