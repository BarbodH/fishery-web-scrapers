His wife has some health issues that will never improve, but are not life threatening by any means at this point. It will be important to him to at least call her each day to check in and see how she is feeling. Since we will have cell service, we are going to add International data to our Iphone so he can check in for a few minutes every day. The cost for a month is $40.00 through our Verizon plan and gets you 100 minutes of talk time + 100 text messages. If he doesn't use it all on the trip, I'm sure my son will figure out a way to burn up the rest of the data Just another option to consider if you will have cell service on a trip and need to stay connected with home. Although my wife will have the phone number to the lodge, I think she is looking forward to not hearing from me for over a week. What's up with that ???? PjShorthorn"
4028641,forgop,2015-07-07 14:04:00,880,"The above mentioned short text messages is a difference maker. Sending long texts takes much longer and eats more battery. I brought 6 sets of rechargeable AA's. The manual recommended a specific type of battery and that's what I'd use from now on. The rechargeable AA's I brought (full charges, highest rated I could find), must not have been as strong as they recommended because they showed low from the get go. No way could I have left the thing on for hours on end and had any juice left at the end of the week."
4022762,1K1MOA,2015-07-05 09:50:00,90,"Today was suppose to be my travel day to Nakina. I was being flown in solo to an outpost camp on Tuesday for a week. Brad from 7 Lakes Wilderness Camps was going to send in a sat phone in case of an emergency. 72 hours before I was being flown in I had a kidney stone block my ureter going into my bladder. Fortunately I was still at home. I was taken to the emergency room and couldn't even walk into the hospital I was in so much pain. They did a Cat scan, saw the problem and scheduled surgery immediately. The urologist couldn't remove the stone due to size and had to blast it with a laser and it will be coming out in pieces for the next couple of weeks. He also put a stint between my kidney and bladder that will be in for a week or so.Why the background? If this had happened while at the outpost, even with the sat phone, it would have been a disaster. Talking with Brad yesterday, he said they would have had to get a plane in there and then probably medivac'd by helicopter from Nakina to a hospital. If I didn't have a sat phone with, I could have been like that for possibly a week. When I told the doctor my plans, he said that if I wasn't able to get out quickly to a hospital, I would have been so septic from the blockage I probably would have died.I am telling this story to make sure anyone going in realizes a surprise can occur that could be devastating if you don't have communication capabilities like a SPOT or sat phone. I am a healthy 55 yr old male who has spent a week at a time on solo hiking and fishing trips throughout my life. I will never again go out without a SPOT, InReach or sat phone device again with me.I am going to find a companion to go and hopefully get the trip rescheduled for September assuming I heal up well and the cat scan shows everything is gone. I am so thankful it happened before I left! An answer to prayer!DON'T GO TO AN OUTPOST WITHOUT COMMUNICATION CAPABILITIES!!!!"
4023082,Bob_Loblaw,2015-07-05 12:44:00,109,"Some of the great adventures are to places with no communications capabilities. It's great to have access to a sat phone, but nobody who is in good health needs to live in fear that the grim reaper is just around the next corner...that's no way to live, IMO. Glad to hear that you're OK!"
4023186,1K1MOA,2015-07-05 14:13:00,90,"It's not about fearing the grim reaper, if I did I wouldn't have had all the adventures I have had in my life. It is about being prepared. I prepare to go into the wilderness so if adverse situations appear, I can deal with them. That is why I carry a first aid kit, clot bandage, compass, fire flint, etc. etc. Realizing what almost happened to me, I believe the expense of a couple hundred dollars for a sat text communicator, if a sat phone isn't available, is just good preparation. People have saved their lives by having the right things with them in wilderness settings. I am simply stating that there can be cases where the thing that could save your life is the ability to communicate. If the outfitter wasn't planning on sending in a sat phone, I would not have had communications with me and could have been toast because of it. This has taught me the lesson that preparedness includes the ability to communicate. Just sharing that with others who may be considering what preparedness means, should be thinking about ability to communicate when spending a week in the wilderness."
4023210,polaris-pete,2015-07-05 14:31:00,343,"I do not think anyone who is in poor health would chance a fly-in, especially by himself. Accidents can and do occur and in good sense either take advantage of an Outfitters Sat phone which we used to do until we got the INRACH which paid for itself last year.We also take out a Medi-Vac insurance policy with Medical coverage for the week for $24.Better safe than sorry."

4023594,Mike Borger,2015-07-05 18:21:00,1554,"Your post is right on the money. Some type of communication device is just a smart idea.I'm a huge fan of the Delorme inReach, in fact I couldn't function without it the number of times I'm off the grid.Glad to hear luck was on your side recently."
4024578,forgop,2015-07-06 07:15:00,880,"Exactly this. Get the benefit of staying in touch back home without all the chatter that quickly adds up minutes on your sat phone. For the price of a one week sat phone rental, you can buy a used Delorne inReach device. Under their plan, you can go month to month, but essentially you can get an unlimited text plan for a month and the annual fee for about $90 on top of that. They offer insurance for their SOS as well should you want the extra protection of getting evacuated for an emergency instead of relying on an extra charge for an early flight (easily in the neighborhood of $500) and then having to rely on an ambulance to get you anywhere in a timely fashion.But Mike also has the hook up on a good deal on new devices that will save you money on the life of the device for the plan."
4024810,green&orange,2015-07-06 08:40:00,28,"Can someone give me a quick synopsis of how the Delorme inReach works? I'm talking costs. My impression is that you buy the unit for around $300 then pay a monthly service charge and a yearly subscription fee - is this correct? How much is the monthly charge? I'd be interested in something like that, but I would like to find out more information as far as total yearly costs.I currently rent a sat phone for a week and it is roughly $112 with free incoming text and calls and $1.50 per outgoing text. Thanks."
4024890,Mike Borger,2015-07-06 09:05:00,1554,"You're correct, you buy the unit then pay a subscription fee, although it's not yearly. When you're not using they allow u to put in sleep mode for something like 4 bucks a month. Then you can reactivate it with no extra fees.I'm in Canada so our prices are different from yours but I know it's way cheaper than a sat phone.Ironically enough I just published my review on this product last month if you are anyone else is interested:http://www.canadafishingguide.net/gear-reviews/"
4027153,Skywagon,2015-07-07 06:07:00,1106,"I have a friend who has been using a Delorme Inreach for over a month now from an outpost cabin here in Canada, it has been working flawlessly. The downside is the text message must be kept short and the keyboard is small, but it does send and receive messages well, as long as it can get a clear view of the sky. I feel confident that if he does have a minor emergency, the signal will get out and I can fly in to get him, if something major happens he can hit the help button and emergency services will be in there right away to pick him out (the message sent shows the exact GPS position of the Inreach unit). We had poor results with a Spot unit a few years ago and I had to make an unnecessary trip out to the bush to check on a fellow when he missed 3 in a row of his pre-scheduled OK signals to me. The Spot device uses a different Sat system (Global Star) as opposed to the Inreach that uses Iridium. I would rate 4 1/2 stars for the Inreach, 3 stars for the Spot. If my life being depended on one of these units it would be the Inreach hands down, the lesser price of the Spot would not even enter in the equation if it is being used in Canada. I have the Iridium phone for the same reason."
