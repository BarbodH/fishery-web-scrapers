4030009,TIGHTLINER,2015-07-08 05:33:00,223,Try searching WC posts and threads for info on this outfitter. Have read some interesting posts on here. I did talk with a guy that went there in the spring of probably 2005 and was very happy with the fishing weather was not good but you can not change mother nature.

4030697,Mr Ranger,2015-07-08 08:47:00,272,"I have never been to OS in September but would love to one year. We have been going up the end of June for 11 years. We are good friends with ""Live to Jig"" guy who made the video and can attest to its validity. This past trip was awesome. As you can see from the weather it was great along with the scenery. We did have one day that we only caught a few fish but it was like 85 degrees and NO wind whatsoever. Rest of the days however were out of control. I am not into counting numbers but can tell you most days the minnows and crawlers were almost gone screamed like a girl when I washed my hands from all the teeth marks. Bob and Shelly are wonderful hosts and run a very clean camp. It is a huge body of water and it is all good at any given time. Don't overlook the Lake Trout and think in the fall they up shallow again. I got a fat 27"" Lake Trout on our trip. It was fat because it had a 12"" walleye in its gut! Like any other fishery you need to do some research on the water and mix it up. Jigging, bottom bouncers and crank baits all catch fish. You will have a good time and hope you can share your experience. Enjoy"
