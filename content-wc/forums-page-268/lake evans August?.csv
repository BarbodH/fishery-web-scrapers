4025506,hugepike0,2015-07-06 13:07:00,28,Anyone fished lake Evans (bushland adventures) in August - I have been on a few august trips that were very poor but I have heard evans has good pike fishing in big cabbage beds in early to mid august. Anyone??

I have previously fished with Bushland at Kamwak and Clarkie. While each persons experience is different, I was never charged for a camp caretaker but was asked to provide a tip based on their help about the camp. As someone who recognizes that they are up there in the bush for most of the summer, I offer to bring up needed replenishments of desired groceries, etc which does foster a better relationship in camp all around. I have not been disappointed yet. Talking to Jim, the ice out on the lakes was late this year and the water levels are at record highs....the biggest pike of the season so far is 52""....I am looking forward to another Quebec adventure! PM if you need more."
4029209,phishfearme,2015-07-07 17:34:00,1242,"the cost of the manager is in the bill - tip is extra. you pay for him. a week there is about $2400 without travel and tips, etc. quite high for a one week housekeeping cabin (almost $350 per night each). the manager get something out of that. we plan meal ""tight"" in order to avoid weight problems on flights. we invited our manager to join us the first night then he showed up every night thereafter. dinners were a bit ""tight"" also. it was hard for us to drop hints in French. phish"

I have been to camps from Reed, Cranberry Portage and Lac Seul in the west and numerous camps in the Central/Eastern portion of Ontario, each have their own benefits and drawbacks. Bushland and the three lakes I have gone to are not the cheapest but I have had great personal success there and my sons and friends always work hard to return knowing what is easily in the realm of the possible for a new personal best. Bottom line...it is your vacation and dollar, spend both as YOU see fit."
