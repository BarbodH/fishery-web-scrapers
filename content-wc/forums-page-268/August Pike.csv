4025842,hugepike0,2015-07-06 15:38:00,28,Hello - thinking of taking a trip 2nd week of august for pike northern quebec (up by hudson bay). anyone fished up north that time of year. worried the pike will be super deep and not even in deeper cabbage beds. any thoughts or previous experience appreciated!

4025874,hugepike0,2015-07-06 15:46:00,28,"where do you go, and if you dont mind my asking what lures work best. are you talking really deep or maybe weedbeds in 10-15 feet water?"
4025914,Kansas Bound,2015-07-06 15:56:00,152,"We go about 12 hours north of Winnipeg. The weed beds are in about 10-15 deep water and maybe come to about 3 ft below the surface. We have good luck on the traditional baits, spoons, jerkbaits, spinners. Basically any lure you can keep at the top of the weeds."
4028553,brochet,2015-07-07 13:35:00,88,it depends how far north.u cant fish above the 52nd parallel without an outfitter.if your going around the 50 the water remains cold especially in deeper lakes.my 40+years of pike fishing tells me they should not be deeper than 15'.
