I've never stayed at either Tetu Lodge nor Caribou Falls Lodge which is just up river, but I've fished the area many times. Fishing is always good, but there's often a lot of competition with other lodges (KCR, Caribou Falls, and even two lodges that come in from Manitoba, so you're often sharing spots. My parents and two others fished the area in late June and had one of their best years ever. No big fish, other than one 44"" pike, but non-stop walleye action."
