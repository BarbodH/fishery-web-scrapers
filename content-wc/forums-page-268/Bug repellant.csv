4028201,cuamb,2015-07-07 11:15:00,203,All the repellents listed contain a certain percentage of DEET. That has worked for me in the past for everything but the black flies. I have not found anything for those.
4028689,btmbncr,2015-07-07 14:11:00,492,Repel Insect repellent has worked wonders.My all time favorite is White Mountain Insect RepellentBill
4029785,Aspencreek,2015-07-07 21:53:00,2911,"I have tried all of the above except the Sawyer's (may need to try that one) but a combination of a thermocell and ""Bull Frog"" (it's a insect repellant and sun screen in one) seemed to do the trick last trip.Best thing for those black Flies........NO NORTHERN in the boat, boatside release only!! That slime attracts them from miles around."

4035073,youngknight,2015-07-09 21:42:00,228,"I work a lot in the forest and prefer aerosol spray with as high as deep as possible in that format. I keep an old shirt and cap dedicated to bush work each year and spray those often. A gentle mist on back of neck and hands every couple hrs I find is more than enough...often, just spraying clothes is all I need. I did listen to an radio program with some experts and they insisted that you should totally avoid the sunblock/repellent combo. Sunscreen is meant to be absorbed into the upper layer of skin while repellent should not be absorbed. The combo results in repellent being drawn into your body...not a desirable thing. At least that's what the panel of experts are saying. I stayed at buck lake cabins last week which is located on a peninsula...neither my son nor I used repellent once...only wished I had it on after 11pm...then I wasn't outside much anyhow."

4024842,Bstar,2015-07-06 08:49:00,564,Sawyer Maxi Deet
4025050,forgop,2015-07-06 09:44:00,880,"Three weeks ago I used 2 different cans of Off, Coppertone Sport, and a Thermacell. I found September to be more effective than any of the above."
4025082,Draco1206,2015-07-06 09:57:00,175,"If the bugs are as bad as they were at Windsor Lake last week, I would recommend something with 100% deet like Muskcol. I had Deep Woods Off and I think it's 26 or 29% deet and after 20 or 30 minutes they didn't respect the deet anymore. I hate using deet but had to and I would recommend bringing a head net."
4025209,tv4fish,2015-07-06 10:53:00,2694,"If you looking for something to ""repel"" them out in the boat, then use a spray like Deep Woods Off. However - if you are wanting something to keep them away from you while sitting outside (on a relatively calm day) - using a Thermacell works pretty darn well."
4025578,Aaron-IN,2015-07-06 13:25:00,500,Ultra-thon has always been my favorite bug spray up there.
4027185,J-Man,2015-07-07 06:17:00,191,"Watkins brand ""Great Outdoors"" insect repellent. The lotion is the best.You can't get a better guard against LOTW black flies and skeeters than that."
4027225,JayM5209,2015-07-07 06:22:00,1050,"Here's a good demonstration of well honed critical thinking skills! And expressed well, too."
4027553,Larry S,2015-07-07 08:02:00,665,"Draco,Since you were at Windsor Lake last week how did you do? Fished Windsor in 2006 when Northern Outposts owned the camp, how are the camp buildings and equipment now? Larry S"
4027593,worthsr,2015-07-07 08:14:00,52,Ultra-thon works best for me
