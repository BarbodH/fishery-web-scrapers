4023458,Mike Kansas,2015-07-05 17:28:00,1463,Should not be jamming up Gord. He is one of the best outfitters in Canada and has more fishing expertise than most of us do or will ever have. You Da Man Gord Mike Kansas
4023610,zeebee,2015-07-05 18:23:00,1144,Gordo sticks his foot in his own mouth and continues to gnaw. I just wont let him retract it until he starts to choke.
4023626,zeebee,2015-07-05 18:27:00,1144,Yeah and sometimes u lose 3 minnows before you catch one. I havent had the need to use live bait in years. Its comes with experience/confidence......no pity required.

4019338,Bstar,2015-07-03 09:43:00,564,"I remember hitting the middle of the hatch on Leech Lake, MN years ago. We anchored and slip bobbered minnows about 2' down and tore the walleyes up. They were rising like trout to take the mayflies. What fun! I don't remember how many we caught like that but it had to be in the hundreds."
4020578,Limeyangler,2015-07-04 04:24:00,563,"WOW now that is cool, never heard of that before .good to know, thanks for sharing."
4020586,ftfarms,2015-07-04 04:35:00,444,"One year we hit a big hatch and things where slow. We where sitting next to the reeds and I could hear a strange sound coming from the reeds. I pulled the boat up in the reeds and put a 2"" white twister on and casted it out and reeled it acosss the top of the water. I was catching a walleye every cast for awhile. it was a blast."
4020610,Mike Kansas,2015-07-04 05:32:00,1463,Just got back from the Red River in Manitoba and there were no mayflies and we caught 5 fish over 30 lbs plus tons of fish in the 18 to 22lb size. Oh those were Catfish not Walleye!!! Mike Kansas
4020626,pjshorthorn,2015-07-04 05:38:00,5654,"For a second there you could here a ton of rods and tackle being loaded into boats, trucks, etc. heading to catch a few of the ginormous walleyes on the Red River......... Sounds like you had fun !!!!PjShorthorn"
4020754,Bill Krejca,2015-07-04 07:02:00,6107,"One evening on LOW, I caught a bullhead on a dry fly, first and only time, thought it was a crappie until I got it in. Bill"
4020802,zeebee,2015-07-04 07:19:00,1144,So you guys went out with hundreds of minnows huh? What did u pack a 500 gallon aquarium?
4020842,Mike Kansas,2015-07-04 07:26:00,1463,"Didn't mean to trick anyone just wanted to entice a few to try those Big Red River Cats. They are a blast and they will put a bend on a rod like few have ever seen. Also have been there in October and have put many a 10 lb +++ Walleye in the boat. Biggest Walleye I ever caught there was 35"" and the Manitoba record was caught there at an amazing 39"". It is one monster fishing hole. Mike Kansas"
4021314,v-bay gord,2015-07-04 11:34:00,3168,"It's pretty common to take out 8-10 dozen minnows....either in a couple minnow buckets or in a bait well. Since there's 12 minnows to the dozen, well, you do the math."
4021410,Bstar,2015-07-04 13:19:00,564,Lol! I meant that we caught them during the course of the week that we were there. That was back in the mid 70's. I don't think we even had a fish finder with us.
4002298,v-bay gord,2015-06-26 20:02:00,3168,"For those coming up to NW Ontario this coming week........seems the mayflies are prevalent. A strategy that seems to have worked for my guests this week is to start early....get out of bed! The fish are feeding heavily and are a bit lazy, but early on they will bite like crazy. Second.....the fish are shallow.....don't overlook trolling cranks shallow...or even casting to shallow reed edges. We are marking tons of fish in the areas of mayfly activity.......look for them in the 12 to 16 foot depths, just chilling out. The mayfly hatch can offer some of the best walleye fishing of the season......get with it!"
4003162,fishinnut 3446,2015-06-27 09:36:00,638,"Get out of bed ! Well said Gord.No matter which week we stay, the Son and I are up at day light fishing and have the lake all to ourselves for the first 2-3 hrs."
4003490,Opie,2015-06-27 13:33:00,129,"What do you mean early Gord? We were all out on the water by the crack of 9, or was it 9:30, or maybe closer to 10. OK, maybe it wasn't early. Carry on. Dean Thorn"
4003570,v-bay gord,2015-06-27 14:29:00,3168,"Dean, many fish are caught before you eat your second pancake. I'm only an advocate of early fishing during the mayfly hatch. That would be a bad time for your group to fish."
4003602,prov1800,2015-06-27 15:01:00,5010,"Gord been fishing south/east part of eagle and came up to your neck off the woods on Wednesday. Mayflys havnt been a issue at all.wslleyes have been on fire all day except for yesterday afternoon around 2 they slowed down.but that was weather related as i slowed down to as did my guests.as in past years i have always enjoyed mayfly hatches, as the bite seems to heat up for me as well as the other guides at temple bay lodge.have bern just using tony puccios bait rigs weedless jigs on the weed covered flats.thise jigs are the ticket to getting the weeds without any problems."
4003834,Ebarnett,2015-06-27 17:21:00,60,Heading up to Sioux Lookout in two week. Will the Mayfly hatch be over by then?
4003874,v-bay gord,2015-06-27 17:51:00,3168,"I'm sure it will be.......but really, that's shouldn't be a concern. Some great fishing happens when the mayflies are here."
4007690,tv4fish,2015-06-29 09:37:00,2694,"I would agree that the mayfly hatch on Lac Seul should be over by then. In the areas of LS that we fished last week, the hatch seemed to have started last Thursday (the 25th)."
4018426,David1017,2015-07-02 20:20:00,9,I fished an hour north of Kenora and the mayfly hatch there was June 4th.Slow fishing the next day but after that we caught a ton of nice walleye....I think that's the normal time of year and that location for the hatch
4019130,Fisherman Ted,2015-07-03 08:09:00,461,Interestingly enough this is one of the few times you can catch a walleye on a fly-rod on top-water. Catching a walleye on a fly-rod is difficult enough as it is. On a dry fly it is rarer still.
