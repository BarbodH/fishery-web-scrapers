We have narrowed the lakes down to these three. We mostly fish for walleye but like to catch the occasional big pike, perch, lake trout, or bass. Of these three I am seeking which would be best. Share opinions about these options. Thanks for any responses in advance!!"
4026370,515,2015-07-06 18:33:00,254,I can't speak about the others but I did fish Biggs along time ago and had a great time there. Very nice Island camp.

Nemegosenda offers you the most species and access to the largest water body of the three - ~40km of river and a relatively large lake. The lake is ~20km from the cabin, so probably about a 1 hour trek each way. There's a lodge on the lake as well, so a little less private I suppose. Of the three, I'd think it probably has best chance for trophy Northerns. Also, Nemegosenda offers fishing for walleye, pike, lake trout, smallmouth, whitefish and brook trout.Biggs you've been to, so you already know what that's about. It's the smallest lake of the three, but there are also two portage lakes. Primarily walleye and pike fishing. Not sure if there are perch or whitefish.Bonar has Walleye, Northerns and Perch. There are two outposts on the lake and are VIP cabins, compared to the bush cabin on Biggs. Bonar lake is about 30% larger than Biggs. It offers a beach as well.Sounds like you like the idea of Biggs because you know it has great potential for fishing, but want to explore new places. If you don't mind boating a decent distance to fish the lake, Nemegosenda would be a great choice. Even if you don't, the other ""lakes"" [basically, widenings of the river] likely have some really good fishing . One important consideration though, is the water level will make a difference in fishing/navigation on the river but not nearly as much on a lake. If you are happy with jumbo perch as your bonus fish, enjoy a nicer cabin and like to just walk to the dock, travel a bit and start to fish, then I'd hit Bonar."

4026905,forgop,2015-07-06 23:47:00,880,"I went on one Ivanhoe trip to Schewabic 2 years ago. We got into a lot of pike-more so than we desired and a few smallies in the 2-4# range. A whopping 1 perch was caught in our group of 4 and no trout. Nice camp with indoor shower and I'd like to go back next year if at all possible. The one group of guys I know who have fished their lakes for 45+ years took this year off and may go back next year. Their main lake has been Rice for quite some time, so if it comes down to it, I'll settle for that-if they make it back. A couple of them have had some health issues."
