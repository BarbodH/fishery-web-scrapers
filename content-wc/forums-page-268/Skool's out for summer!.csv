Last year we went up to Lac Seul together for the first time and he has been bugging me to go back since last September. So first chance we got, we went. Fishing is secondary on these trips but I love them just as much, actually I love them more. We search for crayfish, set minnow traps, geocache, swim, fish, beachcomb, picnic and just goof around.........https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmWGJmy3d7M"
