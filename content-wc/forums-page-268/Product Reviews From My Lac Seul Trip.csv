4026394,Carnhzkr,2015-07-06 18:37:00,964,"Three product reviews from my recent fishing trip:1 - Keep Kool Live Bait CoolerFirst of all, I tend to avoid any product that promotes illiteracy as its primary marketing strategy, but I learned years ago to accept any Christmas gift from my wife with an accepting smile. Inside I was thinking ""I don't need this piece of crap"" but outside it was ""thanks Honey, this will be great"". This is one of those bait keepers that you load with ice surrounding the main bait compartment. I thought I'd have to take a separate cooler with extra ice for reloading and the crawlers would get soft by the end of the day, but after one week of solid use, I give it an A-. It really works well to keep crawlers lively and cool, and I never needed to add ice after a 10-hour day. I used to use a small Styrofoam cooler with a frozen water bottle, but the worms tend to get wet from perspiration on the bottle. This product keeps the worms ""kool"" all day and not drenched. It gets an A- because the lid can be difficult to pry open, but it might soften with use.2 - Scheels RodsI had written on this board previously promoting Scheels rods and especially their unconditional warranty. I don't want to start the whole rod warranty conversation again, but even though Scheels will replace any of their rods with a no-questions-asked implied warranty, I'm just not sure I'm sold any more. I had purchased a Scheels One, their top of the line model, earlier this year. I liked the rod fine, but on the last walleye of my trip, after I released the final fish I noticed the top four inches of the rod dangling on my line. I knew they'd replace it for me, but this makes three out of four Scheels rods that have broken on their inaugural voyage. I'm not sure if it's the rod or the person holding the rod, but I'd never broken a rod before, so this time, I replaced my Scheels One with a St Croix Avid X.3 - Ben's Bad Azz BaitsBefore you make a bee-line to Cabelas asking for Ben's BA Baits, don't waste your time. You have to be a member of a highly exclusive club. I'm lucky enough to know someone who knows someone who knows Ben. Actually, that someone is PJShorthorn (you may have seen opinionated ramblings on this site). I have a suspicion that PJS has more of a hand in the R&D, manufacturing, and distribution processes than Ben, but Ben collects the royalties. PJS provided some of his custom spinner rigs for my Beta test. I admit it took awhile for me to warm to them, as they're a different design than I'm used to, but if you don't try something different you'll never learn. His rigs have a single, long-shanked hook with a float directly attached to the end of the shank, then a long row of maybe 12 beads leading to the spinner at the top. I think they worked well because the fish were feeding aggressively and these spinners have a lot of color and flash. If the bite was slow, I might prefer a lesser presentation. The long shank and float attached made them easy for my kids to grasp and bait and the float kept the presentation out of the rocks. One 28"" walleye agreed with my A+ rating."

The more ""bling"" you got, the better the chance you have at getting the girls......don't ya know ????? Sounds like you had a good trip with the family. Sorry about the motor....that can ruin your day. PjShorthorn."

The Keep Kool Bait Cooler is made so (12) of the small refreezable ice blocks will fit perfectly around the inner bait container. Buy (24) and swap them out each morning, putting the warm ones back in the freezer so it will be ready the next morning. It work great, and no melting ice to deal with. Been doing it for years. I think the blocks are made by rubbermade but may be wrong. Give it a try, I bet you will like it. Steve"
