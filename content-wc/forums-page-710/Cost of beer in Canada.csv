555698,Atlanta Dave,2006-03-27 22:22:00,323,We were paying 30 per case until last year and they raised it to 40 a case we are in northern saskatchewan so probably not a bad deal as a lot of flights to get to camp. Atlanta Dave
555701,jigman 2003,2006-03-28 07:52:00,981,"You can bring a case per person, all you do is claim the other two and then stop and pay the duty."
555703,FishTwentyFourSeven,2006-03-28 09:12:00,38,"FishTwentyFourSeven What is the name of the other major beer/liquor store? We like to use them because they accept Credit Cards. Last time I went to the beer store, which was a while ago, they only took cash from us. thanks in advance for the help."
555708,Mohleye,2006-03-28 11:28:00,368,"If you mean in Canada, I think it's LCBO."

555625,Guest,2006-03-24 16:29:00,0,"Most Canadian Beer has a price set by the province. However, there are cheaper brands such as some of the U.S. beer that is sold in canada such as Old Mill. Lucky Lager is a good one! Canadian Strong at 5% and 24 cans will run you about $26 Canadian (just over $20 U.S.)"
555627,jerry bark,2006-03-24 19:59:00,822,"yeah, i think you made my point better than i did! thanks jerry"

555633,Guest,2006-03-25 08:45:00,0,"Thanks for all the info - I was jsut curious, we are going to forge ahead. I like the analogy of price per can in the woods versus the Sports Bar."
555658,Guest,2006-03-26 10:54:00,0,I love beer and sometimes you just have to pay the price for something you like. But I buy the bottom end beer price most of the time( Miller High Life). And when I'am not sharing I buy some good stuff. I can drink it all price or name. And I like all the beer from Canada and not to knock it. But I can not tell much diff. in our cheap beer here in the USA from the cheap beer in Canada. Sleeman Ale taste the same in Florida as it does in Emo Ont. to me. It is all good some better than others. Besides you just rent the beer for a couple of hours and get rid of it. I support the recycle program. Good luck My 3 fav. types of beer 1) Cold beer 2) Free beer 3) Your beer
555695,Guest,2006-03-27 20:13:00,0,Do you have to buy your beer at the duty free place to pay the $6 penalty per case or can I bring 3 cases over the border and pay the penalty on 2 of them?
555552,phishfearme,2006-03-24 08:10:00,1242,"don't forget that that fee includes deposit - and - DO NOT crush the cans. rinse them out, put them back into the case and give them to someone at your flying service as an additional tip. phish"

555555,phishfearme,2006-03-24 09:11:00,1242,jigman - beer cans in ontario are all returnable for deposit and the beer stores will not accept crushed cans. we always box them back up and give them to dock hands who make pretty good money returning them. - phish

555560,Mohleye,2006-03-24 09:54:00,368,"$42 US is what we paid on a fly-in 2 years ago. As someone else said, the outfitter should be expected to get some compensation for buying it, paying the deposit, and flying it to wherever you're going. It seems high, but if you put it in perspective, it's $1.75/bottle for LaBatts Blue in the Canadian wilderness. I paid $3.50/bottle for Miller Lite at a sports bar last weekend."

555540,515,2006-03-23 19:20:00,254,A case of 24 cans should run you about 40 cdn dollars. 24 bottles will be just over 36 cdn.

555549,Guest,2006-03-24 06:45:00,0,"I wouldn't recommend the bottles if flying in. The added weight is unnecessary for the flight. Also, glass in the wilderness is a huge forest fire concern. Cans can be crushed and packed out easier than bottles as well. I hope that helps."

555551,jigman 2003,2006-03-24 07:52:00,981,"Last year a case of Labatts from our outfitter was $39 I believe. That's American. That's the same cost as in the beer store (I think). Yeah, it's a little costly. However, it's real beer. Drink six of those Canadian Labatts and you got a real shine on. Drink 6 American Labatts and you're just a little happy. IMHO-the Canadian beer is worth it. We usually bring our case of beer per man from home, but then buy at least 2 cases per four guys of Canadian beer."
