556159,guide7,2006-04-11 22:38:00,70,Any idea if ice will be gone by the 27th on Clearwater Pipestone chain? We need to get in the boat soon for fish and r & r. Mid 70's in central Minn the last few days and burned up all the ice around here.

556163,Guest,2006-04-12 01:05:00,0,"Yes, I would give it a pretty good chance, like 90%. Not out yet, but soon. I assume you mean the 27th of April. Need a bit more heat, a good rain, and then a big wind once the ice starts breaking up. That's the recipe for a quick ice-out. From a walleye fishing perspective, I certainly wouldn't want the ice out much earlier than that! NWO Fishing Bum"

He said Off lake which is just before Clearwater, started opening up today and should be out within a couple of days for sure and Pipestone is usually 4-5 days after that. Can't wait!"
